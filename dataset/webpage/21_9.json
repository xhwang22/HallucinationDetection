McLain and his uncle John arrived from Rochelle, Illinois. Frank, age 17, began splitting rails for a penny each and saved his money judiciously. His dream was to be a farmer. John\n\nbuilt the second house in Nevada, which was also a hotel. This consisted of an elongated log cabin witha sleeping loft two logs high, a long dining table, and\n\nan adjacent lean-to for cooking.\n\n\n\nIn the late 1850s, the lure of riches in the Colorado gold fields was strong. The McLains and several other Nevada families put other plans on hold and the men headed west to make their fortunes. Most returned without reaching Colorado. Along the way, they met other adventurers returning empty handed. After selling all of his possessions for food, young Frank walked back to Nevada. He saved every penny earned from splitting logs and transporting goods to and from the river in Iowa City.\n\nThese trips took two weeks, for which he earned five dollars. He slept under his wagon and supplemented his diet with game he hunted along the way. He\n\nacquired land as funds were saved from his toil.\n\n\n\nOver the next 10 years, John\u2019s hotel business flourished and \u201cMcLain\u2019s Tavern\u201d became a well-known place to spend the evening and obtain good food and drink. East of Nevada, Frank continued to buy, clear, and tile his growing farm. He married\n\nMary Doyle in 1861, and they built a successful farming and livestock business and raised a family. Their children, Clark and Mildred, were local residents for many years. Mildred was a mother and housewife. Clark was a school administrator and\n\nbanker in Maxwell and later became a banker in Pasadena, California, where he was also Postmaster. He loved the land and returned to Iowa each summer\n\nto establish tile lines and farm buildings.\n\n\n\nClark married Sarah Isabel \u201cBelle\u201d French of Maxwell. One of their children, Frank E. McLain, took over the farming business in the early 1900s. Frank E. lived to be 100 years old and many current residents will remember him and his wife, Mabel.\n\nTheir surviving children, Catherine and Fred, live near Nevada. They own parts of the original land settled by Frank A. McLain. When Fred was serving as a flight instructor in Texas during World War II, he married Jonnie Elna Bale. After the war, they moved\n\nback to Iowa where Fred eventually took over the farming business. Fred and Jonnie had four children. Their youngest son, Frank, joined Fred on the farm in the 1970s. Frank took over the business when Fred and Jonnie retired. Frank and his family live on the original farm near the site of the log cabin where Frank A. and Mary (Doyle) McLain lived in the 1800s.\n\n\n\nToday, the Iowa McLains are aware of their rich pioneer heritage, and continue the traditions of the past, working and improving the land.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.powershow.com/view0/82944a-ZjNkO/Frank_McLain_-_Educational_Achievements_powerpoint_ppt_presentation", "page_content": "PowerShow.com is a leading presentation sharing website.

That regime lives to this day. The Act was seen as an important political event\u2014its passage was reported on the front page of the New York Times the day after President Calvin Coolidge signed it into law\u2014but its deep and lasting significance could scarcely have been contemplated. While radio broadcasting had already become the first mass market electronic communications platform, with about five million households owning (then expensive) AM radio receivers, neither the age of television nor the smartphone revolution were yet visible. Satellites did not circle the earth and the terms \u201ccellular phone,\u201d \u201chi-fi,\u201d \u201cwi-fi\u201d and \u201cmobile broadband\u201d had not been coined.\n\nBut when they were, the 1927 Radio Act still reigned. Traditional interpretations, as supplied by the U.S. Supreme Court, credit the Act with enabling the evolution of wireless services. The thinking was that decentralized bandwidth choices dealing with conflicts among rival spectrum users could not provide the coordination necessary. Endemic spillovers, in the form of interference between stations, would drown out competing activities. Chaos would dissipate the value of the resource, a market failure that could be (and was) remedied by administrative control.\n\nThe Radio Act declared that all airwave access must be authorized by the federal government according to \u201cpublic interest, convenience or necessity.\u201d The standard would be applied by the Federal Radio Commission. The agency was reconstituted as the Federal Communications Commission in the 1934 Communications Act which incorporated, virtually word for word, the 1927 Radio Act. The law deemed that five commissioners, not private firms or entrepreneurs, would determine which technologies, business models, and services were worth the cost they would incur in blocking competing wireless applications.\n\nCoase (1959) objected to the logic of the market failure argument, imagining that conflicts in radio frequency space might be efficiently regulated by markets. Property rights to competing bands would unlock incentives to discover relevant information and to optimize resource use via gains from trade. Costs and benefits would become more transparent via the bids made for ownership rights. As a practical matter, Coase was uncertain that decentralized markets would outperform administrative allocations, but he stressed that as a matter of theory the categorical dismissal of markets was incorrect. The efficient policy depended on how various rule regimes, such as property rights or commission regulation, operated and the transaction costs they incurred. Chief among these were welfare losses from deterring technologies that, under distinct rules, might be accommodated. The pronouncement of \u201cfailure\u201d for markets needed to be symmetrically assessed against regulatory alternatives. That insight, the central point of his famous 1960 essay, \u201cThe Problem of Social Cost,\u201d became widely influential in welfare economics and beyond (Coase 1960).\n\nAnd, over time, the idea that property rights might more effectively govern wireless markets gained ground. With slow and gradual deregulatory moves, FCC regulators (with regulators around the world) made spectrum use rights more flexible. Licenses became increasingly permissive, as did constraints placed on wireless devices deployed in key unlicensed bands (with power limits keeping applications localized). By the late 1980s, cellular telephone carriers were authorized to select their own technologies, design their own network architectures, add services (texting to voice, and then broadband data), and experiment with distinct business models\u2014no \u201cpublic interest\u201d vote by Commissioners needed.\n\nPolicy makers acknowledged and then applauded this trend. With the success of increasingly open markets, the constraints levied by the allocation structure of the 1927 Act became more costly and more obvious. By 2010, the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s National Broadband Plan (FCC 2010) documented how delays from lackluster spectrum allocations had harmed the economy, and advocated market-based mechanisms to push spectrum into higher-valued uses. Specifically, it called for a two-sided auction in which, first, TV station licensees participate in a reverse auction, selling their broadcasting rights back to the FCC such that, second, mobile carriers could bid for new, flexible-use licenses allotted the TV airwaves made vacant. Bidding in the innovative mechanism took place in 2016\u20132017, with about $20 billion in bids collected in the forward, and about $10 billion paid to exiting TV broadcasters in the reverse. The transactions will make about 70 MHz of the 294 MHz in the TV Band available for higher valued uses. What is of historic note is that the \u201cpublic interest\u201d allocation process was formally rejected by policy makers themselves. The regulators charged with determining spectrum use decided that one application was obsolete but could not\u2014for political reasons\u2014be administratively changed. License holders had to be vested with property rights and then paid to cooperate.\n\nIn noting the 90th Anniversary of the Radio Act, articles in this Special Issue of the Review recognize both the importance of the law and the dramatic economic development in the wireless sector it regulates. The Act was heavily influenced by Herbert Hoover who, as Secretary of Commerce, 1921\u20131928, was the first regulator of broadcast radio (under minimalist authorizations awarded Commerce in the 1912 Radio Act). Babette Boliek considers why pro-competition rules were not the focus of the 1927 legislation, and why ex ante regulation, based on \u201cpublic interest\u201d licensing, constituted the chief policy strategy. Her argument is that the decline in antitrust enforcement in the 1920s, combined with the influence of the \u201cprogressive movement,\u201d shaped policy thinking. Hoover\u2019s preference for administrative jurisdiction in a new agency, rather than court enforcement, drove radio rules in a distinct (and less competitive) direction. Even when the shortcomings of this approach were revealed, path dependency steered markets for decades to come.\n\nMy essay deals, in parallel fashion, with the policy choice made in 1927. A new era of spectrum scarcity was launched by Westinghouse\u2019s innovative \u201cbroad\u201d casting model\u2014one-way, point-to-multipoint, emitting from a high transmitter to receivers all around\u2014in late 1920. The immediate popularity of the new wireless service triggered market entry, forcing conflicts, and prompting the Commerce Department to enforce priority-in-use rules adopted from common law. This afforded stability for investments, both by stations and buyers of household radios, but had a political liability: they implied open competition. To pre-empt additional entry, incumbent commercial radio station owners promoted the idea of a \u201cpublic interest\u201d test for broadcasting rights. Policy makers, led by Hoover, embraced the approach to acquire more discretion over license rents and broadcast content. The opening sentence of the 1927 Radio Act explicitly prohibits the assertion of \u201cvested\u201d rights in frequencies, forcing band allocations into a rent-seeking rivalry officiated by the FCC\u2014the \u201cpolitical spectrum\u201d (Hazlett 2017).\n\nIn this issue, scholars take up two specific aspects of the outcome of the Radio Act. Sarah Oh examines patents in the United States to gain insight to how property rights might impact innovation in wireless markets. By examining a database with over 500,000 radio patents, she finds that terms like \u201cinterference\u201d and \u201csensor\u201d tend to be more frequently used in patents that discuss the terms \u201clicensed\u201d and \u201cunlicensed\u201d (apparent references to different spectrum rights allocations). This is consistent with the idea that inventors are responding to constraints erected by policy measures. Most interesting is the possibility that such a large dataset may be used for further investigation on the impact of incentives yielded by the regulatory structure.\n\nGlenn Woroch then takes us back to where we began: competition policy. While the Sherman Act approach was not taken in the 1927 Radio Act, competition rules have gained force within the spectrum regulation system. As rights have been liberalized\u2014particularly in mobile services markets served by cellular networks\u2014regulations have naturally migrated from prescriptive rules that mandate particular services or technologies. But ex ante rule makings remain, focusing on concentration ratios. In designing band plans, license auctions, and merger reviews the FCC has imposed \u201cspectrum screens\u201d to limit input aggregations.\n\nWoroch investigates the relationship between outputs and mobile market concentration in the United States. By consensus, the relationship is non-linear. Regulators, both those governing mergers (either at the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission) and the Federal Communications Commission (with jurisdiction over license transfers), see horizontal mergers as being of little concern up to some critical value. In 2011, for instance, the DOJ and FCC moved to block the proposed AT&T/T-Mobile deal, combining the second- and fourth-largest national networks. Given that there were four large national carriers, the regulatory action revealed that policy makers saw a \u201c4-to-3\u201d transaction as risking anti-consumer output restriction.\n\nWoroch\u2019s investigation quantifies the benefits of deconcentration in the spectrum (MHz) dimension.

The findings suggest that policy makers may have under-appreciated the gains from economies of scale.

Given the binding constraints now applied, it is an assessment with broad implications for economic welfare."}, {"url": "https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/mcfadden-act", "page_content": "The Federal Reserve earned acclaim for America\u2019s economic performance during the Roaring Twenties. The Federal Reserve\u2019s success led to the McFadden Act, which President Calvin Coolidge signed on February 25, 1927.\n\nBy the mid-1920s, bankers, businessmen, and politicians concurred that the Federal Reserve had accomplished the goals set forth at its founding. Since the System began operations, economic growth had been rapid. Interest rates had been stable. Financial crises had been contained. Recessions had been short. Recoveries had been rapid. Gold reserves had risen. The Federal Reserve Note (what we now call the dollar, but which in 1914 was one of many different dollars) had become one of the world\u2019s leading currencies. Banks in the United States had become increasingly profitable and internationally prominent. The world economy, in contrast, had experienced a decade of doldrums following the First World War.\n\nThe McFadden Act tackled three broad issues.\n\nThe first issue involved the Federal Reserve\u2019s longevity. The original charters of the twelve Federal Reserve District Banks were set to expire in 1934, twenty years after the banks began operations. This twenty-year limit mirrored the twenty-year charters given to the First and Second Banks of the United States, the Fed\u2019s nineteenth-century forerunners. Congress refused to recharter those institutions. Everyone knew this fact. The precedent threatened the Fed. To alleviate uncertainty, Congress not only rechartered the Federal Reserve Banks seven years early, but it also rechartered them into perpetuity.\n\nAs it turned out, if Congress had waited to renew the Federal Reserve\u2019s charters, the debate over renewal would have occurred during the Great Depression. The decision may have been different, and the Federal Reserve as we know it today may not exist.\n\nThe second issue involved branch banking.\n\nFrom 1863 through 1927, banks operating under corporate charters granted by the federal government (known as national banks) had to operate within a single building. Banks operating under corporate charters granted by state governments (called state banks) could, in some states, operate out of multiple locations, called branches. Laws concerning branching varied from state to state. The McFadden Act allowed a national bank to operate branches to the extent permitted by state governments for state banks in each state. In a state that prohibited branch banking, for example, national banks could not open branches. In a state that allowed state-chartered banks to operate branches in the same city as their headquarters, a national bank could operate branches in the same city as their headquarters.\n\nComptroller of the Currency Henry M. Dawes, whose proposals shaped the McFadden Act, April 1923. (Photo via Library of Congress Prints & Photographs Division, LC-DIG-npcc-08354)\n\nThe McFadden Act\u2019s branch banking provisions were controversial. Populist opponents of branch banking complained that the law gave too much power to big-city bankers and hurt local communities. Financial reformers claimed that the law did not go far enough and prevented banks from adopting safe, efficient, modern practices. This controversy continued for decades, until reforms in the 1980s and 1990s allowed financial institutions to operate branches throughout the United States.\n\nThe third issue addressed in the McFadden Act involved competition between commercial banks that belonged to the Federal Reserve System and commercial banks that did not.\n\nDuring the 1920s, about one-third of all commercial banks (holding about one-half of all assets) were members of the Federal Reserve System. Federal Reserve member banks faced tougher regulations than banks that did not join the system. In most states, member banks had to have more capital and larger reserves. Members could not invest in types of assets that regulators deemed too risky, insufficiently liquid, or incompatible with the purposes of the national banking system. Members could not engage in many lines of business that nonmember banks found to be increasingly profitable.\n\nMember banks argued that the playing field should be level. The old rules were outdated. The old rules suited the nineteenth century, before the Federal Reserve existed, when investing was riskier, and banks had to be more conservative. In the Roaring Twenties, the economy was booming; member banks should be allowed to operate at the cutting edge of corporate finance. These arguments won the day.\n\nTo level the field, the McFadden Act revised a wide range of banking laws. Some of these revisions altered banking practices. Other revisions explicitly legalized new practices that were not enumerated in previous legislation.1\n\nOne example is subsidiary corporations. The McFadden Act allowed member banks to own and operate subsidiary corporations for the explicit purpose of limiting the member banks\u2019 exposure to risk. Previous legislation neither authorized nor prohibited this practice, but regulators were skeptical and restricted its use. The initial application involved renting safe deposit boxes to customers. To limit the bank\u2019s liability in cases of exceptional losses, banks rented these boxes under the auspices of a subsidiary corporation chartered under state law. The member bank owned all of the stock in the subsidiary. If an extreme loss occurred (e.g., if a terrorist placed a bomb in a safe deposit box), the member bank\u2019s losses were limited to the amount that it invested in its subsidiary.\n\nAnother example is lending. The McFadden Act expanded the size and types of loans that member banks could make. These expansions included the ability to invest more in real estate and to loan larger sums to single corporations.\n\nIn the long run, the McFadden Act changed the structure of the commercial banks regulated by the Federal Reserve. Before the act, a Fed member bank was a single corporation operating out of a single building in a narrow range of activities. After the act, a Fed member could be a complex corporation with multiple legal layers operating from multiple locations; these organizations became larger and more complex as decades passed.\n\nThe academic literature on the McFadden Act focuses almost exclusively on the issue of branch banking, as do comments by leaders of the Federal Reserve System. Rajan and Ramcharan (2012), for example, analyze the political fight over the branch banking provisions in the McFadden Act. Carlson and Mitchener (2009) analyze how the expansion of branch banking affected the performance of financial institutions during the 1920s and 1930s. Kroszner (2006) discusses the McFadden Act\u2019s relaxation of branch banking restrictions. The academic consensus emphasizes the benefits of branch banking and, while acknowledging the McFadden Act expanded branching, suggests that the act did not go far enough. Nationwide branch banking eventually became the law of the land, but not until the passage of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act in 1994."}, {"url": "http://www.1010jiajiao.com/gzyy/shiti_id_175c28dc3079a7c5eb6729ca72cdfd71", "page_content": "Anyone who cares about what schools and colleges teach and how their students learn will be interested in the memoir\uff08\u56de\u5fc6\u5f55\uff09of Ralph W.

In 1825 the Federal Government reserved two townships for the purpose of maintaining institutions of higher education in the territory, and on March 3, 1845, the United States Congress, in an act supplemental to the act admitting Florida as a state in the Union, added two more townships. These townships were granted to the State for the use of two seminaries of learning, one to be located east and the other west of the Suwannee River. The Legislature of the State of Florida in a Legislative Act of January 24, 1851, provided for the establishment of the two institutions of learning, their first purpose to be \"the instruction of persons, both male and female, in the art of teaching all the various branches that pertain to a good common school education; and next to give instruction in the mechanic arts, in husbandry, in agricultural chemistry, in the fundamental laws, and in what regards the rights and duties of citizens.\"\n\nBy 1854 the City of Tallahassee had established a school for boys called the Florida Institute with the hope that the State could be induced to take it over as one of the seminaries, and in the 1854 session of the Legislature of Florida the City of Tallahassee presented a memorial asking that the institution west of the Suwannee be located in that city. That effort was not successful, but in 1856 the Intendant (Mayor) of Tallahassee again offered the Institute's land and building to the Legislature. Francis Eppes, who spent his formative years on the estate of his grandfather President Thomas Jefferson at Monticello in Virginia and shared his views of the importance to a democracy of a liberally educated citizenry, was the Mayor of Tallahassee who made the offer. This time they chose to accept the offer and designated Tallahassee as the site of one of the state seminaries because of its railway connections, its \"salubrious climate,\" and its \"intelligent, refined, and moral community.\" The bill to locate the Seminary in Tallahassee passed both houses and was signed by the Governor on January 1, 1857. On February 7, 1857, the first meeting of the Board of Education of the State Seminary West of the Suwannee River was held, and the institution began offering postsecondary instruction to male students. Francis Eppes served as President of the Seminary's Board of Education for eight years and instilled in the institution the Jeffersonian ideals which characterize it today. The school first became co-educational the following year (1858) when it absorbed the Tallahassee Female Academy, begun in 1843 as the Misses Bates School. Thus the West Florida Seminary, founded in 1851, began operating in 1857, only twelve years after Florida achieved statehood. It was located on the hill where the Westcott Building now stands, which has been the site of an institution of higher education longer than any other site in Florida.\n\nClasses were held at the West Florida Seminary from 1857 until 1863, when the state legislature changed the name to The Florida Military and Collegiate Institute to reflect the addition of a military section which trained cadets. During the Civil War, cadets from the school, ranging in age from twelve to eighteen, fought in the Battle of Natural Bridge and helped make Tallahassee the only Confederate capitol east of the Mississippi not captured during the war. As a result of the brave action of the West Florida cadets in this battle, the Florida State University Army ROTC cadet corps today is one of only three in the nation authorized to display a battle streamer with its flag, which bears the words NATURAL BRIDGE 1865. After the end of the war in 1865, however, Union troops under General McCook descended upon Tallahassee and occupied the city (including campus buildings), remaining for more than a month.\n\nFollowing the war, the institution entered a period of growth and development. In 1884 the first diplomas, Licentiates of Instruction, were awarded, and by 1891 the Institute had begun to focus clearly on what we would today call post-secondary education; seven Bachelor of Arts degrees were awarded that year. By 1897 the institution had evolved into the first liberal arts college in the state, and in 1901 it became Florida State College, a four-year institution organized in four departments: the College, the School for Teachers, the School of Music, and the College Academy. Florida State College was empowered to award the degree of Master of Arts, and the first master's degree was offered in 1902. That year the student body numbered 252 men and women, and degrees were available in classical, literary and scientific studies. In 1903 the first university library was begun. The following quote from the 1903 Florida State College Catalogue adds an interesting footnote to this period:\n\nIn 1883 the institution, now long officially known as the West Florida Seminary, was organized by the Board of Education as The Literary College of the University of Florida. Owing to lack of means for the support of this more ambitious project, and also owing to the fact that soon thereafter schools for technical training were established, this association soon dissolved. It remains to be remarked, however, that the legislative act passed in 1885, bestowing upon the institution the title of the University of Florida, has never been repealed. The more pretentious name is not assumed by the college owing to the fact that it does not wish to misrepresent its resources and purposes.\n\nIn a 1905 reorganization of Florida's educational system by the Legislature, six state institutions of higher learning were consolidated into two when the University of Florida in Gainesville was established and designated a men's school and the Florida State College became a women's school called the Florida Female College. The male student body moved from Tallahassee to Gainesville, taking with it the fraternity system and the College football team, which had been state champions in 1902, 1903, and 1905. In 1909 the name of the college was changed to Florida State College for Women, an institution which grew to become the third largest women's college in the nation during the 1930's. The College became fully accredited in 1915, and a chapter of the National Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi was installed in 1925, the year after the College was placed on the list of standard colleges and universities approved by the Association of American Universities and became a member of the Association of American Colleges. In 1935 the first chapter of Phi Beta Kappa in the state, Alpha Chapter of Florida, was installed at the College, a mark of its status as a true liberal arts college.\n\nThe year 1947 saw many changes. Demand by returning World War II veterans had brought men back to the campus in 1946 with the establishment of the Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida, and on May 15, 1947, the Governor signed an act of the Legislature returning Florida State College for Women to coeducational status and naming it The Florida State University. A permanent president's residence was acquired. The student body, numbering 4,056, chose a new alma mater and selected the Seminole as their athletics symbol. The Flying High Circus was born, and football was started again when the first home game since 1905 was played in October. Three years later Campbell Stadium was built. The first Student Union was established and housed in the \"O Club\" on West Campus, a former Army Air Base which housed mainly men students and provided some classroom space three miles west of the main campus.\n\nThe 1950's brought further development and expansion to the University. To the colleges and schools which had existed since the Florida State College days, Arts and Sciences, Education, Home Economics, and Music, were added Library Science, Social Welfare (later split into Social Work and Criminology), Business, Journalism (discontinued in 1959), and Nursing. A student in the Department of Chemistry was awarded the University's first Ph.D. in 1952. A new building was completed for the Developmental Research School, which in 1905 had evolved from the High School and the College Academy of earlier days as the Observation and Practice School, created to provide on-site opportunities for experience and research to students in Education. Tully Gymnasium, Strozier Library, and the Business Building were completed to enhance the education of the ever-increasing student population.\n\nIn the 1960's the University acquired the Shaw Poetry Collection, established the institutes of Molecular Biophysics and Space Biosciences, and constructed nine new buildings, including the Oglesby Union and the Fine Arts Building. During this period, the Panama Canal Branch was opened, and the Program in Medical Sciences was established. The first black student enrolled in 1962, and the first black Ph.D. candidates graduated in 1970. Programs in African American Studies and Women's Studies were established. Continuing the liberal arts tradition begun in the 1890's, the Liberal Studies Program required of all undergraduates was expanded and strengthened.\n\nBefore 1887 the institution's chief executive officer had the title Principal, but this was changed to President with the appointment of George Edgar in 1887. He was followed by Alvin Lewis in 1892, and Dr. A. A. Murphree in 1897. Dr. Murphree, who came to the Seminary in 1896, became president of Florida Female College in 1905. When he left to become president of the University of Florida in 1909, Dr. Edward Conradi became president of Florida State College for Women. In 1941, Dr. Doak S. Campbell became president. When Dr. Campbell retired as president of The Florida State University on June 30, 1957, Dr. Albert B. Martin served as acting president until September 1, 1957, when Dr. Robert Strozier became president. At Dr. Strozier's death in April of 1960, Dr. Milton W. Carothers became acting president to serve until Dr. Gordon Blackwell took over the duties of president on September 16, 1960.\n\nOn February 1, 1965, Dr. John E. Champion became acting president replacing Dr. Gordon Blackwell, who resigned. Dr. Champion was named president on June 22, 1965; he resigned February 17, 1969, and Dr. J. Stanley Marshall was appointed acting president on the same date. On June 6, 1969, the Board of Regents named Dr. Marshall President; he resigned August 31, 1976. Dr. Bernard Francis Sliger became Interim President on Dr. Marshall's resignation, and on February 7, 1977, the Board of Regents named Dr. Sliger President. At the Fall Meeting of the General Faculty on September 18, 1990, the Dean of the Faculties read a statement on Dr. Sliger's behalf announcing his resignation as president effective August 1, 1991. On March 11, 1991, Dr. Dale W. Lick was designated to succeed Dr. Sliger as president on August 1, 1991. After Dr. Lick's resignation on August 31, 1993, Dr. Sliger was again named Interim President. On November 29, 1993, H. Talbot \"Sandy\" D'Alemberte was designated president effective January 3, 1994. He was succeeded by President Thomas K. Wetherell on January 6, 2003. President Wetherell announced his retirement on June 17, 2009. Eric J. Barron took office as Florida State's 14th president in February 2010. He was succeeded by President John Thrasher who became Florida State\u2019s 15th president on November 10, 2014.\n\nThe years 2001 through 2009 marked a period of major growth on the Florida State campus. A new College of Medicine \u2014 the first to be built in the United States in a quarter-century \u2014 opened with 30 students in 2001; it moved into a new, 300,000-square-foot facility on the campus\u2019s northwest corner in 2004. Regional medical campuses also were soon added throughout the state in Tallahassee, Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Daytona Beach and Fort Pierce, as well as a rural clinic-training site in Immokalee.\n\nDuring this time, Florida State built and renovated approximately 1 million gross square feet of new facilities for academics, students, support and business functions at the university, with a total cost of approximately $800 million. Among the facilities were new laboratory and office space for chemistry and biochemistry, psychology and life sciences; a new building to house the Albert J. and Judith A. Dunlap Student Success Center, where students can receive assistance in clarifying and implementing their educational plans and career goals; and several new and renovated residence halls. Development continued of the Southwest campus, including a new building to house the High-Performance Materials Institute, an interdisciplinary research center that works to develop technologies to make new materials that are stronger, lighter, multifunctional and affordable, as well as new athletic facilities.\n\nThe year 2005 saw the creation of the Office of National Fellowships, which had immediate success in increasing the numbers of undergraduates who received nationally and internationally prominent scholarships and fellowships. As one example, the university produced three U.S. Rhodes Scholars between 2006 and 2009 \u2014 the most of any state university in the country during that time.\n\nAlso in 2005, a major cluster-hiring program for attracting new and talented faculty to Florida State was implemented. The Pathways of Excellence initiative was designed to competitively hire 200 senior and tenure-track faculty to enhance the university\u2019s standing through a series of goals, including a dramatic enhancement in federal grants, contracts, awards, scholarly productivity, graduate programs and faculty recognitions.\n\nThe 2001-2010 period was characterized by a renewed sense of heritage, with construction, landscaping, monuments and signage designed to highlight the university\u2019s history. The period also saw strengthened ties to the Seminole Tribe of Florida.\n\n2010 to 2015 saw Florida State earn the designation of most efficient university in the nation for two years in a row. The university also became one of the most veteran-friendly public universities in the country, and benchmarks were developed, leading Florida State to being named a preeminent university, setting the university on the path to become one of the Top 25 public universities in the nation.\n\nRecent efforts have focused on elevating the university\u2019s reputation as a preeminent research institution; presiding over a $1 Billion fundraising campaign; advancing the university\u2019s academic and research mission; championing diversity and inclusion; and welcoming the best and brightest students in the university\u2019s history.\n\nIn each succeeding decade, Florida State University has added to its academic organization and presently is composed of 16 independent colleges. It has expanded from the original few acres and buildings to 542 buildings on 1,550 acres, including the downtown Tallahassee main campus of 451.6 acres, a farm which for many decades supplied the Florida State College for Women with food, the Seminole Reservation \u2014 a recreational facility, the Marine Laboratory on the Gulf Coast, the Florida A&M University-Florida State University College of Engineering facility, the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, and branch campuses in both Panama City, Fla., and the Republic of Panama. The University has over 50 years of experience in international education and is a nationally recognized leader in the field of study-abroad programs, with permanent study centers in London, Florence, Valencia, and Panama.\n\nFor more information about university history, please visit heritage.fsu.edu."}, {"url": "https://ballotpedia.org/Article_IX,_Florida_Constitution", "page_content": "Email *\n\nFirst Name *\n\nLast Name\n\nPlease complete the Captcha above"}, {"url": "http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=1000-1099/1001/Sections/1001.02.html", "page_content": "Select Year: 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 The Florida Statutes\n\nThe 2022 Florida Statutes (including 2022 Special Session A and 2023 Special Session B)\n\nTitle XLVIII\n\nEARLY LEARNING-20 EDUCATION CODE Chapter 1001\n\nEARLY LEARNING-20 GOVERNANCE View Entire Chapter F.S. 1001.02 1001.02 General powers of State Board of Education. \u2014 (1) The State Board of Education is the chief implementing and coordinating body of public education in Florida except for the State University System, and it shall focus on high-level policy decisions.

The State spends $8,623 per pupil. (Most recent NCES data)\n\nSTATE CONSTITUTION\n\n\u201cThe education of children is a fundamental value of the people of the State of Florida. It is, therefore, a paramount duty of the state to make adequate provision for the education of all children residing within its borders. Adequate provision shall be made by law for a uniform, efficient, safe, secure, and high quality system of free public schools that allows students to obtain a high quality education and for the establishment, maintenance, and operation of institutions of higher learning and other public education programs that the needs of the people may require.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo assure that children attending public schools obtain a high quality education, the legislature shall make adequate provision to ensure that, by the beginning of the 2010 school year, there are a sufficient number of classrooms so that:\n\n(1) The maximum number of students who are assigned to each teacher who is teaching in public school classrooms for prekindergarten through grade 3 does not exceed 18 students;\n\n(2) The maximum number of students who are assigned to each teacher who is teaching in public school classrooms for grades 4 through 8 does not exceed 22 students; and\n\n(3) The maximum number of students who are assigned to each teacher who is teaching in public school classrooms for grades 9 through 12 does not exceed 25 students.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe class size requirements of this subsection do not apply to extracurricular classes. Payment of the costs associated with reducing class size to meet these requirements is the responsibility of the state and not of local school districts. Beginning with the 2003-2004 fiscal year, the legislature shall provide sufficient funds to reduce the average number of students in each classroom by at least two students per year until the maximum number of students per classroom does not exceed the requirements of this subsection.\u201d Fla. Const. art. IX, \u00a7 1(a), as amended by voters in 1998.\n\n\u201cEvery four-year old child in Florida shall be provided by the State a high quality pre-kindergarten learning opportunity in the form of an early childhood development and education program which shall be voluntary, high quality, free, and delivered according to professionally accepted standards. An early childhood development and education program means an organized program designed to address and enhance each child\u2019s ability to make age appropriate progress in an appropriate range of settings in the development of language and cognitive capabilities and emotional, social, regulatory and moral capacities through education in basic skills and such other skills as the Legislature may determine to be appropriate. Fla. Const. art. IX, \u00a7 1(b).\n\n\u201cEach county shall constitute a school district [and each county\u2019s elected] school board shall operate, control and supervise all free public schools within the school district\u2026.

School Board of Collier County, the Florida Supreme Court found that the Legislature may distribute funds unequally on the basis of public school students\u2019 educational need.\n\nIn 1996, the Florida Supreme Court dismissed Coalition for Adequacy and Fairness in School Funding v. Chiles, a case in which plaintiffs alleged that the State was violating the then-current education article in the State constitution. In 1998, after this ruling, the voters approved the current, stronger education article.\n\nIn 2006, the Florida Supreme Court, in Bush v. Holmes, found a voucher law unconstitutional because it caused the State to foster plural, non-uniform systems of education in violation of the constitutional mandate for a uniform system of free public schools.\n\nThe Court found that the \u201cefficient, safe, secure, and high quality\u201d language provides constitutional standards to measure the adequacy provision found in the second sentence of section 1. The Court also concluded that the constitution imposes \u201ca maximum duty on the state to provide for public education that is uniform and of high quality.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, plaintiffs filed Citizens for Strong Schools (CSS) v. Florida State Bd. of Educ., claiming that the State's education funding system violated the constitution\u2019s education article. The trial was held in 2016, and the trial court\u2019s ruling is on appeal before the Florida Supreme Court. A ruling is expected in 2017."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/education/Development-of-state-education", "page_content": "The foundation of secondary schools for girls was in its way one of the most notable achievements of the Third Republic. It was inaugurated by the law of December 22, 1880, named for its author, the Loi Camille S\u00e9e. Until World War II the curricula were different from those of the boys\u2019 schools, and the course of study was only five years. There were no ancient languages, and mathematics was not carried to so high a level as in the boys\u2019 lyc\u00e9es.\n\nThe characteristic European organization has been called the dual plan . Elementary and secondary education were distinct types, and only a minority of the elementary school pupils passed on to the secondary schools, generally only if they were bright and could win scholarships through a competitive examination. The secondary schools were of two kinds: lyc\u00e9es and communal colleges. The lyc\u00e9es, maintained by tuition fees and state scholarships, taught the ancient languages, rhetoric , logic , ethics , mathematics , and physical science . The communal colleges, established by municipalities or individuals and maintained by tuition fees, offered a partial lyc\u00e9e curriculum, featuring Latin, French, mathematics, history, and geography . Pupils who did not complete a secondary education program generally entered civil service or other white-collar occupations. With the development of commerce and industry in the 19th century, France instituted the \u00e9coles primaires sup\u00e9rieures, or \u201chigher primary schools,\u201d for those who did not go on to universities but who needed a better education than the primary schools could give. The curricula of these schools were somewhat more advanced than those of the primary schools; pupils remained longer (up to age 16) and were prepared for employment in business as white-collar workers but generally at a lower level than pupils who came from the lyc\u00e9es. In effect, the different types of schools tended to maintain class cleavages since students of the secondary schools enjoyed higher social and occupational prestige than those of the upper primary schools.\n\nIn European systems of education, secondary education was preeminently a preparation for the university, with aims and ideals of general culture that differentiated it radically and at the very outset from education of the elementary type. Down to the beginning of the 20th century, the French system could be regarded as a typical and extreme example of the European theory.\n\nAfter the Franco-Prussian War , the Third Republic addressed itself to the organization of primary instruction as \u201ccompulsory, free, and secular.\u201d The law of 1878 imposed on communes the duty of providing school buildings and provided grants-in-aid. The national government also henceforth paid salaries throughout the public sector of education. In 1879 a law was passed compelling every department to maintain training colleges for male and female teachers. The law of 1881 abolished fees in all primary schools and training colleges, the law of 1882 established compulsory attendance, and, finally, the law of 1886 enacted that none but laypersons should teach in the public schools and abolished in those schools all distinctively religious teaching .\n\nUnder the restoration of the monarchy in 1814, education fell inevitably under the control of the church. However, during the bourgeois monarchy of Louis Philippe , a law was passed in 1833 that laid the foundations of modern primary instruction, obliging the communes to maintain schools and pay the teachers. The higher primary schools that were founded were suppressed by Roman Catholic conservatives in 1850 (their restoration later constituted one of the great positive services rendered by the Third Republic to the cause of popular education). The 1850 law restored the \u201cliberty of teaching\u201d that, in effect, meant free scope for priestly schools, but it also made provision for separate communal schools for girls, for adult classes, and for the technical instruction of apprentices . In 1854 France was divided for purposes of educational administration into 16 districts called acad\u00e9mies, each administered by a rector and each with a university at the apex of the educational structure. The rector not only was made the chief administrator of the university but also was responsible for secondary and higher education within his acad\u00e9mie. He nominated candidates for administrative positions in his area, appointed examination committees, supervised examination content and procedures, and presided over an academic council. Unlike the political division in some other countries, the acad\u00e9mies were given little power or authority of their own; rather, they were administrative arms of the national ministry of education.\n\nFrench educational history in the 19th century is essentially the story of the struggle for the freedom of education , of the introduction at the secondary level of the modern and scientific branches of learning , and, under the Third Republic , of the establishment of primary education\u2014at once secular and compulsory\u2014between the ages of 6 and 12. There were also a middle education between the ages of 13 and 16 and, finally, a professional and technical education .\n\nSeveral new universities were founded during the 19th century, and the latter half of it saw the founding of a number of girls\u2019 high schools and boarding schools offering an education that was comparable to that available in boys\u2019 public schools and grammar schools . Several training colleges for teachers were established by voluntary agencies, and universities and university colleges toward the end of the century undertook the training of postgraduates as teachers in departments of education created for this purpose.\n\nSecondary education was still left to voluntary and private enterprise. Attention was focused on the \u201cpublic\u201d schools (independent secondary schools such as Eton and Harrow , usually for boarders from upper- and well-to-do middle-class homes), which under the leadership of outstanding headmasters such as Thomas Arnold were thoroughly reformed. As headmaster of Rugby School (1828\u201342), Arnold is credited with changing the face of public education in England by instilling a spirit of moral responsibility and intellectual integrity grounded in Christian ethics . Arnold\u2019s aims of school life\u2014religious and moral principles, gentlemanly conduct, and intellectual ability\u2014were to have an enduring influence on the English public school system.\n\nEngland prolonged its reliance on voluntary initiative for year after year as population increased and, with the growing industrialization , people crowded into the new towns. At last in 1870 Parliament, after long, acrimonious debates, passed an Elementary Education Act , the foundation upon which the English educational system has been built. Religious teaching and worship were the crucial issues in the debates, and the essentials of the settlement agreed upon were (1) a dual system of voluntary and local-authority schools and (2) careful safeguards to ensure as far as possible that no child would receive religious teaching that was at variance with the wishes of his parents. It was left to the school boards\u2014as these first local education authorities were called\u2014to decide on an individual basis whether to make elementary education compulsory in their districts. In 1880, however, it was made compulsory throughout England and Wales, and in 1891 fees were abolished in all but a few elementary schools.\n\nMatthew Arnold was influential in pressing upon the English conscience the importance of public education for the state. While serving as inspector of elementary schools from 1851 to 1886, he studied European school systems and contrasted the meagre educational contributions of the English state with the more generous ones of Continental states.\n\nInfluenced by doctrines of laissez-faire , England hesitated a long time before allowing the state to intervene in educational affairs. At the beginning of the 19th century, education was regarded as entirely the concern of voluntary or private enterprise, and there was much unsystematic philanthropy . Attempts were made to channel and concentrate it, and many hoped that the Church of England and the dissenting churches would join in a concerted effort to provide a national system of elementary education on a voluntary basis. But discordant views prevented such cooperation, and two voluntary societies were founded, one representative of the Church of England and the other of dissent. In 1829 the Roman Catholics were emancipated by law from disabilities they had long suffered, and so they also were able to provide voluntary schools. Other religious bodies joined in the effort to meet the growing need for elementary schools, but it was soon evident that voluntary finance would not be equal to this formidable task. In 1833 the government made a small building grant to these societies, and in this modest way state intervention began. Six years later a committee of the Privy Council was established to administer the state grants, now made annually, and to arrange for the inspection of voluntary schools aided from public funds. The work involved led to the establishment of a small central education department, which was the beginning of the ministry of education.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Tsar Alexander I\u2014influenced by the disintegration of the serf system, the trend toward industrialization and modernization, and the democratic ideas of the French Revolution\u2014tried to institute new educational reforms. The statutes of 1803 and 1804 followed the pattern set by Peter I (the Great) and Catherine II (the Great) in the 18th century for utilitarian, scientific, and secular education. The old Catherinian schools were remodeled and new schools founded. Schools were to be free and under state control. Rural peasants were to be taught reading, writing, arithmetic, and elements of agriculture at the parochial schools (prikhodskiye uchilishcha); pupils in the district schools of urban areas (uyezdnye uchilishcha) and the provincial schools (gimnazii) were to be prepared for careers as civil servants or for other white-collar occupations (law, political economy, technology, and commerce). The elementary and secondary schools were integrated with the universities.\n\nNicholas I, coming to the throne in 1825, considered this democratic trend harmful and decreed that:\n\nIt is necessary that in every school the subjects of instruction and the very methods of teaching should be in accordance with the future destination of pupils, that nobody should aim to rise above that position in which it is his lot to remain.\n\nA new statute of 1828 decreed that parochial schools were intended for the peasants, the district schools for merchants and other townspeople, and gimnazii for children of the gentry and civil servants. Instruction in the gimnazii in Latin and Greek was increased. Although the legislation of Nicholas I established a class system, the utilitarian character of the whole system remained.\n\nThe Russian radical intelligentsia was fiercely opposed to the privileged schools for the gentry and demanded the reestablishment of a democratic system with a more modern curriculum in secondary schools. This was coupled with the demand for the emancipation of the serfs and the equality of women in education. The new tsar in 1855, Alexander II, inaugurated a period of liberal reforms. The serfs were emancipated in 1861, and thus all social restrictions were removed. A new system of local government in rural areas (zemstvo) was enacted with a right to found schools for the peasantry, which were now free. Combined efforts of the government, zemstvos, and peasant communities produced a growth of schools in the rural areas. The utilitarian trend was evident in the establishment of technical schools with vocational differentiation. The education of women was promoted, and the first higher courses for women were founded in main cities.\n\nThe reign of Alexander II, which was later marked by reactionary measures and political oppression, ended in his assassination in 1881 by the terrorist branch of the Narodniki revolutionary organization. A period of reaction followed under his successor, Alexander III. All reforms were suspended, and the growth of educational institutions was interrupted. The chief procurator of the Holy Synod attempted to build up a rival system of parochial schools under the control of the Orthodox clergy, and the minister of public instruction tried to return to the class system of Nicholas I. These reactionary measures set back the growth of education. Four-fifths of all children were deprived of education. The result was that at the turn of the century nearly 70 percent of Russia\u2019s male population and 90 percent of its female population were illiterate (1897 census). The aboriginal dwellers of Russia\u2019s national outskirts (more than one-half of the country\u2019s population) were almost totally illiterate."}, {"url": "http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/acts/index.html", "page_content": "Acts of Parliament\n\nElizabeth I\n\n1571 Oxford and Cambridge Act (13 Eliz 1. c. 29): provided for the incorporation of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, giving or confirming a range of privileges.\n\nGeorge I\n\n1721 Sevenoaks Grammar School and Charity Act (8 Geo. 1 c. 31)\n\nGeorge II\n\n1743 Universities (Wine Licences) Act (17 Geo. 2 c. 40)\n\n1746 University of St Andrews Act (20 Geo. 2 c. 32)\n\nGeorge III\n\n1768 Gresham College etc Act (8 Geo. 3 c. 32)\n\n1771 Morden College Kent Act (11 Geo. 3 c. 10)\n\n1774 Macclesfield Grammar School Act (14 Geo. 3 c. 51)\n\n1776 Natural-born Children of Aliens Act (16 Geo. 3 c. 52)\n\n1777 Rugby School and Alms-houses Act (17 Geo. 3 c. 71)\n\n1778 Henley Grammar School Act (18 Geo. 3 c. 41)\n\n1780 Poor Apprentices Act (20 Geo. 3 c. 36)\n\n1788 Chimney Sweepers Act (28 Geo. 3. c. 48): the first of six Acts regulating the work of chimney sweepers.

Local educational authorities have a duty to fully and faithfully comply with state laws, standards, and rules and to efficiently use the resources available to them to assist the state in allowing adequate educational opportunities. (4) The mission of Florida\u2019s Early Learning-20 education system is to allow its students to increase their proficiency by allowing them the opportunity to expand their knowledge and skills through rigorous and relevant learning opportunities, in accordance with the mission statement and accountability requirements of s. 1008.31. (5) The priorities of Florida\u2019s Early Learning-20 education system include: (a) Learning and completion at all levels, including increased high school graduation rate and readiness for postsecondary education without remediation. \u2014 All students demonstrate increased learning and completion at all levels, graduate from high school, and are prepared to enter postsecondary education without remediation. (b) Student performance. \u2014 Students demonstrate that they meet the expected academic standards consistently at all levels of their education. (c) Civic literacy. \u2014 Students are prepared to become civically engaged and knowledgeable adults who make positive contributions to their communities. (d) Alignment of standards and resources. \u2014 Academic standards for every level of the Early Learning-20 education system are aligned, and education financial resources are aligned with student performance expectations at each level of the Early Learning-20 education system. (e) Educational leadership. \u2014 The quality of educational leadership at all levels of Early Learning-20 education is improved. (f) Workforce education. \u2014 Workforce education is appropriately aligned with the skills required by the new global economy. (g) Parental, student, family, educational institution, and community involvement. \u2014 Parents, students, families, educational institutions, and communities are collaborative partners in education, and each plays an important role in the success of individual students. Therefore, the State of Florida cannot be the guarantor of each individual student\u2019s success. The goals of Florida\u2019s Early Learning-20 education system are not guarantees that each individual student will succeed or that each individual school will perform at the level indicated in the goals. (h) Comprehensive Early Learning-20 career and education planning. \u2014 It is essential that Florida\u2019s Early Learning-20 education system better prepare all students at every level for the transition from school to postsecondary education or work by providing information regarding: 1. Career opportunities, educational requirements associated with each career, educational institutions that prepare students to enter each career, and student financial aid available to pursue postsecondary instruction required to enter each career. 2. How to make informed decisions about the program of study that best addresses the students\u2019 interests and abilities while preparing them to enter postsecondary education or the workforce. 3. Recommended coursework and programs that prepare students for success in their areas of interest and ability. This information shall be provided to students and parents through websites, handbooks, manuals, or other regularly provided communications.

No person in this state shall, on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, religion, or marital status, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any public K-20 education program or activity, or in any employment conditions or practices, conducted by a public educational institution that receives or benefits from federal or state financial assistance. (b) The criteria for admission to a program or course shall not have the effect of restricting access by persons of a particular race, color, national origin, sex, disability, religion, or marital status. (c) All public K-20 education classes shall be available to all students without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, disability, religion, or marital status; however, this is not intended to eliminate the provision of programs designed to meet the needs of students with limited proficiency in English, gifted students, or students with disabilities or programs tailored to students with specialized talents or skills. (d) Students may be separated by sex for a single-gender program as provided under s. 1002.311, for any portion of a class that deals with human reproduction, or during participation in bodily contact sports. For the purpose of this section, bodily contact sports include wrestling, boxing, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports in which the purpose or major activity involves bodily contact. (e) Guidance services, counseling services, and financial assistance services in the state public K-20 education system shall be available to students equally. Guidance and counseling services, materials, and promotional events shall stress access to academic and career opportunities for students without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, disability, religion, or marital status. (3)(a) No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participating in, be denied the benefits of, or be treated differently from another person or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics offered by a public K-20 educational institution; and no public K-20 educational institution shall provide athletics separately on such basis. (b) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a), a public K-20 educational institution may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex if the selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a bodily contact sport. However, when a public K-20 educational institution operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but does not operate or sponsor such a team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered. (c) This subsection does not prohibit the grouping of students in physical education classes and activities by ability as assessed by objective standards of individual performance developed and applied without regard to sex. However, when use of a single standard of measuring skill or progress in a physical education class has an adverse effect on members of one sex, the educational institution shall use appropriate standards which do not have such effect. (d) A public K-20 educational institution which operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics shall provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes. 1. The Board of Governors shall determine whether equal opportunities are available at state universities. 2. The Commissioner of Education shall determine whether equal opportunities are available in school districts and Florida College System institutions. In determining whether equal opportunities are available in school districts and Florida College System institutions, the Commissioner of Education shall consider, among other factors: a. Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes. b. The provision of equipment and supplies. c. Scheduling of games and practice times. d. Travel and per diem allowances. e. Opportunities to receive coaching and academic tutoring. f. Assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors. g. Provision of locker room, practice, and competitive facilities. h. Provision of medical and training facilities and services. i. Provision of housing and dining facilities and services. j. Publicity. Unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each sex or unequal expenditures for male and female teams if a public school or Florida College System institution operates or sponsors separate teams do not constitute nonimplementation of this subsection, but the Commissioner of Education shall consider the failure to provide necessary funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for members of each sex. (e) A public school or Florida College System institution may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of gender, but such facilities shall be comparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex. (4)(a) It shall constitute discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, or sex under this section to subject any student or employee to training or instruction that espouses, promotes, advances, inculcates, or compels such student or employee to believe any of the following concepts: 1. Members of one race, color, national origin, or sex are morally superior to members of another race, color, national origin, or sex. 2. A person, by virtue of his or her race, color, national origin, or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously. 3. A person\u2019s moral character or status as either privileged or oppressed is necessarily determined by his or her race, color, national origin, or sex. 4. Members of one race, color, national origin, or sex cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to race, color, national origin, or sex. 5. A person, by virtue of his or her race, color, national origin, or sex, bears responsibility for, or should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment because of, actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, national origin, or sex. 6. A person, by virtue of his or her race, color, national origin, or sex, should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment to achieve diversity, equity, or inclusion. 7. A person, by virtue of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin, bears personal responsibility for and must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress because of actions, in which the person played no part, committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, national origin, or sex. 8. Such virtues as merit, excellence, hard work, fairness, neutrality, objectivity, and racial colorblindness are racist or sexist, or were created by members of a particular race, color, national origin, or sex to oppress members of another race, color, national origin, or sex. (b) Paragraph (a) may not be construed to prohibit discussion of the concepts listed therein as part of a larger course of training or instruction, provided such training or instruction is given in an objective manner without endorsement of the concepts. (5) Public schools and Florida College System institutions shall develop and implement methods and strategies to increase the participation of students of a particular race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or marital status in programs and courses in which students of that particular race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or marital status have been traditionally underrepresented, including, but not limited to, mathematics, science, computer technology, electronics, communications technology, engineering, and career education. (6)(a) The State Board of Education shall adopt rules to implement this section as it relates to school districts and Florida College System institutions. (b) The Board of Governors shall adopt regulations to implement this section as it relates to state universities. (7) The functions of the Office of Equal Educational Opportunity of the Department of Education shall include, but are not limited to: (a) Requiring all district school boards and Florida College System institution boards of trustees to develop and submit plans for the implementation of this section to the Department of Education. (b) Conducting periodic reviews of school districts and Florida College System institutions to determine compliance with this section and, after a finding that a school district or a Florida College System institution is not in compliance with this section, notifying the entity of the steps that it must take to attain compliance and performing followup monitoring. (c) Providing technical assistance, including assisting school districts or Florida College System institutions in identifying unlawful discrimination and instructing them in remedies for correction and prevention of such discrimination and performing followup monitoring. (d) Conducting studies of the effectiveness of methods and strategies designed to increase the participation of students in programs and courses in which students of a particular race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or marital status have been traditionally underrepresented and monitoring the success of students in such programs or courses, including performing followup monitoring. (e) Requiring all district school boards and Florida College System institution boards of trustees to submit data and information necessary to determine compliance with this section. The Commissioner of Education shall prescribe the format and the date for submission of such data and any other educational equity data. If any board does not submit the required compliance data or other required educational equity data by the prescribed date, the commissioner shall notify the board of this fact and, if the board does not take appropriate action to immediately submit the required report, the State Board of Education shall impose monetary sanctions. (f) Based upon rules of the State Board of Education, developing and implementing enforcement mechanisms with appropriate penalties to ensure that public K-12 schools and Florida College System institutions comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and subsection (3) of this section. However, the State Board of Education may not force a public school or Florida College System institution to conduct, nor penalize such entity for not conducting, a program of athletic activity or athletic scholarship for female athletes unless it is an athletic activity approved for women by a recognized association whose purpose is to promote athletics and a conference or league exists to promote interscholastic or intercollegiate competition for women in that athletic activity. (g) Reporting to the Commissioner of Education any district school board or Florida College System institution board of trustees found to be out of compliance with rules of the State Board of Education adopted as required by paragraph (f) or paragraph (3)(d). To penalize the board, the State Board of Education shall: 1. Declare the school district or Florida College System institution ineligible for competitive state grants. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of s. 216.192, direct the Chief Financial Officer to withhold general revenue funds sufficient to obtain compliance from the school district or Florida College System institution. The school district or Florida College System institution shall remain ineligible and the funds shall not be paid until the institution comes into compliance or the State Board of Education approves a plan for compliance. (8) A public K-20 educational institution must treat discrimination by students or employees or resulting from institutional policies motivated by anti-Semitic intent in an identical manner to discrimination motivated by race. For purposes of this section, the term \u201canti-Semitism\u201d includes a certain perception of the Jewish people, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jewish people, rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti-Semitism directed toward a person, his or her property, or toward Jewish community institutions or religious facilities. (a) Examples of anti-Semitism include: 1. Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews, often in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion. 2. Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as a collective, especially, but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions. 3. Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, the State of Israel, or even for acts committed by non-Jews. 4. Accusing Jews as a people or the State of Israel of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust. 5. Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interest of their own nations. (b) Examples of anti-Semitism related to Israel include: 1. Demonizing Israel by using the symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism to characterize Israel or Israelis, drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis, or blaming Israel for all inter-religious or political tensions. 2. Applying a double standard to Israel by requiring behavior of Israel that is not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation or focusing peace or human rights investigations only on Israel. 3. Delegitimizing Israel by denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination and denying Israel the right to exist. However, criticism of Israel that is similar to criticism toward any other country may not be regarded as anti-Semitic. (c) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to diminish or infringe upon any right protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, or the State Constitution. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to conflict with federal or state discrimination laws. (9) A person aggrieved by a violation of this section or a violation of a rule adopted under this section has a right of action for such equitable relief as the court may determine. The court may also award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and court costs to a prevailing party.

History. \u2014 s. 12, ch. 2002-387. 1000.32 Regional compact. \u2014 The compact entered into by the state and other Southern States by and through their respective governors on February 8, 1948, as amended, relative to the development and maintenance of regional education services and schools in the Southern States in the professional, technological, scientific, literary and other fields so as to promote greater educational facilities for the citizens of the several states who reside in said region, a copy of said compact, as amended, being as follows: THE REGIONAL COMPACT (as amended) WHEREAS, The States who are parties hereto have during the past several years conducted careful investigation looking toward the establishment and maintenance of jointly owned and operated regional educational institutions in the Southern States in the professional, technological, scientific, literary, and other fields, so as to provide greater educational advantages and facilities for the citizens of the several states who reside within such region; and WHEREAS, Meharry Medical College of Nashville, Tennessee, has proposed that its lands, buildings, equipment, and the net income from its endowment be turned over to the Southern States, or to an agency acting in their behalf, to be operated as a regional institution for medical, dental and nursing education upon terms and conditions to be hereafter agreed upon between the Southern States and Meharry Medical College, which proposal, because of the present financial condition of the institution, has been approved by the said states who are parties hereto; and WHEREAS, the said states desire to enter into a compact with each other providing for the planning and establishment of regional educational facilities; NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and obligations assumed by the respective states who are parties hereto (hereinafter referred to as \u201cstates\u201d), the said several states do hereby form a geographical district or region consisting of the areas lying within the boundaries of the contracting states which, for the purposes of this compact, shall constitute an area for regional education supported by public funds derived from taxation by the constituent states and derived from other sources for the establishment, acquisition, operation and maintenance of regional educational schools and institutions for the benefit of citizens of the respective states residing within the region so established as may be determined from time to time in accordance with the terms and provisions of this compact. The states do further hereby establish and create a joint agency which shall be known as the Board of Control for Southern Regional Education (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cboard\u201d), the members of which board shall consist of the governor of each state, ex officio, and four additional citizens of each state to be appointed by the governor thereof, at least one of whom shall be selected from the field of education, and at least one of whom shall be a member of the legislature of that state. The governor shall continue as a member of the board during his or her tenure of office as governor of the state, but the members of the board appointed by the governor shall hold office for a period of four years except that in the original appointments one board member so appointed by the governor shall be designated at the time of his or her appointment to serve an initial term of two years, one board member to serve an initial term of three years, and the remaining board member to serve the full term of four years, but thereafter the successor of each appointed board member shall serve the full term of four years. Vacancies on the board caused by death, resignation, refusal or inability to serve, shall be filled by appointment by the governor for the unexpired portion of the term. The officers of the board shall be a chair, a vice chair, a secretary, a treasurer, and such additional officers as may be created by the board from time to time. The board shall meet annually and officers shall be elected to hold office until the next annual meeting. The board shall have the right to formulate and establish bylaws not inconsistent with the provisions of this compact to govern its own actions in the performance of the duties delegated to it including the right to create and appoint an executive committee and a finance committee with such powers and authority as the board may delegate to them from time to time. The board may, within its discretion, elect as its chair a person who is not a member of the board, provided such person resides within a signatory state, and upon such election such person shall become a member of the board with all the rights and privileges of such membership. This paragraph as amended in 1957 shall be effective when eight or more of the states party to the compact have given legislative approval to the amendment. It shall be the duty of the board to submit plans and recommendations to the states from time to time for their approval and adoption by appropriate legislative action for the development, establishment, acquisition, operation and maintenance of educational schools and institutions within the geographical limits of the regional area of the states, of such character and type and for such educational purposes, professional, technological, scientific, literary, or otherwise, as they may deem and determine to be proper, necessary or advisable.

If a child\u2019s official education records cannot be released to the parents for the purpose of transfer, the custodian of the records in the sending state shall prepare and furnish to the parent a complete set of unofficial educational records containing uniform information as determined by the Interstate Commission. Upon receipt of the unofficial education records by a school in the receiving state, that school shall enroll and appropriately place the student based on the information provided in the unofficial records pending validation by the official records, as quickly as possible. B. Simultaneous with the enrollment and conditional placement of the student, the school in the receiving state shall request the student\u2019s official education record from the school in the sending state. Upon receipt of the request, the school in the sending state shall process and furnish the official education records to the school in the receiving state within 10 days or within such time as is reasonably determined under the rules adopted by the Interstate Commission. C. Compact states must give 30 days from the date of enrollment or within such time as is reasonably determined under the rules adopted by the Interstate Commission for students to obtain any immunization required by the receiving state.

Students shall be allowed to continue their enrollment at grade level in the receiving state commensurate with their grade level, including kindergarten, from a local education agency in the sending state at the time of transition, regardless of age. A student who has satisfactorily completed the prerequisite grade level in the local education agency in the sending state is eligible for enrollment in the next highest grade level in the receiving state, regardless of age. A student transferring after the start of the school year in the receiving state shall enter the school in the receiving state on their validated level from an accredited school in the sending state. ARTICLE V PLACEMENT AND ATTENDANCE.\u2014 A. If a student transfers before or during the school year, the receiving state school shall initially honor placement of the student in educational courses based on the student\u2019s enrollment in the sending state school or educational assessments conducted at the school in the sending state if the courses are offered. Course placement includes, but is not limited to, Honors, International Baccalaureate, Advanced Placement, vocational, technical, and career pathways courses. Continuing the student\u2019s academic program from the previous school and promoting placement in academically and career challenging courses should be paramount when considering placement. A school in the receiving state is not precluded from performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement and continued enrollment of the student in the courses. B. The receiving state school must initially honor placement of the student in educational programs based on current educational assessments conducted at the school in the sending state or participation or placement in like programs in the sending state. Such programs include, but are not limited to: 1. Gifted and talented programs; and 2. English as a second language (ESL). A school in the receiving state is not precluded from performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement and continued enrollment of the student in the courses. C. A receiving state must initially provide comparable services to a student with disabilities based on his or her current individualized education program (IEP) in compliance with the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. s. 1400, et seq. A receiving state must make reasonable accommodations and modifications to address the needs of incoming students with disabilities, subject to an existing section 504 or title II plan, to provide the student with equal access to education, in compliance with the provisions of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.A. s. 794, and with title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. ss. 12131-12165.

ARTICLE VI ELIGIBILITY.\u2014 A. When considering the eligibility of a child for enrolling in a school: 1. A special power of attorney relative to the guardianship of a child of a military family and executed under applicable law is sufficient for the purposes of enrolling the child in school and for all other actions requiring parental participation and consent. 2. A local education agency is prohibited from charging local tuition to a transitioning military child placed in the care of a noncustodial parent or other person standing in loco parentis who lives in a school\u2019s jurisdiction different from that of the custodial parent. 3. A transitioning military child, placed in the care of a noncustodial parent or other person standing in loco parentis who lives in a school\u2019s jurisdiction different from that of the custodial parent, may continue to attend the school in which he or she was enrolled while residing with the custodial parent. B. State and local education agencies must facilitate the opportunity for transitioning military children\u2019s inclusion in extracurricular activities, regardless of application deadlines, to the extent they are otherwise qualified. ARTICLE VII GRADUATION.\u2014In order to facilitate the on-time graduation of children of military families, states and local education agencies shall incorporate the following procedures: A. Local education agency administrative officials shall waive specific courses required for graduation if similar coursework has been satisfactorily completed in another local education agency or shall provide reasonable justification for denial. If a waiver is not granted to a student who would qualify to graduate from the sending school, the local education agency must provide an alternative means of acquiring required coursework so that graduation may occur on time. B. States shall accept exit or end-of-course exams required for graduation from the sending state; national norm-referenced achievement tests; or alternative testing, in lieu of testing requirements for graduation in the receiving state. If these alternatives cannot be accommodated by the receiving state for a student transferring in his or her senior year, then the provisions of Article VII, Section C shall apply. C. If a military student transfers at the beginning of or during his or her senior year and is not eligible to graduate from the receiving local education agency after all alternatives have been considered, the sending and receiving local education agencies must ensure the receipt of a diploma from the sending local education agency, if the student meets the graduation requirements of the sending local education agency. If one of the states in question is not a member of this compact, the member state shall use its best efforts to facilitate the on-time graduation of the student in accordance with Sections A and B of this Article.
