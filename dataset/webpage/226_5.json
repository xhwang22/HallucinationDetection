{"Virginia Bottomley was elected as MP for South West Surrey in 1984, and served as a junior minister in the Department of Health from 1989 to 1992.": [{"url": "https://www.islandlifemagazine.co.uk/virginia-my-passion-for-island/", "page_content": "In her 10 years as a Cabinet Minister Virginia Bottomley was one of the most powerful women in British politics. But even she will admit she didn\u2019t quite carry the clout of the woman who virtually ordered her to become a Member of Parliament \u2013 none other than former Prime Minister, \u2018Iron Lady\u2019 Margaret Thatcher.\n\nDuring her decade at the cutting edge of Government, and in all during her 21 years as a serving MP, Virginia never lost sight of the education of life and good values that were instilled into her as a young girl growing up, for the most part, here on the Island.\n\nDespite being born in Scotland, simply because her father was working there at the time, she, along with numerous family members, calls the Island her home. She is here as often as she can be, despite now being an active member of the House of Lords as Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone, as well as working as a head-hunter for a high-profile company in London. She chairs the Odgers Berndtson Board & CEO Practice, which conducts searches for Chairmen, CEOs and non-executive directors for plcs and private companies.\n\nDuring a break away from life in the fast lane that she still enjoys, Virginia took time out to give \u2018Island Life\u2019 readers an insight into her interesting and rewarding career as an MP, and her love of the Island.\n\nShe revealed: \u201cMy great grandfather Sir Edward Poulton came to St Helens Cottage in about 1890, and in 1915 he gave St Helens Common to the National Trust. My other grandfather Dr. William Garnett bought a house in Seagrove Bay around 1900.\n\n\u201cMy grandparents met playing hockey in Priory Bay, and we still play hockey there, so the family have been doing that for more than 100 years. All my family were quite academic and very involved in public policies. Dr William Garnett was involved in introducing education to London as one of the original signatories of the London School of Economics where I studied, so I am very proud of him.\u201d\n\nHer family bought half of Priory Bay in 1926, and the family home was built the following year. Since then the whole family has been down here constantly, with often as many as 100 relations gathering in the summer.\n\nVirginia points out: \u201cWe all share a passion for the Island. As a young girl I remember we had these appalling traditions, so every Easter Monday we would walk from Horestone Point to Whitecliff Bay \u2013 again a walk that was started by my great grandfather in 1890. The other tradition is swimming to St Helens Fort. My great uncles who were killed in the First World War did it, and I swam to the Fort when I was 10 years old.\n\n\u201cAnother childhood memory was when we loaded up the dinghies and drove to Freshwater and then rowed around and had a picnic in Scratchells Bay. Another time we had a running race from Freshwater to home. We really went for it, and couldn\u2019t move for a week afterwards. It was a competitive environment.\n\n\u201cWhen we were young Priory Bay was quite distant from Ryde because people didn\u2019t have cars and we went everywhere by boat. I think we learned a great resilience. Sometimes the tide and wind are against you and you make no progress. On other occasions you have the tide and wind with you, and even though you don\u2019t make much effort you travel like a rocket. I think that is the most wonderful lesson for life \u2013 sometimes you work so hard and it doesn\u2019t happen, but other times you just sail through it.\u201d\n\nVirginia recalls one of the most influential people in her life was her \u2018very special\u2019 aunt Peggy Jay. She said: \u201cShe was in politics and had a massive influence on me, and I say my husband Peter only married me because he thought I would turn out like Peggy Jay. She was a member of the Greater London Council, and was forceful. She was a great reformer and campaigner. She was brought up on the Island, and was a wonderful mentor.\u201d\n\nDespite being married to a Tory MP, Virginia had never given much thought to joining him in the Commons. Then one day her whole life changed when she received a call from 10 Downing Street, on the orders of PM Margaret Thatcher, saying more female MPs were required, and she was on the \u2018wanted list\u2019.\n\nShe continued: \u201cI decided Peggy Jay should have been an MP, but she wasn\u2019t so I would be. I wanted Peter to be the MP for the Isle of Wight long ago, and then in 1982 it came up for the following year\u2019s General Election. I worked so hard and actually got 34,900 votes \u2013 only five people in the country got more votes than I did, but one of those was Liberal Stephen Ross, the sitting MP, who beat me.\n\n\u201cI was devastated. The campaign was \u2018Turn Wight Blue\u2019 and Mrs. Thatcher even came over to visit. The day after I had lost she rang me to say \u2018what bad luck\u2019 and I burst into tears. But it made me realise much more about the Island; the huge delights, but also some of the difficulties and dilemmas.\n\n\u201cI learned how hugely entrepreneurial and creative the Island is with lots of small businesses and so many dedicated people. We all hope it can become an Island of real enterprise and creativity in small businesses. With modern technology, distance working and IT, my senses are that it is going to become ever more possible to realise this vision. The Island really has everything going for it.\n\n\u201cWhatever I have done, I have always felt part of my energy was put into developing and promoting the Island in any way I could. The Island needs all the help it can get to make people realise what a wonderful and exciting place it is.\u201d\n\nVirginia became MP for South West Surrey in 1984. There were 365 applicants to be the Tory candidate, but she was chosen and subsequently won the seat. She said: \u201cAt the time there were just 23 women MPs in a House of Commons of more than 600, so we were like an endangered species. Now the ratio is about one in four. I loved the constituency life and being involved in every aspect.\u201d\n\nInitially she served under Margaret Thatcher and then John Major, and received her first ministerial position in 1988 as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Department of the Environment. She was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Health in 1989, and was appointed a member of the Privy Council upon joining Major\u2019s Cabinet as Secretary of State for Health in 1992, serving until 1995.\n\nShe then served as Secretary of State for National Heritage until 1997. After the 1997 General Election, she returned to the back benches, saying: \u201cI had been working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and returning to the back benches enabled me to re-connect with my family. After 10 years I felt I had done my time and needed my life back.\u201d\n\nLooking back on her 10 years as a Minister, Virginia recalls: \u201cMrs. Thatcher called me one day to see her on a Monday, which was unusual. I said I was busy and could it be later in the week. But I was summoned and she offered me a job as a Minister. I was so surprised. She wanted me to go to Environment, but I had only ever spoken about Defence, Agriculture or transport, and knew nothing about it.\n\n\u201cShe replied very smartly that I would have to read up on it! It was very interesting getting people to use unleaded petrol, and recycle. But I loved being Secretary of State for Health because it was so demanding and intense. It was a job where I had a real role with serious responsibilities. I had to take difficult decisions, so I had to be courageous and tenacious to survive.\u201cWhen I first became a Minister I had a very bright young man in Central Office. He was 23 and used to coach and brief me when I went on television\u2019s \u2018Question Time\u2019. He was a very clever, positive person, and his name was David Cameron!\u201d\n\nThat is one of the main reasons why Virginia is very supportive of the present team, even though she believes coalition must be \u2018incredibly frustrating, compromising and complex\u2019.\n\nAfter quitting the Cabinet Virginia continued to work closely with Tory leaders William Hague, Ian Duncan Smith and Michael Howard. It was Howard who put her in the House of Lords in 2005. She said: \u201cI was absolutely delighted, and it was unexpected. Some of the debates in the Lords are phenomenal, and it will be a great loss if it goes. But I accept it is hard to justify.\u201d\n\nVirginia added: \u201cI am someone who is constantly restless, so I am never really satisfied. I have been married coming up 45 years to the same person, and that is something that gives great strength. But if you can find a role in life that in your way plays to your strengths and minimises your many failings then you are privileged.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Virginia_Bottomley", "page_content": "What we do.

She later graduated from the London School of Economics with the degree of Master of Arts (MA).\n\nShe began her working life as a social scientist and was a researcher for the Child Poverty Action Group.[5] She has also been a social worker, magistrate (Justice of the Peace), and Chairman of the Inner London Juvenile Court.[6]\n\nMember of Parliament and in government\n\nAfter unsuccessfully contesting the Isle of Wight in the 1983 general election (34,904 votes), she was elected to Parliament with 21,545 votes in a by-election in 1984 (filling the seat left vacant by the death of Maurice Macmillan, son of former prime minister Harold Macmillan),[7] as the Member for South West Surrey, was PPS to Chris Patten and then to Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, received her first ministerial position in 1988 as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Department of the Environment[8][9] and was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Health in 1989.[9] She was appointed a member of the Privy Council (PC) upon joining John Major's Cabinet as Secretary of State for Health in 1992,[10][11] becoming the ninth woman to serve in the British cabinet.[12] She served as Health Secretary until 1995.[13]\n\nBottomley and Ann Widdecombe have been listed as co-founders of Lady Olga Maitland\u2019s pro-nuclear Women and Families for Defence group.[14]\n\nShe served as Secretary of State for National Heritage from 1995 to 1997.[11][15] During this period, she appeared in the Eurovision Song Contest 1996, wishing luck to the United Kingdom's entrant, Gina G.[16]\n\nAfter the 1997 general election, she returned to the backbenches, and become a headhunter at Odgers, where she headed and now chairs the company's Board & CEO Practice.[17]\n\nRetirement\n\nShe stepped down from the House of Commons when the 2005 general election was called.[7] On 24 June 2005 she was created a life peer with the title Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone, of St Helens in the County of Isle of Wight,[11][18] the parish where she was baptised and celebrated her marriage.\n\nPersonal life\n\nBottomley is involved with charitable and academic bodies in addition to business. She was on the founding Council of the University of the Arts, London. She was a Council Member of the Ditchley Foundation and was President of Farnham Castle, Centre for International Briefing. From 2000 until May 2012 she sat on the Supervisory Board of Akzo Nobel, taking over Courtaulds and then ICI. She was a non-executive director of Bupa, a healthcare company. She was on the Advisory Council of the International Chamber of Commerce UK (ICC UK) and the Judge School of Management, Cambridge. Bottomley has been a trustee and is a fellow of the Industry and Parliament Trust. She was National President of the Abbeyfield Society[19] and a Vice-Patron of Carers and of Cruse Bereavement Care. She was a lay canon of Guildford Cathedral, and a Freeman of the City of London.\n\nIn 2006, she was elected and installed as Chancellor of the University of Hull, succeeding Lord Armstrong of Ilminster in April 2006.[20] She was also appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Surrey in March of that year and Sheriff of Hull since 2013.[21] She is the longest serving trustee of The Economist newspaper.[22]\n\nVirginia Garnett married Peter Bottomley in 1967, after the birth of their eldest child;[23][24] since 1975 he has been an MP.[25]\n\nDuring her time in Prime Minister John Major's cabinet, the satirical puppet show Spitting Image often portrayed Major as having an unrequited crush on Bottomley; years later, it was revealed that Major was having an affair with Edwina Currie at the time.[26]\n\nBottomley's family includes many figures in politics and public life. Her brother, Christopher Garnett, was the chief executive of train operating company GNER.[27] Her aunt Pauline married Roland Hunt who is not connected to Sir Nicholas Hunt, father of Jeremy Hunt who succeeded her as MP.[citation needed]\n\nHer cousins include Peter Jay (the former British Ambassador to the United States[28] and son-in-law to James Callaghan), and Lord Hunt of Chesterton (father of historian and former Labour MP Tristram Hunt).\n\nMore distant relatives include Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay[28] and Baron Jay of Ewelme (former FCO PUSS and British Ambassador to France).\n\nJulia Cleverdon married Bottomley's late father, John.[29] Her husband's niece is Kitty Ussher (a former Labour minister).[30]\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://www.liquisearch.com/virginia_bottomley/member_of_parliament_and_in_government", "page_content": "\u201cWhen Hitler attacked the Jews ...

Now \u2013 with the help of some initial sleuthing by regular Slogger Jackie \u2013 I can offer readers a big clue: they are cousins. Laid out below (for anyone with any feeling for the importance of meritocracy) is how still, in 2012, career progress of the type admired by David Cameron \u2013 \u201cthe leg up\u201d \u2013 is alive and well. One where the right tie, who you know, and above all a well-connected family, are all you need to prosper.\n\nHaving studied the modus operandi of Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt for some eighteen months now, the most striking thing about him is a penchant for toughing out any and all criticisms with a bare face. Almost nothing uttered in public by this man is ever anything other than an embellishment, or a distortion, or a boldly stated but clearly inaccurate statement: \u201cI gave full disclosure\u201d, \u201cI have done nothing wrong\u201d, \u201cIt was a purely fact-finding mission\u201d and so forth.\n\nToday at the Conservative Party conference, Hunt excelled himself by suggesting to his audience that his father \u201cworked as a manager for the NHS\u201d. It is an exaggeration served with lashings of deception: Sir Nicholas John Streynsham Hunt (Daddy) was Admiral of the Fleet in his main career and, once retired, became a quangoista par excellence. He was Chairman of the South West Surrey District Health Authority from 1990 to 1995 and then Chairman of Nuffield Hospitals from 1996 to 2001.\n\nRing any bells? The clues are \u2018South West Surrey\u2019, \u2018Health\u2019 and \u2018Nuffield\u2019. And it might not be too hard to imagine where he got the assist into those cosy sinecures: for not long previously, his niece Virginia Bottomley had been\u2026.Minister of Health.\n\nAdmiral Sir John had an elder brother (now carefully airbrushed out of the Wikipedias and other genealogies), one Roland Colin Charles Hunt. He married Hilda Pauline Garnett, whose brother was W. John Garnett. WJG had a daughter called Hilda Brunette Maxwell Garnett\u2026.aka, Virginia Bottomley.\n\nVirginia Bottomley eventually became MP for South West Surrey.\n\nRing any bells? Ah yes, that\u2019ll be the same South West Surrey for which her cousin Jeremy Hunt became MP when Virginia decided to quit open politics and become a quangoista\u2026just like her uncle the Admiral of the Fleet.\n\nAnd this wasn\u2019t the first time La Bottomley had been helpful to cousin Jeremy. She\u2019d joined infamous quango The British Council. And it might not be too hard to imagine where Jezzer got the assist into becoming a monopoly supplier to the British Council with his company Hotcourses.\n\nNor would it involve much of a lateral leap in thought to understand how \u2013 after Hotcourses completely cocked up the first job it did for the Council \u2013 an elaborate system of shelf companies and oddly-headed invoices enabled Jeremy to carry on secretly being a preferred monopoly supplier to The British Council for the next five years\u2026on the back of which he amassed the fortune of which he is so proud today.\n\nThen Virginia moved upwards into Another House, becoming Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone in 2005 \u2013 handing her seat to Jeremy Hunt as if it might be a family heirloom. Hunt was duly elected, and South West Surrey thus became a Rotten Borough.\n\nThis is what Baroness Nettlestone mainly gets up to in the Lords: she lobbies on behalf of the private health sector via her directorship of BUPA. She must\u2019ve been a shoe-in for that little earner, she having been Health Secretary in charge of the public sector an\u2019 all\u2026but then, probably Uncle Admiral\u2019s contacts at Nuffield helped. You know how these things work.\n\nRight then\u2026.private health lobbying, and a creeping pauperisation of NHS hospitals by former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley. But Andrew was a bit accident-prone \u2013 rather like his Cabinet colleague Jeremy Hunt, who partnered Newscorp in his educational supplies business, went to New York to broker a change of Newscorp\u2019s Party preference from Labour to Tory, and then was quite coincidentally put in charge of adjudicating on the Newscorp bid for BSkyB. As we all know, that ended in tears.\n\nBut Jeremy Richard Streynsham Hunt didn\u2019t go down a snake like the luckless Lansley. He went two rungs up the ladder to become\u2026.Secretary of State for Health. To paraphrase the old Lord Robert Cecil gag about \u2018Bob\u2019s yer uncle\u2019 it seems the only way is up if Ginny\u2019s yer cousin. As I blogged yesterday, Cameron didn\u2019t want to give Jezzer the job. But Mr Hunt appears to have three very strong holds on the Prime Minister.\n\nFirst, he is very \u2013 like I mean extremely \u2013 well in at Newscorp. \u201cJeremy is our man now: don\u2019t mess with him\u201d. Second, he is bankrolled by murky mega-donor JHJ Lewis \u2013 Chairman of the Groucho Club (a media-luvvie venue proven to have illegally recorded the coke-snorting antics of its celebrity customers) and influential eminence grise in the Conservative Party. And third, he has the influence and contacts via Bottomley to oil wheels here and there in the gradual sale of an insolvent NHS to organisation like \u2013 and here I\u2019m only offering suggestions of course \u2013 BUPA and Nuffield.\n\nSo there\u2019s Jeremy newly installed as Health Secretary after just seven short years as an MP. This is a summary of his meteoric rise:\n\nHe made a fortune at the taxpayers\u2019 expense as monopoly supplier to a notorious quango where, by happy coincidence, his cousin sat on the Board. He became MP for SW Surrey where, by happy coincidence, his cousin had been MP previously. He became Minister in charge of Media & Culture where, by happy coincidence, he wound up steering his pals at Newscorp in the right direction. And he became Health Secretary partly because, by happy coincidence, his cousin is a lobbyist for the private health sector.\n\nThe Conservative Party claims to be all about the Bonfire of the Quangos, the Party where everyone who wants to work hard can get an even break, and the Big Society. But its members, acolytes and backers remain what they\u2019ve always been: a small Secret Society where who is far more important than what you know. Hilariously, Virginia Bottomley has described herself as \u201ca one-nation\u201d Conservative. Well I guess we now know which of Disraeli\u2019s two nations she was talking about.\n\nSadly, \u2018Red\u2019 Ed\u2019s flimsy attempt to take on the mantle of Benjamin Dizziband last week is no kind of alternative to the privatisation and commercial exploitation of Westminster by the Tory Party\u2019s mates in big business and banking. The Ed Miller Band too has its UNITE mates who must be satisfied, its largely pro-Labour immigrants who must be loved up, its teachers who resist real educational reform, and its public sector employees who vote Labour by a margin of two to one.\n\nThe truth is that none of our triumvirate of Westminster Parties has the majority citizen in mind when formulating policy. The Libdems represent slavish support for Brussels and all its works. Labour thinks equality is about affirmative, favouritist action for noisy minorities. And the Tories think they work for anyone with money and power. Brick by brick, the Wall of Class knocked down during the 1950s has been replaced by the Barrier of Influence in the 21st century. Merit? It doesn\u2019t even get a look in. Decency? That\u2019s for wimps.\n\nAll this disgusting graft, influence and interest-group manipulation can only be ended by banning all monied political lobbying and all political Party contributions, whatever their size. I repeat, the State must fund all political Parties and keep commerce out: it is the only way our once great and respected political culture can be revived.\n\nI would urge all those reading this piece to examine the evidence presented as to the character of Our Jeremy at The Slog\u2019s dedicated page, Hunt Balls.\n\nI think the time may have come for an all-voter petition demanding the removal of Mr Hunt from the Health Secretaryship.\n\nRelated in a rather vomit-inducing way: why the forces ranged against Cameron will prove irresistible\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/local-news/bottomley-stand-down-mp-next-4857737", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nSign up to our free email newsletter for daily roundups of the biggest headlines as well as all the latest breaking news\n\nA great advocate of encouraging young people to take an interest in politics, Mrs Bottomley said this week that young blood was needed in the Conservative Party.
