In his childhood, he was no different than other children of his age, and did not exhibit unusual personality traits. Like most other residents of the town, the Ifargan family was a low-class family who originally came from Tiznit, Morocco.[10]\n\nIfargan did not undergo formal rabbinic ordination.[11] He studied in a religious Yeshiva, but dropped out at the age of 17. He spent a year studying mysticism in seclusion, in the forests of northern Israel. Then, at the age of 18 he was enlisted to the Israeli army, and served for three years as required by law. When his father died in 1995, Ifargan began spreading legends on the mystical powers of his father, which he claimed had healing powers and predicted the future. He started performing spiritual activities out of his parent's house, as well as the gravesite estate that he purchased for his father, outside of the Netivot cemetery. Ifargan started claiming that he possessed prophetic powers, by which he can see the future as well as diagnose the health problems of people. A diverse community of miracle-seeking admirers began to form around the young mystic, then 30 years old. His followers were impressed with his supposed abilities, dubbing him \"The X-ray\".[10]\n\nIn 2008, Ifergan's \"Netivot Shalom\" list won four seats in the Netivot city council elections.[12]\n\nIn 2010, Netivot's city comptroller, Shimon Alon, a confidant of a rival Netivot kabbalist, Baba Baruch, was arrested for allegedly paying a young woman to seduce Ifargan and photograph him in intimate positions, with the aim of tarnishing his image.[13]\n\nIfargan is also a rival of Netivot rabbi Yoram Abergel. In 2013, Abergel ase well as the Israeli crime boss Shalom Domrani was arrested for threatening Ifargan to support Mayor Yehiel Zohar in the Netivot municipal elections. Abergel\u2019s supporters lobbied for the reelection of Mayor Yehiel Zohar, while Ifergan supported the challenger, Eyal Mesika.[14]\n\nIfergan's aides publish \"Inyan Ba'ir\", a Netivot local newspaper, to get across the rabbi's messages and strengthen his public profile.[15]\n\nTikkun ceremonies\n\nIfargan erected a large, truncated pyramid shaped mausoleum for his father at the top of a hill, entirely covered in white marble. In this location he performs ceremonies, and most importantly, the Tikkun (reparation). The ceremonies are always opened by David Zarfati, Ifargan's master of ceremonies, who instructs the participants, who sing and clap their hands, while loud music is played. Ifargan throws thousands of candles into a bonfire, creating massive flames. Sometimes Ifargan places his hands in the fire but is not burned. Ifargan says that this is a Kabbalistic ceremony. In reality the ceremony is unique in form, and differs significantly from the traditional Kabbalistic Tikkun, which does not include a bonfire. The ceremony is preceded by prayer services and a collection of donations.[10]\n\nCriticism\n\nThe use of religion to gain profit, by Ifargan and other rabbis, drew criticism by other Jewish clerics, such as Rabbi Donniel Hartman, president of the Shalom Hartman Institute, who said \"It's disappointing when religion descends to this... It's not some channel of divine power for personal wealth accumulation. That's small religion.\"[7] Ifargan wears modern Haredi dress.[9] By doing so, Dr. Anat Feldman of the Achva Academic College, says he creates an image that he is part of the rabbinic establishment, thus gaining additional public legitimacy.[10] However, some Haredi leaders including Rabbi Ovadia Yosef and Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky have denounced Ifergan\u2019s magical practices.[16] The rabbis accused Ifergan of paganism and called him a \"fiend\", further threatening that that anyone associated with Ifergan would have no part in the next world. In 2009, a reconciliation meeting took place between Ifargan and some prominent Ashkenazi rabbis, including Aharon Leib Steinman, Haim Kanyevsky, Nissim Karelitz and Michel Yehuda Lefkowitz .[17]\n\nSee also"}, {"url": "https://factsanddetails.com/world/cat55/sub396/item1372.html", "page_content": "RABBIS\n\n\n\nRabbi Moshe Leib RabinovichOriginally theocratic, Judaism has evolved a congregational policy. The basic institution is the local synagogue, which is operated by the congregation and led by a rabbi of their choice. Rabbis (meaning \"teachers\") are regarded as learned persons, interpreters of religious doctrine, arbiters of law and custom as well as leaders of synagogues and religious activities. Each rabbi is bonded to the community he serves. Generally only men serve as rabbis.\n\nRabbis are not like priests. They have no ecclesiastical authority; services can be conducted without them and generally they are not part of a religious hierarchy. Any Jew with knowledge of prayers and laws can lead services, perform marriages or bury the dead, although rabbis usually do preside over these activities.\n\nIn ancient times, Jewish religious activity revolved around the Temple. The rituals and sacrifices held there were led by a caste of priests not rabbis. After the Temple was destroyed in A.D. 70 and Jewish people were dispersed around the world, the priestly caste was made obsolete. Judaism went through a lot of changes; it became more democratic. Religious life became centered around local synagogues instead the Temple and activities at them were run by rabbis.\n\nThe creation of Judaism was the work of rabbis who reconstructed the religion of the Jews by interpreting the Torah in a world without a Temple based on oral traditions, around families and synagogues. The written work of these rabbis formed the basis for the Mishna and the Talmud.\n\nRabbis have traditionally been more like lawyers and scholars that priests. In Israel the chief rabbis have civil authority in family law. In most other places decisions made rabbis are not legally binding or have semi-legal status.

These priests made offerings, cured the sick, and perhaps acted as judges. At the Temple they lighted incense on altars and presided over daily, weekly and animal sacrifices.\n\nThe priestly caste also butchered the meat after the animal sacrifices and had a monopoly over its distribution. By the time of Christ the priests charged people money to ritually slaughter their animals. Moneychangers at the temples helped pilgrims use the right coinage to pay for the sacrifices. After the destruction of the Temple in A.D 70 the priestly caste lost their jobs and their role in religious life was replaced by rabbis.\n\nCohanim\n\n\n\ndistribution of Y Haplogroup EM-78, the Cohanim marker \u201cCohanim\u201d are members of priestly clan that trace their paternal lineage back to the original cohen, Aaron, the brother of Moses and a high Jewish priest. Cohanim have certain duties and restrictions. According to ancient Jewish rituals the redemption of the firstborn son requires payment to a Cohen. Only the Cohanim in prayer shawls are allowed to bless suppliants at Jerusalem\u2019s Western Wall. This is an inherited duty.\n\nCynics have long wondered if such a diverse looking group of people could all be descendants of the same person, Aaron. Dr. Karl Skorecki, a Jew from a Cohan family, and geneticist Michael Hammer at the University of Arizona found genetic markers on the Y chromosome among Cohanim that appear to have been passed down through a common male ancestor for 84 to 130 generations, which goes back more than 3,000 years, roughly the time of Exodus and Aaron.\n\nThe marker is found in half of the Cohanim studied in both Ashkenazi and Sephardic communities and among Jews of European ancestry and African ancestry. Some members of the Lembaa, a South African tribe that claims to be a Lost Tribe of Israel, also have the genetic Cohan marker. The marker as also been found in some Christians that have no knowledge of any Jewish ancestry. Genetic research also found that 40 percent of Ashkenazi Jews descend from just four women.\n\nLevites are another hereditary priesthood passed from father to son. They are said to have descended from Levi, the third son of the patriarch Jacob. Levites and Cohanin were important in ancient Israel, but sometime between 200 B.C. and A.D. 500 their duties were taken over by rabbis and Jewish status became defined by maternal descent. Genetic studied of Levite show more of a mixed ancestry than that of Cohanm.\n\nRabbinic Debate and Study\n\n\n\nRabbi students at a Yeshiva The rabbinic model of study is the practice of seeking the relevance of passages from the Torah to contemporary issues. This form of study is often centered around discussion groups called \u201cmidrash\u201d (from the Hebrew root \u201cto search\u201d).\n\nRabbis and future rabbis sit before the Torah ark swaying over a volume of the Talmud and debate Talmudic interpretations.\n\nYur Foreman, a professional light middleweight boxer who is studying to be an Orthodox rabbi told the New York Times that answering the rapid-fire questions from his teacher Rabbi DovBer Pinsom was tougher than his boxing training: \u201cIt\u2019s a sharpen-your mind workout. When I go to the gym I am training my physical self. With the rabbi, I\u2019m training my spiritual muscles.\u201d\n\nSeven year cycle of Talmud study.\n\nJewish Education\n\nJews put a strong emphasis on education and piety is equated with learning. Traditionally, literacy has been universal, among males, anyway, and schooling and study of the sacred texts began at a young age. In ancient times children on their first day of school were given sweets in the shape of letters so they would associate learning things that taste good.\n\nThe education of children is considered the primary responsibility of parents. The scriptures contains many references to this duty: \u201cYou shall teach them [the commandments] diligently to your children, and you shall talk to them when you sit on your house, and when you walk by the way and when you lie down, and when you rise.\u201d\n\nFor children to grow up to be good Jews it considered essential that they learn by heart all 613 commandments in the Torah and be familiar with a variety of interpretation and opinions for each one.\n\nIn the old days boys were sent to schools to learn Hebrew, the Pentateuch, and the prayers, often by rote. Larger Jewish communities had advanced rabbinic schools, where the Talmud was taught. Girls were generally educated at home by their mothers.\n\nJewish Schools\n\n\n\nYeshiva in Belarus In the past Jewish children were taught at a school attached to the synagogue called a \u201ccheder\u201d . In Europe, many Jews attended secular schools. Western-style schools were introduced in the Middle East in the 19th century by Christian missionaries and the Alliance Israelite Universelle.\n\nYeshivas are Jewish religious high schools, which have traditionally concentrated on Talmudic study and accepted only boy students. In yeshivas boys have traditionally studied the Talmud in pairs, reading it carefully and then discussing it in Yiddish. Often the boys study little else other than religion.\n\nFor students that attend them, the Yeshiva marks the beginning of a lifetime spent studying Jewish texts. Some study Aramaic so they can read the Babylonian Talmud in the language it was written and continue their studies when they are well into their 20s. . Many students become rabbis, scribes or scholars.\n\nAt a typical ultra-Orthodox elementary school children spend five hours a day studying the Torah, which their teachers insist is all they need to know to get through life. They spend les than three hours day studying math, science, geography and nature and don\u2019t spend any time studying literature or culture.\n\nWhy Do Jewish Parents Spend So Much Money on Education\n\nJack Wertheimer wrote in Commentary Magazine: \u201cWhy do parents spend these sums of money? For the same reason so many American parents expend staggering sums on college tuition: they believe they are getting value for their dollar. Immersive Jewish education may not provide the same kind of material payoff as a college diploma, but it greatly increases the chances of children learning the skills necessary for participation in religious life, living active Jewish lives, and identifying strongly with other Jews. Day-school tuition is the cost many parents believe they must bear if their children are to retain their heritage in a society that exerts enormous assimilatory pressures. [Source: Jack Wertheimer, commentarymagazine.com, March 1, 2010 ^|^]\n\n\n\nYeshiva Limud \u201cThey are right. It takes time and considerable effort to transmit a strong identification with the Jewish religion and people; to nurture a facility in the different registers of the Hebrew language: biblical, rabbinic, and modern; to teach young Jews the classical texts of their civilization; to expose them to Jewish music, dance, and art; and to socialize them to live as Jews\u2014all the while providing a first-rate general education. Ample research has limned the association between the number of \u201ccontact hours\u201d young people spend in Jewish educational settings and their later levels of engagement. Simply put, \u201cmore\u201d makes a significant difference. It is not hard to find adult alumni of day schools, summer camps, and Israel programs who attest to the formative impact of their experiences. Not surprisingly, many parents committed to Jewish life want their children to enjoy the same benefits. ^|^\n\n\u201cFamilies recognize that they can no longer rely upon institutions that once had been central to the socialization of young Jews: most Jewish parents have neither the time nor, in many cases, the knowledge to transmit Jewish learning to their children; extended families are now widely dispersed, so they cannot play an active role; and few Jews reside any longer in densely populated Jewish neighborhoods, where in years past Jewish mores and customs were internalized through osmosis. Thus, conclude Carmel and Barry Chiswick, two authorities on the economics of Jewish life, \u201cthe formation of Jewish human capital must rely on a system of Jewish education.\u201d\u201c ^|^\n\nRabbis With Special Powers\n\nIn the ultra-Orthodox community there are holy men and faith healers. Among some Jewish groups you can find gatherings of worshipers, chanting, singing, thumping finger tambourines and lighting candles waiting to touch revered rabbis who claim to cure people of cancer and raised crippled people from their wheelchairs.\n\nMiracles have been attributed to Jewish saints, whose intensive study of the Torah gave them special powers. In the 18th century rebels known as \u201ctzaddik ha-dor\u201d emerged from Jewish mysticism that were regarded as so holy it was believed they could transport themselves to a higher plane, where God used them to bring blessings and miracles to ordinary Jews.\n\nMany ultra-Orthodox Jews believe that some rabbis have mystical powers. Rebbes are rabbis regarded as saints with special powers. They have been credited with curing cancer and making their followers wealthy by giving them shrewd investment advice. After death their grave sites become shrines. Some sects believe that rebbes have the power to see illnesses and other\u2019s misfortunes. In cases, where illnesses believed to be the will of God they can change them.\n\nMany of Lubavitchers \u2014 a Hasidic Branch of Judaism with Kabbalist roots \u2014 believe that Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who died in Brooklyn in 1994 and was the seventh and last leader of the group, was the Messiah or kind of pre-Messiah. A number of miracles have been attributed to Schneerson. In July 1992, for example, the daughter of a woman diagnosed with stomach cancer asked Schneerson for a blessing and was told to put mezuzas through her house, light Shabbis candles and perform good deeds. The mother did all things. Three days later when a biopsy was performed no cancer was found. Her doctor said, \u201cSomeone\u2019s prayers were answered.\u201d Schneerson\u2019s office receives more than 1,000 letters day requesting blessings.\n\nLubavitchers and Rabbi Schneerson\n\n\n\nRabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson Chabad-Lubavitch is a Hasidic Branch of Judaism with Kabbalist roots. Founded in Belarus in the 18th century and is now based in Brooklyn, it has 3,000 organizations in 75 countries whose goal is to prepare their host cities for the coming of the Messiah. In the meantime Chabad Houses provide religious support and community services for Jewish expats. Members of sect are active in the former Soviet Union, setting up Jewish schools, community centers and orphanages.\n\nLubavitchers are named after Lubavichy, a town near Smolensk, Russia, where the movement was based from 1813 to 1915. Many of its followers believe that Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who died in Brooklyn in 1994 and was the seventh and last leader of the group, was the Messiah or kind of pre-Messiah. Among other things Schneerson encouraged parents to put blessings such as psalms in the cribs of newborn infants.\n\nA number of miracles have been attributed to Schneerson. In July 1992, for example, the daughter of a woman diagnosed with stomach cancer asked Schneerson for a blessing and was told to put mezuzas through her house, light Shabbis candles and perform good deeds. The mother did all things. Three days later when a biopsy was performed no cancer was found. Her doctor said, \u201cSomeone\u2019s prayers were answered.\u201d Schneerson\u2019s office receives more than 1,000 letters day requesting blessings.\n\nChabad-Lubavitch stresses an inclusive approach to religion. A Chabad-Lubavitch rabbi in Tokyo told the Japanese Times, \u201cChabad is for Jews, but for non-Jews as well. We don\u2019t open solely for Jews, because God created everyone. Most of our friends are Japanese . We\u2019re not trying to covert people. God created many different nations, and they don\u2019t need to bother to change or become kosher.\n\nChabad-Lubavitch followers are called Chabadnicks, They are regarded as fundamentalists and are much more involved in missionary work, even proselyting, than has traditionally been the norm, among Jewish sects. Chabadnicks have many similar views as fundamentalist Christian and Muslims. They regard homosexuality as a sexual perversion and are anti-abortion. In Israel they support the right-wing Greater Israel party. One of its leaders Rabbi Eliiezer Shach has described Chabad-Lubavitch as the sect closest to true Judaism.\n\n\"X-Ray\" Rabbi Yaakov Israel Ifargan\n\nIn 2002, Time magazine Jerusalem bureau chief Matt Rees went to Netivot in the southern of Israel to check out Rabbi Yaakov Israel Ifargan, who is known to all in Israel by his nickname, Rav ha-Rentgen (the X-Ray) Rabbi. There they observed Rabbi Ifargan perform his special, characteristic \u201cTikkun\u201d ceremony at the foot of the grave of his father, the late Rabbi Shalom Ifargan. During the ceremony, he throws thousands of packages of candles into a bonfire while praying to the righteous dead and to the Holy One, Blessed be He.\n\nRentgen.co reported: \u201c His special qualities are many but the most unique of all, the one which led to the bestowal of the name \u201cX-ray,\u201d is his ability to see and precisely diagnose things. Simply casting an eye on someone enables him to discern everything: the state of his health, his soul, and his business as well as his mission in life. As written in The Marker, \u201cOf all of the rabbis who offer spiritual advice and guidance to Israel\u2019s business people, this year Rabbi Ifargan stands out. The rabbi, who specializes in matters of health and consultation, is known by the nickname the X-ray. People who have consulted with him tell that the rabbi provided them with such a precise diagnosis that many were impressed and adopted him as their rabbi and as the first person with whom they would consult in every aspect of their lives. [Source: rentgen.co.il +]\n\n\u201cIt appears Rabbi Ifargan was born to his spiritual role as an advisor and savior to thousands of Jewish people, ever since his birth to his parents, Rebbetzin Esther and Rabbi Shalom Ifargan of blessed memory. Rabbi Shalom was a well-known mystical figure in the south of Israel as well as in the yeshivas of Bnei Brak, Safed and Jerusalem. He was also the one thousands of people turned to in times of trouble, asking for his blessing. He was known to be a friend of Rabbi Yisrael Abuhatzeira, the Baba Sali of blessed memory, and the tales of his miracles spread throughout the country. +\\\n\n\u201cRabbi Yaakov Ifargan studied in the Ashkenazi Haredi yeshivas of Bnei Brak, and later in a Sephardic Haredi yeshiva in Jerusalem, but mainly he studied with his father, who taught him the secrets of the Kabbala and with him delved deeply into the Zohar. In 1994, while he sat shiva for his righteous father, a visitor entered the house and Rabbi Ifargan discerned a severe form of cancer in the man\u2019s kidneys. He called to the man and revealed what he had seen. From that moment word got out that Rabbi Ifargan would follow in the path of his father. +\\\n\n\u201cSince then, the court of Rabbi Ifargan has become a huge empire including yeshiva students who study Torah, nursery schools and Talmud Torah schools which provide a education to children in the south and center of the country, and benevolence centers that aid thousands of families in distress, providing them with food products, hot meals, and basic supplies. Over the years, the name of Rabbi Ifargan has become very well-known, particularly among the community of business people in Israel, as the principal personal advisor of the tycoons in the world of Israeli business. One of the most notable of these is Nochi Dankner, the chairman of the board of IDB Israel, and other leaders in the Israeli economy. In 2003 the economics magazine The Marker crowned Rabbi Ifargan with the title \u201cSpiritual Advisor of the Year,\u201d and named him one of the one hundred most influential people in the Israeli economy. +\\\n\n\u201cAlong with that, the thing that most characterizes the personality of Rabbi Ifargan is his great love for the Jewish people, his ability to find and devote time to each and every one of the thousands who come to him in Netivot, dedicating to them some of his time and his marvelous abilities. Many people come from the south and the center of Israel, but there are also those who arrive from far-away Safed in the north and even from abroad: the United States, France, Canada and South America. Rabbi Ifargan welcomes them all warmly, with patience and great love. +\\\n\n\u201cIn 2008, Rabbi Ifargan, seeing the extreme distress of under privileged people in Israel's periphery, established Yad Yehudit. Yad Yehudit, (Hand of Yehudit), is a non-profit organization that creates a safety net for vulnerable families and individuals and gives them hope for a better future. Yad Yehudit, with the assistance of dedicated volunteers, provides comprehensive assistance to families in distress that includes: weekly food packages, holiday food baskets, small appliances, essential medications not covered by medical insurance, immediate assistance in cases of household emergencies, pediatric dental care and mentoring for at-risk youth.\u201d +\\\n\n\u201cFlying\u201d Rabbis Fight Swine Flu\n\nIn 2009, a group of rabbis and Jewish mystics has taken to the skies over Israel, praying and blowing ceremonial horns in a plane to ward off swine flu. The BBC reported: \u201cAbout 50 religious leaders circled over the country on Monday, chanting prayers and blowing horns, called shofars. The flight's aim was \"to stop the pandemic so people will stop dying from it\", Rabbi Yitzhak Batzri was quoted as saying in Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper. The flu is often called simply \"H1N1\" in Israel, as pigs are seen as unclean. Eating pork is banned under Jewish dietary laws. [Source: BBC, August 12, 2009]\n\nAccording to Israel's health ministry, there have been more than 2,000 cases of swine flu in the country, with five fatalities so far. \"We are certain that, thanks to the prayer, the danger is already behind us,\" added Mr Batzri was quoted as saying. Television footage showed rabbis in black hats rocking backwards and forwards as they read prayers from Kabbalah, a form of Jewish mysticism which counts the singer Madonna among its devotees.The shofar is the horn of a ram, and is used to mark major religious occasions in Judaism.\n\nRabbi Yitzhak Kaduri: the Right-Wing Mystic\n\nRabbi Yitzhak Kaduri was a controversial Jewish mystic who began his career sending curses and finished it off deciding elections for right-wing Israeli politicians. Lawrence Joffe wrote in The Guardian, \u201cFew people wait almost a century before joining the political fray, yet the Israeli rabbi and mystic Yitzhak Kaduri, who died at an estimated age of 106, did precisely that. In May 1996 he probably swung the crucial balance of 29,000 voters who ensured that the Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu was elected prime minister of Israel. He did so by distributing thousands of \"magic\" amulets to his devotees, who were then obliged to vote for Netanyahu in the prime ministerial poll and for the Orthodox Shas party in the simultaneous party elections. Kaduri also bolstered Netanyahu's platform of \"restoring Jewish values\" by publicly endorsing him before polling day. [Source: Lawrence Joffe, The Guardian, January 31, 2006 ~~]\n\n\u201cSmall, bent and wizened, invariably draped in the white robes of an oriental Jewish kabbalist (or purveyor of Jewish mysticism), Kaduri was little known in political circles until May 1996. But images of his benignly smiling face, which dangled from the rear-view mirrors of taxis scuttling between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, indicated his popularity. ~~\n\nRabbi Kaduri was born around 1900 in Iraq and went to Jerusalem early in the 20th century. He lived in a poor neighbourhood, attended Porat Yosef yeshiva (or rabbinical seminary) and, around 1930, transferred to Beit El (House of God) yeshiva, a centre for studying the mystical tradition in Judaism. ~~\n\nKaduri had many enemies and critics. The liberal daily, Ha'aretz, sardonically named him Man of the Year in 1998. Former Sephardi chief rabbi Ovadiah Yosef questioned his credentials, highlighting the fact that Kaduri had never written a single religious article, let alone a book. Kaduri, in turn, criticised show-business and other celebrities who claimed to have taken up Judaism's mystical tradition. When Madonna made a midnight visit to the grave of a sage while visiting Israel in 2004, he asserted: \"It is forbidden to teach Kabbalah to a non-Jew.\"\n\nRabbi Kaduri died in January 2006, An estimated 200,000 people filled the streets of Jerusalem for his funeral. In 2000, Kaduri spoke of a vision in which heaven blessed a little known Israeli presidential candidate, Moshe Katsav. As a result all 17 Shas MPs voted for Katsav, defeating the favourite, Shimon Peres.\n\nRabbi Kaduri, the Fortuneteller and Curse Sender\n\nLawrence Joffe wrote in The Guardian, By 1933 Kaduri had his own consulting rooms in the Old City, where he taught clients how to predict the future by divining secret texts hidden in the Psalms, or how to summon angels to help overcome personal problems. He refused money for these services, and worked as a bookbinder to keep body and soul together. The Jerusalem writer Haim Be'er recalled: \"His appearance was striking; he radiated a great deal of human warmth. [Whenever he] passed by, people would whisper, 'There goes a truly righteous individual.'\" [Source: Lawrence Joffe, The Guardian, January 31, 2006 ~~]\n\n\u201cIf dispensing blessings was one of Kaduri's stocks-in-trade, so was sending curses. In 1991 he sought out the name of Saddam Hussein's mother, so that he could send efficacious pulsa denura - Aramaic for \"lashings of fire\" - against this enemy of the Jews. Kaduri was also implicated in the death curse on Yitzhak Rabin, which was eerily pronounced just a month before the Labour premier's assassination in November 1995. Although he was never proved to be a signatory, in the eyes of secular detractors guilt by association was good enough. ~~\n\n\u201cConventionally Orthodox Jews, too, lampooned Kaduri's folk customs as foolish and alien to normative Judaism. They enjoyed pointing out that his supposedly divine amulets were marked \"Made in Taiwan\". To David Levy, Israel's Moroccan-born former foreign minister, the Kaduri roadshow was \"surrealistic\", an abuse of innocent faith which was \"dragging us back to the dark ages [and] leading us towards an abyss, blindness and near civil war\". Even fellow mystics, like \"Baba Baruch\" Abu-Hatzeira, criticised those who \"have turned Rabbi Kaduri into a circus, just to make money\". ~~\n\n\u201cShas politicians exploited his reputation, while others literally cashed in on his name. Kaduri was once delivered by helicopter to bless a sausage factory in a development town. Aparatchiks then collected monetary pledges from townsfolk who believed they could purchase heaven's favour via this holy conduit.\u201d ~~\n\nRabbi Kaduri\u2019s Political Career\n\nLawrence Joffe wrote in The Guardian, Once Rabbi Kaduri \u201cacquired a taste for politics, it seemed he could not stop. He was soon urging more building at Har Homa, a controversial development south of Jerusalem and something of a rightwing cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. He also initiated bold personal bids for peace with Israel's arch-enemies, Syria and Iran. At one point he suggested trading the Golan Heights for an accord with Damascus - to the chagrin of Likud and Labour alike - though he subsequently changed his mind and ruled out returning the territory. [Source: Lawrence Joffe, The Guardian, January 31, 2006 ~~]\n\n\u201cParticularly embarrassing for Israel's secular right was the incident in October 1997 when Netanyahu whispered to Kaduri that leftwing Israelis had \"forgotten what it means to be Jewish\" and were willing to \"place our security in Arab hands\" - not realising that the television cameras were still rolling at the time. In fairness, Kaduri never asked to be Netanyahu's confidant. Many, in fact, saw the sage as a senile victim of mischievous cohorts - especially his grandson Yossi Kaduri. ~~\n\n\u201cSo what transformed the humble saint into a political potentate? The answer partly lies in Israel's recent social changes. Sephardi Jews who came to Israel from the Middle East and north Africa felt ostracised by the secular, socialist establishment. Many expressed their defiance by backing the opposition Likud. Others took solace in traditional modes of worship, such as Kaduri's. ~~\n\n\u201cIn March 1997, Kaduri intoned over Netanyahu i: \"May the Almighty keep and protect the prime minister; may he live long, defeat all his enemies and win the next elections.\" Clearly in a generous mood, he got a party of Israeli Arabs to convey goodwill messages to the then Syrian president, Hafez al-Asad. In September 1997 he blessed Asad - albeit by letter - invited him to visit Jerusalem and called for \"a historic reconciliation between our two peoples\". Three months later, a similar Kaduri missive was dispatched to Iran's Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Apparently peeved by the treatment of his once-imprisoned protege and former Shas leader, Aryeh Deri, Kaduri's family conjured up a new party, Ahavat Yisrael (Love of Israel), but it returned no seats in the 2003 elections.\u201d\n\nRabbi Ovadia Yosef: Leader of Sephardic Jews and Ultra-Orthodox Shas Party\n\nRabbi Ovadia Yosef was the chief rabbi of Israel's Sephardic Jewish community and spiritual head of the ultra-orthodox Shas party.Lawrence Joffe wrote in The Guardian: \u201cResplendent in his gold brocaded black gowns and purple turbans, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef,\u201d who died at the age of 93 in 2013, \u201coften resembled a medieval stranger marooned in the modern world. In fact, he was one of Israel's most astute public operators. As spiritual head of the ultra-orthodox Shas party, Yosef influenced the course of Israeli politics. And as former chief rabbi to Israel's Sephardim and Mizrachim \u2013 Jews of Iberian, North African and Middle Eastern origin \u2013 he rekindled a sense of communal pride not experienced for centuries. [Source: Lawrence Joffe, The Guardian, October 7, 2013 |+|]\n\n\u201cYosef applied ancient laws to contemporary circumstances. Often he would study until 3am in his booklined three-room flat. Every Sabbath hundreds flocked to a modest Bukharan synagogue in Jerusalem \u2013 the Bukharan Jewish community came from central Asia \u2013 to hear sermons which were beamed around the world by internet. A spokesman for the downtrodden and a champion of faith, or a bigoted autocrat who undermined democracy, and whose political dalliances sullied his religious purity? At least Yosef silenced orthodox Ashkenazim who once had lampooned him and his community. |+|\n\n\u201cYet Yosef was also an enigmatic man whose austere public face hid his private charm. He adopted progressive stances which few Israeli rabbis favoured \u2013 such as accepting the Jewish status of Ethiopian Beta Israel, or \"Falashas\", in the 1970s, championing peace with the Palestinians in the 1980s and sanctioning organ donations in the 1990s. |+|\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, he often took abstruse, even offensive positions. He lambasted Reform Jews as \"destroyers of religion\"; claimed that Jewish law forbade men to walk between women; and told President Bill Clinton to \"kiss our feet\". In 1999 he repudiated the supreme court after his protege, Aryeh Deri, was jailed for accepting bribes. In 2000 he called Holocaust victims \"reincarnated souls of sinners\"; later he likened Palestinian and Arab foes to snakes and vipers. In 2010 he said gentiles should serve Jews, he once called Binyamin Netanyahu a \"blind she-goat\" and this year he dubbed a religious Zionist party as a \"home for goyim [non-Jews]\".\u201d |+|\n\nRabbi Ovadia Yosef, 93, wielded enormous influence among Israeli Jews of Middle Eastern and North African ancestry but courted controversy with his outspoken views. In 2001, Yosef had called for \"Arabs' annihilation\u201d: \"It is forbidden to be merciful to them. You must send missiles to them and annihilate them. They are evil and damnable.\" In 2010, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was calling for peace talks to bring enduring peace to the Middle East, Rabbi Yosef denounced the move, saying the Palestinians and their leader were \"an evil and bitter enemies of Israel\" who should \"perish from this world.\" The rabbi was quoted as saying during his weekly sermon at a synagogue near his Jerusalem home: \"Abu Mazen (nom de guerre for Abbas) and all these evil people should perish from this world...God should strike them with a plague.\u201d [Source: PTI, August 29, 2010]\n\nRabbi Ovadia Yosef\u2019s Life and Family\n\nYosef was born Abdullah Youssef in Baghdad, Iraq. Lawrence Joffe wrote in The Guardian: \u201cAt four he arrived in British Mandatory Palestine with his parents, Yaakov and Georgia. In Jerusalem he enrolled at Porat Yosef Yeshiva, the leading rabbinical Sephardi seminary. While poverty forced him to study by moonlight, at 18 he wrote the first of his more than 30 books. Ordained a rabbi at 20 and made a religious court judge at 25, in 1944 he married Margalit Fattal, who came from Aleppo, in Syria. [Source: Lawrence Joffe, The Guardian, October 7, 2013 |+|]\n\n\u201cThree years later Yosef was appointed chief rabbi of Cairo, just as tensions in Palestine undermined the security of Egypt's Jewish community. He nonetheless defended Jews' right to statehood. His affection for Egypt was reciprocated 50 years later when Hosni Mubarak afforded him a near-royal reception as Israel's emissary for peace. |+|\n\n\u201cYosef returned to an independent Israel in 1950. In 1968 he became chief rabbi of Tel Aviv, a hedonistic city which the more pious considered little better than Sodom and Gomorrah. Yosef was known for generally lenient rulings when he was Israel's chief Sephardi rabbi, from 1973 to 1983. In 1974, for instance, he allowed around 1,000 women whose husbands remained missing in action after the 1973 Yom Kippur war to remarry.\u201d |+|\n\nOvadia Yosef was born on September 23, 1920 and died on October 6, 2013, His wife Margalit died in 1994; Yosef is survived by 10 of his 11 children. Each of his 11 children either became a rabbi or married one. His eldest daughter, Adina Bar-Shalom, established the Haredi College of Jerusalem. Above all, Yosef reminded Israel's Sephardi Jews (to quote a Shas slogan) that they came from \"generations of sages, not criminals\". |+|\n\nRabbi Ovadia Yosef\u2019s Political Life\n\nLawrence Joffe wrote in The Guardian: \u201cIt was as spiritual mentor of Shas \u2013 an acronym for \"Sephardi Torah Guardians\" \u2013 that he truly made his mark. The party began as a municipal list in Jerusalem in 1983. Then Yosef dictated its policies and handpicked its prospective Knesset members, including the 25-year-old Deri, a rabbi and friend of his son, David. Soon Shas blossomed into a national political force that fused religious zeal with an ability to articulate Sephardi grievances. For despite constituting half the population, Sephardim still felt that both Israel's secular establishment and Ashkenazi-run orthodox parties treated them like second-class citizens. [Source: Lawrence Joffe, The Guardian, October 7, 2013 |+|]\n\n\u201cYosef wooed the less observant. He preached in cinemas, stressed a compassionate social agenda and created a network of 1,800 Shas-run schools and welfare centres in poor neighbourhoods. Yet a generation of Sephardi religion students - including most Shas politicians - still owed primary loyalty to a nonagenarian Lithuanian-born Ashkenazi sage, Rabbi Eliezer Schach. |+|\n\n\u201cIn August 1989 Yosef ruled that Israel should relinquish parts of the biblical \"Land of Israel\" (located in Palestinian territories), if that could prevent bloodshed and bring lasting peace. Religious settlers immediately attacked his ruling. Undaunted, Yosef and Deri visited Egypt in 1990 to discuss initiatives with Mubarak. In March that year, Yosef ordered Deri to leave the Likud-Labour coalition government, and join a pro-peace Labour alliance led by Shimon Peres. But Schach countermanded Yosef, corralled Shas back into government, and gave a two-year lease of life to the ailing Likud. Yosef displaced Schach as party guru on the eve of the June 1992 elections. Shas's subsequent entry into Yitzhak Rabin's coalition government seemed like a \"dream ticket\", combining Shas piety with Labour pragmatism. |+|\n\n\u201cReality, however, proved different. Shas clashed over education policy with another coalition partner, the secular Meretz party. Investigations into Shas corruption fuelled Sephardi suspicions about prejudice in Israel's establishment. In September 1993 Shas left the government on the day that Israel signed the historic accords with the PLO. In opposition, Yosef avoided the vilification of Rabin that indirectly led to the latter's assassination in November 1995. However, he failed to get Shas to endorse Rabin's successor, Peres, as presidential candidate. Instead most voted for Netanyahu, who went on to win the May 1996 elections. Despite that, Shas gained 10 seats and Yosef persuaded Netanyahu to grant it two key ministries, interior and labour. He offered to meet Yasser Arafat personally, when Netanyahu refused to do so. His dialogue with Palestinian police chief Nasser Yusuf arguably saved lives on both sides. In 1997 Yosef invoked the Talmud to condemn Israeli zealots who usurped Arab property in east Jerusalem. And he threatened to sabotage the government if Netanyahu did not redeploy troops from the occupied territories, as promised in the Oslo agreement. |+|\n\n\u201cHowever, in late 1997 Yosef's dithering nearly sank plans to withdraw Israeli troops from Hebron. In 1998 he opposed reform Jewish converts becoming Israelis. In 1999 he proposed packing the supreme court with rabbis and condemned Russian immigrants as \"whores and crypto-Christians\". Israel's media called it a descent into lunacy. Despite having suffered a heart attack, Yosef was helicoptered to mass rallies across Israel, his face adorned Shas posters and he even won votes from Israeli Arabs, grateful for Shas's ministerial largesse. In 1999 Shas increased its tally of Knesset seats to 17, two short of Likud itself. |+|\n\nRabbi Yosef: the Kingmaker\n\nAFP reported: \u201cYosef had frequently played the role of kingmaker Yosef, a former Sephardic chief rabbi of Israel whose son took over the same role in June 2013, had frequently played the role of kingmaker in the country's fickle coalition politics. He was spiritual leader also of ultra-Orthodox party Shas, which was a member of most ruling coalitions before going into opposition after January 2012 elections. Yosef founded Shas in 1984 on the platform of a return to religion and as a counter to an establishment dominated by Ashkenazi Jews of European ancestry. [Source: AFP, October 8, 2013 ^*^]\n\n\u201cThe Baghdad-born rabbi frequently courted controversy with his outspoken remarks, describing Palestinians and other Arabs as \"snakes\" and \"vipers\" who were \"swarming like ants\". He called on God to strike down then prime minister Ariel Sharon over Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza, and during the 2006 war in Lebanon, he implied Israeli soldiers killed in battle died because they did not follow Jewish commandments. ^*^\n\n\u201cDespite his outbursts, Yosef had for many years advocated peace talks with the Palestinians based on his respect for the sanctity of life, said the Jerusalem Post's Jeremy Sharon. \"Yosef was of the opinion that if a peace process could be conducted with Palestinians and save lives, then territorial compromises could be considered,\" he said. But following the failure of the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords, Yosef shifted politically to the right. ^*^\n\nLawrence Joffe wrote in The Guardian: \u201cYosef increasingly veered to the right, as did Shas under the political stewardship of Eli Yishai, which left a Labour-led government in 2000. The rabbi opposed Ariel Sharon's disengagement from Gaza in 2005. That year Israel arrested three Palestinian militants for planning to assassinate Yosef. Nonetheless, he part-inspired the 2011 social protests in Israel. Despite months in hospital, he ensured that one son, Yitzhak, was appointed chief rabbi in June 2013, and apparently thwarted the outgoing chief rabbi, Shlomo Amar, from succeeding him in his guiding role with Shas. The party lost seats in this year's elections and for the first time other rabbis openly criticised the ailing Yosef.\u201d |+|\n\nOver 700,000 Attend Rabbi Yosef\u2019s Funeral\n\nIn October 2013, more than 700,000 people took the streets of Jerusalem to mourn Rabbi Ovadia Yosef\u2019s death . It was the spiritual leader of Israel's Sephardic Jews, It was an unprecedented procession and expression of grief. AFP reported: \u201cThe mourners, mostly ultra-Orthodox Jews and with men separated from women, gathered outside Yosef's seminary, before heading to his burial in Jerusalem's conservative Sanhedria district. \"We estimate there are more [than] 700,000 people taking part in the largest of funerals ever in Israel,\" police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld wrote on Twitter. Officially, there are currently slightly over six million Jews in Israel, meaning more than one in every 10 was at the funeral. [Source: AFP, October 8, 2013]\n\n\u201cPolice deployed in their thousands, blocking off some of the Holy City's roads. Emergency services said the overcrowding injured some 300 people. \"We've lost a father,\" Eliel Hawzi, a 26-year-old in the middle of his military service, said. \"Rabbi Yosef is irreplaceable for the Jewish people.\u201d \u201cI've been crying since I heard the news,\" said Aviel Mor, a 24-year-old yeshiva religious seminary student, who like hundreds of others tore the lapel of his shirt in the Jewish tradition of mourning for immediate family members.\n\n\u201cHis death sparked an outpouring of emotion within the Sephardi community. \"You abandoned us in the most difficult time for the religious world, and we don't know where to turn, who will guide us, who will show us the way?\" Shas leader Arye Deri asked at the funeral. \u201cNews of his deteriorating health prompted Israeli president Shimon Peres to cut short a working meeting with his Czech counterpart Milos Zeman and rush to the rabbi's bedside, his office said. Mr Peres later delivered a eulogy for \"my teacher, my rabbi, my friend\". \"I held his hand which was still warm and kissed his forehead. When I pressed his hand I felt I was touching history and when I kissed his head it was as though I kissed the very greatness of Israel,\" he said of his earlier meeting with the rabbi.\u201d\n\nSages' Tombs Attract Miracle-Seekers\n\nReporting from Netivot, Israel, Tia Goldenberg of Associated Press wrote: \u201cMorroccan-born Abuhatzeira was revered even in life as a mystic and performer of miracles. After he died in January 1984, he gained rock star-like fandom. Today, his tomb in the blue-collar town of Netivot in southern Israel draws an estimated hundreds of thousands of pilgrims. The anniversary of his death is especially popular, a time that is believed to grant the worshipper a heightened closeness to God. It's the second-most visited tomb in Israel, after that of Yonatan ben Uziel in northern Israel. That site, which reportedly draws half a million people a year, is believed to answer prayers for marriage. At the Baba Sali compound, believers of all stripes could be seen during the recent anniversary commemorations. [Source: Tia Goldenberg, Associated Press, Feb. 21, 2012 **]\n\n\n\nGrand Rabbis \u201cAlthough the burial place of modern rabbis like Abuhatzeira are not questioned, those of more ancient sages are not always investigated or recognized by any official body, meaning anyone can theoretically designate a place as holy and spark a following. A site near the central town of Modiin is believed by some to be the tomb of the Jewish priest Matityahu ben Yohanan, one of the heroes of the Hasmonean Revolt against the Greeks more than 2,000 years ago. While not officially recognized, the site draws hundreds of pilgrims a year. Similarly, a tomb in a Jerusalem mosque is sacred to Jews, Muslims and Christians, yet each claims a different holy woman is buried there. **\n\n\u201cResearchers believe the grave of the prophet Havakuk in northern Israel was possibly deemed to be there because the prophet's name rhymed with a nearby village, Yakuk. It's unclear how the phenomenon took root. Traditionally in Judaism, prostrating oneself at graves was forbidden, as it was likened to the prohibited custom of idol worship. Some studies believe that after Israel gained independence in 1948, many important Jewish sites beyond Israel's boundaries were out of reach. Jews in turn assigned greater importance to less significant sites inside Israel or co-opted what was known to be, until then, an Ottoman or Muslim tomb. **\n\n\u201cOver time, myths surrounding the different graves emerged, and Jews began making pilgrimages to these sites. The custom is practiced at tombs of Jewish sages around the world as well, including a massive yearly pilgrimage to Ukraine. Many are nondescript tombstones while some are grand domed mausoleums. Each sage is typically associated with different requests, whether for health, wealth, love or fertility. **\n\n\u201cMore than 100 such sites are considered official holy places by Israel's Tourism Ministry, meaning they are maintained with government funds. New sites are rarely added to the ministry's list because they \"lack proof\" that anyone of importance is interred there, said Mina Genem, a ministry official. Nonetheless, these tombs attract Jews from all backgrounds who return year after year because they say their prayers have been answered. Sarah Cohen, 69, said her daughter became pregnant after she prayed for her at the Baba Sali's tomb. \"I've been coming here for 20 years,\" she said, after flinging a candle into the red furnace. \"My daughter came too because she saw that my prayers were answered.\" **\n\nIsraelis Flock to Sages' Tombs Seeking Miracles\n\nReporting from Netivot, Israel, Tia Goldenberg of Associated Press wrote: \u201cOne man prays to heal the legs he broke in a car accident. An older woman pleads for grandchildren. Another visitor has come to see \"God's secretary.\" These believers are part of a growing phenomenon in Israel, where hundreds of thousands of people from starkly different backgrounds flock to the tombs of ancient Biblical figures or modern-day rabbis, seeking blessings and claiming they've witnessed miracles. [Source: Tia Goldenberg, Associated Press, Feb. 21, 2012 **]\n\n\u201cAt many of these sites there is scant proof that any sage is actually buried there. Some are even believed to be co-opted Ottoman or Muslim burial places. But to the faithful, the lack of hard evidence is irrelevant. It's the deep spiritual experience or, for some, the desperate desire to be blessed, that matters. \"Coming here is being able to speak to God's secretary. It's the closest you can get,\" said Suzy Shaked, a 55-year-old teacher from central Israel who visited the tomb of Rabbi Yisrael Abuhatzeira, one of the most popular pilgrimage sites. **\n\n\u201cShaked said she sees Abuhatzeira, better known as the Baba Sali, as God's envoy. A visit to his tomb puts her requests in God's earshot. She was praying at the Baba Sali's tomb for her son to marry. While there are no firm statistics on how many Israelis visit sites like the Baba Sali's tomb, researchers say the number is growing. They cite the rising power of religious political parties, the influence of Israelis of north African descent who traditionally practiced these kinds of pilgrimages, and a growing desire by even secular Jews to find meaning in their lives through a spiritual act. Prominent businessmen and politicians are known to make appearances at the sites. \"It's hard for (people) to be satisfied with prayer in a synagogue to a God who is very abstract, who is unclear, who is not accessible,\" said Doron Bar, a historical geographer who studies the sites. \"I think visiting a grave like this gives believers a line through which demands can be made.\" **\n\n\u201cBar believes that the number of pilgrimage sites has grown into the hundreds. The phenomenon has spawned a tourist trade, where busloads of faithful are ferried from one burial site to another to make a variety of wishes. \"People see results,\" said Benny Barzilai, who runs monthly trips to tombs. \"That's why this tour succeeds.\" At the Baba Sali compound, believers of all stripes could be seen during the recent anniversary commemorations\u2014 mildly religious young women in tight jeans and red nails, pious elderly women in long floral skirts and head coverings, silver-haired politicians in pinstriped suits. The tomb was packed with a mass of wailing worshippers, which swelled gradually into the evening.\n\nThe day was joyful and festive, with barbecues, picnics and vendors selling candles and clocks bearing the Baba Sali's image. The faithful hurled candles into a large furnace, a ritual with pagan tinges meant to immortalize the sage's soul. \"I take advantage of any opportunity to go see a sage,\" said Shimon Kaslessi, a truck driver, who walks with crutches but was told he likely wouldn't walk at all after a car crash two years ago. \"When you've seen miracles, when the sage makes a handicapped person walk, you believe,\" he added, a tear streaming down his face.\u201d\n\nImage Sources: Wikimedia, Commons except last picture, Times of Israel\n\nText Sources: Internet Jewish History Sourcebook sourcebooks.fordham.edu \u201cWorld Religions\u201d edited by Geoffrey Parrinder (Facts on File Publications, New York); \u201c Encyclopedia of the World\u2019s Religions\u201d edited by R.C.

I clearly remember taking the film to be developed and printed and how I would sift through them arranging them in small albums. I occasionally stumble across them at my mother\u2019s house.\n\nTo be honest, it was never a serious hobby when I was growing up, just something fun to do. In those years I was much more interested in fiction and books. We were a family of keen readers, this was no coincidence as my father was a writer and a journalist and my mother was an English teacher, so our apartment was packed with books, newspapers and magazines from floor to ceiling. Naturally I tried my hand at writing, but in my early 20\u2019s after trying to write a novel, which wasn\u2019t as good as I\u2019d hoped it would be, I understood that I wasn\u2019t that good at it and decided to stop my literary attempts.\n\nI guess I didn\u2019t completely give up on the idea of being a storyteller, because after a while I found myself developing a \u201cnew\u201d interest: photography. I started with no serious aspirations, just out of curiosity and a wish to record things I saw. After a year of trying to learn photography by myself I decided to take a black and white course, the person who was running the place and was there all day, saw that I was serious and decided that I was able to grasp more than the basics, so I stayed on after hours, learning how to print.\n\nAt that point I was already hooked, I still wasn\u2019t sure I would take it up seriously, but I decided I wanted to learn more, so I enrolled in first year photography studies at a small photography school in Jerusalem. In the middle of the first year I decided I was serious enough about photography to apply to the photography BFA course at the Bezalel academy of art, the rest is history \u2026\n\nPP: Please describe your creative process, beginning with how you decide where to start shooting, and ending with how you decide a piece is finished.\n\nYI: I find that I am very interested in social and political issues that are connected to my life and most of my work revolves around these topics. I\u2019m always thinking of new ideas for projects and I write them down in a notebook, the ideas that keep resurfacing are the ones I usually end up doing.\n\nA bit about the way I work: I\u2019m constantly thinking about many things related to my photographic work, but when I\u2019m out exploring and photographing I focus on enjoying the adventure of discovery and enjoying the fact that I don\u2019t know what will come next. After developing the film I take a quick look at the negatives on a light table before storing them away in a box.\n\nThe last stage of my process is editing, I usually do this during the summer. July will roll around and I will take all the boxes of images and start organizing them by project and topic, that is when my ideas about what it is I actually have been doing crystallize and sometimes new ideas are instigated from within the work itself.\n\nPP: What type of equipment do you most enjoy working with?\n\nYI: 8\u00d710 and 4\u00d75 inch cameras, because they help generate a photographic moment, they force me to work slowly and accurately plus the financial restrictions keep me very focused.\n\nPP: What photographers working today have influenced you the most?\n\nYI: Well, my influences are many and many are not contemporary\u2026 or photo related. I find literature the main source of inspiration, but also cinema and life in general.\n\nWhen I started out in photography I was influenced by many amazing photographers and as I changed so did my influences. The more time goes by, the more I feel that the external world is my main source of inspiration and that I\u2019m less influenced by other artists. I feel that there is a kind of velocity or energy that is self-generated by my work and self-contained in my work.\n\nTo answer your question directly I will list a few examples of contemporary photographers that I find interesting, compelling and thought evoking: David Goldblatt for his social awareness and dedication; Robert Adams for his respect for the past and hopes for the future; Robert Frank for his epic journey of the Americans; Henry Wessel for his love of light and poems of everyday life, Stephen Shore for the portraying of the ordinary; Joel Sternfeld for his Wanderlust and Alec Soth for keeping the road trip alive.\n\nSome of these photographers are so well-known that they are already clich\u00e9s, but they all are interesting photographers that changed the way we see and work within the medium. Some of my recent discoveries of photographers of my generation are Tobias Zielony, Qingjun Huang and Greg Miller.\n\nPP: Let\u2019s talk a bit about your project, \u201cThe Quest for the Man on the White Donkey.\u201d How did this project come about?\n\nYI: Fresh out of art school in 2002 I was not sure how to get started, so I decided it would be best to stop thinking about starting and just jump into a new project. My first serious project was about the neighborhoods of South West Jerusalem, a relatively small geographical area that I knew very well, as I had grown up there and live there today.\n\nFollowing this experience I wanted to try and work on a larger geographical area, pursuing my interests in the social and political aspects of everyday life and this lead me to the starting point of my photographic journey and my \u201cQuest\u201d.\n\nMy idea was to get to know my country by car. Growing up we never owned a car and I was always envious of my friends who had this freedom. Come Saturday they used to jump in to the car and drive away to picnics, barbecues or camps, while I most stayed home yearning for an adventure. Very quickly I realized that the idea of an extensive geographical journey, in the tradition of the American journeys, which was the blueprint of my project, wasn\u2019t going to work, because Israel was just too small. After driving through the same places again and again I redefined my geographical journey as an in-depth personal one.\n\nPP: Who is the man on the white donkey? What does he represent?\n\nYI: I was working on this project for a few years before I came up with the name. I was trying to find a name that would convey my ideas, but couldn\u2019t come up with anything satisfactory.\n\nOne day I was working near the Dead Sea when a Palestinian man on a white donkey rode out of the heat waves towards me and stopped to have his portrait taken before fading into the landscape. Making this image took very long as the donkey was constantly moving and I was focusing and re-focusing, sure that none of the images would come out sharp. To my surprise all three plates came out sharp and this got me thinking: about the strange encounter that reflected simultaneously on our time and the biblical myth of the Jewish messiah, who is supposed to arrive dressed in white and riding on a white donkey.\n\nIn the next few days I thought about modern-day manifestations of religious stories (Christian, Islamic and Jewish). This was the turning point for this project and from that moment on I started looking, not only for the social and political but also for aspects of religious stories that could surface in everyday life. This understanding generated the name of the journey: \u2018The Quest for the Man on the White Donkey\u2019, which simultaneously represents the type of journey I had undertaken and the fact that my work is rooted in the idea of observing reality while searching for that elusive invisible layer, maybe nonexistent, and placing it within reach of reality.\n\nPP: It seems that this project was a lot about the act of exploration and discovery. Do you have any stories that happened during the making of it you would like to share?\n\nYI: Every image that found its way into the final edit of this body of work is backed by a lucky turn of events. The images that I like most are the images I was given, not the images I have taken. So many things have to come together for a good image to be captured that it really is quite amazing when it actually happens.\n\nExploration and discovery is what gets me out of bed and into the world and what I love most about photography. There are as many stories as there are images. I do occasionally tell some of these \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d, but mostly I prefer to leave them up to the viewer\u2019s imagination and interpretation.\n\nPP: What\u2019s the key to making a great portrait? What about a great landscape?\n\nYI: I don\u2019t believe there is a formula to follow. For me achieving a great portrait has been rooted in my ability to figure out the core of my interest and to deal with it in my work. I built a system that is the basis for all my image making. I try to work freely within this frame of mind, to avoid repeating myself. This is something that I always think about. I believe that if you listen to your subject it will tell you how to portray it.\n\nPP: Many photographers have regrets about a particular moment that they weren\u2019t able to capture, whether due to timing, equipment failure, or some other factor. Might you have a story about \u201cthe one that got away?\u201d\n\nYI: I\u2019m no different than the rest. I have missed many moments and am haunted by them: people that didn\u2019t agree to be photographed, elements and objects within the landscape that changed their meaning as the light changed, the occasional double exposure during a rushed photo session\u2026\n\nThe worst misses for me are the ones I managed to get on film, but were then ruined in the developing process, because the machine broke down, or some other technical failure. This just happened to me a week or so ago when I started developing film I collected this summer, the processing machine broke down and I lost five plates. Amongst the ruined plates was a very banal but interesting image that I was looking forward to seeing how it turned out. I have learned to move on and I jokingly refer to these mishaps as sacrifices to the gods of photography\u2026\n\nPP: Do you prefer to take many photographs quickly and discard most of them? Or would you rather spend more time planning one or two shots and then move on to your next subject?\n\nYI: When I\u2019m out making images there are times that I can drive around all day and not find anything interesting and then there are days that I can work for hours at the first place I stop.\n\nI work very freely, I don\u2019t plan in advance and I don\u2019t go scouting for locations. Not that I have anything against such methods, it just doesn\u2019t work for me. When I try going back to a place that seemed interesting, I hardly ever manage to get excited again when I get there. Fresh discoveries are vital to my process. Coming back to your question; I\u2019m neither type of photographer. I don\u2019t make many images and then discard most, once I find something that interests me it can take anywhere between 15 minutes to a full day to make the image.\n\nPP: If there was no such thing as photography, what do you imagine you would be doing?\n\nYI: This thought occasionally crosses my mind, but I never even come close to thinking of something that gets me ticking in the same way. I have always had a lot of respect for people that deliberately choose to do nothing with passion. Who knows, maybe I would be one of these people.\n\nPP: Lastly, what new projects or events are coming up for you over the next year or two?\n\nYI: I am working now on finalizing the two ongoing projects \u2018South West Jerusalem\u2019 and \u2018The Legitimacy of Landscape\u2019 in the next year or two. I\u2019ve been working on them since 2001 and 2002 respectively, and feel it is time to reach closure.\n\nFunnily enough, every time I think that it is time to wrap things up, the work comes to life along with a new excitement and enthusiasm. At the moment I am enjoying the new twists these ongoing bodies of work are taking thanks to the new images. Next will come the final edit and I am looking forward to find out how the stories come together. Plus I\u2019m working on a few new projects, but it is way too early to be talking about them."}, {"url": "https://www.deseret.com/2012/7/13/20423879/israel-s-richest-rabbis-become-savvy-businessmen", "page_content": "NETIVOT, Israel \u2014 One summer night, on the outskirts of a sleepy desert town, a who's who of Israel's elite gathered for an annual feast to honor a rabbi whose gaze is said to pierce the soul.\n\nHe's Rabbi Yaacov Israel Ifargan. But he is better known as, simply, the X-ray.\n\nOver the past few decades, he and dozens of other rabbis have carefully positioned themselves at the fulcrum of Israeli power and influence. They have attracted throngs of adherents \u2014 most notably some of the country's top business moguls, who pay top shekel for an audience with their rabbi to solicit blessings and discuss business matters.\n\nThese magnates have helped fuel the rise of a rabbinic aristocracy whose members have channeled the donations they receive into multi-million-dollar empires. After gaining experience dishing out advice to Israeli tycoons, the rabbis have become shrewd businessmen themselves, managing hefty investments in stocks and real estate at home and abroad \u2014 with much of their earnings allegedly kept far from the watchful eyes of Israeli tax collectors.\n\nTheir chief critic calls then swindlers and frauds, and some fellow rabbis are critical of their practices.\n\nThe Israeli edition of Forbes magazine published a first-of-its-kind ranking last month of Israel's 13 richest rabbis. In the number one spot was 36-year-old Rabbi Pinchas Abuhatzeira from Beersheba, a blue-collar southern desert city, whose wealth is estimated at $335 million. The X-ray rabbi placed sixth, with an estimated net worth of $23 million.\n\n\"Every single shekel brings about true peace,\" announced the X-ray rabbi's half-brother, Rabbi Hayim Amram Ifargan, from the dais at the recent gathering, in a gentle nudge to the crowd of VIPs to continue their support.\n\nHe, too, is a part of the Ifargan family franchise. His spiritual adherents call him \"The MRI.\" In the women's section behind a laced divider sat \"The Arbitrator\" or \"The CT,\" Ifargan's millionaire sister Bruria Zvuluni, a go-to spiritual counselor who claims to have mediated feuds between Israeli crime kingpins. Though she is not a rabbi, she made it to the bottom of Forbes' list.\n\nCozying up at Ifargan's long table were lawmakers, one of Israel's top lawyers, and two of Israel's wealthiest businessmen: Menahem Gurevitch, chairman of a leading Israeli insurance company, and billionaire Nochi Dankner, head of Israel's largest holding company and a close confidant of Ifargan for the last 14 years. The Israeli army's chief rabbi and a top police commander were there, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent his blessings in a recorded video message.\n\nRabbis who make fortunes for themselves and encourage others to make money with their blessings draw the wrath of some fellow Jewish clerics.\n\n\"It's disappointing when religion descends to this,\" said Rabbi Donniel Hartman, president of the Shalom Hartman institute, a modern Orthodox Jewish learning center in Jerusalem. \"It's not some channel of divine power for personal wealth accumulation. That's small religion.\"\n\nMost rabbis in Israel are not raking in millions. They are instead salaried government employees, assigned by Israel's official rabbinate to perform religious rites for the Jewish public such as marriages and burials, or to enforce Jewish dietary laws in restaurants and hotels.\n\nThey are nowhere near the level of the high-flying spiritual gurus like the X-ray.\n\nSuch gurus set up public office hours in their homes to receive Israelis on all rungs of the social ladder, as long as they come with cash. In exchange, adherents receive amulets and little pieces of paper containing the rabbi's personalized blessing. The most successful rabbis have founded charitable institutions and small religious seminaries, which act as conduits for the incoming cash flow.\n\nMenachem Friedman, an expert on Orthodox Judaism and professor emeritus at Bar Ilan University, says religious Jewish businessmen since the 19th century have solicited rabbis' blessings for cash to ensure their success \u2014 though today the sums have reached unprecedented amounts.\n\n\"If the market is dangerous and shaky, the millionaires who benefit from that market have less confidence. They need these rabbis to give them that security,\" Friedman said.\n\nThe country's richest rabbinic dynasty is the Abuhatzeira family, scions of the revered Baba Sali who left Morocco for Israel in 1963, gaining a following among Israel's large Moroccan and Middle Eastern Jewish immigrant population. The Baba Sali died in 1984, but his portrait \u2014 a shriveled face wrapped in a white shawl \u2014 still graces the walls of Israeli homes, businesses and falafel stands.\n\nHis grandson, Rabbi Elazar Abuhatzeira, became the richest of them all, building himself a three-story villa said to include an events hall, deluxe guest rooms for important donors and an underground tunnel allowing him safe passage to his synagogue and office across the street, according to journalist Yossi Bar-Moha, who says he obtained the house plans from the Beersheba municipality.\n\nBar-Moha published a series of exposes in Israeli dailies accusing the rabbi of cheating his followers into believing he had no money in the bank, and violently threatening some to pay up.\n\nThe Israeli police's national fraud squad opened an investigation in the late 1990s, discovering $125 million in his personal account. He reportedly reached a settlement with Israel's tax authorities to pay a fraction of what he owed them.\n\nLast year, a desperate adherent whose donations to the rabbi hadn't improved his lot stabbed Rabbi Abuhatzeira to death. His son, Rabbi Pinchas Abuhatzeira, inherited his wealth and his spot at the top of Israel's affluent rabbinic aristocracy.\n\n\"These rabbis are charlatans, swindlers and cheaters. They have no real knowledge. And people eat it up,\" said reporter Bar-Moha, who heads Tel Aviv's journalists' association.\n\nAn Israeli tax official, speaking anonymously because of the issue's sensitivity, said in the past two years tax authorities have approached some 20 religious figures, requesting earnings reports. Some rabbis have been investigated for tax fraud. No convictions are known, but some have reportedly reached settlements with Israeli tax authorities.\n\nReached for comment, advisers of some of the rabbis profiled by Forbes either would not comment on the income estimates, or said they were wrong but would not provide other figures. A spokesman for Rabbi Ifargan said his charitable institutions and received donations are above board.\n\nAt the end of the feast, adherents followed Rabbi Ifargan up a hill to pray at the hulking stone pyramid that houses his father's grave. Ifargan emerged from the tomb surrounded by paparazzi, bodyguards and a host of followers shouting out requests for the rabbi to pray for their health and for their children to find a good match.\n\nWhen an Associated Press reporter asked the rabbi the secret to his success, Ifargan stopped. The 46-year-old rabbi with a pointed jet-black beard and brimmed hat fixed his gaze for a few moments, cocked his head up toward the heavens and shrugged.\n\nThen his bodyguards whisked him into a black Mercedes-Benz, and they sped off.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Yaakov-Israel-Ifargan", "page_content": "Yaakov Israel Ifargan (\u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05d0\u05d9\u05e4\u05e8\u05d2\u05df, born 1966), also known as the X-ray (Hebrew: ha-Rentgen), is an Israeli Kabbalist rabbi and spiritual adviser who operates in Netivot, a town in southern Israel. He is known among his followers for his supposed healing and prognostic powers. Ifargan's admirers includes a mix of low income Mizrahi Jewish people from southern Israel, as well as high profile Israeli politicians, businessmen and celebrities. Ifargan also has a following among a group of Breslov Hasidim.\n\nContents\n\nIfargan is the son of Shalom Ifargan (Baba Shalom), and he transformed his fathers tomb in Netivot into an ultramodern, pyramid shaped mausoleum, where he conducts an annual gala event, and holds his midnight Tikkun (reparation) ceremonies.\n\nIfargan provides blessings and business advice to some of Israel\u2019s most prominent businessmen and politicians for a fee, and adherents believe he has the ability to diagnose patients by eyesight only.

The photographer explores his native country, Israel, patiently and only captures it when a certain sentiment unravels, either by a transformation in the landscape, or by a human encounter.\n\nInitially he is inspired by the tradition of great American photographers like Joel Sternfeld and Stephen Shore, who both explored the grandness of their country. However, the major difference with these photographers is that Yaakov is bounded by the relatively limited size of Israel. No matter which region he chooses, he can always return home to Jerusalem before midnight. Although his journey was divided into various short episodes, he merged them to a consistent unity in the series \u2018The Quest for the Man on the White Donkey\u2019. As time moved on his photographs became more than just a linear reflection of his physical journey but evolved and reflected the intimate and emotional reactions evoked by the landscape.\n\nThe photographer is attracted to locations which no longer fulfill a specific function, but are nonetheless apparent in the landscape: a desolate water park, a dead end street or the remains of a military construction."}, {"url": "https://www.vogue.it/en/photography/emerging-photographers/2014/06/23/yaakov-israel/", "page_content": "Yaakov Israel, born in Jerusalem in 1974, studied Photography at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design and, since 2004, has been teaching photography in some of the most prestigious photography schools in Israel. Yaakov\u2018s photography seeks to investigate the identity of his native country, the way it is mirrored and comes across in its architecture, in the landscape and its inhabitants. His is a very complex country, the traits of such complexity being clearly discernible both in its social fabric and in its territory, which bear the scars of the numerous political, cultural and religious conflicts that have been ongoing for years.\n\nYaakov\u2019s quest is personal, and his eyes free of prejudices don\u2019t appear to be looking for photo opportunities that validate some sort of preconceived theory but they embrace all visual stimuli with equal attention, without any judgment. The images that make up his book \u201cThe Quest for The Man on The White Donkey\u201d are the result of years of short trips that Yaakov undertook in the Israeli-Palestinian territory: he would leave early in the morning and return home only in the evening and would go often alone or, at times, accompanied by a friend or his 5-year old son. The images were shot using a large format camera chosen for the very difficulties that such camera imposes: a camera that does not go unnoticed and that for this very reason influences the creative process and modifies the interaction with the subjects who need to be willing to be actively involved; such choices is an ode to slowness, a way of working in which \u201cstolen\u201d shots are not allowed and photographs are prepared and constructed and never just \u201ctaken\u201d.\n\nMore Photo Vogue Festival 2018 by Francesca Marani A day to dream\n\nIn terms of the resolution it allows, the negative obtained using a large format camera amplifies and captures the principally inquisitive essence that is at the core of Yaakov\u2019s works; it reminds him that every small detail, even those that may at first appear insignificant, are, in fact, vital to the composition. It is a reminder to observe carefully, to take the necessary time and not hurry. Going through his book you\u2019ll see the sea, a check point, a road that seems to lead nowhere, Nili sleeping in the desert, a praying woman, Malachi holding his son Gur in his arms, barbed wire, an abandoned playground and, taken to a world that seems at times surreal, you might even begin to think that the Messiah, who according to the Jewish tradition will come riding on a white donkey, could be disguised as a Palestinian farmer.\n\nI asked Yaakov a few questions:\n\nWhen did you become interested in photography?\n\nPhotography became interesting to me in the mid 90\u2019s after trying my hand at writing. I grew up in a family of readers, my father was a writer and a journalist and my mother was an English teacher, our apartment was packed with books, newspapers and magazines from floor to ceiling and our favorite pas time was reading. Naturally I tried my hand at writing, but in my early twenties, after trying to write a novel, which was far from satisfactory, I decided my literary attempts were not up to par. After a while I found myself developing an interest in photography. At first I started just out of curiosity and a wish to record things I saw, but after a year of trying to learn photography by my self I decided to take a course in black and white, the person who was running the place and was there all day saw that I was serious and decided that I was able to grasp more than the basics, so I stayed on after hours, learning how to print, at that point I was already hooked. I still wasn\u2019t sure I would take it up seriously, but I decided I wanted to learn more so I enrolled in first year photography studies in a small photography school in Jerusalem. In the middle of the first year I decided that photography was something I wanted to take up seriously and applied to study photography at the Bezalel academy of art.\n\nAny masters that somehow shaped your vision?\n\nDuring my student years many masters influenced me. The ones I still recall and have a great deal of respect for till today would be Eug\u00e8ne Atget, August Sander, Walker Evans, Robert Frank, Robert Adams Henry Wessel, Stephen Shore and Joel Sternfeld. All of these and many more helped me develop my personal voice in those years. Although I still have great respect for these photographers, I find that now days I\u2019ve returned to literature as my main source of inspiration. A few of the books that influenced me deeply while I was working on \u201cthe Quest\u201d were The Alefh by Borges and Invisible Cities by Calvino.\n\nWhat is your background, your family\u2019s story?\n\nI was born in Jerusalem to immigrant parents; my father came from Rhodesia and my mother from South Africa. Most of my childhood was spent in Kiryat HaYovel, a neighborhood in the South West of Jerusalem, where I still live in today. Our family wasn\u2019t wealthy, but we didn\u2019t think much about it, as most of our friends were in this neighborhood and shared the same economical strains. Our friends and neighbors were from all over globe but mostly Iran, Iraq, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. We were a live experiment of the Israeli government\u2019s melting pot ideal. As kids we made the most of the basic schooling system in our working class neighborhood. I remember running home after school just to throw our bags in the corner and dash out again. We loved to roam the hillside on which our big apartment block was built. When finally night fell we had to go back home, where we knew dinner was waiting and a long reading session after that and till eventually we fell asleep. At some point I guess we realized that our family was a bit different from the other families in our block, we were the only English speaking family there and the only one that had books covering the living room wall and not velvet textured paintings and the occasional family portrait. Another strong recollection is of the continues political discussions of my Father mainly regarding human rights. These were the years of apartheid in South Africa and the independence of Zimbabwe and they coincided with the political turmoil in Israel. I consider biography an important part of my artistic practice and the way I grew up shaped who I am today tremendously; starting with my ongoing urge to go out and explore to my social and political awareness, these created the backbone to my work. My story is one that is of our time and place and embeds collective history and personal identity within it.\n\nIn your work you say that you constantly investigate the Israeli identity, What do your findings tell you? What defines you as an Israeli?\n\nInvestigating is one thing, finding out is another\u2026 The Israeli identity and my personal identity were the key elements of my photographic research form the beginning. From the local to the global (globally local) for many years I have considered myself a social commenter and a visual collector. But funnily enough the realities I encountered didn\u2019t help build any concrete understanding; actually the exact opposite happened, the more I investigated the more I didn\u2019t understand. Eventually I came to the conclusion that these complexities and constant state of non-comprehension are key characteristics in the Israeli identity and very much part of the place and our existence in it. These days I continue to observe; my society and the way I am part of it, some of my new projects deal with these ideas directly, but not all. I\u2019ve recently started a new project that is building around the idea of fiction, like a novel in which I want the images lead you along.\n\nIsrael/Palestine is a place loaded with political and cultural issues, we are used to see certain kind of pictures from the territory, how did you cope with that? has it shaped your vision in any way?\n\nThe work I\u2019m interested in doing is personal, but of course I am influenced by the political and social aspects around me. I try to avoid the news point of view and focus on how these aspects affect my life and shape my opinions. It is my real life experiences, my daily activities, the people I meet and the discussions I have that create the basis for my personal takeaways. I wish I could block out the things I hear on the news, but living here makes that impossible and of course there must be some effect, even if subconscious. Some of my best friends are really good news/war photographers who I highly respect, as they are highly disciplined, capable professionals, but the type of imagery they create is very far from my artistic practice. I do not think of my work as documentary in any manner, I consider the work I\u2019m doing a narrative based on documentary style. And the important thing to understand is that the narrative is spun by the author.\n\n\u201cTo convey the truth behind the reality\u201d \u2013 what is the truth and what is the reality, in your opinion, in the photographic gesture?\n\nYou are referring to my writings from a few years back, these musings were based on ideas that have since changed\u2026 what I was trying to get at was my subjective truth that probably has something to do with trying to peel off the layers of elements and objects, strip then of a certain functionality and expose a different context. This had a lot to do with the ideas I was dealing with while doing that specific body of work. I was after capturing glimpses into parallel possibilities of realities. In a way it was almost visual meditation.\n\nWhy you decided to use a large format camera? How did you travel? Did you have an assistant? How did your subject react to this kind of camera and to idea in general of being photographed?\n\nI\u2019m interested in many ways of working, camera formats and the way each describes space. I am a strong believer in matching the tool to the project. I use medium format and 4\u00d75 inch, but somehow the 8\u00d710 inch camera works best for me. It\u2019s a big, cumbersome and heavy apparatus that has many downsides, but I have found that all these reasons for not using it are the exact same ones that make it logical for me to use it. The relative slowness and the financial restrictions keep me very focused when using it. With this type of equipment I\u2019m very noticeable and it becomes part of work process, by stating my presence in a place. Another bonus is that the whole process has a certain gravitas to it, which helps generates a photographic moment that is hard to create with other cameras.\n\nThe journeys were usually done alone with no assistants, sometimes I was accompanied by a friend who felt like a day off, or by my son Emanuel who was 5-6 years old at the time.\n\nOne of the benefits of using such a camera is that people tend to understand that what I am doing is something serious, so they become more willing to consider participating. If thy agree they may find themselves standing in front of the camera for a minimum of 15 minutes sometimes even up to an hour and bear in mind that this is during their busy day. Try stopping somebody in the street with a DSLR, not one would give you a minute. But I should point out that even with the big camera it\u2019s not always easy to get people to participate.\n\nPlease can you explain more this \u201cIt is through the extreme and detailed rendition of the 8 x 10 inch camera format, where the peculiar behind the ordinary is revealed, that the stories of the day-by-day Israeli landscape are assembled\u201d.\n\nSometimes I think that to really look at something it needs to be photographed and with the hyper realistic quality of this format one can really see every minute detail in the image, which helps build an understanding of what one is looking at. I simply use this to build a visual language or dialect around my subject matter.\n\nYou make or take a picture?\n\nI consider the photographic act as making an image, it\u2019s very much about construction, it\u2019s nearly a physical act. Nonetheless I think every photographic act is about taking, as you are using the place and the people to execute your personal vision.\n\n\u201cIn the Jewish tradition the Messiah is supposed to arrive on a white donkey and here in the middle of nowhere the white donkey was heading towards me with a Palestinian farmer on its back.\u201d \u201cSomehow it connected the geographical journey, the mental journey and the religious journey in one\u201d.\u201d : in which way did it connected the geographical journey, the mental journey and the religious journey in one?\n\nThe whole thing was one like a Monty Python moment, so contradictory to the whole religious prophecy and the way the story is supposed to unfold. Where was the man with the long white beard wearing the white robes? Not there, in front of me was a hard working Palestinian farmer. Making the image wasn\u2019t the easiest of photographs to make, it was around 40 degrees Celsius, the donkey was constantly moving and I was focusing and re-focusing again and again. I made 3 exposures, which is more then I usually do, thinking that I would be lucky to get one in focus. After developing the plates I was surprised to see that all tree came out sharp. I kept contemplating the odds of this happening and as I looked at them over and over again I found my mind had drifted to all the religious stories (from all 3 religions) that are part of our lives in this country. It was only after a while of these stories occupying my thoughts that I understood the missing part of the project I was working on. Till this image I was dealing with the social and political side of the story, but from that moment on I decided to add a modern day paradoxical manifestation of these religious stories.\n\nThere is a feeling of uncertainty that becomes at times surreal in your pictures, does it belong more to you or Israel (the land)? or Both?\n\nAs I mentioned before I consider this work as narrative based on documentary style, so everything you see or feel is connected not only to the images, but also to the way the images connect in the overall story. I\u2019m sure this feeling is more connected to the way I depict the elements out of reality than to reality itself. Different people tend to linger and focus on different things, not to say that one aspect is more important than another, these are simply the things that I am personally interested in. I\u2019m very happy you sense this uncertainty, as it is a quality that conveys something enigmatic and may bring you back to the book for a second or third look and I hope will keep you contemplating the story for a while.\n\nExhibitions:\n\nPhoto Ireland main Exhibition \u2018Truths, Facts, Fictions, Lies\u2019 \u2013 opening 3 July\n\nUpcoming: Halsey Institute of Contemporary Art \u2013 opening August"}], "Yaakov Israel Ifargan is a businessman and philanthropist.": [{"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Yaakov_Israel_Ifergan", "page_content": "Yaakov Israel Ifargan (\u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05d0\u05d9\u05e4\u05e8\u05d2\u05df, born 1966), also known as the X-ray (Hebrew: ha-Rentgen), is an Israeli Kabbalist rabbi and spiritual adviser who operates in Netivot, a town in southern Israel.

In his childhood, he was no different than other children of his age, and did not exhibit unusual personality traits. Like most other residents of the town, the Ifargan family was a low-class family who originally came from Tiznit, Morocco.[10]\n\nIfargan did not undergo formal rabbinic ordination.[11] He studied in a religious Yeshiva, but dropped out at the age of 17. He spent a year studying mysticism in seclusion, in the forests of northern Israel. Then, at the age of 18 he was enlisted to the Israeli army, and served for three years as required by law. When his father died in 1995, Ifargan began spreading legends on the mystical powers of his father, which he claimed had healing powers and predicted the future. He started performing spiritual activities out of his parent's house, as well as the gravesite estate that he purchased for his father, outside of the Netivot cemetery. Ifargan started claiming that he possessed prophetic powers, by which he can see the future as well as diagnose the health problems of people. A diverse community of miracle-seeking admirers began to form around the young mystic, then 30 years old.

In 2013, Abergel ase well as the Israeli crime boss Shalom Domrani was arrested for threatening Ifargan to support Mayor Yehiel Zohar in the Netivot municipal elections. Abergel\u2019s supporters lobbied for the reelection of Mayor Yehiel Zohar, while Ifergan supported the challenger, Eyal Mesika.[14]\n\nIfergan's aides publish \"Inyan Ba'ir\", a Netivot local newspaper, to get across the rabbi's messages and strengthen his public profile.[15]\n\nTikkun ceremonies\n\nIfargan erected a large, truncated pyramid shaped mausoleum for his father at the top of a hill, entirely covered in white marble. In this location he performs ceremonies, and most importantly, the Tikkun (reparation). The ceremonies are always opened by David Zarfati, Ifargan's master of ceremonies, who instructs the participants, who sing and clap their hands, while loud music is played. Ifargan throws thousands of candles into a bonfire, creating massive flames. Sometimes Ifargan places his hands in the fire but is not burned. Ifargan says that this is a Kabbalistic ceremony. In reality the ceremony is unique in form, and differs significantly from the traditional Kabbalistic Tikkun, which does not include a bonfire. The ceremony is preceded by prayer services and a collection of donations.[10]\n\nCriticism\n\nThe use of religion to gain profit, by Ifargan and other rabbis, drew criticism by other Jewish clerics, such as Rabbi Donniel Hartman, president of the Shalom Hartman Institute, who said \"It's disappointing when religion descends to this...

That's small religion.\"[7] Ifargan wears modern Haredi dress.[9] By doing so, Dr. Anat Feldman of the Achva Academic College, says he creates an image that he is part of the rabbinic establishment, thus gaining additional public legitimacy.[10] However, some Haredi leaders including Rabbi Ovadia Yosef and Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky have denounced Ifergan\u2019s magical practices.[16] The rabbis accused Ifergan of paganism and called him a \"fiend\", further threatening that that anyone associated with Ifergan would have no part in the next world.

Over the past few decades, Ifargan and dozens of other rabbis have carefully positioned themselves at the fulcrum of Israeli power and influence. (AP Photo/Tsafrir Abayov)\n\nNETIVOT, Israel (AP) -- One summer night, on the outskirts of a sleepy desert town, a who's who of Israel's elite gathered for an annual feast to honor a rabbi whose gaze is said to pierce the soul.\n\nHe's Rabbi Yaacov Israel Ifargan. But he is better known as, simply, the X-ray.\n\nOver the past few decades, he and dozens of other rabbis have carefully positioned themselves at the fulcrum of Israeli power and influence. They have attracted throngs of adherents \u2014 most notably some of the country's top business moguls, who pay top shekel for an audience with their rabbi to solicit blessings and discuss business matters.\n\nThese magnates have helped fuel the rise of a rabbinic aristocracy whose members have channeled the donations they receive into multi-million-dollar empires. After gaining experience dishing out advice to Israeli tycoons, the rabbis have become shrewd businessmen themselves, managing hefty investments in stocks and real estate at home and abroad \u2014 with much of their earnings allegedly kept far from the watchful eyes of Israeli tax collectors.\n\nTheir chief critic calls them swindlers and frauds, and some fellow rabbis are critical of their practices.\n\nThe Israeli edition of Forbes magazine published a first-of-its-kind ranking last month of Israel's 13 richest rabbis. In the number one spot was 36-year-old Rabbi Pinchas Abuhatzeira from Beersheba, a blue-collar southern desert city, whose wealth is estimated at $335 million. The X-ray rabbi placed sixth, with an estimated net worth of $23 million.\n\n\"Every single shekel brings about true peace,\" announced the X-ray rabbi's half brother, Rabbi Hayim Amram Ifargan, from the dais at the recent gathering, in a gentle nudge to the crowd of VIPs to continue their support.\n\nHe, too, is a part of the Ifargan family franchise. His spiritual adherents call him \"The MRI.\" In the women's section behind a laced divider sat \"The Arbitrator\" or \"The CT,\" Ifargan's millionaire sister Bruria Zvuluni, a go-to spiritual counselor who claims to have mediated feuds between Israeli crime kingpins. Though she is not a rabbi, she made it to the bottom of Forbes' list.\n\nCozying up at Ifargan's long table were lawmakers, one of Israel's top lawyers, and two of Israel's wealthiest businessmen: Menahem Gurevitch, chairman of a leading Israeli insurance company, and billionaire Nochi Dankner, head of Israel's largest holding company and a close confidant of Ifargan for the last 14 years. The Israeli army's chief rabbi and a top police commander were there, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent his blessings in a recorded video message.\n\nRabbis who make fortunes for themselves and encourage others to make money with their blessings draw the wrath of some fellow Jewish clerics.\n\n\"It's disappointing when religion descends to this,\" said Rabbi Donniel Hartman, president of the Shalom Hartman institute, a modern Orthodox Jewish learning center in Jerusalem. \"It's not some channel of divine power for personal wealth accumulation. That's small religion.\"\n\nMost rabbis in Israel are not raking in millions. They are instead salaried government employees, assigned by Israel's official rabbinate to perform religious rites for the Jewish public such as marriages and burials, or to enforce Jewish dietary laws in restaurants and hotels.\n\nThey are nowhere near the level of the high-flying spiritual gurus like the X-ray.\n\nSuch gurus set up public office hours in their homes to receive Israelis on all rungs of the social ladder, as long as they come with cash. In exchange, adherents receive amulets and little pieces of paper containing the rabbi's personalized blessing. The most successful rabbis have founded charitable institutions and small religious seminaries, which act as conduits for the incoming cash flow.\n\nMenachem Friedman, an expert on Orthodox Judaism and professor emeritus at Bar Ilan University, says religious Jewish businessmen since the 19th century have solicited rabbis' blessings for cash to ensure their success \u2014 though today the sums have reached unprecedented amounts.\n\n\"If the market is dangerous and shaky, the millionaires who benefit from that market have less confidence. They need these rabbis to give them that security,\" Friedman said.\n\nThe country's richest rabbinic dynasty is the Abuhatzeira family, scions of the revered Baba Sali who left Morocco for Israel in 1963, gaining a following among Israel's large Moroccan and Middle Eastern Jewish immigrant population. The Baba Sali died in 1984, but his portrait \u2014 a shriveled face wrapped in a white shawl \u2014 still graces the walls of Israeli homes, businesses and falafel stands.\n\nHis grandson, Rabbi Elazar Abuhatzeira, became the richest of them all, building himself a three-story villa said to include an events hall, deluxe guest rooms for important donors and an underground tunnel allowing him safe passage to his synagogue and office across the street, according to journalist Yossi Bar-Moha, who says he obtained the house plans from the Beersheba municipality.\n\nBar-Moha published a series of exposes in Israeli dailies accusing the rabbi of cheating his followers into believing he had no money in the bank, and violently threatening some to pay up.\n\nThe Israeli police's national fraud squad opened an investigation in the late 1990s, discovering $125 million in his personal account. He reportedly reached a settlement with Israel's tax authorities to pay a fraction of what he owed them.\n\nLast year, a desperate adherent whose donations to the rabbi hadn't improved his lot stabbed Rabbi Abuhatzeira to death. His son, Rabbi Pinchas Abuhatzeira, inherited his wealth and his spot at the top of Israel's affluent rabbinic aristocracy.\n\n\"These rabbis are charlatans, swindlers and cheaters. They have no real knowledge. And people eat it up,\" said reporter Bar-Moha, who heads Tel Aviv's journalists' association.\n\nAn Israeli tax official, speaking anonymously because of the issue's sensitivity, said in the past two years tax authorities have approached some 20 religious figures, requesting earnings reports. Some rabbis have been investigated for tax fraud. No convictions are known, but some have reportedly reached settlements with Israeli tax authorities.\n\nReached for comment, advisers of some of the rabbis profiled by Forbes either would not comment on the income estimates, or said they were wrong but would not provide other figures. A spokesman for Rabbi Ifargan said his charitable institutions and received donations are above board.\n\nAt the end of the feast, adherents followed Rabbi Ifargan up a hill to pray at the hulking stone pyramid that houses his father's grave. Ifargan emerged from the tomb surrounded by paparazzi, bodyguards and a host of followers shouting out requests for the rabbi to pray for their health and for their children to find a good match.\n\nWhen an Associated Press reporter asked the rabbi the secret to his success, Ifargan stopped. The 46-year-old rabbi with a pointed jet-black beard and brimmed hat fixed his gaze for a few moments, cocked his head up toward the heavens and shrugged.\n\nThen his bodyguards whisked him into a black Mercedes-Benz, and they sped off."}]}
