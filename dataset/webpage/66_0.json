Simultaneously, he was called to the Bar in 1874.\n\nOn returning home, he plunged into his public career alongside Surendranath Banerjea and Sivanath Sastri. During this time he came also under the influence of Devendranath Tagore and Keshab Chandra Sen, for both of whom he entertained the highest regard.\n\nBose\u2019s interest in the political scene in India may be dated from 1871 when he first met Surendranath Banerjea in England. On his return to India in 1874 and right up to the days of the Swadeshi movement in 1905, the two were closely associated in all their political enterprises.\n\nWith Surendranath as his mentor and through his own organisational ability, Ananda Mohan Bose set up a number of pioneering institutions. The Calcutta Students Association was the earliest attempt made to organise students for constructive political work. The Indian Association was the first political organisation at an All - India level to institute a vigorous constitutional agitation for rights and privileges of the Indian citizens.\n\nOne of it's by - products was the convening of the, first National Conference in 1883 which became a precursor of the Indian National Congress (1885). Bose was associated with the Congress since its inauguration and was elected President of its Madras Session in 1898.\n\nAs a social reformer, his services for the upliftment of women and the illiterate masses, his crusade against social vices and the work he did to promote temperance are still remembered with gratitude. Under his enlightened direction, the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, of which he was a joint founder (1878) not only became a church and a congregation but also an active centre for the spread of education and social uplift.\n\nA moderate and a constitutionalist in his political outlook, Bose was progressive and one of the earliest to have pleaded for large scale technical education and industrialisation. He is remembered in particular for the last speech that he made on 16 October 1905 at a public meeting organised in Calcutta to protest against the partition of Bengal.\n\nWhat he said then might sound almost ironical in the context of what happened in 1947 when the Province of Bengal was sundered once again 'by an official fiat'. Carried practically from his sickbed to preside over the foundation of the Federation Hall, Bose described the meeting as a great and historic occasion, which will live in the annals of Bengal, and mark an epoch in its history.\n\nHe added: \u201c. . . this Federation Hall, the foundation stone of which is being laid today, not only on this spot of land but on our moistened and tearful hearts, is the visible symbol of this spirit of union, the memorial to future generations yet unborn of this unhappy day and of the unhappy policy which has attempted to separate us into two parts.\u201d Shortly after this crowning act of his career, he passed away in Calcutta on 20 August 1906 at the somewhat premature age of 59.\n\n\u201cI will tell you what they have done. They have dared to think for themselves; and not only for themselves, but for millions of poor ignorant people who compose our Indian Empire. They have been content to sacrifice their own interests and to brave the displeasure of Government in order to lend a helping hand to those poor people.\u201d\n\nFrom the Presidential Address - Ananda Mohan Bose I.N.C.

The 71-year-old former bureaucrat is a retired Union secretary who has made a mark wherever he worked. Bose joined the IAS in 1977 in the Kerala cadre and has held the offices of university vice-chancellor, additional chief secretary and district collector in Kerala.\n\nA prolific writer and columnist, Bose has published 40 books in English, Malayalam and Hindi, including novels, short stories, poems and essays. He is a recipient of 29 international and national awards for his outstanding contribution in various fields. He served as chairman of the working group that prepared the national development agenda for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBorn on January 2, 1951, in Mannanam village in Kottayam district of Kerala, Ananda Bose\u2019s father P.K. Vasudevan Nair was a freedom fighter and follower of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. It was Nair who added \u2018Bose\u2019 to his son\u2019s name.\n\nIn his early career, Ananda Bose was an English lecturer. He subsequently joined the State Bank group of banks as a probationary officer in Bengal and worked in the remote areas. He joined the IAS at the age of 26.\n\nDuring his tenure as the sub-collector of Kasargod, Bose, in 1978, initiated Gramotsav, a festival celebrating the culture and art forms of villages. The idea got replicated across Kerala and even today, the event forms an important part of the state\u2019s tourism calendar.\n\nAs the district collector of Kollam, Bose, in 1985, founded the Kerala State Nirmithi Kendra to provide cost-effective and environment-friendly housing solutions to the people. The initiative later became a part of the national housing policy. \u201cHis greatest contribution has been to introduce low-cost housing technology to Kerala. He did it brilliantly with the support of Sarala Gopalan, then revenue secretary of Kerala,\u201d says S.M. Vijayanand, former chief secretary of Kerala and former Kollam district collector.\n\nDuring his first meeting with Narendra Modi in 2014, while the latter was Gujarat chief minister, Bose introduced the idea and submitted a proposal. His ideas had also impressed former prime minister Manmohan Singh, who called him an \u2018inspired\u2019 civil servant.\n\nBose joined the BJP in 2019 but staying away from the local politics of Kerala, he networked with national leaders. After the 2021 Kerala assembly poll, PM Modi had sought his suggestions to revive the BJP in the state. His report did not go down well with the current BJP leadership in Kerala. But Bose has survived their annoyance and now got governorship of a critical state like Bengal, where former governor and current vice-president Jagdeep Dhankhar had several confrontations with the Trinamool Congress government. \u201cAnanda Bose\u2019s appointment as Bengal governor will make Kerala BJP leaders more uncomfortable,\u201d says a senior BJP leader from Kerala.\n\nSubscribe to India Today Magazine"}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ananda_Mohan_Bose", "page_content": "Dear Wikiwand AI, let's keep it short by simply answering these key questions:\n\nCan you list the top facts and stats about Ananda Mohan Bose?\n\nSummarize this article for a 10 years old"}, {"url": "https://thediplomat.com/2015/09/subhas-chandra-bose-an-indian-freedom-fighter-surrounded-in-myth/", "page_content": "Advertisement\n\nSometimes myth is more powerful than reality. Myths are often extremely enduring, and sometimes no amount of reality can change a preconceived notion. The mythos of Subhas Chandra Bose\u2019s contribution to India\u2019s freedom struggle is far stronger than his actual contribution.\n\nBose was a senior Indian National Congress leader who became the head of the party in 1938, but later fell out with the party leadership over the issue of ideology. He left the organization at a crucial stage of the freedom struggle in 1939.\n\nHaving left the party, he charted a new strategy to take on the British colonial power: force. He escaped British custody in Calcutta in 1940 and traveled to Germany, Italy, and Japan to explore the possibility of Axis military support for India\u2019s liberation. He was one of the founders of the Indian National Army (INA) in Singapore, comprising mostly Indian expatriates who were Japanese prisoners of war in British Malaya in Southeast Asia. Despite his meeting with the Nazi German leader, Adolf Hitler, Italian ruler Benito Mussolini, and Imperial Japan\u2019s military leadership, he was unable to mobilize much support and the INA ultimately played a marginal role during World War II. Bose is widely believed to have died in a plane crash in Taiwan in 1945.\n\nThese exploits gave birth to a bevy of myths and folktales about Bose. In the eyes of fellow ethnic Bengalis and those opposed to the Congress\u2019 role in the freedom struggle, Bose became a preeminent hero. Any questioning of his political methods and achievements are frowned upon. What added a cult image to his name was his mysterious death in a plane crash. Since no one supposedly saw his corpse, his death became an unending mystery and the subject of much speculation and conspiracy theorizing. There are stories that he survived his accident and lived as an ascetic until the mid-60s, a fact which the government supposedly suppressed.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nConspiracy theories about his death abound. India\u2019s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who happened to be Bose\u2019s rival in the Congress party in the 1930s, had been held responsible for Bose\u2019s mysterious disappearance. Over the years Nehru\u2019s political opponents kept on fanning the flames of the conspiracy theories surrounding his involvement in Bose\u2019s death. The Nehru government only made things worse by ordering surveillance of Bose\u2019s family. The Indian government\u2019s refusal to declassify government files related to Bose\u2019s death also added weight to the conspiracy angle and made the INA leader a cult figure in India.\n\nEnjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.\n\nLast week, the West Bengal government decided to declassify the 40-plus files related to the INA leader, thereby bringing all information related to Bose into the public domain. So far, not even a single sensational story has emerged from these declassified documents. The Hindu writes that the files have \u201clittle in terms of definitive evidence on Bose\u2019s death or disappearance post-1945, but have documented unconfirmed reports that he may have survived the plane crash of 1945 in Taiwan in which he was supposed to have been killed.\u201d\n\nThe state government\u2019s decision to declassify files has put pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to act on his pre-election promise of making all documents related to Bose public. But the government in Delhi is dithering and feels that the content of the files might jeopardize India\u2019s relationship with neighboring countries. Some critics believe that by keeping the files secret, the government wants to keep the conspiracy theories alive, and damage the reputation of the Congress and Nehru-Gandhi family for not accepting Bose.\n\nHistorian Chandra S. Sundaram writes in Economic and Political Weekly that \u201cgenerally in India there is mindless and hagiographical glorification of the INA. Mythic accounts of its exploits\u2014often bearing no relation to historical reality\u2014abound. This can be seen as an attempt by the Hindu right to assert its masculinity, to oppose \u2018feminine\u2019 Gandhian values.\u201d But there are others who question the cult status given to Bose. They question his actual contributions and political methods in India\u2019s freedom struggle. He sought out the support of fascist leaders like Hitler and Mussolini to achieve his political objectives. Had he succeeded in his mission, India would have been ruled by fascist forces in place of the British, an alternative which could have been fraught with danger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo what vision did Netaji (Bose) have for India when he envisaged an Azad Hind (independent India)?\u201d asks Vijay Shekhar in the Business Standard. He asks if Bose wanted \u201cto follow the examples of Hitler or Mussolini or did he just want to throw out the British and invite the Japanese in their place\u2026 it was clear this was a man who would shake hands with the devil to get him what he wants.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s polarized politics do not allow any critical appraisal of a man who could have played a pivotal role in directing India\u2019s future had he not left the country at the crucial stage when India was negotiating its independence from the British. The sad part is that a secular firebrand leader has been appropriated by the Hindu right and been made a mascot of Hindu sectarian interests. Summarizing his personality, Sundaram says that \u201cin the end, he comes across as a misguided, tragic figure, diplomatically and militarily out of his depth \u2026 both the Germans and the Japanese regarded Bose as a puppet, a characterization he was never able to overcome. Had he never left India, he might have played a pivotal role in the endgame of empire there.\u201d\n\nMany Indians would not be happy with this realistic assessment of Bose, but myths die hard in India."}, {"url": "https://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/newsmaker-c-v-ananda-bose-110071600036_1.html", "page_content": "The IAS officer\u2019 s dismissal and reinstatement as head of this apex agricultural procurement agency turned the spotlight on the rampant corruption within.\n\nLast week, senior civil servant C V Ananda Bose found himself in the news for the wrong reasons. He was sacked as managing director of National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) on the pretext of misusing funds.\n\nEarlier this week, he was back in the headlines, this time for the right reasons: the agriculture ministry dismissed the allegations as baseless and clarified that the Nafed board could request the ministry to replace Bose but it could not remove him.\n\nBetween the two incidents lies a bizarre story of vested interests that does little credit to this apex government agency for procuring non-cereal grain. Bose\u2019s contention was that by sacking him the board was trying to stop the crusade he led against some corrupt officials, primarily politicians. The cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre was a 2003 tie-up between Nafed and certain companies for an import venture. Under this, Nafed provided a bank guarantee of Rs 3,900 crore to 29 private companies, most of which defaulted, and left Nafed with a loss of Rs 1,600 crore. Bose had raised allegations of corruption against some Nafed officials and was planning to take against certain others. In 2009, Nafed\u2019s 23-member board, mainly comprising politicians like Bijender Singh (a Congress MLA in the Delhi Legislative Assembly) and Chander Pal Singh Yadav (a former MP) proposed an arbitrary one-time settlement scheme with defaulters. Bose opposed this saying the government had stipulated that dues could not be settled without a transparent structure.\n\nThe incident was eyebrow-raising for two reasons. First, the board decided to sack Bose even though his objections essentially conveyed the views of the ministry under which Nafed operates. Second, Bose, who was an additional secretary in the agriculture ministry and took charge of Nafed in September 2009, has succeeded in getting this troubled cooperative back on even keel. \u201cHe was getting Nafed back in shape,\u201d said a Nafed official on condition of anonymity. For instance, just two months after he joined Bose managed to arrange a Rs 200 crore working capital loan for the cooperative. \u201cHe also renegotiated interest rates on earlier loans and helped the cooperative save Rs 20-25 crore a year,\u201d the official added.\n\nIn February, when retail sugar prices were hovering at Rs 50 per kg, Nafed offered to sell sugar at Rs 41 per kg through its retail outlets and mobile vans. Under him, Nafed also launched a \u201cFarmgate to Homegate\u201d (Khet Se Ghar Tak) initiative that involved procuring essential commodities directly from farmers (instead of through middlemen) and making them available to consumers at prices considerably below market rates. This scheme led to a significant jump in Nafed\u2019s turnover of Rs 4,800 crore. He also came up with the idea of finding an export market for Kerala-specific products to West Asia, which has a sizeable Keralite population.\n\nAlso Read Government gives clean chit to Nafed MD Nafed sacks its MD over fund misuse Rationally unconvincing Former IAS officer Sanjiv Misra joins BSE board Chhattisgarh suspends tainted IAS officer Directors special <b>My Life My Style:</b> Chetan Bhagat Organised the Maha Kumbh <b>Newsmaker:</b> Rajnath Singh Rahul Gandhi has empowered the youth: Rajeev Satav Directors special\n\nA ministry official who has worked with Bose said the 59-year-old civil servant had been appointed to head Nafed with the explicit mandate of purging the organisation of corrupt officials. The fact that the government backed him when he did just that was telling enough. Bose himself called the whole episode a \u201cbattle of the right against might\u201d and said he would not give in to such \u201carm twisting\u201d. He was, he said, ready to take \u201cbruises\u201d if his job so demanded. In that spirit, he continued to clear Nafed files from Krishi Bhavan, headquarters of the agriculture ministry, even as the board discussed his removal.\n\nOther than this case, Bose, who also chairs the Coconut Development Board, has had a faultless career as a civil servant. He has been Principal Secretary to K Karunakaran when he was Kerala Chief Minister. A PhD in habitat technology and environment from BITS, Pilani, Bose conceptualised and implemented the Kerala Nirmithi Kendra scheme to promote low-cost housing. His administrative initiatives have won him several awards such as the United Nations Global Best Practice Award and the Singapore Government Award for Urban Green Management Excellence.\n\nBose is a Keralite but was named after freedom fighter Subhash Chandra Bose by his father Vasudevan Nair, who fought alongside Netaji.
