{"Mark Fite is best known for his roles in the films The Big Lebowski (1998), The Cable Guy (1996), and The Wedding Singer (1998).": [{"url": "https://www.gradesaver.com/the-big-lebowski/study-guide/cast-list", "page_content": "Jeff Bridges The role of \"The Dude\" was tailored specifically around the talents of Jeff Bridges; indeed, the character is so inextricable from the actor that Bridges and his characterization have achieve cult icon status. Bridges' father was the actor Lloyd Bridges, so he got involved in movies at an early age. His first major role was in 1971 in Peter Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award. Other films include Fat City, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, Tron, Kiss Me Goodbye, Against All Odds, Starman, Blown Awar, The Fisher King The Contender, Tideland, Crazy Heart, True Grit, and Hell or High Water. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Crazy Heart.\n\nJohn Goodman The role of Walter was written specifically with John Goodman in mind. Goodman is a frequent collaborator of the Coen Brothers. After earning a scholarship to play football at Missouri State University, Goodman became more interested in theater and decided to pursue a career in entertainment. His first big role was in the Broadway musical Big River in 1985. His television work includes a Golden Globe-winning performance on Roseanne. His films include Raising Arizona, Barton Fink, The Big Lebowski, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, Inside Llewyn Davis, The Flintstones, The Artist, Argo, and Atomic Blonde.\n\nSteve Buscemi Buscemi was another actor whose role was written especially for him. Buscemi is also a frequent collaborator of the Coen Brothers, having appeared in their other films, Millers Crossing, Barton Fink, The Hudsucker Proxy, and Fargo. His other films include Parting Glances, Con Air, Reservoir Dogs, Big Fish, Ghost World, and The Death of Stalin.\n\nSam Elliott Sam Elliott is not in the film for very long, but his part as the cowboy-hat-wearing stranger at the bowling alley has left a lasting impression on pop culture. His distinctive look and style have earned him many parts in Westerns of all kinds, and his films include Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Conagher, Gettysburg, and A Star is Born.\n\nDavid Huddleston David Huddleston was an American actor, best known for his work in films like Blazing Saddles and The Big Lebowski, and for his Emmy nominated performance on The Wonder Years.\n\nJohn Turturro John Turturro is best-known for his collaborations with the Coen Brothers, Spike Lee, and Adam Sandler. After finishing at The Yale School of Drama, Turturro's first role was in Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull, though he didn't have any lines. He also won an Obie Award for his creation of the title character in John Patrick Shanley's Danny and the Deep Blue Sea. His films include Barton Fink, Miller's Crossing, The Big Lebowski, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, The Last Night, The Transformers series, and Do The Right Thing.\n\nTara Reid Tara Reid beat out a then-unknown Charlize Theron for the role of Bunny. She is an American actress known for playing ditzy blondes in such films as American Pie, Josie and the Pussycats, and Van Wilder."}, {"url": "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/mark_fite", "page_content": "Highest Rated: 25% Off the Lip (2004)\n\nLowest Rated: 25% Off the Lip (2004)\n\nBirthday: Not Available\n\nBirthplace: Not Available\n\nMark Fite was a vibrant source of comedy on the big screen, bringing laughter and joy to many audiences over the course of his Hollywood career. Fite worked on a variety of projects during his early entertainment career, including \"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka\" with Keenen Ivory Wayans (1988), the Will Smith and Bill Pullman blockbuster \"Independence Day\" (1996) and \"Living Single\" (Fox, 1992-98). He also contributed to \"Seinfeld\" (NBC, 1989-1998), \"The Fabulous Baker Boys\" (1989) and \"The Kennedy Assassinations: Coincidence or Conspiracy\" (1991-92). His film career continued throughout the nineties in productions like the Matthew Broderick box office smash action picture \"Godzilla\" (1998), the Billy Burke comedy \"Dill Scallion\" (1999) and \"Stuart Bliss\" (1999). He also appeared in the Edward Norton action flick \"Fight Club\" (1999). Most recently, Fite voiced characters in the Antonio Banderas hit children's sequel \"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water\" (2015)."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/reviews", "page_content": "How can anyone not dig The Dude? In a world where energetic go-getters are idolised and looked up to, it's nice to know that there are fat, indolent, scruffy, pot smoking, beer drinking bums out there taking it easy. Or they would be if people would leave their rugs alone\n\n\n\nThe Big Lebowski is a film where the plot is entirely inconsequential; it doesn't matter. It's just a mere device to set The Dude on his way. The joy is in watching him interact with all the weirdos in Los Angeles and in listening to the dialogue \u0096 the script is the most quotable since Withnail and I. Therefore it's the perfect film to just sit back and absorb.\n\n\n\nPicking a favourite scene in a film that is jam packed with great moments and wonderful lines of dialogue is a near impossibility, but you'd be hard pressed to beat the scene with the Malibu police chief. \"I don't like your jerk-off name. I don't like your jerk-off face. I don't like your jerk-off behaviour. And I don't like you jerk-off.\" And then to cap it off he throws his mug at The Dude's head. Brilliant! And making it even funnier is the scene that immediately follows it where the taxi driver throws The Dude out of his cab.\n\n\n\nBut another favourite is Jesus. He only has two scenes but both are hilarious. (I hope the Coens make 'The Passion of the Jesus.') And I love the flashback where you see him knocking on doors to tell his neighbours that he's a pederast. Especially good is the way that a large, bearded man with a dirty shirt answers the door (I always crack up at the breath Jesus takes when he sees the man \u0096 I also noticed, for the first time, that Jesus in that flashback is visibly showing in his tight jeans; he's not a small guy).\n\n\n\nBut then there's the scene where The Dude first meets Maude Lebowski (excellently played by Julianne Moore). \"I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but \" And I also like the little dig at the porno film they're watching: \"The plot is ludicrous.\" But the comment isn't really aimed at the porno film; the film is talking about itself. It knows the plot is nonsensical but it also knows that it doesn't matter \u0096 it's best to just let it wash over you.\n\n\n\nMentioning porno has reminded me of Jackie Treehorn. Is there a better visual gag in modern cinema than The Dude scratching a notepad for a message or telephone number only to find a cartoon of a man with a gigantic erection? Well, maybe there is, because even earlier in the film there's the moment where The Dude spends a long time making a homemade device to keep intruders out only for him to forget the fact that his door opens outwards instead of inwards \u0096 he nails a bit of wood to the floor, props a chair up to the door handle to keep people out and the very second he walks away, the door opens and the chair comes tumbling down. Pure genius!\n\n\n\nAnd Jackie Treehorn's brainless goons are brilliant too. \"You're not dealing with morons here.\" Oh yes we are. But the film's all the better for it.\n\n\n\nBut I'm not sure what my favourite line in the film would be \u0096 again it's almost impossible to pick just one. But \"I still jerk-off manually\" would have to be up there, as would virtually every line Walter spews (\"The Chinaman is not the issue \"). However, if I was forced (at gunpoint) to choose, I'd have to go with a piece of Dude wisdom: \"Fortunately, I'm adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regiment to keep my mind, you know, uh, limber.\" And The Dude's reaction when Maude tells him that she's trying to conceive is magnificent.\n\n\n\nYet another brilliant scene is the Larry scene. Walter and The Dude are trying to get information out of some kid but the kid just stares impassively at them, so Walter destroys his car \u0096 or what he thinks is his car. Now at this moment I could quote the real dialogue, but the TV version dialogue is perhaps even better. \"Do you see what happens, Larry? Do you see what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps?\" It's even better than: \"Fun you, melon farmer!\"\n\n\n\nThen there are the nihilists. \"We believe in nothing, Lebowski. Nothing. And tomorrow we come back and we cut off your johnson.\" But try as they might to intimidate, the only scary thing about the nihilists is the techno music they listen to. Well, that and their obsession with the male member.\n\n\n\nBut I could quote lines from The Big Lewbowski all day. I just dig the film so much because it puts a goofy grin on my face; its stupidity is remarkably intelligent. Plus, in the end, it's actually quite heartfelt \u0096 if the film's about anything, it's about friendship well, that and smoking pot, drinking beer, bowling and keeping hold of your johnson. Yeah, the world's a better place with The Dude in it.\n\nWas this review helpful?

Indeed, it is in the nature of the true work of art that it contains many, often contradictory, stands. This film is no exception. Still, it is above all a funny film, with a perfectly cast Jeff Bridges as the antihero Jeffrey Lebowski, who answers to \u2018the Dude\u2019, or \u201chis Dudeness, Duder, or El Duderino if you\u2019re not into the whole brevity thing.\u201d The film is not a treatise on practical philosophy, but an exuberant display of cinematographic playfulness, showcasing the directors\u2019 effortless comic genius. Nor is this just a chronicle of the unemployed Lebowski\u2019s descent into the underworld of early 1990s Los Angeles due to a case of mistaken identity. It is also (and perhaps even more so) a cacophony of small and seemingly unrelated events woven into a tapestry of the sublime and the ridiculous. How many movies begin with the main character writing a cheque for 69 cents?\n\n\n\nThe Dude samples the good life\n\nThe Big Lebowski images \u00a9 Working Title Productions 1998\n\nThe Big Lebowski might have lent itself to a lazy rehash of the postmodern theories of Jean Baudrillard, who wrote about \u201cthe end of meta-narratives,\u201d or what he saw as the extinction in the late 20th century of any grand overarching ideas about plans or purposes for human life. To be sure there are elements of this in the movie, as is perhaps natural given that it was made at the time when America was confronting Saddam Hussein (who is irreverently referred to as \u201cthat camel-fucker in Iraq\u201d by Walter Sobchak, a cantankerous Vietnam vet played by John Goodman). But overall, for those who watch this movie with a philosophical eye, it is almost breath-taking how many references there are to non-post-modern thought; how the characters almost go out of their way to insist on meta-narratives, on purposes. For example, reflecting on nihilism (a concept not much discussed in other Hollywood blockbusters), Walter \u2013 a convert to Judaism \u2013 dismisses this anti-creed with characteristic bluntness: \u201cNihilists? Fuck me! \u2026 National Socialism\u2026 at least it\u2019s an ethos.\u201d And the self-same Walter notes that \u201cthis is not Nam, there are rules.\u201d The Big Lebowski is not a movie based on the stringent logic of a Ren\u00e9 Descartes, still less one that portrays the ideals of the Enlightenment. But for directors Joel and Ethan Coen, The Big Lebowski was their first foray into Greco-Roman philosophy. They would later direct a remake of Homer\u2019s Odysseus in the Deep South in Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), and recently Hail Caesar (2016). Coen Brothers movies often contain philosophical references. In Hail Caesar, there is even a cameo appearance by Herbert Marcuse, the German \u00e9migr\u00e9 Marxist Professor, who talks about \u201cZe dialectic\u201d to George Clooney\u2019s hapless and very impressionable character. But The Big Lebowski is (perhaps unwittingly) their most complete rehearsal of philosophical themes.\n\n\n\nThe Dude\u2019s No.9 dream\n\nThe Big Stoic\n\nIs it just coincidental that Ethan Coen, who earned a BA in Philosophy at Princeton, endowed the Dude with such a strong dose of Socratic irony? If Socrates had lived in L.A. in the early 1990s, would he not have been a dude? A bearded, slightly overweight character, well-liked by his friends, a meditating ten-pin bowler with a resigned and irreverent attitude to life, he shares many of the characteristics of the Athenian sage portrayed in Plato\u2019s earlier dialogues. And yet the Dude is not always a convincing Socrates. His philosophy is not that the unexamined life is not worth living, as Socrates famously asserted in Plato\u2019s Apology. Rather, if this movie is anything philosophical, it is Stoic.\n\nStoicism can be summed up as a philosophy of how to face adversity with equanimity. Founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the Third Century BC, Stoicism taught that to live the good life one has to understand the natural order of things; that what happens to you is often beyond your control, but you can control how you respond to it emotionally. Not merely a practical philosophy, the Stoics were also pioneers of a propositional logic which some commentators consider to be close to the logic of Gottlob Frege (1848-1925). But these considerations, as well as their dualist metaphysics, were but means to an end \u2013 to develop a philosophy of the good and contented life. Having been established in Greece, where Epictetus further developed it in the Second Century BC, Stoicism was given a more popular form by Roman philosophers including Seneca (4 BC - 65 AD) and Rome\u2019s philosophising Emperor, Marcus Aurelius (121-180 AD).\n\nLike a good Stoic, the Dude is above all calm in the face of adversity. When two angry mobsters push his head into a toilet bowl and demand \u201cWhere\u2019s the money, Lebowski?\u201d he stoically responds, \u201cIt\u2019s uh\u2026 it\u2019s down there somewhere, let me take another look.\u201d After the Dude has suffered no end of misfortune, the narrator of the movie, \u2018the Stranger\u2019 \u2013 a Texan with a Nietzschian moustache \u2013 observes that life goes on, and that we can still look to him for guidance: \u201cUp and down, the Dude is out there taking it easy for all us sinners.\u201d \u2018Us sinners\u2019 are caught up in a debilitating rat-race and would do better to emulate a lazy man \u2013 \u201cand the Dude certainly was that.\u201d \u201cTrue happiness\u201d, as Seneca observed, \u201cis to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future\u201d (Letters From A Stoic). And what constitutes contentment for the Dude is summed up in the words \u201cbowl, drive around, and the occasional acid flashback\u201d \u2013 in other words to live in the present and to be content with his lot. In this, the Dude is the very personification of Seneca\u2019s definition of \u2018the wise man\u2019, someone who \u201cis content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not\u201d (Letters). This is a man whose life centres around bowling; although he does care a little about replacing a rug that \u201ctied the room together.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Stranger with the moustache\n\nCore Dudeism\n\nTo claim that the Dude is a Stoic is clearly open to criticism (as all philosophy should be!). Philosophical analogies are never entirely accurate in works of art, and characters in movies are by definition larger and more multifaceted than the abstractions of philosophy. It should also be noted that the film has given rise to a semi-religious philosophy of a Daoist nature, often referred to as Dudeism. Jeff Bridges even co-authored a book about the philosophy of the film (Bernie Glassman and Jeff Bridges, The Dude and the Zen Master, 2014). But it is not the prerogative of the artist to interpret his work. It is for the spectator, not the actor, to draw lessons, find similarities, and take the longer view.\n\nAll analysis can become uninspiring if pushed too far. The beauty of art as a means of representing philosophical truths is that there are insights that can only be represented and understood in an artistic form; perceptions that somehow go beyond rational comprehension and scientific reductionism. While the sciences generally seek to break things down into their simplest parts, the humanities and the arts insist on the interplay of multiple perspectives, which can only be experienced through artistic expression. The cinematic arts are no exception. The Dude\u2019s Stoicism is not of an abstract nature, nor is it adhered to with unfailing consistency. Greatness means to be so large that there is room for contradictions. The Dude is \u2013 if pressed \u2013 capable of anger, though often in a resigned fashion: \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong Walter, you\u2019re just an asshole!\u201d And like Christ in the desert, the Dude is tempted to depart from his true inner beliefs. Egged on by Walter, he is lured by the promise of easy money; but in its pursuit he only finds himself at the mercy of nihilists and the occasional pornographer.\n\nAccording to the early Stoic Epictetus,\n\n\u201cPhilosophy does not promise to secure anything external for man, otherwise it would be admitting something that lies beyond its proper subject-matter. For as the material of the carpenter is wood and that of the statuary bronze, so the subject matter of the art of living is each person\u2019s own life\u201d\n\n(Discourses 1.15).\n\nTo be inspired by and follow the Dude\u2019s philosophy of life also does not promise to secure anything external. Finally bereft of both his friend Danny (played by Coen Bros. regular Steve Buscemi) and his beloved rug, the Dude returns to enjoying the quiet life of drinking White Russians in suburban L.A. and living in accordance with Walter\u2019s final philosophical insight: \u201cFuck it Dude, let\u2019s go bowling.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Dr Matt Qvortrup 2017\n\nMatt Qvortrup is a dude, and Professor of Politics at Coventry University."}]}
