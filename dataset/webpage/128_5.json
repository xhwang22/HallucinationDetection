A verdict of forgery against a person or persons unknown was secured, with almost no dissentients, from the reviewers, the experts, the book-collecting world, and such laymen as were interested. The two comparatively junior \u201cattorneys\u201d who presented this case to the public (both of them members of the London rare-book trade) arraigned as an accessory after the fact the eminent and internationally respected book collector and bibliographer, Thomas J. Wise, who was then still alive (he died in 1937).\n\nMr. Graham Pollard and I did not, however, accuse Wise of being a witting accessory; nor did we suggest in print that he might actually have been himself the forger, in spite of our private conviction that he was. But during the succeeding decade others have taken a hand in the further investigation of this fascinating, and in its day sensational, case; and since some new evidence bearing on the responsibility for the forgeries is now being put before the public by Miss Fannie Ratchford in her new book, The Letters of Thomas J. Wise to John Henry Wrenn (Knopf), it may be opportune not only to comment on that evidence but to supply a few footnotes to the original indictment.\n\nBefore proceeding to consider the new evidence and reconsider the old, it will be well to recall briefly the contents and conclusions of An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets (Scribner), as our treatise was with calculated mildness entitled.\n\nThis book was a fully documented exposure of a group of more than fifty \u201cfirst editions\u201d of such eminent authors as Wordsworth, Tennyson, Dickens, Thackeray, the Brownings, Swinburne, George Eliot, William Morris, R. L. Stevenson, and Rudyard Kipling. These items were mostly of the \u201cprivately printed\u201d or the \u201cpre-first\u201d pamphlet type. They appeared in all the standard bibliographies and had been generally accepted for upwards of thirty years. Yet, in the light of the evidence assembled, more than thirty of them were shown to be forgeries and the status of the remainder to be open to considerable suspicion. As a result of our Enquiry, the pamphlets have all been reclassified in the British Museum Catalogue, whose editors are not prone to sudden enthusiasms.\n\nFormerly a director of Scribner\u2019s London house, JOHN CARTER is an Englishman now working in this country with the British Information Services. He prepared this article for the Atlantic under difficulties, for most of his files are buried \u2014 safely, he hopes \u2014 in a London cellar.\n\nWhat put Wise head and shoulders above any other recorded practitioner in fraudulent printing was his early realization (after a few experiments) that imitations of books are always discovered: that you must invent an edition if you are to avoid the ultimately fatal comparison with a genuine original. Wise was not a forger in the literary sense, like Chatterton or Ireland or the several fabricators of the lost books of Livy. His formula, as simple as it was effective, consisted in taking some suitable piece from a published volume, printing it in pamphlet form with an earlier date, and thus creating a first edition for the collectors\u2019 market.\n\nSo long as he was careful to print from the logical text; if the format and imprint were appropriate; if the hypothetical circumstances of publication and the position in its author\u2019s bibliography were plausible; and if he could then get his product onto the right shelves and into the right reference books, it was possible, as Wise proved in spite of mistakes, to get away with murder. His wide-ranging operations were only finally unmasked by the application to each pamphlet of such technical tests of its type design and paper content as were hardly to be anticipated in the 1890\u2019s, the decade of his main activity as a forger.\n\nIn 1934 we could not prove that Wise, who promoted, established, and marketed the forgeries, was also their actual creator. It was for this reason, and not from fear of the libel laws, as has been mistakenly or disparagingly suggested, that we did not accuse him of full responsibility. But any candidate for the honor had to pass a series of tests: \u2014\n\n1. The forger must have had a large and regular account, and preferably an account of a special character (for example, type-facsimile reprints), at Clay\u2019s, who had been proved to have printed the forgeries and had admitted it. Wise had such an account, as did no one else connected with the forgeries.\n\n2. Proof sheets, being rather special items, usually have a traceable origin. If they could be completely and correctly traced in the case of one or more of the forgeries, they must lead back to the forger. Proof sheets of several in fact were located and they all derived from Wise. He had supplied them, of course, with bogus pedigrees when selling them.\n\n3. The forger must originally have possessed all the copies of all the forgeries. Therefore, while possession of a single copy of one of them has no significance, and possession of a dozen very little, the greater the number and (more importantly) the greater the number of each that are found together, the nearer we are to their original source.\n\nPossession of a long run of titles might indicate nothing more than the owner\u2019s keenness on nineteenth-century first editions \u2014 there were twentyfour in the Lapham sale in New York in 1908 and Mr. John H. Wrenn owned a complete set; the British Museum possesses twenty-eight, and the Widener Library twenty-five or more. But the only people who had the forgeries in wholesale quantities were Herbert Gorfin and Thomas J. Wise. Gorfin was first Wise\u2019s office boy and then Wise\u2019s agent in his extensive rare-book dealing, before setting up in business for himself; and he had documentary evidence of the purchase of his holdings from Wise.\n\nSo quite apart from the cumulative evidence of Wise\u2019s vigorous promotion and, when necessary, defense of the forgeries (others helped to promote them), and of his wholesale dealing in them (others had them in duplicate and sold them, including dealers of the highest repute), there seemed to us no reasonable doubt that the man who passed those three tests must be the forger. That man was Wise; and his reactions to the exposure, both as first laid before him privately by us, eight months before our book came out, and after its publication, only confirmed our suspicions.\n\nThere were many, however, who found it impossible to accept even that breath of suspicion which undoubtedly lingers round the scrupulous phrases of the Enquiry. They could not believe that a man of Wise\u2019s prestige, eminence, academic honors, and (by that time) affluent circumstances would have done such a thing. They had forgotten, or never knew, that Wise, the substantial merchant, had been a rare-book dealer on the side all his life; that at the time he was laying the foundations of his splendid and expensive library he was earning only \u00a3500 a year (with a wife to support) and must have needed money badly; and finally (for I think this contributed to his motive) that aspiring bibliographers thrive on the announcement of new discoveries, of which the forgeries provided the most promising aspirant of his day with about half a dozen a year for a decade.\n\nWise discontinued production, as far as we know, about the turn of the century. He went out of wholesaling between 1909 and 1912, when he jobbed off to Gorfin, in a series of transactions, the main bulk of his stock. One reason for this move may well have been the decline in bibliophilic popularity of a number of the authors represented in the collection; and indeed the prices at which he cleared his shelves stamp this as a \u201cremaindering\u201d operation.\n\nBut even in the 1920\u2019s, a West End dealer once told me, you could always get a copy of the bogus \u201cReading\u201d edition of Mrs. Browning\u2019s Sonnets from the Portuguese from Wise\u2019s stock, by applying through Gorfin. And if Wise discovered that a friend had been taken in by the forgery of his forgery of Swinburne\u2019s Dead Love (1864), which always made him furious, he would give him (or sell him) a copy of the \u201cgenuine article.\u201d The perpetrator of this ironic trick, who produced an imitation of Wise\u2019s bogus original, has never been publicly identified.\n\n2\n\nGRAHAM POLLARD and I placed the full evidence for our exposure before Wise in October, 1933, in order to give him the opportunity to make a statement. He preferred to prevaricate to us while making every effort behind the scenes to mend his fences for the forthcoming challenge. Mutual friends of Wise and our publishers warned them, in the friendliest but weightiest way, against putting any confidence in these \u201cwild young men.\u201d (Wise was describing us in private correspondence as \u201csewer rats.\u201d) Mr. A. Edward Newton wrote me of the \u201chorrible shock to those of us who are and for years have been playing this book collecting game\u201d which he anticipated from \u201cthis horrible scandal,\u201d in which \u201cone of my oldest friends seems to be implicated.\u201d \u201cThe man,\u201d Mr. Newton continued, \u201cis almost a National figure.\u201d And so on.\n\nMore significantly, Wise bethought him of Gorfin, with whom he had been out of touch for a decade or more, and invited him to tea. He did not know that Gorfin had \u201ccome clean\u201d to us, and he broke the news, as he supposed, that there was \u201csome talk going on about some wrong things\u201d among the pamphlets of which he had sold Gorfin so large a number twenty years before. He suggested that it would be best for all concerned if he took back whatever Gorfin had left \u201cat their market value,\u201d which he estimated at a total of \u00a325. Gorfin did not dare tell Wise that we had already taken down his evidence, but he had enough sense to say he would think over Wise\u2019s offer. He came straight to my office, and he was still sweating slightly: Wise was an extremely formidable character, and although Gorfin was free, white, and fifty-five, in that choleric presence he was again the subservient office boy. We advised him to write the truth to Wise if he did not, as he insisted, dare to tell him to his face.\n\nHe did so, and the result was electric. A series of telegrams summoned him \u201cimmediately\u201d to 25 Heath Drive, where Wise offered to repay his whole original investment (\u00a3400, sixteen times the previous day\u2019s offer) in the now worthless pamphlets, on one condition: that Gorfin would endorse his intended statement that they had all come from Harry Buxton Forman, editor of Shelley and Keats, and a notable book collector of Wise\u2019s period, who died in 1917. Gorfin declined to support this story, which he then heard for the first time, and again left, promising to consider Wise\u2019s revised offer.\n\nWe advised him to accept it, accompanying his acceptance with a specific repudiation of the Buxton Forman story, which seemed to him (and to us) to be an alibi for which Wise needed any support he could beg, borrow, or in this case buy; and we recommended that he get a lawyer to draft the letter. He did so; and he got the \u00a3400 in exchange for his stock of the pamphlets, which Wise\u2019s lawyers, Messrs. Gedge, subsequently certified were burned in their presence. The repudiation of the Forman origin, however, availed Gorfin little, for Wise, both in interviews and letters to the press, made it his main alibi and cited Gorfin in support of it. This moved Gorfin to an indignant protest in the Times Literary Supplement (July 19, 1934).\n\nThe account which Wise had previously given Gorfin had already been retailed to us, as follows: that a certain agent had in the late 1880\u2019s offered to Robson \u2018s, antiquarian booksellers of Coventry Street, London, a large bundle of \u201cpublishers\u2019 waste,\u201d or \u201cremainders,\u201d deriving, he said, from the Edward Moxon sales (1873 and 1878) and possibly elsewhere; that Robson\u2019s had declined the lot but had suggested that Wise, who was known as a specialist in pamphlet first editions, might give him \u00a35 for it; and that Wise had done so, to the great profit of himself and, in a much lesser degree, of Gorfin. In short, Wise\u2019s commission agent and the subsequent owner of the remainder stock of the forgeries decisively contradicted the origin which Wise was endeavoring to establish for them.\n\nThe Wise alibi, however, received support from another and perhaps more telling quarter. The letter in the Times Literary Supplement to which Gorfin had replied (and to which I shall return in a moment) had been at least partially supported, in respect of the alleged Forman origin, by no other than Maurice Buxton Forman, son of the impugned scholar and bibliophile, and himself a distinguished authority on Keats and the bibliographer of George Meredith. His two letters \u2014 one to Wise, quoted in full by him, and the other direct to the editor \u2014 did not exactly confirm Wise\u2019s story that all the forgeries had derived from Forman; but they supported Wise in general and they described Forman\u2019s \u201csalting down\u201d of \u201cremainders\u201d and \u201cswaps\u201d with Wise in such a way as to indicate a state of affairs that was not inconsistent with Wise\u2019s account of the matter.\n\n3\n\nIN MAY, 1934, Wise, on the basis of our disclosure of our case to him six months earlier, had decided to anticipate publication of the Enquiry by a dogmatic letter to the Times Literary Supplement defending himself against the expected attack in respect of the Sonnets from the Portuguese, the most interesting of the forgeries (and the most lucrative, for it has brought as high as $1250 at auction). He had not understood clearly the technical tests of paper and type which we had applied to his productions, and his rebuttal was consequently rather an amateurish affair.\n\nThis and the other letter bore Wise\u2019s signature. But they had in fact been drafted by Mr. Frederick Page, of the Oxford University Press, who had constituted himself Wise\u2019s \u201ccounsel for the defense\u201d and who relied for \u201cadvice\u201d on two senior officers of that august institution. Mr. Page called on us in July, 1934, disclosed his status and his authorship of the letters to the Times, and demanded to see the affidavits which we had taken care to have Gorfin swear for those statements of his on which we had drawn for some of our evidence.\n\nSince Mr. Page seemed genuinely to believe in Wise\u2019s innocence, we told him enough, in addition to what we had printed, to convince him that he and his advisers were making themselves practically accessories after the fact by their assistance to Wise; and we warned him that if the defense persisted in their behind-the-scenes attempts to discredit Gorfin or continued to throw the whole responsibility for the forgeries on Forman without offering any evidence to support the alibi, we should be compelled to publish a few such damaging facts as Wise\u2019s attempt to suborn Gorfin\u2019s testimony.\n\nMr. Page took these warnings so much to heart and so little to head that he wrote Wise a letter not only abandoning his defense but conveying some threats which we did not make and were in no position to have made. He sent us a copy of this letter, and we had to point out its inaccuracy as a report of the interview; for Mr. Page had represented us as pro-Gorfin and pro-Forman, whereas we were in fact only concerned to prevent Mr. Page from assisting Wise to throw the blame, without citing any evidence, on one man who was dead and could not defend himself, and to discredit another whom we believed to be, however dubious a character in other respects, innocent of complicity in the forgeries. Mr. Page revised his report. But a copy of its inaccurate predecessor was sent (by Mr. Wise) to this country, and further copies of it were circulated by the recipient. Miss Ratchford quotes it in full in her book and draws a number of misleading conclusions from it, although she was advised in 1935 of its inaccuracy.\n\nWise had also prepared a full-length defense to be printed in the American Book Collector, a periodical edited by Mr. Charles Heartman. It is understood that Wise cabled instructions to suppress this \u201cdefense\u201d as a result of Mr. Page\u2019s representations; but he did not have, or did not exercise, any such control over Mr. Gabriel Wells, the prominent rarebook dealer in New York, who among other activities wrote a pamphlet in his defense called The Carter-Pollard Disclosures. This was considered by many to have done considerable disservice to the cause it was intended to support, and ironically enough it put one of its readers onto the track of a crucial piece of evidence against Wise, as we shall see.\n\nMessrs. Clay\u2019s own opinion as to the identity of the only one of their customers who was in a position to have the forgeries executed at their plant was expressed to us privately; and we did not print it since, besides being private, it was only an opinion. But Mr. Wilfred Partington, in a biographical study of Wise called Forging Ahead (New York, Putnam, 1939), printed a verbatim record of an interview between Wise and Mr. Cecil Clay, communicated to him by Mr. Clay, which included Wise\u2019s question: \u201cCan\u2019t you say you had nothing to do with these things?\u201d and Mr. Clay\u2019s reply: \u201cHow can I, when you know we printed them for you?\u201d An important contribution to the forgeries affair in general was made by Mr. Roland Baughman of the Huntington Library, who discovered two fresh additions to the group. Mr. Baughman found Tennyson\u2019s Bechet (1873) to be printed in the forger\u2019s favorite type; but, more significantly, he proved that in 1893 Wise had relapsed into the imprudence of imitating a genuine article. He faked copies of his avowed type-facsimile reprint of the recently discovered and very rare Alaric at Rome (1840, Matthew Arnold\u2019s first publication) and sold them as originals.\n\n4\n\nMOST of these developments had taken place in 1934. In March, 1935, I was invited to the library of Mr. Carl H. Pforzheimer, one of America\u2019s foremost book collectors, and offered the opportunity to inspect a document bearing on the origin of the forgeries, on condition that I should not publish it until its owner gave me permission. Mr. Pforzheimer explained that a reference in Mr. Gabriel Wells\u2019s polemical pamphlet to Harry Buxton Forman\u2019s authorship of an anonymous article entitled \u201cThe Building of the Idylls\u201d (of Tennyson) in Literary Anecdotes of the Nineteenth Century (edited by Wise and Robertson Nicoll), which we had mistakenly attributed to Wise, had reminded him that there survived in his possession the corrected proofs of this article, with some manuscript notes attached. These had been sold with the Forman Library. The manuscript notes, to which no great attention had previously been paid, were found to consist of several letters from Forman, one of the principal contributors to Literary Anecdotes, to its editor, Wise. Wise had commented interlinearly on a number of points in these letters and sent them back \u2014 hence their presence among Forman\u2019s effects, where they had fortunately escaped the notice of Wise and the executors when the library was sold to America.\n\nIt was my view, expressed then and on numerous subsequent occasions, that these documents ought to be published, for they threw a very interesting light on the relationship existing between Wise and Forman at a time when, as one among them proved, that relationship was particularly important to the elucidation of the chief unsolved problem in the forgeries investigation \u2014 namely, their authorship. Mr. Pforzheimer, for reasons which I have never understood, persisted year after year in declining either to publish them himself or to allow anyone else to do so.\n\nLater, Miss Ratchford was permitted to inspect the documents; but she also was unable to get leave to cite them. As this article goes to press, Mr. Pforzheimer is understood to be in process of printing them in the form of a brochure, and it is much to be hoped that they may now, after being withheld for ten years, be made available to scholars and students in their entirety.\n\nAs I must consider myself bound by the letter of my original undertaking, I cannot divulge the contents of these documents. But it will sufficiently indicate the interest of one of them to say that it convicts Wise in his own handwriting of the responsibility for one of the forgeries and includes Forman in the responsibility. Since the Enquiry established the homogeneity of the whole group, confession in respect of one forgery would almost automatically extend to them all, even if the pamphlet named were not, as fortunately it is, one of those printed in the forger\u2019s most frequently used font \u2014 the font peculiar to his printers, Messrs. Clay.\n\nThe fact of Forman\u2019s complicity in the production of at least one of the forgeries is no longer in doubt, but the degree and nature of his complicity in the affair as a whole remain speculative. Strong views on this point have at one time and another been adumbrated by Miss Fannie Ratchford, the wellknown Bront\u00eb expert and librarian of the University of Texas Rare Book Collections. These views have now been set forth in full, with a quantity of evidence, inferential and other, to support them, in the long introduction to her book, which is subtitled \u201cA further inquiry into the guilt of certain nineteenth century forgers.\u201d\n\nThis substantial volume also contains 460 pages of Wise\u2019s letters to his best customer, ranging from February 20, 1894, very early in their acquaintance, to May 13, 1911, the day of Wrenn\u2019s death, when the two had been close friends for a dozen years. If anyone doubts the extent of Wise\u2019s activities as a dealer in rare books, let him watch the man in action here: it is a full and a masterly performance, from which many professionals could glean a tip or two.\n\nAs Miss Ratchford points out, Wise on the whole served Wrenn shrewdly and efficiently, and many of her readers will wonder at the curious psychology of the man who could treat a customer and a friend so well 90 per cent of the time and swindle him so thoroughly the other 10 percent. But it is that other 10 per cent which is our concern here: for Wise sold Wrenn at various times copies of every one of his forgeries, duplicates of several, and proof sheets of two. And his technique of promoting these sales is both fascinating in itself and significant, because it presumably illustrates his methods with his many other customers. He raises expectations and recounts imaginary bargainings; he pulls off gratifying deals with nonexistent owners; and he often supplies plausible, but of course completely bogus, sources\u2014Walter Harrison, \u201cnephew of Moxon,\u201d Edward Carpenter, Frederick Crawley (Ruskin\u2019s old valet), Mrs. Dykes Campbell, R. H. Horne, Miss Tadema (daughter of the painter), a mysterious and almost certainly fictitious \u201cDr. Underwood,\u201d and several more.\n\nMiss Ratchford, in her Introduction, is naturally at pains to vindicate the main bulk of the Wrenn Library, since 1918 one of the prime ornaments of the library at Austin, from those suspicions which have attached to its contents since Wise, who supplied perhaps three quarters of the volumes, was exposed in 1934 as, if not actually a forger, at least a careless judge of a book\u2019s authenticity.\n\n5\n\nMiss RATCHFORD is mainly concerned, however, with a re-examination of the question of the responsibility for the group of forgeries then exposed. She does not dispute Wise\u2019s involvement, but she challenges what she rather sweepingly calls \u201cCarter and Pollard\u2019s conviction [my italics] that the whole burden and range of guilt for the forgeries was encompassed in Thomas J. Wise.\u201d Miss Ratchford does not cite any evidence for this conviction except the inaccurate (and known to her as inaccurate) Frederick Page letter to which I have already referred and in fact we had, I think, reasonably open minds all along.\n\nBut in 1934 we lacked evidence against anyone but Wise, and even against him we lacked enough to justify an accusation. Some evidence of possible connivance we subsequently discovered ourselves in respect of Clay\u2019s foreman, though it remains circumstantial. The Literary Anecdotes document provides evidence of complicity against Forman in addition to completing the case against Wise. But it remains for Miss Ratchford to convince her readers, as well as Messrs. Carter and Pollard, of the existence of what she calls (on page 77, before she has presented any of her evidence) \u201cthe WiseForman-Gosse workshop,\u201d and of the complicity of Herbert Gorfin.\n\nMiss Ratchford builds up her case against Forman with vigor. She cannot play the ace because Mr. Pforzheimer has it, and has no more allowed her to use it than anyone else; but she knows it is there, and if she can only refer to it in a sad and tantalizing footnote, that knowledge enables her to ruff and finesse elsewhere with a freedom which she may be thought to have exercised rather too enthusiastically. She does, however, make several telling points based on factors which Pollard and I insufficiently appreciated; and even if some of the clues lay in the hitherto locked files of the WiseWrenn correspondence, it must nonetheless be a legitimate satisfaction to Miss Ratehford to be able to establish (albeit with the final proof uncited) what she has long believed \u2014 that Forman was implicated.\n\nBut she has permitted herself a certain amount of special pleading in her case against him, particularly in respect of the sensibility to similarities or differences in commonplace contemporary type designs which can legitimately be postulated in the compilers of author bibliographies and the editors of volumes of poetry (such as Forman). She herself has not apparently appreciated one factor recognized in the Enquiry: that in the 1880\u2019s and 1890\u2019s the same specific founders\u2019 types, in the regular 10 and 12 point text sizes, were being used in dozens of printing shops all over England. It. is hardly reasonable to accuse Forman of failing to recognize one or anot her of half a dozen such fonts when he saw it again, while she herself argues as if she attached as much guilty significance to fonts common to Clay and many other printers as to the key hybrid font which was \u2019peculiar to Clay.\n\nMany a bibliographer examined the \u201cReading\u201d Sonnets with care, if not with skepticism. But it took the eagle eye of Stanley Morison, the most expert living analyst of type, to perceive for the first time in 1932 the significant features in its type; and it was only by what we described as \u201ca lucky accident\u201d that Pollard and I in 1933 identified that type in an honestly imprinted book and so traced it to its origin. Is it reasonable, then, to take for grant ed such microscopic discrimination as Miss Ratehford finds it incredible that Forman should not have possessed?\n\nThe employment, of this sort of special pleading, needless against Forman, whose complicity is certain, cannot but affect our readiness to accept Miss Ratchford\u2019s indictments against her other defendants, in respect of whom no such conclusive evidence as the Literary Anecdotes document exists. She applies to both Forman and Edmund Gosse (an equally distinguished litt\u00e9rateur and an equally keen, though much less accomplished, book collector) the argument that the inclusion, in their libraries of nineteenth-century first editions, of a substantial number of the forged pamphlets automatically implies a guilty knowledge of their character. \u201cThe Buxton Forman Library,\u201d Miss Ratchford writes, \u201ccontained thirty-two forgeries plus eleven duplicates. . . . Again, as in Gosse\u2019s case [Gosse had twenty], this is too large a number for so astute a bibliographer to have held innocently.\u201d Yet that reasonably astute institution the British Museum held more than Gosse, the Huntington and University of Texas Libraries more than Forman. Were these also guilty?\n\n6\n\nASIDE from this general, and as I think untenable, inference, Miss Ratchford\u2019s case against Gosse rests on two arguments. First, her belief, fortified by that of \u201ca score or more of persons accustomed to judging and identifying handwriting,\u201d that the correction mangoes for mangos in the margin of the proof sheets of the fraudulent E. B. Browning pamphlet The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim\u2019s Point is in Gosse\u2019s hand.\n\nWhen years ago Miss Ratchford, with the courtesy characteristic of the library at Austin, provided us with photostats of these proofs, we were after careful comparisons \u201cunable to identify\u201d the hand. Those photostats are in London; and on learning of Miss Ratchford\u2019s identification, I sent a cable to Graham Pollard, asking for a further scrutiny. I transcribe his reply (purged of one or two misprints pardonable in an un-bibliographical cable operator): \u201cMangoes hand unascribable but more like Wise than Gosse stop letters not Gosse type.\u201d Miss Ratehford has reproduced the relevant page in facsimile, with a selection of words from Edmund Gosse\u2019s regular handwriting alongside it; but her readers will note that the only professional expert whose opinion was sought, (the Chief of the Identification Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety) found the specimens \u201cinsufficient and not the proper standards upon which to base an opinion.\u201d Yet even if her readers follow Miss Ratchford in seeing a similarity (as I do not), they may think (as I do) that a single word, written in the careful but not always characteristic script normally adopted for proof corrections, in the margin of a book unconnected with Gosse by any other evidence, is an uncommonly slender thread with which to hang a man.\n\nMiss Ratchford\u2019s second specific charge against Gosse is that he fathered the story of the printing of Mrs. Browning\u2019s Sonnets knowing it to be false and \u201cdeliberately propagated it for the purpose of authenticating the forged pamphlet.\u201d She concludes that \u201cGosse divides the guilt with Wise, in fifty-fifty proportions.\u201d Gosse certainly introduced the bogus \u201cfirst edition\u201d of the Sonnets to the world, in 1894; and since he did not list his copy in the 1893 catalogue of his library it is reasonable to suppose that he had only just acquired it. In the Enquiry we inclined to the idea that the anonymous informant whom Gosse quoted as his authority for the whole story of Mrs. Browning\u2019s coy disclosure of her poems to her husband, of his reactions, and of the subsequent private printing, was Wise himself. But besides misreading some of the evidence then at our disposal, we had been unaware of certain letters written by Gosse in which, in replying to inquiries how the poems could have been printed in 1847 when letters to Browning himself show that they had not been disclosed to him till 1849, Gosse, abandoning the fictitious intermediary, had stated (letter to J. R. Burton, 1927) that he had had \u201cthe story regarding the authorship of those poems\" direct from Browning himself. If we had known of this evidence, we should have realized, as perhaps we ought to have done anyway, that it was necessary to distinguish two elements in Gosse\u2019s story, first printed in 1894, but best known in Critical Kit-Kats, 1896: first, the major part, the picturesque account of wife and husband and the love poems; secondly, the brief passage giving particulars of the alleged \u201cReading\u201d edition.\n\nThe first element, except for some differences of detail, is confirmed by several other accounts deriving direct from Robert Browning, The second element, being false, must have come from some other source. We thought, and I still think, it came from Wise, with a copy of the book (at a bargain price, no doubt) to provide ocular evidence; and was incorporated by Gosse in his main story without that \u201cmost careful investigation and certain proof\u201d to which Miss Ratchford justly thinks he was \u201cobligated,\u201d but which was not in fact characteristic of Gosse\u2019s work either as biographer or critic. I think Gosse was gulled by Wise, as I think he was in the matter of Swinburne\u2019s Dolores (see Enquiry, page 273), which Miss Ratchford, rather surprisingly, does not cite. I think that in later years, when he was cross-questioned by Lilian Whiting and J. R. Burton, he realized there was something seriously wrong with the book, and that he took the line of least resistance, brushing off his questioners with a rather high-handed statement of half-truths. Gosse defends (with perfect justice) \u201cthe story of the authorship of those poems\u201d (my italics): he says nothing about their printing as the \u201cReading\u201d Sonnets.\n\nThis must remain a question for the jury, and lack of space may have caused me to do some injustice to Miss Ratchford\u2019s argument in respect of this particular book. Though she does not cite any evidence for his connection with any other specific forgery, yet with her reference to the \u201cWise-Forman-Gosse workshop\u201d and her inferences from Gosse\u2019s holdings of the group of forgeries and the sum they netted him when his library was sold, she lines him up against the wall as a full-dress fellow conspirator. I propose, therefore, to put in evidence two letters: one from Wise to Gosse about selling him some of the forgeries; the other from Gosse to Wise acknowledging the gift of another forgery. The first is inserted in Gosse\u2019s copy of George Eliot\u2019s Brother and Sister, one of the forgeries, and is dated \u201cMon. 19th (no month) 1896.\u201d\n\nMY DEAR GOSSE,\n\nThanks for yours. I am so glad the little books please you. You shall most certainly have the \u201cAgatha\u201d [by George Eliot\u2014a forgery] as soon as I can find it. It is generally understood and I think rightly, that 25 copies of \u201cBrother and Sister [another forgery] were printed \u2014 as there were of \u201cAgatha\u201d \u2014 But I have no absolutely certain and unquestionable evidence to go on as I have in the case of \u201cAgatha.\u201d\n\nIt may interest you to know that the copy of \u201cLeoni\u201d [by Ruskin\u2014a forgery] I sent you was formerly the property of Fredk. Crawley, Mr. Ruskin\u2019s old factotum, now living at Oxford upon a pension of \u00a3100 a year allowed him from Brantwood. I looked him up in 1889 when I was hunting all round for material for my Ruskin Bibliography. I bought from him all the relics he had \u2014 books, letters, sketches, among other things this tract. Forgive this haste.\n\nYours\n\nT. J. WISE\n\nThe second letter came from the library of H. T. Butler, a friend of Wise, which was sold in 1934, and it was very kindly transcribed for me by its subsequent owner, Mr. Robert Metzdorf of Rochester, New York. It is dated from 17 Hanover Terrace, London, 27/10/09.\n\nHow generous and kind of you, my dear Wise, to give me this beautiful copy of the 1867 \u201cDolores\u201d [by Swinburne\u2014a forgery]. I am very grateful to you.\n\nHave you ever solved the mystery of its production? I have very minutely collated it with the text of 1866, and there are three extremely trifling variations. All three are errors in 1867 where 1866 was correct. I wonder whether Hotten [the publisher of Poems and Ballads (1866), whose imprint was quite plausibly used on the title page of the forgery (1867)] had any secret object in this production? Why he did it, in fact? It would be interesting to try and work out the causes of the reprint, which I suppose, from its present rarity, was very limited. . . .\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEDMUND GOSSE\n\nI will ask the impartial reader of these letters, which have only been preserved by accident and can hardly be supposed written \u201cfor the record,\u201d whether they read like those which fellow conspirators would exchange about the fruits of their conspiracy. If Gosse was a partner in the \u201cworkshop,\u201d why does he write in 1909 like a delighted amateur to a benevolent professional? Why is he treated in 1896 \u2014 the very year in which, according to Miss Ratchford, he was knowingly promoting one of the group \u2014 to a \u201cpromotion and sales\u201d letter which is the spitting image, in tone and tactics, of a score of those printed by Miss Ratchford to illustrate Wise\u2019s technique when selling forgeries to Wrenn?\n\n7\n\nTHE remaining object of Miss Ratchford\u2019s accusations is the late Herbert Gorfin, who has been referred to already in this article. Gorfin, who was Wise\u2019s office boy in the essential oil business and his agent and factotum in much of his book dealing, must have known very well that Wise was up to all the tricks of the trade (and to many which the antiquarian book trade at least would indignantly spurn). He himself acted as Wise\u2019s \u201cfront\u201d in deals with Wrenn and many another\u2014at Wise\u2019s office he was \u201cHerbert,\u201d and when Wise was writing to Wrenn in Chicago to offer a bargain he became \u201cGorfin, a small bookseller of Hither Green\u201d \u2014where, indeed, he operated a small mail-order business from his home address.\n\nBut there is a wide gap between lending oneself to shady deals and conspiracy to forge. Pollard and I, who had the advantage of confronting Gorfin in person with the facts, cross-questioning him and putting him through his evidence on oath, concluded that he did not know the pamphlets were forgeries. He was ten years old when the earliest appeared, and twenty-one when the last that we know of was produced (1899). Miss Ratchford believes that he must have known, then or later, what they were; but beyond general inferences of probability she adduces only one piece of evidence against him.\n\nThat evidence is a receipt purporting to be signed by Walter Harrison (\u201cMoxon\u2019s nephew\u201d) and accompanying a copy of the fraudulent Tennyson\u2019s Morte D\u2019Arthur (1842) sold by Wise to Wrenn, which Miss Ratchford believes was written by Gorfin, using a sharp pen to disguise his hand. She reproduces this document in facsimile, along with other examples of undoubted Gorfin script, and I dare say most of her readers will concur in her identification. But Wise provided bogus origins for many other books he sold besides the forgeries, and Gorfin certainly knew it. So that even if the writing were agreed to be his, it would not necessarily imply a knowledge that this particular book was a forgery, or do anything to promote Gorfin from his present grade of jackal into that of fellow conspirator.\n\nIn conclusion: the Pforzheimer document will be seen, when its owner finally publishes it, to be a cardinal addition to the evidence in the forgeries affair. It is highly satisfactory that Wise left, in his own hand, even summary evidence of his guilt; and the inclusion of Forman in that short but sufficient sentence confirms some at least of the suspicions which Miss Ratchford has long held and which she has so amply expounded in her book. But if that document had been published in Wise\u2019s lifetime, it might, conceivably, have extorted a full confession from him. And at the least it must have elicited some statement, some addition, from the best possible authority, to the story of the most ingeniously conceived, the best executed, and the most successful fraud in the history of book collecting.\n\nMeanwhile Miss Ratchford has reopened the whole case with some new evidence and a salvo of new accusations. I am not myself convinced by all her deductions; and in the complicity of Forman there remains much uncertainty as to its degree and its extent. But even if her readers now conclude, or further discoveries should suggest, that the forgeries were the work of a ring, I shall be much surprised if Thomas J. Wise has to be dethroned from his commanding position as the master mind."}, {"url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1226927/Former-British-MEP-jailed-fiddling-39-000-expenses-spent-fine-wine-new-car.html", "page_content": "Former British MEP jailed for fiddling \u00a339,000 expenses he spent on fine wine (and a second-hand Peugeot 206)\n\n\n\nMEP Tom Wise was jailed for two years after spending \u00a339,000 of taxpayer's money on fine wines and even an old car\n\nA former MEP who fiddled \u00a339,000 of expenses was jailed for two years yesterday.\n\nTom Wise, 61, who represented UKIP before becoming an independent, spent 13 months channelling the money into a bank account he secretly controlled.\n\nHe pretended the \u00a33,000 ' secretarial assistance allowance' he received every month was for his researcher Lindsay Jenkins, 62.\n\nBut London's Southwark Crown Court heard he spent most of it on a love of fine wine, clearing credit card debts, buying a car and funding party political activities.\n\nWhen his dishonesty was exposed he did his best to worm his way out of trouble by repaying a large slice of the cash.\n\nProsecutor Mark Fenhalls said that, but for the discovery, Wise - thought to be the first British politician to be jailed for fiddling expenses - could have pocketed up to \u00a3180,000.\n\nWise, of Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, who left UKIP after the scandal, originally denied false accounting between October 14 and November 16, 2004. But during his trial he confessed.\n\n\n\nHe said he was entirely to blame and Jenkins, whom he had asked to sign blank documents, was innocent.\n\nAs a result his former researcher, of Queens Club Gardens, Barons Court, west London, who had also been on trial, was cleared of the false accounting charge as well as an allegation of using criminal property.\n\n'The position which you held as an elected representative was one of high privilege and trust. This offence involved a prolonged gross breach of that trust.\n\n'It is no exaggeration to say that you had hardly got your feet beneath your desk as an MEP before you were planning to defraud the parliament to which you were elected and the people you were elected to serve.\n\n'This was very deliberate and blatant dishonesty. You did not fall into this offence as a result of some unfortunate combination of unforeseen circumstances which happened to suddenly present you with temptation.\n\nDisgraced former MEP Tom Wise, pictured fourth from left, is swapping his champagne lifestyle for a prison cell after his expenses fraud was exposed\n\n'You knew the system of expenses inside out and this was a claim you devised and planned with some care.\n\n'Moreover, it inevitably involved implicating another - your co-defendant Lindsay Jenkins, a political commentator of some distinction, who has herself faced trial, but who has now been acquitted.'\n\nAs Wise's wife, Janet, watched from the public gallery, the judge continued: 'This offence came to an end not because your conscience got the better of you, but only because your activities were exposed by the press, after which time you terminated the claim and repaid your ill-gotten gains in the hope of avoiding prosecution.'\n\nBut, he said, Wise's deceit did not stop there, because when the European parliamentary authorities launched an investigation, 'you attempted to cover up your dishonesty with yet more lies, lies not only told to several people who obviously trusted you and wanted to believe you, but also to the European Parliament itself'.\n\nJanet Wise, the wife of former MEP Tom Wise, outside Southwark Crown Court this afternoon\n\n'These lies, which included you had not spent any of the monies over and above those paid to Mrs Jenkins, led to you being discharged from all accusations ... and ultimately a letter to you from the director general of finances to the same effect.\n\n'It was only when it was discovered you had, in fact, been using this money, for example, to buy a car that this investigation was placed in the hands of the UK authorities and mounted in earnest.'\n\nThe judge said that while Wise had the decency to eventually own up, his guilty pleas came against a background of overwhelming evidence that, if anything, 'was getting yet stronger still'.\n\n'Of course, a person with your background and in your exalted position does not have to be told you were behaving dishonestly.\n\n\n\nYou knew perfectly well from the very moment you completed these forms and received the first expense payment you were acting dishonestly.'\n\nRejecting defence claims that Wise had been 'bamboozled' by an 'elasticity' in the expenses system others had also 'played fast and loose' with, he told the former MEP: 'This fraud was so blatant, I do not believe for one moment you were disadvantaged in understanding the system or that this fraud should be seen as falling into some grey area which you might not have fully comprehended.'\n\nThe judge said that while he accepted Wise had done 'good work on behalf of the community', that he was 'devastated and humiliated', and that it was a sad day to see someone with 'so much brought so low... only a substantial custodial sentence is appropriate for a serious fraud of this kind committed as it was by an elected public servant'.\n\nHe added that in addition to jail, he would also have to pay \u00a330,000 towards prosecution costs.\n\nDisgraced Wise, smartly dressed in a dark grey suit and sporting a poppy in his buttonhole, was then led to the cells.\n\nThe court heard Wise was originally elected as East of England MEP for Ukip in June 2004.\n\nBut with the discovery of his dishonesty, the party withdrew the whip, forcing him to become an independent. He did not stand for re-election in June.\n\nThe barrister said the defendant turned to crime shortly after his win at the polls five years ago and took the first steps to becoming 'the first MEP who has been convicted of fraud associated with parliamentary allowances'.\n\n'Like all MEPs, he became entitled to various allowances given by the European Parliament which were intended to assist him in discharging his work, both for the European Parliament and for the particular committee he sat on, the Culture, Media and Sport Committee,' said Mr Fenhalls.\n\n'One of the allowances he was entitled to was the secretarial assistance allowance. That is ... at the heart of this case.'\n\nHe said Wise was 'thoroughly familiar' with the expenses system and knew the rules.\n\nDespite this, just a few months after starting his new job, Wise handed in two documents to support his application for the payment, which was governed by European parliamentary rules forbidding staff wages going to MEPs.\n\nAlthough both defendants signed the documents, it was now accepted they were blank when handed to Jenkins.\n\n'The application was for \u00a33,000 per month to be paid out by the European Parliament for the period October 1 2004 to September 30 2009, a potential total over the five years of \u00a3180,000.'\n\nMr Fenhalls told jurors Wise pretended the money would be paid directly to Jenkins.\n\n'However, the truth was the payments were made directly to a bank account controlled exclusively by Mr Wise.\n\n'One of the cardinal rules that had been in place since 1996 was that MEPs should not receive funds that were to be paid out for staff costs.'\n\nOut of the money he received, Mrs Jenkins was paid \u00a3500 a month for work it was now accepted she had carried out.\n\nThe barrister said that when the alleged fraud was revealed in the press, the claims quickly stopped and Mr Wise immediately repaid \u00a319,000. A further \u00a36,245 followed.\n\nBut that was simply 'an attempt to limit the damage once he had been caught.\n\nPolice eventually found he had blown \u00a33,500 of taxpayers' cash on 19 cases of fine wine - along with \u00a31,000 of his own money - used \u00a36,800 clearing credit card bills and squandered \u00a36,400 on a secondhand Peugeot 206.\n\nA further \u00a31,200-plus went on Ukip leaflet drops, \u00a3800 to pay party printing costs, while 'just shy' of \u00a35,000 ended up helping Mrs Jenkins publish a book she had written called Disappearing Britain.\n\nJonathan Fisher, Wise's privately-funded QC, told the court: 'To describe this case as a disaster for Thomas Wise does not begin to convey the hidden anguish, humiliation and distress that Mr Wise and his wife Janet are experiencing at this very moment.\n\n'It is truly catastrophic for him, a rising star in a new political party beginning to win seats in national elections who, through an act of folly, now sits in the dock, secured by a prison officer, his reputation and integrity in tatters.\n\n'The pathos of his plight is palpable for all to feel and to see.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://law.justia.com/cases/massachusetts/court-of-appeals/volumes/39/39massappct922.html", "page_content": "COMMONWEALTH vs. THOMAS WISE.\n\n39 Mass. App. Ct. 922\n\nOctober 6, 1995\n\nNona E. Walker, Committee for Public Counsel Services, for the defendant.\n\nEric Neyman, Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.\n\nAll told, six children testified that the defendant, Thomas Wise, had molested them sexually. He was found guilty by a jury of multiple indictments of rape and abuse of a child without force, lascivious acts on a child under sixteen, crimes against nature, one indictment of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and, for good measure, two indictments of cruelty to animals. [Note 1] A judge of the Superior Court imposed sentences requiring seventy-two years of prison time. The appeal asserts error in: (1) the exclusion of evidence of complaints of sexual abuse made by three of the child witnesses against two other men; and (2) the inclusion of certain testimony by mothers of the victims and the inclusion of certain medical records. We affirm.\n\n1) Exclusion of evidence of other accusations claimed to be false. Four children (two girls and two boys) of the defendant testified that their father had involved them in acts of fellatio, digital and penile penetration, and acts involving the family dog and cat. Two friends of theirs (two boys) gave testimony of sexual molestation that had been visited upon them by the defendant. The defendant sought to inquire into complaints that three of his children had made about sexual abuse by two mentally retarded men who had lived next door to them in Reading. Although the children had not retracted those complaints, the authorities had not initiated a prosecution based on them. The defense position was that failure to prosecute was so indicative of the falsity of the complaints that the defense was entitled to inquire into them under the principle articulated in Commonwealth v. Bohannon, 376 Mass. 90 , 93-95 (1978). That decision carved an exception to the general inadmissibility of other accusations of sexual misconduct made by a victim witness if there was an offer of proof of evidence that an accusation made at another time had been false. The exception, however, is a narrow one. See Commonwealth v. Sperrazza, 379 Mass. 166 , 169 (1979); Commonwealth v. Hicks, 23 Mass. App. Ct. 487 , 489 (1987); Commonwealth v. Rathburn, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 699 , 710 (1988); Commonwealth v. Nichols, 37 Mass. App. Ct. 332 , 335 (1994), and cases cited. The false accusation may be prior to or later than the accusation that is being tried, but the collateral false one must have been made close in time to the primary one. Id. at 335-336.\n\nTo open the gate to cross-examination, the evidence of falsity of an accusation must be solid, as when the accusing witness has recanted the\n\nPage 923\n\nother allegation. See Commonwealth v. Bohannon, 376 Mass. at 91; Commonwealth v. Nichols, 37 Mass. App. Ct. at 334. Whether evidence of false accusation has sufficient weight to be the basis of a line of cross-examination of the victim witness is a question about which the trial judge has discretion (to be soundly exercised). See Commonwealth v. Hicks, 23 Mass. App. Ct. at 491; Commonwealth v. Rathburn, 26 Mass. App. Ct. at 710-711. When, as here, the victim witness has not recanted, the circumstance that charges were not pressed is an insufficient basis for inferring that they were false. Commonwealth v. Hicks, 23 Mass. App. Ct. at 491. The judge did not abuse his discretion in denying defense counsel the right to cross-examine those of the defendant's children who had made them about their accusations against the two neighbors. Parenthetically, one of the defendant's children had made and then recanted an earlier charge of sexual abuse by the defendant, and the judge permitted cross-examination about that earlier claim of molestation.\n\n2. Admission of testimony by mothers about the physical condition of the victims and of medical records. During the course of their testimony, the mother of the defendant's children and the mother of their friends testified that their children suffered from inflamed anuses, penises, or vaginas and apparent pain in moving their bowels to a degree that was sufficiently disturbing so that each of the mothers sought medical advice. The defense attack on that testimony of the children had been that it was fabricated. To corroborate the stories of the children, the government offered observations of the mothers about the physical condition of their children. The testimony of the mothers permitted the jury to draw an inference that abrasive contact with the children's genitalia and anuses had occurred. The defense insisted that the observations of the parents ought not to be received in the absence of expert evidence to interpret their statements. What a witness observes, however, may generally be received and whether that supports what the party offering it seeks to prove depends on the weight the finder of fact wishes to ascribe to the uninterpreted evidence. See Olson v. Ela, 8 Mass. App. Ct. 165 , 167 (1979). To shore up the testimony of the mothers -- challenged by the defense as contrived and possibly vengeful -- that the children did, indeed, suffer from rashes, irritation, and soreness, the Commonwealth offered the children's medical records. The defense objected that the records ought not to be received without an expert to interpret them and that it was unfair to leave to the jury what might have caused the children's inflamed vaginas, penises, anuses, and so forth. The trial judge ruled that the medical records might be received in evidence and invited the defense to bring forward, when trial resumed the following Monday, a doctor whose testimony might suggest to the jury that the medical records had very little to say about whether the children had suffered sexual molestation. The defendant did not present such an expert.\n\nPage 924\n\nDetermining whether evidence is relevant is another example of a decision left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and the judge's resolution is respected by an appellate court in the absence of palpable error. Commonwealth v. Young, 382 Mass. 448 , 462-463 (1981). Commonwealth v. Marangiello, 410 Mass. 452 , 456 (1991). Commonwealth v. Souza, ante 103, 108 (1995). We think the judge could reasonably admit the mothers' observations as tending to corroborate the children's testimony and the medical records as corroborative of what the mothers had testified to about the physical conditions their respective children had exhibited. The records, except for one, were not prejudicial or suggestive on the subject of sexual abuse. The subject was not mentioned. In the main, the records dealt with routine childhood complaints, such as ear infections and, in all events, expressed no opinions that the children were being abused.

City Council, from which he has been suspended for the last 17 months.\n\nOf the 19 counts against Ridley-Thomas, jurors found him guilty of seven: conspiracy, bribery, honest services mail fraud and four counts of honest services wire fraud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs U.S. District Judge Dale S. Fischer read the jury\u2019s decision aloud Thursday morning, Ridley-Thomas sat quietly beside his defense attorneys.\n\nThe split, according to the jury foreperson, stemmed from differing views among the panel about what conduct in the case was unlawful.\n\n\u201cThere was dishonesty. There was a lack of transparency,\u201d said Kirsi Kilpelainen, 35, a San Luis Obispo resident who served as foreperson for the jury. But she said there was disagreement over whether the various benefits Ridley-Thomas\u2019 son received \u2014 a scholarship, job and admission to USC \u2014 amounted to a crime.\n\nUltimately, the foreperson said, the funneling of a $100,000 donation from Ridley-Thomas\u2019 campaign committee through USC to a nonprofit led by the politician\u2019s son persuaded jurors to convict.\n\n\u201cIt ended up being the $100,000 donation,\u201d Kilpelainen said, explaining that it was clear Ridley-Thomas directed the movement of funds, and that the funneling of money came in advance of a summer 2018 vote by Ridley-Thomas to extend a contract with USC.\n\nU.S. Atty. Martin Estrada addresses reporters after a jury convicted longtime L.A. politician Mark Ridley-Thomas of bribery, conspiracy and honest services fraud. (Luis Sinco/Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe verdict is the most high-profile in a string of victories for public corruption prosecutors in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in L.A. That squad secured guilty pleas from two other L.A. City Council members and won the conviction of U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry in an illegal campaign contribution case. The team has also unraveled a corruption scheme involving L.A.\u2019s Department of Water and Power and sent a wealthy Beverly Hills developer to prison for bribery in a case involving leases with L.A. County government.\n\nThursday\u2019s verdict also validates the work of FBI Special Agent Brian Adkins, a well-regarded public corruption specialist whose investigative steps were repeatedly attacked by Ridley-Thomas\u2019 defense attorneys as they sought to sow doubt in jurors\u2019 minds about the case presented to them.\n\n\u201cThe people that elected Mark Ridley-Thomas were entitled to honest services. They were entitled to have him not act in a corrupt way,\u201d said Martin Estrada, the U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, in a brief news conference outside the downtown L.A. federal courthouse. \u201cBut instead of doing so, he engaged in political corruption \u2014 and that\u2019s why he\u2019s been convicted today.\u201d\n\nL.A. Mayor Karen Bass, a longtime political ally and friend of Ridley-Thomas, called the verdict \u201ca sad day for Los Angeles.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I feel that sadness personally,\u201d said Bass. \u201cFor decades, Mark Ridley-Thomas has been a champion for our city, a civil rights activist, a thought leader and a policymaker who made a real impact on the city.\u201d\n\nRidley-Thomas, who left the courthouse Thursday without speaking to reporters, is scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 14. A representative for his defense team confirmed that he would appeal.\n\nTo convict Ridley-Thomas, prosecutors and the FBI pored over reams of emails, phone records and internal USC documents to stitch together a timeline of the lawmaker\u2019s dealings with Marilyn Flynn, the former dean of USC\u2019s social work program.\n\nProsecutors outlined a conspiracy that began around May 2017, when Ridley-Thomas\u2019 son Sebastian Ridley-Thomas, then a member of the state Assembly, began expressing interest in attending USC\u2019s graduate social work program.\n\nIn emails, Flynn expressed eagerness to enroll Sebastian, describing her plan to give him free tuition and saying she did \u201cthe same for Karen Bass \u2014 full scholarship for our funds.\u201d\n\nProsecutors found the email about Bass a brazen example of using scholarships as a means to secure government contracts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science what Marilyn Flynn is looking for here,\u201d Assistant U.S. Atty. Lindsey Greer Dotson told jurors in her closing argument last week. Bass was never charged, but as a member of Congress representing L.A. at the time, she had sponsored a bill that, if passed, would have expanded federal funding to social work schools.\n\nTo show Ridley-Thomas\u2019 role, prosecutors zeroed in on a June 2017 meeting he had with Flynn. At the time, Ridley-Thomas was a member of the Board of Supervisors, and the pair discussed Flynn\u2019s requests for county business. Flynn later memorialized their meeting in a letter she had hand-delivered to the politician\u2019s office.\n\nTo prosecutors, the letter was the blueprint for the conspiracy \u2014 proof that Sebastian\u2019s path at USC was discussed in the same breath as Flynn\u2019s wish list for government business.\n\nA plan marked by \u201cwinks and nods\u201d between Flynn and Ridley-Thomas turned to \u201cpushes and shoves\u201d in December 2017, prosecutors said. That month, a sexual harassment investigation into Sebastian Ridley-Thomas was launched by lawyers at the state Capitol.\n\nWith scandal threatening the Ridley-Thomas political machine, prosecutors argued that he leaned on Flynn to supply Sebastian with extraordinary benefits and a \u201clanding spot\u201d after resigning from the Legislature under the false pretense of health problems.\n\nAmong the benefits: admission and a full scholarship before he had even finished his application; a part-time professor\u2018s position; and later, the routing of $100,000 through USC to the Policy Research and Practice Initiative, a nonprofit run by the younger Ridley-Thomas.\n\nCalifornia Ridley-Thomas corruption case built on emails: \u2018MRT is really trying to deliver here\u2019 Federal prosecutors finished presenting evidence in their corruption case Friday against suspended Los Angeles City Councilmember Mark Ridley-Thomas, clearing the way for the powerful lawmaker\u2019s defense to share its side of the case next week.\n\nThrough the duration of the alleged conspiracy, Mark Ridley-Thomas voted on three agenda items before the Board of Supervisors that directly related to USC\u2019s social work program and were coveted by Flynn. Her reactions to these votes were among the strongest evidence against Ridley-Thomas.\n\n\u201cI met with the supervisor recently,\u201d Flynn told a colleague before one vote, adding, \u201cThis is exactly what I had hoped would happen.\u201d\n\nDespite the elaborate sequence of events, the jury foreperson, Kilpelainen, indicated that the panel could not agree unanimously that Ridley-Thomas was involved in all of the benefits his son received.\n\n\u201cMany of the jurors believed that there was no connection between Mark Ridley-Thomas and the USC things, and it came back to the $100,000 donation,\u201d Kilpelainen said.\n\nThe funneling of $100,000 from one of Ridley-Thomas\u2019 campaign committees through USC, and then to the United Ways of California, which was sponsoring his son\u2019s nonprofit, was documented in a series of emails by him and Flynn.\n\nProsecutors contended the circuitous route was to disguise that Ridley-Thomas\u2019 campaign committee was the true source of the funds, and that neither United Ways of California \u2014 nor the public at large \u2014 would know that the money supporting Sebastian Ridley-Thomas\u2019 nonprofit originated from his father.\n\nThe foreperson said one email in particular stood out: a May 2018 message from Ridley-Thomas in which he shared bank wiring instructions with Flynn, the USC dean, and showed him directing the flow of money. He urged the dean to \u201cact with dispatch\u201d so that an employee could be hired at the nonprofit, according to the email.\n\nAfter the $100,000 had arrived, Flynn emailed Mark Ridley-Thomas, \u201cThis one was easy. Sort of.\u201d\n\nWithin days, Flynn also told colleagues that she had secured the renewal and amendments to a contract with L.A. County for remote mental health treatment, telling a colleague she had to do a \u201cfavor\u201d to get it done.\n\n\u201cShe knew: Mission accomplished,\u201d Asst. U.S. Atty. Michael J. Morse told jurors last week.\n\nThat the jury based their convictions on the routing of $100,000 through USC suggests defense attorneys were successful at chipping away at much of prosecutors\u2019 framing of the evidence.\n\nThe defense had emphasized that Sebastian Ridley-Thomas had resigned from the Assembly for legitimate health reasons, not a looming sexual harassment inquiry.\n\nDefense attorneys also pointed out Sebastian\u2019s qualifications: that he had been thrice elected to the Legislature before the age of 30 and had sponsored dozens of bills in Sacramento \u2014 making him a shoo-in for admission, a scholarship and a job at USC.\n\nNext, the defense team attempted to establish that there was no need for or upside to bribing Ridley-Thomas. They emphasized that the lawmaker\u2019s longstanding and public support for the key votes in the case all aligned with the politician\u2019s key policy goals.\n\nThe defense wanted jurors to contemplate why anyone, let alone a social work dean, thought they had to offer bribes to accomplish these measures.\n\nRidley-Thomas did not testify, and throughout the trial, he quietly watched the proceedings and occasionally gestured to dozens of supporters who packed the courtroom each day. As jury deliberations continued this week, he greeted and hugged friends and former staffers waiting in the halls of the 1st Street U.S. Courthouse.\n\nFlynn, who was ousted as dean of USC\u2019s social work program in 2018, pleaded guilty in September to one count of bribery. She did not testify during Ridley-Thomas\u2019 trial and is awaiting sentencing.\n\nThe criminal case grew out of the tumultuous summer of 2018 at USC, when a sexual misconduct scandal involving a former campus gynecologist roiled the university and prompted sweeping changes in leadership.\n\nAbout this time, a staffer in USC\u2019s social work school raised concerns about the outgoing donation of $100,000. The whistleblower\u2019s report led to an internal investigation and ultimately a criminal referral to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in L.A. about the suspicious donation, later revealed by The Times.\n\nIn this period, developer and former L.A. mayoral candidate Rick Caruso had stepped in as chair of USC\u2019s trustees and led much of the university\u2019s day-to-day operations. He later touted the handling of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint as a sign of reforming the university\u2019s ethics.\n\nOn Thursday, Caruso said in a statement, \u201cI was disturbed when I first learned of this and grateful to the jury for carefully weighing the evidence and then doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nTimes staff writers Julia Wick and David Zahniser contributed to this report."}], "Tom Wise was sentenced to two years in prison in 2008.": [{"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tom-wise-former-mep-jailed-for-pound39000-expenses-fraud-ms6dm7hh78g", "page_content": "A former MEP was sentenced to two years in prison today after fiddling his expenses to channel \u00a339,000 into a secret bank account.\n\nTom Wise, 61, who was elected for Ukip but lost the party whip when his offences emerged, accumulated the money over 13 months, spending it on a new car and fine wines.\n\nSponsored\n\nWise becomes the second of the party\u2019s 12 MEPs elected in 2004 to go to prison.

A former police officer, he was elected in 2004 as a member of the UK Independence Party but later had the whip withdrawn when allegations of misuse of parliamentary expenses surfaced in The Sunday Telegraph. Following an inquiry carried out by the European Anti-Fraud Office, Wise was formally charged with false accounting and money laundering by Bedfordshire Police. After initially pleading not guilty, he admitted the charges and was sentenced in November 2009 at Southwark Crown Court to a two-year term of imprisonment. He is thought to be the first MEP to be jailed for expenses fraud. Sentencing him, the judge said that Wise had engaged in \"deliberate and blatant dishonesty\" and had set about to defraud the European Parliament almost as soon as he was elected.\n\nEarly career\n\nBorn in Bournemouth, Wise attended Bournemouth School between 1959 and 1965, before completing a Diploma in Public Speaking in 1967. He served with Dorset Police before embarking on a career in the food distribution and processing industry. He became the UK Managing Director of a German herbs and spices company. From 1981 to 1989 he was a member of the Liberal Party.\n\nUKIP\n\nWise joined the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) in 1997. He served as office manager to Jeffrey Titford MEP, during this period he worked on the rules governing MEPs' expenses and gained an expertise in the system which he would later use to his advantage. He was the fourth-placed candidate on UKIP's candidate list in for the European Parliament elections in 1999, and also stood as the party's candidate in the 1997, 2001 and 2005 general elections for the South West Bedfordshire constituency. In the 2005 general election, he came fourth with 4.2% of the votes cast.\n\nHe was elected as an MEP for UKIP in the 2004 European elections. He was UKIP's official spokesman on the Culture, Youth, Media and Sport Committee until his suspension by the party in February 2007. In his first speech to the Committee on 4 October 2004, Wise criticised the proposed budget and drew allusions with Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. In his maiden speech to the Parliament on 16 December 2004, Wise blamed the European Union for creating unacceptable conditions for the transit of animals around Europe. Wise also spoke out against the Proposed directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions\n\nIndependent\n\nAfter losing the party whip in March 2007, Wise continued as an Independent within UKIP's Independence/Democracy parliamentary grouping pending the outcome of the fraud inquiry.\n\nDuring his time as an MEP, Wise disputed the genuine nature of the September 11th attacks. and labelled Russia-based businessman Alisher Usmanov, who is a shareholder of Arsenal F.C. a \"gangster and racketeer\"\n\nFollowing the decision to press criminal charges against him, Wise decided not to contest the 2009 European Parliament elections. He has however said that he wants to stand as an MP in the 2010 General Election.\n\nExposure\n\nOn 23 October 2005, a reporter for the Sunday Telegraph, Daniel Foggo, published an article accusing Wise of claiming \u00a336,000 a year from the European Parliament in the name of his researcher, Lindsay Jenkins, while only passing on about a sixth of that amount to her. According to now-repealed Rules governing the payment of expenses and allowances to Members of the European Parliament, MEPs could claim up to \u00a3125,000 per year for assistants' wages, but this money must be paid either directly to the employees or to a third-party agent. The rules did not allow the funds to pass directly through the hands of MEPs themselves.\n\nFoggo later reported that Wise had supplied the European Parliament's Payments Office with a \"contract\" including her name and details, which stipulated that the \u00a336,000 allowance should be paid into an account named \"Stags\". This account, held with the Co-operative Bank, was in fact Wise's own business account and its full name was \"T Wise trading as Stags\". The actual agreement between Wise and Jenkins stated that she would receive monthly \"retainer\" payments of \u00a3500 for advice and statistical research, with any extra work to be paid on top. Bank documents obtained by Foggo showed that between November 2004 and October 2005, Wise had paid \u00a339,100 to this account, out of which Jenkins received \u00a313,555. These funds were the only monies coming into the account. In another breach of the payment regulations, some of the \u00a313,555 paid to Jenkins represented work done on behalf of other UKIP members, including party leader Nigel Farage who had agreed to fund the publication of a eurosceptic pamphlet by Jenkins. A further \u00a319,000 was transferred from the account, some of which to pay off credit cards.\n\nOn 29 October, Wise admitted to breaching the rules and, to head off a scandal, agreed to repay \u00a325,230. An internal UKIP inquiry was launched after the Parliament became aware of the affair, but no action was taken and the results of the investigation were kept secret. As Daniel Foggo later reported, UKIP's former leader, Roger Knapman, halted the inquiry after it uncovered serious wrongdoing, believing that the European Parliament would clear Wise. Farage told reporter Daniel Foggo that Wise \"had committed a simple, silly error by making himself a \"paying agent\" for his own staff.\"\n\nSuspension from UKIP\n\nOn 23 February 2007, party sources at UKIP discovered that the European Parliament had passed the affair to OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office. A UKIP meeting was convened in Brussels on 28 February 2007 at which Wise formally admitted to having spent \u00a36,500 from the allowance on a dark green Peugeot 406 which he still drove, but refused to disclose how he had spent a further \u00a313,000 of the funds. After a heated discussion, a decision was taken to remove the whip; both Knapman and fellow MEP Mike Nattrass challenged the decision and threatened to reconsider their futures in the party. Farage emphasised that, if cleared by the OLAF investigation, Wise would be welcomed back into the party, adding that he thought \"there is a great deal of public sympathy for us.\" Wise was however suspended by the party.\n\nFollowing his suspension, Wise spent a further \u00a38,000 of the allowance in legal fees in contemplation of a libel case against Greg Lance-Watkins who had published claims on the Internet relating to Wise's activities. No action was ultimately brought against Lance-Watkins.\n\nNews of the World sting\n\nIn May 2008, the News of the World published details of a sting involving Tom Wise. A female reporter posing as a work experience student recorded Wise brazenly admitting in a Belgian bar that he had little idea of what his job as a Member of the European Parliament entailed, adding \"I don't know what an MEP's job is. No one's ever given me a job description. I've no idea what an MEP should or shouldn't do. So you make it up as you go along.\" He boasted of fiddling the Parliament's expenses system, stating \"Yes, I am milking the system [...] I have a simple philosophy. You and your parents are paying for me. Sorry, tough!\" The newspaper used its leading article to call for a change in the rules governing MEPs' expenses following the expos\u00e9.\n\nArrest and charges\n\nOn 20 June 2008, Wise was arrested by Bedfordshire Police's Economic Crime Unit on suspicion of making a false instrument, obtaining money by deception by transfer and converting criminal property. He was bailed until 29 October. Bedfordshire Police made the arrest after having been contacted by OLAF.\n\nOn 20 April 2009 the Crown Prosecution Service advised Bedfordshire Police to charge both Wise and Jenkins with one count each of false accounting contrary to the Theft Act 1968 and one count each of money laundering contrary to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Both were scheduled to appear before the City of Westminster Magistrates' Court on in April 2009 to face the charges. Wise indicated that he was innocent and would fight the charges which carry a maximum 14-year jail term. He is thought to be the first MEP to face criminal charges over the misuse of parliamentary funds, and the second former UKIP MEP after Ashley Mote to have faced criminal charges during a parliamentary session.\n\nTrial and conviction\n\nWise appeared in court on 27 April 2009 and spoke only to confirm his name and plead not guilty. Jenkins also denied the charges. District Judge Daphne Wickham released both on conditional bail until 8 June. The case was transferred to Southwark Crown Court and charges specified: that Wise and Jenkins \"falsified a document, namely a contract for provision of services, an application for secretarial assistance allowance and invoices\". Also, that they used funds \"received from the European Parliament intended for use as payments for secretarial services.\"\n\nThe three-week trial began on 2 November 2009. Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC heard the prosecution argue that Wise channelled parliamentary funds into an account he secretly controlled so that he could pay credit card debts and buy fine wines. He made separate payments of \u00a32,228 and \u00a31,260 to wine importers, and maintained the deception by asking Jenkins to sign blank documents which he completed later. But for his exposure, Wise would, according to prosecutors, have claimed up to \u00a3180,000.\n\nOn the third day of the trial, just before Nigel Farage was due to give evidence against him, Wise began several hours of negotiations with his legal team after which he changed his plea to guilty and said he was entirely to blame for the fraud. This resulted in Jenkins being acquitted. He was sentenced on 10 November 2009 to two years imprisonment, the sentence having been reduced by one year on account of his guilty plea. In sentencing him, Judge Geoffrey Rivlin declared that:\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that you had hardly got your feet beneath your desk as an MEP before you were planning to defraud the parliament to which you were elected and the people you were elected to serve. This was very deliberate and blatant dishonesty. You did not fall into this offence as a result of some unfortunate combination of unforeseen circumstances which happened to suddenly present you with temptation.

Drake was a senior executive at the National Security Agency for seven years. When his efforts to alert his superiors and Congress to what he saw as illegal activities, waste and mismanagement at the NSA led nowhere, he decided to take his allegations to the press. Although he was cautious\u2014using encrypted e-mail to communicate with a reporter\u2014his leak was discovered. Last year the government indicted Drake under the Espionage Act. If convicted, he would have faced up to 35 years in prison.\n\nThe Drake case loomed as the biggest leak prosecution since the trial of Daniel Ellsberg four decades ago. The indictment against him included not only five counts of violating the Espionage Act, but also one charge of obstruction of justice and four counts of making false statements to the FBI while he was under investigation. Drake, who resigned from the NSA under pressure in 2008, has been working in recent months at an Apple computer store outside Washington, D.C., answering questions from customers about iPhones and iPads.\n\nHe was to be tried in Baltimore on June 13, but the trial was averted four days earlier. After key rulings on classified evidence went against the prosecutors, they struck a plea agreement: in exchange for Drake\u2019s pleading guilty to one count of exceeding the authorized use of a government computer, they dropped all the original charges and agreed not to call for prison time. On July 15, he was sentenced to one year of probation and 240 hours of community service.\n\nDespite that outcome, the Drake case will have broad implications for the relationship between the government and the press. And it did not settle the broader question that overshadowed the proceedings: Are employees of sensitive agencies like the NSA, the CIA and the FBI who leak information to the news media patriotic whistleblowers who expose government abuses\u2014or lawbreakers who should be punished for endangering national security? The question is becoming only more complicated in an age marked by unprecedented flows of information and the threat of terrorism.\n\nAs president-elect, Barack Obama took the position that whistleblowing by government employees was an act \u201cof courage and patriotism\u201d that \u201cshould be encouraged rather than stifled.\u201d But Drake\u2019s indictment was only one in an extraordinary string of leak investigations, arrests and prosecutions undertaken by the Obama administration.\n\nIn May 2010, Pfc. Bradley Manning was arrested and charged with leaking more than 250,000 State Department cables and thousands of intelligence reports to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Manning, a 23-year-old Army intelligence analyst, is in military custody, charged with aiding the enemy, publishing intelligence on the Internet, multiple theft of public records and fraud. Although aiding the enemy is a capital offense, Army prosecutors have said they will not recommend the death penalty. If convicted, Manning could be sent to prison for life. His trial has not been scheduled.\n\nAlso in May 2010, Shamai K. Leibowitz of Silver Spring, Maryland, a 39-year-old Israeli-American who worked on contract for the FBI as a Hebrew linguist, was sentenced to 20 months in prison after pleading guilty to leaking classified documents to a blogger.\n\nLast August, Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, 43, a senior adviser for intelligence on contract to the State Department, was charged with leaking defense data. Although the indictment did not spell out any details, news media reported that Kim had provided information to Fox News, which aired a story saying the CIA had warned that North Korea would respond to U.N. sanctions with another nuclear weapons test. His trial also remains unscheduled.\n\nAnd in January of this year, Jeffrey A. Sterling, 43, a former CIA employee, was arrested and charged with leaking defense information to \u201can author employed by a national newspaper,\u201d a description that pointed to reporter James Risen of the New York Times. In his 2006 book, State of War, Risen disclosed a failed CIA operation, code-named Merlin, in which a former Russian nuclear scientist who had defected to the United States was sent to Iran with a design for a nuclear weapons device. The blueprint contained a flaw meant to disrupt the Iranian weapons program. Certain that Iranian experts would quickly spot the flaw, the Russian scientist told them about it. The indictment of Sterling, in circumspect language, says in effect that he had been the Russian\u2019s case officer. His trial was scheduled for September 12.\n\nAccording to Jesselyn A. Radack of the Government Accountability Project, a whistleblower advocacy organization, the Obama administration \u201chas brought more leak prosecutions than all previous presidential administrations combined.\u201d Radack, a former Justice Department attorney, was herself a whistleblower, having told a reporter in 2002 that FBI interrogators violated the right of American terrorism suspect John Walker Lindh to have an attorney present during questioning. (Lindh later pleaded guilty to two charges and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.) Radack introduced Drake at a reception at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. this past April, at which he received the Ridenhour Prize for Truth-Telling. The $10,000 award is named for Ron Ridenhour, the Vietnam veteran who in 1969 wrote to Congress, President Richard M. Nixon and the Pentagon in an attempt to expose the killing of civilians in the Vietnamese village of My Lai the previous year; the massacre was later brought to light by reporter Seymour Hersh.\n\n\u201cI did not take an oath to support and defend government illegalities, violations of the Constitution or turn a blind eye to massive fraud, waste and abuse,\u201d Drake said in accepting the award, his first public comment on his case. (He declined to be interviewed for this article.) His oath to defend the Constitution, he said, \u201ctook precedence...otherwise I would have been complicit.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department has taken a different view. When Drake was indicted, Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer issued a statement saying, \u201cOur national security demands that the sort of conduct alleged here\u2014violating the government\u2019s trust by illegally retaining and disclosing classified information\u2014be prosecuted and pros\u00adecuted vigorously.\u201d\n\nDrake\u2019s case marked only the fourth time the government had invoked the espionage laws to prosecute leakers of information related to national defense.\n\nThe first case was that of Daniel Ellsberg, who in 1971 leaked the Pentagon Papers, a secret history of the Vietnam War, to the New York Times. Two years later, Judge William Byrne Jr. dismissed the charges against Ellsberg due to \u201cimproper government conduct,\u201d including tapping Ellsberg\u2019s telephone and breaking into his psychiatrist\u2019s office in search of damaging information about him. The Nixon White House also tried to suborn Judge Byrne, offering him the job of FBI director while he was presiding over the trial.\n\nNext came the Reagan administration\u2019s prosecution of Samuel Loring Morison, a Navy intelligence analyst convicted in 1985 and sentenced to two years in prison for leaking\u2014to Jane\u2019s Defence Weekly, the British military publication\u2014three satellite photos of a Soviet ship under construction. After Morison was released from prison, he was pardoned by President Bill Clinton.\n\nAnd in 2005, the Bush administration charged Lawrence A. Franklin, a Pentagon official, with leaking classified information on Iran and other intelligence to two employees of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobby. Franklin was convicted and sentenced to more than 12 years in prison, but in 2009 that was reduced to probation and ten months in a halfway house after the Obama administration dropped its case against the two AIPAC officials.\n\nTom Drake, who is 54, married and the father of five sons, worked in intelligence for most of his adult life. He volunteered for the Air Force in 1979 and was assigned as a cryptologic linguist working on signals intelligence\u2014information derived from the interception of foreign electronic communications\u2014and flying on spy planes that scoop up such data. He later worked briefly for the CIA. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1986 from the University of Maryland\u2019s program in Heidelberg, Germany, and in 1989 a master\u2019s degree in international relations and comparative politics from the University of Arizona. Beginning in 1989, he worked for several NSA contractors until he joined the agency as a senior official in the Signals Intelligence Directorate at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland. His first day on the job was September 11, 2001.\n\nThe NSA, which is so secretive that some joke its initials stand for \u201cNo Such Agency,\u201d collects signals intelligence across the globe from listening platforms under the sea, in outer space, in foreign countries, on ships and on aircraft. Technically part of the Defense Department, it receives a sizable chunk of the $80 billion annual U.S. intelligence budget and has perhaps 40,000 employees, although its exact budget and size are secret. In addition to collecting electronic intelligence, the agency develops U.S. codes and tries to break the codes of other countries.\n\nDespite the NSA\u2019s secrecy, it was widely reported that the agency has had great difficulty keeping up with the vast pools of data it collected\u2014billions of e-mails sent daily; text and voice messages from cell phones, some of which are encrypted; and the millions of international telephone calls that pass through the United States each day.\n\nDeveloping the ability to cull intelligence from so much data became even more critical after 9/11. With the secret authorization of President George W. Bush, Air Force Gen. Michael V. Hayden, then the NSA director, initiated a program of intercepting international phone calls and e-mails of people in the United States without a warrant to do so. The program was launched even though the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) provided for a special court to approve wiretap warrants and the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. The Bush administration said it relied on the president\u2019s constitutional power as commander in chief of the armed forces when it authorized the secret eavesdropping. It also said the wiretapping was justified by a Congressional resolution passed after 9/11 authorizing the president to use \u201call necessary and appropriate force\u201d against those responsible for the attacks.\n\nThe warrantless wiretapping was disclosed in 2005 by James Risen and Eric Lichtblau of the New York Times. They received a Pulitzer Prize for their reporting, and the government began investigating the source of the leak. Several months after the Times wiretapping story appeared, USA Today disclosed that the NSA was collecting the records of billions of domestic telephone calls with the cooperation of major telecommunications companies. (A 2008 revision of the FISA law has expanded the executive branch\u2019s authority to conduct electronic surveillance and reduced court review of some operations.)\n\nDrake\u2019s troubles began when he became convinced that an NSA program intended to glean important intelligence, code-named Trailblazer, had turned into a boondoggle that cost more than a billion dollars and violated U.S. citizens\u2019 privacy rights. He and a small group of like-minded NSA officials argued that an alternate program, named ThinThread, could sift through the agency\u2019s oceans of data more efficiently and without violating citizens\u2019 privacy. (ThinThread cloaked individual names while allowing their identification if necessary.) Drake has said that if the program had been fully deployed, it would likely have detected intelligence related to Al Qaeda\u2019s movements before 9/11.\n\nWhen Drake took his concerns to his immediate boss, he was told to take them to the NSA inspector general. He did. He also testified under subpoena in 2001 before a House intelligence subcommittee and in 2002 before the joint Congressional inquiry on 9/11. He spoke to the Defense Department\u2019s inspector general as well. To him it seemed that his testimony had no effect.\n\nIn 2005, Drake heard from Diane Roark, a former Republican staff member on the House intelligence committee who had monitored the NSA. According to the indictment of Drake, Roark, identified only as Person A, \u201casked defendant Drake if he would speak to Reporter A,\u201d an apparent reference to Siobhan Gorman, then a Baltimore Sun reporter covering intelligence agencies. Roark says she didn\u2019t. \u201cI never urged him to do it,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI knew he could lose his job.\u201d\n\nIn any case, Drake contacted Gorman, and they subsequently exchanged encrypted e-mails, according to the indictment. At a court hearing in March, defense attorneys confirmed that Drake had given Gorman two documents, but said Drake believed they were unclassified. (Gorman, now with the Wall Street Journal, declined to comment for this article.)\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, Gorman wrote a series of articles for the Sun about the NSA, focusing on the intra-agency controversy over Trailblazer and Thin\u00adThread. Her stories, citing several sources and not naming Drake, reported that Trailblazer had been abandoned because it was over budget and ineffective.\n\nIn November 2007, federal agents raided Drake\u2019s house. He has said they questioned him about the leak to the New York Times regarding warrantless wiretapping and that he told them he had not spoken to the Times. He has also said he told them he provided unclassified information about Trailblazer to the Sun. The government\u2019s investigation continued, and in April 2010 a federal grand jury in Baltimore issued the indictment against him.\n\nDrake was not charged with classic espionage\u2014that is, spying for a foreign power. (The word \u201cespionage,\u201d in fact, appears only in the title of the relevant section of the U.S. Code, not in the statutes themselves.) Rather, the five counts under the Espionage Act accused him of \u201cwillful retention of national defense information\u201d\u2014the unauthorized possession of documents relating to the national defense and failure to return them to officials entitled to receive them.\n\nUnderstanding these charges requires a short course in U.S. espionage law. Congress passed the original Espionage Act on June 15, 1917\u2014two months after the United States entered World War I\u2014and President Woodrow Wilson signed it into law the same day. There was no formal system for classifying nonmilitary information until President Harry Truman established one, by executive order, in September 1951. With the exception of information dealing with codes and communications intelligence, the language of the espionage laws refers not to classified documents per se, but to information \u201crelating to the national defense\u201d\u2014a broader category.\n\nIn practice, prosecutors are usually reluctant to bring a case under the espionage laws unless they can show that a defendant has revealed classified information; jurors might be reluctant to conclude that the release of unclassified information has harmed national security. But in Drake\u2019s case, the government was careful to say that the documents he allegedly leaked were related, in the language of the statute, \u201cto the national defense.\u201d\n\nThe point was highlighted at a pre-trial hearing this past March 31, when Drake\u2019s attorneys\u2014public defenders Deborah L. Boardman and James Wyda\u2014produced a two-page document described in the indictment as \u201cclassified\u201d that was clearly stamped \u201cunclassified.\u201d\n\nJudge Richard D. Bennett turned to the government attorneys. \u201cYour position on this is that, despite an error with respect to that particular document having \u2018Unclassified\u2019 stamped on it, it still related to the national defense...?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right,\u201d replied Assistant U.S. Attorney William M. Welch II, according to a transcript of the hearing. Bennett then denied a defense motion to dismiss the count of the indictment relating to the document in question. In subsequent rulings, however, Bennett said the prosecution could not substitute unclassified summaries of classified evidence during the trial, severely limiting the government\u2019s case.\n\nIn his Ridenhour Prize acceptance speech, Drake insisted that the government\u2019s prosecution was intent \u201cnot on serving justice, but on meting out retaliation, reprisal and retribution for the purpose of relentlessly punishing a whistleblower,\u201d and on warning potential whistleblowers that \u201cnot only can you lose your job but also your very freedom.\u201d Dissent, he added, \u201chas become the mark of a traitor.... as an American, I will not live in silence to cover for the government\u2019s sins.\u201d\n\nStrong words, but Drake\u2019s case raises another question. Why has the Obama administration pursued so many leakers?\n\nAll presidents abhor leaks. They see leaks as a challenge to their authority, as a sign that people around them, even their closest advisers, are talking out of turn. There will be no more \u201cblabbing secrets to the media,\u201d James Clapper warned in a memo to personnel when he took over as President Obama\u2019s director of national intelligence last year. Of course, some leaks may interfere with the execution of government policy, or indeed harm national security.\n\nLucy A. Dalglish, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, says the Obama administration \u201cis clearly making a point of going after people who have access to sensitive and classified information. They are aggressively pursuing government employees who have access to that information and release it to journalists.\u201d Technology has made the job of government investigators much easier, she adds. \u201cIf you are a public employee, they can get your e-mail records. They can get anyone\u2019s phone records. People these days leave electronic trails.\u201d\n\nAs a result, she says, potential whistleblowers will think twice before going to the press. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have a chilling effect\u2014sources will be less likely to turn information over to reporters,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result citizens will have less of the information they need about what is going on in our country and who they should vote for.\u201d\n\nThere is, it must be noted, a double standard in the handling of leaks of classified information. In Washington, the same senior officials who deplore leaks and warn that they imperil national security regularly hold \u201cbackgrounders,\u201d calling in reporters to discuss policies, intelligence information and other sensitive issues with the understanding that the information can be attributed only to \u201cadministration officials\u201d or some other similarly vague source. The backgrounder is really a kind of group leak.\n\nBackgrounders have been a Washington institution for years. Even presidents employ them. As the columnist James Reston famously noted, \u201cThe ship of state is the only known vessel that leaks from the top.\u201d Lower-level officials who divulge secrets can be jailed, but presidents and other high officials have often included classified material in their memoirs.\n\nDespite this double standard, Congress has recognized that it is often in the public interest for government employees to report wrongdoing and that public servants who do so should be protected from retaliation by their superiors. In 1989, Congress enacted the Whistleblower Protection Act, designed to protect employees who report violations of law, gross mismanagement, waste, abuse of authority or dangers to public health and safety.\n\nCritics say the statute has too often failed to prevent retaliation against whistleblowers. Repeated efforts to pass a stronger law failed this past December when a single senator anonymously placed a \u201chold\u201d on the bill. The legislation would have covered workers at airports, at nuclear facilities and in law enforcement, including the FBI. Earlier versions of the bill, backed by the Obama administration, would have included employees of intelligence and national security agencies, but House Republicans, apparently worried about leaks on the scale of the WikiLeaks disclosures, cut those provisions.\n\nMeanwhile, whistleblowers may draw solace from reports this past April that the Justice Department had suspended its investigation of Thomas Tamm, a former department lawyer. Tamm has said he was a source for the 2005 New York Times story disclosing the existence of the warrantless wiretapping program. After a probe lasting five years, that leak case was effectively closed. But that decision did not close the case of U.S.A. v. Thomas Andrews Drake.\n\nDavid Wise has written several books on national security.

The incredible miniseries comes from Selma director Ava DuVernay and dramatises the infamous Central Park Five case. In 1990, five teenagers were wrongfully convicted of the rape and attack of a 28-year-old female jogger in Central Park. Their convictions were overturned in 2002 after the real attacker confessed to the crime. Moonlight actor Jharrel Jerome plays Korey Wise in the series. Wise was not even an initial suspect in the case and was only in the police station to accompany his fried Yusef Salaam when he was called in for questioning.\n\nHow long was Korey Wise in solitary confinement? Korey Wise was the only one of the Central Park Five who served his sentence in an adult prison. As he was 16-years-old at the time of his arrest, he was tried as an adult whereas the other four boys - who were aged 14 to 15 - were tried as juveniles. Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam and Raymond Santana served approximately six years in a juvenile prison after being sentenced to five to 10 years. On the other hand, Wise was sentenced to five to 15 years in an adult prison. Wise spent time in several prisons, including the notorious Ryker\u2019s Island in New York. Wise served the longest sentence overall, spending 12 years behind bars. WHO PLAYS YOUNG KEVIN IN WHEN THEY SEE US\n\nJharrel Jerome plays Korey Wise in When They See Us\n\nWise spent most of his incarceration in solitary confinement and he did this for his own protection. The exact time is not known but he spent lengthy periods in solitary confinement at a time in maximum security prisons. As shown in episode four, Wise was subjected to abuse from other prisons and apparently even some of the prison guards. Speaking to Town and Country Magazine, When They See Us director Ava DuVernay said: \u201cOne of the things that really struck me was when Korey said to me, 'There is no Central Park Five. It was four plus one. And no one has told that story.\u2019 She added: \u201cI think it's important for people to understand the depths of what it means to be incarcerated in adult prisons in this country.\u201c WHAT DO THE CENTRAL PARK 5 LOOK LIKE VERSUS THE CAST?\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In 2002, Reyes confessed to being the Central Park attacker. DNA evidence and other tests confirmed that Reyes was the sole perpetrator of the attack and rape of the Central Park jogger.

It says that Legleitner was sentenced to two years in jail while Lloyd was sentenced to 26 years in prison \u2014 both by Circuit Court Judge Sherwood Bauer Jr. in the 19th Circuit in Martin County.\n\nThe claim gets the basic facts correct, but it omits an additional difference in the white defendant\u2019s case.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The newspaper examined millions of court documents on crimes in Florida from 2004 through 2016. The investigation concluded that blacks are more likely to be found guilty than whites and usually get longer sentences.\n\nOne article used the sentences for Legleitner and Lloyd as an example to show that Bauer sentenced African Americans to longer terms. Bauer told the newspaper that race is of \"complete insignificance\" in his treatment of defendants.\n\nHere are the basic facts of the two cases: Legleitner robbed men in a 2008 drug deal. Lloyd robbed a Pizza Hut and gas station the following year. Both men pleaded no contest to two counts of armed robbery and had open pleas, which means they weren\u2019t promised a particular sentence. Each had a single misdemeanor on his record and tallied the same point total on scoresheets used to determine incarceration time. Based on their score of 138 points, the state\u2019s guidelines called for a sentence of just under seven years to life in prison.\n\nBauer sentenced Lloyd to 26 years in prison in 2010, and the following year sentenced Legleitner to about two years in jail, including time already served.\n\nCooperation with prosecutors was a factor\n\nDavid Lustgarten, the assistant state attorney who prosecuted Legleitner, told PolitiFact that the defendants\u2019 point totals on the scoresheet don\u2019t tell the full story. Lustgarten said he was familiar with the facts of Lloyd\u2019s case.\n\nLegleitner, he said, was one of about a half dozen defendants who were involved in a scheme to approach other men under the guise of buying drugs, but planned to rob them. Legleitner helped the prosecution build the case against the co-defendants who were armed, including testifying against one at trial.\n\n\"I told Judge Bauer at sentencing that without his testimony I would have never secured a conviction against the two bad actors,\" Lustgarten said.\n\nThe Herald-Tribune article alluded to the fact that Legleitner cooperated when it stated that \"the prosecutor lobbied hard for leniency.\"\n\nLegleitner\u2019s defense attorney didn\u2019t respond to our questions.\n\nLloyd\u2019s case involved fewer defendants.\n\nLloyd\u2019s was a \"clear-cut case,\" said Adam Guzi, who prosecuted Lloyd and recommended a 30-year sentence. Guzi said he had witness accounts from the Pizza Hut and the Sunoco gas station as well as another witness who had spotted the defendants appearing to inspect another restaurant earlier. Prosecutors didn\u2019t need Lloyd\u2019s cooperation to convict the other man, Guzi said.\n\nLloyd\u2019s defense attorney, J.D. Lewis IV, said he thought that his client\u2019s sentence was outrageous at the time.\n\nBut asked about the role of race in Lloyd\u2019s sentencing, he told PolitiFact, \"I can\u2019t personally say there is evidence that race was a factor.\"\n\nIn general though, Lewis said he believes that there are racial disparities in the criminal-justice system. \"I would be naive to think racism does not play a part in the criminal justice system,\" he said.\n\nFollowing the Herald-Tribune\u2019s series, the 12th judicial circuit wrote a rebuttal, which included an analysis of the two robbery cases handled by Bauer in the 19th circuit. Bauer\u2019s office directed us to part of the rebuttal written by Diamond Litty, public defender for the 19th circuit (Legleitner and Lloyd both had private counsel.)\n\nThe public defender pointed to Lustgarten\u2019s testimony at the sentencing hearing that Legleitner was \"morally cooperative, honest, forthright, and remorseful.\"\n\nThe public defender also noted that Legleitner stole from someone who was a drug user or dealer, while Lloyd stole from employees at work.\n\nScoresheets don\u2019t pick up differences\n\nWe sent a summary of our findings to Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice advocacy group.\n\nMauer questioned why states have a complex scoring system in their sentencing guidelines if it doesn\u2019t pick up significant case distinctions.\n\n\"In this case, essentially the black defendant gets sentenced by the guidelines system and the white defendant gets the benefit of wide-ranging judicial discretion,\" he said. \"This doesn't necessarily mean that the white defendant \u2018got off too easy\u2019\u2014 just as likely that the black defendant got punished too severely.\"\n\nProsecutors have long recommended a reduced sentence in exchange for a defendant\u2019s cooperation, Mauer said. But in the era of mandatory sentences and enhanced prosecutorial power, the scale of that benefit has increased dramatically.\n\n\"So defendants who don't have information to trade or wish to contest the charges are faced with the prospect of a dramatically higher sentence for the same conduct as another who chooses to plead guilty,\" he said.\n\nA 2000 research report by the National Institute of Justice, a federal agency, concluded that despite decades of reform efforts, in some jurisdictions, blacks and Hispanics received longer sentences or differential benefits from guideline departures than similarly situated white offenders.\n\nThe disparities appeared in Southern and non-Southern jurisdictions, in state and federal court systems, and in jurisdictions with and without sentencing guidelines.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post said a white armed robbery suspect was sentenced to two years in jail while a black armed robbery suspect was sentenced to 26 years in prison by the same Florida judge in two separate cases.\n\nThe post gets the basic facts correct: The two defendants both pleaded no contest to the same crime, both had one prior misdemeanor and both scored the same number of points on a system designed to calculate their sentences.\n\nBut prosecutors said the white defendant got a reduced sentence after cooperating with prosecutors to convict co-defendants, a fact that\u2019s not mentioned in the graphic.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True."}, {"url": "https://www.casino.org/news/billy-walters-informant-tom-davis-gets-two-years-in-prison/", "page_content": "Tom Davis Sentenced to Two Years in Federal Prison, Former Dean Foods Chairman Gave Insider Trading Tips to Billy Walters\n\nPosted on: October 20, 2017, 10:00h.\n\nLast updated on: October 20, 2017, 10:03h.\n\nTom Davis, the former chairman of America\u2019s largest dairy producer Dean Foods, was sentenced to two years in prison this week for giving convicted sports gambler Billy Walters confidential information on the company\u2019s activities. The insider trading tips allowed Walters to profit $43 million, some of which was achieved by knowing exactly when to buy or sell stocks in the company based on Davis\u2019 information.\n\nTom Davis, like his sports gambling pal Billy Walters who has been behind bars since October 10, will be heading to Pensacola, Florida\u2019s federal minimum security prison on January 9, 2018, after a judge refused to consider his cooperation in his sentencing. (Image: Anthony Kwan/Bloomberg)\n\nWalters\u2019 own lucky streak came to a crashing end earlier this year when he was sentenced to five years behind bars, and a $25.4 million penalty.\n\nThe prosecutors had asked US District Court Judge P. Kevin Castel for leniency in Davis\u2019 sentencing, due to his cooperation in providing evidence in the case against Walters. But the judge didn\u2019t go for it, labeling Davis as \u201ca phony, a fraud and a crook.\u201d\n\nWhen the gavel came down, Castel ordered Davis to prison for two years. The 71-year-old Walters reported to the same federal prison in Pensacola, Florida on Oct. 10. In 2009, Forbes ranked the prison as the second-cushiest federal lockup in the country. (Alderson, West Virginia, where another high-profile former inmate, Martha Stewart, served five months for her 2004 stock trading conviction, is ranked #1).\n\nCoffee Dates\n\nDavis\u2019 sentencing ends what was once a distinguished business career for the former CEO.\n\nThe ex-Dean Foods chairman reportedly fell on financial difficulties once he stepped away from the organization, but tried to continue living the executive lifestyle. According to Bloomberg, Davis racked up $178,000 in private airfare charges, was late on a $78,000 tax bill, and even stole $100,000 from a charity he managed.\n\nThat\u2019s when he reached out to his pal Billy Walters for cash.\n\nThought to be the most successful sports bettor in Las Vegas history, Walters helped Davis cover $1 million in gambling debts, as well as money owed from his divorce. In exchange, Davis sent Walters tips on Dean Foods, and the gambler took his luck from the Las Vegas sportsbooks to Wall Street exchanges.\n\nDavis admitted to using a \u201cbat phone\u201d to communicate with Walters between 2008 and 2014. When he had information that would affect the share price of Dean Foods, he would say they should meet for coffee.\n\n\u201cI became indebted to him,\u201d Davis said during the trial. \u201cHe became more demanding of me for information.\u201d\n\nMickelson Connection\n\nThe case received widespread mainstream media attention due to golf superstar Phil Mickelson\u2019s involvement. \u201cLefty,\u201d as he\u2019s affectionately known, a longtime golfing buddy of Walters, was also a Dean Foods investor.\n\nMickelson made almost $1 million on the stock in just nine days. Investigated by former US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara, investigators believe the golfer made the stock transactions after being given information on the company by Walters.\n\nBut authorities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) found no evidence that Mickelson knew he was being given insider information. Mickelson later said he would be more responsible when it came to the people he associates with, and agreed to pay back the profits plus interest."}, {"url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/meek-mill-jail-time-legal-troubles-timeline-prison-sentence-8029995/", "page_content": "On Monday (Nov. 6), Meek Mill appeared in court where he was sentenced to two to four years in prison for violating his probation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m human.

But my dawg is a warrior!\u201d\n\nMeek\u2019s legal woes began long before his debut, dating back to his younger days in Philadelphia where he arrested for drug possession in 2007 and found himself entangled in legal troubles multiple times thereafter. Below, Billboard takes a look at Meek\u2019s run-ins with the criminal justice system.\n\nMeek Mill Heads to Prison for the First Time (2008)\n\nMeek\u2019s first taste of prison came at the age of 18 when he was caught carrying a gun while shopping at a local grocery store. In a 2015 interview with Billboard, Meek recounted his experience. The rapper said that he was walking to a local corner store with a gun in possession and was caught by officials, who \u201cbeat the shit out of me.\u201d He was arrested in 2008 following the incident, spent eight months in prison and was later placed on probation for five years.\n\nHalloween Arrest (2012)\n\nMeek Mill was pulled over by cops on Halloween because officials reportedly smelled marijuana coming from his car. According to Philly.com, Meek said he was arrested for refusing to allow police to search his car. During that time, Meek was on his way to Atlanta for a performance, which he would\u2019ve earned almost $40,000 for. His deal with Puma at the time was also in jeopardy due to all the negative press surrounding him.\n\nViolates Probation (2014)\n\nAfter his prison release, Meek Mill made it his duty to take his music seriously, which worked out in his favor as the rapper signed with Rick Ross\u2019 Maybach Music Group label in 2011. Meek showed promise with the release of his breakout track \u201cI\u2019m a Boss\u201d and his star continued to rise since as his debut album, Dreams and Nightmares, peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart. Despite all his success, the Philly native landed right back in courts in 2014 for violating his probation by booking performances outside of Philly without Judge Brinkley\u2019s approval. The rapper was sentenced to three to six months in jail. Meek began his stint in July and was released from prison in December 2014. He was put on parole and ordered to complete etiquette classes.\n\nViolates Parole, Again (2016)\n\nBy the time 2016 rolled around, Meek was at the top of his game. He was dating the hottest female rapper at the time \u2014 Nicki Minaj \u2014 and was embroiled in a meme-able rap beef with Drake. But, Meek found himself in front of Judge Brinkley again for traveling without her permission. In February 2016, Brinkley sentenced the rapper to house arrest for 90 days where he\u2019d be forced to wear an ankle monitor, participate in community service, and was prohibited from working and traveling outside of Philly.\n\nSt. Louis Airport Scuffle (2017)\n\nMeek Mill found himself involved in a fight at a St. Louis airport earlier this year after refusing to take a photo with an employee. The rapper was charged with a misdemeanor assault and was given a court summons. At the time, Meek was still on probation from his 2009 drug and gun charge. The misdemeanor assault charge was recently dropped, but it wouldn\u2019t be the last run-in Meek would have.\n\nRides \u201cRecklessly\u201d Through New York City Streets\n\nWhile Meek started off the year on the wrong foot with a misdemeanor charge following his airport fight, the rapper channeled his energy into his music and dropped off his latest album Wins & Losses. In support of his new album, Meek took the stage at The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon to perform the aptly titled \u201cYBA (Young Black America)\u201d but was arrested shortly after for driving his motorbike recklessly in New York City the night prior, after officials obtained footage from social media of Meek\u2019s antics. He was charged with reckless endangerment and reckless driving.\n\n\u201cA guy literally popped a wheelie for 10 seconds on the street with no one else around,\u201d Tacopina said in a video posted by TMZ. \u201cAnd the police were there. That\u2019s very important. The police were there and they saw it, and they didn\u2019t arrest him. They didn\u2019t even give him a traffic ticket, but somehow the video made it to social media.\u201d\n\nAccording to TMZ, Meek accepted a plea deal which will remove the charge from his record under the condition that he stays out of trouble for six months and completes community service.\n\nJudge Sentences to Two to Four Years in Prison\n\nMeek may have avoided jail time for his most recent arrests, but Judge Brinkley wasn\u2019t so forgiving. Meek\u2019s two charges for 2017 violated his probation terms and on Monday (Nov. 6), Judge Brinkley made it clear she\u2019s had enough and sentenced the rapper to two to four years in state prison. In a report by Philly.com, Brinkley told Meek, \u201cI gave you break after break, and you basically just thumbed your nose at this court.\u201d\n\nAs Meek was taken into custody, his rap peers offered him some encouraging words including A$AP Ferg, Nipsey Hussle, YG, Kevin Hart, JAY-Z, Rick Ross and more.\n\nTests are not for the faint at heart! . Every time an obstacle crosses his path, he fights his way through and comes out triumphant. I\u2019ve watched him 1st hand fight this unjust system for close to a decade. But my dawg is a warrior!

It will be BRIGHT! #doubleMDreamchasers A post shared by The Boss Rick Ross,Yung Renzel (@richforever) on Nov 7, 2017 at 7:54am PST\n\nMeek Mill Is Granted Bail and Early Release\n\nOn Tuesday (April 24), a Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued an order to a lower court to grant Meek Mill an early release on bail. The rapper was sentenced to two to four years in prison last November for probation violation and made several attempts to get his conviction overturned but was repeatedly denied by Judge Brinkley.\n\nKevin Hart visited Meek on Tuesday morning and announced on his socials that Meek was a finally free man. Shortly after, Meek announced the good news on his own Twitter and thanked all his supporters for their love during the \u201cnightmare\u201d he experienced.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to thank God, my family, my friends, my attorneys, my team at Roc Nation including JAY-Z, Desiree Perez, my good friend Michael Rubin, my fans, The Pennsylvania Supreme Court and all my public advocates for their love, support and encouragement during this difficult time,\u201d he said in a statement to Billboard. \u201cWhile the past five months have been a nightmare, the prayers, visits, calls, letters and rallies have helped me stay positive. To the Philadelphia District Attorney\u2019s office, I\u2019m grateful for your commitment to justice \u2014 not only for my case, but for others that have been wrongfully jailed due to police misconduct.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/29/disturbed-au-pair-who-created-false-identities-given-two-years-jail-in-victoria", "page_content": "A disturbed woman who created bizarre and false identities as a nanny, a talent scout and a pregnant and abused teen is a pathological liar at high risk of reoffending, a Melbourne court has found.\n\nSamantha Azzopardi, who created false backstories for herself around the world, was sentenced on Friday to two years in prison in Victoria over her latest inventions.\n\nThe 32-year-old\u2019s criminal history of deception dates back more than a decade and includes high-profile international scams.\n\nThis sentence comes after she admitted charges of child stealing, having pretended to be an experienced and highly recommended au pair.\n\nBased on false recommendations, she was hired by Victorian couple Jazze and Tom Jervis, who mistakenly believed she was a qualified live-in nanny named Harper Hernandez.\n\nMelbourne magistrate Johanna Metcalf said Azzopardi\u2019s deceptions were prolonged and a gross breach of trust.\n\nA second elaborate talent scout ruse involved Azzopardi, using the name Marley, cultivating a relationship with a 12-year-old girl who auditioned for a role advertised by an agency where Azzopardi claimed to work.\n\nAzzopardi claimed to be mentoring the girl for a television show and took the girl \u2013 with her mother\u2019s falsely obtained permission \u2013 to Sydney to audition. She told the girl to go into a Centrelink office and tell a woman a bizarre tale about a ghost. Azzopardi then sent the girl home alone on a train.\n\n\u201cThe deceptions in this case were a gross breach of trust towards the child, a 12-year-old girl who believed you were helping to realise her acting ambitions,\u201d Metcalf said.\n\nShe tried her au pair ruse again later on a newly arrived family in Australia. After seeking permission to take the couple\u2019s two young children on a picnic to the You Yangs, she instead went with them to Bendigo.\n\nWhile there she went to Headspace, a youth mental health organisation, claiming to be a 14-year-old pregnant schoolgirl who had been abused by her uncle. That deception went on for months with police launching a lengthy and laborious investigation.\n\nBendigo police arrested Azzopardi after she caught the attention of social media. She refused to answer to her real name and would not tell officers who the young children were. She eventually gave officers enough clues to reunite the children with their parents.\n\nAzzopardi has a long history of dishonesty offences. In 2013 she showed up in central Dublin claiming to be a teenage sex-trafficking victim from eastern Europe. It cost the Irish government hundreds of thousands of dollars before her true identity was exposed.\n\nAfter being deported she emerged in Canada, where she said she was a victim of sexual assault and torture.\n\nIn Australia, she convinced a Perth family she was a Russian gymnast named Emily whose entire family had been killed in a murder-suicide in France. In Sydney she passed herself off as a schoolgirl more than half her age.\n\nAzzopardi has criminal convictions for dishonesty offences in Queensland, Western Australia and New South Wales, as well as for commonwealth offences.\n\nExperts told the court Azzopardi had experienced a highly traumatic upbringing including emotional neglect and physical abuse. Psychiatrist Jacqueline Rakov assessed her this year and found she had a severe personality disorder and pseudologia fantastica, a \u201crare but dramatic\u201d psychiatric disorder involving an \u201cextreme type of lying\u201d.\n\nRakov found Azzopardi was at high risk of reoffending if left to her own devices, but low risk if she willingly engaged in long-term and ongoing therapy.\n\nMetcalf said Azzopardi was clearly a disturbed young woman and sentenced her to two years behind bars, but said she would be eligible for release on parole \u2013 on conditions including that she receive appropriate mental health treatment \u2013 after 12 months.\n\nAzzopardi is immediately eligible for release having served 574 days in custody. Before Victoria\u2019s lockdown she expressed plans to immediately travel to northern NSW."}]}
