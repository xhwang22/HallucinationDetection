This was unprecedented for higher education.\n\nStudents could see that a university degree led to career advancement. York was born in this moment of tremendous change, a university in Toronto filled with purpose, offering unique programming and a diverse community ready to tackle issues facing the world such as women\u2019s studies, the environment and global health."}, {"url": "https://www.yorku.ca/mediar/releases_1996_2000/archive/072100.htm", "page_content": "TORONTO, July 21, 2000 --\n\nPresident Emeritus Ross, who led York University through its first decade, 1960-1970, died last night at age 90.\n\n\"On behalf of York University, I extend my sympathies to Murray's family, and I share with the York community a great sadness at his passing -- but also a fullness and gratitude for all that he brought to this university,\" said Marsden.\n\n\" Murray's values, vision and steadfastness provided the solid foundation upon which this university was built,\" said Marsden. \"In 1959, we had no faculty, no students, no buildings -- but we had the vision, tenacity and humanity of President Murray G. Ross and his grand dreams. Forty-one years later, we have evolved into the third largest university in Canada. Throughout those years, and in the years to come, the mark of Murray Ross will be felt,\" said Marsden.\n\nMarsden praised the tenacity of President Emeritus Ross, who led York during its formative years, which were marked by incredible change as provincial governments across the land rushed to accommodate the educational needs of the baby boomers. Ross had a vision for doing that, with an emphasis on liberal arts and part-time adult education. He has remained a valuable and active faculty member since his time as president.\n\nAn officer of the Order of Canada, Ross had a long and distinguished career in the academic world, both as a professor and an administrator. In addition to his decade at the helm of York University, he was also a former vice-president of the University of Toronto. He published several books of note, including Canadian Corporate Directors on the Firing Line, New Universities in the Modern World, and The Way Must be Tried: Memoirs of a University Man. Born in Sydney, Nova Scotia, he was educated at Acadia University, University of Toronto, University of Chicago and Columbia University. A director of numerous community and national organizations, Ross's contributions to academic, social and intellectual spheres were duly recognized by many universities, including York, which bestowed on him honorary degrees.\n\nA university memorial service will be held on Tuesday, September 19 at 4 p.m. at Glendon College.\n\n-30-\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nSine MacKinnon\n\nSenior Advisor/Director, Media Relations\n\nYork University\n\n(416) 736-2100, ext. 22087\n\nYU/076/00"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/murray.ross/2305102", "page_content": "Murray Ross\n\nApril 12, 1910 (age 90) Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada\n\nHe was the founding president of Toronto\"s York University and served in that role from 1959 to 1970.

The President is appointed by the Board of Governors, after consultation with the Senate, and holds office during the pleasure of the Board. The President is Vice Chancellor and chief executive officer of the University with responsibility to supervise and direct the implementation of the educational policy and general administration of the University, including the teaching staff, officers, servants and students. The President has power to formulate and implement regulations governing the conduct of students, to recommend to the Board the appointment, promotion and removal of teaching staff, officers and employees of the University, along with power to recommend new faculties, departments, schools, institutes, programmes and projects. The President also has power to strike presidential committees and to recommend courses of action to the Board.\n\nThe establishment of York University in 1959 and the need to begin a teaching programme in 1960 meant that the Board of Governors and the President had to move quickly to establish a faculty, a programme of study and employ the necessary teachers and administrators to give life to the new institution. Murray G. Ross was named President in December of 1959 and was inaugurated in 1960. The University was affiliated with the University of Toronto at the time and Ross was able to assemble a teaching staff for September 1960 when the first seventy-five York students enrolled.\n\nThe records show that Ross was intimately involved in all facets of the University in the early years, from student activities (and discipline! ), through academic and physical plant planning, to graduation ceremonies. In addition, Ross and his successors spent a good deal of time undertaking public-speaking tours, fund-raising and establishing contacts with other universities in Canada and around the world, with associations and all levels of government.\n\nMurray G. Ross served as President of York for a decade (1960-1970), and was succeeded by David Slater. During his short tenure (1971-1973), Slater continued the course set by the Ross years.\n\nIn 1974 Ian H. Macdonald became President of the University, a post he filled for ten years. This period was as significant as the Ross tenure in the presidency. Enrollment increased by fifty per cent while faculty complements remained stable. The introduction of labour unions and collective bargaining was also a feature of the period. The Macdonald era also saw two major reforms of the administrative structure of York, undertaken in a period of fiscal restraint within the Province and the University.\n\nThe first reform took place in 1976 as part of a move to centralize planning at York, a major recommendation of the President' s Commission on Goals and Objectives (1976). Among the reforms was the introduction of the Executive Vice President. The second reform occurred in 1983, its most significant aspect being the introduction of a Provost for students at the University.\n\nYork was also the first Canadian university to appoint an Advisor on the Status of Women as a senior officer reporting to the President, and Macdonald also appointed a Sexual Harrassment Officer. In the field of research, the Centre for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, the LaMarsh Research Programme on Violence and Conflict Resolution, the Centre for Research in Experimental Space Science and several other centres were opened in the Macdonald period.\n\nMacdonald retired in 1984 and was succeeded by Harry Arthurs, a Professor at Osgoode Hall Law School. Although the period of financial restraint continued, the Arthurs presidency was also marked by progress in the University with an ambitious new building program that saw the erection of a Life Science and Environmental Studies Building, the establishment of a physical presence for Calumet College, the building of the new Student Centre, and the completion of the Fine Arts Complex. The student enrollment increase was kept at approximately twenty-five percent in Arthurs' years, while faculty complements remained stable. A new University Academic Plan, focusing on the teaching and research activity of the University, was inaugurated and the Hare Commission examined the role and utility of the non-faculty colleges within the University structure. The University continued its out-reach for students in the expanding adult education and multicultural communities of Toronto.\n\nIn 1992 Harry Arthurs retired. He was succeeded by Susan Mann."}]}
