Experienced opener Upul Tharanga returns to the side having missed out on selection for the tour of New Zealand, while Oshada Fernando, who made his Test debut in Sri Lanka\u2019s one-wicket win over South Africa in Durban last week, has received his maiden ODI call-up.\n\nThe experienced Upul Tharanga is back in the ODI set-up\n\nOthers selected include: Avishka Fernando, Kamindu Mendis, Priyamal Perera, Isuru Udana and Vishwa Fernando.

He is supposed to be an offspinner but his nimble fingers can do what they want to the ball. One minute in 2012, he was bowling in the nets, the next he was fast-tracked into the Sri Lanka team by no less a spotter of talent than Mahela Jayawardene, in a World T20 to boot. If that isn't enough drama, on debut , he struck in his first over, and then got hit in the face by a cricket ball. If his career had ended then, he would still have felt it was a roller-coaster.\n\nThen came August 24, 2017. And even if it ended with victory for India by three wickets, he would never forget this rain-hit night.\n\nTwenty-three-years-old now, a day after getting married, Dananjaya took 6 for 54 and had one of the world's mightiest batting line-ups looking at him like he was a ghost. Virat Kohli was bowled for 4, deceived in the manner he might once have been while playing backyard cricket while still a child. He cast a dumbstruck look at the pitch as he walked off but the demon wasn't there. He was 22 yards away, smiling and whooping and dancing with a bunch of men who had put only 236 runs on the board, but felt they were on their way to defending it.\n\nMS Dhoni watched all of the revelry, typically expressionless. He had more important work to do, like reviving India's chase, yet again.\n\nFrom 131 for 7, through sheer force of will and fiendish common sense, he marshalled India towards their target. He had advice for those who would listen, and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, in the course of a record-breaking eighth-wicket partnership of 100, certainly did. Don't get stuck on the back foot, said the master to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Stick with him, pleaded all of India as they turned to a familiar hero.\n\nAkila Dananjaya celebrates with his team-mates after snaring his sixth victim \u2022 Associated Press\n\nMost of the Dhoni innings that stick in the mind feature brutish strokes and calculated carnage. But with a small target defended by a set of bowlers that were on an almighty roll, a different type of innings was required. One that would fetch 45 runs off 68 deliveries at a strike-rate of 66.17 with only one boundary. He had denied Muttiah Muralitharan in 2011 . He did the same to Dananjaya on Thursday.\n\nFor one brief moment though, Sri Lanka thought they had glory. In the 35th over, with India 59 runs away, Vishwa Fernando produced a false shot from Dhoni and the ball trickled between his legs to hit the stumps. But the zing bails - heavier than the normal ones - wouldn't fall. And neither would Dhoni. He and Bhuvneshwar brought the target down below 50, with a slog sweep for six. To 30, with back-to-back fours. Under 10, as both the sky and Sri Lanka's hopes faded to black.\n\nIt was so that Pallekele, which had gasped and swooned and howled and cried, had to go back home knowing their country had lost playing its 800th ODI. But there might well be a smile on their faces once the wound stops feeling so fresh. At long last, their prayers had been answered. They had found someone who could actually land the ball where an Indian batsman didn't want it.\n\nThere had been 329 runs and 44.2 overs between a Sri Lankan bowler taking a wicket on this tour. In the space of 15 balls, Dananjaya had four. By his fifth over, he had a five-for. Where was he all this time? Why hasn't he been playing every match for his country? Why would anyone hide a bowler who, on one of his days, rouses thousands of people up and make them forget woes which had seemed all-consuming only last weekend\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar posted his maiden ODI half-century and led India's chase \u2022 Associated Press\n\nBut to do that, Dananjaya had to become a villain to a few people. Like Rohit Sharma, who had, until the 16th over, batted with such ease that he was playing any shot that popped into his mind, like a scoop against the express pace of Dushmantha Chameera. In the blink of an eye, he had scored one-sixth of the 37 runs he had made over his last 10 ODIs on the island. Then he had to face an offspinner. He saw a good length ball pitching on middle and leg and thought it ripe to sweep. After all, it would be turning further down leg. Except, it didn't. It couldn't. It was a legbreak. It spun the other way and pinned the man who dared to make 264 against Sri Lanka right in front. India were 109 for 1 in the 16th over.\n\nUp the order came Kedar Jadhav. He was previously earmarked to be a finisher, but India wanted to experiment in this series. Only Frankenstein would not find the monster he was looking for this night. Dananjaya got back to his mark. He changed his grip; instead of the front two fingers gripping the ball, all of them wrapped around it. And after he trotted up to the crease, he released it from the back of his hand. Jadhav did not see it. But he sure as heck heard it crashing into middle stump.\n\nProper legspiners would not have the control Dananjaya does. Nor would they have his ripping googly. He got four of his wickets with it - three of them bowled, all of them in the same over. Hardik Pandya handed him his third five-wicket haul in all representative cricket, blindly charging out of his crease to be stumped off an ugly shot.\n\nBut such a special spell still ended up on the wrong side of a scorecard because Sri Lanka's batsmen had let him down. Five of the top six faced at least 20 deliveries, and even Upul Tharanga, the man who missed out, got two scintillating boundaries. The pitch held no threat, the bowling wasn't anything more than efficient, a more experienced team might have got through the tough stages to post a monumental total.\n\nSri Lanka were certainly heading that way after being put in. They were coasting at 70 for 1 in the 14th over, but lurched to 121 for 5 in the 29th, and if it wasn't for Milinda Siriwardana finally unveiling the composure and shot selection expected of an international batsman, who knows what the score might have been? The allrounder made a timely half-century - his third in the format - and lifted Sri Lanka to a total that came within three wickets of being enough."}, {"url": "https://english.newsnationtv.com/sports/cricket/akila-dananjaya-lasith-malinga-sri-lanka-squad-for-three-match-odi-series-vs-bangladesh-231853.html", "page_content": "highlights Lasith Malinga will retire after the end of the first ODI.\n\nAkila Dananjaya will play for the first time since December 2018.\n\nMalinga is the third-highest wicket-taker for Sri Lanka in ODIs.\n\nNew Delhi:\n\nAkila Dananjaya\u2019s career was at the crossroads after his action was deemed illegal in December 2018. He remodeled his action and was cleared by the International Cricket Council in February 2019 but he was not selected in the World Cup squad. Sri Lanka failed to qualify for the knock-out stages of the tournament as they finished in sixth spot. Ahead of the series against Bangladesh, Dananjaya has been picked in the side as the lone specialist spinner for the three-match ODI series. Apart from Dananjaya, the Sri Lanka selectors named Shehan Jayasuriya, Lahiru Kumara, Wanindu Hasaranga and Dasun Shanaka in their 17-man squad.\n\n\n\nThe match on July 26 will witness the final ODI for Lasith Malinga, who has announced his retirement from the format.

Niroshan Dickwella and Dinesh Chandimal continue to be left out of the side.\n\n\n\nPosting a video message to his fans on his wife's Facebook page, Malinga said he felt no ill will towards officials and players who may have tried to push him out of the team. The 35-year-old said he was sidelined by selectors two years ago but was able to prove his value to the national team at the recent World Cup.\n\n\"Friday will be the last day you will see me playing an ODI match,\" Malinga said. \"If you can, please come for the match.\" During practice Tuesday ahead of the first ODI against Bangladesh, Malinga said he hoped to play T20 cricket and had his sights on the 2020 World Cup in Australia. \"I hope to be able to take Sri Lanka to the next T20 World Cup,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMalinga, 35, will leave as Sri Lanka\u2019s third highest wicket-taker in ODI cricket with 335 wickets in 219 innings so far.

In keeping with the prevalent conditions in the continent, spinners dominate the list, with Lasith Malinga the only fast-bowler in the top five. While no Indian figures even in the top 10, Ravindra Jadeja is ninth on the list with 22 wickets.\n\nLasith Malinga (33 wickets)\n\nFormer Sri Lanka pacer Lasith Malinga is the leading wicket-taker in the Asia Cup with 33 wickets in 15 innings. His staggering numbers include two four-fers and three five-wicket hauls. His best figures of five for 34 came against Pakistan in the 2010 edition. His two other five-wicket hauls were also against Pakistan, both in the 2014 tournament where he picked 11 wickets in four matches to help Sri Lanka clinch the title.\n\nInnings Wickets Economy Rate Average Best 4/5 15 33 4.70 18.84 5/34 2/3\n\nMuttiah Muralitharan (30 wickets)\n\nLegendary spinner Muttiah Muralitharan is hot on the heels of his compatriot Malinga with 30 wickets in 24 innings at the continental event. His most successful outing was in 2008, when he scalped 11 wickets in five matches, which included a five for 31 against Bangladesh. However, Muralitharan has had limited success against stronger oppositions such as India and Pakistan, picking a combined 10 wickets in 16 matches against the two teams.\n\nInnings Wickets Economy Rate Average Best 4/5 24 30 3.75 28.83 5/31 1/1\n\nAjantha Mendis (26 wickets)\n\nThird on the list is yet another Sri Lankan Ajantha Mendis, with a staggering haul of 26 wickets in just eight matches in the Asia Cup. The wily off-spinner turned heads when he wrecked India in the 2008 Asia Cup final in Karachi with figures of six for 13. The Men in Blue had no response to the then 23-year-old\u2019s mystery and capitulated for 173 in response to 273. Earlier in the tournament, Mendis had tormented UAE and Pakistan with figures of five for 22 and four for 47, respectively and ended the 2008 edition with 17 wickets in five matches at an astounding average of 8.52.\n\nInnings Wickets Economy Rate Average Best 4/5 8 26 3.98 10.42 6/13 2/2\n\nSaeed Ajmal (25 wickets)\n\nYet another off-spinner, Saeed Ajmal, makes it to the list of the top wicket-takers at the Asia Cup. With 25 wickets in 12 innings under his belt, Ajmal is Pakistan\u2019s most successful bowler in the tournament. He had a dream run in the 2014 edition, where he scalped 11 wickets in five matches in Pakistan\u2019s march to the final. Ajmal also helped Pakistan clinch the title in 2012, contributing with eight wickets in four matches.\n\nInnings Wickets Economy Rate Average Best 4/5 12 25 4.21 19.40 3/26 0/0\n\nShakib Al Hasan (24 wickets)\n\nAll-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, who will lead Bangladesh in Asia Cup 2022, is also his country\u2019s highest wicket-taker in the tournament with 24 scalps in 18 innings. His most fruitful outing was at the last edition in 2018, where he picked seven wickets in four matches, including four for 42 against Afghanistan in the group stage. Other than topping the bowling charts for Bangladesh, Shakib is also third on the list of the highest run-scorers for the Tigers in the tournament with 479 runs at an average of 28.17."}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/sri-lanka-vs-india-2017-akela-dhananjaya-six-wicket-haul-destroyed-indian-batsmen", "page_content": "When I began to write this article, I was prepared to pen down the tale of three quick wickets by Akila Dananjaya. By the time I reached the end of my article, he had registered a six-wicket haul in the match. If that does not describe the voodoo Dananjaya hid in his Arsenal, I don't know what will.\n\n2nd ODI, second innings, and countless surprises...Sri Lanka finally served their revenge dish to their guests.\n\nIt all looked fine for the Men in Blue in the beginning. Repetitive may be the right word but Dananjaya carried a magic wand to change the fortunes of this match. His six-wicket haul snatched the match away from the plates of the Indian team while the latter struggled to recover from Dananjaya's bowling assault.\n\nFirst, he hunted Rohit Sharma who looked in form after a long time. He scored 54 runs after which he was sent back to the pavilion by Dananjaya. He was cruising, was Rohit, and for some reason decided to get down low to a full ball in order to sweep only to miss the ball which crashed into his pads.\n\nSharma was quite confident about not being out and he went for a review upon Dhawan's insistence. Little did they know that the ball that Sharma's tried to sweep had landed him in deep trouble. Wicket number 1...India's opening partnership had been snapped for 109, a Sri Lankan bowler had picked the first wicket of this series. No worries India thought, we have the belief, Dananjaya retorted!\n\nIn the sixteenth over, Shikhar Dhawan was dismissed for 49 by Siriwardana and Dananjaya returned with the ball in the next over.\n\nWith Kedhar Jadhav on strike in the 17th over and Dananjaya on a roll, he delivered a googly which skidded across the surface, kissed the inside edge of his bat and was headed for the middle stump. Bamboozled, Jadhav had a puzzling look and meandered back... not the match, it came roaring back to life.\n\nIndian fans' eyebrows were not yet furrowed, but drips of sweat were forming!\n\nAs Virat Kohli walked in to bat, he smashed Dananjaya's first ball for a splendid boundary. Yeah, normalcy folks, the king of chases is in, calm down. Just when everyone thought the captain will let the hosts know who dominates the game, Dananjaya decided to make up for his previous ball.\n\nHe delivered a googly which was fullish, Kohli moved his front foot out of the way to play his whiplash cover drive, the ball deviated, missed that broad bat and smashed the stumps. Boom... the crowd were baying for Kohli's blood, Kohli himself was baying for the solace of the dressing room. He stood there perplexed, seeking answers from KL Rahul as the Sri Lankan team came together for a wild celebration. Energy simmering all over the place, the ghosts of the series slowly fading away!\n\nIt was Rahul's turn next. Another googly and another batsman bowled. The ball tricked Rahul as it gently touched the inside edge and went past the pads to hit the wickets.\n\nHardik Pandya looked confident at the crease being well accompanied by MS Dhoni. Unfortunately, Pandya was out for a duck today. As he advanced to hit the ball, it betrayed him smartly after brushing against his bat and landing directly in Niroshan Dickwella's hands.\n\nAs Pandya started to walk back, Dhoni was seen contemplating the measures to revive team India. Axar Patel walked in to bat.\n\nDananjaya delivered a fantastic ball and Patel misjudged it. No one was even surprised, not anymore. He moved forward to defend but the ball sneaked its way around his bat and went straight to the stumps. There was no way to cancel out that splendid dismissal.\n\nTeam India is determined to make a comeback in this match while they hope to veil the over-confidence they bore ahead of this encounter. As Dhoni and Bhuvneshwar Kumar are struggling to calculate their moves, faces look grieved in the Indian dressing room. Sri Lankan fans are seen dancing to the rhythm of their heartbeat and the hosts are hailing their new hero.\n\nFun fact, Dananjaya got married yesterday. I was even prepared to flood my social media articles with his pictures but I guess that will be possible once I recover from this spell. In my defence, I wasn't prepared for this just like the other 1.3 billion Indian fans (and probably the entire island of Sri Lanka).\n\nDespite the results of this match, one cannot overlook the spell that left the entire cricket world spellbound.\n\nAkila Dananjaya, take a bow, he also took the man of the match, some solace after all!\n\nPoll : 0 votes"}, {"url": "https://cricshots.com/akila-dananjayas-six-wicket-provided-perfect-finish-for-sri-lanka-in-the-odi-series-against-south-africa/", "page_content": "Akila Dananjaya\u2019s six-wicket provided perfect finish for Sri Lanka in the ODI series against South Africa\n\nSri Lankan off-spinner Akila Dananjaya\u2019s six-wicket helped the hosts Sri Lanka to sign off the five-match ODI series against the visitors South Africa with a fine victory.
