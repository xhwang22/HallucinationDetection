Panchen Sonam Dragpa was the 15th Ganden Tripa and his texts still serve as the core curriculum for many Gelugpa monasteries. The third Dalai Lama studied at Drepung Monastery and became its abbot. His reputation spread quickly and the monks at Sera Monastery also recognised him as their abbot.\n\nAccording to Sumpa Khenpo, the great Gelug scholar, he also studied some Nyingmapa tantric doctrines.\n\nWhen one of Tibet's kings, who had been supported by the Kagyupa, died in 1564, Sonam Gyatso presided over his funeral. His political power, and that of the Gelugpas, became dominant in Tibet by the 1570s.\n\nOrigin of the title \"Dalai Lama\"\n\nThe title \"Dalai Lama\" was first bestowed by the Mongolian ruler Altan Khan upon Sonam Gyatsho in 1578, a title derived from the Mongolian Dalai-yin qan (or Dalaiin khan) one.\n\nSince the time of Genghis Khan, only people who were of his royal lineage were allowed to rule Mongolia. This frustrated many would-be rulers who were not of this line. Altan Khan was the most destructive of these usurpers. He perceived that through the Buddhist faith he could gain legitimacy by claiming to be a reincarnation of Kublai Khan.\n\nAltan Khan chose the Gelug order of Tibetan Buddhism (founded by Tsongkhapa, 1357\u20131419). In 1577 he invited the leader of this order, Sonam Gyatsho, to come to Mongolia and teach his people.\n\nSonam Gyatsho proclaimed Altan Khan to be the reincarnation of Kublai Khan, and in return, Altan Khan gave the title Dalai Lama to Sonam Gyatsho. Altan Khan posthumously awarded the title to his two predecessors, making Sonam Gyatsho the 3rd Dalai Lama.\n\nAltan Khan and the conversion of Mongolia\n\nHe was anti-shaminist.\n\nSonam Gyatso, a monk of the Gelugpa (Yellow Hat) school of Buddhism, was responsible for finding a foreign patron for Gelugpa institutions. He found this patron in the Altan Khan.\n\nAltan Khan first invited the 3rd Dalai Lama to Mongolia in 1569, but apparently the Dalai Lama refused to go and sent a disciple again, who reported back to the Dalai Lama about the great opportunity to spread Buddhist teachings throughout Mongolia. In 1573 Altan Khan took some Tibetan Buddhist monks prisoner.\n\nAfter Altan Khan was given the title Shunyi Wang (\"Obedient and Righteous King\") from the Longqing Emperor in 1571, Altan Khan invited the 3rd Dalai Lama to Mongolia again and embraced Tibetan Buddhism. After some hesitation, with followers begging him not to go, Sonam Gyatso's party set out and was met at Ahrik Karpatang in Mongolia where a specially prepared camp had been set up to receive them. Thousands of animals were given to him as offerings and five hundred horsemen had been sent to escort him to Altan Khan's court. When they arrived there, they were greeted by over ten thousand people including Altan Khan dressed in a white robe to symbolize his devotion to the Dharma.\n\nSome sources say this first meeting between Sonam Gyatso and Altan Khan took place in Amdo or near (lake) Kokonor, rather than in Mongolia itself. This inconsistency may be due to some confusion in the texts or the existence of alternative accounts of this important meeting in the Tibetan literature. Besides, while Altan Khan bestowed the title Dalai on Sonam Gyatso, some claim that the latter gave the title of Brahma, the king of religion, to Altan Khan.\n\nAltan Khan had Thegchen Chonkhor, Mongolia's first monastery, built, and a massive program of translating Tibetan texts into Mongolian was commenced. Within 50 years most Mongols had become Buddhist, with tens of thousands of monks, who were members of the Gelug order, loyal to the Dalai Lama.\n\nSonam Gyatso's message was that the time had come for Mongolia to embrace Buddhism, that from that time on there should be no more animal sacrifices, the images of the old gods were to be destroyed, there must be no taking of life, animal or human, military action must be given up and the immolation of women on the funeral pyres of their husbands must be abolished. He also secured an edict abolishing the Mongol custom of blood-sacrifices. \"These and many other such laws were set forth by Gyalwa Sonam Gyatso and were instituted by Altan Khan.\"\n\nThe Third Dalai Lama publicly announced that he was a reincarnation of Phagpa, while Altan Khan was a reincarnation of Kublai Khan and they had come together again to cooperate in propagating the Buddhist religion.\n\nThe alliance with the Mongols would later prove instrumental in establishing the Gelug order as the rulers of Tibet during the reign of the Great Fifth Dalai Lama.\n\nAltan Khan died in 1582, only four years after meeting with the Third Dalai Lama. According to legend, Abtai Sain Khan was given a Buddha relic by the third Dalai Lama to help the spread of Buddhism.\n\nAltan Khan was succeeded by his son Sengge D\u00fc\u00fcreng who continued to diligently support Buddhism, and two years later the 3rd Dalai Lama made another visit to Mongolia. On his way, he founded the monastery of Kumbum at the birthplace of the great teacher and reformer, Je Tsongkhapa.\n\nGyalwa Sonam Gyatso had also founded Lithang monastery in Eastern Tibet, as well as the small monastery Phende Lekshe Ling in either 1564 or 1565, which became known as Namgyal in 1571, the personal monastery of all the subsequent Dalai Lamas. By 1585 he was back in Mongolia and converted more Mongol princes and their tribes.\n\nIn October of 1587, Gyalwa Sonam Gyatso was promoted to Du\u01d2 Er Zh\u01d0 Ch\u00e0ng (\u6735\u513f\u53ea\u5531) by the emperor, and seal of authority was given.\n\nThe Dalai Lama was again invited to visit the Ming emperor, and this time he accepted but fell ill and died (in 1588, age 45) in Mongolia while returning to Tibet.\n\nAltan Khan's great-grandson, Yonten Gyatso, was selected as the 4th Dalai Lama.\n\n\"To others give the victory and the spoils; The loss and defeat, take upon oneself\" \u2014 Sonam Gyatso.\n\nSee also"}, {"url": "http://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=The_Third_Dalai_Lama,_Sonam_Gyatso", "page_content": "Sonam Gyatso (bsod nams rgya mtsho) was born in 1543 in the Kyisho (skyid shod) region of U to a family with strong ties to the Sakya tradition and the Pagmodru rulers of Tsang. His father was Namgyel Drakpa (rnam rgyal grags pa) was an official in the government. His mother, whose family also had ties to the Pakmodru family, was Peldzom Butri (dpal 'dzom bu khrid). Her father, Wangchuk Rinpoche (dbang phyug rin po che) was a reknowned tantric master in the service of the royal household. Because of negative omens that proceeded his birth, his parents gave him the milk of a white nanny goat, earning him the name Ranusi Chopel Zangpo (ra nu sri chos 'phel bzang po) \u2013 \u201chappy boy protected by goat\u2019s milk.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom a young age he demonstrated unusual interest in all things ritual, and spoke to his parents and those around him of visions of buddhas and bodhisattvas that appeared to him on a seemingly regular basis. A local lama received a vision in which the young child was prophesied to be the incarnation of Avalokite\u015bvara, and from this point forward his reputation spread. By the time he was two years old rumors were spread that he was the reincarnation of Gendun Gyatso (dge 'dun rgya mtsho, 1476-1542) a famous abbot of Drepung (\u2019bras spungs) and Tashilhunpo (bkra shis lhun po), and the following year, in 1546, he was enthroned at Drepung by the rulers of the house of Nedong (sne'u gdong). He took his novice vows with Pa\u1e47chen Sonam Drakpa (paN chen bsod nams grags pa, 1478-1554), who gave him the name Sonam Gyatso Pelzangpo Tenpai Nyima Chok Tamche Le Nampar Gyelwa (bsod nams rgya mtsho dpal bzang po bstan pa'i nyi ma phyogs thams cad las rnam par rgyal ba). In 1552 he was made abbot of Drepung, and 1558 became abbot of Sera as well.\n\n\n\nLike his previous incarnation, Sonam Gyatso cultivated relations with members of ruling houses across Tibet, receiving an invitation from the king of Guge, Jigten Wangchuk Pegarde ('jig rten dbang phyug pad dkar lde) to propigate the Geluk tradition in Ngari (mnga' ris), although he seems to have declined this. He did become a court minister to the Pakmodru family, visiting the seat at Nedon (sne gdong) in 1559.\n\n\n\nIn 1564, at the age of twenty-two Sonam Gyatso took full ordination and gave his first teachings at Tashilhunpo Monastery.\n\n\n\nSonam Gyatso founded a numer of monasteries. Best known of these is Namgyel monastery, later the personal monastery of the Dalai Lamas. Initially it was a house at Drepung, named Dratsang Pende Lekshel Ling (grwa tshang phan bde legs bshad gling), and was later absorbed into the Potala by the Fifth Dalai Lama. In 1578, on his way to Mongolia, Sonam Gyatso stopped at the site of Tsongkhapa\u2019s birth, where a monk named Rinchen Tsondru Gyeltsen (rin chen brtson 'drus rgyal mtshan) had founded a small temple in 1560. Sonam Gyatso asked him to expand it, and in 1583 consecrated it as Kumbum Jampa Ling (sku 'bum byams pa gling), which would grow to be one of the largest Geluk monasteries in the world.\n\n\n\nSonam Gyatso's greatest missionary triumph was his forging of a relationship with the Mongol leaders. Altan Khan, the leader of the Tumet Mongols, initially sent a delegation to Drepung in the early 1570s, to invite Geluk heirarchs to Mongolia, without success. A second delegation arrived in 1577, and successfully pursuaded Sonam Gyatso to return with them.\n\n\n\nUpon meeting the two agreed to enter into a \u201cpatron-priest\u201d relationship (yon mchod) modeled on that of Pakpa Lodro Gyeltsen ('phags pa blo gros rgyal mtshan, 1235-1280) and Khubilai Khan in the thirteenth century. For Altan, patronage of the growing Geluk tradition was a way to recreate his forebears\u2019 influence in Tibet; for Sonam Gyatso, the opportunity for Mongol support for his missionary work both inside and outside of Tibet (he had earlier spent time on the Amdo borderlands spreading the Geluk teachings) was surely extremely attractive. It was at this time that Altan Khan gave Sonam Gyatso the title, in Mongolian, of ghaikhamsigh vcir-a dar-a say-in cogh-tu buyan-tu dalai, meaning \u201cwonderful Vajradhara, good, brilliant, commendable ocean\u201d and subsequently shortened to Dalai Lama.\n\n\n\nWhile still in Mongolia Sonam Gyatso received an invitation from the Ming Emperor Wanli to visit Beijing, an offer he refused. On his return to Tibet he passed through Kham and founded established Litang Chode, also known as Ganden Tubchen Chokorling (li thang chos sde; dga ldan thub chen chos 'khor gling) in 1580. The following year the twelfth abbot of Chamdo Jampa Ling, Jedrung Lhawang Chokyi Gyeltsen (rje drung lha dbang chos kyi rgyal po, 1537-1604), invited him to assume the duties of abbot of that monastery, and Sonam Gyatso thus spent about six months in Chamdo teaching, giving transmissions, and revising the monastery's codes. He then returned to Lhasa.\n\n\n\nAlthough Altan Khan died in 1582, Sonam Gyatso again returned to Mongolia, this time at the invitation of Altan\u2019s son, Dugureng. He also spent time among the Odros Mongols, converting them to Buddhism, and the Khalkha Mongols, at the invitation of Abadai Khan, who founded the first Buddhist monastery in Khalkha.\n\n\n\nSonam Gyatso passed away in 1588, in Mongolia, after a period of illness. His remains were interred at Kokekhota.\n\n\n\nSources\n\n\n\nAnon. 1977. Rje thams cad mkhyen pa bsod nams rgya mtsho'i rnam thar.

When he also spent 50 minutes at the peak, it was a world record of the longest time at the highest point on Earth. However he died of a comparatively young age of 44\u201345. For his contributions to the sport of mountaineering, government of India honoured him with Padma Shri in 1962 and Padma Bhushan in 1965.\n\nSonam Gyatso was born in Kewzing, Sikkim in 1923. He was married to Kunzang Choden and the couple had five children. Gyatso started his career in 1946 as a school teacher at Lachung. After three years he joined as a head constable of Indian Air Force. It was during this period when he got opportunity to learn mountaineering at the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute, Darjeeling in 1954. He made his first attempt in 1957 to Nanda Devi, but was unsuccessful. The following year he scaled the 26,897 feet of Cho Oyu peak, and the attempt was successful. He was a member of an all-Indian expedition, and it was for the first time when an Indian team climbed a peak of that height.\n\nIt was followed by successful expeditions such as Annapurna III in 1961, Kanchengyao in 1961, Hathi Parbat in 1963, Rathong peak and Langpo Chung in 1964.

He did become a court minister to the Pakmodru family, visiting the seat at Nedon (sne gdong) in 1559.\n\n\n\nIn 1564, at the age of twenty-two Sonam Gyatso took full ordination and gave his first teachings at Tashilhunpo Monastery.\n\n\n\nSonam Gyatso founded a number of monasteries. Best known of these is Namgyel Monastery, later the personal monastery of the Dalai Lamas. Initially it was a house at Drepung, named Dratsang Pende Lekshel Ling (grwa tshang phan bde legs bshad gling), and was later absorbed into the Potala by the Fifth Dalai Lama. In 1578, on his way to Mongolia, Sonam Gyatso stopped at the site of Tsongkhapa\u2019s birth, where a monk named Rinchen Tsondru Gyeltsen (rin chen brtson 'grus rgyal mtshan) had founded a small temple in 1560. Sonam Gyatso asked him to expand it, and in 1583 consecrated it as Kumbum Jampa Ling (sku 'bum byams pa gling), which would grow to be one of the largest Geluk monasteries in the world.\n\n\n\nSonam Gyatso's greatest missionary triumph was his forging of a relationship with the Mongol leaders. Altan Khan, the leader of the Tumet Mongols, initially sent a delegation to Drepung in the early 1570s, to invite Geluk heirarchs to Mongolia, without success. A second delegation arrived in 1577, and successfully pursuaded Sonam Gyatso to return with them.\n\n\n\nUpon meeting the two agreed to enter into a \u201cpatron-priest\u201d relationship (yon mchod) modeled on that of Pakpa Lodro Gyeltsen ('phags pa blo gros rgyal mtshan, 1235-1280) and Khubilai Khan in the thirteenth century. For Altan, patronage of the growing Geluk tradition was a way to recreate his forebears\u2019 influence in Tibet; for Sonam Gyatso, the opportunity for Mongol support for his missionary work both inside and outside of Tibet (he had earlier spent time on the Amdo borderlands spreading the Geluk teachings) was surely extremely attractive. It was at this time that Altan Khan gave Sonam Gyatso the title, in Mongolian, of ghaikhamsigh vcir-a dar-a say-in cogh-tu buyan-tu dalai, meaning \u201cwonderful Vajradhara, good, brilliant, commendable ocean\u201d and subsequently shortened to Dalai Lama.\n\n\n\nIn 1579, with the patronage of Altan Khan, Sonam Gyatso founded Jangchen Monastery in the Khalkha lands. While still in Mongolia Sonam Gyatso received an invitation from the Ming Emperor Wanli to visit Beijing, an offer he refused. On his return to Tibet he passed through Kham and founded established Litang Chode, also known as Ganden Tubchen Chokorling (li thang chos sde; dga ldan thub chen chos 'khor gling) in 1580. The following year the twelfth abbot of Chamdo Jampa Ling, Jedrung Lhawang Chokyi Gyeltsen (rje drung lha dbang chos kyi rgyal po, 1537-1604), invited him to assume the duties of abbot of that monastery, and Sonam Gyatso thus spent about six months in Chamdo teaching, giving transmissions, and revising the monastery's codes. He then returned to Lhasa.\n\n\n\nAlthough Altan Khan died in 1582, Sonam Gyatso again returned to Mongolia, this time at the invitation of Altan\u2019s son, Dugureng. He also spent time among the Odros Mongols, converting them to Buddhism, and the Khalkha Mongols, at the invitation of Abadai Khan, who founded the first Buddhist monastery in Khalkha.\n\n\n\nSonam Gyatso passed away in 1588, in Mongolia, after a period of illness. His remains were interred at Kokekhota.\n\n\n\nMiranda Adams. Published September 2008\n\n\u2190\n\n1 (current)\n\n\u2192\n\nAnon. 1977. Rje thams cad mkhyen pa bsod nams rgya mtsho'i rnam thar.

He was born in a noble family nearby Lhasa City in Tibet in 1543 and died in 1588. It is said that his family was the earliest family which believe in Buddhism in Tibet region. His family was proud of the strong political power in local. In 1546 during Ming Dynasty, Sonam Gyatso was invited to Drepung Monastery as the reincarnation of Gendun Gyatso \u2013 the 2nd Dalai Lama. It is the official beginning of the reincarnation system of Living Buddha of Gelug Sect. In 1552 he became the Great Master of Drepung Monastery. In 1558 he became the Great Master of Sera Monastery.\n\nIn 1542 the last year before Sonam Gyatso born, the 2nd Dalai Lama \u2013 Gendun Gyatso passed away. Gendun Gyatso was once the Great Master of Drepung Monastery and Sera Monastery. As the marriage is strictly prohibited in Gelug Sect, the reincarnation system of Living Buddha has been succeeded successfully. The method of reincarnation system is bound up with the Buddhist metempsychosis and immortal soul theory. After the death of the last Living Buddha, the leadership of the monastery will look for some children. The children were born at the same time when the Living Buddha died or later. One of them will be collected to be the reincarnation of the last Living Buddha. Afterwards, the child will be brought to the monastery and educated to be the Great Master of the monastery. Sonam Gyatso was collected to be the reincarnation of Gendun Gyatso. When Sonam Gyatso was 4 years old he was brought to the monastery. He grew up in the Drepung Monastery.\n\nAfter a long time of strict religious education and training in Drepung Monastery, Sonam Gyatso took Sonam Tsapa as his teacher when he was 7 years old in 1549. Sonam Tsapa was the Great Master of Drepung Monastery at that time. When he was 11 years old in 1553, Sonam Gyatso succeeded to be the Great Master of Drepung Monastery. He was the 12th Great Master of Drepung Monastery.\n\nWhen he was 22 years old in 1564, he took Gele Basang as his teacher. He learned a lot of classic Buddhists scriptures and started to preach in some places. He went to Tashilhunpo Monastery of Shigatse and Shannan Prefecture, etc, to advocate Buddhists spirit. Many believers took his as their teacher, too. When he got back to Lhasa City, he took charge of the Great Master of Sera Monastery. He was the 13th Great Master of Sera Monastery.\n\nAt that time there are a lot of Buddhist sects in Tibet Region and Qinghai Province such as Sakya Sect, Karkyu Sect and Gelug Sect. Karkyu is also called White Sect. It was the powerful sect in Tibet at that time as it was supported by the local government. Gelug Sect was founded by the Tsongkhapa, the famous great master in Tibet Buddhism history, and it influenced more and more people. Gelug Sect developed quickly. Gelug Sect started to be supported by the local government, too, and respected by Ming Dynasty. After that, Sonam Gyatso devoted advocating Gelug Sect in Tibet region, Qinghai Province and even Inner Mongolia.\n\nPlease enjoy reading the following one: The 3rd Dalai Lama Biography."}, {"url": "http://www.tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=3rd_Dalai_Lama", "page_content": "Sonam Gyatso, 3rd Dalai Lama\n\nSonam Gyatso (Tibetan: \u0f56\u0f66\u0f7c\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f53\u0f58\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f5a\u0f7c\u0f0b, Wylie: bsod nams rgya mtsho, ZYPY: Soinam Gyaco) (1543\u20131588) was the first officially recognized Dalai Lama, although the title was retrospectively given to his two predecessors.\n\nHe was born near Lhasa in 1543 and was recognised as the reincarnation of Gendun Gyatso and subsequently enthroned at Drepung Monastery by Panchen Sonam Dragpa, who became his tutor. Panchen Sonam Dragpa was the 15th Ganden Tripa and his texts still serve as the core curriculum for many Gelugpa monasteries. The third Dalai Lama studied at Drepung Monastery and became its abbot. His reputation spread quickly and the monks at Sera Monastery also recognised him as their abbot.\n\nAccording to Sumpa Khenpo, the great Gelug scholar, he also studied some Nyingmapa tantric doctrines.\n\nWhen one of Tibet's kings, who had been supported by the Kagyupa, died in 1564, Sonam Gyatso presided over his funeral. His political power, and that of the Gelugpas, became dominant in Tibet by the 1570s.\n\nOrigin of the title \" Dalai Lama\n\nIt has been commonly claimed that the title \"Dalai Lama\" was first bestowed by the Mongolian ruler Altan Khan upon Sonam Gyatso in 1578.\n\nSince the time of Genghis Khaan, only people who were of his royal lineage were allowed to rule Mongolia. This frustrated many would-be rulers who were not of this line. Altan khan was the most destructive of these usurpers. He perceived that through the Buddhist faith he could gain legitimacy by claiming to be a reincarnation of Khublai Khaan.\n\nAltan khan chose the Gelug order of Tibetan Buddhism (founded by Tsongkhapa, 1357-1419). In 1577 he invited the leader of this order, Sonam Gyatsho, to come to Mongolia and teach his people Sonam Gyatsho proclaimed Altan Khan to be the reincarnation of Khublai Khan, and in return, Altan Khan gave the title Dalai Lama to Sonam Gyatsho. Altan Khan posthumously awarded the title to his two predecessors, making Sonam Gyatsho the 3rd Dalai Lama.\n\nSonam Gyatso, a monk of the Gelugpa (Yellow Hat) school of Buddhism, was responsible for finding a foreign patron for Gelugpa institutions. He found this patron in the Altan Khan.\n\nAltan Khan first invited the 3rd Dalai Lama to Mongolia in 1569, but apparently the Dalai Lama refused to go and sent a disciple again, who reported back to the Dalai Lama about the great opportunity to spread Buddhist teachings throughout Mongolia. In 1573 Altan Khan took some Tibetan Buddhist monks prisoner.\n\nAltan Khan invited the 3rd Dalai Lama to Mongolia again in 1571 and embraced Tibetan Buddhism. After some hesitation, with followers begging him not to go, Sonam Gyatso's party set out and was met at Ahrik Karpatang in Mongolia where a specially prepared camp had been set up to receive them. Thousands of animals were given to him as offerings and five hundred horsemen had been sent to escort him to Altan Khan's court. When they arrived there, they were greeted by over ten thousand people including Altan Khan dressed in a white robe to symbolize his devotion to the Dharma.\n\nSome sources say this first meeting between Sonam Gyatso and Altan Khan took place in Amdo or near (lake) Kokonor, rather than in Mongolia itself. Further, some claim that Altan Khan bestowed the title Dalai on Sonam Gyatso, while the latter gave the title of Brahma, the king of religion, to Altan Khan. These inconsistencies may be due to some confusion in the texts or the existence of alternative accounts of this important meeting in the Tibetan literature.\n\nAltan Khan had Thegchen Chonkhor, Mongolia's first monastery, built, and a massive program of translating Tibetan texts into Mongolian was commenced. Within 50 years most Mongols had become Buddhist, with tens of thousands of monks, who were members of the Gelug order, loyal to the Dalai Lama.\n\nSonam Gyatso's message was that the time had come for Mongolia to embrace Buddhism, that from that time on there should be no more animal sacrifices, the images of the old gods were to be destroyed, there must be no taking of life, animal or human, military action must be given up and the immolation of women on the funeral pyres of their husbands must be abolished. He also secured an edict abolishing the Mongol custom of blood-sacrifices. \"These and many other such laws were set forth by Gyalwa Sonam Gyatso and were instituted by Altan Khan.\"\n\nThe Third Dalai Lama publicly announced that he was a reincarnation of Phagpa, while the Altan Khan was areincarnation of Kublai Khan and they had come together again to cooperate in propagating the Buddhist religion.\n\nThe alliance with the Mongols would later prove instrumental in establishing the Gelukpa as the rulers of Tibet during the reign of the Great Fifth Dalai Lama.\n\nAltan Khan died in 1582, only four years after meeting with the Third Dalai Lama.\n\nAltan Khan was succeeded by his son Sengge D\u00fc\u00fcreng who continued to diligently support Buddhism, and two years later the 3rd Dalai Lama made another visit to Mongolia. On his way, he founded the monastery of Kumbum at the birthplace of the great teacher and reformer, Tsongkhapa. (He had also founded Lithang monastery www.thetibetpost.com in Eastern Tibet and a small monastery which soon became known as Namgyal, the personal temple for the Dalai Lamas.) By 1585 he was back in Mongolia and converted more Mongol princes and their tribes. The Dalai Lama was again invited to visit the Ming emperor and this time he accepted but fell ill and died in Mongolia while returning to Tibet.\n\nAltan Khan's great-grandson, Yonten Gyatso, was selected as the 4th Dalai Lama.\n\n\"To others give the victory and the spoils; The loss and defeat, take upon oneself\" \u2014 Sonam Gyatso.\n\nSource\n\nWikipedia:3rd Dalai Lama\n\n\n\n"}]}
