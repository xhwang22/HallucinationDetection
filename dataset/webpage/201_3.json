Brady is widely regarded as the greatest quarterback of all time.\n\nAfter playing college football at Michigan, Brady was selected 199th overall by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft, later earning him a reputation as the NFL's biggest draft steal. He became the starting quarterback during his second season, which saw the Patriots win their first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXVI. As the team's primary starter for 18 seasons, Brady led the Patriots to 17 division titles (including 11 consecutive from 2009 to 2019), 13 AFC Championship Games (including eight consecutive from 2011 to 2018), nine Super Bowl appearances, and six Super Bowl titles, all NFL records for a player and franchise.

Never having a losing season, he is the NFL leader in career quarterback wins, quarterback regular season wins, quarterback playoff wins, and Super Bowl Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, as well as being the only Super Bowl MVP for two different franchises. Additional accolades held by Brady include the most Pro Bowl selections and the first unanimous NFL MVP. The only quarterback to win a Super Bowl in three separate decades, Brady is also noted for the longevity of his success. He is the oldest NFL MVP at age 40, the oldest Super Bowl MVP at age 43, and the oldest quarterback selected to the Pro Bowl at age 44.

On my first day of shooting, watching Sarah Jessica Parker and Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon playing together, and noticing Natasha upstairs in her building, and how playful they were, how joyful they were\u2014I was getting a front-row seat to the energy and the brilliance of Sex and the City.\"\n\nMoynahan makes her return in the third episode of the series, when Carrie discovers that her\u2014spoiler alert\u2014late husband has left $1 million to his ex. The gesture causes Carrie to spiral in her signature fashion, and she essentially stalks Natasha all over the city\u2014and the Internet. Carrie not only emails Natasha asking to meet in person, but follows up via direct message on Instagram, where she swiftly gets blocked. Oh, and she also pays a visit to Natasha's workplace, where her assistant politely explains, \"Natasha can't meet with you today. She's in Rome.\" (Natasha is not in Rome.)\n\n\n\nMore From Harper's BAZAAR play icon The triangle icon that indicates to play\n\nThe episode ends with Carrie unexpectedly bumping into Natasha at an Upper West Side coffee shop (while she's using the toilet in a public bathroom, no less). The women can no longer avoid each other, so they have a catharsis of sorts with Carrie apologizing (again) for the harm she caused Natasha by having an affair with Big and Natasha admitting she never understood why Big married her. The scene\u2014though comical\u2014also demonstrates that Natasha and Carrie have changed in different ways: Natasha has moved on, while Carrie, still grieving, of course, is stuck in the past.\n\n\"I think that Natasha has moved on with her life\u2014gotten remarried and had children and has a complete life, possibly a version of the life that she had thought she was going to have with Big,\" Moynahan says. \"What's nice about when she and Carrie come together is that they finally have somewhat of a heart-to-heart. And that moment when Natasha is able to say to her, 'I don't know why he ever married me, because he was always in love with you'\u2014it's Natasha's realization and work and therapy over the years. I don't think she's confused about it at all. And to give that to Carrie is a really wonderful gift for them both.\"\n\nBridget Moynahan filming And Just Like That... in New York City. Gotham // Getty Images\n\nFor fans of the original show, the scene raises an important question: Were we too hard on Natasha?\n\nNatasha Naginsky was easily one of the most underrated characters in the Sex and the City universe. While viewers could often relate to the metropolitan antics of Carrie, Miranda, Samantha, and Charlotte, Natasha always remained out of reach. She was a model-esque fashion industry executive, as stunning as she was intimidating. When Mr. Big became enamored with her following his first big breakup with Carrie, the show positioned her as the polished polar opposite of our favorite scrappy columnist.\n\nDuring the initial run of the series, it was hard not to root for Carrie during the ups and downs of her romance with Big. Looking back, however, especially through a 2021 lens, it may be time we give the character of Natasha a little more credit. Why did it have to be Carrie vs. Natasha? Why did Big get away with being such an absolute indecisive prick?\n\n\"This generation thinks differently than the generation that existed when the show was coming out,\" Moynahan says. \"At the time, and for few years afterwards, I heard comments from people and fans who were really protective of Carrie, even though she was the one having an affair with my husband. They didn't really see it from that point of view. They didn't see the wrong in that situation, because they liked Charlotte and Miranda and Carrie\u2014they protected their girls no matter what.\"\n\nSarah Jessica Parker as Carrie and Bridget Moynahan as Natasha in And Just Like That.... HBO\n\nMoynahan has never taken the Natasha discourse personally. \"The fans love all these characters, and they became so involved in their lives\u2014and now there's a whole new group of people who are getting invested in this story and going back and watching from the beginning,\" she says. \"I'm so happy that they're addressing issues that we deal with in this age group, too\u2014death and divorce and sickness, or questioning relationships or changing career paths or whatever it is in age. It's nice that they're not shying away from anything.\"\n\nShe adds, \"It's a testament to the creators, the writers, even the stylists and the actors\u2014they have all put so much into this show. And they've created an incredible fan base from every angle. The fans are committed\u2014they're laughing and cheering and crying and participating in every moment with the characters. It's a phenomenon.\""}, {"url": "https://pagesix.com/2021/07/20/bridget-moynahan-returns-as-natasha-in-and-just-like-that/", "page_content": "Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\nNatasha\u2019s back with all of her teeth.\n\nBridget Moynahan, who played Mr. Big\u2019s second wife, Natasha Naginsky, on \u201cSex and the City,\u201d was spotted on the set of HBO Max\u2019s revival, \u201cAnd Just Like That\u2026,\u201d Monday.\n\nWhile filming in the Big Apple\u2019s Soho neighborhood, Moynahan, 50, was dressed in costume, wearing a Stella McCartney khaki skirt, a pale blue top and nude-colored gladiator-style sandals.\n\nShe also appeared to be wearing a wedding ring, though it\u2019s unclear who her husband is in the new series.\n\nShe portrayed Mr. Big\u2019s second wife, whom he cheated on with Carrie. ROGER WONG/INSTARimages.com\n\nFans of \u201cSex and the City\u201d will recall that Big (Chris Noth) cheated on Natasha with Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), and she learned of the infidelity in a dramatic way that resulted in her falling down the stairs and chipping her tooth.\n\nAfter Natasha\u2019s accident, Carrie broke up with Big before they eventually reunited and got married.

Yes, I wasn\u2019t eating or sleeping, but at least I felt good about my marriage. Now I\u2019m just one of the wives he was taking care of?\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/bridget-moynahan-sex-and-the-city-interview/", "page_content": "Warning: Spoilers for episode 3 of And Just Like That ahead.\n\nIn the original Sex and the City, neither Carrie nor audiences had very much sympathy for Natasha, played by Bridget Moynahan. But not unlike Meredith Blake from The Parent Trap, Amy March from Little Women, or even Cruella De Vil, audiences have begun to reconsider how Natasha was characterized and perceived when she first appeared on the show. What made her character such a villain, anyway? Was Natasha really terrible? Or did we just think she and her cohort were terrible because they worked hard to embody perfect femininity\u2014which is still perceived as being untrustworthy\u2014and because they were set up as oppositional to a lovably flawed heroine? Probably the latter.\n\nWhen she first appeared in season 2 of the original hit HBO series, Natasha was the offensively beige, elegant 25-year-old model Mr. Big married after spending years toying with Carrie and refusing to commit. Who didn\u2019t feel Carrie\u2019s catharsis when she declared, \u201cThe woman\u2019s an idiot!\u201d\u2014because of a grammatical error Natasha made on a thank you note? It seemed like the only times Natasha was allowed to slip from Stepford-esque idyll to actual human were in moments of humiliation, like tripping down the stairs and chipping a tooth in front of the woman her husband cheated on her with (that would be Carrie).\n\nNatasha was set up as a foil to Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie, but if you look just, like, half an inch deeper, you may notice they\u2019re more alike than not. They are both beautiful, thin, well-dressed, well-heeled, occasionally clumsy white women in love with the same man who was treating them both badly. Which is a point And Just Like That appears to be trying to make with Natasha\u2019s return in the third episode of the rebooted series. Discovering that Mr. Big has bequeathed his ex-wife Natasha $1 million in his will (without telling Carrie, the lawyer, or even Natasha ahead of time), Carrie slips immediately back into old patterns: obsessing over what Big was and was not telling her about her former romantic rival.\n\nSo, when does Natasha get to speak for herself? Well, now, actually.\n\nMoynahan counts herself as a fan of Sex and the City as well as being a part of its legacy, and she takes no issue with fans then or now who vilified her character on behalf of their fave, Carrie. Here, the actress tells Marie Claire how she doesn\u2019t pay attention to comments on the internet and is unfazed by bad-faith critique. Mostly, Moynahan is just happy to be here, and happy to finally bring Carrie and Natasha\u2019s relationship full circle.\n\n(Image credit: Raymond Hall/GC Images)\n\nMarie Claire: How did you get involved with the reboot and how did it feel reprising your role?\n\nBridget Moynahan: There's a scene in this episode where Natasha is up in her office and she's on the phone and she just looks down and she sees Carrie and her girlfriends down there, looking up at her. As Bridget, watching these girls do their thing, it was so much fun. Because it was Sex and the City back again, from the heels to the outfits to the girls\u2014who are not girls anymore. They're grown mature women with adult responsibilities...[but] in some ways they just have that joyful spirit still. And it was just so much fun for me as an actor and as a fan to be watching that.\n\n[Showrunner] Michael Patrick King had called me\u2014 I don't know when he called me, sometime early spring, maybe\u2014and he said, 'Hey, would you consi\u2014' I don't even think he got the word \u2018consider\u2019 out of his mouth before I said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 They had come out with a couple movies and I hadn't gotten the call and I was like, 'I wonder if they'll bring Natasha back?!' So I was really so thrilled that they did bring her back for this. And it didn't really matter what [MPK] asked me to do. I mean, if he asked me to be in a background scene, I would've done that. But it was a nice little storyline to play with and in some ways more emotional and real than the two characters have ever really been with each other.\n\nMC: I think a lot of viewers felt like Natasha got the short end of the stick in terms of characterization. Did you ever feel that while filming the original? Had you ever seen any of these comments and did you agree?\n\nBM: Fans had said something to me in person on the street in New York. They would say something, and I'd be like, 'Yeah, but she cheated with my husband!' They didn't really think about it that way. They were just protecting their Carrie...[the fans] are loyal to these characters and it's just wonderful. I think it's a testament to the writing, and the creation of these characters and these actors who brought them to life.\n\nMC: What was your initial reaction to reaction to Big dying?\n\nBM: I just thought, 'Yeah. OK. Great.' This was a natural way for [the writers] to get into things and a reality of women of a certain age, men of a certain age. So it felt like a real possibility and a really beautiful way to jump back into these lives that everybody had fallen in love with in their \u201830s and take a real, but still fun, look at what their lives are like in their \u201850s. \u2026People are literally grieving a character and a relationship and a love that they've all really felt like they've gone on this journey together.\n\nMC: In this episode we get a little more of Natasha's perspective. How did you feel about the bonding moment she and Carrie had?\n\nBM: I think that one of the sweet moments that the writers had put in there\u2014and I would imagine it's a hard thing to admit for [Natasha]\u2014is, 'He always loved you.' And to be able to give that gift to Carrie of like, 'There's no reason why he should have ever married me.' For Carrie to hear that and for her to accept in that moment when she's so confused and grieving. It's nice in a way for Natasha and Carrie to leave on the same page. Like, \u2018Let's not do this anymore.\u2019\n\nMC: We also get a glimpse of Natasha's life. Do you have any more ideas of where she is now? Is she married? Is she a single mom?\n\nBM: I definitely think she's married and she has two kids and a very nice life and moved on. I'm sure it was an unusual thing to get the call about Big leaving something to her in the will\u2014which she's explained she's not going to take.\n\nMC: Did you feel any certain way about that bathroom scene, which is such a fun, throwback slap-sticky Sex and the City moment?\n\nBM: I often explain that my first experience with Sex and the City was like having to jump into an ongoing Double Dutch jump rope game. It was a well-oiled, big show, and I was just a new actor getting a chance to be on the show, and just had to jump in and hopefully not mess up. I felt the pressure and I felt nervous. And cut to how many years later, coming on the show, I definitely felt more relaxed and more grounded, but still super excited to be there.\n\nWhen I read the script, and I saw that scene in the coffee shop and in the restroom, I was like, 'Okay, I guess I'm doing this!'\u2026I've been doing Blue Bloods for 12 years. They're not shooting a scene of me in the toilet! So it was definitely out of my comfort zone from what I've been doing, but so exciting to be able to do something more playful and comedic. It's such a joy to be able to watch and work with Sarah Jessica Parker, who is such a pro and so talented, and just watching her make her adjustments and her natural talent come through, it's so wonderful.\n\nMC: Do you hope that through this episode people might take away a slightly more nuanced view of Natasha?\n\nBM: I think people are just going to have fun watching the episodes\u2026and it's all to have fun and enjoy it. I think it's really refreshing for [the show creators] to take on this in the way they have\u2014not trying to go back and create something that they've already done\u2014but we're going to deal with everything that's going on now and we're gonna embrace it all\u2026Whether it's single motherhood or questioning marriage or death or age or whatever it is. They take it on and they have fun with it.\n\nMC: I feel like the Natasha character fits pretty neatly into current cultural conversations of the women we vilify and the women we side with; how we pit women against each other. I wondered if you had any thoughts about that or if you felt like the narratives have evolved?\n\nBM: I think we've evolved in some ways and we haven't in others. There are so many conversations [now] about supporting each other and women breaking glass ceilings\u2014and we have a vice president now who\u2019s a woman\u2014and there are a lot of ways that things have changed and grown. And then you have all the negative things that you find on Instagram or [on] different social media platforms where people are picking apart women's [and] girls' looks and making them feel insecure or not beautiful for who they are. So we haven't grown in those areas. Natasha being in the show, you see that she's moved on. You see that [Carrie and Natasha] come together and have a nice moment together at the end; that kind of releases some of that from the past.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."}, {"url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/07/we-couldnt-help-but-wonder-why-is-natasha-on-the-sex-and-the-city-revival-set", "page_content": "HBO Max\u2019s Sex and the City revival, And Just Like That\u2026, may be revisiting one of Carrie Bradshaw\u2019s (Sarah Jessica Parker) darker chapters. Bridget Moynahan, who played Mr. Big\u2019s (Chris Noth) second wife Natasha, was spotted apparently filming the SATC sequel in New York City\u2019s SoHo neighborhood on Monday.\n\nIn new photos, Moynahan can be seen walking down the street in a knee-length Stella McCartney khaki skirt, pale blue top, tan gladiator sandals, and an oversized green bag. HBO Max hasn\u2019t confirmed that Natasha will appear in the revival, but her character would be a buzzy addition to the project.\n\nFans may remember Natasha as the pearl-wearing, beige-loving 20-something who steals Mr. Big\u2019s heart at the end of Sex and the City\u2019s second season. (\u201cYou string me along for two years and you marry some 25-year-old girl after five months!\u201d Carrie howls at one point.) By the third season, Carrie and Mr. Big dive headfirst into an ill-fated affair, which Natasha dramatically discovers before tumbling down a flight of stairs and chipping her tooth.\n\nAs someone who thinks about Natasha\u2019s final confrontation with Carrie (justice for this woman\u2019s differently colored teeth!) on a weekly basis, her apparent return to SATC is rife with possibility. Did Natasha ban Carrie from ever stepping foot in another Ralph Lauren? Did she write a tell-all about being betrothed to a toxic bachelor? Most importantly, has her tragic dental situation been remedied?\n\nBased on newly acquired intel from Page Six, it appears that Carrie and Natasha may be finding common ground with one another. According to the outlet, a script from the revival has leaked\u2014and it doesn\u2019t bode well for Big and Carrie\u2019s marriage. In the excerpt, Carrie brunches with Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), Charlotte (Kristin Davis), and Samantha stand-in Stanford Blatch (Willie Garson). She tells the group: \u201cI was taping the podcast, I was washing my hair. Yes, I wasn\u2019t eating or sleeping, but at least I felt good about my marriage. Now I\u2019m just one of the wives he was taking care of?\u201d Given her possible split from Mr. Big, Carrie and Natasha could bond over their shared entanglement with Manhattan\u2019s resident commitment-phobe\u2026on Carrie\u2019s podcast perhaps?\n\nAll shall be answered when the revival hits HBO Max. If Moynahan returns to the show, she\u2019ll join veteran cast members Noth, David Eigenberg as Steve, Evan Handler as Harry, Garson as Stanford, and Mario Cantone as Anthony.

She made her last appearance the following season, after the then-married Natasha caught Carrie with Big.\n\nWill the messiness come full-circle again? Fans will have to wait until \u201cAnd Just Like That...\u201d debuts.

After the drama of Kim Cattrall's noticeable absence from teaser trailers and Sarah Jessica Parker officially announcing that Samantha's storyline has ended, it would appear that no one is guaranteed a part in the reboot. As for whether Moynahan will be returning to reprise her role as Natasha, she says that people ask her this question all the time. And her response? \"I don't really know,\" she admits. \"I haven't heard anything about that. It's definitely that show that just keeps giving; everyone gets re-excited every couple of years by it because something new comes out with it. For me, that's a gift that keeps giving.\"\n\nFans seem to be obsessed with the idea of Natasha making a comeback on the show, as many see her as the SATC underdog. One Twitter user wrote, \"the main character in sex and the city is natasha.\" Another user Tweeted, \"bridget moynahan in sex and the city is simply *chef's kiss*.\"\n\nWell, regardless of if Moynahan is asked to make an appearance in the reboot, she has nothing but positive feelings for her time on the show. \"It's always nice to go back and have the energy around that show, which really was one of the first projects I did. It really was the jump-start of my career. I've always felt really great about that\" (via NewBeauty)."}, {"url": "https://decider.com/2021/12/16/and-just-like-that-episode-3-hbo-max-who-is-natasha-bridget-moynahan/", "page_content": "WARNING: SPOILERS FOR THE FIRST THREE EPISODES OF AND JUST LIKE THAT\u2026 ON HBO MAX AHEAD!\n\nHBO Max\u2019s And Just Like That\u2026 is full of ghosts. Metaphoric ones, that is. So far we have not seen Mr. Big (Chris Noth) visit his wife Marley (and Marley) style like in A Christmas Carol, but hey! It could happen.\n\nNo, what we mean is that And Just Like That\u2026 is full of ghosts from the original run of HBO\u2019s Sex and the City haunting Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) in the present day. So far we\u2019ve gotten Bitsy (Julie Halston) and Susan Sharon (Molly Price), but this week a real nightmare from Carrie\u2019s past returns: Natasha (Bridget Moynahan). Way back in the original run of Sex and the City, Carrie\u2019s heart was shattered when Big married the younger, beautiful, and seemingly perfect Natasha. However the tables eventually turned and Carrie wound up ruining Natasha\u2019s life in a spectacularly cruel way.\n\nCarrie\u2019s unhealthy obsession with Big\u2019s ex-wife Natasha resurrects itself zombie style in And Just Like That\u2026 Episode 3 \u201cWhen in Rome\u201d but what exactly went down between Carrie and Natasha back in the day?\n\nWhether it\u2019s been years since you first binged Sex and the City or you\u2019re new to the well-heeled world of Carrie, Charlotte (Kristin Davis), and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), here\u2019s everything you need to know about Natasha Naginsky and what she\u2019s doing in HBO Max\u2019s And Just Like That\u2026\n\nWHO WAS NATASHA ON SEX AND THE CITY?\n\nBridget Moynahan\u2019s Natasha Naginsky first appeared in Sex and the City Season 2 Episode 17 \u201cTwenty-Something Girls vs. Thirty-Something Women.\u201d It was the episode where Carrie and her friends go to the Hamptons and Charlotte gets crabs! Carrie is shaken to run into Big and his 20-something girlfriend Natasha and finds herself reeling when she learns they are engaged in the Season 2 finale.\n\nIn Sex and the City Season 3, Carrie and Natasha\u2019s rivalry gets darker. After Big weds Natasha and Carrie partners up with Aidan Shaw (John Corbett), Big tells Carrie he misses her and they start an affair. In Sex and the City Season 3 Episode 11 \u201cRunning with Scissors,\u201d Natasha catches Carrie and Big in the act. While chasing Carrie out of her apartment, Natasha trips and gets hurt, losing a tooth and cutting her lip. Carrie takes her to the ER and ends it with Big. In the next episode Carrie reveals the affair to Aiden and Carrie and Aiden break up (for the first time).\n\nThe last time Natasha appeared on Sex and the City was in Season 3 Episode 17 \u201cWhat Goes Around Comes Around.\u201d Carrie saw Natasha at a restaurant and demanded to clear the air to rid herself of bad karma. (How very Carrie!)\n\nSo what would ever bring Natasha back into Carrie\u2019s life in And Just Like That\u2026? What else? Big.\n\nHOW DOES NATASHA RETURN ON HBO\u2019S AND JUST LIKE THAT\u2026?\n\nIn And Just Like That\u2026 Episode 3 \u201cWhen in Rome,\u201d Carrie attends the reading of Big\u2019s will and is stunned to learn that he left $1 million to Natasha. This reveal sends the widowed Carrie down a dangerous paranoid spiral. She starts looking around the apartment for signs of an affair between Big and Natasha and openly worries he still held a torch for his second wife.\n\nCarrie attempts to email and Instagram DM Natasha, only to be ignored and blocked, respectively. Losing her cool, Carrie decides to visit Natasha at her office. Natasha asks her assistant to lie about her whereabouts, placing her in Tokyo when Carrie knows full well Natasha is in NYC. (This leads to an awkward encounter where Natasha sees Carrie pointing at her from the street.)\n\nLater, Carrie finds herself walking the city to soothe her nerves and when she has to pee, she goes into Matcha on the UWS. (Fun fact: Not too far from where Mabel and Charles and Oliver live in Only Murders in the Building!) When Carrie opens the bathroom door, she discovers \u2014 thanks to a faulty lock \u2014 that Natasha is inside. Natasha accuses Carrie of stalking her but softens upon seeing a scalding coffee burn on Carrie\u2019s wrist.\n\nNatasha and Carrie finally talk. Natasha reveals she had no contact with Big since their divorce and was surprised he bequeathed her money. Natasha adds she will not take the cash and will instead donate it to charity. She ends the convo by saying she never knew why Big married her in the first place as he was always in love with Carrie.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it! Once again Natasha is a figure upon which Carrie projects her insecurities and once more Carrie behaves rather abominably towards the wholly innocent woman. Truly her one flaw is confusing their and there.\n\nNatasha deserves to be rid of Carrie and Big forever (and if I was her I would take the cool mill and buy a lot of scented candles with it). But at least And Just Like That\u2026 once again took narrative pains to present Natasha as a perfectly lovely person who never deserved the wild storm of betrayal and obsession Carrie threw at her!\n\nWhere to stream And Just Like That..."}, {"url": "https://www.justjared.com/2021/07/20/bridget-moynahan-returning-as-natasha-for-and-just-like-that/", "page_content": "It looks like Bridget Moynahan will be back for And Just Like That, too!\n\nThe 50-year-old actress was spotted on the set of the HBO Max companion series to Sex and The City, on Monday afternoon (July 19) in New York City.\n\nShe was seen chatting with showrunner Michael Patrick King on the set, and was all masked up when not shooting her scenes.\n\nBridget famously starred as Natasha in the original series, who is the second wife of Mr. Big (Chris Noth).\n\nWhile it\u2019s not known how many episodes she will be in at the moment, Bridget will join Chris, as well as John Corbett, Willie Garson, and a few other original stars opposite Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t see, some of the script was reportedly leaked and there are a ton of new plot details for the show.
