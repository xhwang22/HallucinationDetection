In Ontario, French or French-language education remained a contentious issue for nearly a century, from 1890 to 1980, with English-speaking Catholics and Protestants aligned against French-speaking Catholics.\n\nThe Upper Canada School Act (1797) and Adolphus Egerton Ryerson\u2019s School Act (1846) gave French equal status with English, German and Gaelic. In 1885, Minister of Education George Ross introduced new regulations requiring schools to provide English instruction two hours daily in the first four years of elementary school and four hours daily in the final four years. These regulations did not alleviate the anti-French sentiment in Ontario.\n\nDuring the 1886 election, the Toronto daily newspaper The Mail wrote that schools in Prescott and Russell (East Ontario) were \u201cthe nurseries not merely of an alien tongue but of alien customs, of alien sentiments, and [\u2026] a wholly alien people.\u201d The historian Robert Choquette said that \u201ca growing number of English Protestant Ontarians see French and Catholic as synonyms of ignorant, backward, and foreign.\u201d\n\nIn 1910, the growing number of Franco-Ontarians organized the Association canadienne-fran\u00e7aise d\u2019\u00e9ducation de l\u2019Ontario (ACF\u00c9O) to protect and promote the French language. They were opposed by the Orange Order, which demanded English-only education, and by Irish Catholics, led by Bishop Michael Francis Fallon of London, Ontario.\n\nRegulation 17\n\nA commission headed by Francis Walter Merchant, the province's chief school inspector, concluded that the quality of education and of English instruction in bilingual schools was inadequate. The commission recommended better teacher training and the flexible introduction of English as the main language of instruction. The government, responding more to political than to educational imperatives, decided instead to focus on restricting the use of French.\n\nIn 1912, Ontario Premier James Pliny Whitney\u2019s Conservative government issued Regulation 17, which limited the use of French as the language of instruction and communication to the first two years of elementary school. Regulation 17 was amended in 1913 to permit French as a subject of study for one hour per day.\n\nEscalation to National Conflict\n\nDuring the First World War the Ontario schools question escalated to a national conflict, contributing to the tensions surrounding the 1917 conscription crisis and further alienating French Canadians in Qu\u00e9bec and Ontario from Prime Minister Robert Borden\u2019s Conservative government. At the federal level, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council decided that Regulation 17 was constitutional because denominational school guarantees did not include language. However, it ruled that the commission appointed by the government to enforce its policy in Ottawa was unconstitutional. A political compromise came after war tensions had faded away. Senator Belcourt, spokesperson for the ACF\u00c9O, and the Unity League of Ontario, representing influential English-speaking Ontarians, worked for conciliation. Another commission composed of F. W. Merchant, Judge J. H. Scott (an Orangeman) and Louis Cot\u00e9 (a francophone lawyer) agreed that Regulation 17 was a failure and that it perpetuated inferior schooling.\n\nUnable to enforce Regulation 17 despite being one of its leading proponents, Premier Howard Ferguson scrapped it in 1927 and introduced a new policy promoting improved bilingual instruction. French was given legal status in schools, and the University of Ottawa Normal School (a teachers\u2019 college) was officially recognized. However, Regulation 17 remained on the statute book until 1944, when the Ontario regulations were revised.\n\nHope Commission\n\nIn 1945, the Royal Commission on Education in Ontario (Hope Commission), created by George Drew\u2019s Conservative government, revived the debate on French-language schools. It tabled a report in 1950 recommending that French-language instruction be limited to the first six years of elementary school and that the University of Ottawa Normal School be closed. In 1951, the ACF\u00c9O challenged nearly all of the Hope report recommendations, since they would have the effect of limiting French-language instruction in Franco-Ontarian schools. Premier Leslie Frost promptly responded that his government did not stand behind the Hope Commission, and the report\u2019s main recommendations were not implemented.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1960, Ontario had 45 private French-language secondary schools, run by approximately 15 religious communities as well as secular priests in Ottawa and Hearst. These teaching communities were the only ones with the staff and financial means to support secondary schools. However, by the early 1960s, French-language private schools were finding it increasingly difficult to compete with public secondary schools, and many of them closed.\n\nThe Hall-Dennis Commission and B\u00e9riault Committee\n\nIn March 1967, the ACF\u00c9O submitted a brief asking for a system that would bring together public and private Franco-Ontarian secondary schools. On 24 November 1967, Premier John Robarts responded by creating the Committee on French-Language Schools in Ontario, chaired by Roland B\u00e9riault.\n\nIn 1968, the Provincial Committee on Aims and Objectives of Education in the Schools of Ontario (Hall-Dennis Commission) published the first three years of research results in a report called Living and Learning. Justice Emmett Hall (Ottawa) and educator Lloyd Dennis (Toronto) recommended that the Ministry of Education develop programs for students studying primarily in French and learning English as a second language.\n\nThe B\u00e9riault Report, also published in 1968, was strongly influenced by Living and Learning and laid the foundation for a full-fledged French-language school system in Ontario encompassing both primary and secondary education.\n\nThat same year, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed the Schools Administration Act (Bill 140) and the Secondary Schools and Boards Act (Bill 141), providing for the creation of French-language secondary schools. In 1969, the first network was formed with a core of 6 previously \u201cbilingual\u201d public secondary schools and 16 formerly private Franco-Ontarian secondary schools.\n\nSturgeon Falls School Crisis (1971)\n\nBills 140 and 141 did not entirely alleviate language tensions. In at least two places \u2014 Sturgeon Falls and Penetanguishene \u2014 providing French-speaking students with separate schools to protect their culture stirred up controversy.\n\nIn 1970, Sturgeon Falls was a small town with an economy that was based on the pulp and paper industry and a population that was 80 per cent French-speaking. The Nipissing School Board was repeatedly asked to make the bilingual Sturgeon Falls Secondary School exclusively French-speaking, as 1,200 of its 1,600 students were francophone.\n\nThe Nipissing School Board maintained the status quo, saying that the estimated cost of building a new school for the 400 English-speaking students was too high. In September 1971, with the support of their families, French-speaking students boycotted classes and prevented others from registering. On 7 September, with the full support of the Franco-Ontarian associations, they formed picket lines and attempted to prevent teachers and English-speaking students from entering the school. In late September 1971, accompanied by adults, 200 French-speaking students staged a sit-in at the secondary school.\n\nFaced with this turn of events and rising tensions, the Bill Davis government took action. Midway through the election campaign, Minister of Education Robert Welch created the Ministerial Commission on French Language Secondary Education, headed by Thomas H. B. Symons of Trent University in Peterborough. In December, the Commission published a preliminary report recommending the creation of a French-language secondary school in Sturgeon Falls. After meeting with Symons, the Nipissing School Board agreed. The bilingual school became Franco-Cit\u00e9, and the English-speaking Northern Secondary School opened in 1976.\n\nPenetanguishene School Crisis (1979\u20131980)\n\nDespite the actions of Symons, Welch and Davis, other school crises erupted. In Cornwall, Franco-Ontarian students went on strike in support of demands that the Saint-Laurent Secondary School become exclusively French-speaking. They succeeded, and the new school was named La Citadelle. Other minor school crises occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s, notably in Geraldton/Longlac, Burlington, Kirkland Lake and Windsor. A major crisis broke out in Penetanguishene during the Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty referendum (see Qu\u00e9bec Referendum in 1980), and the so-called \u201cPenetang school crisis\u201d drew national attention.\n\nLocated on the southeaster shore of Georgian Bay, Penetanguishene had a population of approximately 6,000 in the late 1970s, of whom over 80 per cent were of francophone origin and 40 per cent had French as their mother tongue. Since the Penetanguishene Secondary School was a bilingual institution with an English-speaking culture and did not offer full study programs in French, the French Language Advisory Committee of the Simcoe School Board asked that a separate school be built. The Board refused the request, along with others submitted by the Committee. With support from the Franco-Ontarian community, Penetanguishene francophones opened a resistance school in 1979.\n\nPenetanguishene therefore became a symbol for the fight to develop Franco-Ontarian culture. The community received support from the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and the Commissioner of Official Languages. On 12 October 1979, Minister of Education Bette Stephenson refused the request from francophone parents to build a French-language secondary school, stating that it was a decision for the school board to make.\n\nDebate moved to the courts, which ruled in favour of the Penetanguishene Franco-Ontarians. Bill Davis\u2019 Conservative government promised to cover 95 per cent of the cost of building a French-language secondary school. It opened in 1982, the year that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms came into force, and was named \u00c9cole secondaire Le Caron in honour of Friar Joseph Le Caron, who said the first mass in Ontario on 12 August 1615.\n\nSchool Management\n\nThe schools question was not yet resolved. From 1984 to 1993, a number of court cases tested section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In 1984, the Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled that Franco-Ontarians were entitled to play a greater role in managing their schools. In 1989, two French-language school boards were created: one in Toronto and one in Ottawa. However, Franco-Ontarians were not given full control over the management of their schools until Mike Harris\u2019 Conservative government passed Bill 104 in 1997. Ontario now has eight French-language Catholic school boards and four French-language public school boards.\n\nFormal Apology for Regulation 17\n\nOn 22 February 2016, Premier Kathleen Wynne issued an official apology, on behalf of the Government of Ontario, to Franco-Ontarians for the adoption of Regulation 17 and its harmful impact on their communities. A motion requesting the apology had been put forward by Sudbury MP Glenn Thibeault in December 2015."}, {"url": "https://guides.library.utoronto.ca/c.php?g=394609&p=2786233", "page_content": "Circular 14 was a publication issued by the Ontario government and provided to school boards from 1887-1996.

With the exception of its early years, the circular was published annually in January. From the years 1952 to 1991, two supplements (Circular 14A, released in the spring, and Circular 14B, released in the fall) were issued with updated listings.

McGuinty, personal communication, December 11, 2019). They recognized teachers as critical partners in leading reform and took action to rebuild a trusting relationship with them. The government abolished some policies such as paper-and-pencil testing of new teachers and the professional development requirement, which had been perceived by many teachers as punitive, and replaced them with an induction program for new teachers and simpler system of teacher performance evaluation (Levin, 2008). Although the original reform design was top-down, reform leaders began to realize the need to develop capacity in districts and schools so that the drive for change did not only originate from the highest levels of leadership (M. Fullan, personal communication, December 9, 2019).\n\nDemonstrating gains in student outcomes made by reform efforts was instrumental in securing funding to support programming. Over the course of the reform, the sustained focus on outcomes contributed to a rise in the education budget from $10 billion to $21 billion (D. McGuinty, personal communication, December 11, 2019). Equally important was fostering meaningful relationships with teachers and principals to maintain an understanding of what was happening in the classroom. A critical part of McGuinty\u2019s \u201cresolute\u201d leadership was combining his persistence in pursuing reform goals with his demonstration of empathy towards educators (Fullan, 2010). McGuinty held a roundtable with principals once every couple of months to learn about how the reform was being perceived (D. McGuinty, personal communication, December 11, 2019). Furthermore, the Ministry put in place a Partnership Table which brings the Minister of Education together with all major stakeholders on a regular basis. Most policy issues are discussed at these meetings before finalization and announcement (Levin, 2008).\n\nA significant part of creating an environment for progress involved removing \u201cdistractors\u201d which were preventing teachers from reaching their potential in the classroom and rebuilding a healthy relationship with teachers (D. McGuinty, personal communication, December 11, 2019). One of the most important developments in freeing teachers from their extracurricular obligations was the signing of a 4-year collective bargaining agreement (OECD, 2011). Previously, teachers were involved in labour negotiations for agreements which lasted only 2 years. Inspired by the cross-sector cooperation in Ireland which fueled rapid economic growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s, McGuinty helped to extend the term of agreements to allow teacher to devote their resources toward the classroom. Reducing class size was another strategy to remove distractors from the table. Although the research did not offer unanimous support for smaller class size, teachers had expressed concern at having to teach too many students (D. McGuinty, personal communication, December 11, 2019). As part of the collective agreement signed in 2005, the government supported 200 min of weekly preparation time for all elementary teachers which led to creation of about 2,000 new teaching positions for specialists. By 2007, 90% of the province\u2019s primary classes (K-3) had twenty or fewer students and about 5,000 new teachers were introduced into the elementary school system (Levin, 2008).\n\nThe system of support provided to principals and teachers was based on their conception as \u201clead learners\u201d who, like their students, needed access to expertise from professionals and peers. In fostering a more collaborative teaching culture to raise student achievement, teachers were provided with strong individual classroom support. They were encouraged to take an \u201cassessment for learning and as learning\u201d approach to their professional learning, which involves specifying goals and implementation strategies, working with peers and engaging in pedagogical reflection (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2010). Learning involves not only teachers\u2019 peers but also their students as a vital source of feedback in their personal and professional development.\n\nIn an analysis of teaching culture in Ontario school boards, Hargreaves, Shirley, Wangia, Bacon, and D\u2019Angelo (2018) noted a transition from professional collaboration, which is a descriptive approach that refers to how teachers collaborate and emphasizes the equality of all teachers, to the more prescriptive approach of collaborative professionalism, which involves professionals working together to improve student achievement and wellbeing. This approach emphasizes a sense of shared responsibility and values all voices in contributing to a collaborative and equitable learning culture. Key elements of this approach also include regular feedback in professional learning and development as well as collective responsibility among students, defined by \u201ca moral responsibility and a central professional obligation\u201d to student success (Hargreaves et al., 2018). In contrast to the culture of collaboration during the previous administration, once \u201cdistractors\u201d had been removed from their workload, teachers were able to focus on developing their teaching skills and be more intentional in their collaboration with their colleagues and students.\n\nCollaborative inquiry, which is an integral part of collaborative professionalism, played a significant role in Ontario educational policy starting in 2010 based on its ability to enhance teacher and student learning by engaging educators as researchers. Consultants and coaches worked with schools to encourage educators to reflect on their practice in collaborative inquiry, not as an expert but as a partner in learning. \u201cCoaching at the elbow\u201d gave teachers the assistance from instructional coaches as they attempted and practiced new strategies in literacy (Hargreaves & O\u2019Connor, 2018). Evidence suggests that opportunities for teachers to receive this kind of support and coaching during implementation is a feature of effective programs internationally (Ingvarson, Meiers, & Beavis, 2005). Furthermore, research has found that the level of school support emerges as an \u2018enabling condition\u2019 for professional development as it influences the extent of active learning, follow-up and feedback and significant effects on program outcomes.\n\nAnother key strategy in providing support for students was resourcing parents to create their own improvement plans. The Parents Reaching Out (PRO) fund allowed school councils and parent organizations to apply for grants to start activities designed to support student learning at school ($1,000 for parent projects), regional or provincial level (up to $30,000). The province made significant investments in education and ensured these funds were distributed among schools and dedicated towards programming which empowered teachers and parents. This initiative was significant because it was an investment in innovation and an act of trust. Ontario funded over 5,500 school council PRO projects and over 200 regional projects with a budget of over $10 million (Mourshed et al., 2010). This program embodied another key component of the reform which was implementing policies and practices that increased individual and collective capacity to achieve accountability via shared responsibility, achieving both internal and external accountability.\n\nAlthough equity was not an explicit goal of the reform, supports were put in place to narrow the achievement gap among schools. The \u201cturnaround schools\u201d program offered additional support to a small number of low-achieving schools who opted in voluntarily. The number of these schools had been reduced by 75% by 2006 (Levin, 2008), at which point these schools were put under the administration of the LNS and the Ontario Focused Intervention Partnership (OFIP) was established. OFIP is an equity strategy which identifies high needs schools and addresses them with a non-stigmatizing attitude and targeted support by working with educators and stakeholders to plan school improvement strategies. The OFIP School Strategy provides support to OFIP 1 schools, in which under 34% of students are underachieving in reading, and OFIP 2 schools, in which up to 50% of students were demonstrating low performance (Audet et al., 2007)."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/murray-g-ross/", "page_content": "Murray George Ross, OC OOnt (April 12, 1910 \u2013 July 20, 2000) was a Canadian sociologist, author, and academic administrator.

Ross Award, one of the highest honours for a graduating student.\n\nThe award, which is typically presented during spring convocation, recognizes one student for outstanding academic excellence and notable contributions to the University.\n\n\u201cI have had the pleasure of working with Aly in his role as a president\u2019s ambassador and witnessing first-hand his passion for improving the student experience at York,\u201d said President and Vice-Chancellor Rhonda L. Lenton. \u201cAn engaged campus leader who lives his values, Aly has made a profound impact on student life at the University and I look forward to seeing what he accomplishes next.\u201d\n\nDuring his time at York, which he describes as a \u201crich academic experience,\u201d Fawzy took several upper year kinesiology electives and pursued practical research activities. He received an Undergraduate Student Research Award (USRA) from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) to conduct vascular research with Professor Tara Haas using molecular biology techniques. His work was presented as a poster in a research conference at the University, and he went on to complete his undergraduate honours thesis with Haas.\n\n\u201cI presented my work as an undergraduate thesis manuscript, which taught me a lot about scientific writing,\u201d said Fawzy.\n\nOutside the classroom, Fawzy was immersed in many student success programs and student clubs, many at Stong and Calumet Colleges. He was a peer tutor and a peer mentor with the Kinesiology and Health Science student Organization (KAHSSO), and become president of KAHSSO in his fourth year, overseeing its free peer tutoring and peer mentoring programs and student success events. Fawzy also held roles as a president\u2019s ambassador, a student health ambassador and an executive at two student clubs: The Canadian Association of Research in Regenerative Medicine (CARRM) and SickKids. Additionally, he held governance positions including as a student representative at the Faculty of Health petitions committee and the Faculty of Health Council. He also sat on the Student Success Council at Stong and Calumet Colleges.\n\nA point of pride for Fawzy is his role in the creation of the Ambassador Program under KAHSSO with the help of the executive council and support of Stong and Calumet colleges. The program, he said, was initially created to enhance events on campus, but is now evolving to go beyond campus and engage high school students as well create a kinesiology alumni network and many other initiatives in the local community geared around mental health and career exploration.\n\n\u201cIt is really difficult for me to pinpoint one learning experience that was most valuable,\u201d said Fawzy. \u201cRather, the most valuable things I learned came from my mentors at York University, outside the classroom. My time interacting and working with Drs. Mazen Hamadeh (Head of Stong College), Jennine Rawana (Head of Calumet College), and Tara Haas (Kinesiology Professor) as well as President Lenton when I was a president\u2019s ambassador were the most valuable learning experiences for me at York. I learned a wide range of skills ranging from leadership, communication and networking to culturing cells and working with mice models for research. Truly a rich and diverse learning experience.\u201d\n\nYork, he said, is an \u201coutstanding educational institution,\u201d noting the kinesiology program ranked No. 1 in Canada and 16th in the world in 2017 (ShanghaiRanking). \u201cYork provided me with endless opportunities, from research, to student success programs, to having a say in decisions and providing my ideas/proposals directly to the University president. I am very grateful for those opportunities that allowed me to excel and develop life skills during my time at York.\u201d\n\nAs for earning the award, he says he feels thankful and humble.\n\n\u201cIt is quite an honour to be recognized with the past recipients of this award who have done tremendous things during their time at York. It really motivates me to continue to excel both academically and also with my involvement in student success programs and other extracurriculars.\u201d\n\nFawzy hopes to pursue a career in medicine as a physician scientist."}, {"url": "https://fampeople.com/cat-murray-g-ross", "page_content": "Murray G.

Fenner took those words to heart. Not long after starting at York as a student in 2004 at the ripe age of 40, he decided to put that advice into practice.\n\nSeeing that there was a real lack of services catering to the older student, Fenner decided to start the York University Mature Students Organization (YUMSO), a club where students could find a quiet place to study, counselling, social activities and a place to connect. But that\u2019s not all. Fenner also revived Existere: Journal of Arts and Literature at York, now a thriving, student-run venture.\n\nRight: Edward Fenner with his wife Linda after receiving the Murray G. Ross Award Monday\n\nIt is for these two things in particular, as well as his academic achievements \u2013 he\u2019s on the Dean\u2019s Honour Roll \u2013 that Fenner was awarded the Murray G. Ross Award, named for York\u2019s founding president, during the Spring Convocation ceremony Monday. Fenner graduated with an Honours BA in professional writing with a minor in science & society studies. \u201cI was thunderstruck, really. I was beside myself. It is an amazing feeling,\u201d he says about receiving the medal.\n\nHis nominator for the award, Brian Poser, associate director of the Atkinson Centre for Mature & Part-time Students (ACMAPS), says when he brought together all of Fenner\u2019s accomplishments, their number surprised even him. In addition to earning several scholarships, Fenner is publisher and former executive editor of Existere, and is a three-time winner of the Kent Haworth Playwriting Contest and two-time winner of the Vanier College Master\u2019s Award for Outstanding Contribution to Student Life. He still found time to volunteer at Vanier College\u2019s annual book sale and have two plays produced with Vanier College Productions.\n\nFor his contributions, he was made a Fellow of Vanier College, an unusual honour for an undergraduate student. Last Thursday, he was also awarded a Vanier Master\u2019s Award for Academic Achievement & Outstanding Contribution to the college.\n\nLeft: The Murray G. Ross medal\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s shown himself to be a tireless worker and he\u2019s a nice emblem for lifelong learning,\u201d says Poser. \u201cHe has a vision and he goes after it.\u201d\n\nWhen Fenner first started at York, he expected to be like any other mature student. He had found that without a degree he was being passed over for promotions at work and wanted to remedy that. \u201cI came back to school with my eyes wide open to get a better position and pay,\u201d he says.\n\nThe first meeting he held for YUMSO in 2004 attracted 28 students. \u201cIt took off from there. When I left in 2008 there were about 600 members. There are about 700 or so now,\u201d says Fenner. \u201cIt really gives students a leg up with things.\u201d\n\nThe mandate of supporting mature students was taken up by ACMAPS when it started in 2007, but YUMSO continues to thrive, often working in concert with ACMAPS. Fenner served with ACMAPS as its first student adviser and prior to that was hired by Student Community & Leadership Development on contract to help organize the first University-wide orientation for mature and part-time students. He is currently a member of ACMAPS\u2019s Advisory Board.\n\nFenner hopes to broaden the reach of mature students through his latest project \u2013 the Canadian Assembly of Mature Student Organizations, which he got off the ground last year and is now developing a Web site for. It will be a place where mature student organizations from universities and colleges across the nation can come together and share their expertise, experiences and challenges. \u201cI\u2019m a self starter,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I saw a need to gather and share information.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to Existere, housed at Vanier College, Fenner realized the journal, which had gone by the wayside, had a lot of potential. It is an up-and-coming journal, publishing work from York students as well as from writers as far away as Asia, Africa and Europe. Montreal-based poet Rebecca Leah P\u00e3pucaru, whose work appeared in the spring/summer 2009 edition of the journal, has had her poem selected to be published in the upcoming 2010 anthology of The Best Canadian Poetry in English, edited by poet Lorna Crozier and published by Tightrope Books. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we broke into that kind of thing. We\u2019re really quite tickled by that,\u201d says Fenner.\n\nLeft: Founding York President Murray G. Ross\n\nExistere is more than a journal; it is an opportunity for students to gain some experiential learning, says Fenner, who is also the publicist for the annual Words Alive Literary Festival. \u201cIt gives them an opportunity that they wouldn\u2019t necessarily get through normal school activities. It\u2019s not a product of their studies, but it is a collaborative effort. It\u2019s important enough that it contributes to Canadian culture.\u201d\n\nHe hopes Existere will one day become one of the leading literary journals in this country, but for now he is pulling back and letting other students take over as he concentrates on his new studies. He will begin a master\u2019s degree in the new Graduate Program in Science & Technology Studies at York in the fall, while working at York International.\n\nSo what did Fenner get out of his involvement? (He stopped counting, he says, after 2,000 volunteer hours.) \u201cI got the satisfaction of creating something that was useful to people. The mature students\u2019 profile has been raised and is being given more attention, and with Existere \u2013 it is spreading York talent and skills beyond our borders.\u201d\n\nAs Poser says, \u201cEdward stands as an excellent model of what tremendous success can be accomplished when someone is fully engaged in curricular and extracurricular life.\u201d A perfect fit for the Murray G. Ross Award.\n\nBy Sandra McLean, YFile writer"}, {"url": "https://archivesfa.library.yorku.ca/fonds/ON00370-f0000398.htm", "page_content": "Biographical Sketch/\n\nAdministrative History:\n\nMurray George Ross (1910-2000), educator and author, was born in Canada and educated there and in the United States, receiving the Ed.D from Columbia University (1949).
