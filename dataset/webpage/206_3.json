After a year in the Le Mans Endurance Series, he returned to the FIA GT with Vitaphone Racing, helping the squad take two Team *les before winning the Drivers *le himself in 2007.\n\nIn spite of having won the drivers *le in the GT1 cl*, Biagi downgraded to GT2 in 2008, to drive a Ferrari 430 for AF Corse.\n\nRacing record\n\nComplete International Formula 3000 results\n\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicate fastest lap.)\n\n24 Hours of Le Mans results\n\n24 Hours of Daytona\n\n(key)\n\nComplete International Superstars Series results\n\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\nComplete Porsche Supercup results\n\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\n\u2020 Did not finish, but was cl*ified as he had completed more than 90% of the race distance.\n\nSources\n\nExternal links"}], "Thomas Biagi competed in the International Formula 3000 Championship.": [{"url": "https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/opportunity-of-a-lifetime-when-a-gt-ace-realised-his-f1-dream/6560973/", "page_content": "Repainted in a dour grey and red befitting of its uninspiring new name, the Midland EJ15B that had competed in the 2005 Formula 1 season as Jordan was shared by several drivers for testing at Jerez that December. A forgettable chapter in the long history of the Silverstone team now known as Aston Martin it may be, but to Thomas Biagi it is a prized memory of a career that had its finest days in GT racing.\n\nThe 2003 FIA GT champion had been out of single-seaters for three years by the time he landed his long-awaited test opportunity, a decade after his last official test with Minardi at Fiorano in 1995.\n\nA stalwart of International Formula 3000 and its Italian/European cousin between 1995 and 2002, Biagi\u2019s crushing victory at Donington in 2001 \u2013 against opposition that included F1 2008's nearly-man Felipe Massa \u2013 was the exception rather than the rule.\n\nBut even at 29, Biagi never lost sight of his F1 goal \u2013 \u201cI believe in the power of your dream,\u201d he says \u2013 and despite having no manager in his corner convinced team boss Colin Kolles to give him a run out with a view to racing in 2006.\n\nWith the 2005 Toyota V10 powerplant behind his back, he completed 91 laps and lapped 1.37s quicker than new Midland signing Christijan Albers in an EJ15B with a 2006-spec V8.\n\nBiagi felt quickly at ease with the car as it was easier, he says, than his 2005 steed \u2013 the Maserati MC12 \u2013 \u201cbecause the weight of the car, the downforce, all of the electronic sup-port like traction control, differential that helps you\u201d.\n\nThomas Biagi, 2005 Midland F1 test Photo by: Motorsport Images\n\n\u201cFor me it was nice and easy for me to drive a Formula 1 car, [but] then to be world champion is another story!\u201d he laughs. \u201cThe test went extremely well, in the end they were extremely happy about my performance and my consistency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame because in the end they showed me an agreement to make a full season, but I was just missing the budget. We were pretty close.\u201d\n\n\"There are no words that can describe the feeling this kind of engine behind your shoulders gives you. I miss the F1 of the end of the '90s and beginning of the 2000s\" Thomas Biagi\n\nMidland used a bevy of third drivers in 2006, with Markus Winkelhock (four), Giorgio Mondini (nine), Adrian Sutil (three), Alexandre Premat and Ernesto Viso (one each) all taking their turns to drive on grand prix Fridays. Biagi wasn\u2019t among them and continued in GT1, but that wasn\u2019t the end of his F1 story.\n\nA chance paddock meeting with Kolles in 2007, when Biagi was commentating on GP2 for Sky Sport Italy, yielded an offer to sign a race-by-race deal for the renamed Spyker team in place of the cash-strapped Albers. But budget was again a stumbling block and Biagi remained in the MC12 to claim a second FIA GT title.\n\nIn his place, Winkelhock made a memorable debut at the rain-hit European GP. Thanks to a pre-race switch to wets, he was in the lead when the waterlogged track \u2013 with an expensive carpark forming in the Turn 1 gravel \u2013 caused the race to be red-flagged.\n\n\u201cWatching the race from home and seeing that the car I was supposed to drive was leading was strange!\u201d says Biagi, who would rack up further sportscar titles in Italian GT (2012) and International GT Open (2016) after prevailing in the Italian-based Superstars tin-top series in 2010.\n\nMarkus Winkelhock, Spyker F8-VII leads Felipe Massa, Ferrari F2007 Photo by: Lorenzo Bellanca / Motorsport Images\n\nA final opportunity for a crack at the F1 whip came in 2010, the year three new teams arrived on the grid, when he found a sponsor that tabled \u201ca reasonable budget\u201d. But by this point, Biagi concedes he \u201cwas definitely too late\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to do a couple of races, but that\u2019s life,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the years after I achieved very good results in GT categories so I\u2019m happy about my career.\u201d\n\nOpportunity of a lifetime: A fallen Indycar star's Jaguar F1 test\n\nAnd he at least had the good fortune to drive a contemporary V10\u2026\n\n\u201cThere are no words that can describe the feeling this kind of engine behind your shoulders gives you,\u201d he says. \u201cI miss the F1 of the end of the '90s and beginning of the 2000s, because for me, F1 is that kind of sound.

The 1995 championship was also marred by a fatal accident on the last lap of the season.\n\n1993\n\nBy the beginning of 1993, Reynard had killed off the competition and theirs was now the only chassis being used in what was theoretically still a multi-make championship.\n\nHowever the competition between the drivers was as close as ever. In a season of just nine rounds \u2013 the shortest the championship had seen so far \u2013 three drivers arrived at the final with a chance to win the title.\n\nAmong them were Pedro Lamy, who finished second to Olivier Beretta in the season-opener at Donington, then won round three at Pau. But Lamy\u2019s championship bid was strewn with incidents.\n\nAt Enna he tangled with Pacific driver David Coulthard, then spun off later in the race. Coulthard went on to win, capping a string of three consecutive podium finishes which saw him arrive at the final round with a crack at the title.\n\nEnna had been the usual crash-fest, the red flags coming out after a series of accidents around the high-speed Sicilian circuit. The wrecked machinery piled up at the Hockenheimring as well \u2013 first Eric Angelvy was flipped on lap two, then five cars were eliminated in another crash at the beginning of lap three:\n\nHowever Hockenheim also saw Olivier Panis begin streak of wins which continued at the Nurburgring and Spa. That meant he went to Nogaro for the last race of the year one point ahead of Coulthard and Lamy \u2013 the latter having tangled with rivals at the Nurburgring and Silverstone.\n\nBut the title showdown was a damp squib. Lamy went out on lap three while well out of the points positions. Coulthard\u2019s throttle cable snapped and so Panis claimed the title, despite having been taken out by Vincenzo Sospiri.\n\nGo ad-free for just \u00a31 per month >> Find out more and sign up\n\n1994\n\nLola returned to the fray in 1994 but were powerless to prevent another Reynard whitewash. Now in its tenth season, F3000 had begun to face some of the same problems which had ended the old Formula Two championship \u2013 chief among which were ever-rising costs. Plans were formed to switch to a single-chassis formula from 1996.\n\nFranck Lagorce and Gil de Ferran were the early pace setters. At the season-opener Lagorce led Coulthard home, but the latter had been unable to persuade Frank Williams to finance his F3000 season and would, at any rate, land an F1 promotion after Ayrton Senna was killed in the San Marino Grand Prix.\n\nDe Ferran won the next race at Pau and took the lead in the championship, then followed it up with another victory at Enna. Lagorce hit back with his second win of the year at Hockenheim, moving two points clear at the top of the table.\n\nWith three races left in the championship, Jean-Christophe Boullion was trailling by 19 points in the standings. It had been a frustrating season thus far: during qualifying at Enna he had been shocked to come across a group of marshals standing in the track and crashed as he swerved to avoid them.\n\nHowever in the rain at Spa he passed Lagorce around the outside at Blanchimont and won while the points leader posted his first no-score at the year. De Ferran led at Estoril but was taken out by a rival: Boullion took his second win while Lagorce again failed to add to his tally.\n\nThe trio arrived at Magny-Cours separated by a single point. Lagorce beat Boullion to pole, but in a classic showdown Boullion passed Lagorce to take the win and the title. Neither, however, went on to last a full season in Formula One.\n\nWhile the main F3000 championship had persistently eluded Marco Apicella, he clinched the Japanese title in 1994, albeit in controversial fashion after this final-round tangle with rival Andrew Gilbert-Scott.\n\n1995\n\nSuper Nova duo Vincenzo Sospiri and Ricardo Rosset \u2013 who would be reunited at Lola\u2019s ill-fated F1 effort two years later \u2013 were the prime contenders in the 1995 championship. Rosset led a one-two for the team in the season-opener at Silverstone, but the positions were reversed next time out at the Circuit de Catalunya.\n\nPau should have been a benefit for the DAMS team as their cars occupied the front row of the grid for the annual race around the narrow street course. But pole sitter Tarso Marques and team mate Guillaume Gomez collided within seconds of the start, letting Sospiri by to take his second win.\n\nThe carnage at Enna was milder than usual and Rosset led another Super Nova one-two. Significantly, for the fourth race in a row a Lola had made it among the points scorers. Marc Goosens had been a regular top six finisher previously, reaching the podium at Pau, and now Marco Campos and Jerome Policand made it onto the score sheet.\n\nFinally at the Hockenheimring Goosens became the first driver to win an F3000 race in something other than a Reynard since Jean-Marc Gounon in the 1992 season finale. Lola victories would be more commonplace from 1996, however, as they had won the right to become the series\u2019 exclusive chassis supplier.\n\nHaving crashed in Germany Sospiri hit back with a win at Spa. That left him 12 points clear of Rosset with two rounds to go, and as neither reached the podium in the remaining races Sospiri collected the title with a round to spare.\n\nBut the very last lap of the season at Magny-Cours brought tragedy. Campos was trying to pass Thomas Biagi\u2019s Reynard when the pair collided, launching the Lola over the barrier at the Adelaide hairpin. Campos suffered serious injuries when his head struck the barrier and the 19-year-old died in hospital the following day.\n\n1996\n\nA revamped Formula 3000 championship returned in 1996. Now a single-specification formula for chassis and engines, the calendar was expanded to ten races including two visits to Hockenheim as the series supported both F1 (three times) and the short-lived International Touring Car championship (at five rounds). Despite this the championship continued to struggle to receive regular television coverage (note how few videos there are of this and other mid-nineties seasons).\n\nThe introduction of a standard chassis helped to bring costs down but budgets remained a problem for several drivers. They including Kenny Brack, who mounted a bid for the championship after winning the final race of 1995, and Tom Kristensen, who was left without a drive after the Shannon team collapsed.\n\nBrack won the season-opener at the Nurburgring ahead of Jorg Muller but their positions were reversed at Pau. Brack had joined champions Super Nova while Muller was driving for Helmut Marko\u2019s team.\n\nThe title battle see-sawed between the pair throughout the year. Muller moved ahead at Pau, where Brack crashed. A mid-season brace of wins for Brack but him ahead again, but Muller hit back with a triumph of his own at Spa.\n\nCrash at season finale decides title\n\nUnfortunately this fine season-long contest ended in controversy. The pair arrived at the Hockenheimring for the final race knowing a win for either would make them champion. Brack led the early stages but was passed by his rival. Then on lap 18 Muller came under attack: his rival drew alongside approaching the final chicane but squeezed Muller hard, triggering a collision.\n\nWhile Muller crashed out, Brack continued, but within a couple of laps he had been shown the black flag for his role in the contact. Brack ignored it and crossed the finishing line in first place, but once his disqualification took effect Muller was confirmed as champion.\n\nHowever concerns were growing over the difficulties top F3000 drivers had experienced in finding an F1 berth. Brack and Sospiri never started an F1 race, and Boullion only made a handful of appearances in the 1995 season. The switch to a single-make formula had not cured all of the championship\u2019s problems.\n\nThe Japanese championship also ended in drama. Ralf Schumacher had a two-point lead over his team Le Mans team mate Naoki Hattori as the championship reached its climax at Fuji.\n\nBut Schumacher spun out in dreadful conditions on lap three. That opened the door for Hattori to take the title, but seven laps from home he too spun off, handing Schumacher the title.\n\nFormula 3000 memories will continue tomorrow.\n\nF1 history"}, {"url": "https://www.speedsport-magazine.com/race-driver-database/biography/thomas-biagi_-_80.html", "page_content": "\n\n: Formula Racing Level 1\n\n: Formula Racing Level 2\n\n: Formula Racing Level 3\n\n: Formula Racing Level 4\n\n: Sportscars Prototypes\n\n: Sportscars GT\n\n: Touringcars\n\n: One-Make Series F.1 : Formula Racing Level 1 F.2 : Formula Racing Level 2 F.3 : Formula Racing Level 3 F.4 : Formula Racing Level 4 SP : Sportscars Prototypes GT : Sportscars GT TC : Touringcars OM : One-Make Series\n\nIntermediate standings during the current season.Wins and Top-Positions in season standings are marked.When racing in several series in a season the chronologically later participation is always on top."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/thomas.biagi/1847841", "page_content": "Thomas Biagi\n\nracecar driver\n\nMarch 7, 1976 Bologna, Province of Bologna, Italy\n\nBiagi started his career in single seaters, driving in Formula Alfa Boxer and Italian Formula Three Championship, where he was 5th best in 1995, with two wins.
