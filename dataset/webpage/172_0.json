Uspje\u0161na sezona sa Rudarom privukla je pa\u017enju \u017deljezni\u010dara za koji potpisuje 1. jula 2002. godine.\n\nSa dolaskom u FK \u017deljezni\u010dar, Hasagi\u0107 je shvatio da mu je ovo odli\u010dna prilika te je vezao odli\u010dan nastup za odli\u010dnim nastupom.\n\nU samo dvije sezone sa \u017deljezni\u010darom upisao je 55 nastupa i osvojio svoj prvi i jedini trofej u karijeru, a to je bio Kup BiH u sezoni 2002/2003.\n\nKenan Hasagi\u0107 je definitivno jedan od najboljih golamana u historiji BH fudbala\n\nKvalitetni nastupi u \u017deljezni\u010daru su naveli tada\u0161njeg selektora reprezentacije BiH da mu da \u0161ansu, te Hasagi\u0107 postaje prvi golman reprezentacije BiH.\n\nDruga \u0161ansa u Turskoj koju nije propustio\n\nKenan Hasagi\u0107 sredinom 2004. godine ponovo se seli u Tursku, ali ovaj put obla\u010di dres Gaziantepspora, te postaje standardan u startnoj postavi.\n\nKroz tri godine sa Gaziantepsporom pokazao je koliko je konstantan i pouzdan golman te tako\u0111er da povrede ne uti\u010du mnogo na njega. Upisao je 86 nastupa i postao favorit turskog kluba.\n\nU 2007. godini \u010dini svoj posljednji transfer u karijeri i prelazi u Istanbul Basaksehir. Iako se tada Basaksehir nije borio za titulu i nije predstavljao preveliku prijetnju velikoj trojci Hasagi\u0107 se uvijek trudio da svoj klub stavi u najbolju mogu\u0107u poziciju.\n\n\u010cinjenica da je Hasagi\u0107 nakon zavr\u0161etka svoje karijere ostao u fudbalu kao trener golmana pokazuje koliko voli ovaj sport i koliko voli golmansku poziciju.\n\nOdlazi iz Basaksehira kao omiljen me\u0111u navija\u010dima i svojim kolegama igra\u010dima. Zvani\u010dno se penzionisao 2012. godine nakon pet godina u klubu i upisanih 97 nastupa.\n\nKenan je u svojevremeno bio zaposlen u bh. premijerliga\u0161u Tuzla City kao trener golmana u stru\u010dnom \u0161tabu kojeg je predvodio trener Nermin Ba\u0161i\u0107.

Dolaskom Fuada Muzurovi\u0107a, Hasagi\u0107 nije dolazio na okupljanja reprezentacije BiH, a njegovo mjesto zauzeo je Adnan Gu\u0161o.\n\nKenan se na gol reprezentacije BiH vratio u kvalifikacijama za EURO 2008 kada je branio na \u010detiri me\u010da.\n\nOpet je uslijedila pauza od nacionalnog dresa, da bi me\u0111u stative ponovo stao u prijateljskom me\u010du protiv Japana 2008. godine.\n\nKenan Hasagi\u0107 vs David Villa\n\nNa otvaranju kvalifikacija za Svjetsko prvenstvo u Ju\u017enoj Africi 2010. godine, BiH je gostovala kod reprezentacije \u0160panije gdje je pora\u017eena minimalnim rezultatom 1:0.\n\nNa tom me\u010du Kenan Hasagi\u0107 urezao se u srca svih bh. navija\u010da kada je poslao vrsnog napada\u010da Davida Villu, ni manje ni vi\u0161e, nego po \u201c\u0107evape\u201d.\n\nU bara\u017eu za odlazak na pomenuto takmi\u010denje Hasagi\u0107 je branio u obje utakmice, ali na\u017ealost selekcija BiH je ostala bez plasmana na Mundijal 2010. godine.\n\nNakon toga, nastavio je Kenan Hasagi\u0107 biti standardan u kvalifikacijama za EURO 2012. godine.\n\nPosljednji susret u dresu reprezentacije BiH, Hasagi\u0107 je odigrao u Parizu 2011. godine kada je BiH remizirala protiv Francuske 1:1, ali na\u017ealost utakmicu je napustio nakon 45 minuta zbog povrede.\n\nU tih devet godina u dresu reprezentacije BiH, Hasagi\u0107 je branio 43 puta.\n\nZa kraj vam donosimo kompilaciju najboljih poteza koje je Kenan Hasagi\u0107 napravio u karijeri.\n\nPREPORU\u010cENO ZA VAS:"}, {"url": "https://fbref.com/en/players/b0322004/Kenan-Hasagic", "page_content": "About FBref.com\n\nFBref.com launched (June 13, 2018) with domestic league coverage for England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and United States.
