His signature exclamation mark dodge and seven-point (five goals, two assists) championship performance led the 2002 Baltimore Bayhawks to their first title. In 2005, Millon won co-MVP honors in the MLL alongside Gary Gait.\n\nCasey Powell\n\nAttack or midfield, it didn\u2019t matter. Casey Powell filled the box score from either position. Powell won three MLL championships (2001 with the Long Island Lizards, 2008 with the Rochester Rattlers and 2013 with the Chesapeake Bayhawks). In 2014, at 38, Powell earned MVP honors, scoring 30 goals and dishing 33 assists for the Florida Launch.\n\nPowell ranks fourth all time in points (523), ninth all time in goals (262) and third all time in assists (256).\n\nJohn Grant Jr.\n\nWhen John Grant Jr. caught the ball, it was not a matter of if he would score, but how he would score. Behind the back. Around the world. Between the legs. Leaners. Fake high, shoot low. Grant Jr. puzzled goalies throughout his career, burying more goals (393) than anyone in pro lacrosse history.\n\nGrant Jr. won five MLL championships as a player (2008 with the Rochester Rattlers, 2009 with the Toronto Nationals, 2012 and 2013 with the Chesapeake Bayhawks and 2014 with the Denver Outlaws) and another as an assistant coach (2018 with the Outlaws).\n\nMIDFIELD\n\nJay Jalbert\n\nKnown for his endline-to-endline play, Jay Jalbert dominated every inch of the lacrosse field. In overtime of the 2003 MLL championship game, Jalbert sprinted in from his faceoff wing, sparked a fast break and dished the game-winning assist \u2014 capping a career year and an MVP season.\n\nGary Gait\n\nBritish Columbia native Gary Gait led the 2001 Long Island Lizards to the first-ever MLL championship. After being traded to Baltimore the following year, Gait served as player-coach for the Bayhawks for four years, winning two MLL championships (2002, 2005) and earning co-MVP honors alongside Mark Millon in 2005.\n\nGait scored 169 goals and dished 66 assists in his MLL career.\n\nMatt Streibel\n\nOpposing scouting reports highlighted a capital-L and capital-R next to Matt Striebel\u2019s name. His variety of dodges out of the box made him an impossible assignment to defend. Striebel ranks ninth all time in points (382), third among midfielders.\n\nStriebel won three MLL championships with the Philadelphia Barrage (2004, 2006, 2007) and earned championship game MVP honors in 2007 for his six-point (three goals, three assists) performance."}, {"url": "https://worldlacrosse.sport/article/us-lacrosse-announces-national-lacrosse-hall-of-fames-class-of-2019/", "page_content": "SPARKS, Md.

The United States is the reigning world champion and will be the No. 1 seed for the 30-team event which runs June 21 through July 1.\n\nThe roster was selected following a 50-player training camp in Florida, held in conjunction with the IMLCA Winter Summit, earlier this month. It was the fourth training opportunity head coach John Danowski and his staff have had with the players since June.\n\n\u201cThe character of these guys was beyond anything I could have imagined,\u201d said Danowski, who led the U.S. to the world championship in 2018 in Israel. \u201cThe way they tried to do the things we asked them to do, it was incredible. At every event they made it hard for us [to make the final roster decisions]. The meeting we had to make the selections was one of the most stressful things in my coaching career and the face-to-face meeting with the players was incredibly difficult. One of our assistant coaches was still shaking after the meeting. That\u2019s how profound the effect they had on us.\u201d\n\nThe roster selected includes six gold medalists from the 2018 U.S. team \u2014 Trevor Baptiste, Jesse Bernhardt, Michael Ehrhardt, Jack Kelly, Rob Pannell and Tom Schreiber. Bernhardt and Pannell will both be playing on their third U.S. team after also competing in 2014, but the national team experience doesn\u2019t end there.\n\nRyan Conrad, Brennan O\u2019Neill, Jack Rowlett and Michael Sowers all won gold medals with the U.S. U19/U21 program; Liam Byrnes, Conrad, Zach Goodrich, Kelly and Schreiber all represented the U.S. on the Sixes squad earlier this year at The World Games in Birmingham, Ala.; and Baptiste, Matthew Dunn, Connor Kelly, Kieran McArdle, Matt Rambo, Blaze Riorden and Schreiber have all played for the U.S. box team in the World Indoor Lacrosse Championship.\n\nThe entire roster, with the exception of O\u2019Neill, a junior at Duke, played in the Premier Lacrosse League this past summer and 11 of the players are currently playing box in the National Lacrosse League.\n\nThe 23-man roster includes players that played for 15 different college programs, led by Maryland with five players and Denver and Duke with three each.\n\nThe U.S. has won a record 10 world championships since the first international competition in 1967, but will face numerous challengers, including three-time champion Canada. The U.S. is looking to become the first nation to repeat as champion at this event in more than two decades. The U.S. and Canada have alternated championships since the U.S. won its sixth straight world championship in 2002. Canada won in 2006 and 2014 while the U.S. won in 2010 and 2018.\n\nThe U.S. men\u2019s national team trains and plays using best-in-class products from Nike Lacrosse (apparel and footwear), DJO (sports bracing) and game-changing, high-performance equipment from Cascade Maverik and Warrior.\n\nIn addition to these partners, Gatorade, MedStar Health, National Center for Safety Initiatives and Stryker are official sponsors of the U.S. national team program.

As French philosopher, and contributor of the Encyclopedie Denis Diderot, said \"Indeed, the purpose of an encyclopedia is to collect knowledge disseminated around the globe; to set forth its general system to the men with whom we live, and transmit it to those who will come after us, so that the work of preceding centuries will not become useless to the centuries to come; and so that our offspring, becoming better instructed, will at the same time become more virtuous and happy, and that we should not die without having rendered a service to the human race. \"\n\nAccessibility World Heritage Encyclopedia, (WorldHeritage.org) is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways. Unlike printed encyclopedias, we are continually editing, updating, and appending, articles on historic events appearing within minutes, rather than months or years. WorldHeritage.org is fully accessible on a tablet, smartphone, laptop, desktop computer, or any Internet-connected device with a Web browser.\n\nIs Print Obsolete?\n\n\"Thinking beyond the format\", Encyclopedias join a long list of paper we once thought we couldn't live without, like the Sears catalog, Yellow Pages and maps. Even the world famous Encyclopedia Britannica will no longer be printed after 244 years, the final edition costing almost $1400. Today, the modern encyclopedia is often in electronic form and much more affordable then the traditional paper versions. Unlike many online encyclopedias, World Heritage Encyclopedia is an aggregation of professionally written, crowd sourced, peer reviewed, and edited articles, making our information the most reliable and complete encyclopedia. On-line encyclopedias offer the additional advantage of being dynamic; new information can be presented almost immediately as it is happening in the world.

For a lot of kids, and I see this all the time at camps, it just grabs you, and once it does you\u2019re hooked for life.\u201d\n\nLacrosse became Striebel\u2019s passion and profession.

The part that was surprising to me was how quickly I got that call,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cIt was a validating honor. It puts your career in a nice, cohesive narrative.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll be inducted as part of a nine-member class at the The Grand Lodge in Hunt Valley, Maryland, just outside Baltimore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s increasingly starting to set in.

It came from a Philadelphia number he didn\u2019t recognize, so he let it go to voice mail. Rick Lake, the men\u2019s lacrosse director of USA Lacrosse, was on the other end of the call.\n\n\u201cMy immediate assumption was they were calling because the annual giving campaigns had started up,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cAs a veteran of three U.S. teams, they look to me to give donations every once in a while and I assumed that\u2019s what it was.\u201d\n\nInstead, he found out he was being inducted alongside one of his longtime teammates and best friends Ryan Boyle. Boyle was a freshman at Princeton during Striebel\u2019s senior year in 2001. They both played attack, but Boyle took all of the repetitions during fall practices since Striebel also played soccer for the Tigers.\n\nAs a returning All-American and team captain, Striebel tried to coexist with the freshman.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty apparent that Ryan was just better at it than I was, even as a freshman,\u201d said Striebel, who attended The Hotchkiss School before Princeton. \u201cThe coaches brought me into their office and said, \u2018Striebs you had a great run, we\u2019re going to move you to midfield.\u2019 For about 48 hours, I hated Ryan.\u201d\n\nBut he realized that if the team was going to compete for a title, that would give the Tigers the best chance. Princeton won the national championship for the second time in Striebel\u2019s career.\n\nStriebel began his professional career the next season during the inaugural season of Major League Lacrosse. He played for the Bridgeport Barrage, and three years later after the franchise relocated to Philadelphia, they asked Striebel if Boyle was worth a first-round draft pick.\n\n\u201cI said he was and it would make our team better instantly,\u201d Striebel said.\n\nThe Barrage won the MLL title, one of three in Striebel\u2019s 15-year career. He and Boyle also played together for the USA on three World Lacrosse Championship teams.\n\nBoyle started a company called Trinity Lacrosse in 2005 and brought Striebel on as the program\u2019s national director, which is his full-time job. They run camps and events all over the country.\n\n\u201cThe fact that I was able to go in with Ryan, that\u2019s such a poetic bookend to our career and our friendship in the sport,\u201d Striebel said.\n\nStriebel was first called up to the U.S. national team in 2002, less than a year after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The Americans took gold in Perth, Australia.\n\n\u201cTo be able to put on a jersey and represent your country playing a sport you love, there aren\u2019t many honors that are more fulfilling than that,\u201d Striebel said.\n\nHe enjoyed teaming up with other elite players in a competitive setting. Unlike All-star games, which Striebel played in eight times, the world championships provided a goal to achieve rather than an exhibition.\n\nWhen the U.S. lost the 2006 final \u2013 the first time they hadn\u2019t won gold since 1978 \u2013 Striebel and his team left their medals in the dormitories in Ontario.\n\n\u201cIt was a really difficult loss to stomach,\u201d he said.\n\nStriebel and the USA redeemed themselves in 2010 in England with the nation\u2019s ninth gold medal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to win a lot of incredible championships in my career, and those USA championships are definitely up there,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a fortunate career.\u201d\n\nHe recognizes that fortune and works to give others the same opportunity. Striebel coached Northampton High School for seven years before stepping down following the 2018 season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to go all over the country and around the world spreading the gospel of lacrosse and sharing the sport with people who care about it,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cIt has a strong fraternity of followers. It\u2019s been amazing to see that expand to include so many people and so many places.\u201d\n\nTrilogy partners with organizations like Harlem Lacrosse to bring the game to areas and environments that haven\u2019t historically played it.\n\n\u201cFor many years it\u2019s been a predominantly white, wealthy, preppy sport, and that\u2019s not sustainable and that\u2019s not the best version of lacrosse that\u2019s going to exist,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cWhen the sport is available to kids all across the country whether you\u2019re living in an inner city neighborhood or Fairfield County, Connecticut, that\u2019s when the sport is really going to have achieved its peak.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://premierlacrosseleague.com/articles/hall-of-fame-inductee-matt-striebel", "page_content": "A two-sport athlete at Princeton, Matt Striebel played lacrosse like a soccer player. In MLL offseasons, Striebel played three years of professional soccer from 2002-04 for the Western Massachusetts Pioneers of the USL Second Division.\n\n\u201cHis fitness level was just off the charts,\u201d said former Philadelphia Barrage head coach Tony Resch. \u201cHe could keep going and going. He had great speed. He could shoot it. Unselfish. All the things you look for in a midfielder, he had it.\u201d\n\nWhile Resch and most fans may remember Striebel as a lights-out shooter, that wasn\u2019t always the case. Prior to his senior year at Princeton, Striebel was an X attackman. When freshman Ryan Boyle stepped on campus, Striebel was moved above GLE \u2013 where, Boyle jokes, his shot couldn\u2019t break a paper bag.\n\n\u201cHe completely reinvented himself, starting with his senior year at Princeton moving from behind the cage out in front to midfield,\u201d said Boyle, who also played with Striebel on the Philadelphia Barrage. \u201cHis dedication to his craft is truly remarkable. Going from somebody who didn\u2019t really have much range to speak of at all to being somebody who you had to pick up at 16 yards\u2026 he was unguardable.\u201d\n\nThat work ethic led to a 171-game career. Striebel evolved to earn playing time on the \u201804 Barrage midfield unit featuring Blake Miller (46G, 11A), Roy Colsey (25G, 6T, 7A), Mike Mollot (11G, 8A), and Doug Shanahan (12G, 6A).\n\nStriebel stuck the eventual game-winning goal in the \u201804 MLL Championship for that Barrage squad.

He was a two-time All-American at Princeton, splitting time during his career between attack and midfield.

He was also a part of four Ivy League championships, and earned All-Ivy honors three times (1999, 2000, 2001).\n\nStriebel played on three U.S. National Teams, helping to claim world championships in 2002 and 2010, and a runner-up finish in 2006. He also enjoyed a 13-year professional career in Major League Lacrosse, earning all-star honors nine times and All-Pro status in 2007 & 2008.

Unlike All-star games, which Striebel played in eight times, the world championships provided a goal to achieve rather than an exhibition.\n\nWhen the U.S. lost the 2006 final \u2013 the first time they hadn\u2019t won gold since 1978 \u2013 Striebel and his team left their medals in the dormitories in Ontario.\n\n\u201cIt was a really difficult loss to stomach,\u201d he said.\n\nStriebel and the USA redeemed themselves in 2006 in England with the nation\u2019s ninth gold medal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to win a lot of incredible championships in my career, and those USA championships are definitely up there,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a fortunate career.\u201d\n\nHe recognizes that fortune and works to give others the same opportunity. Striebel coached Northampton High School for seven years before stepping down following the 2018 season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to go all over the country and around the world spreading the gospel of lacrosse and sharing the sport with people who care about it,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cIt has a strong fraternity of followers. It\u2019s been amazing to see that expand to include so many people and so many places.\u201d\n\nTrilogy partners with organizations like Harlem Lacrosse to bring the game to areas and environments that haven\u2019t historically played it.\n\n\u201cFor many years it\u2019s been a predominantly white, wealthy, preppy sport, and that\u2019s not sustainable and that\u2019s not the best version of lacrosse that\u2019s going to exist,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cWhen the sport is available to kids all across the country whether you\u2019re living in an inner city neighborhood or Fairfield County, Connecticut, that\u2019s when the sport is really going to have achieved its peak.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.usalaxmagazine.com/usa-insider/senior-men/hall-of-fame-call-a-final-victory-for-the-versatile-matt-striebel", "page_content": "Nine lacrosse legends \u2014 Ryan Boyle, Charlie Coker, Kara Ariza Cooke, Rachael Becker DeCecco, Sarah Forbes, Cathy Reese, Paul Schimoler, Richard Speckmann and Matt Striebel \u2014 will be inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame Oct. 19 at The Grand Lodge in Hunt Valley, Md. These are their stories.\n\nMatt Striebel was out to lunch with his wife and two kids, and then he saw his phone ring. He didn\u2019t recognize the number, so he let it go straight to voicemail, as one does.\n\nThe message, he quickly realized, was from US Lacrosse. It was right around the annual giving time for the men\u2019s national team, Striebel said, so he called back to let them know his check was ready to be sent out.\n\nBut on the other line was Rick Lake, men's game senior manager at US Lacrosse. His message was a tad different.\n\n\u201cHe goes, \u2018Matt, we're actually calling you to let you know made the Hall of Fame,\u2019\u201d the Gill, Mass., native recalled. \u201cIt was an amazing moment that was made doubly better that I found out I was going in with Ryan (Boyle). As soon as I hung up that phone call, I called Ryan and was like, \u2018This is crazy. Can you believe it?\u2019 It was the perfect, poetic bookend to a journey of our playing careers.\u201d\n\n\"We tried to coexist for two games, then I went into the coach's office and they basically looked at me and said \u2018Striebs, it's been a great run. How about you try midfield?\" \u2014 Matt Striebel describing a meeting Bill Tierney his senior year.\n\nStriebel is one of nine set for the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame\u2019s Class of 2019, entering with his close friend, Boyle \u2014 a fellow champion at Princeton, with the U.S. national team and in Major League Lacrosse. They now work together at Trilogy Lacrosse, the company Boyle co-founded, though their roots extend back to 2001 at Princeton.\n\nThe Tigers, then coached by fellow Hall of Fame member Bill Tierney, had Boyle entering as a blue-chip recruit down on attack. Striebel, a captain and returning All-American on attack, was excited by playing with a player of his quality. Plans went another direction, though.\n\n\u201cWe tried to coexist for two games, then I went into the coach's office and they basically looked at me and said \u2018Striebs, it's been a great run. How about you try midfield?,\u2019\u201d said Striebel, who gave himself 24 hours to sulk before embracing his new role.\n\n\u201cI decided it's my senior year, I really want to win and am here to win a national championship. From a lacrosse standpoint, it's the best thing that could have happened to me, because I am more of a midfielder talent-wise and it made us a better team and opened opportunities on the U.S. team and as a professional.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not hyperbole from Striebel, either. That 2001 season marked Striebel\u2019s second national championship while at Princeton, as well as a fourth straight Ivy League championship. On the national stage, he captured gold at the World Lacrosse championships in 2002 (Perth) and 2010 (Manchester), plus silver in 2006 (Ontario).\n\nStriebel also secured three MLL championships (2004, \u201806, \u201807) with the Philadelphia Barrage, earning earning MLL All-Star honors on nine occasions. Boyle was right there at nearly every step.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m far happier for him than I am for myself,\u201d Boyle said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI often say there are some guys out there who are A-plus in a couple categories. Oh, he's an A-plus shooter or an A-plus dodger,\u201d Striebel began. \u201cFor me, I think I just had the versatility to be B-plus, A-minus guy in a lot of different categories. That allowed me to change and adapt my game as I got older.\n\n\u201cThe first 10 years I was in the MLL, I think I took one two-point shot and it was on an open goal when we needed goal differential for the playoffs. Then as I got older, like a basketball player who's adding a different aspect, I became more of a shooter so I could develop other parts of my game and maintain relevance as a player.\u201d\n\nBut like most great players, Striebel\u2019s connection with the game didn\u2019t cease once he put away the pads and cleats. He\u2019s spent the last seven years coaching at Northampton High School in Massachusetts, plus working for Trilogy. He\u2019s especially close with coaches in the Colonial Athletic Association, so he\u2019ll often swing by nearby UMass-Amherst to catch games and chat with old friends.\n\nThose experiences also remind Striebel of his time at Hotchkiss, in Lakeville, Conn., during the mid-1990s. He said that was the \u201cdawn of the post-graduate lacrosse era\u201d at New England prep schools, where he played alongside several NHL draft picks.\n\n\u201cYou had kids who played multiple sports at a very high level,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cThere were great athletes and for better or for worse, lacrosse has become a 365-day endeavor where kids have an opportunity to play every day.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.statscrew.com/lacrosse/stats/p-striemat001", "page_content": "Matt Striebel\n\nMatt Striebel\n\nBorn: January 12, 1979\n\nIowa City, IA\n\nPosition: M\n\nHeight: 6'1\"\n\nWeight: 190\n\nCareer: 2001-2015\n\n\n\nMatt Striebel scored 225 goals and recorded 117 assists in his 167-game career with the Bridgeport Barrage, Philadelphia Wings, Philadelphia Barrage, Barrage, Chicago Machine, Rochester Rattlers , New York Lizards, Boston Cannons and Chesapeake BayHawks.

His collegiate career, as part of arguably the nation\u2019s best team in the late 1990s and early 2000s under coach Bill Tierney, ended with a victory over Syracuse in the 2001 title game.
