USA are in the middle of the Vietnam War, Martin Luther King has recently marched from Selma to Montgomery and Roger Miller\u2019s \u2018King of the Road\u2019 is number one. Thirteen bikers meet on the corner of Eighth and Davidson in San Bernardino, California to form the Vagos Motorcycle Club, beginning a history that would involve drug trafficking, clashes with the police and a violent rivalry with the Hells Angels.\n\nThe elected president was Rudy Esparza, nicknamed Puro, who led the new club in selecting their name. Other names considered included Coffin Dogers MC and Satan\u2019s Saints MC, but Vagos MC, Spanish for vagabond, was chosen. Their new patch, a red devil on a green background, was inspired by an image of a devil in LIFE magazine entitled \u2018Return from hell.\u2019\n\nMore Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs (OMGs) were established in the 1960s than in any other decade. The outlaw status is given to groups who are not sanctioned by the American Motorcyclists Association (AMA). They are also known as 1%ers, a term which originated after the Hollister biker riot in 1947 when the AMA allegedly claimed the 99% of bikers were law abiding citizens, although the AMA have no record of issuing this as an official or public statement.\n\nBikers would often move between clubs or find their club being absorbed into a larger club. Puro had previously been with the Psychos MC and others joined from clubs including El Diablo MC. The question of whether the Vagos would absorb or be absorbed was very quickly answered as more Chapters sprang up across California. In 2014 the FBI listed the Vagos as one of the largest Outlaw Motorcycle Groups in Western America with 600 members in 24 Chapters throughout America, as well as Chapters in Canada, Mexico and Europe.\n\nThe Mafia on wheels?\n\nDescribed by Vagos infiltrator Charles Falco as \u201cthe mafia on wheels\u201d the Vagos have more than earned their 1%er patch. Drug related arrests have been made throughout their colourful history. In 1987 the head of the South Bay Chapter and President of the Desert Hot Springs Chapter along with three others all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute methamphetamines. Over 40 pounds of cocaine and eight pounds of methamphetamines (and a rocket launcher!) were seized in a 2011 raid. And in 2014 four Vagos members were arrested by the FBI for selling methamphetamines.\n\nAlongside money laundering and weapons trafficking, the Vagos are also known for their general violence, especially with rival OMGs. As the Vagos attempted to expand their territory tension erupted between them and other OMGs most notably the Hells Angels. In 2001 a bloody melee broke out between the Vagos and the Angels in the Californian city of Costa Mesa. And in 2010 an argument over which gang got to hang out in the Starbucks in Santa Cruz escalated. A brawl outside the coffee shop led to a gunfight in Chino Valley, several drive by shootings and a bitter feud.\n\nThe authorities have successfully infiltrated the Vagos a number of times. George Rowe, a street criminal whose friend had disappeared after an incident with the Vagos, volunteered to go undercover as part of Operation 22 in 2003. His evidence gathered over 3 years resulted in 42 arrests and convictions for crimes as serious as murder. Whilst Charles Falco worked his way up to number two of the Victorville Chapter and provided the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) gathering enough information to make 62 arrests for crimes including assault and murder. Fun fact, both Rowe and Falco have written books about their experiences and actually appear as characters in each other\u2019s books.\n\nHowever the Vagos have their own weapon in their ongoing battle with the police- the lawsuit. In 1990 the Vagos sued the police and received a $2 million settlement claiming they were targets of massive police abuse in the early eighties. And in 2010 when the Vagos were blamed for a spree of homemade booby traps that targeted the police, they once again sued and received a settlement that included a public statement and the return of property seized the previous year.\n\n1%ers\n\nAs with all criminal groups the Vagos don\u2019t advertise their more notorious crimes. Their PR website vagosmcworld.com, presents them as a club rather than a gang. Their consistent response to arrests is that it is not all of their members committing crimes, but a few bad apples. So, organised crime syndicate or a club where just 1% of the 1%ers are giving them a bad name\u2026?"}, {"url": "https://www.liquisearch.com/vagos_motorcycle_club/history", "page_content": "\u201cPsychology keeps trying to vindicate human nature.

The motorcycle club are also known as the Green Nation and have a strong presence in the USA and Mexico, but have also expanded to many other countries.\n\nVagos MC History\n\nVagos MC was founded in San Bernardino, California in 1965. Like many other motorcycle clubs of the time, the Vagos Motorcycle Club was founded by a group of members who had returned from World War II and enjoyed riding their Harley Davidson motorcycles. This particular group were originally members of a different motorcycle club, the Psychos (Redlands) Motorcycle Club. After some infighting a few of the members decided to leave and form their own club, which then became the Vagos Motorcycle Club.\n\nThe original members were Rudy \u201cPuro\u201d Esparza (President), Gil Carrasco (Vice President), Whitey (Secretary/Treasurer), Lucky (Sgt. at Arms), Freddy Ruiz, Harley Hog, Animal, Crazy John Estrada, Tom Tom, Moose, Squirrel, Alex Estrada, and Little John Bocanegra.\n\nThe founders of Vagos Motorcycle Club had a Mexican heritage, which led to the color green being selected for the club. The word \u201cVagos\u201d in Spanish means \u201cvagabond\u201d, \u201cgypsy\u201d or \u201ctravelling person\u201d, someone who is always up to something. Two other names for the club were considered, Coffin Dodgers MC and Satan Saints MC.\n\nThe first chapter to open was in San Bernardino, California, which is nicknamed the \u201cBerdoo\u201d chapter. San Bernardino was a hot spot for founding motorcycle clubs, also founded in the area were the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club.\n\nThe second chapter was the Vagos Motorcycle Club Victorville chapter, which involved patching over of Cossacks Motorcycle Club.\n\nThe third chapter was the Vagos Motorcycle Club Los Angeles chapter, made up of members from the Talons Motorcycle Club.\n\nThe fourth chapter was the Vagos Motorcycle Club San Gorgonio Pass chapter, started by some of the Berdoo chapter members and their friends.\n\nThe fifth chapter was the Vagos Motorcycle Club SGV (San Gabriel Valley) chapter.

He is depicted riding a motorcycle. The Vagos Motorcycle Club patch was designed by a member of the Berdoo chapter who was in prison at the time.\n\nThe Vagos MC motto is \u201cWe Give What We Get\u201d.\n\nOne of the Vagos Motorcycle Club abbreviations is 22, as the 22nd letter in the alphabet is the letter \u201cV\u201d.\n\nThe Vagos Motorcycle Club colors are green, which links back to the Mexican heritage of the Vagos Motorcycle Club founder.\n\nVagos also use the motto \u201cVFFV\u201d, meaning \u201cVagos Forever, Forever Vagos\u201d. This format is used by many clubs, for example the Bandidos \u201cBFFB\u201d.\n\nVagos MC Chapters\n\nVagos are spread throughout the world, with a strong presence both in Southern California and Mexico.\n\nVagos Motorcycle Club United States Chapters Vagos Berdoo San Bernardino, California chapter Vagos Victorville chapter Vagos Los Angeles chapter Vagos San Gorgonio Pass chapter Vagos Hollywod chapter Vagos Sacramento chapter Vagos San Jose chapter Vagos Compton chapter Vagos Pasadena chapter Vagos SGV (San Gabriel Valley) chapter Vagos Monterrey chapter Vagos Pomona Valley chapter Vagos Antelope Valley chapter Vagos Venice chapter Vagos Central Valley, Stockton, California chapter Vagos New York chapter Vagos Nomads chapter Vagos Arizona chapter Vagos New Mexico chapter Vagos Illinois chapter Vagos Utah chapter Vagos Florida chapter Vagos Arkansas chapter Vagos Mojave chapter\n\n\n\nVagos Motorcycle Club Mexico Chapters Vagos Ocotlan chapter Vagos Hormiga Tlalpan chapter Vagos Coronel chapter Vagos Malpaatla chapter Vagos Tonito chapter Vagos Morelia chapter Vagos Centro chapter Vagos Guanajuato chapter Vagos Toluca chapter Vagos Zamora chapter Vagos Alvaro Obregon chapter Vagos Coyocan chapter Vagos Tlaquepaque chapter Vagos Zapopan chapter Vagos Guadalajara chapter\n\n\n\nVagos Motorcycle Club Australia\n\nVagos Motorcycle Club Canada\n\nVagos Motorcycle Club Brazil\n\nVagos Motorcycle Club Europe Chapters Vagos Scandinavia chapter Vagos Nomads Europe chapter Vagos United Kingdom chapter Vagos Germany chapter Vagos Switzerland chapter\n\n\n\nFamous Vagos MC Members\n\nRudy \u201cPuro\u201d Esparza \u2013 Founder/President\n\nBorn November 16, 1935 and died August 14, 2013 in Joshua Tree, California.

For years many have passed stories around, this is the real story of how the Vagos Motorcycle Club was originated from one of the last of the first 13 original members and founders. This is his story of the birth of our club. It is important to pass this history of our club to all our brothers in order to keep its history alive.\n\nOn May 18th on the corner of Eighth and Davidson in San Bernardino, California a motorcycle club, not gang, was originated.\n\nThe members were:\n\nPuro \u2013 President\n\nGil Carrasco \u2013 Vice President\n\nWhitey \u2013 Secretary\n\nTreasurer Lucky \u2013 Sgt. at Arms\n\nFreddy Ruiz, Harley Hog, Crazy John Estrada, Tom Tom, Moose, Squirrel, Alex Estrada, and Little John Bocanegra.\n\nOriginally two other names were considered, Coffin Dodgers MC and Satan Saints MC the name VAGOS MC was suggested by Puro and was voted on. Then the emblem had to be chosen. Lucky was browsing through LIFE magazine and found a picture of a devil coming out of the ground surrounded by smoke, the caption read \u201creturn from hell.\u201d Animal and Lucky presented the picture to the other members for a vote, the vote passed. The colors were chosen by Whitey and Puro. The color chosen was green on green with the devil in red. After the vote, Moose was chosen to draw the center piece. The patches made for the first original 13 were made from felt by a seamstress from Muscoy named Betty. She made all the patches for the few clubs that were around at the time. She made ours till the early 90s when her sight went bad. The patches after the original 13 were made from canvas.\n\nSoon after we got started, a lot of men started to come in; the first was J.R. Garcia. That was three months after we originated. Three months after that we moved to 11th and \u201cL\u201d streets in Berdoo, the Mother chapter.\n\nSoon other clubs wanted to become Vagos! A brief history:\n\nThe second Vago chapter started was Victorville, the members were from the Cossacks MC.\n\nThe third Vago chapter was Los Angeles, whose members were from the Talons MC.\n\nThe forth Vago chapter was San Gorgonio Pass, made up of a few Vagos from Berdoo and a bunch of men who they knew, who rode hard and partied harder.\n\nThe fifth Vago chapter was S.G.V., these members were from the Dirty Dozen MC, a few Highwaymen MC, Verdugos MC, Vendettas MC and Ghostmen MC.\n\nThe sixth Vago chapter was Monterrey, they were from the Sabers MC, and some Dirty Dozen MC and Highwaymen MC.\n\nThe seventh Vago chapter was Pomona Valley, made up with men from the Nacoda Breed MC.\n\nThe eighth Vago chapter was Antelope Valley, it\u2019s members were from the Brothers MC,\n\nThe Mexico chapters were started by accident, 15 years later. Lucky was in Ensenada on the 4th of July playing in a softball tournament. His wife Irene, stopped the game to show Lucky three guys on bikes going down the street. The name on their cuts was the same as ours, except the colors were different. They were black and gray with orange-yellow, with an eagle center. Lucky found out later where they were partying, so he went over and talked and partied with them. The president\u2019s name was Tati and they were from Mexicali. With them partying was another club, the Solo Angels MC. When he came back home he got a hold of Prophet who was the national President at the time, he also went to the Berdoo chapter to talk to Lenco, Loco and Crazy Johnny.

This is a question that has been asked by many people over the years. There is no simple answer to this question, as there is no one answer that fits all Vagos. Some members of the gang may be white, while others may be of a different race or ethnicity.\n\nThe Vagos gang was formed in the 1960s in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles. It is believed that the gang was originally formed by a group of Mexican-American teenagers who were looking for a way to express their dissatisfaction with society. The Vagos soon began to engage in a variety of criminal activities, including drug trafficking, robbery, and murder.\n\nThe gang has since grown in size and spread to other parts of the United States. Today, the Vagos are believed to have a membership of around 10,000 people. The gang is particularly active in the states of California, Nevada, and Oregon.\n\nThe Vagos gang is not a monolithic organization. It is made up of a variety of different members with different backgrounds and beliefs. Some members of the gang may be white, while others may be of a different race or ethnicity.\n\nWhether or not the Vagos are a white gang is a matter of debate. There is no definitive answer to this question. Some people may consider the Vagos to be a white gang because the majority of its members are white, while others may not consider the gang to be white because it includes members of other races and ethnicities.\n\nUltimately, the answer to this question depends on your definition of a white gang. If you consider a white gang to be a gang whose members are all white, then the Vagos are not a white gang. However, if you consider a white gang to be a gang whose members are predominantly white, then the Vagos may be considered a white gang.\n\nWho are the enemies of the Vagos?\n\nThe Vagos are a motorcycle gang that has been around for over 50 years.

Two hundred members are in Inland Empire (California), where the club was started in the late 1960s.\n\nThe Vagos Motorcycle Club , also known as the Green Nation , is a one percenter motorcycle club and alleged organized crime syndicate formed in 1965 in the unincorporated community of San Bernardino, California. The club's insignia is Loki, the Norse god of mischief, riding a motorcycle. Members typically wear green.\n\nHistory\n\nDuring World War II, many military service men rode motorcycles and grew attached to them, and could not leave them after the war. The motorcycle enthusiasts formed clubs around the time hot rods were in style. In 1948, the Hells Angels formed a motorcycle club; their first chapter was in San Bernardino (Berdoo), California. They shared the streets with another motorcycle club named the Psychos (Redlands). In 1965, a feud occurred among a few of the Psychos members; they left the group and created their own club, which is now known as Vagos MC. Their colors pay homage to their founders' Mexican heritage. The club expanded to the Riverside, California and the California high desert areas, and later to Mexico and Europe.\n\nInsignia\n\nA member from the Berdoo chapter (slang for San Bernardino) created a patch while he was in prison featuring Loki, the Norse god of mischief. Vago is Spanish for vagabond or wanderer. Their denim jackets sport their top rockers with their club name integrated into the middle patch, and bottom rockers with their chapter's region or state, such as \"SO. CAL\", \"California\", or \"Arizona\". The middle patch \"depicts a muscle-bound caricature of the Norse god of mischief, Loki, set against a green field\". Loki is colored red on top of a bike with his hands holding up their club name. Other patches the club wears are the number 22 (the 22nd letter of the alphabet, V, for Vagos), and a Loki head. An MF patch (meaning motorcycle family), is received by a member after a probationary period is over and the member is validated as a member of the Vagos family on the front. Some members have been seen with a green swastika and an \"SS\" symbol on their jackets.\n\nMembership\n\nVagos Membership primarily consists of Caucasian and Hispanic males.\n\nOfficial chapters\n\nThe Vagos have Chapters all throughout Southern California. They have Chapters in the High Desert (California),Inland Empire (California) which includes both Riverside County, California and San Bernardino County, California in the city of San Bernadino where they started, Azusa california San Gabriel Valley chapter ,Los Angeles and San Diego.

Europe, Canada and Australia.\n\nHemet traps\n\nOn March 17, 2010, amid allegations that Vagos members had fabricated home-made booby traps to maim and kill police detectives in Hemet, California, police arrested at least 30 Vagos members in a multi-state raid of Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and California, involving 400 police officers from 60 law enforcement agencies. The police raided 73 locations in Southern California, seizing weapons and drugs, and discovered a meth lab. The raids were the result of several incidents involving booby traps where the club was implicated:\n\nOn December 31, 2009, the unmarked headquarters of the Hemet Gang Task Force was filled with natural gas, which had been routed into the building through a hole drilled in the roof. Two task force members had detected the gas and backed away without triggering the explosion. The day before that attack, a Vagos funeral was held at a church next to the office.\n\nOn February 23, 2010, a task force member opened a security gate outside the building, causing a homemade zip gun attached to the gate to fire, nearly hitting his head.\n\nOn March 5, a task force member who had parked an unmarked police car in front of a convenience store in Hemet found a homemade pipe bomb hidden underneath the vehicle.\n\nCalifornia and federal authorities announced a $200,000 reward for information on these cases. California Attorney General Jerry Brown called the attempts \"urban terrorism.\" Riverside County District Attorney Rod Pacheco said that Vagos members posed an \"extreme threat\" to law enforcement officers and were notorious for trying to \"infiltrate\" public safety agencies, by obtaining sworn or non-sworn positions and working undercover to obstruct and dismantle police investigations.\n\nIn March 2011, the club sued Riverside County law enforcement for defamation and damages caused by implicating the group to the attacks on the Hemet police officers. On August 1, Riverside County settled the lawsuit, and cleared the club of any involvement with the attacks on the officers. Meanwhile, they had arrested two men that had no ties to the club. The club's attorney, Joseph Yanny, stated he was pleased with the result: \"This was never about money. What was important was that the club clear its name and take this shadow off them.\"\n\nNugget Casino shooting\n\nOn September 23, 2011, Vagos members were involved in a shooting at John Ascuaga's Nugget in Sparks, Nevada, where Jeffrey Pettigrew, the president of the San Jose, California chapter of Hells Angels was killed, and Vagos members were wounded. The next day, a Vagos member was wounded at a rally by a drive-by shooter. On September 29, police arrested Ernesto Manuel Gonzales, a Vagos member, at the University of California, San Francisco, for killing Pettigrew. On December 7, police announced that they had arrested Gary Rudnick, the vice-president of the Los Angeles chapter of Vagos, for instigating the fight that led to the shooting. Rudnick later pleaded guilty to second degree murder in a bargaining agreement. The trial for the two Vagos members, as well as a Hells Angels member who fired at a crowd, was held on October 29, 2012.\n\nOther incidents\n\nIn 1974, four Vagos members were convicted and sentenced to death for murdering University of New Mexico student William Velten. The four, Richard Greer, Ronald Keine, Clarence Smith and Thomas Gladish, spent 17 months on death row, but during the appeals process, Kerry Rodney Lee confessed to the murder.\n\nIn October 1998, police arrested more than a dozen Vagos members for kidnapping, drug and weapons crimes, following a two-year undercover investigation. In September 2004, state police arrested 26 members and seized more than $125,000 in cash, drugs and guns. On March 9, 2006, law enforcement conducted \"Operation 22 Green\", which involved 700 personnel from Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and local police and sheriff's departments. The operation resulted in the arrest of 25 Vagos members and associates for violating firearms and drugs policies. It was \"one of the largest coordinated law enforcement probes ever conducted in Southern California\". The investigators seized 95 illegal firearms, illegal drugs, $6,000 cash, and two stolen motorcycles. An ATF agent called the group a \"ruthless criminal bike gang\" that deals in \"guns, drugs, and death.\" Operation 22 Green and its lead-up were used as the basis for the first season of the television series Gangland Undercover.\n\nIn December 2007, police arrested six Vagos members for \"charges of first-degree burglary, second-degree robbery, coercion and second-degree kidnapping\" that occurred in August 2007. The victim had announced he was leaving the club, but suffered a beating at the Custom Motorcycle auto shop in Grants Pass, Oregon, and was then taken to his home where they attempted to rob him they failed. In February 2010, the ex-president of the chapter involved was acquitted of all charges relating to robbery assault and kidnapping.\n\nThree Vagos members were arrested on June 9 and 10, 2009, and charged with sexually assaulting a woman in San Jose, California. Police investigators told the San Jose Mercury News that the victim met the three men in a nightclub on May 4, 2009, and that they had offered to drive her home, but instead they took her to the Vagos clubhouse on Kings Row where she was beaten and sexually assaulted.\n\nOn August 13, 2011 law enforcement authorities reported that the Vagos Motorcycle Club and the Galloping Goose Motorcycle Club were involved in a shootout which shut down traffic on I-44 near Waynesville, Missouri. The local 9-1-1 center received about 20 calls, which reported that approximately 20 men were fighting, and that shots had been fired."}]}
