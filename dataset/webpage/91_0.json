{"Kia Joorabchian (born 1972) is an Iranian-born British-based businessman, investor, and philanthropist.": [{"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/kia-joorabchian/", "page_content": "Kiavash \"Kia\" Joorabchian (Persian: \u06a9\u06cc\u0627\u0648\u0634 \u062c\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0686\u064a\u0627\u0646\u200e\u200e) is an Iranian-born British-educated businessman largely involved in association football.\n\nIn the register of directorships at Companies House in London, Joorabchian gives two nationalities, Canadian and British, born on 14 July 1971.\n\nAlthough routinely described in the press as a football agent, Joorabchian is not a licensed agent. The involvement of unlicensed agents in transfers in the English Premier League is prohibited by the Football Association. Joorabchian does not himself claim to be an agent, saying \"I think the agency business is very different\". He describes his business as advising players on their rights and clubs on transfers and contracts.\n\nJoorabchian is also involved in the 'third-party' ownership of players, describing himself as an investment manager. In October 2008, he said, \"I manage the investment group and obviously when the investment group is profitable, as fund manager, you also get a cut\". In 2009 it was reported that the unnamed investors represented by Joorabchian were understood to own the economic rights to 60 or 70 players across Europe and South America.\n\nHe has supported Arsenal Football Club since his childhood and later kept a corporate box at their Emirates Stadium. Due to his association with Arsenal he has forged a close relationship with David Dein and his son Darren.\n\nJoorabchian was educated at Shiplake College in Oxfordshire and then at a school in Golders Green, north London. He went on to study chemistry and business studies at Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London, dropping out after his second year.\n\nKia Joorabchian was born in Tehran, Iran, the son of Iranian car-dealer businessman, Mohammed Joorabchian. According to Joorabchian his father's uncle had once run the biggest car manufacturer in the Middle East. The Joorabchian family emigrated from Iran following the fall of the Shah in 1979. They went to the United Kingdom and then Canada, returning to England when Joorabchian was 12. His father ran car dealerships, including Medway Autos in Kent.\n\nAlthough Joorabchian suffered in the stock market crash of 2001, his sale of American Capital after that volatility brought him, on his own estimate, between \u00a350 million and \u00a360 million.\n\nA year later, in 1999, American Capital bought 85% of the Russian newspaper Kommersant. After a month Kommersant\u2019s ownership passed to the oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who was widely suspected to have been behind American Capital\u2019s bid for the paper -something denied by Joorabchian who was said to have given assurances that he was not working on anyone else\u2019s behalf. Raf Shakirov, who was replaced as editor after Berezovsky\u2019s acquisition of Kommersant, told the British newspaper The Mail on Sunday in 2005 \u201cJoorabchian was and is very much Berezovsky\u2019s man\u201d.\n\nJoorabchian worked first for his father and then as a trader at the International Petroleum Exchange in London. He became involved in the stock market and fund management, moving to New York City and establishing, with his associate, Reza Irani-Kermanian, an investment company, American Capital, based in Manhattan but registered in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nInvolvement in football\n\nMedia Sports Investments and Corinthians\n\nIn 2004, Joorabchian founded Media Sports Investments to make a partnership with Brazilian football club Corinthians. He had briefly considered becoming involved at Arsenal, but found it too expensive and had instead been pointed towards Brazilian football by Pele's agent and the recommendation of Pini Zahavi, the so-called 'super agent', whom Joorabchian described in 2006 as a friend of long standing.\n\nThe partnership with Corinthians's was a 10-year deal stipulating that MSI would provide $35 million \u2013$20 million of which would cover debts\u2013 in return for 51% of future profits. Joorabchian moved to Brazil and changed the way Corinthians was run, increasing revenue by 500% in the first year.\n\nA series of major signings followed MSI's investment, including, most spectacularly, Carlos Tevez, who was signed from Boca Juniors for $22 million, an unprecedented amount for a transfer by a South American club. These were players who were engaged to play for Corinthians but whose economic rights were partly or wholly owned by MSI. By 2006 the company was listing as its investments not just Corinthians, but also the players Carlos Tevez, Marcelo Mattos, Gustavo Nery, Roger, Javier Mascherano, Carlos Alberto, Sebasti\u00e1n Dom\u00ednguez and Marinho. In 2005 Corinthians won its fourth Brazilian title.\n\nThe Tevez transfer was brokered by the Argentinian football agent Fernando Hidalgo, who was a partner in the company HAZ Sports with Pini Zahavi. Zahavi, responsible for numerous football deals, including the acquisition of Chelsea Football Club by Roman Abramovich, acted as a broker for MSI.\n\nThe source of the money behind MSI was a subject of considerable speculation. The Spanish sports newspaper Diario AS suggested that a 15% share was owned by Abramovich, while Joorabchian\u2019s name continued to be linked to that of Berezovsky. In 2005 the Georgian businessman and owner of Dinamo Tbilisi, Badri Patarkatsishvili, a close associate of Berezovsky, told a journalist that they had indeed invested in Corinthians. Joorabchian himself was described by Brazilian authorities as \"trying, at all costs, to hide knowledge of the people and businesses involved in the transactions\".\n\nIn 2007, following allegations that Corinthians had been used to launder money, a Brazilian judge, Faustus Martins de Sanctis, ordered the arrest of Berezovsky, Joorabchian, Nojan Bedroud, cofounder of MSI, and four officials of club, including the chairman, Alberto Dualib. MSI responded by saying that the judge\u2019s actions were \"absurd, arbitrary and lacking legal backing\", while Joorabchian denied any wrongdoing and maintained that all payments made to Corinthians were \"cleared through and approved by the Brazilian Central Bank\".\n\nThe Brazilian court papers setting out the evidence on which the warrants of arrest were issued stated: \u201cMSI belongs and has always belonged to the accused, Boris Berezovsky\u201d. Berezovsky denied any business connection with Joorabchian or MSI.\n\nIn the light of these developments Corinthians broke off their association with MSI in July 2007. There had already been a public deterioration in relations between the directors of the club and its investors centering on the involvement of MSI and Joorabchian in the team's affairs, and the fact that the club had been left owning only five members of the playing squad. Tevez and Mascherano had been transferred to West Ham United and there had been seven different managers in 18 months. In December 2007 Corinthians were relegated from Brazil's first division.\n\nThe warrant for Joorabchian's arrest was suspended by the Brazilian authorities in August 2008.\n\nIn April 2014, The judge totally absolved the whole case saying there was never anything done wrong by anyone in the case at all. \"In this case, there is no proof of a single offense, nor is it pointed out that the alleged group ever have had any intention or interest in the committing any crimes,\" added the judge.\n\nTevez, Mascherano and West Ham United\n\nJoorabchian stepped down as president of Media Sports Investments in June 2006. It was reported at the time that Joorabchian retained an investment in Tevez and Mascherano, whose economic rights were described as being owned by MSI. A subsequent Premier League investigation revealed that in February 2006 rights in Tevez had been transferred to MSI (company id: 05218027) and a second company, Just Sports Inc., while Mascherano was jointly owned by Global Soccer Agencies and Mystere Services Ltd. All four companies were represented by Joorabchian.\n\nIn August 2006 the two players joined West Ham in the English Premier League. Pini Zahavi assisted in the transfers, revealing to the press that he stood to make money if the players were a success in England. Zahavi had an association over a number of years with Global Soccer Agencies, owners of a half share in Mascherano.\n\nZahavi also suggested that he had the idea for Joorabchian's proposed takeover of West Ham itself, \"Was it my idea? Yes it was,\" Zahavi said. Joorabchian had investigated the possibility of a takeover of the club the autumn before Tevez and Mascherano moved to West Ham, promising to make \u00a3100 million available for new players in a \u00a3200 million deal valuing the club and its debts at \u00a375 million. The takeover floundered when it proved impossible to agree a valuation for the club but the possibility was revived following the Tevez/Mascherano transfer. Patarkatsishvili announced that he was considering becoming involved in the bid. In the end no offer resulted and the club was sold to a consortium headed by Eggert Magnusson.\n\nAlthough the capture of Tevez and Mascherano was reported as a major coup for West Ham, the third-party ownership of the players proved highly controversial. At that time the practice was permitted as long as the investing party exercised no influence over the club's playing or transfer policy. It has been reported that Joorabchian in fact retained the power to transfer either player at any time during their contracts.\n\nIn April 2007 West Ham was fined a record \u00a35.5 million by the Premier League for entering into third-party contracts whose existence they did not reveal in the knowledge that, in the words of the Premier League's findings, \"the FAPL at the very least may not - and in all probability would not - have approved of such contracts\". When Tevez was instrumental in West Ham's avoiding relegation at the end of the 2006-7 season the position was legally challenged by the relegated club, Sheffield United, on the ground that Tevez should have been ineligible to play. The claim was eventually settled out of court in March 2009 with West Ham paying Sheffield United \u00a320 million over five years.\n\nSpeculation has subsequently linked Joorabchian with the takeover of the football clubs Fulham, in early 2007, and Southampton, in January 2008.\n\nTransfer of Tevez to Manchester United and then to Manchester City\n\nIn August 2007 Carlos Tevez moved from West Ham United to Manchester United. The deal was subject to a protracted dispute with West Ham claiming that the player was registered to them and contracted until June 2010. The Premier League insisted that negotiations should be \"done directly\" with the club who should receive the fee for any transfer. Joorabchian maintained that MSI and Just Sports Inc retained the economic rights to the player and that the deal had been negotiated with the \"knowledge and permission\" of West Ham. In a statement issued on behalf of MSI Joorabchian said that West Ham had \"consistently provided private assurances while at the same time making contrary statements to the public at large\".\n\nAsked for a ruling by the Football Association and the Premier League, FIFA judged that the matter should be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. MSI and Just Sports Inc then issued a writ in order to \"compel West Ham to release the registration of Carlos Tevez in accordance with contracts entered into between the parties\".\n\nThe threat of action in the High Court was avoided by a settlement that saw West Ham receive a fee of \u00a32 million for T\u00e9vez's registration. Joorabchian later claimed that West Ham agreed to return the money with additional legal costs bringing the total to \u00a32.6 million, apparently contradicting the club\u2019s claim to the Premier League that they would be the beneficiary of the fee.\n\nThe terms of the transfer saw Manchester United agree a two-year deal in which Tevez's registration was leased by the club while his economic rights were retained by his third-party owners. Manchester United paid \u00a33-4 million a year for Tevez's commercial and football rights for the duration of the lease and secured the first option on a permanent transfer.\n\nIn September 2009 Tevez signed for Manchester City in a deal removing him from third-party ownership sometimes reported as being worth \u00a347 million to the companies owning his economic rights, although that amount was disputed by Joorabchian who called the story \"inaccurate and misleading\".\n\nLegal dispute with West Ham United\n\nIn 2008, Joorabchian became engaged in a legal dispute with West Ham United over what he said were unmet payments by the club of \u00a34.5 million and \u00a32.6 million relating to Tevez. Joorabchian claimed that he brokered a resolution between West Ham and the two companies, MSI and Just Sports Inc, who owned the player's economic rights and who initially refused to cancel that third-party arrangement as requested by the Premier League as part of their findings of April 2007. Potentially Tevez would not have played in the final two games of the 2006-7 season.\n\nJoorabchian stated that the payments were to cover costs, the player\u2019s salary, expenses and a loan fee, as well as \u00a32 million he claimed to have paid to West Ham for Tevez's registration as part of the deal that saw the player transferred to Manchester United in August 2007. Joorabchian's allegation that Tevez received a salary and expenses other than that paid to him by West Ham, would \u2013were those payments to have been met by a third party\u2013 have breached the Premier League's regulations. West Ham United claimed they were unaware of such payments.\n\nThe eventual out-of-court settlement of these proceedings saw Joorabchian engaged as a consultant by West Ham with fees of more than \u00a32 million. In this capacity Joorabchian was critical of transfer dealings made by Eggert Magnusson and the club's former manager, Alan Curbishley, who resigned saying that transfer policy had been taken out of his hands.\n\nDefence of 'Third-Party' ownership\n\nTevez's ownership and the role of Joorabchian in English football remained highly controversial throughout the period up to the player's transfer to Manchester City in September 2009. Joorabchian's continued opacity on the question of the identity of those behind the companies he represented was a point of particular discussion.\n\nThe heavily criticised involvement of third parties in the ownership of players was banned by the Premier League for the start of the 2008-9 season. One high-ranking official had called it, \"an unedifying trade in young people that rips the heart out of clubs which try to develop players\". Joorabchian himself offered a defence of the arrangement, calling it \"the South American model and a model that appears all over Europe\". In his view third-party transfers are \"a way of bringing outstanding players to clubs that would not be able to afford them ordinarily. So they increase the competition\", further explaining: \"What happens, in Brazil particularly, clubs cannot afford to buy a player. So they go to a business, a bank, a major supermarket, an individual, a person, a wealthy individual and say: 'We want Mr X. You put up 70, 80, 100 per cent of the money, let him play here.' It is a little bit like a loan deal between two clubs, except it is a loan deal between the club and a third party\".\n\nJoorabchian also claimed that concealed third-party ownership arrangements were common in the Premier League, saying in 2007: \"I know a lot of players in the Premier League - and other leagues - which are here in the same format as we have done, but in a hidden scheme\".\n\nConnection to Manchester City\n\nIn January 2009 it emerged that Joorabchian had been present at a meeting between representatives of Manchester City and A.C. Milan, arranged to discuss the possible -although in the end unsuccessful- \u00a391 million transfer to City of the Brazilian footballer, Kak\u00e1.\n\nPress reports connected Joorabchian to City's signing of Robinho in 2008 and suggested that he was exercising a wider influence over the shape of City's transfer policy, specifically in attempting to bring a single megastar to the club to reflect a changed status under the ownership of Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, rather than build a side of proven Premier League performers. Joorabchian admitted to having an informal association with Manchester City in October 2008.\n\nSources at Manchester City suggested that Joorabchian and Pini Zahavi had developed links to the club under the regime of the previous owner, Thaksin Shinawatra, who had originally appointed the City chief executive Garry Cook. Cook himself said that the club \"did not need and did not seek\" Joorabchian's help in facilitating the negotiations with A.C. Milan. Joorabchian was involved in the leaking of Carlos Tevez's transfer request to Manchester City on 11 December 2010, by revealing the news to the Sunday Mirror newspaper.\n\nInvolvement with Ramires\n\nIn June 2010, it was reported that Joorabchian had secured a 50% share in the Brazilian midfielder Ramires for \u20ac6 million (through Jazzy Limited, Joorabchian as sole director), then at Benfica but subject to transfer interest from across Europe, led by Chelsea in the Premier League. The deal was reportedly part of an agreement reached with Benfica president Lu\u00eds Filipe Vieira the previous year at the time of Ramires's transfer to Benfica from Cruzeiro in Brazil.\n\nBenfica declared in its financial report that the club received \u20ac11 million (50% of the fee) and generated \u20ac8.8 million profit.\n\nRamires completed his move to Chelsea on 13 August 2010 on a four-year contract for a fee of \u20ac22 million. It is thought that Joorabchian would receive around \u20ac11 million of this fee, which Benfica also revealed in its financial report that the club had a net debt of \u20ac5,479,526 to Jazzy Limited, excessed \u20ac479,526 by \u20ac11 million minus \u20ac6 million.\n\nNewcastle United\n\nOn 12 January 2010, it was reported by outlets such as ESPN that Joorabchian had been appointed to the position of \"Football Advisor\" at the club, and would be leading a clear-out of players, bringing in talented youth from around the world.\n\nSports Invest UK Limited\n\nJoorabchian is the sole director of Sports Invest UK Limited, with registered FIFA agent Nojan Bedroud. The company was a creditor of Portsmouth F.C. for \u00a3600,000."}, {"url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/horseracing/16694049/kia-joorabchian-racing/", "page_content": "IT was only after someone 'did a job' on football agent Kia Joorabchian that he was inspired to get involved with racing.\n\nKnown for his work with footballers Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano, Joorabchian has become a leading racing stakeholder through his ownership outfit Amo Racing.\n\n1 Kia Joorabchian came to prominence as a football agent\n\nHowever, his life in the sport has not always been quite so smooth.\n\nIn an interview with the Racing Post, the 50-year-old described how in 2003 being swindled out of \u00a340,000 on the very first horse he bought inspired him to get more involved in the sport.\n\n\"The first horse that I bought went very, very wrong,\" Joorabchian said.\n\n\"I was quite young and somebody did a good job on me.
