In 1931, Ernest O. Lawrence invented the cyclotron at Berkeley, ushering in the era of high-energy physics and a tradition of achievement that continues today. Nine of Berkeley\u2019s 22 Nobel Prizes were awarded to Berkeley physicists. The most recent National Research Council nationwide rankings identify the department as one of the best in the nation.\n\nIn the last 50 years, Berkeley physicists have made many of the significant discoveries that support today\u2019s science. These discoveries extend from fundamental properties of elementary particles to spin echoes\u2014the basis of magnetic resonance imaging to cutting-edge breakthroughs for building an accurate model of how the universe took shape following the monster explosion commonly known as the Big Bang. Today, faculty members are leading the way in scientific research and discovery in ways that may challenge the fundamental laws of physics particularly in the areas of gravitation, matter, and energy. At the same time, undergraduate and graduate teaching\u2014through formal courses and research activity \u2014 is an integral part of the faculty\u2019s commitment to the development of tomorrow\u2019s scientists.\n\nIn their pursuit of original research, physics faculty members collaborate with postdoctoral fellows, Ph.D. graduate students, undergraduate students, and visiting scholars. Research opportunities include a wide range of topics in theoretical and experimental physics, astrophysics, atomic physics, molecular physics, biophysics, condensed matter, cosmic rays, elementary particles and fields, energy and resources, fusion and plasma, geochronology, general relativity, low-temperature physics, mathematical physics, nuclear physics, optical and laser spectroscopy, space physics, and statistical mechanics.\n\nUndergraduate Programs\n\nPhysics: BA, Minor\n\nGraduate Program\n\nPhysics: MA, PhD\n\nVisit Department Website"}, {"url": "https://history.aip.org/phn/21506002.html", "page_content": "Tip: Search within this page by using Ctrl + F or \u2318 + F\n\nOver 1000 biographies of physicists and histories of institutions with information pertaining to their lives, careers, and research.\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley.

Therefore, the emphasis is on this general understanding rather than on specialized skills, although some specialized courses are among the options open to the student. Those considering a physics major are urged to consult a departmental adviser early, in order to discuss the content of the major and also the opportunities after graduation. Recent graduates have entered graduate work in a number of scientific fields, and others have gone on to jobs in academic, industrial, and government laboratories. Declaring the Major Students may declare a physics major when all of the prerequisites for the major have been completed or their equivalent with a 2.0 grade-point average (GPA) in the prerequisites and a 2.0 GPA in all University courses. For further information regarding the prerequisites, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page. The department will consider applications to declare a physics major throughout the academic year. Students (continuing and transfer) declaring must furnish a copy of their grade record or past transcripts which include the prerequisite courses or their equivalents. Students must have their records reviewed and have a departmental file prepared by the undergraduate advisors in 368 or 374 Physics North prior to seeing a faculty major adviser for departmental approval of the petition to declare a physics major. Students should be prepared to discuss a tentative schedule of their upper division courses. Honors Program Students with an overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 or higher in all courses in the major, upper division courses in the major, and all University courses may be admitted to the honors program. A major advisor should be consulted before the student's last year of residence. This program requires completion of the major, at least one semester of PHYSICS H190, and a senior thesis, PHYSICS H195A and PHYSICS H195B. Minor Program The department also offers a minor program in Physics. Students may petition for a minor in Physics from the time that the requirements are complete until the student graduates from the College of Letters & Science. Students who have completed the requirements for the minor will be required to furnish transcripts (official or unofficial) to the undergraduate advisors (in 368 or 374 Physics North) to show their work and GPA in physics and math. After completing a confirmation of minor program petition (available in 368 or 374 Physics North), the students will be directed to a faculty major adviser who will approve the completion of the minor program. Visit Department Website\n\nMinor Requirements Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas. General Guidelines All minors must be declared before the first day of classes in your Expected Graduation Term (EGT). For summer graduates, minors must be declared prior to the first day of Summer Session A. All upper-division courses must be taken for a letter grade. A minimum of three of the upper-division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley. A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required in the upper-division courses to fulfill the minor requirements. Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters & Science students. No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs. All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which the student plans to graduate. If students cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, they should see a College of Letters & Science adviser. All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling.

For College advising appointments, please visit the L&S Advising Pages. University of California Requirements Entry Level Writing All students who will enter the University of California as freshmen must demonstrate their command of the English language by fulfilling the Entry Level Writing requirement. Fulfillment of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all reading and composition courses at UC Berkeley. American History and American Institutions The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a US resident graduated from an American university, should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States. Berkeley Campus Requirement American Cultures All undergraduate students at Cal need to take and pass this course in order to graduate. The requirement offers an exciting intellectual environment centered on the study of race, ethnicity and culture of the United States. AC courses offer students opportunities to be part of research-led, highly accomplished teaching environments, grappling with the complexity of American Culture. College of Letters & Science Essential Skills Requirements Quantitative Reasoning The Quantitative Reasoning requirement is designed to ensure that students graduate with basic understanding and competency in math, statistics, or computer science. The requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course. Foreign Language The Foreign Language requirement may be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in reading comprehension, writing, and conversation in a foreign language equivalent to the second semester college level, either by passing an exam or by completing approved course work. Reading and Composit ion In order to provide a solid foundation in reading, writing, and critical thinking the College requires two semesters of lower division work in composition in sequence. Students must complete parts A & B reading and composition courses in sequential order by the end of their fourth semester. College of Letters & Science 7 Course Breadth Requirements Breadth Requirements The undergraduate breadth requirements provide Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program. As the foundation of a liberal arts education, breadth courses give students a view into the intellectual life of the University while introducing them to a multitude of perspectives and approaches to research and scholarship. Engaging students in new disciplines and with peers from other majors, the breadth experience strengthens interdisciplinary connections and context that prepares Berkeley graduates to understand and solve the complex issues of their day. Unit Requirements 120 total units\n\nOf the 120 units, 36 must be upper division units\n\nOf the 36 upper division units, 6 must be taken in courses offered outside your major department Residence Requirements For units to be considered in \"residence,\" you must be registered in courses on the Berkeley campus as a student in the College of Letters & Science. Most students automatically fulfill the residence requirement by attending classes here for four years, or two years for transfer students. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless you go abroad for a semester or year or want to take courses at another institution or through UC Extension during your senior year. In these cases, you should make an appointment to meet an adviser to determine how you can meet the Senior Residence Requirement. Note: Courses taken through UC Extension do not count toward residence. Senior Residence Requirement After you become a senior (with 90 semester units earned toward your BA degree), you must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence in at least two semesters. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least 6 passed units. Intercampus Visitor, EAP, and UC Berkeley-Washington Program (UCDC) units are excluded. You may use a Berkeley Summer Session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence requirement, provided that you successfully complete 6 units of course work in the Summer Session and that you have been enrolled previously in the college. Modified Senior Residence Requirement Participants in the UC Education Abroad Program (EAP), Berkeley Summer Abroad, or the UC Berkeley Washington Program (UCDC) may meet a Modified Senior Residence requirement by completing 24 (excluding EAP) of their final 60 semester units in residence. At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after you have completed 90 units. Upper Division Residence Requirement You must complete in residence a minimum of 18 units of upper division courses (excluding UCEAP units), 12 of which must satisfy the requirements for your major.\n\nStudent Learning Goals Mission The goal of the Physics major is to provide students with a broad understanding of the physical principles of the universe, to help them develop critical thinking and quantitative reasoning skills, to empower them to think creatively and critically about scientific problems and experiments, and to provide training for students planning careers in physics and in the physical sciences broadly defined including those whose interests lie in research, K-12 or college teaching, industrial jobs, or other sectors of society. Physics majors complete a program which includes foundational lower division course work in math and physics and in-depth upper division course work. These topics are traditionally broadly divided into classical and modern physics. Some core topics, such as special relativity, classical optics, and classical thermodynamics, are covered only in lower division courses. Other topics, such as quantum mechanics, classical mechanics, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, electricity and magnetism, and optics, are covered first at an introductory level in lower division and then at a more advanced level in the upper division courses. Advanced elective courses provide students the opportunity to further their knowledge in specific areas (such as atomic physics, condensed matter physics, optical properties, quantum computing, biophysics, astrophysics, particle physics). A two-semester upper division laboratory course provides additional training in electronic instrumentation, circuits, computer interfacing to experiments, independent project design, and advanced laboratory techniques experiments. This laboratory course also provides the capstone experience to the core courses, bringing the knowledge gained in different courses together and making the connection between theoretical knowledge taught in textbooks/homework problems and the experimental foundations of this knowledge. Activities outside the classroom, such as independent research or study, allow students to further develop their knowledge and understanding. A student graduating from Berkeley with a major in physics will understand classical and modern physics (as outlined in the course requirements below) and will also acquire the skills to apply principles to new and unfamiliar problems. Their understanding should include the ability to analyze physical problems (often posed as word problems), be able to derive and prove equations that describe the physics of the universe, understand the meaning and limitations of these equations, and have both physical and numerical insight into physical problems (e.g., be able to make order-of-magnitude estimates, analyze physical situations by application of general principles as well as by textbook type calculations). They will also have developed basic laboratory, library, and computational skills, be familiar with important historical experiments and what physics they revealed, and be able to make both written and oral presentations on physics problems posed to them. At graduation, physics majors will have a set of fundamental competencies that are knowledge-based, performance/skills-based, and affective. Learning Goals for the Major Graduates will have the following: Mastered a broad set of knowledge concerning the fundamentals in the basic areas of physics (quantum mechanics, classical mechanics, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, electricity and magnetism, optics, and special relativity). This does not refer to knowledge about specific facts, but rather to a working knowledge of fundamental concepts that can then be applied in many different ways to understand or predict what nature does. An understanding of the physical principles required to analyze a physical question or topic, including those not previously seen, and both quantitative and qualitative physical insight into these principles in order to understand or predict what happens. This includes understanding what equations and numerical physical constants are needed to describe and analyze fundamental physics problems. A set of basic physical constants that enable their ability to make simple numerical estimates of physical properties of the universe and its constituents. An understanding of how modern electronic instrumentation works, and how both classical and modern experiments are used to reveal the underlying physical principals of the universe and its constituents. An understanding of how to use computers in data acquisition and processing and how to use available software as a tool in data analysis. An understanding of modern library search tools used to locate and retrieve scientific information. Skills Graduates will have the following abilities: Solve problems competently by identifying the essential parts of a problem and formulating a strategy for solving the problem. Estimate the numerical solution to a problem. Apply appropriate techniques to arrive at a solution, test the correctness of the solution, and interpret the results. Explain the physics problem and its solution in both words and appropriately specific equations to both experts and non-experts. Understand the objective of a physics laboratory experiment, properly carry out the experiments, and appropriately record and analyze the results. Use standard laboratory equipment, modern instrumentation, and classical techniques to carry out experiments. Know how to design, construct, and complete a science-based independent project (specifically in the area of electronics). Know and follow the proper procedures and regulations for safely working in a lab. Communicate the concepts and results of their laboratory experiments through effective writing and oral communication skills. Affective Graduates will be able to do the following: Successfully pursue career objectives in graduate school or professional schools, in a scientific career in government or industry, in a teaching career, or in a related career. Think creatively about scientific problems and their solutions, to design experiments, and to constructively question results they are presented with, whether these results are in a newspaper, in a classroom, or elsewhere.\n\nMajor Map Major Maps help undergraduate students discover academic, co-curricular, and discovery opportunities at UC Berkeley based on intended major or field of interest.

Physics and biology are two such fields. It takes an adventurous scientist to seek training in these two fields at the same time. But the impact, when they are brought together, is extraordinary. The Biophysics Graduate Group at Berkeley exists to train aspiring trans-disciplinary researchers to build bridges from biology to physics and back, so that they can transform biology by bringing to it the quantitative rigor and power of physics.\n\nWe are cognizant that there are many ways to apply quantitative, physics-based approaches to biology, and the program is designed to be flexible to accommodate these.

He received the Yukawa Commemoration Prize in Theoretical Physics and is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nResearch Interests\n\nI am working on particle physics, trying to understand the fundamental constituents of matter and the forces acting among them. The so-called \"Standard Model\" of particle physics is very successful, and the Higgs boson, which is the \"core\" of the Standard Model, is supposed to be discovered this decade. However, there are still many problems which remain unanswered even with a future discovery of the Higgs boson. Why are there so many \"elementary\" particles, repeating three generations which have identical properties except their masses? Why are there three (electromagnetic, weak and strong) forces acting on elementary particles in a seemingly random manner? Why does the Higgs boson exist and play such a special role? Why is the Universe so long-lived and has more matter than antimatter in it?\n\nRecently, two important questions were added to the list. The Universe appears to be accelerating its expansion. Why? The neutrinos are supposed to be completely massless in the Standard Model, but recent indications of neutrino oscillations strongly suggest that they have small but finite masses. How?\n\nThese puzzling phenomena must be clues to what is really going on at the most fundamental level in Nature. Using these clues, studying them in detail and asking what is behind is the approach in most of my research.\n\nCurrent Projects\n\nI\u2019m struggling with the question of how we can understand the small but finite value of the cosmological constant. One of the important question is the so-called \"Why Now?\" question, why we seem to live at the special moment in the history of the Universe where the matter energy density is the same as that of the cosmological constant within a factor of two. Together with Nima Arkani-Hamed, Lawrence Hall, and our former postdoc Chris Kolda, we pointed out that there is a triple coincidence of energy densities including the radiation. Such a coincidence must have an explanation. We further pointed out that, if the cosmological constant is tied to the scale of electroweak physics as TeV2/MPl, the triple coincidence is an inevitable consequence, explaining \"Why Now.\" I believe this sheds important light on the origin of cosmological constant. The way the electroweak scale and cosmological constant are connected remains to be a major puzzle. Another important question is if the acceleration of the Universe is really due to the cosmological constant. Together with my ex-student Alex Friedland and our postdoc Maxim Perelstein, I study if alternative forms of Dark Energy are consistent with cosmological observations and particle-physics constraints.\n\nNeutrino oscillations had been studied over many decades, but my ex-students Andr\u00e9 de Gouv\u00eaa, Alexander Friedland and I had found that past analyses of data covered only a half of the parameter space (\"the light side\"). The other half (\"the dark side\") can actually explain the current data on solar neutrinos, and has been completely missed in the literature. I continue active studies on how we attack the problems of neutrino masses. For example, Lawerence Hall, his student Neal Weiner, and I pointed out that a near-maximal mixing in atmospheric neutrino oscillation, often regarded as the most puzzling feature, may well be a consequence of randomness in parameters. We called it \"anarchy.\" My current student Aaron Pierce and I showed how near future neutrino experiments can pin down on oscillation parameters. The future in this area appears very bright. The origin of small neutrino masses may well be connected to the question why there appears to be only matter but no antimatter in the Universe.\n\nMost explanations to the current puzzles require physics at much shorter distance scales than the electroweak scale 10\u201316 cm, possibly the Planck scale 10-\u201333 cm. Na\u00efve estimates of quantum corrections suggest such a hierarchy in distance scales is unstable. Supersymmetry is probably the most promising way to stabilize the hierarchy. The mechanism of supersymmetry breaking has consequences on collider experiments to string theory. Gian Giudice, Markus Luty, I, and Riccardo Rattazzi had found a contribution to supersymmetry breaking from subtle quantum effects called anomalies, overlooked for two decades.

The three awards this year brings the total of Berkeley Lab R&D 100 wins to 108, including two Editors\u2019 Choice Awards. The winners were honored in virtual awards ceremonies from Oct. 19-21, 2021.\n\nFollowing are descriptions of the winning technologies:\n\nA new lithography photomask material for mass production of logic and memory chips\n\n\u200b\u200bManufacturers of devices like smartphones or computers are continually trying to scale down the components that go onto each system-on-a-chip (SOC) in order to add performance and power without significantly raising costs. This downscaling is achieved using photolithography, which is the approach that enables high-volume manufacturing by rapidly copying the layout of a pattern from a photomask onto a target wafer. The technique is limited by the size of the wavelengths, and so downscaling has required increasingly shorter wavelengths.\n\nA new photolithography technology called extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL), which uses extremely small-wavelength light and is capable of patterning very small features, has recently been deployed at the largest chip makers, but \u200b\u200bone challenge of the new technology is the thickness of the mask pattern that is required to ensure typical absorber materials are dark enough to sufficiently block the light. Berkeley Lab scientists have created a new, darker absorber material, chromium-antimony, that results in high-quality nanometer films and can be patterned with a high degree of control and resolution, down to 5 nanometers. The invention promises high resolution, single exposure, and cost-effective patterning for the fabrication of logic and memory chips.\n\nInvestigators: Daniel Staaks (PI), Stefano Cabrini (Molecular Foundry), Patrick Naulleau, Farhad Salmassi, Eric Gullikson (Center for X-ray Optics, Materials Sciences Division)\n\nA novel cathode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries\n\nThe $30 billion-plus global lithium-ion battery market is expected to double in the next five years, with high performance, safe batteries critical to many industries. However, at high voltage, cathode materials currently used for Li-ion batteries degrade and show significant declining performance over time, limiting their usefulness in many key applications.\n\nImproved cathode materials could help batteries operate reliably at high capacity and high voltage over repeated cycles without sacrificing performance, safety, or cost. Berkeley Lab scientists have developed a unique cathode material that uses a layered- rocksalt intergrown structure, combining the high capacity of lithium-rich metal oxides, fast kinetics of a cation-ordered layered structure, along with structural stability of a cation-disordered rocksalt structure. Such a material has been shown to offer high capacity, fast charging time and energy transfer, and superior cycling and thermal stability. In addition, the cost for raw materials to produce layered-rocksalt intergrown electrodes is estimated to be significantly less than that of lithium-rich layered oxides when expensive cobalt is completely replaced by cost-effective iron. This innovation exemplifies a new battery electrode design concept and opens up a new class of high-performance intergrown cathode materials.\n\nInvestigators: Wei Tong (PI), Ning Li, Meiling Sun, Jing Xu (Energy Technologies Area) and Wanli Yang (Energy Sciences Area)\n\n\u200bA 3D, real-time radiation detection and mapping platform\n\nDetection and mapping of radiation sources is critical for international security, nuclear reactor safety, and decontamination efforts. Berkeley Lab scientists developed the Neutron and Gamma Ray Source Localization and Mapping Platform (NG-LAMP), the first real-time platform for mapping gamma ray and neutron sources in three dimensions. 3D maps can pinpoint contamination or hotspots to specific areas or objects better than 2D approaches used by the current portable radiation imaging systems in the market, enabling more efficient planning and response.\n\nThe NG-LAMP platform employs Berkeley Lab-developed Scene Data Fusion, which provides 3D, high resolution nuclear radiation maps with data from sensors on the device (including LiDAR and visual sensors) and radiation data. A Berkeley Lab-developed software suite, dubbed the Localization and Mapping Platform, combines the data collected by the device, and, in real time, the onboard computing unit uses the data to produce 3D reconstructions of the radioactivity (without transmitting sensor data and performing computation on an external platform). The 3D maps are then transmitted to the user over WiFi.\n\nThe lightweight device is suitable for portable operations and for operations on unmanned aerial and ground vehicles. Such a capability can support the U.S. military, international inspectors, and law enforcement in locating radiation sources, as well as support nuclear reactor emergency response and decontamination efforts.\n\nInvestigators: Joshua Cates (PI), Ryan Pavlovsky, Victor Negut, Brian Quiter, Tenzing Joshi, Alex Moran (Physical Sciences Area)\n\n###\n\nFounded in 1931 on the belief that the biggest scientific challenges are best addressed by teams, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and its scientists have been recognized with 14 Nobel Prizes. Today, Berkeley Lab researchers develop sustainable energy and environmental solutions, create useful new materials, advance the frontiers of computing, and probe the mysteries of life, matter, and the universe. Scientists from around the world rely on the Lab\u2019s facilities for their own discovery science. Berkeley Lab is a multiprogram national laboratory, managed by the University of California for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Science.\n\nDOE\u2019s Office of Science is the single largest supporter of basic research in the physical sciences in the United States, and is working to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time.

Broad."}, {"url": "https://www2.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/history-of-lbl.html", "page_content": "The Berkeley Lab, at it is known, is situated on a spectacular hillside site overlooking the campus of the University of California at Berkeley. Its proximity to one of the world's great universities is unique among the national laboratories. So, too is its cooperative relationship with the university. The laboratory has more than 3,000 employees. Of its 900 plus scientific staff members, more than 200 are members of the Berkeley faculty. Berkeley Lab is managed by the University of California for the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nErnest O. Lawrence founded the lab in August, 1931. But it was an event that occurred a dozen years before that destined Lawrence's course. Ernest Rutherford undertook an early study of nuclear transformations. The Englishman discovered that nuclear particles induce more transformations as they travel faster. If a machine could be invented to increase the number and speed of the particles, the field of study could rapidly advance; until then, nuclear physicists remained largely stymied.\n\nWhen Lawrence joined the faculty at the University of California in Berkeley in 1928, he planned to continue his work in photoelectricity. But in 1929, he read about a method for generating the fast particles sought by Rutherford, realized how to engineer such a machine, and started a revolution in physics.\n\nLawrence designed a machine that worked much like a swing, gradually increasing the speed of the moving particles with each cycle. He made use of the ability of a magnetic field to bend charged particles, allowing the particle to make repeated passes through the same accelerating field, gaining energy on each cycle. In January, 1931, he designed the first successful cyclotron. By August of that year, he had gained the right to use a neglected campus lab to house a larger cyclotron and the University of California Radiation Laboratory was created. As 26-inch, 37-inch, and 60-inch accelerators were developed, this old wooden building became the citadel of the cyclotroneers.\n\nAmerica was in the grip of the Great Depression, at its economic nadir, but Lawrence refused to allow his vision to die. Despite economic conditions, the 1930s were a decade of discovery in nuclear physics and scientists immigrated to America. Attracted by Lawrence's expertise, many were drawn to his nascent scientific mecca. Lawrence also attracted funding, private grants from philanthropists and scarce government money. In 1939, three years after he was named director of the laboratory, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his development of the cyclotron. It was the first of nine Nobel Prizes awarded to Berkeley Lab scientists.\n\nThen war loomed. Albert Einstein warned President Franklin D. Roosevelt that Germany might be developing an atomic explosive and Roosevelt authorized a crash program to build a bomb using the principles of nuclear fission. Funds began to flow into the mobilized laboratory, bringing unprecedented changes in its size and scope. Large teams of engineers and scientists encompassing a broad spectrum of disciplines were created and their coordinated efforts were brought to focus on a project. Today, Lawrence is remembered for pioneering this style of research. Historians call this period the beginning of \"big science.\"\n\nIn 1942, the Manhattan Engineering District was established within the purview of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to design and build an atomic weapon. J. Robert Oppenheimer, a professor of physics at the University of California at Berkeley, worked with a team of theoretical physicists there to design the weapon. But within months, it became evident that the job was too big to be done on campus. The team was moved to a new headquarters in Los Alamos, New Mexico.\n\nLawrence developed a plan to separate the explosive, or fissile part of naturally occurring uranium, U-235, from its much more plentiful companion isotope, U-238. Most physicists doubted that his electromagnetic separation process would work. But the bomb project was urgent; concern that the Germans might be ahead in their quest for an atomic weapon meant there was no time to build a pilot project to test Lawrence's design. In February, 1943, ground was broken at Oak Ridge, Tennessee for the gargantuan electromagnetic complex. Many Berkeley scientists and engineers went to Oak Ridge to assist in the construction and operation of the production plant.\n\nIn August, the plant began to operate. Initial positive results were followed by major disappointments. Then, Oppenheimer reported that the plant would have to produce three times more U-235 than had been thought necessary. Modifications were made to the plant and it was design was repeatedly refined.\n\nProceeding on a parallel track, Edwin McMillan, Glenn Seaborg and others of their colleagues at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory advanced a separate route to a nuclear explosion. Sifting through the swarm of radioactive species that fission produced, McMillan discovered something that behaved much like uranium, but that was new. By the nature of its radioactivity, he identified it as a new element, the 93rd in the periodic chart, and named it neptunium. Following up on the discovery, McMillan determined that mixed in with the neptunium was another new element. But before he could pinpoint its chemistry, he departed to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to work on the development of radar, an urgent war-time project.\n\nBack in Berkeley, Glenn Seaborg picked up the ball. Seaborg and colleagues confirmed the discovery of the 94th element, plutonium. Within a month, Seaborg and company discovered that plutonium was fissionable, that it might sustain an explosive chain reaction. Years later, in 1951, McMillan and Seaborg were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their discovery of these first transuranic elements.\n\nRacing to stay ahead of the Germans, a production plant was built for plutonium in Hanford, Washington. Like the U-235 plant in Tennessee, by June, 1945 it had produced barely enough fissile material to construct a nuclear bomb.\n\nAt that point, two designs existed for such a weapon, one using U-235, and the other, plutonium. Confidence was higher that the U-235 bomb would actually detonate; the plutonium bomb had a trigger mechanism thought to be of dubious efficacy. The decision was made to use the plutonium bomb for the first major test, but to save the U-235 for the real thing. On July 16, 1945, a desert test, code-named Trinity, successfully was performed in New Mexico.\n\nLawrence witnessed the fearsome desert test. Subsequently, in advice to the secretary of war, he recommended that rather than drop the atomic bomb on populated areas, a demonstration be conducted to persuade the Japanese to surrender. After discussion, he changed his mind, agreeing that the Japanese would not respond to a benign demonstration. By August 15, the U-235 fueled weapon had demolished Hiroshima, the plutonium-fueled weapon had extirpated Nagasaki, and Japan had submitted its unconditional surrender, ending the war in the Pacific.\n\nBerkeley Lab's wartime contributions extended beyond the production of fissionable bomb material. John Lawrence, brother of the laboratory's founder, had started Donner Laboratory circa 1936. Treating a patient with leukemia, he administered a radioactive isotope of phosphate. It was the first time that a radioactive isotope had been used in the treatment of a human disease and the beginning of a career-long interest for John Lawrence. He became known as the father of radio-pharmaceuticals. Today, his laboratory is considered the birthplace of nuclear medicine.\n\nDuring the war, John Lawrence and colleagues helped pilots deal with the consequences of high-altitude flying. Pressurized cabins did not exist at that point. The Donner Laboratory used radioactive isotopes of inert gases to study decompression sickness and other maladies. These tracer studies brought fundamental contributions to the understanding of the circulation and diffusion of gases. This research led to the development by the laboratory's Cornelius Tobias of aircraft oxygen equipment. Also developed as a result of this work were a parachute-opener, and methods to measure human circulation.\n\nNumerous advances were recorded during this pioneering era of nuclear medicine at the laboratory.\n\nPeople suffering from polycythemia vera, a rare disease characterized by an over-abundance of red blood cells, were treated with doses of radio-pharmaceuticals. It was the first disease to be controlled with radioisotopes. Hyperthyroidism was treated and diagnosed through the first use of radioiodine.\n\nJohn Lawrence and the laboratory also pioneered in protecting people from radiation.\n\nJohn Lawrence once recounted how early radiation safety criteria developed. \"Paul Aebersold and I first put a rat in the cyclotron chamber about 1937. After the cyclotron had run,\" said Lawrence, \"I crawled back in there to see how the rat was doing. When I opened the canister, the rat was dead. It scared all the physicists. I later learned that the rat died of suffocation, not radiation, but I didn't spread that news around. The physicists became much more interested in radiation protection after that. Soon the cyclotron was heavily shielded. And the word got around about radiation hazards, because we reported some of our early findings in a paper presented at a meeting in Buenos Aires.\"\n\nAfter World War II, the Radiation Laboratory made the transition to basic research. Between 1946 and 1949, 70 percent of its contracted work was nonmilitary. Free of the demands of war, laboratory personnel were intent on maintaining a leading role in experimental nuclear physics as well as in accelerator design. The 184-inch cyclotron, which was completed in 1942, became the centerpiece of research. In addition, they developed an electron synchrotron, a proton linear accelerator, and the Bevatron. When completed in 1954, the Bevatron could accelerate protons through four million turns in 1.85 seconds. At journey's end, they had traveled 300,000 miles and developed 6.2 GeV of energy.\n\nThe laboratory's medical group, the Donner Laboratory, gained federal funding to continue its prewar work in medical diagnosis, instrumentation, and therapy. Other work led down completely new avenues. The study of lipoprotein metabolism began at the laboratory.\n\nThe relationship between heart disease and cholesterol had been suggested in the early 1900s. But little was known about the nature of the relationship, and the source of blood cholesterol remained unknown. Then John Gofman brought a new technique to bear on the problem, ultracentrifugation. He and graduate student Frank Lindgren discovered that for some odd reason, some of the blood proteins floated rather than sank in the centrifuge tube. Analysis of these floating proteins revealed they contained cholesterol and other lipids, and the researchers realized they had isolated lipoproteins. This breakthrough opened the door to further understanding of the link between lipoproteins and heart disease. Subclasses of lipoproteins were identified. And, Gofman and Lindren were able to determine that the ratio of high density to low density lipoproteins is a strong indicator of heart disease risk.\n\nAnother new area of research involved the study of organic compounds labeled with carbon-14. Melvin Calvin used carbon-14 and the new techniques of ion exchange, paper chromatography, and radioautography. Working with his associates, they mapped the complete path of carbon in photosynthesis. In 1961, Calvin's work was recognized when he was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry.\n\nThen, in August, 1949, the Soviet Union startled the world, detonating an atomic bomb. Edward Teller, a Los Alamos Laboratory scientist, campaigned to develop a thermonuclear weapon, what Teller called the superbomb, and President Truman approved the project.\n\nWork toward development of what became known as the hydrogen bomb proceeded, but Teller became frustrated with the rate of development at the Los Alamos weapons laboratory. Convinced that a second weapons laboratory was needed, Teller lobbied the Atomic Energy Commission. In 1952, the Atomic Energy Commission granted Teller's request, establishing a Livermore Laboratory as a branch of the Berkeley-based University of California's Radiation Laboratory. About an hour's drive from Berkeley, it was located at a deactivated naval air station near the little town of Livermore.\n\nThe Livermore Laboratory remained a branch of the Berkeley facility until that administrative arrangement ended in 1971. Until then, Livermore did most of the applied science work including weapons development, the Pluto project to develop nuclear rockets and the Plowshares project which proposed to create peaceful uses for nuclear weapons. This division of labor between Berkeley and Livermore allowed the Berkeley laboratory to reconcentrate on basic nuclear science. Beyond that, it resulted in the diminishment and ultimate elimination of all classified research at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley.\n\nErnest Lawrence died in 1958. The two laboratories subsequently were renamed as the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory-Berkeley, and the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory-Livermore. Despite sharing Lawrence's name, all administrative ties between the two laboratories were severed in 1971 by the governing University of California Board of Regents. Later, the facilities were renamed and today are know as Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory or Berkeley Lab, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.\n\nCurrently, Berkeley Lab is home to multiple interdisciplinary groups working in divisions that include (as of November 1994) chemical sciences; earth sciences; energy and environment; materials sciences; life sciences; human genome; structural biology; accelerator and fusion research; Advanced Light Source; nuclear science; physics; engineering; environment, health, and safety; and information and computing sciences.\n\nBig Science, for which the laboratory is best known, continues on the grand scale. The laboratory has begun a major new initiative in materials sciences, emphasizing advanced materials development. At the heart of this endeavor is the Advanced Light Source. The most sophisticated accelerator ever to be built in Berkeley, its construction began in 1987. Completed in 1993, it operates as a national research facility.\n\nAn electron synchrotron, the machine is capable of boosting the energies of electrons to about 1.5 billion electron volts. Using special magnets called wigglers and undulators, this unique accelerator will be able to generate laser-like beams of soft x-ray and ultraviolet light 10,000 times more brilliant than any light source now available. Unseen realms of sciences will be illuminated by this fantastic light. The Advanced Light Source serves as a microprobe for studying the atomic structure of materials, a camera than can freeze-frame chemical reactions at twenty-trillionths of a second, a microscope than can safely peer inside living cells, or a tool that can fabricate electronic microstructures with features smaller than a hundred-thousandths of an inch. Additionally, the Advanced Light Source can be used to create three-dimensional x-ray holograms of structures, including those of a living cell.\n\nRivaling the scope of possibilities posed by the Advanced Light Source is another relatively new laboratory project, the deciphering of the human genome.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy named the laboratory as one of its Human Genome Centers to undertake this project. The project, which involves a number of cooperating institutions around the world, is considered to be the largest scientific undertaking in the history of the life sciences.\n\nWithin the nucleus of each of the some hundred trillion cells that compose a human body is a \"recipe book\" of sorts. The book contains hundreds of thousands of individual recipes, organized into 46 chapters, that together comprise the instructions for making an individual human being. The recipe book is called a genome, and is written in the \"genetic code,\" a language that can be used to describe all life on Earth. The ability to decipher the genome -- it's been called the \"Holy Grail of Biology\" -- could become the most powerful medical and biological research tool ever conceived. Many health problems have been linked to a breakdown in the genetic process including cancer, heart disease, and more than 3,000 other afflictions. Being able to read the human genome is a precursor to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of genetic-linked afflictions.\n\nBerkeley Lab teams life scientists, computer scientists, and instrumentation engineers to develop new technologies for faster, less expensive means of mapping the 300,000 genes and sequencing the some six billion nucleotides the compose the human genome. The Lab also is developing new database management techniques. Beyond the expected benefits to human health, the ability to read the genetic code should be a boon for all biologically related research, especially agriculture and the bio-technology industry, which has its hub in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nIn the physics division, a major focus of the high-energy physics work is the design, construction, and operation of particle detectors, instruments which record the results of high-energy collisions generated by accelerators. Physics Division scientists made major contributions in the creation of the world's largest detectors, the Collider Detector facility and the D-Zero facility, designed for use at the Fermi National Laboratory's Tevatron, the world's highest energy accelerator.\n\nThe Stanford Linear Accelerator Center uses two other detectors designed by Berkeley Lab, the Time Projection Chamber and the Mark II. These detectors have recorded data that raise questions about a theory of why the number of solar neutrinos detected is only one third of what physics models predict. According to the theory, a type of WIMP (weakly interactive massive particle) conducts energy to the surface of the sun, cooling its core, which results in fewer solar neutrinos. But experimental results at Stanford analyzing collisions between electrons and their antimatter counterparts showed no particles with properties that fit the proposed WIMP.\n\nBerkeley Lab remains in the vanguard of medical research. John Lawrence and his associates discovered that different tissues in the human body displayed a proclivity for different radioactive isotopes and they used this preference for disease diagnosis. Researchers continue to develop more sophisticated radiotracers that disappear from the body within seconds, allowing larger doses to be administered and tests to be modified and repeated.\n\nThe laboratory is a world leader in biomedical imaging. A variety of imaging techniques being refined at the laboratory allow physicians to look inside the body of a patient without resorting to a scalpel. In some cases, medical imaging \"sees\" that which even a surgeon's eye cannot. Life sciences researchers are employing imaging techniques to study diseases of the brain and heart. Using a combination of positron emission tomography, single photo emission computer tomography, and nuclear magnetic resonance, new insights have been gained about Alzheimer's disease. The disease afflicts one out of every four elderly Americans, causing their minds to degenerate. Studying glucose metabolism and the patterns of blood flow to the brain, researchers discovered that the hippocampus becomes atrophied early in the course of the disease. The hippocampus plays an essential role in memory and learning.\n\nResearch is the lifeblood of Berkeley Lab, but its mission includes assuring that there will be a next generation of talented, trained minds to draw upon. The traditional, cooperative relationship between the laboratory and the Berkeley campus makes education an almost inevitable point of focus for the laboratory. More than 600 graduate students conduct thesis research at the laboratory. Additionally, enrichment programs for select high school and college students are offered as are programs for science teachers. To deal with the ongoing growth of these programs, the Center for Science and Engineering Education has been established.\n\nBesides working with students and educators, the laboratory has strengthened its ties to industry. Increased emphasis has been placed on technology transfer. Disseminating information to industrial scientists and expanding its patent and licensing activities has resulted in handsome dividends to the nation.\n\nToo, the laboratory is seeking more collaborative efforts with U.S. industry. Currently, the Center for Advanced Materials is working with industry to develop plastics that are stronger than steel and semiconductor materials that are faster than silicon.\n\nThe Center for Building Science has tackled the problem of the wasteful use of energy. Windows leak a tremendous amount of heat from buildings, immensely escalating the nation's energy bill. Scientists have developed a new type of window that leaks no more heat than a solid insulated wall. Additionally, staggering energy savings are possible through improved lighting. Lighting uses about 20 to 25 percent of U.S. electric energy. The nation's lighting bill could be halved through use of new, inexpensive, compact, screw-in fluorescent bulbs, solid-state ballasts, and other lighting improvements invented at the laboratory.\n\nOnce an institution where high energy physics dominated all else, Berkeley Lab's missions since have multiplied across the spectrum of science. As the questions posed by science have evolved over the decades, the laboratory has adapted. Ernest Lawrence's interdisciplinary approach -- physicists, biologists, physicians, and chemists working together -- has made this adaptation possible. Berkeley Lab's interdisciplinary teams are its link to the past and its bridge to the future.\n\nAuthor's note"}, {"url": "https://history.lbl.gov/", "page_content": "The Lab\u2019s legacy began in the summer of 1928, when a 27-year-old physics professor named Ernest O. Lawrence was wooed from his faculty position at Yale University to a job at the University of California\u2019s Berkeley campus. While at Berkeley, Lawrence invented a unique particle accelerator called a cyclotron which would prove his hypothesis: whirling charged particles around to boost their energies, then casting them toward a target is an effective way to smash open atomic nuclei. The cyclotron would go on to win Lawrence the 1939 Nobel Prize in physics and usher in a new era in the study of subatomic particles. Through his work, Lawrence launched the modern era of multidisciplinary, team science. In August of 1931, when he created the Radiation Laboratory in a modest building on the Berkeley campus, Lawrence began recruiting a brilliant circle of colleagues from physics, chemistry, biology, engineering and medicine, whose groundbreaking teamwork would be critical to the laboratory\u2019s legendary success. When his plans for bigger and better atom-smashing cyclotrons required more room, he moved the laboratory off campus and up to its present location in the Berkeley hills, overlooking the San Francisco Bay. After his death in 1959, the Lab was officially renamed the Ernest O. Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.\n\nToday, Berkeley Lab continues the tradition of multidisciplinary scientific teams working together to solve global problems in human health, technology, energy, and the environment. Fourteen Nobelists have worked here.

However, translating their promise into viable technology requires the ability to modulate skyrmion properties, and their electrical detection under ambient conditions. Partnering with researchers in Singapore we have successfully demonstrated and visualized the control of magnetic properties of skyrmions at room temperature. This was achieved by developing a novel CMOS-compatible thin film material platform enabling the bottom-up control of skyrmion properties. The visualization was achieved by the direct imaging of skyrmions using the CXRO soft x-ray microscope at ALS (BL6.1.2, XM-1). The results demonstrated the ability to modulate the size, density, and stability of skyrmions by varying the thickness of constituent layers - all while using semiconductor industry-compatible fabrication techniques. In conjunction, the world-first electrical detection (Hall effect) of ambient skyrmions was also demonstrated. This breakthrough development provides a stepping stone for realizing stable and highly scalable (10 nm and below) non-volatile memory.\n\nRef: A. Soumyanarayanan, M. Raju, A. L.

Defying racial and academic expectations, James A. Harris played a prominent role in the discovery of two elements.\n\nHarris, who grew up in both Texas and California, earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in chemistry in 1953 from Huston-Tillotson College in Austin, Texas. He then served in the US Army, ultimately earning the rank of sergeant. After his honorable discharge from the Army, he struggled to find work as a chemist due to racial discrimination, as most potential employers did not accept that a Black man was qualified to work in science. Harris eventually landed a job as a radiochemist at Tracerlab in Richmond, California, in 1955, where he worked for 5 years.\n\nHis most noteworthy work was at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the 1960s and 1970s. Despite not having a PhD, Harris thrived at the national lab, leading the Heavy Isotopes Production Group as a part of the Nuclear Chemistry Division. His primary job was to prepare targets for the discovery of heavy elements. These are the materials that scientists bombard with elementary particles and nuclei from other atoms in order to forge new elements. While working with Harris to produce heavy elements, famed nuclear chemist Albert Ghiorso once noted that Harris\u2019s target was \u201cthe best ever made for heavy element research.\u201d A major factor in his successful preparation of these targets was his proficiency in executing difficult chemical separations.Thanks to Harris\u2019s persistence and scientific acumen, his team discovered two elements: element 104, rutherfordium, and 105, dubnium.\n\nHarris was an avid golfer, traveler, science communicator, and devoted family man,. He retired in 1988 after 28 years of service at LBNL. He died in 2000, leaving behind his wife and five children.\n\nRead more about the lives of American Black chemists\n\nC&EN: Black chemists you should know about\n\nUC Berkeley College of Chemistry"}]}
