With each passing episode, Erin becomes more and more relatable and, to some, likable.

According to the press release , \u201cFrank is blindsided when Mayor Chase bypasses him with a request for Jamie to head his security detail.\u201d Additionally, Danny and Baez are investigating a murder of a wealthy college student (will they get cozy while doing so? The past few episodes make it seem probable, but we shall see), and Eddie is experiencing tension with her partner. So, in short, Bridget's dive into directing has come with plenty of stories to align.\n\nAs expected, fans can hardly contain their excitement, both for the fact that the show is finally returning after an unexpected hiatus, but also to see how Bridget\u2019s eye navigates the storyline.\n\n\u201cCongrats! \ud83d\udc4f Hope it's the first of many,\u201d one fan exclaimed.\n\n\u201cCongratulations Bridget, so happy for you,\u201d another fan wrote.\n\n\u201cSo excited to see this new episode,\u201d someone else wrote.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not lost on folks that April 1 is April Fool\u2019s Day, so many fans are posting fingers-crossed emojis, hoping that the news is real and not just yet another elaborate prank. Thankfully, given the press release came out on March 10, it\u2019s likely the real deal.\n\nTo watch Bridget\u2019s episode, be sure to tune in to CBS at 10 p.m. ET. or catch up on ."}, {"url": "https://www.looper.com/822137/bridget-moynahan-just-made-a-major-career-move-on-blue-bloods/", "page_content": "\"Blue Bloods\" has been a consistent ratings hit for CBS for over a decade at this point.

Meanwhile, Frank (Tom Selleck) is taken aback when Jamie (Will Estes) gets put on security detail for the mayor. For the most part, fans seem to have taken kindly to Moynahan's directorial debut. The episode has earned a rating of 8.4/10 on IMDb with over 60 rankings. It's also garnered a couple of positive reviews, including one from a user who wrote, \"This show is in its 12th season and it never ceases to amaze me that it can develop new and interesting plotlines.\"\n\nMoynahan spoke about stepping into her directorial shoes with Entertainment Tonight. When asked about the biggest challenges with directing, the actress responded, \"I think that one of the challenges was really just doing the homework.

However, to this day Moynahan takes starring roles in blockbuster movies, small indie films and more linear TV shows. This looking for more of Moynahan's work may be surprised by her penchant for action roles and stunts.\n\nMoynahan is a Hollywood veteran with many recognizable appearances across various genres over the years. Beyond that, she often finds her way back into the cultural zeitgeist during huge NFL events due to her past with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nMoynahan dated Brady from 2004 to 2006. In a twist not unlike some of the comedies she has appeared in, Moynahan learned she was pregnant shortly after she and Brady broke up. They now share an 11-year-old son named John together, though Brady's current wife, Giselle B\u00fcndchen, has admitted that it made their early relationship awkward.\n\nStill, Moynahan is on friendly terms with Brady and supported his team in the Super Bowl earlier this month.

They are led by Tom Selleck, who plays NYPD Commissioner Frank Reagan. Moynahan has played Assistant District Attorney Erin Reagan since the show premiered on CBS.\n\n\u2018Blue Bloods\u2019 Star Finds Character Sometimes In Middle Of Family, Business\n\nBefore her current role, Moynahan appeared in other TV series like \u201cSex and the City,\u201d \u201cGoing to California,\u201d \u201cSix Degrees\u201d and \u201cEli Stone.\u201d\n\nMoynahan\u2019s character finds herself at times in the crossfire between family and business.

One thing Moynahan wishes she could change from that movie is the wardrobe.\n\n\u201cI feel a little bit bad about that film,\u201d Moynahan said in 2014 to HuffPost, \u201cBecause I think we were responsible for just every woman wearing really low-slung pants that maybe don\u2019t naturally fit well on people.\n\n\u201cSo I think we started a movement that maybe we should reconsider,\u201d she said.\n\nMoynahan is a native of Binghamton, N.Y., and has lived as well in Los Angeles.

In the case of CBS cop drama Blue Bloods, the show is all about family. At the center of the action are the Reagans, a New York City clan who count among them detectives, police commissioners, and assistant district attorney Erin Reagan, played by actress and model Bridget Moynahan.\n\nMoynahan has been on Blue Bloods since episode 1, and has brought a focused energy to a cast of characters known for letting their moods get the better of them. Around the famous Reagan family dinner table, Erin is often the contemplative one who only speaks when she has something important to say; Moynahan's measured performance makes for a perfect contrast to the steely intensity of her father, Frank Reagan (Tom Selleck), and hot-headed brother, Danny Reagan (Donnie Wahlberg).\n\nHowever, even though she feels integral to the believability of the Reagan family as a unit \u2014 and therefore the show's success \u2014 Moynahan almost skipped out on taking on the part of Erin for one very good reason. Why did the actress almost let what would turn out to be one of her most iconic roles pass by?"}, {"url": "https://outsider.com/entertainment/blue-bloods-what-were-bridget-moynahans-biggest-roles-before-portraying-erin-regean/", "page_content": "Since 2010, Bridget Moynahan has portrayed Erin Reagan-Boyle on the hit crime drama \u201cBlue Bloods.\u201d Her decision to play the role was somewhat surprising, considering the success she found in feature films throughout the 2000s. But the decision has paid off in more ways than one.\n\n\u201cBlue Bloods\u201d co-star Donnie Wahlberg, who portrays Danny Reagan on the show, convinced Moynahan to take the role by promising her his paycheck if they didn\u2019t end up filming on location in New York. Luckily for him, the show settled on New York, after all. But beyond the promise of incentive, Bridget Moynahan took the role for her own reasons. Among those was the ability to work consistently while still pursuing other roles in movies.\n\nIn recent years, fans may have recognized the \u201cBlue Bloods\u201d star in the fan-favorite shoot-em-up series \u201cJohn Wick.\u201d Moynahan appeared in both the 2014 original and the 2017 sequel, \u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 2.\u201d Before that, however, she found herself starring in major roles opposite some of the biggest names in Hollywood.\n\nOf course, much of this began with a seven-episode arc she did on \u201cSex and the City\u201d from 1999-2000. Around the same time she appeared on the hit show, Moynahan starred as Rachel in the ensemble drama \u201cCoyote Ugly.\u201d From there, the sky was the limit.\n\nShe starred as Dr. Cathy Muller, the love interest of Ben Affleck\u2019s Jack Ryan, in the 2002 Tom Clancy thriller \u201cThe Sum of All Fears.\u201d Then, she shared the screen with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino in the 2003 CIA action thriller \u201cThe Recruit.\u201d In 2004, the \u201cBlue Bloods\u201d star found herself opposite Will Smith in \u201cI, Robot.\u201d Rounding out an iconic four-year run, Moynahan starred in the 2005 Nicholas Cage-led action drama \u201cLord of War.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018Blue Bloods\u2019 Star Begins Transition to TV\n\nDuring this 2004-2006 period, the \u201cBlue Bloods\u201d star famously dated then-New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. The short-lived relationship resulted in the pair having a child together. John is the NFL star\u2019s oldest son.\n\nCoincidental or not, it was around this time that Bridget Moynahan made a move back to television. She starred in the J.J. Abrams produced series \u201cSix Degrees.\u201d Even though the show only ran for a single season. In 2008, she made a couple of guest appearances on the comedy series \u201cEli Stone.\u201d\n\nOnly two years later, she first appeared on \u201cBlue Bloods.\u201d In the first year following her debut on the Tom Selleck-led show, Moynahan was back to starring in feature films with her character Michele in \u201cBattle Los Angeles.\u201d From there, she appeared in a Christoper Meloni-driven film called \u201cSmall Time.\u201d\n\nThen it was \u201cJohn Wick,\u201d and that brings us to today. Bridget Moynahan continues to star on the long-running series \u201cBlue Bloods.\u201d And for now, there is no end in sight."}]}
