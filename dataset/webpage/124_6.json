Anil Kumble and Ajaz Patel are examples of players who have taken 10 wickets in a single innings.\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at some of the bowlers who have achieved the best bowling figure in test cricket:\n\n1. Jim Laker (10 Wickets for 53)\n\nJim Laker, former right-arm off-break spinner of England, is at the top position for getting the best bowling figure in test cricket. Jim Laker played against Australia where he took 9 wickets in the first innings and then 10 wickets in the second innings. He started his test career at the international level in the match against West Indies at Bridgetown on January 21 \u2013 26, 1948 where he took a total of 9 wickets in that match. He played his last match against Australia at Melbourne on February 13 \u2013 18, 1959. He appeared in 46 test matches and took 193 wickets for his team.\n\n2. Anil Kumble (10 Wickets for 74)\n\nAnil Kumble, a former leg break spinner of the Indian cricket team, is in the second position for getting the best bowling figure in the test matches. He took 10 wickets in the second innings while playing against Pakistan at Delhi on 4 Feb 1999. He started his test career from the match against England at Manchester on August 09 \u2013 14, 1990, and ended up with the match against Australia at Delhi on October 29 \u2013 November 02, 2008. He was one of the best spinners in the world who took more than 600 wickets in tests.\n\n3. Ajaz Patel (10 Wickets for 119)\n\nAjaz Patel, a left arm bowler of the New Zealand cricket team, is sitting at the number 3rd position for achieving the best bowling figure in test cricket. He dismissed all the 10 wickets in the first inning while playing against India at Wankhede stadium on 3 \u2013 6 Dec 2021. He made his test debut for New Zealand in the match against Pakistan at Abu Dhabi on Ajaz November 16 \u2013 19, 2018. Since his debut, he has played 11 test matches in which he has taken 43 wickets.\n\n4. George Lohmann (9 Wickets for 28)\n\nGeorge Lohmann, the former right arm medium fast bowler of England, stands at the number 4th position for making the best bowling figure in test cricket. While playing against South Africa at Johannesburg in 1896, he took 9 wickets in the first innings that assisted England to win that match by 197 runs. George Lohmann started his test career from the match against Australia at Melbourne on July 05 \u2013 07, 1886. He appeared in the 18 test matches for England and took 112 wickets in his test career.\n\n5. Jim Laker (9 Wickets for 37)\n\nJim Laker, the former right-arm off-break spinner of England, is again listed at the 5th position for getting the best bowling figure in test matches. On 26 Jul 1956, when England faced Australia, England batted first and added a total of 459 on the scoreboard. In reply, Australia could make only 84, and 205 in both innings and lost the match by 170 runs. Jim Laker was incredible with the ball as he took 9 wickets in the first innings and 10 wickets in the second innings.\n\nList of the Best Bowling Figures in Test Match"}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/best-bowling-figures", "page_content": "The World Cup competitions over the years have seen the best of the bowlers playing at their peak and making heads turn from all over the world.

His fellow Aussie pacer Andy Bichel also has the highest bowling figures by taking 7 wickets in an innings in the same tournament.

The league has flourished over the years and is now competing to become one of the most popular tournaments in the sports arena. Though the initial impression from IPL was that it is made just for batters, that thinking has changed in the last couple of years. Notably, the brand new sixteenth edition will commence from Friday, March 31, 2023 with a clash between defending Champions Gujarat Titans and four-time trophy holders Chennai Super Kings at the iconic Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.\n\nNow teams have realised that they need to have quality bowlers in their squad to win the title. In many games, it has been seen that one bowler completely changed the match to tilt it in the favour of his team. In this article, let\u2019s take a look at-\n\nBest Bowling Figures in IPL History\n\nThe record for best bowling figures in an IPL game belongs to young pacer Alzarri Joseph. He ran through the batting lineup of Sunrisers Hyderabad in a low scoring match and picked up 6 wickets for just 12 runs in 2019. Mumbai Indians had set a target of 137 runs for the Hyderabad team which looked completely achievable. However, SRH could not sustain the regular blows of Alzarri Joseph and got bundled for just 96 runs losing the match by 40 runs.\n\nThe record which Joseph broke was earlier held by Sohail Tanvir for 11 years. Tanvir had registered figures of 6/14 against Chennai Super Kings while playing for Rajasthan Royals in the inaugural season. The Chennai team got all out for 109 runs while batting first in this game, and the Royals chased this total very easily in 14.2 overs to win by 8 wickets.\n\nAdam Zampa announced himself to the IPL in style as he took a 6-fer for just 19 runs in just his second match in the league in 2016. He was vital in restricting Sunrisers Hyderabad to a total of 137/8 in 20 overs. However, the SRH bowlers made even this total look tough as CSK could only manage 133/8 in their innings, and lost the thriller by 4 runs.\n\nZampa\u2019s figure thus remains the best bowling performance in a losing cause. He will be donning the colours of Rajasthan Royals in the upcoming edition starting March 31 and will be gunning to bag the IPL Purple cap and take Royals all the way.\n\nThe great Indian leg spinner Anil Kumble displayed his class in IPL as well and still holds the record for the most economical 5-wicket haul. He took 5 wickets in an innings against Rajasthan Royals while giving away just 5 runs in 3.1 overs including a maiden. The Rajasthan team got dismissed for just 58 runs while chasing 134, the lowest innings total then, and second-lowest in the IPL history.\n\nNew MI sensation Akash Madhwal tore Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) apart with his magical bowling spell in the eliminator clash in IPL 2023. The seamer took five wickets for just five runs in his 3.3 over spell in Chennai where his side thrashed LSG by a huge margin of 81 runs to progress to Qualifier Two.\n\nIndia\u2019s talismanic pacer Jasprit Bumrah is fifth on the list of best bowling figures in IPL. The Mumbai Indians speedster breathed fire with the ball against KKR in IPL 2022 and delivered a fine spell. He gave away just 10 runs in his quota of four overs and took five wickets in the process.\n\nBest Bowling Figures in IPL\n\nPlayer Overs Bowling Figures Maidens Economy Against Year Alzarri Joseph 3.4 6/12 1 3.27 SRH 2019 Sohail Tanvir 4 6/14 0 3.50 CSK 2008 Adam Zampa 4 6/19 0 4.75 SRH 2016 Anil Kumble 3.1 5/5 1 1.57 RR 2009 Akash Madhwal 3.3 5/5 0 1.42 LSG 2023 Jasprit Bumrah 4 5/10 1 2.5 KKR 2022\n\n\n\n*Last updated on 30th May 2023"}, {"url": "https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/icc-cricket-world-cup/stats-zone/world-cup-records-stats-best-bowling-figures-glenn-mcgrath-andy-bichel-ashish-nehra/article27252649.ece", "page_content": "World Cups over the years have witnessed some of the best bowling spells in One-Day International cricket. Some of the most prominent bowlers have blown away batting line-ups with their control and ability to swing and seam the ball. Here, Sportstar looks at 10 of the best bowling spells in the history of Cricket World Cups.\n\nGlenn McGrath - Australia vs Namibia, Potchefstroom, 2003 (7 overs, 15 runs, 7wickets, 4 maidens)\n\nThe 2003 ICC World Cup featured the most five-wicket hauls in any edition. It can be considered as a bowlers\u2019 World cup. McGrath, the all-time leading wicket taker at the World cup, also owns the record for the best figures at the tournament. Though it came against an associate side like Namibia, this was a lethal spell with the new ball where the Australian great bowled 7 overs on the trot from the same end. Australia made 301 for 6 batting first and McGrath kept bowling in-swingers and out-swingers on the off stump line and troubled the Namibia batting line-up. In one of the best \u2018keeper-bowler combinations for dismissals, Adam Gilchrist took fourcatches of McGrath\u2019s bowling in this match.\n\nAndy Bichel - Australia vs England, Port Elizabeth, 2003 (10 overs, 20 runs, 7 wickets)\n\nThis spell, too, came at the 2003 ICC World cup in a high-profile match. Five out of the seven wickets were of past, present and future captains. And moreover this was a very close match in which Australia won by two wickets with two balls in hand and Bichel took seven out of the eight England wickets to fall that day. England was cruising at one stage at 66 for no loss in 9.4 overs but then Bichel tilted the balance of the match. England was reduced to 87 for 5 with Bichel playing a starring role in Australia\u2019s comeback. He returned to the attack to break a 90-run sixth-wicket partnership between Alec Stewart and Andrew Flintoff to give Australia the upper hand.\n\nTim Southee - New Zealand vs England, Wellington, 2015 (9 overs, 33 runs, 7 wickets)\n\nIn the 2015 ICC World cup, New Zealand won all its games en route to the final. And its bowling attack contributed immensely in its run to the final. In this game, England won the toss and chose to bat first on a good batting track. All of England\u2019s plans were crushed by Southee. Right from the word go he troubled the English batsmen with his outswingers. He bowled four English batsman with such balls including two swinging Yorkers. Southee\u2019s seven-wicket haul helped New Zealand bowl England out for 123.\n\nWinston Davis - West Indies vs Australia, Leeds, 1983 (10.3 overs, 7 wickets, 51 runs)\n\nThe West Indies team of the 70s and 80s under Clive Lloyd is considered to be the best in the world, along with the Australian team of late-90s and 2000s. The likes of Andy Roberts, Michael Holding and Malcolm Marshallformed a potent bowling attack, but this extraordinary bowling performance came from a lesser-known back-up bowler, Winston Davis. West Indies had made 252 batting first. Australia was 55 for 1 when Davis was introduced to the attack. He had played only one other ODI in his career, but sparked a turnaround for the West Indies by getting the prized scalp of Hughes. Later, he broke the 59-run third-wicket partnership between David Hookes and Graeme Yallop before removing Allan Border cheaply. He cleaned up the Australian tail in no time and led the Windies to a 101-run win.\n\nRead: 10 captains, one crown, game on\n\nGary Gilmour - Australia vs England, Leeds, 1975 (12 overs, 6 wickets, 14 runs, 6 maidens)\n\nThis was only the second five-wicket haul in World cup history in what wasonly the 31 ODI match ever. This is also the most economical five-wicket haul in World cup history and it came in the semifinals of the inaugural edition. The England batsmen had prepared themselves for Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thompson but Gary Gilmour took the spotlight that day. Left-arm swing bowler Gilmour was assisted by the cool breeze at Headingley andbowled 12 straight overs and had figures of 6 for 10 in nine overs at onestage. England was bundled out for 93 and Australia found was 39 for sixwhile chasing. Gilmour came in and the left-hander won the match for Australia with a valuable unbeaten 28. This was one of the greatest all-round performances in World cup history. Gilmour took another five-wicket haul in the final against West Indies in a losing cause.\n\nAshish Nehra - India vs England, Durban, 2003 (10 overs, 6 wickets, 23 runs, 2 maidens)\n\nInjuries hampered Nehra\u2019s career to a large extent but every time he was back from an injury he made things happen. In this game, India had made 250 for 9 against England and the onus was on the bowlers to defend the total on a Durban pitch that assisted them. Nehra didn\u2019t try anything different, stuck to the basics, bowled over the wicket and angled the ball away from the many right handers in the England line-up. Five out of his six wickets were either caught by the keeper or at slip as he executed his plans to perfection. He kept it very tight and the only 35-plus-run partnership in England\u2019s innings came after Nehra had completed his spell. In the end India won the game by a 82-run margin thanks mainly to the left-arm pacer from Delhi.\n\nShane Bond - New Zealand vs Australia, Port Elizabeth, 2003 (10 overs, 6 wickets, 23 runs, 2 maidens)\n\nThe Australian top order in 2003 comprising Matthew Hayden, Adam Gilchrist, Ricky Ponting and Damien Martyn had all made over 300 runs.But in a Super six fixture, Bond rattled through that experienced top order and almost won the game for his team. Bond had a simple action and hadexpress pace to soften the batsmen up. The six wicket-taking balls of Bond were over 145kmph. When Bond finished his spell, Australia was reeling at 88 for 7 in 29 overs but the Blackcaps let go of a glorious opportunity to beat the eventual champion. The right-arm pacer was named the man of the match back then but he would have traded that for a win.\n\nChaminda Vaas - Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh, Pietermaritzburg, 2003 (9.1 overs, 6 wickets, 25 runs, 2 maidens)\n\nSri Lanka has traditionally had a couple of quality spinners who have been the difference-makers for their team. In the fast-bowling department,Chaminda Vaas was one bowler who delivered consistently. He didn\u2019t have express pace but he relied on swing and was always backed by his captain to take wickets early on with the new ball, which is what he exactly didagainst Bangladesh in 2003. Vaas took four wickets in five balls in his very first over and all four were inswingers to the right hander. He also became the first player ever to take a hat trick in the first three balls in International cricket that day. He took one more wicket with the new ball in his third over and came back to bundle out Bangladesh for 124 by picking up the last wicket of Mashrafe Mortaza.\n\nKemar Roach - West Indies vs Netherlands, Delhi, 2011 (8.3 overs, 6 wickets, 27 runs)\n\nThis was another hat-trick in the World cup and it came from a West Indies pacer. Batting first, West Indies made 330 for eight. Already facing a mammoth task, Kemar Roach was hard to face for the Netherlands batsmen that day. He mostly bowled full, fast and straight and rattled the Associate side with timely wickets. Five out of his six wickets were either bowled or leg-before. He nailed the yorkers that day and took the hat-trick by dismissing the last three Holland batsmen.\n\n10) Mitchell Starc - Australia vs New Zealand, Auckland, 2015 (9 overs, 6 wickets, 28 runs)\n\nMitchell Starc was the player of the tournament in the 2015 edition and one of his best bowling performances came against New Zealand in the group stage. Batting first, Australia was bowled out for 151 in 32.2 overs withleft-arm pacer Trent Boult taking a five-wicket haul. Starc was one better by picking six and he almost won the match for Australia. New Zealand wascruising at 78 for 1 in 7.3 overs and 131 for 4 in 19.3 overs at two different points and looked set to win the game convincingly but the Australian pacerturned the match on its head. He was aggressive, bowled full and swung the ball both ways. Four of his six wickets were bowled and the New Zealand batsmen didn\u2019t have much of an answer to Starc\u2019s blistering pace and unerring accuracy. Though Kane Williamson held his nerve and won the game for New Zealand. Starc\u2019s spell will remain as one of the greatest ever."}, {"url": "https://www.crictracker.com/watch-jim-laker-records-the-best-bowling-figures-in-test-history/", "page_content": "Watch: Jim Laker records the best bowling figures in Test history: On July 31, 1956 Jim Laker took 19 wickets in a Test against Australia to record the best bowling figures in Test history, with this he also broke all records in the history of cricket. It was the third Ashes Test which was being played at Old Trafford. Off spinner Laker recorded the best ever bowling figures in a Test, a record that stands till-date.\n\nEngland had won the toss and elected to bat first. They put up a huge score of 459 with Peter Richardson and David Shepherd scoring tons. But it was Laker\u2019s spell of 16.4-37-9 that helped England bundle out the Australians for just 84.

England won by an innings and 170 runs, and with the next Test at the Oval ending in a draw, England also won the Ashes.\n\nIt is the only time a bowler has taken more than 17 wickets in a first class game. The interesting thing about those 19 wickets was none of them was caught in the deep while attempting a lofted hit. Each one was foxed beautifully by the flight and guile of the offie.

(@Zohaib1981) April 17, 2021\n\nMuralitharan made the ball drift in the air and landed the ball in the right areas. The off-spinner managed to get enough turns putting the English batters in two minds. Sri Lanka won the match by 10 wickets, and Muralitharan played a significant role in this win. He bowled 27 maidens giving away 65 runs with an economy rate of 1.19.\n\nOne of his greatest strengths was his ability to turn the ball even on flat batting wickets, so in this particular game, the wicket looked good for batting in the latter part, but the off-spinner managed to outsmart the English batters with his turn and bounce.\n\nRead: The bowling records still hold by Muttiah Muralitharan\n\n#9 Devon Malcolm- 9/57 vs South Africa in 1994 (The Oval)\n\nMalcolm was born in Jamaica but played for England, just like Jofra Archer. Surprisingly, he could not represent England in more Test matches. The pacer was amongst the fastest bowlers during that period.\n\nMalcolm outgunned the South African batting line-up in this game with his speed and swing. His figures of 9/57 in that game would be considered the best in English conditions. The pacer bowled two maiden overs in 16.3 overs that he bowled. The pacer seaming length was difficult to handle for the South African batters.\n\n#8 Abdul Qadir \u2013 9/56 vs England in 1987 (Lahore)\n\nAbdul Qadir was at his best in this particular match. The off-spinner mixed his deliveries well and bowled as per every English batter\u2019s strength. He bowled quicker through the air and pitched the ball in the right areas. His line looked inch-perfect as he made the batters play on the back foot most of the time.\n\nAll time Bests List: Pakistani Fast Bowlers\n\n#7 Richard Hadlee \u2013 9/52 vs Australia in 1985 (Brisbane)\n\nThe legendary all-rounder looked unplayable with his outswingers and seaming deliveries on a wicket that aided seam bowling. Hadlee bowled a fine length and made the Aussies batsmen play forward. His figures of 9/52 will be remembered as one of the finest spells in Australia.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nHadlee swung the ball cleverly with the old ball as well as the new ball. Hadlee used the short ball cleverly as he landed the ball in the areas where he could get an uneven bounce.\n\n#6 Muttiah Muralitharan \u2013 9/51 vs Zimbabwe in 2002 (Kandy)\n\nKandy 2002.

Then this happened\u2026 ? pic.twitter.com/DzLotmx98o \u2014 Mainak Sinha??\ufe0f (@cric_archivist) December 4, 2021\n\nArguably one of the best spells bowled by the spin magician in his roller-coaster Test career. Muralitharan looked deadly with his spin, bounce, and accurate length.\n\nThe Zimbabwean batters looked helpless against him as they could hardly after any resistance against him. The off-spinner foxed the batters with his flight and enticed them to play forward. It was amazing to see how he added enough variations, even with the new ball.\n\n#5 Jim Laker \u2013 9/37 vs Australia in 1956 (Manchester)\n\nJim Laker, the first bowler in history to pick ten wickets in an innings, also bowled brilliantly in the first innings of the same match, claiming 9/37. He was consistent with his length and flighted the ball well. The straighter ones puzzled the Australian batters. Laker is known for using his wrong ones to good effect against the run of play, which was apparent in this particular spell.\n\nPicking 19 wickets overall in that game is the best bowling figure in a single Test match by any cricketer, till date. This also put him second in the list of bowlers who have picked the most wickets in a single bilateral Test series.\n\n#4 George Lohmann \u2013 9/28 vs South Africa in 1896 (Johannesburg)\n\n#OnThisDay in 1896, English bowler George Lohmann took remarkable figures of 9/28 against South Africa. He was the first cricketer to ever take nine wickets in a Test innings! pic.twitter.com/8p6QikcHXa \u2014 ICC (@ICC) March 3, 2018\n\nLohmann bowled tight lines in this game, hardly giving any chance to the South African batters. The medium pacer bowled 6 maiden overs and registered figures of 9/28 in just 14 overs. These figures would be considered the best by any English bowler on a South African wicket till now.\n\nHis economy rate of 2.33 that game while being rich at the wickets column ensured England didn\u2019t leak too many runs. England won this game by a huge margin of an innings and 197 runs, with Lohmann picking 12 wickets, both innings together.\n\n#3 Ajaz Patel \u2013 10/119 vs India in 2021 (Mumbai)\n\nThe second off-spinner and the only left-hander to claim ten wickets in a Test innings, Ajaz Patel made the Indian batters make mistakes while judging the length. He was accurate with his line and bowled the wrong ones to put the Indian batsmen in two minds. As a left-arm off-spinner, he did not hesitate to make the batters play forward, which made Indian wickets fall at regular intervals to him.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nThe slow left-arm orthodox bowler registered a spectacular figure of 10/119 in his 47.5 overs with an economy rate of 2.48. This is also the best bowling performance ever, coming in a losing cause for any team.\n\n#2 Anil Kumble \u2013 10/74 vs Pakistan in 1999 (Delhi)\n\nOn this day in 1999, Anil Kumble had the perfect innings.\n\n\n\nHe claimed all ten wickets in Pakistan's chase, pegging them back after a century opening stand. At the time, he was just the second player in Test bowling's most exclusive club. Since then, Ajaz Patel has joined him. pic.twitter.com/ZVAaayNoJP \u2014 Wisden (@WisdenCricket) February 7, 2022\n\nThis particular spell from Anil Kumble brought everyone to the edge of their seats. The legendary leg-spinner bowled brilliantly, constantly asking questions to the Pakistani batters.\n\n\u201cJumbo,\u201d as he is fondly called, adjusted his length as per a particular batsman\u2019s weakness. This was one of the best exhibitions of leg spin bowling. Kumble became only the second bowler to claim 10 wickets in an innings of a Test match. He bowled 26.3 overs, and in that 9 were maiden overs.\n\n#1 Jim Laker \u2013 10/53 vs Australia in 1956 (Manchester)\n\nLaker would be considered amongst the best off-spinner in English cricket. Very few matches were played during those days, so the bowlers had little idea about the opposition batters\u2019 weaknesses. Laker maintained tremendous consistency during that period.\n\nIn this match, the off-spinner turned the ball wonderfully and surprised the Australian batters with his faster ones. In 51.2 overs, he bowled 23 maiden overs with an economy rate of 1.03, which is outstanding. Laker also bowled quicker through the air and occasionally used the straighter ones.\n\nRead: The Best Bowling Figures of All Test-playing Nations"}, {"url": "https://www.cricindeed.com/best-bowling-figures-in-test-debut/", "page_content": "This article will discuss the top bowling performances of cricketers in their career Test debut matches.\n\nWe will divide this article into two:\n\nBest bowling figures in an innings on Test debut\n\nBest bowling figures in both innings of the debut Test match (combined bowling figure)\n\nBest Bowling Figures (Innings) by a Test Debutant\n\nThe best bowling figures in an innings by a Test debutant are presented below:\n\nSN BOWLER BEST BOWLING VS INNS VENUE YEAR 1 Albert Trott (AUS) 8/43 England 2 Adelaide 1895 2 Robert Massie (AUS) 8/53 England 2 Lord\u2019s 1972 3 Narendra Hirwani (IND) 8/61 West Indies 1 Chennai 1988 4 Lance Klusener (SA) 8/64 India 2 Eden Garden\u2019s 1996 5 Narendra Hirwani (IND) 8/75 West Indies 2 Chennai 1988 6 Robert Massie (AUS) 8/84 England 1 Lord\u2019s 1972 7 Alfred Valentine (WI) 8/104 England 1 Manchester 1950 8 Jason Krezja (AUS) 8/215 India 1 Nagpur 2008 9 Kyle Abbott (SA) 7/29 Pakistan 1 Centurion 2013 10 Dominic Cork (ENG) 7/43 West Indies 2 Lord\u2019s 1995 Top 5 Bowling Figures in an innings by Test Debutants\n\nKey Stats\n\nAlbert Trott\u2019s figures of 8/43 recorded in the 19th century is still the best bowling figures by a Test debutant in an innings.\n\nIndia\u2019s Narendra Hirwani and Australia\u2019s Robert Massie have featured twice in the above list by picking 8 wicket-hauls in both innings of their respective debut Test matches.

Here is the companion article: the Real Value of Test wickets.\n\nDespite the nomenclature, the Real Value of Runs is really the Real Value of Innings, since the innings is the basic measuring unit. There is no sensible way to measure the Real Value of individual runs. A run is a run, and it is not correct to say that a winning hit for runs has much more value than previous runs in that innings.\n\nThe bowling is cheese to the batting chalk. Each ball bowled is a harmless one - maybe a dot ball or a few runs being conceded - unless it results in a dismissal. That dismissal could be that of Don Bradman on 0 or Bhagwath Chandrasekhar on 22, it could be a second-ball dismissal of a top batter or a late-order wicket in a collapsing innings. Hence, it is essential that we determine the Real Value of a wicket using various related factors. We must treat the bowler's spell as a collection of balls delivered, runs conceded and wickets taken - unlike an innings by a batter that is evaluated in its entirety.\n\nThere is another angle here. A bowler may bowl upwards of 200 balls in an innings, and only a few (at most ten) of these are successful, resulting in the capture of a wicket. What about the other deliveries? The bowler has bowled at top batters, bowled to a plan, kept one end under control, and helped their team in different ways. That means that there are several other factors involved, such as the bowling average for the innings, the quality of batting, the match status, the result. The wicket could have been taken in Hamilton in 2002 (Runs per Wicket 14.1) or in Hamilton in 2004 (RpW 53.0). It could have been in a narrow win or in a dead draw. These wide-footprint values cannot be directly assigned to specific wickets but to the complete bowling effort in the innings (hereafter referred to as \"Innspell\"), and then we go down to the individual wickets.\n\nThe bowling exercise is thus substantially more complicated than the batting exercise. I may not provide explanations in full here, and the readers must assume that due care has been taken while building the methodology wherever details are missing.\n\nMy Bowler Performance analysis - Red Cherry 25 or RC25 - took the Bowling Innspell as the base unit and worked on that, while here I take the wicket as the base point. There may be many similarities between the two, but the premise is fundamentally different. Let us now move onward to the overall methodology.\n\nAt match level (max 25 pts)\n\nPitch Quality Index for Match-half or Match, as appropriate\n\nWickets taken in low-PQI situations (bowler-friendly pitches) are valued lower than wickets taken on batter-friendly pitches. Using historical data will not work in this regard; Hamilton and Headingley are two venues, among many, that have had wild swings in pitch behaviour within a short period of time.\n\nThe opposition Batting Strength\n\nBowling against a team with a high Batting Strength index is far more difficult than bowling to a team whose highest batting average is, say, around 30.\n\nLocation/Result/Relative Team Strengths\n\nI do not believe that winning is everything; however, winning should be rewarded. Similarly, drawing a match should get more credit than losing one. And bowlers win matches. Doing well away (winning or drawing) should be rewarded too. Three results, three locations and five strength-comparison indices lead to a complex matrix, and determine the points to be allotted to the team's bowlers.\n\nMatch Status\n\nThe Match Status at the start of the match is neutral, tweaked only by the Relative Team Strengths. Then, at the beginning of the second innings, the Match Status is wholly dependent on how many runs the team bowling second has behind them. The third innings presents more possibilities: the lead/deficit inherited and the sort of fourth-innings target to aim for play a significant part in determining the Status. In the fourth innings, bowling teams have defended anywhere between one run and 835 runs. Using the match-to-date RpW, the difficulty of the chasing task is calculated and Status points allotted. The points for each innings are determined after an analysis of all these conditions. The total is allotted to the bowlers in proportion to the wickets they took (80%) and the overs they bowled (20%). This is to give some recognition to those who bowled long spells, while keeping in mind the importance of taking wickets.\n\nCourtney Walsh's wicket of Craig McDermott in Adelaide in 1993, denying Australia a tie by one run, is worth 30 points, the most any one fourth-innings wicket can be worth under this analysis \u00a9 Getty Images\n\nAt Innspell level (max ten pts)\n\nWhat is the bowler average for the innings? That plays an important part in determining this value. In the recent Karachi Test, Mitchell Starc took 3 for 29 (9.67), Pat Cummins 1 for 39 (39.0) and Mitchell Swepson 2 for 32 (16.0) in the first innings. It is logical to allot the most points on this measure to Starc, fewest to Cummins and somewhere in between to Swepson.\n\nAt Wicket level (Batter-related: max 60 pts)\n\nA. Which batter was dismissed? (25 pts)\n\nHere I use the Career-to-Date Location Average to get a clear indication of the quality of the wicket. I assign 25% weightage to Recent Form (RF10) - that is, the average in the batter's last ten innings. Kumar Sangakkara (RF10 Ave=118), Garry Sobers (112), Viv Richards (109) and Alastair Cook (110) returned Bradmanesque averages during their peaks, and bowlers' dismissals of such batters should be rewarded.\n\nB. At what score was the batter dismissed? (25 pts)\n\nDismissing Bradman on 152 is an achievement and should help the bowling team. However, dismissing Bradman on 0 is magical, making a huge difference to the bowling team's fortunes. To qualify for these points, the batter must be dismissed at or below the CTD Location Ave-RF value, used in parameter A.\n\nC. Partnership preventer (10 pts)\n\nThis is a special measure that recognises bowlers who did not allow a partnership to develop. Using the batting team's RpW as the base, I allocate a maximum of ten points, depending on the partnership that was formed. The allotted maximum value comes down as we move forward in the innings. By definition, this measure rewards all quick wickets in the opening spell. For example, the three wickets taken by Irfan Pathan in his opening-over hat-trick against Pakistan in Karachi in 2005-06 get 10.0 points each. An interesting fact emerges when we look at the summary of this measure: the average for fast bowlers is 3.24 per wicket, while for spinners it is 2.68.\n\nAt Innings Status level (Inns 1-3: 15 pts; Inns 4: 30 pts)\n\nWhat is the target? What is the score? How many wickets are left? These are the questions used in the Innings Status, determining the points allotted to each wicket. The first three innings are treated differently from the fourth innings. It should be recognised that the moment before Courtney Walsh dismissed Craig McDermott in Adelaide in 1992-93, the score was 184 for 9 and Australia were one run away from tying the match. There is no other comparable situation in Test history. So this wicket is allotted 30 points, the maximum possible.\n\nLet us now move on to a schematic of the process. The article is current up to and including the recent Trent Bridge Test between England and New Zealand.\n\n\u00a9 Anantha Narayanan\n\nThe four match-level measures are determined, summed up and allotted to each wicket equally. The highest score on this measure is 23.8 out of 25.\n\nThe Innspell value is determined and then allotted to each wicket.\n\nThe three wicket-level values are determined and allotted to the wickets. The highest for the Batter Score measure is 22.7 points and for the Batter Dismissed measure it is 21.1 - both for the wicket of Bradman in separate instances. In the Partnership Preventer measure, wickets of batters dismissed at 0 and no partnership runs are allotted the maximum of 10.0 points.\n\nThen the innings situations are analysed and status values allotted. The maximum values achieved for the four innings are 12.5, 11.8, 13.8 and 30.0 respectively.\n\nA sum of all these values leads to a figure between 10.0 and 73.43 for the 73,644 Test wickets taken in cricket history. This is then mapped on to a value between 0.500 and 1.905, which becomes the Wicket Quality Index (WQI). The WQI average for the 73,644 wickets is 0.995, confirming that the spread is almost perfect. However, the average WQI for pace bowlers is about 2% above par and for spinners about 3% below par. The main reason for this is that pace bowlers tend to take early wickets and spinners tend to need to plan for their wickets, which takes time. Hence, while converting the interim points total to WQI, minor tweaks are applied for all the wickets. In the final reckoning, pace bowlers took 49,832 wickets at an average WQI of 1.001 and spinners 23,803 wickets at 0.982. The distribution of WQI values is below.\n\n\u00a9 Anantha Narayanan\n\nNote how symmetric the distribution of the WQI values is. Only the 1.20 to 1.30 range is slightly off. The highest frequency is at the 1.00-1.05 group, and the extreme groups have very low values. As mentioned, the mean is 0.995. The standard deviation is 0.198, and the coefficient of variation is a very acceptable 0.199.\n\n\u00a9 Anantha Narayanan\n\nThe table above gives us an idea of how the WQI values have been distributed across the four innings. The WQI average is slightly below 1.00 in the first two innings and just above 1.00 in the latter two. This is understandable, since wickets get to be more valuable heading towards the end of the match. Third-innings wickets are the most valuable, since the match is still in the balance then. In the fourth innings, quite a few wickets are inconsequential, in wins by big runs or by upwards of five wickets.\n\nThe first table below is arguably the most important. It lists the top wickets of all time by WQI value. Readers might expect the table to be dominated by Bradman dismissals. But Bradman too had his lows in CTD values, and he went gone through an RF average of around 40 just after the Bodyline series. This means that there is good representation all around.\n\n\u00a9 Anantha Narayanan\n\nThe top wicket of all time is the dismissal of Bradman by Hedley Verity at Lord's in the 1934 Ashes. Australia, after following on, were 43 for 1 when Bradman walked in and was subsequently dismissed for 13. Australia were in deficit by only 113 runs at the time, making the dismissal a crucial one. A target of 150 would have been tough to chase. Close behind comes another Bradman dismissal, this time by Bill Voce in Australia's first innings in Sydney in 1936. Coming in at 1 for 1, Bradman was dismissed first ball. England won by an innings.\n\nThird is a modern dismissal, from Edgbaston in the 2005 Ashes. Australia, chasing 282, had Adam Gilchrist arriving at 134 for 5 and Ashley Giles dismissing him for 1. Though Australia recovered, they lost the match by two runs. Quite close to this comes the opening-day dismissal of Everton Weekes in Kingston in 1953-54. Weekes was on a roll, with CTD and RF values well over 70. Trevor Bailey's dismissal of him for 0 eventually led to a comfortable win for England.\n\nFifty years later, in Kingston, after two 300-plus innings totals, Brian Lara walked in at 15 for 3 and was dismissed immediately by Matthew Hoggard. West Indies were bushwhacked for 47 and England won comfortably. The next four dismissals are those of Bradman by Dick Pollard for 7 in a drawn match, of Bradman by Vijay Hazare for 13 in a draw at the SCG, of Sobers, with a high CTD average, for 0 by Fred Trueman, and of Bradman by Neville Quinn for 2 on the opening day in Melbourne in 1931 (albeit in a match Quinn's team, South Africa, lost).\n\n\u00a9 Anantha Narayanan\n\nThe best fourth-innings wicket was Giles' dismissal of Gilchrist, as we have already seen. However, in the table above, I look at those fourth-innings wickets that were primarily responsible for close wins. This table is ordered on the fourth-innings Status points. Of course, if a top batter were to be dismissed at 190 for 9 with a couple of runs needed to win, that wicket would have topped the previous chart. But that has never happened. Most of these wickets are of late-order batters.\n\nThe best wicket at the end of the fourth innings was that of McDermott, who was dismissed when a single was needed to tie. It is the only wicket to score a maximum 30 points on this parameter. The second wicket is that of Michael Kasprowicz by Steve Harmison (was it out at all?) in the 2005 Ashes classic at Edgbaston. This is followed by three wickets taken when three runs were needed to tie in each case: the first is the wicket of Jeff Thomson by Ian Botham in Melbourne in 1982, and the next two are from the famous 1902 Old Trafford Ashes Test.\n\nIn sixth place comes the first top-order wicket - No. 3 Azhar Ali's dismissal by Ajaz Patel. New Zealand won that pulsating Abu Dhabi Test against Pakistan in 2019; Ajaz also features on the table with the previous wicket of the innings, Hasan Ali's.\n\n\u00a9 Anantha Narayanan\n\nAbove is the table of top Innspells - from an aggregate WQI point of view. The list does not feature Anil Kumble's and Ajaz's ten-wicket hauls, but it does contain quite a few eight-wicket hauls. This is owing to the combination of factors that go towards constituting the WQI: the quality of batters, the timing of the dismissals, the innings patterns, the result, the margin, the location.\n\nThe two Jim Laker performances at Old Trafford in 1956 bookend the 1994 Devon Malcolm masterclass, when he tore through a strong South African line-up and secured a great win at The Oval. Then comes Stuart Broad's Trent Bridge pre-lunch blitz in 2015 against Australia, followed by Richard Hadlee's famous effort in Brisbane in 1985 - the top-rated RC25 performance. No surprises among the performances that follow. The only interesting point is that the top 15 contains only one effort in a drawn Test - Glenn McGrath's at Lord's in 1997.\n\n\u00a9 Anantha Narayanan\n\nThis table, along with the next, represents the most devastating bowling performances in history. They look at the top Innspells, but from an average - rather than aggregate - WQI point of view. The first table has a four-wickets-minimum cut-off. Let us go back to the SCG in 1936. After a good England score, a strong Australia side started their innings on a pitch transformed by a thunderstorm. Voce dismissed Leo O'Brien for 0, Bradman for 0 (a second consecutive duck), Stan McCabe for 0, and Jack Fingleton for 12, and the score was 16 for 4. For some reason Voce bowled only eight overs, and finished with 4 for 10. This Innspell averaged 1.605 on WQI.\n\nIn the first tied Test, in Brisbane in 1960, Wes Hall dismissed Bob Simpson for 0, Neil Harvey for 5, Norman O'Neill for 26, Les Favell for 7, and finally took the key wicket of Richie Benaud. In Kingston in 2009, England took the field trailing by only 74 runs. A few hours later they went down to an innings loss, having been dismissed for 51. Jerome Taylor took five top-order wickets for single figures, averaging 1.55 on the WQI.\n\nMohammad Asif's four top wickets in Kandy in 2005-06 and Cummins' effort in the Indian capitulation of 36 in Adelaide in 2020-21 follow next - separated by 0.003 on the WQI.\n\n\u00a9 Anantha Narayanan\n\nThis table recognises top Innspells of six wickets or more, ordered, again, by the average WQI. The list is topped by Broad's demolition of South Africa at the Wanderers in 2015-16. He dismissed the top six batters for 17 and averaged 1.45 on the WQI. Broad also has the sixth-placed performance on this table, with his opening-day show against Australia in Nottingham in 2015 - his 8 for 15 averaged 1.38 on the WQI.\n\nIn second place is Ebadot Hossain's very recent 6 for 46, which resulted in one of the most amazing upsets ever - Bangladesh over New Zealand, away. In third place is Fazal Mahmood's famous six wickets against West Indies in Dacca in 1958-59. Next comes Lance Gibbs' marathon effort against England in Georgetown in 1967-68, which almost secured a win for West Indies, followed by Muthiah Muralidaran's third-innings destruction of India (in the company of Ajantha Mendis) in 2008.\n\nFive of these performances are within a range of 0.2 of each other on the WQI. The last performance on the table, Hugh Tayfield's valiant 7 for 23 in Durban in 1949-50, is the only one by a bowler ending on the losing side; Neil Harvey's magnificent unbeaten 151 carried Australia through in a memorable chase there.\n\n\u00a9 Anantha Narayanan\n\nThis table considers the leading performances by average WQI performance - at a match level. The cut-off criteria are a minimum of five match wickets, and at least two in an innings. Neil Hawke took six wickets in the match in Port-of-Spain in 1964-65, all of top-order batters (Conrad Hunte, Bryan Davis twice, Rohan Kanhai, Basil Butcher and Seymour Nurse) for single figures. His WQI average was a stunning 1.44. Suranga Lakmal's five wickets, away in Bridgetown in 2018, were similar. Among Sydney Barnes' eight victims in Melbourne in 1911-12 six were top-order batters. All five of Danny Morrison's wickets against Sri Lanka in Wellington in 1990-91 were from the top seven. Voce's first-innings effort in Sydney has already been chronicled; in the second innings, he took two other top wickets out of three.\n\n\u00a9 Anantha Narayanan\n\nNow for career performances. I have organised this data in two tables: the first one for bowlers who took between 100 and 200 career wickets, the second one for those who took over 200.\n\nEngland's early 20th-century left-arm spinner Colin Blythe averaged nearly 1.1 on the WQI for his 100 wickets and leads the table. Pathan, who too just about reached 100 wickets, is next, with an average WQI value of 1.08: across his career he took many top-order wickets. Mohammad Asif, despite having a short career, had an excellent one as far as quality of wickets was concerned, and he is just a decimal point away from Pathan. Alan Davidson, known for his incisive and economical spells at the beginning of innings, comes in next.\n\nThere is a decent representation of spinners here, with five in the top 15, led by Laker in fifth place.\n\nThe value in the last column is the percentage of high-WQI-value wickets in the bowler's overall tally. Fazal Mahmood is the only bowler who has more than 10% such wickets. Asif is close with 9.4%.\n\n\u00a9 Anantha Narayanan\n\nThe table for bowlers with over 200 wickets is led by McGrath. Vernon Philander is only a fraction away. Then come Malcolm Marshall, Ray Lindwall, and a surprise in the form of Andrew Caddick. The top ten is a who's who of fast bowlers.\n\nTo provide additional information, I have listed five high wicket-takers who missed out on the top ten. Shane Warne, James Anderson and Broad have WQI averages higher than 1.02, while Courtney Walsh and Murali just about break even. Murali took a lot of late-order wickets. Kumble has an average WQI value of around 0.99. Overall, spinners find it difficult to get on to the table. Ravindra Jadeja is the highest-placed spinner, in 14th place, with an average WQI of 1.037.\n\nMcGrath took 563 wickets in his Test career. Of these, 142 (25%) were late-order wickets. Most of these wickets would have had WQIs between 0.7 and 0.9. He made up for this with high WQI values for the top- and middle-order wickets he took, to achieve the relatively high value of 7.5% for wickets with WQI values above 1.4. Lindwall tops on this count, with 8.3% of his wickets being such high-value ones.\n\n\u00a9 Anantha Narayanan\n\nThis is a special table that lists teams that did well on the WQI front in a particular innings. At the top is South Africa's dismissal of Australia for 47 in 2011-12 in Cape Town. They secured 14.53 points there. The first eight Australia batters scored in single figures, totalling 21 runs between them. The second place is secured by West Indies in the 51-run demolition of England that we encountered earlier. Also here is the Broad match at Trent Bridge: England aggregated 13.86 in that steamrolling of Australia. The one relatively high score in in the top five is Australia's dismissal for 169 of the strong Indian team in Bangalore in 1998. The two 400-plus first-innings totals certainly helped to increase the WQI values in the match.\n\n\u00a9 Anantha Narayanan\n\nFinally, a table of the best ten-Test streaks from the point of view of average WQI. England left-arm spinner Tony Lock leads here. In a ten-Test streak in the mid-1950s, he took 42 wickets at an average WQI of 1.17. He looked more the English destroyer than Laker during this period, although Old Trafford 1956 changed all that. In second place is McGrath, with 35 wickets at an average of 1.166, though he did not playing in quite a few Tests in that period in the early 2000s. He returned a low number of wickets but most were key wickets.\n\nPakistan left-arm spinner Iqbal Qasim follows close behind, and his streak includes the famous 1987 Bangalore Test, won narrowly by Pakistan. A hair's breadth behind is Broad, whose streak in 2015-16 fetched him 39 wickets. All his matches were against strong teams, and included the 6 for 17 already discussed. Barnes took an astonishing 69 wickets in a ten-Test streak in 1911-12.\n\nConclusion\n\nViewed from one angle, Walsh's dismissal of McDermott in Adelaide could be termed the greatest wicket of all - one run needed to tie the match. However, the fact that McDermott was a lower-order batter prevents me from saying this. If the batter had been Allan Border, I would probably anoint that wicket as the greatest of all. As such, I would say that any Bradman dismissal for a low score - such as Verity's and Voce's - resulting in a win for the other team should qualify for this distinction. Note that a few other low-score dismissals of Bradman - such as Quinn's, Alec Bedser's and Eric Hollies' - did not stop Australia from winning comfortably. Hollies made sure that generations of cricket analysts, myself included, did not need to set a six-character limit for career batting average, and that the number 99.94 attained mythical prominence - but that match was virtually won by Australia before Bradman even padded up.\n\nIn general, spinners have found it a little difficult to gain high WQI values. They take their time and bowl more balls per wicket, whereas fast bowlers have the first bite of the cherry - their early strikes are necessary to keep the batting team on the back foot, and so they gain their marginal benefit in the values.\n\nWhat about Warne's \"ball of the century\" (although I do not think it was)? That dismissal of Mike Gatting scored quite highly: 1.36 WQI points. However, as far as the analysis goes, the next wicket, of Robin Smith, received 1.47 WQI points. The reason is simple. Both were quick wickets to follow earlier wickets. But at the time Smith was a far better batter than Gatting - Career-to-Date average of 47 vs 35, and Recent Form average of 43 vs 29. Unfortunately, the WQI cannot capture the turn imparted - according to some pundits, close to three feet in the case of the Gatting delivery.\n\nAnantha Narayanan has written for ESPNcricinfo and CastrolCricket and worked with a number of companies on their cricket performance ratings-related systems\n\n\u00a9 ESPN Sports Media Ltd."}]}
