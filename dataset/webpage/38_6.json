As stated by The Weeknd himself, the album is a direct sequel to his fourth studio album After Hours which had been released almost two years prior.\n\nThe album is formatted conceptually as a radio program, hence its title, with Jim Carrey acting as the host having multiple spoken-word interludes throughout. Interestingly, The Weeknd does have his own radio show on Beats 1 called \u201cMemento Mori,\u201d which first began in 2018 and was used to promote the album in the months leading up to its release.\n\nAbel first teased new music in a Rolling Stone cover piece, where he said:\n\nI might have another album ready to go by the time this quarantine is over. I\u2019m guilty of wanting to outdo my last album.\n\nHe continued to tease new music in a series of cryptic tweets on April 27, 2021. In an interview with Variety on May 4, 2021, Abel said:\n\nIf the last record is the after hours of the night, then the dawn is coming.\n\nHe also wrote \u201cthe dawn is coming\u2026\u201d in an Instagram post on May 13, 2021, and then tweeted the same phrase on July 7, 2021. On July 13, 2021, he confirmed that there is an album and that it is almost done in another series of tweets, also stating that he is \u201creally proud\u201d of it.\n\nOn August 2, 2021, a few days after deleting all of his posts on Instagram, he announced that the era was starting that night and then posted the snippet of a song. A cover interview with GQ was also released that day, where Abel said \u201cIt\u2019s the album I\u2019ve always wanted to make.\u201c The following day, Abel announced that the song would be releasing that Friday.\n\nOn August 6, 2021, the promotional single, \u201cTake My Breath,\u201d was released along with a music video. Three days later, the extended version which would eventually be the version that appears on the album, was released.\n\nOn October 5, 2021, during a new episode of his radio show \u201cMemento Mori\u201d, The Weeknd revealed that the record would have \u201cexciting\u201d features (which he referred to as \u201ccharacters\u201d) and that they would be \u201cessential to the story\u201d of the album. He also confirmed that he had completed the project and was only missing a few things.\n\nThe album\u2019s final release date was announced four days before its release, on January 3, 2022. The official artwork was revealed the next day, on January 4.\n\nOn January 5, 2022, the official tracklist for the album was released."}, {"url": "https://genius.com/artists/The-weeknd", "page_content": "About The Weeknd\n\nAbel Makkonen Tesfaye (born February 16, 1990 in Scarborough, Ontario), popularly known as The Weeknd, is an R&B/pop/hip-hop singer-songwriter and record producer from Toronto, Canada. He has been referred to as the songbird of his generation and the best musical talent since Michael Jackson throughout his career.\n\nThe Weeknd gained widespread critical acclaim for his three mixtapes, House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence, which he later compiled to make a remastered, three-disc album titled Trilogy after signing his record deal with Republic. In 2013, he released Kiss Land, which was considered to be his debut studio album.\n\nIn 2014, he dropped \u201cOften,\u201d a remix of Beyonce\u2019s \u201cDrunk In Love,\u201d and \u201cKing of the Fall.\u201d The Weeknd released two songs in collaboration with the film Fifty Shades of Grey, with \u201cEarned It\u201d becoming his solo breakout hit.\n\nHis second studio album became highly-anticipated, with riveting singles like \u201cThe Hills\u201d and \u201cCan\u2019t Feel My Face\u201d leaving fans hungry for more. Beauty Behind the Madness was released on August 28, 2015.\n\nHis third studio album, Starboy, was released on November 25, 2016. The Daft Punk-assisted title track led the project as its first official single, released on Wednesday, September 21, 2016, before becoming his third number one track in the United States, as also his home country, Canada.\n\nThe effort was a commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 albums chart with over 348,000 copies sold in its first week, all eighteen tracks debuting on the Billboard Hot 100, receiving a GRAMMY Award for the Best Urban Contemporary Album category at the 60th annual ceremony, overall for the second time in his music career and being ranked as the third most popular album of 2017 in the U.S.\n\nHis follow-up EP, My Dear Melancholy,, released on March 30, 2018 includes themes revolving around his breakups with Bella Hadid during summer of 2016 and Selena Gomez in October 2017, respectively. With the lead single, \u201cCall Out My Name\u201d, the Canadian singer earned the largest first-day Spotify stream count of any song released in 2018 at that time and his eighth Top 10 entry on Hot 100.\n\nTesfaye\u2019s fourth studio album (and his first in three years), After Hours was officially released on March 20, 2020, and is named after a 1985 movie directed by his idol, Martin Scorsese. It was primarily supported by November 2019-released singles \u201cHeartless\u201d and \u201cBlinding Lights,\u201d with the pair becoming his fourth and fifth #1 singles in the US and the latter his first #1 single in the UK. The successful promotional title track and \u201cIn Your Eyes\u201d were also released as singles.\n\nOn February 5, 2021, Tesfaye released the compilation album The Highlights. The is his second greatest hits album since Trilogy. The album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 and became his highest charting compilation album."}, {"url": "https://genius.com/Jubel-weekend-vibe-lyrics", "page_content": "4 Contributors Weekend Vibe Lyrics\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nI move my feet to reach that sun\n\nWhere our emotions blur into shapes and forms\n\nOn Ocean Drive, Miami Beach\n\nWe call it paradise, so the only place that we need\n\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\nOh, yeah\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh\n\nSkip the Monday and Tuesday, right\n\nI wanna stay in that weekend vibe\n\nOh, yeah\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh\n\nYeah, lose your body and feel alright\n\n'Cause we just wanna have weekend vibes\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh\n\nKeep us dancin' or groovin'\n\nI wanna stay in that weekend vibe\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh\n\nLose your body and feel alright\n\n'Cause we just wanna have weekend vibes\n\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nLet's wrap it up, accelerate\n\n'Cause workin' nine-to-five, it won't mak\u0435 us celebrate\n\nA b\u0435atin' drum under the sun\n\nLet's catch a wave and take a trip to higher grounds\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\nOh, yeah\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh\n\nSkip the Monday and Tuesday, right\n\nI wanna stay in that weekend vibe\n\nOh, yeah\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh\n\nYeah, lose your body and feel alright\n\n'Cause we just wanna have weekend vibes\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh\n\nKeep us dancin' or groovin'\n\nI wanna stay in that weekend vibe\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh\n\nLose your body and feel alright\n\n'Cause we just wanna have weekend vibes\n\n\n\n[Bridge]\n\nWhen I feel low, you get me high\n\nSo high, so high\n\nWhen darkness come, you make it shine\n\nSo bright, so bright\n\nWhen I feel low, you get me high\n\nSo high, so high\n\nI just want, I just want\n\nI just want that weekend vibe\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh\n\nKeep us dancin' or groovin'\n\nI wanna stay in that weekend vibe\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh\n\nLose your body and feel alright\n\n'Cause we just wanna have weekend vibes\n\n(Come on)\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh\n\nKeep us dancin' or groovin'\n\nI wanna stay in that weekend vibe\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh\n\nLose your body and feel alright\n\n'Cause we just wanna have weekend vibes"}, {"url": "https://genius.com/Kranium-vibes-weekend-lyrics", "page_content": "1 Contributor Vibes Weekend Lyrics\n\n[Intro]\n\nNo commoners\n\nBare hot gyal we par with, we par with\n\nAye\n\nGhetto youths fuck the hottest gyal a road\n\nThat them fi know\n\nBare hot gyal we par with\n\n\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nBuck a gyal from Uptown\n\nSkin clean, mixed genes\n\nShe have a crush 'pon the don since '17\n\nSay she like badman, a make she feel safe\n\nShe never know nothing 'bout love, now she get older\n\nSay she want ride in a me pull-over\n\nTwo a we never sober\n\nSame time she bend over\n\nMe never have condom\n\nMe fuck it raw and done\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nWeh you thinking?\n\nWhat you drinking then?\n\nWe a go a Sandz fi the whole weekend\n\nVibes whole night, a forget problem\n\nWhole team out and a stunt 'pon them\n\nWhat you drinking then?
