Although an abstinence pledge had been introduced by churches as early as 1800, the earliest temperance organizations seem to have been those founded at Saratoga, New York, in 1808 and in Massachusetts in 1813. The movement spread rapidly under the influence of the churches; by 1833 there were 6,000 local societies in several U.S. states.\n\nSome temperance advocates, notably Carry Nation, worked to great effect outside the organized movement. The earliest European organizations were formed in Ireland; the movement began to make effective progress in 1829 with the formation of the Ulster Temperance Society. Thereafter, the movement spread throughout Ireland and to Great Britain. The Church of England Temperance Society was founded in 1862 and reconstituted in 1873. In 1969 it was united with the National Police Court Mission to form the Church of England Council for Social Aid. On the continent, the earliest temperance organizations seem to have been in existence in Norway and Sweden in 1836 and 1837.\n\nMore From Britannica Prohibition: The temperance movement and the Eighteenth Amendment\n\nTemperance and abstinence became the objects of education and legislation in many regions. Besides combining moral and political action, the modern temperance movements were characterized by international scope and the organized cooperation of women. The first international temperance organization appears to have been the Order of Good Templars (formed in 1851 at Utica, New York), which gradually spread over the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Scandinavia, several other European countries, Australasia, India, parts of Africa, and South America. In 1909 a world prohibition conference in London resulted in the foundation of an International Prohibition Confederation.\n\nA U.S. organization that became international was the national Woman\u2019s Christian Temperance Union, founded in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1874. The WCTU employed educational and social as well as political means in promoting legislation. During the 1880s the organization spread to other lands, and in 1883 the World\u2019s Woman\u2019s Christian Temperance Union was formed. See also prohibition."}, {"url": "https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-temperance-movement-definition-leaders-timeline.html", "page_content": "Groups like the WCTU advocated for a ban on all alcohol in the U.S.\n\nWhat were Their Beliefs?\n\nEarly members of the temperance movement were frustrated with the British Parliament's refusal to allow members of the working class the right to vote. As a result, the temperance movement adopted a rather strong opposition to alcohol consumption, known as teetotalism. From their perspective, the temperance movement believed that if the working class could demonstrate an ability to behave responsibly and avoid drinking alcohol, they would be given the right to vote.\n\nIn the United States, members of the temperance movement spent the later part of the 19th century and early part of the 20th century speaking out against alcohol consumption from a strong Christian perspective. For example, members of the Women's Christian Temperance Union believed that the consumption of alcohol led men to become violent and destructive members of society.\n\nLeaders of the Temperance Movement\n\nThe temperance movement was motivated by very strong beliefs that were often intolerant of oppositional or other points of view. Given that, it will probably come as no surprise that leaders of the movement had extreme perspectives on other areas of public life.\n\nWilliam Anderson, for example, was an important lobbyist from the Anti-Saloon League, who often resorted to starting rumors and forging documents in order to gain support for the cause of prohibition. Additionally, it was not uncommon for Anderson to resort to racist propaganda that associated the use of alcohol with 'the unwashed and wild-eyed foreigners who have no comprehension of the spirit of America.'\n\nThough William Anderson relied on several underhanded or reprehensible tactics, he was nothing compared to another temperance leader by the name of Carrie Nation. As a profoundly conservative Christian and unyielding advocate of prohibition, Carrie Nation spent much of her time harassing bar owners or patrons for 'destroying' men's souls. In early 1900, Nation, believing she had been chosen by God to spread a message of temperance, began carrying an axe, which she would use to threaten those who opposed her.\n\nCarrie Nation wielded an axe to threaten opposition to her cause\n\nCarrie Nation's methods and perspectives are extreme by any standards, but their origins might make her somewhat easier to understand. Following her work as nurse during the Civil War, she fell in love with and married a Union army doctor named Charles Gloyd. However, their short-lived marriage ended in divorce two years later, due to Gloyd's alcoholism. As a result of this disappointment, Carrie Nation developed a passionate dislike for alcoholism, which was motivated by her own experience."}, {"url": "https://study.com/learn/lesson/the-temperance-movement-history-leaders-timeline.html", "page_content": "The Temperance Movement: History\n\nThe temperance movement has a long history stretching back into the early part of the nineteenth century. Temperance as an ideal had been a priority in Protestantism long before. For instance, since 1800, churches, especially Protestant denominations, had encouraged temperance or abstinence from alcohol by individuals. Disturbed by the widespread harm that alcoholism did to individuals and families, they promoted abstinence pledges which were signed by the members of their congregations.\n\nTemperance movement leaders include Carrie Nation, who carried a hatchet and threatened those who opposed her, and Frances Wheeler, Howard Hyde Russell, and Wayne Wheeler. These last three individuals will be discussed more below.\n\nWhat Caused the Temperance Movement?\n\nTemperance movement members believed that individuals and families were destroyed by the influence of alcohol. Factory workers were a significant subgroup of society that was damaged by alcohol. Their employers lamented that intoxication in their factories increased safety concerns and had drastic, negative impacts on productivity.\n\nTemperance organizations did not solely fight for temperance, however. Many of these organizations were mostly made up of women, and so they fought for political issues that women desired to have a say in, such as women's suffrage.\n\nInfluence of Protestant Christianity\n\nThe temperance movement was heavily influenced by Protestant Christianity. One of the main tenets of many Protestant religious groups was that Christians had an obligation to work toward the betterment of the general society. Thus, half of the motivation of the members of the temperance organizations was a desire to protect Christian morals in the face of the evils of alcohol. Christian-based movements spread more successfully than secular-based movements. For example, the Women's Christian Temperance Union was one of the first temperance organizations to become an international organization.\n\nSecond Great Awakening\n\nThe Second Great Awakening was a massive religious revivalist Protestant movement that revitalized Christian feeling in what became known as the ''Burned-Over District.'' As part of this dramatic surge of Christian feeling, adherents sought to purge society from any evil influences, including ''demon rum,'' in an efforts to promote attendance at local churches. Traveling preachers set up ''revivals''\n\nGroups that Supported the Temperance Movement\n\nGroups that supported the temperance movement mostly include Protestant groups in rural areas around the country, but other societal groups that also furthered its goals:\n\nAmerican Temperance Society\n\nWomen's Christian Temperance Union\n\nAnti-Saloon League\n\nBusiness owners\n\nMethodist religious movement\n\nGrowth and Development\n\nThe movement grew increasingly after the 1860s. The movement became very political during this period. The Women's Christian Temperance Union engaged in educational and social endeavors but also fought for political legislation. Temperance activists used songs, mass media, ''scientific'' pamphlets (many of which used unscientific misinformation), and religious pamphlets and sermons to further their goals.\n\nSuccess\n\nThe success of the temperance movement was mostly local, with the passage of state laws promoting temperance during the nineteenth century. Eventually, the effects of the temperance movement reached the federal level with the passage of the Volstead Act and the Eighteenth Amendment around 1920.\n\nTemperance Movement: Leaders and Organizations\n\nWho led the temperance movement? Many organizations and leaders led the movement during the nineteenth century and early twentieth century.\n\nThe Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU)\n\nThe Women's Christian Temperance Union was created in 1874 in Cleveland, Ohio. Its members were desirous to promote temperance or teetotalism as part of wider efforts to improve society, including educational and societal reform.\n\nThe WCTU differed from previous temperance organizations in several significant ways. They connected temperance with chastity, prudence, and other Christian virtues. Previous temperance groups had largely been focused on temperance as an isolated goal. By combining temperance with other virtues into a Christian lifestyle model, the WCTU figured that temperance would be achieved swiftly. The WCTU also sought political solutions rather than simply relying on individuals and communities to police themselves.\n\nFrancis Willard was the second president of the WCTU.\n\nFrancis Willard was the second president of the WCTU. Under her direction, the WCTU became one of the largest women's religious groups in the nineteenth century. She also expanded the efforts of WCTU to include legal and political actions. Her personal priorities included women's rights, suffrage, and other social reform. Her efforts to educate members of society stemmed from her personal paradigm that regarded alcoholics as people who were psychologically unstable. Temperance, or teetotalism, would improve their mental well-being. Education and other means of improving the lives of alcoholics would lead to the cessation of their reliance on alcohol.\n\nThe WCTU could not support dealing with a plethora of initiatives, and it was not able to achieve most of its goals, with the exception of public education initiatives. As the WCTU weakened, Willard sought other avenues to achieve its goals. In 1889, she became the first president of the National Council of Women.\n\nThe Anti-Saloon League\n\nThe Anti-Saloon League was one of the first modern lobbying groups. Unlike previous temperance organizations, it was founded by men, who made up the vast majority of its members. It also focused solely on prohibition rather than lobbying concurrently for related issues like the WCTU. William Anderson was a prominent lobbyist for the ASL.\n\nHoward Hyde Russell\n\nRussell was the founder of the Anti-Saloon League. His motivations were mostly religious, as he was a minister. He formed the league using his personal network of Christian ministers. Other Christian organizations and politicians soon joined the league.\n\nWayne Wheeler\n\nWayne Wheeler was a proponent of the temperance movement and a leader of the Anti-Saloon League.\n\nWheeler used ''pressure politics'' to achieve the Anti-Saloon League's goals. He used various tactics to convince politicians that political measures to enforce prohibition and temperance were demanded by the public. For instance, he inundated the legal system with a flood of lawsuits related to alcohol and temperance."}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/temperance-movement", "page_content": "Hillhurst Presbyterian Sunday school group, Calgary, c 1912-16.\n\nTemperance Societies\n\nThe first temperance societies in Canada appeared around 1827 in Pictou County, Nova Scotia, and in Montreal. The groups initially tolerated moderate use of beer and wine. This concession continued in Quebec; but it soon gave way in the rest of the country to calls for total prohibition of all alcohol. Groups that promoted temperance, abstinence and prohibition were all commonly referred to as temperance groups.\n\nTemperance activists and their allies believed that alcohol, especially hard liquor, was an obstacle to economic success; to social cohesion; and to moral and religious purity. The Temperance struggle was connected to other reform efforts of the time, such as the women\u2019s suffrage movement. It was also motivated in part by Social Gospel beliefs.\n\nAround 1848, the Sons of Temperance lodge, a fraternal and prohibitionist society, reached Canada from the United States. Other such lodges were the Royal Templars of Temperance and the International Order of Good Templars. The most important temperance society for women was the Woman\u2019s Christian Temperance Union, an American group. Its Canadian counterpart was founded in 1874 by Letitia Youmans of Picton, Ontario. It was one of the few organizations through which women could play a political role.\n\nIn 1875, the hundreds of societies, lodges and church groups committed to prohibition met in Montreal to form a federation. It was called the Dominion Prohibitory Council. A year later, it was renamed the Dominion Alliance for the Total Suppression of the Liquor Traffic. It became the major organizing force for prohibition campaigns in Canada. The predominantly English-speaking, Protestant alliance discouraged francophone and Catholic participation. Catholics, particularly francophone Catholics, saw prohibition as an extreme measure. La Ligue Anti-alco\u00f6lique was formed in 1906 as a French-language counterpart of the Dominion Alliance. It supported legal restriction of the liquor trade, but not full prohibition.\n\nWCTU annual report, containing Nellie McClung's signature, 1890\u0434\u0443\u044191.\n\nBanning Alcohol by Vote\n\nJurisdiction over the liquor trade was shared by governments. (See Distribution of Powers.) The provinces could prohibit retail sale. The federal government could ban the manufacturing of alcohol as well as retail, wholesale and interprovincial trade.\n\nHowever, governments at neither level were enthusiastic about prohibition, since it would cause a loss of tax revenue and party support. Both levels put forward compromise legislation known as \u201clocal options.\u201d Local governments were allowed to hold popular votes to create laws on contentious issues in their areas. The process was enshrined in the Canada Temperance Act of 1878, also known as the Scott Act. It gave local governments the right to hold votes to ban the sale of alcohol. A side effect was to give prohibitionists political experience, through organizing local-option and referenda campaigns. Prohibitionists secured a major victory in 1901 when Prince Edward Island outlawed the retail sale of alcohol.\n\n1893 Petition by Woman\u2019s Christian Temperance Union (courtesy Archives of Manitoba, LA 0009 Sessional Papers, GR0247, 32 Petition of A.M. Blakely et al [from Woman\u2019s Christian Temperance Union] re: Franchise for Women, 1893, G 7173).\n\nProhibition as a War Measure\n\nWhen the First World War broke out, the temperance movement was close to its peak. Alcohol consumption, though beginning to rise after a half century of decline, was relatively low; organization and funding for the movement were substantial; and local governments widely banned alcohol through local-option votes. At the start of the war, the Dominion Alliance successfully campaigned for prohibition as a patriotic measure, to preserve time and money for the war effort. In 1915 and 1916, all provinces but Quebec prohibited the sale of alcohol. Quebec banned retail sale of distilled liquor in 1919, but only briefly.\n\nProhibition as a wartime measure was short-lived. A federal ban on manufacturing, importing and selling alcohol expired soon after the war ended. Most provincial legislation was repealed in the 1920s in favour of allowing governments to control alcohol sales. PEI was the last holdout. It prohibited alcohol sales until 1948.\n\nMeanwhile, Canadian liquor interests found a large market in the United States. It was under federal prohibition from 1920 until 1933. A Canadian law rooted in the Prohibition-era, the 1928 Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act, remained intact until 2012. It was then amended by the federal Parliament to allow consumers to bring limited amounts of alcohol across provincial boundaries for personal use.\n\nThe Downfall of the Movement\n\nThere are several theories about why the temperance movement waned and prohibition laws failed: they were criticized for distorting economic activity; for encouraging drinking (the opposite of their intended effect); and for encouraging organized crime. Perhaps more likely, there were changes in Canadian society and within the temperance movement itself that likely led to its downfall.\n\nSelf-employed Canadians who saw temperance as an aid to economic success were a diminishing part of the population. They were displaced by urban, wage-earning workforces. Within the movement, prohibition had provided an opportunity for close study of urban problems. This led many to conclude that those issues had more to do with the political and economic system than with alcohol. Many left the movement for other forms of activism.\n\nIt had been thought that the extension of voting rights to women (see Women\u2019s Suffrage) would sustain prohibition; since it was believed that women were sympathetic to the cause. However, referenda of the 1920s, in which women had the vote, showed a consistent decline of support for prohibition. The temperance movement was the creature of a society that was already fading when its prohibition victories were won.\n\nSee also Letitia Youmans; Amelia Yeomans; Louise McKinney; Edith Archibald."}, {"url": "https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/34447", "page_content": "Embargoed until: Indefinite\n\nPermanent Link https://hdl.handle.net/2144/34447\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Order of the Sons of Temperance (1842-), an offshoot of the declining Washingtonians, was organized to free the intemperate from the slavery of King Alcohol. The Order was divided into Subordinate, Grand, and National Divisions. A pledge to total abstinence required each Son to refrain from manufacturing, purchasing, selling, or imbibing all known and potential intoxicants. Beneficial features were adopted to protect members and their families from the hardships caused by sickness, unemployment, and death. The division room of the Order provided an atmosphere of general education, social activity, and character building. Though its semi-secret character brought protests upon the Sons of Temperance, the Order survived and continues to employ the principle of semi-secrecy (1966). By the 1850's the Order had become international in scope. From the United States, the principles and pra.ctises of the Order moved into Canada. Its philosophy penetrated Great Britain, Australia, the West Indies, South Africa, New Zealand, and Liberia. In the early twentieth century, British Sons influenced the establishment of the Order in Malta, Egypt, India, and Burma. Today (1966), the National Division of North America continues to send passwords to the National Divisions of Great Britain and Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Becoming \"champions\" of social equality, the Order admitted women, Negroes, and servicemen to its ranks. Lady visitors were permitted in the Order by 1854, and by 1866 women were admitted as members. Between 1863-65, a number of Subordinate Divisions were established in both the Union and Confederate military services. Negroes were admitted to the Order (1866) on a separate but equal basis. Statutory and \"constitutionaltt prohibitory schemes became the objective of many Sons during the 1850's, matters which continue (1966) to hold the interest of the Order. Neal Dow, Samuel L. Tilley, William Armstrong, and Henry Wilson labored with many other prominent Sons to establish state, provincial, and national prohibition of the \"spirits\" traffic throughout North America. Efforts to sustain its greatest membership, 232,233 in 1850, were adopted by the Sons of Temperance. Thereafter, youth temperance programs, such as the Cadets of Temperance, the Band of Hope, and the Loyal Crusaders, were employed by the Order. The practise of disseminating temperance principles through tracts, books, periodicals, journals, and addresses was also instituted by the Sons. Nonetheless, the fragmentation of \"closed\" and \"open\" temperance societies, the American Civil liar, the distraction of the Eighteenth Amendment, and internal problems kept the Order from maintaining its earlier membership. There are no comprehensive histories of the Sons of Temperance. John Allen Krout in Origins of Prohibition and J. C. Furnas in Life and Times of the Late Demon Rum have written general accounts of the temperance movement in the United States, particularly in regard to the nineteenth century; they have, however, merely touched upon the history of the Sons of Temperance. Nineteenth and twentieth century sources, both printed and manuscript, including all available records of the Order, have been employed in preparing this dissertation. On the basis of this material the writer has prepared a topical, but chronological, institutional history of the Sons of Temperance of North America."}, {"url": "http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/mackinnon_donald_alexander_15E.html", "page_content": "MacKINNON, DONALD ALEXANDER, teacher, lawyer, politician, and author; b. 22 Feb. 1863 in Uigg, P.E.I., son of William MacKinnon and Catherine Nicholson; m. 17 Oct. 1892, in Charlottetown, Adelaide Beatrice Louise Owen (d. 1912) of Georgetown, P.E.I., and they had two sons and one daughter; d. 20 April 1928 in Charlottetown.\n\nDonald A. MacKinnon was of Scots stock: his father had been born in Scotland and his mother was a descendant of settlers who had come to Prince Edward Island in 1803 with the Earl of Selkirk [Douglas*]. Donald attended the Uigg grammar school and, on completing his education there, taught in rural districts, beginning at the age of 14 if not earlier. By 1880 he had enrolled at Prince of Wales College in Charlottetown. After his graduation he received a first-class teaching licence and worked in several locations until 1882 when he began articles with Charlottetown barrister Malcolm McLeod. Taking advantage of changes to legislation which allowed time spent at approved law schools to count as part of the articling period, he attended Dalhousie law school in Halifax from 1885 to 1887 and received an llb. He was called to the Island bar as an attorney in 1887 and as a barrister the following year.\n\nMacKinnon opened a legal practice in Georgetown in 1887 and remained there until 1897, when he moved back to Charlottetown and began a partnership with Alexander Bannerman Warburton. The firm, which had offices in Summerside and Montague Bridge (Montague) as well, was short-lived because Warburton was called to the bench in 1898. Later law partners were Edward Bayfield Williams and Robert Neil McNeill. Named a qc in 1899, MacKinnon became president of the Law Society of Prince Edward Island the following year. He was also law agent for the dominion minister of justice in the province.\n\nMacKinnon\u2019s political career had begun in 1893 when he was elected as a Liberal for 4th Kings in the newly constituted Legislative Assembly [see Neil McLeod*]. Re-elected in 1897, he was named attorney general in the government of Donald Farquharson* in 1899, but when he returned to the electorate that year as a consequence of taking office he was, unusually, opposed and defeated. In 1900 he entered dominion politics and ran in Queens East. Although he received the majority of the votes, the result was declared void for \u201ccorrupt practices\u201d and a new election ordered which took place in March 1901 and which MacKinnon won by a larger majority. He sat until the dissolution but was not a candidate in the 1904 election. In June of that year he had complained to Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier* that his finances were not sufficient for politics and had indicated his desire to be made lieutenant governor of Prince Edward Island. In October 1904 the appointment came to him at the comparatively young age of 41. He held the position until May 1910. MacKinnon was again elected to the dominion parliament in 1921, representing Queens, and he sat until 1925. He did not contest the 1925 election.\n\nIn addition to his legal practice MacKinnon was involved in a number of business ventures, among them the Three Rivers Steamship Company and the Prince Edward Island Electric Company, of which he was president. His interests included the Boy Scouts, an organization he served as provincial commissioner, and writing. He was a contributor to the Prince Edward Island Magazine and in 1906, in partnership with Warburton, he edited Past and present of Prince Edward Island, an encyclopedic volume containing historical essays and biographical sketches. MacKinnon\u2019s contributions included articles on the fisheries, Queens County, geology, and the constitution. The volume continues to be useful for research. It was not, however, mentioned in obituaries, which concentrated on MacKinnon\u2019s political service, specifically mentioning his success in obtaining a branch line of the Prince Edward Island Railway that had benefited his district.\n\nH. T. Holman"}, {"url": "https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-was-the-temperance-movement.html", "page_content": "The temperance movement champions towards a society free of alcohol consumption. The movement promotes total teetotalism while at the same time proclaiming the sinful side of alcohol consumption. This mission is achieved through demanding laws that prohibit selling of alcohol or laws that demand its regulation. The temperance movement became particularly popular in the 19th and 20th centuries, especially in English speaking countries in North America and Europe as well as the Scandinavian countries. Prohibition in the United States from 1920 to 1933 is directly attributed to the temperance movement.\n\nThe Need for Temperance Movements\n\nIn the later stages of the 17th century, alcohol was an important part of the lives of people. The people used it for several purposes including recreation and medicine.\n\nWhile drinking was not disallowed, society, just like today, did not welcome drunkenness. Before the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century, drunkenness was not perceived as a social problem. However, the need for sober labor to operate heavy machinery that came with the revolution began changing the general attitude towards alcohol.\n\nProminent individuals in society started coming out against alcohol and churches soon took up the call and began preaching against alcohol although it was not heard until the early stages of the 1820s.\n\nSuccesses and Failures of the Temperance Movement\n\nIn the past, the movement has had a number of failures as well as successes in its quest.\n\nThe British Temperance movement is an example of a movement that experienced legislative failure. In its attempt to reduce the number of pubs, the Prime Minister came up with a proposal for closing one-third of the pubs and then compensating the owners. The proposal failed terribly after the brewers mounted a strong resistance against the idea. Repeatedly, the brewers managed to defeat the scheme in the House of Lords. In the end, the movement had to settle for the 1910 People\u2019s Tax, which saw to it that pubs paid huge taxes.\n\nOne of the major successes for the movement was achieved with Prohibition in the US in 1920. The movement in the US began its mission in 1913 and later on absorbed influential people like Wayne Wheeler. Through a technique known as \"Wheelerism,\" he was able to push for the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment, which prohibited alcohol use in the US. The prohibition lasted until 1933.\n\nOther countries such as New Zealand, Canada, and Norway also came up with similar laws. Nationwide prohibition of alcohol in Canada occurred between 1918 and 1920. In the early stages of the 1900s, half of the countries in the world had similar laws.\n\nDecline of the Temperance Movement\n\nWhile some people reported that the prohibitions had some positive effects, most people agreed that the ban had more disadvantages. Some of these disadvantages included the creation of unhealthy drinking behaviors, the discouragement of economic growth, and the encouragement of criminal activity. Internally, the movements were also in turmoil due to the domination of certain groups that forced the exit of moderate members. Today, the movement is weak but has a few organizations like the World Woman's Christian Temperance Union."}, {"url": "https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mackinnon-donald-10997", "page_content": "by Suzanne L. G. Rickard\n\nDonald Mackinnon (1892-1965), pastoralist and diplomat, was born on 30 April 1892 at Prahran, Melbourne, eldest of six children of Victorian-born parents Donald Mackinnon, barrister, and his wife Hilda Eleanor Marie, n\u00e9e Bunny. His grandfathers were Daniel Mackinnon and Frederick Bunny; Rupert Bunny was his uncle. After attending Melbourne Church of England Grammar School, young Donald boarded at Geelong Church of England Grammar School where he won prizes for Latin and Greek, edited the school magazine and was a prefect. He enrolled in law at the University of Melbourne and entered Ormond College in 1910. From 1911 to 1913 he read classics at New College, Oxford, but did not graduate.\n\nHaving served (from 1911) in the ranks of the King Edward's Horse, Mackinnon was commissioned in March 1914. He was sent to the Western Front in April 1915. Wounded on 29 March 1916, he was evacuated to London. In 1916-17 he commanded reserve units in Ireland. He returned to France as a captain in 1918 and, following the Armistice, again embarked for Ireland. At All Saints Church, Grangegorman, Dublin, on 12 June 1917 he had married Minella Beatrice Seymour with the rites of the Church of Ireland.\n\nBy 1919 Mackinnon was back in Australia. He drove cattle on his uncle's property, Marion Downs, near Boulia, Queensland, then moved to Melbourne where he completed (by correspondence) a course in accountancy. Failing to secure management of any of the family properties, and spurred by his wife's unhappiness in Melbourne, he took her to England in 1924. He worked for the Union Cold Storage Co. Ltd in London's Smithfield market. Following his divorce, he married Mary Hindle James, a 27-year-old physiotherapist, on 10 September 1927 at the register office, St Marylebone.\n\nWhen the meat merchants, Vestey Bros Ltd, offered Mackinnon an opportunity to represent their interests in Argentina, he sailed for Buenos Aires in 1929. Appointed a director (1937) of Anglo Frigorifico, he was widely respected in commercial circles. During World War II he was a member of 'Los Tamberos', a clandestine organization formed to combat the activities of Germans in Argentina. Despite his British connexions, he retained a strong sense of his nationality and wanted to expand trade between Australia and South America. He later claimed that he had 'been selling Australia in one form or another since 1929'.\n\nIn 1946 Mackinnon returned home. Settling on the family property, Marida Yallock, near Terang, Victoria, he soon became involved in local politics and was elected president of the Terang branch of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. He joined the State executive of the Liberal Party and was its vice-president in 1948. That year cabinet appointed him to the Victorian Inland Meat Authority. In August 1949 he won the presidency of the Liberal and Country Party of Victoria. He was a co-opted member of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's advisory council in 1952-57.\n\nMackinnon had gained extensive knowledge of South America's primary and secondary industries, of its politics, and of the international trade in meat. This expertise, and his knowledge of Spanish and Portuguese, proved assets when he was posted (1957) as Australian minister to Brazil. In 1958 he was appointed C.B.E. and promoted ambassador. His 'unusual but completely effective' approach to diplomacy was praised. Returning to Victoria in 1960, he led the Australian trade mission to South America in 1962.\n\nA tall man of military bearing, Mackinnon had a purposeful manner, a quiet sense of humour and an ability to communicate ideas. He was forthright, energetic and gentlemanly. Initially a small 'l' Liberal, he grew suspicious of government subsidies and in 1964-65 opposed the introduction of a reserve-price scheme for wool. At the same time, however, he feared that the Liberal Party would be unduly influenced by big business. Described as a 'driving force' in the party, he worked closely with leading members of the parliamentary wing, including Sir Robert Menzies. Mackinnon advised the Federal treasurer Harold Holt on rural policy and lent his support to the aspiring Andrew Peacock.\n\nA director of Trufood of Australia Pty Ltd, Mackinnon was a member of the Australian Primary Producers' Union and president (1964) of the Melbourne Club. His newspaper articles (1960-62) provided a lively commentary on South American trade, politics and social issues. He died on 2 May 1965 at Terang and was buried in the local cemetery with Presbyterian forms; his wife, daughter and two sons survived him, as did the daughter of his first marriage."}]}
