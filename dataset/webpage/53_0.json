The family moved to Kilburn and Tommy and his brother David had a normal suburban childhood, punctuated by highly enjoyable holidays at Butlin's holiday camps. He attended the Willesden Technical College where, according to his brother, he studied plumbing.\n\nIn the early Sixties, Nutter obtained a position with Donaldson, Williams & Ward, traditional Savile Row tailors with premises in the Burlington Arcade. Here, starting as an apprentice, he absorbed the lore and the rules of the English gentleman's classical wardrobe. His seven years with the firm gave him a thoroughgoing knowledge of his craft, and a lifelong respect for its rules.\n\nIn 1968, Nutter left Donaldson Williams & Ward to found his own business, first at 35a Savile Row, later in its present handsome double-fronted premises at No 19. He was backed by clients including Cilla Black and her husband Bobby Willis, Peter Brown, then Managing Director of the Beatles' Apple Corps, also situated in Savile Row, and by the lawyer James Vallance-White.\n\nThe business was an immediate success for, like Sir Hardy Amies, a Savile Row dandy of a previous generation, Tommy Nutter produced lively, contemporary tailoring whose roots were deeply embedded in the craftsmanship and knowledge of Savile Row. Indeed, he made suits for Amies as well as for newer residents of Savile Row, and in particular the Beatles. He was proudest of the fact that, for the cover of the Beatles' album Abbey Road (1969), he dressed three out of the four (George Harrison elected to be photographed on the road-crossing in denims). Other leading dandies of the period were also his clients, including Sir Roy Strong (then Director of the National Portrait Gallery), Mick Jagger and Elton John.\n\nNutter also applied his craft to dressing female icons of swinging London society at the time, including Cilla Black, a close friend, and Bianca Jagger, who was much photographed at the time in a white dinner jacket with white satin facings. Nutter also made a red velvet suit for Twiggy which became a celebrated and much-copied look when she was photographed wearing it in the early Seventies.\n\nIn 1971 he was elected to the Best-Dressed List in the United States, along with the Earl of Snowdon and Hardy Amies. At the time, American Menswear magazine said of Nutter that he was 'tradition spiced with daring'.\n\n'He never got things wrong about clothes,' said the restaurateur and bookshop-owner Stuart Grimshaw, who was a client of Tommy Nutter's from the late Sixties. 'He really knew what he was talking about. One would go in and say, 'What do I wear to go on safari in Kenya?' and Tommy would make one an absolutely correct safari suit, a proper one with all the pockets in exactly the right place.\n\n'This knowledge extended to such minutiae as the correct wearing of half or full brogues or co-respondent shoes. He was an encyclopaedia of correct, classical male style.'\n\nClients from the hipper purlieus of the aristocracy, from the media, pop stars, and even aspiring teenage dandies from the East End whose ambition, in the early Seventies, was to own a Nutter suit, were drawn to Tommy Nutter not only because of his ineffable sense of style, but also because of his peculiarly ironic personality.\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber was a client and friend. 'He made me a lot of things when one was younger and trendier,' Lloyd Webber said. 'There was a wonderful maroon coat I remember I wore for Ascot - he was always such fun, very much part of my early life when Jesus Christ Superstar was going on - he made clothes for Tim Rice too - we were all great mates'.\n\nNutter was a gentle humorist who had a wide and interesting circle of friends attracted by his enthusiasm, by his gentle, self-mocking personality and his acerbic comments on the vagaries of others, always ending with the expression 'But who am I to talk?' He was a prodigious and witty correspondent and his letters to his many friends are treasured. In addition, he delighted in writing to the serious newspapers on topics as far-ranging as the correct buttoning of the suit on a statue of John F. Kennedy, to the scarcity of deckchairs in Green Park. He was always very ready to spring to the defence if his beloved Savile Row came under attack, as it so frequently did in the anarchic Sixties.\n\nNutter was also a firm believer in the supremacy of the English suit and of English cloth; during the Seventies and early Eighties he took part in huge international fashion shows put on by Reid & Taylor, the Scottish firm of woollen and worsted manufacturers.\n\nWith his untimely death, from complications arising from Aids, London society loses a witty and elegant dandy, whose hand-rolled lapels and insouciant manner masked a serious and continuing purpose; to make sure that the craft and traditions of Savile Row tailoring were preserved for, and valued by, his generation.\n\n(Photograph omitted)"}, {"url": "https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O137269/suit-tommy-nutter/", "page_content": "Tommy Nutter (1943-1992) opened his Savile Row premises in 1969. The enterprise was funded by the singer Cilla Black and Peter Brown of Apple, the Beatles's record company. Describing his first look Nutter said: 'Everybody was wearing a narrow suit at the end of the 1960s ... so I just went wild with the lapels and cut them as wide as you possibly could - enormous - and it was terribly flared at the jacket. So that was my first look and it was different from anybody else.' Tommy Nutter\u2019s celebrity clientele included Mick Jagger. Eric Clapton and the Beatles, who are pictured wearing his suits on the front cover of 'Abbey Road'. Such connections enabled Nutter to introduce high fashion to Savile Row and thus effect enormous influence on British menswear.\n\n\n\nThis suit was given by Sir Roy Strong, author, broadcaster, former Director of the National Portrait Gallery and from 1974 to1987, Director and Secretary of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Dating to around 1980, this suit was worn by Sir Roy for public and formal occasions in his capacity as Museum Director. Sir Roy became known for his vigorous support of modern design and was also recognised for his own sartorial flair."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/may/18/tommy-nutter-rebel-tailor-savile", "page_content": "Mick and Bianca chose to wear his designs on their wedding day; he was on Elton John's speed-dial, and was the go-to man for women who wanted to wear men's tailoring.\n\nNow the work of Tommy Nutter, the first tailor to successfully combine Savile Row traditions with the cutting edge fashion of Swinging London, is being celebrated with a display at the Fashion and Textile Museum.\n\n\"His approach to tailoring was subversive,\" said Timothy Everest, the renowned tailor who trained under Nutter in the late 80s and is joint curator for the show in Bermondsey Street, south-east London. \"He was articulating bespoke tailoring to a new, younger, audience.\"\n\nNutter was the first tailor to open up his Savile Row premises to passers-by; his shop had windows at a time when bespoke tailoring was usually behind closed doors. He opened his first shop in 1969, joining forces with the master cutter Edward Sexton, and backed by Cilla Black and the Beatles executive Peter Brown.\n\nThe shop attracted rock stars and aristocrats who wanted the mix of innovative styling and traditional made-to-measure tailoring. Huge lapels, velvet jackets with nipped-in waists, Oxford bags and mixed-up tweeds fast became his design signatures.\n\nHighlights from the exhibition, Tommy Nutter: Rebel on the Row, include four of Mick Jagger's suits \u2013 boyish-sized save for the shoulders \u2013 in shades of green and lemon. Elton John's stadium-ready two-tone dinner jackets are striking and tasteless in equal measure.\n\n\"Tommy completely glamorised Savile Row and made it accessible,\" said Elton John, who often visited the shop to be measured up while drinking a glass of sherry.\n\nIn the early 70s Nutter created suits for Bianca Jagger. \"Bianca really wanted a man's suit and not a suit cut for a woman,\" Everest said. \"She asked for the darts to be taken out of her first pistachio green suit to make it sexier.\"\n\nThe exhibition has recreated Nutter's shop, along with its innovative window displays featuring patchouli-soaked stuffed rats wearing diamond chokers, to demonstrate how pioneering his approach to brand image was at the time.\n\nThe tailor stopped working with Sexton at 35a Savile Row in 1976 but returned to the street some years later to set up business again, at No 19.

A Savile Row suit \u201crarely looks new in the conventional sense,\u201d the Australian journalist Lance Richardson writes in his new history of Tommy Nutter (and his brother, David), \u201cHouse of Nutter.\u201d Its magic, he goes on, \u201cis that it enhances your real self into heightened fantasy, then presents this fantasy as your real self.\u201d\n\nNutter brought a substantial dose of fantasy to the fantasy. He began on Savile Row at the lowest levels, picking up pins at G. Ward & Company, where he eventually joined forces with a talented young cutter named Edward Sexton and, with him, opened Nutters in 1969 \u2014 the first new tailor on Savile Row in more than a century. His investors included Peter Brown, a manager of the Beatles (he stepped in when his friend and former boss Brian Epstein died), and the pop star Cilla Black.\n\nImage\n\nNutter was already a fixture on the London scene, well connected via Brown, his boyfriend for a time. The Nutters suit, unlike others on the Row, was cut for flash: tight-waisted and small-chested to emphasize the body, with a long jacket and mega lapels. Fabrics and colors were chosen to stand out rather than stand back. Men and women both flocked in: Bianca as well as Mick, Diana Ross, Eric Clapton, Twiggy, Peter Sellers. Elton John, who first came to Nutters in 1971, ordered in bulk.\n\n\u201cHouse of Nutter\u201d traces the ascent and untimely end of Tommy Nutter, and the parallel history of his brother, David: also gay, also embedded in the world of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, though as a photographer and confidant. Tommy bloomed out of London\u2019s Swinging Sixties and became an internationally recognized designer, a celebrity in his own right. He was as much a character as a person, natty and fabulous in a wild suit \u2014 \u201cPeople expect one to turn up looking like a chic Bozo the Clown,\u201d he once said \u2014 a salesman taking his show on the road. (Sexton, mostly back at base on Savile Row, was the better craftsman.)"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/03/house-nutter-rebel-tailor-savile-row-lance-richardson-review", "page_content": "The Savile Row tailor Tommy Nutter \u2013 his birth name, rather than a moniker adopted at the height of his stardom \u2013 was the exemplar of fabulous but fleeting fame in the 60s and 70s. Emerging apparently from nowhere, he quickly became \u201cthe coolest man you\u2019ve ever seen\u201d, designing flamboyant clothes for stars such as Elton John and the Beatles, who, apart from George, wore his suits on the cover of Abbey Road .\n\nLance Richardson\u2019s splendidly readable and gossipy account of his life has a trump card to play \u2013 namely the relationship between Tommy and his photographer brother, David, who acted as a kind of artistic Boswell to his brother\u2019s sartorial Johnson. Tommy died in 1992 of an Aids-related illness, but David is still alive, and his cooperation enhances a gripping read that is as much social history as it is biography.\n\nTo be gay, as both Tommy and David were, growing up in postwar Britain was a mixed blessing. On the one hand, it was a time of chemical castration for \u201cqueers\u201d and imprisonment; on the other, it was a world of secret languages and discreet clubs (with less than discreet patrons). Richardson, himself gay, writes about the persecution of homosexuals at the time with bracing anger; readers who expect a series of camp anecdotes may be surprised as he describes how the outing and punishment of gay men was \u201clike a public hanging transposed from the middle ages: prurient [and] ethically indefensible\u201d.\n\nIt was in this milieu that Tommy, a talented young \u201ccutter\u201d who learned his trade on Savile Row, opened his first boutique at No 35a with the brilliant Edward Sexton. With the financial and publicity assistance of, among others, Cilla Black and Peter Brown (one of the Beatles\u2019 management team), Nutter was the right man in the right place, strutting about in a gorgeous, ridiculous era peopled by characters such as Michael Fish, who sold silk kipper ties from his eponymous Clifford Street boutique in the shape of actual kippers. Nutter, a \u201ccomely youth from Edgware\u201d, north London, soon rose to the challenge, producing outfits that were \u201can eccentric mix of Lord Emsworth, the Great Gatsby and Bozo the Clown\u201d.\n\nTommy's idea of making a splash was to throw himself into the Thames after being ejected from a party at the Tate\n\nIt is no surprise that the likes of Lennon and Jagger were aficionados; nor that, after quickly scaling the heights, Nutter went into decline, irrelevance giving way to ill health. A lesser writer might have made the story of his downfall depressing, but Richardson has an eye for telling and hilarious details. We learn, for instance, that for Elton John\u2019s (first) wedding in 1984, Nutter created 20 wildly exuberant outfits, \u201ctwo of each, in case of any mishap, in a wide range of primary colours\u201d.\n\nIt is David who gives the story a wider dimension. He was nicknamed \u201cDawn Black\u201d for his habit of partying throughout the night in New York, though he was a more introverted and less reckless character than his brother, photographing the stars of the day, but remaining an observer rather than a participant in bacchanalian pursuits. But then he could hardly help seeming less colourful than Tommy \u2013 a man whose idea of making a splash was to throw himself into the Thames after being ejected from a party at the Tate.\n\nHouse of Nutter, Richardson\u2019s first book, is a fine match of author and subject. He writes with flair and erudition, making extensive use of interviews with David, and bringing something new to the evocation of an era that might seem overfamiliar and cliched to many. In fact, barring the absence of an index, it\u2019s hard to find fault with this thoroughly enjoyable glimpse into high fashion and low life."}, {"url": "https://savilerow-style.com/news/tommy-nutter-rebel-cause/", "page_content": "Tommy Nutter, the tailor who ripped up the rules of Savile Row, is remembered in a new biography. Tom Corby reports\n\nJust over a quarter of a century after his untimely death from Aids, the avant-garde Tommy Nutter, like so many creatives of his generation, is still regarded as a legend, remembered as the tailor who single-handedly reconciled the traditions of Savile Row with the male peacock revolution of 1960s swinging London. His contribution to some of the most iconic styles and pop imagery of the 20th century has become part of the history of his trade as he wore down the division between tailoring and fashion. Friends say that a statue ought to be put up of him, like that of Beau Brummel, the archetypal dandy who, in the 18th century, set the bespoke style for generations.\n\nTommy spent his formative years in Edgware, north London, where his father owned a caf\u00e9, catering, in the main, to customers like truck drivers, gas fitters and builders. He was destined to be a plumber but, over the years, emerged as a blue collar boy made good in the class crucible of the 60s; a time when the alchemy of taste, cool, and sheer force of personality could transform lives in ways that would have seemed impossible in years gone by. Tommy, a 6ft 2 inches tall young man with matinee idol looks, arrived right on cue. It all started when, aged 19, he broke free from plumbing to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy. He then landed an apprenticeship with Donaldson, Williamson and Ward, traditional Savile Row tailors, with premises in Burlington Arcade. There, he absorbed the lore and the rules of the English gentlemen\u2019s classic wardrobe. His seven years with the firm gave him a thorough knowledge of his craft, and a lifelong respect for its hierarchy.\n\nIn 1969, Tommy founded his own business, joining up with Edward Sexton, a young cutter with brilliant technical skills. They were financially backed by Tommy\u2019s close friend, the singer Cilla Black, her husband Bobby Willis and others prepared to take a risk. The venture was an immediate success although a writer in the Daily Mirror snarked: \u201cThomas Nutter is opening what he calls a \u2018thoroughly square\u2019 tailoring shop \u2026 in Savile Row next week. Well that will make a change. I mean there can\u2019t be more than a dozen there now. Mr Nutter, who is 26, is weary of \u2018all those Carnaby Street gimmicks\u2019, and thinks that clothes, like hair, are settling down to something more sober \u2026 What, then, of rumours that Ringo Starr has ordered a pair of scarlet PVC trousers from Nutters?\u201d Tommy replied curtly: \u201cThey\u2019ll be very square scarlet PVC trousers.\u201d\n\nSavile Row, with its collection of Royal Warrants, had never seen anything like it when Nutters opened at No. 35a, the story of which has been brought back to life by Lance Richardson in his biography House of Nutter \u2013 The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row. A year on, the Daily Mail was declaring it \u201ca whizz bang success \u2013 the place for men\u2019s clothes\u201d, putting the charismatic Tommy in the class of actor Terence Stamp, photographer Brian Duffy, and hair dresser Vidal Sassoon, all the stylish young Londoners who had shot themselves into the new aristocracy. Clients came in from the hipper haunts of those named in Debrett\u2019s, from the media, pop stars and even aspiring teenage dandies from the East End, whose ambition was to own a Nutter suit, drawn to Tommy not only because of his matchless sense of style, but also because of his personality. He welcomed them all.\n\nLike Hardy Amies, a Savile Row dandy who dressed The Queen, Tommy produced lively, contemporary tailoring, but with roots deeply embedded in the craftsmanship of Savile Row. Amies named Tommy as \u201cthe most exciting tailor on Savile Row in decades.\u201d For three decades, Tommy kitted out the biggest stars on both sides of the Atlantic. He was proud of the fact that, for the cover of the Beatles\u2019 Abbey Road album, three of them wore Tommy Nutter bespoke. George Harrison chose\n\ndenim. Other leading dandies of the period were also his clients, including Sir Roy Strong, then director of the National Portrait Gallery, Mick Jagger and Elton John. Andrew Lloyd Webber was also a client as well as a friend. He has recalled: \u201cThere was a wonderful maroon coat I wore for Ascot \u2013 he was always such fun, very much part of my early life when Jesus Christ Superstar was going on \u2013 Tommy made clothes for Tim Rice too \u2013 we were all great mates.\u201d\n\nMick Jagger sported an eau-de-nil three-piece for his wedding to Bianca Perez-Mora Macias in 1971. He was in another Nutter creation days later on his honeymoon in Venice, fitted so snugly that it left no doubt as to which side he dressed. Celebrity nuptials became something of a thing for Tommy. John Lennon wore cream corduroy for his wedding to Yoko Ono on Gibraltar. For Elton John\u2019s marriage in 1984 Tommy made 20 suits, \u201ctwo of each, in case of mishap\u201d, as he later recalled, \u201cin a wide range of primary colours, including orange and very bright yellow. With each outfit went the appropriate straw boater.\u201d\n\nJohn Reid, Elton John\u2019s manager, has said: \u201cIt was quite an event going to Nutters. You\u2019d write the whole day off. Maybe you\u2019d have lunch and a couple of bottles of champagne.\u201d Tommy has said that when things became \u201cedgy\u201d with Elton he would send out for a bottle of sherry \u201cto smooth things along\u201d. For Elton\u2019s 36th birthday, Tommy made a suit overlaid with 1,009,444 bugle beads, each one painstakingly attached by hand. Tommy also applied his craft to dressing female icons of swinging London, like the red velvet suit for Twiggy which became a celebrated and much copied look when she was photographed wearing it in the early 70s.\n\nPeople were attracted to Tommy not only because of his ineffable sense of style, but because of his ironic personality. He was a humorist with a wide and interesting circle of friends who were attracted by his enthusiasm, his gentle self-mocking personality and his acerbic comments on the vagaries of others, always ending with the expression, \u201cBut who am I to talk?\u201d He was a witty correspondent and his letters to his friends are treasured. In addition, he delighted in writing to the serious newspapers on topics as far ranging as the correct buttoning of the suit on a statue of John F Kennedy, to the scarcity of deckchairs in London\u2019s Green Park.\n\nTommy died of Aids in August 1992, aged 49. \u201cThe saddest thing of all,\u201d he once wrote, \u201cis an in-between look.\u201d No-one could ever have accused him of that. At his memorial service in St George\u2019s, Hanover Square, just up the road from Savile Row, Cilla Black read an abridged excerpt from Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, relating the story of \u201cA true, a perfect gentle Knight \u2026 In dying in his excellence and flower, when he is certain of his high good name; for then he gives to friend, and self, no shame.\u201d\n\nThe final words should go to Nutters loyalist Elton John who said: \u201cTommy completely glamorised Savile Row and made it accessible.\u201d There\u2019s no arguing with that\u2026\n\nHouse of Nutter: The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row by Lance Richardson, published by Chatto & Windus. \u00a325"}, {"url": "http://www.wicksorder.com/1775.html", "page_content": "\u88c1\u7f1d\u754c\u6700\u540e\u7684\u65f6\u5c1a\u6559\u7236Tommy Nutter\n\n\u5728Tommy Nutter\uff081970\uff09\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u5f7b\u5e95\u4ee3\u66ff\u4e86\u88c1\u7f1d\u65f6\u5c1a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u7684\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u8428\u7ef4\u5c14\u8857\u6700\u9876\u5c16\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u3002\n\nTommy Nutter was a British tailor.\n\nTommy Nutter was born in 1943.\n\nIn his youth Nutter studied at the Tailor and Cutter Academy and worked for traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward.

After seven years, in 1969, he joined up with Edward Sexton, to open Nutters of Savile Row at Number 35a Savile Row. The business was an immediate success, as Nutter combined traditional tailoring skills with innovative design. He designed for the Hardy Amies range, and then for the man himself. His clients included his investors, plus Sir Roy Strong, Mick Jagger, Bianca Jagger and Elton John. Nutter himself was most proud of the fact that, for the cover of The Beatles\" album Abbey Road in 1969, he dressed three out of the four: George Harrison elected to be photographed on the road-crossing in denims. In the 1970s his bespoke business became less successful, but he branched out into ready to wear clothing, marketed through Austin Reed. He also successfully expanded into East Asia, establishing the Savile Row brand in Japan. In 1976 Sexton bought Nutter out of the Business. Nutter went to work for Kilgour French and Stanbury, managing his own workroom. Sexton continued to run Nutters of Savile Row until 1983, when Nutter returned to the row with a ready to wear shop: \"Tommy Nutter, Savile Row\". (This new venture, which traded at Number 19 Savile Row until Tommy\"s death, was backed by J&J Crombie Limited, who continue to own the \"Tommy Nutter\" trademark) At this time, Sexton set up a business in his own name. In the 1980s, he described his suits as a \"cross between the big-shouldered Miami Vice look and the authentic Savile Row.\" He created the clothing of The Joker worn by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film Batman. Nutter died in 1992 at the Cromwell Hospital in London of complications from Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome."}]}
