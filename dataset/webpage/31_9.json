For 55 years, Breen has been working to promote innovative child welfare services and programs in California.\n\nOn November 3, a statewide panel of social workers recognized Breen\u2019s exceptional lifetime of good work with an induction into the 2019 Hall of Distinction for the California Social Welfare Archives (CSWA). The honor acknowledges and documents the work of those who are champions of social welfare in California.\n\nMary Denton, CEO of Side by Side, a community-based, nonprofit organization serving at-risk youth and their families, introduced Breen at the induction ceremony. \u201cIt is no exaggeration,\u201d said Denton, \u201cthat Peter has made the lives of hundreds of thousands of children so much better.\u201d Denton lauded Breen, who serves as board of directors chair at Side by Side, for his passion, wisdom and experience serving children who have been impacted by adversity.\n\nThanking Denton, the 82-year-old Breen joked, \u201cI thought that I was listening to my obituary. But it was really, really nice.\u201d\n\nA champion for children\n\nBreen joined the Los Angeles Bureau of Public Assistance as a social worker in February 1964. \u201cThe salary then was $464 a month. With that, we bought a house. And a car,\u201d said Breen to a chuckling crowd.\n\nHis first assignment was to Metro South 1, the northern part of the Watts neighborhood in South Los Angeles. Six months later, he was in the middle of the Watts Riots. \u201cWe were immediately sent home,\u201d said Breen, \u201cbecause clearly the administration didn\u2019t want a bunch of white liberals wandering around. It was a scary time.\u201d\n\nBreen said he started working with children because that\u2019s where there was a vacancy at the Bureau. However, he quickly realized it was here he would be most interested in what he was doing, and be best used. \u201cI got totally wrapped up in it,\u201d said Breen, \u201cand I\u2019ve never given it up.\u201d\n\nOver the course of his career, Breen served as Marin County welfare director, Marin County child welfare services director, president of the American Public Welfare Association, board member of the National Resource Center for Children of Incarcerated Parents and executive director of Centerforce, a statewide social services agency for 90,000 family visitors to California state prisons.\n\nBreen loved being a part of helping families who often made very long trips to the prisons, offering hospitality and respite services. Quite often families of prisoners are disrupted; and kids in disrupted families stand a better chance of getting involved in negative behavior than kids from intact families.\n\nMaking things better is just a way of life\n\nToday, Breen serves as a senior fellow with the Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) as an expert on children of prisoners. He also remains deeply immersed in local politics in San Anselmo, California, where he has been mayor four times, and served on the town council for 17 years.\n\nLast year, Breen and his wife, Ione, traveled to Syria with a group from Caring for Children Worldwide to deliver 5000 Teddy Bears\u2015what Breen refers to as psychological emergency first aid\u2015 to refugee children.\n\n\u201cPeter doesn\u2019t wait to be asked to do something,\u201d said Denton. \u201cHe sees a need and figures out how to bring forward solutions.\u201d\n\nWhile Breen is honored to receive CSWA\u2019s highest accolade, it is even more important to him that CSWA continues to serve as encouragement for people outside the industry to look into social work, to get involved, to think about social work and to talk about all the good that can be done.\n\n\u201cI have a horrible habit of trying to get involved in figuring things out,\u201d said Breen. \u201cI like to believe, helping make things get better. It\u2019s just a way of life for me.\u201d\n\nAbout the California Social Welfare Archives\n\nThe mission of the CSWA, a nonprofit organization affiliated with USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and the USC Doheny Memorial Library Special Collections Department, is to enable users to more deeply understand linkages between the past and present, in order to address future social welfare problems and solutions. Organized in 1979, CSWA collects correspondence, minutes, memoranda, annual reports, research papers, conference proceedings, oral histories, and newsletters reflecting the development of social welfare programs, problems, issues and services in the state."}, {"url": "https://ballotpedia.org/Peter_Breen", "page_content": "Email *\n\nFirst Name *\n\nLast Name\n\nPlease complete the Captcha above"}, {"url": "https://science.psu.edu/news/2018-peter-craig-breen-memorial-award", "page_content": "Devon Van Cura (Chemistry Undergraduate Class of 2018) was the recipient of the Peter Craig Breen Memorial Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Chemistry Research.

The purpose of this award is to recognize undergraduate students enrolled in the Eberly College of Science at The Pennsylvania State University who are majoring in or planning to major in Chemistry and who have demonstrated excellence in academics and research focused in chemistry.\n\nThe inaugural recipient of the award was Ailiena Maggiolo, a rising senior working in the laboratory of Amie Boal, an Assistant Professor in Chemistry/BMB. Ailiena has worked in the Boal group for the past two years on several different projects involving x-ray structure determination of biological catalysts that use transition metal ions as part of their catalytic cycle. Her efforts to date have helped us understand more about enzymatic halogenation reactions, a chemically challenging transformation of interest for its potential to make certain synthetic chemistry applications more environmentally-friendly. She has also worked on a DNA biosynthesis enzyme that is an important antibiotic drug target, helping to discover novel chemistry associated with versions of the catalyst found exclusively in certain types of bacteria that cause infections in humans and animals. Ailiena\u2019s work has already appeared in prominent scientific journals with more to come prior to completion of her B.S. degree in Spring 2017. In her nomination letter, Professor Boal stated, \u201cAiliena\u2019s persistence in setting up a research opportunity in my lab is notable \u2013 when I took too long to respond to an initial inquiry via email, she waited outside my office. I\u2019m very grateful that she went to such lengths. Ailiena has proved to be a remarkably ambitious and productive trainee and she has helped initiate several new research directions in my lab.\u201d Ailiena intends to pursue a Ph.D. degree in Chemistry after graduation.\n\nThe award was given for the first time at the chemistry graduation reception on May 7th, in honor and memory of Peter Craig Breen, who was a chemistry major at Penn State from 2010 through 2014. Peter was a gifted student who excelled in high school and was selected as a National Merit finalist. Peter chose during his senior year to attend Penn State. He saw many opportunities to continue to learn and grow at the university and was following a family legacy of Penn Staters, which includes both of his parents, Renee and Kevin, as well as an uncle, aunts, and his brother, Scott.\n\nPeter enrolled at Penn State in 2010 as a Braddock Scholar and a Schreyer\u2019s Scholar in The Eberly College of Science with a major in chemistry. He immediately pursued a computational chemistry research position involving the study of RNA in Phil Bevilacqua\u2019s lab. Working in the Bevilacqua lab quickly became an important and enjoyable part of his studies, while the lab and the group became an extended campus home and family for Peter.\n\nNot only was he heavily involved in research during his studies, but Peter was also dedicated to assisting his fellow students and peers. He found fulfillment in helping others, and sought out opportunities to do so throughout his undergraduate career. Peter worked under the direction of Joe Keiser as both a tutor in the chemistry resource room and a teaching assistant in chemistry courses. Other interests of Peter\u2019s included travel and pursuing exposure to chemistry beyond the academic setting, fulfilled during his time as an intern in industry at the University in Freiburg, Germany for a summer.\n\nPeter had planned to continue pursuing his passion for research in bioinformatics, and was accepted into three Ph.D. programs before his passing in 2014.

The Howard campaign said Breen has received $16,000 in previous campaigns from Richard Uiehlein, a conservative megadonor.\n\nUiehlein also was the biggest financial backer of Judge Roy Moore, the U.S. Senate candidate from Alabama who was accused of sexually assaulting several teenage girls.\n\nBut, come on. Taking money from Uihlein doesn't make Breen a supporter of Moore.\n\n\"Breen stands with Donald Trump for an all-out ban on a woman's right to choose,\" Howard also states in her ad.\n\nThat's true. Breen is strongly pro-life, opposing abortion except when a mother's life is in danger.\n\n\"Breen stands with the NRA to let dangerous criminals have guns,\" Howard states in her ad.\n\nThat one's false. Breen voted to ban bump stocks, a 72-hour waiting period before buying guns, allowing removal of guns from dangerous owners, and requiring state licenses for gun dealers, all of which the NRA opposed and Gov. Bruce Rauner vetoed.\n\nBreen's past votes on gun control legislation earned him 93 percent approval for the NRA, but for the November election, he's been endorsed by two gun control groups; Moms Demand Action and G-PAC, a gun control group led by gunshot survivor and former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords."}, {"url": "https://www.odt.co.nz/sport/rugby/rugby-breen-happy-being-back-where-it-all-began", "page_content": "North Otago fullback Peter Breen. Photo by Linda Robertson.\n\nYou can take Peter Breen out of North Otago but you cannot take the province out of Peter Breen - well, its rugby team anyway.\n\nBreen (20), was born and bred in Oamaru, but left the town at the end of schooling and headed to Dunedin to further his education and rugby career.\n\nBut a couple of years later, he now finds himself back wearing the North Otago jersey.\n\nBreen is turning out for the province under the player of origin scheme, which was introduced this year by the New Zealand Rugby Union for teams in the Heartland Championship.\n\nPlayers who went to secondary school in a province but left to play in another are eligible to play for their original province.\n\nBreen ably qualifies, having attended Waitaki Boys High School, where he said he was more into basketball than rugby.\n\n\"My main sport was really basketball but I still enjoyed my rugby. When I was 16 I was called into the North Otago team and had one game for them,\" he said.\n\nBreen came off the bench in 2005, to play on the wing, when North Otago put 50 points over South Canterbury in an early season match.\n\nBut that was the last time he thought about turning out for North Otago, as Dunedin beckoned.\n\nPlaying for Alhambra-Union this year, he was approached by North Otago coach Mike Mullins after a club game and leaped at the chance to wear his former province's jersey under the origin scheme.\n\nHe had represented North Otago teams through the age groups.\n\nBreen has started every game this season for North Otago at fullback, as the team slowly starts to come together after disappointing opening losses to South Canterbury and Poverty Bay.\n\n\"It is a step up from club play, and we've been a bit slow out of the blocks. But I'm used to it with Alhambra-Union. Things are now starting to work and we're starting to play a bit better.\"\n\nHe is not the only Alhambra-Union player turning out for a Heartland Championship side. Hooker Ben Pereira plays for Wairarapa Bush.\n\nBreen, whose twin brother, Robbie, plays for Green Island, said he was loving playing fullback after starting out the club season at first five-eighth.\n\n\"You get a bit more freedom and you can be more of an individual. In the backline you can just turn up where ever you want.\"\n\nNorth Otago has a crucial match on Saturday against Mid Canterbury.\n\nThe winner will go through to the Meads Cup pool of matches, while the loser will go down to the Lochore Cup.\n\nThe match, to be played in Ashburton, would be tough, Breen said, but North Otago was improving, as its 50-point hammering of Thames Valley last Saturday showed.\n\nBreen was not tiring of the travelling - he heads to Oamaru two nights a week for practice and on Fridays for weekend matches.\n\nIn the first year of a two-year personal training course at Otago Polytechnic, Breen said the journey north was one with which he was quite familiar.\n\n\"North Otago have been good enough to lend us a van and the guys take turns at driving.

Click here to see more.\n\n\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times Editorial Board sent nominees for the Illinois House of Representatives a list of questions to find out their views on a range of important issues facing the state of Illinois and their districts. Peter Breen submitted the following responses:\n\n1. The COVID-19 pandemic has hammered the finances of Illinois. The state is staring at a $6.2 billion budget shortfall in this fiscal year. What should be done? Please be specific.\n\nThe pandemic highlighted the historical short-sightedness of the General Assembly. We went into this horrific situation with absolutely NO money in a \u201crainy day fund.\u201d Further, for over a decade, the General Assembly knowingly passed underfunded budgets using every accounting scheme imaginable. Even when we had higher than anticipated tax receipts in the state, as the result of a very positive economy, we didn\u2019t save but spent every dime and more. Then the virus came and devastated business, personal income, taxes and user fees, etc. While the economy is beginning to rebound, Illinois must become far more proactive in helping grow small and midsize businesses, instead of again hiking crippling taxes to meet the voracious appetite for out-of-control spending in Springfield.\n\n2. What grade \u2014 \u201cA\u201d to \u201cF\u201d \u2014 would you give Gov. J.B. Pritzker for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic? Please explain. What, if anything, should he have done differently?\n\nThe grade has to be \u201cIncomplete,\u201d since we are still midway through the pandemic. We won\u2019t know the impact of the governor\u2019s lockdown and pandemic orders until at least next year: then, we can see the full results of these policies on the physical, mental, and economic health of our residents versus those of neighboring states.\n\nBefore the pandemic, Illinois imposed the worst tax burden on its residents of any state in the country, along with being known as a notoriously bad place to start, build, or bring a business. Gov. Pritzker then imposed one of the most severe lockdowns in the country. Predictably, Illinois residents have not recovered their jobs and businesses as quickly as folks in other states. Even with the lockdown, Illinoisans experienced worse physical health impacts from COVID than neighboring states.\n\nWe need a full post-COVID review of why we suffered such high infections and deaths in long-term-care facilities. Without that review, we won\u2019t know whether this was due to the governor\u2019s actions or inactions, or some other cause.\n\nFrom the beginning, I\u2019ve advocated against including my county of DuPage in a \u201czone\u201d with Cook County in terms of phasing openings and policies. That penalized and handicapped our ability to move more quickly to recovery.\n\nAnd it was wrong to ban small family retailers from in-person sales of their products, while large retailers could sell those same products.\n\nFinally, the Pritzker Administration entirely botched unemployment insurance, leaving the jobless with no one to answer the phone, trying to navigate a broken website, and suffering the indignity of their personal identification details put on the internet. With tens of thousands of government employees across Illinois at home, there were plenty of people who could have manned unemployment phone lines during this unprecedented crisis.\n\n3. In the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, legislatures in some states have taken up the issue of police reform. Should Illinois do the same? If so, what would that look like?\n\nEveryone was horrified by the tragic circumstances surrounding the needless death of George Floyd. It was inexcusable on every level. There are clearly agencies and departments that require more and better training of officers and a clear set of policies to prevent such a tragic result ever again. That officer in Minneapolis was acting outside of guidelines and deserves to be punished for his crimes. Our agencies are better than this, particularly in DuPage County.\n\nIn Illinois, I backed the bipartisan Police and Community Relations Improvement Act, which banned chokeholds, put standards in place for officer-involved deaths, and improved training requirements, among other reforms. While due to this Act, Illinois already has in place many of the reforms other states are now reviewing, we should always be looking at any and every helpful reform that protects the public and gives our agencies the ability to perform professionally in maintaining the law. As a Village Trustee, I was also a strong supporter of body cameras to protect both the public and police officers in altercations. This was at a time when there was significant resistance to these devices.\n\n4. Should the Legislature pass a law requiring all law enforcement officers to wear body cameras? Why or why not?\n\nAbsolutely. It protects both citizens and law enforcement. It can and does act as a deterrent for both parties. I would immediately sponsor or co-sponsor such a bill.\n\n5. Federal prosecutors have revealed a comprehensive scheme of bribery, ghost jobs and favoritism in subcontracting by ComEd to influence the actions of House Speaker Michael Madigan. Who\u2019s to blame? What ethics reforms should follow? Should Madigan resign?\n\nTerra Costa Howard, and enablers like her, are to blame. During the 2018 elections, Costa Howard promised the residents of the 48th District that she would be independent of Mike Madigan, but then she turned around and took $1.5 million in campaign contributions from him (more than any other state legislative candidate) and voted for him for Illinois House Speaker. Terra Costa Howard handed our vote\u2014and our voice\u2014to a crook and a thief.\n\nEven today, Costa Howard still refuses to return one dime of all the dirty money she\u2019s taken\u2014and she is still raking in money from Madigan-controlled campaign committees.\n\nMadigan has run state government as a pay-to-play scheme for decades. The monied interest groups pay into his campaign committees and hire his preferred lobbyists, guaranteeing them a seat at the legislative table. If you don\u2019t have money or the right lobbyist, you lose.\n\nAnd he\u2019s done this in plain sight, with increasing numbers of Illinoisans watching in horror, but unable to stop it. When reform-minded candidates like me step forward to run in competitive districts, they get hit with multi-million-dollar smear campaigns, executed by the Madigan machine\u2019s sophisticated political operation. Even post-Madigan, this won\u2019t change unless we elect new leaders clean of the taint of Madigan and his machine.\n\nOn Madigan, I called for his resignation last year. While in the House, I opposed Madigan for Speaker twice.\n\nOn reforms, we need term limits. We have a part-time citizen legislature, and term limits will strengthen the temporary nature of legislative service. There are a raft of additional reforms in this vein: bans on lobbying after legislating, strengthening lobbyist disclosure requirements, limits on legislative leaders, taking power away from legislative leaders and returning it to members, and putting teeth into laws prohibiting conflicts of interest by legislators, among others. Reform should be an \u201call-of-the-above\u201d approach.\n\n6. Please tell us about your civic work in the last two years, whether it\u2019s legislation you have sponsored or work you have done in other ways to improve your community.\n\nMy wife and I were blessed to be able to adopt our second son two years ago, literally a week before the last election. We\u2019re very committed to our community and blessed to raise a family here.\n\nDuring COVID, I\u2019ve been active running food drives that collected thousands of pounds of food and thousands of dollars for our local St. Vincent De Paul Societies. I\u2019ve also been handling requests from local residents who weren\u2019t able to get help from the Costa Howard district office. And I\u2019ve been putting out informational Facebook Live videos that have received tens of thousands of views, on a variety of topics of interest to our district.\n\nAt the end of last year, after our community suffered a spate of over-valuations on local properties, I put on multiple emergency property tax seminars, along with working directly with residents, to help folks get their assessments and taxes lowered. Ms. Costa Howard was not responsive to the needs of these residents, who are literally being taxed out of their homes.\n\nIn my professional capacity, I\u2019ve worked hard to assist churches to be able to open safely, with precautions, to enjoy the status that other \u201cessential places\u201d have had. My wife and I also participate with both time and treasure to many of the civic organizations in my community.\n\n7. Please list three concerns that are specific to your district, such as a project that should be undertaken or a state policy related to an important local issue that should be revised.\n\nThe people and businesses of our district are burdened the most by out-of-control spending and taxes, onerous mandates on businesses and local governments, and rampant corruption. We can\u2019t recover quickly and fully from COVID while suffering under these burdens.\n\nYet all of them have been made worse by Terra Costa Howard: she supported unbalanced budgets, new mandates on local businesses, and voted for Madigan for House Speaker. Costa Howard told voters during her 2018 campaign that she\u2019d be for \u201cfiscal responsibility\u201d and \u201csmall business,\u201d but once she got to Springfield, her voting record was the exact opposite.\n\nCosta Howard even voted against a proposal to stop the conflicts of interest in General Assembly members, like Mike Madigan, writing the property tax laws and then raking in millions doing property tax appeals. The Chicago City Council banned that practice, in response to the Ed Burke prosecution, but Costa Howard rejected reform and stood with Madigan.\n\nFor our district, I\u2019ve succeeded in securing relief when state action was required. Whether it was securing IDOT approval for the new Mariano\u2019s on Roosevelt Rd in Lombard; helping a local nonprofit, SCARCE, with a law allowing it to collect cooking grease and oil; or changing state law to allow Noon Whistle Brewing to use innovative \u201c360-lid\u201d technology (allowing removal of nearly all the top of a beverage can, making it more like a cup), I got the job done.\n\n8. What are your other top legislative priorities?\n\nToo many Illinoisans feel they must uproot and leave the state they call home. We are now at six straight years of losing residents to other states, losing over 100,000 people net in just the past two years. Every person who leaves takes their hopes and dreams and contributions with them, pulling vitality and energy away from Illinois.\n\nAnd the latest data shows we\u2019re not just losing seniors\u2014it\u2019s prime working-age residents who are leading the exodus. Residents are taxed out of their homes, or are just tired of supporting a state government they see as disconnected and corrupt. Students are heading to college out of state, never to return. Families are packing up for places with more and better paying jobs.\n\nThe solutions are not easy, but they are simple. Lower the tax burden on our residents and businesses\u2014both income taxes and property taxes have to come down. Stop out-of-control spending at the state level, which is driving tax and fee increases. Embrace reform measures like Fair Maps and Term Limits, to ensure we have citizen legislators representing whole communities, not sliced up narrow groups of partisans. Our broken state government is the primary obstacle standing in the way of turning our state around.\n\n9. What is your position on Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s proposed graduated income tax? Please explain.\n\nI stand firmly against the graduated income tax. My greatest reason comes from my experience in the General Assembly, where I saw first-hand the amount of wasteful spending and poor fiscal policy being implemented in the state. The budgets passed always exceeded our anticipated income, and even those income numbers were artificially inflated as part of an obscene effort to call these budgets \u201cbalanced.\u201d They never were. In a state with an insatiable appetite for spending, feeding more hard-earned taxpayer money into that corrupt process is not the solution.\n\nOur entire budgeting process should be overhauled, a zero-based budget starting with a clean slate. There are numerous programs which are simply routinely re-appropriated, without careful assessment of effectiveness or necessity. They often become silos of money for discretionary spending, and they are rife for corruption. Before anyone asks an Illinois taxpayer for a single penny more, there should be an absolutely full accounting of all of the money this state already raises through every tax and fee we already levy. We\u2019re in recovery mode. Consumers will be a huge part of that. Taking away more money isn\u2019t the way to encourage growth.\n\n10. Illinois continues to struggle financially, with a backlog of unpaid bills. In addition to a progressive state income tax \u2014 or in lieu of such a tax \u2014 what should the state do to pay its bills, meet its pension obligations and fund core services such as higher education?\n\nAs stated before, this state needs to re-examine every dollar we are spending now. Illinois should do what any entity should do when they are spending more than they take in: reform, and spend less.\n\nIllinois government needs to innovate with a view to 2030, not 1830. Advancements in technology should lead to lower expense, not greater, but there\u2019s never a solution proposed in this state that doesn\u2019t include a tax hike. That\u2019s the first and only solution ever considered.\n\nThere also needs to be a very serious and fair discussion with relation to pension funds. These have become an eternal issue with no solvent funding solution in place. I lose sleep over the fact that these funds won\u2019t be there for people who have been made promises that are fiscally impossible to keep. I believe that before we can solve this problem, we have to stop the bleeding first. There are some measures with the tier system that have helped a little bit, but are still inadequate. For everyone\u2019s sake, including pensioners who deserve security and certainty, a fair, equitable set of agreements to tackle this dire issue over a reasonable period of time is the only realistic solution.\n\nAs for \u201ccore services\u201d, we need to narrowly define them and fund them properly. This area of funding suffers more than any other as they don\u2019t enjoy the auto-reappropriation so many other elements of the state budget do. The whole budget needs to be re-imagined and re-examined starting with a fresh balance sheet.\n\n11. Should Illinois consider taxing the retirement incomes of its very wealthiest residents, as most states do? And your argument is?\n\nThere aren\u2019t many incentives to remaining an Illinoisan. The policy of not taxing retirement income is among the few incentives any resident of Illinois has to stay here. If we were to selectively consider taxing retirement income, who would decide who is wealthy? Who would decide the rates? Who would decide when those rates should change, because Illinois still continues to spend more than it takes in? We know who. The same General Assembly that put us in the fiscal morass we\u2019re stuck in. Who would trust them to make those decisions? To make my answer clear: No, Illinois should not consider this.\n\n12. What can Illinois do to improve its elementary and high schools?\n\nIllinois schools spend double the national average on administration\u2014we have to move that money back to the classroom. And the state imposes numerous unfunded mandates that hike costs for local school districts.\n\nI put forward a bill to cap administrative spending at the national average, which would free up hundreds of millions of dollars for classroom needs and property tax relief. Whether this efficiency is achieved by consolidating districts or sharing administrative costs, this is a huge sum of money being wasted in our state.\n\nWhen I review our standards, I believe they\u2019re high enough, but we\u2019re not meeting them. There needs to be more accountability for doing so. We are in a financial crisis in this state that affects everyone, including school districts. It very much affects the families sending these students to schools. The funding of schools has experienced years of band-aid approaches, special legislation and a completely non-comprehensive approach.\n\nAt present, we\u2019re not even sure if schools are going to open this school year or how. I\u2019m a public high school graduate. I was fortunate to get an outstanding education and go on to very strong universities with that foundation. I don\u2019t believe that is the case for many of our students today.\n\nThe only way to truly improve schools is by actively reforming our education policy, cognizant of the needs of the various regions of the state, and with the full participation of all of the stakeholders in the process. That simply hasn\u2019t been done. There are too many golden calves, resulting in winners and losers with every partial-reform effort enacted. Too often the losers were a set of students in one part or the state or the other, or worse, everywhere. Educators are smart people by nature and experience. This is a solvable problem.\n\n13. Mass shootings and gun violence plague America. What can or should the Legislature do, if anything, to address this problem in Illinois?\n\nWe\u2019ve had selected success and failure with this issue in Illinois. It\u2019s both heart-breaking and frustrating to see our state on the national news every night reporting the most recent tally of shootings and killings in Chicago. The city has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, and despite that, there are no shortage of guns or tragic carnage there. The General Assembly has also already tightened gun regulations to be some of the toughest in the country.\n\nThe other side of the equation is policing and prosecuting those misusing firearms. For instance, I have worked closely with our DuPage State\u2019s Attorney, Bob Berlin, on a variety of legislative measures, including enhancing penalties for those who commit crimes and then jump bail. Historically, DuPage has seen as much as 50% of felonies committed by individuals from outside the county, so laws like this one would give our prosecutors the tools they need to discourage crime locally.\n\n14. Do you favor or oppose term limits for any elected official in Illinois? Please explain.\n\nI am in favor of term limits. Legislators do need enough time to become effective and not let the permanent establishment of staff operate the government. In the State of Illinois, with the way legislative maps are gerrymandered, elections do not serve the function as term limits as it was intended. I believe strongly in a Citizen Legislature for a carefully prescribed period of service.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason a statewide official should serve more than 2 terms (8 years). And 8-10 years for Legislators in the State Senate or General Assembly is plenty. Controlled, centralized power for too long of a period is a recipe for corruption: we are watching this play out on our television screens as more and more long-serving members of the Illinois General Assembly are charged with various federal crimes.\n\n15. Everybody says gerrymandering is bad, but the party in power in every state \u2014 Democrats in Illinois \u2014 resist doing anything about it. Or do we have that wrong? What should be done?\n\nYou have it right. It is bad. Fortunately, more and more, the people of Illinois view gerrymandering to be unconstitutional and wrong. I drafted and championed a Fair Maps Amendment, presented as a citizen initiative, because of the block put on Fair Maps by the Democratic Party of Illinois. (We had over 10,000 signatures gathered, before being abruptly halted by the coronavirus.)\n\nEvery few years, you see cynical attempts by electorally vulnerable Democrats to file fair maps amendments, knowing full well these efforts will never see the light of day. We saw it in 2016 when then-Rep. Jack Franks was allowed to bring his amendment to the House Floor (where it garnered 105 votes), with the understanding that the Senate would not take it up. And we saw Ms. Costa Howard do the same thing this year, filing another dead-on-arrival amendment just two months before the deadline.\n\nWhat should be done? The media, private industry, and good-government groups should coalesce behind a citizen initiative that meets the requirements of the Illinois Constitution. My Fair Maps Amendment is one legally rock-solid way to meet those stringent requirements. Any system would be better than the current one.\n\n16. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Chicago is investigating possible official corruption by state and local officials. This prompted the Legislature to pass an ethics reform measure to amend the Lobbyist Registration Act (SB 1639). It was signed into law in December. What\u2019s your take on this and what more should be done?\n\nAs I noted previously, we need an all-of-the-above approach to ethics reform, starting with term limits. There are plenty of ideas out there, and if we need more, we can look to the many other states that are known for clean government, like Iowa and Wisconsin.\n\n17. When people use the internet and wireless devices, companies collect data about us. Oftentimes, the information is sold to other companies, which can use it to track our movements or invade our privacy in other ways. When companies share this data, we also face a greater risk of identity theft. What should the Legislature do, if anything?\n\nIllinois currently has some of the toughest laws in the country around information privacy. Even so, we can always be open to addressing the privacy challenges presented by tech advancements. For instance, the issues relating to Tik Tok and its undisclosed scraping of user data may present areas for us to legislate in Illinois, if the federal government does not act.\n\nThe General Assembly is severely lacking in the experience necessary to meet the challenges presented by emerging technology: I bring unique training and experience in computer science and telecommunications to bear on these issues. Voices like mine are missing from the General Assembly.\n\n18. The number of Illinois public high school graduates who enroll in out-of-state universities continues to climb. What can Illinois do to make its state universities more attractive to Illinois high school students?\n\nEvery Illinoisan deserves the opportunity to attend college or a trade school, and to graduate without debt. A big reason people leave Illinois for out of state institutions is the cost of education here. We are not as competitive as other state university systems. In my district, many students choose universities in Indiana, Iowa, or Missouri, instead of staying here. With few financial incentives available, U of I is also difficult for many of our best students to attend. Other states have aggressively recruited in Illinois and provided financing, to cherry pick our best students.\n\nParents also have a role in how students make these choices. They want what\u2019s best for their children, and because of the problems afflicting Illinois, many parents urge their kids to go elsewhere. Illinois needs to live up to the standard that \u201canything is possible\u201d to pursue and prosper here. This is another area where our state\u2019s horrible fiscal condition is negatively affecting us. All this adds up to students choosing less expensive, top-flight schools in other states, with better fiscal management and opportunity.\n\n19. What is your top legislative priority with respect to the environment?\n\nI\u2019m a husband and father of 2 little boys. Clean air and clean water are our most important environmental considerations. I am proud to have been one of the few Republicans regularly rated 100% by the Illinois Environmental Council.\n\nAs well, being the only person with an Electrical Engineering background in the General Assembly, I repeatedly worked with environmental groups to responsibly move Illinois to low- and zero-emissions energy. Illinois is recognized as a national leader in the field today, due to our efforts on that front.\n\n20. What historical figure from Illinois, other than Abraham Lincoln (because everybody\u2019s big on Abe), do you most admire or draw inspiration from? Please explain.\n\nI\u2019d choose the \u201cGreat Communicator,\u201d Ronald Reagan, since I can\u2019t pick Abraham Lincoln. Growing up, we knew President Reagan as a calm, upbeat presence for our country. He fought hard for his principles, but he united folks across partisan lines and was focused on getting things done. We could use more leaders like him today.\n\n21. What\u2019s your favorite TV, streaming or web-based show of all time. Why?\n\nAll-time would probably be Doctor Who. Some seasons are better than others, but the fact that the whole main cast changes every few years keeps up the variety of the show. You get something to latch onto with each crew. The show is wickedly funny and creative, and often bends your brain.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/league/126401189/kiwi-skills-coach-peter-breen-helping-melbourne-storm-kick-on-postcameron-smith", "page_content": "Ryan Papenhuyzen took on the goal-kicking duties for Melbourne this season after the retirement of Cameron Smith.\n\nLife after Cameron Smith has been largely seamless for the Melbourne Storm, as a trip to another NRL preliminary final shows, but it's taken a collective effort.\n\nThat was always going to be the case when replacing one of the all-time greats.\n\nJesse Bromwich and Dale Finucane assumed the captaincy Smith held alone since 2008. Brandon Smith and Harry Grant essentially share his old position of hooker, while all the spine have taken on more responsibility directing the team.\n\nWhich leaves the goal kicking. Of the many duties Smith performed across his incredible 19-year career, the Immortal-in-waiting's work off the tee was probably his most underrated asset to the casual fan. Not that the Storm were guilty of such a thing when getting their next batch of goal-kickers up to speed.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* NRL: Harry Grant happy to be on the bench so Brandon Smith can stay at the Storm\n\n* There's no real reason why next year shouldn't be the Warriors' year\n\n* 'Attacking dynamite': Reece Walsh in head-to-head battle with Sam Walker for NRL's rookie of the year\n\n\n\nEnter former Otago and Northland rugby player Peter Breen, who was brought in as kicking coach in the pre-season, joining an already healthy Kiwi presence on board for Melbourne's title defence.\n\n\"Obviously Cameron Smith retired and he\u2019d been the kicker for however long he\u2019d been at the Storm, so no one else ever had to think about it,\" Breen told Stuff.\n\nRob Jefferies/Getty Images Peter Breen played for Otago and Northland in the NPC.\n\n\"I had done some work with (Storm fullback) Ryan Papenhuyzen previously and he must\u2019ve mentioned my name. Frank Ponissi, the general manager, calls up and says we\u2019d love for you to come in for a six-week stint and do some work with the boys. It was really good, I went in there and went hard with it all.\"\n\nBreen's relationship with Papenhuyzen started through his online coaching and kicking tee company Ruby Bricks, which has a strong following in the 15-man code.\n\nBut be it union or league, you simply can't put a price on a reliable goal-kicker, particularly at this time of the year.\n\nWhile Breen found the Storm kickers to be less structured in their approach, he didn't have to make major changes for the results to flow, with Papenhuyzen and Nicho Hynes converting at 86 per cent and 74 per cent respectively this season.\n\nWorking off his \"10 pillar principle\", Breen focused on streamlining their process; making small tweaks that when performed right can make a huge difference to the outcome of a game.\n\n\"All we tried to do was just organise their techniques a bit better \u2013 their approach, their ball set-up, all the little details,\" he said. \"Guys like Ryan and Nicho Hynes had some real good success just by getting organised.\n\n\"We go through your kicking technique based on the 10 pillars and Ryan\u2019s a thought-out guy. He just loves detail, loves process and he understands why he misses now and what the fix is within his technique, so that\u2019s been really exciting.\"\n\nBreen also assists with kicking in general play and highlighted the progress of Kiwi Jahrome Hughes, whose pinpoint kicking game has been essential to his rise as one of the leading halfbacks in the NRL.\n\nWill Russell/Getty Images Peter Breen during his time as attack coach for the Australian women's rugby team.\n\n\"He\u2019s really excelled this year with his kicking game.\n\n\"As soon as he stayed in the kick for longer, let his leg get full extension, got off the ground with his high kicks, he was getting more height, hang-time and distance, which then gives the kick-chase more time. That was a real win for him and I\u2019m stoked because he\u2019s kicking so well now. He understands that he\u2019s got to finish his job of the kick rather than bracing.\n\n\"And I think when you start doing things well they snowball positively.\"\n\nLast week\u2019s victory over Manly left the Storm one win away from a fifth grand final in six years. They meet the winner of Saturday night\u2019s playoff between Penrith and Parramatta in the preliminary final this weekend.\n\nWhile the bulk of his coaching was done in the first block of the season, the NRL's relocation to Queensland meant the Melbourne-based Breen, who was also the attack coach for the Australia women\u2019s rugby team, has had to communicate with players online.\n\nThat is right in his wheelhouse thanks to Rugby Bricks, which he founded in Dunedin in 2017 by taking skills coaching to social media.\n\nRugby Bricks now has more than 140,000 followers on Instagram and their New Zealand-made kicking tees are widely used by professional rugby players around the world, including Quade Cooper during last week's match-winning comeback for the Wallabies. They are popping up more and more in the NRL and his partnership with Melbourne has continued with a Storm-branded tee.\n\nIn another innovative move, Rugby Bricks are believed to be among the first organisations in the sport to enter the NFT space.\n\nBreen on Friday launched his first kicking tee as an NFT, or non-fungible token, the latest trend in the crypto-economy and touted as the digital answer to collectibles.\n\n\"Another way to look at it is like Pok\u00e9mon Go, when everyone was running around with that massive craze collecting digitally, and that\u2019s exactly what NFTs are coming into this space,\" he said.\n\n\"We\u2019re releasing are own NFTs online which are a collectable.

Ivey supported school choice in a 2018 Alabama Policy Institute candidate survey: \u201cAs president of the Board of Education, an intimate knowledge of the education system is critical to our children\u2019s success and ultimately the success of this great state. As a former teacher, I appreciate the benefits of school choice. School choice provides healthy competition, and competition can effectively raise student performance, teacher attendance, and financial management. As a conservative leader, I will always support and empower local administrators.\u201d\n\nALASKA\n\nMike Dunleavy (R)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: YES\n\nDunleavy served as both a state senator and an elected school board member in the Mat-Su School District before his election as Governor. Prior to that, he worked as a teacher in rural Alaska for 19 years. Dunleavy was the sponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 9, which would have allowed for school choice programs to be utilized in Alaska. He is often cited as a school choice supporter and champion.\n\nBefore his election, Dunleavy told the Anchorage Daily News, \u201cI was a strong advocate in the Senate for giving parents the flexibility to achieve the best outcome for their children. Parents know their children\u2019s unique educational needs; there is not a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach. With that said, my focus will be on improving outcomes in our public schools, where I served for decades as a teacher, principal, superintendent, and school board member.\u201d\n\nARIZONA\n\nDoug Ducey (R)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: YES\n\nEducational choice has been a top priority for Ducey since taking office. \u201cIt will be a first principle of my agenda that schools and choices available to affluent parents must be open to all parents, whatever their means, wherever they live, period,\u201d he said during his inaugural address in 2015.\n\nAs Governor, Ducey signed the universal expansion of the state\u2019s Empowerment Scholarship Accounts, which would have allowed any student to use an ESA account to pay for private school tuition or for other educational expenses. The expansion was rolled back in the 2018 election, but Ducey easily won re-election.\n\nARKANSAS\n\nAsa Hutchison (R)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: UNCLEAR\n\nIn 2015, Hutchison signed the Succeed Scholarship Program, the state\u2019s first private school program for special needs students. He openly supports charter schools, but his public record on private school choice is mixed.\n\nHutchison opposed the Arkansas Parental Empowerment for Education Choice Act of 2017, which would have allowed nonprofits to establish education savings accounts for eligible students funded by tax-deductible donations. \u201cI will oppose the bill based upon that revenue hit because that\u2019s not in budget,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a strong proponent of choice. As everyone knows, I\u2019ve had children go to public school, private school, Christian school, homeschool, and those are choices that parents make, but we have an obligation for the public school system of Arkansas to make sure it\u2019s adequately funded.\u201d\n\nAt a National School Choice Week event in 2018, Hutchison told the crowd that \u201c[c]hoice in education is important as a matter of freedom; it is important as a matter of competition.

His 2018 platform promised expansions of community schools, but does not specify which types of schools. It is unclear whether he supports private school choice measures.\n\nAt an East Area Progressive Democrats meeting in Los Angeles in September 2017, Newsom said, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in the stale and raging debate about which side, which camp you\u2019re on \u2013 are you with the charter people, are you anti-charter, are you with the teachers, are you anti-teacher. I\u2019ve been hearing that damn debate for ten damn years. With all due respect, I got four kids. I have an eight year old, second grade. I have a five, three and a one year old. I\u2019m not gonna wait around until they\u2019ve all graduated to resolve whether Eli Broad was right or whether or not the CTA was wrong. I\u2019m not interested in that debate. I\u2019m interested in shaping a different conversation around a 21st century education system that brings people together, that could shape public opinion, not just here in the state, but could shape an agenda more broadly across the country, particularly in a time of Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump.

He sends at least one of his children to private school.\n\nThe Colorado Independent reported him saying, \u201cParents value choice in public education, and districts and charter schools offer a variety of options. What I care about is quality. I do not support vouchers going to unaccountable private schools and have opposed for-profit education throughout my entire career. I believe that public charter schools should be held accountable to the same budgetary, academic, and financial transparency as neighborhood public schools.\u201d\n\nFollowing his election, Polis named several education reformers to his transition team: \u201cThe Polis education team \u2014 one of seven teams whose members were announced Friday \u2014 includes Jen Walmer, director of Democrats for Education Reform (DFER), a political group that advocates for charter schools.

Bob Schaffer, a Republican advocate for taxpayer-funded vouchers for private schools and formerly a member of the state board of education.\u201d\n\nCONNECTICUT\n\nNed Lamont (D)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: UNCLEAR\n\nIn a 2006 interview on The Randi Rhodes Show, Lamont said this in response to a question about his perspective on school vouchers: \u201cOne, I believe in a strong community public school system. Anything that distracts from that is a step in the wrong direction and does a disservice to our kids. And two, we\u2019ve got to get the community involved in our schools. We need more parents, we need more coaches, we need more drama students, more drama instructors to help these kids, get them back into the classroom, to get them to believe that they can do it. We really are not doing that right now for our kids.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear where he stands on private school choice now in 2018.\n\nFLORIDA\n\nRon DeSantis (R)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: YES\n\nDeSantis\u2019s campaign website states his intention to expand choice efforts in Florida: \u201cFlorida\u2019s education success story was made possible by allowing for innovation in education coupled with choice for families and public accountability. Ron DeSantis will build on these successful reforms and not allow our education system to slide backwards. Ron DeSantis will work tirelessly to make Florida a world-class leader on education.\u201d\n\nGEORGIA\n\nBrian Kemp (R)*\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: YES\n\nKemp is a strong supporter of educational choice. His campaign website clearly states his position: \u201cAs a State Senator, I co-sponsored one of the early charter school bills. During my two terms in office, I fought to enhance educational outcomes through school choice. As governor, I will build on that record by doubling the SSO tax credit, supporting equitable charter school funding, and piloting an ESA program with military families. School choice means trusting parents and putting students first. As a father of 3 teenage daughters, I never want my children\u2014or anyone\u2019s children\u2014to be trapped in a failing school or a bad situation. We must always have an education system that trusts parents and allows us to decide what\u2019s best for our kids.\u201d\n\nHAWAII\n\nDavid Ige (D)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: UNCLEAR\n\nOn Ige\u2019s campaign website, he does not mention private school choice. However, Ige has noted his support of public school choice (via charter schools) on his past campaign websites: \u201cAs chair of the House Education Committee, David introduced an omnibus education bill that gave schools more authority and autonomy by emphasizing Children First. He has also helped pass legislation that allows fiscal flexibility, ensures assessment and accountability, encourages school innovation, and improves our school facilities. David also authored the first laws creating charter schools in Hawaii.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Ige did oppose a preschool proposal because it would allow parents to send public funds to private providers.\n\nThis year, his campaign has focused on expanding support and options to students in higher education.\n\nIDAHO\n\nBrad Little (R)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: NO\n\nLittle does not support private school choice and has said he is skeptical of a tax-credit scholarship program that has previously passed in the state assembly.\n\nLittle told The74Million.org during the campaign that \u201c[a]nytime you do anything that moves the amount of money that\u2019s ready to go into the pool for K-12 spending, I\u2019ve always had an issue with. And some of the voucher proposals I\u2019ve seen are pretty significant.\u201d\n\nILLINOIS\n\nJ.B. Pritzker (D)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: NO\n\nIn Chalkbeat, Pritzker said, \u201cA quality public education system that improves the well-being of every child and prepares them for the jobs of tomorrow is essential to our state and our future. I oppose diverting public education funds to private schools and I oppose school vouchers.\n\n\u201cWe need to impose a moratorium on charter school expansion. With public schools inadequately funded, I oppose taking state money away from public schools for private school tax credits.\u201d\n\nIOWA\n\nKim Reynolds (R)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: YES\n\nIn her 2018 Condition of the State address, Reynolds said, \u201cWe have also maintained our commitment to school choice, which offers families the option to teach their values, beliefs, and viewpoints to their children. That\u2019s why my tax reform plan will expand 529 plans to include K-12 education.\u201d\n\nIn 2018 Governor Reynolds signed a proclamation for National School Choice week.\n\nKANSAS\n\nLaura Kelly (D)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: NO\n\nIn her 2018 questionnaire to the Kansas School Boards Association Governor-elect Kelly stated, \u201cI do not believe that public money should go to support students in private schools, rather those funds should be invested in Kansas\u2019 public education system. Tax credits, vouchers and scholarships to private school students lack oversight and fairness, and should not be a part of Kansas\u2019s education budget. \u201c\n\nMAINE\n\nJanet Mills (D)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: NO\n\nMills has firmly stated she opposes both private and public school choice: \u201cI firmly oppose taking tax dollars from the public education system to fund new private or charter schools, and I do not support lifting the cap on new charters. The proposal to allow for ten charter schools in Maine was largely based on the premise that these schools would serve as an experiment. So far, the promise of dramatically higher-quality education has yet to materialize, and I believe it would be premature to expand that experiment without positive results.\u201d\n\nMARYLAND\n\nLarry Hogan (R)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: YES\n\nIn 2017, when he signed a $1 million increase in the state\u2019s tax credit scholarship program, Hogan stated, \u201cOur administration is proud to support the BOOST Program and to expand it to provide opportunities for even more children again this year.\u201d\n\nMASSACHUSETTS\n\nCharles Baker (R)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: UNCLEAR\n\nGov. Charlie Baker (R) has not publicly stated whether he supports or opposes private school choice, but he does support increasing the number of charter schools in the state: \u201cWe have 20 years of experience with charter schools that has been proven to be a success.\u201d\n\nMICHIGAN\n\nGretchen Whitmer (D)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: NO\n\nWhitmer\u2019s K-12 agenda was largely based on opposition to U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, a Michigan native and longtime school choice advocate. Whitmer wrote in an op-ed piece before the election: \u201cA generation ago, Michigan led the world in public education. This was the state families packed up and moved to because parents knew their children could get a quality education and the skills they needed to get a good-paying job. Education shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue, but Republicans in Lansing have consistently sided with Betsy DeVos to push an education agenda that includes slashing school funding, expanding unaccountable for-profit managed charter schools, over-emphasizing standardized tests, attacking hard-working educators and adopting a one-size-fits-all approach to education.\u201d\n\nMINNESOTA\n\nTim Walz (D)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: NO\n\nOne of the steps to improve education that Walz outlines on his campaign website is, \u201cNix vouchers \u2013 In order to give Minnesota students the best chance at success, we need to keep funding to our public schools, not diverting it into voucher programs.\u201d\n\nNEBRASKA\n\nPete Ricketts (R)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: YES\n\nRicketts is a school choice advocate. He has said that his family was able to choose both Catholic and public schools based on what best fit his children\u2019s needs, but not all families can afford to do that. \u201cThat\u2019s what every parent should have the opportunity of doing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to put a system in place to make that possible.\u201d\n\nNEVADA\n\nSteve Sisolak (D)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: NO\n\nSisolak\u2019s campaign website says he, \u201cwill work to increase funding, give educators a much-needed raise, and reduce class sizes while fighting against any efforts to divert public funding to private schools.\u201d\n\nNEW HAMPSHIRE\n\nChris Sununu (R)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: YES\n\nSununu is a strong supporter of private school choice.

I am proud to stand with students and educators in reminding Secretary DeVos of her responsibility to support public school students and help families and communities thrive.\u201d\n\nNEW YORK\n\nAndrew Cuomo (D)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: UNCLEAR\n\nIn 2015, Cuomo promoted a $150-million education tax-credit plan to support low-income families sending their children to private and parochial schools: \u201cBy rewarding donations that support public schools, providing tax credits for teachers when they purchase classroom supplies out of pocket, and easing the financial burden on families who send their children to independent, parochial, or out-of-district public schools, we can make a fundamental difference in the lives of students, families and educators across the state.\u201d\n\nSince then, according to Politico, reformers\u2019 high hopes for New York\u2014and Cuomo\u2014have fallen flat: \u201cCuomo has prioritized other issues and has reconciled with the city teachers\u2019 union ahead of a rumored presidential bid \u2014 leaving reformers without their most conspicuous champion.\u201d\n\nOHIO\n\nMike DeWine (R)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: YES\n\nIn his gubernatorial campaign, DeWine did not take a public stance on private school choice.\n\nHis campaign education agenda included reducing standardized testing, a more equitable school funding system, increasing access to technology, shared services and more vocational education.\n\nDuring the campaign, DeWine also proposed new regulations for online charter schools, including a pay-for-performance model for electronic schools that would require course completion testing and competency before the school is paid for a student.\n\nWhen he was in the U.S. Senate, DeWine was a strong supporter of the D. C. Opportunity Scholarship Program.\n\nOKLAHOMA\n\nKevin Stitt (R)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: UNCLEAR\n\nStitt is a businessman and political newcomer who has not yet taken a public stance on private school choice.\n\nHis campaign education agenda included increasing teacher pay, standardizing teacher certification, adopting free market health care benefits, cutting red tape at high-performing schools, streamlining data and simplifying the school funding formula.\n\nOREGON\n\nKate Brown (D)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: NO\n\nSchool choice has not historically been an issue in Oregon gubernatorial contests, though the state\u2019s high school graduation rate still lags behind the national average.\n\nBrown\u2019s campaign website states her priorities are \u201cinvesting in our schools to keep students on track to graduate from high school with a plan for their future\u2014and ready for college, job training, or the world of work.\u201d\n\nPENNSYLVANIA\n\nTom Wolf (D)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: NO\n\nWolf did not block efforts to increase funding for Pennsylvania\u2019s tax-credit scholarship program, which gives tax credits to businesses that fund private school scholarships. According to news reports, he obtained some of those credits as a business owner.\n\nBut Wolf vehemently opposes new school choice programs, including a 2017 plan to make education savings accounts available to students in the state\u2019s lowest-performing districts: \u201cThe governor\u2019s spokesman J.J. Abbott said, \u2018Governor Wolf opposes vouchers and any program that diverts precious state funding away from Pennsylvania\u2019s public schools. Governor Wolf has fought tirelessly to increase state funding for public education at all levels by more than $800 million to help districts, teachers and students succeed. Taking funding away from public schools would only further the inequity and inadequacy of state funding for local education and could lead to property tax increases, as funding cuts did under the last administration.\u2019\u201d\n\nRHODE ISLAND\n\nGina Raimondo (D)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: NO\n\nIn 2016, Raimondo introduced a plan for more public school choice in Rhode Island.

Empowerment Schools could choose a special focus, like dual language or science.\u201d The schools would be required to enroll neighborhood students first.\n\nIn her first term, she also threatened to veto a bill that would have required local approval for new charter schools to be built or existing ones to expand. \u201cI would veto a bill that had the practical effect of killing charters,\u201d Raimondo said at the time.\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA\n\nHenry McMaster (R)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: YES\n\nOn his campaign website, McMaster stated that \u201c[r]obust charter schools allow parents to choose the best educational opportunities for their children. We need more of them, and more transportation options to better facilitate school choice.\u201d\n\nA story in the state\u2019s capital newspaper shortly before the election noted that \u201cMcMaster also supports private-school choice and expansion of public-school choice options, proposing in his 2018-19 executive budget more money for public charter schools.\u201d\n\nSOUTH DAKOTA\n\nKristi Noem (R)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: YES\n\nNoem, the state\u2019s first female governor, said \u201c[a]s a conservative, I will protect the rights of parents to choose the educational path that\u2019s best for their child, whether it\u2019s homeschooling, public schooling or a private education.\u201d\n\nThe74Million.org reported after the election that \u201c[t]o improve education in the state, [Noem] favors school choice, though South Dakota is one of just a few states without charter schools.

On the campaign trail, he praised policies that give parents more school choices and said that vouchers \u2014 which use public dollars to pay for private schools \u2014 have potential in a state that has repeatedly rebuffed voucher legislation.\u201d\n\nTEXAS\n\nGreg Abbott (R)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: YES\n\nAt a National School Choice Week rally in 2017, Abbott told the crowd, \u201cEvery parent deserves choices about where they will send their child to school. All these parents know this isn\u2019t a Republican issue, it\u2019s not a Democrat issue. This is a civil rights issue.\u201d\n\nThe policy section of the Governor\u2019s official website states: \u201cEducation is essential to preserve liberty. We must continue to invest in early education and higher education, and expand school choice in Texas. Our goal is to give teachers the tools and resources they need to help our children succeed.\u201d\n\nVERMONT\n\nPhil Scott (R)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: YES\n\nVermont is home to the oldest school choice program in America.

They have to be our priority. When we aren\u2019t adequately funding our public schools, how can we possibly afford a parallel publicly funded private school system?\u201d\n\nWYOMING\n\nMark Gordon (R)\n\nPrivate School Choice Supporter: YES"}]}
