Swanson believed laboratories weren't the only source of new scientific discoveries. Swanson, a specialist in the relationship between natural and computer languages, thought electronic databases also held the key to medical knowledge.\n\nA trailblazing information scientist, Swanson died Nov. 18 at age 88.\n\nConcerned that excessive specialization could inhibit scientific creativity, Swanson pioneered the field of literature-based discovery, which uses existing research to create new knowledge. The three-term dean of the University\u2019s Graduate Library School and professor emeritus in the Humanities Division believed that unearthing unseen links between two distinct areas of study could yield new discoveries\u2014what he called \u201cundiscovered public knowledge.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, Swanson received the ASIST Award of Merit, the highest honor from the American Society for Information Science & Technology, for his work.\n\nArrowsmith: \u2018An intellectual adventure\u2019\n\nSwanson famously tested his theory of undiscovered public knowledge with a 1986 paper in which he made a provocative connection between dietary fish oil and Raynaud\u2019s disease, a circulatory disorder.\n\nIn a search of the Medline database, which houses millions of scientific journal abstracts, Swanson found a common thread in research on Raynaud's disease and dietary fish oil. His hunting turned up numerous articles that described high blood viscosity in patients with Raynaud\u2019s disease; in a separate search, he found a body of research that showed dietary fish oil could reduce blood viscosity.\n\nThe implication of bringing these two literatures together was powerful: could fish oil, Swanson wondered, be used to treat Raynaud\u2019s disease?\n\nA clinical trial three years later validated the use of fish oil for patients with Raynaud\u2019s disease. Swanson later hypothesized a connection between migraine headaches and magnesium deficiency that was also subsequently supported by clinical research.\n\nSpurred on by these findings, Swanson and Neil Smalheiser of the University of Illinois at Chicago developed Arrowsmith, a piece of software that assists investigators in identifying connections between two sets of Medline articles.\n\nArrowsmith (named after the 1925 Sinclair Lewis novel) was aimed at building a \u201csystematic, computational\u201d method to find possible links among articles, Smalheiser said. \u201cThe computer was not supposed to generate discoveries, but it was supposed to identify and put together these potential assertions.\u201d\n\nThe Arrowsmith model proved influential, and the approach Swanson and Smalheiser developed has been adapted to study the correlations of genes with diseases and find possible new uses for medications.\n\nDespite the impact of Swanson and Smalheiser's work on Arrowsmith, \u201cWe never saw it as anything other than an intellectual adventure,\u201d Smalheiser said.\n\n\u2018Experiments with information\u2019 not salamanders\n\n\u201cDon was doing science, without dissecting a salamander,\u201d said Mark Olsen, assistant director of the American and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language (ARTFL) project, a major digital humanities project that was influenced by Swanson\u2019s work. \u201cHe was doing experiments with information.\u201d\n\nSwanson began his career studying physics as an undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology. He received his MA in physics from Rice University in 1947 and his PhD, also in physics, from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1952.\n\nEven in their early days, computers were a source of fascination for Swanson. \u201cI think he was always dazzled by the idea of the computer,\u201d said his wife, Patricia Swanson.\n\nSwanson worked as a computer systems analyst at Hughes Research & Development and research scientist at Ramo-Wooldridge Corp. & TRW, Inc., before he joined the UChicago faculty in 1963 as dean of the Graduate Library School (which closed in 1990). Swanson's background as a physical scientist set him apart from the seven previous deans of the school, who represented a variety of other disciplines.\n\nAt the GLS, Swanson initially focused on computer-aided information retrieval, an entirely new area of study at the time.\n\n\u201cAt the time Don began working on it, people simply couldn\u2019t imagine that you could retrieve information with a computer,\u201d said his colleague Abe Bookstein, professor emeritus in the Humanities. \u201cIn a field that was very qualitative, Don was instrumental in introducing quantitative formal techniques.\u201d\n\nHe was also a rigorous and encouraging teacher, according to his former GLS student Charles Blair, who remembered Swanson for his \u201cvery clean, organized and methodical approach to his subject.\u201d\n\nSwanson happily lent his expertise to colleagues around the University. In the early days of the ARTFL project, Prof. Robert Morrissey came to Swanson for advice on how to handle organization of the massive new database. \u201cHe told me, \u2018What this project needs is a little sunshine and water,\u201d remembered Morrissey, the Benjamin Franklin Professor of French Literature and director of ARTFL. \u201cHe was very generous with his time.\u201d\n\nThat generosity was not unusual for Swanson, according to Smalheiser\u2014Swanson went \u201cout of his way to be nice and encouraging,\u201d Smalheiser said.\n\nSwanson\u2019s quiet manner belied a mischievous sense of humor that led him to write satiric articles, for example, \u201cNew Horizons in Psychoanalysis: Treatment of Necrosistic Personality Disorders,\u201d in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine (1986).\n\nNot only intellectually witty but also physically fit, Swanson was an avid runner who completed a half-marathon at the age of 80.\n\nBut his work was by far his greatest passion, according to Patricia Swanson. \u201cHe was always trying to do something better,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Swanson is survived by his son, Richard B. Swanson; and his daughter, Judith A. Swanson, PhD\u201987. Another son, Douglas A. Swanson, died in 2004.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Swanson\u2019s honor may be made to the University of Chicago Library, the Nature Conservancy or the Heritage Foundation."}, {"url": "http://manu47.magtech.com.cn/Jwk3_jdis/EN/10.1515/jdis-2017-0019", "page_content": "Rediscovering Don Swanson: The Past, Present and Future of Literature-based Discovery\n\nNeil R.

Swanson (1924\u20132012) was well appreciated during his lifetime as Dean of the Graduate Library School at University of Chicago, as winner of the American Society for Information Science Award of Merit for 2000, and as author of many seminal articles (Figure 1). Don became Emeritus in 1996, but did not truly retire until around 2007, when he suffered a series of strokes. Around 10 years ago, Tanja Bekhuis (2006) wrote a review article that discussed Don\u2019s contributions and their subsequent influence on bioinformatics and text mining. Recently, Sebastian, Siew, & Orimaye (2017a) have published a comprehensive review from a technical standpoint, and the reader is urged to consult this article for an overview of existing and emerging methods that are being applied to the field of literature-based discovery. Here I give a more personal perspective. In particular, I will include a discussion of problems and issues which were inherent in Don\u2019s thoughts during his life, but which have not yet been fully taken up and studied systematically. Figure 1 Don R. Swanson. The first thing to realize about Don is that Don is not short for Donald. Don was his legal first name. Do not make that mistake, please\u2014it irritated him to no end! The second thing to realize is that my relationship with Don was idyllically intellectual in nature. I call my collaboration with Don my \u201cGarage Band\u201d period\u2014 the term referring to buddies who spend their free time playing rock music in their garages, playing out of sheer enjoyment, and oblivious of the outer world at large. We were unconcerned whether our research would be seen as important by others, whether it would be published in high-impact journals, whether we would secure grant funding, or other non-scientific concerns that too often drive research efforts.\n\n2 Undiscovered Public Knowledge Perhaps the most influential and enduring contribution that Don has had on information science is the concept of \u201cundiscovered public knowledge\u201d (UPK), which he approached from a very broad, philosophical standpoint (Swanson, 1986a). The philosopher of science Karl Popper had envisioned that man exists in three worlds\u2014World I is the objective, real world which scientists seek to learn about; World II includes the thoughts and mental activities of scientists; and World III consists of the products of scientists, in particular, the published articles that express findings, models, assertions, and so forth (Popper, 1978). Just as man cannot hope to have perfect knowledge of reality (World I), Don realized that man cannot have perfect knowledge of World III either. Knowledge can be public (e.g. it is published) and at the same time, inaccessible or imperfectly known for one reason or another. Undiscovered public knowledge encompasses several distinct scenarios. For example, one may ask: How many articles are published that no one reads\u2014no one at all besides the author and (we hope) the reviewers? Information contained in such articles is, indeed, public yet undiscovered. How much information is contained in articles that few can find, because the article is poorly indexed by Web of Science or by online search engines? Such articles may have been published without a digital presence, or placed in a journal that has limited circulation or low visibility. A related type of information loss occurs when someone publishes an important article in an obscure or topically inappropriate journal, so that no one will take the finding seriously even if they see it. Few people have the self-confidence to recognize a breakthrough when it comes without the imprimatur of acceptance by a prestigious journal. An example of this happened quite recently: \u201cThis German retiree solved one of world\u2019s most complex maths problems\u2014and no one noticed\u201d (Wolchover, 2017). Thomas Royen wrote a paper proving the Gaussian correlation inequality (GCI) and posted a preprint in the arXiv repository; when his work failed to get recognized, he chose to get his proof out in an obscure journal called the Far East Journal of Theoretical Statistics . He might as well have put it in a bottle and thrown it in the ocean! Some of my own informatics discoveries have been closely related to undiscovered public knowledge. For example, my group discovered that many mammalian microRNAs are derived from genomic repeat elements in the genome (Smalheiser & Torvik, 2005). Although we came to this realization through computational studies (Smalheiser & Torvik, 2004), in fact, in retrospect, the discovery could have been made simply by inspection of the public data available at the UCSC Genome Browser https://genome.ucsc.edu/ . This website brings together dozens of different types of genomic data that are calculated or measured, for example, predicted transcription factor binding regions, cross-species conservation levels, and so on. Each type of data is superimposed on the reference genome, and users can open up and visualize any number of the data sets to observe them in juxtaposition with each other. Two of the data tracks show a) positions of known microRNA genes in red and b) Repeatmasker output, which identifies genomic repeat elements in two shades of grey (Figure 2). If anyone had opened up these two tracks and looked carefully, they would have seen that many of the microRNAs were within the sequences encompassed entirely by specific genomic repeat elements. The fact that no one DID do this indicates that this knowledge was public, yet undiscovered. Figure 2 Screenshot of UCSC Genome Browser showing the sequence for human mir-95 juxtaposed to tracks for genomic repeats. The genomic region of the mir-95 sequence corresponds to two LINE2 elements in opposite orientations. This provides evidence that, when transcribed into RNA, these LINE2 elements bind each other, creating the hairpin secondary structure that permits the processing of this sequence by enzymes (Drosha & Dicer) to form a microRNA (Smalheiser & Torvik, 2005).\n\n3 Two Medical Literatures Logically but not Bibliographically Connected The most novel and fruitful type of undiscovered public knowledge discussed by Don occurs when information is not explicitly discussed in any single article at all. Rather, different assertions and findings need to be assembled across documents to create a new coherent assertion, much as different pieces of a puzzle are assembled to create a single picture. But how to find these pieces residing in scattered places across the literature, and how to assemble them? Don focused his analyses on first identifying two sets of articles, or literatures, which appear to be complementary (see below) yet are not directly connected to each other. Such literatures are unconnected if they do not have any articles in common, do not have authors in common, and articles in one literature do not cite any articles in the other literature (Swanson, 1987). In a series of articles in the 1980s, Don analyzed two classic examples of medical literatures that were not (or only slightly) connected, yet contained multiple links of the form \u201cA affects B\u201d in one literature and \u201cB affects C\u201d in the other, such that when they were brought together and assembled, created a persuasive, novel hypothesis. These have become widely analyzed benchmarks for nearly all subsequent studies of literature-based discovery. The first case was the set of articles on Raynaud\u2019s disease vs the set of articles on fish oil (Swanson, 1986b). Don noticed that several of the pathological alterations that occur in Raynaud\u2019s disease corresponded to physiological alternations that are produced by ingesting fish oil, only in opposite directions. That suggests that ingesting fish oil should counteract some of the signs and symptoms of Raynaud\u2019s disease. Subsequent clinical studies supported this hypothesis (Swanson, 1993). The second case was the set of articles on dietary magnesium vs on migraine headaches (Swanson, 1988). Again, Don noticed that magnesium deprivation has multiple effects in the body that are similar to alterations that are known to worsen migraine headaches, and magnesium itself has effects which should be expected to prevent or treat migraines. For example, magnesium is a calcium channel blocker, and reduces neuronal excitability via opening of NMDA glutamate receptors. Thus, he proposed that supplementation with dietary magnesium may prevent or alleviate migraines. Again, subsequent clinical studies supported this hypothesis (Swanson, 1993). Don made further analyses of complementary un-connected literatures, both by himself (Swanson, 1990) and in collaboration with me (e.g. Swanson, Smalheiser, & Bookstein, 2001; Smalheiser & Swanson, 1994, 1996a, 1996b, 1998). It is noteworthy that late in his career, Don proposed a link between atrial fibrillation and running (Swanson, 2006). Exercise is known to be a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, and he proposed that this may be mediated by gastroesophageal reflux, which in turn may be alleviated by taking proton pump inhibitors. Besides being another masterful, insightful example of putting together separate pieces of evidence to form a new whole, it is worth mentioning that these analyses were all based on conditions he experienced himself. He had Raynaud\u2019s syndrome, and he had migraine headaches. And, his chronic atrial fibrillation eventually caused his strokes and led to his withdrawal from active life.\n\n4 Use of Implicit Information to Bridge Disparate Literatures It is important to acknowledge a tension between two different meanings of the term \u201cknowledge discovery.\u201d One meaning, the one I started with, is to assemble pieces of information into new wholes, that represent new/promising/surprising/research directions or provide potentially transformative or breakthrough insights. The other meaning is to analyze and synthesize existing data to impute new but otherwise predictable, everyday information. An example of this is using first names to predict the gender of individuals. Most of the \u201cJane\u201d and \u201cLinda\u201d individuals will be female, and most of the \u201cBoris\u201d and \u201cJohn\u201d individuals will be males. But regardless of which type of discovery we are talking about, to my knowledge, all systematic algorithmic methods for knowledge discovery involve linking different literatures or entities via implicit features that they share. In the case of gender prediction, US Census data can be used to associate first names of individuals in the United States with their reported genders; by aggregating the results over all individuals, each first name is associated with a gender balance score (% females/% males). This becomes reference information that is used to impute gender for a given name instance in some other database. The reference information is implicit because it derives from information that is not explicitly present within the database. Commonly, implicit information is used as a bridge to measure the similarity of two entities. For example, two diseases A and B may be related in terms of how many Medical Subject Headings they share (in articles that describe disease A and disease B, respectively). Or, they may be related in terms of how many singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to affect disease risk in both disease A and B. Or, they may be related in terms of how many clinical signs and symptoms they share. Or, how many single-gene mutations which affect disease A or B affect genes that lie in the same biochemical pathway. There are many possible types of implicit information that connect disease A with disease B, and it is even possible to combine multiple types of information to create a heterogeneous graph in which diseases are nodes and implicitly shared items form links between the nodes (Shi et al., 2017). The use of implicit information is a powerful general technique of knowledge discovery, which has spawned several entire fields in bioinformatics and genomics (Bekhuis, 2006; Zweigenbaum et al., 2007). Don is the father of the field of drug repurposing, which proposes new uses for existing approved drugs (e.g. Weeber et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2017). Prediction of adverse drug effects follows a similar type of logic (e.g. Hristovski et al., 2016; Shang et al., 2014), as does detection of co-morbidities and other relations among drugs, diseases, and genes (Ding et al., 2013; Frijters et al., 2010; Vos et al., 2014). Almost all approaches to genomic discovery involve implicit information as well. Furthermore, implicit information is a central concept generally in text mining and natural language processing.\n\n6 The Two-node Search Perhaps the most important limitation of the one-node search is not technical, but sociological: The one-node search is intended to help investigators who are looking for a new hypothesis\u2014yet most investigators are already drowning in a sea of existing potential hypotheses and findings, and their goal is not to find still more hypotheses, but rather to decide which of the existing ones is most promising to pursue. Thus, in my own work, I have emphasized the importance of the two-node search strategy, which can be summarized as follows: An investigator already has a hypothesis (or an experimental finding) that links A and C, but which has not been explicitly investigated directly in any single published article. He or she carries out a two-node search between the set of articles that discusses A and the set of articles that discusses C, and examines the shared title words and phrases B i . The goals are to rank the list of B i -terms to home in on the most relevant and promising links, and to examine possible mechanisms that link A to C. To create a quantitative model that would allow us to rank B i -terms, I assembled a team of neuroscientists, who used the two-node search tool freely in the course of their scientific work. Vetle Torvik and I chose 8 of their searches as a gold standard, in which B i -terms were manually marked as being relevant for linking A to C. Each B i -term (marked as relevant or not relevant) was scored according to eight features (Table 1). These features are domain-independent insofar as they do not rely on any reported knowledge about entities, facts, or relations; rather, they are based on statistical properties such as the frequency of the term within MEDLINE (Table 1; Torvik & Smalheiser, 2007). As a negative control training set, we chose random pairs of query literatures (having similar size and topics as the gold standard set), and scored all B i -terms in the negative set. We created a logistic regression model, based on a weighted sum of these features, to predict the probability that a given B i -term would be marked as relevant, i.e. that it would be deemed relevant by users for linking A and C in a meaningful manner (Torvik & Smalheiser, 2007). Table 1 Eight features used to characterize each B-term. No. Feature 1 Does the B-term occur in more than one paper within literatures A and C? 2 Do the AB and BC sub-literatures share any MeSH terms? 3 Does the B-term map to at least one UMLS semantic category? 4 Does the B-term have a high literature cohesion score? 5 Is the B-term moderately frequent within MEDLINE as a whole? 6 Did the B-term first appear recently within MEDLINE as a whole? 7 Is the B-term highly characteristic within literature A or C? 8 Do the words within the B-term all occur on the customized 1,400-word stoplist? Note. Reprinted from Torvik & Smalheiser (2007) with permission. See this reference for definitions and details regarding how the features were numerically scored. The two-node search interface http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu makes it easy for investigators to carry out two-node searches among PubMed articles. The two-node search also provides an aggregate measure of the implicit semantic similarity of any two literatures, based upon the body of B i -terms, taken as a whole. Suppose we perform a two-node search and find that there are 1,263 terms on the B-list, of which 402 are predicted to be relevant (i.e. the estimated probability of relevance is > 0.5). The ratio 402/1263 = 0.32 is called the pR score, and it provides an overall measure of the shared implicit information between the peanut butter and health literacy literatures. Randomly chosen pairs of literatures tend to have pR scores around 0.07, whereas literatures that are very closely related in terms of topics tend to have pR scores of 0.4\u20130.5. We have used the pR score as an important feature for literature-based discovery (Peng, Bonifield, & Smalheiser, 2017). 6.1 The One-node Search Reconceptualized as a Series of Two-node Searches Don\u2019s original Web-based one-node search tool is no longer available. I have implemented a simpler version http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu/cgi-bin/arrowsmith_uic/one-node.cgi in which the investigator starts with a literature that represents a problem to be solved (e.g. Huntington\u2019s disease). Next, the user will be prompted to choose a category of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) to search within, which encompasses a set of literatures describing entities (or classes of entities) that represent possible approaches or solutions to the problem. (Alternatively, the user can choose the Free Format option, to enter any list of PubMed search queries manually, one on each line.) For example, to search among different classes of drugs according to their molecular mechanism using the MeSH Tree option, the user would drill down from Chemicals and Drugs to Chemical Actions and Uses to Pharmacologic Actions to finally, Molecular Mechanisms of Pharmacological Action [D27.505.519]. This category includes about twenty classes of drugs, including Alkylating Agents [D27.505.519.124], Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists [D27.505.519.162], Antacids [D27.505.519.170], Antifoaming Agents [D27.505. 519.178], and so on. Once the user chooses this MeSH term category, the software will carry out a series of two-node searches, each consisting of A = Huntington\u2019s disease vs C = one of the drug classes. These two-node searches are characterized according to the total number of articles in A and C (and nAC, the intersection of A and C), as well as the total number of B-terms. Finally, the searches are ranked according to p R, the percentage of B-terms that are predicted to be relevant for meaningful linkage. The two-node search results are all individually stored temporarily by job ID so users can go back without the need to re-run the search each time. Thus, carrying out a one-node search is simply a matter of carrying out a series of two-node searches, one for each MeSH term within the category of interest (Smalheiser, 2012b). This greatly simplifies the computational issues involved.\n\n7 Examples from the Front Lines of Scientific Investigation A variety of investigators have used literature-based discovery (LBD) methods to propose specific hypotheses which were then tested experimentally. Some of these studies introduced new LBD methodology (e.g. Wren et al., 2004), whereas others used the public Arrowsmith two-node search interface. Dong et al. (2014) investigated links between anandamide and gastric cancer. Maver et al. (2013) identified novel treatments for neovascularization in diabetic retinopathy. Miller et al. (2012) found mechanisms to link hypogonadism and diminished sleep quality in aging men. Cairelli et al. (2013) proposed a possible explanation for the \u201cobesity paradox\u201d whereby obese patients have better outcomes in intensive care. Manev & Manev (2010) studied a 5-lipoxygenase-leptin-Alzheimer connection. Kell (2009) used LBD to assess abnormal iron chelation as a common pathogenetic factor in a variety of diseases. In my own laboratory studies, separately from Don, I have also put together assertions and knowledge from disparate literatures to formulate hypotheses that I have tested and verified experimentally. Unlike the examples stated above, in which we or others deliberately searched for complementary literatures, the latter examples arose haphazardly during the course of laboratory investigations. For example, we had discovered that an enzyme, dicer, which is known to cleave double-stranded RNA to form small RNAs, is expressed and even highly enriched at postsynaptic densities present at synaptic contacts in the central nervous system (Lugli et al., 2005). However, paradoxically, although the dicer protein was present, it appeared to lack enzymatic activity. On the other hand, we knew that treating purified dicer protein with certain proteases in a test tube will cause dicer to form fragments that show greatly enhanced catalytic activity. And, there was an extensive body of studies that had shown that a naturally-occurring protease called calpain is activated during synaptic stimulation and cleaves a variety of other proteins in a controlled manner. Putting the two lines of studies together, we predicted that during synaptic stimulation, calpain might cleave dicer such that the activated, cleaved form of dicer would exhibit enzymatic activity. This was confirmed in experiments carried out in mouse brain tissue (Lugli et al., 2005). Another example of connecting two disparate literatures to create a novel testable hypothesis occurred when we proposed that a phenomenon called RNA interference, which had been studied in worms and other lower organisms, might be involved in mediating learning and memory in the mammalian brain (Smalheiser, Manev, & Costa, 2001). It took us a decade to find provisional experimental evidence that this may, indeed, be the case (Smalheiser, 2012a, 2014). Finally, a third example occurred when we noticed detailed similarities between a class of small vesicles (called secretory exosomes)\u2014secreted by many cell types and reported to contain microRNAs and other types of RNAs\u2014and the structures called synaptic spinules that form at synapses during periods of intense synaptic stimulation (Smalheiser, 2007). This led to the hypothesis that neurons may transfer RNAs and proteins across synapses in an activity-dependent manner (Smalheiser, 2007). It should be acknowledged that none of these three examples involved computergenerated or automatic LBD algorithms, or even employed an explicit A-B-C model. Instead, both Don\u2019s and my discoveries have largely been made by manual examination of complementary literatures and assembling of quite complex information into coherent wholes (Smalheiser, 2012b). Thus, it should be kept in mind that although most LBD research has focused on situations that arre readily recognized by text mining and that follow standard templates (e.g. A affects B and B affects C), these situations represent only the \u201clow hanging fruit,\u201d and more sophisticated models of discourse and assertion will be needed to deal with the rest."}, {"url": "https://doaj.org/article/b17c585f0fe546e6bb0ad5d101af289b", "page_content": "Abstract\n\nRead online\n\nThe late Don R.
