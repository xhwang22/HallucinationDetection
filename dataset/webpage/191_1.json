{"Adam Collis is known for The Social Network (2010).": [{"url": "https://www.theringer.com/movies/2020/9/22/21450318/mark-zuckerberg-the-social-network-origin-story", "page_content": "On the cusp of the 25th anniversary of Se7en and the 10th anniversary of The Social Network, The Ringer hereby dubs Sept. 21-25 David Fincher Week. Join us all throughout the week as we celebrate and examine the man, the myth, and his impeccable body of work.\n\nIn 2017, Mark Zuckerberg returned to Harvard for a victory lap that most people can only dream of. Twelve years after the Facebook CEO dropped out of school to run what would become the largest online social network in the world, the elite Ivy League would give him an honorary degree. Facebook celebrated the event as an opportunity to showcase the company\u2019s history and display a more personal side of its CEO, organizing a few public broadcasts ahead of the speech. One of those included a visit to Kirkland House H33, the room where it all started.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that we\u2019ve been back in this dorm since I left,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a Facebook Live video that he was filming from his smartphone. With his college sweetheart Priscilla Chan in tow, he directed viewers toward his old desk, and the rooms where his Facebook cofounders (and then-roommates) Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes worked and slept. After some reminiscing about tiny bed sizes and dining hall cuisine, he addressed an incident that has, over the span of the past decade, become millennial folklore.\n\n\u201cOne weekend I wanted to build this prank website, FaceMash,\u201d he said with his signature indecipherable smile. \u201cI basically sat here for, like, three days straight, and just coded this thing. And it was a prank. It was kind of funny but also a little bit in poor taste.\u201d He summarized how it spread quickly, froze his laptop, and caused Harvard officials to turn off the entire dorm\u2019s internet connection. \u201cThat was probably one of my more memorable moments from Kirkland House, just sitting here, and, like, I\u2019m trying to fix this, Dustin\u2019s trying to do his computer-science problem set, Chris is trying to write some paper for social studies or whatever he\u2019s studying, and all the sudden the internet goes dark.\u201d\n\nLive from my old dorm room at Harvard. Posted by Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday, May 23, 2017\n\nAs Zuckerberg tells it, the story of FaceMash was nothing more than an innocent college gag that ended in a night of forced unproductivity. But chances are, most people watching that day remember it differently, as the riveting sequence of events at the start of a major Hollywood blockbuster called The Social Network. After conquering the business world, Zuckerberg had finally earned the approval of the elite institution he\u2019d once antagonized. But sitting at his old dorm room desk years later, it seemed his one remaining challenge was to reclaim his past.\n\nIn the decade since The Social Network\u2019s release, Facebook has become so omnipresent and unregulated that no misstep\u2014whether related to privacy, anti-trust laws, geopolitics, or genocide\u2014has managed to etch away at its dominance. Because Zuckerberg holds control of somewhere around 60 percent of Facebook\u2019s voting shares, he alone can determine what people see when they log on to Facebook and Instagram, what privacy settings they have access to, and the difference between violent and incendiary speech. As Chris Hughes, that same cofounder he roomed with back at Harvard, wrote in a 2019 New York Times op-ed, \u201cMark\u2019s influence is staggering, far beyond that of anyone else in the private sector or in government.\u201d\n\nIn tandem with that growing influence, Zuckerberg\u2019s public persona is now so heavily managed that you\u2019d have a better time deciphering the feelings of the AI assistant he once built to run his house than determining what he\u2019s really thinking. Maybe that\u2019s why Aaron Sorkin\u2019s version of the ambitious boy hacker still clings to the public\u2019s imagination. The more Zuckerberg has been shrouded in corporate armor, the more people have turned to his silver-screen depiction for clues.\n\nHow exactly did a Hollywood film beat the most powerful unelected man in America at telling his own origin story? It all begins with an enterprising science-fiction writer with a penchant for, uh, literary embellishment.\n\n\n\nThe Book\n\nBefore Ben Mezrich signed what was reportedly a million-dollar-plus book deal to write The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, a Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal, his reporting credentials had been dragged through the mud. His previous book, Bringing Down the House, about a troupe of MIT students who used advanced blackjack techniques to win millions of dollars in Vegas, was the first \u201ctrue\u201d story he\u2019d ever written, and it showed. Not long after it came out in 2002, its main characters debunked its most lurid details: They did not collaborate with strippers to cash their chips, the underground Chinatown casino where they supposedly practiced didn\u2019t exist, and a private detective with \u201cnarrow ice-blue eyes\u201d never beat them up in a casino bathroom. Still, those flourishes helped Mezrich more than they hurt him. The book sold over 1 million copies, and eventually became a Kevin Spacey\u2013produced heist film called 21.\n\nWith Accidental Billionaires, it was more of the same. The book\u2019s first cover advertised a tale of college debauchery with a slinky red bra and broken martini glass. Its narrative goes like this: Zuckerberg is a dorky nobody who, like everyone else at Harvard, is determined to join one of the school\u2019s elite social clubs. (Mezrich, a Harvard graduate himself, emphasizes in vivid, knowing detail just how important this kind of membership is to meeting women and getting laid.) Scorned by a mystery woman one evening, Zuckerberg gets drunk in his dorm room and revenge-codes a campus-specific Hot or Not site.\n\nThat part, at least, was a real-life incident that was documented in the LiveJournal updates Zuckerberg used to narrate his creation of the burgeoning social media tool: \u201cJessica A\u2014 is a bitch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI need to think of something to take my mind off her. I need to think of something to occupy my mind. Easy enough, now I just need an idea.\u201d Another entry: \u201cI\u2019m a little intoxicated, not gonna lie. So what if it\u2019s not even 10 p.m. and it\u2019s a Tuesday night? What? The Kirkland facebook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics. I almost want to put some of these faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on which is more attractive.\u201d Later: \u201cYea, it\u2019s on. I\u2019m not exactly sure how the farm animals are going to fit into this whole thing (you can\u2019t really ever be sure with farm animals . . .), but I like the idea of comparing two people together.\u201d\n\nSign up for the The Ringer Newsletter Thanks for signing up!

Subscribe\n\nFaceMash goes viral and inspires Zuckerberg to make something bigger. Meanwhile, two pedigreed rowers named Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss ask him to help with their own campus social network. He leads them on, while partnering with his best friend, Eduardo Saverin, to create a fast-growing competing product. Eventually, Sean Parker, the cofounder of Napster, swoops in whispering sweet nothings of VC funding in Zuckerberg\u2019s ear. The two hatch a scheme to push Saverin out of the company. (Parker\u2019s affinity for women and parties, meanwhile, seals his fate.) Zuckerberg emerges alone atop the fastest growing social network in the world.\n\nA year before the book came out, speculation about its sourcing was rampant. Gawker leaked Mezrich\u2019s initial proposal, noting that the story leaned heavily on Saverin\u2019s account and that \u201cmany facts seem off.\u201d In particular, the blog questioned a bizarre scene in which one of the founders of Sun Microsystems invites Zuckerberg to eat koala on his yacht. When The New York Times later obtained an early galley, it highlighted other \u201cpossible fabrications,\u201d including a moment where Zuckerberg leaves a San Francisco party with a Victoria\u2019s Secret model. (At that point, Zuckerberg was already dating his now-wife, Chan.) When the Times reached out to the book\u2019s publisher, a publicist shrugged off concerns of veracity, saying: \u201cThis is not reportage. It is big, juicy fun.\u201d\n\nEven with Gawker Media\u2019s steady drumbeat of criticism and the occasional privacy flare-up, Zuckerberg still enjoyed a relatively peaceful, even flattering relationship with the media. His interviews with Wired and Techcrunch were never hostile, and mostly portrayed him as a young, awkward, and very, very smart entrepreneur. In the business press, he was genuinely admired for building a company that was well on its way to an IPO at the tender age of 25. Shortly after the movie came out, his blank expression even appeared on the cover of Time magazine\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d issue\u2014something that now seems unthinkable. \u201cThe Social Network is a rich, dramatic portrait of a furious, socially handicapped genius who spits corrosive monologues in a monotone to hide his inner pain,\u201d the story\u2019s author, Lev Grossman, wrote. \u201cThis character bears almost no resemblance to the actual Mark Zuckerberg. The reality is much more complicated.\u201d\n\nThe Movie\n\nWhen The Social Network hit theaters in 2010, Facebook was the tech industry\u2019s golden goose egg, and Zuckerberg its attentive countryman in menswear basics. It was the most visited website in the United States. Its hacker-friendly slogan \u201cMove Fast and Break Things,\u201d earned it a reputation in the Valley as a bold, forward-thinking innovator that wasn\u2019t afraid to take risks. And, thanks in part to the growth of the company\u2019s advertising operations, it would earn about $2 billion in revenue that year.\n\nMost importantly, the public had come to see Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg as one and the same. When the website launched in 2004, the phrase \u201cA Mark Zuckerberg Production\u201d was stamped at the bottom of every single page. In subsequent years, the CEO was frequently quoted in The Harvard Crimson and other Ivy League newspapers discussing new features. At one point, he even returned to his alma mater to recruit people to work there. As his cabal of engineers rolled out new features from their raucous Palo Alto incubator, Mark led by example, tagging himself in photos and feverishly \u201cliking\u201d things. I was in the final class of students who received their college emails and joined Facebook, before it was opened up to the public, and seeing a tech CEO use social media at all felt intimate, novel. I recall thinking of Zuckerberg as a kind of millennial icon who was using his superior coding skills to enhance our social lives. A somewhat bland one, but an icon nonetheless.\n\nWhatever goodwill Zuckerberg had earned by making a fun platform ran thinner as Facebook pushed to expand. In 2006, the company premiered \u201cNews Feed\u201d\u2014the now-standard homepage that summarizes the profile changes, posts, birthdays, and upcoming events of everyone in a user\u2019s social network\u2014and faced its first real privacy scandal. People complained the update made it too easy for other people to track their individual activities. A \u201cStudents Against Facebook News Feed\u201d group was started, and gained over 100,000 members in a day. TV stations and protestors lined up on the street outside of the company\u2019s Palo Alto office. Zuckerberg responded to the fervor in a Facebook post titled \u201cCalm Down. Breathe. We Hear You.\u201d \u201cStalking isn\u2019t cool, but being able to know what\u2019s going on in your friends\u2019 lives is,\u201d he wrote with frat boy confidence, promising to add privacy tools.\n\nBut after the dust settled from that incident, little versions of the News Feed saga kept happening again and again and again. Journalists soon began to posit that Facebook\u2019s cavalier privacy efforts were not a result of inexperience, but of its leader\u2019s stubborn indifference to criticism and disdain for users. In May of 2010, Nicholas Carlson unearthed an instant message exchange from Zuckerberg\u2019s Harvard days in which the CEO offers an unnamed friend access to his fellow classmates\u2019 information. \u201cI have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhat? How\u2019d you manage that one,\u201d the anonymous recipient of these messages responded. \u201cPeople just submitted it,\u201d Zuckerberg concluded. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. They \u2018trust me.\u2019 Dumb fucks.\u201d In a mostly flattering New Yorker profile that Facebook timed to come out ahead of The Social Network\u2019s release, Zuckerberg said he regretted these messages, but they nonetheless seemed to confirm an increasingly frustrated public\u2019s suspicions that, no matter how many public pledges Zuckerberg made to protect user data, he was sitting in a giant mansion somewhere, snickering at all the chumps who\u2019d trusted him.\n\nThe team entrusted with making The Social Network would only build off that impression. Once Gawker leaked Mezrich\u2019s proposal, the film adaptation was set in motion. Aaron Sorkin, then famous for his loquacious political drama The West Wing, signed on to write the script, and David Fincher, who\u2019d earned a reputation for composing intellectual thrillers like Fight Club and Zodiac, would direct. Together, they cast a trio of hot 20-something actors: Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg, Andrew Garfield as Saverin, and singer Justin Timberlake as Parker. Scott Rudin, one of the film\u2019s producers, attempted to secure Facebook\u2019s cooperation, but the company considered any material sourced from Accidental Billionaires to be fiction. In the end, the team felt it had enough public records to stick with the Mezrich treatment anyway. Sorkin said he nevertheless took \u201cextra care\u201d knowing his subjects were real people. \u201cYou feel a special responsibility, knowing what a loud sound a Hollywood movie makes,\u201d he later told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThough Sorkin\u2019s script contains no koala entr\u00e9es, the moments in which he chose to exercise his creative liberties were some of the most memorable. Specifically when he imagines a breakup between Zuckerberg and the woman who inspired FaceMash in the first few minutes of the movie. In the subsequent drunken code-a-thon that follows, Sorkin embellishes Zuckerberg\u2019s LiveJournal rant by adding a few more cruel lines about the fictitious ex\u2019s last name and bra size. Tonally, his version wasn\u2019t so different from Zuckerberg\u2019s original entries, or even your average Reddit post. But\u2014combined with the made-up breakup and the fact that Chan was completely left out of the film\u2014Sorkin\u2019s additions made Zuckerberg seem extra callous. In the movie\u2019s closing scene, after the Facebook creator has betrayed his collaborators and claimed his place atop the social totem pole, he returns to that same ex\u2019s Facebook profile, refreshing it over and over again to see whether she has accepted his friend request. As history would prove, it was just the right amount of real and fake to burrow deep into people\u2019s brains as Facebook canon.\n\nThe Reception\n\nAs emails from the 2014 Sony hack showed, Zuckerberg had tried and failed to stop the film from being made. So ahead of its release, Facebook\u2019s in-house PR agency, Outcast, devised a strategy to avoid slamming the film or attacking its creators. Instead, they would offer a counternarrative, in The New Yorker and, with help from cofounder Chris Hughes, in The New York Times. When NPR\u2019s Guy Raz asked about the film in 2010, Zuckerberg called it \u201cfiction.\u201d\n\nInternally, Facebook tried to embrace the film. On opening weekend, it held an all-staff showing at Century Cinema 16 in Mountain View (which, coincidentally, was also where I saw Independence Day, Jack, and many other classics as a kid). \u201cWe had some fun with it,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg said during a Q&A years later, after it became clear the movie would not go away. \u201cI mean we knew that everyone who works at Facebook was going to want to see it anyway, because how often does someone make a major movie about your company?\u201d Zuckerberg added that, for a while after the showing, Facebook employees would make fun of him by mixing appletinis in the office\u2014a reference to the scene in the movie where his character first meets Parker and consumes several of the cocktails.\n\nBut to viewers who didn\u2019t work at Facebook, The Social Network depicted a more sinister version of the 20-something to whom millions of users had entrusted their photos, birthdays, and interests. A version who trampled over his fellow students\u2019 security in the name of a tasteless prank, who willingly pushed his friends and classmates out of the way to get what he wanted, and who was far less interested in Facebook\u2019s stated mission of \u201cconnecting people\u201d than he was in consolidating power. As Times reviewer Manohla Dargis put it:\n\nThe price of that ambition, at least as dramatized here, is borne by those around Mark, who remains a strategic cipher throughout: a Facebook page without a profile photo. Charmless and awkward in groups larger than one, he rarely breaks into a smile and, if memory serves, never says thank you. He seems wary at some moments, coolly calculating at others: When his eyes haven\u2019t gone dead, you can see him working all the angles.\n\nHis tech-industry peers took less precaution to separate fact from fiction. \u201cIt says something about the characters in a film, and in the valley, when the most likable characters are the lawyers,\u201d one tech worker tweeted. Another chimed, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to hate Zuck or Parker or try to become them. Or both.\u201d Tech journalist Jon Dube summarized the public sentiment most succinctly: \u201cMade Zuck look pretty bad.\u201d\n\nThe movie was an immediate hit, grossing $224.9 million worldwide. It earned eight Academy Award nominations and three actual Oscars. The Times staff apparently covered it so much that it became the subject of a Variety column. And it soon became a beloved, oft-parodied fixture in popular culture. The same month the movie premiered, a Forbes poll found that \u201c63 percent of Americans didn\u2019t trust Facebook with their personal information.\u201d\n\nThe Corporate Makeover\n\nFollowing the release of a major-motion picture that made its founder look like a socially inept hacker, the company needed to run damage control, especially given the IPO on the horizon. Privately, Zuckerberg would spend the next few years ensuring he was protected from the public eye, spending $30 million on the four homes that surrounded his Palo Alto property, building a 6-foot lava rock wall around his 700-acre estate in Kauai, and hiring a private security detail to patrol the perimeters of his properties (and, apparently, protect his trash). But publicly, he embarked on a campaign to soften his image. The day the film premiered, he went on Oprah to announce he was giving a $100 million grant to the Newark school system. A few months later, he appeared on Saturday Night Live where he and the host, Jesse Eisenberg, made awkward small talk. He got a Hungarian sheepdog named Beast and made it a Facebook page. He reduced his annual salary to $1 a year.\n\nFacebook later created an entire team to maintain Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook profile. Some of them deleted harassing comments on the threads he posted, others followed him around and took professional photos as he went for a run or hung out with his family. His annual New Year\u2019s resolutions evolved from simple stuff like \u201cwear a tie everyday\u201d in 2009, to symbolic endeavors like \u201cmeet a person from every U.S. state\u201d in 2017. His staff even went so far as to quietly delete all his old Facebook messenger conversations. Occasional telling tidbits\u2014like Zuckerberg\u2019s affinity for the game Risk\u2014would filter through the press, buttressing the myth of the domineering nerd, but outwardly he maintained the polished aura of a CEO, with more production value and much, much less personality.\n\nHe also made a point to improve his public speaking. The old Mark Zuckerberg preferred to let his employees run meetings while occasionally yelling the word \u201cDomination!\u201d into the ether. But in late 2014, the new Zuck 2.0 would stream live \u201cTown Halls\u201d from his Facebook page, answering questions on a range of topics from employees and users. During the very first session at the company\u2019s Menlo Park headquarters, the mic was handed to a woman named Lori who had flown in from Povo, Utah, to repeat a question she had posted on one of the CEO\u2019s threads. \u201cI\u2019m a huge movie fan, and one of my top-10 favorite movies is The Social Network, and my question has always been to you: How accurate is the story compared to the real-life story of Facebook\u2019s beginnings?\u201d\n\nZuckerberg laughed nervously. \u201cWow, I haven\u2019t spent a lot of time thinking about that movie in a while,\u201d he said, \u201cI kinda blocked that one out.\u201d He then went on to make several points. That, one, his life was far less interesting than the movie made it out to be: \u201cThe reality is that writing a code and then building a product and then building a company actually is not a glamorous enough thing to make a movie about, so you can imagine that a lot of the stuff they probably had to embellish and make up. Because if they were really making a movie, it would\u2019ve been of me sitting at a computer and coding for two hours straight, which probably would\u2019ve just not been that good of a movie. And these guys, I think, want to win awards and sell tickets. So that\u2019s kind of where they went with it.\u201d Two, that he had never met the people who\u2019d made the movie about his life, aside from his brief encounter with Eisenberg: \u201cI think he was a little afraid to meet me, after his portrayal, but I tried to be nice.\u201d Three, the premise of the movie\u2014that Zuckerberg was motivated to make Facebook so he could meet girls\u2014was messed up. \u201cThey just kind of made up a bunch of stuff that I found kind of hurtful.\u201d And four, he\u2019d begun dating Chan before he even started Facebook. (This is technically true. The two met in the bathroom line of the preemptive \u201cgoing-away party\u201d his Jewish frat threw him after he\u2019d met with Harvard\u2019s administrative board about the FaceMash incident.) In sum: \u201cI think the real story is just, you know, a lot of hard work.\u201d\n\nThe Legacy\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s motivations for maintaining an air-tight public persona have shifted over the years, away from his Social Network portrayal and toward a steady stream of scandals. After Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, and accusations of social media bubbles and Russian interference soared, Zuckerberg embarked on a public relations tour of roughly 30 states with a professional photographer in tow. He pet a service dog in Montana, drove a tractor in Wisconsin, and watched a rodeo in Texas. Each stop warranted its own crisp Facebook post, and each update seemed more careful and apolitical than the previous. After he\u2019d finally completed the project he gave a Q&A about what he\u2019d learned, concluding, blandly, that \u201cthe biggest takeaway by far is that community, and especially local community, are much more important to people than we realize.\u201d It appeared Zuckerberg\u2019s aim was to demonstrate to users he didn\u2019t think of them as numbers, or chumps, but people\u2014even if the way Facebook operates indicated otherwise. But without any kind of political bent or spice to his messaging, the campaign felt weird, like after years hidden away behind a computer he was on a quest to learn about the human race for the very first time.\n\nThe more canned Zuckerberg has become, the more the public has turned to his silver screen depiction for answers.The Social Network is stamped into the company\u2019s DNA. As Steven Levy describes in the first chapter of Facebook: The Inside Story, Zuckerberg is asked about the movie in places as far flung as Nigeria. In 2018, The New Yorker reported that Facebook executives still refer to The Social Network resentfully as \u201cthe movie.\u201d \u201cFrom its facts to its essence to its portrayal, I think that was a very unfair picture,\u201d Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said in the same piece. \u201cI still think it forms the basis of a lot of what people believe about Mark.\u201d Ahead of one of the most consequential presidential elections in recent history, the public continues to take stock of Facebook\u2019s negative effect on public discourse, news, and democracy. And in those terms, David Fincher\u2019s masterpiece has felt all the more relevant; spiritually, if not factually, correct. More than anything, in a 10-year vacuum of personality, the better story won."}, {"url": "https://dl.acm.org/profile/81350600091", "page_content": "Automatic normalization of author names is not exact.

Attendees gathered at the Duke Ellington School of Art, a famed school within DCPS known to offer a dual curriculum encompassing professional arts training and academic enrichment, in preparation for college and careers in the arts.\n\nSpecial guest, Scarlett Lewis Founder & Chief Movement Officer at the Jesse Lewis Choose Love Movement, shared her story and movement that started when Scarlett\u2019s son, Jesse, was tragically killed in the Sandy Hook school shooting.\n\nScarlett Lewis\n\nScarlett\u2019s research demonstrates that social and emotional curriculum is at the heart of school safety. Started in 2016, the Jesse Choose Love movement is in over 85 countries and has impacted more than one million educators and students. The program focuses on four important character values \u2014 Courage, Gratitude, Forgiveness, and Compassion in Action \u2014 which cultivates optimism, resilience and personal responsibility. Important elements of the program are positive psychology, mindfulness, neuroscience, character values, and curriculum to help educators understand and implement the necessary practices. These were demonstrated for the Catalyst attendees and everyone was provided two interactive lessons to take back to their institutions.\n\nFollowing Scarlett\u2019s keynote, the Catalyst attendees discussed the ways in which Social and Emotional learning is part of their specific curriculum and coaching for teachers and students. Defined by CASEL (Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning) SEL is the process through which children and adults acquire and effectively apply the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions.\n\nIn the roundtable discussions at the Catalyst event, the attendees shared ideas and best practices in small groups.\n\nThe first question discussed in the small groups was how SEL can better prepare learners. Groups discussed curriculum, research and practices they are implementing for classroom learning. One big hurdle discussed was the rational for helping teachers embrace the addition of SEL curriculum with the core curriculum already being implemented. Catalyst attendees discussed how to motivate teachers in an already compressed learning day.\n\nGroup discussions\n\nThe conversation shifted to learners and providing a learning environment that delivers on the promise of SEL. Attendees provided specific examples of why SEL is important and how teaching practices can change to bring SEL to the forefront.\n\nInterestingly enough, Catalyst leaders stated that while not formal, SEL practices have been in classrooms for many years, but without rigor or consistency. The focus on specific SEL practices is welcome to ensure that we can assess the results of the effort and determine whether specific curriculum and practices can support student success in the world.\n\nOnce again, our members continued to ask for physical Catalyst events to further the movement and continue the dialogue in addition to the online platform.

McClary, Director, Educational Technology & Library Programs at District of Columbia Public Schools. Attendees gathered at the Duke Ellington School of Art, a famed school within DCPS known to offer a dual curriculum encompassing professional arts training and academic enrichment, in preparation for college and careers in the arts.\n\nSpecial guest, Scarlett Lewis Founder & Chief Movement Officer at the Jesse Lewis Choose Love Movement, shared her story and movement that started when Scarlett\u2019s son, Jesse, was tragically killed in the Sandy Hook school shooting.\n\nScarlett Lewis\n\nScarlett\u2019s research demonstrates that social and emotional curriculum is at the heart of school safety. Started in 2016, the Jesse Choose Love movement is in over 85 countries and has impacted more than one million educators and students. The program focuses on four important character values \u2014 Courage, Gratitude, Forgiveness, and Compassion in Action \u2014 which cultivates optimism, resilience and personal responsibility. Important elements of the program are positive psychology, mindfulness, neuroscience, character values, and curriculum to help educators understand and implement the necessary practices. These were demonstrated for the Catalyst attendees and everyone was provided two interactive lessons to take back to their institutions.\n\nFollowing Scarlett\u2019s keynote, the Catalyst attendees discussed the ways in which Social and Emotional learning is part of their specific curriculum and coaching for teachers and students. Defined by CASEL (Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning) SEL is the process through which children and adults acquire and effectively apply the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions.\n\nIn the roundtable discussions at the Catalyst event, the attendees shared ideas and best practices in small groups.\n\nThe first question discussed in the small groups was how SEL can better prepare learners. Groups discussed curriculum, research and practices they are implementing for classroom learning. One big hurdle discussed was the rational for helping teachers embrace the addition of SEL curriculum with the core curriculum already being implemented. Catalyst attendees discussed how to motivate teachers in an already compressed learning day.\n\nGroup discussions\n\nThe conversation shifted to learners and providing a learning environment that delivers on the promise of SEL. Attendees provided specific examples of why SEL is important and how teaching practices can change to bring SEL to the forefront.\n\nInterestingly enough, Catalyst leaders stated that while not formal, SEL practices have been in classrooms for many years, but without rigor or consistency. The focus on specific SEL practices is welcome to ensure that we can assess the results of the effort and determine whether specific curriculum and practices can support student success in the world.\n\nOnce again, our members continued to ask for physical Catalyst events to further the movement and continue the dialogue in addition to the online platform.

Come and get involved"}], "Adam Collis is known for The Amazing Spider-Man (2012).": [{"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0948470/reviews", "page_content": "5 /10\n\nWith the success of the first X-Men movie in 2000, Bryan Singer pretty much paved the way for all the comic book movies we see today. That included a certain super hero movie made by Sami Rami in 2002 where a nerdy guy (Tobey Maguire) gets bitten by a radioactive spider and inherits superhuman powers. If Singer had paved the way, then Rami provided the icing on the cake: a faithful, smart, well-acted super hero flick that had as much heart and sincerity packed in as it had all those set pieces. It also lead to a superior sequel and the much maligned, though underrated, third episode.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to what we have here: while not a beat for beat remake, you get the same story more or less with a different love interest and villain. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) sneaks into a research facility and gets bitten by a radioactive/genetically enhanced spider. He gets super powers and becomes Spider-Man. Meanwhile, a doctor (Rhys Ifans) working at the same facility, is being forced to close down his research into tissue regeneration. In desperation, he injects himself with an untested self-generating lizard vaccine and becomes a half man/half lizard thing. Spider-Man is then forced into action to stop him from spreading this contagion throughout the city of New York. Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) is the damsel in distress/love interest and plays a role in trying to stop the crazed beast.\n\n\n\nFirst things first: this is not a bad film. It's well acted by all the principals, has good effects, a scary and menacing villain, some nice action sequences and web swinging effects that are generally slightly more realistic than the Rami version. Parker is more evidently scientific and intelligent here. Also the police's notion that Spider-Man is a menace to the public is more clearly defined, especially in the scene where he disarms an officer. The new idea is that Parker can hear the movements of spiders and it's a good addition. So where does it all go wrong? The short answer: it's just that it's so pointless.\n\n\n\nWe had already seen the story before. There was absolutely no reason to tell it again. This movie could easily have been Spider-Man 4 with Andrew Garfield filling in the Spidey spandex instead of Tobey Maguire. But Marvel \u2013 in their infinite wisdom \u2013 just chose to tell the same story a second time. Going by that rationale, presumably Andrew Garfield will be cast aside like a disused sock when they inevitably choose to 'reboot' the franchise again in ten years or so. It is a scarily unimaginative tactic and it is one they will continue to do until there is a massive financial failure.\n\n\n\nThis movie follows the same set up as the 2002 version: Parker being picked on, getting advice from his sage-like uncle (Martin Sheen), being bitten, getting his powers/climbing walls, and turning his back on a situation which unfortunately has tragic consequences for a family member. It's all a case of been there, done that. If you want to compare it to the Rami original, then the short answer is; as good as Andrew Garfield is, Tobey Maguire was better. Maguire filled the suit better; on occasion, Garfield is prone to looking thin and scrawny during several scenes. Even the suit looked better in the Rami movies. And those earlier movies had a heart and sincerity \u2013 especially in the relationship between Peter and his aunt and uncle that you don't see here. Again we ask: why does this movie exist?\n\n\n\nAnd there are holes: there's a massive lizard running around, wreaking havoc; yet the police are more preoccupied with pointing their guns at Spider-Man \u2013 despite the fact that he saved a child in a (surprise, surprise) rehashed scene set on a bridge taken from Rami's first movie. In another part, the citizens of the city (once again - in a bit taken from Rami's movie) unite to help Spider-Man cross the city using tower cranes \u2013 despite the fact that there are buildings all around him. Heck, even the villain is initially a do-gooder like Norman Osborn and Dr. Octavius \u2013 again from the Rami movies.\n\n\n\nIt also seems to pull inspiration from another super hero movie: Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005) in that it's slightly darker, tells such a large origin story that just like Batman Begins, Spider-Man doesn't actually show up on screen for the first hour. So if you take two parts Batman Begins and add a touch of Rami's Spider-Man, the result is what you have here. Additionally, the introduction of the web shooters, while being faithful to the original comics and emphasizing Parker's intellect, is a bit of a mixed blessing. The notion of the web being an organic material rather than being fired from mechanical devices actually made more sense.\n\n\n\nIt's not that reboots are a bad idea, they're not. In certain situations they can work well, provided for example, enough time has elapsed. But there is no point in retelling the same story if the initial release is still relatively recent. In addition, it helps if the story wasn't covered well the first time, or it was a bad movie to begin with. Going by this criteria, Marvel's latest cash cow is unnecessary on all three accounts.\n\n\n\nIn closing, if you haven't already seen the Rami movie from 2002, go watch it instead. If you have seen it, then this probably won't live up to it and you will be left feeling a little underwhelmed. It's fair to say that for anyone over the age of eighteen, this movie will seem rather half-hearted and senseless; for those under eighteen, this movie will probably be the greatest super hero flick ever. Yes, it's a movie that will divide opinions, primarily on the sole reason for its existence. Not a bad, or a badly made flick, by any means just a pointless one."}, {"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amazing_Spider-Man_(2012_movie)", "page_content": "The Amazing Spider-Man is a 2012 movie by Marvel Entertainment and Columbia Pictures.

It is the fourth theatrical Spider-Man film produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Entertainment, serving as a reboot of the series following Sam Raimi's 2002\u20132007 Spider-Man trilogy, and the first of the two The Amazing Spider-Man films. The film was directed by Marc Webb and written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves from a story by Vanderbilt, and stars Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Campbell Scott, Irrfan Khan, Martin Sheen, and Sally Field. In the film, after Parker is bitten by a genetically altered spider, he gains newfound, spider-like powers and ventures out to save the city from the machinations of the Lizard.\n\nDevelopment of the film began following the cancellation of Spider-Man 4 in January 2010, ending director Sam Raimi's Spider-Man film series that originally featured Tobey Maguire as the titular superhero. Columbia Pictures opted to reboot the franchise with the same production team along with Vanderbilt to stay on with writing the next Spider-Man film, while Sargent and Kloves helped with the script as well. During pre-production, the main characters were cast in 2010. New designs were introduced from the comics, such as artificial web-shooters. Using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED Epic camera, principal photography started in December 2010 in Los Angeles before moving to New York City. The film entered post-production in April 2011. 3ality Technica provided 3D image processing, while Sony Pictures Imageworks handled CGI effects. This was also the final American film to be scored by James Horner and released during his lifetime, three years before his death on June 22, 2015, from an aircraft accident, as well as the penultimate film for both production designer J. Michael Riva and one of the producers Laura Ziskin, who died on June 7, 2012, and June 12, 2011, respectively. J. Michael Riva's last film as production designer was Django Unchained, released five months later and Ziskin's last film as producer was The Butler, released one year later in 2013.\n\nSony Pictures Entertainment built a promotional website, releasing many previews and launching a viral marketing campaign, among other moves. Tie-ins included a video game by Beenox and Activision. The film premiered on June 30, 2012, in Tokyo, and was released in the United States on July 3, ten years after the release of Spider-Man (2002), in 2D, 3D, IMAX 3D, and 4DX formats. It received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised Garfield's performance as Spider-Man, the chemistry between Stone and Garfield, the visual effects, and musical score, however criticism was directed towards some of the plot elements. The film was a box office success, grossing $758 million worldwide, becoming the seventh highest-grossing film of 2012. A sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, was released on May 2, 2014. Garfield and Ifans reprised their roles in the MCU film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) which dealt with the concept of the multiverse and linked that franchise to the Raimi and Webb installments.\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 5 Views: 52 086 023 223 164 072 23 865 318 5 938 832 294 339\n\nPeter Parker vs Flash - High School Life - The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) Movie CLIP HD\n\nPeter Parker vs Flash - Basketball Scene - The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) Movie CLIP HD\n\nBecoming Spider-Man Scene - The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) Movie CLIP HD\n\n10 Minutes to remind you the Amazing Andrew Garfield's Spider-man\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man Transcription\n\nPlot\n\nA young Peter Parker discovers that his father, business tycoon Richard Parker's study has been burgled. Peter's parents gather hidden documents, take Peter to the home of his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, then mysteriously leave. Years later, a teenage Peter attends Midtown Science High School; he is intelligent but socially awkward and often bullied. He also has a crush on Gwen Stacy, who returns his feelings.\n\nLearning that his father is friends with Dr. Curt Connors, a scientist at Oscorp in the field of cross-species genetics, Peter sneaks into Oscorp, where he is bitten by a genetically modified spider. He then discovers he has developed spider-like abilities, such as superhuman strength, sharp senses, agility, and speed. Peter studies his father's papers and visits Connors, whose right arm is amputated above the elbow. Peter reveals he is Richard's son and gives Connors his father's \"decay rate algorithm\", the missing piece in Connors' experiments on regenerating limbs. At home, Peter and Ben argue, and Peter leaves. While searching for him, Ben tries to stop a thief that Peter allowed to escape, and is shot, dying in Peter's arms. Peter uses his new abilities to track down criminals matching the killer's description. He creates a mask and spandex suit to hide his identity. He also builds mechanical web-shooters out of wristwatches to attach to his arms/wrists. At dinner with Gwen's family, he discovers her father is police captain George Stacy, who dislikes the new vigilante hero.\n\nPeter reveals his identity to Gwen and they kiss. After seeing success with the lab rats using lizard DNA, Connors' superior Rajit Ratha demands Connors begin human trials immediately. Connors refuses to rush the drug-testing procedure and put innocent people at risk. Ratha fires Connors and decides to test his serum at a Veterans Administration hospital. A desperate Connors tries the formula on himself. After passing out, he awakens to find his missing arm has regenerated. Discovering that Ratha is on his way to the hospital, Connors goes to intercept him. By the time he gets to the Williamsburg Bridge, he has become a violent humanoid reptile. Peter, now calling himself Spider-Man, saves the people on the bridge from Connors' attack. Following a battle in the sewer, the Lizard learns Spider-Man's real identity and attacks Peter at school. Police start a manhunt for both Spider-Man and the Lizard. They eventually corner Spider-Man, leading Captain Stacy to discover that Spider-Man is Peter and lets him go to stop the Lizard. The Lizard plans to make all humans reptilian by releasing a chemical cloud from Oscorp's tower, to eliminate the weaknesses he believes plague humanity.\n\nGwen creates an antidote, which Peter disperses, restoring Connors and his victims to normal, but not before the Lizard fatally wounds Captain Stacy. Before his death, Captain Stacy asks that Peter avoid Gwen to keep her safe. Peter initially does so, but seeing as they're both unhappy, hints to her that he may see her after all.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, an incarcerated Connors speaks with a man in the shadows who asks if Peter knows the truth about his father. Connors does not know and demands that Peter be left alone, before the man disappears.[b]\n\nCast\n\nChris Zylka portrays Flash Thompson, a high school bully who is also the captain of the Midtown Science High basketball team and typically picks on Parker.[46] On playing the role, Zylka said, \"You just try to focus. As an artist or as an actor, you just try to focus and stay in that world and block it all out.\"[47] Embeth Davidtz portrays Peter's mother, Mary Parker.[33][34] Leif Gantvoort plays the burglar who robs the convenience store and then kills Uncle Ben, and Michael Barra plays T-Bone, the store clerk. Tom Waite plays Nicky, a thug whom Peter mistakes for his uncle's killer. Hannah Marks portrays Missy Kallenback, a shy girl who has a crush on Peter.[48] Kelsey Chow's brief role is simply credited as \"Hot Girl\" during the end credits of the film, but the actress revealed to media outlets around the time of the film's release that her character is in fact Sally Avril.[49] Similarly, C. Thomas Howell's character is credited as \"Jack's Father\" at the end of the film (Jack being a boy that Spider-Man rescues on the Williamsburg Bridge) but he is referred to as Troy by one of his fellow construction workers in the film itself. Unlike the previous films, J. Jonah Jameson does not appear.[50] Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee has a cameo appearance, as he did in the previous films. At the 2011 Dallas Comic Con, Lee detailed that he plays a librarian listening to music on his headphones while stamping books, oblivious to the ongoing battle.[51] Michael Massee, who previously worked with Marvel as Dr. Bruce Banner in the Ultimate Avengers animated film series, plays the mysterious man in the shadows who talks with Connors in his prison cell in a teaser scene during the end credits.[52] As to the man's identity, director Marc Webb said, \"It's intentionally mysterious. And I invite speculation...\"[53] In The Amazing Spider-Man 2, the character was revealed to be Gustav Fiers.[54] Michael Papajohn, who played Dennis Carradine, Uncle Ben's apparent killer in the 2002 film, has a cameo as Alfred, Dr. Ratha's limo driver, thus being the only actor (aside from Stan Lee) of the Sam Raimi films to play a role in the reboot film. Papajohn originally asked to reprise the role as Uncle Ben's killer, but the part was given to Gantvoort.[55]\n\nKari Coleman, Charlie DePew, Skyler Gisondo and Jacob Rodier portray the Stacy family: Helen Stacy, Philip Stacy, Howard Stacy, and Simon Stacy respectively.\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nFollowing the release of Spider-Man 3 (2007), Sony Pictures Entertainment had announced a May 6, 2011, release date for Sam Raimi's next film in the earlier series. By this time, screenwriters James Vanderbilt, David Lindsay-Abaire and Gary Ross had written several rejected versions of a script and Ziskin's husband Alvin Sargent, who co-wrote the second and third films, was working on yet another attempt.[56][57] Raimi wanted John Malkovich to play his next villain.[56] However, on January 11, 2010, Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that rather than continue the earlier saga, they were rebooting the series with a new cast and crew. Industry reports claimed that Raimi had admitted that he could not meet the scheduled release date and retain creative integrity.[58] Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach and Ziskin continued as producers.[58]\n\nArad later explained, \"We were working on what we called Spider-Man 4 and it was the same team [as with the first three films]. The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and warranted ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [didn't] have a good reason to make another one. And between [him] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story.\"[59] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man.[60] Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented \"as a favor\" to the filmmakers.[61] \"I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma,\" he explained. \"So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And I did a little plot work, but a lot of the plot was done.\" He did \"a little bit\" of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man.[61] In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb \"invited me on set, and I did a little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes\".[62]\n\n\"When you walk out of the theater, I want the world you see to resemble what you saw on the screen. Part of the joy of cinema [is that] you make the impossible look real. I wanted it to be more grounded and more realistic and that went for the emotion of the scenes, the physical action and wardrobe. It's less based in Steve Ditko world and probably closer visually and more influenced by \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" but it is also very much a world of our own devising.\" \u2014Marc Webb in an interview with the Los Angeles Times[63]\n\nDays after announcing Raimi's departure, the studio announced that Webb, whose previous film 500 Days of Summer was his directorial debut, would direct the reboot.[64] Kathryn Bigelow and David Fincher were considered to direct the film.[65][66] Tolmach, now president of Columbia Pictures and Amy Pascal, co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said they looked for a director who could give sharp focus to Parker's life.[64] Webb said he \"was a little sceptical at first\u2014you feel the presence of those other movies. But then I was like, 'How could I walk away from this? What an opportunity!'\"[67] Webb said in the press release announcing him that, \"Sam Raimi's virtuoso rendering of Spider-Man is a humbling precedent to follow and build upon. The first three films are beloved for good reason. But I think the Spider-Man mythology transcends not only generations but directors as well. I am signing on not to 'take over' from Sam. That would be impossible. Not to mention arrogant. I'm here because there's an opportunity for ideas, stories, and histories that will add a new dimension, canvas, and creative voice to Spider-Man.\"[64] Webb felt Spider-Man is different from the Harry Potter franchise, which is based on a few novels and \"more like James Bond\" because \"there's so much material in Spider-Man that there are so many stories to tell and so many characters.\"[68] He described the film as \"not a remake\" explaining that \"we're not making Sam's movie again. It's a different universe and a different story with different characters.\"[69]\n\nCasting\n\nIn May 2010, The Hollywood Reporter said the actors who met with Webb to be considered for the lead role included Jamie Bell, Alden Ehrenreich, Frank Dillane, Andrew Garfield and Josh Hutcherson.[70] In June 2010 the Los Angeles Times reported that the shortlist had expanded to include Aaron Johnson and Anton Yelchin.[71] At least Bell, Ehrenreich, Garfield, Yelchin, Logan Lerman and Michael Angarano had screen tests.[72] Joe Jonas also auditioned.[73] On July 1, 2010, the choice of Garfield was confirmed.[74] Webb stated that he felt he knew Garfield was the right choice when they were filming a cutscene where he was eating a cheeseburger while telling Gwen to calm down.[75] Garfield said that he got the role as he decided to pretended to think he was doing auditioning for Spider-Man short film with friends to ease off the pressure.[76]\n\nSony then held auditions for the role of the young Peter, who needed to resemble Garfield.[77] Webb said, \"I think we saw the origin of Spider-Man before but not the origin of Peter Parker.\" Webb felt that when you try to build the film you must build the protagonist from the ground up. That's why he wanted Parker to begin as a child.[78]\n\nIt was reported originally that the film would feature both Mary Jane Watson and Gwen Stacy as love interests,[79] but the website The Wrap later reported that only Gwen Stacy would appear.[80] In August 2010, the list of candidates included Lily Collins, Ophelia Lovibond, and Imogen Poots, with Teresa Palmer, Emma Roberts, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead cited by The Hollywood Reporter as \"potentially in the mix\".[81] In September 2010, Variety reported that the shortlist had expanded to include Stone and Mia Wasikowska.[82] The shortlist was reported to then include Dianna Agron, Georgina Haig and Dominique McElligott.[83] On October 5, 2010, the choice of Stone was confirmed.[22] Webb noted that the chemistry between Stone and Garfield made her the clear choice.[22] That chemistry inspired their off-screen romance.[13]\n\nOn October 11, 2010, Rhys Ifans was confirmed to be the unnamed villain, and two days later his character was revealed to be Dr. Curt Connors / The Lizard.[84][85] Arad said that Lizard is his favorite Spider-Man villain, and he had long wanted to use him in a film.[27] Well before the choice of villain, Arad had had conceptual drawings prepared for the character.[27] Michael Fassbender was originally considered for the role.[86]\n\nIn November, Martin Sheen was reported to be Uncle Ben while Sally Field was in negotiations to play Aunt May.[39][43] Field said that that she took the role of Aunt May as a favor to her friend Laura Ziskin.[87] That same month, Denis Leary was reported to accept the role of George Stacy.[31] In December 2010, Campbell Scott and Julianne Nicholson were in negotiations to play Peter's parents. Khan was originally reported as playing Van Adder until the character's name was revealed to be Dr. Ratha.[88][33] Embeth Davidtz then replaced Nicholson.[34] Annie Parisse was originally reported to play \"the villain's wife\", and Miles Elliot was reported to portray Billy Connors, son of Dr. Connors; but they did not appear in the final cut of the film.[89][33]\n\nDesign\n\nWebb felt a responsibility to reinvent Spider-Man.[63] One departure from the preceding trilogy was to have Spider-Man build artificial web-shooters, as the character does in the comics.[90] Costume Designer Kym Barrett was brought onto the project and worked closely with Webb to redesign the costume with realism in mind. The new iteration of the iconic suit featured golden eye lenses made from sunglasses. The soles of the shoes were made from cut off asics running shoes that were painted to match the pattern of the costume. The web shooters and the civilian wrist bands Peter wears in the film are made from every day wristwatch parts. The costume also features a fully screen printed hex pattern to make it resemble athletic wear. In February 2011, with the launch of the official website, the title and first official image of Garfield as Spider-Man depicting both his costume and web-shooters for the first time were revealed.[91][92] Writer Geoff Boucher of the Los Angeles Times was skeptical of the change, feeling that it was too hard to believe that a financially strapped young man could conceive a wrist-worn device that can instantly produce a strand of synthetic webbing and noted \"the suit lives up to the challenge of being different from the Sam Raimi films but not too different from the classic suit that stands as one of the great comic-book costumes ever.\"[93] Matt Goldberg of Collider admitted that he was not crazy about the costume, explaining that the bug-yellow eyes felt weird to him and the mesh-pattern felt too busy. He explained that the design of the gloves caused flashbacks to the Spider-Man 2099 costume which he did not like, although he felt that the web-shooters looked fine.[94] Webb explained that he felt that \"the web-shooters were able to dramatize Peter's intellect\". Webb paid attention to the question of \"How would a kid make it?\" and then took some license with it. About the new costume, Webb explained that he and the crew \"wanted a design that would make the body longer and more lithe, more of an acrobat, someone incredibly agile and the legs of the spider [symbol on the chest] were something we used to emphasize that.\" He revealed that the film used varying suits for different lighting conditions. They made the webbing on the costume a little darker.[90] Webb stated that \"With the costume and the web-shooters we wanted to emphasize that these are things that Peter Parker made\".[90] Webb also looked at the Mark Bagley art in Ultimate Spider-Man for the hero's body.[95]\n\nWhile Webb introduced a few elements from Ultimate Spider-Man, he wanted to keep the mainstream version of Gwen Stacy instead of that world's punk rocker, though he states that the \"texture\" of the romantic relationship between her and Peter is based on that of the Ultimate versions of Peter and Mary Jane.[95]\n\nThe release of Lizard merchandise designs along with unconfirmed concept art featuring a humanoid-shape with a layer of scales on top instead of a pronounced snout (similar to a dinosaur or crocodile) as in the most recent comics, produced a mixed reaction. Many commenters compared it to other fictional characters instead of his rendering in comics.[96][97][98] Russ Fischer of /Film described the character as looking more \"Steve Ditko derived\" (the character's original artist).[99] Webb felt that there are different incarnations of Lizard in the comic book. He felt that he should do it without the snout because he was interested more in human emotions and wanted to keep Rhys' presence in the creature. Webb wanted him to have emotion, have a face and have feeling.[42] He stated \"that in a comic book, you just put that thing up there, and you can say, oh, thought bubble, whatever. But when you try to do that and make it look real, it's a different challenge, and I'm creating a movie, I'm not creating a comic book. That was part of the design.\"[95]\n\nWebb \"wanted to do something that felt more contemporary, and was less based in representing panels from the comics\" and focus on spirit over style.[100]\n\nThe \"decay rate algorithm\" that Peter Parker's father worked on in the film was inspired by the real-life Gompertz\u2013Makeham law of mortality. Dr. James Kakalios, a professor at the University of Minnesota known for his book The Physics of Superheroes, discusses using some of his knowledge in creating the equation while serving as one of the film's scientific consultants. He mentions that the algorithm utilizes a variant of the Gompertz equation multiplied with some \"mathematical glitter\" to give it a more complex look in the film.[101]\n\nFilming\n\n[100] Some filming locations in New York were near East River close to the Williamsburg Bridge as shown above. However, most action scenes could not be done there. A 150-foot replica of a piece of the bridge near a tank had to be replaced for some scenes in Los Angeles and some tighter shots and close-ups were done on a soundstage in New York City.\n\nPrincipal photography began on December 6, 2010, in Los Angeles.[102][103] The working title was Fiona's Tale.[104] The 90-day shoot included two weeks in New York City, while the bulk of filming occurred in and around Los Angeles, including such locations as the Henry Fonda Theater in Hollywood, St. John Bosco High School's Gym, Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Mid-Wilshire, and various locations around South Pasadena, San Pedro and Woodland Hills.[105] Sony Entertainment spokesman Steve Elzer explained, \"[T]here is a comfort level in producing a project of this size and scope on your own backlot ... Basing the film on the lot also makes it easier for producers to interact with Sony's in-house visual effects team, and gives the studios greater control of quality and security.\"[105]\n\nSome location shooting took place in New York City. The Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House served as the exterior for NYPD headquarters, and an apartment house at 15 West 81st Street, on Manhattan's Upper West Side, was used as the exterior for the home of Gwen Stacy and her family. A row of houses on Fuller Place in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Windsor Terrace stood in for the Forest Hills, Queens neighborhood of Ben and May Parker. A web-swinging stunt sequence takes place along the Riverside Drive Viaduct in Harlem.[106]\n\nThe film was the first Hollywood production to be filmed with the Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED Epic camera and was shot in 3-D at 5K resolution.[103] Cinematographer John Schwartzman had this to say about the camera: \"Today was Epic, Monday December 6 marks the first day the Red Epic camera was used to shoot a major studio motion picture. I can say for certainty the camera does exist and boy is it ready for primetime, as a matter of fact it's a true game changer.\"[103] Schwartzman felt that the 3D would have been impossible without it. He said, \"I can tell you without these cameras it would be impossible to move a 3D rig in the ways that THIS story demands, if Jim and the crew hadn't made these cameras available to us I don't think we could have shot this movie the way our director envisioned it in 3D.\"[103] Webb wanted cameras small enough to fit on the rigs and swing around very fast, saying that the \"RED Epic cameras were the right cameras to do that.\" Webb continued that \"you need to shoot it with a level of velocity and 3D cameras can be very large... and so we need those cameras to mount on rigs that could fly to the air and run to the streets in a certain pace. That allowed us to do it.\"[107] The Amazing Spider-Man's climax was filmed in a 1:78:1 aspect ratio for its IMAX DMR release.[108]\n\nIn April 2011, Stone revealed that the cinematography had wrapped and that post-production began in May although some reshooting took place in New York City in November 2011 and in Los Angeles in December 2011.[109][110][111]\n\nStunts\n\nWebb stated that he and the crew wanted to keep the stunts more grounded physically, a challenge for a superhuman character.[63] The stunt performers included the Armstrong family,[63] Vic[112] and Andy, along with Richard Norton who plays a SWAT team member.[113][114] Andy Armstrong was the stunt coordinator while Vic was the second unit director.[107] To determine how Spider-Man should swing, Andy videotaped an Olympic Games gymnast swinging on a horizontal bar.[115] Andy noted that in the computer-generated swing in the earlier Spider-Man films, \"he swings down at the same speed as he swings up,\" and this \"constant\" speed is unlike a real gymnast's movement where \"he's accelerating until he reaches the bottom, then as he starts to come up, he's decelerating until he gets to the top of his swing and he actually gets negative gravity, where he'll go weightless for a second, and then the next swing starts, and it becomes another violent swing again.\"[116] Vic felt that Spider-Man's moves were comparable to those of Tarzan, and he wanted to add that in the film.[117] While filming in New York City, they swung a man through traffic down the street. Then, while the crew built a rig hundreds of feet long over Riverside Drive in Harlem, Andy built a car rig with a series of wires to help with effects which Webb said required an \"incredible wealth of acrobatics\".[114] These rigs were over 200\u2013300 feet long and demanded months of rehearsals and design.[107] According to Andy, operating the rigs \"was a combination of a lot of human skills and mechanical engineering.\"[116] The purpose of the rigs was to depict Spider-Man's swing in a way that wasn't computer-generated.[63] Garfield was reported to be involved with some of the stunts.[118] Arad explained that \"Andrew is not only a brilliant actor but he is a sportsman. This gave us the opportunity to try things with him that were it not so it would have been almost impossible.\"[119]\n\nEffects\n\nExternal video on YouTube. on YouTube on YouTube. on YouTube.\n\nThe company 3ality Technica of Burbank, California, produced some of the equipment.[120][121] The film was reported to be the first to adopt 3ality Digital's TS-5 wireless and handheld beamsplitter mirror rig.[122] 3ality technology helped make it possible to avoid 2D to 3D conversion.[120] Webb wanted a new 3D experience for Spider-Man: \"Because we're shooting in 3D, I wanted to conceive of certain things very specifically for 3D. There's an experimental component to 3D that's fascinating and we're experimenting with generating that point of view \u2013 so you feel what Peter Parker feels, you feel what Spider-Man feels when he's jumping over buildings and over the streets.\"[114] He felt that Spider-Man was ideal for 3D, admitting that they \"started making the movie around the time Avatar came out\" which made every studio want 3D. This was Webb's first film using the technique, and he did not want a force-fit or clumsy conversion as he had seen in other films.[68][123] Webb cited childhood films such as Creature from the Black Lagoon and House of Wax for inspirations to push the 3D in his film even further than the type of depth that James Cameron uses in his film.[42]\n\nThe Vancouver branch of Sony Pictures Imageworks was responsible for the digital touch-up.[124] The group improved the sewer and high school battle scene with many of Spider-Man's poses and environments that were used in the film. The comic book was cited as a basic source for Spider-Man's poses.[125] The visual designers helped bring the Lizard to life by first building a digital version of a production design maquette.[125] Many of the staff were involved with the process. They also started by thinking about lizard biology and how his muscles would work.[126] A large man referred to as \"Big John\" stood in as the character during shooting, performing much of the interaction with other characters.[42] The computer-generated Lizard replaced him in post-production.[42] The creators would then fuse the design of the Lizard with the actor Rhys Ifans.[125] Ifans then used motion capture for the Lizard's speaking parts, which Webb found challenging to incorporate into the character's final version.[42][95]\n\nMusic\n\nJames Horner scored the film.[127] Webb described Horner's first musical cue as \"spectacular\". Webb said, \"I wanted to create a score that felt massive and huge but also intimate and small.\".[128] Webb admitted that Horner had the score \"nailed in an hour and a half\". The film also features the Coldplay song \"'Til Kingdom Come\" from the album X&Y.[129] In May 2012, Sony Classical revealed details about the soundtrack.[130] Critics like Filmtracks.com's Christian Clemmensen felt that Horner's approach to writing the score for The Amazing Spider-Man is \"remarkably intelligent\" and that \"Horner's mix of the electronic elements into the major ensemble cues is tastefully handled\". Clemmensen also felt that the piano is \"the heart of the score, following Parker's relationships in their tender and mysterious turns\".[131]\n\nMarketing\n\nMerchandising\n\nSpider-Man and Lizard PEZ dispensers were revealed at the November 2011 Comic-Con first depicted the film's Lizard.[132] In December 2011, it was revealed that Mega Brands had the rights to produce construction sets.[133][134] A Marvel Select Spider-Man action figure by Diamond Select Toys was announced in January 2012\u2014the fifth Marvel Select Spider-Man figure, but the first based on a film.[135] The first look at a Hasbro action figure of the film's version of Spider-Man was revealed at the July 2011 Comic-Con.[136] Hasbro made a radio control speed-climbing figure.[137] Minimates made action figures from the film.[138] Other companies releasing action figures for the film include Hot Toys, MediCom and Kaiyodo.[139] OPI Products released a collection of The Amazing Spider-Man nail polish.[140] Trading cards were also available.[141]\n\nCKE Restaurants, parent company of Carl's Jr. and Hardee's, helped sponsor the film. Chief marketing officer Brad Haley said they would market a new burger as part of the promotion.[142] The burger was dubbed \"The Amazing Grilled Cheese Bacon Burger\". It was promoted through film-themed commercials and radio ads featuring Stan Lee. Spider-Man-themed premiums were offered as part of the Cool Kid's Combo. Tours and PlayStation 3 game prizes were part of the promotion along with a video game.[143] Stan Lee then helped spread the word that fans would also have been treated for a free Amazing Grilled Cheese Bacon Burger in Independence Day if dressed as Spider-Man.[144]\n\nBig Cola was reported to enter a deal for promoting the film.[145][146] The Kellogg Company and the Keebler Company built marketing campaigns around clips from the film.[147] Sony launched a new augmented reality mobile application for the film using Qualcomm's Vuforia platform. Sony's Dwight Caines felt that the \"use of augmented reality technology is a fun way of embracing the 3D aspects of the movie while nurturing the playful kid inside all of us who wants to collect items from their favorite superhero character to share with their friends and family.\"[148] Twizzlers challenged fans nationwide to help the hero build a virtual web of Twizzlers Twists to unlock prizes and exclusive content.[149] D-Box Technologies provide motion simulation for the film in select theaters.[150]\n\nAs is common in Sony films, Sony product placements abounded, replacing the ubiquitous Apple Computer products often used by other studios. The film's mobile phones, tablets, monitors and laptops all came from other Sony divisions. Other placements included Microsoft's Bing search engine.[151]\n\nPreviews\n\nMirror's Edge by writers.

Only a few of these scenes appeared in the The point of view shot in the teaser trailer that was compared to the 2008 first person video game,by writers. This was the first preview audiences had of Spider-Man fully in the new costume in video. Only a few of these scenes appeared in the final cut of the film.\n\nA teaser trailer was leaked on the Internet and aired at San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2011, attached to the superhero film Captain America: The First Avenger.[152] Rob Keyes of Screen Rant felt that \"it takes on a noticeably different tone from that of Raimi trilogy of Spider-Man movies, and presents itself in a similar fashion to what Christopher Nolan did with Batman Begins.\"[153] Some writers observed that the trailer very closely resembles the 2008 video game Mirror's Edge.[154][155][156] After the third trailer was released, Webb defended the point of view footage, saying it was an early rendering and that the CGI was still in production.[42]\n\nA \"sneak-peek screening\" of The Amazing Spider-Man was held on February 6, 2012, in 13 cities internationally: Berlin, London, Los Angeles, Madrid, Mexico City, Moscow, New York City, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Seoul, Sydney and Tokyo.[157] On January 8, 2012, the Spider-Man logo appeared on some of the world's most iconic buildings, such as the Sydney Opera House, the Colosseum of Rome, the Kremlin in Moscow and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.[158][159] The screening revealed a second trailer in 3D, which thereafter appeared online. Glen Levy of Time magazine felt that the trailer's \"dialogue goes hand in hand with the action, rather than be dominated by it\" and that the action scenes from the film looked \"polished and slick\".[160] The special screening included an eight and a half minute extended trailer.[161] Scott Mantz of Access Hollywood felt that the extended footage seemed edgier and more character-driven and that \"the Lizard looks like a great villain\".[162] Peter Sciretta of /Film said that the trailers had left him \"impressed\" and had captured a feeling of dark naturalism alongside Spider-Man's trademark wisecracking.[163] With the second official trailer and the sizzle reel, Webb felt that it was important to provide a more specific idea of the film, such as showcasing Peter and Gwen's relationship and the visual effects, just to display the attitude of the film that he and the crew were trying to create.[164] On February 7, 2012, it was reported that the latest official trailer revealed a link to the viral marketing internet site for the film.[165]\n\nA third official trailer debuted on iTunes on May 3, 2012. The trailer was attached to the 3D premi\u00e8re of The Avengers, the day after.[166][167] The trailer contains what most reporters called a better and more fleshed Lizard.[166][168][169][170] Adam Chitwood of Collider said, \"The webslinging has an edge to it and The Lizard has much more texture. I like Andrew Garfield a whole lot, and the biggest draw for me here is the character work between Garfield and Emma Stone. They look to have some great chemistry and Garfield brings out a... side of Peter Parker that we didn't really see in Sam Raimi's trilogy.\"[171] Sandy Schaefer of ScreenRant felt that \"the darker color palette and 3D visuals shown here look overall quite crisp, even without the benefit of the big screen.\"[167] Webb felt that \"there's a small, intimate little indie movie at the heart of Spider-Man\".[42]\n\nOn May 9, 2012, the first television trailer was revealed which teased a \"4 minute Super Preview\" on NBC with the season premiere of America's Got Talent on May 14.[172] The super preview revealed Spider-Man saving a boy near a bridge.[173][174] Fans and writers rated that scene the highest in the trailer.[175][176] Angela Watercutter of Wired called the rescue scene \"pretty freaking epic.\"[176] Kofi Outlaw of Screen Rant felt that the biggest thing to note \"is the tone and composition of the film\" and that most of the footage \"manages to showcase a version of Peter Parker/Spider-Man that is both familiar and fresh.\"[177]\n\nA six-minute 3D preview was tied in with IMAX 3D showings of Men in Black 3.[178] Sony's Rory Bruer explained that the audience of Men in Black 3 should be a perfect match for this footage and that the six minutes should get everyone excited.[179]\n\nViral campaign\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man. Graffiti of the Spider-Man logo in Seattle, Washington , painted by operatives for the viral campaign for\n\nThe main viral marketing site was revealed in the second trailer in February 2012.[165] The official Twitter account revealed a scavenger hunt by posting \"Property of Peter Parker... Lost\" with the longitude and latitude coordinates of direct markets in major US cities. The missing items included a JanSport backpack. One of the clues hidden in the backpack was a link to a page on the viral site that unlocked countdown timers for the cities of Los Angeles, New York City, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle and Phoenix, Arizona.[180][181] Once the countdown was up, each of the city-specific Twitter accounts for the marketing campaign sent out five locations in each city. A person at each spot waited to give the first person with the password a package and the tag-name \"operative\".[182] These operatives painted the Spider-Man logo as graffiti.[183] The operatives then could view a scene related to the film.[184] The main viral website revealed hints to other websites, such as a photo blog that expressed Peter Parker's point of view.[185][186] An unlocked puzzle there revealed the words \"evolve\", \"through\" and \"engineering\" which when put together led to another website with design sketches on how to build a web-shooter.[186][187][188]\n\nA Daily Bugle website revealed Denis Leary as George Stacy, lamenting the appearance of the wall-crawler and asking whoever spots Spider-Man to e-mail the police. The site hosted the best fan-made Spider-Man scenes.[189][190] People who uploaded images of \"Spider-Man\" on the \"Webbed Menace\" viral site received a poster that sent them to a website for a boxing gym called \"Jerera's Boxing Gym\".[191] The gym was funded by Peter Parker's school. A viral website of that class was discovered. Entering the correct password revealed Parker's class schedule. The Midtown High School site then revealed a Twitter user tracking down Lizard and asked people in Los Angeles, New York City, Atlanta, Chicago, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Austin, Tampa, Minneapolis and New Orleans to stay tuned for details.[192][193] A viral site for Oscorp Industries was also available.[194] The Twitter account that coordinated a nationwide effort to track Lizard sightings revealed locations that had packages containing Connors' shredded lab coat, an Oscorp ID badge and scientific samples of reptilian skin. When unscrambling the letters listed on each sample, the words \"animal dynamics lab\" led players to a new Oscorp Industries site focusing on a science program about reptile genetics. The site depicts Doctor Connors search for interns who could begin applying on May 14.[195] Completing the application and supplying the keyword \"Mutagen\" unveiled a Lizard featurette.[196][197] The Oscorp Industries website contained puzzles that revealed two in-game documents, two video updates featuring Connors and a following cipher that as of July 2012 had yet to be cracked. From there images were then unscrambled, revealing a research project with spiders, a letter from Mary Parker to Richard Parker that exposed his workaholic habits and a Daily Bugle newspaper that contained notes about Oscorp.[198]\n\nOn May 30, 2012, the third (and apparently final) set of challenges in the Animal Dynamics Lab was launched with two new video updates of Doctor Connors, an image of Richard and Mary Parker, letters from Rajit Ratha to Doctor Connors, one from Doctor Connors to Richard Parker and another note to Richard from Mary.[199] On June 1, 2012, a Carl's Jr. in Glendale, California, hosted the next viral campaign by decorating webs and declaring a crime scene due to Spider-Man's apprehension of a serial car and motorcycle thief. It was announced via The Mark of the Spider-Man Twitter feed, and with the code word \"Web of Crime\", a hidden message was discovered, entitled a \"Spider cipher\". The code name \"adhere\" named another sub-site of the Mark of the Spider-Man campaign that revealed crime reports.[200]\n\nOliver Lyttleton of indieWire felt that viral ads such as the webbed menace website seemed a little forced and cribbed heavily from the example set by The Dark Knight with viral games.[201] Silas Lesnick of SuperheroHype!, on the other hand, described the film's viral as \"one of the most comprehensive film virals to date\".[192]\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nT-shirts depicting the film's Spider-Man to help the cause for Stand Up to Cancer were available. Garfield wore the shirt, explaining that \"these shirts underscore the idea that anyone has the power to be a hero. Cancer is one of our greatest villains. I'm proud to join others in standing up to this disease.\"[202] Ziskin's death from cancer was used as inspiration for the cause.[203] Sony created a website for the cause.[204] Columbia Pictures teamed up with New York City cultural institutions to create \"Spider-Man week\" by helping out in the community.[205]\n\nRelease\n\nTheatrical\n\nOn February 10, 2010, Sony announced that the film would be released on July 3, 2012. Release dates outside the US were moved up to June in other countries to increase first-week sales.[207][208][209] Premieres took place in Tokyo, Japan on June 13.[210] The film is rated PG-13 for sequences of action and violence.[211]\n\nHome media\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, DVD and digital download on November 9, 2012, in North America.[212] These releases contain a ninety-minute behind-the-scenes documentary for the film along with UltraViolet download. Other special features include \"Rite of Passage: The Amazing Spider-Man reborn\" and \"The Oscorp Archives - Production Art Gallery\". The discs also contain audio commentary from Marc Webb, Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach.[213][214] The deleted scenes included relationship-building between Peter and Connors which Joey Esposito of IGN thought gives the Lizard a sense of sympathy that is lacking in the final film.[215] The Blu-ray/DVD combo pack contains three disks and also contains a second screen app for the iPad.[216] Sony also included a limited edition gift set on November 9, 2012, containing four disks with the special editions along with figurines of Spider-Man and the Lizard from the film.[214]\n\nWhile released, the film was reported as dominating the sales chart on its first release until the end of November 11, 2012, while its rental chart had The Amazing Spider-Man at number two behind Prometheus.[217] It then became number one in rental and dropped to number two in sales chart after its second week.[218] FX has acquired the TV commercial rights to the film to air in late 2014.[219] The film was included in \"The Spider-Man Legacy Collection\" of five Spider-Man films on 4K UHD Blu-Ray, released on October 17, 2017.[220]\n\nIn April 2021, Sony signed a deal with Disney to let Sony's titles, including past Spider-Man films and SSU and other Marvel content to stream on Hulu and Disney+. A significant number of Sony titles began streaming on Hulu starting in June 2021.[221] It includes films from 2022 onwards. While the deal only concerns the United States, titles from Sony Pictures begun to also be added to Disney+ in regions outside of the U.S., as early as June 2022, starting with the majority of the Spider-Man films.[222]\n\nThe film was released on Disney+ on April 21, 2023.[223]\n\nReception\n\nBox office\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man earned $262 million in North America and $495.9 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $757.9 million.[6] It is the 106th highest-grossing film,[224] the seventh highest grossing film of 2012,[225] the 19th highest-grossing superhero film,[226] the fifth grossing Spider-Man film, the sixth highest grossing film distributed by Sony/Columbia[227][228] and the highest grossing reboot of all time worldwide.[6]\n\nIn North America, the film earned $7.5 million during its midnight run at 3,150 locations, including $1.2 million from 300 IMAX venues.[229] On its opening day, a pre-holiday Tuesday, it set a Tuesday-gross record with $35 million (previously held by Transformers),[230] which would eventually be topped in 2019 by Spider-Man: Far From Home with $39.3 million.[231] The next day, the film dropped 33.4 percent to $23.3 million\u2014the second highest non-opening Wednesday.[232] Over the three-day weekend, it grossed $62 million. This pushed the film's six-day gross to $137 million, which was smaller than those of Transformers ($155.41 million) and Spider-Man 2 ($180.07 million) among past Fourth of July releases.[233] Although the film did not match its predecessors, Sony Pictures stated, \"In the world of re-launched franchises, this is a spectacular success by any measure\".[234] For example, both Batman Begins ($79.5 million) and X-Men: First Class ($69.9 million) (both were non 3D-movies) opened significantly below The Amazing Spider-Man.[235] It remained at the number 1 spot for ten consecutive days, until the opening day of Ice Age: Continental Drift.[236]\n\nOutside North America, The Amazing Spider-Man grossed $51.1 million on its five-day opening weekend (June 27 \u2013 July 1, 2012) from 13 markets, with strong openings in many Asian countries.[237] In India, it earned $6.0 million, a record opening for a Hollywood film. Its final box office collection in India was $20 million making it the eighth highest grossing Hollywood film in India of all time.[238] Kercy Daruwala of Sony Pictures in India felt very confident that the presence of famed Indian actor Irrfan Khan would enhance attendance.[207][239][240] Opening in an additional 61 markets, the film made $127.5 million over its second weekend. The movie ranked number one in over 30 countries. In Indonesia, it broke the opening-weekend record with $4.5 million while, in the UK, it opened to \u00a311.1 million ($18.1 million) which is about equal with Spider-Man 3 (\u00a311.8 million).[241][242] In its last market, China, The Amazing Spider-Man grossed $33.3 million over its seven-day debut, which is more than Spider-Man 3's lifetime box office in China.[243] China is also the movie's highest-grossing territory with $48.8 million.[244]\n\nCritical response\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 71% based on 339 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A well-chosen cast and sure-handed direction allows The Amazing Spider-Man to thrill despite revisiting many of the same plot points from 2002's Spider-Man.\"[246] On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 66 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[247] According to Rotten Tomatoes' yearly lists (by using a weighted formula of the critics review in the site), it was placed number 32 on its list of the all-time best comic book films in 2012 and had fallen to 36th in 2013.[248][249] CinemaScore's audience graded it an \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.[250]\n\nJordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the film was satisfying, explaining that Webb directed with emotional and comedic touches and provided a darker depiction and a stronger romance than the original.[1] Boyd Van Hoeija of Variety described the film as a \"mostly slick, entertaining and emotionally involving recombination of fresh and familiar elements\".[251] A columnist of The Village Voice, Chris Pakham felt that the film was faithful to the comics and that \"Garfield's spindly physicality evokes the Marvel illustrations of the 1960s.\"[252] Conversely, Lou Lemenick of the New York Post wrote that the film was dull and uninspiring and felt that it did not compare to Batman Begins and was \"a pointless rehash in the mode of Superman Returns.\"[253] New Yorker critic Anthony Lane described the film as \"running out of nimbleness and fun, and the promise contained in its title seems ever more tendentious.\"[254] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called the film \"memorable in pieces but not as a whole\" and said that its best element is the relationship between Peter and Gwen, while the Lizard \"is not quite an opponent for the ages.\"[255]\n\nLisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A\u2212 describing the film as \"a friskier, sweeter-natured variation\" when compared to Raimi's work. She explained that the most \"amazing\" element was not the \"blockbuster wow!\" but instead the \"intimate awww.\"[256] Claudia Puig of USA Today explained that \"as a new chapter in the superpowered arachnid saga, it stands on its own quite nicely, focusing more on human emotions than on a panoply of special effects.\" She said \"where Tobey Maguire in the original Spider-Man trilogy was earnest, Garfield's Spider-Man is whip-smart and likably cheeky, with an undercurrent of teenage angst.\" She also called the film \"as much a coming-of-age story as a crime-fighting action saga.\"[257] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press described Garfield's Spider-Man as an arrogant and misunderstood outsider, giving the film a \"restless, reckless energy and a welcome sense of danger.\" She also concluded that Webb was a different sort of director, saying that while Webb's big set pieces lacked Raimi's imagination, they conveyed \"emotional truth\" and \"a pervasive sense of humanity\".[258] However, Ty Burr of The Boston Globe felt that the film lacked the original's pop grace and the pulpy joy, saying the film was \"dumbed down, tarted up\" and \"almost shockingly uninspired\". Burr evaluated it as \"the worst superhero film since Green Lantern\".[259] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune also felt that The Amazing Spider-Man is weaker than its predecessor and described it as \"The Notebook in spandex\".[260] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt that the reboot provided better reasons for why Peter Parker adopts his superhero role, even if the origin story didn't need to be told once again. He also remarked that it was \"probably the second best\" of the four Spider-Man films after Spider-Man 2, explaining that Lizard was lackluster compared to that film's villain, Doctor Octopus, and had the dramatic range of Godzilla.[261]\n\nJoe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal, pointed out that \"the truly amazing thing is that most of what happens to Peter Parker in the first half of the film has already happened in previous chapters of the Spidey saga\", that \"what's old is old again.\"[262] However, Randy Myers from the San Jose Mercury News found it \"the best Spidey yet\", describing it as \"strong, bold and well-acted.\" He felt that a viewer couldn't help but feel d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, but that the work shows greater \"dimension\".[263] Dana Stevens at Slate magazine believed that the film was an \"absolutely unnecessary\" retelling of the origin story, although it avoided \"the common comic-book adaptation trap of gloomy self-seriousness\".[264] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also opined that the \"unnecessary\" reboot pulled stellar performances from Garfield and Stone and touches the heart.[265]\n\nAndrew Garfield received general praise for his performance. Bob Mondello of NPR said, \"Here comes another Spider-dude: This Andrew Garfield guy. So he'd better be really something, right? Well, as it happens, he is.\"[266] Tom Charity of CNN found Garfield's \"combination of fresh-faced innocence, nervous agitation and wry humor ... immediately appealing.\"[267] Stephanie Zacharek of Movieline said she \"had no specific desire to see the series resuscitated. But watching Garfield and Stone made me think doing so wasn't such a bad idea\".[268] Mary F. Pols of Time said that even though the story was familiar Garfield and Webb made it feel \"convincingly fresh and exciting.\"[269]\n\nAccolades\n\nThemes and analysis\n\n\"I have tried to capture how Peter copes with the feelings of being an underdog, his confusions and his self-doubt. This, I hope, has brought, a certain empathy and sensitivity to his character that explains how it helps him become the hero that he eventually turns out to be.\" \u2014Andrew Garfield[277]\n\nWebb described the film as \"a story about a kid who grows up looking for his father and finds himself.\"[78] Both Webb and star Garfield described Parker as an outsider by choice, someone hard to get close to.[78][278] As in the early comic books, the character \"is a science whiz. If you look back to the early Stan Lee and Steve Ditko comics, he's a nerd with big glasses,\" said Webb. He explained \"the idea of what a nerd is has changed in 40 or 50 years. Nerds are running the world. Andrew Garfield made a movie [called The Social Network] about it. ... What was important in those early comics was this notion that Peter Parker is an outsider and how we define that in a contemporary context.\"[63] Garfield compared his Spider-Man fa\u00e7ade as a metaphor for internet anonymity, saying, \"You feel the power of it, the power of not being seen, the power of the mask. Peter becomes witty when he's got that protective layer. It's like he's on a message board. He's got the anonymity of the Internet within that suit, and he can say whatever the @#!*% he likes, and he can get away with anything.\"[279] Garfield tried to explore Parker as an orphan, whom he feels \"are the strongest human beings on the planet.\"[277] He said Parker is \"a human hero [who] goes through all of the same struggles that we all have gone through, especially the skinny ones [who] want more power than they feel they have.\" He believes Parker represents \"a very inspiring, aspirational character that symbolizes goodness\u2014and how difficult it is to be good\u2014but how worth it it is.\"[17] Rhys Ifans compared this film to William Shakespeare's Hamlet on the grounds that Spider-Man can be redone over and over in different ways. He felt that they are similar in that they both represent meaningful archetypal young men grappling with the loss of their father.[280] Critics like Claudia Puig of USA Today felt that Garfield's character as the superhero \"embodies the nerdy Parker, the anguished fatherless teen and the cocky super-hero in equal doses\".[257] Boyd Hoij of Variety noted that Garfield's character as Spider-Man makes an interesting hero in the film because of how it establishes early on that Peter's growing pains along with his search for an identity are common to any teenager and that \"his struggles involve real people\u2014and real lives.\"[251]\n\nStone described her character as \"a daddy's girl\" who is very responsible and protective of her family and loves science.[25][281] She said of her character, \"she offers Parker a world of stability, of a family unit not marred with parental loss and, beyond physical allure, the two forge an intellectual connection over their shared love of science.\"[25] Her character, she explained, \"is stuck between [her father] the Captain and Peter Parker and Spider-Man, who have different ways about going about finding justice in their lives\" which she felt was a fun thing to explore.[26] Dana Stevens of Slate described her character \"as the stuff of a comic nerd's dreams: a sweet, smart, wisecracking dame in demure sweaters, miniskirts, thigh-high stockings and boots.\"[264] Webb felt that the Lizard was the best villain because, \"He's the literal embodiment of the theme of the movie, which is we all have a missing piece. He has no arm. Peter has no parents, and he fills that void with Spider-Man.\"[282] Producer Avi Arad felt likewise, explaining, \"[Y]ou look at Peter, he misses the parents, [and] Connors has one arm. ...[E]motionally, [it] is a very similar problem. It is a cautionary tale.\"[119] Webb said that the Lizard \"is not the worst villain on the planet. He's not a mustache-twirling guy who wants to terrorize people. He believes he's doing the right thing.\"[283][284] Actor Rhys Ifans described his character as a flawed character comparable to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.[285] \"Curt Connors is by no means an evil villain,\" Ifans stated. \"He's not like the Batman villains, like the Joker, who are the embodiment of evil. Curtis Connors is a great man who makes a bad decision. ... [T]hat's the whole magic of the Spider-Man idea. These people are the embodiment of our flaws and our desires that lead to tragedy.\"[286] Ifans described Connors as a force for good throughout his life: \"He's a geneticist who wants to help people, like him, who are limbless. In his eagerness to advance that science, he makes a mistake and that's an occurrence we've seen throughout time, sometimes to our benefit, sometimes to our detriment.\" \"...He is a broken man who wants to fix himself.\"[287] Ifans added, \"I'm not portraying a villain in any sense. Connors does feel cheated by God, and he's looking for answers in science. God seems to intervene.\"[283][284]\n\nWebb said that Oscorp Tower is pivotal as a part of a new mythology of the film. He liked that Parker was connected to the building in some way and to think of it as \"a Tower of Babel in the middle of Manhattan that has something dark and seedy going on in there.\"[288] The critic Roger Ebert described the place as a \"typical comic-book mega-corporation with a madman at the top.\"[261]\n\nLegacy\n\nThe comic-book website Newsarama placed The Amazing Spider-Man on its top 10 list of comic-book films.[289] Mark Hughes of Forbes ranked the film as the seventh greatest comic book superhero film being the highest Spider-Man film in the list while Jacob Hall of ScreenCrush ranked the film as 13th greatest modern Marvel film being the lowest Spider-Man film in the list.[290][291]\n\nA scientist from Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center referenced the film to news organizations in explaining how scientists from the medical center are working on a long-term project involving spider silks and potential human regeneration along with deciphering fact and fiction from the film.[292][293]\n\nOn September 30, 2020, it was announced that the upcoming remaster of Marvel's Spider-Man for the PlayStation 5 would be adding an exclusive suit based on the costume featured in the first film, titled the \"Amazing Suit\". The suit was made available since the game's launch on November 12, 2020, as a digital bonus for the Ultimate Edition of Spider-Man: Miles Morales.[294]\n\nOther media\n\nA video game of the same name developed by Beenox was announced at the 2011 New York Comic Con. They were the development team behind the previous two Spider-Man games, Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions and Spider-Man: Edge of Time. The game was released on June 26, 2012, in Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, personal computer, Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS.[295][296][297][298] Dee Brown of Beenox noted, \"The fact that our game is based on the movie, and the movie is re-approaching the universe in a completely different way\u2014a more grounded, more realistic approach\u2014gives us an incredible setting to play with\".[299] The game takes place after the events of the film.[295] Sony and Gameloft teamed up again to create an official mobile game for the film.[300] Sky Betting and Gaming's online casino website Sky Vegas created a related casino game.[301]\n\nThe comic was released in June, named The Amazing Spider-Man: The Movie #1\u20132, written by Tom Cohen and illustrated by Neil Edwards.[302] A trade paperback was published collecting the two-parter a week before the film's release, entitled The Amazing Spider-Man: The Movie Prelude, which also included The Amazing Spider-Man issues #75\u201377.[303]\n\nThe soundtrack album of the film was released the same day as the film, under the Sony Classical banner.[304]\n\nSequel\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man was originally reported as being the first of at least three films to the trilogy.[305] The sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was released on May 2, 2014.[306] On June 17, 2013, Sony announced two more sequels to follow The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which were scheduled to release on June 10, 2016, and May 4, 2018, respectively.[307] However, in July 2014, the third film was delayed to an unspecified date in 2018.[308]\n\nIn November 2013, Sony Pictures Entertainment chief Michael Lynton told analysts, \"We do very much have the ambition about creating a bigger universe around Spider-Man. There are a number of scripts in the works\".[309] A Venom spin-off had been in early stages of planning at the studio since 2008.[310] In December 2013, Sony announced plans for spin-offs featuring the supervillains Sinister Six and Venom.[311]\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe\n\nIn February 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that Spider-Man would appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU),[312] with the character first appearing in 2016's Captain America: Civil War. Sony released Spider-Man: Homecoming, which was produced by Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal, on July 7, 2017,[313] and will continue to finance, distribute, own and have final creative control of the Spider-Man films. Marvel Studios will also explore opportunities to integrate other characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe into future Spider-Man films. Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) features Andrew Garfield and Rhys Ifans reprising their respective roles as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, and Dr. Curt Connors / Lizard as both are transported to the MCU.[314]\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nPaur, Joey.

The film was directed by Marc Webb, written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves and stars Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curtis Connors, Denis Leary as Captain George Stacy along with Martin Sheen and Sally Field as the uncle and aunt of Peter Parker, Ben Parker and May Parker. The film tells the story of Peter Parker, a teenager from New York City who becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically altered spider. Parker must stop Dr. Curt Connors as a mutated Lizard from spreading a mutation serum to the city's human population.\n\nDevelopment of the film began with the cancellation of Spider-Man 4 in 2010, ending director Sam Raimi's Spider-Man film series that had starred Tobey Maguire as the titular superhero. Opting to reboot the franchise with the same production team along with James Vanderbilt to stay on with writing the next Spider-Man film while Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves helped with the script as well. During pre-production, the main characters were cast in 2010. New designs were introduced from the comics such as artificial web-shooters. Using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED Epic camera, Principal photography started in December 2010 in Los Angeles before moving to New York City. The film entered Post-production in April 2011. 3ality Technica provided 3D image processing, Sony Imageworks handled CGI and James Horner composed the Film score.\n\nSony Entertainment built a promotional website, releasing many previews and launched a viral marketing campaign, among other moves. Tie-ins included a video game by Beenox. The film premiered on June 30 in Tokyo and was released in the United States on July 3 in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D and released in home media in November 2012. Critical reaction was mostly positive, according to review aggregators Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, and the film was also nominated for several awards. The film was a box office success, grossing over $752 million worldwide, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2012, and the highest-grossing reboot of all time. The film's sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, was released on May 2, 2014, with director Marc Webb and most of the first film's main cast returning to their previous roles. A third film is set for 2016 and a fourth for 2018. In addition, Sinister Six and Venom spin-off films have been announced.\n\nPlot\n\nA young Peter Parker discovers his father Richard Parker's study has been burgled. Gathering up hidden documents, Peter's parents take him to the home of his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Sheen), then mysteriously depart.\n\nYears later, a teenaged Peter (Garfield) attends Midtown Science High School, where he is bullied by Flash Thompson (Zylka) and has caught the eye of the beautiful Gwen Stacy (Stone). At home, Peter finds his father's papers and learns he worked with fellow scientist Dr. Curt Connors (Ifans) at Oscorp. Sneaking into Oscorp, Peter enters a lab where a \"biocable\" is under development from genetically modified spiders, one of which bites him. On the subway ride home, he discovers that he has developed spider-like abilities.\n\nAfter studying Richard's papers, Peter visits the one-armed Connors, reveals he is Richard Parker's son and gives Connors his father's \"decay rate algorithm\", the missing piece in Connors' experiments on regenerating limbs. Connors is being pressed by his superior, Dr. Ratha (Khan), to devise a cure for the dying (but unseen) head of Oscorp, Norman Osborn. In school, Peter gets into trouble after a basketball challenge with Flash in which Peter accidentally shatters the backboard glass. Uncle Ben changes work shifts to meet with the principal and asks Peter to replace him walking home with Aunt May that night. Peter gets distracted and helps Connors regenerate the limb of a laboratory mouse. Peter returns home late, having forgotten to pick up Aunt May, leading to an argument with Ben that prompts Peter to storm out. At a nearby deli, a cashier refuses to let Peter buy a chocolate milk since Peter is two cents short; when a thief suddenly raids the store, Peter indifferently observes. While searching for Peter, Uncle Ben attempts to stop the thief and is killed. The thief escapes as Peter finds Ben on the sidewalk.\n\nAfterward, Peter uses his new abilities to hunt criminals matching the killer's description. After a fall lands him inside an abandoned gym, a luchador-wrestling poster inspires him to create a mask to hide his identity. He adds a spandex suit and builds mechanical devices to attach to his wrists to shoot a biocable \"web\". Peter accepts a dinner invitation from Gwen, where he meets and has a tense conversation with her father, police captain George Stacy (Leary), over Spider-Man's motives. After dinner, Peter reveals his identity to Gwen and they kiss.\n\nAfter seeing success with the mouse using lizard DNA, Ratha demands Connors begin human trials immediately if Osborn is to survive. Connors refuses to rush the drug-testing procedure and put innocent people at risk. Ratha fires Connors and decides to test Connors' serum at a VA hospital under the guise of a flu shot. In an act of desperation, Connors tries the formula on himself. After passing out, he awakens to find his missing arm has regenerated. Discovering that Ratha is on his way to the VA hospital, Connors, whose skin is turning green and scaly, goes to intercept him. By the time he gets to the Williamsburg Bridge Connors has become a violent hybrid of lizard and man, tossing cars, including Ratha's, over the side of the bridge. Peter, now calling himself Spider-Man, snatches each falling car with his web-lines.\n\nSpider-Man suspects Connors is the Lizard and unsuccessfully confronts the creature in the sewers. The Lizard learns Spider-Man's real identity via the name on an abandoned camera and follows Peter to school where they fight. In response, the police start a manhunt for both Spider-Man and the Lizard. The police corner Spider-Man and Captain Stacy discovers that he is really Peter. The Lizard plans to make all humans lizard-like by releasing a chemical cloud from Oscorp's tower, to eliminate the weaknesses he believes plague humanity. Spider-Man confronts and battles the Lizard on the roof of Oscorp Tower and eventually disperses an antidote cloud instead, restoring Connors and earlier victims to normal, but not before the Lizard mortally wounds Captain Stacy. Before his death, Captain Stacy makes Peter vow to keep Gwen safe by \"leaving her out of it.\" Peter initially does so by avoiding to go to Captain Stacy's funeral, but later at school suggests to Gwen he may see her again.\n\nIn a closing-credits scene, Connors, in a prison cell, speaks with a man in the shadows who asks if Peter knows the truth about his father. Connors replies, \"No\", and demands Peter be left alone before the man disappears.\n\nCast and characters\n\nFurther information: List of Spider-Man films cast members and List of Spider-Man supporting characters\n\nAndrew Garfield (top) and Emma Stone (bottom) at 2013 San Diego Comic Con\n\nA teenager struggling to find his place in life ever since his parents disappeared when he was a child. A spider bites him on the back of his neck, giving him spider-powers. He becomes Spider-Man [5][6] Garfield described Parker as someone he can relate to and stated that the character had been an important influence on him since he was little.[7][8][9] Garfield drew from his life experiences as inspiration for the role, revealing, \"I was thinking of my history and thinking of the kid at school who I wasn't as strong as, who behaved badly to a lot of people \u2013 including myself \u2013 and who I constantly tried to stand up to but never had the physical prowess to\".[10] Discussing his predecessor, Garfield said he respects Tobey Maguire as an actor and that when he first saw Maguire play Spider-Man he \"was blown away by his interpretation.\"[10] Garfield said in interviews, including one in which he was interviewed by Maguire, that when he watched the film Spider-Man when he was younger, he would jokingly recite Maguire's lines in the mirror with a friend who joked that he would never be Spider-Man.[10][11] On accepting the role Garfield explained, \"I see it as a massive challenge in many ways... To make it authentic. To make the character live and breathe in a new way. The audience already has a relationship with many different incarnations of the character. I do, as well. I'm probably going to be the guy in the movie theater shouting abuse at myself. But I have to let that go. No turning back. And I wouldn't want to.\"[12] After taking the role, Garfield studied the movements of athletes and spiders and tried to incorporate them, saying Parker is \"a boy/spider in terms of how he moves, and not just in the suit.\"[13][14] He did yoga and Pilates for the role in order to be as flexible as possible.[15] When first wearing his costume Garfield admitted to shedding tears and trying to imagine \"a better actor in the suit\",[16] which he described as \"uncomfortable\" and admitted to wearing nothing beneath it since it is skintight.[17] When filming Garfield explained that he had four months of training and described his physical roles on stunts as terribly challenging and exhausting.[18] Max Charles portrayed Peter Parker as a 4-year-old.\n\nA high school classmate and love interest of Parker's,[19] a smart and charismatic girl who is the chief Intern at Oscorp.[5][6] For the role, Stone went back to her natural blonde hair color, from her previously known color of red.[20][21] She felt that she had a responsibility to educate herself on Spider-Man, admitting she \"hadn't read the comic book growing up, and my experience was with the Sam Raimi movies... I always assumed that Mary Jane was his first love\",[22] and having only been familiar with Bryce Dallas Howard's portrayal in Spider-Man 3.[23][24][25] Stone said, \"There's a part of me that really wants to please people [who] love Spider-Man or Gwen Stacy and want her to be done justice. I hope they'll give me license to interpret her my way.\"[21]\n\nOne of Oscorp's leading scientific minds who attempts to engineer a revolutionary regeneration serum to help regrow limbs and human tissue. Something goes wrong, and he is transformed into the monster known as the Lizard.[5][6] Ifans said his character spends the majority of the film as a human. While playing the 9-foot-tall reptile, Ifans was required to wear a CGI suit. Initially, a large stunt-double was used as a stand-in for the role, but Ifans insisted on portraying the transformed character. Commenting on the technology used to bring his character to life, Ifans continued, \"I had a green suit on, and then this cardboard head, and these small claws... Each and every time you see the Lizard, the technology is so advanced now that when the Lizard's eyes move, they're my eyes. If I frown or show any emotion, they're my emotions. That's how spectacularly advanced technology is.\"[28] Ifans said that he voiced the man-beast as well, explaining, \"I'm sure the voice will be toyed with in the eventual edits, but when I was shooting the CGI moments, when I wasn't actually human, when I was Lizard, I looked like a crash-test dummy in a green leotard thing. There were many moments when I had to speak to Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone as the Lizard.\"[29]\n\n\"This is a Denis Leary you've never seen before \u2014 he's not the cool cat bucking the system, he is the system. He's got wit, he's got an attitude, and he's got 500 officers looking for Spider-Man \u2014 who just happens to be dating his daughter.\" [30] \u2014Matt Tolmach explaining Leary's character.\n\nGwen's father and a New York City Police Department captain who hunts both Spider-Man out of distrust and the Lizard for his rampage.[31] Leary explained that he did not know much about Spider-Man in the comics and was \"more of a Batman guy. Not the '60s [TV version||] but the really dark Batman. But my wife was a Spider-Man nut, which was why I went to Tobey Maguire ones.\"[32] He added that long before he was cast as George Stacy his friend Jeff Garlin, a Spider-Man fan, \"said to me, 'The first time I met you, I thought you were George Stacy!' This was like 30 years ago. I was like, 'What?!'\"[32] Director Webb said of his casting, \"[W]e all trust Denis Leary. He's got this attitude, but you love him. In this movie, he puts pressure on Peter Parker. He's on Spider-Man's case, but you understand him. I've said this before, but good drama comes from competing ideas of what's good.\"[33]\n\nPeter's uncle.[34] Sheen admitted he was unfamiliar with Spider-Man other than Maguire's portrayal, and knew little of the character Ben Parker except for knowing Cliff Robertson had played the part.[35] Sheen described his character as a surrogate father, saying, \"I'm dealing with this adolescent who is having problems with changes, with hormones changing and his getting out of hand. I have to give him the marching orders and so forth.\"[36] Webb said, \"You think of Martin Sheen as President Bartlet [of TV's The West Wing]. He has that sense of benevolent authority, but there's something else that's important, in terms of the dynamic that I wanted to explore, vis-\u00e0-vis Peter's relationship with his absent parents.\" Webb felt that unlike the scientifically inclined Peter, Uncle Ben represented the blue-collar working man, a gap that could create a dynamic between the characters.[33]\n\nSally Field as May Parker:\n\nBen Parker's wife and Peter's aunt.[37][38] Field said the main reason she felt she had to be in the film was because of producer Laura Ziskin (they worked together on the 1985 film Murphy's Romance) because she had an instinct that this was to be Ziskin's last film. After Ziskin's death Field expressed her gratitude of being a part of both Ziskin's first and last films.[39] Director Webb felt that \"when you cast someone like Sally, they come with a certain level of awareness and real genuine affection, which for Aunt May is an incredibly important thing to have.\" Webb said that while \"we all love Aunt May\", he wanted to create a tension between May and Peter. \"He's got bruises on his face, and what happens in that moment? That can create some tension, but you want there to be love there. That's what someone like Sally Field gives you.\"[33]\n\nAn Oscorp executive, Connors' immediate superior.[41] Khan said he was offered what he described as this \"pivotal role\" after appearing in the TV drama series In Treatment.[42][43] Webb described himself as a fan of the actor when watching the series along with the films The Namesake and The Warrior.[41] Khan said he was uninterested in the project at first, but that his sons were excited about it and insisted he take the role.[44]\n\nA high school bully who picks on Parker.[45] Of playing the role, Zylka said, \"You just try to focus. As an artist or as an actor, you just try to focus and stay in that world and block it all out.\"[46]\n\nCampbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz portray Peter's parents, Richard and Mary Parker.[47][48] Leif Gantvoort plays the burglar who robs the convenience store. Hannah Marks portrays Missy Kallenback, an unpopular girl who has a crush on Peter.[49] Kelsey Chow's brief role is simply credited as \"Hot Girl\" during the end credits of the film, but the actress revealed to media outlets around the time of the film's release that her character is in fact Sally Avril.[50] Similarly, C. Thomas Howell's character is credited as \"Jack's Father\" at the end of the film (Jack being a boy that Spider-Man rescues on the Williamsburg Bridge) but he is referred to as Troy by one of his fellow construction workers in the film itself. Unlike the previous films, J. Jonah Jameson does not appear.[51] Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee has a cameo appearance, as he did in the previous films. At the 2011 Dallas Comic Con, Lee detailed that he plays a librarian listening to music on his headphones while stamping books, oblivious to the ongoing battle.[52] Michael Massee plays the mysterious man in the shadows who talks with Connors in his prison cell in a teaser scene during the end credits.[53] As to the man's identity, director Marc Webb said, \"It's intentionally mysterious. And I invite speculation...\"[54] Michael Papajohn, who played Uncle Ben's killer in the 2002 film, has a cameo as Alfred, Dr. Ratha's limo driver.[55]\n\nThemes and analysis\n\n\"I have tried to capture how Peter copes with the feelings of being an underdog, his confusions and his self-doubt. This, I hope, has brought, a certain empathy and sensitivity to his character that explains how it helps him become the hero that he eventually turns out to be.\" [56] \u2014Andrew Garfield\n\nWebb described the film as \"a story about a kid who grows up looking for his father and finds himself.\"[57] Both Webb and star Garfield described Parker as an outsider by choice, someone hard to get close to.[57][58] As in the early comic books, the character \"is a science whiz. If you look back to the early Stan Lee and Steve Ditko comics, he's a nerd with big glasses,\" said Webb. He explained \"the idea of what a nerd is has changed in 40 or 50 years. Nerds are running the world. Andrew Garfield made a movie [called The Social Network] about it. ... What was important in those early comics was this notion that Peter Parker is an outsider and how we define that in a contemporary context.\"[59] Garfield compared his Spider-Man fa\u00e7ade as a metaphor for internet anonymity, saying, \"You feel the power of it, the power of not being seen, the power of the mask. Peter becomes witty when he's got that protective layer. It's like he's on a message board. He's got the anonymity of the Internet within that suit, and he can say whatever the hell he likes, and he can get away with anything.\"[60] Garfield tried to explore Parker as an orphan, whom he feels \"are the strongest human beings on the planet.\"[56] He said Parker is \"a human hero [who] goes through all of the same struggles that we all have gone through, especially the skinny ones [who] want more power than they feel they have.\" He believes Parker represents \"a very inspiring, aspirational character that symbolizes goodness \u2014 and how difficult it is to be good \u2014 but how worth it it is.\"[14] Rhys Ifans compared this film to William Shakespeare's Hamlet on the grounds that Spider-Man can be redone over and over in different ways. He felt that they are similar in that they both represent meaningful archetypal young men grappling with the loss of their father.[61] Critics like Claudia Puig of USA Today felt that Garfield's character as the superhero \"embodies the nerdy Parker, the anguished fatherless teen and the cocky super-hero in equal doses\".[62] Boyd Hoij of Variety noted that Garfield's character as Spider-Man makes an interesting hero in the film because of how it establishes early on that Peter's growing pains along with his search for an identity are common to any teenager and that \"his struggles involve real people \u2014 and real lives.\"[63]\n\nStone described her character as \"a daddy's girl\" who is very responsible and protective of her family and loves science.[22][64] She said her character \"offers Parker a world of stability, of a family unit not marred with parental loss and, beyond physical allure, the two forge an intellectual connection over their shared love of science.\"[22] Her character, she explained, \"is stuck between [her father] the Captain and Peter Parker and Spider-Man, who have different ways about going about finding justice in their lives\" which she felt was a fun thing to explore.[23] Dana Stevens of Slate described her character \"as the stuff of a comic nerd's dreams: a sweet, smart, wisecracking dame in demure sweaters, miniskirts, thigh-high stockings and boots.\"[65] thumb|200px|Rhys Ifans described the character that he is portraying as a villain as similar to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde from the classic book of the same name. Webb felt that the Lizard was the best villain because, \"He's the literal embodiment of the theme of the movie, which is we all have a missing piece. He has no arm. Peter has no parents, and he fills that void with Spider-Man.\"[66] Producer Avi Arad felt likewise, explaining, \"[Y]ou look at Peter, he misses the parents, [and] Connors has one arm. ...[E]motionally, [it] is a very similar problem. It is a cautionary tale.\"[67] Webb said that the Lizard \"is not the worst villain on the planet. He's not a mustache-twirling guy who wants to terrorize people. He believes he's doing the right thing.\"[68][69] Actor Rhys Ifans described his character as a flawed character comparable to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.[70] \"Curt Connors is by no means an evil villain,\" Ifans stated. \"He's not like the Batman villains, like the Joker, who are the embodiment of evil. Curtis Connors is a great man who makes a bad decision. ... [T]hat's the whole magic of the Spider-Man idea. These people are the embodiment of our flaws and our desires that lead to tragedy.\"[71] Ifans described Connors as a force for good throughout his life: \"He's a geneticist who wants to help people, like him, who are limbless. In his eagerness to advance that science, he makes a mistake and that's an occurrence we've seen throughout time, sometimes to our benefit, sometimes to our detriment. ...He is a broken man who wants to fix himself.\"[72] Ifans added, \"I'm not portraying a villain in any sense. Connors does feel cheated by God, and he's looking for answers in science. God seems to intervene.\"[68][69]\n\nWebb said that Oscorp Tower is pivotal as a part of a new mythology of the film. He liked that Parker was connected to the building in some way and to think of it as \"a Tower of Babel in the middle of Manhattan that has something dark and seedy going on in there.\"[73] The critic Roger Ebert described the place as a \"typical comic-book mega-corporation with a madman at the top.\"[74]\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nFurther information: Spider-Man in film#Spider-Man 4\n\nFollowing the release of Spider-Man 3, Sony Pictures Entertainment had announced a May 5, 2011, release date for Sam Raimi's next film in the earlier series. By this time, screenwriters James Vanderbilt, David Lindsay-Abaire and Gary Ross had all written rejected versions of a script and Ziskin's husband Alvin Sargent, who wrote the second and third films, was working on yet another attempt.[75][76] Raimi wanted John Malkovich to play his next villain.[75] However, on January 11, 2010, Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that rather than continue the earlier saga, they were rebooting the series with a new cast and crew. Industry reports claimed that Raimi had admitted that he could not meet the scheduled release date and retain creative integrity.[77] Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach and Ziskin continued as producers.[77]\n\nArad later explained, \"We were working on what we called Spider-Man 4 and it was the same team [as with the first three films]. The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and warranted ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [didn't] have a good reason to make another one. And between [him] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story.\"[78] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man.[79] Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented \"as a favor\" to the filmmakers.[80] \"I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma,\" he explained. \"So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And I did a little plot work, but a lot of the plot was done.\" He did \"a little bit\" of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man.[80] In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb \"invited me on set, and I did a little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes\".[81]\n\n\"When you walk out of the theater, I want the world you see to resemble what you saw on the screen. Part of the joy of cinema [is that] you make the impossible look real. I wanted it to be more grounded and more realistic and that went for the emotion of the scenes, the physical action and wardrobe. It's less based in Steve Ditko world and probably closer visually and more influenced by \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" but it is also very much a world of our own devising.\" Los Angeles Times[59] \u2014Marc Webb in an interview with the\n\nDays after announcing Raimi's departure, the studio announced that Webb, whose previous film (500) Days of Summer was his directorial debut, would direct the reboot.[82][83] Tolmach, now president of Columbia Pictures and Amy Pascal, co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said they looked for a director who could give sharp focus to Parker's life.[82] Webb said he \"was a little sceptical at first \u2014 you feel the presence of those other movies. But then I was like, 'How could I walk away from this? What an opportunity!'\"[84] Webb said in the press release announcing him that, \"Sam Raimi's virtuoso rendering of Spider-Man is a humbling precedent to follow and build upon. The first three films are beloved for good reason. But I think the Spider-Man mythology transcends not only generations but directors as well. I am signing on not to 'take over' from Sam. That would be impossible. Not to mention arrogant. I'm here because there's an opportunity for ideas, stories, and histories that will add a new dimension, canvas, and creative voice to Spider-Man.\"[82] Webb felt Spider-Man is different from the Harry Potter franchise, which is based on a small number of novels and \"more like James Bond\" because \"there's so much material in Spider-Man that there are so many stories to tell and so many characters.\"[85] He described the film as \"not a remake\" explaining that \"we're not making Sam's movie again. It's a different universe and a different story with different characters.\"[86]\n\nCasting\n\nIn May 2010, The Hollywood Reporter said the actors who met with Webb to be considered for the lead role included Jamie Bell, Alden Ehrenreich, Frank Dillane, Garfield and Josh Hutcherson.[87] In June 2010 the Los Angeles Times reported that the shortlist had expanded to include Aaron Johnson and Anton Yelchin.[88] At least Bell, Ehrenreich, Garfield, Yelchin, Logan Lerman and Michael Angarano had screen tests.[89] On July 1, 2010, the choice of Garfield was confirmed.[4] Webb stated that he felt he knew Garfield was the right guy when they were filming a cutscene where he was eating a cheeseburger while telling Gwen to calm down.[90]\n\nSony then held auditions for the role of the young Peter, who needed to resemble Garfield.[91] Webb said, \"I think we saw the origin of Spider-Man before but not the origin of Peter Parker.\" Webb felt that when you try to build the film you must build the protagonist from the ground up. That's why he wanted Parker to begin as a child.[57]\n\nIt was reported originally that the film would feature both Mary Jane Watson and Gwen Stacy as love interests,[92] but the website The Wrap later reported that only Gwen Stacy would appear.[93] In August 2010, the list of candidates included Imogen Poots, Ophelia Lovibond and Lily Collins, with Teresa Palmer, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Emma Roberts cited by The Hollywood Reporter as \"potentially in the mix\".[94] In September 2010, Variety reported that the shortlist had expanded to include Stone and Mia Wasikowska.[95] The shortlist was reported to then include Dianna Agron, Georgina Haig and Dominique McElligott.[96] On October 5, 2010, the choice of Stone was confirmed.[19] Webb noted that the chemistry between Stone and Garfield made her the clear choice.[19] That chemistry inspired their off-screen romance.[9]\n\nOn October 11, 2010, Rhys Ifans was confirmed to be the unnamed villain, and two days later his character was revealed to be Dr. Curt Connors / The Lizard.[26][97] Arad said that Lizard is his favorite Spider-Man villain, and he had long wanted to use him in a film.[24] Well before the choice of villain, Arad had had conceptual drawings prepared for the character.[24]\n\nIn November 2010, Martin Sheen was reported to be Uncle Ben while Sally Field was in negotiations to play Aunt May.[34][37] Also that month, Denis Leary was reported to accept the role of George Stacy.[31] In December 2010, Campbell Scott and Julianne Nicholson were in negotiations to play Peter's parents. Khan was originally reported as playing Van Adder until the character's name was revealed to be Dr. Ratha.[40][47] Embeth Davidtz then replaced Nicholson.[48] Annie Parisse was originally reported to play \"the villain's wife\", and Miles Elliot was reported to portray Billy Connors, son of Dr. Connors; but they did not appear in the final cut of the film.[27][47]\n\nDesign\n\nFurther information: Spider-Man's powers and equipment\n\nWebb felt a responsibility to reinvent Spider-Man.[59] One departure from the preceding trilogy was to have Spider-Man build artificial web-shooters, as the character does in the comics.[98] In February 2011, with the launch of the official website, the title and first official image of Garfield as Spider-Man depicting both his costume and web-shooters for the first time were revealed.[99][100] Writer Geoff Boucher of the Los Angeles Times was skeptical of the change, feeling that it was too hard to believe that a financially strapped young man could conceive a wrist-worn device that can instantly produce a strand of synthetic webbing and noted \"the suit lives up to the challenge of being different from the Sam Raimi films but not too different from the classic suit that stands as one of the great comic-book costumes ever.\"[101] Matt Goldberg of Collider admitted that he was not crazy about the costume, explaining that the bug-yellow eyes felt weird to him and the mesh-pattern felt too busy. He explained that the design of the gloves caused flashbacks to the Spider-Man 2099 costume which he did not like, although he felt that the web-shooters looked fine.[102] Webb explained that he felt that \"the web-shooters were able to dramatize Peter's intellect\". Webb paid attention to the question of \"How would a kid make it?\" and then took some license with it. About the new costume, Webb explained that he and the crew \"wanted a design that would make the body longer and more lithe, more of an acrobat, someone incredibly agile and the legs of the spider [symbol on the chest] were something we used to emphasize that.\" He revealed that the film used varying suits for different lighting conditions. They made the webbing on the costume a little bit darker.[98] Webb stated that \"With the costume and the web-shooters we wanted to emphasize that these are things that Peter Parker made\".[98] Webb also looked at the Mark Bagley art in Ultimate Spider-Man for the hero's body.[103]\n\nWhile Webb introduced a few elements from Ultimate Spider-Man, he wanted to keep the mainstream version of Gwen Stacy instead of that world's punk rocker.[103]\n\nThe release of Lizard merchandise designs along with unconfirmed concept art featuring a humanoid-shape with a layer of scales on top instead of a pronounced snout (similar to a dinosaur or crocodile) as in the most recent comics, produced a mixed reaction. Many commenters compared it to other fictional characters instead of his rendering in comics.[104][105][106] Russ Fischer of /Film described the character as looking more \"Steve Ditko derived\" (the character's original artist).[107] Webb felt that there are different incarnations of Lizard in the comic book. He felt that he should do it without the snout because he was interested more in human emotions and wanted to keep Rhys' presence in the creature. Webb wanted him to have emotion, have a face and have feeling.[33] He stated \"that in a comic book, you just put that thing up there, and you can say, oh, thought bubble, whatever. But when you try to do that and make it look real, it's a different challenge, and I'm creating a movie, I'm not creating a comic book. That was part of the design.\"[103]\n\nWebb \"wanted to do something that felt more contemporary, and was less based in representing panels from the comics\" and focus on spirit over style.[108]\n\nFilming\n\n[[wikipedia:File:Above Williamsburg Bridge crop.jpg|thumb|left|Some of the filming locations in New York City were near East River close to the Williamsburg Bridge as shown above. However, most of the action scenes could not be done there. A 150-foot replica of a piece of the bridge near a tank had to be replaced for some of the action scenes in Los Angeles and some tighter shots and close-ups were done on a soundstage in New York City.[108]||]] Principal photography began on December 6, 2010, in Los Angeles.[109][110] The working title was Fiona's Tale.[111] The 90-day shoot included two weeks in New York City, while the bulk of filming occurred in and around Los Angeles, including such locations as the Henry Fonda Theater in Hollywood, St. John Bosco High School's Gym, Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Mid-Wilshire and various locations around South Pasadena, San Pedro and Woodland Hills.[112] Sony Entertainment spokesman Steve Elzer explained, \"[T]here is a comfort level in producing a project of this size and scope on your own backlot ... Basing the film on the lot also makes it easier for producers to interact with Sony's in-house visual effects team, and gives the studios greater control of quality and security.\"[112]\n\nSome location shooting took place in New York City. The Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House served as the exterior for NYPD headquarters, and an apartment house at 15 West 81st Street, on Manhattan's Upper West Side, was used as the exterior for the home of Gwen Stacy and her family. A row of houses on Fuller Place in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Windsor Terrace stood in for the Forest Hills neighborhood of Ben and May Parker. A web-swinging stunt sequence takes place along the Riverside Drive Viaduct in Harlem.[113]\n\nThe film was the first Hollywood production to be filmed with the Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED Epic camera and was shot in 3-D at 5K resolution.[110] Cinematographer John Schwartzman had this to say about the camera: \"Today was Epic, Monday December 6 marks the first day the Red Epic camera was used to shoot a major studio motion picture. I can say for certainty the camera does exist and boy is it ready for primetime, as a matter of fact it's a true game changer.\"[110] Schwartzman felt that the 3D would have been impossible without it. He said, \"I can tell you without these cameras it would be impossible to move a 3D rig in the ways that THIS story demands, if Jim and the crew hadn't made these cameras available to us I don't think we could have shot this movie the way our director envisioned it in 3D.\"[110] Webb wanted cameras small enough to fit on the rigs and swing around very fast, saying that the \"RED Epic cameras were the right cameras to do that.\" Webb continued that \"you need to shoot it with a level of velocity and 3D cameras can be very large... and so we need those cameras to mount on rigs that could fly to the air and run to the streets in a certain pace. That allowed us to do it.\"[114] The Amazing Spider-Man's climax was filmed in a 1:78:1 aspect ratio for its IMax DMR release.[115]\n\nOn April 2011, Stone revealed that the cinematography had wrapped and that Post-production began in May although some reshooting took place in New York City in November 2011 and in Los Angeles in December 2011.[116][117][118]\n\nStunts\n\nWebb stated that he and the crew wanted to keep the stunts more grounded physically, a challenge for a superhuman character.[59] The stunt performers included the Armstrong family,[59] Vic[119] and Andy, along with Richard Norton who plays a SWAT team member.[120][121] Andy Armstrong was the stunt coordinator while Vic was the second unit director.[114] To determine how Spider-Man should swing, Andy videotaped an Olympic Games gymnast swinging on a horizontal bar.[122] Andy noted that in the computer-generated swing in the earlier Spider-Man films, \"he swings down at the same speed as he swings up,\" and this \"constant\" speed is unlike a real gymnast's movement where \"he's accelerating until he reaches the bottom, then as he starts to come up, he's decelerating until he gets to the top of his swing and he actually gets negative gravity, where he'll go weightless for a second, and then the next swing starts, and it becomes another violent swing again.\"[123] Vic felt that Spider-Man's moves were comparable to those of Tarzan, and he wanted to add that in the film.[124] While filming in New York City, they swung a man through traffic down the street. Then, while the crew built a rig hundreds of feet long over Riverside Drive in Harlem, Andy built a car rig with a series of wires to help with effects which Webb said required an \"incredible wealth of acrobatics\".[121] These rigs were over 200\u2013300 feet long and demanded months of rehearsals and design.[114] According to Andy, operating the rigs \"was a combination of a lot of human skills and mechanical engineering.\"[123] The purpose of the rigs was to depict Spider-Man's swing in a way that wasn't computer-generated.[59] Garfield was reported to be involved with some of the stunts.[125] Leaked pictures reveal Garfield with a nosebleed that reports claimed was from swinging.[126] Arad explained that \"Andrew is not only a brilliant actor but he is a sportsman. This gave us the opportunity to try things with him that were it not so it would have been almost impossible.\"[67]\n\nEffects\n\nThe company 3ality Technica of Burbank produced some of the equipment.[127][128] The film was reported to be the first to adopt 3ality Digital's TS-5 wireless and handheld beamsplitter mirror rig.[129] 3ality technology helped make it possible to avoid 2D to 3D conversion.[127] Webb wanted a new 3D experience for Spider-Man: \"Because we're shooting in 3D, I wanted to conceive of certain things very specifically for 3D. There's an experimental component to 3D that's fascinating and we're experimenting with generating that point of view \u2013 so you feel what Peter Parker feels, you feel what Spider-Man feels when he's jumping over buildings and over the streets.\"[121] He felt that Spider-Man was ideal for 3D, admitting that they \"started making the movie around the time Avatar came out\" which made every studio want 3D. This was Webb's first film using the technique, and he did not want a force-fit or clumsy conversion as he had seen in other films.[85][130][130] Webb cited childhood films such as Creature from the Black Lagoon and House of Wax for inspirations to push the 3D in his film even further than the type of depth that James Cameron uses in his film.[33]\n\nThe Vancouver branch of Sony Pictures Imageworks was responsible for the digital touch-up.[131] The group improved the sewer and high school battle scene with many of Spider-Man's poses and environments that were used in the film. The comic book was cited as a basic source for Spider-Man's poses.[132] The visual designers helped bring the Lizard to life by first building a digital version of a production design maquette.[132] Many staff were involved with the process. They also started by thinking about lizard biology and how his muscles would work.[133] A large man referred to as \"Big John\" stood in as the character during shooting, performing much of the interaction with other characters.[33] The computer-generated Lizard replaced him in post-production.[33] The creators would then fuse the design of the Lizard with the actor Rhys Ifans.[132] Ifans then used Motion capture for the Lizard's speaking parts, which Webb found challenging to incorporate into the character's final version.[33][103]\n\nMusic\n\nFurther information: The Amazing Spider-Man (soundtrack)\n\nTemplate:Listen James Horner scored the film.[134] Webb described Horner's first musical cue as \"spectacular\". Webb said, \"I wanted to create a score that felt massive and huge but also intimate and small.\"[135] The film also features the Coldplay song \"'til Kingdom Come\" from the album X&Y.[136] In May 2012, Sony Classical revealed details about the soundtrack.[137]\n\nMarketing\n\nMerchandising\n\n[[wikipedia:File:Spider-Manswinging2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Spider-Man's stunt double shoots a Hardee's/Carl's Jr. commercial promoting the film.||]] Spider-Man and Lizard PEZ dispensers were revealed at the November 2011 Comic-Con first depicted the film's Lizard.[138] In December 2011, it was revealed that Mega Brands had the rights to produce construction sets.[139][140] A Marvel Select Spider-Man action figure by Diamond Select Toys was announced on January 2012 \u2014 the fifth Marvel Select Spider-Man figure, but the first based on a film.[141] The first look at a Hasbro action figure of the film's version of Spider-Man was revealed at the July 2011 Comic-Con.[142] Hasbro made a radio control speed-climbing figure.[143] Minimates made action figures from the film.[144] Other companies releasing action figures for the film include Hot Toys, MediCom and Kaiyodo.[145] OPI Products released a collection of The Amazing Spider-Man nail polish.[146] Trading cards were also available.[147]\n\nCKE Restaurants, parent company of Carl's Jr. and Hardee's, helped sponsor the film. Chief marketing officer Brad Haley said they would market a new burger as part of the promotion.[148] The burger was dubbed \"The Amazing Grilled Cheese Bacon Burger\". It was promoted through film-themed commercials and radio ads featuring Stan Lee. Spider-Man-themed premiums were offered as part of the Cool Kid's Combo. Tours and PlayStation 3 game prizes were part of the promotion along with a video game.[149] Stan Lee then helped spread the word that fans would also have been treated for a free Amazing Grilled Cheese Bacon Burger in Independence Day if dressed as Spider-Man.[150]\n\nBig Cola was reported to enter a deal for promoting the film.[151][152] The Kellogg Company and the Keebler Company built marketing campaigns around clips from the film.[153] Sony launched a new augmented reality mobile application for the film using Qualcomm's Vuforia platform. Sony's Dwight Caines felt that the \"use of augmented reality technology is a fun way of embracing the 3D aspects of the movie while nurturing the playful kid inside all of us who wants to collect items from their favorite superhero character to share with their friends and family.\"[154] Twizzlers challenged fans nationwide to help the hero build a virtual web of Twizzlers Twists to unlock prizes and exclusive content.[155] D-Box Technologies provide motion simulation for the film in select theaters.[156]\n\nAs is common in Sony films, Sony product placements abounded, replacing the ubiquitous Apple Computer products often used by other studios. The film's mobile phones, tablets, monitors and laptops all came from other Sony divisions. Other placements included Microsoft's Bing search engine.[157]\n\nPreviews\n\n[[wikipedia:File:TASM No Sound.ogv||thumb|300px|The point of view shot in the teaser trailer that was compared to the 2008 first person video game, Mirror's Edge by writers. This was the first preview audiences had of Spider-Man fully in the new costume in video. Only a few of these scenes appeared in the final cut of the film.||]] A teaser trailer was leaked on the Internet and aired at San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2011, attached to the superhero film Captain America: The First Avenger.[158] Rob Keyes of Screen Rant felt that \"it takes on a noticeably different tone from that of Raimi trilogy of Spider-Man movies, and presents itself in a similar fashion to what Christopher Nolan did with Batman Begins.\"[159] Some writers observed that the trailer very closely resembles the 2008 video game Mirror's Edge.[160][161][162] After the third trailer was released, Webb defended the point of view footage, saying it was an early rendering and that the CGI was still in production.[33]\n\nA \"sneak peek screening\" of The Amazing Spider-Man was held on February 6, 2012 in 13 cities internationally: Berlin, London, Los Angeles, Madrid, Mexico City, Moscow, New York City, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Seoul, Sydney and Tokyo.[163] On January 8, 2012, the Spider-Man logo appeared on some of the world's most iconic buildings, such as the Sydney Opera House, the Colosseum of Rome, the Kremlin in Moscow and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.[164][165] The screening revealed a second trailer in 3D, which thereafter appeared online. Glen Levy of Time magazine felt that the trailer's \"dialogue goes hand in hand with the action, rather than be dominated by it\" and that the action scenes from the film looked \"polished and slick\".[166] The special screening included an eight and a half minute extended trailer.[167] Scott Mantz of Access Hollywood felt that the extended footage seemed is edgier and more character-driven and that \"the Lizard looks like a great villain\".[168] Peter Sciretta of /Film said that the trailers had left him \"impressed\" and had captured a feeling of dark naturalism alongside Spider-Man's trademark wisecracking.[169] With the second official trailer and the sizzle reel, Webb felt that it was important to provide a more specific idea of the film, such as showcasing Peter and Gwen's relationship and the visual effects, just to display the attitude of the film that he and the crew were trying to create.[170] On February 7, 2012 it was reported that the latest official trailer revealed a link to the viral marketing internet site for the film.[171]\n\nA third official trailer debuted on ITunes on May 3, 2012. The trailer was attached to the 3D premi\u00e8re of The Avengers, the day after.[172][173] The trailer contains what most reporters called a better and more fleshed Lizard.[172][174][175][176] Adam Chitwood of Collider said, \"The webslinging has an edge to it and The Lizard has much more texture. I like Andrew Garfield a whole lot, and the biggest draw for me here is the character work between Garfield and Emma Stone. They look to have some great chemistry and Garfield brings out a... side of Peter Parker that we didn't really see in Sam Raimi's trilogy.\"[177] Sandy Schaefer of ScreenRant felt that \"the darker color palette and 3D visuals shown here look overall quite crisp, even without the benefit of the big screen.\"[173] Webb felt that \"there's a small, intimate little indie movie at the heart of Spider-Man\".[33]\n\nIn May 9, 2012 the first television trailer was revealed which teased an \"4 minute Super Preview\" on NBC with the season premiere of America's Got Talent on May 14.[178] The super preview revealed Spider-Man saving a boy near a bridge.[179][180] Fans and writers rated that scene the highest in the trailer.[181][182] Angela Watercutter of Wired called the rescue scene \"pretty freaking epic.\"[182] Kofi Outlaw of Screen Rant felt that the biggest thing to note \"is the tone and composition of the film\" and that most of the footage \"manages to showcase a version of Peter Parker/Spider-Man that is both familiar and fresh.\"[183]\n\nA six-minute 3D preview was tied in with IMAX 3D showings of Men in Black 3.[184] Sony's Rory Bruer explained that the audience of Men in Black 3 should be a perfect match for this footage and that the six minutes should get everyone excited.[185] The footage revealed an exchange between Peter and Gwen that Brad Williams from WhatCulture.com described as \"brief and cutesy\". Brad found the CGI fairly clean and felt that the film seemed like a perfect match for 3D.[186]\n\nViral campaign\n\n[[wikipedia:File:MarkoftheSpider-Man.jpg|thumb|Graffiti of the Spider-Man logo in Seattle, painted by operatives for the viral campaign for The Amazing Spider-Man.||]] The main viral marketing site was revealed in the second trailer in February 2012.[171] The official Twitter account revealed a scavenger hunt by posting \"Property of Peter Parker... Lost\" with the longitude and latitude coordinates of direct markets in major US cities. The missing items included a JanSport backpack. One of the clues hidden in the backpack was a link to a page on the viral site that unlocked countdown timers for the cities of Los Angeles, New York City, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle and Phoenix, Arizona.[187][188] Once the countdown was up, each of the city-specific Twitter accounts for the marketing campaign sent out five locations in each city. A person at each spot waited to give the first person with the password a package and the tag-name \"operative\".[189] These operatives painted the Spider-Man logo as graffiti.[190] The operatives then could view a scene related to the film.[191] The main viral website revealed hints to other websites, such as a photo blog that expressed Peter Parker's point of view.[192][193] An unlocked puzzle there revealed the words \"evolve\", \"through\" and \"engineering\" which when put together led to another website with design sketches on how to build a web-shooter.[193][194][195]\n\nA Daily Bugle website revealed Denis Leary as George Stacy, lamenting the appearance of the wall-crawler and asking whoever spots Spider-Man to e-mail the police. The site hosted the best fan-made Spider-Man scenes.[196][197] People who uploaded images of \"Spider-Man\" on the \"Webbed Menace\" viral site received a poster that sent them to a website for a boxing gym called \"Jerera's Boxing Gym\".[198] The gym was funded by Peter Parker's school. A viral website of that class was discovered. Entering the correct password revealed Parker's class schedule. The Midtown High School site then revealed a Twitter user tracking down Lizard and asked people in Los Angeles, New York City, Atlanta, Chicago, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Austin, Tampa, Minneapolis and New Orleans to stay tuned for details.[199][200] A viral site for Oscorp Industries was available.[201] The Twitter account that coordinated a nationwide effort to track Lizard sightings revealed locations that had packages containing Connors' shredded lab coat, an Oscorp ID badge and scientific samples of reptilian skin. When unscrambling the letters listed on each sample, the words \"animal dynamics lab\" led players to a new Oscorp Industries site focusing on a science program about reptile genetics. The site depicts Doctor Connors search for interns who could begin applying on May 14.[202] Completing the application and supplying the keyword \"Mutagen\" unveiled a Lizard featurette.[203][204] The Oscorp Industries website contained puzzles that revealed two in-game documents, two video updates featuring Connors and a following cipher that as of July 2012 had yet to be cracked. From there images were then unscrambled, revealing a research project with spiders, a letter from Mary Parker to Richard Parker that exposed his workaholic habits and a Daily Bugle newspaper that contained notes about Oscorp.[205]\n\nOn May 30, 2012, the third (and apparently final) set of challenges in the Animal Dynamics Lab was launched with two new video updates of Doctor Connors, an image of Richard and Mary Parker, letters from Rajit Ratha to Doctor Connors, one from Doctor Connors to Richard Parker and another note to Richard from Mary.[206] In June 1, 2012, a Carl's Jr. in Glendale, California hosted the next viral campaign by decorating webs and declaring a crime scene due to Spider-Man's apprehension of a serial car and motorcycle thief. It was announced via The Mark of the Spider-Man Twitter feed, and with the code word \"Web of Crime\", a hidden message was discovered, entitled a \"Spider cipher\". The code name \"adhere\" named another sub-site of the Mark of the Spider-Man campaign that revealed crime reports.[207]\n\nOliver Lyttleton of indieWire felt that viral ads such as the webbed menace website seemed a little forced and cribbed heavily from the example set by The Dark Knight with viral games.[208] Silas Lesnick of SuperheroHype!, on the other hand, described the film's viral as \"one of the most comprehensive film virals to date\".[199]\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nT-shirts depicting the film's Spider-Man to help the cause for Stand Up to Cancer were available. Garfield wore the shirt, explaining that \"these shirts underscore the idea that anyone has the power to be a hero. Cancer is one of our greatest villains. I'm proud to join others in standing up to this disease.\"[209] Ziskin's death from cancer was used as inspiration for the cause.[210] Sony created a website for the cause.[211] Columbia Pictures teamed up with New York City cultural institutions to create \"Spider-Man week\" by helping out in the community.[212]\n\nRelease\n\nOn February 10, 2010, Sony announced that the film would be released in 3D and IMAX 3D on July 3, 2012. Release dates outside the US were moved up to June in other countries to increase first-week sales.[214][215][216] Premieres took place in Tokyo, Japan on June 13.[217] The film is rated PG-13 for sequences of action and violence.[218]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[[wikipedia:File:Roger Ebert cropped.jpg|thumb|right|The Amazing Spider-Man was the last Marvel Comics based film that Ebert ever reviewed before he died. He regarded it as \"probably the second best\" within the Spider-Man film franchise.[219]||]] The Amazing Spider-Man received mostly positive reviews by critics upon release with critics praising the performance of Andrew Garfield. The review aggregator film site Rotten Tomatoes reported a 73% approval rating, based on 126 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The consensus: \"A well-chosen cast and sure-handed direction allows The Amazing Spider-Man to thrill despite revisiting many of the same plot points from 2002's Spider-Man.\"[220] On Metacritic, as of July 5, the film had received an average score of 66 out of 100, based on 42 critics, signifying \"Generally favorable reviews\".[221] According to Rotten Tomatoes yearly lists, (by using a weighted formula of the critics review in the site) it was placed number 32 on its list of best comic-book movies in 2012 and was placed number 36 in 2013.[222][223] CinemaScore's audience graded it an A-.[224]\n\nJordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the film was satisfying, explaining that Webb directed with emotional and comedic touches and provided a darker depiction and a stronger romance than the original.[1] Boyd Van Hoeija of Variety described the film as a \"mostly slick, entertaining and emotionally involving recombination of fresh and familiar elements\".[63] A columnist of The Village Voice, Chris Pakham felt that the film was faithful to the comics and that \"Garfield's spindly physicality evokes the Marvel illustrations of the 1960s.\"[225] Conversely, Lou Lemenick of the New York Post wrote that the film was dull and uninspiring and felt that it did not compare to Batman Begins and was \"a pointless rehash in the mode of Superman Returns.\"[226] New Yorker critic Anthony Lane described the film as \"running out of nimbleness and fun, and the promise contained in its title seems ever more tendentious.\"[227] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called the film \"memorable in pieces but not as a whole\" and said that its best element is the relationship between Peter and Gwen, while the Lizard \"is not quite an opponent for the ages.\"[228]\n\nLisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A- describing the film as \"a friskier, sweeter-natured variation\" when compared to Raimi's work. She explained that the most \"amazing\" element was not the \"blockbuster wow!\" but instead the \"intimate awww.\"[229] Claudia Puig of USA Today explained that \"as a new chapter in the superpowered arachnid saga, it stands on its own quite nicely, focusing more on human emotions than on a panoply of special effects.\" She said \"where Tobey Maguire in the original Spider-Man trilogy was earnest, Garfield's Spider-Man is whip-smart and likably cheeky, with an undercurrent of teenage angst.\" She also called the film \"as much a coming-of-age story as a crime-fighting action saga.\"[62] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press described Garfield's Spider-Man as an arrogant and misunderstood outsider, giving the film a \"restless, reckless energy and a welcome sense of danger.\" She also concluded that Webb was a different sort of director, saying that while Webb's big set pieces lacked Raimi's imagination, they conveyed \"emotional truth\" and \"a pervasive sense of humanity\".[230] However, Ty Burr of The Boston Globe felt that the film lacked the original's pop grace and the pulpy joy, saying the film was \"dumbed down, tarted up\" and \"almost shockingly uninspired\". Burr evaluated it as \"the worst superhero film since Green Lantern\".[231] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune also felt that The Amazing Spider-Man is weaker than its predecessor and described it as \"The Notebook in spandex\".[232] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt that the reboot provided better reasons for why Peter Parker adopts his superhero role, even if the origin story didn't need to be told once again. He also remarked that it was \"probably the second best\" of the four Spider-Man films after Spider-Man 2, explaining that Lizard was lackluster compared to that film's villain, Doctor Octopus, and had the dramatic range of Godzilla.[74]\n\nJoe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal, pointed out that \"the truly amazing thing is that most of what happens to Peter Parker in the first half of the film has already happened in previous chapters of the Spidey saga\", that \"what's old is old again.\"[233] However, Randy Myers from the San Jose Mercury News found it \"the best Spidey yet\", describing it as \"strong, bold and well-acted.\" He felt that a viewer couldn't help but feel d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, but that the work shows greater \"dimension\".[234] Dana Stevens at Slate magazine believed that the film was an \"absolutely unnecessary\" retelling of the origin story, although it avoided \"the common comic-book adaptation trap of gloomy self-seriousness\".[65] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also opined that the \"unnecessary\" reboot pulled stellar performances from Garfield and Stone and touches the heart.[235]\n\nAndrew Garfield received good notices for his performance. Bob Mondello of NPR said, \"Here comes another Spider-dude: This Andrew Garfield guy. So he'd better be really something, right? Well, as it happens, he is.\"[236] Tom Charity of CNN found Garfield's \"combination of fresh-faced innocence, nervous agitation and wry humor ... immediately appealing.\"[237] Stephanie Zacharek of Movieline said she \"had no specific desire to see the series resuscitated. But watching Garfield and Stone made me think doing so wasn't such a bad idea\".[238] Mary F. Pols of Time said that even though the story was familiar Garfield and Webb made it feel \"convincingly fresh and exciting.\"[239]\n\nBox office\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man earned $262,030,663 in North America and $490,185,894 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $752,216,557.[3] As of December 2013, the film is the 51st highest grossing film,[240] the seventh-highest-grossing 2012 film,[241] the ninth highest-grossing superhero film,[242] the lowest-grossing Spider-Man film, the sixth-highest-grossing film distributed by Sony/Columbia[243][244] and the highest-grossing reboot of all time worldwide.[3]\n\nIn North America, the film earned an estimated $7.5 million during its midnight run at 3,150 locations, including $1.2 million from 300 IMAX venues.[245] On its opening day, a pre-holiday Tuesday, it set a Tuesday-gross record with $35 million (previously held by Transformers).[246] The next day, the film dropped 33.4 percent to $23.3 million\u2014the second-highest non-opening Wednesday.[247] Over the three-day weekend, it grossed $62.0 million. This pushed the film's six-day gross to $137.0 million, which was smaller than those of Transformers ($155.41 million) and Spider-Man 2 ($180.07 million) among past Fourth of July releases.[248] Although the film did not match its predecessors, Sony Pictures stated, \"In the world of relaunched franchises, this is a spectacular success by any measure\".[249] For example, both Batman Begins ($79.5 million) and X-Men: First Class ($69.9 million) (both were non 3D-movies) opened significantly below The Amazing Spider-Man.[250] It remained at the number 1 spot for ten consecutive days, until the opening day of Ice Age: Continental Drift.[251] The film was originally the highest-grossing reboot of all time domestically until beaten by Man of Steel in 2013.[252][253]\n\nOutside North America, The Amazing Spider-Man grossed $51.1 million on its five-day opening weekend (June 27 \u2013 July 1, 2012) from 13 markets, with strong openings in many Asian countries.[254] In India, it earned $6.0 million, a record opening for a Hollywood film.[255] Kercy Daruwala of Sony Pictures in India felt very confident that the presence of famed Indian actor Irrfan Khan would enhance attendance.[214][256][257] Opening in an additional 61 markets, the film made $127.5 million over its second weekend. The movie ranked number one in over 30 countries. In Indonesia, it broke the opening-weekend record with $4.5 million while, in the UK, it opened to \u00a311.1 million ($18.1 million) which is about equal with Spider-Man 3 (\u00a311.8 million).[258][259] In its last market, China, The Amazing Spider-Man grossed $33.3 million over its seven-day debut, which is more than Spider-Man 3\u2019s lifetime box office in China.[260] As of August 27, 2012, the movie's highest-grossing territory is the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta, where it has grossed $40.4 million.[261]\n\nAccolades\n\nHome media\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, and digital download on November 9, 2012 in North America.[268] These releases contain a ninety-minute behind-the-scenes documentary for the film along with UltraViolet download. Other special features include \"Rite of Passage: The Amazing Spider-Man reborn\" and \"The Oscorp Archives - Production Art Gallery\". The discs also contain audio commentary from Marc Webb, Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach.[269][270] The deleted scenes included relationship-building between Peter and Connors which Joey Esposito of IGN thought gives the Lizard a sense of sympathy that is lacking in the final film.[271] The Blu-ray/DVD combo pack contains three disks and also contains a second screen app for the IPad.[272] Sony also included a limited edition gift set on November 9, 2012 containing four disks with all of the special editions along with figurines of Spider-Man and the Lizard from the film.[270]\n\nWhile released, the film was reported as dominating the sales chart on its first release until the end of November 11, 2012 while its rental chart had The Amazing Spider-Man at number two behind Prometheus.[273] It then became number one in rental and dropped to number two in sales chart after its second week.[274] FX has acquired the TV commercial rights to the film to air in late 2014.[275]\n\nOther media\n\nA video game of the same name developed by Beenox was announced at the 2011 New York Comic Con. They were the development team behind the previous two Spider-Man games, Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions and Spider-Man: Edge of Time. The game was released on June 26, 2012, in Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, personal computer, Wii, Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS.[276][277][278][279] Dee Brown of Beenox noted, \"The fact that our game is based on the movie, and the movie is re-approaching the universe in a completely different way \u2014 a more grounded, more realistic approach \u2014 gives us an incredible setting to play with\".[280] The game takes place after the events of the film.[276] Sony and Gameloft teamed up again to create an official mobile game for the film.[281] Sky Betting and Gaming's online casino website Sky Vegas created a related casino game.[282]\n\nThe comic was released in June, named \"Amazing Spider-Man: The Movie\" #1\u20132\", written by Tom Cohen and illustrated by Neil Edwards.[283] A trade paperback was published collecting the two-parter a week before the film's release, entitled Amazing Spider-Man: The Movie Prelude, which also included The Amazing Spider-Man issues #75\u201377.[284]\n\nThe soundtrack album of the film was released the same day as the film, under the Sony Classical banner.[285]\n\nLegacy\n\nThe comic-book website Newsarama placed The Amazing Spider-Man on its top 10 list of comic-book movies.[286] Mark Hughes of Forbes ranked the film as the seventh greatest comic book superhero film being the highest Spider-Man film in the list while Jacob Hall of ScreenCrush ranked the film as 13th greatest modern Marvel movie being the lowest Spider-Man film in the list.[287][288]\n\nA scientist from Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center referenced the film to news organizations in explaining how scientists from the medical center are working on a long-term project involving spider silks and potential human regeneration along with deciphering fact and fiction from the film.[289][290]\n\nSequels and possible spin-offs\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man was originally reported as being the first of at least three planned films.[291] The movie's first sequel was released on May 2, 2014.[292] On June 17, 2013 Sony announced two more sequels to follow The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which will be released on June 10, 2016 and May 4, 2018 respectively.[293]\n\nIn November 2013, Sony Pictures Entertainment chief Michael Lynton told analysts, \"We do very much have the ambition about creating a bigger universe around Spider-Man. There are a number of scripts in the works\".[294] There was talks about Venom as the titular character since 2008 before the series was rebooted.[295] Although the producer Matt Tolmach, speaking of his and fellow producer Avi Arad's next project, a Venom movie, suggested it could follow the shared-universe model of the film The Avengers with The Amazing Spider-Man: \"What I'm trying to say to you without giving anything away is hopefully all these worlds will live together in peace someday.\"[296] In December 2013, Sony officially announced plans for Sinister Six and Venom.[297]\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nPaur, Joey.

Here comes the Spider-Man... again.\n\n\"You seriously think I'm a cop? Cop in a skin-tight red and blue suit?\"\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man is a 2012 live-action film starring Andrew Garfield as the Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man. It is the first installment of The Amazing Spider-Man Series, directed by Marc Webb (the director of (500) Days of Summer), and is a Continuity Reboot of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy. This makes it the fourth Spider-Man film in total.\n\nOnce again telling Spider-Man's origins, this time the film focuses on Peter as he develops his powers in high school. To set the story apart from its predecessors, a Darker and Edgier approach is taken, and a Myth Arc involving Peter's parents \u2014 who were only vaguely mentioned in the previous films \u2014 was established.\n\nThe film also stars Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Peter's Uncle Ben and Aunt May, Denis Leary as Capt. George Stacy, and Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard. James Horner composed the score.\n\nThe film was released July 3, 2012 in the United States, but had been released earlier in certain countries. The initial teaser trailer can be viewed here , and the full trailer can be viewed here .\n\nA video game has also been released, taking place after the events of the film. Expect spoilers on deaths and survivals.\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2, a sequel to the film, was released on May 2, 2014. Andrew Garfield and Rhys Ifans reprise their roles in Spider-Man: No Way Home.\n\nAborted Arc: Initially, the film contained strong hints of Richard Parker messing with his son's DNA (a la Hulk) and that Dr. Connors was involved with the deaths of Peter's parents, while also being more of a loose-cannon scientist (\"Ready to play God?\"); these were kept intact for the trailers. Due to early negative feedback pertaining to the movie's original \"Untold Story\" marketing, these subplots were altered or dropped (along with that tagline), but elements still remained behind in the final cut, leading to a few red herrings and loose ends (see Never Trust a Trailer and What Happened to the Mouse? below). Some of this can be seen in the deleted scenes, as it's evident mostly the Connors stuff got cut. It's pretty watered down from what the early trailers hinted at, but we do have Connors philosophizing about evolution and revealing that Peter's father didn't trust him because he felt he was radical. There's also some stuff about Peter becoming more than his father would have ever dreamed.\n\nThroughout the film, Connors is shown wearing a wedding band and he has a moment while looking into his bedroom mirror at his missing arm and the empty bed behind him. A deleted scene also shows he has a son, so it's left up to interpretation what happened to his wife.\n\nAn intentional example is Peter looking for Uncle Ben's killer, as he ends up learning that being a hero isn't about seeking revenge and so he stops searching in favor of stopping the Lizard and saving New York - basically fulfilling his \"great responsibility\".\n\nAbsurdly-Spacious Sewer: Curt Connors is able to build a personal lab in the sewers of New York City. Somewhat of an aversion since the lab itself is pretty small and makeshift, though the tunnels leading to it are big enough. Justified in that it is New York City, and the sewers there really are spacious. He manages to get cell-phone service down there, though, which is rather unlikely. What is really notable is that The Lizard can infiltrate the school through the restroom toilet, though he has to tear a huge hole in the floor to do so; who knows what else he tore through just to get there.\n\nAccidental Pervert: Of all things for Peter's hand to stick to after he gets his powers, it's the blouse of a random woman on the subway, which is not a good lens for the rest of the passengers to view him through. Naturally, his efforts to remove his hand only end up ripping the blouse off.\n\nAdaptational Attractiveness: Having Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May makes them much better looking than usual for these characters. Due in part to the movie taking cues from the Ultimate Spider-Man comics where Peter, family and friends tend to be younger.\n\nAdaptational Badass: The Stacy family. George in the comics was an elderly and retired police captain, a stark contrast to his younger, badass film counterpart (who draws heavily from John Stacy, his Ultimate Universe counterpart). Gwen was also stated once to be good at science in the comics, but mostly just demonstrated typical Lee-girl qualities; here, she's not only arguably smarter than Peter, but her intelligence makes her so important that Peter would've been unable to save the day without her.\n\nAdaptational Heroism: Along with the previous live-action adaptation of Spider-Man, Peter\u2019s motivation for not stopping the robber who eventually kills Uncle Ben is made a bit more sympathetic as once again Peter fails to help an Asshole Victim. However, in Amazing Fantasy #15 Peter has no such motivation to let the robber get away. He simply didn't feel he needed to as he was tired of being pushed around and let the power go to his head.\n\nAdaptational Jerkass: While not an outright villain per se, George Stacy is here presented as much more antagonistic toward Spidey than in the comics, wherein he's openly supportive.\n\nAdaptational Karma: In an inversion, Ben's killer is never caught.\n\nAdaptational Nice Guy: Flash is a much nicer guy than in the comics and the previous films. When Uncle Ben dies, Peter goes sullen and violent in his grief, and when he gets violent at Flash, Flash just takes it and then asks, \"Feels good, doesn't it?\", implying that he has gone through something similar.\n\nAdaptation Distillation: As usual for comic book movies and like the Raimi-helmed series, but now being influenced by Ultimate Spider-Man in particular. The way Uncle Ben articulates \"with great power comes great responsibility\" to Peter without saying it verbatim is very similar to the way it was handled in the Ultimate comics.\n\nGwen Stacy was Peter's love interest before Mary Jane Watson was created. Her interest in science and role as an intern for Dr. Connors is also similar to her portrayal in The Spectacular Spider-Man. While her personality and the way she interacts with Peter note him revealing his identity to her and her becoming his schoolmate confidante and ally is closer to the Ultimate comics' version of Mary Jane than Gwen Stacy in the original comics or the Ultimate comics.\n\nAdaptation Dye-Job: Dr. Connors is brown-haired in the comics (and in the previous movies) and blond-haired in this one. Aunt May, who is usually portrayed as having grey hair in a bun, has dark brown hair with the odd streak of grey. Captain Stacy is blond-haired rather than white-haired, being middle-aged rather than elderly here.\n\nAdaptation Origin Connection: A less direct example than usual, but everything is caused by OsCorp. Everything. Peter's parents disappearing, the lab that made the spider that bit Peter, much of his Rogues Gallery, all tied into OsCorp. While in the original comics, none of those things were related, the Ultimate continuity does link them.\n\nAerosol Flamethrower: Gwen Stacy uses one to defend herself when she's alone inside Oscorp with the Lizard.\n\nAlliterative Name: In addition to Peter Parker and Curtis Connors from the comics, Irrfan Khan's character is named \"Rajit Ratha\". Word of God says the name of his character was originally \"Van Adder\", a reference to the minor villain Nels Van Adder who took on the Proto-Goblin persona.\n\nAll Webbed Up: How Peter subdues some of the petty crooks he goes after while searching for Uncle Ben's killer. He tries this on the Lizard, too, but it doesn't work for very long.\n\nAlternative Foreign Theme Song: \"0 Game\" by Spyair is the theme song for the Japanese version.\n\nAmazingly Embarrassing Parents: Uncle Ben tells Gwen that Peter has a photo of her in his computer, then tells her that he's Peter's probation officer.\n\nAnti-Villain: Connors works in genetic engineering for the betterment of humanity's medical conditions and dreams of restoring his missing arm. He seems to be a genuinely good man, only working for the shady Norman Osborn. He only becomes the Lizard when his lizard-based serum is slated for public testing without his consent. He tests it on himself to spare others the danger and suffers transformation into the Lizard, which turns him insane. Even as the Lizard, his first action is to go after the scientist who's about to test the serum on aged veterans. Upon being cured his first thought is to save Peter's life, and his second is concern for Captain Stacy as he realizes he fatally wounded him.\n\nApologetic Attacker: Peter really didn't mean to hurt anyone in the subway car.\n\nArtistic License \u2013 Biology: What the movie repeatedly refers as \"cross-species genetics\" (and once as \"transgenetics\") is properly known as \"transgenics\". It also obviously doesn't work this way: you can transfer a few genes from one creature into another without the latter gaining all/most of the characteristics of the former. One of the more famous examples is the transfer of a green fluorescent protein from jellyfish into mice. It makes the mice glow-in-the-dark green, but it doesn't make them half-jellyfish.\n\nLizards can grow back their tails; however, that's the only limb it can restore and the new tail has no bone in it, only cartilage. It's also usually deformed. Now, salamanders, on the other hand...\n\nThe Lizard's Healing Factor is enough to recover from hundreds of bullet wounds in seconds. He recovers lost limbs far more rapidly than any real lizard, but that has always been part of the character; recovering from cuts and shots, or recovering that fast, has nothing to do with the way either humans or lizards heal.\n\nConnors once says that there are no natural ways to hunt reptiles, since reptiles are usually at the top of the food chain. This is astonishingly untrue; most snakes and lizards (the most common types of reptiles) are preyed on by other creatures\u2014birds, mammals, even some large spiders\u2014and typically eat insects or rodents, placing them near the lower end of the food chain. Even reptiles that are at the top of their food chains\u2014Komodo dragons and large crocodilians\u2014can be killed by some things. Sure, Connors was letting formula/insanity talk there - or else giving Peter a deliberate warning - but Peter, who's demonstrably a smart kid, doesn't even blink.\n\nArtistic License \u2013 Engineering: No engineer in the world, particularly not a top-notch one working for an A-class research company like Oscorp, would build the Ganali device in such a way that it could be opened and tinkered with while the countdown continues to run, particularly in the final few seconds.\n\nArtistic License \u2013 Gun Safety: The motorcycle cop that Peter encounters after he webs up a car thief is extremely reckless with his gun. Not only does he fire off multiple shots aimed directly at Peter's head from about five feet away, he does so with no regard for the webbed-up car thief directly behind him and could have very easily killed him.\n\nArtistic License \u2013 Law Enforcement: After Spider-Man catches the car thief, the cop who shows up almost immediately draws his gun and tries to shoot Spidey in the face. Especially egregious since Spidey was unarmed and doing nothing but talking, and the car thief was webbed to the wall not 20 feet behind him, directly in the cop's line of fire. Even if it could be assumed that the cop thought Spidey's web-shooters were weapons, that doesn't remotely justify an immediate lethal response without even a warning or stand-down order, and while a bystander could be hit.\n\nAx-Crazy: Connors as the Lizard. Though he ultimately means to do good, he will stop at barely anything to bring his plan into fruition, and becomes quite mentally unhinged.\n\nBad Liar: Connors in this video log , in which he describes the serum's possible side effects with suspicious accuracy, and ends with an uncomfortable looking statement of \"hypothetically speaking, of course\".\n\nBait the Dog: The robber tosses Peter the chocolate milk the cashier wouldn't let him buy. He is also the one who kills Uncle Ben.\n\nBarbie Doll Anatomy: The Lizard, though considering the anatomy of most reptile species, this isn't all that surprising. Reptilian reproductive organs tend to be mostly internalized, thus Connors', ah, lack of visible anatomy in that area.\n\nBerserk Button: Flash hates being called by his real first name, Eugene, and after Peter does it, this prompts him to beat him up. Only when Gwen approaches him and talks him down does he finally relax and stop doing it. This was done intentionally, as it was the only way Pete could get Flash to stop bullying a younger student, by becoming the target himself. The look on his face when he says it indicates exactly how good a plan he thinks this is.\n\nBig Applesauce: Like the rest of the series, The Amazing Spider-Man is set in New York City.\n\nBig Bad: Curt Connors in this movie, or more accurately his monstrous alternate personality \"The Lizard\".\n\nBig Damn Heroes: In the Final Battle , The Lizard has Peter on the ropes and manages to snag him at the throat with his tail. All looks lost when George Stacy enters the fray firing a shotgun at the Lizard, freeing Peter and giving him the antidote to heal Connors.\n\nBig Eater: Peter is one the night he gets his powers.\n\nBio Punk: Renamed \"Cross-species Genetics\". Spider-Man's powers come from getting bitten by a spider that was making \"biocable\" organic wires. And let's not forget about the Lizard himself.\n\nThe Bluebeard: Peter has a book titled Bluebeard on the shelf by his computer, perhaps as a hint to Peter falling in love with and eventually (accidentally) killing Gwen .\n\nBody Horror: The way Connors first regenerates his lost arm is rather disgusting, being covered in dead reptilian flesh and scales. The regenerated arm itself is (initially) far from pretty, with translucent skin, visible veins, and no fingernails. However, his reaction is one of joy.\n\nBottomless Magazines: Spider-Man never runs out of the web used for his web-shooters, ever. He also seems to be not concerned about cost even though they're experimental tech. This is particularly egregious, given that running out of web fluid at inopportune moments is one of Spidey's defining characteristics. Each cartridge holds several hundred meters of cable, which seems like a lot until you realize that even 500 meters translates into about 1600 feet or 160 story lengths of webbing (easily spent in a few swings going across the city). On the other hand, each cartridge is shown to be about the size of a MicroSD card so it may be that he easily carries a number of carts under the costume.\n\nAverted with George Stacy with his shotgun, who does have to reload at a very critical time.\n\nBrick Joke: Aunt May asks Peter to pick up some eggs but he forgets as he spent the evening trouncing criminals. At the end of the movie, Peter comes home to a worried Aunt May bloody and beaten after the final battle. When she goes to hug him, Peter sheepishly pulls out a carton of eggs from his backpack. A Deleted Scene set at the end of the film takes it up to eleven - Aunt May opens the fridge and finds dozens of egg cartons stacked inside.\n\nA Deleted Scene set at the end of the film takes it up to eleven - To get into the Oscorp intern tour, Peter steals the ID card for one Rodrigo Guevara. In the next scene, as Peter is joining Gwen's group, Gwen is starting to explain to the group why they need their ID cards on at all times...and is interrupted by shouting, which is the sound of the real Rodrigo Guevara being forcibly removed by security.\n\nBullet-Proof Fashion Plate: Averted. Peter ends up with several bruises on his face from his crime-fighting, one even before he gets his powers. They last most of the movie, taking a realistic time to heal, and causing characters to wonder what he's getting up to. The cuts on his chest likewise don't magically heal from one scene to the next.\n\nButt-Monkey: Spider-Man/Peter Parker just loves this trope to bits. It's also one of his defining traits as a character.\n\nByronic Hero: Peter; while generally a nice guy, he doesn't think ahead, resulting in him getting others into trouble and causes him to get his spider bite, is rather stubborn, makes bad decisions, and spends the film stuck between Acquired Situational Narcissism and the anger stage of grief. Character Development helps him improve a lot, but throughout the film he's a very flawed person, something which resulted in a Broken Base among viewers.\n\nCall-Back: The scene where Spider-Man rescues a kid from a car dangling off the Williamsburg Bridge has some very similar shots to the climax of the 2002 film, including Spider-Man in the middle, hanging onto a web connected to the bridge in one hand while holding onto another web (not a cable, as in the first film) holding up the car in the other . Another reference to the 2002 film is at the end. The teacher is giving a lecture and declares that there really is only one story to be told: \"Who am I?\" That's the first line of the 2002 movie.\n\nCanon Foreigner: Gwen Stacy has three brothers in this continuity.\n\nDr. Ratha.\n\nCan't Get Away with Nuthin': This version of Uncle Ben takes it up to eleven: After storming out of the house, Peter tries to buy chocolate milk from a convenience store but is two cents short. Since T-Bone won't spot him two pennies from the (overflowing!) take-a-penny tray, Peter leaves, only to watch a street thug grab a handful of money from the register while the clerk's back was turned. Peter's reward for doing nothing, the milk T-Bone refused him. Naturally Peter doesn't help track down that thug for T-Bone. The dude was a Jerkass, he deserved to be robbed. Of course, that same thug then kills Uncle Ben, who had been chasing after Peter trying to find him. He dies because of two cents.\n\nChekhov's Gun: The \"Ganali device\". Cold-blooded response to temperature changes. The possible risk of being \"taken over\" by the foreign genetics.\n\nChekhov's Gunman: The guy whose son Peter saves during Lizard's first rampage returns the favor with his men's cranes.\n\nChewing the Scenery: In one deleted scene, Connors really gets into this as he contemplates his next course of action.\n\nComforting Comforter: Peter does this for Aunt May.\n\nComic-Book Movies Don't Use Codenames: Averted for once - in all fairness, there's not many things you can call the Lizard apart from 'the lizard'.\n\nContinuity Reboot: The first of two for Spider-Man's film franchise. This particular one serves as a reboot of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy.\n\nCops Need the Vigilante: Discussed. At dinner with Captain Stacy, Peter tries to point out that he thinks Spider-Man is trying to help, but Captain Stacy is firmly convinced Spider-Man is a danger, and points out that he's targeting criminals who all look the same, \"like he's got some personal vendetta.\" Both undergo Character Development, with Captain Stacy realizing that, with things like The Lizard running around, there are things Spider-Man can do that the police can't, and Peter realizing that Spider-Man needs to be more than just a way to avenge his uncle's murder.\n\nCorrupt Corporate Executive: Dr. Ratha, Connors' supervisor, is an unethical and amoral scientist and businessman whose idea for testing Connors' product is going to a veterans' hospital and delivering it as a fake flu shot.\n\nCreate Your Own Villain: Peter is responsible for working on the formula that transforms Curt Connors into The Lizard, and thus feels obliged to stop and cure him. In a conversation with Gwen, he actually says \"I created him\".\n\nCreator Cameo: As per tradition in live action Marvel films Stan Lee returns, this time as a librarian at the school Peter goes to who is listening to music on noise-cancellation headphones as a battle between the Lizard and Spidey goes on behind him\n\nCreator's Culture Carryover: It's questionable whether a scientist, and a British scientist at that, would record his core body temperature in Fahrenheit (\"89.7 degrees\").\n\nCurb-Stomp Battle: The first Lizard fight is a long and very painful beatdown on Spidey's end: the most he can do is delay him for a moment at a time and stop innocent people from getting hurt, but once it turns into a straight fight Peter is very outmatched. It only ends in his favor because he delayed Connors until the police came. Spider-Man: [in an amusing inversion of [in an amusing inversion of Punctuated Pounding ] Don't - [gets slammed into a wall] - make me - [gets slammed into another wall] - have to - [slam] - hurt you! [gets thrown through a door]\n\nDamsel out of Distress : Gwen is not helpless. An intern at Oscorp's labs, she prepares the Lizard antidote there for Peter. When the Lizard himself is coming to the same lab she's in, she refuses to flee while the antidote is \"cooking\", even though Peter begs her to. She sets off the general evacuation alarm and uses a burner to set off the room's fire alarm, fogging it up and triggering the blast doors. She takes the dispersal device the Lizard is after and hides. When the Lizard finds her, she uses the burner and an aerosol can as a flamethrower. The Lizard is more interested in the device than her, so he just takes it and leaves her alone.\n\nDanger Takes a Backseat: Albeit \"danger\" in a Mook Horror Show-esque sense; a car thief attempting to do the deed gets into the driver's seat only for us to see Spidey in the backseat. He then waits a few moments before he begins speaking.\n\nDarker and Edgier: Much more so than the previous trilogy. Andrew Garfield said in a February 2012 interview: \"We haven't gone for gritty, we've gone for grounded. If we try and make Batman , we'll fail. The new Batman is its own thing \u2014 and also in terms of tone, Spider-Man is nothing like that character. Spider-Man is witty, Spider-Man is a kid, Spider-Man wants to have fun, he's a teenager and he needs to go through first love and piss around.\"\n\nThe element of Spider-Man versus the police is more seriously treated and has a larger role in the film's story and \"responsibility\" theme, while in the first film this is briefly touched on.\n\nThe film spends more time on the consequences of Peter's double life, with Peter constantly coming home tired and bruised and making Aunt May worry.\n\nThe film shows Uncle Ben getting shot. He loses consciousness without knowing Peter is at his side so he doesn't get to say last words to him. His death is arguably more tragic since Peter's reason for letting his future killer go is more petty.\n\nDating What Daddy Hates: Gwen Stacy is the daughter of Law & Order Captain Stacy, and is dating the criminal vigilante Spider-Man.\n\nDeath by Origin Story: Peter's parents, Richard and Mary, and his Uncle Ben. Captain George Stacy too.\n\nDeath by Secret Identity: Mostly averted, so far. Of the four people who discover Peter's alter-ego, the only one to die is George Stacy . But considering one of those is Gwen Stacy , it's only a matter of time.\n\nDefeat Means Friendship: After Peter humiliates Flash at basketball, the former bully tries to mend bridges with Peter after Uncle Ben dies, becomes increasingly chummy as the movie goes on. While the pattern fits, his change of heart may be more due to sympathy than being upstaged. Not consciously related, but true to form, he turns into a fanboy of Spider-Man by the end.\n\nDestination Defenestration: During the fight with the Lizard at school, Spider-Man smashes a window and then proceeds to throw Gwen out to get her away from the fight, catching her with a webline first.\n\nDetachable Doorknob: Defied. When Peter Parker first gets his powers and becomes Spider-Man, he has difficulty controlling his newfound strength and makes a mess of the bathroom. As a result, when he leaves the room, he very carefully turns the doorknob to prevent himself from damaging it.\n\nDoes Not Know His Own Strength: After he gets his powers, Peter has various hiccups while coming to terms with his new strength throughout the film. At one point, Peter accidentally gets into a fight and causes property damage on the train home. The next day has one long sequence in which he smashes his alarm clock, wrecks the bathroom, and rips the keys off his keyboard thanks to them sticking to his fingers.\n\nThe climax of the basketball sequence is another such instance, as Peter dunks the ball so hard that he shatters the backboard.\n\nA later scene almost qualifies as Mood Whiplash when Peter gets into an argument with Uncle Ben . He slams the door as he storms out and winds up shattering the glass in the process.\n\nDoes This Remind You of Anything?: Actor Rhys Ifans has likened Connors' use of the serum to a drug addiction, and it's easy to see why: he injects the serum into his arm by means of a hollow needle, it makes him feel fantastic, and he keeps using more and more of it to negate going back to normal.\n\nThe Dog Bites Back: After having enough of Flash playing the Jerk Jock role, Peter proceeds to humiliate Flash in front of the cheerleaders and the rest of the basketball team, by using his new powers to keep Flash from retrieving a basketball, culminating with Peter dunking the ball, destroying the backboard and hoop in the process. Unfortunately for Peter, he has to meet with the principal as a result of this situation.\n\nDonut Mess with a Cop: Defied. George Stacy: \"Do you think we just sit around and eat donuts all day?\"\n\nDrama-Preserving Handicap: Two. First, Spidey gets shot in the leg, affecting his ability to get to Oscorp unassisted, and in the last fight with the Lizard, his mechanical webshooters are crushed. The webshooters had given the Lizard great difficulty in their previous fights, so it makes sense that he would make a point of destroying them.\n\nDull Surprise: Peter's reaction upon finding a giant mutated rat in Dr. Connors' lab .\n\nEmbarrassing First Name: Peter calls Flash by his real name: Eugene.\n\nEntitled Bastard: T-Bone demands that Peter stop a thief after he behaved like a jerk to Peter, but Peter understandably refuses. This is to set up Uncle Ben's requisite death scene, but really, you can empathize with Peter. Anyone who'd put himself in harm's way to help someone who'd treated them like that would have to be a saint.\n\nEvil Brit: Dr. Connors is portrayed by Welshman Rhys Ifans, and speaks accordingly.\n\nEvil Cripple: The one-armed Dr. Connors.\n\nEvil Is Petty: Uncle Ben's murderer is a small-time thief who behaves like a dick.\n\nEvilutionary Biologist: Dr. Connors seeks to make \"a world without weakness\". Though in unusual variation, he doesn't want to wipe out the weak, but to help everybody become strong. And he considers himself one of the weak ones due to his lost arm.\n\nExtreme Graphical Representation: The holographic interface in Dr. Connors' lab.\n\nEye Awaken: The Lizard after the NYPD shoot him to pieces .\n\nFace Cam: Used for one shot of Peter in his Beta Outfit walking around the city at night during the montage of him targeting criminals that look like Ben's killer.\n\nFake Period Excuse: Peter crashes into Gwen's room while heavily wounded after his fight with the Lizard at their school. To keep her father from finding him, she calls off all requests to come down for dessert, then starts to apologize for her outburst by blaming it on period cramps. Immediately, her dad doesn't want to hear any more.\n\nFan Disservice: Handsome, muscular Andrew Garfield shirtless while making out with gorgeous Emma Stone, how could this not be hot? Well, the fact that Peter had been beaten bloody and Gwen was stitching up his wounds certainly detracts quite a few points.\n\nFanservice Extra: After gaining his powers, Peter accidentally rips the blouse off a random attractive woman in the subway, revealing her bra and midriff.\n\nFat Bastard: The clerk has the audacity to rub it in Peter's face that he can't afford to buy milk.\n\nFeghoot: When the final image onscreen is a burst of web headed straight for the camera, followed by the credits proudly displaying \"Directed by Marc Webb\", you gotta wonder.\n\nFemale Gaze: Andrew Garfield, maneuvering around in skintight spandex. Doesn\u2019t really help that Andrew has said he didn't wear anything under the suit\u2026\n\nFive Rounds Rapid: Captain Stacy takes on the Lizard with nothing more than a shotgun and liquid nitrogen, and manages to hold his own until the liquid nitrogen runs out.\n\nForeshadowing: If you look closely during the scene where Peter puts in the equation that allows the mouse to regenerate its leg, you can see the words severe mutation detected . Which makes you wonder why no one noticed that...\n\n. Which makes you wonder why no one noticed that... Peter swinging around on chains at the abandoned warehouse foreshadows his web-swinging.\n\nGwen's dad making Spider-Man promise to keep her out of danger; she dies in the sequel.\n\nIn the scene where Spider-Man is fighting the Lizard at the school, he tells Gwen he's going to throw her out the window and he catches her with his web, but does so using a single strand - which causes her to be forcefully yanked backwards in a way that noticeably would be harmful if she were going any faster. This mistake is precisely what caused her death in the comics. It also leads to her death in The Amazing Spider-Man 2\n\nFreeze-Frame Bonus: When Peter first enters Gwen's room, a copy of Seabiscuit can be seen in a stack of books. Guess who played the star jockey in the film adaptation.\n\nThere is a scene where Peter's computer screen is visible for just a couple of seconds, yet you can make out his desktop background: a photo of Richard Feynman. Now that's a Genius Bonus for you.\n\nFrom Bad to Worse: (Spider-Man stops a car from plummeting into the East River)\n\nMan: Help! My son's in there!\n\n(car bursts into flames)\n\nFull-Frontal Assault: Unlike most versions, the Lizard wears no clothes\u2014except for two scenes (entering Peter's school, and later, being shot at by cops) where he has just transformed and is still wearing a tattered lab coat (doubling as a Mythology Gag).\n\nFunny Background Event: During the scene where Peter is messing with Flash by playing keep-away with a basketball, a bunch of cheerleaders can be seen in the background forming a human pyramid. Naturally, it promptly falls down when they are startled by Peter dunking the ball so hard it shatters the backboard.\n\nStan Lee's cameo has him listening to classical music with headphones that block out external sounds while Spidey and the Lizard battle and tear up the library behind him.\n\nWhile Peter (fully suited up) calls Gwen at Oscorp, urging her to get out, a group behind him are clearly taking a cell phone picture of him while they pose in front.\n\nGenetic Engineering Is the New Nuke: The spider that bites Peter seems to have origins in both fields.\n\nGenius Bruiser: After the Lizard throws Spidey through a wall in one of Midtown Science High's chemistry labs , he mixes a makeshift explosive out of some handy nearby chemicals and tosses it in after him.\n\nThe Ghost: Norman Osborn appears as an image with his face obscured, is mostly talked about, and never seen or heard in person.\n\nGoing Commando: Andrew Garfield has admitted that during Spidey scenes, the suit is all he wears.\n\nGory Discretion Shot: Averted in a scene in which we see a mutated rat-lizard messily eating the remains of the other rat .\n\nGreater-Scope Villain: Norman Osborn. He owns Oscorp and is indirectly responsible for Curt Connors' Start of Darkness. However, he has no direct involvement in the story and never even appears onscreen.\n\nGroin Attack: Spider-Man attacks a car thief with his crotch: he actually flies at him yelling \"crotch\" as he bashes the guy's face with his pelvis. Later, he webs him in the crotch.\n\nHeadphones Equal Isolation: Stan Lee's cameo as a school librarian blissfully unaware of Spider-Man and Lizard's fight.\n\nHeroic Bystander: Uncle Ben dies trying to stop the robber .\n\n. When the Lizard attacks Peter at school, everyone else runs away except for Gwen, who smacks the Lizard with a school trophy.\n\nThe construction workers who help Spider-Man with their cranes in the climax.\n\nHeroic Sacrifice: Uncle Ben is shot trying to stop a convenience store robber which Peter had ignored because the cashier was a jerk to him.\n\nGeorge Stacy gets mortally wounded whilst fighting off The Lizard to buy Peter more time to release the cure.\n\nThe Hero's Journey: We follow Peter from a normal kid, to a vigilante with a vendetta, to a genuine hero under the unwitting tutelage of Captain Stacy.\n\nHero with Bad Publicity: Par for the course, but in this case, Peter is on the run from the entire police force for his vigilantism. And that's even without J. Jonah Jameson's typical smear campaign.\n\nHidden Depths: Flash is very empathetic with Peter after Uncle Ben is shot. Later, he becomes a fan of Spider-Man, even wearing a T-shirt with the spider-logo, and is seen being friendly with Peter. This is entirely in keeping with his comic book character's development\n\nHolographic Interface: Dr. Connors's computer system.\n\nHow Do I Shot Web?: Overlaps with Does Not Know His Own Strength above; Peter, um, struggles with his newfound strength and sticky fingers. Also played a bit more literally with him trying to figure out how to work his web-shooter in his room.\n\nHulking Out: Connors's transformation into the Lizard.\n\nHumanity Ensues: After Connors is exposed to the antidote.\n\nI'm a Humanitarian: Immediately after a terse confrontation with Dr. Connors, Peter discovers that Fred - the three-legged mouse used as the Lizard Serum's first test subject - has mutated into a grotesque reptilian rodent and is in the process of devouring Wilma, the three-legged mouse used as the experiment's control sample.\n\nIdiot Ball: Spider-Man, already a known vigilante, grabs it when he uses devices that have a \"Property of Peter Parker\" sticker attached on, in a scenario in which he knows his smart arch-enemy is lurking around. His enemy quickly tries to take advantage of this mistake.\n\nPeter figures out that Connors is The Lizard after finding a hideous mouse/lizard hybrid in Connors' lab, but he doesn't realize he has actual proof to connect Connors and the monstrosity and instead runs straight to Captain Stacy and gives a You Have to Believe Me! speech that gets him thrown out of the precinct.\n\nI Gave My Word: A dying George Stacy makes Peter promise to stop dating Gwen. Gwen figures this out, but it doesn't make it any easier. Though the last lines hint Peter intends to get back with her after all.\n\nI Just Shot Marvin in the Face: Both averted and played straight in the movie. One scene has a cop fire at Spider-Man... who happens to be standing maybe 6 feet in front of a webbed up car thief. Since Spidey naturally dodges the bullets, it's a wonder the thief isn't shot. Then in the climatic fight Stacy averts this when he keeps his shotgun trained on Lizard and only releases one hand to pass the antidote to Spidey, doing so without also looking away from Lizard and using his non-trigger hand.\n\n\"I Know You're in There Somewhere\" Fight: Peter tries a bit of this on Connors during the fight in the school.\n\nImpaled with Extreme Prejudice: The Lizard does this to George Stacy with his claws.\n\nInsecurity System: The top clearance facilities of Oscorp, like the room full of spiders where Peter is bitten, can be accessed with a simple hand-gesture lock like the ones on smartphones with no need for a keycard or a biometric recognition. Meaning that anyone with a good memory who sees the lock being used will know how to get in undetected. And they don't verify the ID of students claiming to be there for the tour. : \"Do you think what happened to you, Peter, was an accident?\" Deleted scenes revealed that Dr. Ratha recognized Peter and purposely allowed him inside to be bitten, hence the line from trailers : \"Do you think what happened to you, Peter, was an accident?\"\n\nInspector Javert: Captain Stacy and his officers. In their eyes (and this is probably how the NYPD looks on vigilantes in real life), Spidey is a crazed vigilante and they have every reason to be upset about him destroying a sting operation. This is in direct contrast to Capt. Stacy's comic incarnation, where he openly supports Spidey till his death.\n\nInstant Death Bullet: Unlike the Raimi films, when Uncle Ben is shot, he's already dead by the time Peter gets to him.\n\nInstantly Proven Wrong: Implied when Peter Parker comes home and Uncle Ben demands to know why he didn't answer his phone. Before Peter can speak, his phone rings, disproving any story of it being unable to do so.\n\nInvulnerable Knuckles: Averted; even after gaining superpowers, Peter routinely has bloody and bruised knuckles after fights.\n\nIronic Echo: Just like the first film. \"Not my policy.\"\n\nIt Always Rains at Funerals: Heavy rain and black umbrellas abound at Captain Stacy's funeral.\n\nIt's All My Fault: Peter blames himself for Dr. Connors becoming the Lizard, as he helps him with the Lizard formula , as well as Uncle Ben's death at the hands of the robber Peter let get away.\n\nIt's for a Book: Peter asks Dr. Connors about reptiles, claiming that \"he's got school stuff\" when Connors presses him for an explanation.\n\nIt's Not You, It's My Enemies: Before he dies, Captain Stacy asks Peter to leave Gwen alone because he's Spider-Man. Peter at first honors his wish and tries to break up with Gwen, who immediately figures out it's her dad's doing. Neither are happy about it. But Aunt May encourages Peter to go after her, and after Peter listens to a voicemail from the late Uncle Ben again talking about responsibility and rising to challenges, he and Gwen get together again.\n\nJerkass: The convenience store cashier is not only a jerk to Peter but he refuses to let him take 2 cents out of the penny jar to buy some chocolate milk, resulting in Peter refusing to help him catch the robber.\n\nJust Train Wrong: In the scene on the subway, the exterior shots show a train made up of R32 cars, while the interior is clearly that of an R42 subway car. Additionally, while the interior rollsign is correct for a Q train during weekday service (Astoria-Ditmars Boulevard-Coney Island), the Q hasn't used R42 or R32 cars since the first half of the 2000s, and in 2012, exclusively used R 160 B and R 160 A-2 cars.\n\nKarma Houdini: Dr. Ratha, who is not seen beyond the bridge sequence. He was on his way to administer Connors' formula to unsuspecting veterans disguised as a run-of-the-mill shot. However, its possible he was killed when his limo was thrown off the bridge - Peter saved the car, but Ratha wasn't wearing a seatbelt and clearly smashed his head against the glass barrier inside, so it's not unreasonable that he died.\n\nUncle Ben's killer . Peter spent his early time as Spider-Man looking for the murderer, but he hasn't been caught as of the end of the movie, and by then Peter has learned that trying to get vigilante justice isn't the best use of his powers.\n\nKick the Dog: Flash beats up Peter after he tries to stop him from bullying another student.\n\nT-Bone, the local convenience store clerk, refuses to sell Peter a bottle of milk when Peter comes up 2 cents short. He won't even let him take the pennies out of the Take-A-Penny, Leave-A-Penny tray. This leads to Peter refusing to help him catch the robber .\n\nKill It with Ice: Captain Stacy and Peter manage to incapacitate the Lizard by freezing him with liquid nitrogen and then pumping shells into him. However, he soon heals back and the liquid nitrogen doesn't last very long.\n\n\"King Kong\" Climb: Downplayed and Invoked. The Lizard isn't that huge, but the trope is certainly referenced when it scales the Oscorp Tower.\n\nKryptonite Factor: Parodied. When the car thief whips out a knife, Spidey falls to his knees, claiming that his weakness is small knives... and then webs the thief to the wall.\n\nLab Pet: Dr. Connors names his lab rats Fred and Wilma. At no point is a dissection considered.\n\nLarge Ham: When he becomes the Lizard, Dr. Connors has his moments of this.\n\nLaser-Guided Karma: Spider-Man saves a little boy from a burning car. During the climatic crisis, it's revealed the boy's father is a construction worker, and he and his friends later set up cranes for Spider-Man to swing on so he can reach his destination in time despite being wounded.\n\nLast-Second Word Swap: Spider-Man tells Gwen the Lizard is on his way to Oscorp for the Plot Device, and she has to get out of there. Gwen tells him she's not leaving without the antidote he sent her to cook up, and that she's evacuating everyone else, then hangs up on him. Spider-Man: Oh, you have got to be kidding me! Mother ... Hubbard!\n\nLaugh of Love: Peter and Gwen tend to laugh around each other as they gradually fall in love.\n\nLEGO Genetics: How Dr. Connors and Peter develop the serum that eventually turns the former into the Lizard.\n\nLe Parkour: At the end of the teaser, a first person sequence features Spider-Man running along a few rooftops in a manner very similar to parkour, with a good dose of spider powers thrown in for good measure. This is also his default setting when using his powers. It is most evident in the acrobatics he uses when chasing or being chased.\n\nLightning Bruiser: The Lizard is very big, very strong and very fast. Against ordinary humans, Spider-Man himself would count, being much stronger and faster than they are. In his battles with the Lizard, however, he acts more like a Fragile Speedster (albeit one who can take more punishment than normal).\n\nLimb-Sensation Fascination: Connors regards his new right arm as if it was his newborn child, and laughs when he burns it on a desk lamp.\n\nLogical Weakness: The Lizard, being cold-blooded, becomes sluggish when chilled. See the Kill It with Ice entry.\n\nLovable Jock: While starting off as a Jerk Jock (and a pretty violent one), Flash shows sympathy to Peter after Uncle Ben dies . By the end of the movie, the two seem to have become friendlier and Flash has become an admirer of Spider-Man.\n\nMade of Iron: Inevitably, Peter's durability is somewhat inconsistent: he gets realistic bruises on his face and knuckles from fighting ordinary humans, but can keep on fighting after being slammed around, thrown through walls and beaten up by the super-strong Lizard. The Lizard is explicitly shown to have armored skin and a Healing Factor, but it is never made clear whether Peter has any sort of damage reduction power in addition to his strength and speed.\n\nMad Scientist: Invoked: Dr. Connors says that he and Peter's father were called this for their fascination with genetic experiments. Later into the movie, he actually becomes one.\n\nMagic Feather: Peter does this with a kid trapped inside a burning car who is too scared to climb out. Peter: \"Put it on. The mask. It\u2019s gonna make you strong.\"\n\nMale Gaze: Most of the time, when Peter is looking at Gwen, it's always at the bottom of her thigh-high boots. The picture he takes of her, however, only shows the upper part of her body, even though she was sitting in a very Fanservice-y way. Which is really cute of him (although he still takes a picture of her without her consent). Or just not creepy and/or demonstrating that he likes her not because she's attractive but for other reasons.\n\nMasked Luchador: Invoked. After an attempt to find his uncle's killer goes awry, the criminals he's just eluded shout that they'll find him soon because they've seen his face. Peter looks up from his hiding place, a wrestling gym, and sees a lucha libre poster. Guess what that gives him an idea of?\n\nMeta Origin: This movie introduces Oscorp as the common link between Peter and Connors' superhuman abilities, though the sequel takes it even further. Specifically, Oscorp produces the genetically enhanced spider that bites Peter, while Peter uses the company's \"biocable\" project to build his web-shooters, and Curt Connors gets his reptilian mutation after getting involved in an Oscorp project meant to cure Norman Osborne's terminal illness .\n\nMisplaced Wildlife: For some reason, the lizards that lead Peter into the sewers are an African species with a vivid blue tail. They also suddenly have a chameleon's leg structure when they start walking on the web lines.\n\nMonstrous Cannibalism: The lab rodent Connors implants with reptilian regenerative properties eventually turns into a half-lizard mini-monster that devours its onetime cagemate.\n\nMorally Ambiguous Doctorate: Played with in Dr. Connors' case. He is a good man, and has no sinister science-fuelled agenda, but his scientific experiments do turn him into a villain. Dr. Ratha, the intermediary between Connors and Norman Osborn, fits this much better: he plans to test the lizard formula on patients at a veterans' hospital, disguised as a flu shot and shows no concern over the potential effects.\n\nMore Dakka: The NYPD opens up on the Lizard, firing hundreds of rounds at him. Pity it didn't work.\n\nMy God, What Have I Done?: Connors, after being cured of the Lizard, is devastated by the fact that he killed Captain Stacy, which is probably why he didn't resist when he was taken to jail.\n\nNerd Glasses: Curt Connors and Peter's father Richard are both scientists who wear glasses. Peter later finds his father's old pair and wears it in place of his contacts. Even Norman Osborn, who founded the biotech company Oscorp, has glasses.\n\nNever a Self-Made Woman: Besides a few very minor characters, the women in this film exist only in direct relevance to Peter.\n\nNever Trust a Trailer: The first-person sequence from the teaser trailer was shortened.\n\nIn the first full trailer, Peter is eating dinner with the Stacy family and Gwen mentions that he lives with \"his aunt and uncle\", leading some to speculate if Ben dies after Peter starts his superhero career (since the same scene has Peter and Captain Stacy arguing about \"that Spider-Man guy\"), which would stray from the comics. Ben does die before Peter starts fighting crime, as in the continuity of the comics and previous movies, but before this scene.\n\nBen does die before Peter starts fighting crime, as in the continuity of the comics and previous movies, but before this scene. These lines from the first trailer are also gone: \"Do you think what happened to you, Peter, was an accident? Do you have any idea what you really are?\"\n\nThe trailers and TV spots seem to have Peter being haunted by Parental Abandonment a lot more than the film itself. In particular, this line is not in the film: \"The one thing that has haunted me my entire life is finding the truth about my parents.\"\n\nIn the first full trailer, Peter slams Flash against a locker right after the latter throws a basketball at his head. In the final cut, the scenes happen days apart. Ironically, in the slamming scene, Flash was trying to sympathize with Peter after Uncle Ben's death.\n\nCurt Connors, pre-Lizard, seems more villainous or at least morally ambiguous in the trailers than in the movie itself. Lines like \"Ready to play God?\" and \"If you want the truth about your parents, Peter, come and get it!\" are gone.\n\nAlso cut was an entire scene released as part of the promotional campaign where Peter is intimidated by Gwen's doorman at her apartment.\n\nA short exchange between Peter and a football coach in the scene where Gwen and Peter are sitting on the bleachers was in at least one trailer, but not the movie.\n\nAlso missing is the trailer conversation where Gwen says that her father has 500 people looking for Spider-Man, which Peter calls excessive.\n\nOne trailer shows Peter captured, kneeling, and having his mask dramatically pulled off. In the film, Peter springs back into action just as his mask gets pulled off, and moves so fast that the cops can't get a good look at his face... almost.\n\nThat rainy funeral that's shown? It's been blue-filtered in the film, while it's still sunny in the trailer version. It's also Captain Stacy's, not Uncle Ben's.\n\nNext Sunday A.D.: A retroactive example since the second film confirms that it's taking place in 2014, the same year it was released, and shows Peter and Gwen graduating meaning this film instead takes place in 2013 since both of them are confirmed to be 17.\n\nNice Job Breaking It, Hero: Captain Stacy tells Peter that if the police wanted Spider-Man to bust that car thief, they would have done it themselves. When Peter, annoyed that Stacy has such a low opinion of Spider-Man, tempts fate and asks why they didn't, Stacy explains that the thief was being tailed by an elaborate undercover operation and they were hoping to bust his whole gang, which won't happen since Spider-Man captured him instead. Oops. Bonus points for Stacy pointing out that Spider-Man spends more time beating up criminals than actually helping their victims, like he has some sort of vendetta, which is true because he is mainly hunting for the thief who shot his uncle.\n\nNotice This: A rare non-video game example; When Spidey is on a rooftop trying to get to Oscorp in time, an overhead helicopter shines a spotlight, first on him, then to the cranes the construction works have set up so he can swing there more quickly.\n\nNot Quite Back to Normal: The Stinger reveals the antidote hasn't quite cured Connors of all traces of the lizard serum.\n\nOh, Crap!: After Peter accidentally breaks the backboard of the basketball net, he gets a particularly lovely one (around 1:12).\n\nOne Degree of Separation: Spider-Man is being hunted by the police, led by Captain George Stacy; Captain Stacy's daughter Gwen is an intern at Oscorp and working with Dr. Curt Connors; Dr. Connors used to work with Richard Parker; Richard's son Peter is High-School Sweethearts with Gwen Stacy; Gwen's father is leading the police in their hunt for Spider-Man, who just happens to be Peter Parker.\n\nOne-Woman Wail: Whenever the Lizard is about to emerge or wreak havoc, the soundtrack invokes this trope to make his appearance all the more unnerving.\n\nOrdinary High-School Student: Like the first film, Peter starts out as a high school student. Unlike the first film, he stays one for the movie's duration.\n\nPapa Wolf: Curt Connors toward Peter, eventually. In the mid-credits scene, he sees The Man In The Shadows, who makes a veiled threat against Peter. Connors' response is a snarled \"You should leave him alone!\" .\n\nParental Abandonment: Once again, Peter is raised by his aunt and uncle. However, taking a page from the Ultimate universe, Peter knew his parents for several years before their deaths, and both Richard and Mary Parker appear on screen.\n\nParental Substitute: Aside from Uncle Ben and Aunt May, Curt Connors acts as one for Peter Parker. They share a love of science and it becomes clear that Peter desires Connors' approval, something he never really got from his dad.\n\nPersonal Gain Hurts: Peter uses his new powers to get back at Flash and sets off a chain of events that ultimately lead to Uncle Ben's death (hinging on Peter thinking of himself first before others).\n\nPet the Dog: Flash sympathizes with Peter after Uncle Ben's death and is the only student other than Gwen to make an effort to do so. By the end of the film, he's making an effort to be friends with Peter and is proudly wearing a Spider-Man shirt .\n\n. Curt Connors refuses to do human testing a week early like his benefactor demands, and only backpedals on that after all his funding is pulled from him.\n\nThe Lizard could have easily murdered Gwen when he went to retrieve the device and the fire was barely a deterrent at all, so it's clear that some part of Connors was still in control since he didn't hurt her.\n\nPolice Are Useless: Averted. The NYPD are shown to be more than capable of taking down regular criminals as well as the Lizard and Spider-Man, though they're outclassed by the Lizard. Lampshaded by Captain Stacy. \"Do you think we just sit around and eat doughnuts all day?\"\n\nPragmatic Adaptation: Because of the setting update to contemporary times, the spider that bites Peter is no longer radioactive, but genetically engineered, just like the Ultimate Spider-Man comic on which this film is largely based, as well the first film. In school, Peter is somewhat less of a stereotypical nerd and more of a loner with zero friends except Gwen. Initially, he wears contacts instead of Nerd Glasses. Word of God justifies this as modernizing the \"outsider\" aspect of Peter Parker's character. It's in more private or personal situations, like at home and with Dr. Connors (and as Spider-Man) where his science-y side shows.\n\nProduct Placement: Everyone uses some form of Sony gadget. Dr. Connors, for example, uses a Vaio laptop. Peter Parker uses the Bing search engine in Internet Explorer 9, and researches spider bites on WebMd.com.\n\nProfessor Guinea Pig: Invoked, as a last resort, to prevent innocent veterans from receiving the untested formula. Dr. Connors test his incomplete serum on himself. You can guess how well it pans out.\n\nPunctuated Pounding: Inverted, as while Spidey is being pounded by The Lizard, he's the one talking. Spider-man: Don't...*hit*....make me....*hit*...have to....*hit*.....hurt you!\n\nRace Lift: Sally Avril appears in a small role, played by Asian-American actress Kelsey Chow.\n\nThe Real Heroes: One of the construction workers recognizes Spider-Man as the one who saved his son, and sees that he's injured and struggling to make it to the Oscorp building. Rather than fleeing with the rest of Manhattan, he and his fellows on construction sites along Sixth Ave line up their cranes so Spider-Man can get there more easily. As they assemble, an American flag is rather prominently displayed in the middle of the screen.\n\nReasonable Authority Figure: Yes, Captain Stacy does not appreciate Spider-Man beating up criminals and Peter seems to think that the Captain doesn't like the NYPD being shown up, but when confronted over dinner, Captain Stacy explains that his officers had been tracking the car thief in the hopes of uncovering a larger operation before Spider-Man screwed it up and that the Spider-Man's actions of primarily targeting criminals of a similar appearance fit the profile of a vigilante looking for a specific target. When Peter rushes into the police department to report that Dr. Connors is the Lizard, Captain Stacy's dismissive attitude is entirely understandable, but he still hears Peter out and instructs an officer to investigate Dr. Connors . Once Peter is caught by Stacy and his identity revealed to him, George ends up letting him go so he can stop the Lizard. Even on his deathbed, he encourages Peter to keep being Spider-Man, even though the police still won't like it.\n\n\"The Reason You Suck\" Speech: Unintentional, but Captain Stacy makes some very good points in his argument with Peter over whether or not Cops Need the Vigilante. Stacy doesn't realize he's talking to Spider-Man, but his words give Peter a big push towards transforming himself, and Spider-Man, into an actual hero.\n\nRemake Cameo: During the bridge scene, before Dr. Ratha's car is attacked by the Lizard , his driver steps out to see what's holding up traffic on the bridge. Take a good, long look at the driver. That's Michael Papajohn, who played Uncle Ben's killer's accomplice in the first film.\n\nReptiles Are Abhorrent: The Lizard obviously is.\n\nRevenge Before Reason: Throughout the film, Peter is very self-destructive with his abilities, desiring revenge on the man who killed Uncle Ben and when he realises a car thief he apprehends isn't the one he's looking for, states that it could have gotten \"A lot worse\". While he does become more heroic, at the end of the film, Peter still hasn't found Uncle Ben's killer.\n\nRing-Ring-CRUNCH!: In a hilarious display of strength, Peter wakes up annoyed and promptly destroys his alarm clock.\n\nRoom Full of Crazy: Connors has filled the walls of his sewer lair with mathematical equations; later he does the same to his cell inside Beloit Psychiatric Hospital.\n\nRousseau Was Right: Every major character, with the possible exception of The Man in the Shadows , seems to be acting out of what they see as right. Even Ratha pressuring Connors to cut corners in order to save Osborn's life could be argued as well-intentioned; Osborn did create and owns a company that researches several cutting edge technologies that are beneficial to the public. Spider-Man himself is initially an aversion \u2014 at first, he's primarily pursuing a personal vendetta against his uncle's murderer.\n\nRule of Three: Three times, Peter Cannot Spit It Out to Gwen Stacy while she figures it out for herself. First when trying to asking her out on a date, second when trying to tell her his secret identity, and third when having to tell her he promised to her father that he'd stop dating her.\n\nSave the Villain: Inverted. Connors, after being cured of his Lizard form and its personality, saves Peter from falling off the Oscorp building.\n\nScare Chord: Used (rather haphazardly) when Gwen Stacy is hiding from The Lizard.\n\nScience Hero: This side of Spider-Man is more emphasized, or at least more immediately apparent, than in the previous movies. His high school is even called \"Midtown Science\".\n\nScience Is Bad: Subverted. Although the main villain is a scientist, the movie avoids a cheap \"don't play God\" Aesop, exploring the various implications of science affecting human nature.\n\nSean Connery Is About to Shoot You: The final shot of the movie.\n\nSecret-Keeper: Peter tells Gwen that he's Spider-Man, and Connors figured it out after finding a camera with \"Property of Peter Parker\" labeled on it webbed to the wall of the sewer. Captain Stacy finds out near the end, but alas, he dies . It's also possible that Aunt May has already figured it out at the end. Since Dr. Connors is cured from his lizard formula , he may keep Peter's identity as Spider-Man a secret while jailed to prevent anyone else trying to find out about his identity that could bring potential harm to those close to him.\n\nSequel Hook: Not only was a sequel announced before the movie was released, but some points of the film are deliberately left unresolved such as Uncle Ben's killer never being caught , the mid-credits scene, and what happened to Peter's parents.\n\nSewer Gator: Not a gator, but the Lizard not only takes residence in the sewer, but also makes a small lab inside.\n\nShapeshifter Baggage: Dr. Connors gets huge amounts of extra body mass and grows several feet in height when he turns into the Lizard, and likewise loses it all when he returns to human form.\n\nShown Their Work: When Peter wants to play a certain video on a computer, he simply hits the spacebar. This is a \"Play/Pause\" key for many video programs and websites, including YouTube, but not many people actually know that. Peter being a really smart guy, it makes sense.\n\nVan Adder isn't an original creation for the film, he's a very obscure Spider-Man villain called the Proto-Goblin. How obscure? The character's sole appearance was in an issue of Peter Parker: Spider-Man written in 1999, as someone Norman Osborn tested the Goblin Serum on before he used it himself. This is lost in the final version however, as Irrfan Khan's character has been renamed \"Dr Rajit Ratha\".\n\nSlasher Smile: The Lizard seems to have a permanent one of these.\n\nSoundtrack Dissonance: Played for Laughs in a scene where Spider-Man and the Lizard duke it out in the school library... and the only sound we hear is high-spirited classical music played in the librarian's headphones.\n\nSpider-Sense: In this iteration, a distinctive sound effect plays when Spider-Man detects trouble. This is most noticeable just before he leaps off Gwen's apartment building after their date and when George Stacy removes his mask .\n\nStalking Is Love: Gwen Stacy doesn't have much of a problem with finding out she graces the background of Peter's computer, or him attending a tour of hers that he clearly didn't sign up for note he didn't sign up for the tour for her sake , or him repeatedly visiting her room via the window rather than by the door note he explains it as being scared of the doorman the first time and by the second she knows he's Spidey . May be lampshaded by showing she owns several Twilight books.\n\nStealth Hi/Bye: In the scene with the car thief, Spidey somehow manages to slip into the locked car without either the thief or the actual owner noticing him. Furthermore, when the thief makes a break for it through the window, Spidey slips out of the car himself without a sound, and then jumps at the thief from behind. Batman would be proud.\n\nThe Stinger: In a mid-credits scene, Connors is shown being led to his jail room which is dark, lit only by a light from a window. Someone then asks him whether he has told Peter the truth about his father. In the credits he is listed as \"Man in Shadows\", played by Michael Massee.\n\nStock Footage: A few CGI web-swinging shots of Spider-Man were actually taken from the previous trilogy (mainly from Spider-Man 2 and 3), with the new costume digitally \"painted\" over the old one (and, in at least one case, the shot being vertically flipped).\n\nStop, or I Will Shoot!: The cops are insanely aggressive, opening fire on Spider-Man twice, once for being rude, and in another scene for fleeing. At least in the second case, they seemed to be using non-lethal force. In the first, Spidey would've been dead had he not dodged.(and the perp would've been dead had the cop not missed.)\n\nStrolling Through the Chaos: Given a stationary variant when Stan Lee makes his cameo. He stands with his back to Spidey's battle, oblivious to the fact that the library is being destroyed around him.\n\nSuperior Species: Dr. Connors believes that his Lizard form is a superior creature devoid of human weaknesses.\n\nSuper Senses: Spidey gets much-improved senses of hearing and vibration in this version. The latter at least is fairly similar to spiders and he actually makes use of the ability in a very spider-like way when he creates a sewer net and lies in the middle to wait for something to disturb the webbing.\n\nSurprisingly Realistic Outcome: When Uncle Ben is killed, Peter doesn't learn instantly that Great Power Comes Great Responsibility, he just gets pissed and wants revenge. He spends the whole film coming to terms with Uncle Ben's death, but its not until George Stacy points out that vigilantism isn't very responsible that Peter realizes he has to be more than just a guy chasing down criminals.\n\nAs well as that, the NYPD are not useless. The reason they don't like Spider-Man is that when Peter first brushes with them, they nearly take him in for ruining a sting on a car theft ring that they had spent months investigating. In the climax, when the ESU team manages to confront him, he gets taken down by the shooters and is nearly arrested until he manages to Curb-Stomp Battle the ground officers. When he escapes, the shooters manage to land a hit on him and he's left nursing a horrible leg wound for the rest of the climax. And when given the chance, they nearly took down the Lizard without Spider-Man's help until his Healing Factor combined with a second wind allowed him to get the drop on them.\n\nTake My Hand!: An interesting variation occurs when Dr. Connors saves Peter from falling off the Oscorp building. Since the antidote is beginning to affect him, his arm begins to disappear. Realizing this, he grabs Peter with his other hand just before his arm is completely gone. Also, he doesn't have the strength to completely pull up Peter, as is so common with this trope. Instead, once he has a good enough grasp, Peter uses the momentum to pull himself back up to the ledge.\n\nTalking to Themself: Connors develops a Lizard personality, much like Norman Osborn in the first film. Unlike it, however, the conversation is explicitly mental and not spoken out loud. The stinger hints he may have been talking to someone else after all.\n\nTerrifying Pet Store Rat: The inexplicable lizards that lead Peter into the sewers after Connors. They then cause a fake out when they spring Peter's web trap. Though the Lizard is actually sneaking up on him at the same time.\n\nThat Came Out Wrong: When Peter tries to explain about having Gwen as his computer's background. Gwen: Aww man, you don't have me on your computer? Peter: Well yeah. I mean, I took a photo of the debate team, and you're on the debate team. So... he must've seen me; I was touching up stuff. Gwen: *laughs* 'Touching up stuff?' Peter Parker: I'm not gonna answer that!\n\nThese Hands Have Killed: Played for Drama. When Ben is shot by the cash register thief Peter let go earlier, Peter goes over to him and tries to stop the bleeding. We're given a lovely shot of Peter's bloodied hands. Also serves as symbolism: if Peter had apprehended the criminal, Ben wouldn't have been killed, so Peter believes that it's all his fault.\n\nThis Is Your Brain on Evil: Dr. Connors isn't a bad guy at all. Having the Lizard in his system makes him crazy.\n\nThrowing Off the Disability: One of the reasons for Dr. Connors' interest in regenerative serums is that he wants his arm back.\n\nToo Much Information: Invoked by Gwen. When she's trying to get her dad to leave because a wounded Peter has landed at her room , she apologizes for her outburst, saying the \"cramps\" have been interfering with her, immediately causing her dad to leave.\n\nTragic Villain: Dr. Connors all the way.\n\nTranshuman: Dr. Connors' views on human nature are reminiscent of Transhumanism's principal tenets - that the limits of the human body can be overcome through science.\n\nTroll: Andrew Garfield invoked internet trolls who get the feeling of power from their anonymity to describe the dorky, insecure Peter's transformation into the wisecracking masked vigilante Spider-Man. Peter is also all too happy to repeatedly test his webshooters on the car thief in the scene described above.\n\n21-Gun Salute: It is mentioned that rifles were fired at the funeral of Captain George Stacy .\n\nUltimate Universe: May be considered this to the first series of movies, as it largely takes influence from the Ultimate Spider-Man comics.\n\nUngrateful Bastard: Peter accuses the motorcycle cop for being this, after he pulls a gun on him instead of the car thief he apprehended. The cop's attitude is justified, though, as we later learn that the car thief was being tailed by a surveillence unit that were hoping to follow him back to the ringleaders of a larger operation. Spider-Man: I just did 80% of your job and that, that is how you repay me?! The woman in the alley whose abusive boyfriend/pimp had pinned her to the wall, and grabbed her by the face to have a private talk about something she did to displease him. Peter, thinking he could be his Uncle's killer, (and obviously pissed off by his treatment of her), shoves him, and after having a gun pulled on him, roughs him up a bit. The young woman repays him by calling him crazy and sending her attacker's equally violent buddies after him.\n\nThe Unreveal: Although it's alluded to that Connors may have had something to do with Richard Parker's death, we never do find out if this was true or not. However, it's left ambiguous as the same conversation also implies that Oscorp may have had him murdered for refusing to help them. The Stinger then suggests that before his death, Richard Parker was involved in something big, but still doesn't elaborate on what it was.\n\nViewers Are Goldfish: The movie occasionally uses flashbacks to details introduced mere minutes before a given scene.\n\nVigilante Man: A Discussed Trope. When Peter is invited over to the Stacys' place for dinner, they have a fairly intelligent argument over vigilantism with regard to the car thief incident: Peter is quietly supporting Spider-Man for being a guy who wants to help and does not kill, while Captain Stacy counters that in doing so, Spider-Man ruined a sting on a car thief equipped with a computerized lockpick, and said thief was on the streets because the police wanted him to lead them to the ringleaders of a larger theft tring. Left unspoken is that Peter justifiably doesn't have the highest opinion of cops, given their lack of progress with finding Uncle Ben's killer.\n\nVisionary Villain: Dr. Connors is driven by a vision of a \"world without weakness\" where humanity's physical flaws are corrected by science.\n\nVisual Pun: When Peter is working with Dr. Connors using the holographic interface, several lines that look like webbing connect to his fingers.\n\nWell-Intentioned Extremist: Dr. Connors longs to create a world in which everyone is equal, a world in which illness and weakness don't exist. Injected with the Lizard serum, he comes to the conclusion his vision can be made reality by making everyone like him, even if that means forcing the change upon everyone against their will.\n\nWestern Terrorists: Dr. Connor's Evil Plan is referred to as a \"terrorist plot\" in a news flash.\n\nWhat Happened to the Mouse?: We never find out if the guy that shot Uncle Ben was caught. Unlike previous depictions of this, Peter recognized the crook from the police sketch, so catching him for the realization is not as necessary.\n\nDr. Ratha is not seen again after he is saved by Spider-Man when Dr. Connors initially turns into The Lizard and tries to throw his car off the bridge. The tie-in game states that he was killed by the Lizard . It's possible he died when his limo was thrown off the bridge, since though Spider-Man caught it before it hit the water, Ratha wasn't wearing a seatbelt and might have been killed anyway. This was explained in a deleted subplot that can be partially seen in the deleted scenes on the home media release. Ratha is shown to have survived and manages to track Connors down to his hidden lab in the sewers, where he confronts him and is subsequently killed. The deleted subplot also involved peter finding a returned to human Connors after the school attack and helping him escape to his hideout, so he is present when Ratha shows up, and gets incapacitated by a sedative Ratha uses, with the doctor dropping some foreshadowing to Peter\u2019s hidden connection to Richard Parker\u2019s work.\n\nWhen Peter realizes that Connors is the Lizard, he tries to tell Detective Stacy this. Stacy is dismissive of the claim, but later tells an officer to dig up any information they have on Connors. While this seems to set up that they will find out something about Connors' past, nothing comes of this. Possibly justified, as it seems unlikely there'd be anything to find; if he had done anything shady in the past, Oscorp would probably have covered it up. And even if they did find anything, the final battle takes place maybe a day or so after Peter tries to report him, anyway.\n\nLiterally, in the case of the mutated mouse-lizard that was the first live test of the formula. Peter saw it, but there's no indication that he even tried to catch it or tell anyone else about it .\n\nWhen Things Spin, Science Happens: The spider chamber where the bio-cable made from the webs was weaved.\n\nWhere Does He Get All Those Wonderful Toys?: Peter's web shooters are derived from Oscorp's \"bio-cable\", invented by his father and produced by genetically-enhanced spiders (one of which, of course, bites him). Peter engineers a way to shoot them out in a straight line, building his web-shooter devices using re-purposed wristwatches as the base.\n\nWith Great Power Comes Great Insanity: Connors goes apeshit when he's the Lizard, but he also shows signs of instability when he's merely human and improved (somewhat stronger, no more need for glasses). Connors: Eyesight similarly improved; subject no longer requires corrective lenses. ... This is no longer about curing ills, this is about finding perfection.\n\nWith Great Power Comes Great Responsibility: Comes up in a conversation between Uncle Ben and Peter before the former's requisite death, though the trope-naming phrase itself isn't directly said in the film by Uncle Ben (like how the narrator said it in the original Spider-Man story). Also examined throughout the film - it's not just \"great power\" that comes with responsibility, it's any power, and multiple characters besides Spidey behave in accordance with that principle. Even at great personal cost. And the emphasis is on \"if you can do something to help people, you have a responsibility to do so\" rather than \"never use your powers for personal benefit\".\n\nThe World Is Just Awesome: Like every Spider-Man film that came before it, the final sequence of this film is just Spidey swinging, tumbling, and flipping through New York.\n\nYou Fight Like a Cow: Just like in the comic incarnation, Peter lays on the snark heavily when in costume (though this only comes up once he gets his full suit). See Troll for more information. Notable because just like in the comics Spidey knows when there's a time to talk and a time to fight. He's all for trading insults with common thieves and even cops on occasion, but when the Lizard poses a serious threat to the city he clams up."}, {"url": "https://gizmodo.com/the-amazing-spider-man-2012-ten-year-retrospective-1849140322", "page_content": "It isn\u2019t just Transformers that\u2019s celebrating a milestone this holiday weekend. Back in 2012, Sony returned to Marvel Comics\u2019 most popular hero with The Amazing Spider-Man, a reboot completely separate from the original Sam Raimi trilogy, for better and for worse. And ten years later, the two-film franchise (well, two-and-a-half, technically) has managed to find its own place in the increasingly crowded superhero space, just likely not the one it intended.\n\nThe original Amazing certainly had the odds stacked against it: not only was it replacing a Spider-Man 4 that fans of Raimi\u2019s saga had been hoping for, it was coming out at a time when reboots were still finding their footing. For every Star Trek or Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, there were at least three of The Thing or Total Recall reboots. (Or, well, the aforementioned Transformers.) Despite all that, and coming a little over a month after the first Avengers movie took over the entire planet, Amazing 1 managed to get both solid reviews and a $758 million global box office, securing this Spider-Man\u2019s cinematic future, if only for a short time before Sony finally struck up a shared custody deal with Marvel Studios for Tom Holland\u2019s MCU Peter Parker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether you want to view this as an observation or an insult, the Amazing duology is basically the CW-fictation of Spider-Man. (Would it have just been called Spider?) Director Marc Webb, previously best known for the 2009 romcom 500 Days of Summer, plays up the melodrama of Peter Parker\u2019s civilian life whereas Raimi\u2019s trilogy had an even split between Peter and Spider-Man. As played by then-rising star Andrew Garfield, the Amazing Peter is a more moody, openly messy teenager than the quietly tortured soul that Tobey Maguire spent three movies and several pensive gazes enchanting audiences with during the 2000s. With the way he stammers and cracks wise with Emma Stone\u2019s Gwen Stacy, Amazing feels more at home being a romantic story about a superhero rather than a superhero story about a romance, should that make any sense. All that angst and repetition due to failing to let lessons sink in are part and parcel for multiple CW shows; across multiple episodes and seasons, the frustration can be spread out. Not so for a feature film, which is what ultimately doomed 2014's Amazing Spider-Man 2 in particular.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGarfield brings some great physicality to the fights against Rhys Ifans\u2019 Lizard and looks amazing when swinging through New York, but it\u2019s the YA angst underpinning everything where he really excels. For all the guff that gets thrown this at this particular Peter, he succeeds at feeling like he feels he\u2019s constantly alone and just wants to connect with someone. It\u2019s a very teenager-like mindset, and one that he\u2019s still unable to shake off, even when we catch up with the character again in Spider-Man: No Way Home. As he winds up in the reality of MCU Peter and manages to form some kind of connection with both that Peter and his cinematic predecessor\u2014both of whom have gone through equally chaotic events as himself in their lives\u2014he can\u2019t entirely let himself relate to them. It\u2019s to the point that Tobey\u2019s Peter has to actively call him on it and offer Amazing Peter a moment to just let himself be appreciated, which he doesn\u2019t really take.\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home | Tobey Maguire, \u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d, to Andrew Garfield\n\nOf the three Spider-Man eras that have existed in our current lifetime, it\u2019s the Amazing duology that\u2019s clearly had the roughest go of them all. But in our current age of critically re-evaluating people and things we previously wrote off or outright hated, it\u2019s the had the easiest time winning folks over. Perhaps we\u2019ve become more kinder to different takes on the superhero genre, maybe this iteration of Peter Parker just offers more to work with on a character level since prior to No Way Home, Holland\u2019s Peter could feel more like an audience POV fanboy to some. Whether it\u2019s for those reasons, or the simple act of being a contrarian, the two movies have found their audience, and its stars have continued to find success. Since these films wrapped up, there\u2019s been no shortage of appreciation for Garfield, who had a really strong 2021 between No Way Home and Tick, Tick...Boom!. Similarly, Stone has built up a strong resume over the past decade, while also managing to navigate the franchise game via Dreamworks\u2019 The Croods and Disney\u2019s Cruella. With how blockbusters can often treat rising stars so poorly, watching Garfield, Stone, and Dane DeHaan\u2014who very briefly, served the reboot series\u2019 Harry Osborn\u2014continue to thrive in the decade since has been good to see play out, if nothing else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven as the Amazing franchise was just getting off the ground, it was a little unclear how long it would go on, and that hasn\u2019t entirely changed in the decade since. We\u2019re now in an age where any former superhero actor could wind up coming back, something that Sony is actively aware of as they try to figure out how to sketch out their future in the superhero genre beyond Spidey\u2019s animated prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and goofy dark counterpart. But maybe an Amazing Spider-Man 3 should always stay as a \u201cwhat could\u2019ve been\u201d rather than a tangible thing. Amazing 2 ended with its Peter prepared to go out and do the work again, and No Way Home served as a fitting epilogue that left him feeling a little lighter than when we last saw him. For a franchise that was at its best during the quieter moments, it\u2019s fine, and perhaps even fitting, that Amazing doesn\u2019t conclude on a cinematic swing through New York, but with its Peter finally getting the family that he\u2019s always wanted.\n\n\n\nWant more io9 news?

It is the fourth theatrical Spider-Man film produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Entertainment, and a reboot of Sam Raimi's 2002-07 trilogy preceding it. The film was directed by Marc Webb, written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves and stars Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curtis Connors, Denis Leary as Captain George Stacy along with Martin Sheen and Sally Field as the uncle and aunt of Peter Parker, Ben Parker and May Parker. The film tells the story of Peter Parker, a teenager from New York City who becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically altered spider. Parker must stop Dr. Curt Connors as a mutated Lizard from spreading a mutation serum to the city's human population.\n\nDevelopment of the film began with the cancellation of Spider-Man 4 in 2010, ending director Sam Raimi's Spider-Man film series that had starred Tobey Maguire as the titular superhero. Opting to reboot the franchise with the same production team along with James Vanderbilt to stay on with writing the next Spider-Man film while Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves helped with the script as well. During pre-production, the main characters were cast in 2010. New designs were introduced from the comics such as artificial web-shooters. Using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED Epic camera, Principal photography started in December 2010 in Los Angeles before moving to New York City. The film entered Post-production in April 2011. 3ality Technica provided 3D image processing, Sony Imageworks handled CGI and James Horner composed the Film score.\n\nSony Entertainment built a promotional website, releasing many previews and launched a viral marketing campaign, among other moves. Tie-ins included a video game by Beenox. The film premiered on June 30 in Tokyo and was released in the United States on July 3 in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D and released in home media in November 2012. Critical reaction was mostly positive, according to review aggregators Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, and the film was also nominated for several awards. The film was a box office success, grossing over $752 million worldwide, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2012, and the highest-grossing reboot of all time. The film's sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, was released on May 2, 2014, with director Marc Webb and most of the first film's main cast returning to their previous roles. A third film is set for 2016 and a fourth for 2018. In addition, Sinister Six and Venom spin-off films have been announced.\n\nPlot\n\nA young Peter Parker discovers his father Richard Parker's study has been burgled. Gathering up hidden documents, Peter's parents take him to the home of his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Sheen), then mysteriously depart.\n\nYears later, a teenaged Peter (Garfield) attends Midtown Science High School, where he is bullied by Flash Thompson (Zylka) and has caught the eye of the beautiful Gwen Stacy (Stone). At home, Peter finds his father's papers and learns he worked with fellow scientist Dr. Curt Connors (Ifans) at Oscorp. Sneaking into Oscorp, Peter enters a lab where a \"biocable\" is under development from genetically modified spiders, one of which bites him. On the subway ride home, he discovers that he has developed spider-like abilities.\n\nAfter studying Richard's papers, Peter visits the one-armed Connors, reveals he is Richard Parker's son and gives Connors his father's \"decay rate algorithm\", the missing piece in Connors' experiments on regenerating limbs. Connors is being pressed by his superior, Dr. Ratha (Khan), to devise a cure for the dying (but unseen) head of Oscorp, Norman Osborn. In school, Peter gets into trouble after a basketball challenge with Flash in which Peter accidentally shatters the backboard glass. Uncle Ben changes work shifts to meet with the principal and asks Peter to replace him walking home with Aunt May that night. Peter gets distracted and helps Connors regenerate the limb of a laboratory mouse. Peter returns home late, having forgotten to pick up Aunt May, leading to an argument with Ben that prompts Peter to storm out. At a nearby deli, a cashier refuses to let Peter buy a chocolate milk since Peter is two cents short; when a thief suddenly raids the store, Peter indifferently observes. While searching for Peter, Uncle Ben attempts to stop the thief and is killed. The thief escapes as Peter finds Ben on the sidewalk.\n\nAfterward, Peter uses his new abilities to hunt criminals matching the killer's description. After a fall lands him inside an abandoned gym, a luchador-wrestling poster inspires him to create a mask to hide his identity. He adds a spandex suit and builds mechanical devices to attach to his wrists to shoot a biocable \"web\". Peter accepts a dinner invitation from Gwen, where he meets and has a tense conversation with her father, police captain George Stacy (Leary), over Spider-Man's motives. After dinner, Peter reveals his identity to Gwen and they kiss.\n\nAfter seeing success with the mouse using lizard DNA, Ratha demands Connors begin human trials immediately if Osborn is to survive. Connors refuses to rush the drug-testing procedure and put innocent people at risk. Ratha fires Connors and decides to test Connors' serum at a VA hospital under the guise of a flu shot. In an act of desperation, Connors tries the formula on himself. After passing out, he awakens to find his missing arm has regenerated. Discovering that Ratha is on his way to the VA hospital, Connors, whose skin is turning green and scaly, goes to intercept him. By the time he gets to the Williamsburg Bridge Connors has become a violent hybrid of lizard and man, tossing cars, including Ratha's, over the side of the bridge. Peter, now calling himself Spider-Man, snatches each falling car with his web-lines.\n\nSpider-Man suspects Connors is the Lizard and unsuccessfully confronts the creature in the sewers. The Lizard learns Spider-Man's real identity via the name on an abandoned camera and follows Peter to school where they fight. In response, the police start a manhunt for both Spider-Man and the Lizard. The police corner Spider-Man and Captain Stacy discovers that he is really Peter. The Lizard plans to make all humans lizard-like by releasing a chemical cloud from Oscorp's tower, to eliminate the weaknesses he believes plague humanity. Spider-Man confronts and battles the Lizard on the roof of Oscorp Tower and eventually disperses an antidote cloud instead, restoring Connors and earlier victims to normal, but not before the Lizard mortally wounds Captain Stacy. Before his death, Captain Stacy makes Peter vow to keep Gwen safe by \"leaving her out of it.\" Peter initially does so by avoiding to go to Captain Stacy's funeral, but later at school suggests to Gwen he may see her again.\n\nIn a closing-credits scene, Connors, in a prison cell, speaks with a man in the shadows who asks if Peter knows the truth about his father. Connors replies, \"No\", and demands Peter be left alone before the man disappears.\n\nCast and characters\n\nFurther information: List of Spider-Man films cast members and List of Spider-Man supporting characters\n\nAndrew Garfield (top) and Emma Stone (bottom) at 2013 San Diego Comic Con\n\nA teenager struggling to find his place in life ever since his parents disappeared when he was a child. A spider bites him on the back of his neck, giving him spider-powers. He becomes Spider-Man [5][6] Garfield described Parker as someone he can relate to and stated that the character had been an important influence on him since he was little.[7][8][9] Garfield drew from his life experiences as inspiration for the role, revealing, \"I was thinking of my history and thinking of the kid at school who I wasn't as strong as, who behaved badly to a lot of people \u2013 including myself \u2013 and who I constantly tried to stand up to but never had the physical prowess to\".[10] Discussing his predecessor, Garfield said he respects Tobey Maguire as an actor and that when he first saw Maguire play Spider-Man he \"was blown away by his interpretation.\"[10] Garfield said in interviews, including one in which he was interviewed by Maguire, that when he watched the film Spider-Man when he was younger, he would jokingly recite Maguire's lines in the mirror with a friend who joked that he would never be Spider-Man.[10][11] On accepting the role Garfield explained, \"I see it as a massive challenge in many ways... To make it authentic. To make the character live and breathe in a new way. The audience already has a relationship with many different incarnations of the character. I do, as well. I'm probably going to be the guy in the movie theater shouting abuse at myself. But I have to let that go. No turning back. And I wouldn't want to.\"[12] After taking the role, Garfield studied the movements of athletes and spiders and tried to incorporate them, saying Parker is \"a boy/spider in terms of how he moves, and not just in the suit.\"[13][14] He did yoga and Pilates for the role in order to be as flexible as possible.[15] When first wearing his costume Garfield admitted to shedding tears and trying to imagine \"a better actor in the suit\",[16] which he described as \"uncomfortable\" and admitted to wearing nothing beneath it since it is skintight.[17] When filming Garfield explained that he had four months of training and described his physical roles on stunts as terribly challenging and exhausting.[18] Max Charles portrayed Peter Parker as a 4-year-old.\n\nA high school classmate and love interest of Parker's,[19] a smart and charismatic girl who is the chief Intern at Oscorp.[5][6] For the role, Stone went back to her natural blonde hair color, from her previously known color of red.[20][21] She felt that she had a responsibility to educate herself on Spider-Man, admitting she \"hadn't read the comic book growing up, and my experience was with the Sam Raimi movies... I always assumed that Mary Jane was his first love\",[22] and having only been familiar with Bryce Dallas Howard's portrayal in Spider-Man 3.[23][24][25] Stone said, \"There's a part of me that really wants to please people [who] love Spider-Man or Gwen Stacy and want her to be done justice. I hope they'll give me license to interpret her my way.\"[21]\n\nOne of Oscorp's leading scientific minds who attempts to engineer a revolutionary regeneration serum to help regrow limbs and human tissue. Something goes wrong, and he is transformed into the monster known as the Lizard.[5][6] Ifans said his character spends the majority of the film as a human. While playing the 9-foot-tall reptile, Ifans was required to wear a CGI suit. Initially, a large stunt-double was used as a stand-in for the role, but Ifans insisted on portraying the transformed character. Commenting on the technology used to bring his character to life, Ifans continued, \"I had a green suit on, and then this cardboard head, and these small claws... Each and every time you see the Lizard, the technology is so advanced now that when the Lizard's eyes move, they're my eyes. If I frown or show any emotion, they're my emotions. That's how spectacularly advanced technology is.\"[28] Ifans said that he voiced the man-beast as well, explaining, \"I'm sure the voice will be toyed with in the eventual edits, but when I was shooting the CGI moments, when I wasn't actually human, when I was Lizard, I looked like a crash-test dummy in a green leotard thing. There were many moments when I had to speak to Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone as the Lizard.\"[29]\n\n\"This is a Denis Leary you've never seen before \u2014 he's not the cool cat bucking the system, he is the system. He's got wit, he's got an attitude, and he's got 500 officers looking for Spider-Man \u2014 who just happens to be dating his daughter.\" [30] \u2014Matt Tolmach explaining Leary's character.\n\nGwen's father and a New York City Police Department captain who hunts both Spider-Man out of distrust and the Lizard for his rampage.[31] Leary explained that he did not know much about Spider-Man in the comics and was \"more of a Batman guy. Not the '60s [TV version||] but the really dark Batman. But my wife was a Spider-Man nut, which was why I went to Tobey Maguire ones.\"[32] He added that long before he was cast as George Stacy his friend Jeff Garlin, a Spider-Man fan, \"said to me, 'The first time I met you, I thought you were George Stacy!' This was like 30 years ago. I was like, 'What?!'\"[32] Director Webb said of his casting, \"[W]e all trust Denis Leary. He's got this attitude, but you love him. In this movie, he puts pressure on Peter Parker. He's on Spider-Man's case, but you understand him. I've said this before, but good drama comes from competing ideas of what's good.\"[33]\n\nPeter's uncle.[34] Sheen admitted he was unfamiliar with Spider-Man other than Maguire's portrayal, and knew little of the character Ben Parker except for knowing Cliff Robertson had played the part.[35] Sheen described his character as a surrogate father, saying, \"I'm dealing with this adolescent who is having problems with changes, with hormones changing and his getting out of hand. I have to give him the marching orders and so forth.\"[36] Webb said, \"You think of Martin Sheen as President Bartlet [of TV's The West Wing]. He has that sense of benevolent authority, but there's something else that's important, in terms of the dynamic that I wanted to explore, vis-\u00e0-vis Peter's relationship with his absent parents.\" Webb felt that unlike the scientifically inclined Peter, Uncle Ben represented the blue-collar working man, a gap that could create a dynamic between the characters.[33]\n\nSally Field as May Parker:\n\nBen Parker's wife and Peter's aunt.[37][38] Field said the main reason she felt she had to be in the film was because of producer Laura Ziskin (they worked together on the 1985 film Murphy's Romance) because she had an instinct that this was to be Ziskin's last film. After Ziskin's death Field expressed her gratitude of being a part of both Ziskin's first and last films.[39] Director Webb felt that \"when you cast someone like Sally, they come with a certain level of awareness and real genuine affection, which for Aunt May is an incredibly important thing to have.\" Webb said that while \"we all love Aunt May\", he wanted to create a tension between May and Peter. \"He's got bruises on his face, and what happens in that moment? That can create some tension, but you want there to be love there. That's what someone like Sally Field gives you.\"[33]\n\nAn Oscorp executive, Connors' immediate superior.[41] Khan said he was offered what he described as this \"pivotal role\" after appearing in the TV drama series In Treatment.[42][43] Webb described himself as a fan of the actor when watching the series along with the films The Namesake and The Warrior.[41] Khan said he was uninterested in the project at first, but that his sons were excited about it and insisted he take the role.[44]\n\nA high school bully who picks on Parker.[45] Of playing the role, Zylka said, \"You just try to focus. As an artist or as an actor, you just try to focus and stay in that world and block it all out.\"[46]\n\nCampbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz portray Peter's parents, Richard and Mary Parker.[47][48] Leif Gantvoort plays the burglar who robs the convenience store. Hannah Marks portrays Missy Kallenback, an unpopular girl who has a crush on Peter.[49] Kelsey Chow's brief role is simply credited as \"Hot Girl\" during the end credits of the film, but the actress revealed to media outlets around the time of the film's release that her character is in fact Sally Avril.[50] Similarly, C. Thomas Howell's character is credited as \"Jack's Father\" at the end of the film (Jack being a boy that Spider-Man rescues on the Williamsburg Bridge) but he is referred to as Troy by one of his fellow construction workers in the film itself. Unlike the previous films, J. Jonah Jameson does not appear.[51] Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee has a cameo appearance, as he did in the previous films. At the 2011 Dallas Comic Con, Lee detailed that he plays a librarian listening to music on his headphones while stamping books, oblivious to the ongoing battle.[52] Michael Massee plays the mysterious man in the shadows who talks with Connors in his prison cell in a teaser scene during the end credits.[53] As to the man's identity, director Marc Webb said, \"It's intentionally mysterious. And I invite speculation...\"[54] Michael Papajohn, who played Uncle Ben's killer in the 2002 film, has a cameo as Alfred, Dr. Ratha's limo driver.[55]\n\nThemes and analysis\n\n\"I have tried to capture how Peter copes with the feelings of being an underdog, his confusions and his self-doubt. This, I hope, has brought, a certain empathy and sensitivity to his character that explains how it helps him become the hero that he eventually turns out to be.\" [56] \u2014Andrew Garfield\n\nWebb described the film as \"a story about a kid who grows up looking for his father and finds himself.\"[57] Both Webb and star Garfield described Parker as an outsider by choice, someone hard to get close to.[57][58] As in the early comic books, the character \"is a science whiz. If you look back to the early Stan Lee and Steve Ditko comics, he's a nerd with big glasses,\" said Webb. He explained \"the idea of what a nerd is has changed in 40 or 50 years. Nerds are running the world. Andrew Garfield made a movie [called The Social Network] about it. ... What was important in those early comics was this notion that Peter Parker is an outsider and how we define that in a contemporary context.\"[59] Garfield compared his Spider-Man fa\u00e7ade as a metaphor for internet anonymity, saying, \"You feel the power of it, the power of not being seen, the power of the mask. Peter becomes witty when he's got that protective layer. It's like he's on a message board. He's got the anonymity of the Internet within that suit, and he can say whatever the hell he likes, and he can get away with anything.\"[60] Garfield tried to explore Parker as an orphan, whom he feels \"are the strongest human beings on the planet.\"[56] He said Parker is \"a human hero [who] goes through all of the same struggles that we all have gone through, especially the skinny ones [who] want more power than they feel they have.\" He believes Parker represents \"a very inspiring, aspirational character that symbolizes goodness \u2014 and how difficult it is to be good \u2014 but how worth it it is.\"[14] Rhys Ifans compared this film to William Shakespeare's Hamlet on the grounds that Spider-Man can be redone over and over in different ways. He felt that they are similar in that they both represent meaningful archetypal young men grappling with the loss of their father.[61] Critics like Claudia Puig of USA Today felt that Garfield's character as the superhero \"embodies the nerdy Parker, the anguished fatherless teen and the cocky super-hero in equal doses\".[62] Boyd Hoij of Variety noted that Garfield's character as Spider-Man makes an interesting hero in the film because of how it establishes early on that Peter's growing pains along with his search for an identity are common to any teenager and that \"his struggles involve real people \u2014 and real lives.\"[63]\n\nStone described her character as \"a daddy's girl\" who is very responsible and protective of her family and loves science.[22][64] She said her character \"offers Parker a world of stability, of a family unit not marred with parental loss and, beyond physical allure, the two forge an intellectual connection over their shared love of science.\"[22] Her character, she explained, \"is stuck between [her father] the Captain and Peter Parker and Spider-Man, who have different ways about going about finding justice in their lives\" which she felt was a fun thing to explore.[23] Dana Stevens of Slate described her character \"as the stuff of a comic nerd's dreams: a sweet, smart, wisecracking dame in demure sweaters, miniskirts, thigh-high stockings and boots.\"[65] thumb|200px|Rhys Ifans described the character that he is portraying as a villain as similar to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde from the classic book of the same name. Webb felt that the Lizard was the best villain because, \"He's the literal embodiment of the theme of the movie, which is we all have a missing piece. He has no arm. Peter has no parents, and he fills that void with Spider-Man.\"[66] Producer Avi Arad felt likewise, explaining, \"[Y]ou look at Peter, he misses the parents, [and] Connors has one arm. ...[E]motionally, [it] is a very similar problem. It is a cautionary tale.\"[67] Webb said that the Lizard \"is not the worst villain on the planet. He's not a mustache-twirling guy who wants to terrorize people. He believes he's doing the right thing.\"[68][69] Actor Rhys Ifans described his character as a flawed character comparable to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.[70] \"Curt Connors is by no means an evil villain,\" Ifans stated. \"He's not like the Batman villains, like the Joker, who are the embodiment of evil. Curtis Connors is a great man who makes a bad decision. ... [T]hat's the whole magic of the Spider-Man idea. These people are the embodiment of our flaws and our desires that lead to tragedy.\"[71] Ifans described Connors as a force for good throughout his life: \"He's a geneticist who wants to help people, like him, who are limbless. In his eagerness to advance that science, he makes a mistake and that's an occurrence we've seen throughout time, sometimes to our benefit, sometimes to our detriment. ...He is a broken man who wants to fix himself.\"[72] Ifans added, \"I'm not portraying a villain in any sense. Connors does feel cheated by God, and he's looking for answers in science. God seems to intervene.\"[68][69]\n\nWebb said that Oscorp Tower is pivotal as a part of a new mythology of the film. He liked that Parker was connected to the building in some way and to think of it as \"a Tower of Babel in the middle of Manhattan that has something dark and seedy going on in there.\"[73] The critic Roger Ebert described the place as a \"typical comic-book mega-corporation with a madman at the top.\"[74]\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nFurther information: Spider-Man in film#Spider-Man 4\n\nFollowing the release of Spider-Man 3, Sony Pictures Entertainment had announced a May 5, 2011, release date for Sam Raimi's next film in the earlier series. By this time, screenwriters James Vanderbilt, David Lindsay-Abaire and Gary Ross had all written rejected versions of a script and Ziskin's husband Alvin Sargent, who wrote the second and third films, was working on yet another attempt.[75][76] Raimi wanted John Malkovich to play his next villain.[75] However, on January 11, 2010, Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that rather than continue the earlier saga, they were rebooting the series with a new cast and crew. Industry reports claimed that Raimi had admitted that he could not meet the scheduled release date and retain creative integrity.[77] Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach and Ziskin continued as producers.[77]\n\nArad later explained, \"We were working on what we called Spider-Man 4 and it was the same team [as with the first three films]. The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and warranted ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [didn't] have a good reason to make another one. And between [him] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story.\"[78] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man.[79] Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented \"as a favor\" to the filmmakers.[80] \"I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma,\" he explained. \"So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And I did a little plot work, but a lot of the plot was done.\" He did \"a little bit\" of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man.[80] In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb \"invited me on set, and I did a little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes\".[81]\n\n\"When you walk out of the theater, I want the world you see to resemble what you saw on the screen. Part of the joy of cinema [is that] you make the impossible look real. I wanted it to be more grounded and more realistic and that went for the emotion of the scenes, the physical action and wardrobe. It's less based in Steve Ditko world and probably closer visually and more influenced by \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" but it is also very much a world of our own devising.\" Los Angeles Times[59] \u2014Marc Webb in an interview with the\n\nDays after announcing Raimi's departure, the studio announced that Webb, whose previous film (500) Days of Summer was his directorial debut, would direct the reboot.[82][83] Tolmach, now president of Columbia Pictures and Amy Pascal, co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said they looked for a director who could give sharp focus to Parker's life.[82] Webb said he \"was a little sceptical at first \u2014 you feel the presence of those other movies. But then I was like, 'How could I walk away from this? What an opportunity!'\"[84] Webb said in the press release announcing him that, \"Sam Raimi's virtuoso rendering of Spider-Man is a humbling precedent to follow and build upon. The first three films are beloved for good reason. But I think the Spider-Man mythology transcends not only generations but directors as well. I am signing on not to 'take over' from Sam. That would be impossible. Not to mention arrogant. I'm here because there's an opportunity for ideas, stories, and histories that will add a new dimension, canvas, and creative voice to Spider-Man.\"[82] Webb felt Spider-Man is different from the Harry Potter franchise, which is based on a small number of novels and \"more like James Bond\" because \"there's so much material in Spider-Man that there are so many stories to tell and so many characters.\"[85] He described the film as \"not a remake\" explaining that \"we're not making Sam's movie again. It's a different universe and a different story with different characters.\"[86]\n\nCasting\n\nIn May 2010, The Hollywood Reporter said the actors who met with Webb to be considered for the lead role included Jamie Bell, Alden Ehrenreich, Frank Dillane, Garfield and Josh Hutcherson.[87] In June 2010 the Los Angeles Times reported that the shortlist had expanded to include Aaron Johnson and Anton Yelchin.[88] At least Bell, Ehrenreich, Garfield, Yelchin, Logan Lerman and Michael Angarano had screen tests.[89] On July 1, 2010, the choice of Garfield was confirmed.[4] Webb stated that he felt he knew Garfield was the right guy when they were filming a cutscene where he was eating a cheeseburger while telling Gwen to calm down.[90]\n\nSony then held auditions for the role of the young Peter, who needed to resemble Garfield.[91] Webb said, \"I think we saw the origin of Spider-Man before but not the origin of Peter Parker.\" Webb felt that when you try to build the film you must build the protagonist from the ground up. That's why he wanted Parker to begin as a child.[57]\n\nIt was reported originally that the film would feature both Mary Jane Watson and Gwen Stacy as love interests,[92] but the website The Wrap later reported that only Gwen Stacy would appear.[93] In August 2010, the list of candidates included Imogen Poots, Ophelia Lovibond and Lily Collins, with Teresa Palmer, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Emma Roberts cited by The Hollywood Reporter as \"potentially in the mix\".[94] In September 2010, Variety reported that the shortlist had expanded to include Stone and Mia Wasikowska.[95] The shortlist was reported to then include Dianna Agron, Georgina Haig and Dominique McElligott.[96] On October 5, 2010, the choice of Stone was confirmed.[19] Webb noted that the chemistry between Stone and Garfield made her the clear choice.[19] That chemistry inspired their off-screen romance.[9]\n\nOn October 11, 2010, Rhys Ifans was confirmed to be the unnamed villain, and two days later his character was revealed to be Dr. Curt Connors / The Lizard.[26][97] Arad said that Lizard is his favorite Spider-Man villain, and he had long wanted to use him in a film.[24] Well before the choice of villain, Arad had had conceptual drawings prepared for the character.[24]\n\nIn November 2010, Martin Sheen was reported to be Uncle Ben while Sally Field was in negotiations to play Aunt May.[34][37] Also that month, Denis Leary was reported to accept the role of George Stacy.[31] In December 2010, Campbell Scott and Julianne Nicholson were in negotiations to play Peter's parents. Khan was originally reported as playing Van Adder until the character's name was revealed to be Dr. Ratha.[40][47] Embeth Davidtz then replaced Nicholson.[48] Annie Parisse was originally reported to play \"the villain's wife\", and Miles Elliot was reported to portray Billy Connors, son of Dr. Connors; but they did not appear in the final cut of the film.[27][47]\n\nDesign\n\nFurther information: Spider-Man's powers and equipment\n\nWebb felt a responsibility to reinvent Spider-Man.[59] One departure from the preceding trilogy was to have Spider-Man build artificial web-shooters, as the character does in the comics.[98] In February 2011, with the launch of the official website, the title and first official image of Garfield as Spider-Man depicting both his costume and web-shooters for the first time were revealed.[99][100] Writer Geoff Boucher of the Los Angeles Times was skeptical of the change, feeling that it was too hard to believe that a financially strapped young man could conceive a wrist-worn device that can instantly produce a strand of synthetic webbing and noted \"the suit lives up to the challenge of being different from the Sam Raimi films but not too different from the classic suit that stands as one of the great comic-book costumes ever.\"[101] Matt Goldberg of Collider admitted that he was not crazy about the costume, explaining that the bug-yellow eyes felt weird to him and the mesh-pattern felt too busy. He explained that the design of the gloves caused flashbacks to the Spider-Man 2099 costume which he did not like, although he felt that the web-shooters looked fine.[102] Webb explained that he felt that \"the web-shooters were able to dramatize Peter's intellect\". Webb paid attention to the question of \"How would a kid make it?\" and then took some license with it. About the new costume, Webb explained that he and the crew \"wanted a design that would make the body longer and more lithe, more of an acrobat, someone incredibly agile and the legs of the spider [symbol on the chest] were something we used to emphasize that.\" He revealed that the film used varying suits for different lighting conditions. They made the webbing on the costume a little bit darker.[98] Webb stated that \"With the costume and the web-shooters we wanted to emphasize that these are things that Peter Parker made\".[98] Webb also looked at the Mark Bagley art in Ultimate Spider-Man for the hero's body.[103]\n\nWhile Webb introduced a few elements from Ultimate Spider-Man, he wanted to keep the mainstream version of Gwen Stacy instead of that world's punk rocker.[103]\n\nThe release of Lizard merchandise designs along with unconfirmed concept art featuring a humanoid-shape with a layer of scales on top instead of a pronounced snout (similar to a dinosaur or crocodile) as in the most recent comics, produced a mixed reaction. Many commenters compared it to other fictional characters instead of his rendering in comics.[104][105][106] Russ Fischer of /Film described the character as looking more \"Steve Ditko derived\" (the character's original artist).[107] Webb felt that there are different incarnations of Lizard in the comic book. He felt that he should do it without the snout because he was interested more in human emotions and wanted to keep Rhys' presence in the creature. Webb wanted him to have emotion, have a face and have feeling.[33] He stated \"that in a comic book, you just put that thing up there, and you can say, oh, thought bubble, whatever. But when you try to do that and make it look real, it's a different challenge, and I'm creating a movie, I'm not creating a comic book. That was part of the design.\"[103]\n\nWebb \"wanted to do something that felt more contemporary, and was less based in representing panels from the comics\" and focus on spirit over style.[108]\n\nFilming\n\n[[wikipedia:File:Above Williamsburg Bridge crop.jpg|thumb|left|Some of the filming locations in New York City were near East River close to the Williamsburg Bridge as shown above. However, most of the action scenes could not be done there. A 150-foot replica of a piece of the bridge near a tank had to be replaced for some of the action scenes in Los Angeles and some tighter shots and close-ups were done on a soundstage in New York City.[108]||]] Principal photography began on December 6, 2010, in Los Angeles.[109][110] The working title was Fiona's Tale.[111] The 90-day shoot included two weeks in New York City, while the bulk of filming occurred in and around Los Angeles, including such locations as the Henry Fonda Theater in Hollywood, St. John Bosco High School's Gym, Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Mid-Wilshire and various locations around South Pasadena, San Pedro and Woodland Hills.[112] Sony Entertainment spokesman Steve Elzer explained, \"[T]here is a comfort level in producing a project of this size and scope on your own backlot ... Basing the film on the lot also makes it easier for producers to interact with Sony's in-house visual effects team, and gives the studios greater control of quality and security.\"[112]\n\nSome location shooting took place in New York City. The Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House served as the exterior for NYPD headquarters, and an apartment house at 15 West 81st Street, on Manhattan's Upper West Side, was used as the exterior for the home of Gwen Stacy and her family. A row of houses on Fuller Place in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Windsor Terrace stood in for the Forest Hills neighborhood of Ben and May Parker. A web-swinging stunt sequence takes place along the Riverside Drive Viaduct in Harlem.[113]\n\nThe film was the first Hollywood production to be filmed with the Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED Epic camera and was shot in 3-D at 5K resolution.[110] Cinematographer John Schwartzman had this to say about the camera: \"Today was Epic, Monday December 6 marks the first day the Red Epic camera was used to shoot a major studio motion picture. I can say for certainty the camera does exist and boy is it ready for primetime, as a matter of fact it's a true game changer.\"[110] Schwartzman felt that the 3D would have been impossible without it. He said, \"I can tell you without these cameras it would be impossible to move a 3D rig in the ways that THIS story demands, if Jim and the crew hadn't made these cameras available to us I don't think we could have shot this movie the way our director envisioned it in 3D.\"[110] Webb wanted cameras small enough to fit on the rigs and swing around very fast, saying that the \"RED Epic cameras were the right cameras to do that.\" Webb continued that \"you need to shoot it with a level of velocity and 3D cameras can be very large... and so we need those cameras to mount on rigs that could fly to the air and run to the streets in a certain pace. That allowed us to do it.\"[114] The Amazing Spider-Man's climax was filmed in a 1:78:1 aspect ratio for its IMax DMR release.[115]\n\nOn April 2011, Stone revealed that the cinematography had wrapped and that Post-production began in May although some reshooting took place in New York City in November 2011 and in Los Angeles in December 2011.[116][117][118]\n\nStunts\n\nWebb stated that he and the crew wanted to keep the stunts more grounded physically, a challenge for a superhuman character.[59] The stunt performers included the Armstrong family,[59] Vic[119] and Andy, along with Richard Norton who plays a SWAT team member.[120][121] Andy Armstrong was the stunt coordinator while Vic was the second unit director.[114] To determine how Spider-Man should swing, Andy videotaped an Olympic Games gymnast swinging on a horizontal bar.[122] Andy noted that in the computer-generated swing in the earlier Spider-Man films, \"he swings down at the same speed as he swings up,\" and this \"constant\" speed is unlike a real gymnast's movement where \"he's accelerating until he reaches the bottom, then as he starts to come up, he's decelerating until he gets to the top of his swing and he actually gets negative gravity, where he'll go weightless for a second, and then the next swing starts, and it becomes another violent swing again.\"[123] Vic felt that Spider-Man's moves were comparable to those of Tarzan, and he wanted to add that in the film.[124] While filming in New York City, they swung a man through traffic down the street. Then, while the crew built a rig hundreds of feet long over Riverside Drive in Harlem, Andy built a car rig with a series of wires to help with effects which Webb said required an \"incredible wealth of acrobatics\".[121] These rigs were over 200\u2013300 feet long and demanded months of rehearsals and design.[114] According to Andy, operating the rigs \"was a combination of a lot of human skills and mechanical engineering.\"[123] The purpose of the rigs was to depict Spider-Man's swing in a way that wasn't computer-generated.[59] Garfield was reported to be involved with some of the stunts.[125] Leaked pictures reveal Garfield with a nosebleed that reports claimed was from swinging.[126] Arad explained that \"Andrew is not only a brilliant actor but he is a sportsman. This gave us the opportunity to try things with him that were it not so it would have been almost impossible.\"[67]\n\nEffects\n\nThe company 3ality Technica of Burbank produced some of the equipment.[127][128] The film was reported to be the first to adopt 3ality Digital's TS-5 wireless and handheld beamsplitter mirror rig.[129] 3ality technology helped make it possible to avoid 2D to 3D conversion.[127] Webb wanted a new 3D experience for Spider-Man: \"Because we're shooting in 3D, I wanted to conceive of certain things very specifically for 3D. There's an experimental component to 3D that's fascinating and we're experimenting with generating that point of view \u2013 so you feel what Peter Parker feels, you feel what Spider-Man feels when he's jumping over buildings and over the streets.\"[121] He felt that Spider-Man was ideal for 3D, admitting that they \"started making the movie around the time Avatar came out\" which made every studio want 3D. This was Webb's first film using the technique, and he did not want a force-fit or clumsy conversion as he had seen in other films.[85][130][130] Webb cited childhood films such as Creature from the Black Lagoon and House of Wax for inspirations to push the 3D in his film even further than the type of depth that James Cameron uses in his film.[33]\n\nThe Vancouver branch of Sony Pictures Imageworks was responsible for the digital touch-up.[131] The group improved the sewer and high school battle scene with many of Spider-Man's poses and environments that were used in the film. The comic book was cited as a basic source for Spider-Man's poses.[132] The visual designers helped bring the Lizard to life by first building a digital version of a production design maquette.[132] Many staff were involved with the process. They also started by thinking about lizard biology and how his muscles would work.[133] A large man referred to as \"Big John\" stood in as the character during shooting, performing much of the interaction with other characters.[33] The computer-generated Lizard replaced him in post-production.[33] The creators would then fuse the design of the Lizard with the actor Rhys Ifans.[132] Ifans then used Motion capture for the Lizard's speaking parts, which Webb found challenging to incorporate into the character's final version.[33][103]\n\nMusic\n\nFurther information: The Amazing Spider-Man (soundtrack)\n\nTemplate:Listen James Horner scored the film.[134] Webb described Horner's first musical cue as \"spectacular\". Webb said, \"I wanted to create a score that felt massive and huge but also intimate and small.\"[135] The film also features the Coldplay song \"'til Kingdom Come\" from the album X&Y.[136] In May 2012, Sony Classical revealed details about the soundtrack.[137]\n\nMarketing\n\nMerchandising\n\n[[wikipedia:File:Spider-Manswinging2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Spider-Man's stunt double shoots a Hardee's/Carl's Jr. commercial promoting the film.||]] Spider-Man and Lizard PEZ dispensers were revealed at the November 2011 Comic-Con first depicted the film's Lizard.[138] In December 2011, it was revealed that Mega Brands had the rights to produce construction sets.[139][140] A Marvel Select Spider-Man action figure by Diamond Select Toys was announced on January 2012 \u2014 the fifth Marvel Select Spider-Man figure, but the first based on a film.[141] The first look at a Hasbro action figure of the film's version of Spider-Man was revealed at the July 2011 Comic-Con.[142] Hasbro made a radio control speed-climbing figure.[143] Minimates made action figures from the film.[144] Other companies releasing action figures for the film include Hot Toys, MediCom and Kaiyodo.[145] OPI Products released a collection of The Amazing Spider-Man nail polish.[146] Trading cards were also available.[147]\n\nCKE Restaurants, parent company of Carl's Jr. and Hardee's, helped sponsor the film. Chief marketing officer Brad Haley said they would market a new burger as part of the promotion.[148] The burger was dubbed \"The Amazing Grilled Cheese Bacon Burger\". It was promoted through film-themed commercials and radio ads featuring Stan Lee. Spider-Man-themed premiums were offered as part of the Cool Kid's Combo. Tours and PlayStation 3 game prizes were part of the promotion along with a video game.[149] Stan Lee then helped spread the word that fans would also have been treated for a free Amazing Grilled Cheese Bacon Burger in Independence Day if dressed as Spider-Man.[150]\n\nBig Cola was reported to enter a deal for promoting the film.[151][152] The Kellogg Company and the Keebler Company built marketing campaigns around clips from the film.[153] Sony launched a new augmented reality mobile application for the film using Qualcomm's Vuforia platform. Sony's Dwight Caines felt that the \"use of augmented reality technology is a fun way of embracing the 3D aspects of the movie while nurturing the playful kid inside all of us who wants to collect items from their favorite superhero character to share with their friends and family.\"[154] Twizzlers challenged fans nationwide to help the hero build a virtual web of Twizzlers Twists to unlock prizes and exclusive content.[155] D-Box Technologies provide motion simulation for the film in select theaters.[156]\n\nAs is common in Sony films, Sony product placements abounded, replacing the ubiquitous Apple Computer products often used by other studios. The film's mobile phones, tablets, monitors and laptops all came from other Sony divisions. Other placements included Microsoft's Bing search engine.[157]\n\nPreviews\n\n[[wikipedia:File:TASM No Sound.ogv||thumb|300px|The point of view shot in the teaser trailer that was compared to the 2008 first person video game, Mirror's Edge by writers. This was the first preview audiences had of Spider-Man fully in the new costume in video. Only a few of these scenes appeared in the final cut of the film.||]] A teaser trailer was leaked on the Internet and aired at San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2011, attached to the superhero film Captain America: The First Avenger.[158] Rob Keyes of Screen Rant felt that \"it takes on a noticeably different tone from that of Raimi trilogy of Spider-Man movies, and presents itself in a similar fashion to what Christopher Nolan did with Batman Begins.\"[159] Some writers observed that the trailer very closely resembles the 2008 video game Mirror's Edge.[160][161][162] After the third trailer was released, Webb defended the point of view footage, saying it was an early rendering and that the CGI was still in production.[33]\n\nA \"sneak peek screening\" of The Amazing Spider-Man was held on February 6, 2012 in 13 cities internationally: Berlin, London, Los Angeles, Madrid, Mexico City, Moscow, New York City, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Seoul, Sydney and Tokyo.[163] On January 8, 2012, the Spider-Man logo appeared on some of the world's most iconic buildings, such as the Sydney Opera House, the Colosseum of Rome, the Kremlin in Moscow and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.[164][165] The screening revealed a second trailer in 3D, which thereafter appeared online. Glen Levy of Time magazine felt that the trailer's \"dialogue goes hand in hand with the action, rather than be dominated by it\" and that the action scenes from the film looked \"polished and slick\".[166] The special screening included an eight and a half minute extended trailer.[167] Scott Mantz of Access Hollywood felt that the extended footage seemed is edgier and more character-driven and that \"the Lizard looks like a great villain\".[168] Peter Sciretta of /Film said that the trailers had left him \"impressed\" and had captured a feeling of dark naturalism alongside Spider-Man's trademark wisecracking.[169] With the second official trailer and the sizzle reel, Webb felt that it was important to provide a more specific idea of the film, such as showcasing Peter and Gwen's relationship and the visual effects, just to display the attitude of the film that he and the crew were trying to create.[170] On February 7, 2012 it was reported that the latest official trailer revealed a link to the viral marketing internet site for the film.[171]\n\nA third official trailer debuted on ITunes on May 3, 2012. The trailer was attached to the 3D premi\u00e8re of The Avengers, the day after.[172][173] The trailer contains what most reporters called a better and more fleshed Lizard.[172][174][175][176] Adam Chitwood of Collider said, \"The webslinging has an edge to it and The Lizard has much more texture. I like Andrew Garfield a whole lot, and the biggest draw for me here is the character work between Garfield and Emma Stone. They look to have some great chemistry and Garfield brings out a... side of Peter Parker that we didn't really see in Sam Raimi's trilogy.\"[177] Sandy Schaefer of ScreenRant felt that \"the darker color palette and 3D visuals shown here look overall quite crisp, even without the benefit of the big screen.\"[173] Webb felt that \"there's a small, intimate little indie movie at the heart of Spider-Man\".[33]\n\nIn May 9, 2012 the first television trailer was revealed which teased an \"4 minute Super Preview\" on NBC with the season premiere of America's Got Talent on May 14.[178] The super preview revealed Spider-Man saving a boy near a bridge.[179][180] Fans and writers rated that scene the highest in the trailer.[181][182] Angela Watercutter of Wired called the rescue scene \"pretty freaking epic.\"[182] Kofi Outlaw of Screen Rant felt that the biggest thing to note \"is the tone and composition of the film\" and that most of the footage \"manages to showcase a version of Peter Parker/Spider-Man that is both familiar and fresh.\"[183]\n\nA six-minute 3D preview was tied in with IMAX 3D showings of Men in Black 3.[184] Sony's Rory Bruer explained that the audience of Men in Black 3 should be a perfect match for this footage and that the six minutes should get everyone excited.[185] The footage revealed an exchange between Peter and Gwen that Brad Williams from WhatCulture.com described as \"brief and cutesy\". Brad found the CGI fairly clean and felt that the film seemed like a perfect match for 3D.[186]\n\nViral campaign\n\n[[wikipedia:File:MarkoftheSpider-Man.jpg|thumb|Graffiti of the Spider-Man logo in Seattle, painted by operatives for the viral campaign for The Amazing Spider-Man.||]] The main viral marketing site was revealed in the second trailer in February 2012.[171] The official Twitter account revealed a scavenger hunt by posting \"Property of Peter Parker... Lost\" with the longitude and latitude coordinates of direct markets in major US cities. The missing items included a JanSport backpack. One of the clues hidden in the backpack was a link to a page on the viral site that unlocked countdown timers for the cities of Los Angeles, New York City, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle and Phoenix, Arizona.[187][188] Once the countdown was up, each of the city-specific Twitter accounts for the marketing campaign sent out five locations in each city. A person at each spot waited to give the first person with the password a package and the tag-name \"operative\".[189] These operatives painted the Spider-Man logo as graffiti.[190] The operatives then could view a scene related to the film.[191] The main viral website revealed hints to other websites, such as a photo blog that expressed Peter Parker's point of view.[192][193] An unlocked puzzle there revealed the words \"evolve\", \"through\" and \"engineering\" which when put together led to another website with design sketches on how to build a web-shooter.[193][194][195]\n\nA Daily Bugle website revealed Denis Leary as George Stacy, lamenting the appearance of the wall-crawler and asking whoever spots Spider-Man to e-mail the police. The site hosted the best fan-made Spider-Man scenes.[196][197] People who uploaded images of \"Spider-Man\" on the \"Webbed Menace\" viral site received a poster that sent them to a website for a boxing gym called \"Jerera's Boxing Gym\".[198] The gym was funded by Peter Parker's school. A viral website of that class was discovered. Entering the correct password revealed Parker's class schedule. The Midtown High School site then revealed a Twitter user tracking down Lizard and asked people in Los Angeles, New York City, Atlanta, Chicago, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Austin, Tampa, Minneapolis and New Orleans to stay tuned for details.[199][200] A viral site for Oscorp Industries was available.[201] The Twitter account that coordinated a nationwide effort to track Lizard sightings revealed locations that had packages containing Connors' shredded lab coat, an Oscorp ID badge and scientific samples of reptilian skin. When unscrambling the letters listed on each sample, the words \"animal dynamics lab\" led players to a new Oscorp Industries site focusing on a science program about reptile genetics. The site depicts Doctor Connors search for interns who could begin applying on May 14.[202] Completing the application and supplying the keyword \"Mutagen\" unveiled a Lizard featurette.[203][204] The Oscorp Industries website contained puzzles that revealed two in-game documents, two video updates featuring Connors and a following cipher that as of July 2012 had yet to be cracked. From there images were then unscrambled, revealing a research project with spiders, a letter from Mary Parker to Richard Parker that exposed his workaholic habits and a Daily Bugle newspaper that contained notes about Oscorp.[205]\n\nOn May 30, 2012, the third (and apparently final) set of challenges in the Animal Dynamics Lab was launched with two new video updates of Doctor Connors, an image of Richard and Mary Parker, letters from Rajit Ratha to Doctor Connors, one from Doctor Connors to Richard Parker and another note to Richard from Mary.[206] In June 1, 2012, a Carl's Jr. in Glendale, California hosted the next viral campaign by decorating webs and declaring a crime scene due to Spider-Man's apprehension of a serial car and motorcycle thief. It was announced via The Mark of the Spider-Man Twitter feed, and with the code word \"Web of Crime\", a hidden message was discovered, entitled a \"Spider cipher\". The code name \"adhere\" named another sub-site of the Mark of the Spider-Man campaign that revealed crime reports.[207]\n\nOliver Lyttleton of indieWire felt that viral ads such as the webbed menace website seemed a little forced and cribbed heavily from the example set by The Dark Knight with viral games.[208] Silas Lesnick of SuperheroHype!, on the other hand, described the film's viral as \"one of the most comprehensive film virals to date\".[199]\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nT-shirts depicting the film's Spider-Man to help the cause for Stand Up to Cancer were available. Garfield wore the shirt, explaining that \"these shirts underscore the idea that anyone has the power to be a hero. Cancer is one of our greatest villains. I'm proud to join others in standing up to this disease.\"[209] Ziskin's death from cancer was used as inspiration for the cause.[210] Sony created a website for the cause.[211] Columbia Pictures teamed up with New York City cultural institutions to create \"Spider-Man week\" by helping out in the community.[212]\n\nRelease\n\nOn February 10, 2010, Sony announced that the film would be released in 3D and IMAX 3D on July 3, 2012. Release dates outside the US were moved up to June in other countries to increase first-week sales.[214][215][216] Premieres took place in Tokyo, Japan on June 13.[217] The film is rated PG-13 for sequences of action and violence.[218]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[[wikipedia:File:Roger Ebert cropped.jpg|thumb|right|The Amazing Spider-Man was the last Marvel Comics based film that Ebert ever reviewed before he died. He regarded it as \"probably the second best\" within the Spider-Man film franchise.[219]||]] The Amazing Spider-Man received mostly positive reviews by critics upon release with critics praising the performance of Andrew Garfield. The review aggregator film site Rotten Tomatoes reported a 73% approval rating, based on 126 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The consensus: \"A well-chosen cast and sure-handed direction allows The Amazing Spider-Man to thrill despite revisiting many of the same plot points from 2002's Spider-Man.\"[220] On Metacritic, as of July 5, the film had received an average score of 66 out of 100, based on 42 critics, signifying \"Generally favorable reviews\".[221] According to Rotten Tomatoes yearly lists, (by using a weighted formula of the critics review in the site) it was placed number 32 on its list of best comic-book movies in 2012 and was placed number 36 in 2013.[222][223] CinemaScore's audience graded it an A-.[224]\n\nJordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the film was satisfying, explaining that Webb directed with emotional and comedic touches and provided a darker depiction and a stronger romance than the original.[1] Boyd Van Hoeija of Variety described the film as a \"mostly slick, entertaining and emotionally involving recombination of fresh and familiar elements\".[63] A columnist of The Village Voice, Chris Pakham felt that the film was faithful to the comics and that \"Garfield's spindly physicality evokes the Marvel illustrations of the 1960s.\"[225] Conversely, Lou Lemenick of the New York Post wrote that the film was dull and uninspiring and felt that it did not compare to Batman Begins and was \"a pointless rehash in the mode of Superman Returns.\"[226] New Yorker critic Anthony Lane described the film as \"running out of nimbleness and fun, and the promise contained in its title seems ever more tendentious.\"[227] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called the film \"memorable in pieces but not as a whole\" and said that its best element is the relationship between Peter and Gwen, while the Lizard \"is not quite an opponent for the ages.\"[228]\n\nLisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A- describing the film as \"a friskier, sweeter-natured variation\" when compared to Raimi's work. She explained that the most \"amazing\" element was not the \"blockbuster wow!\" but instead the \"intimate awww.\"[229] Claudia Puig of USA Today explained that \"as a new chapter in the superpowered arachnid saga, it stands on its own quite nicely, focusing more on human emotions than on a panoply of special effects.\" She said \"where Tobey Maguire in the original Spider-Man trilogy was earnest, Garfield's Spider-Man is whip-smart and likably cheeky, with an undercurrent of teenage angst.\" She also called the film \"as much a coming-of-age story as a crime-fighting action saga.\"[62] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press described Garfield's Spider-Man as an arrogant and misunderstood outsider, giving the film a \"restless, reckless energy and a welcome sense of danger.\" She also concluded that Webb was a different sort of director, saying that while Webb's big set pieces lacked Raimi's imagination, they conveyed \"emotional truth\" and \"a pervasive sense of humanity\".[230] However, Ty Burr of The Boston Globe felt that the film lacked the original's pop grace and the pulpy joy, saying the film was \"dumbed down, tarted up\" and \"almost shockingly uninspired\". Burr evaluated it as \"the worst superhero film since Green Lantern\".[231] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune also felt that The Amazing Spider-Man is weaker than its predecessor and described it as \"The Notebook in spandex\".[232] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt that the reboot provided better reasons for why Peter Parker adopts his superhero role, even if the origin story didn't need to be told once again. He also remarked that it was \"probably the second best\" of the four Spider-Man films after Spider-Man 2, explaining that Lizard was lackluster compared to that film's villain, Doctor Octopus, and had the dramatic range of Godzilla.[74]\n\nJoe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal, pointed out that \"the truly amazing thing is that most of what happens to Peter Parker in the first half of the film has already happened in previous chapters of the Spidey saga\", that \"what's old is old again.\"[233] However, Randy Myers from the San Jose Mercury News found it \"the best Spidey yet\", describing it as \"strong, bold and well-acted.\" He felt that a viewer couldn't help but feel d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, but that the work shows greater \"dimension\".[234] Dana Stevens at Slate magazine believed that the film was an \"absolutely unnecessary\" retelling of the origin story, although it avoided \"the common comic-book adaptation trap of gloomy self-seriousness\".[65] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also opined that the \"unnecessary\" reboot pulled stellar performances from Garfield and Stone and touches the heart.[235]\n\nAndrew Garfield received good notices for his performance. Bob Mondello of NPR said, \"Here comes another Spider-dude: This Andrew Garfield guy. So he'd better be really something, right? Well, as it happens, he is.\"[236] Tom Charity of CNN found Garfield's \"combination of fresh-faced innocence, nervous agitation and wry humor ... immediately appealing.\"[237] Stephanie Zacharek of Movieline said she \"had no specific desire to see the series resuscitated. But watching Garfield and Stone made me think doing so wasn't such a bad idea\".[238] Mary F. Pols of Time said that even though the story was familiar Garfield and Webb made it feel \"convincingly fresh and exciting.\"[239]\n\nBox office\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man earned $262,030,663 in North America and $490,185,894 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $752,216,557.[3] As of December 2013, the film is the 51st highest grossing film,[240] the seventh-highest-grossing 2012 film,[241] the ninth highest-grossing superhero film,[242] the lowest-grossing Spider-Man film, the sixth-highest-grossing film distributed by Sony/Columbia[243][244] and the highest-grossing reboot of all time worldwide.[3]\n\nIn North America, the film earned an estimated $7.5 million during its midnight run at 3,150 locations, including $1.2 million from 300 IMAX venues.[245] On its opening day, a pre-holiday Tuesday, it set a Tuesday-gross record with $35 million (previously held by Transformers).[246] The next day, the film dropped 33.4 percent to $23.3 million\u2014the second-highest non-opening Wednesday.[247] Over the three-day weekend, it grossed $62.0 million. This pushed the film's six-day gross to $137.0 million, which was smaller than those of Transformers ($155.41 million) and Spider-Man 2 ($180.07 million) among past Fourth of July releases.[248] Although the film did not match its predecessors, Sony Pictures stated, \"In the world of relaunched franchises, this is a spectacular success by any measure\".[249] For example, both Batman Begins ($79.5 million) and X-Men: First Class ($69.9 million) (both were non 3D-movies) opened significantly below The Amazing Spider-Man.[250] It remained at the number 1 spot for ten consecutive days, until the opening day of Ice Age: Continental Drift.[251] The film was originally the highest-grossing reboot of all time domestically until beaten by Man of Steel in 2013.[252][253]\n\nOutside North America, The Amazing Spider-Man grossed $51.1 million on its five-day opening weekend (June 27 \u2013 July 1, 2012) from 13 markets, with strong openings in many Asian countries.[254] In India, it earned $6.0 million, a record opening for a Hollywood film.[255] Kercy Daruwala of Sony Pictures in India felt very confident that the presence of famed Indian actor Irrfan Khan would enhance attendance.[214][256][257] Opening in an additional 61 markets, the film made $127.5 million over its second weekend. The movie ranked number one in over 30 countries. In Indonesia, it broke the opening-weekend record with $4.5 million while, in the UK, it opened to \u00a311.1 million ($18.1 million) which is about equal with Spider-Man 3 (\u00a311.8 million).[258][259] In its last market, China, The Amazing Spider-Man grossed $33.3 million over its seven-day debut, which is more than Spider-Man 3\u2019s lifetime box office in China.[260] As of August 27, 2012, the movie's highest-grossing territory is the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta, where it has grossed $40.4 million.[261]\n\nAccolades\n\nHome media\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, and digital download on November 9, 2012 in North America.[268] These releases contain a ninety-minute behind-the-scenes documentary for the film along with UltraViolet download. Other special features include \"Rite of Passage: The Amazing Spider-Man reborn\" and \"The Oscorp Archives - Production Art Gallery\". The discs also contain audio commentary from Marc Webb, Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach.[269][270] The deleted scenes included relationship-building between Peter and Connors which Joey Esposito of IGN thought gives the Lizard a sense of sympathy that is lacking in the final film.[271] The Blu-ray/DVD combo pack contains three disks and also contains a second screen app for the IPad.[272] Sony also included a limited edition gift set on November 9, 2012 containing four disks with all of the special editions along with figurines of Spider-Man and the Lizard from the film.[270]\n\nWhile released, the film was reported as dominating the sales chart on its first release until the end of November 11, 2012 while its rental chart had The Amazing Spider-Man at number two behind Prometheus.[273] It then became number one in rental and dropped to number two in sales chart after its second week.[274] FX has acquired the TV commercial rights to the film to air in late 2014.[275]\n\nOther media\n\nA video game of the same name developed by Beenox was announced at the 2011 New York Comic Con. They were the development team behind the previous two Spider-Man games, Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions and Spider-Man: Edge of Time. The game was released on June 26, 2012, in Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, personal computer, Wii, Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS.[276][277][278][279] Dee Brown of Beenox noted, \"The fact that our game is based on the movie, and the movie is re-approaching the universe in a completely different way \u2014 a more grounded, more realistic approach \u2014 gives us an incredible setting to play with\".[280] The game takes place after the events of the film.[276] Sony and Gameloft teamed up again to create an official mobile game for the film.[281] Sky Betting and Gaming's online casino website Sky Vegas created a related casino game.[282]\n\nThe comic was released in June, named \"Amazing Spider-Man: The Movie\" #1\u20132\", written by Tom Cohen and illustrated by Neil Edwards.[283] A trade paperback was published collecting the two-parter a week before the film's release, entitled Amazing Spider-Man: The Movie Prelude, which also included The Amazing Spider-Man issues #75\u201377.[284]\n\nThe soundtrack album of the film was released the same day as the film, under the Sony Classical banner.[285]\n\nLegacy\n\nThe comic-book website Newsarama placed The Amazing Spider-Man on its top 10 list of comic-book movies.[286] Mark Hughes of Forbes ranked the film as the seventh greatest comic book superhero film being the highest Spider-Man film in the list while Jacob Hall of ScreenCrush ranked the film as 13th greatest modern Marvel movie being the lowest Spider-Man film in the list.[287][288]\n\nA scientist from Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center referenced the film to news organizations in explaining how scientists from the medical center are working on a long-term project involving spider silks and potential human regeneration along with deciphering fact and fiction from the film.[289][290]\n\nSequels and possible spin-offs\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man was originally reported as being the first of at least three planned films.[291] The movie's first sequel was released on May 2, 2014.[292] On June 17, 2013 Sony announced two more sequels to follow The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which will be released on June 10, 2016 and May 4, 2018 respectively.[293]\n\nIn November 2013, Sony Pictures Entertainment chief Michael Lynton told analysts, \"We do very much have the ambition about creating a bigger universe around Spider-Man. There are a number of scripts in the works\".[294] There was talks about Venom as the titular character since 2008 before the series was rebooted.[295] Although the producer Matt Tolmach, speaking of his and fellow producer Avi Arad's next project, a Venom movie, suggested it could follow the shared-universe model of the film The Avengers with The Amazing Spider-Man: \"What I'm trying to say to you without giving anything away is hopefully all these worlds will live together in peace someday.\"[296] In December 2013, Sony officially announced plans for Sinister Six and Venom.[297]\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nPaur, Joey.

It was developed by Beenox and published by Activision. It was released on June 26 in North America and on June 29, 2012 in Europe[1] for the Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Android, iOS, and Microsoft Windows.[2][9] A version for the Wii U was released in March 2013 in North America and Europe known as The Amazing Spider-Man: Ultimate Edition in both regions.[10][4] A PlayStation Vita version was released in November 2013. A sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, was released in April 2014, itself based on the film.\n\nThe game was directed by Gerard Lehiany and written by Seamus Kevin Fahey,[5] Benjamin Schirtz and G\u00e9rard Lehiany. Its story serves as an alternate epilogue to The Amazing Spider-Man film, which is continued in the game's sequel.[11] Months after the events of the film, a number of cross-species experiments created by Oscorp using Curt Connors' research escape into Manhattan and infect its population with a deadly virus, forcing Spider-Man to join forces with Gwen Stacy and Connors to find a cure. Meanwhile, the new Oscorp CEO, Alistair Smythe, attempts to develop his own cure so that he will be credited as the city's savior, and to eliminate Spider-Man and Connors for interfering with his plans.\n\nThe Nintendo 3DS and Wii versions of the game include the script and plot of the other versions of the game, but feature a much different, more linear gameplay that does not have an open world environment, and instead features the player selecting a level from the map in Spider-Man's apartment, before playing a mostly linear level. It was natively designed for the 3DS and later ported to the Wii. Upon its release, the game received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with praise to the gameplay, controls, combat, dark tone, intensity and soundtrack, although it received criticism for its mode of difficulty, story, visuals, repetitive side missions and lack of innovation.\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 5 Views: 28 721 112 067 2 668 586 634 516 3 199 688\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man (2012) - Longplay\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man (2012) DS vs Android vs 3DS vs Wii vs PS Vita vs PS3 vs XBOX 360 vs PC\n\nTHE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN Gameplay Walkthrough Part 1 FULL GAME [1080p HD 60FPS PC] - No Commentary\n\nThe Amazing Spider Man (2012) 3DS vs PS Vita vs PS3 vs Wii vs Xbox 360 vs Android vs PC vs DS\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man (Video Game) Walkthrough - Chapter 12: Where Crawls the Lizard Transcription\n\nGameplay\n\nPlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows versions\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man is a third-person video game, set in an open world based on Manhattan. Players take on the role of Spider-Man and complete missions\u2014linear scenarios with set objectives\u2014to progress through the story. The missions are structured in a linear manner, but the player is free to explore the game's map in between missions and engage in various side activities. Players have access to all of Spider-Man's superhuman abilities, including web swinging and wall crawling. The game introduces a bullet time mechanic called Web-Rush, where players slow down time by holding a button and can select between different locations that Spider-Man will automatically move towards once the player releases the button. This gameplay mechanic can be used to target enemies, whom Spider-Man will attack automatically, or objects that Spider-Man will throw at enemies, incapacitating them for a few seconds and allowing Spider-Man to web them in order to subdue them for good. The combat system is reminiscent of the Rocksteady Studios' Batman: Arkham series (at the time consisting of Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City), using a freeflow design and counterattacks.[12] Beenox took a cue from the Batman games, with Dee Brown, the head of Beenox, stating \"I played both Batman games and liked them. For me, the Spider-Man character is very different than Batman. You have to approach both in a different way. I think the Rocksteady guys did a good job at providing what was required to make a great Batman game, and we're doing everything we need to this time to make a great Spider-Man game\".[13]\n\nThe game's side missions include stopping petty crimes, car chases, and gun fights in the streets, recovering missing patients from a psychiatric hospital that escaped early on in the main storyline, and transporting civilians infected by the cross-species virus to quarantine camps. Spider-Man can use his phone to take photographs of evidence that links Oscorp to the cross-species conspiracy, or collect items such as audio files related to the conspiracy. Finding this evidence rewards the player with XP Points, or extra content in the main menu, such as concept art. Players can collect full, vintage comic books, such as Amazing Fantasy #15, as they collect comic covers throughout the game's map.[14][15]\n\nThe game uses a unique damage system: the more damage Spider-Man takes, the more his suit is damaged; returning to the \"safe house\" repairs the suit. The player can remove a utility belt from the default suit, which holds some extra web fluid. There are ten alternate suits in total, and five of them can be unlocked after completing certain tasks, or taking pictures of secret spider graffiti hidden within the city, such as the Scarlet Spider suit, the Black Suit from the 2007 film Spider-Man 3, a color-inverted version of the Future Foundation suit, the Negative Zone suit, and the Big Time suit. Two more secret suits include the Cross-Species suit (unlocked after completing the main storyline), and a Black Suit version of the 2012 film suit (unlocked after attaining 100% completion), both of which are exclusive to the game. A party hat for \"Spidey's 50th anniversary\" becomes available if the player changes the date of their console or PC to August 10, 2012.\n\nThe game's downloadable content adds new mini-games and suits. For example, the Rhino Challenge downloadable content (DLC) pack adds the classic Spider-Man suit from the Sam Raimi film series and a mini-game where the player controls Rhino as he rampages through the streets of Manhattan, and the Lizard Rampage DLC pack adds the Vigilante suit from the film and a mini-game where the player controls the Lizard as he fights Oscorp mercenaries and destroys beacons across the city.\n\nNintendo 3DS and Wii versions\n\nOn the Nintendo 3DS and the Wii versions of The Amazing Spider-Man are different than the console and PC versions. Although they feature different gameplay, they still share the same plot, voice-overs, and some of the other version's level design. Instead of featuring an open world environment, this version features the player selecting a level from a map screen and talking to Dr. Connors. Once a level is selected, Spider-Man is dropped off at the start of the level. The game includes sub-missions that help the player gain XP.\n\nDue to the lack of free roam within these versions of the game, players cannot find comic book pages or take pictures of hidden spider graffiti to unlock more suits. The photo mode makes use of the 3DS gyroscope, but can also be more easily controlled by the analog slider.\n\nSpider-Man's moves in this game are similar to the previous moveset from earlier Spider-Man film games, and not that of its more current counterparts, although several changes have been made, such as the addition of a \"Web Rush\" mode (controlled with the Wii Remote's pointer in the Wii version), which allows Spider-Man to slow time down while he is looking for targets to aim at.\n\nThe 3DS version has an exclusive game mode named \"Vigilante\", which is a strategy-based role-playing text game where they are given a map of locations and must complete tasks and missions and collect items needed for certain missions. A meter is shown with a slide moving to either a red or green marker. When Spider-Man successfully completes the mission, the player is awarded with Vigilante Points (VP) and Action Points (AP). The higher skill rank is, more locations and additional content are unlocked. Vigilante is compatible with Street Pass, allowing the player to trade items with other players.\n\nUnlike the other versions of the game, there are only three suits to unlock: which is the Basic, suit the Classic, suit and the Black Suit. The Basic suit is the default one; the Classic Suit is unlocked by completing all of the side missions; and the Black Suit is unlocked by completing the Vigilante Mode.\n\nAndroid and iOS\n\nUnlike the Wii version, the Android and iOS follows almost the same formula as the console version. Players can explore Manhattan, while having some crimes to deal with. The story is linear, but the player can explore the city before entering the missions. The missions consists in three types: Pursue, where the player pursues Lizard and another enemies in the game, Combat, where fighting and webbing skills can be used to fight enemies to clear an objective. And Mix, in which combat and pursue is combined, and some other things too, like a \"sliding\" section. The game, just like the console version, has voice acting, free-roam, level system and suit system. In this version, like the Wii version, the player does not unlock all the suits from the console version. Unlike the 3DS version, the Android version does not has additional content like exclusive modes.\n\nPlot\n\nMonths after the events of the film, Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy sneak into the restricted areas of Oscorp after hours to investigate rumors of the company continuing Curt Connors' cross-species experiments. They are caught by new Oscorp director Alistair Smythe, who confirms the rumors and gives them a tour of Oscorp's restricted areas to see the experiments for themselves. However, the cross-species react to Peter, a cross-species himself, and break out, infecting numerous scientists, including Smythe and Gwen, with a deadly virus they are carrying. Donning his Spider-Man suit, Peter gets the infected to quarantine, but fails to stop the cross-species from escaping into the city.\n\nAfter a fight with S-01, a massive cross-species hunting robot created by Oscorp, Spider-Man breaks Connors out of the mental institute where he was imprisoned to help find a cure for the virus. Spider-Man and Connors set up a laboratory at the apartment of Aunt May's friend Stan, and begin development of an antidote while keeping in close contact with Gwen and Smythe via webcam, unaware that Smythe is developing his own \"cure\" using nanobots that destroy the host from the inside out. After defeating Rhino, one of the escaped cross-species, Spider-Man retrieves Connors' research from a secret Oscorp lab before it gets destroyed. While there, he meets Whitney Chang, an undercover investigative reporter, who enlists Spider-Man's help in unveiling Oscorp's suspicious activities. Spider-Man also collects a blood sample from the rat cross-species, Vermin, for Connors' antidote, before battling a group of Hunters, another type of Oscorp cross-species hunting robots.\n\nSpider-Man eventually delivers Connors' antidote to Gwen at Oscorp, now under complete quarantine. However, a skeptical Smythe takes and tests it on himself, claiming that, if it works, Oscorp will replicate it and he will take all the credit as the city's savior. However, instead of curing him, the antidote causes Smythe to lose the use of his legs and sanity. Enraged, he commands his robots to eliminate Spider-Man, who escapes after destroying S-02, a massive serpent-like robot. Realizing that Spider-Man is a unique cross-species who retains his humanity, Connors creates a new antidote using his DNA, which Spider-Man again delivers to Oscorp, fighting his way past security and the Scorpion cross-species. The antidote works, saving Gwen and the other infected scientists.\n\nAs the CDC quarantines the city due to the advancement of the virus and Connor begins work on replicating the antidote, Spider-Man returns to his heroic activities, foiling a bank robbery orchestrated by Felicia Hardy. Meanwhile, Smythe, having been fired from Oscorp for his actions, discovers Spider-Man's secret identity and kidnaps Connors from their apartment, challenging Spider-Man to come and rescue him at Oscorp's robotics facility. While he rescues Connors, Spider-Man is captured by Smythe, who injects him with a nanobot serum that strips away his powers, and reveals his plan to spread the same serum across the city using his greatest invention yet, S-03, unaware that the nanobots are slowly killing the host. Spider-Man escapes and makes his way across a Manhattan consumed by chaos to reach Connors' secret lab, where he reunites with him and Gwen.\n\nWhile Connors transforms into the Lizard and leaves to try and stop Smythe, Gwen resuscitates the dying Spider-Man with an AED. Realizing that electricity can destroy the nanobots, Spider-Man leaves to assist Connors and boards S-03 with Whitney Chang's help, whereupon he electrocutes himself to destroy the nanobots, regaining his powers. Spider-Man and Connors defeat Smythe, but Connors then succumbs to the Lizard's consciousness and flees into the sewers. Leaving a remorseful Smythe, who regained his sanity, for the police, Spider-Man pursues the Lizard. Along the way, he encounters and defeats Natie, the piranha cross-species, and saves Gwen, who has reprogrammed a Hunter to administer Connors' antidote across the city. Eventually, Spider-Man defeats and cures the Lizard, whereupon Connors willingly returns to prison. As the city eturns to normal, both Spider-Man and the Lizard are credited as its saviors. Peter and Gwen learn from the news that Smythe has escaped custody but decide to deal with it later.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Smythe, having regained the use of his legs due to being in the final stages of his infection, returns to his lab and commands one of his Hunters to kill him, choosing to die rather than become a cross-species or take Connors' cure, which he believes will not be a permanent solution.\n\nDevelopment and marketing\n\nA video game based on the movie was first announced at the 2011 New York Comic Con. The game was developed by Beenox, the development team behind the previous two Spider-Man games, Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions and Spider-Man: Edge of Time. During New York Comic Con a producer at Activision, Doug Heder stated that the game will take place after the events of the movie.[16][17] Heder noticed the mixed reviews with the last video game, promising that the video game will find a different fate, thanks to its lengthy development time.[16] The video game has been reported to be in development by Gerard Lehiany, the creative director of Beenox.[16] Dee Brown of Beenox felt that the movie was an inspiration of the development of the video game on how the creators wanted it to turn out: \"The fact that our game is based on the movie, and the movie is re-approaching the universe in a completely different way \u2014 a more grounded, more realistic approach \u2014 gives us an incredible setting to play with\".[13]\n\nThe game released on June 26, 2012.[16][18] The first concept artwork of the game was released on November 10, 2011.[19] A world premiere trailer debuted during the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards, on December 10.[20][21] The game was originally developed for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo 3DS.[22] It was later announced that game will be released for PC, however the port was released on August 10, 2012. The game features PlayStation Move support.[11] The game featured pre-order bonuses.\n\nDownloadable content\n\nFour DLC packs have been released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions.[23] The Rhino Challenge pack was a GameStop exclusive pre-order, and has players control the Rhino and attacking vehicles and thugs throughout the city, and features the 2002-07 suit from the Sam Raimi films as a bonus suit. The Lizard Rampage pack has players control the Lizard and attacking guards while destroying generators, and features the Vigilante suit from The Amazing Spider-Man movie as a bonus suit. The Oscorp Search and Destroy pack has two minigames with similar gameplay to the Snake and Space Invaders. The Stan Lee Adventure pack was an Amazon.com pre-order exclusive, where the player can free roam as Stan Lee (with Spider-Man's powers) around the city, and can also play a special minigame where Stan has to find pages to a script that's dedicated to Spider-Man's 50th anniversary, at the time.[24]\n\nWii U Ultimate Edition\n\nThe Wii U version, call The Amazing Spider-Man: Ultimate Edition, was released March 5 in North America and March 8, 2013, in Europe. It's completely unlike the PS3, the Xbox 360, and the PC versions, and features all downloadable content installed onto the disc. The game also gives the player the option to use the Osphone on the Wii U Gamepad.\n\nPlayStation Vita Port\n\nA PlayStation Vita version of the game was confirmed on the PlayStation Blog on October 11 and released on November 19, 2013.\n\nReception\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man received mixed to positive reviews with the PS3 version being the best received game. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the PlayStation 3 version 71/100,[27] the Xbox 360 version 69/100,[31] the Wii U version 66/100,[30] the Wii version 58/100,[29] and the 3DS version 55/100.[25]\n\nGameSpot gave it a 7.5/10, praising its controls while criticizing its easiness.[34] Game Informer had a more critical view of the game, scoring it 6.75/10, citing failure to live up to potential due to its generic story and repetitive side missions.[33] IGN gave the game a 7.0/10 with Greg Miller saying \"the visuals aren't stunning, the story isn't crazy exciting but The Amazing Spider-Man is fun to play\".[36] ABC's Good Game were positive with the game with Hex giving a 7 and Bajo an 8 saying, \"I was just so happy to have an open world Spider-Man game again, and it's just so much fun swinging around.\"[48] 1Up.com gave the game a C- and criticized the subpar open world that made the in-game New York City feel like a \"post-apocalyptic nightmare-scape.\"[32]\n\nSequel\n\nA narrative sequel taking place in the same universe as in the video game and it based on the movie sequel, was released on April 29, 2014, for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Xbox 360, Xbox One, iOS and Android\n\nReferences"}], "Adam Collis is known for The Fault in Our Stars (2014).": [{"url": "https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-fault-in-our-stars-2014", "page_content": "So much of what worked on the page\u2014and made Green\u2019s writing so lively and engaging\u2014gets lost in translation and feels uncomfortably precocious when actual people actually say his words out loud. (Screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, who also wrote the romantic charmers \"(500) Days of Summer\" and \"The Spectacular Now,\" remained very faithful to the book, which should make the core tween/teen fan base happy. Okay? Okay.)\n\nThere\u2019s a specificity to Green\u2019s language; his characters are hyper-verbal, self-aware and fiercely biting in the tradition of \"Heathers\" and \"Clueless.\" They know all too well that pop culture depicts cancer\u2014especially young people with cancer\u2014in a mawkish manner that they refuse to accept as they regard their own conditions. But while the flip, jaunty verbosity they use as a shield produces some pleasingly acerbic humor, it often feels forced and false in this setting.\n\nStill, Shailene Woodley\u2019s abiding, disarming naturalism consistently keeps you engaged. She just doesn\u2019t hit a false note. Following winning turns in the indie dramas \"The Descendants\" and \"The Spectacular Now,\" and the blockbuster \"Divergent,\" Woodley continues to cement her accessible and likable on-screen persona. Her work is so strong, it makes you wish she had a better performance to play off of to create the sparky chemistry at the heart of this story.\n\nWoodley stars as Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 16-year-old Indianapolis girl who\u2019s diagnosed with cancer at 13. It weakens her lungs, forcing her to drag an oxygen tank behind her wherever she goes and to stop to rest after climbing a flight of stairs. While her situation looked bleak a few years ago, participation in a new drug trial has prolonged her life for an indefinite amount of time. Her parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammell, with whom she shares some lovely, honest moments) try not to hover over their daughter as she attempts to maintain some vague semblance of teenage life, and they even share her fondness for using dark humor to defuse difficult moments.\n\nMom insists that Hazel attends weekly cancer support group meetings (where comedian Mike Birbiglia is the amusingly earnest leader). There, she meets the handsome and equally loquacious Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort, who coincidentally played Woodley\u2019s brother earlier this year in \"Divergent\"). A former high school basketball star, Augustus lost his right leg below the knee to the disease and now walks with a prosthetic. In Hazel, he immediately recognizes a kindred spirit: a quick-witted smart-ass who can\u2019t take any of the feel-good platitudes seriously."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/19/fault-in-our-stars-review-john-green", "page_content": "You have to admire the brutal efficiency in this emotional teen movie, based on the colossal young adult bestseller by John Green, which for the most part enforces the silver ring of abstinence with cancer. You have to concede the laser-guided accuracy and psychotic vehemence with which it goes for the tear duct. It's like being mugged by a professional whose skills in mixed martial arts you can't help but notice and appreciate, even as you are savagely beaten, then dragged upright, bruised and bleeding, and forced to watch as your assailant gives fully 45% of your money to charity.\n\nShailene Woodley (from Divergent, and Alexander Payne's The Descendants) plays Hazel, a teenage cancer patient, whose thyroid lesions have metastasised to her lungs; her condition, once gravely critical, has stabilised due to experimental drug treatment, but she has to wheel around a portable oxygen tank, a lite-tragical accessory. In the support group that her mom (Laura Dern) forces her to attend, Hazel catches the eye of Gus (Ansel Elgort), a cute boy, whose osteosarcoma condition is also stabilised after the amputation of one leg, although this is mostly concealed under his jeans.\n\nThey are as rich and attractive as teens in a Nancy Meyers movie, with a quirky, smart, back-talking relationship. Life-affirming Gus likes to have an unlit cigarette in his mouth to show his existential defiance. Despite being such an obvious hottie, Gus is a virgin. Hazel's own condition in this respect is apparently so self-evident that she never says it out loud. It is all too clearly Gus's virginity, not his cancer, which is his heartbreaking vulnerability, like Rochester getting to be blind at the beginning and not the end of Jane Eyre. \"You two are so adorable,\" says Hazel's mother, out loud, without anyone nearby screaming.\n\nHazel is obsessed with a novel called An Imperial Affliction with a bafflingly abrupt ending, all about a girl dying of cancer, written by a reclusive author called Peter van Houten. (The title may have been inspired by Siddhartha Mukherjee's Pulitzer-winning study The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer.) Impulsive, entrancing Gus whisks her and her mom off to Amsterdam to meet her hero, and it is a journey that is to bring their relationship to a crisis.\n\nNow, there may be people who can witness a halfway competent dramatic representation of the death of children from cancer without choking up. I am not among them \u2013 and it was the same before I became a parent. But through the occasional mist of tears, the essential phoney-baloniness of this film looked even worse. Woodley is very good, no doubt about it. What might this talented young star achieve if she were in a film which was not fantastically manipulative and crass?\n\nFlashbacks show that Woodley's character lost her hair when she was 12. It has thankfully grown back, but she is wearing it austerely short. Gus is way cute, and his lifestyle, like Hazel's, does not appear to be modified in any appreciable way by his illness. They are both extremely comfortably off, and Gus's bedroom is like a starter man-cave for a wealthy and obnoxious young man \u2013 so ostentatious, in fact, that I assumed some learning experience, some comeuppance, was coming his way.\n\nBut no. Their respective parents are also in this too-good-to-be-true bracket, although Hazel's mom appears to have whispered something extraordinary to Hazel, when she was in a grave situation in hospital years previously. It is something that Hazel has not forgotten and that should theoretically deepen and complicate their relationship profoundly. But the pair just hug it out. It's like it never happened.\n\nThe Fault in Our Stars reaches a nadir of horror when Hazel and Gus visit the Anne Frank House. The couple are overwhelmed with emotion at their own situation and make out, while the surrounding crowd melt with romcom bliss, offering encouragement in various European languages. The Pont des Arts in Paris is becoming choked with padlocks affixed by lovers. Maybe now there will be a nonstop traffic jam of sad snogging teens in Anne Frank's bedroom.\n\nThe title is taken from Cassius in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar: \"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars/ But in ourselves, that we are underlings.\" Perhaps getting cancer was written in the stars for them, but Hazel and Gus realise that it is \"in themselves\" to do something in response, up to them to make the best of life. That's fair enough. And perhaps therapeutic escapism is the point of The Fault in Our Stars \u2013 although Hazel claims that it is the real thing. This prettified cancer fantasy comes nowhere near."}, {"url": "https://kidadl.com/facts/the-fault-in-our-stars-facts-a-film-based-on-a-true-life-story", "page_content": "In the summer of 2014, the world was introduced to 'The Fault In Our Stars.'\n\nThis romantic drama was based on the best-selling novel of the same name by John Green. It told the story of two young cancer patients who fell in love.\n\nThe film was a huge success, both commercially and critically. But what many people don't know is that the story is based on a true-life story. The script of the movie was written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber. Josh Boone directed the movie. We will now take a look at some facts about 'The Fault In Our Stars' that you may not have known. Continue reading to learn more about the inspiration behind this book.\n\nActors And Characters In 'The Fault In Our Stars'\n\nThe main characters in the film are Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters. These characters are cancer patients who meet at a support group for young people with cancer. The two of them quickly fall in love and embark on a journey together. Other significant characters in the film include Peter Van Houten, Isaac, and Augustus' mother. Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort, Nat Wolff, Laura Dern, Sam Trammell, and Willem Dafoer are some of the actors in the movie.\n\nHazel Grace Lancaster is the main character in 'The Fault In Our Stars.'

Hazel is forced to attend a cancer support group, where she meets Augustus Waters. The role of Hazel was played by Shailene Woodley, who is best known for her roles in the 'Divergent' series and 'The Secret Life Of The American Teenager.'\n\nAugustus Waters is the male lead in 'The Fault In Our Stars.' He is a 17-year-old cancer patient who meets and falls in love with Hazel Grace Lancaster.\n\nBefore losing his leg to a type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma, he was a basketball star. Ansel Elgort portrays Augustus in the film.\n\nNat Wolff was cast as Issac in the movie. In the novel, Issac is a male character. He has eye cancer which has caused him to go blind. Hazel and Issac attend the same support group.\n\nIn the novel and the film, Peter Van Houten is the author of a book-within-the-book, 'An Imperial Affliction.' Actor Willem Dafoe played the role. In the film, he is shown to be a reclusive and eccentric writer.\n\nHazel and Augustus meet him when they travel to Amsterdam in an attempt to find out more about the book.\n\nBehind The Scene Facts Of 'The Fault In Our Stars'\n\nYou know all there is to know about Hazel, but you don't know everything there is to know about Augustus.\n\nAnsel revealed that he spent a lot of time with Tanner Boatwright, his body double who had lost his leg in a hunting accident, to actually know how things are for him and portray the character in a much better way.\n\nBelieve it or not, the film was shot in less than three months\u2014two months of shooting in Pittsburgh and three days in Amsterdam.\n\nWhile we all thought Ansel lost a few pounds by the end of the film to fit in character, he did not lose any. The costume department came up with a brilliant idea as it would be unhealthy for Ansel to lose 10-15 lb (4.5-6.8 kg) just for a couple of scenes. They decided to size up his clothes to make it look like he had lost weight. Brilliant, right?\n\nBudget And Awards Won For 'The Fault In Our Stars'\n\n'The Fault In Our Stars' had a modest budget of $12 million (gross). This is relatively low for a Hollywood blockbuster.\n\nHowever, the film went on to gross over $300 million at the worldwide box office.\n\n15th Golden Trailer Award, Teen Choice Awards 2014, Young Hollywood Awards, 18th Hollywood Film Awards, 41st People's Choice Awards, and MTV Movie Awards are some of the awards the movie has won.\n\n'The Fault in Our Stars' was named TIME Magazine's #1 Fiction Book of 2012 after debuting at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list.\n\nDid You Know...\n\nThough most of the movie will make you weep, there are some fun facts that you might want to know if you are a fan.\n\nAugustus keeps Issac company after his breakup with Monica. At the time, he sings 'I've Been Breaking All The Rules,' which is a line from the song 'Rules' by Nat and Alex Wolff.\n\nMost of the authors find it difficult to pick out a favorite scene but not John Green. John Green said that most of his favorite scenes in the movie come from Nat Wolff. He added that Nat's subtle comedy has made the scenes even more interesting.\n\nThe flawless scenes in the movie have made fans appreciate the director. Fans were shocked to find out that 'The Fault In Our Stars' was just the second movie directed by Josh Boone. Previously, he worked on a minor movie, 'Stuck In Love.'\n\nShailene Woodley was not the choice for the lead role as the crew felt that she was too pretty and healthy-looking. However, following the audition, Josh Boone stated that out of the 250 actresses that auditioned for the part, he was only able to picture Shailene in Hazel's place. When Shailene chopped her hair off for the role, she donated it to children with hair loss.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow is Natalie Portman connected to Hazel?\n\nAccording to Augustus, Hazel reminded him of Natalie Portman from 'V For Vendetta.'\n\nHow old is Hazel in 'The Fault In Our Stars'?\n\nHazel is 16 years old in 'The Fault In Our Stars.'\n\nIs 'The Fault In Our Stars' based on a true story?\n\nYes, 'The Fault In Our Stars' is based on a true story.

Though the novel follows a tragic story, it shows the happy-sad relationship between the primary characters. The story\u2019s focus on the weaknesses and struggles of its characters made it become a popular attraction for teenagers and young adults.\n\n\n\n\n\nThemes\n\nLove and Friendship\n\nLove and friendship are the primary themes of \u2018The Fault in Our Stars.\u2019 Throughout the novel, John Green showed how Hazel and Augustus sailed through their love for each other. The story focused on its primary character\u2019s relationship and showed how it slowly progressed from mutual friendship to love.\n\nOn meeting Augustus, Hazel became attracted to him, and soon, she shared her most prized possession with him. On introducing him to \u2018An Imperial Affliction,\u2019 their relationship blossoms, and after they go to Amsterdam to meet Peter Van Houten, Hazel realizes she has fallen for Augustus. After professing their love for each other, Augustus reveals that his cancer is back. Hazel begins to navigate through the experience of seeing the person she loves fade from existence.\n\nThe novel shows how powerful friendships get. Isaac and Augustus had a strong bond that lived beyond Augustus\u2019s death; this showed the value of their relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\nPain and Suffering\n\nThough the novel showed moments of happiness and love in its characters\u2019 lives, it focused more on their reality, pain, and suffering. As a novel that narrates the struggle of living with cancer, the story of \u2018The Fault in Our Stars\u2019 perfectly portrays the suffering associated with cancer.\n\nThe novel\u2019s attention to the reality of cancer made it an extremely relatable book. After Hazel met Augustus, she realized that she could not escape her life of suffering. On meeting Peter Van Houten, she got forced to confront her reality as Van Houten told her that her ailment was nothing but an effect of evolution; this made her realize that she could never escape the pain. She had to watch Augustus gradually become a shadow of himself; this ate away at her, and when he died, she felt trapped in a cage of her pain and suffering.\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentity\n\nIn \u2018The Fault in Our Stars,\u2019 Hazel and Augustus tried to navigate a life of pain and suffering while simultaneously discovering their feelings for each other. Augustus was a person who believed that leaving a mark in life was crucial. However, Hazel argued otherwise, stating that the legacy left behind by great people will turn into nothing but scars. The novel showed how Hazel, Isaac, Augustus, and other teenagers struggled to find their identity in a world of cancer and pain.\n\n\n\n\n\nLife and Death\n\nDeath is a primary theme in \u2018The Fault in Our Stars.\u2019 Though Hazel tried to show her strength amid suffering, she admitted that her death would bring undiluted pain to her parents and those around her. Seeing herself as a time grenade, she desperately tried to protect her family from the future impact of her death. With her life getting shorter and shorter, Hazel tried to resist falling in love with Augustus because she feared that death would only hurt him more. After Augustus revealed that he was dying from cancer, Hazel began to wish that her life was a bit different. The pain of watching Augustus die tormented her.\n\n\n\n\n\nComing of Age\n\nOne thing the novel talks about is maturity. The loss of innocence became a crucial turning point in Hazel and Augustus\u2019s lives as they matured into adulthood. They realized that their lives would circle cancer, pain, and death.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Key Moments\n\nHazel\u2019s doctor and mother advise her to attend a support group. On joining the support group, Hazel meets Augustus, a seventeen-year-old boy who had his right leg removed due to Osteosarcoma. Hazel and Augustus become friends. They exchange their favorite novels. Hazel gives him \u2018An Imperial Affliction,\u2019 and she collects \u2018The Prince of Dawn.\u2019 Augustus gets frustrated by An Imperial Affliction\u2019s ending but learns from Hazel that Peter Van Houten, its author, has moved to Amsterdam. Isaac, Augustus\u2019s friend, gets dumped by his girlfriend, Monica. Augustus reveals to Hazel that he has tracked Peter Van Houten\u2019s assistant, Lidewiji Vliegenthart, and has begun an exchange of emails with Van Houten. Hazel and Augustus start exchanging emails with Van Houten, and finally, they get invited to Amsterdam. Augustus uses his genie wish to get tickets for Hazel, himself, and her mother to see Van Houten. Hazel meets Van Houten but discovers he is a mean alcoholic. He refuses to answer her question, and in a fit of rage, she storms out of his house. Van Houten\u2019s assistant takes Hazel and Augustus to Anne Frank\u2019s house. Hazel and Augustus kiss for the first time. Hazel and Augustus lose their virginity to each other. Augustus reveals that his cancer had returned and spread throughout his body. On returning home, Augustus\u2019s health deteriorates, and he dies. Van Houten tries to apologize to Hazel at Augustus\u2019s funeral, but she rejects his apology. Van Houten\u2019s assistant tells Hazel of the letters Augustus had sent to Van Houten, and on reading one, she discovers he wrote an obituary for her.\n\n\n\n\n\nStyle, Tone, and Figurative Language\n\n\u2018The Fault in Our Stars\u2019 employs a sad but vibrant tone but the melancholy switches when Hazels falls in love with Augustus and becomes a happy tone. Hazel\u2019s straightforwardness made the story progress rapidly as she served as the narrator from a first-person\u2019s perspective.\n\nThe story uses similes, metaphors, personifications, and allusions to create a delicately interesting word structure. Metaphors like Augustus\u2019s use of cigarettes created an ironic portrayal of the story\u2019s narrative.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Symbols\n\nAn Imperial Affliction\n\nThe book \u2018An Imperial Affliction\u2019 has many metaphorical reflections on Hazel\u2019s life. She admitted to the book being like a Bible for her because it was one of the few novels that understood what it felt like to be dying. Hazel stated that Peter Van Houten was a writer who understood death. After reading the book numerously, Hazel became addicted to the fate of the story\u2019s characters; this makes her travel to Amsterdam in search of answers. However, on reaching Amsterdam, she got hit by reality as she discovered that Van Houten had no suitable answer to her questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nCigarettes\n\nIn the novel, Augustus kept a cigarette pack. When asked about why he had a cigarette placed in his mouth, he stated that it was a representation of trying to prove that one had power over a force of evil. The cigarette symbolizes the belief that something can only harm a person when they let it hurt them.\n\n\n\n\n\nOxygen Tank\n\nThroughout the novel, Hazel always uses an oxygen tank. The tank represents the blockade that stood between life and death for Hazel.\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat are the primary themes of The Fault in Our Stars? \u2018The Fault in Our Stars\u2019 implements many themes synonymous with teenagers; this includes themes of coming of age, love, and identity.

When Hazel got angry at Augustus for putting a cigarette in his mouth, he told her that the cigarette was a metaphor. He explained that having the cigarette in his mouth without smoking gave him power over death."}, {"url": "https://bookanalysis.com/john-green/the-fault-in-our-stars/historical-context/", "page_content": "\u2018The Fault in Our Stars\u2019 is a young adult realistic fiction novel that shows the life of a young girl thrown into a world of depression, cancer, and love. After its publication, the story became an international sensation because it reflected the life of a sixteen-year-old girl called Esther Earl. John\u2019s experience with terminally ill children like Esther made the story intricately relatable to the readers.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Context\n\nDeath is a concept that makes many people believe that their lives have meaning in the bigger picture of the universe. However, there are some people whose lives are unchangeable, and they realize that their life would only be another sad story in the book of history.\n\n\u2018The Fault in Our Stars\u2019 is a story formed from the experiences of a person who had to watch his friend die from something they had no control over. John Green wrote the story after his dear friend, Esther Earl, lost her life to cancer. Because of experiencing parts of her life, Hazel\u2019s story became one that resonated with people who have experienced the pain of losing a loved one from an incurable ailment.\n\nThe story\u2019s attention to the issues of life made it realistic. However, John included a fundamental element in the story, love. His novel showed that love is a feeling that sparks even in the darkest situations. With love, life became a bit bearable for the story\u2019s characters; this reflected an ideology that love does not have to be the opposite of pain and suffering, which was also one of the main themes in \u2018The Fault in Our Stars\u2019.\n\nOne thing \u2018The Fault in Our Stars\u2019 pays attention to is the relevance of family.

It set a precedent for a new era of realistic fiction. Before it, no story dived into the mental and emotional trauma experienced by teenagers thrown into the world of a terminal disease. However, after its publication, the love genre got introduced to a new type of storytelling that involved diving into the life of young adults faced with the bleak reality that their lives would never be the same as that of their peers.\n\nThe story also introduced the concept of teen fantasies. Before it, there was little focus on the romantic fantasies of teenagers. However, the story paved the way for novels that started to place teen characters at the center of action and romance.\n\nThe novel received excellent recognition from teenagers and adults. Before it, many adults paid little attention to stories that portray the transition from teenagehood to adulthood and the obstacles young adults face in their lives. However, with the novel\u2019s publication, the young adult genre started receiving an audience from adults.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdaptation and Awards\n\n\u2018The Fault in Our Stars\u2019 became an instant hit on its publication.
