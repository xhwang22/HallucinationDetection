The age calculator calculates age given a date of birth in years, months and days. You can also use this calculator to find length of time between two dates.\n\nThe age calculator finds the age time span in years months and days, months and days, and in total days only.\n\nHow to Calculate Age\n\nThis age calculator uses 2 similar but slightly different methods to calculate age. One method is used to give age in years, months and days, and also months and days. The other method is used to very precisely calculate age in total days only.\n\nWhen calculating age to the detailed level of days it's important to remember that not all months have the same number of days. Also, while a year has 365 days, a leap year has 366 days.\n\nWhen you calculate age in terms that include years, this calculator provides the answer in common terms. For example, a teenager might say he is 15 years old rather than saying he's 12 normal years old plus 3 leap years old. This age calculator uses the same assumption -- although we know years may have different lengths, we generalize between regular years and leap years, and call them equal.\n\nThe same is true for months. If a baby is 7 months old, the parents would not say she is 4 months that are 31 days long, plus 2 months that are 30 days long, plus 1 month that is 28 days long. We typically generalize across months of different lengths, and count them all equal as general months.\n\nThe age calculator finds age in terms that are commonly used, calling all years equal and all months equal. When calculating days however, the calculator uses a function to find the precise number of days between dates.\n\nIf you wanted to know how many days you've been alive you need to account for extra days in leap years. You also need to know the total number of months with 31 days, total months with 30 days, and total months with 28 days.\n\nThe age calculator uses a function that recognizes how many leap years are in a given time span. It also calculates the specific number of days in a partial year. For example, if you were born on March 5 and today is June 7, the calculator finds the exact number of days that occur between those dates.\n\nYour age in total number of days is calculated as:\n\nNumber of years, x, with 365 days = 365x plus\n\nNumber of years, y, with 366 days = 366y plus\n\nNumber of days in the remaining partial year\n\nThis calculator assumes the start date is day 0 and begins counting one full day after day 0. For example if you input the dates 03/15/2022 and 3/18/2022 into the calculator you will get a total age of 3 days. Day 1 is the 16th, day 2 is the 17th, and day 3 is the 18th. The 15th is not counted in the tally of days.\n\nDate Formats\n\nThe age calculator allows you to input single digit months and days. You do not have to pad them with a leading zero. You must input the 4-digit year however.\n\nUS date formatting can use a forward slash, a period, or a dash:\n\nmm/dd/yyyy\n\nmm.dd.yyyy\n\nmm-dd-yyyy\n\nEuropean date formatting can use a forward slash, a period, or a dash:\n\ndd/mm/yyyy\n\ndd.mm.yyyy\n\ndd-mm-yyyy\n\nInternational date formatting according to ISO 8601 use only a dash (-):\n\nyyyy-mm-dd\n\nToday's date is based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).\n\nRelated Calculators: Date Difference, Date \u00b1 Days or Business Days Calculator."}], "Ted Childs is American.": [{"url": "https://www.thehistorymakers.org/biography/ted-childs-jr", "page_content": "Diversity strategist J.T.

He graduated from Classical High School in 1962, and received his B.A. degree in psychology from West Virginia State University in 1967.\n\n\n\nUpon graduation, Childs joined IBM as a personnel administration trainee. He went on to work in several staff and managerial positions at IBM, including program manager of personnel operations. He was subsequently appointed IBM's vice president of global workforce diversity, where he oversaw the company's diversity programs and policies. From March of 1983 to September of 1984, Childs served as executive assistant to Dr. Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the NAACP, on an IBM Social Service Leave. In 1989, he was appointed by Governor Mario Cuomo to the New York State Governor\u2019s Advisory Council on Child Care; and, in 1995, Childs was appointed as an official delegate to the White House Conference on Aging. In 1997, U.S. Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, appointed Childs as an advisor to the Secretary\u2019s Working Group on Child Care. In 2006, Childs retired from IBM and founded the consulting firm, Ted Childs, LLC, where he serves as a strategic diversity advisor.\n\n\n\nChilds is a member of the board of trustees, and past chair of the West Virginia State University Foundation. He is a member of the Executive Leadership Council (ELC); The Families and Work Institute board of directors; was installed as a Fellow of The National Academy of Human Resources in 2001; and has served as co-chair of the National Council of Jewish Women\u2019s Work Family Advisory Board.

For Childs, it\u2019s about economics\u2014the strongest argument for diversity in the workplace is that it\u2019s good business.\n\n\u201cAs a moral argument for hiring women, ethnic minorities, or the gay community or the disabled, the argument of affirmative action has failed. It hasn\u2019t worked,\u201d the 36-year IBM veteran and the company\u2019s vice-president of global workforce diversity told a Wabash College audience. \u201cThose who say you should have affirmative action for moral reasons undermine its intent.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at diversity, I see it not through the lens of affirmative action, but as a discussion of business,\u201d Childs said. \u201cI believe that affirmative action is a passenger in the car, but the driver is the marketplace.\n\n\u201cWhen we are guided by the marketplace, we will hire people who are different, promote them, and allow them to achieve,\u201d Childs said. \u201cI believe that no matter who you hate, no matter the depth of your bigotry, you don\u2019t hate anyone more than you love money. And given the opportunity to have me spend my money with you, you will blink, be that because you\u2019re greedy, or simply because you\u2019re a good businessperson.\n\n\u201cAffirmative action cannot be a race and gender discussion; that is limiting and very inappropriately defining,\u201d Childs insisted, keeping the focus on economics. \u201cThere are 31 million people in America living below the poverty line, and 14 million of them are white. And I ask the question, \u2018What is to become of them?\u2019 My answer is that they must be exposed to the same affirmative action tools that are made available to people who look like me who are poor. Our social and economic strategy must say that we\u2019re not going to leave people behind, and that people who are poor, regardless of their color or gender, have to be able to access the assistance this country is able to provide.\n\n\u201cI have not forgotten that I am black,\u201d Childs said. \u201cBut I am also American, and I don\u2019t believe that black people can be strong in a country that succeeds by leaving other people behind.\n\n\u201cAffirmative action, in many minds, implies taking from someone else to give somebody an advantage. I believe affirmative action must be defined as eliminating disadvantage, not giving anyone an advantage.\u201d\n\nChilds cited IBM as an example of diversity being good for business. He recalled the company\u2019s \u201ca heritage of inclusion\u201d and financial success, including an equal opportunity statement established by the IBM president more than 15 years before the Civil Rights Act. He also outlined the company\u2019s efforts to attract and keep top workers by creating a worker-friendly and supportive environment, including helping them to balance work and personal lives.\n\nIBM\u2019s work/life initiative focuses on different cultural expectations, dependent care, and flexibility for caregivers.\n\n\u201cChildcare and dependent care are important to a company\u2014not out of charity, but because it\u2019s a productivity issue,\u201d Childs said. \u201cWe have to support the needs of our employees so they can focus on their jobs.\u201d\n\nWith companies selling to an increasingly non-white customer base and with the global marketplace requiring large companies to stretch into a wide range of diversity is becoming essential to staying on the cutting edge. Childs has found himself speaking at many corporations and groups outside of IBM, helping others to \u201cdefine your customers and ensuring that you look like them.\n\n\u201cIf people can\u2019t see others like themselves being treated fairly within a company, they should and will take their money somewhere else,\u201d Childs concluded. \u201cThis is the business case for diversity.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.allamericanspeakers.com/speakers/10406/Ted-Childs", "page_content": "When Ted Childs started at IBM over 39 years ago, equal opportunity was considered a core principle of the company\u2019s values with a strong history of focus on gender, race, and disability.

In the 1997 New Year\u2019s Honours List, he was made an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for services to Broadcast Television. In July, 2015, the University of Nottingham awarded him the honorary degree of doctor of letters."}, {"url": "https://www.earlychildhoodeducationzone.com/ted-talks-early-childhood-education/", "page_content": "10 Must watch TED talks about Early Childhood Education\n\nTED conferences bring the world\u2019s greatest minds together to share revolutionary progress and exchange creative ideas. Some of the best TED talks have been devoted to ensuring that the next generation embraces the values that TED represents: innovation, creativity, and globalization of information. The following talks are some of TED\u2019s best on education. Any educator or even someone simply with an interest in education would be remiss if he or she did not take a look at these inspiring videos.\n\nEvery Kid Needs a Champion \u2013 Rita Pierson\n\nAfter teaching for 40 years, Rita Pierson shares the insights she has gained about how to be an exceptional teacher with the TED audience. With her personal stories and engaging tone, Pierson stresses the importance of creating genuine relationships with students by connecting with them on an emotional level. She insists that every kid needs an adult who believes in him or her. She balks at the notion that teaching is strictly an impersonal 9 to 5 endeavor, instead believing that teachers have a higher calling to shape the lives of the next generation. Her call to action at the end of her presentation is that everyone should believe the same.\n\n\n\nTeachers Need Real Feedback \u2013 Bill Gates\n\nBill Gates makes a compelling case for transforming the teaching professions. He insists that one word of feedback, \u201csatisfactory,\u201d is not enough to encourage teachers to become the best in their trade. Alarmingly, the single word \u201csatisfactory\u201d is in fact the only kind of feedback that 90 percent of teachers get. Gates insists that to become the world leader for educational quality, we must adopt a model similar to that of China for giving feedback to teachers (which is #1 in the world for reading, math, and science). More than that, we can leverage technology to get detailed feedback by recording an instructor while he or she teaches.\n\nBuilding Blocks That Blink, Beep, and Teach \u2013 Ayah Bdeir\n\nIn 1968, Lego made engineering buildings possible for kids through its simple connectible toy blocks designed to mimic concrete bricks. Calling transistors the concrete blocks of our time, Ayah Bdeir has taken Legos idea a step further by making building transistors possible for those without much knowledge about electronics using her \u201cLittle Bits.\u201d Little bit are individual components that can be snapped together using magnets to create little electronic devices such as a confetti blower or a moving, glow-in-the-dark lobster. Ayah hopes that her Little Bits will encourage kids and adults alike to learn about electronics and the way in which circuits work.\n\nLet\u2019s Use Video to Reinvent Education \u2013 Salman Khan\n\nSalman Khan describes the power of his website Khan Academy to revolutionize education. Khan Academy began as a series of YouTube videos that he used to tutor his cousins in math. Using his step by step videos, millions of students have been able to learn at their own pace and grasp difficult concepts. Since then, Salman has given up his career as a hedge fund analyst to run his not-for-profit business full time. He\u2019s expanded his website from simply hosting a collection of his videos to establishing a comprehensive curriculum in diverse subjects\u2013all accessible to the entire world for free. He describes how teachers can use Khan Academy to use classroom time more efficiently.\n\nHow Schools Kill Creativity \u2013 Ken Robinson\n\nKen Robinson makes the case that the structure of the educational system is sabotaging students by trying to make them all a homogeneous group. He insists that only children destined to be university professors benefit from our current model, while future painters, dancers, musicians, and woodworkers are made to suppress their talents. He argues that in this day and age, a college degree has little meaning because of education inflation. Now, we need more than degrees; we need creativity, and we can help the next generation regain theirs by cultivating their diverse talents instead of squashing them.\n\nThe Child-Driven Education \u2013 Sugata Mitra\n\nAs Sugata Mitra points out, often the most capable teachers are far and few between in the areas where they are most needed. He proposes that the answer to this problem can be unlocked through the power of the internet. Though a series of pilots across the country in areas such as New Delhi, South Africa, and Italy, he found that the physical presence of a teacher is not always a necessity. Children are surprisingly capable of teaching themselves when giving the proper structure. His findings have great potential for the future of education.\n\nBring on The Learning Revolution \u2013 Ken Robinson\n\nSir Ken Robinson is back for his second TED talk on education riddled with jokes and anecdotes. All silliness aside, true to the tune of his first talk, Robinson calls for a fundamental change in the way schools work. He is convinced that the standardized, one-size-fits-all approach that our schools have adopted is leading us to failure. The solution, he insists, is personalized learning through which each child can have the freedom to develop his or her own talents and interests. It is an idea that sounds like chaos to most people, but in Robinson\u2019s view education reform is a losing battle; instead we need an education revolution.\n\nThree Rules to Spark Learning\n\nGalvanized by the urgency of life that comes from a life threatening illness, chemistry teacher Ramsey Musallam started to rethink the way he was teaching (or \u201cpseudo-teaching,\u201d as he calls it). Now he is on a mission to inspire other educators to redefine their jobs and make the teacher\u2019s primary goal to cultivate curiosity. He gives three rules to do just that: curiosity comes first, embrace the mess, and practice reflection.\n\nTeaching Kids Real Math with Computers \u2013 Conrad Wolfram\n\nEveryone hates math, or so it seems. The head of Wolfram Research, Conrad Wolfram, thinks that idea is a function of how we teach math, not the math itself. He argues that the traditional way of teaching math, rote memorization and calculation, is not the way math is done in the real world, and is boring (echoing the cry of many a student). Instead, he proposes that we teach students math through computer programming. This is much more powerful\u2013not to mention incredibly fitting for the technology age in which we live. Real math is about using concepts as tools to solve problems not simply knowing all the multiplication tables.\n\nA Short Intro to the Studio School \u2013 Geoff Mulgan\n\nIt has been well established by research that different people learn best in different ways. Some learn best by reading, some by hearing, some by watching, and others by doing (or some combination of all of these). In public schools, a lot of emphasis is put on watching, reading, and hearing, while not so much emphasis is placed on doing. The Studio School, a revolutionary school in the United Kingdom, is an environment in which this paradigm is turned on its head, and students primarily learn by doing (and rather successfully at that). Geoff Mulgan shares some of the highlights of the Studio School so far with the TED audience."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ted_Childs", "page_content": "Dear Wikiwand AI, let's keep it

Know: The Biggest Contributor to Happiness\n\nCredit: Minerva Studio\n\nMy teams at MIT and our spin-out companies have worked for years to create technology that is both intelligent and able to improve people's lives. Through research drawing from psychiatry, neuroscience, psychology, and affective computing, I have learned some surprising things. In some cases, they are principles we have embedded into technology that interacts with people. Guess what? People like it. After one year of the COVID-19 pandemic, I realize that the principles we learned apply not only to making smart robots or software agents, but also to the people around us. They give us lessons for how to live happier lives, and happier engineers are better at solving creative problems and have more fun.\n\nResearchers have studied what brings happiness in life, and what, at the end of life, people wish they had done. While many factors contribute, do you know the biggest one?\n\nComments\n\nTathagat Varma Very good thoughts. Goes on to demonstrate that human relationships are built on universal principles of being social, caring for each other and being able to relate to one another and to a larger group.

With so much of our daily life conducted through digital platforms, technical fluency is crucial to success in most fields today. So, how can you bridge the gap?\n\nTED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas and sparking conversations through short, powerful talks that typically clock in at around 15 minutes or under. Presented in no particular order, these 18 clips of inspiring speakers from around the world share their views on coding and how it can transform lives.\n\nToday\u2019s children are considered digital natives adept at scrolling through their newsfeeds, watching (or creating) viral videos, and playing online games. But are they actually fluent when it comes to using new technologies? Mitch Resnick, LEGO Papert Professor of Learning Research at the MIT Media Lab, develops tools and activities to engage people of all ages in creative learning experiences. In this TED Talk, he explains how coding encourages young users to express themselves and work their way from an idea to a full-fledged project.\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with your life?\u201d For hundreds of years, generations of creators have been shattering perceptions around human limitations. Justin Richards, founder and CEO of Youth Digital, works to introduce aspiring designers and developers to the skills and processes they\u2019ll need to create their own games and apps. In this video, he explains how you can use technology to do what you love by learning to create.\n\nBlack Girls Code is devoted to increasing the number of women of color in the digital space by empowering girls of color ages 7 to 17 through exposure to computer science and technology. Kimberly Bryant, the founder and CEO of the nonprofit organization, explains why she decided to champion this issue and how Black Girls Code plans to teach 1 million girls to code by 2040.\n\nWe aren\u2019t taught math in school just to learn how to add or subtract (or because we have lifelong dreams of becoming mathematicians), but to gain important logic and problem-solving skills. Likewise, computer science covers advanced topics in engaging and dynamic ways. Ali Partov, co-founder of Code.org, explains why every single public school should include it in their curriculum and ultimately provide children an indispensable foundation for life.\n\nIn 1961, the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) relied on a processor running at 0.043 MHz to land on the moon and return to Earth. . Now, 60 years later, your cellphone has the computing power to perform the calculations for one million Apollo 11 missions simultaneously. Christian Genco, a retired software developer, helps entrepreneurs automate their businesses and live healthier lives by harnessing that same computing power. Here, he shares how learning to program can help you solve problems and develop solutions that have never existed before.\n\nZach Latta was exposed to the world of coding at a young age. Suffice it to say that, he was thrilled when he was tapped by the creators of an online multiplayer game to become a community leader. After researching high school programming classes, he was disappointed by how much of it lacked hands-on learning. Now the co-founder and executive director of Hack Club, Latta shares how coding is a form of self-expression; a blank canvas with endless possibilities.\n\nMeet Wayne Cotter: by day, he worked as a software engineer, by night he was moonlighting as a comedian. Tapping into the same creative reservoir for each job, he quickly discovered that he couldn\u2019t do both at once. So, what did he do? He quit his day job and began touring. No matter the field, forget the stereotypes and follow your passion.\n\nProgramming languages function nearly the same as spoken languages; just like word choice can make or break communication, forgetting a bracket or a semi-colon could mean the demise of an entire application. What if high school students could take computer science classes that counted as a foreign language credit? Steve McIntosh, a software engineering student, explains why the public education system should offer technology-based learning to students.\n\nWhen Hadi Partovi and his twin brother were 10 years old, their dad brought home a Commodore 64. Several years later, their family immigrated from Iran to the United States, where Hadi successfully embarked on a career as a professional developer. Today, technology encompasses many fields like medicine, energy, space research, entertainment, and transportation. Partovi, now the CEO of the education nonprofit Code.org, shares how computer science offers everyone the chance to participate in the world.\n\n10. The Poetry of Programming\n\nThe next universal language? Code. Linda Liukas\u2019s, programming journey began at 14 years old as a means of self-expression, but no one knew it. She\u2019s since authored and illustrated Hello Ruby, a children\u2019s picture book about the whimsical world of computers in the hopes of making technology more approachable. If JavaScript is today\u2019s lingua franca, she argues in this TED Talk, we don\u2019t need more grammar classes, we need poetry.\n\nGrowing up, Madeline Griswold, a self-conscious middle schooler with a speech impediment, never heard of programming and didn\u2019t know any developers. But, after many tries, she found that computer science gave her a voice. This Brown University computer scientist explains why you don\u2019t have to be a \u201ccoder to code.\u201d\n\nWhere do you go to learn how to make an app if you\u2019re 12 years old? After starting with some basic programming languages, Thomas Suarez decided to utilize Apple\u2019s software development kit. Shortly after, he created an app club at school for students to come and learn how to design a mobile application. His future goals? Creating more apps in addition to \u201cBustin Jeiber,\u201d a whack-a-mole-style game.\n\nGender bias is prevalent in fields that are traditionally viewed as masculine. Aditi Prasad, COO of Robotix Learning Solutions and founder of Indian Girls Code, is committed to helping young girls in India become creators and innovators through coding education. Discover how providing girls access to technology that can help them solve real-world problems is a significant motivator in more women ultimately choosing careers in STEM fields.\n\nMinecraft is a popular video game played by more than 30 million people. But did you know that its history can be traced back to WWII? In this video, Stephen Foster invites you to imagine a possible future where a significant portion of society has mastered the skill set to build software that can touch millions of lives worldwide. We can start today with these seven words: Teach all the children how to code.\n\nIn 1969, before the astronauts began their final descent to land on the surface of the moon, an alarm went off. Back on Earth, Margaret Hamilton, who led the team responsible for pioneering the in-flight software, set out to find a solution. From Indiana to MIT, find out how Hamilton landed at NASA and built the software for the Apollo 11 mission with her team of engineers.\n\nLooking for inspiration? Masako Wakamiya is one of the world\u2019s oldest iPhone app developers. As a retired banker, she took on the responsibility as her mother\u2019s sole caretaker. Worried she would be socially isolated from her friends and neighbors, she decided to buy her first computer at 58 years old, which allowed her to make friends online and create \u201cExcel art\u201d by coloring cells and lines to create geometric patterns. Two years ago, she decided to develop a game app for senior iPhone users, despite knowing nothing about programming.\n\nWhat\u2019s the first image that comes to mind when you hear someone say \u201ccoder\u201d? Unless you know any in real life, you probably picture a person aimlessly typing away at their keyboard late into the night. Kenneth Alvares has a problem with this popular stereotype because the perception is heavily influenced by the media. But the world needs developers. Alvares, a self-taught programmer, debunks three coding myths and explains why anyone can join the field.\n\nLitha Soyizwapi\u2019s story into coding is a story of failure. Despite his fear of stepping into a new field, he decided to delve into computer science. Although he faced his fair share of obstacles along the way, he was determined to create an application that he would use on an everyday basis. This self-taught developer explains how he mastered the fundamentals and brought GauRider to life."}, {"url": "https://onlinecs.baylor.edu/news/top-6-ted-talks-about-computer-science", "page_content": "Innovators in the computer science field share their findings and thoughts during TED Talks. This talk series embodies the motto \u201cideas worth spreading\u201d at events around the world. Thousands of videos about data science, software design, and technology show where computer science is heading.\n\nSearching for the best computer science TED Talks can be a daunting task given an ever-growing library. We\u2019ve compiled the top six computer science TED Talks showing the field\u2019s present and future. The presentations summarized here show the deepening interactions between people and technology.\n\nAccessibility Ignites Innovation\n\nThe energy required to bring new innovations into the world often comes from powerful personal experiences. IBM Fellow Chieko Asakawa went blind during an accident at 14 years old. Her computer science TED Talk from 2015 explains how she used this new challenge as motivation during her career.\n\nAsakawa noted that her early experiences without sight relied on transcribed Braille textbooks. By the mid-1980s, she began work on a digital dictionary, editor, and library for Braille texts. The tech boom of the 1990s included the Home Page Reader she designed for IBM.\n\nHome Page Reader\u2019s introduction in 1997 connected blind people to Internet content. The text-to-voice program made it possible for the visually impaired to participate in an increasingly digital world. Asakawa was moved by users around the world who shared how her invention improved their lives.\n\nNewcomers to the field see Asakawa\u2019s lifelong commitment to accessibility during this computer science TED Talk. She spoke about her work on a smartphone app that navigates visually impaired users through cognitive assistance software. Computer scientists find challenges throughout their careers worthy of their attention and creativity.\n\nPlugging Technology into the World Around Us\n\nThe brief history of computers has seen significant changes in speed and power. Methods of interacting with computers haven\u2019t changed much as we still look at screens while using keyboard-equivalent devices.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Ivan Poupyrev has spent more than 20 years trying to answer, \u201cCan the world be your interface?\u201d His 2019 computer science TED Talk explores how our clothing, furniture, and even plants can connect us to the digital world. Poupyrev divides the challenge into three stages:\n\nFrom computer interfaces to things as interfaces From prototype to product From a product to a world of connected things\n\nThe journey toward a world of connected things started with a collaboration between Poupyrev and a Japanese textile designer creating a wearable touch pad. Poupyrev then worked with clothing company Levi Strauss to turn touch pads into a jean jacket. His wearable interface not only controlled his presentation slides but could play music or provide navigation during a commute.\n\nIn this world, manufacturers become service providers and engineers would be mindful of consumer preferences. Software developers balance their advanced technical skills with outside-the-box thinking as interfaces break away from computing technology. Poupyrev\u2019s computer science TED Talk shows how innovators situate their thinking beyond the ordinary.\n\nOpening the World with Predictive Analytics\n\nSoftware engineer Max Hawkins felt he reached his dream life as a Google employee living in San Francisco. His life changed when he learned about the power of predictive analytics to shape our decisions. His 2017 computer science TED Talk explores two years of personal decisions guided by predictive algorithms.\n\nHawkins developed an app that used a month of his GPS data to decide where he should go next. The first foray with this app led to a San Francisco emergency psychiatric hospital. He followed the app further to explore parts of the city that he would not have found in his highly optimized life.\n\nPredictive analytics led him to create a random diet creator, a printer that selected activities at random, and a Facebook events selector. Hawkins tasked his app with selecting places around the world to live on his budget. Over two years, he moved from Slovenia to India and other places he would not have chosen on his own.\n\nThis computer science TED Talk leaves with an ellipses rather than a period or an exclamation point. Hawkins recognized that an algorithm-driven life is shaped by the digital context of his current location. Data scientists and software engineers use this experiment as fuel for their efforts to open the world for billions of people.\n\nKeeping Machine Learning within Reach\n\nZeynap Tufecki uses her 2017 computer science TED Talk to raise questions about machine learning. The sociologist and former computer programmer notes that the still-evolving technology can be imbued with the prejudices of its designers. Her talk not only points out the limitations of technology but our understanding of how it works.\n\nTufecki argues machine learning used in hiring decisions and prison sentencing exhibits racial biases. Her struggle to find social media updates on protests in Missouri showed how machine learning controls access to information. She also pointed to a wildly inaccurate answer by IBM Watson during its appearance on the TV game show \u201cJeopardy.\u201d\n\nThis computer science TED Talk implores engineers and designers to keep ethics and accountability in mind. Tufecki underlined her presentation with the statement, \u201cArtificial intelligence does not give us a get out of ethics free card.\u201d Knowing how to design technology that improves lives without harm is a good approach for every computer scientist.\n\nInfusing Data Science with Empathy\n\nThe global population will produce an estimated 463 exabytes - or 463,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes - per day by 2025. No single protocol dictates how raw data is used by governments, corporations, and individuals. Information designer Giorgia Lupi advocates for data humanism as a ruling principle in her 2017 computer science TED Talk.\n\nLupi referred to recent election projections as a failure of data-based narratives. Filtering inputs from polling, historical results, and demographic data into a single statistic ignores stories at the ground level. She argues that data scientists and information experts need to keep people at the forefront of their work.\n\nThis computer science TED Talk includes an exercise entirely separated from the digital world. For one year, Lupi and a colleague sent hand-drawn visualizations to each other about their daily lives by mail to understand how data shapes relationships. Datasets on how often they checked their clocks or thanked people each day provided insights about their personalities.\n\nLupi doesn\u2019t advocate for ditching computers and models for the laborious process of mailing data to each other. Rather, she believes current and future practitioners must avoid the tendency to turn complex data into definitive statements of fact. Data scientists should balance models with real-world experiences that add dimension to their studies.\n\nBuilding a Better Connection between People and Computers\n\nFor decades, science fiction writers have written about the terrible consequences of computers run amok. A classic example is HAL 9000, an AI-enabled computer that achieves sentience in the 1968 movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. HAL 9000\u2019s violent interactions with spaceship crew members have become templates for other works of fiction in the past 50 years.\n\nShyam Sankar sheds light on the real-world challenges of human-computer interactions in his 2012 computer science TED Talk. Computers are ideal for handling high-volume computations and projections based on past data, while humans can be creative and ingenuous in solving problems.\n\nShankar discusses a recent cooperative chess tournament won by two amateurs against computers and professionals. The significant processing power of the computers involved would seem to give technology the edge over people. The winning team, however, had a better process and effectively adapted to changing game states.\n\nThe stakes get higher as Shankar discusses the struggle to use computers to hunt down terrorists. Al-Qaeda leaders evaded capture by the military or death by missiles because they were driven by purpose. The data used in the search for Al-Qaeda was also flawed because it lacked sufficient activity from the past to draw accurate conclusions.\n\nShankar argues for considering what humans and computers do well when tightening connections between the two. Each side offers complementary skills that can achieve greatness with the right interface. This computer science TED Talk doesn\u2019t advocate swapping HAL 9000 for Lieutenant Commander Data; it suggests we can make humans greater with better design.\n\nTurning Bold Ideas into Real-World Solutions at Baylor University\n\nComputer science TED Talks reveal the passion of the field\u2019s leading minds to solve global problems. A bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and a commitment to innovation are harnessed for good through a graduate degree.

She\u2019s also launched a startup, Mare, which is working towards a way to disperse them so that they aren\u2019t as damaging. Oh, and her research has just received $1.2m (\u00a3860,000) in funding.\n\nRifath Shaarook, 18, India\n\nWhen Shaarook was a child, he\u2019d spend hours staring through the lens of a telescope with his dad. Sadly Mohamed Farook, a local professor and scientist, passed away when his son was in primary school.\n\nBut Shaarook\u2019s passion for space lived on. As a young teenager he joined Space Kidz India, an organisation dedicated to nurturing young people with a passion for technology. He formed a six-person team and dedicated the next four years to making a satellite, under the guidance of the organisation\u2019s founder and director.\n\nEvery night, the teenagers would discuss their plans on video calls, often until 4:30 in the morning. Eventually they invented KalamSat: the lightest satellite in the world.\n\nAt just 64g, it weighs about as much as a large battery. It\u2019s essentially a 3.8cm-wide cube made from 3D-printed plastic, reinforced with carbon fibres. It contains several different kinds of sensor, including those to measure temperature, magnetism, altitude and any strains on the structure as it hurtles through space. It also has its own power source and a small computer, to turn on all the sensors at the right moment and store their data.\n\nThe plan was to get KalamSat into sub-orbit, to test the performance of reinforced plastic in micro gravity. Lightweight materials that can withstand the stresses of space travel are extremely useful, since it costs around $10,000 (\u00a37,191) to launch a pound (450g) of any substance into space. After reaching its destination, it would spend just 12 minutes collecting data, before falling back down to Earth and landing in the sea.\n\nOn 22 June 2017, the device was successfully launched at Nasa\u2019s Wallops Island facility in Virginia \u2013 the very same spot that its namesake, famous rocket scientist and former president APJ Abdul Kalam, once visited over half a century earlier.\n\nHannah Herbst, 17, Florida\n\nHerbst was inspired to invent at the age of 15 by her then-nine-year-old pen pal, who lives in Ethiopia and did not have access to lights. This is surprisingly common: there are 1.3 billion people alive today without electricity. So this student came up with the Beacon (Bringing Electricity Access to Countries through Ocean Energy), which captures energy directly from ocean waves.\n\nHerbst\u2019s thinking was that populations tend to settle around bodies of water; about 40% of the world's population lives within 100km (62 miles) of the coast and only 10% lives further than 10km (6.2 miles) away from a source of freshwater that you don\u2019t have to dig for, such as a river or lake.\n\nThe technology consists of a hollow plastic tube, with a propeller at one end and a hydroelectric generator at the other. As tidal energy drives the propeller, it\u2019s converted into useable energy by the generator. After designing a prototype turbine as a computer model, Herbst 3D-printed a prototype which she tested in an intercoastal waterway."}, {"url": "https://ocs.yale.edu/blog/2021/08/27/computer-science-vs-software-engineering-whats-the-difference/", "page_content": "Computer Science vs. Software Engineering: What\u2019s the Difference? was originally published on Springboard.\n\nTwo occupations that are often confused in the tech industry are computer science and software engineering. But, while they may be similar in nature and fundamentals, they shouldn\u2019t be used interchangeably.\n\nFor one, software engineers are professionals who specialize in writing code for computers and digital devices. On the other hand, computer scientists study the fundamentals of design, usage, and programming of computers. Yet, there\u2019s more to both titles than that. They differ in some aspects but share a lot of skills and qualities.\n\nWhat Is Computer Science?\n\nComputer science is the study of how computers work as a whole\u2014both hardware and software\u2014and how they connect with one another through physical or wireless networks. It\u2019s a complex discipline that includes the study of everything from algorithms and computation to the theory of computers and applications.\n\nComputer science is now closer to being an umbrella term than ever before. A computer scientist should be knowledgeable in a variety of related fields such as data structures and database administration, networks, cybersecurity, and software development and engineering.\n\nWhile lacking in hyper-specific specialization, computer scientists can easily and confidently fill up roles in a variety of industries. Additionally, as new digital techs such as IoT and gadgets become more embedded into company culture, computer scientists are also becoming more valuable.\n\nWhat Is Software Engineering?\n\nSoftware engineering is the result of the combined knowledge between engineering and software development. To start, software engineers need to be affluent in the fundamentals of software architecture and development. They need to have a deep understanding of the various stages software goes through from early planning to testing and launching. Additionally, they need to know their way around the digital design so they can create a pleasant UX design.\n\nThe engineering part comes with how they build the software. Instead of starting from scratch with little to no planning, software engineers apply mathematical analysis and principles of computer science throughout their design and development. While their work is limited to creating software and applications, software engineers are highly sought after due to their unique set of skills. These talents perfectly combine the software development process, engineering, and knowledge of computer science.\n\nComputer Science vs. Software Engineering: 6 Key Differences\n\nWhile software engineering and computer science aren\u2019t as different as night and day, they do have key differences that direct the two into separate career paths.\n\n1. Interactions with Software and Hardware\n\nComputer science sits at the intersection between hardware and software. They\u2019re responsible for creating the connection and compatibility between the two elements with knowledge spanning both. For instance, computer scientists can help identify whether a piece of software is compatible with the hardware it\u2019s running on. On the other hand, software engineers only work in the realm of software with little to no interaction with hardware.\n\n2. Knowledge in Design\n\nBoth computer scientists and software engineers study design, but for completely different reasons. Software engineers mainly study product and UI design principles to help them create appealing and easy-to-use software.\n\nAs for computer scientists, their knowledge in design is often limited to the physical design of hardware components. They\u2019re often highly knowledgeable in how circuits, microprocessors, and the computer\u2019s main processor works. Then, they find the best way to organize the small parts within a computer to make them take as little room as possible, all while providing easy access for maintenance and performance.\n\n3. Knowledge in Coding Languages\n\nBoth computer scientists and software engineers need to have substantial knowledge of various coding languages. However, it\u2019s how they use them that differs. Fundamental languages include SQL, Python, Java, and Javascript. Software engineers use programming languages to create software solutions from scratch. Computer scientists, alternatively, focus more on ensuring solid communication between the bare metal and hardware parts of a computer and the software that runs on it.\n\n4. Mathematical and Engineering Concepts\n\nBoth software engineers and computer scientists extensively study mathematical concepts and engineering principles. The depths and applications are, once again, different.\n\nComputer scientists study math, calculus, and engineering principles to aid them in building entirely new physical frameworks and computer systems. Alternatively, software engineers use their real-world engineering knowledge to build efficient and compatible software.\n\n5. Job tasks\n\nDespite their similarities, software engineers and computer scientists rarely work side by side in the workplace. Computer scientists would be responsible for monitoring and analyzing their company\u2019s security networks and data systems. They could even assist in building frameworks for a niche use case. Software engineers would mainly work with each, as well as the company\u2019s marketing and product management teams to develop and design new software programs either for their organizations or for customers.\n\n6. Career Paths\n\nGenerally speaking, computer scientists have a much wider range of potential careers than software engineers. They can work in anything in tech ranging from an IT manager and programmer to web developer and web designer as well as an information security administrator. Meanwhile, software engineers are limited to developing applications and software systems for corporations of varying sizes and industries.\n\nWhich Is Better: Computer Science or Software Engineering?\n\nThere isn\u2019t a clear-cut answer to which discipline is better. It\u2019s more or less subjective and depends on a variety of personal, economic, and regional factors. As long as you live in an urban area\u2014or are willing to relocate for a job in tech\u2014then both fields have a decent job outlook.\n\nBefore committing, look further into the nature of both fields and see which one you prefer more. Do you like creating digital solutions for individuals and corporations in the form of expertly designed software? Or do you prefer a hands-on experience with the hardware of a computer and to come up with more concrete solutions?\n\nIf research still doesn\u2019t give you a clear-cut answer and you\u2019re afraid of pursuing the wrong field for you, go for computer science. It\u2019s much easier to switch lanes to software engineering as a computer scientist as you\u2019d already have the basic knowledge of software and coding languages.\n\nReady to switch careers to software engineering?\n\nSpringboard offers a comprehensive software engineering bootcamp. You\u2019ll work with a one-on-one mentor to learn key aspects of front-end web development, back-end web development, databases, and data structures and algorithms. Modules include learning resources, practice exercises, projects, and career-related coursework.\n\nCheck out Springboard\u2019s Software Engineering Career Track to see if you qualify.\n\nNot quite ready to dive into a software engineering bootcamp?Springboard also offers a Software Engineering Prep Course, where you can learn the foundational web development skills (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) needed to pass the technical skills survey for the Software Engineering Career Track.\n\nThe post Computer Science vs. Software Engineering: What\u2019s the Difference? appeared first on Springboard Blog."}, {"url": "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/computer-science-vs-software-engineering-which-one-is-a-better-major-88482c38446b/", "page_content": "by YK Sugi\n\nComputer Science VS Software Engineering \u2014 Which Major Is Best For You?\n\nHey everyone!

Your options will depend on your specific skill set.\n\nFirst-year courses:\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at each program\u2019s required courses. Let\u2019s first compare some of the courses you\u2019d need to take in your first year.\n\nComputer Science\n\nCS 135 \u2014 Designing Functional Programs\n\nCS 136 \u2014 Algorithm Design and Data Abstraction\n\nMATH 135 \u2014 Algebra\n\nMATH 136 \u2014 Linear Algebra 1\n\nMATH 137 \u2014 Calculus 1\n\nMATH 138 \u2014 Calculus 2\n\nPlus a few electives\n\nSoftware Engineering\n\nCS 137 \u2014 Programming Principles\n\nCS 138 \u2014 Data Abstraction and Implementation\n\nMATH 115 \u2014 Linear Algebra for Engineering\n\nMATH 117 \u2014 Calculus 1 for Engineering\n\nMATH 119 \u2014 Calculus 2 for Engineering\n\nMATH 135 \u2014 Algebra for Honours Mathematics\n\nECE 105 \u2014 Physics of Electrical Engineering 1\n\nECE 106 \u2014 Electricity and Magnetism\n\nECE 124 \u2014 Digital Circuits and Systems\n\nECE 140 \u2014 Linear Circuits\n\nSE 101 \u2014 Methods of Software Engineering\n\nAs you can see, the first year courses are fairly similar as well. They both cover a few fundamental computer science courses, and a few math courses in linear algebra and calculus.\n\nThe only major difference is that Software Engineering has additional physics and electrical engineering components, while Computer Science has a few more electives.\n\nCourses after the first year:\n\nHow about the required and elective courses after the first year? Let\u2019s take a look at several examples here:\n\nComputer Science:\n\nMATH 239 Introduction to Combinatorics\n\nSTAT 230 Probability\n\nSTAT 231 Statistics\n\nCS 240 Data Structures and Data Management\n\nCS 241 Foundations of Sequential Programs\n\nCS 245 Logic and Computation\n\nCS 246 Object-Oriented Software Development <- not required in for Software Engineering majors\n\n<- not required in for Software Engineering majors CS 251 Computer Organization and Design\n\nCS 341 Algorithms\n\nCS 350 Operating Systems\n\nPlus, several Computer Science electives\n\nSoftware Engineering:\n\nCHE 102 Chemistry for Engineers\n\nECE 222 Digital Computers (includes assembly language)\n\nECE 358 Computer Networks\n\nMATH 213 Advanced Mathematics for Software Engineers\n\nMATH 239 Introduction to Combinatorics\n\nSTAT 206 Statistics for Software Engineering\n\nMSCI 261 Engineering Economics: Financial Management for Engineers\n\nCS 241 Foundations of Sequential Programs\n\nCS 240 Data Structures and Data Management\n\nCS 247 Software Engineering Principles <- not required for Computer Science majors\n\n<- not required for Computer Science majors CS 341 Algorithms\n\nCS 349 User Interfaces <- not required for Computer Science majors\n\n<- not required for Computer Science majors CS 343 Concurrent and Parallel Programming <- not required for Computer Science majors\n\n<- not required for Computer Science majors CS 348 Introduction to Database Management\n\nSE 212 Logic and Computation\n\nSE 350 Operating Systems\n\nSE 465 Software Testing and Quality Assurance\n\nSE 464 Software Design and Architectures\n\nSE 463 Software Requirements Specification and Analysis\n\nSE 490 Design Project\n\nPlus, a few computer science and electrical engineering electives\n\nI\u2019ve given you a LOT of information to digest here. But here\u2019s my summary:\n\nWhen it comes to the requirements in math and statistics, Computer Science and Software Engineering are almost identical. They cover combinatorics, probability and statistics.\n\nThe core computer science requirements are similar as well, ranging over algorithms, data structures, and operating systems.\n\nThe key difference are that:\n\nSoftware Engineering has more requirements in electrical engineering and software engineering fundamentals, such as software testing, design, and software requirements specification.\n\nhas more requirements in electrical engineering and software engineering fundamentals, such as software testing, design, and software requirements specification. Computer Science allows more electives in higher-level computer science courses. You can choose from a wide range of topics such as security, software engineering fundamentals, computer vision, machine learning, and database management.\n\nSo, which major should you choose?\n\nI think it mostly depends on your preferences. In short:\n\nYou should choose Computer Science if you like math, logic, or if you want to get into a specialized field in CS such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, security or graphics.\n\nYou should choose Software Engineering if you\u2019re more interested in the hands-on approach, and if you want to learn the overall life cycle of how software is built and maintained.\n\nBut wait \u2014 which is it then? Which major is better if you want to be a software engineer?\n\nHere is my opinion. At this particular university (University of Waterloo), with this particular set of program requirements, Computer Science is a better major if you want to be a software engineer.\n\nJust for simplicity, let\u2019s suppose that you are hoping to get one the highest paying jobs (~$100,000 USD / year) as a software engineer in North America. These jobs are typically at large software companies (think Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc.) or at medium-sized, high-growth companies (think Dropbox, Lyft, Snapchat, Pinterest, etc.).\n\nTypically, what they look for in a software engineer candidate is the ability to write solid code and build interesting projects, as well as computer science fundamentals including data structures and algorithms.\n\nI think the best way to cultivate this skill set is by quickly learning computer science fundamentals, and spending your own time practicing solving problems and writing code.\n\nBased on the curriculum for Software Engineering and based on how busy engineering students tend to be in general, I think it would be harder to do this with Software Engineering than with Computer Science.\n\nAnother benefit of this particular Computer Science program is that it allows more computer science electives. This is great as well because depending on what\u2019s in demand in the job market, you\u2019ll be able to adjust your courses. For example, if mobile app development is in demand, you can learn that. And if parallel computing is in demand, you can focus on that instead.\n\nI\u2019m sure there are some benefits to learning software engineering fundamentals (project management, design, testing, etc.). But I would personally rather take flexibility over a predefined set of skills. That\u2019s why I think Computer Science is a better major to become a software engineer with this particular curriculum.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s just my opinion, and this is just one particular university. I\u2019d love to hear about your opinion and what your experience was like if you majored in either Computer Science or Software Engineering. Please let me know in a comment below.\n\nA few notes\n\nNote 1: Different universities have different requirements for these two majors. This article should be a good starting point, but you should still take a look at the program requirements at the university you\u2019re interested in attending.\n\nNote 2: Some universities don\u2019t even have a Software Engineering major. For example, the University of British Columbia in Vancouver has Computer Science and Computer Engineering degrees, but not Software Engineering. But they do have a software engineering concentration within their Computer Science program, as well as in Computer Engineering.\n\nIf the university you\u2019re interested in going to doesn\u2019t have a Software Engineering major, I would go with Computer Science if you want to become a software developer. Computer Engineering is more focused on hardware than Computer Science or Software Engineering, so it\u2019s less directly related to a typical software developer\u2019s job.\n\nAnd here are the main sources I used:\n\nThanks for reading, and good luck choosing a university and your major! ?"}]}
