{"Geoff Griffin was born on 28 August 1965.": [{"url": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/geoff-griffin-dies-aged-67-268860", "page_content": "Geoff Griffin, the former South African pace bowler who was effectively no-balled out of Test cricket, has died in Durban aged 67\n\n\n\n\n\nGeoff Griffin in action during the 1960 tour of England which was the start and end of his international career \u00a9 Cricketer International\n\nGeoff Griffin, the former South African pace bowler, has died in Durban aged 67. Geoff Griffin, the former South African pace bowler, has died in Durban aged 67.\n\nAlthough he played two Tests and was the first South African to take a hat-trick in a Test, Griffin will best be remembered as the man who was no-balled out of international cricket at Lord's in 1960.\n\nA tall, blond, quick bowler who topped the national averages during the 1959-60 domestic season with 35 wickets at 12.23, his action had been the subject of debate from the moment the South Africans landed. In his defence, he had suffered an accident as a schoolboy which meant he couldn't straighten his arm, but he was playing at a time that there was considerable debate over suspect actions, mainly of Australian fast bowlers.\n\nNo-balled in warm-up matches, he underwent remedial work at Alf Gover's famous indoor school before returning to action, but a number of people were not satisfied.\n\nAt Lord's he took a hat-trick, the first by a South African, but that was completely overshadowed by him being repeatedly no-balled. His career was almost finished when, in an exhibition match played as the Test ended early, he was again called for throwing. Attempting to finish an over by bowling underarm, he was then rather cruelly called for not informing the umpire of a change of action. \"We didn't take the warning seriously,\" he was to recall many years later. \"It sounded so preposterous to use an exhibition match to do the dirty on me. He remained on the tour playing as a specialist batsman.\"\n\nA good-natured and popular player, he was widely praised for the way he took this massive setback. Griffin was contacted by a lawyer who offered to take the matter to court, free of charge. \"You'll win hands down and end up a wealthy young man,\" he said. But he declined. \"I loved cricket too much to sully the great game further.\"\n\nMany felt that the relatively unknown Griffin had been singled out by the authorities, who were desperate to send a message to the world that chuckers would not be tolerated. The fear was that a major row would erupt if Australia brought their batch of suspect bowlers in 1961, and so Griffin was used to show that umpires were prepared, if necessary, to act. If so, it worked. Australia omitted all their fast bowlers whose actions had caused such rancour in 1958-59.\n\n\"I was the victim of a thoroughly distasteful 'chucking' conspiracy,\" Griffin said earlier this year. \"I was the fall guy. I attribute the blame to the SA cricket authorities and the MCC who should never have allowed things to develop as they did.\"\n\nHe returned home and moved from Natal to Rhodesia, but within two years - and still only 23 years old - his career was over after he was repeatedly no-balled against North-Eastern Transvaal at Salisbury."}, {"url": "https://kids.kiddle.co/Geoff_Griffin", "page_content": "Geoffrey Merton Griffin (12 June 1939 \u2013 16 November 2006) was a Test cricketer who toured England with the South African cricket team in 1960, appearing in two Test matches. A right-arm, fast bowler and lower order batsman, his selection for the tour was controversial, because of his suspect bowling action \u2013 some of his deliveries were judged to be thrown rather than bowled. The core of his problem was that, due to a childhood accident, he was unable to fully straighten his right arm.\n\nDuring the 1960 tour he was no-balled for throwing in several matches prior to the Test series, but retained his place in the side nevertheless. In his second Test appearance, at Lord's in June 1960, he became the first South African cricketer to take a hat-trick in a Test match, and also the first cricketer of any nationality to do this at Lord's. In the same match, however, he was no-balled for throwing eleven times, and again in an exhibition match that followed the match's early conclusion. These events ended his international career, and after fruitless attempts to resolve his problem, he retired from cricket in 1963, at the age of 23.\n\nGriffin was unfortunate to emerge on the international scene at a time when cricketing authorities were particularly concerned about the growing proliferation of bowlers with dubious actions and were determined to eradicate it. He, along with others, was convinced that he had been made a scapegoat to ensure that certain bowlers would be omitted from the Australian side due to tour England in 1961. After 1960 the throwing controversy largely subsided as an issue in international cricket.\n\nLife\n\nEarly life and cricket career\n\nGriffin was born in Graytown, Natal, on 12 June 1939. He received his education at Durban High School, where he excelled at many sports: cricket, athletics (he held provincial titles for high jump, triple jump and pole vault), and Rugby football (in which he played for the provincial under-19 XV). After leaving school he made his debut for Natal's Cricket XI in the 1957\u201358 season, and played regularly in 1958\u201359. In 1959\u201360 he returned bowling figures for the season of 35 wickets for an average of 12.23, heading the national bowling averages. His figures included 7 wickets for 11 runs in the extraordinary Currie Cup match at East London on 19\u201321 December 1959, in which Natal dismissed Border for 16 and 18. These performances were significant, because a Test tour of England was scheduled for 1960, and South Africa were looking for a partner for their star fast bowler Neil Adcock. Griffin was duly selected, at 20 the team's youngest player.\n\nThese early successes with Natal were, however, marked with a degree of controversy about Griffin's bowling action. As the result of an accident when a schoolboy, he could not fully straighten his right (bowling) arm; he experienced problems with his action while at school, and was twice no-balled for throwing during the 1958\u201359 season while bowling for Natal, although he escaped censure in the 1959\u201360 season. According to Griffin's Wisden obituarist many years later, his bent arm \"allied to an open-chested action, with front foot splayed towards gully, made him look more like a baseball pitcher than a conventional bowler\". John Waite, Griffin's future Test colleague, batting for Transvaal against Natal in 1958\u201359, says he informed the umpire that Griffin was throwing. The umpire replied: \"You concentrate on batting, and leave the umpiring to me.\"\n\nIt was Griffin's misfortune that his emergence as a possible Test bowler occurred at a time when the matter of illegal bowling was an issue of considerable and rising concern among cricket's international authorities. Incidents in a recent England tour to Australia had brought the issue to the fore; South Africa were, therefore taking some risk in selecting Griffin.\n\nSouth African tour of England, 1960\n\nEarly matches\n\nGriffin's first match of the 1960 tour was against Derbyshire, on 7\u201310 May. During this game the umpire Paul Gibb called the Derbyshire fast bowler Harold Rhodes six times for throwing, but Griffin remained unmolested. He took three wickets in his side's easy victory. In his next county game, against Essex, on 14\u201317 May, Griffin again escaped attention from the umpires, but members of the media, including the writer and former Test bowler Ian Peebles, wrote that \"there was something amiss\". The following week, in the match against the MCC at Lord's on 21\u201324 May, Griffin was called for throwing by both umpires, John Langridge and Frank Lee, the first member of any touring side to be thus called. When, a few days later, he was called again in the match against Nottinghamshire, it was clear that some action needed to be taken.\n\nThe immediate step was to send Griffin to the indoor cricket school run by the former England bowler Alf Gover, in Wandsworth. This treatment seemed to help, but at the same time to reduce Griffin's effectiveness. He returned to the side, and was duly selected to play in the First Test, at Birmingham, on 9\u201314 June. Langridge was one of the umpires, but the match passed without official incident, Griffin taking two wickets in each of England's innings in a game comprehensively lost by the tourists. However, a week later in Southampton, in the match against Hampshire, Griffin was called again, so his inclusion in the South African side for the Second Test at Lord's, on 23\u201327 June, was something of a risk.\n\nLord's Test, 23\u201327 June, and after\n\nAt Lord's, England batted first and scored 362. The match provided mixed fortunes for the beleaguered bowler. In the third over of the innings, Griffin was no-balled by umpire Frank Lee, and ten further times by the same umpire, before the innings closed in sensational fashion. In three successive balls, Griffin had Mike Smith caught behind for 99, Peter Walker bowled for 52, and Fred Trueman bowled for 0, to record the first-ever hat-trick in a Test at Lords. South Africa were then twice bowled out cheaply, the match ending with their defeat early on the afternoon of Monday 26 June. Because a visit from the Queen was scheduled for later that afternoon, to fill the available time the teams agreed to play an exhibition match of 20 overs per side.\n\nIn the exhibition match, despite its informal nature, the umpires Lee and Syd Buller chose to apply the Laws of cricket strictly. Bowling at half-pace from a shortened run, Griffin was no-balled by Buller for throwing on four occasions. When the South African captain, Jackie McGlew, remonstrated, Buller replied: \"We are playing to the Laws, which I must abide by\". Griffin was allowed to finish the over by bowling underarm, but was then pedantically no-balled again by Lee, standing at square leg, for failing to notify him of the change of action. These events provoked both great sympathy for the player and contempt for the authorities. The South African writer Louis Duffus challenged Buller's intransigency concerning the Laws; the exhibition match, he said, was being played outside the \"strict tenets of play\", because of the arrangement that every player was required to bowl. McGlew later wrote: \"My own feeling at that moment was that cricket, its laws and their application, had been reduced to complete and utter farce.\" There was general anger that the South African management had exposed Griffin to the Lord's Test, given the high likelihood of an incident; the management's response was to blame the press for stirring up the trouble.\n\nSubsequent matches\n\nThe events at Lord's finished Griffin as a bowler on the tour. He remained with the team, and played in a number of subsequent matches as a specialist batsman, generally in the lower order, but on a couple of occasions as an opener. He made a few useful scores, including 65 not out against Lancashire in his next match after the Lord's Test, and 37 in the final match of the tour, against T.N. Pearce's XI at the Scarborough Festival in September.\n\nGriffin was praised in The Cricketer magazine for \"the superb manner in which he has taken [his] misfortune\". A final attempt to analyse and perhaps correct his bowling action was made in the nets at Lord's, during the tourists' match against Middlesex in mid-July. In front of Bradman and McGlew, he bowled wearing a specially-designed surgical brace on his arm, but the experiment came to nothing.\n\nLate career, retirement, later life\n\nAfter the tour, Griffin was approached by a lawyer who offered to bring the issue to court, assuring the bowler that he would win if he brought a case against the authorities, but Griffin declined, not wishing, he said, \"to sully the great game further\". He returned to South Africa, and attempted to revive his cricket career there. He moved from Natal to Rhodesia, and played a few times for his new state, but this ended after he was repeatedly no-balled in a match at Salisbury, against North-Eastern Transvaal, in 1962\u201363. At the age of 23 he retired from first-class cricket. He continued his involvement with the game at club level and as a coach, while pursuing a new career in hotel management.\n\nGriffin died on 16 November 2006 at the age of 67, after collapsing while attending a dinner held at his old school, Durban High. In all first-class cricket he played 42 matches, taking 108 wickets for 2324 runs, averaging 21.51. With the bat he scored 895 runs, av. 17.90, with a highest score of 73. He held 19 catches. In his two Tests he took 8 wickets, averaging 24.00, and scored 25 runs, av. 6.25.\n\nAftermath\n\nNot everyone was convinced that Griffin threw rather than bowled the ball. The former England batsman Denis Compton wrote: \"I am sure the umpires have been too severe on this boy. Certainly he has a bent elbow, but he cannot straighten it because of physical disability. I have seen bowlers with far more suspect actions get away with it. And I will say definitely that Griffin does not throw\". Against this, the South African commentator Charles Fortune was convinced that Griffin threw, as were his team-mates Waite and Adcock. Fortune questioned the wisdom of the selectors in sending Griffin to England: \"they chanced their arm\", he wrote. The England batsman Peter Walker, who played at Lord's, was unequivocal: \"There was absolutely no doubt in either Mike [Smith]'s or my mind that he threw virtually every ball\".\n\nSome believed that Griffin had been deliberately scapegoated, as part of a conspiracy to ensure that Australia's suspect bowlers were excluded from the forthcoming 1961 tour of England. In support of the conspiracy theory the journalist Martin Chandler, in his analysis of the throwing controversy, writes that umpire Lee may have been instructed by Allen, during a rain break in England's innings in the Lord's Test, to take a firmer line against Griffin, who had largely escaped attention in the match at that point in time, but was afterwards called on six occasions in rapid succession. According to Griffin's later account, after the match Bradman came to the tourists' dressing room to offer sympathy, and claimed that Allen had ordered Buller to \"call Griffin out of the game\". Griffin asserted: \"I was the victim of a thoroughly distasteful 'chucking' conspiracy. I was the fall guy. I attribute the blame to the SA cricket authorities and the MCC who should never have allowed things to develop as they did\".\n\nIn the event, none of Australia's suspect quartet was selected for the 1961 tour. Burke retired from Test cricket after the 1958\u201359 series; Slater did not add to the one cap he gained during that series, and Rorke's international career had ended by December 1959. Meckiff played on until December 1963, when he was no-balled four times by the umpire Colin Egar during the first Test of a series against South Africa. He then retired from all forms of the game. In cricket generally, the throwing controversy rumbled on in low-key fashion, but did not re-emerge in Tests until 1995, when the Sri Lankan bowler Muttiah Muralitharan was no-balled for throwing seven times in Melbourne. Analysis through modern technology, however, demonstrated that every bowler, on delivery of the ball, flexed his arm to some extent, and the Laws were changed to reflect this; a 15-degree elbow bend was thenceforth permitted. Had this rule been applied in Griffin's day, it might have saved him."}, {"url": "https://infofamouspeople.com/famous/geoff-griffin.htm", "page_content": "Geoff Griffin's About \u270e]\n\nGeoff Griffin was born on June 12, 1939 (age 67) in South Africa.

Geoff Griffin maintained to the end of his days that he was the victim of a thoroughly distasteful chucking conspiracy. Like that of McCarthy Griffin\u2019s cricket career did not last very long, and again in common with his predecessor he was undoubtedly treated badly. There was however one big difference between the two, in that unlike McCarthy Griffin almost certainly did throw.\n\nWhy should there have been a conspiracy is the first question that needs to be looked at. The flippant response to that is to point to conspiracy theories emerging in most situations of great controversy, but to be fair to Griffin when the ground opened up before him the game, in England at least, needed a scapegoat.\n\nA 19 year old Griffin had made his First Class debut in the 1957/58 season without tearing up any trees. His second campaign was much better and, at the same time, Peter May\u2019s England were touring Australia. Having started the season as favourites to retain The Ashes England had been soundly beaten, and blamed the defeat on the quartet who inspired Jack Fingleton to title his book on the series Four Chukkas to Australia. The alleged offenders were Ian Meckiff, Gordon Rorke, Keith Slater and Jim Burke.\n\nThe next Ashes series was due to be played in England in 1961, and the authorities did not want Australia bringing with them a group of illegal bowlers thus, so Griffin\u2019s argument would go, they resolved to adopt a zero tolerance attitude against South Africa in 1960. The reasoning was that by making it clear to Australia that, unlike on their own soil, offenders would be ruthlessly exposed, the selectors would be dissuaded from picking those with suspect actions. At this time the four mentioned in the preceding paragraph were by no means the only offenders in the Australian game.\n\nReturning to the 1958/59 South African domestic season it should not be forgotten that during that season Griffin was called for throwing twice by his own umpires. Des Fell called him in the match between Natal and Transvaal, and a couple of weeks later in an end of season trial Arthur Kidson called him as well.\n\nAnother Kidson, Hayward, as far as I can see unrelated to Arthur, was a South African umpire who went on to be one of that nation\u2019s very best and who later wrote an autobiography. Prior to the selection of the 1960 touring party Hayward Kidson had never stood in a game in which Griffin played. But in making that point he did add a telling observation; Bearing in mind the lack of a suitable definition, I would most likely have gone along with the majority of umpires in this country and done nothing anyway. Men more senior than I had passed him, but there were warnings which the South African Board should perhaps not have ignored.\n\nThe side to tour England was to be selected at the end of the 1959/60 domestic season and if the Board were in any way reluctant to select him Griffin spent the summer piling on the pressure. He ended the campaign with the remarkable tally of 35 wickets at 12.22, including 7-11 in the second innings of a bizarre match in which Border were dismissed for 16 and 18. The Board could not ignore form like that, so Griffin was picked. It should also be borne in mind that throughout that momentous season no umpire called him. He didn\u2019t encounter Arthur Kidson, but Fell was not troubled by Griffin\u2019s action in the 41 overs he bowled in a match against Rhodesia.\n\nLike a number of bowlers, Muttiah Muralitharan the foremost of them, Griffin did start out with a \u201cproblem\u201d, in that as a result of a bad break to his right arm in a childhood accident he could not straighten his elbow fully. Thus any square leg umpire would see a bent arm throughout his delivery. There was another factor with Griffin that exacerbated his difficulties. He had the classic open chested action of the thrower, with a front foot splayed outwards at the point of delivery.\n\nGriffin was left out of the side for the tour\u2019s opening First Class fixture against Worcestershire. There was some speculation that the identity of the umpires dictated that decision. One was a known hardliner, Syd Buller, and the other, Jack Crapp, had recently called Worcestershire\u2019s John Aldridge. To add fuel to that particular theory Aldridge was rested by the home side.\n\nThe South Africans next outing was against Derbyshire. Paul Gibb was not afraid to call a throw a throw but Griffin couldn\u2019t be hidden forever so he played. There were six calls from Gibb at square leg, but none of them directed at Griffin who seemed to satisfy most of the travelling press pack that his action was fair. The man called on this occasion, wholly unjustly in this writer\u2019s opinion, was Derbyshire\u2019s Harold Rhodes.\n\nThe next appearance against a county for Griffin was the game against Essex. This time the press did get on his case although the umpires did not. One newspaper, The People, was particularly trenchant in its criticism of Griffin\u2019s \u201cjerk\u201d. The only problem with that argument however was that on an experimental basis the word jerk had been removed from what was then Law 26 for the 1960 season.\n\nNearly all cricketers reminisce fondly about their first appearance at Lord\u2019s, although it was not to prove a happy hunting ground for Geoff Griffin after he was selected to play against the MCC in late May. The day was cold and damp and the start of play, before a disappointing crowd, was considerably delayed. Skipper Jackie McGlew won the toss and invited the home side to bat. There were four uneventful overs from Griffin. His fifth began with a call from John Langridge for dragging, and then half way through the over Frank Lee crossed to point. He immediately called Griffin. It was the first time a visiting cricketer had ever been called for throwing in England. McGlew immediately took his man out of the attack.\n\nShortly before tea Griffin was reintroduced to the attack from the other end. He then guaranteed his place at the forefront of the next day\u2019s Sunday Newspapers by being called by both umpires for the same delivery, by Lee for dragging and John Langridge for throwing. Langridge must have seen something different, because he had allowed Griffin to bowl unhindered in the game against Essex. Langridge called him again later in the game. One of the complaints that Griffin had, supported by many irrespective of their views on his basic action, was that all his deliveries were identical. Thus it should have been a case of all or nothing. Either everything he bowled was a no ball, or all were legal deliveries.\n\nThere was a meeting after the MCC match attended by South African manager Dudley Nourse, the umpires and MCC representatives. Nourse made a statement afterwards to the effect that he was entirely happy with the outcome of the meeting and that he believed that from then on English umpires would not have any further difficulty with Griffin. The press were critical and accused the MCC of condoning throwing. It may be that adverse reaction influenced what happened next, but Nourse\u2019s view proved to be well wide of the mark. Griffin was left out of the next game at Northampton, but was selected to play against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. He was called five times for throwing in the first innings, and three times in the second innings.\n\nIt was clear that by the end of the game Griffin, still not yet 21 and the baby of the South African team had, unsurprisingly, lost his direction and much of his pace. One thing he had however done, on McGlew\u2019s instructions, was bowled his fastest delivery immediately after being called. For many with dubious actions it is their quicker ball that offends. As all of Griffin\u2019s fastest got past the umpires that is something else that distinguishes his case from those of others who, at first glance, might appear similar.\n\nVery sensibly in the circumstances Griffin was packed off to Alf Gover\u2019s indoor school for help in sorting out his action. Gover thought the basic action was fine, and sought to modify it in such a way that at the point of delivery Griffin was in a position where he couldn\u2019t throw. He was back to join his teammates for the game against Glamorgan in which he bowled 18 overs without falling foul of the umpires. South African journalist Charles Fortune described his action as distinctly smoother.\n\nThe first Test followed the Glamorgan encounter and, in a 100 run defeat, Griffin took four wickets altogether and once more avoided censure. Langridge was one of the umpires on duty so, presumably, he too saw a difference. The second Test was, as usual, to be played at Lord\u2019s. In the meantime there were two more county games, against Somerset at Taunton and Hampshire at Southampton.\n\nThere was no Griffin at Taunton, but he did play at Southampton and, if he thought his troubles were over he was to be sorely disappointed. He was called once each by Jim Parks Snr and Harry Elliott in the first innings, and three times by Parks in the second innings as well as once more by Elliott. He had now been called by six different umpires and the South Africans had a difficult decision to make about whether he should be selected for the Lord\u2019s Test. The battle of wills was primarily between Nourse and Gubby Allen, the man who wanted to use Griffin as a stick with which to beat the Australian selectors.\n\nThe simple truth was that without Griffin there was no adequate foil for the South African spearhead Neil Adcock. So Griffin played at Lord\u2019s and South Africa bowled first. Griffin\u2019s first over was uneventful, and in the second he claimed the prized scalp of Colin Cowdrey. Just as he must have started to feel better about himself he then heard Lee call him twice from square leg in his third over. Never before had a bowler been called for throwing in a Test in England. At the close of a truncated day\u2019s play England were 114-2, and Griffin had been called five times altogether.\n\nPlay began on time next morning and England moved serenely on to 210-3 by lunch, losing only Kenny Barrington to Trevor Goddard\u2019s miserly left arm medium pace. Griffin did his share of bowling, and was not called at all, umpire Lee seeming to take less and less interest in him as the session wore on. His interest did however rise considerably after lunch when the new ball was taken and there were two more calls in Griffin\u2019s very first over with it.\n\nThis is another basis for the conspiracy theory. As ever there was nothing different about the way that Griffin bowled after lunch, other than having a new cherry in his hand, but there was a very substantial change in the way that Lee went about his duties. It is difficult to dismiss the idea that Allen had had words with him during the interval. There was a rain break during the afternoon session, and after it Lee called Griffin twice more. By 6.15 pm in the final session Griffin had been called six times in all by Lee for throwing and once by Buller for dragging. He had not taken a wicket all day and when, with England cruising as 347-5, Mike Smith on 99 edged the last ball of an over into the gloves of \u2018keeper John Waite most of the crowd did not know whether to feel sympathy for Smith or delight that the young bowler had finally got something to take from the game.\n\nThere was however much more for Griffin. With the first delivery of his next over he got through Peter Walker\u2019s defences and just clipped the bails. The new batsman was Fred Trueman and his reaction to the hat trick delivery was to take a mighty swing at it and lose his leg stump. It was the first ever Test hat trick at Lord\u2019s and the first by a South African anywhere. The crowd rose to applaud a young man they were growing to like. England reached the close at 362-8 and at that point Cowdrey declared. There was little play on the Saturday, which saw South Africa move to 34-1 in reply, but they then collapsed twice on the fourth day to lose by an innings before mid-afternoon. This committed the two sides to playing an exhibition match as a royal visit was due later so there had to be some cricket in play. The game involved no more than 20 overs per side and two overs per bowler, so it was a game that\u2019s only purpose was to entertain the crowd.\n\nEngland batted first and Griffin took the second over. For the first time on the tour Buller was at square leg for Griffin. The youngster ran in off five yards to deliver the first of his dozen deliveries. For the second Buller crossed to point and then back again to square leg for the third. He called that as well as the next two despite Griffin having cut his \u201crun up\u201d down to a couple of paces and the delivery itself to a gentle loosener. There was a discussion between McGlew and Buller as a result of which McGlew instructed Griffin, following an indication from Buller that it would be the only way he could complete the over, to bowl underarm. Even then Lee chose to no ball the first such delivery on the basis that Griffin, unsurprisingly, had forgotten to inform the batsman he would be changing his mode of delivery. With commendable restraint McGlew wrote later; My own feeling at that moment was that cricket, its laws and their application, had been reduced to complete and utter farce. Former England and Middlesex leg spinner turned writer Ian Peebles, who published an interesting book on the throwing controversy a few years later, said of the episode, this was the saddest moment I have ever experienced in cricket.\n\nFollowing that particular debacle there was to be no more bowling for Griffin on the tour. He played occasionally as a batsman, and indeed in his first game in that role he scored an unbeaten 65 against Lancashire, but that effort apart there were not too many more runs for him.\n\nThe tour was just about the end of Griffin\u2019s career, but not quite. An International Cavaliers XI arrived in South Africa for a month long tour a few days after the tourists got back. Griffin played twice against them, first for Natal and then for an invitation eleven. After the controversy in England Griffin was a big draw and the umpires, who included Fell, were firmly requested not call him. Howard Kidson stood in the second match and was content to follow orders. What would he have done if there were no such instructions? The answer to that one is as clear as mud. He first wrote I still had no clear definition of a throw although I knew a throw when I saw it, before adding cryptically, with Griffin I was left with a lingering impression that I had been observing something that certainly looked* like a throw.\n\nOne of the Cavaliers on that trip was Trueman who, interestingly, commented; On a dead wicket which wasn\u2019t helping anyone Griffin let one go faster than anything I\u2019ve ever bowled \u2013 it ripped the thumb clean off Norm O\u2019Neill\u2019s brand new batting glove. After the Cavaliers games Griffin moved to Rhodesia were he played a few matches over the next couple of seasons, but he stepped off a First Class cricket ground for the last time at the age of just 23 after being no balled seven times. He only bowled nine overs in what was a sad end to an unfulfilled career.\n\nSo did Griffin throw? In 1960 Richie Benaud wrote; He has a very strong wrist flick in the last moment of delivery but this is quite permissible under the new interpretation of law 26, Benaud was in a tricky position as a man who might have found himself skippering Meckiff, Rorke and Slater the following summer, and he made similar comments about Charlie Griffith before later doing a volte face with him.\n\nDenis Compton wrote; I am sure the umpires have been too severe on this boy. Certainly he has a bent elbow, but he cannot straighten it because of physical disability. I have seen bowlers with far more suspect actions get away with it. And I will say definitely that Griffin does not throw. On the other hand Fortune believed that Griffin threw as, more tellingly, did Adcock and Waite. But for all that no one ever suggested that there was any malice in Griffin. For a fast bowler he was certainly a man with an equable temperament. His reaction to his hat trick was not significantly different to the outwardly phlegmatic response to being called. Trueman summed him up by saying; I would like to say what a really good sport Griffin has been about the whole throwing business. Geoff is a very nice lad, I think we were all sorry for him on that tour.\n\nFurther evidence to support Griffin\u2019s theory came the following year when none of the controversial Australian bowlers were chosen, despite all of them putting forward a decent case for selection in the previous domestic season. It may well be that Geoff Griffin\u2019s action did infringe the laws of the game, but that doesn\u2019t alter the fact that the treatment that he received at the hands of English umpires was truly appalling. His ordeal should never have been played out in the public eye in the manner that it was and the whole episode is one from which only Griffin himself emerges with any credit.\n\nBy the mid 1960s, when he might have been leading South Africa\u2019s attack with Peter Pollock and Mike Procter, Geoff Griffin was building an alternative career for himself as a hotelier in Rhodesia and was lost to the game of cricket. In due course he moved back to Natal where, at the age of 67, he died from a heart attack in 2006.\n\n*the emphasis is Kidson\u2019s, not that of the writer."}, {"url": "https://biogossipy.com/geoff-griffin/", "page_content": "Geoff Griffin net worth, birthday, age, height, weight, wiki, fact 2021-22!

Geoff Griffin, the former South African pace bowler, has died in Durban aged 67.\n\nAlthough he played two Tests and was the first South African to take a hat-trick in a Test, Griffin will best be remembered as the man who was no-balled out of international cricket at Lord's in 1960.\n\nA tall, blond, quick bowler who topped the national averages during the 1959-60 domestic season with 35 wickets at 12.23, his action had been the subject of debate from the moment the South Africans landed. In his defence, he had suffered an accident as a schoolboy which meant he couldn't straighten his arm, but he was playing at a time that there was considerable debate over suspect actions, mainly of Australian fast bowlers.\n\nNo-balled in warm-up matches, he underwent remedial work at Alf Gover's famous indoor school before returning to action, but a number of people were not satisfied.\n\nAt Lord's he took a hat-trick, the first by a South African, but that was completely overshadowed by him being repeatedly no-balled. His career was almost finished when, in an exhibition match played as the Test ended early, he was again called for throwing. Attempting to finish an over by bowling underarm, he was then rather cruelly called for not informing the umpire of a change of action. \"We didn't take the warning seriously,\" he was to recall many years later. \"It sounded so preposterous to use an exhibition match to do the dirty on me. He remained on the tour playing as a specialist batsman.\"\n\nA good-natured and popular player, he was widely praised for the way he took this massive setback. Griffin was contacted by a lawyer who offered to take the matter to court, free of charge. \"You'll win hands down and end up a wealthy young man,\" he said. But he declined. \"I loved cricket too much to sully the great game further.\"\n\nMany felt that the relatively unknown Griffin had been singled out by the authorities, who were desperate to send a message to the world that chuckers would not be tolerated. The fear was that a major row would erupt if Australia brought their batch of suspect bowlers in 1961, and so Griffin was used to show that umpires were prepared, if necessary, to act. If so, it worked. Australia omitted all their fast bowlers whose actions had caused such rancour in 1958-59.\n\n\"I was the victim of a thoroughly distasteful 'chucking' conspiracy,\" Griffin said earlier this year. \"I was the fall guy. I attribute the blame to the SA cricket authorities and the MCC who should never have allowed things to develop as they did.\"\n\nHe returned home and moved from Natal to Rhodesia, but within two years - and still only 23 years old - his career was over after he was repeatedly no-balled against North-Eastern Transvaal at Salisbury."}, {"url": "https://www.cricketweb.net/geoff-griffin-guilty-or-not-guilty/", "page_content": "Geoff Griffin \u2013 Guilty or Not Guilty?\n\nMartin Chandler | 8:07pm BST 09 April 2015\n\nA decade after Cuan McCarthy another ill-starred blond Natalian fast bowler was born. Geoff Griffin maintained to the end of his days that he was the victim of a thoroughly distasteful chucking conspiracy. Like that of McCarthy Griffin\u2019s cricket career did not last very long, and again in common with his predecessor he was undoubtedly treated badly. There was however one big difference between the two, in that unlike McCarthy Griffin almost certainly did throw.\n\nWhy should there have been a conspiracy is the first question that needs to be looked at. The flippant response to that is to point to conspiracy theories emerging in most situations of great controversy, but to be fair to Griffin when the ground opened up before him the game, in England at least, needed a scapegoat.\n\nA 19 year old Griffin had made his First Class debut in the 1957/58 season without tearing up any trees. His second campaign was much better and, at the same time, Peter May\u2019s England were touring Australia. Having started the season as favourites to retain The Ashes England had been soundly beaten, and blamed the defeat on the quartet who inspired Jack Fingleton to title his book on the series Four Chukkas to Australia. The alleged offenders were Ian Meckiff, Gordon Rorke, Keith Slater and Jim Burke.\n\nThe next Ashes series was due to be played in England in 1961, and the authorities did not want Australia bringing with them a group of illegal bowlers thus, so Griffin\u2019s argument would go, they resolved to adopt a zero tolerance attitude against South Africa in 1960.

The battle of wills was primarily between Nourse and Gubby Allen, the man who wanted to use Griffin as a stick with which to beat the Australian selectors.\n\nThe simple truth was that without Griffin there was no adequate foil for the South African spearhead Neil Adcock. So Griffin played at Lord\u2019s and South Africa bowled first. Griffin\u2019s first over was uneventful, and in the second he claimed the prized scalp of Colin Cowdrey. Just as he must have started to feel better about himself he then heard Lee call him twice from square leg in his third over. Never before had a bowler been called for throwing in a Test in England. At the close of a truncated day\u2019s play England were 114-2, and Griffin had been called five times altogether.\n\nPlay began on time next morning and England moved serenely on to 210-3 by lunch, losing only Kenny Barrington to Trevor Goddard\u2019s miserly left arm medium pace. Griffin did his share of bowling, and was not called at all, umpire Lee seeming to take less and less interest in him as the session wore on. His interest did however rise considerably after lunch when the new ball was taken and there were two more calls in Griffin\u2019s very first over with it.\n\nThis is another basis for the conspiracy theory. As ever there was nothing different about the way that Griffin bowled after lunch, other than having a new cherry in his hand, but there was a very substantial change in the way that Lee went about his duties. It is difficult to dismiss the idea that Allen had had words with him during the interval. There was a rain break during the afternoon session, and after it Lee called Griffin twice more. By 6.15 pm in the final session Griffin had been called six times in all by Lee for throwing and once by Buller for dragging. He had not taken a wicket all day and when, with England cruising as 347-5, Mike Smith on 99 edged the last ball of an over into the gloves of \u2018keeper John Waite most of the crowd did not know whether to feel sympathy for Smith or delight that the young bowler had finally got something to take from the game.\n\nThere was however much more for Griffin. With the first delivery of his next over he got through Peter Walker\u2019s defences and just clipped the bails. The new batsman was Fred Trueman and his reaction to the hat trick delivery was to take a mighty swing at it and lose his leg stump. It was the first ever Test hat trick at Lord\u2019s and the first by a South African anywhere. The crowd rose to applaud a young man they were growing to like. England reached the close at 362-8 and at that point Cowdrey declared. There was little play on the Saturday, which saw South Africa move to 34-1 in reply, but they then collapsed twice on the fourth day to lose by an innings before mid-afternoon. This committed the two sides to playing an exhibition match as a royal visit was due later so there had to be some cricket in play. The game involved no more than 20 overs per side and two overs per bowler, so it was a game that\u2019s only purpose was to entertain the crowd.\n\nEngland batted first and Griffin took the second over. For the first time on the tour Buller was at square leg for Griffin. The youngster ran in off five yards to deliver the first of his dozen deliveries. For the second Buller crossed to point and then back again to square leg for the third. He called that as well as the next two despite Griffin having cut his \u201crun up\u201d down to a couple of paces and the delivery itself to a gentle loosener. There was a discussion between McGlew and Buller as a result of which McGlew instructed Griffin, following an indication from Buller that it would be the only way he could complete the over, to bowl underarm. Even then Lee chose to no ball the first such delivery on the basis that Griffin, unsurprisingly, had forgotten to inform the batsman he would be changing his mode of delivery. With commendable restraint McGlew wrote later; My own feeling at that moment was that cricket, its laws and their application, had been reduced to complete and utter farce. Former England and Middlesex leg spinner turned writer Ian Peebles, who published an interesting book on the throwing controversy a few years later, said of the episode, this was the saddest moment I have ever experienced in cricket.\n\nFollowing that particular debacle there was to be no more bowling for Griffin on the tour. He played occasionally as a batsman, and indeed in his first game in that role he scored an unbeaten 65 against Lancashire, but that effort apart there were not too many more runs for him.\n\nThe tour was just about the end of Griffin\u2019s career, but not quite. An International Cavaliers XI arrived in South Africa for a month long tour a few days after the tourists got back. Griffin played twice against them, first for Natal and then for an invitation eleven. After the controversy in England Griffin was a big draw and the umpires, who included Fell, were firmly requested not call him. Howard Kidson stood in the second match and was content to follow orders. What would he have done if there were no such instructions? The answer to that one is as clear as mud. He first wrote I still had no clear definition of a throw although I knew a throw when I saw it, before adding cryptically, with Griffin I was left with a lingering impression that I had been observing something that certainly looked* like a throw.\n\nOne of the Cavaliers on that trip was Trueman who, interestingly, commented; On a dead wicket which wasn\u2019t helping anyone Griffin let one go faster than anything I\u2019ve ever bowled \u2013 it ripped the thumb clean off Norm O\u2019Neill\u2019s brand new batting glove. After the Cavaliers games Griffin moved to Rhodesia were he played a few matches over the next couple of seasons, but he stepped off a First Class cricket ground for the last time at the age of just 23 after being no balled seven times. He only bowled nine overs in what was a sad end to an unfulfilled career.\n\nSo did Griffin throw? In 1960 Richie Benaud wrote; He has a very strong wrist flick in the last moment of delivery but this is quite permissible under the new interpretation of law 26, Benaud was in a tricky position as a man who might have found himself skippering Meckiff, Rorke and Slater the following summer, and he made similar comments about Charlie Griffith before later doing a volte face with him.\n\nDenis Compton wrote; I am sure the umpires have been too severe on this boy. Certainly he has a bent elbow, but he cannot straighten it because of physical disability. I have seen bowlers with far more suspect actions get away with it. And I will say definitely that Griffin does not throw. On the other hand Fortune believed that Griffin threw as, more tellingly, did Adcock and Waite. But for all that no one ever suggested that there was any malice in Griffin. For a fast bowler he was certainly a man with an equable temperament. His reaction to his hat trick was not significantly different to the outwardly phlegmatic response to being called. Trueman summed him up by saying; I would like to say what a really good sport Griffin has been about the whole throwing business. Geoff is a very nice lad, I think we were all sorry for him on that tour.\n\nFurther evidence to support Griffin\u2019s theory came the following year when none of the controversial Australian bowlers were chosen, despite all of them putting forward a decent case for selection in the previous domestic season. It may well be that Geoff Griffin\u2019s action did infringe the laws of the game, but that doesn\u2019t alter the fact that the treatment that he received at the hands of English umpires was truly appalling. His ordeal should never have been played out in the public eye in the manner that it was and the whole episode is one from which only Griffin himself emerges with any credit.\n\nBy the mid 1960s, when he might have been leading South Africa\u2019s attack with Peter Pollock and Mike Procter, Geoff Griffin was building an alternative career for himself as a hotelier in Rhodesia and was lost to the game of cricket. In due course he moved back to Natal where, at the age of 67, he died from a heart attack in 2006.\n\n*the emphasis is Kidson\u2019s, not that of the writer."}, {"url": "https://awardsaustralia.com/about/", "page_content": "Established in 1989, Awards Australia is a Corporate Social Responsibility market leader.\n\nSpecialising in awards recognition programs on a state and national level, clients and the community receive win/win opportunities and outcomes through established marketing, media and event management expertise.\n\nAwards Australia is committed to the client brief and positive outcomes."}, {"url": "https://www.awardsaustralia.com/event-management-services/", "page_content": "Awards Australia is Australian owned and operated and renowned as Australia\u2019s foremost Community and Corporate Awards Program organisers.

It\u2019s a park, it\u2019s green space,\u201d Ogilvy said.\n\n\u201cI guess the theory is that if it wasn\u2019t a golf course it would be a park, but it wouldn\u2019t be. It would be houses or condos or warehouses or something. To preserve this much green space, especially in this area with Sandy and Cheltenham, is just amazing. What a value add for the community.\u201d\n\nGriffin shared similar sentiment and emphasised the need to protect the public game.\n\n\u201cI doubt I would be a golfer without public golf,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI grew up probably a kilometre from here and started playing at Sandy, Cheltenham, Moorabbin - which is no longer - and Elsternwick which is also no longer. If we keep losing them, we\u2019re guaranteed to lose golfers to the game.\u201d\n\nPublic golf allowed Griffin and Ogilvy to unearth their talent during their adolescence - Ogilvy won Cheltenham\u2019s B grade club championship in 1990 as a 13-year-old, while Griffin won A and B grade club championships at Cheltenham - through practice and playing competitively.\n\n\u201cThis was my house for the first three or four years of golf,\u201d Ogilvy said.\n\nHe would ride his bike to the course as soon as the school bell rang and Griffin followed suit a few years later.\n\n\u201cI played lots of putting comps and chipping comps here over the years,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been a place close to my heart. The club\u2019s always been a big supporter of mine. Two of my caddies that have caddied for me in Australia have been members here.\u201d\n\nGriffin gets back to Cheltenham to play a round a few times a year, and he paired up with local player Joel Harrod to get the better of Ogilvy and Commonwealth\u2019s Alexandria Hillard in yesterday\u2019s match.\n\nThe crowd erupted when Griffin holed-out for eagle on the par-5 7th, but some were equally pleased to see the course bite back when his birdie putt on the 8th green caught a downhill slope and trickled off the front of the green.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played here so many times before, but I\u2019ve never done that,\u201d Griffin said with a laugh.\n\nThe day belonged to young professional Darcy Brereton who shot the round of the day with a one-under par 34."}, {"url": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/geoff-griffin-dies-aged-67-268860", "page_content": "Geoff Griffin, the former South African pace bowler who was effectively no-balled out of Test cricket, has died in Durban aged 67\n\n\n\n\n\nGeoff Griffin in action during the 1960 tour of England which was the start and end of his international career \u00a9 Cricketer International\n\nGeoff Griffin, the former South African pace bowler, has died in Durban aged 67. Geoff Griffin, the former South African pace bowler, has died in Durban aged 67.\n\nAlthough he played two Tests and was the first South African to take a hat-trick in a Test, Griffin will best be remembered as the man who was no-balled out of international cricket at Lord's in 1960.\n\nA tall, blond, quick bowler who topped the national averages during the 1959-60 domestic season with 35 wickets at 12.23, his action had been the subject of debate from the moment the South Africans landed. In his defence, he had suffered an accident as a schoolboy which meant he couldn't straighten his arm, but he was playing at a time that there was considerable debate over suspect actions, mainly of Australian fast bowlers.\n\nNo-balled in warm-up matches, he underwent remedial work at Alf Gover's famous indoor school before returning to action, but a number of people were not satisfied.\n\nAt Lord's he took a hat-trick, the first by a South African, but that was completely overshadowed by him being repeatedly no-balled. His career was almost finished when, in an exhibition match played as the Test ended early, he was again called for throwing. Attempting to finish an over by bowling underarm, he was then rather cruelly called for not informing the umpire of a change of action. \"We didn't take the warning seriously,\" he was to recall many years later. \"It sounded so preposterous to use an exhibition match to do the dirty on me. He remained on the tour playing as a specialist batsman.\"\n\nA good-natured and popular player, he was widely praised for the way he took this massive setback. Griffin was contacted by a lawyer who offered to take the matter to court, free of charge. \"You'll win hands down and end up a wealthy young man,\" he said. But he declined. \"I loved cricket too much to sully the great game further.\"\n\nMany felt that the relatively unknown Griffin had been singled out by the authorities, who were desperate to send a message to the world that chuckers would not be tolerated. The fear was that a major row would erupt if Australia brought their batch of suspect bowlers in 1961, and so Griffin was used to show that umpires were prepared, if necessary, to act. If so, it worked. Australia omitted all their fast bowlers whose actions had caused such rancour in 1958-59.\n\n\"I was the victim of a thoroughly distasteful 'chucking' conspiracy,\" Griffin said earlier this year. \"I was the fall guy. I attribute the blame to the SA cricket authorities and the MCC who should never have allowed things to develop as they did.\"\n\nHe returned home and moved from Natal to Rhodesia, but within two years - and still only 23 years old - his career was over after he was repeatedly no-balled against North-Eastern Transvaal at Salisbury."}, {"url": "https://apollo.io/people/Geoff/Griffin/54ebb7e17468694311244f15", "page_content": "Established in 1989, Awards Australia is an Australian owned and run, Corporate Partnerships market leader.

This speech expresses the author's views and does not necessarily reflect those of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.\n\nIntroduction\n\nGood afternoon. I am excited to be able to speak with you today. I would like to share some observations regarding principal versus agent determinations under the revenue standard[1] and accounting for right of use assets under the leases standard.[2]\n\nPrincipal versus agent guidance\n\nThis year\u2019s conference may have changed to an all-virtual format, but one thing that will remain the same is a member of the OCA staff providing a speech on principal versus agent considerations. This continues to be a frequent area of consultation for the OCA staff, and my colleague Jillian Pearce[3] and I will both discuss it at this year\u2019s conference.\n\nSignificant judgment is often required when determining whether an entity is a principal or an agent in a revenue transaction. As discussed in previous staff speeches,[4] assessing whether an entity is a principal or agent under the applicable revenue guidance[5] can be particularly challenging in certain industries, such as the digital advertising industry or other industries in the technology space, where arrangements often involve multiple parties providing the good or service. I would like to share a fact pattern that illustrates such an arrangement.\n\nIn this fact pattern, the registrant operated a platform that facilitated an advertiser\u2019s purchase of advertising space from a publisher. The registrant identified a specific advertiser\u2019s digital advertisement (\u201cad\u201d) before bidding on potential advertising space in an auction process. Upon winning an auction, the registrant obtained an exclusive right to the potential advertising space and immediately pre-loaded the identified advertiser\u2019s ad to the publisher\u2019s site. If a valid user reaches the stage in the publisher\u2019s app where the potential advertising space is to be displayed, the pre-loaded ad is displayed in the advertising space on the publisher\u2019s site and a revenue transaction occurs.\n\nThe registrant concluded it was an agent in the transaction, despite the fact that it obtained momentary title to the advertising space, stating that it did not obtain control of the advertising space prior to transferring it to the customer.[6] That is, the registrant concluded that it did not have the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from, the publisher\u2019s advertising space.[7] Due to certain constraints, the registrant concluded it was unable to direct the use of the potential advertising space to an ad other than the predetermined ad in the seconds between winning the auction and the time the ad was displayed on the publisher\u2019s site.\n\nAs part of its assessment, the registrant considered the indicators of control set forth in the revenue recognition guidance, determining that it was not primarily responsible for fulfillment and did not have inventory risk; however, the registrant determined that it did have pricing discretion as the publisher had no ability to set or influence the price charged to advertisers.[8] In reaching its conclusion, the registrant stated that it was not primarily responsible for fulfillment based on the terms and conditions of its contract with the advertiser. The registrant believed that the terms and conditions of its contract only obligated it to provide an advertiser with access to the platform that facilitated the customer\u2019s purchase of advertising space from publishers. Finally, the registrant stated that it did not promise its customer, explicitly or implicitly, the delivery of advertising space, nor did the customer have recourse against the registrant if its ad was not properly displayed in the advertising space or a valid user did not view the ad.\n\nBased on the facts and circumstances presented to OCA staff, the staff did not object to the registrant\u2019s conclusion that it was an agent in the transaction and should recognize revenue on a net basis.\n\nRight-of-use asset guidance\n\nThe second topic I would like to discuss today relates to the accounting for abandonment of right-of-use assets under the leases standard.\n\nConsider a fact pattern where the registrant identified leases for abandonment, but expected there to be an extended period of time between the identification of abandonment and the actual abandonment date. The registrant noted that the leases standard requires a lessee to recognize any impairment loss for a right-of-use asset in accordance with existing guidance on impairment or disposal of long-lived assets;[9] however, upon performing an impairment assessment of the asset group, the registrant concluded there was no impairment. In this fact pattern, the registrant\u2019s identification of specific leases for abandonment did not result in a change to the asset group (i.e., the lowest level of identifiable cash flows) for which it assessed impairment.\n\nThe registrant noted that the leases standard did not provide explicit guidance to address its unique circumstances. The registrant identified a number of alternatives that it believed could be acceptable but ultimately concluded that it would be appropriate to adjust the amortization period of the right of use assets associated with the leases identified for abandonment. Given its plans to abandon these leases, and in the absence of any impairment, the registrant re-evaluated the economic life of the associated right-of-use assets and determined that the remaining right-of-use assets should be amortized ratably over the period between identification of abandonment and the actual abandonment date.\n\nThe staff did not object to the registrant\u2019s conclusion.\n\nConclusion\n\nThank you for your time and I hope you enjoy the remainder of the conference."}], "Geoff Griffin was a professional rugby league footballer.": [{"url": "https://wiki.alquds.edu/?query=George_Griffin_(rugby_league)", "page_content": "English professional rugby league footballer\n\nGeorge Griffin (born (1992-06-26)26 June 1992) is an English professional rugby league footballer who plays as a prop, second-row or loose forward for the Castleford Tigers in the Betfred Super League.\n\nHe has previously played for Hull Kingston Rovers, the London Broncos, and the Salford Red Devils in the Super League.

In his second Test appearance in 1960 at Lord's, he became the first (and, as of November 2014, only) South African cricketer to take a hat-trick in a Test match, and also the first and only cricketer to take a Test hat-trick at Lord's. He is best known for being no-balled for throwing in his second Test and the exhibition match that followed, and never having played Test cricket again.\n\nGriffin was born in Greytown in the former Natal Province and was educated at Durban High School. He was tall and blond, and excelled in many sports, playing hockey for Rhodesia and under-19s rugby for Natal. He was also Natal champion in the high jump, long jump, triple jump and pole vault.\n\nGriffin suffered an accident in childhood which rendered him unable to straighten his right arm. There was continuing controversy about bowlers \"throwing\" or \"chucking\" the ball (that is, flexing their elbow in the action of bowling the ball, which is contrary to the Laws of Cricket). The issue had been controversial since the editor of Wisden, Sydney Pardon, claimed that Australian fast bowler Ernest Jones was throwing in the tour of England in 1896, and then Jones and C. B. Fry were both no-balled in the Melbourne Test in 1897. The issue achieved renewed prominence following the Ashes series in Australia in 1958\u201359, when Australians Ian Meckiff and Gordon Rorke were suspected of throwing. Other fast bowlers, such as West Indies' Charlie Griffith and New Zealand's Gary Bartlett were also suspected. The MCC was determined to stamp out the problem before the Ashes series in England in 1961, and English umpires were instructed to strictly enforce the rule against throwing in 1960.\n\nGriffin made his first-class cricket debut for Natal in the 1957\u201358 South African domestic season, as a fast bowler. Despite being no-balled in South African provincial matches in the 1959\u201360 season, Griffin finished at the top of the averages, with 35 wickets at a bowling average of 12.23, and was selected to tour England in 1960, aged 20. Griffin was no-balled eight times during the tour match against the MCC at Lord's in May 1960, the first time that a touring player was called for throwing, and no-balled again several times by various umpires in matches against the counties. His tried to change his action at Alf Gover's indoor school, and was not called once in the 42 overs that he bowled in the 1st Test at Edgbaston, although his pace was much reduced. In the search for quicker deliveries, he fell back into his old faults, and was called in a tour match against Hampshire.\n\nEnglish umpires Frank Lee and Syd Buller repeatedly called Geoff Griffin for throwing in the 2nd Test, at Lord's, starting from his third over. After being no-balled five times on the first day and six times on the second day, he returned for a final bowling spell on Saturday 25 June and dismissed M. J. K. Smith with the last ball of one over, caught behind by John Waite for 99, and then bowled Peter Walker and Fred Trueman with the first two balls of his next over. This was the first Test cricket hat-trick claimed by a South African cricketer. England immediately declared their first innings for 362 with 8 wickets down.\n\nEngland quickly dismissed South Africa twice to win by an innings and 73 runs, just after lunch on the fourth day, Monday 27 June, with Brian Statham taking 6\u201362 and 5\u201334. A 20-over exhibition match was arranged to fill the period until the scheduled presentation of the players to the Queen at tea. Griffin was again repeatedly no-balled in the exhibition match for throwing, and was also no-balled for failing to notify the umpires that he was changing to bowl underarm to complete an over. Griffin later recounted that Donald Bradman came to the dressing room to console him, and let him know that the umpires were acting on order from MCC president Gubby Allen.\n\nGriffin remained on the tour as a batsman, but never played Test cricket again. Many spectators could see no difference between his \"legitimate\" deliveries, and the ones that were no-balled: many concluded that he threw every delivery. The public saw him as a martyr and scapegoat, and he was warmly applauded by the spectators at all of his subsequent tour matches. None of the controversial Australian bowlers from the 1958\u201359 Ashes series toured England in 1961.\n\nHe moved to play for Rhodesia, but his cricket career ended less than two years later, at the age of 23, after he was no-balled playing in a Currie Cup match against North Eastern Transvaal at Salisbury.\n\nIn retirement from cricket, he played club cricket, was a cricket coach, and worked as a hotel manager for South African Breweries in Durban, at the Argyll, and then at the Congela Hotel. He married twice.\n\nGriffin died of a heart attack in Durban."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65843401", "page_content": "Alexis Mac Allister won the World Cup with Argentina in 2022\n\nEvery time referee Nestor Pitana saw Alexis Mac Allister running in his direction to complain about some decision, he would make the same joke to try to calm the Argentinos Juniors youngster down.\n\n\"You remind me of [Lionel] Messi,\" Pitana, who refereed the 2018 World Cup final, would say.\n\n\"Only for the beard and the haircut\u2026\" Mac Allister would reply, laughing.\n\nMac Allister's talent may not be comparable with Messi's - whose is? - but his undoubted ability has been apparent since the early days, when he made his debut aged 17 in Argentina's second tier with Buenos Aires side Argentinos in October 2016.\n\nThe versatile midfielder helped secure promotion later that season, paving the way for a meteoric rise that saw him take his boyhood team to continental football and become the club's second biggest sale ever when Brighton came knocking with an \u00a38m offer in early 2019.\n\nFame, however, didn't immediately arrive and, until not so long ago, he could still walk largely unnoticed back home.\n\nA quiet and down-to-earth man, Mac Allister said that this time last year, before the World Cup, when he travelled to his birth town of La Pampa only \"a couple of people\" approached him for a picture.\n\nHowever, when he returned after helping Argentina win the 2022 World Cup, 15,000 fans were waiting for him.\n\nThings have certainly changed for the 24-year-old and will continue to do so now he has signed for Liverpool in a \u00a355m deal.\n\n'He was destined to reach the very top'\n\nFor those who have been there since the beginning, it feels like he is fulfilling his destiny with the move to Anfield.\n\n\"At the time [he joined Brighton], I told him - and he can confirm it - that I wouldn't ask him for a Brighton jersey or anything else,\" Argentinos general manager Alejandro Roncoroni told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The only thing that I wanted was for him to invite me for the day he made his debut for Real Madrid or a team of the same level.

We know our game's there but we just need to rediscover it again as soon as possible.\"\n\nHull FC: Hoy; McIntosh, Scott, Sutcliffe, Swift; Trueman, Clifford; Fash, Houghton, Taylor, Griffin, Lane, Cator.\n\nInterchanges: Sao, Satae, Savelio, Lane.\n\nWarrington: Dufty; Wrench, Minikin, Ratchford, Ashton; Williams, Drinkwater; Dudson, Clark, Vaughan, Currie, Harrison, Mata'utia.\n\nInterchanges: Bullock, Philbin, Walker, Green.\n\nReferee: Jack Smith."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65843401", "page_content": "Alexis Mac Allister won the World Cup with Argentina in 2022\n\nEvery time referee Nestor Pitana saw Alexis Mac Allister running in his direction to complain about some decision, he would make the same joke to try to calm the Argentinos Juniors youngster down.\n\n\"You remind me of [Lionel] Messi,\" Pitana, who refereed the 2018 World Cup final, would say.\n\n\"Only for the beard and the haircut\u2026\" Mac Allister would reply, laughing.\n\nMac Allister's talent may not be comparable with Messi's - whose is? - but his undoubted ability has been apparent since the early days, when he made his debut aged 17 in Argentina's second tier with Buenos Aires side Argentinos in October 2016.\n\nThe versatile midfielder helped secure promotion later that season, paving the way for a meteoric rise that saw him take his boyhood team to continental football and become the club's second biggest sale ever when Brighton came knocking with an \u00a38m offer in early 2019.\n\nFame, however, didn't immediately arrive and, until not so long ago, he could still walk largely unnoticed back home.\n\nA quiet and down-to-earth man, Mac Allister said that this time last year, before the World Cup, when he travelled to his birth town of La Pampa only \"a couple of people\" approached him for a picture.\n\nHowever, when he returned after helping Argentina win the 2022 World Cup, 15,000 fans were waiting for him.\n\nThings have certainly changed for the 24-year-old and will continue to do so now he has signed for Liverpool in a \u00a355m deal.\n\n'He was destined to reach the very top'\n\nFor those who have been there since the beginning, it feels like he is fulfilling his destiny with the move to Anfield.\n\n\"At the time [he joined Brighton], I told him - and he can confirm it - that I wouldn't ask him for a Brighton jersey or anything else,\" Argentinos general manager Alejandro Roncoroni told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The only thing that I wanted was for him to invite me for the day he made his debut for Real Madrid or a team of the same level. Because he was destined to reach the very top.\"\n\nFour years later, the boy who \"never hides on the pitch\" has reached football's elite and will now play a key role in Liverpool's rebuilding process.\n\nMac Allister joined Brighton from Argentinos Juniors on a four-and-a-half-year deal in January 2019\n\nBorn to be a footballer\n\nMac Allister, whose ancestors came from Ireland, was born to be a footballer.\n\nHis father, Carlos, lined up alongside Diego Maradona for Argentina, his uncle Patricio played for Estudiantes de La Plata and his brothers, Francis and Kevin, currently feature for Rosario Central and Argentinos respectively. They even have their own side back home, Deportivo Mac Allister.\n\nWhile still a youngster, the Reds' new midfield maestro even helped his dad with the scouting reports he prepared for Spanish side Osasuna.\n\nIt was no surprise when he joined Argentinos at the age of 12 and started marking waves right away for a team that is known as the 'world's nursery' and has produced the likes of Fernando Redondo, Juan Roman Riquelme, Esteban Cambiasso, Fabricio Coloccini and, of course, Maradona.\n\n\"I remember taking my kids to the club every Saturday and watching him play. He would always stand out,\" said general manager Roncoroni.\n\nMac Allister made his first senior appearance under former international defender Gabriel Heinze, who he regards as the coach who has brought the best out of him and taught him the game.\n\n'Get into the box, get into the box!'\n\nHaving played a prominent part as Brighton secured European football for the first time in their 122-year history, he finished the last campaign with 12 goals in 40 matches.\n\nIt was the most prolific season of his career so far - and his father Carlos would have been proud.\n\nDuring youth matches he would often yell from the stands for his son to \"get into the box\". Mac Allister hated it back then, but after hearing it so much he admits it has influenced his playing style.\n\nAble to play in different roles ranging from defensive midfielder to operating behind the forwards, as well as central midfield, he will provide a breath of fresh air for Liverpool's midfield.\n\n\"A technically gifted player like him can adapt to any position. He will always have the qualities of a number 10 (attacking midfielder), but with his intelligence and versatility he's able to adjust to any task he's asked to,\" explained Cristian Zermatten, one of his earliest mentors.\n\n\"No matter where he plays, he will do it [in the style of] a number 10 because at the end of the day that's how he feels football.\"\n\nIt will now be up to Reds boss Jurgen Klopp to take Mac Allister to another level - and Roncoroni has no doubt he is heading to the best club for that.\n\n\"After all, they have the same colours from where he was born,\" he said."}]}
