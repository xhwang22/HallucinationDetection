Winger released its second album In the Heart of the Young in 1990 and it also went platinum. Since then the band has released the following albums: Pull (1993), IV (2006), Karma (2009), and Better Days Comin\u2019 (2014).

Alice Cooper suggested that the band change their name to \u201cWinger\u201d from \u201cSahara\u201d, which is what the band was using n the early days. Winger found success with two platinum albums, but their third album \u201cPull\u201d didn\u2019t meet the sales of the albums before it and the band went in different directions pursuing solo careers for quite some time. Kip Winger married Beatrice Richter in 1991 but tragedy would strike in 1996 when she was killed in a car accident. Kip Winger released the following solo albums: This Conversation Seems Like a Dream (1997), Down Incognito (1999), Songs from the Ocean Floor (2001), From the Moon to the Sun (2008), Ghosts \u2013 Suite No. 1 (2010) and Conversations with Nijinsky (2016).

He would then go on to Whitesnake, where he still remains a member of the band as well as a member of Winger. Reb also has been in several so-called supergroups featuring all-star members from other well-known bands like The Mob and Black Swan. Reb Beach has also released several solo albums showcasing his guitar virtuoso skills with \u201cThe Fusion Demos\u201d, \u201cMasquerade\u201d, and \u201cA View From The Inside\u201d.\n\nhttp://www.rebbeach.com\n\nRod Morgenstein\n\nPrior to joining Winger, drummer and percussionist Rod Morgenstein played with The Dixie Dregs and Steve Morse\u2019s solo band.

Paul played on the first two Winger albums Winger (1988) and In the Heart of the Young (1990). He has rejoined the band for different tours over the years. He played on Alice Cooper\u2019s \u201cFistful Of Alice\u201d (1997) and former Journey singer Steve Perry\u2019s solo album \u201cFor the Love of Strange Medicine\u201d (1994)\n\nJohn Roth\n\nGuitarist John Roth joined Winger after working with Kip Winger on several of his solo albums.

WINGER recorded three very successful studio albums. The self-titled debut, was released in 1988 on Atlantic, achieved platinum status in the United States, and gold in Japan and Canada sporting such hits as \u201cMadalaine\u201d, \u201cSeventeen\u201d and \u201cHeaded For A Heartbreak\u201d.\n\nIn 1990, the band was nominated for an American Music Award for \u201cBest New Heavy Metal Band\u201d. Shortly after, WINGER released its second album \u201cIn the Heart of the Young\u201d, which went platinum in the U.S. and gold in Japan. The album included WINGER\u2019s biggest hit \u201cMiles Away\u201d, who topped at #12 of Billboard charts in the USA. Their third and last studio album, \u201cPull\u201d, was recorded in 1992/93 as a three-piece band, following Paul Taylor\u2019s departure. Produced by Mike Shipley, on the following tour John Roth was called in to replace Paul Taylor.\n\nAfter the \u201cPull\u201d tour, Kip Winger embarked on a solo career which encompassed 3 successful solo albums, singing with ALAN PARSONS live Project, 2 film scores plus performing over 400 acoustic shows and writing and producing for countless other artists. Reb Beach recorded one solo album, joined ALICE COOPER, DOKKEN and now WHITESNAKE, later joining Kelly Keagy (Night Ranger), Timothy Drury (WHITESNAKE) and Doug Pinnick (KING\u2019S X) to form the Hard Rock combo \u201cTHE MOB\u201d. Rod Morgenstein went on to form the RUDESS / MORGENSTEIN project with Jordan Rudess (DREAM THEATER) and later JELLY JAM with Ty Tabor (KING\u2019S X) and John Myung (DREAM THEATER). He is currently associate professor at Berkley College of Music.\n\nIn 2001 the band returned to the studio to record the song \u201cOn the Inside\u201d for \u201cThe Very Best of Winger\u201d. In 2002 they reunited to tour the US and Canada on a bill with POISON and CINDERELLA. After years of consideration Kip Winger decided to reunite WINGER for a brand new album in 2006. The release of \u201cIV\u201d brought Winger to tour Europe, US and Japan with great success and was followed by the release of the band\u2019s first live CD and DVD.\n\nThe inspiration for a new WINGER came about at the end of 2008, when Kip had the vision to melt the more commercial, heavier and song oriented approach of the first two albums with the more \u201cthinking-man\u201d approach of the last two studio records. Hence the title, \u201cKarma\u201d which represents Winger completing its full musical circle.\n\nThe result is an amazing new record where the four band members: Kip, Reb, Rod and John shine with an incredible instrumental and vocal prowess at the service of superb Hard Rock songs but with an uncanny sense of melody."}, {"url": "https://www.moderndrummer.com/2010/11/rod-morgenstein/", "page_content": "Rod Morgenstein: Cross-Genre Ripping\n\nRod Morgenstein is best known as the blazing left-handed drummer with the influential fusion band Dixie Dregs and the pop-metal band Winger. Rod\u2019s professional career began in 1975 while he was still a student at the University of Miami, which is where a nascent Dregs\u2014known at the time as Rock Ensemble II of the Studio Music and Jazz curriculum\u2014honed their skills and recorded their album The Great Spectacular (released on CD in 1997). When the band temporarily disbanded in 1983, Morgenstein joined fellow Dreg Steve Morse to form the Steve Morse Band, with whom the drummer recorded two albums.\n\nIn 1986 Morgenstein moved to New York City and soon met singer/bassist Kip Winger and guitarist Reb Beach. Winger\u2019s self-titled 1988 release went platinum in the U.S. and led to an American Music Award nomination for Best New Heavy Metal Band. Follow-up In The Heart Of The Young also went platinum. Although the group disbanded in 1993, they have since reunited on several occasions. Morgenstein also appeared on Kip Winger\u2019s solo albums This Conversation Feels Like A Dream (1997) and Songs From The Ocean Floor (2001). Rod has also taken part in numerous prog-rock side projects and supergroups, such as the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, Platypus, and the Jelly Jam, featuring members of Dream Theater and King\u2019s X.\n\nMorgenstein, who is a longtime columnist for Modern Drummer and a member of the 2011 MD Pro Panel, has released numerous instructional videos, CDs, and books, and is currently a professor of percussion at Berklee College of Music."}, {"url": "http://rodmorgenstein.com/about.html", "page_content": "ABOUT ROD\n\nRod\u0092s professional music career began as a founding member of the groundbreaking group the Dixie Dregs when, as a student at the University of Miami in Florida, he met Steve Morse, Andy West and Allen Sloan. The university was a hotbed of musical activity during this period, playing host to brilliant future talents like Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Danny Gottlieb, T Lavitz and Bruce Hornsby. Playing under the official Studio Music and Jazz curriculum title of Rock Ensemble II, the Dregs honed their fusionesque chops. It was here that the band recorded its classic Great Spectacular album now available on CD.\n\nThe Dixie Dregs' music combines rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk and classical influences into a rich, ever-changing tapestry of sound. All the while, Rod\u0092s drumming weaves its way seamlessly and colorfully through this swirling musical landscape.\n\nHis unique, dynamic and musical drumming style has led to Rod\u0092s winning the Best Progressive Rock Drummer award in Modern Drummer Magazine\u0092s Reader\u0092s Poll 5 years in a row (1986-1990) and Best All-Around Drummer (1999), earning him a permanent position in the magazine\u0092s prestigious Honor Roll. The Dixie Dregs, whose last 6 recordings have each received Grammy nominations for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, are best described in the following Philadelphia Inquirer concert review, \u0093The Dregs have their own unique language and style familiar to bluegrass and country music, refined with classical finesse and delivered with high-powered technology and rock energy. The band is possibly the most important, and certainly the most technically advanced, instrumental group in progressive fusion.\u0094\n\nWhen the group temporarily disbanded in 1983, Rod joined forces with Steve Morse who, along with bassist Jerry Peek, formed the Steve Morse Band. Rod remembers, \u0093One of our biggest breaks came when we had the opportunity to tour for 3 months with Rush on their 1985-1986 Power Windows tour. I felt a surge of popularity, both as a band and as a drummer, as a result of performing night after night in sold out arenas packed with appreciative progressive-rock fans. And it was more than obvious that many of them were drummers.\u0094\n\nThe Steve Morse Band recorded two albums, at which point Rod found himself at a crossroad in his career, as Steve Morse joined the reforming group Kansas. \u0093I was ready for a musical change and to try something both new and challenging.\u0094\n\nWithin a year of moving to New York City in 1986 after living in and around Atlanta, Georgia, for the previous 11 years, Rod met Kip Winger and Reb Beach, namesake and lead guitarist of the as-of-then-non-existent band Winger. \u0093Kip and Reb had been writing and recording demos and forever being rejected by record labels. I met them at a point in their lives where they were completely driven to get signed. Nothing could shake their determination. We got together and jammed, hit it off, and two months later they called to say they got a deal and to see if I\u0092d be interested in doing the record.\u0094\n\nThe rest is history! Their self-titled debut album in 1988 sold over two million copies worldwide, earning the band a platinum album in the U.S. and gold albums in Japan and Canada. It also led to an American Music Award nomination for Best New Heavy Metal Band. This album was followed by In the Heart of the Young and, once again, platinum and gold awards were in the offing, coupled with non-stop international touring.\n\nThe band ceased activities in 1993 after touring for the highly acclaimed Pull recording, as dramatic changes were taking place in the music scene. Alternative music had replaced metal as the accepted music of the day.\n\nIn 2002, WInger reunited for a summer tour with Poison, CInderella and Faster Pussycat in support of 'The Very Best of Winger', a greatest hits collection. And in 2006, the band released the critically acclaimed, 'Winger IV', followed by tours in Europe, US, Japan and Australia.\n\nIn 1993, when Winger temporarily disbanded, Kip Winger set out to record his first solo album, This Conversation Seems Like Dream (1997), a dramatic departure from the first three Winger recordings, drawing heavily on world percussive rhythms, dark imagery and heavy grooves. Rod recorded the drum tracks for this album and the more recent Songs From The Ocean Floor (2001) at Kip\u0092s home studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n1997 also saw the self-titled debut release by the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, an instrumental progressive power-duo, featuring Rod and Dream Theater keyboardist extraordinaire Jordan Rudess. The seed for this project was planted one evening on the Dixie Dregs 1994 Full Circle tour in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when a sudden power failure shut down the guitar, bass and violin rigs. For whatever reason, the keyboards remained unaffected. And what followed was a blistering, 10 minute drum/keyboard power-duo jam, which brought down the house. It was that evening\u0092s events, which inspired Rod and Jordan to form their \u0093small in numbers yet mighty in sound\u0094 band. The Rudess Morgenstein Project has played concerts in the US, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Mexico, Germany, Holland and the UK. Additionally, Rod recorded the drum tracks for Jordan's solo cds, ' Rhythm of Time' and 'The Road Home'.\n\nOther on-going projects that Rod is involved with are jam band Jazz Is Dead which features creative improvisations of the music by the Grateful Dead. Members of JID have included T Lavitz, Alphonso Johnson, Jeff Sipe, Billy Cobham, Jeff Pevar, Dave Livolsi, and Jimmy Herring, with an ever-changing line up. Another project is Platypus, whose two recordings feature John Myung (Dream Theater), Ty Tabor (King\u0092s X) and Derek Sherinian (Planet X). The music is a mix of instrumental and vocal tunes that blend many different styles together. An offshoot of Platypus is The Jelly Jam, a power trio featuring Rod, Ty Tabor and John Myung. Their debut release came out in 2001, and The Jelly Jam, '2' was released in 2004\n\nIn addition to his recording and touring credits, Rod is very active in drum education. He is currently a Professor of Percussion at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Mass. Also, his highly recognized instructional materials include videos, audio cassettes and books. His most recent offering is Drum Set Warm-Ups , touted as the definitive text for developing and improving all aspects of drum set playing. Additionally, Rod has been a columnist for Modern Drummer Magazine (U.S.), Rhythm Magazine (UK), Sticks Magazine (Germany) and is an international clinician and involved with product development for Sabian Cymbals (Signature Tri-Top Ride), and Vic Firth Sticks (Signature Sticks and Isolation Headphones), with whom he has been an endorser for many, many years."}, {"url": "http://www.metal-temple.com/site/catalogues/entry/musicians/kip_winger_reb_beach.htm", "page_content": "Age of the Wolf \u2013 A Pilgrimage to Nowhere \u00b7 Undrask - God Emperor \u00b7 Metal Church - Congregation of Annihilation \u00b7 Death of Giants \u2013 Ventesorg \u00b7 The Biscuit Merchant \u2013 Phobia \u00b7 Artificial Sun \u2013 The Giants Collapse \u00b7 Necronomicon - Constant to Death \u00b7 Silkof Grove - Death Construction \u00b7 D.R.E.P. \u2013 Drastically Reducing Earth\u2019s Population \u00b7 Terrifier - Trample The Weak, Devour The Dead Latest updates: We hope you enjoy your visit here.

Eventually, there was also Reb Beach and after a some time the rest of the band joined in turning this interview into a fruitful discussion. So, read below what was said leaving aside all the small talk in between that I mostly enjoyed. It is always nice to talk to really down to earth musicians who keep their feet to the ground no matter what. So, how did you find the show yesterday (01 December 2009) ?\n\nKip Winger: The crowd was amazing. Have you been there?\n\n\n\nYeah I did and it was really great. What about the venue; did you like it?\n\nKip Winger: What are you doing now? This is a really stupid question!\n\nReb Beach: (altering his voice) Did we like it? Did it look like we were having fun? Come on, we had a great time!\n\nKip Winger: Where is this question going? Are you going to ask us how do we feel playing into big arenas and now we are playing in small clubs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWait a minute guys I believe you have misunderstood me; if you waited for the next question you'd understand my point.\n\nKip Winger: Ok, let's hear it.\n\n\n\nBefore fixing a live date do you look the venue you are going to play?\n\nKip Winger: No. We sent a contract saying the size of the stage we play and we showed them yesterday but what we could possibly do?\n\nReb Beach: Could we say \u201cFuck you, we are not going to play\u201d ?\n\nKip Winger: In this way the fans get fucked.\n\n\n\nSo, you played yesterday for the fans.\n\nKip Winger: Absolutely.\n\n\n\nSo, this where my initial question was going. I did not mean in any way to sound aggressive\u2026\n\nKip Winger: Please don't take offense to anything we say\u2026\n\nReb Beach: He is a nice guy Kip. But know that his answers will be totally different for mine because we are exactly the opposite in every way\u2026(laughs)\n\n\n\nSo, Reb did someone steal your guitar pedal yesterday?\n\nReb Beach: Yeah someone stole it right off the stage. That was the first time someone has seen me angry. It was a very expensive pedal\u2026\n\nKip Winger: The guys grabbed the pedal and run out of the club.\n\n\n\nTalking about a small venue\u2026 So, let's move on; you have played live in the US and in Europe can you spot the differences between them?\n\nKip Winger: In general I think the audiences in Europe are better because they listen to the music in more detail. Between New York and L.A. there are some great audiences but I just prefer\u2026. mmm this is political incorrect. What I find is that the Europeans listen to the music more intensely than the Americans\u2026\n\nReb Beach: (with a funny voice) So, are you saying that the Americans are musically dummer? (all laughing).\n\nKip Winger: I did not say that. I think Europeans take it more seriously like listening to the band and knowing everything about the band. You know it's a little more detailed.\n\n\n\nWill you tour the US?\n\nKip Winger: Hopefully we will. We are tying to plan that now but we have difficulties booking gigs since Reb is in WHITESNAKE, Rod teaches in Berkeley and John is also in GIANT, so it is tough you see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's talk about music; what are the differences between \u201cKarma\u201d and \u201cIV\u201d from your point of view?\n\nReb Beach: Well, I can say something here. Even that I feel nervous that Kip is sitting beside me and we have not done an interview together for years I have to say that with \u201dIV\u201d I got to his house and he told me that he had a vision about how the album should be from front to back. \u201cSo, just sit there and when I need a guitar riff I am going to ask for\u201d. So, I was the guitar-riff writer guy. But he did all the rest. That album was his baby and his vision.\n\nKip Winger: No\u2026.\n\nReb Beach: Yes, Kip, this was exactly the way and I won't do that ever again (laughs). You know he is the classical genius, a 76-piece orchestra guy who writes for ballets (actually he has wrote one lately) and this was his chance to kind of insert all that into a Rock album and do his thing. But, with \u201dKarma\u201d when I got to his house he asked me \u201cWhat do you want to do Reb?\u201d, I said that I wanted to go back to the old sound.\n\n\n\nYeah, I also believe that this album is more guitar-driven than the previous.\n\nKip Winger: We took a six pack of beers, a bag of weed and sat down for 10 days and wrote these 10 songs.\n\n\n\n(John Roth and Rod Morgenstein joined the conversation) Kip Winger: Hey man, you can interview the whole band. Do you know how rare this is? I don't even know if this has ever happened.\n\n\n\nSo, now that you are all here I have to jump to this question; is Kip an easy person to work with?\n\nReb Beach: He is very easy.\n\nKip Winger: Do I have a bad reputation?\n\nReb Beach: He is awesome, he listens what you have to say and he is a genius. He will take your idea and make the most of it.\n\n\n\nReally, the writing process just took 10 days? Was it so intense?\n\nReb Beach: Yeah man, we wrote one song per day. Kip asked us to write a song per day or at least a piece of a song per day. I said OK, I am going to do it. I wrote one song in two months. But with Kip you get up in the morning and star working and by noon you are in the studio working all-day-long until you're done.\n\nKip Winger: That's why in Nashville where I live everybody fucking writes.\n\nReb Beach: For me this is impossible unless Kip is whipping me to work. But I can still get wasted while he is whipping me (laughs).\n\n\n\nWhat about the title of the album; is there a special meaning behind it?\n\nReb Beach: It is really about WINGER. Back in the 80s when we were listening to all those bands we were thinking that we could better than them. So, now we thought that this album could be successful and it would be like karma after all the bad things that happened to us.\n\n\n\nSo, Kip what is the story behind BLACKWOOD CREEK?\n\nKip Winger: We had a band with my brother and those guys so we did an album for the old-good-times sake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan we expect something like this in the future?\n\nKip Winger: I really don't know. We finished this album mixing old ideas with some new ones in a 70s, very poppy and simple way. It was really cool.\n\n\n\nYou are all busy outside WINGER so my question is: can an artist be fully dedicated in a band when he is doing several things on the side?\n\nRod Morgenstein: This question could be \u201ccan walk and chew gum at the same time\u201d ? After all, we have been doing this for so long so, yes, we manage with that\u2026\n\nKip Winger: No matter in how many bands we are in, we have certain standards for this band and definite vibe that is pretty obvious when you see us live. This is 16 years of chemistry\u2026\n\n\n\nAnother one question for Kip; you had the premier for \u201cGhosts\u201d so, how does it feel like?\n\nKip Winger: Well, it was not like a premier since it was performed with the Tucson Symphony that was really cool. But the actual premier is the ballet with the choreography and all this stuff. It is a dream that came true for me. I wrote it a while ago but I was thinking of doing something like this like 20 years. It is very very exciting.\n\n\n\nHow different was it working for \u201cGhosts\u201d when compare to the work with WINGER?\n\nKip Winger: I have been trying to do this for a long time. I actually felt like home. You know something, I am not a jammer. All these guys can jam really well but I am not like it. When I do music it has to be precisely where to do what. So, I do Rock music like orchestra music. It is all got to be in its place. I can jam with the band in the Blues but that's it\u2026\n\nRod Morgenstein: We totally disagree with him because he can jam great.\n\n\n\nHave you ever thought of rearranging WINGER's music and add some classical elements?\n\nKip Winger: I thought of this two days ago. Maybe we can call it WINGER-suite (laughs). We could do \u201cRainbow In The Rose\u201d or \u201cHeaded For A Heartbreak\u201d or \u201cHungry\u201d. Maybe we will do it. I do not know when, but I have thoughts about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, you have been in the band almost for two decades; do you feel satisfied?\n\nRod Morgenstein: Well, this is not an easy question to answer; it is a mixture of feelings. There is the musical satisfaction in terms of you can listen to your CD and be proud of the band. It was a really interesting career all these years playing in all venue sizes but this band also had its ups and downs. When music changed all of a sudden and Metal took a dive with NIRVANA and PEARL JAM taking over the scene. Then there was a frustrating time period when everyone thought that this sound was very cool. So, to be is a combination of what we have accomplished in terms all the different albums we made but still we could do a lot better\u2026 John Roth Personally, I don't really care how many peopled are watching us live as long as they sing every single lyrics like last night. That is the most satisfied. When you make an album and send to the world you never know what the reaction will be. But when you see such a reaction as a performer it is the ultimate reward.\n\n\n\nThis is great to hear something like this from musicians who have been around so many years. Because, I think most of the new bands care more about the selling numbers than they do about the fans. Rod Morgenstein: Really? Who, for example?\n\n\n\nThere is no point of giving specific names. But it is the reality\u2026\n\nKip Winger: You say that the new bands care of the albums they are selling?\n\n\n\nYeah I do.\n\nKip Winger: In that case, good luck.\n\nRod Morgenstein: Yeah, good luck because it is not the right time to worry about the numbers. If you are not doing it because you love it, then what's the point?\n\nKip Winger: You can hear the music, I think. This is why there is so much shitty music out there. On the other hand the Internet has brought in front many great bands and artists that you'd never have heard of them. So, it is really a double-edged sword.\n\n\n\nHave you ever thought of celebrating the 20 years with WINGER?\n\nKip Winger: Why? We don't feel that we have achieved something special. We were always trying hard so we never noticed what we have done.\n\nReb Beach: If you think hard we are an 80s band that came out on the late 80s. Actually it was 1989 when the Hard Rock scene was in its way down. But now we are all doing the same thing; playing in the same places like we do. Kip Winger: BON JOVI and DEF LEPARD were bigger than everybody else and they are still big.\n\nReb Beach: DEF LEPARD came out in 1980. I remember buying \u201dOn Through The Night\u201d and being jealous of the guitarist who had my age!\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever felt threatened by the press in any way?\n\nReb Beach: Just tonight! (laughs)\n\nKip Winger: Are you kidding? We were more attacked than every other band. What do you think? This is our question to you. Do you think that we were threatened?\n\n\n\nYeah, I believe so.\n\nKip Winger: Thank you! This was a rhetoric question after all. It definitely affected us back in those days, but what can you really do about it? Are you talking about the \u201cBeavis And Butt-head\u201d thing?\n\n\n\nNo, it is more of a general question.\n\nKip Winger: So, you are asking if we listen to the critics and read their reviews?\n\n\n\nYes.\n\nRod Morgenstein: We do read the reviews but we also know that this is what one person wrote and not a team of people. On the other hand we are humans; so, when a bad review comes in -especially in the first days- it hurts! I mean, you spent a lot of time working into the music and then one comes to say that it sucks.\n\n\n\nSo, thank you very much guys for your time. It was a real pleasure talking to the entire band.\n\n\n\nRating Unrated You do not have permission to rate Edited 10 June 2023 Edited 10 June 2023 : Ok, let's hear it.: No. We sent a contract saying the size of the stage we play and we showed them yesterday but what we could possibly do?: Could we say \u201cFuck you, we are not going to play\u201d ?: In this way the fans get fucked.: Absolutely.: Please don't take offense to anything we say\u2026: He is a nice guy. But know that his answers will be totally different for mine because we are exactly the opposite in every way\u2026(laughs): Yeah someone stole it right off the stage. That was the first time someone has seen me angry. It was a very expensive pedal\u2026: The guys grabbed the pedal and run out of the club.: In general I think the audiences in Europe are better because they listen to the music in more detail. Between New York and L.A. there are some great audiences but I just prefer\u2026. mmm this is political incorrect. What I find is that the Europeans listen to the music more intensely than the Americans\u2026: (with a funny voice) So, are you saying that the Americans are musically dummer? (all laughing).: I did not say that. I think Europeans take it more seriously like listening to the band and knowing everything about the band. You know it's a little more detailed.: Hopefully we will. We are tying to plan that now but we have difficulties booking gigs sinceis inteaches in Berkeley andis also in, so it is tough you see.: Well, I can say something here. Even that I feel nervous thatis sitting beside me and we have not done an interview together for years I have to say that withI got to his house and he told me that he had a vision about how the album should be from front to back. \u201cSo, just sit there and when I need a guitar riff I am going to ask for\u201d. So, I was the guitar-riff writer guy. But he did all the rest. That album was his baby and his vision.: No\u2026.: Yes,, this was exactly the way and I won't do that ever again (laughs). You know he is the classical genius, a 76-piece orchestra guy who writes for ballets (actually he has wrote one lately) and this was his chance to kind of insert all that into a Rock album and do his thing. But, withwhen I got to his house he asked me \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d, I said that I wanted to go back to the old sound.: We took a six pack of beers, a bag of weed and sat down for 10 days and wrote these 10 songs.: Hey man, you can interview the whole band. Do you know how rare this is? I don't even know if this has ever happened.: He is very easy.: Do I have a bad reputation?: He is awesome, he listens what you have to say and he is a genius. He will take your idea and make the most of it.: Yeah man, we wrote one song per day.asked us to write a song per day or at least a piece of a song per day. I said OK, I am going to do it. I wrote one song in two months. But withyou get up in the morning and star working and by noon you are in the studio working all-day-long until you're done.: That's why in Nashville where I live everybody fucking writes.: For me this is impossible unlessis whipping me to work. But I can still get wasted while he is whipping me (laughs).: It is really about. Back in the 80s when we were listening to all those bands we were thinking that we could better than them. So, now we thought that this album could be successful and it would be like karma after all the bad things that happened to us.: We had a band with my brother and those guys so we did an album for the old-good-times sake.: I really don't know. We finished this album mixing old ideas with some new ones in a 70s, very poppy and simple way. It was really cool.: This question could be \u201ccan walk and chew gum at the same time\u201d ? After all, we have been doing this for so long so, yes, we manage with that\u2026: No matter in how many bands we are in, we have certain standards for this band and definite vibe that is pretty obvious when you see us live. This is 16 years of chemistry\u2026: Well, it was not like a premier since it was performed with thethat was really cool.

Formed in New York City, Winger gained popularity during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The band's two platinum albums, Winger and In the Heart of the Young, along with charting singles \"Seventeen,\" \"Headed for a Heartbreak\" and \"Miles Away,\" put them on the top of the charts by the early 1990s. In 1990, the band was nominated for an American Music Award for \"Best New Heavy Metal Band.\" As the music scene changed in the early to mid-1990s due to the popularity of grunge, their success faded after their third release Pull.\n\nWinger disbanded in 1994. In 2001 they reunited and have since conducted several successful tours. In 2006, the band's 1993 touring line-up (minus Paul Taylor but including John Roth) reunited to record the band's first studio album in over 13 years, IV, and toured in support of the album into 2008.\n\nIn 2009, the band released their fifth album, Karma. As of 2013, Winger was performing on mini-tours, festivals and private events. Their most recent album, Better Days Comin', came out in 2014.\n\nHistory:\n\nMain career and break-up (1987\u20131994).\n\nThe debut album, Winger, was released on August 10, 1988 on Atlantic Records. The record was a success, achieving platinum status in the United States, and gold status in Japan and Canada. On February 11, 1989, the album peaked at number 21 on the Billboard 200, and was in various places on the chart for 63 weeks. Radio and MTV hits from the album included \"Madalaine\", \"Seventeen\", \"Headed for a Heartbreak\" and \"Hungry\". In 1990, the band was nominated for an American Music Award for \"Best New Heavy Metal Band\".\n\nShortly after that tour, Winger released its second album In the Heart of the Young, which went 1-and-1/2 platinum in the U.S. and gold in Japan. Hit radio tracks and MTV videos included \"Can't Get Enuff\", \"Miles Away\" and \"Easy Come Easy Go\".\n\nWinger followed the release of its second album with a 13-month world tour, playing over 230 dates with Kiss, Scorpions, ZZ Top, Extreme and Slaughter. Paul Taylor left the band after the tour, citing exhaustion after years of touring. Their third studio album, Pull, produced by Mike Shipley, was recorded in 1992/1993 as a three-piece band. It was originally to be called Blind Revolution Mad, after the opening song. Reportedly, Kip Winger, anticipating that critics would dismiss the album out of hand, renamed it Pull as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the CD being used by critics as a skeet-shooting target. The album was not as successful as the previous albums sales wise, but gained solid reviews. On the following tour, John Roth was called in to replace Paul Taylor on rhythm guitar. The album coincided with the rise of grunge, which swept aside the brand of melodic pop metal that Winger represented.\n\nIn the 1990s, Winger was subject to mockery from MTV's animated series Beavis and Butt-head. Series creator Mike Judge later revealed that he had been incorrectly informed that Kip Winger had asked the network not to make jokes about the band on the series, which led to further jokes about the band, but later learned from Winger himself that he had never made any such stipulation. \u201cStewart\u201d, an early character from the TV show, wore a Winger t-shirt during the shows original run on MTV during the early 90s.\n\nAfter disbanding in 1994, bassist/lead vocalist Kip Winger went on to a solo career, guitarist Reb Beach went on to touring projects with artists Dokken, Alice Cooper and has held a permanent guitar spot in Whitesnake since 2002. The band's other members pursued or resumed careers as session musicians.\n\nReunions (2001\u2013present)\n\nIn 2001, it was announced that all original members of the band would return to the studio to record the song \"On the Inside\" for The Very Best of Winger. In 2002, all five members embarked on a reunion tour of the U.S. and Canada on a bill with Poison. According to Kip Winger, in a 2008 interview with rock and roll comic C.C. Banana, it was important to include all five members because \"it was the big, long-awaited reunion so I wanted to include everybody who had ever been in the band.\" In 2003, it was confirmed that activity had been halted due to Reb Beach's touring commitment with Whitesnake as well as his solo album \"Masquerade\" and involvement with \"super-group\" project The Mob with King's X frontman Doug Pinnick and Night Ranger drummer Kelly Keagy.\n\nOn July 16, 2005, it was announced that Kip Winger would perform as the lead singer for the Alan Parsons Live Project at the Common Ground Music Festival in Lansing, Michigan. In May 2006, it was confirmed that Winger had reformed without one of its original members Paul Taylor, to record another album and tour Europe. The album, IV, was released in Europe in October and the nine-country \"Winger IV Tour\" ran in the last two weeks of the same month.\n\nOn February 25, 2008, the band performed in Providence, Rhode Island, as part of a benefit for survivors of the Station nightclub fire. The concert, along with other artists was debuted on VH1 Classic on March 23, 2008. In late 2009, it was confirmed that Winger would record a fifth album Karma, with a tour to support it. Most recently, John Roth became the guitarist for Giant and would appear on their forthcoming album Promise Land then set for release in February/March of 2010.\n\nWinger released their sixth studio album titled, Better Days Comin' in April 2014, after teasers were published on Kip Winger's website and on the official Winger Facebook page as well.\n\nAs of late 2018, Winger was playing club dates. They were scheduled on Dec 29, 2018 in Westland, Michigan.\n\nStyle and influences.\n\nThe band's musical style combines elements of glam metal and progressive metal. Kip Winger, in description of the band's musical ability and style, said, \"Our band was known to musicians, and a lot of musicians showed up to see me play \u2014 watching, trying to figure out how I'm playing. We were like the 'hair band' (version of) Dream Theater.\""}, {"url": "https://musicxplorer.com/artists/rod-morgenstein-drummer/", "page_content": "Rod Morgenstein- Drummer\n\nDixie Dregs and Grammy Nominee\n\nRod is a New York native, founding member, and drummer of the Dixie Dregs, a six-time Grammy nominee. Rod is a professor, teaching percussion at Berklee College of Music, in Boston, Massachusetts. Recently offering, Drum Set Warm-Ups , touted as the definitive text for developing and improving all aspects of drum-set playing. He is also a columnist for Modern Drummer magazine.\n\nThe beginning of the Dregs started in 1973, when he attended the University of Miami in Florida. There he met Steve Morse, Andy West, and Allen Sloan, playing under the official Studio Music and curriculum title of, Rock Ensemble II. At the university, The Dregs recorded their first album in 1975, The Great Spectacular, as a class project.\n\nThe Dregs had a rough time getting signed and were turned down and told their music was difficult to market because they were a jazz fusion band had no vocals, odd timing, and that their music combines rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk, and classical influences. The group was finally signed to Capricorn in 1977, and recorded several albums before they temporarily disbanded in 1983. Rod then joined Steve Morse\u2019s new band and stayed for two albums before wanting a musical change to try something both new and challenging. The Dregs last reunion was a tour in 2018.\n\nWinger and Other Projects\n\nRod moved back to New York City and began auditioning for jobs, one of them turned out to be a band that Kip Winger was forming. Two months later, Rod received a call from the band, and they were off to record their self-titled, debut album, Winger, in 1988. It went double platinum. Winger followed up in 1990 with In the Heart of the Young. In 1993, they released the album, Pull, as grunge came in and changed the music scene. The band decided to take a break, but got back together in 2002, and have had sporadic reunions since, and continue to do so as time permits. Winger will be releasing a new album in 2021.\n\nRod\u2019s other projects include the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, an instrumental progressive power-duo, featuring Rod and Dream Theater keyboardist extraordinaire, Jordan Rudess, with two albums to their credit. Rod is is involved with jam band, Jazz Is Dead, which features creative improvisations of the music by the Grateful Dead. Another project is, Platypus, whose two recordings feature: John Myung (Dream Theater), Ty Tabor (King\u2019s X), and Derek Sherinian (Planet X). The music is a mix of instrumental and vocal tunes that blend many different styles together. An offshoot of Platypus is The Jelly Jam, a power trio featuring Rod, Ty Tabor, and John Myung. Their debut release came out in 2001, and The Jelly Jam, \u20182\u2019 was released in 2004.\n\nInterview with Rod Morgenstein (Part 1)"}, {"url": "https://www.liverate.com/artists/winger", "page_content": "\"How good are they LIVE?\" in the last 12 months based on a score on 100 (as of 5/11/23)\n\n\"How good are they LIVE?\" based on a score on 100 (as of 5/11/23)\n\nBased on 9 concert reviews, the critic consensus is that Winger is rated as an average live performer.\n\nWinger is an American hard rock band formed in New York City, in 1987, that gained popularity during the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nCRITIC REVIEWS\n\n1013 Music Reviews (USA) % Winger / George Lynch \u2013 Medina Ballroom \u2013 Medina MN \u2013 March 5th 2022 Full Review\n\nJam Magazine (USA) % Kip Winger and the boys had us all singing as they called to mind all the hits and some heavy rockers, too.

Late application for students who do not wish to walk will result in processing delays for your academic record and diploma, and your name may not be listed in the ceremony program.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between graduating and walking in Commencement?\n\n\n\nYou can walk in Commencement when you are nine (9) credits or less away from completing your degree requirements by the end of the spring term.

If you are interested in applying to the Bachelor of Arts degree program and would like an estimate of the amount of transfer credit you would receive, you can request an unofficial transfer evaluation by emailing a copy of your transcript(s) to the Berklee Online Transfer Team at transfer@online.berklee.edu . Be sure to include your name, major of interest, and any additional questions you may have. You can expect to receive your assessment within 7-10 business days.\n\nI didn\u2019t receive credit on my Official Evaluation for all of the courses that I thought I would. What should I do? The earlier you contact us with questions or concerns regarding your evaluation, the easier it will be for us to address any issues. Therefore, it is very important when you first receive your official transfer evaluation that you review the information carefully.\n\n\n\nIf you notice a remaining requirement that you believe you\u2019ve already fulfilled, first consult our document on Common Reasons Credit Does Not Transfer. It\u2019s possible that the course you are thinking of didn\u2019t meet our eligibility requirements.\n\n\n\nIf none of those exclusions apply, please fill out a Transfer Credit Equivalency Re-evaluation form for the courses you wish to have reconsidered.\n\n\n\nSometimes, we are not able to locate specific information for a course online and we are not able to determine an equivalency, but we are always happy to review additional material which will help us make that determination.\n\nDo my Berklee Online, Berklee campus, or Prior Learning Credit coursework count towards the 60 transfer credit limit? No, credits completed at Berklee or through the prior learning process do not count towards the 60 transfer credit limit. This maximum is for credit-bearing exams and undergraduate-level coursework completed externally.\n\nWhat is a credit deficiency and why do I need to make up credit? Credit deficiencies are caused by transferring a course that is less than three (3) credits to fulfill a three (3) credit Berklee Online requirement. Students with a credit deficiency will be short of the minimum number of credits required to graduate once they have completed their program requirements. In order to be eligible to graduate, you will need to make up the credits you are deficient in.\n\n\n\nWhile the Transfer Team does their best to avoid giving students credit deficiencies, it is not always possible. You can make up the credits you are deficient in by completing additional Berklee Online coursework, by applying for prior learning credit, or by completing additional external coursework in the area in which you are deficient.\n\n\n\nNote all external courses will first need to be approved by the Transfer Team.\n\nCan transfer credit fulfill prerequisites? It depends. Generally, transfer credit cannot be used to fulfill prerequisites unless we determine that the course you completed is a direct equivalent to one of the courses we offer at Berklee Online. Keep in mind that there are some courses which require you to pass a placement exam. For these you will need to achieve a passing grade on the test to fulfill the prerequisite, otherwise you will need to complete the appropriate Berklee Online course.\n\nCan I transfer credits to Berklee Online after I have started the degree program? Yes, you can. To determine if the coursework you already completed or are considering taking is eligible to fulfill your remaining degree requirements, contact the Transfer Team at transfer@online.berklee.edu\n\nI am a Berklee campus student. Can I transfer courses from Berklee Online to my campus-based program?\n\n\n\nFor additional questions about transferring courses from Berklee Online to Berklee's campus programs please contact the campus transcript evaluator at View a list of transferable courses to Berklee\u2019s campus programs.For additional questions about transferring courses from Berklee Online to Berklee's campus programs please contact the campus transcript evaluator at transfercredits@berklee.edu\n\nAre Berklee Online courses transferable to other institutions?

Our courses are transferable to other institutions, but it's up to the receiving institution to decide the number and types of courses that may transfer. We recommend getting a course pre-approved by an institution before enrolling.\n\nTuition\n\nHow do Berklee Online\u2019s costs compare to other education options?

Morgenstein\u2019s unique and dynamic drumming style has led Rod to win many awards, such as the Best Progressive Rock Drummer award in Modern Drummer Magazine\u2019s Reader\u2019s Poll five years in a row. He has worked with such names as the Steve Morse Band and Jordan Rudess, but there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s best known for his work with 80\u2019s multi-platinum hard rockers Winger. The band released three albums before they wrapped it up in late 1993. Each member then went their separate ways to pursue individual goals. Kip Winger has released several solo albums. Reb Beach has worked on many projects and is now a member of the legendary Whitesnake. Paul Taylor did some commercials and projects, and Rod himself became an Associate Professor of Percussion at Berklee College of Music in Boston. He has also been doing different projects all the time. In 2006, Winger announced that the band would be back with the new album \u201cIV.\u201d Winger\u2019s reunion tour reached Finland last October, and then I had a chance to sit down with Mr. Morgenstein himself and ask about the latest news and have a look back at some good old times.\n\nTHE REUNION, NEW LINEUP, AND FUTURE OF WINGER?\n\nTo be honest, I was surprised to hear the new album from you guys after 13 years. I have to ask why just now, why this album wasn\u2019t released right after PULL, and what caused your breakup back in the day?\n\nWell, here\u2019s the thing: I\u2019ve been a professional musician for thirty years. I\u2019ve played with many bands, and the most fun group of guys to tour with is these guys. We didn\u2019t disband because we were fighting or enemies. It\u2019s because Nirvana came on the scene in 1991, and it was essentially over for everyone. Record sales went from the millions down. \u201cPull\u201d sold, and I think 300,000 records in America which by today\u2019s standards, it\u2019s like wow you\u2019re happening, but back then, you had to go gold at minimum. So, what happened was MTV had been pounding our videos from 1988 until the end of 1991.\n\nWhen we came out with \u201cPull,\u201d they said they would play \u201cDown Incognito,\u201d which was nice, but then they said, look, the alternative is in, and it\u2019s just time to go out to pasture. When MTV suddenly stops playing all of the videos from metal bands, it sends a message to the record labels, and the labels say maybe it\u2019s not worth pumping all the money into this music anymore. Then, everything happens at once. All the magazines are interested in Pearl Jam and Nirvana. We said, look, we had a great run. We have other things in music that we do, so let\u2019s just let it end on a high note and see what happens down the road. Kip Winger is one of my best friends, and I\u2019ve worked on his solo records, and then there are this Italian label, Frontiers, which for the last few years has been telling us we\u2019re one of their favorite bands, so when you\u2019re ready to do a record let\u2019s do it. So, the time was right, and we\u2019re all happy we did it. It was a wonderful opportunity to get together again. Four years ago, we got together to do the Poison and Cinderella US tour, which was a lot of fun. We just enjoy being together, and Reb is the funniest guy I know, so you just spend half the time laughing.\n\nWhat kind of expectations do you have regarding the sales of this new album?\n\nWell, we didn\u2019t want any illusions with this record, so we said, let\u2019s just do the record to remind people that Winger was a vital band and had something to say. And if all of our schedules line up and we can do some touring, let\u2019s do it to see how much of our audience is there, to see if it\u2019s even worth keeping it alive.\n\nDo you think this reunion is permanent and that Winger will continue making more albums in the future?\n\nWe\u2019re not trying to think that far ahead. We all hope that will happen in our hearts, but if no people show up to a show, then you know, how much can you bang your head against the wall? But I think that turnouts will be pretty respectable. We\u2019ll see. We have no idea if it\u2019s going to sell a few thousand or even fifty-thousand or more?\n\nWhat happened to Paul Taylor. Why he\u2019s not a part of this reunion?\n\nYeah, he\u2019s taking another path. He wished us all well. He was coming in and hanging out with us while we were recording. Paul\u2019s been very successful writing music for television. He co-wrote the theme for \u201cSabrina, the Teenage Witch,\u201d and he\u2019s making an incredible living off of that, and he\u2019s the one that wrote \u201cMiles Away,\u201d which was our biggest hit. He\u2019s now living in Nashville, pursuing a songwriting career. Yeah, touring is not something he\u2019s interested in right now.\n\nYou have two new members in the band. Let\u2019s start with guitarist John Roth. I know he has toured with you guys before, and he also plays on some of Kip\u2019s solo stuff?\n\nWhen Paul left the band after the second album, we auditioned not many guys, but Johnny came to us through our manager at the time, who was a partner with Bon Jovi, Skid Rod Motley Crue. So Doug was managing us for PULL, and John was involved that Doug was also with, and he told us that he knew the perfect guy. He said he\u2019s a great guitarist, a great singer, and he can also play keyboards. He was exactly what we wanted. One minute into jamming with him, we knew we didn\u2019t want anyone else. The record was done, and we were like, wow, we\u2019ll be touring. So the record was just me, Kip, and Reb.\n\nThen keyboardist Cenk Eroglu, he\u2019s originally from Turkey, right?\n\nThat\u00efs correct.\n\nHow did he end up being in Winger?\n\nYou know originally what happened was, this guy sent an e-mail to Kip saying, \u201cI am from Istanbul, Turkey, and you are my favorite singer, Winger is my favorite band. I have to work with you.\u201d So, I think he sent Kip some of his music, so Kip didn\u2019t want to just fly out to Turkey, not knowing what to expect. But, it turns out he has some fame in Turkey as a performer, but he\u2019s also a successful producer. Kip was actually blown away by some of the music, and then he made some trips to Istanbul, and the two of them were coming up to me with this incredible music that blended eastern and western culture. There were eastern percussion ensembles along with Kip\u2019s voice, so I put the drums down to a bunch of music. They worked so hard on it over two or three years, and in the final analysis, when they got an album\u2019s worth of music, they felt like they didn\u2019t quite meet their mark. So, they want to continue on that path until they hit exactly what their vision was. In the meantime, Cenk used one or two tunes for his solo record, so that\u2019s how that whole thing came about. Cenk played on the new record. He was in Nashville putting down records. But we couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt work out his visa issues for the tour here.\n\nI have heard the new album a couple of times now, and I would say that my first impression is that it\u2019s an even heavier album than \u201cPull\u201d was. Was that on purpose?\n\nYou know, that\u2019s such an easy question to answer. Well, you\u2019re a musician, right? Anyone wants to have a career in music, so in a perfect world, we don\u2019t listen to anything, and we just write music that is 100% what we want to do. But, when you do that, most probably never get a record deal because nobody knows where to fit it or how to market it, so it\u2019s too unique. What most musicians do when they want to have a career is listen to everything that\u2019s happening in the music business and say, is what I feel inside of me somehow compatible with trying to use some of the elements of music that labels are signing now to enable us to get a deal? I think that\u2019s part of how a lot of musicians end up getting record deals. A lot of musicians are into a lot of different kinds of music. My career has spanned so many different styles. I still play with Steve Morse and The Dixie Dregs making this instrumental fusion music. I play with Jordan Rudess, the keyboardist from Dream Theater. We have a duo where we do this over-the-top progressive stuff. I also play in a Jazz Is Dead band, which had Alfonso Johnson and people for many years.\n\nWe would do this jam band Grateful Dead kind of stuff. Then I would play with the bassist from Dream Theater and Ty Tabor from King\u2019s X to do this like power-pop so, what is the music that I love? I love it all! Whether, it\u2019s the heavy metal of Winger or the fusion of the Dregs. The fact is that the first two Winger albums sounded the same, and \u201cPull\u201d was a bit heavier, which is even heavier than that. To me, it\u2019s not that you at one time were doing something that you were not true to, and this is something that you are true to. It\u2019s just that musicians evolve. We go through a lot of changes.\n\nSo are you saying that Winger is heavy metal?\n\nMy career started the day that I got out of college with the Dixie Dregs. Nobody ever knew how to label us because we did rock and fusion and country, and they\u2019d say: what are you guys? We\u2019re just music! Once you put a label on it, everybody has a perception of what it is, and they start throwing the shit at you. Well yeah, most people would say that Winger is heavy metal, but if you hear \u201cBlue Suede Shoes.\u201d That\u2019s not metal. That\u2019s pop! And it almost has some progressive edges to it, but what about this other song? So, I don\u2019t know what to call it anymore. I just want to call it music!\n\nGOLDEN 80\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds WITH BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD\u2026\n\nBack in the 80\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Winger was often called one of the wimpiest bands existing. Why?\n\nYeah, well, I look at those pictures now, and I just laugh. I have great memories of it all, but some of it looks really silly. People have to realize that back then when we were doing it, all those bands were very serious about it. We would go to great lengths to have clothing made and our haircuts and having it permed. It looks funny now; it\u2019s kind of like when you watch movies of England where they\u2019re wearing funny hats. To them, it was very serious, and so back then, we didn\u2019t look any better. We look like a bunch of clowns! Back then, it was what everyone was doing. The audience loved it, and they were buying millions and millions of records, so something was working. I dare say that a lot of it. The guitarists from the metal bands were certainly way better than the guitarists that followed in the alternative bands\u2014Reb Beach, Andy Timmons from Danger Danger, etc. I could just go down lists of these great guitarists.\n\nWhat did you think about the character of \u201cBeavis and Butthead\u201d where they wore a Winger t-shirt?\n\nIt helped nail the coffin shut for our career. I remember watching it and laughing, then suddenly, I saw this nerdy, wimpy character, and he was wearing a Winger shirt. Not only that, but his parents wore Winger shirts! We tried to determine if we did something to the show\u2019s creator, like why he chose us. Out of all the wimpy bands: Winger, Bon Jovi, White Lion, Danger Danger. Why Winger? We were never able to figure it out. Yeah, that really hurt, but it\u2019s also very flattering. It means you mean something when someone chooses you to poke fun at.\n\nBeau Hill produced the first two Winger albums. How was it working with him back in the day?\n\nWell, Beau and Kip were best friends when they were teenagers. Then Beau was in a band called Airborne that had a record deal, but nothing really happened. Somehow, he ended up producing Ratt\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds first album, so he came on the map as a producer. He\u2019s the one that kind of secured the first Winger deal, now that he was a hot producer. He went to Atlantic Records and got us a deal, so he was the logical choice to produce the records. But what happens so often in the music business is you kind of live life, play your gigs, do your records, but you don\u2019t see eye to eye how it should be done. I wasn\u2019t particularly crazy about some aspects of the production, but many of the records were like that. I was just listening to \u201cSeventeen,\u201d and there are no cymbals! And the snare is the loudest thing, and it\u2019s even louder than the vocals.\n\nYou mentioned that he produced Ratt\u2019s first album; I think he produced five of their albums. There are not many cymbals there, either?\n\nIt\u2019s part of his productions. There\u2019s no reverb, and now when you listen to it now, it\u2019s wimpy. I mean, listen to that and then listen to \u201cBack in Black.\u201d For years, Kip has wanted a chance to remix those albums.\n\nPull was produced by Mike Shipley, and that album was something very different?\n\nWe know in some ways that it should have been the first Winger album. It\u2019s not that hindsight is 20/20. It\u2019s just that you kind of wonder: what if this came first? \u201cSeventeen\u201d is the song that put us on the map, and it also has the most jokes made about. The lyrics are stupid! But the music is very cool. It was just, you know, it was sex, drugs, and rock N roll back then. Many bands did songs like that, but that was the one that people made fun of.\n\nMaybe that song is the reason for the whole Beavis and Butthead thing?\n\nMaybe, but it also sold a million albums, so? \u201claughs.\u201d\n\nMEETING SEPULTURA, TOURING WITH SCORPIONS, PLAYING WITH ZENO, AND ALMOST WORKING WITH BLACK SABBATH.\n\nYou have been to Finland a couple of times before. Do you have any memories of those visits? Many people still remember when Winger played in a Giants of Rock festival, and your slot was right after Sepultura.\n\n[Laugh] Yeah, we will never forget that. See, bands like Winger and Sepultura should not be on the same bill. They have a much more hardcore audience. I remember playing \u201cMiles Away\u201d \u201claughs,\u201d and you don\u2019t play a ballad like that for Sepultura\u2019s crowd. They don\u2019t mix. There are a lot of different styles in the rock genre, and we talk about that. We remember that night. The sun was shining, and it was like noon PM-midnight. It was great. It was nice meeting the Sepultura guys because they were fans of the Dixie Dregs, so it was cool for me.\n\nI remember that once you played Finland with the Scorpions?\n\nYeah, that was in 1991. You know what? Scorpions were the first band that Winger ever played with. We weren\u2019t a band that played clubs and eventually got a deal. We were musicians that did demos, our record came out, and suddenly our first show was on tour with the Scorpions in America. That was in September or October 1988.\n\nSpeaking of Scorpions, I\u2019m going to meet with former Scorpions bassist Francis Bucholz in a few weeks. He\u2019s now actually playing in Uli Jon Roth\u2019s band, and we will see them in Sweden.\n\nHe\u2019s playing with Uli?! You\u2019re going to see them? Could you say HI! to both of those guys for me? I used to be in a band with Uli\u2019s brother, Zeno, so it was a real thrill for me. I auditioned for them in New York City, and Uli was there too. I played with them, and that was really cool. So, I moved over to Hannover, Germany, then went to England to do a Black Sabbath tour. But, back then, Black Sabbath was only Toni Iommi. Eric Singer was on drums and Ray Gillen on vocals. Dave Spitz played bass, and there was the keyboard guy, Geoff Nichols. So, we did a tour of the UK with them.\n\nHow was that tour?\n\nIt was good. It was terrific. Zeno was a great man. It was a comedy of errors that made that not happen. They had signed the biggest record deal in the history of music as a new band. That\u2019s how huge it was. I think EMI England, when they signed Zeno, thought that they would be the next Queen. We would drive around London and see billboards for Guinness Beer, and the next one was Zeno\u2019s new album. They were spending huge amounts of money on it, but it just didn\u2019t take.\n\nYou never recorded albums with them?\n\nNo, the record was just about to come out. They had three different drummers and producers on this record. I think that\u2019s what part of the problem was. It was just the three guys in the band, and they just kept plugging in new musicians and different producers, and they recorded all over the world and spent, I don\u2019t know how many hundreds of thousands of dollars on that record. By the time I got there, the writing was on the wall. I thought it was a good record, but who knows what goes on behind the scenes at labels? I\u2019m excited; the last show that Winger is doing is in Nottingham, the UK, at this thing called Fire Fest. It\u2019s a bunch of bands and one of the bands is called Fair Warning and the bass player from Zeno, when I was in the band, is going to be there. I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing him.\n\nHow about Black Sabbath and the album \u201cThe Seventh Star\u201d? You almost ended up joining the band in 1985?\n\nI think that was supposed to be a Tony Iommi solo record, and Glenn Hughes was the singer. You know what, it\u2019s funny; I met Tony and Glenn in Atlanta when they were recording that record, and that\u2019s where I was living. I was friends with Jeff Glixman, who I recently saw again at a Kansas concert in New York City. He used to be their producer. So I was living down in Atlanta in the 80s, and when Tony was recording the album, Jeff said, \u201cHey, you should come in and jam with Tony because I don\u2019t know if Eric will be able to tour with them.\u201d So, I went in and jammed with him, but I know I did a terrible job because I hate to confess this. I didn\u2019t know a single song by Black Sabbath.\n\nWhen I was growing up, I listened to Led Zeppelin, Jethro Tull, Jimi Hendrix, and Cream. Jethro Tull was my favorite. Back then, because I\u2019m very different now, Black Sabbath was too raw and basic. It was much simpler, like, you hear the song, and if you play an instrument, you can figure it out if you listen to it. Jethro Tull takes a lot more work. I was more in that mode of everything having to be complicated. I have really come like I\u2019m going backward in a lot of ways in my older age. Now, I love the more simple, all about the vibe music that\u2019s not just about the notes. So, when I went in to jam with Tony Iommi, I didn\u2019t know anything. Sure I may have heard Ozzy\u2019s voice saying, \u201cI am Iron Man,\u201d you know? That\u2019s all I\u2019d ever heard. Like an idiot, I didn\u2019t even think to listen to Sabbath records before going in. All I thought in my mind was, \u201cOh right; he\u2019s a rock guitarist. I\u2019ll just hit my drums as hard as I can and not even play fills.\u201d So, he was jamming, and I would start playing, and I had all these tom-toms that I wasn\u2019t even using. Then, after the fact, I listened to some records, and Bill Wards uses toms all the time. So, I was clueless, is what I\u2019m saying. I didn\u2019t do my homework. Maybe if I did, I would have had a shot at playing with him. I think Eric Singer was already coming in to do \u201cSeventh Star.\u201d Eric is a great drummer, a great drummer.\n\nHe currently does a great job with KISS and Alice Cooper.\n\nYeah, when Winger toured with KISS, it was with Eric. I was becoming very friendly with him. That was in 1990, fall of 1990. Because then we came to Europe in December and played with Scorpions until 1991.\n\nDIXIE DREGS AND JORDAN RUDESS\n\nHow did your first band Dixie Dregs originally start?\n\nI started in college. We were all music students. I also played keyboards and piano, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be a drummer or piano player. I was in an improvisation class playing the piano. I played with many guitar players and me like fifteen of them. And one of them really stuck out to me. He had long blonde hair, while all of the other guitarists had big fat jazz hollow-body guitars, and there was the one guy who played like a bastardized Telecaster with four pickups and a Stratocaster neck and Gibson frets, and he didn\u2019t sound like a jazz guitarist. The teacher was always yelling at him, saying, \u201cMorse, can\u2019t you sound like everybody else?\u201d And I said this guy is unbelievable. One day he came up to me, and we didn\u2019t know each other at all. He heard that I played the drums, and he told me his drummer had just broken his arm surfing. And he asked to fill in for some rehearsals while he was gone, and I said sure. I went into the first rehearsal, and they were doing Mahavishnu Orchestra covers, which was my favorite band; that band changed my band. I\u2019d never heard anything like that. So we\u2019re doing these covers, and we have an electric violinist there. Steve\u2019s songwriting, I thought I\u2019d died and gone to heaven. Here I was playing my favorite kind of music, and about a month or two later, the other drummer came back, and we started playing as a double drum band. But he was more of a meat and potatoes drummer, so he couldn\u2019t really play in the different time signatures. It just wasn\u2019t his thing. Everybody felt really bad, and we didn\u2019t know what to do. Eventually, he just said, this isn\u2019t my thing, and he left. So, I was the guy.\n\nYou guys have stayed very close?\n\nYeah, we have. The Dregs disbanded, and then Steve started the Steve Morse band, and he asked me to be a part of it. I did that for two records, and then Kansas reformed and asked him to join them. He told me he wanted to check it out, and living in Atlanta, we were all down south. I moved to New York, which is where I\u2019m from originally. Within a year, I met Kip and Reb when they were doing demos and getting rejected from record labels left and right: \u201cYou suck, you suck, no, no, no!. So it was just luck and timing. When I met them, I was up in the offices of a management company. Then, I was leaving, and I didn\u2019t know anybody was still there; Kip and Reb were using some recording gear. I expressed an interest in their music, and they said, okay, we\u2019ll put you on the list of the twenty drummers that want to audition. They called me a few days later and said, \u201cHey, do you want to get together and jam?\u201d Kip had left Alice Cooper by that time. He was doing session work at that time. He played on a Bee Gee\u2019s record and did things like that.\n\nI have understood correctly, lice wanted to change the band\u2019s direction, and that\u2019s why Kip left the band?\n\nI thought Kip just left on his own. They were terrific friends, Kip and Alice.\n\nHow about Jordan Rudess (Dream Theater). You guys have been doing different projects over the years. How did you meet him in the first place?\n\nWell, the Dregs were in the midst of touring in 1994, and our keyboard player wasn\u2019t able to do the last two months of the tour, and none of us had ever heard of Jordan. Until Dream Theater came around, no one had heard of him. He was recommended to us by Jan Hammer, the guy who also made Miami Vice\u2019s music. He\u2019s one of my favorite Keyboard players. So, Jordan sent us one of his solo records, and we were just floored by it. When he came down, we told him that he was in without an audition. Within three days, he learned the whole set just by listening to the songs. He has perfect pitch, he was a child prodigy, and he discovered his genius when he was nine. He came down to Steve Morse\u2019s house, and he played everything perfectly. He would also say things like, \u201cDid you also need me to play the bass line there?\u201d [Laughs] It was unbelievable! The first show that he played with us. We had rehearsed on Thursday, and on Friday, we played a show in Florida. In the middle of the show, the guitar, violin, and bass rigs went down. But, drums can play whether the PA is working or not. And the keyboard PA was still there. So, rather than stop, we just started jamming, and it went on for, I don\u2019t know, five or ten minutes. Everybody\u2019s rigs were then fixed, and we went on to the show. We talked about it afterward and decided that we had to do something together. So, we spent 1995 and 1996 doing the Rudess/Morgenstein CD, which came out at the end of 1997. Every year, he and I managed to do a handful of gigs. Just this past May, we played in Venezuela and Costa Rica. We played with a Brazilian band called Angra, a good band.\n\nThen we headlined in Costa Rica, just keyboards and drums! He is so unbelievable. No keyboard player in the world can do what he does. Almost the entire show is live. It\u2019s not like he presses a button to play a sequence. He programs the keyboard so the sustain pedal knows not to sustain the bass and leaves only the chords. Programs in pitch bends and stuff like that. We\u2019re in the midst of doing another record. We have a lot of it done. So he\u2019s doing that, and he has another Dream Theater and solo record that he\u2019s working on. So, I\u2019ll be doing some of that with him.\n\nI heard a rumor about Dixie Dregs and Kansas going on tour together. Is that true?\n\nThat I have never heard about, the Dregs manager is also the manager of Dream Theater. Actually, I live with him because I\u2019m a professor at Berkley in Boston. He\u2019s been trying for the longest time to get the Dregs out there, hooking us up with bands like King Crimson or something, instead of us doing the clubs\u00ef.\n\nSo that\u2019s not going to happen anytime soon?\n\nNo, it\u2019s not, but that would be awesome.\n\nWell, this will be the very last question. Will you guys be recording any shows from this current Winger tour?\n\nYeah, we were hoping to film a live DVD on this tour, but we\u2019re not good without Cenk. The photo has the five of us, and he\u2019s an essential part of the puzzle. We need to have the keyboards on many tunes plus another vocal because he\u2019s a powerful singer. Our agency is looking for a tour for us in the US where we would have Cenk, and then we could do the live DVD.\n\nThanks for your time Rod!\n\nFOR MORE INFO, GO TO:\n\nWWW.WINGERTHEBAND.COM\n\nWWW.RODMORGENSTEIN.COM\n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO STEFAN FROM ZINK MUSIC AND MIKKO SAUKKONEN FROM BONNIERAMIGO FOR SETTING THIS INTERVIEW UP !!\n\nMORE PICTURES FROM WINGER SHOW IN HELSINKI 2006 !!!"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/rod-morgenstein", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nRod Morgenstein was born on 19 April, 1953 in New York, NY.

Having seen the view from the top at two very different ends of the musical spectrum, Associate Professor of Drums Rod Morgenstein brings a lot to the table for his students. He became a poll-winning drummer as a result of his work with the legendary progressive rock instrumental group the Dixie Dregs (a.k.a. the Dregs), and later became known to teenage fans and millions of MTV viewers for his membership in the platinum-selling metal band Winger.\n\nAmong musicians, Morgenstein is widely known for his work with the Dregs. The band, led by guitarist Steve Morse, formed in the middle 1970s while Morgenstein and the rest of the band were students at the University of Miami. With virtually no radio support, but a great word-of-mouth reputation, the band became a force to be reckoned with. The Dregs received Grammy nominations for each of their last six recordings and much coverage in music trade magazines throughout the 1980s. Modern Drummer magazine named Morgenstein Best Progressive Rock Drummer for five consecutive years. He was recently voted Best All-Around Drummer in their 1999 reader's poll.\n\nHe has warm feelings for that era in his career and for the people that he met in the early days. \"I have this incredible feeling for Dregs fans,\" Morgenstein said. \"Some 25 years later, I still run into people who were behind us before we even had a record out. When we started out, we were in a car pulling a trailer and setting up our own gear after driving several hundred miles to a club. There would be 10 people in the audience, and five would leave screaming after the first song because they hated it. The other five would become fanatical fans for life who would invite us to stay at their homes--many times giving up their own beds so we could sleep in them. We established those types of relationships all around the country. Playing the Dregs reunion tour this past summer and running into longtime fans again reminded me of the influence that band had on some people.\"\n\nAfter the Dregs disbanded, Morgenstein continued touring and recording with the three-piece Steve Morse Band until 1986, when Morse took a gig with the group Kansas. Out of work for the first time since college, Morgenstein struggled a bit before surfacing as a member of the soon-to-be platinum-selling pop metal band Winger. Some progressive rock fans and critics were horrified. They claimed Morgenstein had sold out and joined a corporate rock band.\n\n\"I found that fascinating,\" said Morgenstein. \"How can you sell out in the music business? Nothing is a given. As hard as it was for the Dregs to get the message out playing instrumental music, for every band like that, there are probably a thousand rock bands. How many rock bands are lucky enough to even get signed--never mind sell some records?\n\n\"I didn't join Winger for the money, because when I started, we were only making about two hundred bucks a week. I went out with the band because my heart was in the music, and I was willing to give it a shot.\"\n\nWinger's success came after lead man Kip Winger and guitarist Reb Beach had struggled for years to get signed. As a favor, a producer helped them to get a small budget from Atlantic Records. The company pressed 13,000 copies of the first record. \"That's not the sign of a label getting behind a band expecting to make them huge,\" Morgenstein noted.\n\nAfter MTV started playing Winger's first video, the initial 13,000 records sold immediately. Within the year, the band's eponymous debut disc had sold nearly two million copies. Unfortunately, as the band became more popular, they started to become the butt of jokes as the heavy metal movement waned. Even the writers for the television series Beavis and Buttheadtook shots at the band.\n\n\"I don't want to name other bands and say why was it us and not them,\" said Morgenstein, \"but I consider myself to be a decent drummer, Reb Beach is a phenomenal guitar player, and Kip Winger is a serious musician who studied classical composition with teachers from Juilliard. If people would just listen to the songs on the record, I feel they would find some depth there.\"\n\nSince Winger, Morgenstein has worked with progressive rock groups like Platypus, featuring John Myung and Derek Sherinian of Dream Theater fame, and Ty Tabor, the guitarist for King's X. He is also part of Jazz Is Dead with bassist Alfonso Johnson, keyboard player T. Lavitz, and guitarist Jimmy Herring. The latter is an instrumental jam band that uses the music of the Grateful Dead as a launching pad for its exploratory improvisations. The project that is presently closest to Morgenstein's heart is the Rudess Morgenstein Project, a keyboard/drums power duo for which he has written half of the music. \"I have never written 50 percent of the material for any group,\" he said. \"This is new to me and is my proudest achievement.\"\n\nAs a teacher at Berklee, Morgenstein's reputation precedes him. \"A lot of the students who come to me are fans of the groups I've been in,\" he said. \"Some want to study the heavy metal style I played with Winger and others are interested in the fusion style that I played with the Dregs. I have written over 200 columns for drum magazines, and will soon have a book of drum set warm-ups published by Berklee Press, so there is always plenty to work on.\n\n\"Playing with Jazz Is Dead has brought a period of self-discovery. I have been pushed to find new sounds, new ways to hit the drums, and new grooves and fills. I pass that stuff on to my students. I like variety in life and in music. Doing all of these different things is keeping me young.\""}, {"url": "http://rodmorgenstein.com/", "page_content": "After years of noodling with the idea of creating specialty tools for drummers, to help with the handful of pesky issues all drummers face at one time or another, the first tool - Wing Thing - has finally come to fruition.
