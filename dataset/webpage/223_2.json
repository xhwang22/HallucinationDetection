He debuted on September 23, 1941, and played his final game on October 1, 1949. In a nine-season career, Kurowski posted a.286 batting average with 106 home runs and 529 Reserve Bank of India in 916 games played. Kurowski\"s childhood nickname came from his already white hair. A native of Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski overcame several personal problems. Kurowski overcame childhood osteomyelitis, which made him miss a part of a bone on his right forearm. His most productive season came in 1947, when he posted career-highs in average (310), home runs (27), Reserve Bank of India (104), runs (108), doubles (27), slugging % (544) and on-base % (420). An All-Star during five consecutive seasons (1943-1947), Kurowski exceeded the 20 home run mark three times to set a major league record for a third baseman (1944-1945, 1947), and hit over.300 three times (1945-1947). He also led the National League three times in putouts, twice in fielding %, and once in double plays. In four World Series appearances, Kurowski hit.253 (21-for-83) with one home run and nine Reserve Bank of India in 23 games, as the Cardinals were World Champions in 1942, 1944 and 1946. His only home run in the Series, in 1942, off Red Ruffing, broke a 2\u20132 tie in the ninth inning of Game Five to clinch the title for Saint Louis over the New York Yankees. He also appeared five times in the Most Valuable Player ballot, in 1942 and from 1944 through 1947. In 1949, Kurowski developed arm and elbow problems and his playing career ended. After that, he coached and managed in the minor leagues for 18 years until 1972. He gained induction into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame in 1988. In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \"All Time All-Star Argument Starter,\" consisting of five ethnic baseball teams.

Led by Joe Gordon, Charlie Keller, and Joe DiMaggio, they easily won the American League pennant that season, winning 103 games and outpacing the second-place Boston Red Sox by nine games.\n\nThe Cardinals had not had nearly as easy a time in winning the National League flag. As late as August 5 they trailed the Brooklyn Dodgers by 10 games. It wasn\u2019t until they swept a two-game series against the Dodgers on September 11 and 12 that they moved into a tie for the league lead. The following day, after dropping the first game of a doubleheader against the Phillies, St. Louis began a six-game win streak that gave them the lead for good. They finished with 106 wins, two games ahead of the Dodgers, to win their sixth National League pennant.\n\nThough the Cardinals started National League MVP Mort Cooper in Game 1, they committed four errors and lost the opener, 7-4. From that point forward, however, the World Series belonged to the Cardinals.\n\nAfter winning Game 2 at Sportsman\u2019s Park, 4-3, the Cardinals went to Yankee Stadium and picked up 2-0 and 9-6 wins. As a result, Game 5 presented the opportunity to conclude the series and hoist the championship.\n\nThe Cardinals started 24-year-old right-hander Johnny Beazley, who had gone 21-6 with a 2.13 ERA during the regular season. Beazley had been the winning pitcher in Game 2, scattering 10 Yankees hits and allowing three runs in a complete-game effort.\n\nTo oppose Beazley, the Cardinals sent 37-year-old Red Ruffing to the mound. A 19-season major-league veteran, Ruffing was a six-time all-star who had received American League MVP votes in four of the previous five seasons. He went 14-7 with a 3.21 ERA in the regular season and was the winning pitcher in Game 1 of the World Series, allowing four runs over 8 2/3 innings.\n\nRuffing opened Game 5 with a scoreless first inning before Phil Rizzuto gave him a one-run lead with a solo home run to lead off the bottom of the inning. Ruffing held that lead until the top of the fourth, when Enos Slaughter hit a solo home run to right field.\n\nThe Yankees regained the lead in the bottom of the fourth when Red Rolfe laid down a bunt single and advanced to second on a throwing error by Beazley. After Rolfe advanced to third on a fly ball, DiMaggio drove him home with a single to left.\n\nNew York threatened again in the fifth as Ruffing singled and the Cardinals committed two more errors. With the bases loaded, DiMaggio grounded out to Kurowski at third base to end the inning.\n\nThe Cardinals carried that momentum into their next at-bat, as Terry Moore and Slaughter opened the inning with singles. With runners on first and third, Walker Cooper hit a sacrifice fly to right field that tied the game once more.\n\nNeither side threatened again until the top of the ninth, when Walker Cooper hit a leadoff single up the middle. After Johnny Hopp laid down a sacrifice bunt to advance Walker Cooper to second, Ruffing faced off with Kurowski, who had struck out three times against Rudding in Game 1 and was 0-for-3 with three fly balls heading into the ninth inning of Game 5.\n\nAs a 7-year-old in Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski had climbed a fence and fallen, landing in broken glass. When the injury turned into osteomyelitis, an infection of the bone, doctors removed four inches of his ulna, one of two bones in the forearm.\n\nOn this occasion, however, neither Kurowski\u2019s misshapen right arm nor Rudding\u2019s previous success against him made any difference. His fly ball sailed over the left-field wall to give the Cardinals a 4-2 lead heading into the bottom of the ninth.\n\nThe Yankees made things tense in the final frame when Joe Gordon led off with a single and Bill Dickey reached on the Cardinals\u2019 fourth error of the game. However, Walker Cooper picked Gordon off second base and Beazley got pinch-hitter Jerry Priddy to pop up for the second out. The Yankees called upon George Selkirk to bat in place of Rudding, but Selkirk grounded out to second baseman Jimmy Brown to end the game and the series.\n\nFor the fourth time in franchise history, the Cardinals were world champions. Bookmakers and scalpers who expected the powerhouse Yankees to win the series reportedly lost up to $100,000.[1] It was the first World Series the Yankees had lost in seven trips since 1926, when Rogers Hornsby\u2019s Cardinals won the first championship in franchise history.\n\n\u201cBaseball\u2019s domination by the New York Yankees folded up and passed out of existence before 69,052 spectators here this afternoon as the St. Louis National League Cardinals, fighting uphill in the vast Yankee Stadium, became the new world champions of the green diamond,\u201d wrote St. Louis Globe-Democrat sports editor Martin J. Haley.[2]\n\n\u201cAny time you can beat a ball club like the Yanks \u2026 well, I just feel wonderful,\u201d Cardinals manager Billy Southworth said. \u201cIf I felt any better I wouldn\u2019t be able to stand it.\u201d[3]\n\nFor bringing the championship back home to St. Louis, each player received a $6,192.50 share of the World Series purse.[4] For many of the Cardinals, that doubled their salary for the season.\n\n\u201cGosh, I can buy that farm now,\u201d pitcher Howie Krist said. \u201cIt\u2019s 150 acres and it\u2019s a good producing piece of land. Money may shrink, but 150 acres will be 150 acres five years from now, just as it is today.\u201d[5]\n\nKurowski, who was down to his last bat after breaking all of his others during the season, kept it nearby throughout the postgame celebration, showing it to teammates, visitors, and anyone who showed interest.\n\n\u201cI hope my brother Ray was listening on the radio,\u201d Kurowski said. \u201cHe\u2019s a Marine down in Parris Island, South Carolina. I got a letter from him this afternoon congratulating me on getting into the World Series, but telling me I made him look silly by fanning my first three times at bat. I got even with him today.\u201d[6]\n\nAfter the 1942 season, Kurowski made five consecutive all-star appearances. In 1945, he hit .323 with 21 homers and 102 RBIs and placed fifth in the National League MVP voting. In 1947, he again finished in the top 10 in the MVP vote after batting .310 with a career-high 27 homers and 104 RBIs. Shortly thereafter, arm injuries ended his career and he went on to become a minor-league coach and manager for 18 seasons.\n\nAfter his breakout 1942 season, Beazley\u2019s career was interrupted by World War II. Before the World Series, he had announced his intention to return home to Nashville, Tennessee, and enlist in the Marine Corps. After he beat the Yankees in Game 5, the Marines recruiting office sent him a telegram: \u201cIf you can toss hand grenades like you pitch for them Cards, hurry up.\u201d[7]\n\nAfter three years of military service, Beazley finally returned in 1946 and went 7-5 with a 4.46 ERA. Ahead of the 1947 season, the Cardinals sold him to the Boston Braves, where he won just two games the remainder of his career.\n\nBeazley\u2019s counterpart in Game 5, Ruffing, missed the next two seasons due to military service, returning in 1945 at age 40. He pitched three more seasons in the majors, making his final appearance with the White Sox in 1947.\n\nThe 1942 championship marked the beginning of a five-year stretch in which the Cardinals made four World Series appearances and won three. In 1943, the Yankees returned the favor, beating St. Louis in a five-game World Series, but the Cardinals bounced back and won the 1944 title over the cross-town Browns. In 1946, the Cardinals won the World Series again, this time defeating the Red Sox in seven games."}], "Whitey Kurowski was a five-time All-Star.": [{"url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/kurowwh01.shtml", "page_content": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen was Whitey Kurowski born?\n\nWhitey Kurowski was born on April 19, 1918.\n\nWhere was Whitey Kurowski born?\n\nWhitey Kurowski was born in Reading, PA.\n\nHow tall was Whitey Kurowski?\n\nWhitey Kurowski was 5-11 (180 cm) tall.\n\nHow much did Whitey Kurowski weigh when playing?\n\nWhitey Kurowski weighed 193 lbs (87 kg) when playing.\n\nHow many seasons did Whitey Kurowski play?\n\nWhitey Kurowski played 9 seasons.\n\nIs Whitey Kurowski in the Hall of Fame?\n\nWhitey Kurowski has not been elected into the Hall of Fame.\n\nWhat position did Whitey Kurowski play?\n\nWhitey Kurowski was a Third Baseman.\n\nHow many hits did Whitey Kurowski have?\n\nWhitey Kurowski had 925 hits over his career.\n\nHow many home runs did Whitey Kurowski have?\n\nWhitey Kurowski had 106 home runs over his career.\n\nWhat was Whitey Kurowski's average?\n\nWhitey Kurowski had a .286 average over his career.\n\nHow many teams has Whitey Kurowski played for?\n\nWhitey Kurowski played for 1 team, the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nHow many World Series has Whitey Kurowski won?\n\nWhitey Kurowski won 3 World Series.\n\nWhen did Whitey Kurowski retire?\n\nWhitey Kurowski last played in 1949."}, {"url": "https://www.mlb.com/news/best-third-basemen-in-cardinals-history", "page_content": "\n\n\",\"providerName\":\"Twitter\",\"providerUrl\":\"https://twitter.com\",\"type\":\"oembed\",\"width\":550,\"contentType\":\"rich\"},{\"__typename\":\"Markdown\",\"content\":\"_Here is Anne Rogers\u2019 ranking of the top 5 third basemen in Cardinals history.

He won all five of his Gold Glove Awards with the Cardinals and is often considered one of the finest gloves ever at third base.\n\n\n\nBoyer was born in Liberty, Mo., and became a high school star in Alba. He signed with the Cardinals in 1949 as a pitcher, but during one game in his second Minor League season, the club's third baseman got injured. Boyer took over at the position, showed his hitting talent and never pitched again. He debuted in '55 and made his first of 11 All-Star teams in '56. He\u2019s the only Cardinal in history to have hit for the cycle twice ('61 and '64). In '58, he hit .307, the first of four consecutive seasons with at least a .300 average.\n\n\n\nIn Game 4 of the 1964 World Series against the Yankees, Boyer hit a sixth-inning grand slam to rally the Cardinals from a 3-0 deficit to a 4-3 win. Boyer and the Cardinals beat the Yankees and their third baseman, Ken\u2019s brother, Clete, in seven games that year.\n\n\n\nBoyer was traded to the Mets in 1965, but he returned to the Cardinals as a coach and Minor League manager in the 1970s, taking over the big league club from '78 until part way through '80. He died of lung cancer at age 51 in '82, and when the Cardinals retired his No. 14 two years later, Boyer became the only non-Hall of Famer to have his number hanging on the left-field wall of Busch Stadium. Fifty-five years after he left the Cardinals, Boyer still ranks third in home runs (255), sixth in RBIs (1,001) and ninth in hits (1,855) in the franchise\u2019s record books.\n\n\n\n\\\"\\\\[Boyer\\\\] wasn't a guy for show, at all,\\\" Mike Shannon, Boyer\u2019s eventual successor at third base, told Rick Hummel of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2009. \\\"He wasn't flashy.

Led by Joe Gordon, Charlie Keller, and Joe DiMaggio, they easily won the American League pennant that season, winning 103 games and outpacing the second-place Boston Red Sox by nine games.\n\nThe Cardinals had not had nearly as easy a time in winning the National League flag. As late as August 5 they trailed the Brooklyn Dodgers by 10 games. It wasn\u2019t until they swept a two-game series against the Dodgers on September 11 and 12 that they moved into a tie for the league lead. The following day, after dropping the first game of a doubleheader against the Phillies, St. Louis began a six-game win streak that gave them the lead for good. They finished with 106 wins, two games ahead of the Dodgers, to win their sixth National League pennant.\n\nThough the Cardinals started National League MVP Mort Cooper in Game 1, they committed four errors and lost the opener, 7-4. From that point forward, however, the World Series belonged to the Cardinals.\n\nAfter winning Game 2 at Sportsman\u2019s Park, 4-3, the Cardinals went to Yankee Stadium and picked up 2-0 and 9-6 wins. As a result, Game 5 presented the opportunity to conclude the series and hoist the championship.\n\nThe Cardinals started 24-year-old right-hander Johnny Beazley, who had gone 21-6 with a 2.13 ERA during the regular season. Beazley had been the winning pitcher in Game 2, scattering 10 Yankees hits and allowing three runs in a complete-game effort.\n\nTo oppose Beazley, the Cardinals sent 37-year-old Red Ruffing to the mound. A 19-season major-league veteran, Ruffing was a six-time all-star who had received American League MVP votes in four of the previous five seasons. He went 14-7 with a 3.21 ERA in the regular season and was the winning pitcher in Game 1 of the World Series, allowing four runs over 8 2/3 innings.\n\nRuffing opened Game 5 with a scoreless first inning before Phil Rizzuto gave him a one-run lead with a solo home run to lead off the bottom of the inning. Ruffing held that lead until the top of the fourth, when Enos Slaughter hit a solo home run to right field.\n\nThe Yankees regained the lead in the bottom of the fourth when Red Rolfe laid down a bunt single and advanced to second on a throwing error by Beazley. After Rolfe advanced to third on a fly ball, DiMaggio drove him home with a single to left.\n\nNew York threatened again in the fifth as Ruffing singled and the Cardinals committed two more errors. With the bases loaded, DiMaggio grounded out to Kurowski at third base to end the inning.\n\nThe Cardinals carried that momentum into their next at-bat, as Terry Moore and Slaughter opened the inning with singles. With runners on first and third, Walker Cooper hit a sacrifice fly to right field that tied the game once more.\n\nNeither side threatened again until the top of the ninth, when Walker Cooper hit a leadoff single up the middle. After Johnny Hopp laid down a sacrifice bunt to advance Walker Cooper to second, Ruffing faced off with Kurowski, who had struck out three times against Rudding in Game 1 and was 0-for-3 with three fly balls heading into the ninth inning of Game 5.\n\nAs a 7-year-old in Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski had climbed a fence and fallen, landing in broken glass. When the injury turned into osteomyelitis, an infection of the bone, doctors removed four inches of his ulna, one of two bones in the forearm.\n\nOn this occasion, however, neither Kurowski\u2019s misshapen right arm nor Rudding\u2019s previous success against him made any difference. His fly ball sailed over the left-field wall to give the Cardinals a 4-2 lead heading into the bottom of the ninth.\n\nThe Yankees made things tense in the final frame when Joe Gordon led off with a single and Bill Dickey reached on the Cardinals\u2019 fourth error of the game. However, Walker Cooper picked Gordon off second base and Beazley got pinch-hitter Jerry Priddy to pop up for the second out. The Yankees called upon George Selkirk to bat in place of Rudding, but Selkirk grounded out to second baseman Jimmy Brown to end the game and the series.\n\nFor the fourth time in franchise history, the Cardinals were world champions. Bookmakers and scalpers who expected the powerhouse Yankees to win the series reportedly lost up to $100,000.[1] It was the first World Series the Yankees had lost in seven trips since 1926, when Rogers Hornsby\u2019s Cardinals won the first championship in franchise history.\n\n\u201cBaseball\u2019s domination by the New York Yankees folded up and passed out of existence before 69,052 spectators here this afternoon as the St. Louis National League Cardinals, fighting uphill in the vast Yankee Stadium, became the new world champions of the green diamond,\u201d wrote St. Louis Globe-Democrat sports editor Martin J. Haley.[2]\n\n\u201cAny time you can beat a ball club like the Yanks \u2026 well, I just feel wonderful,\u201d Cardinals manager Billy Southworth said. \u201cIf I felt any better I wouldn\u2019t be able to stand it.\u201d[3]\n\nFor bringing the championship back home to St. Louis, each player received a $6,192.50 share of the World Series purse.[4] For many of the Cardinals, that doubled their salary for the season.\n\n\u201cGosh, I can buy that farm now,\u201d pitcher Howie Krist said. \u201cIt\u2019s 150 acres and it\u2019s a good producing piece of land. Money may shrink, but 150 acres will be 150 acres five years from now, just as it is today.\u201d[5]\n\nKurowski, who was down to his last bat after breaking all of his others during the season, kept it nearby throughout the postgame celebration, showing it to teammates, visitors, and anyone who showed interest.\n\n\u201cI hope my brother Ray was listening on the radio,\u201d Kurowski said. \u201cHe\u2019s a Marine down in Parris Island, South Carolina. I got a letter from him this afternoon congratulating me on getting into the World Series, but telling me I made him look silly by fanning my first three times at bat. I got even with him today.\u201d[6]\n\nAfter the 1942 season, Kurowski made five consecutive all-star appearances. In 1945, he hit .323 with 21 homers and 102 RBIs and placed fifth in the National League MVP voting. In 1947, he again finished in the top 10 in the MVP vote after batting .310 with a career-high 27 homers and 104 RBIs. Shortly thereafter, arm injuries ended his career and he went on to become a minor-league coach and manager for 18 seasons.\n\nAfter his breakout 1942 season, Beazley\u2019s career was interrupted by World War II. Before the World Series, he had announced his intention to return home to Nashville, Tennessee, and enlist in the Marine Corps. After he beat the Yankees in Game 5, the Marines recruiting office sent him a telegram: \u201cIf you can toss hand grenades like you pitch for them Cards, hurry up.\u201d[7]\n\nAfter three years of military service, Beazley finally returned in 1946 and went 7-5 with a 4.46 ERA. Ahead of the 1947 season, the Cardinals sold him to the Boston Braves, where he won just two games the remainder of his career.\n\nBeazley\u2019s counterpart in Game 5, Ruffing, missed the next two seasons due to military service, returning in 1945 at age 40. He pitched three more seasons in the majors, making his final appearance with the White Sox in 1947.\n\nThe 1942 championship marked the beginning of a five-year stretch in which the Cardinals made four World Series appearances and won three. In 1943, the Yankees returned the favor, beating St. Louis in a five-game World Series, but the Cardinals bounced back and won the 1944 title over the cross-town Browns. In 1946, the Cardinals won the World Series again, this time defeating the Red Sox in seven games."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Whitey_Kurowski", "page_content": "George John Kurowski\n\nBR page\n\nBiographical Information [ edit ]\n\nWhitey Kurowski played nine seasons in the major leagues, all for the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1940's.
