The US-American from EWE Baskets Oldenburg was the second player in history to break the 7000 point mark. Meanwhile, champions Alba Berlin and Bayern Munich showed no nakedness on matchday three.\n\nPaulding, the Oldenburg club idol, reached the milestone on Saturday evening at 86:69 (55:38) against the Fraport Skyliners Frankfurt with a three to 60:38 (22nd minute). The 38-year-old finished the game with 16 points and now stands at 7003 in total.\n\n\u201cIt feels good. When my career is over, I can look back on it with pride. I never dared to dream of making it,\u201d said the forward at MagentaSport. His coach Mladen Drijenjic was enthusiastic: \u201cA historic moment for the club, for the team, for the league. I\u2019m really happy that I was able to experience it and celebrate it with a player like Rickey.\u201d\n\nPaulding, who has played for Oldenburg since 2007 and won the championship (2009) and cup (2015) with the club, is still in second place on the \u201ceternal\u201d scorer list behind Mike Jackel. The former German national player ended his BBL career in 1999 with 10,783 points. The statistics only take into account the games since the introduction of the single-track Bundesliga for the 1975/76 season.\n\nJackel (61), the European champion from 1993, can no longer catch up with Paulding. As the BBL calculated, he would have to complete 278 games with his previous career point average (13.6) \u2013 this corresponds to 8.2 main rounds.\n\nBayern Munich take revenge\n\nAlba didn\u2019t give Telekom Baskets Bonn a chance on Sunday at 97:74 (48:38).

The Middle Hesse, who were only able to prepare for a good three days after their quarantine, were subject to ratiopharm Ulm 81: 106 (33:60). The Niners Chemnitz also lost their second BBL game.

He began his career at Kingswood school in West Hartford and then played at Marist (NCAA) from 2003-2007 being named MAAC player of the year in 2007 and led the NCAA in assists twice. He began his professional career in 2007 in Lithuania with top team Lietuvos Rytas Vilnius (Lithuania-LKL) and played a season in the then D-League with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers. He returned to Europe in 2009 and would play the rest of his career overseas until 2020. He was most of his time in Germany where he played 8 seasons for teams like the Telekom Baskets Bonn, Brose Bamberg and the Tigers Tuebingen. He also played in Greece with VAP Kolossos Rodou, in Spain with Gipuzkoa BC San Sebastian and closed out his career in Romania with BC CSU Sibiu. It didn\u2019t matter where he played but as some say that guy is a walking bucket, Jordan was a walking dime as he led the easyCredit BBL in assists 6 times and also led the top European league ACB in Spain in assists and in Greece and Romania. He was a three time BBL allstar and is the all-time easyCredit assist leader breaking ex Lebron James teammate Dru Joyce\u2019s mark in 2017 with his 1458th assist. He shared his memories playing against Rickey Paulding.\n\nThanks Jordan for talking to germanhoops.com. Where are you and how is life treating you at the moment?\n\n\n\nHey miles, I am in West Hartford CT where we have lived since I retried a couple years ago. Everything is good here and nice to be settled back home.\n\nYou retired from the game in 2020. You have made the next step in your life and are in real estate. How is that new challenge?\n\n\n\nReal estate has been really good so far. It has been a crazy market the last couple years but it keeps me busy and has a competitive side to it as well which I love.\n\nYou have been away from the game for 2 years. What do you miss the most?\n\nIt\u2019s not easy playing for 13 years professionally and then just stopping. I do miss the game of basketball. I especially miss the daily routine and competitiveness. It was a great 13 years but I knew my time was over once covid hit.\n\nRickey Paulding had his farewell game on June 4. What is the first thing that you think about when you hear Rickey Paulding?\n\n\n\nWhen I hear Ricky\u2019s name the first think I think of is ultimate professional. He just always seemed to go about his business in such a professional manner that all you can do is respect him.\n\nHave you ever seen a player that was able to play so well at such a high age?\n\n\n\nWhat Ricky did was so impressive because he was so consistent for so many years. It\u2019s not easy doing that but he made it look easy!\n\nWhat do you think was your record against him? Were you above or below 500?\n\n\n\nIf I had to guess I was below 500 vs him unfortunately but we had some good battles over the years!\n\nYou were 7-12. You were 7-5 with the Telekom baskets Bonn, but your time with Tuebingen hurt your overall record as you were 0-6. How do you remember Rickey Paulding the competitor?\n\nHahah the 0-6 def hurts. I remember our battles and playoff games vs each other when I was in Bonn. Ricky was the ultimate competitor and always showed up when it mattered. He would always hit tough shots when it really counted.\n\nYou had very memorable games against him early in your career. In the 11-12 season you were 2-0 and had 18 and 15 assists games. What do you remember from these games?\n\n\n\nI remember the 18 assist game playing in the old arena in Oldenburg. It was like a scorer getting hot and I found a rhythm and it just clicked. I was lucky guys made shots which is always key!\n\nIn the 12-13 season you lost a tough 5 game series to Oldenburg. What memories do you have from this series?\n\n\n\nThat was a great series. You know what sticks out was Kyle Weems having like 30 points in the first half in one of the games. I knew at that time that Kyle was going to have a great career!\n\nWhat kind of legacy do you feel will he leave in the EasyCredit BBL. Do you feel there will ever be another American that will reach his longevity?\n\n\n\nWhat Ricky has done and the respect he\u2019s earned from everyone in Germany will be hard to match. He was one of the best players, competitors and professionals the BBL will ever see.\n\nPlease leave some closing words for Rickey.\n\nRickey, congrats on an amazing career! You were always one of my favorite players and the way you went about it was something I always admired.
