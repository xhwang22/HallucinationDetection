Levin\n\nFred Levin was born in 1937 in Pensacola, Florida. He grew up in a conservative Jewish household, with his mother (Rose), father (Abe), and brothers (David, Herman, Stanley, Martin, and Allen).\n\nFred attended Pensacola High School, and then the University of Florida, where he met his future wife, Marilyn. The two had been married for 51 years upon Marilyn\u2019s passing on February 6, 2011.\n\nIn 1958 Fred entered the University of Florida College of Law. In the first few weeks of law school, he received news that his brother Martin didn\u2019t have long to live, succumbing to the end-stages of leukemia. Fred approached the dean of the law school, and asked for a few days away from school to attend his brother\u2019s funeral. The dean looked at Fred\u2019s poor undergraduate record, and told him that he could take the time off and that he didn\u2019t need to return as he never would make it through law school.\n\nFred drove from Gainesville to Pensacola to attend his brother\u2019s funeral. Ignoring the advice of the dean, Fred returned to law school where he thrived, finishing third in his class.\n\nLegal Career\n\nIn 1961, Fred began practicing in the law firm of Levin & Askew (now known as Levin Papantonio Rafferty, Proctor, Buchanan, O\u2019Brien, Barr & Mougey) in Pensacola. The firm was founded by Fred\u2019s brother David and Reubin Askew, who eventually would go on to become a two-term governor of Florida and candidate for President of the United States.\n\nFred began his legal career in family law, but once a client explained to him that her husband said he would kill her divorce lawyer, he chose to switch to general civil law. The first case that brought Fred national attention was Thorshov v. L&N. Dr. Jon Thorshov, a thirty-eight-year-old physician, his wife, his four-year-old daughter, and his one-year-old son were at their home in Pensacola when a massive freight train operated by L&N derailed near their home on November 9, 1977, and released anhydrous ammonia. The family attempted to escape their home, but were overcome by the fumes. Dr. and Ms. Thorshov died, and both children sustained serious physical injuries. In 1980, Fred received a jury verdict for the family in the amount of $18 million, which included the highest personal injury compensatory award in America at the time.\n\nAfter the Thorshov case, Fred became in high demand as a trial lawyer\u2014writing a book, lecturing throughout the country, representing politicians, and racking up multiple million-dollar jury verdicts. By the time of his death, Fred had received more than thirty jury verdicts in excess of $1,000,000 (six in excess of $10,000,000). He was listed in every edition of Best Lawyers in America; was a member of the Inner Circle of Advocates; and was inducted into The Trial Lawyers Hall of Fame.\n\nTobacco Litigation\n\nFred\u2019s greatest notoriety came as a result of rewriting Florida\u2019s Medicaid Third-Party Recovery Act, permitting the state of Florida to sue the tobacco industry for Medicaid costs in treating smoking related illnesses. After coming up with the idea and then writing the legislation, Fred approached a good friend who was the dean of the Florida Senate. The two then went to the Governor of Florida, who loved the idea. The dean of the Senate was able to get the law passed on the last day of session, during the last minutes of the session.\n\nAfter the passage of Fred\u2019s law, John French, a lobbyist for Philip Morris USA, railed, \u201cThis is probably the single biggest issue to ever have been run through in the dead of the night.\u201d Gannett News Service wrote: \u201cWhat they engineered was a first-of-its-kind bill making it much easier for the state to recoup money it spends for treating cancer patients and others with smoking-related diseases. . . . Its created such an uproar in Tallahassee that tobacco companies have pledged millions of dollars to fight the bill either by getting it vetoed or using the upcoming special session on health care to change or eliminate it.\u201d\n\nJohn Banahaf, executive director of Action on Smoking and Health, said: \u201cI could say, I think without exaggerating, that the financial life of the tobacco industry is riding on [the veto of the bill].\u201d Professor Richard Daynard of Northeastern University said, \"If [the bill] gets signed, it will be the single biggest blow against the tobacco industry and for the public health that's ever been done in the United states.\u201d\n\nChallenges to Fred\u2019s law made it all the way to the United States Supreme Court, but Fred\u2019s law was upheld. Immediately after jury selection, the tobacco industry settled with the State of Florida for a record $13 billion. Soon thereafter, Fred appeared on ABC's \"20/20\" talking to reporter John Stossel. While interviewing him for the piece, Fred lit up a cigarette, which ABC highlighted in the segment. Next, he appeared on two full pages of George Magazine, standing on his putting green in a tuxedo, drinking Crown Royal whiskey and smoking a cigarette. He was then highlighted in a Time Magazine article entitled: \"Are Lawyers Running America?\"\n\nBoxing Management Career\n\nIn 1989, Fred began managing the boxing career of Roy Jones, Jr., who had just returned from Seoul, Korea, having earned a silver medal in the 1988 Olympic Games. Fred knew nothing about boxing at the time he began representing Roy, but he battled against the established promoters such as Don King, Dan Duva, and Bob Arum to get Roy a middleweight championship fight against James Toney. Roy won the fight, and earned a multimillion-dollar long-term contract with HBO. Fred received the 1995 Al Buck Award from the Boxing Writers Association of America as boxing manager of the year; and received the Rocky Marciano Foundation President's Award in 2001.\n\nFred managed Roy\u2019s boxing career from 1989 \u2013 2003. Fred\u2019s last fight with Roy was the pinnacle of both of their boxing careers. Fred arranged for Roy to fight John Ruiz on March 1, 2003, in Las Vegas for the heavyweight championship of the world. Ruiz had recently defeated Evander Holyfield for the championship. Jones officially weighed in at 193 pounds to Ruiz\u2019s 226 pounds. Incredibly, Jones ended up winning a unanimous decision, becoming the first former middleweight title holder to win a heavyweight title in 106 years. Jones also became the first fighter in history to start his career as a junior middleweight and become a heavyweight champion.\n\nFighting Racial Injustice\n\nFred was a fighter for racial equality beginning with the Civil Rights Movement. When Fred entered the University of Florida College of Law in 1958, George Starke, the first African American student to enter a public institution in the state of Florida, entered with Fred's class. Fred described the first day as follows: \"They had all of us on one side of the auditorium and George was all by himself, except for all the Secret Service people. Up to that point, I had not thought much about racial issues. I looked over and my heart went out to him. Here were 350 white law students and this one black guy. He was dressed in a suit, and the rest of us were dressed like bums. They started shuffling him, which is rubbing your feet together on the floor like they do in prison. . . . I always studied in the library, and I would look across at George because he always had to sit at a table by himself and everybody would shuffle their feet. It just tore me up. I wanted to go over and sit with him, but I didn't have the guts.\"\n\nAfter the first semester of law school, Fred was ranked at the top of his class. It was then that Fred found the courage to approach George to become his study partner. One day Fred was studying in the library. George walked in, and everyone started shuffling him. Fred got up and walked over to George, and asked if he wanted to be his study partner, and George said yes. The two remained study partners for the next two years. When the law school was renamed to the Fredric G. Levin College of Law in 1999, George attended and spoke in support of Fred.\n\nShortly after becoming a lawyer in Pensacola in 1961, Fred nominated Nathaniel Dedmond to be the first African American as a member of the Escambia-Santa Rosa Counties Bar Association. The Association was so offended by the nomination that they had several of the wives call Marilyn, Fred's wife. They asked her how she would like to be sitting next to Nathaniel Dedmond's wife at a bar meeting. They were hoping to get Marilyn to go to Fred and have him drop the nomination. Instead, Marilyn replied: \"Oh, yes, that would be great.\" Fred commented that he had never been more proud of Marilyn. When the nomination finally came up for vote, the Association quickly voted against Fred\u2019s nomination.\n\nFred continued his efforts on behalf of the black community, and in 1999, he received recognition by being named a Chief of the country of Ghana, and receiving a citation from the U.S. Congressional Black Caucus; which provides in part: \u201cWe of the Congressional Black Caucus wish to join with the distinguished world citizens and other leaders in congratulating you on your designation as a Ghanaian Chief. But more specifically, we wish to honor your lifelong contributions to bettering the lives of the people of Ghana and the people of America. Long before we became aware of your outstanding contributions in Africa, we knew of your work as a lawyer fighting on the side of underprivileged people in America. We thank you for that rich legacy. We are proud that the world community is now beginning to recognize your valuable service to it as well.\u201d\n\nCharitable work\n\nIn the early 1990s, Fred gave the first professorship at the University of West Florida, in honor of his father.\n\nIn 1998, Fred gave the University of Florida law school the second largest cash donation ever given to a public law school, as of that time. In 1999, the law school name was officially changed to the University of Florida Fredric G. Levin College of Law.\n\nIn 1998, Fred contributed $2 million to the Levin & Papantonio Family Foundation. This non-profit foundation promotes individuals and organizations that care for and assist children with the basic needs of life \u2013 food, shelter, clothing, a safe home environment, and education.\n\nIn 2006, Fred gave the University of Florida law school an additional $2 million to help fund the Martin H. Levin Advocacy Center, which has become one of the top advocacy centers in America.\n\nIn 2013, Fred gave $1 million in memory of his wife to the Lubavitch-Chabad Student and Community Center at the University of Florida.\n\nIn 2015, Fred (along with his sister-in-law Teri Levin) gave $1 million to the YMCA of Northwest Florida to support the construction of its new facility in downtown Pensacola.\n\nIn 2016, Fred gave $1 million to the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition to help fund the institute's 30,000 square foot research facility in artificial intelligence, robotics, human-centered computing, agile and distributed computing, and many related areas.\n\nIn 2017, Fred gave $550,000 to the University of West Florida to establish the Reubin Askew Institute for Multidisciplinary Studies.\n\nIn 2017, Fred gave $2 million to the Brigham & Women's Hospital to establish the Fredric G. Levin Distinguished Chair in Thoracic Surgery and Lung Cancer Research. The gift was given in honor of Dr. Raphael Bueno for saving Fred\u2019s life after he was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer.\n\nIn 2018, Fred gave an $8 million home, including its personal belongings, to the University of West Florida. In honor of the gift, the school named its government department the Reubin Askew Department of Government.\n\nIn 2019, Fred gave 300,000 shares of Charlotte's Web Holdings, LLC stock to the University of Florida Levin College of Law. At the time of the announcement of the donation, the stock was valued at $6 million.\n\nIn 2019, Fred donated $2 million to Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to establish the Fredric G. Levin Endowment in Translational Cancer Research.\n\nDeath\n\nFred died on January 12, 2021, of COVID; after having survived stage 4 lung and brain cancer. He was asymptomatic for 10 days and died within 5 days of experiencing any symptoms, despite receiving the most advanced and best treatment available in the United States.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nFred Levin Videos\n\nFred Levin Wikipedia\n\nAnd Give Up Showbiz?

He attended the University of Florida, and decided to enter the University of Florida College of Law in 1958, taking summer classes to pull his undergraduate GPA above the 2.0 that was required for admission.\n\nAfter a few weeks of law classes, he was summoned home as his brother, Martin, was dying of leukemia. The law school dean told him that having seen his academic record, Levin might as well not return after the funeral.\n\nAt first, Levin and classmate George Starke, the first African American student to enter a public institution in the state of Florida, were the class outcasts, but the law sparked something in Levin and he quickly rose to the top of the class, then made a highly visible move of asking Starke to be his study partner.\n\nLevin said that on the first day of class, \u201cthey had all of us on one side of the auditorium and George was all by himself, except for all the Secret Service people. Up to that point, I had not thought much about racial issues. I looked over and my heart went out to him. Here were 350 white law students and this one black guy. He was dressed in a suit, and the rest of us were dressed like bums.\u201d\n\nIn the library, \u201cI would look across at George because he always had to sit at a table by himself and everybody would shuffle their feet. It just tore me up. I wanted to go over and sit with him, but I didn\u2019t have the guts\u201d until he asked Starke to be his partner one day. They remained study partners for two years.\n\nLevin graduated third in his class, then in 1961 began practicing with Levin & Askew in Pensacola, which was founded by his brother, David, and Reubin Askew, who became a two-term governor of Florida and candidate for president. David Levin had founded the firm after being unable to find a position with established law firms that would not hire Jews.\n\nSince established firms had corporate accounts, Jewish firms handled less lucrative and less glamorous cases, such as family law and personal injury cases, which were nowhere near what they are today. Fred Levin started by practicing family law, until a client mentioned that her husband had threatened to kill whoever her divorce lawyer was.\n\nDespite a fear of public speaking, he switched to civil law, where he quickly made his mark. Over his career, he had over 30 jury verdicts of over $1 million, six over $10 million. He was listed in every edition of Best Lawyers in America; was a member of the Inner Circle of Advocates; and was inducted into The Trial Lawyers Hall of Fame.\n\nGrowing up Jewish in Pensacola and often being on the outside led him to advocate for those who would otherwise not have a voice.\n\nAn expert marketer who believed that all publicity was good for his firm, he started a cable access channel, BLAB-TV, where future NFL Hall of Fame player Emmitt Smith was a cameraman while in high school, and MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough got his pre-politics start.\n\nLevin\u2019s first major case came from a woman who said her son died from aplastic anemia caused by the drug Chloromycetin. Researching the drug, he found that a significant proportion of those who took the drug had that side effect \u2014 or developed leukemia, like his brother, who had taken that drug. After Levin\u2019s victory, the formerly widespread drug\u2019s use was cut back to specific uses that are tightly monitored.\n\nIn 1980, he brought a suit against L&N railroad after a 1977 derailment in Pensacola led to an anhydrous ammonia leak that killed a couple and disabled their young children. After he demonstrated a pattern of negligence by the railroad, the jury awarded $18 million, the highest personal injury compensatory award in America at the time.\n\nAs his fame grew, he sought to purchase a home by the entrance to Pensacola Country Club, leading to a visit by some of his would-be neighbors, who tried to convince him it would not be fair to his kids to look over the fence at other kids swimming and playing tennis at a place where they could not be members because they were Jewish. Not taking the bait, Levin suggested that he planned to turn the property into a Jewish social club, after which a group of neighbors bought the home instead.\n\nHis biggest case was against the tobacco companies. Rather than suing on behalf of one client, whose illness may or may not have been tobacco-related, and determining which company would be liable, Levin thought the state could sue for Medicaid costs for treating tobacco-related illnesses. This way, the case would be based on smokers\u2019 illnesses in the aggregate, with responsibility based on market share.\n\nA change in Florida law was needed to pursue this avenue, but the tobacco lawyers would never let something like that happen. Levin wrote the Medicaid Third-Party Recovery Act, then had a friend in the Senate introduce and pass it in the last moments of the final day of the session.\n\nProfessor Richard Daynard of Northeastern University said, \u201cIf [the bill] gets signed, it will be the single biggest blow against the tobacco industry and for the public health that\u2019s ever been done in the United States.\u201d\n\nBlindsided, the industry tried to get it vetoed, then tried to get a special session called to rescind it, and then tried to have the courts overturn it. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law, after which the tobacco companies settled for $13 billion, a record settlement.\n\nAfter becoming even more famous for the tobacco settlement, Levin appeared with John Stossel on ABC\u2019s \u201c20/20,\u201d during which he lit up a cigarette, knowing that action would bring even more publicity.\n\nMark Proctor, president and shareholder at what is now the Levin Papantonio Rafferty law firm, told the Pensacola News Journal that the settlement funds went to efforts to prevent teen smoking and getting smokers to quit. \u201cThey credit that piece of legislation with saving tons of American lives every year. And I think Fred would consider that to be the pinnacle of his legal career.\u201d\n\nLevin also was involved in a suit against a member of the Ogden family in Louisiana, where a man was killed and his wife permanently disabled after Roger Ogden II apparently fell asleep while driving and crossed the median on Interstate 10. As Ogden was on state business, the state was found liable.\n\nIn another case, he secured what was at the time the largest judgment for a Black plaintiff in a liability case.\n\nIn 1961, Levin nominated Nathaniel Dedmond to be the first African American member of the Escambia-Santa Rosa Counties Bar Association. The association was so offended by the nomination that they had several of the wives call Levin\u2019s wife, Marilyn, asking her how she would like to be sitting next to Dedmond\u2019s wife at a bar meeting. They hoped for a horrified reaction, but Marilyn replied \u201cOh, yes, that would be great.\u201d Levin commented that he had never been more proud of her.\n\nShortly after the tobacco case, a representative from the University of Florida sought Levin\u2019s assistance in soliciting another person for a $6 million gift, which would include naming a building for the donor. After the representative quipped that for $10 million, they\u2019d name the Law School after the donor, Levin decided he wanted to do that, with some of his funds he earned from the tobacco case. The second largest cash gift to a public law school at that point, it was unusual in that the gift was unrestricted.\n\nIn 1999, the University of Florida Fredric G. Levin College of Law was dedicated, to a firestorm of controversy. Levin wanted to acknowledge the influence the university had on so many of his family members, but he also acknowledged that it was an in-your-face move to so many of his political and professional enemies, including the Florida Bar Association, which had tried three times to get his law license revoked.\n\n\u201cThe fuddy-duddies at the Bar had perpetually irritated me with their pettiness,\u201d Levin said. \u201cBig Tobacco provided the money. I was glad to give it to a school that had played such a big part in shaping my life.\u201d\n\nIn 1989, Levin branched out into managing the boxing career of Roy Jones Jr., who won a silver medal in the 1988 Olympics. Battling established promoters like Don King, Levin got a championship fight for Jones, which he won, leading to a lucrative contract with HBO. In 1995, Levin received the 1995 Al Buck Award from the Boxing Writers Association of America as boxing manager of the year; and received the Rocky Marciano Foundation President\u2019s Award in 2001.\n\nHe also managed Ike Quartey, a native of Ghana who became welterweight champion. For his efforts, Ghana awarded him the title of High Chief in a 1999 ceremony at the United Nations. At the ceremony, U.S. Rep. William Jefferson presented Levin with a tribute from the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nWith several fellow attorneys, he convinced famed lawyer Johnnie Cochran to lend his name to the formation of a national law firm, the Cochran Firm.\n\nIn 2014, a biography of Levin was published, with the title coming from his reason for not retiring \u2014 \u201cAnd Give Up Showbiz?\u201d The subtitle of five-time New York Times bestselling author Josh Young\u2019s book was \u201cHow Fred Levin Beat Big Tobacco, Avoided Two Murder Prosecutions, Became a Chief of Ghana, Earned Boxing Manager of the Year and Transformed American Law.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Levin was diagnosed with lung cancer and had a tumor removed from his brain, but the cancer had been in remission since then.\n\nWhen he tested positive for Covid, he was asymptomatic for 10 days, but died five days after the onset of symptoms \u2014 on the day that he was originally scheduled to receive his first dose of the Covid vaccine.\n\nWith a \u201cgive it now, while you\u2019re living\u201d philosophy, Levin donated over $35 million to various causes, especially the University of Florida and the University of West Florida. In 2013, he gave $1 million in memory of his wife to the Chabad student center at the University of Florida, which he believed was the donation of which she would have been most proud.\n\nIn 2015, he and sister-in-law Teri Levin gave $1 million to the YMCA of Northwest Florida for its new facility in Pensacola. The next year, he gave $1 million to the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition for its work on artificial intelligence.\n\nIn 2017, in appreciation for Dr. Raphael Bueno\u2019s efforts in saving his life after the lung cancer diagnosis, Levin gave $2 million to the Brigham & Women\u2019s Hospital to establish the Fredric G.

Would legal work dry up? Would there be widespread layoffs at law firms? To the surprise of almost everyone, 2020 ended up being the best year that many law firms had ever had \u2014 followed by an even better year in 2021. Per-partner profits at the largest U.S. firms rose 13% in 2020, according to Am Law\u2019s annual report, and close to 20% in 2021. Lawyers found themselves billing more hours than ever before under once-unthinkable circumstances, including working from home during lockdown and litigating trials online.\n\nAt the same time, the pandemic created enormous pressure for the services of legal aid organizations that provide free or low-cost legal representation. According to the HLS Office of Clinical and Pro Bono Programs, the number of inquiries from people seeking legal aid has more than tripled since 2020.\n\nIn the past several years, seismic events have intersected in powerful ways and contributed to huge demands for legal services, says Professor David Wilkins \u201980, faculty director of the Harvard Law School Center on the Legal Profession, a research organization dedicated to providing a deeper understanding of the rapidly changing global legal profession. He cites the global health crisis; a complex global economic crisis born of the pandemic and other disruptions including the war in Ukraine; and increasingly urgent calls around the world for social and racial justice, sustainability, and economic equality. Globalization, technology, and demands for social justice \u2014 significant trends before 2020 \u2014 became \u201cturbocharged,\u201d Wilkins says, by the pandemic and other events that year, including the murder of George Floyd.\n\nSeismic events have intersected in recent years and contributed to huge demands for legal services.\n\nAs a result, companies, government entities, and individuals turned to lawyers for help on things like the government stimulus packages that drove trillions of dollars into the economy, the wave of bankruptcies that took place during the pandemic, labor and employment matters, and the pressure companies have increasingly faced from stakeholders to take a formal stand on issues of public note.\n\n\u201cAll of these issues are landing on desks of lawyers in law firms, in-house legal departments, and government offices,\u201d says Wilkins. \u201cThe pandemic and related issues have highlighted the importance of law and lawyers \u2014 in fact, the rule of law has never been more important.\u201d\n\nCredit: Melinda Beck\n\nJ. Tracy Walker IV \u201990, managing partner at McGuire Woods, which has 21 offices in the U.S. and abroad, has experienced some of the trends Wilkins describes. While deal work and litigation were down through most of 2020, deal work picked up considerably toward the end of that year, and the firm saw increased demand throughout 2020 from many of its longstanding clients, particularly those in heavily regulated industries such as big banks and utilities, Walker says. And 2021 saw a \u201chuge uptick\u201d in many practice groups including private equity, health care, debt finance, securities, and employment litigation. The demand for the firm\u2019s services \u201cwas so high that we had significant concerns about lawyer burnout,\u201d he says.\n\nDemand for pro bono and low-cost legal services put immense pressure on the public interest sector as well. \u201cThe intense stresses of the pandemic \u2014 the fear, the isolation, the losses of jobs, routines, and people \u2014 were especially difficult for people in our client communities,\u201d says Esme Caramello \u201999, faculty director of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau and a clinical professor of law. \u201cPeople who were barely able to afford rent to begin with now really had no way to pay it; people with moldy and roach-infested apartments had to stay inside them 24 hours a day; tensions rose in already-violent relationships; co-parenting became fraught because of fears of spreading a deadly disease; and low-wage immigrant workers became even more vulnerable to mistreatment in the workplace when so little work was available.\u201d\n\nGovernment aid programs during the pandemic, including unemployment and rent assistance programs, were \u201cdesperately needed,\u201d adds Caramello, but difficult to navigate without a lawyer\u2019s help.\n\nAs levels of social and economic uncertainty rise, lawyers \u2014 both private and public sector \u2014 are increasingly called upon to help their clients and their organizations navigate those uncertainties to achieve their economic and policy goals,\u201d says Scott Westfahl \u201988, director of HLS Executive Education. In the executive education programs over the past two years, \u201cprivate- and public-sector lawyers have been sharing with us that they have never felt more stretched, or more needed, in their organizations. General counsel and law firm leaders are expressing that they are both exhausted but also proud of the impact they have been able to have in the past two years.\u201d\n\nThe toll it takes\n\nThough perhaps not facing the challenges of those most severely impacted by the pandemic, many lawyers nonetheless found themselves, at its height, working from home, supervising children unable to go to school, and dealing with health issues, their own or others\u2019. And even before that, the younger generation of lawyers, like other millennials, was already resisting long-entrenched elements of practicing Big Law, such as brutally long hours. Over the past two years, leaders in the legal industry have worried more about how to attract and retain top talent.\n\nIn particular, Westfahl notes, some of the partners he\u2019s spoken with have emphasized that they must address the \u201crecord attrition rates, burnout, and mental health and family challenges that working remotely imposed on their associates,\u201d adding, \u201cWhat we\u2019re concerned about is sustainability\u201d from a quality-of-life perspective. In the fall, Wilkins and Westfahl are launching a new HLS Executive Education program, \u201cLeading the Law Firm of the Future,\u201d where they will be providing frameworks and ideas for law firm leaders to adapt their business models toward what they are calling \u201csustainable profitability,\u201d says Westfahl. In other words, profitability must be reconciled with a healthy working environment.\n\nFor lawyers, the challenges wrought by the past two years give us \u201can exciting opportunity to be engaged in really the most pressing issues facing our world today,\u201d says Wilkins, who is vice dean for Global Initiatives on the Legal Profession at Harvard Law School. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a challenge because lawyers and law firms or legal departments have had to fundamentally adapt and change the way in which they\u2019ve always operated\u201d \u2014 primarily, by working remotely instead of in an office with colleagues, holding meetings online, and learning how to try cases and present hearings effectively via Zoom or other online platforms.\n\n\u201cUltimately, I think it\u2019s going to be an exciting time for our students and graduates because I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of change,\u201d Wilkins says. \u201cA lot of that will be good and exciting change \u2014 although, like all changes, it may have its painful and rocky moments.\u201d\n\nAs many companies and schools have returned to in-person life, Wilkins and others at CLP are examining which innovations from these past few years are worth retaining. Moving some aspects of the judicial process online, for example, can help to make justice more affordable and accessible. But does that mean all courts should migrate online?\n\n\u201cEveryone is really struggling to understand what this new world is going to look like, and there\u2019s no answer,\u201d at least not yet, he says. \u201cAt the Center on the Legal Profession, we are trying to do a number of things we hope are helpful.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s one thing of which Wilkins is certain. \u201cNo one,\u201d he says, \u201cthinks we\u2019re going to go back to the way it was in 2019.\u201d\n\nCredit: Melinda Beck\n\nAdapting to online adjudication\n\nFor a profession renowned for its resistance to change, the transformation from in-person to virtual legal practice was surprisingly swift. In April 2020, the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act authorized federal courts to hold civil and some criminal proceedings by teleconference. A month later the U.S. Supreme Court took the unprecedented step of hearing oral arguments via telephone.\n\nAccording to empirical studies, judges and lawyers report being satisfied, for the most part, with video hearings during the pandemic, says Richard Susskind, an international expert on the legal profession and author of \u201cOnline Courts and the Future of Justice,\u201d who collaborates frequently with Wilkins and others at the Center on the Legal Profession. On the other hand, online court proceedings were hard to access for many who don\u2019t have the needed technology, including elderly people and low-income populations. Online litigation rules were also constantly changing, and the courts were moving slowly in the online format, says Caramello, so getting an abuse protection order or child support, for example, was \u201cnearly impossible without a lawyer.\u201d With legal aid organizations stretched thin, online adjudication may not, in reality, provide increased accessibility for everyone.\n\nFor a profession known for its resistance to change, the shift to virtual practice was surprisingly swift.\n\nAs the world tiptoes back from the worst of the pandemic and returns to some semblance of normalcy, industry leaders are working to identify which aspects of their work are best done in person and which are done well in the virtual world, \u201csometimes even better than in real life,\u201d says Wilkins.\n\nLitigators at WilmerHale, an international law firm with 1,000 lawyers, participated in a number of virtual civil trials in 2020, according to Jamie Gorelick \u201975, a partner at the firm and deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration. \u201cI really like oral argument online. It has advantages that outweigh the disadvantages, but trials are tough,\u201d in part, Gorelick explained in a 2020 webinar presented by CLP, because it\u2019s much harder to manage witnesses during cross-examination when you\u2019re not in the same room.\n\nKathleen Sullivan \u201981, a partner at Quinn Emanuel and chair of the firm\u2019s national appellate practice, has engaged in a number of online appellate arguments since the beginning of the pandemic. She agreed that online oral advocacy offers some advantages. Having to fly across the country for a 15-minute oral argument is inefficient and costly for clients, she said in the webinar, and collaboration within a legal team, including sharing real-time impressions of the argument in order to make on-the-spot adjustments, is much easier online. Still, the advantages should be weighed against what\u2019s lost. A Zoom or Teams hearing simply can\u2019t match what Sullivan, quoting Susskind, calls the \u201cmajesty\u201d of the courtroom setting, which impresses upon everyone, including the litigants, that their case is important.\n\nUnderstanding the implications of that loss of formality also concerns Sanjana Parikh, a 2020 graduate of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, who, as an exchange student at Harvard Law School in spring 2020, took the Legal Profession seminar taught by Wilkins and Bryon Fong, executive and research director of CLP. The class studied Susskind\u2019s book on online courts, in which he argues that greater use of technology, including virtual courts, would greatly reduce case backlogs and improve access to justice.\n\nParikh, now an associate in the technology transactions and data privacy practice at Latham & Watkins in Washington, D.C., wrote a paper for the class that raised concerns about Susskind\u2019s proposal. While she isn\u2019t opposed to online court proceedings, she urges that their look and design be carefully considered \u2014 with input from jurists and lawyers (a point with which Susskind agrees) to retain the respect for the judicial system. \u201cThe visible markers that this is a temple or a hall of justice, a place where justice will be done, where people are treated equally \u2014 all of that, the black background on Zoom fails to capture,\u201d she says.\n\nSusskind doesn\u2019t propose a full-bore replacement of all in-person courts but argues that for many kinds of cases, online courts \u2014 where the judge, lawyers, and litigants are all online \u2014 make a lot of sense. But judges and lawyers have traditionally been resistant \u2014 until the pandemic. At least 160 jurisdictions have been running courts remotely since the pandemic started, he notes. \u201cI have no doubt that COVID has opened people\u2019s minds to new ways of working, and changed some minds,\u201d says Susskind, technology adviser to the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales.\n\nStill, he adds, \u201cIt\u2019s an oversimplification to say, without qualification, that [the pandemic] has fundamentally accelerated the uptake of technology.\u201d Videoconferencing has been used in some courts since the 1980s, he points out, and he sees today\u2019s online adjudication not as a technological breakthrough but as simply doing the same things in a different way. True technological breakthroughs in the legal industry \u2014 such as the use of artificial intelligence \u2014 have been backburnered for the time being because of the pandemic, says Susskind.\n\n\u2018The most exciting time in the world to be a lawyer\u2019\n\nWhat is safe to say is that as the legal landscape expands, many young lawyers are questioning the traditional trajectories of career success. \u201cThe market for top talent has never been as global or as transparent as it is now,\u201d says Westfahl. \u201cIn a global and transparent market,\u201d he adds, people \u201ccan vote with their feet and move to other positions where they are more likely to find more of the balance they want. What we are also seeing is that more of them are opting to start their own businesses, which is a lot easier to do now with lower-than-ever barriers to entry for startups.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think today\u2019s best HLS graduates are not only looking for meaningful work to do but also conscious of the overall impact of the institutions in which they are working,\u201d says Caramello. \u201cTo retain them for more than a few years, law firms will need to prioritize internal work on diversity, equity, and inclusion and reduce the work hours to give young lawyers a chance to build rich lives outside of work. They\u2019ll also need to significantly improve their structural support for pro bono and social justice work and think harder about what they might refuse to do on behalf of paying clients.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the emergence of issues around sustainability and social justice and stakeholders is being driven in large part because millennials and now Gen Z are ascending into top positions throughout every aspect of our society,\u201d says Wilkins. \u201cThis provides a space for new ideas and new approaches to solving what have been incredibly complex, intractable problems in our world, and a new energy around trying to find solutions.\u201d\n\nThis past spring, Westfahl and Farayi Chipungu, an adjunct lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, co-taught the first-ever Adaptive Leadership course at Harvard Law School. Adaptive leadership \u201cis particularly useful in times of uncertainty because it distinguishes between technical challenges \u2014 where expertise exists and you invest time, money, and resources to solve the challenge \u2014 and adaptive challenges, where the world is changing, and addressing the challenge requires a very different framework of leadership,\u201d says Westfahl. \u201cOur profession now faces many challenges that are much more adaptive than technical, such as how to create a more sustainable law firm business model, what the new world of work should look like, or how to make real progress on advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion across our profession.\u201d\n\nThe good news, he says, is that the disequilibrium in the system caused by the disruption of the past few years has enabled more people to challenge the way things have always been done. At Kirkland & Ellis in Chicago, for example, Jaisel Patel \u201920, who works in the area of mergers and acquisitions, works three days in the office and two days from home, an arrangement perhaps unimaginable at most big firms before the pandemic proved it was feasible. Though Patel says he is \u201cnot working less, necessarily,\u201d the flexibility of working some days from home makes for much better work-life balance. \u201cIt\u2019s been great,\u201d he says.\n\nWestfahl says he is \u201coptimistic that we\u2019ll see increasing progress on workplace flexibility, new business models, and greater advancement of women and people of color into leadership roles, in part because of the disruptions we have been facing.\u201d\n\nWilkins agrees. \u201cI tell my students,\u201d he says, \u201cthat it\u2019s the most exciting time in the world to be a lawyer because you can be part of these transformations.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.crunchbase.com/person/frank-mclain", "page_content": "Log In\n\nLog In\n\nAlgorithmic rank assigned to the top 100,000 most active People\n\nThe person's primary job title\n\nThe organization associated to the person's primary job\n\nWhere the person is located (e.g. Europe, Menlo Park, China)\n\nWhere the person is located (e.g. San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley)\n\nA Person's gender\n\nAlternate or previous names for the individual\n\nLink to a Person's website\n\nLink to a Person's LinkedIn page\n\nLink to a Person's Twitter page\n\nTotal number of current Jobs the person has\n\nHub Name: Name of the Hub\n\nCB Rank (Hub): Algorithmic rank assigned to the top 100,000 most active Hubs\n\nNumber of news articles that reference the Person"}]}
