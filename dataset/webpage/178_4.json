Billboard magazine described Davis\u2019s sound as \u201crhythmically rich\u201d with \u201cexpressive, honeyed vocals.\u201d Her cover of DiFranco\u2019s \u201c32 Flavors\u201d became a favorite on alternative radio stations, and her album drew a range of listeners with its mix of pop, jazz, and folk sounds. The release of a second album in 2001 called Fortune Cookies proved that Davis had staying power. Straddling the line between popular and alternative rock, she offered music with more emotion and depth than the teen pop ballads in vogue at the time.\n\nBorn and raised in New York City\u2019s Greenwich Village, Davis grew up surrounded by music. Her African American father, Walter Davis, Jr., was a respected jazz pianist, and her Irish-Scottish mother, Anna Schonfield, was a jazz singer. A life in music seemed inevitable for Davis. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve avoided going into this direction,\u201d she told David Chiu of UniverCity magazine.\n\nAs a young adult Davis absorbed the R&B of Stevie Wonder, the jazz of Charlie Parker and Clifford Brown, and the folk of female vocalist Joni Mitchell, all of whom she has credited as influences. She studied briefly at Mohawk Valley Community College in upstate New York where, with her love of animals, she considered becoming a veterinarian. In the meantime she learned to play guitar and started writing her own songs. Later she would joke that her only audience at the time was her dog, Homer. Fame was the last thing on her mind when a music-industry talent representative took an interest in her: \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for a record deal,\u201d Davis recalled to SonicNet.com. \u201cI made a demo tape with a friend\u2026 who sent it around to people, and somehow it fell into the hands of Elektra Records. It ended up being lucky.\u201d Recognizing Davis\u2019s potential, the Elektra agent called her in to develop her talent.\n\nDavis then prepared for her debut, polishing her songs and composing new tunes on her guitar. She worked closely with her producer and partner, Ed Tuton, but ultimately her journey was a personal one. \u201cMaking [my first] record was a discovery process for me,\u201d she told Rolling Stone. \u201cI went into it thinking I wanted to collaborate and find material, but somewhere along the line I realized that it was going to have to come from me.\u201d While she was creating Blame It on Me, Davis met one of her idols, R&B singer-songwriter Bill Withers, whose hits include \u201cLean on Me\u201d and \u201cAin\u2019t No Sunshine.\u201d Davis credits Withers for steering her down the right path. \u201cHe told me not to waste my chance,\u201d she told Rolling Stone. \u201cTo do something meaningful.\u201d\n\nBlame It on Me was released in 1997 and was hailed by critics as a shining debut.

Yet the biggest hit on the album was Davis\u2019s reworking of Ani DiFranco\u2019s \u201c32 Flavors,\u201d which got much more radio airplay than the original song. Although she was initially supportive of the cover version, DiFranco changed her tune when her fans resented Davis\u2019s success with the song. \u201cIt\u2019s only after [DiFranco\u2019s] fans started reacting that her feelings started to change, and that\u2019s too bad,\u201d Davis told SonicNet.com. \u201c[The cover] has done only good things.

She performed live with Ben Harper, Blues Traveler, and Ziggy Marley, gaining a reputation as a dynamic live performer with crowd-drawing appeal. Although Davis had some popular singles, her album was not a runaway success. \u201cWhen I came off the road [from touring for Blame], I was lost,\u201d she told Billboard magazine. \u201cI kept waiting for the album to take off, but it never did. During such times, I have to remind myself not to get lost in the despair\u2026. So, my inner voice gets louder and saves me.\u201d\n\nA four-year recording hiatus followed Blame It on Me, leaving fans to wonder where Davis had gone. She spent the time soul-searching, writing introspective songs, and looking for the next step. She came out with a second album, Fortune Cookies, in October of 2001, which she described to Billboard as \u201csimpler and more to the point, a bit more raw and urban.\u201d Fortune Cookies also grew out of her collaboration with producer Ed Tuton. \u201cIt\u2019s very natural working with him,\u201d Davis stated on the Elektra Records website. \u201cHe helped keep the songs pure. He has a wonderful way of helping me get to just what I\u2019m thinking and feeling. That\u2019s important when you\u2019re working with songs that are very personal.\u201d\n\nLooking for a fresh, spontaneous sound, Davis wrote some of the lyrics in the studio. With the song \u201cWhen You Became King,\u201d she drew upon the influence of her longtime female singer-songwriter idol, Joni Mitchell. \u201cIt\u2019s a particular fingerpicking pattern that I learned to copy from [Mitchell\u2019s] records when I learned to play back in college,\u201d Davis said on her website. \u201cIt\u2019s so fun to do. I wrote it without ever really intending that it become a song. I was sort of exercising and playing. It had a nice feel to it.\u201d\n\nFortune Cookies came out during a different time for female vocalists, when the songs of teen pop sensations were gaining more radio airtime than those of groundbreaking, independent artists. Davis\u2019s record company, Elektra, marketed her as an authentic alternative to the overproduced, \u201cmanufactured\u201d sounds glutting the market.

Her work as an educator \u2013 both at the university level and in the larger public sphere \u2013 has always emphasized the importance of building communities of struggle for economic, racial, and gender justice.\n\nProfessor Davis\u2019 teaching career has taken her to San Francisco State University, Mills College, and UC Berkeley. She also has taught at UCLA, Vassar, Syracuse University the Claremont Colleges, and Stanford University. Mostly recently she spent fifteen years at the University of California Santa Cruz where she is now Distinguished Professor Emerita of History of Consciousness \u2013 an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program \u2013 and of Feminist Studies.\n\nAngela Davis is the author of nine books and has lectured throughout the United States as well as in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and South America. In recent years, a persistent theme of her work has been the range of social problems associated with incarceration and the generalized criminalization of those communities that are most affected by poverty and racial discrimination. She draws upon her own experiences in the early seventies as a person who spent eighteen months in jail and on trial, after being placed on the FBI\u2019s \u201cTen Most Wanted List.\u201d She also has conducted extensive research on numerous issues related to race, gender and imprisonment. Her recent books include Abolition Democracy and Are Prisons Obsolete? about the abolition of the prison industrial complex, a new edition of Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, and a collection of essays entitled The Meaning of Freedom. Her most recent book of essays is called Freedom Is a Constant Struggle: Ferguson, Palestine, and the Foundations of a Movement (2016).\n\nAngela Davis is a founding member of Critical Resistance, a national organization dedicated to the dismantling of the prison industrial complex. Internationally, she is affiliated with Sisters Inside, an abolitionist organization based in Queensland, Australia that works in solidarity with women in prison.\n\nLike many educators, Professor Davis is especially concerned with the general tendency to devote more resources and attention to the prison system than to educational institutions. Having helped to popularize the notion of a \u201cprison industrial complex,\u201d she now urges her audiences to think seriously about the future possibility of a world without prisons and to help forge a 21st-century abolitionist movement."}, {"url": "https://www.discogs.com/es/artist/301303-Alana-Davis", "page_content": "Nombre real:\n\nAlana Davis\n\nPerfil:\n\nBorn May 6, 1974 in New York City.

The pieces she selects are transformed by her pure, warm tone and her emotional vibrato, together with their light and breezy jazz and funk arrangements. \u201cBefore you know it, regardless of whatever category the tune was at its inception, it is a Randy Crawford song,\u201d wrote Sonia Murray in Atlanta Journal and Constitution, describing the \u201crefashioning\u201d that happens when Crawford interprets a song.\n\nCrawford has toured extensively throughout the world, performed at Europe\u2019s best known jazz fests and shared stage with renowned jazz artists like Ray Charles, Al Jarreau, and Joe Sample. Some of her most memorable live performances took place in unusual places such as the Vatican and the Kremlin, at a United Nations benefit concert in Croatia, or a benefit show for Nelson Mandela in South Africa. Despite this apparent globe-trotting, though, she isn\u2019t a flashy performer. On stage, she rarely speaks and she moves about very little. Her showmanship seems completely internalized, something displayed in every note she sings. Randy Crawford is not a performer to be seen, she is a singer who has to be heard.\n\nCrawford grew up with five brothers and sisters in Cincinnati, Ohio. Her parents loved singing themselves and encouraged all their children to sing at home and in the church choir. Asked about early influences, Crawford told Vercelly, \u201cAretha Franklin was the only person who really touched me deeply as a child.\u201d She especially liked Franklin\u2019s early recordings made for the Columbia label before she became a star with Atlantic. By the time she was 15, Crawford wassinging in night clubs in the United States and Europe with her father acting as her chaperon. Soon she learned to read music and play piano, performed in a group with bassist William \u201cBootsy\u201d Collins, and later in a jazz band. When she was 20, she released her first single \u201cIf You Say the Word.\u201d\n\nWithin a few years the young singer had shared stages with famous jazz musicians such as Cannonball Adderley, George Benson, and Quincy Jones. According to Vercelly, the late Cannonball Adderley especially valued Crawford\u2019s \u201crare ability to wed strength and emotion in a natural, spontaneous manner\u201d and in 1975, he selected her for the role of Carolina in the folk musical Big Man: The Legend of John Henry\u2014 Crawford\u2019s first exposure to a national audience. In the same year, Crawford took the stage in front of 5000 jazz enthusiasts at the World Jazz Association\u2019s (W.J.A.) annual fund raiser at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Accompanied by an orchestra directed by Quincy Jones, Crawford interpreted\u2014at Jones\u2019s request\u2014Bernard Igner\u2019s \u201cEverything Must Change,\u201d the lyrics of which she had seen for the first time only one day before the event. In 1976, Crawford\u2019s first album, Everything Must Change, was released by Warner Bros. It contained two live recordings from the W.J.A. concert, including the title track, as well as studio recordings in styles ranging from soul to country, by composers such as Lennon/McCartney, Paul Simon, and Keith Carradine, all newly arranged by Larry Carlton of the renowned jazz band Crusaders.\n\nCrawford\u2019s second album, 1978\u2019s Miss Randy Crawford, was also primarily a collection of cover versions of recent hits, leading Downbeat\u2019s reviewer to comment \u201cas if Randy Crawford was still back there interpreting and needing other people\u2019s songs,\u201d hoping Crawford\u2019s next album would be \u201cher own totally.\u201d However, like many reviewers in the meantime, this attitude expressed a deep misunderstanding of Crawford\u2019s true gift\u2014to give a second life to every song she takes on.\n\nWhen the popular instrumental jazz group Crusaders were looking for a vocalist to perform with them for the first time, Bob Krasnow, vice-president of talent at Warner Bros., suggested Randy Crawford. \u201cStreet Life,\u201d the title track of the Crusader\u2019s MCA album, became Crawford\u2019s first international hit. In 1979, she toured the United States and Europe with the group; Crawford opened the show with own recordings and joined the Crusaders at the end of the group\u2019s show to sing \u201cStreet Life.\u201d\n\nWith her early 1980s albums Secret Combination and Night-Line, Crawford\u2019s music became funkier, livelier; however, smooth soul ballads still remained her hallmark, songs like \u201cOne Day I\u2019ll Fly Away\u201d from 1980, and \u201cAlmaz,\u201d featured on her 1986 album Abstract Emotions. Crawford went on three world tours to promote her albums, playing a number of sold-out concerts. Her 1989 album Rich and Poorwas one of the United States\u2019 most popular jazz albums for almost a year. Its first single, a cover of Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cKnockin\u2019 On Heaven\u2019s Door\u201d became a hit and was used on the soundtrack of the movie Lethal Weapon 2.\n\nCrawford started the 1990s with two noteworthy live performances. One was at the Kremlin in 1990, with Italian superstar Zuccero whose duet with Crawford, \u201cDiamante,\u201d became a hit single in Germany. The other was a Christmas concert for Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in 1991. Crawford\u2019s last albums for Warner Brothers were Through The Eyes Of Love and Don\u2019t Say It\u2019s Over.\n\nAfter experiencing difficulties with America record companies who didn\u2019t know what to do with an artist who wasn\u2019t limited to either the jazz or R&B domain, Crawford got off to a new start in Europe. There the singer had instant success with the album Naked and True, released by WEA Germany. Produced by Germany based Ralf Droesemeyer, the record saw Crawford return to her jazzy soul sound of the 1970s. The initial Naked and True tour took Crawford through Europe and South America. The \u201cimport,\u201d especially Crawford\u2019s haunting interpretation of J.J. Cale\u2019s song \u201cCajun Moon,\u201d soon won the hearts of jazz and adult contemporary station listeners in the United States. As a result the Atlantic label, Bluemoon, reissued and distributed the album in the United States. In addition to covers of the Patrice Rushen hit \u201cForget Me Nots\u201d and the Prince classic \u201cPurple Rain,\u201d it included a cover of George Benson\u2019s multi-format hit \u201cGive Me the Night,\u201d which became number one on Smooth Jazz/National AC radio charts. The album remained in the top ten on R&R\u2019s NAC album charts for 20 consecutive weeks. 250,000 copies of Naked and True were sold in the United States and over half a million worldwide. Awash in newfound popularity, Crawford hit the road again and toured extensively all over the world.\n\nIn 1996, in the wake of Crawford\u2019s second wave of success, Warner Bros, released Best Of Randy Crawford with 14 of Crawford\u2019s greatest hits from 1976-95. Crawford\u2019s comeback won her new fans\u2014not only those who grew up with black music classics of the sixties and seventies, but also younger people into acid jazz, retro funk and groove samplers.\n\nCrawford\u2019s 1998 album Every Kind of Mood\u2014Randy, Randi, Randee contained an updated remake of \u201cAlmaz\u201d, one of Crawford\u2019s biggest international hits, as well as covers of trip-hop pioneers Massive Attack\u2019s \u201cHymn of the Big Wheel\u201d and Rose Royce\u2019s classic ballad \u201cWishing on a Star.\u201d The album was produced by Mousse T. who had worked on tracks by Prince, U2, Michael Jackson, and Jens Krause, who gave \u201cGive Me The Night\u201d its great sound. Mario Tarradell, reviewing the album for the Dallas Morning News, called Crawford a \u201csong stylist\u201d who \u201ccan sing anything with elegance, emotion and warmth.\u201d And that\u2019s all Crawford intends to do in the future. \u201cI will always sing,\u201d she told her new record company Atlantic in 1998. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything else.\u201d In the late 1990s, Crawford resided in Europe, enjoying the star-status that her native land refused her.\n\nSingles\n\n\u201cAre You Sure,\u201d 1997.\n\n\u201cGive Me the Night,\u201d 1997.\n\n\u201cSilence,\u201d 1998.\n\nAlbums\n\nEverything Must Change, Warner Bros., 1976, reissued, Musicrama, 1997.\n\nMiss Randy Crawford, Warner Bros., 1978.\n\nNow We May Begin, (includes \u201cOne Day I\u2019ll Fly Away\u201d), 1980, reissued, Musicrama, 1997.\n\nSecret Combination, Warner Bros., 1981, reissued Wea/Warner Bros., 1987.\n\nNightline, 1983, reissued, 1994, reissued, Musicrama, 1997\n\nAbstract Emotions, 1986, reissued, Wea, 1994, reissued, Musicrama, 1997.\n\nRich And Poor, (Includes \u201cKnockin\u2019 On Heaven\u2019s Door\u201d), Wea/Warner Bros., 1989.\n\nThrough The Eyes Of Love, Wea/Warner Bros., 1992.\n\nDon\u2019t Say It\u2019s Over, Wea/Warner Bros., 1993.\n\nVery Best of Randy Crawford, Fly, 1993, reissued, 1999.\n\nNaked And True, (includes \u201cGive Me the Night\u201d) WEA/Atlantic, 1995.\n\nBest Of Randy Crawford, Wea/Warner Bros., 1996.\n\nRaw Silk, Musicrama, 1997.\n\nEvery Kind of Mood \u2014Randy, Randi, Randee, Wea/Atlantic, 1998.\n\nLove Songs, Wea, 1998.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nAtlanta Journal and Constitution, January 29, 1998, p.

Davis achieved a radio hit with the single \"32 Flavors\" from her debut album. The song is a cover version of a track written and previously recorded by Ani DiFranco. Blame It on Me stayed on the Billboard Top 200 for seven weeks, peaking at #157 in February 1998 and reaching sales of over 240,000 in the United States. \"Murder\", also from Blame It on Me, was sampled on Jay-Z's Vol. 3...

Both DiFranco and her music can be described as punk, honest, powerful, unapologetic, and at times, even jarring. DiFranco launched her music career at the age of 14. Four years later, she started her own label, Righteous Babe Records, which has allowed her to answer to no one but herself.\n\nAlthough she has enjoyed some commercial success with songs featured in major movies, DiFranco is an indie artist at heart. Constant college tours built her a following from the ground up, and even as her music eventually reached the masses through magazine exposure and coverage on MTV and VH1, she stayed true to herself and her fanbase by remaining on her own label, which became successful enough to sign other artists such as Andrew Bird.\n\nDiFranco\u2019s music also embodies her commitment to social activism. Her lyrics are raw, often blunt, and she uses both her art and her platform to support causes she believes in. Most important, DiFranco offers an unabashed honesty in her music, and her fans feel connected through her intimate revelations. With all these qualities in mind, here are the 11 best Ani DiFranco songs.\n\n11. \u201cSwan Dive\u201d\n\nNestled in the second half of DiFranco\u2019s ninth studio album, Little Plastic Castle, \u201cSwan Dive\u201d is a slow and uneasy build up to a steady beat. The staccato introduction that repeats throughout the verses holds its own in contrast to the regularity of the chorus. DiFranco\u2019s rhythmic push/pull, which mimics the lyrical dynamics, creates a palpable tension that leaves the listener cheering for the narrator, while also worrying for her safety. As DiFranco sings, \u201cGravity is nothing to me, I\u2019m moving at the speed of sound, I\u2019m just going to get my feet wet, until I drown,\u201d one wonders if she needs permission to fly or someone to protect her from herself.\n\n10. \u201cShameless\u201d\n\n\u201cShameless\u201d appears on DiFranco\u2019s seventh and most critically acclaimed album, Dilate. When she wrote and recorded this song in 1996, bisexuality was hardly recognized, let alone discussed in pop music. Her lyrics as always are unapologetic, and the driving beat and almost-growling delivery of the words let the listener know that DiFranco is not interested in anyone\u2019s opinions or criticism. As she sings about coveting another man\u2019s wife, she delivers the lines, \u201cJust please don\u2019t name this / Please don\u2019t explain this / Just blame it all on me / Say I was shameless.\u201d Ever the outsider, DiFranco offers no apologies for herself and doesn\u2019t feel she owns anyone. This song inspired many of her contemporaries and successors to follow suit.\n\n9. \u201cAs Is\u201d\n\nWhile DiFranco has a strong and gritty voice, she also has a softer, melodic side that shines on this track from Little Plastic Castle. The accompaniment is stripped down to acoustic guitar with light percussion and brush drums, underscoring a simple message of acceptance. Lest anyone think this song is proof that DiFranco has lost her edge, as she sweetly sings about catching her beloved in a lie, she dips back into a direct and cutting lyric: \u201cJust give up and admit you\u2019re an asshole / You would be in some good company.\u201d Her almost breathy delivery shows a more vulnerable side of her voice that reminds the listener that DIFranco is still as human as ever.\n\n8. \u201cGarden of Simple\u201d\n\nIn 2001, DiFranco released the double album Revelling/Reckoning. \u201cGarden of Simple\u201d the third track, opens with a syncopated guitar melody, played with one of DiFranco\u2019s alternate tunings, that allows her to provide a bass line without featuring any other instruments. The double album is mostly acoustic and full of socially conscious narratives, including this retelling of a dream. All of the lyrics are written lower case, much like an E. E. Cummings poem, and while DiFranco\u2019s signature voice conveys deeply personal lyrics, the double album looks beyond interpersonal relationships and offer her fears for the planet and society. She sings, \u201cScience chases money and money chases its tail / And the best minds of my generation can\u2019t make bail.\u201d Revelling/Reckoning was released in April, just five months before September 11, and one can\u2019t help but marvel at how prescient they really were.\n\n7. \u201cAngry Anymore\u201d\n\nThis sweet American anthem opens with a melodic banjo tune that carries throughout the entire song. Sandwiched between the psychedelic \u201cAngel Food\u201d and the torch song \u201cEverest\u201d on DiFranco\u2019s 1999 album, Up Up Up Up Up Up, \u201cAngry Anymore\u201d provides an uptempo inspiration to understand the motivations of those who raised us and to help us let go of our youthful baggage. DiFranco appears to side with her father in these lyrics, which would give any mother pause to hear: \u201cBut now I\u2019ve seen both my parents / Play out the hands they were dealt / And as each year goes by / I know more about how my father must have felt.\u201d\n\n6. \u201c32 Flavors\u201d\n\nMany came to know DiFranco\u2019s music through Alana Davis\u2019 cover of this song in 1997. But while it gave DiFranco more mainstream success than her previous work, the constraints of pop radio forced Davis to jettison some of DiFranco\u2019s more poignant verses. Conversely, Davis added her own chorus when she recorded the song, and isn\u2019t typically credited with the changes. Without the original recording, one misses these goose bump-inducing lines: \u201cAnd god help you if you are a phoenix / And you dare to rise up from the ash / A thousand eyes will smolder with jealousy / While you are just flying past.\u201d\n\n5. \u201cGravel\u201d\n\nFirst recorded for Little Plastic Castle , subsequently recorded live on Living In Clip , and eventually included on the retrospective 2007 album, Canon, \u201cGravel\u201d is the quintessential DiFranco song\u2014uneasy, aggressive, and punctuated, while still anthemic. Once again, the listener is torn between cheering her on or warning her against doing something foolish as she sings, \u201cYou were never a good lay / And you were never a good friend / But oh, what can I say / I adore you.\u201d In youth one may lean toward cheering, but older listeners beg her to send the motorcyclist on his merry way.\n\n4. \u201cDilate\u201d\n\nThe title track from DiFranco\u2019s seventh studio album utilizes one of her alternate tunings, allowing her to slap bass notes while maintaining arpeggiated guitar chords. In spite of being the title track of her 1996 LP, DiFranco uses the word \u201cdilate\u201d exactly one time in the lyrics. While dilate typically means to make larger, the less-frequently used definition refers to speaking at length, which is precisely what DiFranco does here. She packs an impressive number of words into four and a half minutes, while detailing why being alone is preferable to being with someone who constantly disappoints you. \u201cI see you and I\u2019m so unsatisfied. I see you and I dilate.\u201d\n\n3. \u201cUntouchable Face\u201d\n\nThe opening track to Dilate must be quite a shock for a first-time listener. As the melodic and bittersweet lyrics begin, DiFranco details unrequited love, \u201cThink I\u2019m going for a walk now / I feel a little unsteady / I don\u2019t want no one to follow me /Except maybe you,\u201d no one could possibly anticipate the similarly phrased yet jarring interjection of the chorus: \u201cSo fuck you, and your untouchable face / Fuck you, for existing in the first place.\u201d After the initial surprise wears off, however, the listener is aware that this is classic DiFranco. It\u2019s startling to untested ears, but perfectly consistent with the folk singer\u2019s message.\n\n2. \u201cShy\u201d\n\nFrom DiFranco\u2019s sixth studio album, Not a Pretty Girl, which continued her pattern of using only guitar and percussion, \u201cShy\u201d is an unnerving track that stokes anxiety as it increases in intensity. DiFranco\u2019s guitar skills are evident, particularly in the chorus, and she is known to break strings while playing this song. The lyrics detail morning-after regret, transporting the listener to a dingy hotel room. She sings, \u201cThe sheets are twisted and damp / Well the heat is so great,\u201d and you could easily break a sweat just by listening."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/17/ani-difranco-im-sorry-if-im-not-what-you-need-me-to-be", "page_content": "Ani DiFranco has been many things in her 48 years: a folk rocker, queer activist and campaigner against war and environmental disaster. But for the past 12 years, when she isn\u2019t touring, she has been a stay-at-home mother. \u201cMy life here is one of \u2018mom\u2019,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cA lot of typical mom stuff goes down.\u201d\n\nThe singer-songwriter, who has been responsible for more than 20 albums, including 1996\u2019s seminal Dilate, has lived in New Orleans for 15 years, and it\u2019s from here that she is building on her three-decade career as a performer, label owner (of Righteous Babe Records) and now author. Her impassioned memoir, No Walls and the Recurring Dream, documents the first half of her life: growing up in Buffalo in New York state, moving to New York City after her parents\u2019 divorce (her mother was moving to Connecticut and DiFranco did not want to follow) and the various trysts with men and women that ensued. We learn about her approach to her own image, the secrets of her songwriting and how she gained her fierce political views. The book ends after 9/11, before DiFranco became a mother of two. \u201cThe momentum of what I was doing was so fierce for so many years that there was no time to re-think anything,\u201d she says of a career that felt non-stop.\n\nThroughout it, DiFranco has always been an emblem of progress. She came out as bisexual in her early 20s and her songs documented relationships with both sexes. She hopped around genres before it became fashionable to do so, exploring folk, jazz, roots and rock and absorbing the influences of Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, Miles Davis and Betty Carter. She didn\u2019t pander to stereotypical appearances and chose unconventional haircuts (green and spiked on the cover of 1997\u2019s Spin, for example). And she was heavily policed, particularly by her own community, in a time that predated \u201ccancel culture\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard that term,\u201d she says. Her queer fans expressed anger when she married her roadie in 1998 (they divorced in 2003).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so unfortunate that marginalised communities are in competition for the tiny allotment of space society gives them,\u201d she says, empathising with the reasoning of her critics. \u201cYou have to be queer enough to qualify; people judge each other about who can claim an identity. Here we are listing our labels in order of importance and lining up in the hierarchy of whatever. We lose each other as people. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m not what you need me to be in a moment. I can only be me.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, DiFranco apologised after it was revealed that she would be hosting a three-day workshop at a former Louisiana slave plantation. She cancelled it, but many (including this paper) didn\u2019t detect remorse. DiFranco issued a further apology days later. \u201cI needed a wake-up call and you gave it to me,\u201d she wrote on her website. She is still afraid that a mention of the incident will shake a dormant hornets\u2019 nest.\n\n\u201cBoy, there\u2019s so much to talk about around then,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI felt my chest sink under the weight of it all.\u201d She regrets attempts at self-defence now. \u201cI should have found the ultimate humility to put down my own hurt, and all of the misconceptions or mis-truths out there. You have to make yourself accountable. There\u2019s a greater pain that\u2019s bigger than me, and it\u2019s more important.\u201d\n\nDiFranco performing at the CityFolk festival in Ottawa in 2018. Photograph: Mark Horton/Getty Images\n\nDiFranco despairs for upcoming voices in the post-social media age. \u201cIt\u2019s not getting any easier to be willing to make mistakes in public, which anybody has to do to stay alive,\u201d she says. The internet, she believes, has spawned a culture of \u201cgotcha!\u201d. \u201cOne mistake and you\u2019re done! It\u2019s counterproductive. The idea that we can write each other off and kick somebody off the planet? That\u2019s not how we\u2019re gonna get to where we need to be. We have to go together.\u201d\n\nShe doubts her own story would be the same if it were being written now. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I would have felt as free or unfettered,\u201d she says. \u201cMine was a world where every momentary choice didn\u2019t have to be one you were making in an endless eternity of scrutiny. Good luck to the artists today who are trying to break ground. God bless them.\u201d\n\nDiFranco grew up with \u201csuper progressive\u201d immigrant parents (her mother was Canadian, her father Italian). \u201cThere\u2019s a strong independent streak on both sides of my bloodline,\u201d she says. Family life wasn\u2019t dependable, hence the need for a teenage DiFranco to steer her exit. Her mother became an example of fearlessness after she split up with DiFranco\u2019s father, and gave the young singer the confidence to break rules. \u201cI saw her leave one life behind and go start another. Everything about her was going against the grain. She was the lady in the pink hat with the purple feather.\u201d\n\nSongwriting came early on, spurred by familial drama and domestic silence. \u201cI had pain that I had to get out of my body,\u201d DiFranco explains. \u201cArt transforms struggle into something useful, something beautiful.\u201d Through picking up a guitar, she found the safety of connection. She built a fan base the old-fashioned way, playing venues door-to-door across the US, becoming a regular at women\u2019s music festivals, including Lilith Fair. \u201cI went out further into the world, searching for my family,\u201d she says.\n\nIn the beginning, she slept in bus stations. She once rented a room in a former sex club. She drove herself up and down the land with her self-released albums on her back. \u201cThe songs came so unedited that they connected me with other beings like myself, even when there were only a few people in the room,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI did it human-to-human. Those moments were so healing that I\u2019ve stayed in search of them ever since.\u201d\n\nIn concert in 1994: \u2018I talk to every person like they\u2019re my friend.\u2019 Photograph: Steve Eichner/WireImage\n\nA desire to connect has made her a consistent ally. \u201cI talk to every person like they\u2019re my friend,\u201d she says, but she admits to situations where kindness has been taken for weakness. \u201cIf you stand on every stage and talk like you\u2019d talk to your best friend, you might step on toes. That way of interfacing is not always appropriate or successful, but that is my way, and that\u2019s how I\u2019ll do it even when it bites me in the ass.\u201d\n\nHer refusal to sign a label deal necessitated the creation of her own at the age of 20. She runs it to this day, offering a home also to Andrew Bird and Ana\u00efs Mitchell, among others. \u201cIf only white men are the delivery system, the translators, the sellers, the definers of the expressions of these diverse human experiences, then something is lost,\u201d she reasons.\n\nShe runs the label with a mostly female staff. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to write your own songs,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat if you\u2019re in control of the way they go into the world? I harnessed a lot of authenticity along the way. Not a lot of perfection. But freaking real as real could be.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, she has had a plethora of male mentors, including poet Sekou Sundiata and Pete Seeger, reasoning that men remain the gatekeepers for women\u2019s careers. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic, since I\u2019m known as feminist queen of the universe,\u201d she says, self-mocking. \u201cWhen it comes to inspiring and encouraging people, it doesn\u2019t matter what make and model you are.\u201d\n\nShe cites her mother, and feminist writers such as Audre Lorde, Alice Walker and Lucille Clifton as her female educators, women who helped her know herself better.\n\nNow married to her producer and the father of her children (a daughter aged 12 and a six-year-old son), the singer believes her best work is ahead of her \u2013 it was such a juggernaut for so long that she didn\u2019t have chance to self-criticise. \u201cMy kids got in the way of my music, very intentionally. That was a hard adjustment.\u201d Patience has been the upshot: it is changing the way she writes. \u201cI see a little clearer. There\u2019s lots of time to question myself. Youth is so confident. Now I do a lot of dancing with myself.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-05-15/at-60-sheryl-crow-tells-the-truth-about-lance-armstrong-and-the-sexism-she-experienced-as-a-young-woman.html", "page_content": "Sheryl Crow. Getty\n\n\u201cWatermelon, watermelon, peanut butter, peanut butter, watermelon\u2026\u201d Her fingers plugging her ears, Sheryl Crow repeats the words like a mantra to avoid hearing an interviewer\u2019s question about a major music magazine\u2019s criticism of her. The image, dating from the late 1990s, opens the first documentary about the musician. It captures much of the singer\u2019s image and character: despite winning nine Grammy Awards and selling more than 50 million records, the singer\u2019s success has been undermined by the press and cannibalized by tabloids that saw her as a perfect victim in a pre-Me Too era. Now, she is taking this cultural moment to claim milestones on and off the stage that have made her one of music\u2019s most \u201cunderrated\u201d stars.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like a cat with nine lives\u2026Although the truth is that I must already be on my eleventh,\u201d says the 60-year-old singer. She is not wrong. Crow is a key reference for 1990s rock and the MTV generation. Stars including Taylor Swift, HAIM, Olivia Rodrigo and St. Vincent have cited her as a musical influence. Sheryl, which has just premiered on Showtime, is a hagiography designed for fans (her manager produced the documentary). It works well as a chronological retelling, but falls short when it comes to delving into the artist\u2019s legacy, beneath the surface of a personal journey full of both milestones and potholes. The musician, who agreed to participate in the project out of boredom caused by the pandemic, acknowledges that she has \u201calways had very high highs and very low lows.\u201d The documentary, which mixes material from the singer\u2019s private archive with unpublished images shot during a tour, also features statements from figures such as Keith Richards and Laura Dern, who describes Crow as the voice of a generation.\n\nThe daughter of a piano teacher and a lawyer who in his spare time played trumpet in jazz bands, Crow describes herself as a music geek from a very early age. She went to college in Missouri, her home state, and began working as a high school music teacher while devoting her afternoons to playing in a rock cover band. Her life took a turn when she voiced a McDonald\u2019s television commercial. With the paycheck she earned from that job, she decided to leave it all behind and move to Los Angeles to try to forge a career as a singer.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of trying to make a name for herself in the industry, Sheryl Crow succeeded with her first album, \u201cTuesday Night Music Club.\u201d Karjean Levine (Getty Images)\n\nThis was the mid-1980s, when successful female solo artists could be counted on the fingers of one hand. Her path was not much easier than those of contemporaries like Tracy Chapman or Fiona Apple. After touring every studio in town with her demo in hand, Crow settled for waitressing, until her big break as a backing vocalist on Michael Jackson\u2019s international Bad tour in 1987. In just a few months, she exchanged a coffee shop counter for crowded venues with tens of thousands of people, where she wore an eighties wig to perform a duet of I Just Can\u2019t Stop Loving You with the King of Pop.\n\nHer biggest break, though, would come along with problems caused by the rampant sexism, which she has publicly denounced since long before such conversations were common. Tabloids published several articles branding her as Jackson\u2019s new romantic interest. They even wrote that the singer had offered her $2 million dollars to be the mother of his child.\n\nSheryl Crow and Michael Jackson on stage at a concert in London in 1988. Pete Still (Redferns)\n\nBehind the rumors, which sought to give the singer a semblance of masculinity and put an end to speculation about his sexuality, was the artist\u2019s manager, a gangster named Frank DiLeo. Crow also reveals that the businessman offered to produce her first solo album\u2013\u201dhe guaranteed me it would be at the top of the charts\u201d in exchange for continued sexual harassment, which forced the young woman to fight \u201ca constant battle to get away from him.\u201d When she tried to seek help, she heard a phrase common for actresses, models and singers in positions of professional privilege: \u201cOthers would die to be in your situation.\u201d\n\nThe situation plunged her into a deep depression, which momentarily distanced her from the front lines of the music industry. She retraced her steps and began to make a name for herself as a singer-songwriter. In 1993, well into her thirties, she released the feel-good anthem \u201cAll I Wanna Do,\u201d a best-selling hit that made her a star and remains her greatest success to this day. Prince, Eric Clapton, Stevie Nicks and the Rolling Stones invited her on stage with them. In her Los Angeles mansion she celebrated New Year\u2019s Eve parties with 800 guests, where \u201ceverywhere you looked there was a celebrity.\u201d\n\nThe Missouri native has influenced artists such as Taylor Swift and Olivia Rodrigo. Kevin Winter (Getty Images for iHeartMedia)\n\nSheryl\u2019s relationship with cyclist Lance Armstrong also became fodder for the tabloids. The artist chose to put her career aside to accompany the famous athlete, even moving to Girona in Spain with him during his training. The doping case that ended Armstrong\u2019s Tours de France also ended their relationship. \u201cHe lied to me, too,\u201d she says. Then, Crow underwent a routine mammogram that detected cancer. She says she lost \u201cfaith in humanity\u201d when dozens of paparazzi camped out for weeks outside her home to hunt for, she says, \u201ca photo at her lowest moment.\u201d\n\nThanks to its early detection, the disease subsided after months of treatment. The artist took advantage of the situation to turn her life around. In addition to becoming a fierce advocate for the fight against breast cancer, she left Los Angeles and moved to Nashville. She also fulfilled her longings for motherhood by adopting two sons, Wyatt and Levi, in 2007 and 2010 respectively. As a single mother, she has self-imposed the three-night rule: she forbids herself from sleeping more than three nights away from her children.\n\nCrow has performed numerous times with the Rolling Stones. Paul Natkin (WireImage)\n\nAlthough she continues to release music in different formats, and she also composed original songs for the documentary, she has confirmed that she will not record another studio album. The new Sheryl Crow no longer covers her ears to block out what others say about her. Now she calls the shots. As she sums it up at the end of the film, she is still trying to learn, but she will continue to do things that express herself and make her proud."}, {"url": "https://medium.com/ko63-music/the-return-of-alana-davis-c05c1392fd31", "page_content": "The Return of Alana Davis Thomas Gerbasi \u00b7 Follow Published in KO63 Music \u00b7 \u00b7 Oct 15, 2018 5 min read -- Share\n\nAlana Davis (Photo by Kimberly Wiechelt)\n\nThe music business may remember Alana Davis.

This year they\u2019ll finally get to tour in support of their 15th studio album Look Long, released last May. They\u2019re joined by the fiercely independent alt-folk-rocker Ani DiFranco, who has released every one of her 19 solo studio albums on her own Righteous Babe label. Her unique brand of folk melds punk, funk, hip hop and jazz stylings with the spirit of activist folk heroes like Woody Guthrie; much like the Indigo Girls, she\u2019s supported various progressive causes throughout her career.\n\nLISTEN TO THESE ARTISTS"}, {"url": "https://genius.com/artists/Ani-difranco", "page_content": "About Ani DiFranco\n\nAni DiFranco is a \u2018fiercly independent\u2019 Grammy-winning singer-songwriter, label owner and \u2018proudly bisexual\u2019 activist from Buffalo, New York. She is known for her unwavering loyalty to smaller, local companies to produce and distribute her (and her label\u2019s) product. DiFranco has consistently achieved international success despite having no charting singles. Prince once called her \u201cone of the finest guitarists ever\u201d.\n\nBefore reaching the age of ten, DiFranco was busking at a local farmers' market. At fifteen, she was emancipated from her mother and began regularly performing in clubs and coffee houses. At eighteen, she moved to New York City and, with a borrowed $1500, made a demo and quickly sold out of all 300 copies.\n\nIn 1988, DiFranco and Scot Fisher (originally a friend of her roomate) founded the Righteous Babe record label together. By 1995, DiFranco had self-released six albums and developed a loyal following, including a considerable number of lesbians who identified with her feminist lyrics, earning her the label \u2018a queer icon for Generation X\u2019. During this time, DiFranco almost signed with an established record label, but backed out after reading the contract. That same year, DiFranco\u2019s romantic relationship with Fisher ended, and she became involved with her sound technician Andrew Gilchrist.\n\nIn 1996, DiFranco released her most critically-acclaimed album Dilate \u2013 her first to chart on the Billboard 200. That year, her devotion to Buffalo earned her a congratulatory proclamation from the city. DiFranco received her first of several Grammy nominations for the song \u201cShy\u201d in 1997. That same year when DiFranco was asked by her friend, director PJ Hogan, to record a Burt Bacharach song about \u2018what a woman needs to do to attract and keep a man\u2019 for the Julia Roberts film My Best Friend\u2019s Wedding, she accepted, telling the LA Times:\n\nI guess the irony appealed to my sick sense of humor. It\u2019s important for all of us to be able to poke fun at ourselves. People have always tried to rob me of my sense of humor. There\u2019s a perception for some that I\u2019m kind of a dire, dogmatic person.\n\nIn early 1998, Alana Davis' cover of DiFranco\u2019s \u201c32 Flavors\u201d was a top 40 hit. That same year, DiFranco\u2019s own recording of it was licensed to the NFL, for which she recieved considerable backlash. She received more backlash when she married Gilchrist that year, with some fans accusing her of \u2018gender and sexual treason\u2019. Her albums, however, continued to sell very well with 1998\u2019s Little Plastic Castle reaching #22 on the Billboard 200, her highest-charting to date, and 1999\u2019s up up up up up up reaching #29. Annual sales of her albums had more than tripled from 1995-1999 and her concert revenue was in the millions, placing her in the top 50 US touring acts.\n\nBetween 2001-2004, Difranco scored four consecutive chart-toppers on Billboard\u2019s Independent Albums chart, including 2003\u2019s Grammy-winning Evolve (for its packaging). Despite the continued chart success of her albums, however, the industry was changing and the volume of product sold was actually decreasing. Sales of Righteous Babe albums dropped to half between 1999-2003. In 2003, DiFranco divorced Gilchrist. She married producer Mike Napolitano in 2007. Her 2012 album Which Side Are You On is her last to peak in the top half of the Billboard 200.\n\nIn 2013, DiFranco had to cancel a songwriting workshop for women that was scheduled to happen on a plantation she later learned was known for its history of slavery, and was owned by a billionaire who supported a political party with an anti-gay, anti-immigrant and anti-abortion agenda. A lengthy statement posted on her website was called a \u2018faux-pology\u2019, with its combative statements like \u201cI obviously underestimated the power of an evocatively symbolic place to trigger collective and individual pain\u201d and \u201cIs it possible to ensure that no \u2018bad\u2019 person will ever profit in any way from my existence or my work?\u201d\n\nUnabated, DiFranco has continued her activism, hosting all-women\u2019s music showcases, denouncing patriarchy, and promoting women in politics, environmentalism and anti-war stances. Her albums, Allergic To Water and Binary reached #155 and #192 on the Billboard 200 respectively. Her latest, Revolutionary Love, failed to chart."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/28/arts/music/sheryl-crow-documentary.html", "page_content": "NASHVILLE \u2014 Sheryl Crow is not going to read this story.\n\nShe confirmed this with a genial wince, but it wasn\u2019t a surprise (or a bluff). Crow\u2019s career began in the 1990s, when success was hitched to behemoths like major labels and radio, and the most direct line to fans came via MTV and the often sexist press. While she has done hundreds of interviews and been the topic of plenty of other coverage, she stopped looking at most of it around 1996, when she released her second album.\n\nShe gave into temptation once, on an airplane. A Rolling Stone magazine was on the seat next to her, and she discovered an \u201cugly\u201d article about herself. \u201cIt killed me,\u201d she said, her voice rising an octave. \u201cI felt myself sinking. And after that I was like, you know what, nothing is worth that. I\u2019ve already made the record. And I am who I am.\u201d\n\nAnd so Crow, who has spent three decades gamely relaying her story to others, has never known for sure how it\u2019s been told. That will change on May 6, when \u201cSheryl,\u201d a documentary directed by Amy Scott, arrives on Showtime. It\u2019s the latest in a wave of music films \u2014 some made by artists, themselves; others by more objective outsiders \u2014 that serve as correctives, uncovering the chauvinism and other challenges that plagued musicians during eras when women couldn\u2019t speak openly about harassment and mental health. Crow didn\u2019t have creative control over the project, though her manager is one of its producers, and she seized her opportunity to forcefully answer questions that have long tailed her regarding authorship and ambition, and explain just how hard she has had to fight in a music industry where she didn\u2019t fit into a neat box.\n\nOn a gloomy April afternoon, the singer-songwriter welcomed yet another interlocutor to the recording studio she built atop a horse stable here, with a palette stretching from tan to brown and vintage signs advertising gasoline and perfume hanging above the wood and leather. She was dressed in a blue plaid button-up and medium-wash jeans, jiggling one of her Timberland-clad feet while perched in front of a recent addition to the studio\u2019s saloon: a weathered magazine rack Crow rescued from a childhood haunt in Kennett, Mo., and stocked with old issues of Rolling Stone and Creem. Warm and candid, she immediately opened up her world, joking about her recent estate sale (with its \u201ccreepy dolls\u201d) and using Siri to FaceTime her older son, who was home from school sick."}]}
