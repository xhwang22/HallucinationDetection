{"Griffin was a talented player who was known for his speed and agility.": [{"url": "https://www.espn.com/nba/columns/story?page=EddieGriffin", "page_content": "These are various thoughts and observations, prompted by a tragic story.\n\nThis is coming from a distance, words about a person I don't know well, about a death whose precise circumstances we don't yet know for sure.\n\nWas Eddie Griffin trying to kill himself when he drove his SUV past railroad gates and flashing lights and into the side of a moving freight train in Houston last week? It will likely be some time before an investigation is complete, just as it took more than four days to identify Griffin because his body was burned so badly in the fiery crash that dental records were required for identification.\n\nBut what we do know of Griffin is this: The stream of incidents, arrests and unsuccessful stints in rehabilitation centers allows us to list him as Exhibit A in the argument that just because you can enter the NBA, that doesn't mean you should.\n\nAn ex-player I talked to Tuesday called Griffin \"a perfect example of a kid who shouldn't have went to the NBA early.\"\n\nI saw the other extreme over the weekend in Las Vegas, where young men with zero or one year of college experience such as LeBron James, Dwight Howard and Kevin Durant were gathered for the Team USA training camp. These are people who have stayed out of trouble, who seem capable of handling the extreme world of the NBA. Griffin's failures should not be a reason to deny opportunities for those who are ready.\n\nBut they should serve as a warning, a reminder that the most important part of college isn't the course credits, it's the socialization. It's about making the transition to adulthood in a sheltered environment where the mistakes aren't as costly as they are in the real world.\n\nIt's clear Griffin never learned to be responsible or accountable during his one year at Seton Hall or the six seasons he spent in the NBA. Maybe his problems were too serious for anyone in the league to deal with, even if teams' top priorities hadn't been making money and winning games. Regardless, it was the wrong environment for someone so unstable. Youth and money and loads of unsupervised time were a toxic combination for him.\n\nGriffin also is a case study in the temptation of talent.\n\nBecause of a fight with a teammate, he had to finish high school by studying at home instead of going to class and walking across a stage to get his diploma. In his year at Seton Hall, he punched out a teammate in the locker room.\n\nAnd yet the Rockets traded the rights to their three first-round draft picks (Jason Collins, Richard Jefferson and Brandon Armstrong) to get Griffin's draft rights in 2001.\n\nWhile in Houston, Griffin pleaded guilty in an assault case, and yet the Nets and then the Minnesota Timberwolves signed him to free-agent contracts. He later was jailed for violating probation, and yet the Timberwolves re-signed him, this time to a three-year, $8.1 million extension. They wound up cutting him loose in March.\n\nBefore his self-destructive tendencies turned deadly, they were expensive. Before he cost those who loved him the chance to see him again, he cost teams money, players and time. But who's to blame for that?\n\nThere's a blinding arrogance teams get when they covet talent. They think they can make it work for them, when all the evidence suggests otherwise.\n\nLate Tuesday night I talked to someone who did know Griffin well, Houston Rockets vice president of basketball operations and athletic trainer Keith Jones.\n\nJones last saw Griffin at a restaurant in Houston in May. He said Griffin seemed alert and optimistic. He talked about his daughter. He said his troubles, the most recent of which was a league-imposed substance abuse suspension that effectively ended his stay in Minnesota, were behind him\n\n\"I said, 'Eddie, you always tell me, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" then I find out different,'\" Jones said. \"He said, 'I'm taking care of it.'\"\n\nSounds like the voice of an addict, never acknowledging the extent of the problem.\n\nAs the dialogue implied, Jones had had that type of conversation with Griffin before. He knew Griffin well enough that the news of his death saddened him, but didn't completely surprise him.\n\n\"I can't say it shocks me,\" Jones said. \"It's still really sad and really tragic. And Eddie was a good guy. He had a good heart. He made some bad decisions on a lot of things. I think he had people that were guiding him, that he thought were guiding him, that didn't have his best interests in heart.\"\n\nJones said the Rockets did what they could to look after him while he played for them. In addition to the league-mandated rookie orientation program the incoming players are required to attend, the Rockets had a team security staffer look after Griffin. And they worked with a realtor who not only helped Griffin buy a home, she helped him with the details of life, such as opening a checking account.\n\n\"I thought we did a good job providing some guidance for him,\" Jones said. \"And giving him something solid to work with and solid people to look after him.\n\n\"You can't be with him 24 hours a day. You can only do so much. If a guy doesn't want help and isn't ready to change, he isn't going to.\"\n\nBy the time they get to the NBA, it's too late.\n\n\"There's those things that he didn't learn that most 17-, 18-, 19-year-old guys learn at some point, from their father or some other male figure,\" Jones said.\n\n\"Eddie was one of those AAU phenoms. They didn't teach him, they brought him along to win games. There's one more statistic, right there.\"\n\nJones is left with one last, nagging thought.\n\n\"I know he trusted me,\" Jones said. \"I know he knew I never asked him for anything, never wanted anything except for him to be successful. The whole thing that bugs me is I wish he would have trusted me enough, if he was drinking, or whatever happened, that he would call. If something was bothering him, he would have called one more time.\"\n\nI can't believe some of the strange and sad phrases associated with Griffin that came out while doing some research on him. These old news stories here and here (which I found through a Minnesota-based Web site called MNspeak.com) contained the unusual charge of \"deadly conduct\" and a probation violation for \"consorting with disreputable people.\"\n\nIn March 2004 Griffin plea-bargained to a misdemeanor charge of deadly conduct after facing a felony charge of aggravated assault that stemmed from an accusation that he punched and shot at a woman who came across Griffin with another woman in his Houston house. That prompts two questions: (1) How can something as serious-sounding as \"deadly conduct\" only be a misdemeanor? (2) In retrospect, wasn't his adult life an extended episode of deadly conduct, one practically destined for an early fatality?\n\nThe deadly conduct guilty plea resulted in an 18-month probation. While serving it, Griffin was sentenced to 15 days in jail because he was at a Houston nightclub when a fight broke out.\n\nA court official said Griffin violated probation because he was \"consorting with disreputable people.\" I wonder how many people would be better off if we consistently made that a jailable offense, if we forced them to choose between the company they keep and their best interests.\n\nWe've seen how Michael Vick was unable to escape his crowd and its dogfighting culture. While Griffin, apparently, was not surrounded by people who could guide him to the right path, in the end he wasn't able to escape himself.\n\nThe 2001 draft is starting to resemble the cursed Class of 1986 when it comes to tragedy and disappointment.\n\nGriffin's death follows the failure of No. 1 overall pick Kwame Brown in Washington, the unrealized potential of Tyson Chandler and the bad behavior of Zach Randolph that caused the Trail Blazers to dump a 20-and-10 guy for a player they didn't even want to keep.\n\nLikewise, the 1986 draft was overshadowed by the cocaine-overdose death of Len Bias, and drug-wasted careers of Chris Washburn and Roy Tarpley, plus the injury-shortened career of top pick Brad Daugherty.\n\nOne of my first reactions to the sad news was that I never really got to know Eddie Griffin. Later I realized that's because he never played in the playoffs. The playoffs are when casual fans get to know players' names and faces, and when we in the media get to know out-of-town players' personalities. You spend a week or two with a team over the course of a series and you get a little sense for who they are. But he never played in May, a sad reflection on his career and the teams that acquired him.\n\nIf most sports fans remember him at all, it's probably because last season he was in a car crash that witnesses said occurred because he was driving while watching a porno DVD and masturbating. That was good for a few yuks around the blogosphere. But maybe we should have taken it more seriously, recognizing it for what it was: a sign of his descent.\n\nIt was a warning that went ignored, just as, surely, some other unprepared teenager will someday fail to pay attention to the lessons of Eddie Griffin, and some team will take that risk.\n\nJ.A.

He nevertheless grew up to star for his high school in track, football and baseball before winning an athletics scholarship to the University of Central Florida alongside his twin brother, Shaquill.\n\nSome believed UCF had offered Shaquem a place just to curry favor with Shaquill. If that was true the coaching staff were soon pleasantly surprised: the linebacker was named American Athletic Conference defensive player of the year in 2016.\n\nAt this week\u2019s combine, Shaquem was again expected to be a curiosity rather than a standout performer. But on Saturday he bench-pressed 225lb 20 times, using a prosthetic hand.

It felt amazing.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Griffin was even better in the 40-yard dash, an important event in a league where speed is a coveted skill. His time of 4.38 seconds was the fastest ever by a linebacker \u2013 4.65 is considered outstanding \u2013 and the exact same time as his brother, a cornerback, managed last year. Shaquem\u2019s time was also faster than the combine\u2019s top-rated wide receiver, Calvin Ridley and running back Saquon Barkley, who is considered a future star.\n\n\u201cThis is a legitimate football player,\u201d NFL Network analyst Mike Mayock said. \u201cHe\u2019s an energy giver.\u201d\n\nGriffin\u2019s performance created a buzz among scouts and coaches \u2013 and also caught the attention of NFL players. \u201cShaquem Griffin killing it,\u201d tweeted three-time NFL defensive player of the year JJ Watt, of the Houston Texans.

Although the drills at the combine show coaches what players are capable of they are not predictors of success in the professional game. Many NFL stars have performed modestly at the event. Other players have displayed blazing speed only to struggle in the pros.\n\nHowever, Griffin did himself no harm in Indianapolis this week and is expected to be picked up by a team in the later rounds of the draft."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/sports/basketball/blake-griffin-detroit-pistons.html", "page_content": "There must be some mistake.

He started as a sophomore, and by his final year he was just scary. I can never remember one man tackling him; you had to bring folks. Heck, Archie played the last three games with a broken bone in his foot, and they still couldn\u2019t catch him.\u201d\n\nGriffin\u2019s sophomore year was highlighted by a 75-yard score in his second game as a starter.\n\nAs a junior, Griffin toted the rock for over 1,000 yards.\n\nThen, during his senior year, Griffin blew the doors off opponents by averaging over seven yards per carry and running for 1,787 yards and 29 touchdowns.\n\n\u201cWe used to sit and pray for him to get someone in a one-on-one situation, Archie would beat the guy every time,\u201d Stuart said. \u201cOn top of all that, he had a ton of courage. That\u2019s something you can never measure in a person, but it stuck out all over on him.\u201d\n\nAfter a 9-1 season, Eastmoor advanced to the city championship where Griffin dashed for another 267 yards, leading the Warriors to the city title.\n\nForty years ago, a former Eastmoor High School and Ohio State University graduate, Archie Griffin, competed for the Bengals in Super Bowl XVI (16) and has much to share about his experience before and after the world was watching. #OurCCS READ: https://t.co/ZCGfc0qs6e pic.twitter.com/juiPDl4I9V \u2014 Columbus City Schools (@ColsCitySchools) February 11, 2022\n\nHe was then named Player of the Year for Ohio.\n\nFive Star Recruit\n\nPlaying in a football-mad state like Ohio led to national attention as Griffin\u2019s 3,382-yard and 47-touchdown prep career came to a close.\n\nHe received over 150 recruiting offers from every corner of the country.\n\nGriffin wanted to play close to home, but he also wanted to go somewhere he could play immediately.\n\nNorthwestern was on his radar as well as Navy, Louisville, and Michigan.\n\nOhio State University was practically in the Griffins\u2019 backyard, but they were unsure of the fit between Archie and Buckeyes coach Woody Hayes.\n\nHowever, Hayes wasn\u2019t about to miss out on the state\u2019s hottest recruit.\n\n#ThrowbackThursday\n\nWoody Hayes and Archie Griffin pic.twitter.com/vw5swgMXFc \u2014 The Sporting News Archives (@sportsphotos) May 26, 2016\n\nThe coach pulled out all the stops to get Griffin and assure him he would do well at OSU.\n\n\u201cWoody was messing around with the wishbone back then,\u201d Stuart recalls, \u201cand Archie was afraid he\u2019d never see the ball if he went to Ohio State. So Woody took him into an office, closed the door and spent a lot of time X-ing and O-ing.

It depends on what the expectations are,\u201d Griffin said in 2016. \u201cWhen I went into pro football, my expectations were to originally get 1,000 yards a season. However, I found out quickly that I wasn\u2019t going to get the ball enough to get 1,000 yards. I changed that goal to average five yards a carry. I didn\u2019t quite reach five, but I think any running back in the NFL, if they can say he averaged over four yards a carry over the course of a career, they\u2019d be happy with it.\u201d\n\nGriffin averaged 4.1 yards per attempt in his career.\n\nLife After Football\n\nWhen he was in college, Griffin majored in Industrial Management and graduated shortly after the fall semester ended in 1975.\n\nDuring his career with the Bengals, Griffin invested in a retail business selling athletic shoes.\n\nEventually, he had six stores but the business folded due to a poor economy and a push to expand the business too quickly.\n\nThat ultimately led to bankruptcy and Griffin\u2019s vow to be more cautious in the future.\n\n\u201dI guess you can say I\u2019ll be quite conservative in the future.

Johnny tried to make a name for himself when he joined a gang in New Orleans but wasn't going anywhere. A guy from Chicago hired Johnny for some local muscle and they were impressed so they introduced him to the Secret Empire. Johnny told them he wanted to be more than a cheap hood and the Empire promised to make him a super villain. Johnny agreed and underwent a dramatic operation where the Secret Empire permanently grafted onto him a mane, wings and replaced his hands with lion's paws. His face turned dead white after the procedure and the Griffin was born.\n\nHis first assignment for the Secret Empire was to kill the Beast. The mutant known as Angel witnessed the battle and intervened when the Beast kicked the Griffin in the face and Horton plummets from a great height. Angel tried to catch the Griffin but he quickly recovered and knocked out the mutant with one punch. Beast saved his friend while the Griffin retreated. Griffin informs Number One that the Beast was assisted by Angel so the Empire ordered him to kill Angel as well. The Griffin attacks the Beast after he attends a meeting with Patsy Walker and her husband, Buzz Baxter. Angel tries to help the Beast subdue their powerful enemy and a fierce fight ensues. Griffin goes airborne with the Beast in his clutches and attempts to bite him with his fangs. The Beast manages to turn his body around and use his long arms to grab the Griffin's wings. The Griffin is unable to control his wings and begins to quickly descend. During the free fall, Griffin is punched in the jaw by Angel and knocked unconscious.\n\nCreation\n\nGriffin was created by Steve Englehart, Tom Sutton, Frank Giacoia and John Tartag\n\nHistory\n\nGriffin\n\nHorton would continue to work for the Empire and still consume the serum that transformed him into the Griffin. The serum drove him insane and he ended up killing the doctor that performed the surgery. This led to a confrontation with Beast and Spider Man where the two heroes barely defeated him. The Griffin would later team up with Crimson Dynamo and the Titanium Man to battle the Champions. This group shortly disbanded after they were defeated. The Griffin's facial features would change during a confrontation with Spider Man and Wonder Man. The Griffin evolved once more and his face became more bestial. The Griffin was presumed dead when a burning plane he attempted to lift fell on him during that battle. The Griffin survived when he dug a tunnel with his claws under the burning wreckage. Griffin was discovered roaming the Adirondacks by Headlok and became his mental slave. They ended up battling the West Coast Avengers but Griffin was eventually subdued when Tigra was able to calm his bestial side.\n\nNamor would run into the Griffin when Desmond Marrs enlisted him to kidnap Carrie Alexander in order to draw out of hiding the mystery man who is the real power behind Oracle Inc. Desmond and his sister Phoebe Marrs realized that the Prince of Atlantis was alive when everyone presumed he was killed during an Atlantean invasion a few months earlier. Namor battled Griffin near the Statue of Liberty and was able to defeat him by taking the beast out of his element and take the fight underwater. Namor caged the Griffin inside a dockside warehouse and was able to tame the beast. He taught the Griffin that Namor was his master and to remain docile under his command. Namor rode the Griffin and crashed a meeting at the Roxxon Plaza in order to get answers on why he was attacked. Namor got his answers and left the Griffin inside the Roxxon boardroom. Namor and the Griffin would reunite once more during an adventure to the Savage Land and come into conflict with the Super Skrull.\n\nSecret Invasion\n\nGriffin would return to villainy and join the The Hood's new iteration of the Masters of Evil and battle the Avengers on a few occasions. Griffin was later seen with the Masters.battling the Skrulls during the Secret Invasion crisis.\n\nDark Reign\n\nGriffin & Mandrill hunt for Spiders!\n\nNorman Osborn would appoint the Hood as Camp HAMMER's new chief operating officer and his men are legally working for the government to capture dangerous fugitives. The Hood sent Griffin, Razorfist, Living Laser and the Scorcher to go after Gauntlet and Tigra when they went AWOL. He was also a part of the Hood's plan to steal a vast fortune from a rich Arabian prince. Later on after the robbery and the burning of one of Hood's hide outs, Griffin got drunk with other members of the gang and got arrested for their recklessness. He and the others would later be let free by the Hood. However Griffin was angry that the Hood didn't free them earlier. He tries to kill the Hood but is wounded in the process as the Hood shoots him multiple times in the legs.\n\nThe Hood has powered up members of his Masters of Evil with the Norn Stones which were given to him by Loki. The Hood wanted to juice up his crew so they could go hunt down some Avengers. The Griffin tells Mandrill that they are being used and that he had no interest to hunt the Avengers. He also tells the Mandrill that he's too afraid to run and have a price on his head. Mandrill tries to tell Griffin that this is the opportunity to become part of Osborn's A-list team and taking down the Avengers would be a great chance to bump up their status. Griffin tells Mandrill he would rather die and is only doing this for the money. Mandrill would spot Spider Man and Spider Woman with his suped up vision and the two engage the Avengers. Spider Man has noticed that the Griffin is more powerful than their previous encounter before he is blasted off the roof by a mind-controlled Spider Woman. Griffin and Mandrill enjoy the assault on Spider Man by the possessed crimson beauty. Spider Man refuses to strike Spider Woman as he gets bombarded by venom blasts and body blows. Spider Man keeps talking to Spider Woman until she tells the wall-crawler that she is being controlled by the monkey faced villain. Spider Man replies \"I know what to do\" as he finally falls from one final venom blast. The two villains approach Spider Woman when Mandrill gets webbed in the mouth and Spider Man knocks out the Griffin with one powerful uppercut. Spider Woman blasts the Mandrill in the mouth and Spider Man webs both villains together.\n\nHeroic Age\n\nThe Hood would go on the run after the siege of Asgard was a failure and Norman Osborn is no longer the Director of National Security. Several members of the Hood's gang are arrested in Asgard but the Griffin is later captured in New York by Spider Man. The Griffin is caught in a giant web and the crowd is aggravated at the web-head for causing a traffic jam on Fifth Avenue. The crowd starts throwing trash at Spider Man and Griffin tells everyone that the wall-crawler is his partner and they're in cahoots. The Griffin is apprehended and sent to the Raft.\n\nX-Men: To Serve & Protect\n\nGriffin comes into conflict with Hercules and Psylocke of the X-Men when he apparently steals some money from a bank. Hercules places Griffin in a headlock while Psylocke stabs him in the head with her psychic blade.\n\nFear Itself\n\nThe Raft Penitentiary is severely damaged when a mystic hammer lands inside the prison facility and nullifies the cell block's force-field. Several super-powered felons escape including Griffin, Basilisk and Man-Bull. They flee the island with a female inmate that has a raft boat and head to Brooklyn. The four criminals participate in a bank heist in Cadman Plaza and come into conflict with Hercules who has been depowered after his epic battle with the Chaos King. Hercules has been equipped with various mythological weapons and is still a brave, fierce warrior despite his lack of superstrength. Griffin is stabbed in the chest with the Sword of Peleus but Hercules avoided all major arteries and organs. Griffin recovers while Hercules is fighting with Man-Bull. Griffin grabs two handfuls of cash and flies through a window but he is gunned down by the Warhawks who are led by Kyknos, the son of Ares. Man-Bull and Hercules team up against Kynkos and help save Griffin. The crowd begins to go crazy and turns against Hercules, Man-Bull and Griffin. They find their female inmate laying on the floor with horns sprouting from her head and she's uttering some unknown language. Man-Bull and Hercules fend themselves against the Warhawks when the female inmate reveals herself to be Hecate, Mistress of Terror and Witchcraft. Hecate casts a spell that enrages the crowd and dogs throughout the city go wild. Hercules is rushed by the crowd when Man-Bull and Basilisk noticed a change with Griffin. The magic emanating from all the chaos had transformed Griffin into a real, mythological griffin and he saves Hercules from the crowd. Hercules rides Griffin like a steer and they come across some civilians going crazy from the magic. Hercules is wounded and Griffin takes him to a building rooftop. Hercules collapses and Griffin tries to provide nourishment by offering two wild dogs he just killed. Hercules treats his wounds while Griffin eats the rest of his kill. Hercules wakes up the next morning and hears Griffin whining. They are in awe when the city landscape has changed and overwhelmed by massive trees sprouting through various buildings.\n\nA Council Of Masters\n\nMax Fury, the leader of the Shadow Council has assembled a new Masters of Evil in the sovereign nation of Bagalia where Griffin is presently a member. Griffin is present when Max Fury and the Masters of Evil capture John Steele after he attempts to escape Bagalia with the Serpent Crown and the Crown of Thorns.\n\nPowers & Abilities\n\nGriffin is very similar to his mythical counterpart and quite powerful. Griffin has wings that provide him flight and he possesses razor sharp claws and fangs. He also has a prehensile tail he can use to strike and grab his enemies. During his early changes, he had the ability to control certain animals with his voice when he called upon a flock of birds to attack Spider Man and Wonder Man. Griffin has superhuman durability and strength. Griffin managed to overpower superhumans like Ghost Rider, Spider Man and Wonder Man with his bestial strength. The Griffin's senses are also heightened which make him an excellent tracker.\n\nOther Versions\n\nMarvel Adventures\n\nGriffin would be involved in several stories taking place in the Marvel Adventures comics which are standalone stories and does not take place in the current Marvel Universe continuity.\n\nGriffin takes on the Avengers.\n\nThe Griffin would come into conflict with the Avengers when Iron Man and Captain America witness the villain land in a park with SHIELD agents around him. The Griffin was trying to kidnap a Chinese diplomat when SHIELD agents tried to stop him. Iron Man and Captain America call for reinforcements so Storm, Spider Man and Wolverine arrive. The Griffin's strength, speed and ferocity give the Avengers more than they can handle. The Griffin starts to gain the upper hand when he controls a flock of birds to attack Wolverine and knocks Storm down with a park bench. Tigra was watching the entire fiasco from a distance because she was paid by an unknown client to gather information on the Avengers for a book he was planning to write on the heroes. Tigra decided to intervene and kicked the Griffin behind the head. Tigra then flipped over the Griffin and planted a kiss on him. The kiss was a distraction and it allowed Iron Man to take down Griffin with a neuro-blast. The Griffin was placed into custody and Tigra was invited to join the Avengers.\n\nOther Media\n\nTelevision\n\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nHe is mentioned by John Garrett as the first prisoner he ever brought to the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility known as the Fridge."}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/blake-griffin", "page_content": "Blake Griffin: A Brief Biography\n\nBlake Austin Griffin is a professional American basketball player.

Griffey, Sr., arranged to be traded to the Mariners late in the 1989 season, and the two formed a sentimental duo in the lineup until his retirement in 1991.\n\nBritannica Quiz I Am the Greatest (Athlete)\n\nGriffey, Jr., soon began to prove his worth as both a centre fielder and a hitter. He was injured in his rookie season, but in 1990 he won his first Gold Glove Award, had a batting average of .300, and played in the All-Star Game. He went on to win the American League Gold Glove Award for the years 1991\u201399 with his spectacular fielding. In 1997, when Griffey hit 56 home runs and batted in 147 runs, he was a unanimous selection for the American League\u2019s Most Valuable Player award.\n\nAt the close of the 1999 season, Griffey\u2014who had come to dislike playing in the Mariners\u2019 new pitcher-friendly stadium and wanted to work closer to his family\u2019s home in Orlando, Florida\u2014requested a trade from Seattle. In February 2000 he was traded to Cincinnati, which he considered his hometown and where his father worked as a coach. Griffey struggled with a series of injuries in Cincinnati. When he was on the field, he remained a dangerous left-handed hitter. In 2004 he became the 20th major league player to hit 500 home runs, and he was named to the National League All-Star team in 2000, 2004, and 2007. In 2008, after hitting his 600th career home run, Griffey joined Barry Bonds, Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, and Sammy Sosa as the only players in major league history to accomplish that feat. Griffey was traded to the Chicago White Sox in July 2008.\n\nHe became a free agent for the first time in his career at the end of the 2008 season, and he signed with the Mariners again in February 2009. Griffey\u2019s return to Seattle was a boon for the Mariners\u2019 attendance figures, but his deteriorating on-field play and subsequent lack of playing time led him to abruptly retire from baseball in June 2010. He finished his career with a .284 batting average, 630 home runs, and 1,836 runs batted in. In 2016 he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, having received 437 of the 440 votes cast (99.32 percent) to set the record for the highest percentage of votes in the history of the Hall of Fame (which was broken in 2019 when Mariano Rivera was elected unanimously).

His trial on murder charges in 1995 was one of the most celebrated criminal trials in American history.\n\nSimpson played football at Galileo High School in San Francisco, first as a tackle and then as a fullback. He attended San Francisco City College (1965\u201366) to achieve a scholastic record that allowed him to play at the University of Southern California (USC), where he set team records for yards gained by rushing: 1967, 1,415 yards; 1968, 1,709 yards. He was named All-American (1967\u201368), played in two Rose Bowl games, and won the Heisman Trophy as the best collegiate player of the season (1968). At USC he was also a member of a world-record-setting 440-yard relay team.\n\nBritannica Quiz Sports Quiz\n\nSimpson, who was often called \u201cJuice\u201d because of his energetic runs and because his initials could stand for \u201corange juice,\u201d was the number one draft choice of the American Football League (AFL) Buffalo Bills in 1969. The following year the AFL merged with the National Football League (NFL). The Bills were members of the American Football Conference (AFC) of the NFL when Simpson set a single-season record for yards gained rushing (2,003) in 1973. The Bills were never a contending team during his stay, but he was a great box-office draw. Injuries to his knees prompted the Bills to trade him in 1978 to the San Francisco 49ers, but he retired after the 1979 season. His 1975 record of most touchdowns scored in a season (23) stood until 1983, and his 1973 season rushing record for most yards gained lasted until 1984, when it was broken by Eric Dickerson. Simpson led the AFC in rushing yardage four times (1972\u201373, 1975\u201376). His career total yards gained (11,236) was second in the all-time rankings at the time of his retirement.

On June 12, 1994, his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman were stabbed to death outside her home in Los Angeles. Simpson was arrested and charged with the two murders on June 17; he pleaded not guilty and hired a team of prominent lawyers to handle his defense. His lengthy nationally televised trial became the focus of unprecedented media scrutiny. A jury acquitted Simpson of the murder charges on October 3, 1995. In a separate civil trial decision in 1997, he was found liable for the deaths of his ex-wife and Goldman and was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages to the families. Simpson later collaborated (with Pablo F. Fenjves) on If I Did It, in which he hypothesized about how he would have committed the murders. Public outrage prevented its initial publication in 2006, but a bankruptcy court subsequently awarded the book\u2019s rights to the Goldman family, who released the work in 2007.\n\nLater that year, Simpson was arrested after he and several other men entered a Las Vegas hotel room and took memorabilia items that Simpson claimed had been stolen from him. The incident resulted in Simpson being charged with a number of crimes, including armed robbery and kidnapping. On October 3, 2008, a jury found him guilty of all charges.

He\u2019s was explaining which stances will draw a charge in the eyes of officials and which will have a defender looking foolish.\n\nThat\u2019s right: Griffin, one of the greatest dunkers of his generation, was talking a big game to The Athletic about drawing fouls. And not the common ones. A decade after he established himself in Los Angeles as a high-flying highlight reel, Griffin has seen his career undergo a wholesale change. The man who became famous for defying gravity when he jumped over a Kia has now earned his teammates\u2019 respect for succumbing to gravity.\n\nGriffin joined the Nets last season to be a supporting cast member alongside their original big three. Though the dunks and playmaking he\u2019d bring at power forward were a given, the hustle plays and ability to get defensive stops on charges have given him a unique niche on Brooklyn\u2019s roster and changed the way many around the league perceive him.\n\n\u201cHe went from an All-Star player for the most part in his career to a role player with us,\u201d Nets coach Steve Nash said, \u201cand he accepted it and, I think, attacked that role. \u2026 His ability to throw his body around, take charges, rebound, set good screens, do all the little things, it\u2019s been outstanding.\u201d\n\nNBA rules define a charge as an occurrence when an offensive player makes contact with a defensive one who has already established position. A defensive player is not permitted to move in the path of an offensive player once he has started his upward motion to attempt a field goal or pass. And maybe more importantly, aside from an illegal screen, a charge is the only call that equates to both a personal foul on the opposing player and a defensive stop. Griffin, 33, said the twofold impact of the call is why he aims for it so frequently, despite being a six-time All-Star who has and still can do so much more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEntering the final weekend of the season, Griffin is tied with Kevin Love for the league lead in charges drawn, at 26, and his 0.98 charges per 36 minutes lead the NBA by an overwhelming margin; Love trails him there, drawing 0.57 per 36. And though that may seem surprising to anyone who hasn\u2019t followed Griffin since his Clippers\u2019 days, based on recent history, at least, it shouldn\u2019t be. In 2020-21, despite missing a month while the Pistons bought out his contract, the 6-foot-9 forward drew 22 charges, which put him in a three-way tie with Kemba Walker and Montrezl Harrell for the league lead. As Griffin wraps up his 12th professional season, he\u2019s proven he\u2019s more than willing to get physical in service of a stop.\n\n\u201cA lot of these opportunities come from being the help defender, you know?\u201d Griffin said that day at the Nets\u2019 practice facility. \u201cI definitely do draw some charges straight up, guarding on-ball, but a lot of times it\u2019s like, I see a guy make a move, I see a guy get beat, I kind of pull over and, I don\u2019t know, for some reason I don\u2019t really do this thing\u2026\u201d\n\nGriffin put his hands together in front of his stomach and kept talking. \u201cI come across like hands up sort of like\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this point, he assumed a traditional defensive stance \u2014 and continued explaining: \u201cWhen you see a guy come in (with his hands together in front of him), you know what\u2019s on his mind. You see a guy come over like this \u2026 I don\u2019t think guys are really thinking charge. And at the last second, you can kind of sell that charge a little bit more.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just sort of my philosophy: Just always be watching for an opportunity.\u201d\n\nSo what makes Griffin so good at drawing charges and not getting called for blocks?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor starters, he thinks about it. Walker, another charge-drawing whiz, keeps his process simple. \u201cI just try to stay there and take it to the chest,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Griffin\u2019s procedure has more depth. He\u2019s studied other players around the league who rival his ability to draw charges and analyzes personnel as he debates whether to throw his body into an oncoming opponent.\n\n\u201cCertain guys, I think, are a little bit easier to take charges on,\u201d Griffin said during his charge streak in the spring of 2021. \u201cThe guys who are incredibly shifty and have a lot of Euro steps and can sort of get by people, that\u2019s sort of a harder one to take charges on.\n\n\u201cBigger guys, guys that are a little bit more reckless, you kind of key in on those things.\u201d\n\nGriffin\u2019s position as a smaller center also helps him. Aside from Love, who has undergone a similar transition from All-Star center to reserve, most of the league\u2019s leaders in charges drawn tend to be guards. But Griffin\u2019s position down low aids in his ability to jump in front of players who previously beat a teammate.\n\n\u201cIf you come over too early and you give away that taking a charge (with your hands at your stomach), those guys will just stop, spin, pivot or jump up,\u201d Griffin explained recently. \u201cLike, they won\u2019t keep going. But I think, for me, that\u2019s how I would teach, like, my son, \u2026 to, like, come over and be ready and then, boom,\u201d\n\nBoom is a jump and a two-footed landing. Griffin continued: \u201cThat\u2019s all you have to do. You know what I mean? Other than that, I mean, it\u2019s just kind of a timing, just kind of a feel.\u201d\n\nGriffin has taken cues from what officials are seeing, too.\n\n\u201cOne thing good charge takers do is \u2026 if they\u2019re getting to a spot, it\u2019s always like, get your feet down first,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cBecause it kind of helps the refs know you\u2019re set. Sometimes guys will come in and try a charge, so I always try to get my feet there and then my body just comes to that spot, so I\u2019m not ever like leaning. \u2018Cause that\u2019s really the only way you can lose a charge call, is if you\u2019re still trying to lean into it or something.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd referees see where Griffin is coming from.\n\nShelley Russi, a college basketball referee for more than 20 years who was formerly responsible for WNBA Referee Performance and Development, said her colleagues determine a block/charge call from the feet up, which gives Griffin\u2019s rationale some legs. Russi runs Third Side Coaching, a business that works with players and coaches to better understand mindset, awareness and keys to getting charge calls. She said block/charge is one of the toughest calls her colleagues have to make and complimented Griffin\u2019s thought process on factoring officials into his mindset. He might make a fine guest instructor for her company.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s saying makes sense entirely,\u201d Russi told The Athletic. \u201cI don\u2019t like to use the term \u201cjust set\u201d, but referees do look to make sure that he has two feet and body in front (legal) when defending dribblers or prior to shooter starting his upward shooting motion on drives to basket. Once he\u2019s legal, he can maintain by either moving laterally (dribble only) or retreating as they go to make a decision.\n\n\u201cHis line of thinking is a good line of thought. \u2026 Ensuring that he\u2019s legal from the feet up to point of contact is a very important fundamental that referees use for making their decisions.\u201d\n\nGriffin\u2019s charge-drawing origins start long before he got to Brooklyn \u2014 and long before the NBA started tracking hustle stats in 2016-17. His father, Tommy, was a longtime high school coach at Oklahoma Christian in the suburbs of Oklahoma City. Griffin was around the team as a kid and said his father was a defense-oriented coach who always had players who were good at taking charges. Griffin kept that in mind when he eventually went to play for him \u2014 and throughout his career, he\u2019s drawn the whistle in his favor. The dunks just got more attention.\n\nThen, in 2017-18, he drew a dozen charges in a year split between the Clippers and the Pistons. The following season, he drew 30, which ranked second in the NBA. Griffin missed most of 2019-20 because of knee surgery before drawing 22 charges last season in Detroit and Brooklyn. He joined the Nets in late March 2021, and as the charges piled up on his stat sheet, the Nets started to take on his style.\n\nIn Griffin\u2019s first full month in Brooklyn, the Nets led the NBA in charges drawn, with 19. According to PBPStats, a basketball tracking site, Griffin drew .96 charges per 100 possessions in 26 games as a Net in the 2020-21 regular season, which was the most of any player who logged as many minutes as he did with Brooklyn (560). Had he been able to keep up his rate as a Net for the whole season, it would have been the league\u2019s highest single-season rate in five years. And this season, it\u2019s even higher. He\u2019s drawn 1.31 charges per 100 possessions, showing his efficiency at picking one up whenever he plays. For context, Love, whose rate is No. 2 in the league behind Griffin\u2019s, has .79 per 100 possessions, and Kyle Lowry, who\u2019s next in the standings, draws .59.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDwane Casey, who coached Griffin in Detroit, said his charge skills go beyond his positioning. And Casey, who also coached Lowry, would know. He\u2019s seen two of the league\u2019s best at hitting the floor up close, and he said Griffin understands angles and offenses at a higher level than most players, which allows him to beat opponents to their spots. Help defenders in the post can easily give up lobs when they come over to aid a teammate who just got beat. Griffin\u2019s rare, elite sense of timing allows him to help without creating a backdoor path for another player to catch a lob. Casey argued that at 250 pounds, Griffin can take more hits than most players because, on a mismatch, a guard hitting him won\u2019t hurt as much as if the roles were reversed.\n\n\u201c(Griffin and Lowry) both have a knack, a feel, for getting it,\u201d Casey said. \u201cSome guys try to go get charges and end up getting blocks, but Kyle will come across the floor, Blake will come from his position and find a way to get a charge, but that\u2019s a knack. You teach as much as you can, whether you take a charge or go vertical, but he just has a feel for it, and you\u2019re never going to take that away.\u201d\n\nThis season, Griffin took his charges into uncharted territory, adding a celebration upon drawing them. Baseball has bat flips, football has touchdown celebrations, and race-car drivers have figure-eights; Griffin created a new category. Last season, in a game where both he and Joe Harris took charges, Griffin said the two joked about the blue-collar nature of the act and mused that \u201cit\u2019s a steel-toe, hard-hat, lunch-pail kind of game.\u201d With that in mind, this season they co-founded the \u201cBlue Collar Boys,\u201d an unofficial club whose rules mandate they put on an imaginary hard hat and boots after drawing charges.\n\nHard Hats \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSteel-Toe Boots \u2714\ufe0f The BCB have clocked in. pic.twitter.com/PElc55unkR \u2014 Brooklyn Nets (@BrooklynNets) November 11, 2021\n\nAs the season went on, they ditched the boots and solely celebrated the construction helmet. Patty Mills, who ranked among the top charge-drawers through his 10 years in San Antonio, joined the group after Griffin claimed he reviewed Mills\u2019 application, and he\u2019s drawn seven of his own this year, second on the team. After Kevin Durant drew a charge at Toronto in a November win, Griffin acknowledged his star teammate\u2019s hustle but said the application process takes some time.\n\nDurant\u2019s membership status is currently unknown.\n\nThis year, the Nets are eighth in charges drawn as a team, with 42, after finishing seventh last year with 47. In the first three months of this season, Brooklyn ranked in the top five of the league in charges drawn, which, coincidentally, was when its defense was also in a similar range. Though Griffin\u2019s drop-off in playing time isn\u2019t the reason the Nets defense significantly regressed, for a unit that many expected to fall back to the mean, losing his unique ability to generate stops certainly didn\u2019t help.\n\nGriffin\u2019s ability to stay in the league lead this late in the season despite averaging a career-low 17 minutes per game is a testament to his ability to master one of the game\u2019s wrinkles later in his career. And his new-ish talent for putting his body in the opponent\u2019s paths may extend his relevance and add to his legacy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever, to be honest,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cI\u2019ll dive on the floor. I don\u2019t think twice about that stuff, because you just never know how that one possession could change the shape of a game.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been games where I\u2019ve taken a charge to seal a win. You just never know. That\u2019s why I always do it.\u201d\n\n(Photo of Patty Mills and Blake Griffin: Nathaniel S. Butler / NBAE via Getty Images)"}]}
