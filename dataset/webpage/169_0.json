{"Ayn Rand was a Russian-American.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ayn-Rand", "page_content": "Top Questions Who was Ayn Rand? Ayn Rand was a Russian-born American author and philosopher. Rand authored two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged (1957). Her novels were especially influential among conservatives and libertarians from the mid-20th century. Where is Ayn Rand from? Ayn Rand was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, on February 2, 1905. When the tsarist regime was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, her family moved to Crimea, where she finished high school. She returned to Russia in 1921 and then moved to the United States in 1926. What is Ayn Rand\u2019s real name? Ayn Rand is the pen name of Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum. She adopted it when she moved to the United States in 1926. The first name, which rhymes with \u201cpine,\u201d was inspired by the name of a Finnish writer (whom she declined to identify), and the surname she described as an abbreviation of Rosenbaum. When did Ayn Rand begin writing? Ayn Rand arrived in Chicago in 1926 and then moved to Hollywood, where she met American filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille. Her chance encounter with DeMille led to work as a movie extra and eventually to a job as a screenwriter. Rand sold her first screenplay, Red Pawn, to Universal Studios in 1932. What are Ayn Rand\u2019s most famous works? Rand\u2019s first major work, The Fountainhead, was published in 1943. It details the struggle of a genius architect against mediocrity. Her second major work, Atlas Shrugged, was published in 1957. It follows a railroad executive and a steel magnate as they grapple with a collectivist government. Both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged explicate Rand\u2019s personal philosophy of objectivism. How did Ayn Rand die? Rand died of heart failure on March 6, 1982, in New York City. At the time, she had been working on a television adaptation of her novel Atlas Shrugged.\n\nAyn Rand, original name Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum, (born February 2, 1905, St. Petersburg, Russia\u2014died March 6, 1982, New York, New York, U.S.), Russian-born American writer whose commercially successful novels promoting individualism and laissez-faire capitalism were influential among conservatives and libertarians and popular among generations of young people in the United States from the mid-20th century.\n\nEarly life and career Her father, Zinovy Rosenbaum, was a prosperous pharmacist. After being tutored at home, Alissa Rosenbaum, the eldest of three children, was enrolled in a progressive school, where she excelled academically but was socially isolated. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, her father\u2019s shop was confiscated by communist authorities, an event she deeply resented. As a student at Leningrad State University, she studied history and became acquainted with the works of Plato and Aristotle. After graduating in 1924, she enrolled in the State Institute for Cinematography, hoping to become a screenwriter. The arrival of a letter from cousins in Chicago gave her an opportunity to leave the country on the pretext of gaining expertise that she could apply in the Soviet film industry. Upon her arrival in the United States in 1926, she changed her name to Ayn Rand. (The first name, which rhymes with \u201cpine,\u201d was inspired by the name of a Finnish writer, whom she never identified, and the surname she described as an abbreviation of Rosenbaum.) After six months in Chicago she moved to Hollywood, where a fortuitous encounter with the producer Cecil B. DeMille led to work as a movie extra and eventually to a job as a screenwriter. In 1929 she married the actor Frank O\u2019Connor. Soon hired as a filing clerk in the wardrobe department of RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., she rose to head of the department within a year, meanwhile writing stories, plays, and film scenarios in her spare time. She became an American citizen in 1931."}, {"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ayn-rand/", "page_content": "First published Tue Jun 8, 2010; substantive revision Mon Jul 13, 2020\n\nAyn Rand (1905\u20131982) was a novelist-philosopher who outlined a comprehensive philosophy, including an epistemology and a theory of art, in her novels and essays. Early in her career she also wrote short stories, plays, and screenplays. Rand\u2019s first and most autobiographical novel, We the Living (1936), set in the Soviet Union, was published only after many rejections, owing to widespread sympathy for the Soviet \u201cexperiment\u201d among the intellectuals of the day. We the Living was quickly followed by the dystopian novel, Anthem (1938), written as \u201ca kind of rest\u201d from work on her next major novel, The Fountainhead (1943). The Fountainhead, also published after many rejections because of its individualism, and largely panned by critics, soon became a best-seller by word of mouth. The Fountainhead brought Rand international fame, and Atlas Shrugged (1957) sealed this fame. By 1958, Rand\u2019s novels, increasingly philosophical, had won her ideas a sufficiently devoted following for her to form, in association with psychologist Nathaniel Branden (with whom she later broke), an official \u201cObjectivist\u201d philosophical movement, complete with journals and lecture courses. For all her popularity, however, only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously. As a result, most of the serious philosophical work on Rand has appeared in non-academic, non-peer-reviewed journals, or in books, and the bibliography reflects this fact. We discuss the main reasons for her rejection by most professional philosophers in the first section. Our discussion of Rand\u2019s philosophical views, especially her moral-political views, draws from both her non-fiction and her fiction, since her views cannot be accurately interpreted or evaluated without doing so.\n\n1. Introduction\n\n1.1 Ayn Rand and Philosophy\n\nIn Rand\u2019s own words, her first and greatest love, her \u201clife purpose\u201d, was \u201cthe creation of the kind of world \u2026 that represents human perfection\u201d, while her interest in philosophical knowledge was \u201conly\u201d for the sake of this purpose (Journal entry for 4 May 1946; in 1997: 479).[1] Nevertheless, her interest in philosophical knowledge continued long after she had created this world in her magnum opus, Atlas Shrugged, her last work of fiction. In her non-fiction, Rand developed a conception of metaphysical realism, rationality, ethical egoism (rational self-interest), individual rights, laissez-faire capitalism, and art, and applied her philosophy to social issues. She wrote polemical, philosophical essays, often in response to questions by fans of Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead; lectured on college campuses; and gave radio and television interviews. In her own words, her philosophy,\n\nin essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute. (Rand 1957 [1992]: Afterword)\n\nCapitalism, \u201cthe unknown ideal\u201d, is for her the only political-economic system compatible with this philosophy because it is the only system based on respect for human beings as ends in themselves. The free-market libertarian political movement, though largely disowned by Rand, drew\u2014and draws\u2014great inspiration from her moral defense of the minimal state, that is, the state whose only raison d\u2019\u00eatre is protection of individual rights.\n\nWhereas Rand\u2019s ideas and mode of presentation make Rand popular with many non-academics, they lead to the opposite outcome with academics. She developed some of her views in response to questions from her readers, but seldom took the time to defend them against possible objections or to reconcile them with the views expressed in her novels. Her philosophical essays lack the self-critical, detailed style of analytic philosophy, or any serious attempt to consider possible objections to her views. Her polemical style, often contemptuous tone, and the dogmatism and cult-like behavior of many of her fans also suggest that her work is not worth taking seriously.[2] Further, understanding her views requires reading her fiction, but her fiction is not to everyone\u2019s taste. It does not help that she often dismisses other philosophers\u2019 views on the basis of cursory readings and conversations with a few philosophers and with her young philosophy student acolytes. Some contemporary philosophers return the compliment by dismissing her work contemptuously on the basis of hearsay. Some who do read her work point out that her arguments too often do not support her conclusions. This estimate is shared even by many who find her conclusions and her criticisms of contemporary culture, morality, and politics original and insightful. It is not surprising, then, that she is either mentioned in passing, or not mentioned at all, in the entries that discuss current philosophical thought about virtue ethics, egoism, rights, libertarianism, or markets. (Readers may also find the entry on Nozick\u2019s political philosophy to be of interest.) We present specific criticisms of her arguments and claims below, in the relevant sections of this entry.\n\n1.2 Life and Work\n\nAyn Rand was born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum, to a bourgeois Jewish family in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 2 February 1905. A witness to the Russian Revolution and civil war, Rand opposed both the Communists and the Tsarists. She majored in history, but the social science program in which she was enrolled at Petrograd State University included philosophy, law, and philology. Her teachers emphasized\u2014as she herself later did\u2014the importance of developing systematic connections among different areas of thought (Sciabarra 2013). Rand\u2019s formal philosophical education included ancient philosophy (especially Plato and Aristotle), logic, philosophical psychology, Marxism-Leninism, and non-Marxist political thought. But she was evidently also exposed to Hegelian and Nietzschean ideas, which blossomed during this period (known as the Russian Silver Age), and read a great deal of Friedrich Nietzsche on her own. After graduating from Petrograd State University in 1924, an interest in screenwriting led her to enroll in the State Institute for Cinematography. On the literary side, she studied the great Russian novelists and poets, but fell in love with Victor Hugo, to whose influence she owes the \u201cRomantic Realism\u201d of her novels.\n\nIn 1925 Rand succeeded in obtaining permission to visit relatives in the United States; hating the Soviet system, she left with no intention of returning. After six months with relatives in Chicago, she made her way to Hollywood where, on her second day, a fortuitous encounter with Cecil B. DeMille led to a job as a script reader, and later as a screenplay writer. The next week she had another fortuitous encounter, this time with the actor Frank O\u2019Connor, whom she married in 1929. She was married to him till his death in 1979. She adopted the pen name Ayn Rand to (it is thought) protect her family back in Russia, although she also told the New York Evening Post in 1936 that \u201cRand\u201d was an abbreviation of her Russian surname.\n\nRand and her husband moved permanently to New York City in 1951, where she became involved with, and was influenced by, the circle of mostly New-York-based intellectuals involved in the revival of classical liberalism, such as the economic journalist Henry Hazlitt, the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, and the Canadian-American novelist, literary critic, and political philosopher Isabel Paterson. Rand also studied, and was a great admirer of, the Lockean philosophy of the American founding. Rand lived and worked in New York City until her death in 1982.\n\nRand holds that philosophy, like all forms of knowledge and achievement, is important only because it is necessary for living a good human life and creating a world conducive to living such a life. Philosophy supplies the most fundamental cognitive and normative abstractions which, respectively, identify and evaluate what is. Everyone, according to Rand, needs a philosophy and is guided by at least an implicit one (1982a: ch. 1). Her novels express her belief that if our philosophy is more or less correct, our lives will be more or less successful, if our philosophy is wildly off the mark, our lives will be disastrous. Philosophy thus has an urgent, practical importance. But unlike Marx, her philosophical and political antipode, Rand thinks that social change has to start with a moral revolution within each individual and the spread of the right ideas and ideals through rational discourse and the inspiration of art.\n\nRand\u2019s ideal human being appears, in varying degrees of development, in all her novels; her ideal world appears in Atlas Shrugged. Her novels feature striking, complex plots with subtle psychological explorations of her characters\u2019 emotions and thoughts, and philosophical reflections that rarely lose sight of the dramatic context. Like many famous Russian novelists, especially Dostoevsky, whom she recognized as a great psychologist, Rand also uses long speeches to lay out her philosophy, a device that has both its supporters and its detractors. She described Atlas Shrugged as a \u201cstunt novel\u201d and a murder mystery\u2014the murder of the human soul by a collectivist culture. By \u201csoul\u201d, however, she meant not an immortal substance that survives the death of the body\u2014she is not a dualist in any aspect of her philosophy\u2014but the mind, or the human spirit that celebrates life on this earth. She took a familiar phenomenon and literary trope\u2014a workers\u2019 strike\u2014and turned it on its head to show what happens when \u201cthe men of mind\u201d\u2014scientists, philosophers, industrialists, entrepreneurs, writers\u2014the \u201cprime movers\u201d of a society\u2014go on strike. It also purports to show how the wrong metaphysics can lead to the wrong ethics and thus to disastrous personal choices and a disastrous political and economic system, and how the right philosophy is needed for the rebirth of the soul and the rebuilding of the world. Her protagonists are not knights on white steeds rescuing damsels in distress, or swordsmen who can fight off a dozen enemies single-handed, but men and women in the mid-20th century industrial America of steel mills, skyscrapers, and glimmering highways: women who run transcontinental railroads and men who revolutionize architecture or (long before clean energy became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre) build a motor powered by static electricity to produce limitless, clean energy. Her novels show the importance of striving to be the best we can be:\n\nDo not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but never have been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible\u2026. (Atlas Shrugged, 1957 [1992]: 983).\n\nHer novels inspire readers because they present heroes of unbreached integrity, heroes who lead colorful and remarkable lives and succeed not in spite of, but because of, their uncompromising virtue. This estimate of their virtue is not, of course, shared by all: many readers find her characters wooden, her writing stilted, and her ethical and political views misguided.\n\nRand paid tribute to Aristotle, whom she considered the greatest of all philosophers, in the titles she gave to the three Parts of Atlas Shrugged (Non-Contradiction, Either-Or, A is A) and to one of the chapters (The Immovable Movers). While she differed sharply from Nietzsche on many issues, including rationality, free will, and individual rights, his influence is evident in her provocative, often aphoristic, point-counterpoint writing style, as well as in her \u201ctransvaluation\u201d of traditional values and her powerful affirmation of life and joy and the spirit of youth. In the Introduction to the 25th Anniversary edition of The Fountainhead, she stated that the novel\u2019s sense of life is best conveyed by a quotation from Nietzsche\u2019s Beyond Good and Evil: \u201cThe noble soul has reverence for itself\u201d. (For The Fountainhead\u2019s partly sympathetic and partly critical engagement with Nietzsche\u2019s ideas, see Hunt 2006.)\n\n1.3 Metaphysics and Epistemology\n\nFundamental to Rand\u2019s outlook\u2014so fundamental that she derives the name of her philosophical system, \u201cObjectivism\u201d, from it\u2014is a trichotomy among three categories: the intrinsic, the subjective, and the objective (ITOE: 52\u201354; Rand 1965: 13\u201323). An intrinsic phenomenon is one whose nature depends wholly on factors external to the mind; a subjective phenomenon is one whose nature depends wholly on the mind; and an objective phenomenon is defined, variously, as that which depends on the relation between a living entity\u2019s nature (including the nature of its mind) and its environment, or as that which depends on the relation between a properly functioning (rational) mind and extramental reality. Commentators are divided over the best way to interpret Rand\u2019s views on this issue.\n\nRand holds that there is a widespread tendency to ignore the third category or to assimilate it to the second, thus setting up a false dichotomy between the intrinsic and the subjective. On Rand\u2019s view, many of the fundamental questions of philosophy, from the existence of universals to the nature of value, involve fruitless debates over the false alternative \u201cintrinsic or subjective?\u201d in cases where the phenomenon in question is neither intrinsic nor subjective, but rather objective.\n\nIf ethics is the branch of philosophy concerned with practice, then in a sense all of Rand\u2019s philosophy is ethics, for Rand stresses \u201cthe supremacy of actual living over all other considerations\u201d, and insists that philosophy needs to be \u201cbrought up to the realm of actual living\u201d\u2014adding \u201cI say intentionally brought up to it, not down\u201d (Journal entry for 15 May 1934, p. 72; in Rand 1997: 73). Consequently, Rand regularly concerns herself with the practical implications and social relevance not only of moral and political philosophy, but likewise of the seemingly more arcane strata of metaphysics and epistemology\u2014as when she identifies errors in concept-formation as one of the roots of racism, or mind-body dualism as a root of the dichotomy between economic and personal freedom. This approach likewise reflects Rand\u2019s emphasis on integrating each piece of information into the total context of one\u2019s knowledge, and her consequent hostility to compartmentalization.\n\nRand\u2019s conviction of the vital practical importance of abstract theory may help to explain the passionately polemical nature of her philosophical writing (which some readers find inspiring and others hyperbolic and off-putting), although Nietzsche\u2019s influence, as well as the influence of her Marxist-Leninist education also probably play a role. Rand also tended\u2014perhaps owing in part to the same two influences\u2014to regard philosophical errors as revelatory of the psychological flaws of their authors.\n\nFor a more in-depth presentation of Rand\u2019s views on epistemology and metaphysics, please see the supplement on Epistemology and Metaphysics\n\n2. Ethics\n\n2.1 What is Ethics, and Why do we need It?\n\nEthics\n\nis a code of values to guide man\u2019s choices and actions\u2014the choices and actions that determine the purpose and the course of his life. (1961b: 13)\n\nBefore we can decide which code of values we should accept, we need to ask why we need a code of values at all. Rand claims that no philosopher before her has provided a scientific answer to this question, and so none has provided a satisfactory ethics.\n\nRand starts by describing value or \u201cthe good\u201d, in classical fashion, as the object of pursuit: \u201cthat which one acts to gain and/or keep\u201d (1961b: 16). Thus, the concept of value presupposes the concept of \u201can entity capable of acting to achieve a goal in the face of an alternative\u201d\u2014and the basic alternative facing any living entity is life or death (1961b: 16). It is the conditional nature of life that gives rise to values, not just human values, but values as such. As she puts it:\n\nMetaphysically, life is the only phenomenon that is an end in itself: a value gained and kept by a constant process of action. (1961b: 18)\n\nSurvival is the organism\u2019s ultimate value, the \u201cfinal goal or end to which all [its] lesser goals are the means\u201d, and the standard of all its other values: \u201cthat which furthers its life is the good, that which threatens it is the evil\u201d (pp. 16\u201317). The same, suitably modified, applies to human beings. Life is the standard and goal of all genuine human values, in the sense that all of them\u2014from food to philosophy to fine art to ethics\u2014must be explained and justified as requirements of human survival. \u201cEthics is an objective, metaphysical necessity of man\u2019s survival\u201d (p. 24). Thus,\n\n[t]he standard of value of the Objectivist ethics \u2026 is man\u2019s life, or: that which is required for man\u2019s survival qua man, (1961b: 25)\n\nthat is,\n\nthe terms, methods, conditions and goals required for the survival of a rational being through the whole of his lifespan\u2014in all those aspects of existence which are open to his choice. (1961b: 27)\n\nTo choose to live is to accept one\u2019s \u201cown life\u201d as one\u2019s \u201cethical purpose\u201d.\n\nRand\u2019s metaphysical arguments make three points central to her axiology and ethics. (1) All living entities have values, not only human beings, and only living entities have values: life necessitates value, and value depends on life. (2) An entity\u2019s values are determined by its objective life-needs, that is, by the requirements of survival for entities of its kind, and ethics is a requirement of human survival. (3) Thus, values are neither intrinsic properties of things, nor subjective, neither free-floating Platonic entities, nor mere matters of preference, time, or culture. Rather, values are relational or objective, dependent on the nature of the valuing entity and the nature of its environment.\n\nRand supports the first point by arguing that the concept of value entails the concept of life:\n\nepistemologically, the concept of \u201cvalue\u201d is genetically dependent upon and derived from the antecedent concept of \u201clife\u201d. (1961b: 18)\n\nShe asks the reader to\n\nimagine an immortal, indestructible robot, an entity which moves and acts, but which cannot be affected by anything, which cannot be changed in any respect, which cannot be damaged, injured or destroyed. (1961b: 16)\n\nSuch an entity, she concludes, cannot have values.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that all it shows is that an entity that cannot be destroyed or harmed cannot have values, and not that a non-living entity cannot have values. Unlike the robot of this example, real robots can be damaged or destroyed, by external as well as internal events. What it means for them to be damaged or destroyed is that they cannot perform their functions well, or at all. Hence they can, quite straightforwardly, be said to have values.[3] To take this into account, Rand would have to say that for an entity that has a function, values are determined by what it needs to function (well), and that the function of living beings is to survive (well). Hence she can still maintain that for living things, values are determined by its objective life-needs, hence that values are objective, and that ethics is a requirement of a proper human survival.\n\nRand\u2019s naturalism, and her rejection of intrinsicism and subjectivism in favor of objectivism, anticipate recent naturalisms and echo Aristotle\u2019s argument, against both the Platonist and the subjectivist, that \u201cthe good\u201d must always be good-for-something. Her conception of the function of morality is notable both for its affinity to, and its difference from, Thomas Hobbes\u2019 conception: like Hobbes, Rand sees morality as a necessary means to long-term survival, but unlike Hobbes, she does not see morality as requiring a contract or even as a fundamentally social affair. The need for morality, according to Rand, is dictated by our nature as creatures that must think and produce to survive; hence we would need morality even on a desert island. There is, however, no duty to survive; morality is based on a hypothetical imperative: if you choose to live, then you must value your own long-term survival as an ultimate end, and morality as a necessary means to it. If asked why the choice to live commits you to your own long-term survival rather than some other ultimate end (such as, for example, the greatest happiness of the greatest number (Nozick 1971), or becoming worthy of eternal life in heaven), the only answer is: because any other ultimate end, if consistently adhered to, would lead to death.\n\nRand\u2019s ethics is thus firmly teleological, this-worldly, and foundationalist. Virtue is \u201cthe act by which one gains/and or keeps\u201d values in light of a recognition of certain facts (1961b: 27, 28); it \u201cis not an end in itself \u2026 not its own reward\u201d (1957 [1992]: 939). A fact central to a \u201cscientific\u201d ethics is that reason is the chief indispensable human tool of survival, and we exercise reason by choice. Hence rationality is the fundamental moral virtue, a virtue implicated in all the other virtues, including productiveness (Section 2.4 below).\n\nRand is widely credited by Objectivists (Peikoff 1991; Binswanger 1990, 1992; Kelley & Thomas 1999\u2014see Other Internet Resources; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000, 2006) with having solved the is-ought problem by showing that morality is essential for long-term survival as a rational being, and so anyone who chooses to live ought to be moral (1961b: 19). But if the choice to live is itself a moral choice, in the sense that we ought to choose to live, then the argument proceeds from an ought to an ought, not from an is to an ought. On the other hand, if the choice to live is a non-moral choice (an idea that\u2019s hard to reconcile with Rand\u2019s general view that all significant choices are moral choices), then suicide can never be wrong, even if it is done for cowardly, irresponsible, or unjust reasons, a view that is obviously incoherent (King 1984 and Narveson 1998 criticize this and other aspects of Rand\u2019s moral views). Again, if morality is needed only for long-term survival, and choosing death is not immoral, then a suicide-bomber does no wrong in killing innocent people. But people don\u2019t lose their rights just because their killer has decided to kill himself. Darryl Wright seeks to save something of the commonsense view that the suicide-bomber acts wrongly by arguing that his choice to die without good reason \u201ccorresponds to a real defect or corruption\u201d in him (Wright 2011: 26\u201329). But this verdict contradicts the premise that choosing death is not immoral. For if the choice expresses a corruption in the character of the suicide-bomber, then the choice itself is immoral. Moreover, this response leaves untouched the most important criticism of the suicide-bomber\u2019s actions: that he violates other people\u2019s rights by using them as mere means to his own (wicked) ends.\n\nMore fundamentally, the very idea of morality resting on the choice to live is questionable (Long 2000, Badhwar 2001). Most of us rarely, if ever, make a choice to live: we live by default. By giving us desires for food and water, for pleasure and security, Nature gives us, as she gives other animals, the implicit desire to stay alive. Perhaps the most dramatic evidence is the existence of feral children, children who have managed to stay alive for years in the company of wild animals. When we grow up, the only time we seriously ask ourselves if we want to live or die is when living requires an effort on our part, such as in a grave illness, or deep depression, or emergency. But we start learning the difference between right and wrong (for example, don\u2019t hit others, don\u2019t grab their things, and so on) long before we ever consider whether to live or die. A deeper reflection on morality begins when we mature and start asking ourselves what constitutes happiness and a worthwhile life. But this is an inherently moral question to which the answers are inherently moral or immoral.\n\nLet let us now return to the question of how we should understand the relationship between long-term survival and survival as a rational being\u2014the life \u201cproper to a rational being\u201d (Rand 1961b: 27). Is a life proper to a rational being a necessary means, and only a necessary means, to literal, long-term survival? Or is such a life itself the ultimate goal, the kind of survival worth having? Again, what are we to make of the many passages in which Rand states that the ultimate goal is one\u2019s own happiness?\n\nSome of Rand\u2019s statements suggest that she had only one, consistent ethical view: the ultimate goal is the individual\u2019s own survival; the only way to survive long-term, i.e., over a complete life-span, is to live by the standard of man\u2019s life as a rational being, which means: to live morally; and happiness is the psychological \u201cresult, reward and concomitant\u201d (p. 32) of living thus. Many of Rand\u2019s commentators follow her in holding that there is only one consistent view, while disagreeing on the right interpretation of it (Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1978; Machan 1984, 2000; Peikoff 1991; Bidinotto 1994\u2014see Other Internet Resources; Hunt 1999; Kelley & Thomas 1999\u2014see Other Internet Resources; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000, 2006). Others (Mack 1984, 2003; Badhwar 1999, 2001; Long 2000) argue that Rand\u2019s writings actually allow of two, if not three, mutually incompatible views of the ultimate goal, and our task is to see which of these is the dominant or most plausible view. The three views are: survival, survival qua rational being, and happiness in the ancient Aristotelian sense of flourishing or eudaimonia. In the rest of Section 2, we will present the textual evidence for each of these views of the final goal, and the common objections to them, in turn.\n\nAll three views are, of course, egoist, in that the primary or sole intended beneficiary of morality is supposed to be the moral agent herself. But some of the criticisms usually levied at egoism lose some of their force when directed at the second and third views.\n\n2.2 Survival as the Ultimate Value\n\nThe survivalist view holds that just as literal survival is the ultimate value for other living entities, so it is for human beings (Kelley & Thomas 1999; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000). Survival is the source and final goal of all the actions of an entity, that which gives point to all its other values. For human beings, morality and happiness are both instrumental means to survival. The vicious can \u201cachieve their goals [only] for the range of a moment\u201d, as evidenced by \u201cany criminal or any dictatorship\u201d (1961b: 26).\n\n\u201cNon-survivalists\u201d make the following objections:\n\nThe biological premise that survival is the ultimate goal of all living things is mistaken. Animals of many species risk their own lives for the sake of reproduction, or for protecting their young or even their group. But even if survival were the ultimate goal of other species, it need not be ours. Even if our own survival needs were the source of all our values, it would not follow that survival must be the ultimate psychological and moral goal to which all our other values are merely necessary means. The genesis of x does not logically determine the ultimate goal of x. For example, the source of sexual desire is our reproductive capacity but, as Rand would agree, it doesn\u2019t follow that we ought to satisfy our sexual desires only if we want to reproduce. The survivalist view that turns happiness into a mere means to survival entails, quite implausibly, that a long, unhappy life is better than a somewhat shorter but happy life, and just as good as a long and happy one. Many dictators, including the Pharaohs of the past and the Stalins and Maos of the 20th century, have survived by making elaborate plans to preserve their lives and their power by using a combination of terror, myth, and bribery. Their gross injustice poses a far greater threat to the lives of their subordinates than to their own. Morality enhances the individual\u2019s chances of survival under normal circumstances, but it is not necessary for survival. And in some circumstances, such as in a dictatorship, acting morally decreases the individual\u2019s chances of survival, a point that Rand herself convincingly dramatizes in We the Living and Anthem. A survivalist ethics can support, at best, a bare-bones Hobbesian morality, not a virtue ethics. If Rand\u2019s virtues were necessary for survival, the human species would have perished a long time ago, instead of expanding exponentially. Her rich and challenging picture of human life and virtue in her novels points to a richer and more challenging conception of the final end than mere survival. Many of Rand\u2019s heroes, from Kira (We the Living) to Prometheus (Anthem) to John Galt (Atlas Shrugged), risk their lives for the sake of the values that make their lives worth living. Like Hobbes, Rand rightly points out that if everyone or most people were to start preying on each other, then no one would survive for long\u2014literally, and that generations of predators would end up destroying or driving away the producers, and thus destroying themselves (Anthem and Atlas Shrugged). But this doesn\u2019t show that a few predators in a society of producers cannot survive by predation. Indeed, Rand herself sometimes acknowledges that evil people can survive by free-riding (\u201chitch-hiking\u201d, as she calls it) on rational, productive people: If some men attempt to survive by means of brute force or fraud \u2026 it still remains true that their survival is made possible only by their victims, only by the men who choose to think and to produce the goods which they, the looters, are seizing. (1961b: 25) Rand often says that the final end is survival proper to a human being (1961b: 26), or that the final end is happiness (1961b: 27, 30). Neither can be reduced to survival simpliciter. In \u201cMan\u2019s Rights\u201d, Rand explains an individual\u2019s right to his own life as the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life. (1963b: 93 and 1967a: 321\u201322) \u201cLife\u201d here is explicated in terms of not only continued survival but also of fulfillment and enjoyment.\n\nFor all these reasons, a more plausible interpretation of Rand\u2019s view is that morality is required for surviving qua human being, that is, for living a life proper to a human being.\n\n2.3 Survival Qua Man as the Ultimate Value\n\nJust as the standard of value is survival qua human being, so the ultimate goal is one\u2019s own survival qua human being. To accept this standard and goal is to accept (i) the three cardinal values of reason, purpose (or purposiveness) and self-esteem as not only \u201cthe means to\u201d but also \u201cthe realization of one\u2019s ultimate value, one\u2019s own life\u201d (1961b: 27), and (ii) the three \u201ccorresponding virtues\u201d of rationality, productiveness, and pride. These values are means to one\u2019s life insofar as they further one\u2019s life as a rational being, and they realize it insofar as they express the value we place on our lives.\n\nWhat it means to value survival qua human being turns on the relationship of the three cardinal values to the three virtues. Rand often states that virtue is only a means to value. But when she explains how the three cardinal values \u201ccorrespond\u201d to their three virtues, she does not provide a means-end analysis (Badhwar 1999, 2001). Thus, she says:\n\nProductive work is the central purpose of a rational man\u2019s life, the central value that integrates and determines the hierarchy of all his other values. Reason is the source, the precondition of his productive work\u2014pride is the result. (1961b: 27)\n\nThe virtue of productiveness becomes the central example of purpose (one of the three cardinal values), reason (another cardinal value) becomes its source, and the virtue of pride becomes its result. Rand also defines rationality, which is \u201cthe basic virtue\u201d, in terms of\n\nthe recognition and acceptance of reason as one\u2019s only source of knowledge \u2026 and one\u2019s only guide to action. (1961b: 28)\n\nBy this definition, being rational means valuing reason in thought, word, and deed, and realizing reason in one\u2019s life means being rational: the virtue and the value entail each other.\n\nThis point generalizes to all the virtues and values. Further, since the (cardinal) values are both \u201cthe means to\u201d and \u201cthe realization of one\u2019s ultimate value\u201d (1961b: 27), it follows that the (cardinal) virtues are also both the means to and the realization of one\u2019s ultimate value: long-term survival qua human being. On this interpretation, to survive qua human being is none other than to lead a virtuous life in which one has realized one\u2019s potential.\n\nBoth survivalists and eudaimonists, however, point out that this conception of the final end contradicts Rand\u2019s oft-repeated claim that \u201cVirtue is not an end in itself.\u2026\u201d In addition, eudaimonists make the following objections:\n\nSince even a long, virtuous life need not be a happy one, positing it as the final end contradicts Rand\u2019s related claim that \u201cLife is the reward of virtue\u2014and happiness is the goal and reward of life\u201d (1957 [1992]: 939). It contradicts Rand\u2019s conception of the final end in her novels, where happiness is proclaimed as \u201cthe purpose, the sanction and the meaning of life\u201d (1957 [1992]: 674).\n\nIn addition, it is psychologically implausible to hold that we would choose mere survival as an end even if we were deeply unhappy and saw no happiness in our future (cf. Wright 2019 20).\n\nEudaimonists hold that the dominant and/or more plausible view expressed in Rand\u2019s writings is that happiness\u2014a happy life\u2014is the ultimate value, where a happy life is understood as a life of emotional fulfillment in worthwhile goals and activities. Happiness in this sense necessarily involves virtue, but is not identical with virtue (Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1978; Machan 1984, 2000; Mack 1984; Badhwar 1999, 2001; Hunt 1999; Long 2000).[4]\n\n2.4 Happiness as the Ultimate Value\n\nHappiness is the existentially and psychologically \u201csuccessful state of life\u201d (1961b: 27). As an emotion it is not simply a positive subjective state, as on some contemporary views, but an emotion that meets certain normative standards: \u201ca state of non-contradictory joy\u2014a joy without penalty or guilt\u201d, achievable only by\n\nthe man who desires nothing but rational goals, seeks nothing but rational values and finds his joy in nothing but rational actions. (1961b: 32)\n\nHappiness is also a form of life-affirmation:\n\nthe feeling of one\u2019s blessing upon the whole of the earth, the feeling of being in love with the fact that one exists and in this kind of world. (1957 [1992]: 105\u20136)\n\nThus, happiness is an emotionally positive state of mind in an objectively worthwhile state of life.\n\nRand holds that the pursuit of happiness is inseparable from the activity of maintaining one\u2019s life through the rational pursuit of rational goals (1961b: 29, 32). A virtuous life is, thus, essential to happiness. It is also a shield against soul-wracking unhappiness. Just as even great misfortunes don\u2019t throw Aristotle\u2019s virtuous individual into misery, they don\u2019t throw Rand\u2019s heroes into misery. Even at the worst of times, the virtuous individual\u2019s pain \u201conly goes down to a certain point\u201d (1943: 344), never touching the core of her being: the conviction that she is worthy and capable of happiness.[5]\n\nIn keeping with their richer conception of the final end, Rand\u2019s novels also employ a richer conception of virtue as an integrated intellectual-emotional character trait to think, feel, and act in certain ways, rather than simply as an act in light of a recognition of certain facts (Badhwar 1999, 2001). Her characters reveal their souls not only in what they say or do, notice or fail to notice, focus on or evade, on this or that occasion, but in their cognitive, emotional, and action dispositions, their style of being in the world. Their actions show not only an intellectual commitment to the right but a wholehearted \u201clove of rectitude\u201d (1957 [1992]: 512).\n\nThis basically Aristotelian view of virtue goes hand-in-hand with a basically Aristotelian view of emotions. Rand rejects the reason-emotion dichotomy as stemming, ultimately, from a false mind-body dichotomy. Emotions are neither raw feelings nor inherently irrational but, rather, automatized value-judgments:\n\nestimates of that which furthers man\u2019s values or threatens them \u2026 lightning calculators giving him the sum of his profit or loss. (1961b: 27)\n\nEmotions provide instant guidance when circumstances do not permit reasoning everything out anew. But our emotions are only as good as our reason, because they are \u201cprogrammed\u201d by our reason. Hence they can only be corrected by conscious reasoning, and in a conflict between reason and emotions, one must always side with the former.[6]\n\nEudaimonists argue that Rand\u2019s vision of a virtuous and happy life in her novels can be understood only as a form of eudaimonism, even if she sometimes makes statements inconsistent with this vision. The chief objection to eudaimonism is that, by defining a happy life partly in terms of virtue, it employs an unconvincing conception of happiness. The philosophical literature on happiness in this sense (usually called well-being) makes and answers this and other such objections (Annas 1993, Haybron 2008, Badhwar 2014).\n\n2.5 Virtues, Vices, and Egoism\n\nThe chief Objectivist virtues are rationality, integrity, honesty (with self and others), justice, independence, productiveness, and pride. Rationality,\n\none\u2019s total commitment \u2026 to the maintenance of a full mental focus in all issues, in all choices \u2026 to the fullest perception of reality within one\u2019s power, (1961b: 28)\n\nis the basic virtue of which the other virtues are aspects or derivatives. The virtues are thus united or reciprocal. Each virtue is defined partly in terms of a recognition of, and appropriate responsiveness to, some important fact or facts, a recognition and responsiveness understood by the agent to be indispensable for gaining, maintaining, or expressing her ultimate value. For example, integrity is \u201cthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake your consciousness\u201d (1957 [1992]: 936), a recognition that is expressed in loyalty to one\u2019s rational values and convictions, especially in the face of social pressures to surrender them (1961b: 28; 1964a: 52, 80); honesty is \u201cthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake existence\u201d, a recognition that is expressed in truthfulness in thought and speech (1957 [1992]: 936\u201337); and justice is\n\nthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake the character of men as you cannot fake the character of nature, \u2026 that every man must be judged for what he is and treated accordingly\u2026. (1957 [1992]: 937)\n\nConspicuous by their absence from Rand\u2019s list of the cardinal virtues are the \u201cvirtues of benevolence\u201d, such as kindness, charity, generosity, and forgiveness. Rand states that charity is not a major virtue or moral duty (1964b); likewise, presumably, kindness, generosity, and forgiveness. Whether, and how much, one should help others depends on their place in one\u2019s rationally defined hierarchy of values, and on the particular circumstances (whether they are worthy of help, what the likely consequences are of helping them, and so on). The greater their value vis-\u00e0-vis one\u2019s rational self-interest, the greater the help that one should be willing to give, ceteris paribus. What is never morally appropriate is to make a sacrifice, that is, to surrender something of value to oneself for the sake of something of less or no value to oneself. Thus, it can never be moral to knowingly risk one\u2019s life for a stranger (unless, of course, one\u2019s life is no longer worth living) or to court unhappiness for the happiness of another, whether stranger or friend. It is appropriate to help a stranger only in an emergency, and only when the risk to our own life or well-being is minimal (1963c: 43\u201345). This should not be taken to imply that helping a stranger is always morally optional, regardless of the circumstances. Indeed, people who are \u201ctotally indifferent to anything living and would not lift a finger to help a man or a dog left mangled by a hit-and-run driver\u201d are \u201cpsychopaths\u201d (1963c: 43\u201345) Rand makes even more concessions to \u201ccommon sense morality\u201d when she states that it\u2019s good to help a neighbor going through a hard time till he can get back on his own feet, if we can afford to and if we have no reason to think that he is undeserving. Charity understood thus is a virtue because it is an expression of the generalized good will and respect that all normal people have towards others as creatures who share with them the capacity to value (1963c: 46\u201347). Nathaniel Branden tries to reconcile charity with egoism by declaring that the former stems from a species-identification with another, such that, in revering others, people \u201care revering their own life\u201d. By acting charitably, people actualize this sense of kinship, without sacrificing their own well-being.\n\nThis last is true, but the desire to reduce all proper motivations to egoistic motivations leads Branden (and Rand and many Objectivists) to ignore the fact that charity is first and foremost profoundly other-regarding, prompted by another\u2019s plight rather than concern for one\u2019s own self-actualization. The same is true of trying to rescue a dog mangled by a hit-and-run driver, where the egoistic motivation must be even weaker, since here there is no species-identification, but rather only a \u201cgenus-identification\u201d with another sufferer.\n\nThe problem with Rand and Branden\u2019s ethical egoism can be sharpened by asking why we should not harm others, for example, by spitefully stepping on their gouty toes. Rand and Branden\u2019s answer has to be: because doing so will harm us. But why will it harm us? Because we have unjustly and irrationally hurt another out of spite, and injustice and irrationality are bad for us. But our action wouldn\u2019t be unjust and irrational if it didn\u2019t hurt them \u2013 if, in fact, stepping on their toes cured their gout and we did it for that reason. Clearly, then, the wrongness of our action and motivation depends, in the first instance, on what we know it will do to our victims. This is why we ought to apologize to them, and not to ourselves. It\u2019s right and important to consider the effect on ourselves of being spiteful, unjust, and irrational, but there is no good argument for the view that we ought to be just to others only or primarily because it is good for us. All other-regarding virtues are responses to other people\u2019s moral standing.\n\nAt any rate, the argument from identification can also be used to justify charity towards strangers in non-emergency situations, for example, towards those who are permanently disabled and unable to care for themselves (Badhwar forthcoming). Rand concedes as much in \u201cWhat is Capitalism?\u201d (1965) where she argues that people who are unable to work must rely on voluntary charity, thus implying that it is proper for those who can afford it to support strangers in non-emergency situations. And indeed, as recent scholarship has revealed, in her own life Rand was often extremely generous, not only towards friends and acquaintances, but also strangers.[7]\n\nThe question arises why Rand thinks that charity, kindness etc. are not major virtues when they meet all the conditions of appropriateness: the recipient is worthy of help, one can afford to help, it is in one\u2019s rational self-interest (or not contrary to it) to help, and so on. Perhaps Rand thinks that they are \u201cminor\u201d virtues because we are not obligated to act on them at all times, the way we are obligated to act justly and honestly at all times. A deeper reason, however, might be her conception of people as essentially agents rather than patients, doers rather than receivers, self-sufficient rather than dependent. Nevertheless, Rand\u2019s view of the unity of the virtues dictates that, even if we are not obligated to act on charity, kindness etc. at all times, they are just as important to possess as the other virtues. Moreover, in keeping with her emphasis on the importance of goodwill towards others and \u201cthe benevolent universe premise\u201d, Rand\u2019s heroes are often extraordinarily (and almost always appropriately) kind and generous, not only towards those they love but also towards mere acquaintances, and even sometimes adversaries. Striking examples include, from The Fountainhead, Howard Roark\u2019s unsought-for attempt to give hope and courage to Steven Mallory, the gifted young sculptor whose failure to get work has driven him to the verge of a spiritual and physical collapse, and Roark\u2019s unreproachful help to his erstwhile adversary, Peter Keating, when Keating falls on hard times. In Atlas Shrugged, Dagny offers support to a heart-broken and despairing Cheryl Taggart who, in the past, has treated Dagny with scorn, and Hank Rearden generously supports his exploitative family before he realizes their exploitativeness.[8] Rand\u2019s implicit recognition that kindness and generosity are important virtues is shown also in her depiction of her villains as lacking all kindness and generosity.\n\nJust as rationality, a focus on reality, is at the heart of every virtue, so irrationality, evasion of reality (including self-deception), is at the heart of every vice. Rand\u2019s villains are all master evaders motivated by a desire for power, social status, fame, or unearned wealth, and resentment of the good. They are \u201csecond-handers\u201d\u2014people whose primary relationship is to other people rather than to reality. Between the virtuous and the vicious are the \u201cinnocently wrong\u201d, people who adopt wrong moral principles or make wrong choices, not through evasion but through an error of judgment (Rand does not explicitly recognize any moral category other than virtue, vice, and moral error, although her novels portray characters that do not easily fit into any of these categories). Hank Rearden, in Atlas Shrugged, is the great innocent living under a burden of unearned guilt because of his mistaken sense of honor and a family interested only in manipulating and using him. Cheryl Taggart is killed by the too-sudden revelation that the man she loved and admired as the embodiment of her ideals is a fraud\u2014and that the world is full of such frauds.\n\nAs already indicated, Rand justifies virtue in both instrumental and non-instrumental terms, though without distinguishing between them. The instrumental arguments show the existential and psychological rewards of virtue and costs of vice. In her depiction of her heroes, Rand shows her conviction that virtue creates an inner harmony and serenity. Virtue also makes one trustworthy, and thus enables mutually beneficial interactions with others. Evasiveness, by contrast, traps one in a \u201ctangled web\u201d of rationalizations and pretenses. The evader who deceives others is either eventually caught, or lives in fear of getting caught, becoming dependent on others\u2019 unconsciousness. He is \u201ca fool\u201d, says a character in Atlas Shrugged, \u201cwhose source of values is the fools he succeeds in fooling\u201d (1957 [1992]: 945). Further, like Sartre, Rand holds that no evasion is completely successful, because the truth constantly threatens to resurface. Hence, the evader\u2019s \u201cdiseased soul\u201d is in a state of constant inner conflict and anxiety as he tries to suppress his awareness of uncomfortable truths while maintaining his hold on others. His lack of integrity and of esteem for reality results in a lack of self-love or self-esteem and, indeed, of a solid self. (It is noteworthy, however, that Rand\u2019s portrayal of Gail Wynand in The Fountainhead is closer to Aristotle\u2019s portrayal of the vicious man in Book III of the Nicomachean Ethics as someone who is \u201cunconscious of his vice\u201d than to her own stated view of the evader.)\n\nThese views are familiar from the history of philosophy, but many readers find their expression in Rand\u2019s novels to be of unusual psychological depth and conviction. Nevertheless, the views are subject to the well-known objection that the complexity and variability of human psychology and society allow only \u201cfor the most part\u201d generalizations about the existential and psychological benefits of virtue or costs of vice. For example, it is possible for a small injustice to lead to great rewards, especially since others are willing to shrug off or forgive occasional transgressions. It is also possible for poor introspection, forgetfulness, or self-acceptance to allow one to evade something without any need for supporting evasions or damage to one\u2019s self-esteem. Again, even if every wrongdoing carries psychological costs, these might sometimes be outweighed by the long-term psychological and existential costs of doing the right thing (as Rand herself suggests in her portrayal of the embittered Henry Cameron and Stephen Mallory in The Fountainhead).\n\nThe non-instrumentalist justification of virtue in Rand\u2019s novels is largely immune to these objections (though subject to the objections noted in 2.4 above). To compromise morally is, necessarily, to compromise one\u2019s own (objectively conceived) happiness, because no existential loss can compare to the loss of moral integrity. Rectitude is partly constitutive of genuine happiness because it expresses the right relationship to reality: to existence, to oneself, and to others. For the same reason, it is partly constitutive of a self worth loving, an ideally human or rational self. Any value gained at the price of rectitude is only the simulacrum of genuine value. In a variety of conceptually interconnected ways, then, virtuous individuals are necessarily better off than those willing to take moral short-cuts. In its structure and much of its content, Rand\u2019s ethical egoism is thus of a piece with the egoism of ancient eudaimonistic theories.\n\nOf course, this non-instrumentalist justification of virtue depends on the prior instrumentalist justification, viz., that in normal circumstances (that is, in a society of more or less virtuous people), virtue enables us to gain both external and psychological goods. If justice or kindness were systematically bad for human beings, leading to disease and death, they would not be virtues. If rationality routinely led to an early demise, no one would value rationality. But this does not entail, as Salmieri seems to think, that the ultimate value is literal survival (Salmieri 2019). All it entails is that the virtues be compatible with survival in normal circumstances. For it is easy to see that if justice or kindness systematically led to deep depression, and rationality routinely sucked the joy out of life, only the rare misery-lover would value his life, or the virtues. Survival is a necessary condition of a happy life (as well as an unhappy one), not an ultimate value. And it\u2019s only because the virtues lead to, and partly constitute, a happy (eudaimonic) life, that a virtuous person considers it a greater loss to betray his principles than to lose the work he loves \u2013 or, sometimes, even his life. One of the best examples of this from Rand\u2019s own work is Howard Roark\u2019s decision to act out of integrity, even at the cost of being unable to practice architecture (The Fountainhead). Another example concerns two minor characters in We The Living who risk \u2013 and lose \u2013 their freedom and lives for resisting the new communist regime. (Note, however, that Rand does not think that we are morally obligated to martyr ourselves to fight evil. All we are obligated to do is not be complicit in evil, or betray our values.)\n\nEven on this indirect, sophisticated egoism, where the good to the agent lies in being virtuous, Rand\u2019s theory is open to the objection often levied against egoistic theories, viz., that they give the wrong reason for acting in other-regarding ways \u2013 justly, kindly, etc. My act does not adequately express the virtue of justice if I give you your due solely or primarily because acting justly is good for me rather than because I recognize and respect your moral standing, your entitlement to be treated justly. Nor does my helping you when you need help adequately express goodwill or kindness if I help you solely or primarily because acting benevolently is good for me. One way out taken by some other theories is to argue that the egoist\u2019s justification is egoistic but not her motivation. Rand does not address the \u201cwrong-reason\u201d objection, but there is no hint in her writings that she would accept this dichotomy between justification and motivation. The root of the problem is that, although Rand rejects psychological egoism, she seems to regard genuine goodwill towards, or love of, others as an offshoot of proper self-love, as though there were no independent source of love for others in human nature. This is where her metaethics and ethics differ most starkly from that of Aristotle.\n\n2.6 Altruism\n\nAccording to Rand, there is only one alternative to being rationally self-interested: sacrificing one\u2019s proper interests, either for the sake of other people (which she equates with altruism) or for the sake of the supernatural (which she calls mysticism) (1982a: ch. 7). \u201cThe basic principle of altruism\u201d, she argues, \u201cis that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the only justification of his existence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue and value\u201d (\u201cFaith and Force,\u201d PWNI 61). Kant\u2019s ethics is a secularized mysticism insofar as it rests on categorical commands and duty for duty\u2019s sake, which is to say: regardless of any earthly desire or interest (1970). An altruistic ethics equates right action with self-sacrifice for the sake of others\u2019 good and immorality with \u201cselfishness\u201d, while saying nothing about the standard of the good (\u201cIntroduction\u201d, 1964a: iii; 1974). It thus fails to answer the prior question of what code of values we should follow and why, and provides no motivation to be moral other than guilt over \u201cselfishness\u201d. When taken to its logical conclusion, altruism does not simply tell us that it is \u201cselfish\u201d to pursue our own desires, but also that it is \u201cselfish to uphold\u2026 [our own] convictions, \u2026 [that we] must sacrifice them to the convictions of others\u201d (Rand 1957 [1992]: 943; Galt\u2019s Speech, Rand 1961a: 142). In foreign policy, altruism is used to justify and gain support for America\u2019s intervention in other countries (1966a). Altruism is also the reason why so many sympathize with, or even praise, bloody dictatorships that proudly proclaim that the sacrifice of the individual is a necessary and noble means to the goal of the collective good (Rand 1966a).\n\nAs a moral code, altruism is impractical, because its requirements are contrary to the requirements of life and happiness, both the agent\u2019s and other people\u2019s. As such, it is also profoundly immoral. Altruism leaves us without any moral guidance in our everyday lives and gives morality a bad name.\n\nWhat, then, is the psychological explanation for the widespread equation of altruism with morality? Rand suggests various explanations reminiscent of Nietzsche\u2019s analysis of the psychology of altruism. The theorists and preachers of altruism are motivated largely by a desire to control and manipulate others by playing on their guilt. Those who accept their teachings typically do so either because of guilt over their own superior achievements, or because, lacking any \u201cintellectual integrity, love of truth\u2026or a passionate dedication to an idea\u201d, they have nothing much worth saving, and so do not mind sacrificing themselves (\u201cSelfishness Without a Self\u201d, 1973b; 1982a). Some altruists are altruists because their mentalities are still frozen in a tribal past when survival required the sacrifice of some for the sake of others (1973b). Rand herself rejects a zero-sum picture of human relationships, so long as everyone in the relationship acts rationally.\n\nRand\u2019s defense of \u201cselfishness\u201d (rational self-interest) and rejection of altruism (living for others\u2019 sake) are part of the reason both for her popularity with the general reader, and her unpopularity with philosophers and other intellectuals, although some would no doubt agree with her rejection of abject self-sacrifice and her recognition of proper concern with the self as moral (Falk 1963; Gilligan 1982; Hampton 1993; Badhwar 1993a). The general reader who responds positively to Rand\u2019s work finds, for the first time, a moral justification for pursuing a life of her or his own and a liberation from \u201cunearned guilt\u201d. The philosopher who responds negatively to her work finds many biased and simplistic interpretations of philosophers and philosophical doctrines, including her claim that she is the first to consistently defend a morality of rational self-interest, all other philosophers having defended either altruism or mysticism (Pojman 1995). Her critics also challenge her equation of altruism with abject self-sacrifice (Rachels 2000, Flew 1984), and her claim (explained below) that there is no conflict between people\u2019s rational interests (Flew 1984).\n\n3. Social-Political Philosophy\n\n3.1 Rights, Capitalism, the Trader Principle, and Government\n\n\u201cForce and mind are opposites; morality ends where a gun begins\u201d (Atlas Shrugged 1023). Not only actually shooting someone, but also threatening him with a gun, is an act of force. The non-initiation of force against others is the basic moral principle guiding our interactions with others, whether in a political society, or in the state of nature. It is also the basic political principle: \u201cno man may initiate the use of physical force against others. \u2026 Men have the right to use physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use\u201d (1961b, 1964a: 36). This political principle binds not only individuals in their interactions with each other, but also, importantly, the government. Rand\u2019s ideal society is a society of independent individuals who respect each other\u2019s rights to life, liberty, and property, and who trade value for value, materially and spiritually. They live, in her words, by \u201cthe trader principle\u201d. Individual rights and the trader principle are both dictated by the fact that, as rational, independent beings, we need to think and act for our \u201cproper survival\u201d (1961b: 31). Both are based in human nature, and required by respect for individuals as ends in themselves, not mere means to others\u2019 ends. But what exactly is a right?\n\n\u201cRights\u201d are a moral concept\u2014the concept that provides a logical transition from the principles guiding an individual\u2019s actions to the principles guiding his relationship with others\u2014the concept that preserves and protects individual morality in a social context\u2014the link between the moral code of a man and the legal code of a society, between ethics and politics. Individual rights are the means of subordinating society to moral law. (1963b: 92).\n\nAgain,\n\nA \u201cright\u201d is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man\u2019s freedom of action in a social context. (1964a 93).\n\nThese rights are based in human nature, and are basically rights to actions, not to things or outcomes, and they can be violated only through the initiation or threat of force, or through fraud. Hence, all natural rights are negative, that is, claims on others\u2019 non-interference, and not claims on them to provide one with certain goods or outcomes.[9] The fundamental right is the right to life: the right to take the actions necessary for sustaining the life proper to a human being.\n\nThe right to life means\u2026the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life. (Such is the meaning of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.). (1963b: 93)\n\nThe right to liberty is the right to act (including to write and speak) on one\u2019s judgment; the right to the pursuit of happiness is the right to pursue goals for one\u2019s own fulfillment; the right to property is \u201cthe right to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values\u201d (1963b: 94). Like the mind-body dichotomy, the common dichotomy between \u201chuman rights\u201d and the right to property is a false one, because to own one\u2019s life is to own one\u2019s actions and their fruits (1962b: 91).[10] Just as there is a causal and logical connection between the virtues, so there is between these rights: a government that violates human rights also violates property rights. Thus, for example, in violating the right to freedom of expression by banning \u201cobscene\u201d speech on TV, the government violates the property right of the owners of the TV station to use their property as they see fit. Like other libertarians, both right (market) and left (egalitarian), Rand opposes state regulation of morality, as well as forced service to the state, whether military or civilian. She criticizes both conservatives and liberals (as these terms are understood in American politics) for wanting government to control the realm they regard as important: the spiritual or moral realm in the case of conservatives, and the material or economic realm in the case of liberals (1981b). Both sides thus betray a lack of understanding of the fact that human beings need to be free in both realms to be free in either.\n\nCritics have pointed out that if we have rights only because we need them for our survival and happiness, then we have no right to take actions that are contrary to our survival and happiness, such as blindly following a guru instead of thinking for ourselves, living off others because we prefer the life of a couch potato to fending for ourselves, wasting our property instead of using it wisely, or, most obviously, committing suicide (Mack 1984; Zwolinski 2019). Yet the freedom to do only that which is morally good or rational is no freedom. But there is another interpretation of the claim that \u201cThe right to life means\u2026the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life.\u201d What Rand is pointing out here is that we would not have rights if we did not need them for our survival and happiness (Badhwar 2017, Miller & Mossoff 2019). This need (and the fact that we value our survival and happiness) is the source of rights. If by our very nature we didn\u2019t care whether we lived or died, didn\u2019t care about being forced by the government or other people to act in certain ways and not others, had no use for property, and couldn\u2019t be bothered to think for ourselves, we would have no rights. It doesn\u2019t follow, however, that we don\u2019t have the right to act contrary to the requirements of our survival or happiness. As Rand says elsewhere:\n\nA right is the sanction of independent action. A right is that which can be exercised without anyone\u2019s permission (Rand 2018 83). [A] right is the moral sanction of a positive, of his freedom to act on his own judgment, for his own goals, by his own voluntary, uncoerced choice. (Rand 1963b 93.)\n\nIn spite of several statements that justify such freedom in terms of the individual\u2019s rational judgments (Rand 1965 17), it is the position taken here that is compatible with Rand\u2019s deep-seated commitment to liberty and a minimal government.\n\nAnother criticism of Rand\u2019s theory of rights is that it is incompatible with her ethical egoism, because respect for others\u2019 rights cannot be justified as a means to the ultimate end of one\u2019s survival (Mack 1984; Flew 1984). For under perfectly realistic scenarios, one\u2019s survival can require one to violate another\u2019s right to life or property. Thus, according to these critics, Rand\u2019s defense of rights suffers from the same unresolved tension between the instrumentalist strand and the deontic strand that we find in her justification of morality in general (Mack 1984, 2003). On our eudaimonistic interpretation of Rand\u2019s ethical egoism and theory of rights, there is no incompatibility between the two. Nevertheless, as we\u2019ve argued above, both her ethical egoism and her theory of rights face the criticism that the primary reason for respecting others\u2019 rights, or exercising any of the other-regarding virtues, is not one\u2019s eudaimonia but the fact that others are ends in themselves. What promotes our eudaimonia is recognizing this and living accordingly, but our own eudaimonia is not the primary reason for respecting people\u2019s rights.\n\nEverything said so far shows that Rand believes that individuals have rights even in a state of nature, or a society without a government. Yet in later years, in a workshop on rights, Rand suggests that rights exist only in a society with some kind of authority and a \u201cformulated morality\u201d (2018: 111). It is not clear what Rand means by \u201cformulated morality\u201d: a written, or at least explicitly stated, morality that recognizes rights, like the Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution? Or like Thomas Paine\u2019s Rights of Man?? But aren\u2019t there many societies \u2013 perhaps a majority \u2013 that don\u2019t have a formulated morality yet do recognize at least individuals\u2019 basic rights against each other and the government, and many that can produce paper Constitutions claiming to recognize these rights that, in fact, they deny their citizens? In any case, Rand takes back her controversial statement by reiterating her earlier view that:\n\nThe source of man\u2019s rights is not divine law or congressional law, but the law of identity. A is A and Man is Man. Rights are conditions of existence required by man\u2019s nature for his proper survival (\u201cGalt\u2019s Speech,\u201d Rand 1961a: 182).\n\nWhat we don\u2019t have in the absence of a government, she says, is objectively defined laws that can determine if a right has been violated (2018: 211). A \u201cproper government,\u201d in her words, \u201cis the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control, i.e., under objectively defined laws\u201d (1963a: 128).\n\nOnkar Ghate (2019) and Harry Binswanger (2019) both defend this view. Ghate uses two scenarios involving individuals in a state of nature. Suppose you are by yourself on a desert island, and you domesticate a pig. Then someone from a neighboring tribe steals it. Do you have a right to retaliate by stealing some of his property, or stealing from his relatives? Again, suppose Robinson Crusoe and Friday are strangers sharing an island, and Crusoe invents a superior spear. Does Friday have a right to copy it? Ghate\u2019s main point is that because individuals in his scenarios don\u2019t have a government, they don\u2019t have objectively defined laws, and because they don\u2019t have objectively defined laws, the boundaries of their property rights are unclear. But Ghate does not explain why you, the pig owner, cannot talk to the tribe and come up with a mutually agreeable solution, or why Crusoe and Friday can\u2019t talk things over and decide on the boundaries of their rights vis-a-vis each other (if Crusoe has any common sense, he\u2019ll encourage Friday to copy his spear and propose that they cooperate in their future hunts). Of course the tribe and you might not be able to reach a resolution satisfactory to both of you. But that doesn\u2019t mean that it is in principle impossible to do so. Neither Rand nor Ghate (2019) provide an explanation of why a peaceful society of people without a government cannot come up with objective laws that define the boundaries of their rights \u2013 as, in fact, they do in Rand\u2019s Atlantis: Galt\u2019s Gulch. Their view seems to imply that if the Founding Fathers had been shipwrecked for 5 years on a desert island, they could not have come up with a Bill of Rights that defined the limits of their liberties vis-a-vis each other, or set up a fair system of adjudication in the event of a dispute. But we don\u2019t have to engage in hypotheticals. As many scholars have pointed out, starting in the 11th C, merchants from various countries created the body of law called the Law Merchant in order to protect foreign merchants not protected by the local laws (Benson 1989; see the entry on law merchant at libertarianism.org, linked from Other Internet Resources). The Law Merchant was uniform throughout Europe, and enforced by courts also created by merchants in European cities, without the involvement of any European government.\n\nRand argues that the only just social-political system, the only system compatible with our rational nature and with the right of individuals to live for their own sakes, is capitalism (1965, 1967b), that is,\n\nlaissez-faire capitalism\u2014with a separation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church. (1961b, 1964a)\n\nState regulation of the market, she argues, is responsible for corrupting both state and market institutions, just as political regulation of religion (or religious regulation of politics), wherever it exists, corrupts both state and religious institutions. Regulation creates the opportunity for the trading of favors between politicians and religious leaders, and politicians and businesses. Atlas Shrugged offers a complex and compelling depiction of the economic, political, and moral corruption spawned by \u201ccronyism\u201d between government and business. Laissez-faire capitalism is \u201cthe only [social] system that bans force from social relationships\u201d domestically and abroad, because the trader and the warrior are antagonists (Rand 1966a). Rand\u2019s conception of capitalism is, thus, more radical than the mainstream conception, and her defense of it significantly different both from the utilitarian defenses given by most economists, and the religious defenses given by many conservatives (for discussion, see Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1984b; Machan 1984). She does, of course, praise capitalism (or semi-capitalism) for creating widespread prosperity, but this feature is itself explained only by the fact that it leaves individuals free to produce in peace. In Atlas Shrugged, Rand distinguishes between the few business people who earn their money through honest effort, without seeking favors from the government, and the vast majority who are members of \u201cthe aristocracy of pull\u201d (\u201ccrony capitalists\u201d, in contemporary terminology) and get rich only through such favors, a situation that she thinks prevails, and has always prevailed, in the real world (Rand 1964c). She holds that for a short period in the nineteenth-century America came closer to a laissez-faire system than any other society before or since, but that capitalism remains an unknown ideal. Some critics complain, however, that in her non-fiction (1961c) Rand does not always recognize the aristocrats of pull in the real world\u2014business leaders who lobby politicians for subsidies for themselves and restrictions on their competitors (Rothbard 1968; Johnson 2006).\n\nRand rejects the criticism that unregulated, laissez-faire capitalism would lead to a concentration of power in a few hands and undermine people\u2019s ability to lead their own lives, because laissez-faire capitalism requires the rule of law, a well-defined system of property rights, freedom of contract, and, as a corollary, a government that abstains from all favoritism. In such a society, competition and opportunity will flourish, and prevent concentration of power in a few hands.\n\nRand holds that there is no conflict between one person\u2019s rational interests and another\u2019s, hence that there is no conflict between their rights (1962a, 1964a: 57\u201365). Is it true, however, that rational interests cannot conflict, or that, if they do, it follows that rights must also conflict? Our answer to both questions is \u2018no\u2019. We think that whenever two or more people have a rational interest in one good, there is potential for conflict, and sometimes that potential is actualized. To show otherwise, Rand considers a situation in which two people apply for the same job, and the better candidate gets the job. There is no conflict of interests here, she argues, because the better candidate has earned the job, and the loser cannot rationally wish to have been given the job. Both applicants also know that competition for jobs is a good thing, because the business would close if only one person applied for its jobs (presumably, because that would mean that the business wasn\u2019t doing very well).\n\nBoth points are well-taken. But what if the employer is not rational and gives the job to the somewhat less qualified applicant because, say, he reminds the employer of his long-lost brother? Or, what if the two candidates are equally qualified, and the hiring committee chooses one over the other by tossing a coin? In both cases there is a conflict of interests between two rational applicants. Rand raises the first possibility, that of the irrational employer, but doesn\u2019t trace its implications for her thesis that rational interests don\u2019t conflict. The second possibility, that of two equally qualified candidates, she does not consider at all. Rand would be on firmer ground if she were to argue that there is no necessary conflict between rational interests, that is, that it is not in their nature to conflict. When they conflict, it is due to contingent factors, such as only one job for two equally qualified people. In any case, a conflict between rational interests does not entail a conflict between rights, since, as Rand herself points out, neither party has a right to the job.\n\nRand defines government as:\n\nan institution that holds the exclusive power to enforce certain rules of social conduct in a given geographical area. (1963a: 125)\n\nA proper government is:\n\nthe means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control\u2014i.e., under objectively defined law. (1963b: 128)\n\nSuch a government is minimal, limited to protecting us from criminals and foreign aggressors, and enforcing individual rights and contracts with the help of the police and armed forces, using objectively defined civil and criminal laws and courts. Someone who violates his contracts, or engages in fraud, is guilty of the \u201cindirect\u201d use of force, in that he obtains a value from another without that person\u2019s consent (1963a: 111). Accordingly, the government may use or threaten force only in retaliation against those who initiate or threaten force directly or indirectly. A government that tries to enforce the brother\u2019s keeper principle\u2014\u201cfrom each according to his ability, to each according to his need\u201d; or that drafts citizens into the armed services or \u201cpublic service\u201d; or that forces them, directly or indirectly, to become more virtuous, well-mannered, healthy, or wealthy, violates rights. Statism in all its forms, from unlimited democracy to a mixed economy to dictatorship, is at odds with our status as independent, rational beings, as ends in ourselves. Statism also destroys ability and fails to fulfill anyone\u2019s needs for long, because \u201c[t]o deal with men by force is as impractical as to deal with nature by persuasion\u201d (1973a: 32). The fountainhead of all progress is the human mind, and the mind does not function well when forced.\n\nIn Atlas Shrugged Rand depicts her utopia, Galt\u2019s Gulch, as a \u201cvoluntary association of men held together by nothing but every man\u2019s self-interest\u201d, without any formal organization (1957 [1992]: 690). There is a judge to arbitrate disagreements, but there has never been any need for arbitration. Galt\u2019s Gulch is, thus, an anarchist society, although Rand never calls it that. In \u201cThe Nature of Government\u201d, however, Rand rejects anarchism as irrational and unworkable because, she says, it is incompatible with a single, objective system of law and, thus, with rights and peaceful cooperation (1963a; cf. 2018b). Anarchist critics, such as Roy Childs (1969 [1994]) and Murray Rothbard (1978), have argued that a territorial monopoly on law and force (government) is not necessary, because people can establish a just and effective legal system in a competitive market of security providers (see Long and Machan 2009). The Law Merchant, a body of law established and enforced in private courts by the merchants of various countries, illustrates the possibility of an effective voluntary legal system. Further, a government is incompatible with Rand\u2019s own principle of the non-initiation of force, a principle she regards as the linchpin of a moral society (Long 2013; cf. Cox 2013a and 2013b).\n\nThe trader principle states that a voluntary, mutually beneficial exchange between independent equals is the only basis for a mutually respectful and rational relationship (1961b: 31). It is also the only basis for a peaceful relationship among countries: \u201cthe trader and the warrior have been fundamental antagonists throughout history\u201d (1966a: 38).\n\nThe trader principle applies to emotional relationships as well. To love or admire someone is to \u201cpay\u201d him for the pleasure one derives from his virtues (1961b: 31)\u2014or, Rand might say in the case of love for a small child, from his personality. It would seem, however, that the trade between parent and child is unequal, given that the child receives both pleasure and material support from the parent. And it is unclear how the trader principle applies at all when a severe disability renders a beloved child or spouse a source of pain rather than pleasure.\n\n3.2 Feminism\n\nIf feminism is the view that women are, and ought to be recognized as, men\u2019s intellectual, moral, sexual, and political equals, then the Objectivist philosophy of human nature is inherently feminist, since it applies equally to all human beings, regardless of gender (or race) (N. Branden 1999). Decades before it was considered acceptable for women to lack \u201cmaternal instincts\u201d or pursue careers, Rand created heroines who lack the first and pursue the second, free of guilt or self-doubt.[11] Kira (We the Living) wants to be an engineer, and Dagny (Atlas Shrugged) runs Taggart Transcontinental, the largest and most successful transcontinental railroad in the country. None of Rand\u2019s heroines sacrifices her interests, intellect, or principles for the man or men in her life. One literary critic argues that Dagny is the first, and perhaps only, epic heroine in Western literature because of the grandness of her vision, her courage and integrity, her unusual abilities, and her national importance (Michalson 1999). Rand\u2019s depiction of her heroines\u2019 enjoyment of sex and their freedom from all merely conventional norms about sex anticipates the sexual liberation movement of the 20th century by at least 30 years. In all three novels, it is the heroine who has the power to choose which of the men who love, admire, and desire her (and only her) she will have. Rand was also an ardent champion of a woman\u2019s right to control her own reproductive choices (1968a, 1981).\n\nHer relationship to the feminist movement, however, was more complex. Although she praised Betty Friedan\u2019s The Feminine Mystique, mainstream feminism\u2019s collectivism and emphasis on women as victims later led her to reject feminism as such. Many theorists argue that Rand\u2019s work, especially Atlas Shrugged, upholds important feminist ideals, even as it succumbs to some anti-feminist tendencies that contradict her individualistic ethics (e.g., Gladstein 1978, 1999; B. Branden 1999; Presley 1999; Sheaffer 1999; Taylor 1999). Many others regard her and her work as plainly anti-feminist, with Susan Brownmiller even calling her \u201ca traitor to her own sex\u201d (Brownmiller 1975). One criticism takes aim at the individualism of Rand\u2019s ethics and politics, which rejects any special government help for women or discrimination against men (e.g., Harrison 1978). Another objects that Rand has internalized a masculine conception of human nature and virtue, and then created her ideal woman in light of this conception (Brownmiller 1975; Glennon 1979). This may be responsible for Rand\u2019s puzzling (and offensive) view that the essence of femininity is to hero-worship (not men, but) masculinity, while insisting (as her novels depict) that women and men are inherently equal and that the ideal romantic relationship is between moral and intellectual equals (1968b; cf. Brown 1999). At least as offensive to many are the violent sex scenes in her novels, especially the infamous scene in The Fountainhead that many regard as rape, where Howard Roark has sex with Dominique in spite of her resistance.\n\nThose who reject the charge of rape argue that in the 1940s and 50s, when Rand wrote her novels, it would have been seen as rough sex rather than non-consensual sex (McElroy 1999; Sheaffer 1999). That Rand herself thought of this scene as consensual is shown a few pages later, when she writes: \u201cThey had been united in an understanding beyond the violence, beyond the deliberate obscenity of his action\u201d (1943: 218). And in letters to disturbed readers in 1946 and 1965, Rand denied that the scene is \u201cactual rape\u201d which, she stated, is \u201ca dreadful crime\u201d, a \u201cvicious action and a violation of a woman\u2019s rights\u201d (Rand 1995a). On the other hand, she also depicts Dominique exultantly telling herself that she\u2019s been raped. McElroy wonders if having her heroine call it rape is just another instance of Rand\u2019s desire to provoke and shock the reader (McElroy 1999), as when she uses \u201cselfishness\u201d to mean \u201crational self-interest\u201d.\n\n4. Aesthetics\n\nRand holds that our actions need guidance by a vision of the fundamental nature of the universe and of the efficacy of human thought and activity\u2014a vision that can be grasped directly rather than requiring the conscious repetition of long chains of abstract reasoning. The chief function of art is to meet this psychological need by expressing abstract conceptual values and metaphysical truths in concrete perceptible form. Art, according to Rand, constitutes a selective, stylized re-creation of reality, with the principle of selection being the artist\u2019s \u201csense of life\u201d, a set of implicit \u201cmetaphysical value-judgments\u201d, i.e., judgments about what is fundamentally significant about the world and our place in it. (There is controversy among Rand scholars as to whether what is re-created in art is certain elements of reality or reality as a whole, i.e., a \u201cmicrocosm\u201d, as well as how and whether the concept of re-creation applies to apparently non-representational forms of art: Torres and Kamhi 2000; Bissell 2004.) Both the artist\u2019s creative work and the audience\u2019s emotional responses to it are driven by their senses of life, that is, the worldviews they have \u201cformed by a process of emotional generalization \u2026 a subconscious counterpart of a process of abstraction\u201d (1966b: 27). The role of art in sustaining us psychologically by providing a concretization of our most fundamental values is a frequent theme in Rand\u2019s fiction as well, especially The Fountainhead.[12]\n\nWhile art can be used to convey information or to advocate a position, such functions are secondary to its chief task: providing an object whose mere contemplation brings spiritual fulfillment. Hence Rand does not regard her own novels primarily as vehicles for her philosophy, though of course they are that inter alia. Given her own worldview, Rand favors literature with a strong plot as a way of expressing purposeful human action in a world of causal regularity, and stories involving value-conflicts as a way of expressing the importance of free choice; hence her preference for romantic (as opposed to, e.g., naturalistic) literature. But Rand holds that it is possible to evaluate an artwork\u2019s aesthetic value simply in terms of its success in conveying a concretization of the artist\u2019s sense of life, whether or not one shares the values and judgments so conveyed."}, {"url": "https://aynrandcentereurope.org/ayn-rand/about-ayn-rand/", "page_content": "About Ayn Rand\n\nAyn Rand, born as Alisa Zinov\u2019yevna Rosenbaum (Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0430 \u0417\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0431\u0430\u0443\u043c) was a Russian-American philosopher, romanticist, dramatist and screen-writer.

Her father Fronz had owned a chemist shop, while her mother Anna was Alisa\u2019s opposite, an active socialite. \u201cShe was by principle and basic style\u2026 extremely social\u2026 she was much more interested in the social aspect.\u201d Ayn Rand thought such activities to be of little value.\n\nAlisa was a curious child and a fond reader of a French serial about a heroic detective who was in pursuit of a jewel thief. To Alisa, this was a story of a battle between good and evil. This was to be the perspective from which she viewed the world. In her writing, she later transformed the battle between good and evil into a struggle of opposing ideas on a global scale: the good versus evil motif remained.\n\nIn the summer of 1914, at the age of 9, Alisa met her hero \u2013 a man leaning against a wall with a sword in his hand \u2013 a hero known as Cyrus. She had lost all ties to everyday reality while reading about the adventures of Cyrus in a boys\u2019 magazine, a story titled: \u201cThe Mysterious Valley\u201d. Ayn Rand characterized her future fictional heroes with many of Cyrus\u2019s qualities.\n\nPortrait of Cyrus in \u201cThe Mysterious Valley\u201d\n\nAlisa attended high school in a Soviet society where life\u2019s prospects were increasingly bleak. But her studies included an introduction to the United States of America, the world\u2019s foremost society of individualism.\n\nIn college, Alisa majored in history to gain knowledge for her future writing and philosophy, and to help her shape her value system. But as Communists took over the University of Petrograd, her outspoken hostility to their ideas left her in fear for herself and her family.\n\nAfter graduation, she enrolled in a film school and thought about becoming a Soviet screenwriter, incorporating into her scripts her individualistic ideas. She even went so far as to present a fellow film student, a loyal Communist, with a writing sample along those lines. But the student could tell there was something odd about the story and its theme, and Alisa soon concluded that she had no future in Soviet cinema.\n\nAyn Rand\u2019s passport photograph, 1925\n\nAround the time Communism gained full power in Russia, Alisa received a letter from her relatives in Chicago to visit them. During fall of 1925, Alisa got her passport and approval to travel to America for a period of 6 months. On February 10, 1926 she boarded the ship De Grasse in Paris and arrived in New York with only $50.00 in her pocket. She soon joined her relatives in Chicago and decided to leave her past life behind. She saw a lot of movies and wrote, using her typewriter. During her six months in Chicago, she settled on a new name for herself: Ayn Rand. She got Ayn from a Finnish writer and Rand from her Remington-Rand typewriter. She never told her parents that she changed her name; she didn\u2019t want her family to be at risk due to her anti-Communist stance.\n\nShe had a dream of one day becoming a writer, and now she decided to become a screen writer, so she moved to Los Angeles and looked for a job in Hollywood. Through her Chicago relatives, she got a contact in the film industry to write a letter of introduction for someone in the publicity department of Cecil B. DeMille Studio. She had only $100.00.\n\nShe started to work as an extra. At one point, she gathered her courage to present her scripts to DeMille, who forwarded them to the script department. Her scripts were rejected due to lack of \u201chuman\u201d emotions (flaws, failings, and fears), with the remark that the characters were too romanticized and that they should be portrayed as people \u201creally are\u201d, with unresolvable problems. Such criticism did not prevent her from being decisive in presenting her heroes in future novels.\n\n\u201cCleanup Week\u201d, Cecil B. DeMille Studio \u2013 Hollywood, 1927\n\nOne morning, on her way to work, Rand fell in love with a tall, handsome, blue-eyed actor named Frank O\u2019Connor. He had a smaller role in the same movie that she was working on. She later found out from his brothers that he told them that he had met an interesting Russian girl \u2013 and that he could not understand a word she said. However, his days on the set were limited and, afterward, she could not find him anywhere. Eventually, she met Frank once again, this time at a library, in the summer of 1927 and they fell in love. They got married on April 15, 1929 and they were married for more than 50 years, until Frank\u2019s passing.\n\nAyn Rand with Frank O\u2019Connor\n\nAs a fighter for individual rights, she taught her philosophy to young minds from the USA and the rest of the world through books. Rand spent four years writing her first novel, \u201cWe the Living\u201d, about the struggle to find liberty in Soviet Russia. Rand finished the book in late 1933. After many rejections, Macmillan agreed to publish it. The company published 3,000 copies in March 1936, but the book went unnoticed for a year. Then it caught the readers\u2019 attention and they began discussing her novel, whose central theme is Man against the State.\n\nHer thoughts about the novel were: \u201cIdeologically, I had said exactly what I wanted, and I had had no difficulty in expressing my ideas. I had wanted to write a novel about Man against the State. I had wanted to show, as the basic theme, the sanctity \u2013 the supreme value \u2013 of human life, and the immorality of treating men as sacrificial animals and ruling them by physical force. I did so.\u201d\n\nAyn Rand in Chatsworth, California, 1947\n\nHer dream of living in New York came true when she moved there with Frank, as her play \u201cPenthouse Legend\u201d had its premiere on Broadway in 1934, under the title \u201cNight of January 16th\u201d. The play previously had its premiere in Hollywood under the title \u201cWoman on Trial\u201d.\n\nWith her success as a screenwriter, she wanted to keep her promise and get her family to leave Russia and come to the United States. However, they couldn\u2019t get their visas approved, and as war began in 1939, she had lost all contact with her family. Years later, she found out that her parents died during the siege of Leningrad.\n\nAyn Rand in front of the Grand Central, midtown Manhattan, 1957\n\nWhen she turned 30, she felt ready to fully explain her philosophy and her vision of an ideal man; she began writing her novel, \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d, with a concept of individualism against collectivism \u2013 not in politics, but instead in the human spirit.\n\nShe once wrote: \u201cIf all philosophers were required to present their ideas in novels, to dramatize the exact meaning and consequences of their philosophies in human life, there would be far fewer philosophers \u2013 and far better ones.\u201d For her main protagonist, she chose Howard Roark, an architect. She described Roark as being \u201cin conflict with the world in every possible way \u2013 and at complete peace with himself.\u201d In order to portray her thoughts in the best possible way and to do New York\u2019s skyscrapers justice, she began her research on architecture, and even volunteered as an assistant in one architecture firm, where she worked for 6 months.\n\nOriginal Cover of \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d, 1943\n\nIn 1937, while struggling to work out the plot of \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d, Rand wrote a short, lyrical futurist story about an individual versus collectivist tyranny \u2013 Anthem. She came up with that storyline while she was living in Russia, and the story was set in a dystopian future, where she emphasized the lack of technology and the oppressive rulers who re-wrote the past to delete all mention of the freedom, prosperity, and advanced technology of the earlier capitalist era. This book offered a bold affirmation of egoism \u2013 in Anthem, a man rediscovers the word \u201cI\u201d.\n\nRand finished \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d on December 31st 1942, and it was published in May 1943. From conception to publication, it had taken her about nine years. By 1948, it sold roughly 400,000 copies. Then came the New American Library paperback edition, and \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d went on to sell over 6 million copies.\n\nWarner Brothers Studio bought the rights from Ayn Rand for a movie adaptation of \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d. She was paid $50,000.00 USD and got to write the script, while Gary Cooper, who Rand saw in the role from the start, got to play Howard Roark. The movie had its premiere in 1949.\n\nOn the set of \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d with Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal, 1948\n\nMeanwhile, Rand wrote her next book, \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d, which she worked on for 14 years. The central idea was what would happen if all creative minds went on a strike. Frank urged her to use one of the chapter headings as the book title, and so the title became \u201cAtlas Shrugged. The book was published on October 10, 1957. With \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d, Rand had fulfilled her dreams. Sales began to climb, eventually surpassing 4.5 million copies. Today, more than 30 million copies of her novels have been sold worldwide.\n\nOn the theme of \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d, Ayn Rand said: \u201cThe collectivists and the champions of the \u2018common man\u2019 have screamed for so long about strikes, about the dependence of the industrialist upon his workers, about the workers supporting him, creating his wealth, making his livelihood possible, and what would happen to him if they walked out. Very well. I will now show who depends on whom, who supports whom, who creates what, who makes whose livelihood possible, and what happens to whom when who walks out.\u201d\n\nPublicity photograph for \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d, Random House, 1957\n\nWhile working on \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d, Ayn agreed to meet up with her two admirers, Nathaniel Branden and Barbara Weidman, both students of UCLA at the time. They met in 1950, and soon became Ayn\u2019s closest friends and companions. In 1953, Nathaniel and Barbara got married, with Ayn and Frank their maid of honor and best man. Shortly after, Ayn agreed on having close gatherings with them and other friends and students, a group she called The class of \u201943, internally known as The Collective. They discussed the chapters of the yet to be published \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d.\n\nThe Collective at a wedding, 1955\n\nMeanwhile, Rand turned to non-fiction writing and to speaking in front of packed auditoriums. She edited and published \u201cThe Objectivist Newsletter\u201d (1962-1966), \u201cThe Objectivist\u201d (1966-1971) and \u201cThe Ayn Rand Letter\u201d (1971-1976). With a flair for controversy, she titled one essay collection \u201cThe Virtue of Selfishness\u201d (1964). In 1960, Ayn agreed to give her first public lecture at Yale University. It was an enormous success, and she was invited to give lectures at many prestigious American universities.\n\nAyn Rand always had the inspiration to write, however she never wrote fiction again. In 1961, she published a book called \u201cFor the New Intellectual\u201d which contains all the key philosophic chapters of her novels, as well as a new essay which analyzes the development of Western culture. She began to write articles for \u201cThe Objectivist Newsletter\u201d, a bulletin which turned into a monthly magazine in 1966.\n\nIn 1973, Rand came in contact with her youngest sister Nora, who, in Leningrad, read about her in an article. Ayn arranged for her sister and her husband to come to New York. At that point, she found out about the death of her parents during the siege of Leningrad. The sisters soon came into conflict when they realized that they had differing world views. Her sister and her husband felt uncomfortable while living in New York, which was so different from life in the Soviet Union. After 6 weeks, they decided to go back to Leningrad.\n\nIn 1974, after postponing a visit to a doctor, Ayn took her friends\u2019 advice and finally went for a medical analysis; she had been feeling unwell for a long time. She was diagnosed with lung cancer and underwent successful surgery. She had been an avid smoker her whole life, but she never smoked again.\n\nValhalla Cemetery, New York, 1982\n\nShe kept more to herself after Frank O\u2019Connor\u2019s death in November 1979; at times, she seemed oblivious to the inspiration her books and ideas provided to millions of people.\n\nRand\u2019s heart began to give out in December 1981. She hung on for three more months, asking her closest associate, Leonard Peikoff, to complete several projects. She died in her Manhattan apartment on March 6, 1982. She was buried next to Frank O\u2019Connor in Valhalla, New York. She was 77.\n\nShe commented on all the hardships throughout her life: \u201cIt\u2019s a benevolent universe, and I love it, and any struggle was worth it. Struggle or unhappiness are so enormously unimportant. I don\u2019t regret a minute of my life.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/ayn-rand", "page_content": "(1905-1982)\n\nWho Was Ayn Rand?\n\nAyn Rand moved to the United States in 1926 and tried to establish herself in Hollywood. Her first novel, We the Living (1936), championed her rejection of collectivist values in favor of individual self interest, a belief that became more explicit with her subsequent novels The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged (1957). Following the immense success of the latter, Rand promoted her philosophy of Objectivism through courses, lectures and literature.\n\nEarly Years\n\nAyn Rand was born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum on February 2, 1905, in St. Petersburg, Russia. The oldest daughter of Jewish parents (and eventually an avowed atheist), she spent her early years in comfort thanks to her dad's success as a pharmacist, proving a brilliant student.\n\nIn 1917, her father's shop was suddenly seized by Bolshevik soldiers, forcing the family to resume life in poverty in the Crimea. The situation profoundly impacted young Alissa, who developed strong feelings toward government intrusion into individual livelihood. She returned to her city of birth to attend the University of Petrograd, graduating in 1924, and then enrolled at the State Institute for Cinema Arts to study screenwriting.\n\nGranted a visa to visit relatives in Chicago, Alissa left for the United States in early 1926, never to look back. She took on her soon-to-be-famous pen name and, after a few months in Chicago, moved to Hollywood to become a screenwriter.\n\nEarly Writing Career\n\nFollowing a chance encounter with Hollywood titan Cecil B. DeMille, Rand became an extra on the set of his 1927 film The King of Kings, where she met actor Frank O'Connor. They married in 1929, and she became an American citizen in 1931.\n\nRand landed a job as a clerk at RKO Pictures, eventually rising to head of the wardrobe department, and continued developing her craft as a writer. In 1932, she sold her screenplay Red Pawn, a Soviet romantic thriller, to Universal Studios. She soon completed a courtroom drama called Penthouse Legend, which featured the gimmick of audience members serving as the jury. In late 1934, Rand and her husband moved to New York City for its production, now renamed Night of January 16th.\n\nAround this time, Rand also completed her first novel, We the Living. Published in 1936 after several rejections, We the Living championed the moral authority of the individual through its heroine's battles with a Soviet totalitarian state. Rand followed with the novella Anthem (1938), about a future collectivist dystopia in which \"I\" has been stamped out of the language.\n\n'The Fountainhead' and 'Atlas Shrugged'\n\nIn 1937, Rand began researching a new novel by working for New York architect Ely Jacques Kahn. The result, after years of writing and more rejections, was The Fountainhead. Underscoring Rand\u2019s individualistic underpinnings, the book\u2019s hero, architect Howard Roark, refuses to adhere to conventions, going so far as to blowing up one of his own creations. While not an immediate success, The Fountainhead eventually achieved strong sales, and at the end of the decade became a feature film, with Gary Cooper in the role of Roark.\n\nRand's ideas became even more explicit with the 1957 publication of Atlas Shrugged. A massive work of more than 1,000 pages, Atlas Shrugged portrays a future in which leading industrialists drop out of a collectivist society that exploits their talents, culminating with a notoriously lengthy speech by protagonist John Galt. The novel drew some harsh reviews, but became an immediate best seller.\n\nObjectivism and Later Years\n\nAround 1950, Rand met with a college student named Nathan Blumenthal, who changed his name to Nathaniel Branden and became the author's designated heir. Along with his wife, Barbara, Braden formed a group that met at Rand's apartment to engage in intellectual discussions. The group, which included future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, called itself the Collective, or the Class of '43 (the publication year of The Fountainhead).\n\nRand soon honed her philosophy of what she termed \"Objectivism\": a belief in a concrete reality, from which individuals can discern existing truths, and the ultimate moral value of the pursuit of self interest. The development of this system essentially ended her career as a novelist: In 1958, the Nathaniel Branden Institute formed to spread her message through lectures, courses and literature, and in 1962, the author and her top disciple launched The Objectivist Newsletter. Her books during this period, including For the New Intellectual (1961) and Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal (1966), were primarily comprised of previously published essays and other works.\n\nFollowing a public split with Braden, the author published The Romantic Manifesto (1969), a series of essays on the cultural importance of art, and repackaged her newsletter as The Ayn Rand Letter. She continued traveling to give lectures, though she was slowed by an operation for lung cancer. In 1979, she published a collection of articles in Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, which included an essay from prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Leonard Peikoff.\n\nDeath and Legacy\n\nRand was working on a television adaptation of Atlas Shrugged when she died of heart failure at her home in New York City on March 6, 1982.\n\nAlthough she weathered criticism for her perceived literary shortcomings and philosophical arguments, Rand undeniably left her mark on the Western culture she embraced. In 1985, Peikoff founded the Ayn Rand Institute to continue her teachings. The following year, Braden's ex-wife, Barbara, published a tell-all memoir, The Passion of Ayn Rand, which later was made into a movie starring Helen Mirren.\n\nInterest in Rand's works resurfaced alongside the rise of the Tea Party movement during President Barack Obama's administration, with leading political proponents like Rand Paul and Ted Cruz proclaiming their admiration for the author. In 2010, the Ayn Rand Institute announced that more than 500,000 copies of Atlas Shrugged had been sold the previous year.\n\nIn 2017, Tony-winning director Ivo van Hove reintroduced The Fountainhead to the American public with a production at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Having originated at Toneelgroep Amsterdam in the Netherlands, van Hove's version featured his performers speaking in Dutch, with their words projected onto a screen in English.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nBirth Year: 1905\n\nBirth date: February 2, 1905\n\nBirth City: St. Petersburg\n\nBirth Country: Russia\n\nGender: Female\n\nBest Known For: Author Ayn Rand wrote the best-selling books 'The Fountainhead' and 'Atlas Shrugged,' and promoted the philosophy of Objectivism.\n\nIndustries\n\nWriting and Publishing\n\n\n\nFilm\n\nAstrological Sign: Aquarius\n\nSchools\n\nUniversity of Petrograd\n\n\n\nState Institute For Cinema Arts\n\nDeath Year: 1982\n\nDeath date: March 6, 1982\n\nDeath State: New York\n\nDeath City: New York\n\nDeath Country: United States\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: Ayn Rand Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/ayn-rand\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E; Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: November 16, 2021\n\nOriginal Published Date: April 2, 2014\n\nQUOTES"}, {"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand", "page_content": "Alice O'Connor (born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0430 \u0417\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0431\u0430\u0443\u043c, [a\u02c8l\u02b2\u026asa z\u02b2\u026a\u02c8nov\u02b2\u026avn\u0259 r\u0259z\u02b2\u026an\u02c8ba\u028am].[1].February 2 [O.S. January 20] , 1905 \u2013 March 6, 1982), better known by her pen name Ayn Rand ( ), was a Russian-born American writer, screenwriter, playwright and philosopher.[3]\n\nShe published several popular books in the United States during the mid-1900s, including her two best-selling novels, Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead, plus We the Living and Anthem. Her novels promoted a viewpoint of laissez-faire capitalism as a political and social goal. It is a kind of political philosophy known in the U.S.A. as libertarian conservatism. She called this philosophy 'objectivism'.\n\nHer husband was American actor and artist Frank O'Connor.\n\nRand was born in St. Petersburg, Russia and grew up during the Russian Revolution, in the years after World War I. She left Russia to visit relatives in Chicago in the United States when she was 21 years old. She did not want to return to live under Communism, and stayed in the US. She changed her name, partly to protect her family in Russia. Rand moved to California to become a movie writer.\n\nMovies at the time did not have sound, and stories were mimed on camera. Dialogue was not important, so Rand could write simple stories while she improved her English language skills.\n\nRand met Frank O'Connor on a movie set, when they both appeared as extras. When O'Connor married Rand in 1929, she could live permanently in America. She later became an American citizen. O'Connor gave up his acting career, to work full-time so Rand could write full-time. Later he retired, when Rand's work made a good income. He began painting late in his life. He died in 1979.\n\nRand was a longtime tobacco smoker. She had lung cancer, but she recovered from the disease after surgery. She died of cardiovascular disease in New York City on March 6, 1982.\n\nRand's first book was We the Living. It is about life in Russia during and after the Russian Revolution, and how life in the later Soviet Union destroys the dreams and hopes of its main characters, who are mostly young people.\n\nHer second book was Anthem, which is a science fiction novella, a dystopian story about a man named Equality 7-2521 who lives in a future society. In that place, everybody is given their name by the government, and nobody can use the words \"I\" or \"me\". He escapes from this society with a partner, to live freely in a house in a hidden place.\n\nHer stage play Woman on Trial (better known as Night of January 16th) used audience members as a jury, to decide the play's outcome (by voting the lead character guilty or not guilty) each time it was performed. Some celebrities, such as Helen Keller, appeared as jury members.\n\nHer third novel was The Fountainhead. It is about an architect, who wants to have control over his building designs, and does not like when he has to compromise his building designs. The Fountainhead became a best-seller, and was made into a movie starring Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal.\n\nHer fourth novel was Atlas Shrugged. It is her longest book. It was also a best-seller. It tells a story about a worldwide economic crisis. This is caused by the best minds in business, industry, and science, and after a while all thinking people, quitting their jobs and disappearing. This is a protest against government regulations that get in the way of their work or make it harder to do.\n\nThe more that governments get in the way, the worse conditions become, until society collapses. A new future begins when the people who disappeared return, and governments adopt laissez-faire principles, that do not try to control how businesses work, or misuse innovations.\n\nAfter writing Atlas Shrugged, she wrote non-fiction books about her Objectivist ideas. She published The Objectivist Newsletter, which then became The Objectivist magazine, with contributions by other writers. She also published The Ayn Rand Letter, a later newsletter about her ideas. Rand's views are typical libertarian\u2013conservative views. Freedom of the individual, the evils of 'large' government, the economic benefits of low taxes and 'small' government, the 'open' society: these are values which run through all her work.\n\nRand invented a philosophy that she called \"Objectivism\". She was against communism, socialism, and collectivism, which are political systems where a community or the government of a country takes charge of distribution of that country's goods and products.\n\nShe opposed altruism, which she viewed as a form of self-sacrifice. She favored a form of rational selfishness.\n\nShe also thought that countries should have very small governments. Rand did not think that welfare payments to poor people were a good thing, because this involves using force to take money away from others. She believed that charity (giving money away) could be a good thing if the person giving the money wanted and chose to do it, but she did not think that people should be expected or forced to give away their money.\n\nShe was against religion, and was an atheist.\n\nSelected bibliography [ change | change source ]\n\n\u2191 Alisa or Alissa Most sources transliterate her given name as eitheror \u2191 The Passion of Ayn Rand.

Everyone from Donald Trump, to Alan Greenspan, to Brad Pitt have sung Ayn Rand's praises. The Library of Congress named her novel Atlas Shrugged the second most influential book in the U.S. after the Bible. Ayn Rand wasn't politically correct, she was belligerent and liked going against the grain. And although she lived by the doctrine of her own greatness, she was driven by the fear that she would never be good enough.\n\nIn this episode, historian Jennifer Burns will guide us through Rand's evolution and how she eventually reshaped American politics, becoming what Burns calls \"a gateway drug to life on the right.\"\n\nIf you want to read more:\n\nGoddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right, by Jennifer Burns\n\nAtlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand"}, {"url": "https://thecultureofreasoncenter.com/articles/who-was-ayn-rand/", "page_content": "Ayn Rand (1905- 1982) was a Russian-American novelist, philosopher, playwright and screenwriter. She is highly known for her best-selling fiction novels: The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged as well as for defining and developing a revolutionary philosophical system called Objectivism. Rand was born and educated in Russia, then emigrated to the United States in 1926. She first achieved fame with the publication of The Fountainhead in 1943 and her magnum opus Atlas Shrugged was published in 1957.\n\nRand's political views are clearly pronounced in her fiction novels, especially in Atlas Shrugged where she emphasized the necessity of respecting individual rights such as life, liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness. Rand advocated both political and social freedom; and, therefore, advocated total separation of economics and state in the form of laissez-faire capitalism enforced via a constitutionally limited government.\n\nAyn Rand was a fierce opponent of all forms of political slavery: collectivism, fascism, communism and socialism, or even a mixed-economy. Her ethical theory promoted rational self-interest as opposed to the sacrifice of others or of oneself. Rand was committed to reason as an absolute means of acquiring knowledge and as the most important aspect of her philosophy stating: \"I am not primarily an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am not primarily an advocate of egoism, but of reason.

His fundamental sympathy with Rand\u2019s thought is obvious; and clearly, Sciabarra wants to convey its complexity and power to an academic audience that has often dismissed Rand\u2019s rational egoism and libertarianism as polemical and shallow.\n\nSciabarra wants to approach Objectivism \u201cas an evolved response to the dualities Rand confronted in Soviet Russia. Although she rejected both the mysticism of Russia\u2019s religious traditions and the secular collectivism of the Russian Marxists, she nonetheless remained a profoundly Russian thinker.\u201d The author argues, \u201cRand\u2019s Russian nature was not reflected merely in her heavy foreign accent or in the length of her novels. She was Russian in more fundamental ways. In the sweeping character of her generalizations, and in her passionate commitment to the practical realization of her ideals, Rand was fully within the Russian literary and philosophic tradition.\u201d The historical inquiry and speculation about Rand\u2019s Russian roots is core to Sciabarra\u2019s project. As political scientist and intellectual historian, his goal in the book is not to evaluate the validity of Rand\u2019s radical ideas (although his analysis is frequently suggestive on that score) but to interpret them in their historical context.\n\nAfter examining the historical background in Russia, Sciabarra goes on to consider how Rand\u2019s dialectical rejection of dualism, as a \u201cby-product\u201d of her Russian heritage, saturated every aspect of her thought. From this angle he dissects the systemic relations of being and knowing, ethics, art, politics, sex, and \u201chistory and resolution,\u201d critically illuminating not only Rand\u2019s own thought but also its development and amendment in the hands of her followers, orthodox and non-orthodox alike. At every step, Sciabarra\u2019s scrupulous scholarship, dispassionate tone and dialectically dynamic argument are calculated to render Rand as palatable as possible to serious academic consideration. But the book is not aimed only at academics. It also invites those who already appreciate Rand to consider her thought anew.\n\nRand has repeatedly been read as a kind of \u201cvulgar\u201d Nietzschean egoist herself. But true to her non-dualism, Rand\u2019s mature theory in fact transcends the false alternative of sacrificing one\u2019s self to others or sacrificing others to one\u2019s self. She rejects not only the masochism of conventional altruism but the sadism of conventional, other-trampling \u201cegoism.\u201d To pursue one\u2019s long-range interests rationally, one functions as neither master nor slave. Rand vividly illustrates these themes in her novel The Fountainhead, in which the Nietzschean kinds of egoist are contrasted with the more independent-minded, self-sufficient Howard Roark. Roark succeeds by earning the trust and rational agreement of others, and by trading values with them, not by getting anyone\u2019s self-sacrificial submission (despite dramatic opportunities to do so).\n\nSciabarra\u2019s insight into the import of Rand\u2019s integrative, contextualist dialectic is part of what makes his book distinctive and challenging. His methodology will be controversial, and here I cannot begin to suggest its playing out in the skein of the \u201chermeneutic.\u201d I take his understanding of Randian dialectic to be somewhat problematic as enunciated, less so as applied in Sciabarra\u2019s actual interpretation of Rand. There is room for much more controversy, too: for example, in Sciabarra\u2019s comparison of Rand to other thinkers, including provocative wondering about, say, whether Rand may have picked up her emphasis on productive work from Karl Marx. In terms of sheer new information, the material on Rand\u2019s education is invaluable, but of a necessarily speculative character.\n\nSciabarra also rehabilitates Rand\u2019s advocacy of limited government and repudiation of anarchism as an expression of her non-dualistic, dialectical approach (and, yes, it turns out that anarchism really is \u201ccontext-dropping\u201d). He reconstructs Rand\u2019s analysis of power relations on the interlocking personal, cultural, and \u201cstructural\u201d levels, and notes that her capitalist ideal is set forth as \u201cthe only social system that makes possible a triumph over social fragmentation.\u201d\n\nThe Aristotelian philosopher Henry Veatch has asked whether Objectivism will ever be academically respectable. That formerly open question must now be answered with an unequivocal \u201cYes,\u201d inasmuch as Chris Matthew Sciabarra\u2019s profound and subtle study has made it inevitable. But more important, Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical is a fundamental challenge to everyone to reassess the remarkable thought of a remarkable woman."}, {"url": "https://newideal.aynrand.org/ayn-rand-voice-of-america/", "page_content": "In January 1926, twenty-one-year-old Ayn Rand fled the Soviet Union with dreams of becoming a fiction writer. More than four decades later, having reached America and achieved her ambition, she was invited to address the Russian people in her native language through the Voice of America radio service, whose signals reached deep inside the dictatorship\u2019s borders. This is the story of that remarkable 1968 interview.\n\nVoice of America\u2019s reach\n\nThe U.S. government started Voice of America as German-language counterpropaganda against the Nazis in 1942, but by the end of World War II it had expanded to forty languages broadcasting across the globe. In 1947, as tensions rose between the U.S. and the Soviets, Voice of America began its Russian-language service. \u201cThe Voice,\u201d as it was commonly called, addressed two hundred million people ruled by a Communist dictatorship.\n\nIn the tightly controlled world of the Soviet Union, all Western media was censored, with \u201cpenalties that ranged from administrative fines to jail sentences.\u201d Because owning a shortwave radio could arouse suspicion, some Russians buried their radios, digging them out again as needed. Millions of Russians accepted these risks for a chance to hear the Voice of America Jazz Hour. But VOA also presented four daily programs for fourteen hours a day, including news and commentary on international events, while offering a window into American culture and ideas. VOA was dedicated to telling \u201cthe truth about the United States and its people.\u201d Embed from Getty Images\n\nRegarding alternative sources of information as \u201cno less dangerous than bombs and machine-guns,\u201d the Soviets began jamming Voice of America\u2019s signal in 1949. By the early 1960s, fourteen hundred jamming stations had been established across the Eastern bloc. Yet on the outskirts of cities or in the evenings, when jammers were weakest, \u201cthose who wanted to listen to alternative information would sit by their radio receivers, trying to find the frequencies on which they could hear something.\u201d\n\nInterviewing Ayn Rand\n\nAs a direct counter to the Soviet narrative that Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s faced a wretched existence in Western countries, many VOA broadcasts featured interviews with refugees who had escaped abroad. Ayn Rand was a perfect candidate for such an interview. Born in St. Petersburg in 1905, Rand had spent the first twenty-one years of her life in Russia, experiencing firsthand the horrors of the Soviet regime. She escaped in 1926, eventually establishing herself as a best-selling author, philosopher, and public intellectual.\n\nOn February 20, 1968, a VOA representative telephoned Rand\u2019s office to propose a Russian-language interview. He told Rand\u2019s assistant that it would be \u201can interview and not a debate\u201d and that it would focus on her ideas, especially as they related to Russia. Rand immediately accepted and started preparations. The prospect of a Russian-language interview presented a challenge, as the precise conceptual vocabulary of her Objectivist philosophy would need to be translated into a language she had barely used for decades. She generated several pages of notes, writing out English words like \u201creason,\u201d \u201csacrifice,\u201d and \u201creality,\u201d along with their closest Russian equivalents. She also wrote out entire sentences in Russian that expressed her philosophy in condensed form.\n\nOn March 4, 1968, Rand arrived for her interview at the Voice of America studio on 250 West 57th Street, just two blocks west of Carnegie Hall. Interviewer Ludmila Obolensky began by asking for a summary of Objectivism, a question that Rand had prepared for. \u201cIt\u2019s a new moral philosophy,\u201d said Rand, \u201can ethics of rational egoism. We say that the human mind \u2014 human reason \u2014 is the main means of human existence.\u201d In a few short sentences, Rand captured the essence of her philosophy: the primacy of reason, a morality of self-interest, and capitalism as the only moral political system. It is likely the first time that a Russian audience would have heard about Objectivism.\n\nThis provoked a question from Obolensky, who asked if individual freedom should be restricted in order to prevent people from stomping on the rights of others. Rand was careful to distinguish herself from anarchists, by noting the necessity of a limited government designed to protect individual rights.\n\nThe interview then turned to Rand\u2019s books, with a summary of Atlas Shrugged and its theme: the role of reason in man\u2019s existence. Rand also mentioned her first novel, We the Living, providing an opportunity to mention a crucial piece of her own backstory: her life in the aftermath of the Bolshevik revolution. At the time of the interview, Rand\u2019s books had been translated into nine languages \u2014 but not Russian. She expressed hope that her books would someday be published in Russian, \u201cwithout censorship.\u201d\n\nWhen the fourteen-minute interview was over, Rand had condensed a significant amount of highly abstract philosophy into short statements designed to be understood by an audience of oppressed and censored Russian listeners. Rand\u2019s recorded interview was later broadcast to an audience of millions. In the mid-1970s, a Harvard University study estimated that 28 million Soviet citizens tuned in at least once per week. In 1980, Russian journalist Alexander Ginzberg remarked that \u201cthe VOA has as many listeners as Pravda has readers\u201d (Pravda was the regime\u2019s official newspaper).\n\nDespite the rich history of the VOA broadcasts, many of the original tapes were lost over the years. However, an audio recording of Rand\u2019s interview was preserved by the Ayn Rand Archives, likely the only copy still in existence. Recently, Shoshana Milgram, a Rand scholar at Virginia Tech, sought out the VOA interviewer, Ludmila Obolensky, and played the audio recording for her. According to Milgram, Obolensky was delighted to hear the recording for the first time in half a century, calling it \u201ca really substantial interview.\u201d\n\nThe Ayn Rand Institute recently augmented the original Russian audio with English subtitles provided by Gena Gorlin, and shared the interview at an exclusive donor roundtable, which featured commentary from Milgram and Gorlin. To bring the interview to a global audience, ARI has published it on YouTube and on Telegram.\n\nAlthough Putin\u2019s authoritarian regime in Moscow censors internet content, sometimes banning whole platforms like Instagram, YouTube is still accessible in Russia. So at least for the moment, the Russian people can once again hear the voice of Ayn Rand delivering her radical message of individualism and freedom in their own language.\n\nSUPPORT ARI If you value the ideas presented here, please become an ARI Member today.

She promoted the philosophy of Objectivism, expressing her ideas in her books, most notably, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged.\n\nBackground Rand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum on February 2, 1905, to a Russian-Jewish family in Saint Petersburg. Her father, Zinovy Rosenbaum, was a prosperous pharmacist and her mother was socially ambitious and religiously observant.\n\nEducation After being tutored at home, Alissa Rosenbaum, the eldest of three children, was enrolled in Stoiunina Gymnasium where she excelled academically but was socially isolated. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, her father\u2019s shop was confiscated by communist authorities, an event she deeply resented. As a student at Leningrad State University (present Saint Petersburg State University), she studied history and became acquainted with the works of Plato and Aristotle. After graduating in 1924, she enrolled in the Russian State Institute of Performing Arts, hoping to become a screenwriter.\n\nCareer The arrival of a letter from cousins in Chicago gave her an opportunity to leave the country on the pretext of gaining expertise that she could apply in the Soviet film industry. Upon her arrival in the United States in 1926, she changed her name to Ayn Rand. After six months in Chicago, she moved to Hollywood, where a fortuitous encounter with the producer Cecil B. DeMille led to work as a movie extra and eventually to a job as a screenwriter. Soon hired as a filing clerk in the wardrobe department of RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., she rose to head of the department within a year, meanwhile writing stories, plays, and film scenarios in her spare time. She became an American citizen in 1931.\n\n\n\nRand\u2019s first successful play, Night of January 16th (1933; originally titled Penthouse Legend), was a paean to individualism in the form of a courtroom drama. In 1934 she and O\u2019Connor moved to New York City so that she could oversee the play\u2019s production on Broadway. That year she also wrote Ideal, about a self-centered film star on the run from the law, first as a novel and then as a play. However, she shelved both versions. The play was not produced until 1989, and the novel was not published until 2015. Her first published novel, We the Living (1936), was a romantic tragedy in which Soviet totalitarianism epitomized the inherent evils of collectivism, which she understood as the subordination of individual interests to those of the state. A subsequent novella, Anthem (1938), portrayed a future collectivist dystopia in which the concept of the self and even the word \u201cI\u201d have been lost.\n\n\n\nRand spent more than seven years working on her first major work, The Fountainhead (1943), the story of a handsome architectural genius whose individualism and integrity are evinced in his principled dedication to his own happiness. The hero, Howard Roark, blows up a public housing project he had designed after it is altered against his wishes by government bureaucrats. On trial for his crime, he delivers a lengthy speech in his own defense in which he argues for individualism over collectivism and egoism over altruism (\u201cthe doctrine which demands that man live for others and place others above self\u201d). The jury votes unanimously to acquit him. Despite generally bad reviews, the book attracted readers through word of mouth and eventually became a best seller. Rand sold it to Warner Brothers studio and wrote the screenplay for the film, which was released in 1949.\n\n\n\nHaving returned to Los Angeles with O\u2019Connor to work on the script for The Fountainhead, Rand signed a contract to work six months a year as a screenwriter for the independent producer Hal Wallis. In 1945 she began sketches for her next novel, Atlas Shrugged, which is generally considered her masterpiece. The book depicts a future United States on the verge of economic collapse after years of collectivist misrule, under which productive and creative citizens (primarily industrialists, scientists, and artists) have been exploited to benefit an undeserving population of moochers and incompetents.\n\n\n\nIn 1950 Rand agreed to meet a young admirer, Nathan Blumenthal, on the basis of his several articulate fan letters. The two established an immediate rapport, and Blumenthal and his girlfriend, Barbara Weidman, became Rand\u2019s friends as well as her intellectual followers. In 1951 the couple moved to New York, and Rand and O\u2019Connor soon followed. There the Brandens, as Nathan and Barbara called themselves after their marriage in 1953, introduced Rand to their friends and relatives, some of whom later attended regular meetings at Rand\u2019s apartment for discussion and to read newly written chapters of Atlas Shrugged. The group, which called itself the Class of \u201943 (a reference to the publication date of The Fountainhead) or (ironically) the Collective, included Alan Greenspan, an economics consultant who would later head the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers (1974\u201377) and serve as chairman of the Federal Reserve (1987\u20132006).\n\n\n\nIn the late 1950s, with Rand\u2019s permission, Branden established a business designed to teach the basic principles of objectivism to sympathetic readers of Rand\u2019s novels. The Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), as it was later called, offered courses in objectivism in New York and distributed tape-recorded lectures by Branden to \u201cobjectivist centers\u201d in various other cities. Despite its outward appearance as an educational institution, NBI did not permit its students to think critically about objectivism or to develop objectivist ideas in novel ways. Through the success of NBI, Branden would eventually become the public guardian of objectivist orthodoxy against innovation or unauthorized borrowing by objectivist sympathizers, especially among the growing student right. In 1962 Branden and Rand launched the monthly Objectivist Newsletter (renamed The Objectivist in 1966). Meanwhile, Rand\u2019s fame grew apace with the brisk sales of her novels. She was invited to speak at numerous colleges and universities and was interviewed on television talk shows and on the news program 60 Minutes. Growing into her role as a public intellectual, she published her first work of nonfiction, For the New Intellectual, largely a collection of philosophical passages from her fiction, in 1961. The Virtue of Selfishness (1964) and Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal (1966) were drawn mostly from lectures and newsletter articles.\n\n\n\nIn 1968 Rand learned that Branden, with whom she had been having an intermittent affair (with their spouses\u2019 knowledge) since 1954, was involved in a romantic relationship with a younger woman. Accusing him of betraying objectivist principles, she stripped him of his partnership in The Objectivist and demanded that he surrender control of NBI, which was soon dissolved. The closing of the institute freed various self-described objectivists to publicly develop their own interpretations of Rand\u2019s philosophy - all of which, however, she rejected as perversions or plagiarism of her ideas. She was especially incensed at the use of objectivist vocabulary by young libertarians, whom she accused of disregarding morality and flirting with anarchism.\n\n\n\nIn 1971 Rand ceased publication of The Objectivist and replaced it with the fortnightly Ayn Rand Letter, which appeared with increasing irregularity until 1976. In 1974 she underwent surgery for lung cancer. Although she recovered, she never again had the energy to pursue large-scale writing projects. In 1979 she published Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, a collection of philosophical articles originally written in 1967. She was working on an adaptation of Atlas Shrugged for a television miniseries - eventually unrealized - when she died.\n\nAchievements Ayn Rand remains a significantly influential philosopher among libertarians and American conservatives. Today, her books have sold in the millions, and she\u2019s the subject of an Oscar-nominated documentary, a U.S. postage stamp, university courses, and a philosophical society devoted to the study of her thought.\n\n\n\nAyn Rand has been a major inspiration for the Tea Party movement, which has swept a new generation of Republicans and self-described conservatives into power.\n\nReligion When asked about religion, Rand answered: \"Qua religion, no - in the sense of blind belief, belief unsupported by, or contrary to, the facts of reality and the conclusions of reason. Faith, as such, is extremely detrimental to human life: it is the negation of reason. But you must remember that religion is an early form of philosophy, that the first attempts to explain the universe, to give a coherent frame of reference to man's life and a code of moral values, were made by religion before men graduated or developed enough to have philosophy.\"\n\nPolitics Rand was a thinker forged in the Russian revolution, which happened in her home city of St. Petersburg when she was around 12. Her family\u2019s property was confiscated in the revolution. It happened at a formative moment of her life: She looked at the ideas of the Russian Revolution, which were equality and fairness, in the name of the people, and she saw that they led, in the experience of her family, to the seizure of their property. And she decided these ideals - fairness, equality, justice - were really just a cover for the state being able to do what it wanted and to trample over the rights of the individual.\n\n\n\nSo Rand was born as an individualist philosopher at that moment, in late 1917, early 1918, and then her ideas continued to develop in the context of the Cold War. And she began to see a global struggle between individualism, embodied in countries like the United States and the capitalist system, and collectivism, embodied in Soviet Russia, which she knew best, but also in Nazi Germany. So she fled Russia as a young woman and came to the United States.\n\n\n\nRand's political view's emphasized individual rights, she considered laissez-faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her opinion it was the only system based on the protection of those rights.\n\n\n\nOn the level of concrete policy, Rand defended a woman\u2019s right to abortion and was a four-square supporter of freedom of speech (both \u201cliberal\u201d causes). She also attacked racism ( a \u201cliberal\u201d bugbear) as grossly collectivist. However, she rejected affirmative action policies (the favored \u201cliberal\u201d solution) for exactly the same reason.\n\n\n\nRand's rejection of what she deemed to be \"primitivism\" extended to the Middle East peace process in the 1970s. Following the Arab-Israeli War of 1973, Rand denounced Arabs as \"primitive\" and \"one of the least developed cultures\" who \"are typically nomads\". Consequently, Rand contended Arab resentment for Israel was a result of the Jewish state being \"the sole beachhead of modern science and civilization on their (Arabs) continent\" while decreeing that \"when you have civilized men fighting savages, you support the civilized men, no matter who they are.\"\n\nViews Ayn Rand is the founder of the philosophy of objectivism. She described it in an appendix to Atlas Shruggedas as \"the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.\" In novels such as The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, Rand dramatized her ideal individual, the producer who lives by his own effort and does not give or receive the undeserved, who honors achievement and rejects envy. Rand laid out the details of her world-view in nonfiction books such as The Virtue of Selfishness and Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal. The following overview will give you a solid foundation in the basics of her ideas.\n\n\n\nAyn Rand\u2019s philosophy begins by embracing the basic fact that existence exists. Reality is, and in the quest to live we must discover reality\u2019s nature and learn to act successfully in it. To exist is to be something, to possess a specific identity. This is the Law of Identity: A is A. Facts are facts, independent of any consciousness. No amount of passionate wishing, desperate longing or hopeful pleading can alter the facts. Nor will ignoring or evading the facts erase them: the facts remain, immutable.\n\n\n\nIn Rand\u2019s philosophy, reality is not to be rewritten or escaped, but, solemnly and proudly, faced. One of her favorite sayings is Francis Bacon\u2019s: \"Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed.\" Reality - that which exists - has no alternatives, no competitors, nothing \"transcending\" it. To embrace existence is to reject all notions of the supernatural and the mystical, including God.\n\n\n\nConcerning morality, Rand argues, that its purpose is to teach us what is in our self-interest, what produces happiness. \"Man has,\" she observes, \"no automatic code of survival... His senses do not tell him automatically what is good for him or evil, what will benefit his life or endanger it, what goals he should pursue and what means will achieve them, what values \u200b\u200bhis life depends on, what course of action it requires.\" This is what the science of ethics studies - and what Objectivism offers. \"Man must choose his actions, values \u200b\u200band goals,\" she summarizes, \u201cby the standard of that which is proper to man - in order to achieve, maintain, fulfill and enjoy that ultimate value, that end in itself, which is his own life.\"\n\n\n\nShe thought capital punishment was morally just, but legally dangerous - because of the possibility of jury errors which could not be rectified after the death of the innocent man. She had no position on whether there should be a death penalty or not.\n\n\n\nRand acknowledged Aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend \"three A's\" - Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayn Rand. Quotations: \"An individualist is a man who says: 'I'll not run anyone's life - nor let anyone run mine. I will not rule nor be ruled. I will not be a master nor a slave. I will not sacrifice myself to anyone - nor sacrifice anyone to myself.'\"\n\n\n\n\"There is no difference between communism and socialism, except in the means of achieving the same ultimate end: communism proposes to enslave men by force, socialism - by vote. It is merely the difference between murder and suicide.\"\n\n\n\n\"What is greatness? I will answer: it is the capacity to live by the three fundamental values of John Galt: reason, purpose, self-esteem.\"\n\n\n\n\"Even if smog were a risk to human life, we must remember that life in nature, without technology, is wholesale death.\"\n\n\n\n\"The worst evil that you can do, psychologically, is to laugh at yourself. That means spitting in your own face.\"\n\n\n\n\"Man - every man - is an end in himself, not a means to the ends of others; he must live for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself; he must work for his rational self-interest, with the achievement of his own happiness as the highest moral purpose of his life.\"\n\n\n\n\"There is no such thing as duty. If you know that a thing is right, you want to do it. If you don't want to do it - it isn't right. If it's right and you don't want to do it - you don't know what right is and you're not a man.\"\n\n\n\n\"The highest thing in a man is not his god. It's that in him which knows the reverence due a god. You are my highest reverence.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am. I think. I will.\"\n\n\n\n\"Anyone who fights for the future, lives in it today.\"\n\n\n\n\"I shall choose friends among men, but neither slaves nor masters. And I shall choose only such as please me, and them I shall love and respect, but neither command nor obey. And we shall join our hands when we wish, or walk alone when we so desire.\"\n\n\n\n\"In the temple of his spirit, each man is alone.\"\n\n\n\n\"Racism is the lowest, most crudely primitive form of collectivism.\"\n\nPersonality Ayn Rand was highly intelligent, passionate about ideas, and strongly idealistic. She was known for having a fierce temper. She drove herself on a ruthless schedule: she worked seven days a week, for as many hours each day as she was able to write. It was not unusual for her to eat dinner at midnight.\n\n\n\nVirginia Postrel, cultural critic, former Reason editor and author of several books including The Power of Glamour: Longing and the Art of Visual Persuasion, called Rand \"very much a woman of her time.\"\n\n\n\n\"Her taste and personal style combined modernist design ideals with the movie glamour of the 1920s and '30s. They expressed who she wanted to be and how she wanted the world to be: scientific, strong, streamlined, and modern,\" Postrel said in an interview with The Atlas Society (TAS).\n\n\n\nWhile many view Rand as an iconoclast, \"her ideals of luxury in clothing and interior design are straight out of the costumes and sets of 1930s movies.\" Postrel said, and these styles showed up on her characters as well. Dagny Taggart, the executive heroine of Atlas Shrugged, notably wore a one-shouldered black evening gown that featured a cape that covered just one arm and shoulder. Physical Characteristics: Ayn Rand was of average build with her height being approximately 5' 2\" (157 cm). She had dark brown hair and dark brown eyes. Quotes from others about the person \"A passionate hater of religion, Rand founded a cult around her own person, complete with rituals of excommunication; a passionate believer in rationality and logic, she was incapable of seeing the contradictions in her own work. She was a rationalist who was not entirely rational; she could not distinguish between rationalism and rationality. Of narrow aesthetic sympathies, she laid down the law in matters of artistic judgment like a panjandrum; a believer in honesty, she was adept at self-deception and special pleading. I have rarely read a biography of a writer I should have cared so little to meet.\" - Theodore Dalrymple\n\n\n\n\"[Her work] is both angry and exaltedly idealistic, a tortured hymn to integrity. In it one sees the union of passionate idealism with a profound scorn for those who\u2026 renounce the responsibility of translating their ideals into action and reality.\" - Barbara Branden\n\n\n\n\"I believe Ayn Rand's first love poem went: Roses are red/ violets are blue/ finish this poem yourself / you dependent parasite.\" - Stephen Colbert\n\n\n\n\"Ayn Rand is one of those things that a lot of us, when we were 17 or 18 and feeling misunderstood, we'd pick up. Then, as we get older, we realize that a world in which we're only thinking about ourselves and not thinking about anybody else, in which we're considering the entire project of developing ourselves as more important than our relationships to other people and making sure that everybody else has opportunity \u2013 that that's a pretty narrow vision.\" - Barack Obama\n\n\n\n\"There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old\u2019s life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged.

Early in her career she also wrote short stories, plays, and screenplays. Rand\u2019s first and most autobiographical novel, We the Living (1936), set in the Soviet Union, was published only after many rejections, owing to widespread sympathy for the Soviet \u201cexperiment\u201d among the intellectuals of the day. We the Living was quickly followed by the dystopian novel, Anthem (1938), written as \u201ca kind of rest\u201d from work on her next major novel, The Fountainhead (1943). The Fountainhead, also published after many rejections because of its individualism, and largely panned by critics, soon became a best-seller by word of mouth. The Fountainhead brought Rand international fame, and Atlas Shrugged (1957) sealed this fame. By 1958, Rand\u2019s novels, increasingly philosophical, had won her ideas a sufficiently devoted following for her to form, in association with psychologist Nathaniel Branden (with whom she later broke), an official \u201cObjectivist\u201d philosophical movement, complete with journals and lecture courses. For all her popularity, however, only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously. As a result, most of the serious philosophical work on Rand has appeared in non-academic, non-peer-reviewed journals, or in books, and the bibliography reflects this fact. We discuss the main reasons for her rejection by most professional philosophers in the first section. Our discussion of Rand\u2019s philosophical views, especially her moral-political views, draws from both her non-fiction and her fiction, since her views cannot be accurately interpreted or evaluated without doing so.\n\n1. Introduction\n\n1.1 Ayn Rand and Philosophy\n\nIn Rand\u2019s own words, her first and greatest love, her \u201clife purpose\u201d, was \u201cthe creation of the kind of world \u2026 that represents human perfection\u201d, while her interest in philosophical knowledge was \u201conly\u201d for the sake of this purpose (Journal entry for 4 May 1946; in 1997: 479).[1] Nevertheless, her interest in philosophical knowledge continued long after she had created this world in her magnum opus, Atlas Shrugged, her last work of fiction. In her non-fiction, Rand developed a conception of metaphysical realism, rationality, ethical egoism (rational self-interest), individual rights, laissez-faire capitalism, and art, and applied her philosophy to social issues. She wrote polemical, philosophical essays, often in response to questions by fans of Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead; lectured on college campuses; and gave radio and television interviews. In her own words, her philosophy,\n\nin essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute. (Rand 1957 [1992]: Afterword)\n\nCapitalism, \u201cthe unknown ideal\u201d, is for her the only political-economic system compatible with this philosophy because it is the only system based on respect for human beings as ends in themselves. The free-market libertarian political movement, though largely disowned by Rand, drew\u2014and draws\u2014great inspiration from her moral defense of the minimal state, that is, the state whose only raison d\u2019\u00eatre is protection of individual rights.\n\nWhereas Rand\u2019s ideas and mode of presentation make Rand popular with many non-academics, they lead to the opposite outcome with academics. She developed some of her views in response to questions from her readers, but seldom took the time to defend them against possible objections or to reconcile them with the views expressed in her novels. Her philosophical essays lack the self-critical, detailed style of analytic philosophy, or any serious attempt to consider possible objections to her views. Her polemical style, often contemptuous tone, and the dogmatism and cult-like behavior of many of her fans also suggest that her work is not worth taking seriously.[2] Further, understanding her views requires reading her fiction, but her fiction is not to everyone\u2019s taste. It does not help that she often dismisses other philosophers\u2019 views on the basis of cursory readings and conversations with a few philosophers and with her young philosophy student acolytes. Some contemporary philosophers return the compliment by dismissing her work contemptuously on the basis of hearsay. Some who do read her work point out that her arguments too often do not support her conclusions. This estimate is shared even by many who find her conclusions and her criticisms of contemporary culture, morality, and politics original and insightful. It is not surprising, then, that she is either mentioned in passing, or not mentioned at all, in the entries that discuss current philosophical thought about virtue ethics, egoism, rights, libertarianism, or markets. (Readers may also find the entry on Nozick\u2019s political philosophy to be of interest.) We present specific criticisms of her arguments and claims below, in the relevant sections of this entry.\n\n1.2 Life and Work\n\nAyn Rand was born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum, to a bourgeois Jewish family in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 2 February 1905. A witness to the Russian Revolution and civil war, Rand opposed both the Communists and the Tsarists. She majored in history, but the social science program in which she was enrolled at Petrograd State University included philosophy, law, and philology. Her teachers emphasized\u2014as she herself later did\u2014the importance of developing systematic connections among different areas of thought (Sciabarra 2013). Rand\u2019s formal philosophical education included ancient philosophy (especially Plato and Aristotle), logic, philosophical psychology, Marxism-Leninism, and non-Marxist political thought. But she was evidently also exposed to Hegelian and Nietzschean ideas, which blossomed during this period (known as the Russian Silver Age), and read a great deal of Friedrich Nietzsche on her own. After graduating from Petrograd State University in 1924, an interest in screenwriting led her to enroll in the State Institute for Cinematography. On the literary side, she studied the great Russian novelists and poets, but fell in love with Victor Hugo, to whose influence she owes the \u201cRomantic Realism\u201d of her novels.\n\nIn 1925 Rand succeeded in obtaining permission to visit relatives in the United States; hating the Soviet system, she left with no intention of returning. After six months with relatives in Chicago, she made her way to Hollywood where, on her second day, a fortuitous encounter with Cecil B. DeMille led to a job as a script reader, and later as a screenplay writer. The next week she had another fortuitous encounter, this time with the actor Frank O\u2019Connor, whom she married in 1929. She was married to him till his death in 1979. She adopted the pen name Ayn Rand to (it is thought) protect her family back in Russia, although she also told the New York Evening Post in 1936 that \u201cRand\u201d was an abbreviation of her Russian surname.\n\nRand and her husband moved permanently to New York City in 1951, where she became involved with, and was influenced by, the circle of mostly New-York-based intellectuals involved in the revival of classical liberalism, such as the economic journalist Henry Hazlitt, the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, and the Canadian-American novelist, literary critic, and political philosopher Isabel Paterson. Rand also studied, and was a great admirer of, the Lockean philosophy of the American founding. Rand lived and worked in New York City until her death in 1982.\n\nRand holds that philosophy, like all forms of knowledge and achievement, is important only because it is necessary for living a good human life and creating a world conducive to living such a life. Philosophy supplies the most fundamental cognitive and normative abstractions which, respectively, identify and evaluate what is. Everyone, according to Rand, needs a philosophy and is guided by at least an implicit one (1982a: ch. 1). Her novels express her belief that if our philosophy is more or less correct, our lives will be more or less successful, if our philosophy is wildly off the mark, our lives will be disastrous. Philosophy thus has an urgent, practical importance. But unlike Marx, her philosophical and political antipode, Rand thinks that social change has to start with a moral revolution within each individual and the spread of the right ideas and ideals through rational discourse and the inspiration of art.\n\nRand\u2019s ideal human being appears, in varying degrees of development, in all her novels; her ideal world appears in Atlas Shrugged. Her novels feature striking, complex plots with subtle psychological explorations of her characters\u2019 emotions and thoughts, and philosophical reflections that rarely lose sight of the dramatic context. Like many famous Russian novelists, especially Dostoevsky, whom she recognized as a great psychologist, Rand also uses long speeches to lay out her philosophy, a device that has both its supporters and its detractors. She described Atlas Shrugged as a \u201cstunt novel\u201d and a murder mystery\u2014the murder of the human soul by a collectivist culture. By \u201csoul\u201d, however, she meant not an immortal substance that survives the death of the body\u2014she is not a dualist in any aspect of her philosophy\u2014but the mind, or the human spirit that celebrates life on this earth. She took a familiar phenomenon and literary trope\u2014a workers\u2019 strike\u2014and turned it on its head to show what happens when \u201cthe men of mind\u201d\u2014scientists, philosophers, industrialists, entrepreneurs, writers\u2014the \u201cprime movers\u201d of a society\u2014go on strike. It also purports to show how the wrong metaphysics can lead to the wrong ethics and thus to disastrous personal choices and a disastrous political and economic system, and how the right philosophy is needed for the rebirth of the soul and the rebuilding of the world. Her protagonists are not knights on white steeds rescuing damsels in distress, or swordsmen who can fight off a dozen enemies single-handed, but men and women in the mid-20th century industrial America of steel mills, skyscrapers, and glimmering highways: women who run transcontinental railroads and men who revolutionize architecture or (long before clean energy became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre) build a motor powered by static electricity to produce limitless, clean energy. Her novels show the importance of striving to be the best we can be:\n\nDo not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but never have been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible\u2026. (Atlas Shrugged, 1957 [1992]: 983).\n\nHer novels inspire readers because they present heroes of unbreached integrity, heroes who lead colorful and remarkable lives and succeed not in spite of, but because of, their uncompromising virtue. This estimate of their virtue is not, of course, shared by all: many readers find her characters wooden, her writing stilted, and her ethical and political views misguided.\n\nRand paid tribute to Aristotle, whom she considered the greatest of all philosophers, in the titles she gave to the three Parts of Atlas Shrugged (Non-Contradiction, Either-Or, A is A) and to one of the chapters (The Immovable Movers). While she differed sharply from Nietzsche on many issues, including rationality, free will, and individual rights, his influence is evident in her provocative, often aphoristic, point-counterpoint writing style, as well as in her \u201ctransvaluation\u201d of traditional values and her powerful affirmation of life and joy and the spirit of youth. In the Introduction to the 25th Anniversary edition of The Fountainhead, she stated that the novel\u2019s sense of life is best conveyed by a quotation from Nietzsche\u2019s Beyond Good and Evil: \u201cThe noble soul has reverence for itself\u201d. (For The Fountainhead\u2019s partly sympathetic and partly critical engagement with Nietzsche\u2019s ideas, see Hunt 2006.)\n\n1.3 Metaphysics and Epistemology\n\nFundamental to Rand\u2019s outlook\u2014so fundamental that she derives the name of her philosophical system, \u201cObjectivism\u201d, from it\u2014is a trichotomy among three categories: the intrinsic, the subjective, and the objective (ITOE: 52\u201354; Rand 1965: 13\u201323). An intrinsic phenomenon is one whose nature depends wholly on factors external to the mind; a subjective phenomenon is one whose nature depends wholly on the mind; and an objective phenomenon is defined, variously, as that which depends on the relation between a living entity\u2019s nature (including the nature of its mind) and its environment, or as that which depends on the relation between a properly functioning (rational) mind and extramental reality. Commentators are divided over the best way to interpret Rand\u2019s views on this issue.\n\nRand holds that there is a widespread tendency to ignore the third category or to assimilate it to the second, thus setting up a false dichotomy between the intrinsic and the subjective. On Rand\u2019s view, many of the fundamental questions of philosophy, from the existence of universals to the nature of value, involve fruitless debates over the false alternative \u201cintrinsic or subjective?\u201d in cases where the phenomenon in question is neither intrinsic nor subjective, but rather objective.\n\nIf ethics is the branch of philosophy concerned with practice, then in a sense all of Rand\u2019s philosophy is ethics, for Rand stresses \u201cthe supremacy of actual living over all other considerations\u201d, and insists that philosophy needs to be \u201cbrought up to the realm of actual living\u201d\u2014adding \u201cI say intentionally brought up to it, not down\u201d (Journal entry for 15 May 1934, p. 72; in Rand 1997: 73). Consequently, Rand regularly concerns herself with the practical implications and social relevance not only of moral and political philosophy, but likewise of the seemingly more arcane strata of metaphysics and epistemology\u2014as when she identifies errors in concept-formation as one of the roots of racism, or mind-body dualism as a root of the dichotomy between economic and personal freedom. This approach likewise reflects Rand\u2019s emphasis on integrating each piece of information into the total context of one\u2019s knowledge, and her consequent hostility to compartmentalization.\n\nRand\u2019s conviction of the vital practical importance of abstract theory may help to explain the passionately polemical nature of her philosophical writing (which some readers find inspiring and others hyperbolic and off-putting), although Nietzsche\u2019s influence, as well as the influence of her Marxist-Leninist education also probably play a role. Rand also tended\u2014perhaps owing in part to the same two influences\u2014to regard philosophical errors as revelatory of the psychological flaws of their authors.\n\nFor a more in-depth presentation of Rand\u2019s views on epistemology and metaphysics, please see the supplement on Epistemology and Metaphysics\n\n2. Ethics\n\n2.1 What is Ethics, and Why do we need It?\n\nEthics\n\nis a code of values to guide man\u2019s choices and actions\u2014the choices and actions that determine the purpose and the course of his life. (1961b: 13)\n\nBefore we can decide which code of values we should accept, we need to ask why we need a code of values at all. Rand claims that no philosopher before her has provided a scientific answer to this question, and so none has provided a satisfactory ethics.\n\nRand starts by describing value or \u201cthe good\u201d, in classical fashion, as the object of pursuit: \u201cthat which one acts to gain and/or keep\u201d (1961b: 16). Thus, the concept of value presupposes the concept of \u201can entity capable of acting to achieve a goal in the face of an alternative\u201d\u2014and the basic alternative facing any living entity is life or death (1961b: 16). It is the conditional nature of life that gives rise to values, not just human values, but values as such. As she puts it:\n\nMetaphysically, life is the only phenomenon that is an end in itself: a value gained and kept by a constant process of action. (1961b: 18)\n\nSurvival is the organism\u2019s ultimate value, the \u201cfinal goal or end to which all [its] lesser goals are the means\u201d, and the standard of all its other values: \u201cthat which furthers its life is the good, that which threatens it is the evil\u201d (pp. 16\u201317). The same, suitably modified, applies to human beings. Life is the standard and goal of all genuine human values, in the sense that all of them\u2014from food to philosophy to fine art to ethics\u2014must be explained and justified as requirements of human survival. \u201cEthics is an objective, metaphysical necessity of man\u2019s survival\u201d (p. 24). Thus,\n\n[t]he standard of value of the Objectivist ethics \u2026 is man\u2019s life, or: that which is required for man\u2019s survival qua man, (1961b: 25)\n\nthat is,\n\nthe terms, methods, conditions and goals required for the survival of a rational being through the whole of his lifespan\u2014in all those aspects of existence which are open to his choice. (1961b: 27)\n\nTo choose to live is to accept one\u2019s \u201cown life\u201d as one\u2019s \u201cethical purpose\u201d.\n\nRand\u2019s metaphysical arguments make three points central to her axiology and ethics. (1) All living entities have values, not only human beings, and only living entities have values: life necessitates value, and value depends on life. (2) An entity\u2019s values are determined by its objective life-needs, that is, by the requirements of survival for entities of its kind, and ethics is a requirement of human survival. (3) Thus, values are neither intrinsic properties of things, nor subjective, neither free-floating Platonic entities, nor mere matters of preference, time, or culture. Rather, values are relational or objective, dependent on the nature of the valuing entity and the nature of its environment.\n\nRand supports the first point by arguing that the concept of value entails the concept of life:\n\nepistemologically, the concept of \u201cvalue\u201d is genetically dependent upon and derived from the antecedent concept of \u201clife\u201d. (1961b: 18)\n\nShe asks the reader to\n\nimagine an immortal, indestructible robot, an entity which moves and acts, but which cannot be affected by anything, which cannot be changed in any respect, which cannot be damaged, injured or destroyed. (1961b: 16)\n\nSuch an entity, she concludes, cannot have values.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that all it shows is that an entity that cannot be destroyed or harmed cannot have values, and not that a non-living entity cannot have values. Unlike the robot of this example, real robots can be damaged or destroyed, by external as well as internal events. What it means for them to be damaged or destroyed is that they cannot perform their functions well, or at all. Hence they can, quite straightforwardly, be said to have values.[3] To take this into account, Rand would have to say that for an entity that has a function, values are determined by what it needs to function (well), and that the function of living beings is to survive (well). Hence she can still maintain that for living things, values are determined by its objective life-needs, hence that values are objective, and that ethics is a requirement of a proper human survival.\n\nRand\u2019s naturalism, and her rejection of intrinsicism and subjectivism in favor of objectivism, anticipate recent naturalisms and echo Aristotle\u2019s argument, against both the Platonist and the subjectivist, that \u201cthe good\u201d must always be good-for-something. Her conception of the function of morality is notable both for its affinity to, and its difference from, Thomas Hobbes\u2019 conception: like Hobbes, Rand sees morality as a necessary means to long-term survival, but unlike Hobbes, she does not see morality as requiring a contract or even as a fundamentally social affair. The need for morality, according to Rand, is dictated by our nature as creatures that must think and produce to survive; hence we would need morality even on a desert island. There is, however, no duty to survive; morality is based on a hypothetical imperative: if you choose to live, then you must value your own long-term survival as an ultimate end, and morality as a necessary means to it. If asked why the choice to live commits you to your own long-term survival rather than some other ultimate end (such as, for example, the greatest happiness of the greatest number (Nozick 1971), or becoming worthy of eternal life in heaven), the only answer is: because any other ultimate end, if consistently adhered to, would lead to death.\n\nRand\u2019s ethics is thus firmly teleological, this-worldly, and foundationalist. Virtue is \u201cthe act by which one gains/and or keeps\u201d values in light of a recognition of certain facts (1961b: 27, 28); it \u201cis not an end in itself \u2026 not its own reward\u201d (1957 [1992]: 939). A fact central to a \u201cscientific\u201d ethics is that reason is the chief indispensable human tool of survival, and we exercise reason by choice. Hence rationality is the fundamental moral virtue, a virtue implicated in all the other virtues, including productiveness (Section 2.4 below).\n\nRand is widely credited by Objectivists (Peikoff 1991; Binswanger 1990, 1992; Kelley & Thomas 1999\u2014see Other Internet Resources; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000, 2006) with having solved the is-ought problem by showing that morality is essential for long-term survival as a rational being, and so anyone who chooses to live ought to be moral (1961b: 19). But if the choice to live is itself a moral choice, in the sense that we ought to choose to live, then the argument proceeds from an ought to an ought, not from an is to an ought. On the other hand, if the choice to live is a non-moral choice (an idea that\u2019s hard to reconcile with Rand\u2019s general view that all significant choices are moral choices), then suicide can never be wrong, even if it is done for cowardly, irresponsible, or unjust reasons, a view that is obviously incoherent (King 1984 and Narveson 1998 criticize this and other aspects of Rand\u2019s moral views). Again, if morality is needed only for long-term survival, and choosing death is not immoral, then a suicide-bomber does no wrong in killing innocent people. But people don\u2019t lose their rights just because their killer has decided to kill himself. Darryl Wright seeks to save something of the commonsense view that the suicide-bomber acts wrongly by arguing that his choice to die without good reason \u201ccorresponds to a real defect or corruption\u201d in him (Wright 2011: 26\u201329). But this verdict contradicts the premise that choosing death is not immoral. For if the choice expresses a corruption in the character of the suicide-bomber, then the choice itself is immoral. Moreover, this response leaves untouched the most important criticism of the suicide-bomber\u2019s actions: that he violates other people\u2019s rights by using them as mere means to his own (wicked) ends.\n\nMore fundamentally, the very idea of morality resting on the choice to live is questionable (Long 2000, Badhwar 2001). Most of us rarely, if ever, make a choice to live: we live by default. By giving us desires for food and water, for pleasure and security, Nature gives us, as she gives other animals, the implicit desire to stay alive. Perhaps the most dramatic evidence is the existence of feral children, children who have managed to stay alive for years in the company of wild animals. When we grow up, the only time we seriously ask ourselves if we want to live or die is when living requires an effort on our part, such as in a grave illness, or deep depression, or emergency. But we start learning the difference between right and wrong (for example, don\u2019t hit others, don\u2019t grab their things, and so on) long before we ever consider whether to live or die. A deeper reflection on morality begins when we mature and start asking ourselves what constitutes happiness and a worthwhile life. But this is an inherently moral question to which the answers are inherently moral or immoral.\n\nLet let us now return to the question of how we should understand the relationship between long-term survival and survival as a rational being\u2014the life \u201cproper to a rational being\u201d (Rand 1961b: 27). Is a life proper to a rational being a necessary means, and only a necessary means, to literal, long-term survival? Or is such a life itself the ultimate goal, the kind of survival worth having? Again, what are we to make of the many passages in which Rand states that the ultimate goal is one\u2019s own happiness?\n\nSome of Rand\u2019s statements suggest that she had only one, consistent ethical view: the ultimate goal is the individual\u2019s own survival; the only way to survive long-term, i.e., over a complete life-span, is to live by the standard of man\u2019s life as a rational being, which means: to live morally; and happiness is the psychological \u201cresult, reward and concomitant\u201d (p. 32) of living thus. Many of Rand\u2019s commentators follow her in holding that there is only one consistent view, while disagreeing on the right interpretation of it (Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1978; Machan 1984, 2000; Peikoff 1991; Bidinotto 1994\u2014see Other Internet Resources; Hunt 1999; Kelley & Thomas 1999\u2014see Other Internet Resources; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000, 2006). Others (Mack 1984, 2003; Badhwar 1999, 2001; Long 2000) argue that Rand\u2019s writings actually allow of two, if not three, mutually incompatible views of the ultimate goal, and our task is to see which of these is the dominant or most plausible view. The three views are: survival, survival qua rational being, and happiness in the ancient Aristotelian sense of flourishing or eudaimonia. In the rest of Section 2, we will present the textual evidence for each of these views of the final goal, and the common objections to them, in turn.\n\nAll three views are, of course, egoist, in that the primary or sole intended beneficiary of morality is supposed to be the moral agent herself. But some of the criticisms usually levied at egoism lose some of their force when directed at the second and third views.\n\n2.2 Survival as the Ultimate Value\n\nThe survivalist view holds that just as literal survival is the ultimate value for other living entities, so it is for human beings (Kelley & Thomas 1999; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000). Survival is the source and final goal of all the actions of an entity, that which gives point to all its other values. For human beings, morality and happiness are both instrumental means to survival. The vicious can \u201cachieve their goals [only] for the range of a moment\u201d, as evidenced by \u201cany criminal or any dictatorship\u201d (1961b: 26).\n\n\u201cNon-survivalists\u201d make the following objections:\n\nThe biological premise that survival is the ultimate goal of all living things is mistaken. Animals of many species risk their own lives for the sake of reproduction, or for protecting their young or even their group. But even if survival were the ultimate goal of other species, it need not be ours. Even if our own survival needs were the source of all our values, it would not follow that survival must be the ultimate psychological and moral goal to which all our other values are merely necessary means. The genesis of x does not logically determine the ultimate goal of x. For example, the source of sexual desire is our reproductive capacity but, as Rand would agree, it doesn\u2019t follow that we ought to satisfy our sexual desires only if we want to reproduce. The survivalist view that turns happiness into a mere means to survival entails, quite implausibly, that a long, unhappy life is better than a somewhat shorter but happy life, and just as good as a long and happy one. Many dictators, including the Pharaohs of the past and the Stalins and Maos of the 20th century, have survived by making elaborate plans to preserve their lives and their power by using a combination of terror, myth, and bribery. Their gross injustice poses a far greater threat to the lives of their subordinates than to their own. Morality enhances the individual\u2019s chances of survival under normal circumstances, but it is not necessary for survival. And in some circumstances, such as in a dictatorship, acting morally decreases the individual\u2019s chances of survival, a point that Rand herself convincingly dramatizes in We the Living and Anthem. A survivalist ethics can support, at best, a bare-bones Hobbesian morality, not a virtue ethics. If Rand\u2019s virtues were necessary for survival, the human species would have perished a long time ago, instead of expanding exponentially. Her rich and challenging picture of human life and virtue in her novels points to a richer and more challenging conception of the final end than mere survival. Many of Rand\u2019s heroes, from Kira (We the Living) to Prometheus (Anthem) to John Galt (Atlas Shrugged), risk their lives for the sake of the values that make their lives worth living. Like Hobbes, Rand rightly points out that if everyone or most people were to start preying on each other, then no one would survive for long\u2014literally, and that generations of predators would end up destroying or driving away the producers, and thus destroying themselves (Anthem and Atlas Shrugged). But this doesn\u2019t show that a few predators in a society of producers cannot survive by predation. Indeed, Rand herself sometimes acknowledges that evil people can survive by free-riding (\u201chitch-hiking\u201d, as she calls it) on rational, productive people: If some men attempt to survive by means of brute force or fraud \u2026 it still remains true that their survival is made possible only by their victims, only by the men who choose to think and to produce the goods which they, the looters, are seizing. (1961b: 25) Rand often says that the final end is survival proper to a human being (1961b: 26), or that the final end is happiness (1961b: 27, 30). Neither can be reduced to survival simpliciter. In \u201cMan\u2019s Rights\u201d, Rand explains an individual\u2019s right to his own life as the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life. (1963b: 93 and 1967a: 321\u201322) \u201cLife\u201d here is explicated in terms of not only continued survival but also of fulfillment and enjoyment.\n\nFor all these reasons, a more plausible interpretation of Rand\u2019s view is that morality is required for surviving qua human being, that is, for living a life proper to a human being.\n\n2.3 Survival Qua Man as the Ultimate Value\n\nJust as the standard of value is survival qua human being, so the ultimate goal is one\u2019s own survival qua human being. To accept this standard and goal is to accept (i) the three cardinal values of reason, purpose (or purposiveness) and self-esteem as not only \u201cthe means to\u201d but also \u201cthe realization of one\u2019s ultimate value, one\u2019s own life\u201d (1961b: 27), and (ii) the three \u201ccorresponding virtues\u201d of rationality, productiveness, and pride. These values are means to one\u2019s life insofar as they further one\u2019s life as a rational being, and they realize it insofar as they express the value we place on our lives.\n\nWhat it means to value survival qua human being turns on the relationship of the three cardinal values to the three virtues. Rand often states that virtue is only a means to value. But when she explains how the three cardinal values \u201ccorrespond\u201d to their three virtues, she does not provide a means-end analysis (Badhwar 1999, 2001). Thus, she says:\n\nProductive work is the central purpose of a rational man\u2019s life, the central value that integrates and determines the hierarchy of all his other values. Reason is the source, the precondition of his productive work\u2014pride is the result. (1961b: 27)\n\nThe virtue of productiveness becomes the central example of purpose (one of the three cardinal values), reason (another cardinal value) becomes its source, and the virtue of pride becomes its result. Rand also defines rationality, which is \u201cthe basic virtue\u201d, in terms of\n\nthe recognition and acceptance of reason as one\u2019s only source of knowledge \u2026 and one\u2019s only guide to action. (1961b: 28)\n\nBy this definition, being rational means valuing reason in thought, word, and deed, and realizing reason in one\u2019s life means being rational: the virtue and the value entail each other.\n\nThis point generalizes to all the virtues and values. Further, since the (cardinal) values are both \u201cthe means to\u201d and \u201cthe realization of one\u2019s ultimate value\u201d (1961b: 27), it follows that the (cardinal) virtues are also both the means to and the realization of one\u2019s ultimate value: long-term survival qua human being. On this interpretation, to survive qua human being is none other than to lead a virtuous life in which one has realized one\u2019s potential.\n\nBoth survivalists and eudaimonists, however, point out that this conception of the final end contradicts Rand\u2019s oft-repeated claim that \u201cVirtue is not an end in itself.\u2026\u201d In addition, eudaimonists make the following objections:\n\nSince even a long, virtuous life need not be a happy one, positing it as the final end contradicts Rand\u2019s related claim that \u201cLife is the reward of virtue\u2014and happiness is the goal and reward of life\u201d (1957 [1992]: 939). It contradicts Rand\u2019s conception of the final end in her novels, where happiness is proclaimed as \u201cthe purpose, the sanction and the meaning of life\u201d (1957 [1992]: 674).\n\nIn addition, it is psychologically implausible to hold that we would choose mere survival as an end even if we were deeply unhappy and saw no happiness in our future (cf. Wright 2019 20).\n\nEudaimonists hold that the dominant and/or more plausible view expressed in Rand\u2019s writings is that happiness\u2014a happy life\u2014is the ultimate value, where a happy life is understood as a life of emotional fulfillment in worthwhile goals and activities. Happiness in this sense necessarily involves virtue, but is not identical with virtue (Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1978; Machan 1984, 2000; Mack 1984; Badhwar 1999, 2001; Hunt 1999; Long 2000).[4]\n\n2.4 Happiness as the Ultimate Value\n\nHappiness is the existentially and psychologically \u201csuccessful state of life\u201d (1961b: 27). As an emotion it is not simply a positive subjective state, as on some contemporary views, but an emotion that meets certain normative standards: \u201ca state of non-contradictory joy\u2014a joy without penalty or guilt\u201d, achievable only by\n\nthe man who desires nothing but rational goals, seeks nothing but rational values and finds his joy in nothing but rational actions. (1961b: 32)\n\nHappiness is also a form of life-affirmation:\n\nthe feeling of one\u2019s blessing upon the whole of the earth, the feeling of being in love with the fact that one exists and in this kind of world. (1957 [1992]: 105\u20136)\n\nThus, happiness is an emotionally positive state of mind in an objectively worthwhile state of life.\n\nRand holds that the pursuit of happiness is inseparable from the activity of maintaining one\u2019s life through the rational pursuit of rational goals (1961b: 29, 32). A virtuous life is, thus, essential to happiness. It is also a shield against soul-wracking unhappiness. Just as even great misfortunes don\u2019t throw Aristotle\u2019s virtuous individual into misery, they don\u2019t throw Rand\u2019s heroes into misery. Even at the worst of times, the virtuous individual\u2019s pain \u201conly goes down to a certain point\u201d (1943: 344), never touching the core of her being: the conviction that she is worthy and capable of happiness.[5]\n\nIn keeping with their richer conception of the final end, Rand\u2019s novels also employ a richer conception of virtue as an integrated intellectual-emotional character trait to think, feel, and act in certain ways, rather than simply as an act in light of a recognition of certain facts (Badhwar 1999, 2001). Her characters reveal their souls not only in what they say or do, notice or fail to notice, focus on or evade, on this or that occasion, but in their cognitive, emotional, and action dispositions, their style of being in the world. Their actions show not only an intellectual commitment to the right but a wholehearted \u201clove of rectitude\u201d (1957 [1992]: 512).\n\nThis basically Aristotelian view of virtue goes hand-in-hand with a basically Aristotelian view of emotions. Rand rejects the reason-emotion dichotomy as stemming, ultimately, from a false mind-body dichotomy. Emotions are neither raw feelings nor inherently irrational but, rather, automatized value-judgments:\n\nestimates of that which furthers man\u2019s values or threatens them \u2026 lightning calculators giving him the sum of his profit or loss. (1961b: 27)\n\nEmotions provide instant guidance when circumstances do not permit reasoning everything out anew. But our emotions are only as good as our reason, because they are \u201cprogrammed\u201d by our reason. Hence they can only be corrected by conscious reasoning, and in a conflict between reason and emotions, one must always side with the former.[6]\n\nEudaimonists argue that Rand\u2019s vision of a virtuous and happy life in her novels can be understood only as a form of eudaimonism, even if she sometimes makes statements inconsistent with this vision. The chief objection to eudaimonism is that, by defining a happy life partly in terms of virtue, it employs an unconvincing conception of happiness. The philosophical literature on happiness in this sense (usually called well-being) makes and answers this and other such objections (Annas 1993, Haybron 2008, Badhwar 2014).\n\n2.5 Virtues, Vices, and Egoism\n\nThe chief Objectivist virtues are rationality, integrity, honesty (with self and others), justice, independence, productiveness, and pride. Rationality,\n\none\u2019s total commitment \u2026 to the maintenance of a full mental focus in all issues, in all choices \u2026 to the fullest perception of reality within one\u2019s power, (1961b: 28)\n\nis the basic virtue of which the other virtues are aspects or derivatives. The virtues are thus united or reciprocal. Each virtue is defined partly in terms of a recognition of, and appropriate responsiveness to, some important fact or facts, a recognition and responsiveness understood by the agent to be indispensable for gaining, maintaining, or expressing her ultimate value. For example, integrity is \u201cthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake your consciousness\u201d (1957 [1992]: 936), a recognition that is expressed in loyalty to one\u2019s rational values and convictions, especially in the face of social pressures to surrender them (1961b: 28; 1964a: 52, 80); honesty is \u201cthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake existence\u201d, a recognition that is expressed in truthfulness in thought and speech (1957 [1992]: 936\u201337); and justice is\n\nthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake the character of men as you cannot fake the character of nature, \u2026 that every man must be judged for what he is and treated accordingly\u2026. (1957 [1992]: 937)\n\nConspicuous by their absence from Rand\u2019s list of the cardinal virtues are the \u201cvirtues of benevolence\u201d, such as kindness, charity, generosity, and forgiveness. Rand states that charity is not a major virtue or moral duty (1964b); likewise, presumably, kindness, generosity, and forgiveness. Whether, and how much, one should help others depends on their place in one\u2019s rationally defined hierarchy of values, and on the particular circumstances (whether they are worthy of help, what the likely consequences are of helping them, and so on). The greater their value vis-\u00e0-vis one\u2019s rational self-interest, the greater the help that one should be willing to give, ceteris paribus. What is never morally appropriate is to make a sacrifice, that is, to surrender something of value to oneself for the sake of something of less or no value to oneself. Thus, it can never be moral to knowingly risk one\u2019s life for a stranger (unless, of course, one\u2019s life is no longer worth living) or to court unhappiness for the happiness of another, whether stranger or friend. It is appropriate to help a stranger only in an emergency, and only when the risk to our own life or well-being is minimal (1963c: 43\u201345). This should not be taken to imply that helping a stranger is always morally optional, regardless of the circumstances. Indeed, people who are \u201ctotally indifferent to anything living and would not lift a finger to help a man or a dog left mangled by a hit-and-run driver\u201d are \u201cpsychopaths\u201d (1963c: 43\u201345) Rand makes even more concessions to \u201ccommon sense morality\u201d when she states that it\u2019s good to help a neighbor going through a hard time till he can get back on his own feet, if we can afford to and if we have no reason to think that he is undeserving. Charity understood thus is a virtue because it is an expression of the generalized good will and respect that all normal people have towards others as creatures who share with them the capacity to value (1963c: 46\u201347). Nathaniel Branden tries to reconcile charity with egoism by declaring that the former stems from a species-identification with another, such that, in revering others, people \u201care revering their own life\u201d. By acting charitably, people actualize this sense of kinship, without sacrificing their own well-being.\n\nThis last is true, but the desire to reduce all proper motivations to egoistic motivations leads Branden (and Rand and many Objectivists) to ignore the fact that charity is first and foremost profoundly other-regarding, prompted by another\u2019s plight rather than concern for one\u2019s own self-actualization. The same is true of trying to rescue a dog mangled by a hit-and-run driver, where the egoistic motivation must be even weaker, since here there is no species-identification, but rather only a \u201cgenus-identification\u201d with another sufferer.\n\nThe problem with Rand and Branden\u2019s ethical egoism can be sharpened by asking why we should not harm others, for example, by spitefully stepping on their gouty toes. Rand and Branden\u2019s answer has to be: because doing so will harm us. But why will it harm us? Because we have unjustly and irrationally hurt another out of spite, and injustice and irrationality are bad for us. But our action wouldn\u2019t be unjust and irrational if it didn\u2019t hurt them \u2013 if, in fact, stepping on their toes cured their gout and we did it for that reason. Clearly, then, the wrongness of our action and motivation depends, in the first instance, on what we know it will do to our victims. This is why we ought to apologize to them, and not to ourselves. It\u2019s right and important to consider the effect on ourselves of being spiteful, unjust, and irrational, but there is no good argument for the view that we ought to be just to others only or primarily because it is good for us. All other-regarding virtues are responses to other people\u2019s moral standing.\n\nAt any rate, the argument from identification can also be used to justify charity towards strangers in non-emergency situations, for example, towards those who are permanently disabled and unable to care for themselves (Badhwar forthcoming). Rand concedes as much in \u201cWhat is Capitalism?\u201d (1965) where she argues that people who are unable to work must rely on voluntary charity, thus implying that it is proper for those who can afford it to support strangers in non-emergency situations. And indeed, as recent scholarship has revealed, in her own life Rand was often extremely generous, not only towards friends and acquaintances, but also strangers.[7]\n\nThe question arises why Rand thinks that charity, kindness etc. are not major virtues when they meet all the conditions of appropriateness: the recipient is worthy of help, one can afford to help, it is in one\u2019s rational self-interest (or not contrary to it) to help, and so on. Perhaps Rand thinks that they are \u201cminor\u201d virtues because we are not obligated to act on them at all times, the way we are obligated to act justly and honestly at all times. A deeper reason, however, might be her conception of people as essentially agents rather than patients, doers rather than receivers, self-sufficient rather than dependent. Nevertheless, Rand\u2019s view of the unity of the virtues dictates that, even if we are not obligated to act on charity, kindness etc. at all times, they are just as important to possess as the other virtues. Moreover, in keeping with her emphasis on the importance of goodwill towards others and \u201cthe benevolent universe premise\u201d, Rand\u2019s heroes are often extraordinarily (and almost always appropriately) kind and generous, not only towards those they love but also towards mere acquaintances, and even sometimes adversaries. Striking examples include, from The Fountainhead, Howard Roark\u2019s unsought-for attempt to give hope and courage to Steven Mallory, the gifted young sculptor whose failure to get work has driven him to the verge of a spiritual and physical collapse, and Roark\u2019s unreproachful help to his erstwhile adversary, Peter Keating, when Keating falls on hard times. In Atlas Shrugged, Dagny offers support to a heart-broken and despairing Cheryl Taggart who, in the past, has treated Dagny with scorn, and Hank Rearden generously supports his exploitative family before he realizes their exploitativeness.[8] Rand\u2019s implicit recognition that kindness and generosity are important virtues is shown also in her depiction of her villains as lacking all kindness and generosity.\n\nJust as rationality, a focus on reality, is at the heart of every virtue, so irrationality, evasion of reality (including self-deception), is at the heart of every vice. Rand\u2019s villains are all master evaders motivated by a desire for power, social status, fame, or unearned wealth, and resentment of the good. They are \u201csecond-handers\u201d\u2014people whose primary relationship is to other people rather than to reality. Between the virtuous and the vicious are the \u201cinnocently wrong\u201d, people who adopt wrong moral principles or make wrong choices, not through evasion but through an error of judgment (Rand does not explicitly recognize any moral category other than virtue, vice, and moral error, although her novels portray characters that do not easily fit into any of these categories). Hank Rearden, in Atlas Shrugged, is the great innocent living under a burden of unearned guilt because of his mistaken sense of honor and a family interested only in manipulating and using him. Cheryl Taggart is killed by the too-sudden revelation that the man she loved and admired as the embodiment of her ideals is a fraud\u2014and that the world is full of such frauds.\n\nAs already indicated, Rand justifies virtue in both instrumental and non-instrumental terms, though without distinguishing between them. The instrumental arguments show the existential and psychological rewards of virtue and costs of vice. In her depiction of her heroes, Rand shows her conviction that virtue creates an inner harmony and serenity. Virtue also makes one trustworthy, and thus enables mutually beneficial interactions with others. Evasiveness, by contrast, traps one in a \u201ctangled web\u201d of rationalizations and pretenses. The evader who deceives others is either eventually caught, or lives in fear of getting caught, becoming dependent on others\u2019 unconsciousness. He is \u201ca fool\u201d, says a character in Atlas Shrugged, \u201cwhose source of values is the fools he succeeds in fooling\u201d (1957 [1992]: 945). Further, like Sartre, Rand holds that no evasion is completely successful, because the truth constantly threatens to resurface. Hence, the evader\u2019s \u201cdiseased soul\u201d is in a state of constant inner conflict and anxiety as he tries to suppress his awareness of uncomfortable truths while maintaining his hold on others. His lack of integrity and of esteem for reality results in a lack of self-love or self-esteem and, indeed, of a solid self. (It is noteworthy, however, that Rand\u2019s portrayal of Gail Wynand in The Fountainhead is closer to Aristotle\u2019s portrayal of the vicious man in Book III of the Nicomachean Ethics as someone who is \u201cunconscious of his vice\u201d than to her own stated view of the evader.)\n\nThese views are familiar from the history of philosophy, but many readers find their expression in Rand\u2019s novels to be of unusual psychological depth and conviction. Nevertheless, the views are subject to the well-known objection that the complexity and variability of human psychology and society allow only \u201cfor the most part\u201d generalizations about the existential and psychological benefits of virtue or costs of vice. For example, it is possible for a small injustice to lead to great rewards, especially since others are willing to shrug off or forgive occasional transgressions. It is also possible for poor introspection, forgetfulness, or self-acceptance to allow one to evade something without any need for supporting evasions or damage to one\u2019s self-esteem. Again, even if every wrongdoing carries psychological costs, these might sometimes be outweighed by the long-term psychological and existential costs of doing the right thing (as Rand herself suggests in her portrayal of the embittered Henry Cameron and Stephen Mallory in The Fountainhead).\n\nThe non-instrumentalist justification of virtue in Rand\u2019s novels is largely immune to these objections (though subject to the objections noted in 2.4 above). To compromise morally is, necessarily, to compromise one\u2019s own (objectively conceived) happiness, because no existential loss can compare to the loss of moral integrity. Rectitude is partly constitutive of genuine happiness because it expresses the right relationship to reality: to existence, to oneself, and to others. For the same reason, it is partly constitutive of a self worth loving, an ideally human or rational self. Any value gained at the price of rectitude is only the simulacrum of genuine value. In a variety of conceptually interconnected ways, then, virtuous individuals are necessarily better off than those willing to take moral short-cuts. In its structure and much of its content, Rand\u2019s ethical egoism is thus of a piece with the egoism of ancient eudaimonistic theories.\n\nOf course, this non-instrumentalist justification of virtue depends on the prior instrumentalist justification, viz., that in normal circumstances (that is, in a society of more or less virtuous people), virtue enables us to gain both external and psychological goods. If justice or kindness were systematically bad for human beings, leading to disease and death, they would not be virtues. If rationality routinely led to an early demise, no one would value rationality. But this does not entail, as Salmieri seems to think, that the ultimate value is literal survival (Salmieri 2019). All it entails is that the virtues be compatible with survival in normal circumstances. For it is easy to see that if justice or kindness systematically led to deep depression, and rationality routinely sucked the joy out of life, only the rare misery-lover would value his life, or the virtues. Survival is a necessary condition of a happy life (as well as an unhappy one), not an ultimate value. And it\u2019s only because the virtues lead to, and partly constitute, a happy (eudaimonic) life, that a virtuous person considers it a greater loss to betray his principles than to lose the work he loves \u2013 or, sometimes, even his life. One of the best examples of this from Rand\u2019s own work is Howard Roark\u2019s decision to act out of integrity, even at the cost of being unable to practice architecture (The Fountainhead). Another example concerns two minor characters in We The Living who risk \u2013 and lose \u2013 their freedom and lives for resisting the new communist regime. (Note, however, that Rand does not think that we are morally obligated to martyr ourselves to fight evil. All we are obligated to do is not be complicit in evil, or betray our values.)\n\nEven on this indirect, sophisticated egoism, where the good to the agent lies in being virtuous, Rand\u2019s theory is open to the objection often levied against egoistic theories, viz., that they give the wrong reason for acting in other-regarding ways \u2013 justly, kindly, etc. My act does not adequately express the virtue of justice if I give you your due solely or primarily because acting justly is good for me rather than because I recognize and respect your moral standing, your entitlement to be treated justly. Nor does my helping you when you need help adequately express goodwill or kindness if I help you solely or primarily because acting benevolently is good for me. One way out taken by some other theories is to argue that the egoist\u2019s justification is egoistic but not her motivation. Rand does not address the \u201cwrong-reason\u201d objection, but there is no hint in her writings that she would accept this dichotomy between justification and motivation. The root of the problem is that, although Rand rejects psychological egoism, she seems to regard genuine goodwill towards, or love of, others as an offshoot of proper self-love, as though there were no independent source of love for others in human nature. This is where her metaethics and ethics differ most starkly from that of Aristotle.\n\n2.6 Altruism\n\nAccording to Rand, there is only one alternative to being rationally self-interested: sacrificing one\u2019s proper interests, either for the sake of other people (which she equates with altruism) or for the sake of the supernatural (which she calls mysticism) (1982a: ch. 7). \u201cThe basic principle of altruism\u201d, she argues, \u201cis that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the only justification of his existence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue and value\u201d (\u201cFaith and Force,\u201d PWNI 61). Kant\u2019s ethics is a secularized mysticism insofar as it rests on categorical commands and duty for duty\u2019s sake, which is to say: regardless of any earthly desire or interest (1970). An altruistic ethics equates right action with self-sacrifice for the sake of others\u2019 good and immorality with \u201cselfishness\u201d, while saying nothing about the standard of the good (\u201cIntroduction\u201d, 1964a: iii; 1974). It thus fails to answer the prior question of what code of values we should follow and why, and provides no motivation to be moral other than guilt over \u201cselfishness\u201d. When taken to its logical conclusion, altruism does not simply tell us that it is \u201cselfish\u201d to pursue our own desires, but also that it is \u201cselfish to uphold\u2026 [our own] convictions, \u2026 [that we] must sacrifice them to the convictions of others\u201d (Rand 1957 [1992]: 943; Galt\u2019s Speech, Rand 1961a: 142). In foreign policy, altruism is used to justify and gain support for America\u2019s intervention in other countries (1966a). Altruism is also the reason why so many sympathize with, or even praise, bloody dictatorships that proudly proclaim that the sacrifice of the individual is a necessary and noble means to the goal of the collective good (Rand 1966a).\n\nAs a moral code, altruism is impractical, because its requirements are contrary to the requirements of life and happiness, both the agent\u2019s and other people\u2019s. As such, it is also profoundly immoral. Altruism leaves us without any moral guidance in our everyday lives and gives morality a bad name.\n\nWhat, then, is the psychological explanation for the widespread equation of altruism with morality? Rand suggests various explanations reminiscent of Nietzsche\u2019s analysis of the psychology of altruism. The theorists and preachers of altruism are motivated largely by a desire to control and manipulate others by playing on their guilt. Those who accept their teachings typically do so either because of guilt over their own superior achievements, or because, lacking any \u201cintellectual integrity, love of truth\u2026or a passionate dedication to an idea\u201d, they have nothing much worth saving, and so do not mind sacrificing themselves (\u201cSelfishness Without a Self\u201d, 1973b; 1982a). Some altruists are altruists because their mentalities are still frozen in a tribal past when survival required the sacrifice of some for the sake of others (1973b). Rand herself rejects a zero-sum picture of human relationships, so long as everyone in the relationship acts rationally.\n\nRand\u2019s defense of \u201cselfishness\u201d (rational self-interest) and rejection of altruism (living for others\u2019 sake) are part of the reason both for her popularity with the general reader, and her unpopularity with philosophers and other intellectuals, although some would no doubt agree with her rejection of abject self-sacrifice and her recognition of proper concern with the self as moral (Falk 1963; Gilligan 1982; Hampton 1993; Badhwar 1993a). The general reader who responds positively to Rand\u2019s work finds, for the first time, a moral justification for pursuing a life of her or his own and a liberation from \u201cunearned guilt\u201d. The philosopher who responds negatively to her work finds many biased and simplistic interpretations of philosophers and philosophical doctrines, including her claim that she is the first to consistently defend a morality of rational self-interest, all other philosophers having defended either altruism or mysticism (Pojman 1995). Her critics also challenge her equation of altruism with abject self-sacrifice (Rachels 2000, Flew 1984), and her claim (explained below) that there is no conflict between people\u2019s rational interests (Flew 1984).\n\n3. Social-Political Philosophy\n\n3.1 Rights, Capitalism, the Trader Principle, and Government\n\n\u201cForce and mind are opposites; morality ends where a gun begins\u201d (Atlas Shrugged 1023). Not only actually shooting someone, but also threatening him with a gun, is an act of force. The non-initiation of force against others is the basic moral principle guiding our interactions with others, whether in a political society, or in the state of nature. It is also the basic political principle: \u201cno man may initiate the use of physical force against others. \u2026 Men have the right to use physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use\u201d (1961b, 1964a: 36). This political principle binds not only individuals in their interactions with each other, but also, importantly, the government. Rand\u2019s ideal society is a society of independent individuals who respect each other\u2019s rights to life, liberty, and property, and who trade value for value, materially and spiritually. They live, in her words, by \u201cthe trader principle\u201d. Individual rights and the trader principle are both dictated by the fact that, as rational, independent beings, we need to think and act for our \u201cproper survival\u201d (1961b: 31). Both are based in human nature, and required by respect for individuals as ends in themselves, not mere means to others\u2019 ends. But what exactly is a right?\n\n\u201cRights\u201d are a moral concept\u2014the concept that provides a logical transition from the principles guiding an individual\u2019s actions to the principles guiding his relationship with others\u2014the concept that preserves and protects individual morality in a social context\u2014the link between the moral code of a man and the legal code of a society, between ethics and politics. Individual rights are the means of subordinating society to moral law. (1963b: 92).\n\nAgain,\n\nA \u201cright\u201d is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man\u2019s freedom of action in a social context. (1964a 93).\n\nThese rights are based in human nature, and are basically rights to actions, not to things or outcomes, and they can be violated only through the initiation or threat of force, or through fraud. Hence, all natural rights are negative, that is, claims on others\u2019 non-interference, and not claims on them to provide one with certain goods or outcomes.[9] The fundamental right is the right to life: the right to take the actions necessary for sustaining the life proper to a human being.\n\nThe right to life means\u2026the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life. (Such is the meaning of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.). (1963b: 93)\n\nThe right to liberty is the right to act (including to write and speak) on one\u2019s judgment; the right to the pursuit of happiness is the right to pursue goals for one\u2019s own fulfillment; the right to property is \u201cthe right to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values\u201d (1963b: 94). Like the mind-body dichotomy, the common dichotomy between \u201chuman rights\u201d and the right to property is a false one, because to own one\u2019s life is to own one\u2019s actions and their fruits (1962b: 91).[10] Just as there is a causal and logical connection between the virtues, so there is between these rights: a government that violates human rights also violates property rights. Thus, for example, in violating the right to freedom of expression by banning \u201cobscene\u201d speech on TV, the government violates the property right of the owners of the TV station to use their property as they see fit. Like other libertarians, both right (market) and left (egalitarian), Rand opposes state regulation of morality, as well as forced service to the state, whether military or civilian. She criticizes both conservatives and liberals (as these terms are understood in American politics) for wanting government to control the realm they regard as important: the spiritual or moral realm in the case of conservatives, and the material or economic realm in the case of liberals (1981b). Both sides thus betray a lack of understanding of the fact that human beings need to be free in both realms to be free in either.\n\nCritics have pointed out that if we have rights only because we need them for our survival and happiness, then we have no right to take actions that are contrary to our survival and happiness, such as blindly following a guru instead of thinking for ourselves, living off others because we prefer the life of a couch potato to fending for ourselves, wasting our property instead of using it wisely, or, most obviously, committing suicide (Mack 1984; Zwolinski 2019). Yet the freedom to do only that which is morally good or rational is no freedom. But there is another interpretation of the claim that \u201cThe right to life means\u2026the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life.\u201d What Rand is pointing out here is that we would not have rights if we did not need them for our survival and happiness (Badhwar 2017, Miller & Mossoff 2019). This need (and the fact that we value our survival and happiness) is the source of rights. If by our very nature we didn\u2019t care whether we lived or died, didn\u2019t care about being forced by the government or other people to act in certain ways and not others, had no use for property, and couldn\u2019t be bothered to think for ourselves, we would have no rights. It doesn\u2019t follow, however, that we don\u2019t have the right to act contrary to the requirements of our survival or happiness. As Rand says elsewhere:\n\nA right is the sanction of independent action. A right is that which can be exercised without anyone\u2019s permission (Rand 2018 83). [A] right is the moral sanction of a positive, of his freedom to act on his own judgment, for his own goals, by his own voluntary, uncoerced choice. (Rand 1963b 93.)\n\nIn spite of several statements that justify such freedom in terms of the individual\u2019s rational judgments (Rand 1965 17), it is the position taken here that is compatible with Rand\u2019s deep-seated commitment to liberty and a minimal government.\n\nAnother criticism of Rand\u2019s theory of rights is that it is incompatible with her ethical egoism, because respect for others\u2019 rights cannot be justified as a means to the ultimate end of one\u2019s survival (Mack 1984; Flew 1984). For under perfectly realistic scenarios, one\u2019s survival can require one to violate another\u2019s right to life or property. Thus, according to these critics, Rand\u2019s defense of rights suffers from the same unresolved tension between the instrumentalist strand and the deontic strand that we find in her justification of morality in general (Mack 1984, 2003). On our eudaimonistic interpretation of Rand\u2019s ethical egoism and theory of rights, there is no incompatibility between the two. Nevertheless, as we\u2019ve argued above, both her ethical egoism and her theory of rights face the criticism that the primary reason for respecting others\u2019 rights, or exercising any of the other-regarding virtues, is not one\u2019s eudaimonia but the fact that others are ends in themselves. What promotes our eudaimonia is recognizing this and living accordingly, but our own eudaimonia is not the primary reason for respecting people\u2019s rights.\n\nEverything said so far shows that Rand believes that individuals have rights even in a state of nature, or a society without a government. Yet in later years, in a workshop on rights, Rand suggests that rights exist only in a society with some kind of authority and a \u201cformulated morality\u201d (2018: 111). It is not clear what Rand means by \u201cformulated morality\u201d: a written, or at least explicitly stated, morality that recognizes rights, like the Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution? Or like Thomas Paine\u2019s Rights of Man?? But aren\u2019t there many societies \u2013 perhaps a majority \u2013 that don\u2019t have a formulated morality yet do recognize at least individuals\u2019 basic rights against each other and the government, and many that can produce paper Constitutions claiming to recognize these rights that, in fact, they deny their citizens? In any case, Rand takes back her controversial statement by reiterating her earlier view that:\n\nThe source of man\u2019s rights is not divine law or congressional law, but the law of identity. A is A and Man is Man. Rights are conditions of existence required by man\u2019s nature for his proper survival (\u201cGalt\u2019s Speech,\u201d Rand 1961a: 182).\n\nWhat we don\u2019t have in the absence of a government, she says, is objectively defined laws that can determine if a right has been violated (2018: 211). A \u201cproper government,\u201d in her words, \u201cis the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control, i.e., under objectively defined laws\u201d (1963a: 128).\n\nOnkar Ghate (2019) and Harry Binswanger (2019) both defend this view. Ghate uses two scenarios involving individuals in a state of nature. Suppose you are by yourself on a desert island, and you domesticate a pig. Then someone from a neighboring tribe steals it. Do you have a right to retaliate by stealing some of his property, or stealing from his relatives? Again, suppose Robinson Crusoe and Friday are strangers sharing an island, and Crusoe invents a superior spear. Does Friday have a right to copy it? Ghate\u2019s main point is that because individuals in his scenarios don\u2019t have a government, they don\u2019t have objectively defined laws, and because they don\u2019t have objectively defined laws, the boundaries of their property rights are unclear. But Ghate does not explain why you, the pig owner, cannot talk to the tribe and come up with a mutually agreeable solution, or why Crusoe and Friday can\u2019t talk things over and decide on the boundaries of their rights vis-a-vis each other (if Crusoe has any common sense, he\u2019ll encourage Friday to copy his spear and propose that they cooperate in their future hunts). Of course the tribe and you might not be able to reach a resolution satisfactory to both of you. But that doesn\u2019t mean that it is in principle impossible to do so. Neither Rand nor Ghate (2019) provide an explanation of why a peaceful society of people without a government cannot come up with objective laws that define the boundaries of their rights \u2013 as, in fact, they do in Rand\u2019s Atlantis: Galt\u2019s Gulch. Their view seems to imply that if the Founding Fathers had been shipwrecked for 5 years on a desert island, they could not have come up with a Bill of Rights that defined the limits of their liberties vis-a-vis each other, or set up a fair system of adjudication in the event of a dispute. But we don\u2019t have to engage in hypotheticals. As many scholars have pointed out, starting in the 11th C, merchants from various countries created the body of law called the Law Merchant in order to protect foreign merchants not protected by the local laws (Benson 1989; see the entry on law merchant at libertarianism.org, linked from Other Internet Resources). The Law Merchant was uniform throughout Europe, and enforced by courts also created by merchants in European cities, without the involvement of any European government.\n\nRand argues that the only just social-political system, the only system compatible with our rational nature and with the right of individuals to live for their own sakes, is capitalism (1965, 1967b), that is,\n\nlaissez-faire capitalism\u2014with a separation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church. (1961b, 1964a)\n\nState regulation of the market, she argues, is responsible for corrupting both state and market institutions, just as political regulation of religion (or religious regulation of politics), wherever it exists, corrupts both state and religious institutions. Regulation creates the opportunity for the trading of favors between politicians and religious leaders, and politicians and businesses. Atlas Shrugged offers a complex and compelling depiction of the economic, political, and moral corruption spawned by \u201ccronyism\u201d between government and business. Laissez-faire capitalism is \u201cthe only [social] system that bans force from social relationships\u201d domestically and abroad, because the trader and the warrior are antagonists (Rand 1966a). Rand\u2019s conception of capitalism is, thus, more radical than the mainstream conception, and her defense of it significantly different both from the utilitarian defenses given by most economists, and the religious defenses given by many conservatives (for discussion, see Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1984b; Machan 1984). She does, of course, praise capitalism (or semi-capitalism) for creating widespread prosperity, but this feature is itself explained only by the fact that it leaves individuals free to produce in peace. In Atlas Shrugged, Rand distinguishes between the few business people who earn their money through honest effort, without seeking favors from the government, and the vast majority who are members of \u201cthe aristocracy of pull\u201d (\u201ccrony capitalists\u201d, in contemporary terminology) and get rich only through such favors, a situation that she thinks prevails, and has always prevailed, in the real world (Rand 1964c). She holds that for a short period in the nineteenth-century America came closer to a laissez-faire system than any other society before or since, but that capitalism remains an unknown ideal. Some critics complain, however, that in her non-fiction (1961c) Rand does not always recognize the aristocrats of pull in the real world\u2014business leaders who lobby politicians for subsidies for themselves and restrictions on their competitors (Rothbard 1968; Johnson 2006).\n\nRand rejects the criticism that unregulated, laissez-faire capitalism would lead to a concentration of power in a few hands and undermine people\u2019s ability to lead their own lives, because laissez-faire capitalism requires the rule of law, a well-defined system of property rights, freedom of contract, and, as a corollary, a government that abstains from all favoritism. In such a society, competition and opportunity will flourish, and prevent concentration of power in a few hands.\n\nRand holds that there is no conflict between one person\u2019s rational interests and another\u2019s, hence that there is no conflict between their rights (1962a, 1964a: 57\u201365). Is it true, however, that rational interests cannot conflict, or that, if they do, it follows that rights must also conflict? Our answer to both questions is \u2018no\u2019. We think that whenever two or more people have a rational interest in one good, there is potential for conflict, and sometimes that potential is actualized. To show otherwise, Rand considers a situation in which two people apply for the same job, and the better candidate gets the job. There is no conflict of interests here, she argues, because the better candidate has earned the job, and the loser cannot rationally wish to have been given the job. Both applicants also know that competition for jobs is a good thing, because the business would close if only one person applied for its jobs (presumably, because that would mean that the business wasn\u2019t doing very well).\n\nBoth points are well-taken. But what if the employer is not rational and gives the job to the somewhat less qualified applicant because, say, he reminds the employer of his long-lost brother? Or, what if the two candidates are equally qualified, and the hiring committee chooses one over the other by tossing a coin? In both cases there is a conflict of interests between two rational applicants. Rand raises the first possibility, that of the irrational employer, but doesn\u2019t trace its implications for her thesis that rational interests don\u2019t conflict. The second possibility, that of two equally qualified candidates, she does not consider at all. Rand would be on firmer ground if she were to argue that there is no necessary conflict between rational interests, that is, that it is not in their nature to conflict. When they conflict, it is due to contingent factors, such as only one job for two equally qualified people. In any case, a conflict between rational interests does not entail a conflict between rights, since, as Rand herself points out, neither party has a right to the job.\n\nRand defines government as:\n\nan institution that holds the exclusive power to enforce certain rules of social conduct in a given geographical area. (1963a: 125)\n\nA proper government is:\n\nthe means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control\u2014i.e., under objectively defined law. (1963b: 128)\n\nSuch a government is minimal, limited to protecting us from criminals and foreign aggressors, and enforcing individual rights and contracts with the help of the police and armed forces, using objectively defined civil and criminal laws and courts. Someone who violates his contracts, or engages in fraud, is guilty of the \u201cindirect\u201d use of force, in that he obtains a value from another without that person\u2019s consent (1963a: 111). Accordingly, the government may use or threaten force only in retaliation against those who initiate or threaten force directly or indirectly. A government that tries to enforce the brother\u2019s keeper principle\u2014\u201cfrom each according to his ability, to each according to his need\u201d; or that drafts citizens into the armed services or \u201cpublic service\u201d; or that forces them, directly or indirectly, to become more virtuous, well-mannered, healthy, or wealthy, violates rights. Statism in all its forms, from unlimited democracy to a mixed economy to dictatorship, is at odds with our status as independent, rational beings, as ends in ourselves. Statism also destroys ability and fails to fulfill anyone\u2019s needs for long, because \u201c[t]o deal with men by force is as impractical as to deal with nature by persuasion\u201d (1973a: 32). The fountainhead of all progress is the human mind, and the mind does not function well when forced.\n\nIn Atlas Shrugged Rand depicts her utopia, Galt\u2019s Gulch, as a \u201cvoluntary association of men held together by nothing but every man\u2019s self-interest\u201d, without any formal organization (1957 [1992]: 690). There is a judge to arbitrate disagreements, but there has never been any need for arbitration. Galt\u2019s Gulch is, thus, an anarchist society, although Rand never calls it that. In \u201cThe Nature of Government\u201d, however, Rand rejects anarchism as irrational and unworkable because, she says, it is incompatible with a single, objective system of law and, thus, with rights and peaceful cooperation (1963a; cf. 2018b). Anarchist critics, such as Roy Childs (1969 [1994]) and Murray Rothbard (1978), have argued that a territorial monopoly on law and force (government) is not necessary, because people can establish a just and effective legal system in a competitive market of security providers (see Long and Machan 2009). The Law Merchant, a body of law established and enforced in private courts by the merchants of various countries, illustrates the possibility of an effective voluntary legal system. Further, a government is incompatible with Rand\u2019s own principle of the non-initiation of force, a principle she regards as the linchpin of a moral society (Long 2013; cf. Cox 2013a and 2013b).\n\nThe trader principle states that a voluntary, mutually beneficial exchange between independent equals is the only basis for a mutually respectful and rational relationship (1961b: 31). It is also the only basis for a peaceful relationship among countries: \u201cthe trader and the warrior have been fundamental antagonists throughout history\u201d (1966a: 38).\n\nThe trader principle applies to emotional relationships as well. To love or admire someone is to \u201cpay\u201d him for the pleasure one derives from his virtues (1961b: 31)\u2014or, Rand might say in the case of love for a small child, from his personality. It would seem, however, that the trade between parent and child is unequal, given that the child receives both pleasure and material support from the parent. And it is unclear how the trader principle applies at all when a severe disability renders a beloved child or spouse a source of pain rather than pleasure.\n\n3.2 Feminism\n\nIf feminism is the view that women are, and ought to be recognized as, men\u2019s intellectual, moral, sexual, and political equals, then the Objectivist philosophy of human nature is inherently feminist, since it applies equally to all human beings, regardless of gender (or race) (N. Branden 1999). Decades before it was considered acceptable for women to lack \u201cmaternal instincts\u201d or pursue careers, Rand created heroines who lack the first and pursue the second, free of guilt or self-doubt.[11] Kira (We the Living) wants to be an engineer, and Dagny (Atlas Shrugged) runs Taggart Transcontinental, the largest and most successful transcontinental railroad in the country. None of Rand\u2019s heroines sacrifices her interests, intellect, or principles for the man or men in her life. One literary critic argues that Dagny is the first, and perhaps only, epic heroine in Western literature because of the grandness of her vision, her courage and integrity, her unusual abilities, and her national importance (Michalson 1999). Rand\u2019s depiction of her heroines\u2019 enjoyment of sex and their freedom from all merely conventional norms about sex anticipates the sexual liberation movement of the 20th century by at least 30 years. In all three novels, it is the heroine who has the power to choose which of the men who love, admire, and desire her (and only her) she will have. Rand was also an ardent champion of a woman\u2019s right to control her own reproductive choices (1968a, 1981).\n\nHer relationship to the feminist movement, however, was more complex. Although she praised Betty Friedan\u2019s The Feminine Mystique, mainstream feminism\u2019s collectivism and emphasis on women as victims later led her to reject feminism as such. Many theorists argue that Rand\u2019s work, especially Atlas Shrugged, upholds important feminist ideals, even as it succumbs to some anti-feminist tendencies that contradict her individualistic ethics (e.g., Gladstein 1978, 1999; B. Branden 1999; Presley 1999; Sheaffer 1999; Taylor 1999). Many others regard her and her work as plainly anti-feminist, with Susan Brownmiller even calling her \u201ca traitor to her own sex\u201d (Brownmiller 1975). One criticism takes aim at the individualism of Rand\u2019s ethics and politics, which rejects any special government help for women or discrimination against men (e.g., Harrison 1978). Another objects that Rand has internalized a masculine conception of human nature and virtue, and then created her ideal woman in light of this conception (Brownmiller 1975; Glennon 1979). This may be responsible for Rand\u2019s puzzling (and offensive) view that the essence of femininity is to hero-worship (not men, but) masculinity, while insisting (as her novels depict) that women and men are inherently equal and that the ideal romantic relationship is between moral and intellectual equals (1968b; cf. Brown 1999). At least as offensive to many are the violent sex scenes in her novels, especially the infamous scene in The Fountainhead that many regard as rape, where Howard Roark has sex with Dominique in spite of her resistance.\n\nThose who reject the charge of rape argue that in the 1940s and 50s, when Rand wrote her novels, it would have been seen as rough sex rather than non-consensual sex (McElroy 1999; Sheaffer 1999). That Rand herself thought of this scene as consensual is shown a few pages later, when she writes: \u201cThey had been united in an understanding beyond the violence, beyond the deliberate obscenity of his action\u201d (1943: 218). And in letters to disturbed readers in 1946 and 1965, Rand denied that the scene is \u201cactual rape\u201d which, she stated, is \u201ca dreadful crime\u201d, a \u201cvicious action and a violation of a woman\u2019s rights\u201d (Rand 1995a). On the other hand, she also depicts Dominique exultantly telling herself that she\u2019s been raped. McElroy wonders if having her heroine call it rape is just another instance of Rand\u2019s desire to provoke and shock the reader (McElroy 1999), as when she uses \u201cselfishness\u201d to mean \u201crational self-interest\u201d.\n\n4. Aesthetics\n\nRand holds that our actions need guidance by a vision of the fundamental nature of the universe and of the efficacy of human thought and activity\u2014a vision that can be grasped directly rather than requiring the conscious repetition of long chains of abstract reasoning. The chief function of art is to meet this psychological need by expressing abstract conceptual values and metaphysical truths in concrete perceptible form. Art, according to Rand, constitutes a selective, stylized re-creation of reality, with the principle of selection being the artist\u2019s \u201csense of life\u201d, a set of implicit \u201cmetaphysical value-judgments\u201d, i.e., judgments about what is fundamentally significant about the world and our place in it. (There is controversy among Rand scholars as to whether what is re-created in art is certain elements of reality or reality as a whole, i.e., a \u201cmicrocosm\u201d, as well as how and whether the concept of re-creation applies to apparently non-representational forms of art: Torres and Kamhi 2000; Bissell 2004.) Both the artist\u2019s creative work and the audience\u2019s emotional responses to it are driven by their senses of life, that is, the worldviews they have \u201cformed by a process of emotional generalization \u2026 a subconscious counterpart of a process of abstraction\u201d (1966b: 27). The role of art in sustaining us psychologically by providing a concretization of our most fundamental values is a frequent theme in Rand\u2019s fiction as well, especially The Fountainhead.[12]\n\nWhile art can be used to convey information or to advocate a position, such functions are secondary to its chief task: providing an object whose mere contemplation brings spiritual fulfillment. Hence Rand does not regard her own novels primarily as vehicles for her philosophy, though of course they are that inter alia. Given her own worldview, Rand favors literature with a strong plot as a way of expressing purposeful human action in a world of causal regularity, and stories involving value-conflicts as a way of expressing the importance of free choice; hence her preference for romantic (as opposed to, e.g., naturalistic) literature. But Rand holds that it is possible to evaluate an artwork\u2019s aesthetic value simply in terms of its success in conveying a concretization of the artist\u2019s sense of life, whether or not one shares the values and judgments so conveyed."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ayn-Rand", "page_content": "Top Questions Who was Ayn Rand? Ayn Rand was a Russian-born American author and philosopher. Rand authored two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged (1957). Her novels were especially influential among conservatives and libertarians from the mid-20th century. Where is Ayn Rand from? Ayn Rand was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, on February 2, 1905. When the tsarist regime was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, her family moved to Crimea, where she finished high school. She returned to Russia in 1921 and then moved to the United States in 1926. What is Ayn Rand\u2019s real name? Ayn Rand is the pen name of Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum. She adopted it when she moved to the United States in 1926. The first name, which rhymes with \u201cpine,\u201d was inspired by the name of a Finnish writer (whom she declined to identify), and the surname she described as an abbreviation of Rosenbaum. When did Ayn Rand begin writing? Ayn Rand arrived in Chicago in 1926 and then moved to Hollywood, where she met American filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille. Her chance encounter with DeMille led to work as a movie extra and eventually to a job as a screenwriter. Rand sold her first screenplay, Red Pawn, to Universal Studios in 1932. What are Ayn Rand\u2019s most famous works? Rand\u2019s first major work, The Fountainhead, was published in 1943. It details the struggle of a genius architect against mediocrity. Her second major work, Atlas Shrugged, was published in 1957. It follows a railroad executive and a steel magnate as they grapple with a collectivist government. Both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged explicate Rand\u2019s personal philosophy of objectivism. How did Ayn Rand die? Rand died of heart failure on March 6, 1982, in New York City. At the time, she had been working on a television adaptation of her novel Atlas Shrugged.\n\nAyn Rand, original name Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum, (born February 2, 1905, St. Petersburg, Russia\u2014died March 6, 1982, New York, New York, U.S.), Russian-born American writer whose commercially successful novels promoting individualism and laissez-faire capitalism were influential among conservatives and libertarians and popular among generations of young people in the United States from the mid-20th century.\n\nEarly life and career Her father, Zinovy Rosenbaum, was a prosperous pharmacist. After being tutored at home, Alissa Rosenbaum, the eldest of three children, was enrolled in a progressive school, where she excelled academically but was socially isolated. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, her father\u2019s shop was confiscated by communist authorities, an event she deeply resented. As a student at Leningrad State University, she studied history and became acquainted with the works of Plato and Aristotle. After graduating in 1924, she enrolled in the State Institute for Cinematography, hoping to become a screenwriter. The arrival of a letter from cousins in Chicago gave her an opportunity to leave the country on the pretext of gaining expertise that she could apply in the Soviet film industry. Upon her arrival in the United States in 1926, she changed her name to Ayn Rand. (The first name, which rhymes with \u201cpine,\u201d was inspired by the name of a Finnish writer, whom she never identified, and the surname she described as an abbreviation of Rosenbaum.) After six months in Chicago she moved to Hollywood, where a fortuitous encounter with the producer Cecil B. DeMille led to work as a movie extra and eventually to a job as a screenwriter. In 1929 she married the actor Frank O\u2019Connor. Soon hired as a filing clerk in the wardrobe department of RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., she rose to head of the department within a year, meanwhile writing stories, plays, and film scenarios in her spare time. She became an American citizen in 1931."}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/ayn-rand", "page_content": "(1905-1982)\n\nWho Was Ayn Rand?\n\nAyn Rand moved to the United States in 1926 and tried to establish herself in Hollywood. Her first novel, We the Living (1936), championed her rejection of collectivist values in favor of individual self interest, a belief that became more explicit with her subsequent novels The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged (1957). Following the immense success of the latter, Rand promoted her philosophy of Objectivism through courses, lectures and literature.\n\nEarly Years\n\nAyn Rand was born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum on February 2, 1905, in St. Petersburg, Russia. The oldest daughter of Jewish parents (and eventually an avowed atheist), she spent her early years in comfort thanks to her dad's success as a pharmacist, proving a brilliant student.\n\nIn 1917, her father's shop was suddenly seized by Bolshevik soldiers, forcing the family to resume life in poverty in the Crimea. The situation profoundly impacted young Alissa, who developed strong feelings toward government intrusion into individual livelihood. She returned to her city of birth to attend the University of Petrograd, graduating in 1924, and then enrolled at the State Institute for Cinema Arts to study screenwriting.\n\nGranted a visa to visit relatives in Chicago, Alissa left for the United States in early 1926, never to look back. She took on her soon-to-be-famous pen name and, after a few months in Chicago, moved to Hollywood to become a screenwriter.\n\nEarly Writing Career\n\nFollowing a chance encounter with Hollywood titan Cecil B. DeMille, Rand became an extra on the set of his 1927 film The King of Kings, where she met actor Frank O'Connor. They married in 1929, and she became an American citizen in 1931.\n\nRand landed a job as a clerk at RKO Pictures, eventually rising to head of the wardrobe department, and continued developing her craft as a writer. In 1932, she sold her screenplay Red Pawn, a Soviet romantic thriller, to Universal Studios. She soon completed a courtroom drama called Penthouse Legend, which featured the gimmick of audience members serving as the jury. In late 1934, Rand and her husband moved to New York City for its production, now renamed Night of January 16th.\n\nAround this time, Rand also completed her first novel, We the Living. Published in 1936 after several rejections, We the Living championed the moral authority of the individual through its heroine's battles with a Soviet totalitarian state. Rand followed with the novella Anthem (1938), about a future collectivist dystopia in which \"I\" has been stamped out of the language.\n\n'The Fountainhead' and 'Atlas Shrugged'\n\nIn 1937, Rand began researching a new novel by working for New York architect Ely Jacques Kahn. The result, after years of writing and more rejections, was The Fountainhead. Underscoring Rand\u2019s individualistic underpinnings, the book\u2019s hero, architect Howard Roark, refuses to adhere to conventions, going so far as to blowing up one of his own creations. While not an immediate success, The Fountainhead eventually achieved strong sales, and at the end of the decade became a feature film, with Gary Cooper in the role of Roark.\n\nRand's ideas became even more explicit with the 1957 publication of Atlas Shrugged. A massive work of more than 1,000 pages, Atlas Shrugged portrays a future in which leading industrialists drop out of a collectivist society that exploits their talents, culminating with a notoriously lengthy speech by protagonist John Galt. The novel drew some harsh reviews, but became an immediate best seller.\n\nObjectivism and Later Years\n\nAround 1950, Rand met with a college student named Nathan Blumenthal, who changed his name to Nathaniel Branden and became the author's designated heir. Along with his wife, Barbara, Braden formed a group that met at Rand's apartment to engage in intellectual discussions. The group, which included future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, called itself the Collective, or the Class of '43 (the publication year of The Fountainhead).\n\nRand soon honed her philosophy of what she termed \"Objectivism\": a belief in a concrete reality, from which individuals can discern existing truths, and the ultimate moral value of the pursuit of self interest. The development of this system essentially ended her career as a novelist: In 1958, the Nathaniel Branden Institute formed to spread her message through lectures, courses and literature, and in 1962, the author and her top disciple launched The Objectivist Newsletter. Her books during this period, including For the New Intellectual (1961) and Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal (1966), were primarily comprised of previously published essays and other works.\n\nFollowing a public split with Braden, the author published The Romantic Manifesto (1969), a series of essays on the cultural importance of art, and repackaged her newsletter as The Ayn Rand Letter. She continued traveling to give lectures, though she was slowed by an operation for lung cancer. In 1979, she published a collection of articles in Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, which included an essay from prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Leonard Peikoff.\n\nDeath and Legacy\n\nRand was working on a television adaptation of Atlas Shrugged when she died of heart failure at her home in New York City on March 6, 1982.\n\nAlthough she weathered criticism for her perceived literary shortcomings and philosophical arguments, Rand undeniably left her mark on the Western culture she embraced. In 1985, Peikoff founded the Ayn Rand Institute to continue her teachings. The following year, Braden's ex-wife, Barbara, published a tell-all memoir, The Passion of Ayn Rand, which later was made into a movie starring Helen Mirren.\n\nInterest in Rand's works resurfaced alongside the rise of the Tea Party movement during President Barack Obama's administration, with leading political proponents like Rand Paul and Ted Cruz proclaiming their admiration for the author. In 2010, the Ayn Rand Institute announced that more than 500,000 copies of Atlas Shrugged had been sold the previous year.\n\nIn 2017, Tony-winning director Ivo van Hove reintroduced The Fountainhead to the American public with a production at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Having originated at Toneelgroep Amsterdam in the Netherlands, van Hove's version featured his performers speaking in Dutch, with their words projected onto a screen in English.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nBirth Year: 1905\n\nBirth date: February 2, 1905\n\nBirth City: St. Petersburg\n\nBirth Country: Russia\n\nGender: Female\n\nBest Known For: Author Ayn Rand wrote the best-selling books 'The Fountainhead' and 'Atlas Shrugged,' and promoted the philosophy of Objectivism.\n\nIndustries\n\nWriting and Publishing\n\n\n\nFilm\n\nAstrological Sign: Aquarius\n\nSchools\n\nUniversity of Petrograd\n\n\n\nState Institute For Cinema Arts\n\nDeath Year: 1982\n\nDeath date: March 6, 1982\n\nDeath State: New York\n\nDeath City: New York\n\nDeath Country: United States\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: Ayn Rand Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/ayn-rand\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E; Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: November 16, 2021\n\nOriginal Published Date: April 2, 2014\n\nQUOTES"}, {"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/Archives/Win2017/entries/ayn-rand/index.html", "page_content": "First published Tue Jun 8, 2010; substantive revision Mon Sep 19, 2016\n\nAyn Rand (1905\u20131982) was a novelist-philosopher who outlined a comprehensive philosophy, including an epistemology and a theory of art, in her novels and essays. Early in her career she also wrote short stories, plays, and screenplays. Rand\u2019s first and most autobiographical novel, We the Living (1936), set in the Soviet Union, was published only after many rejections, owing to widespread sympathy for the Soviet \u201cexperiment\u201d among the intellectuals of the day. We the Living was quickly followed by the dystopian novel, Anthem (1938), written as \u201ca kind of rest\u201d from work on her next major novel, The Fountainhead (1943). The Fountainhead, also published after many rejections because of its individualism, and largely panned by critics, soon became a best-seller by word of mouth. The Fountainhead brought Rand international fame, and Atlas Shrugged (1957) sealed this fame. By 1958, Rand\u2019s novels, increasingly philosophical, had won her ideas a sufficiently devoted following for her to form, in association with psychologist Nathaniel Branden (with whom she later broke), an official \u201cObjectivist\u201d philosophical movement, complete with journals and lecture courses. For all her popularity, however, only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously. As a result, most of the serious philosophical work on Rand has appeared in non-academic, non-peer-reviewed journals, or in books, and the bibliography reflects this fact. We discuss the main reasons for her rejection by most professional philosophers in the first section. Our discussion of Rand\u2019s philosophical views, especially her moral-political views, draws from both her non-fiction and her fiction, since her views cannot be accurately interpreted or evaluated without doing so.\n\n1. Introduction\n\n1.1 Ayn Rand and Philosophy\n\nIn Rand\u2019s own words, her first and greatest love, her \u201clife purpose\u201d, was \u201cthe creation of the kind of world \u2026 that represents human perfection\u201d, while her interest in philosophical knowledge was \u201conly\u201d for the sake of this purpose (Journal entry for 4 May 1946; in 1997: 479).[1] Nevertheless, her interest in philosophical knowledge continued long after she had created this world in her magnum opus, Atlas Shrugged, her last work of fiction. In her non-fiction, Rand developed a conception of metaphysical realism, rationality, ethical egoism (rational self-interest), individual rights, laissez-faire capitalism, and art, and applied her philosophy to social issues. She wrote polemical, philosophical essays, often in response to questions by fans of Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead; lectured on college campuses; and gave radio and television interviews. In her own words, her philosophy,\n\nin essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute. (Rand 1957 [1992]: Afterword)\n\nCapitalism, \u201cthe unknown ideal\u201d, is for her the only political-economic system compatible with this philosophy because it is the only system based on respect for human beings as ends in themselves. The free-market libertarian political movement, though largely disowned by Rand, drew\u2014and draws\u2014great inspiration from her moral defense of the minimal state, that is, the state whose only raison d\u2019\u00eatre is protection of individual rights.\n\nWhereas Rand\u2019s ideas and mode of presentation make Rand popular with many non-academics, they lead to the opposite outcome with academics. She developed some of her views in response to questions from her readers, but never took the time to defend them against possible objections or to reconcile them with the views expressed in her novels. Her philosophical essays lack the self-critical, detailed style of analytic philosophy, or any serious attempt to consider possible objections to her views. Her polemical style, often contemptuous tone, and the dogmatism and cult-like behavior of many of her fans also suggest that her work is not worth taking seriously.[2] Further, understanding her views requires reading her fiction, but her fiction is not to everyone\u2019s taste. It does not help that she often dismisses other philosophers\u2019 views on the basis of cursory readings and conversations with a few philosophers and with her young philosophy student acolytes. Some contemporary philosophers return the compliment by dismissing her work contemptuously on the basis of hearsay. Some who do read her work point out that her arguments too often do not support her conclusions. This estimate is shared even by many who find her conclusions and her criticisms of contemporary culture, morality, and politics original and insightful. It is not surprising, then, that she is either mentioned in passing, or not mentioned at all, in the entries that discuss current philosophical thought about virtue ethics, egoism, rights, libertarianism, or markets. (Readers may also find the entry on Nozick\u2019s political philosophy to be of interest.) We present specific criticisms of her arguments and claims below, in the relevant sections of this entry.\n\n1.2 Life and Work\n\nAyn Rand was born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum, to a bourgeois Jewish family in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 2 February 1905. A witness to the Russian Revolution and civil war, Rand opposed both the Communists and the Tsarists. She majored in history, but the social science program in which she was enrolled at Petrograd State University included philosophy, law, and philology. Her teachers emphasized\u2014as she herself later did\u2014the importance of developing systematic connections among different areas of thought (Sciabarra 1995). Rand\u2019s formal philosophical education included ancient philosophy (especially Plato and Aristotle), logic, philosophical psychology, Marxism-Leninism, and non-Marxist political thought. But she was evidently also exposed to Hegelian and Nietzschean ideas, which blossomed during this period (known as the Russian Silver Age), and read a great deal of Friedrich Nietzsche on her own. After graduating from Petrograd State University in 1924, an interest in screenwriting led her to enroll in the State Institute for Cinematography. On the literary side, she studied the great Russian novelists and poets, but fell in love with Victor Hugo, to whose influence she owes the \u201cRomantic Realism\u201d of her novels.\n\nIn 1925 Rand succeeded in obtaining permission to visit relatives in the United States; hating the Soviet system, she left with no intention of returning. After six months with relatives in Chicago, she made her way to Hollywood where, on her second day, a fortuitous encounter with Cecil B. DeMille led to a job as a script reader, and later as a screenplay writer. The next week she had another fortuitous encounter, this time with the actor Frank O\u2019Connor, whom she married in 1929. She was married to him till his death in 1979. She adopted the pen name Ayn Rand to (it is thought) protect her family back in Russia, although she also told the New York Evening Post in 1936 that \u201cRand\u201d was an abbreviation of her Russian surname.\n\nRand and her husband moved permanently to New York City in 1951, where she became involved with, and was influenced by, the circle of mostly New-York-based intellectuals involved in the revival of classical liberalism, such as the economic journalist Henry Hazlitt, the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, and the Canadian-American novelist, literary critic, and political philosopher Isabel Paterson. Rand also studied, and was a great admirer of, the Lockean philosophy of the American founding. Rand lived and worked in New York City until her death in 1982.\n\nRand holds that philosophy, like all forms of knowledge and achievement, is important only because it is necessary for living a good human life and creating a world conducive to living such a life. Philosophy supplies the most fundamental cognitive and normative abstractions which, respectively, identify and evaluate what is. Everyone, according to Rand, needs a philosophy and is guided by at least an implicit one (1982a: ch. 1). Her novels express her belief that if our philosophy is more or less correct, our lives will be more or less successful, if our philosophy is wildly off the mark, our lives will be disastrous. Philosophy thus has an urgent, practical importance. But unlike Marx, her philosophical and political antipode, Rand thinks that social change has to start with a moral revolution within each individual and the spread of the right ideas and ideals through rational discourse and the inspiration of art.\n\nRand\u2019s ideal human being appears, in varying degrees of development, in all her novels; her ideal world appears in Atlas Shrugged. Her novels feature striking, complex plots with subtle psychological explorations of her characters\u2019 emotions and thoughts, and philosophical reflections that rarely lose sight of the dramatic context. Like many famous Russian novelists, especially Dostoevsky, whom she recognized as a great psychologist, Rand also uses long speeches to lay out her philosophy, a device that has both its supporters and its detractors. She described Atlas Shrugged as a \u201cstunt novel\u201d and a murder mystery\u2014the murder of the human soul by a collectivist culture. By \u201csoul\u201d, however, she meant not an immortal substance that survives the death of the body\u2014she is not a dualist in any aspect of her philosophy\u2014but the mind, or the human spirit that celebrates life on this earth. She took a familiar phenomenon and literary trope\u2014a workers\u2019 strike\u2014and turned it on its head to show what happens when \u201cthe men of mind\u201d\u2014scientists, philosophers, industrialists, entrepreneurs, writers\u2014the \u201cprime movers\u201d of a society\u2014go on strike. It also purports to show how the wrong metaphysics can lead to the wrong ethics and thus to disastrous personal choices and a disastrous political and economic system, and how the right philosophy is needed for the rebirth of the soul and the rebuilding of the world. Her protagonists are not knights on white steeds rescuing damsels in distress, or swordsmen who can fight off a dozen enemies single-handed, but men and women in the mid-20th century industrial America of steel mills, skyscrapers, and glimmering highways: women who run transcontinental railroads and men who revolutionize architecture or (long before clean energy became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre) build a motor powered by static electricity to produce limitless, clean energy. Her novels show the importance of striving to be the best we can be:\n\nDo not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but never have been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible\u2026. (Atlas Shrugged, 1957 [1992]: 983).\n\nHer novels inspire readers because they present heroes of unbreached integrity, heroes who lead colorful and remarkable lives and succeed not in spite of, but because of, their uncompromising virtue. This estimate of their virtue is not, of course, shared by all: many readers find her characters wooden, her writing stilted, and her ethical and political views misguided.\n\nRand paid tribute to Aristotle, whom she considered the greatest of all philosophers, in the titles she gave to the three Parts of Atlas Shrugged (Non-Contradiction, Either-Or, A is A) and to one of the chapters (The Immovable Movers). While she differed sharply from Nietzsche on many issues, including rationality, free will, and individual rights, his influence is evident in her provocative, often aphoristic, point-counterpoint writing style, as well as in her \u201ctransvaluation\u201d of traditional values and her powerful affirmation of life and joy and the spirit of youth. In the Introduction to the 25th Anniversary edition of The Fountainhead, she stated that the novel\u2019s sense of life is best conveyed by a quotation from Nietzsche\u2019s Beyond Good and Evil: \u201cThe noble soul has reverence for itself\u201d. (For The Fountainhead\u2019s partly sympathetic and partly critical engagement with Nietzsche\u2019s ideas, see Hunt 2006.)\n\n1.3 Metaphysics and Epistemology\n\nFundamental to Rand\u2019s outlook\u2014so fundamental that she derives the name of her philosophical system, \u201cObjectivism\u201d, from it\u2014is a trichotomy among three categories: the intrinsic, the subjective, and the objective (ITOE: 52\u201354; Rand 1965: 13\u201323). An intrinsic phenomenon is one whose nature depends wholly on factors external to the mind; a subjective phenomenon is one whose nature depends wholly on the mind; and an objective phenomenon is defined, variously, as that which depends on the relation between a living entity\u2019s nature (including the nature of its mind) and its environment, or as that which depends on the relation between a properly functioning (rational) mind and extramental reality. Commentators are divided over the best way to interpret Rand\u2019s views on this issue.\n\nRand holds that there is a widespread tendency to ignore the third category or to assimilate it to the second, thus setting up a false dichotomy between the intrinsic and the subjective. On Rand\u2019s view, many of the fundamental questions of philosophy, from the existence of universals to the nature of value, involve fruitless debates over the false alternative \u201cintrinsic or subjective?\u201d in cases where the phenomenon in question is neither intrinsic nor subjective, but rather objective.\n\nIf ethics is the branch of philosophy concerned with practice, then in a sense all of Rand\u2019s philosophy is ethics, for Rand stresses \u201cthe supremacy of actual living over all other considerations\u201d, and insists that philosophy needs to be \u201cbrought up to the realm of actual living\u201d\u2014adding \u201cI say intentionally brought up to it, not down\u201d (Journal entry for 15 May 1934, p. 72; in Rand 1997: 73). Consequently, Rand regularly concerns herself with the practical implications and social relevance not only of moral and political philosophy, but likewise of the seemingly more arcane strata of metaphysics and epistemology\u2014as when she identifies errors in concept-formation as one of the roots of racism, or mind-body dualism as a root of the dichotomy between economic and personal freedom. This approach likewise reflects Rand\u2019s emphasis on integrating each piece of information into the total context of one\u2019s knowledge, and her consequent hostility to compartmentalization.\n\nRand\u2019s conviction of the vital practical importance of abstract theory may help to explain the passionately polemical nature of her philosophical writing, which some readers find inspiring and others hyperbolic and off-putting\u2014though Rand\u2019s admiration for Nietzsche, as well as her having been educated in a Marxist-Leninist atmosphere, may also play a role. Rand also tended\u2014perhaps owing in part to the same two influences\u2014to regard philosophical errors as revelatory of the psychological flaws of their authors.\n\nFor a more in-depth presentation of Rand\u2019s views on epistemology and metaphysics, please see the supplement on Epistemology and Metaphysics\n\n2. Ethics\n\n2.1 What is Ethics, and Why do we need It?\n\nEthics\n\nis a code of values to guide man\u2019s choices and actions\u2014the choices and actions that determine the purpose and the course of his life. (1961b: 13)\n\nBefore we can decide which code of values we should accept, we need to ask why we need a code of values at all. Rand claims that no philosopher before her has provided a scientific answer to this question, and so none has provided a satisfactory ethics.\n\nRand starts by describing value or \u201cthe good\u201d, in classical fashion, as the object of pursuit: \u201cthat which one acts to gain and/or keep\u201d (1961b: 16). Thus, the concept of value presupposes the concept of \u201can entity capable of acting to achieve a goal in the face of an alternative\u201d\u2014and the basic alternative facing any living entity is life or death (1961b: 16). It is the conditional nature of life that gives rise to values, not just human values, but values as such. As she puts it:\n\nMetaphysically, life is the only phenomenon that is an end in itself: a value gained and kept by a constant process of action. (1961b: 18)\n\nSurvival is the organism\u2019s ultimate value, the \u201cfinal goal or end to which all [its] lesser goals are the means\u201d, and the standard of all its other values: \u201cthat which furthers its life is the good, that which threatens it is the evil\u201d (pp. 16\u201317). The same, suitably modified, applies to human beings. Life is the standard and goal of all genuine human values, in the sense that all of them\u2014from food to philosophy to fine art to ethics\u2014must be explained and justified as requirements of human survival. \u201cEthics is an objective, metaphysical necessity of man\u2019s survival\u201d (p. 24). Thus,\n\n[t]he standard of value of the Objectivist ethics \u2026 is man\u2019s life, or: that which is required for man\u2019s survival qua man, (1961b: 25)\n\nthat is,\n\nthe terms, methods, conditions and goals required for the survival of a rational being through the whole of his lifespan\u2014in all those aspects of existence which are open to his choice. (1961b: 27)\n\nTo choose to live is to accept one\u2019s \u201cown life\u201d as one\u2019s \u201cethical purpose\u201d.\n\nRand\u2019s metaphysical arguments make two points central to her axiology and ethics. (1) Values are not just a human phenomenon but a phenomenon of life: life necessitates value. Thus, values are neither intrinsic properties of things, nor subjective, neither free-floating Platonic entities, nor mere matters of desire or preference, culture or time. Rather, values are relational or objective, dependent on the nature of the valuing entity and the nature of its environment. (2) An entity\u2019s values are determined by the requirements of survival for entities of its kind, and ethics is a requirement of human survival.\n\nRand seeks to bolster this claim by arguing that the concept of value entails the concept of life:\n\nepistemologically, the concept of \u201cvalue\u201d is genetically dependent upon and derived from the antecedent concept of \u201clife\u201d. (1961b: 18)\n\nShe supports it by asking us\n\nto imagine an immortal, indestructible robot, an entity which moves and acts, but which cannot be affected by anything, which cannot be changed in any respect, which cannot be damaged, injured or destroyed. (1961b: 16)\n\nSuch an entity, she concludes, cannot have values.\n\nCritics raise two objections to this argument. (i) It begs the question by assuming what is at issue, namely, that a non-living entity cannot be harmed (Nozick 1971). Unlike the robot of this example, real robots can be damaged or destroyed, not only by external events, but also by a failure to perform their functions well, that is, by their own actions or inactions. Hence they can, quite straightforwardly, be said to have values.[3] (ii) Even if one were to accept that the concept of value entails the concept of life, one could consistently regard one\u2019s survival as a means to a certain kind of life: a life of dedication to the greater glory of God, the common good, the environment, and so on (Mack 1984).\n\nRand\u2019s naturalism, and her rejection of intrinsicism and subjectivism in favor of objectivism, anticipate recent naturalisms and echo Aristotle\u2019s argument, against both the Platonist and the subjectivist, that \u201cthe good\u201d must always be good-for-something. Her conception of the function of morality is notable both for its affinity to, and its difference from, Thomas Hobbes\u2019 conception: like Hobbes, Rand sees morality as a necessary means to long-term survival, but unlike Hobbes, she does not see morality as requiring a contract or even as a fundamentally social affair. The need for morality, according to Rand, is dictated by our nature as creatures that must think and produce to survive; hence we would need morality even on a desert island. There is, however, no duty to survive; morality is based on a hypothetical imperative: if you choose to live, then you must value your own long-term survival as an ultimate end, and morality as a necessary means to it. (The much-debated question of whether the choice to live is a moral choice (Mack 1984, 2003; Long 2000; Rasmussen 2002, 2006) or a pre-moral one (Peikoff 1991; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000, 2006), and the implications of either position for the objectivity of Rand\u2019s Objectivist ethics must, unfortunately, be left undiscussed.) If asked why the choice to live commits you to your own long-term survival rather than some other ultimate end (such as, for example, the greatest happiness of the greatest number (Nozick 1971), or becoming worthy of eternal life in heaven), the answer is: because any other ultimate end, if consistently adhered to, would lead to death.\n\nRand\u2019s ethics is thus firmly teleological, this-worldly, and foundationalist. Virtue is \u201cthe act by which one gains/and or keeps\u201d values in light of a recognition of certain facts (1961b: 27, 28); it \u201cis not an end in itself \u2026 not its own reward\u201d (1957 [1992]: 939). A fact central to a \u201cscientific\u201d ethics is that reason is the chief indispensable human tool of survival, and we exercise reason by choice. Hence rationality is the fundamental moral virtue, a virtue implicated in all the other virtues, including productiveness (Section 2.4 below).\n\nRand is widely credited by Objectivists (Peikoff 1991; Binswanger 1990, 1992; Kelley & Thomas 1999\u2014see Other Internet Resources; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000, 2006) with having solved the is-ought problem by showing that morality is essential for long-term survival as a rational being, and so anyone who chooses to live ought to be moral (1961b: 19). But if the choice to live is itself a moral choice, in the sense that we ought to choose to live, then the argument proceeds from an ought to an ought, not from an is to an ought. On the other hand, if the choice to live is a non-moral choice (an idea that\u2019s hard to reconcile with Rand\u2019s general view that all significant choices are moral choices), then suicide can never be wrong, even if it is done for cowardly, irresponsible, or unjust reasons, a view that seems incoherent (King 1984 and Narveson 1998 criticize this and other aspects of Rand\u2019s moral views). Even more problematically, if morality is needed only for long-term survival, and choosing suicide is not immoral, then a suicide-bomber does no wrong in killing innocent people.\n\nRelatedly, how should we understand the idea of survival as a rational being\u2014the life \u201cproper to a rational being\u201d (Rand 1961b: 27). Is a life proper to a rational being a necessary means, and only a necessary means, to literal, long-term survival? Or is such a life also, in part, the ultimate goal, something to be created and preserved for its own sake? Again, what are we to make of the many passages in which Rand states that the ultimate goal is one\u2019s own happiness?\n\nRand herself thought that she had only one, consistent metaethical view: the ultimate goal is the individual\u2019s own survival; the only way to survive long-term, i.e., over a complete life-span, is to live by the standard of man\u2019s life as a rational being, which means: to live morally; and happiness is the psychological \u201cresult, reward and concomitant\u201d (p. 32) of living thus. Many of Rand\u2019s commentators follow her in holding that there is only one consistent view, while disagreeing on the right interpretation of it (Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1978; Machan 1984, 2000; Peikoff 1991; Bidinotto 1994\u2014see Other Internet Resources; Hunt 1999; Kelley & Thomas 1999\u2014see Other Internet Resources; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000, 2006). Others (Mack 1984, 2003; Badhwar 1999, 2001; Long 2000) argue that Rand\u2019s writings actually allow of two, if not three, mutually incompatible views of the ultimate goal, and our task is to see which of these is the dominant or most plausible view. The three views are: survival, survival qua rational being, and happiness in the ancient Aristotelian sense of flourishing or eudaimonia. In the rest of Section 2, we will present the textual evidence for each of these views of the final goal, and the common objections to them, in turn.\n\n2.2 Survival as the Ultimate Value\n\nThe survivalist view holds that just as literal survival is the ultimate value for other living entities, so it is for human beings (Kelley & Thomas 1999; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000). Survival is the source and final goal of all the actions of an entity, that which gives point to all its other values. For human beings, happiness, intellectual and artistic pursuits and rationality/morality are all means to survival. The vicious can \u201cachieve their goals [only] for the range of a moment\u201d, as evidenced by \u201cany criminal or any dictatorship\u201d (1961b: 26). Even those whose vice consists of imitating others rather than looting them live a precarious existence because they are likely to follow any destroyer who promises to be their savior (1961b: 25).\n\n\u201cNon-survivalists\u201d make the following objections:\n\nThe biological premise that survival is the ultimate goal of all living things is mistaken. Animals of many species risk their own death for the sake of reproduction, or for protecting their young or even their group. But even if survival were the ultimate goal of other species, it need not be ours. Even if our own survival needs were the source of all our values, it would not follow that survival must be the ultimate psychological and moral goal to which all our other values are merely necessary means. The genesis of x does not logically determine the ultimate goal of x. For example, the source of sexual desire is our reproductive capacity but, as Rand would agree, it doesn\u2019t follow that we ought to satisfy our sexual desires only if we want to reproduce. The survivalist view that turns happiness into a mere means to survival entails, quite implausibly, that a long, unhappy life is better than a somewhat shorter but happy life, and just as good as a long and happy one. Many dictators, including the Pharaohs of the past and the Stalins and Maos of the 20th century, have survived by making elaborate plans to preserve their lives and their power by using a combination of terror, myth, and bribery. So have many common criminals. So even if morality enhances our chances of survival, it cannot be necessary for survival. Under some circumstances, such as in a dictatorial system, acting morally decreases our chances of survival, a point that Rand herself convincingly dramatizes in We the Living and Anthem. A survivalist ethics can support, at best, a bare-bones Hobbesian morality, not a virtue ethics. If Rand\u2019s virtues were necessary for survival, the human species would have perished a long time ago, instead of expanding exponentially. Her rich and challenging picture of human life and virtue in her novels points to a richer and more challenging conception of the final end than mere survival. Many of Rand\u2019s heroes, from Kira (We the Living) to Prometheus (Anthem) to John Galt (Atlas Shrugged), risk their lives for the sake of the values that make their lives worth living. Like Hobbes, Rand rightly points out that if everyone or most people were to start preying on each other, then no one would survive for long\u2014literally, and that generations of predators would end up destroying or driving away the producers, and thus destroying themselves (Anthem and Atlas Shrugged). But this doesn\u2019t show that a few predators in a society of producers cannot survive by predation. Indeed, Rand herself sometimes acknowledges that evil people can survive by free-riding (\u201chitch-hiking\u201d, as she calls it) on rational, productive people: If some men attempt to survive by means of brute force or fraud \u2026 it still remains true that their survival is made possible only by their victims, only by the men who choose to think and to produce the goods which they, the looters, are seizing. (1961b: 25) Rand often says that the final end is survival proper to a human being (1961b: 26), or that the final end is happiness (1961b: 27, 30). Neither can be reduced to survival. In \u201cMan\u2019s Rights\u201d, Rand explains an individual\u2019s right to his own life as the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life. (1963b: 93 and 1967a: 321\u201322) \u201cLife\u201d here is explicated in terms of not only continued survival but also the enjoyment proper to a human being.\n\nFor all these reasons, a more plausible interpretation of Rand\u2019s view is that morality is required for surviving qua human being, that is, for living a life proper to a human being.\n\n2.3 Survival Qua Man as the Ultimate Value\n\nJust as the standard of value is survival qua human being, so the ultimate goal is one\u2019s own survival qua human being. To accept this standard and goal is to accept (i) the three cardinal values of reason, purpose (or purposiveness) and self-esteem as not only \u201cthe means to\u201d but also \u201cthe realization of one\u2019s ultimate value, one\u2019s own life\u201d (1961b: 27), and (ii) the three \u201ccorresponding virtues\u201d of rationality, productiveness, and pride. These values are means to one\u2019s life insofar as they further one\u2019s life as a rational being, and they realize it insofar as they express the value we place on our lives.\n\nWhat it means to value survival qua human being turns on the relationship of the three cardinal values to the three virtues. Rand often states that virtue is only a means to value. But when she explains how the three cardinal values \u201ccorrespond\u201d to their three virtues, she does not provide a means-end analysis (Badhwar 1999, 2001). Thus, she says:\n\nProductive work is the central purpose of a rational man\u2019s life, the central value that integrates and determines the hierarchy of all his other values. Reason is the source, the precondition of his productive work\u2014pride is the result. (1961b: 27)\n\nThe virtue of productiveness becomes the central example of purpose (one of the three cardinal values), reason (another cardinal value) becomes its source, and the virtue of pride becomes its result. Rand also defines rationality, which is \u201cthe basic virtue\u201d, in terms of\n\nthe recognition and acceptance of reason as one\u2019s only source of knowledge \u2026 and one\u2019s only guide to action. (1961b: 28)\n\nBy this definition, being rational means valuing reason in thought, word, and deed, and realizing reason in one\u2019s life means being rational: the virtue and the value entail each other.\n\nThis point generalizes to all the virtues and values. Further, since the (cardinal) values are both \u201cthe means to\u201d and \u201cthe realization of one\u2019s ultimate value\u201d (1961b: 27), it follows that the (cardinal) virtues are also both the means to and the realization of one\u2019s ultimate value: long-term survival qua human being. On this interpretation, to survive qua human being is none other than to lead a virtuous life in which one has realized one\u2019s potential.\n\nBoth survivalists and eudaimonists, however, point out that this conception of the final end contradicts Rand\u2019s oft-repeated claim that \u201cVirtue is not an end in itself.\u2026\u201d In addition, eudaimonists make the following objections:\n\nSince even a long, virtuous life need not be a happy one, positing it as the final end contradicts Rand\u2019s related claim that \u201cLife is the reward of virtue\u2014and happiness is the goal and reward of life\u201d (1957 [1992]: 939). It contradicts Rand\u2019s conception of the final end in her novels, where happiness is proclaimed as \u201cthe purpose, the sanction and the meaning of life\u201d (1957 [1992]: 674).\n\nEudaimonists hold that the dominant and/or more plausible view expressed in Rand\u2019s writings is that happiness\u2014a happy life\u2014is the ultimate value, where a happy life is understood as a life of emotional fulfillment in worthwhile goals and activities. Happiness in this sense necessarily involves virtue, but is not identical with virtue (Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1978; Machan 1984, 2000; Mack 1984; Badhwar 1999, 2001; Hunt 1999; Long 2000).[4]\n\n2.4 Happiness as the Ultimate Value\n\nHappiness is the existentially and psychologically \u201csuccessful state of life\u201d (1961b: 27). As an emotion it is not simply a positive subjective state, as on some contemporary views, but an emotion that meets certain normative standards: \u201ca state of non-contradictory joy\u2014a joy without penalty or guilt\u201d, achievable only by\n\nthe man who desires nothing but rational goals, seeks nothing but rational values and finds his joy in nothing but rational actions. (1961b: 32)\n\nHappiness is also a form of life-affirmation:\n\nthe feeling of one\u2019s blessing upon the whole of the earth, the feeling of being in love with the fact that one exists and in this kind of world. (1957 [1992]: 105\u20136)\n\nThus, happiness is an objectively worthwhile and emotionally positive state of life.\n\nRand holds that the pursuit of happiness is inseparable from the activity of maintaining one\u2019s life through the rational pursuit of rational goals (1961b: 29, 32). A virtuous life is, thus, essential to happiness. It is also a shield against soul-wracking unhappiness. Just as even great misfortunes don\u2019t throw Aristotle\u2019s virtuous individual into misery, they don\u2019t throw Rand\u2019s heroes into misery. Even at the worst of times, the virtuous individual\u2019s pain \u201conly goes down to a certain point\u201d (1943: 344), never touching the core of her being: the self-esteem that consists of the conviction that she is worthy and capable of happiness.[5]\n\nIn keeping with their richer conception of the final end, Rand\u2019s novels also employ a richer conception of virtue as an integrated intellectual-emotional character trait to think, feel, and act in certain ways, rather than simply as an act in light of a recognition of certain facts (Badhwar 1999, 2001). Her characters reveal their souls not only in what they say or do, notice or fail to notice, focus on or evade, on this or that occasion, but in their cognitive, emotional, and action dispositions, their style of being in the world. Their actions show not only an intellectual commitment to the right but a wholehearted \u201clove of rectitude\u201d (1957 [1992]: 512).\n\nThis basically Aristotelian view of virtue goes hand-in-hand with a basically Aristotelian view of emotions. Rand rejects the reason-emotion dichotomy as stemming, ultimately, from a false mind-body dichotomy. Emotions are neither raw feelings nor inherently irrational but automatized value-judgments:\n\nestimates of that which furthers man\u2019s values or threatens them \u2026 lightning calculators giving him the sum of his profit or loss. (1961b: 27)\n\nEmotions provide instant guidance when circumstances do not permit reasoning everything out anew. But our emotions are only as good as our reason, because they are \u201cprogrammed\u201d by our reason. Hence they can only be corrected by conscious reasoning, and in a conflict between reason and emotions, one must always side with the former.[6]\n\nEudaimonists argue that Rand\u2019s vision of a virtuous and happy life in her novels can be understood only as a form of eudaimonism, even if she often makes statements inconsistent with this vision. The chief objection to eudaimonism is that, by defining a happy life partly in terms of virtue, it employs an unconvincing conception of happiness. The philosophical literature on happiness in this sense (usually called well-being) makes and answers many such objections (Badhwar 2014).\n\n2.5 Virtues, Vices, and Egoism\n\nThe chief Objectivist virtues are rationality, integrity, honesty (with self and others), justice, independence, productiveness, and pride. Rationality,\n\none\u2019s total commitment \u2026 to the maintenance of a full mental focus in all issues, in all choices \u2026 to the fullest perception of reality within one\u2019s power, (1961b: 28)\n\nis the basic virtue of which the other virtues are aspects or derivatives. The virtues are thus united or reciprocal. Each virtue is defined partly in terms of a recognition and whole-hearted commitment to some fact or facts, a commitment understood by the agent to be indispensable for gaining, maintaining, or expressing her ultimate value. For example, integrity is \u201cthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake your consciousness\u201d (1957 [1992]: 936), a recognition that is expressed in loyalty to one\u2019s rational values and convictions, especially in the face of social pressures to surrender them (1961b: 28; 1964a: 52, 80); honesty is \u201cthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake existence\u201d, a recognition that is expressed in truthfulness in thought and speech (1957 [1992]: 936\u201337); and justice is\n\nthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake the character of men as you cannot fake the character of nature, \u2026 that every man must be judged for what he is and treated accordingly\u2026. (1957 [1992]: 937)\n\nConspicuous by their absence from Rand\u2019s list of the cardinal virtues are the \u201cvirtues of benevolence\u201d, such as kindness, charity, generosity, and forgiveness. Rand states that charity is not a major virtue or moral duty (1964b); likewise, presumably, kindness, generosity, and forgiveness. Whether, and how much, one should help others depends on their place in one\u2019s rationally defined hierarchy of values, and on the particular circumstances (whether they are worthy of help, what the likely consequences are of helping them, and so on). The greater their value vis-\u00e0-vis one\u2019s rational self-interest, the greater the help that one should be willing to give, ceteris paribus. What is never morally appropriate is making sacrifices, that is, surrendering something of value to oneself for the sake of something of less or no value to oneself. Thus, it can never be moral to knowingly risk one\u2019s life for a stranger (unless, of course, one\u2019s life is no longer worth living) or to court unhappiness for the happiness of another, whether stranger or friend. It is appropriate to help a stranger only in an emergency, and only when the risk to our own life or well-being is minimal (1963c: 43\u201345). This should not be taken to imply that helping a stranger is morally optional, regardless of the stranger\u2019s plight. Indeed, people who are \u201ctotally indifferent to anything living and would not lift a finger to help a man or a dog left mangled by a hit-and-run driver\u201d are \u201cpsychopaths\u201d (1963c: 43\u201345) Rand makes even more concessions to \u201ccommon sense morality\u201d when she states that it\u2019s good to help a neighbor going through a hard time till he can get back on his own feet, if we can afford to and if we have no reason to think that he is undeserving. Charity understood thus is a virtue because it is an expression of the generalized good will and respect that all normal people have towards others as creatures who share with them the capacity to value (1963c: 46\u201347). Nathaniel Branden tries to reconcile charity with a narrow act-egoism by declaring that the former stems from a species-identification with another, such that, in revering others, people \u201care revering their own life\u201d. By acting charitably, people actualize this sense of kinship, without sacrificing their own well-being.\n\nThis last is true, but the desire to reduce all motivations to act-egoistic motivations leads Branden (and Rand and many Objectivists) to ignore the fact that charity is first and foremost profoundly other-regarding, prompted by another\u2019s plight rather than concern for one\u2019s own self-actualization. The same is true of trying to rescue a dog mangled by a hit-and-run driver, where the egoistic motivation is even weaker, since here there is no species-identification, but rather only a \u201cgenus-identification\u201d with another sufferer.\n\nAt any rate, the argument from identification can also be used to justify charity towards strangers in non-emergency situations, for example, for those who are permanently disabled and unable to care for themselves (Badhwar forthcoming-b). Rand concedes as much in \u201cWhat is Capitalism?\u201d (1965) where she argues that people who are unable to work must rely on voluntary charity, thus implying that it is proper for those who can afford it to support strangers in non-emergency situations. And indeed, as recent scholarship has revealed, in her own life Rand was often extremely generous, not only towards friends and acquaintances, but also strangers.[7]\n\nThe question arises why Rand thinks that charity, kindness etc. are not major virtues when they meet all the conditions of appropriateness: the recipient is worthy of help, one can afford to help, it is in one\u2019s rational self-interest (or not contrary to it) to help, and so on. Perhaps Rand thinks that they are \u201cminor\u201d virtues because we are not obligated to act on them at all times, the way we are obligated to act justly and honestly at all times. A deeper reason, however, might be her conception of people as essentially agents rather than patients, doers rather than receivers, self-sufficient rather than dependent. Nevertheless, Rand\u2019s view of the unity of the virtues dictates that, even if we are not obligated to act on charity, kindness etc. at all times, they are just as important to possess as the other virtues. Moreover, in keeping with her emphasis on the importance of goodwill towards others and \u201cthe benevolent universe premise\u201d, Rand\u2019s heroes are often extraordinarily (and almost always appropriately) kind and generous, not only to those they love but also to mere acquaintances, and even sometimes adversaries (Badhwar 1993b\u2014see Other Internet Resources). Striking examples include, from The Fountainhead, Howard Roark\u2019s unsought-for attempt to give hope and courage to Steven Mallory, the gifted young sculptor whose failure to get work has driven him to the verge of a spiritual and physical collapse; Roark\u2019s unreproachful help to his erstwhile adversary, Peter Keating, when Keating falls on hard times; and from Atlas Shrugged, Dagny\u2019s support to a heart-broken and despairing Cheryl Taggart who, in the past, has treated Dagny with scorn; and Hank Rearden\u2019s generosity towards his exploitative family before he realizes their exploitativeness.[8] By contrast, Rand\u2019s villains lack genuine goodwill towards others and, thus, lack true kindness or generosity.\n\nJust as rationality, a focus on reality, is at the heart of every virtue, so irrationality, evasion of reality (including self-deception), is at the heart of every vice. Rand\u2019s villains are all master evaders motivated by a desire for power, social status, fame, or unearned wealth, and resentment of the good. They are \u201csecond-handers\u201d\u2014people whose primary relationship is to other people rather than to reality. Between the virtuous and the vicious are the \u201cinnocently wrong\u201d, people who adopt wrong moral principles or make wrong choices, not through evasion but through an error of judgment (Rand does not explicitly recognize any moral category other than virtue, vice, and moral error, although her novels portray characters that do not easily fit into any of these categories). Hank Rearden, in Atlas Shrugged, is the great innocent living under a burden of unearned guilt because of his mistaken sense of honor and his charity towards a family interested only in manipulating and using him. Cheryl Taggart is killed by the too-sudden revelation that the man she loved and admired as the embodiment of her ideals is a fraud\u2014and that the world is full of such frauds.\n\nAs already indicated, Rand justifies virtue in both instrumental and non-instrumental terms, though without distinguishing between them. The instrumental arguments show the existential and psychological rewards of virtue and costs of vice. Virtue creates a sense of inner harmony and enables mutually beneficial interactions with others. Evasiveness, by contrast, traps one in a \u201ctangled web\u201d of rationalizations and pretenses. The evader who deceives others is either eventually caught, or lives in fear of being caught, becoming dependent on others\u2019 unconsciousness. He is \u201ca fool\u201d, says a character in Atlas Shrugged, \u201cwhose source of values is the fools he succeeds in fooling\u201d (1957 [1992]: 945). Further, like Sartre, Rand holds that no evasion is completely successful, because the truth constantly threatens to resurface. Hence, the evader\u2019s \u201cdiseased soul\u201d is in a state of constant inner conflict and anxiety as he tries to suppress his awareness of uncomfortable truths while maintaining his hold on others. His lack of integrity and of esteem for reality results in a lack of self-love or self-esteem and, indeed, of a solid self. (It is noteworthy, however, that her portrayal of Gail Wynand in The Fountainhead is closer to Aristotle\u2019s portrayal of the vicious man in Book III of the Nicomachean Ethics as someone who is \u201cunconscious of his vice\u201d, than to her own stated view of the evader.)\n\nThese views are familiar from the history of philosophy, but many readers find their expression in Rand\u2019s novels to be of unusual psychological depth and conviction. Nevertheless, the views are subject to the well-known objection that the complexity and variability of human psychology and society allow only \u201cfor the most part\u201d generalizations about the existential and psychological benefits of virtue or costs of vice. Thus, it is possible for a small injustice to lead to great rewards, especially since others are willing to shrug off or forgive occasional transgressions. It is also possible for poor introspection, forgetfulness, or self-acceptance to allow one to evade something without any need for supporting evasions or damage to one\u2019s self-esteem. Again, even if every wrongdoing carries psychological costs, these might sometimes be outweighed by the long-term costs of doing the right thing (as Rand herself suggests in her portrayal of the embittered Henry Cameron and Stephen Mallory in The Fountainhead).\n\nThe non-instrumentalist justification of virtue in Rand\u2019s novels is largely immune to these objections (though subject to the objections noted in 2.4 above). To compromise morally is, necessarily, to compromise one\u2019s own (objectively conceived) happiness, because no existential loss can compare to the loss of moral integrity. Rectitude is partly constitutive of genuine happiness because it expresses the right relationship to reality: to existence, to oneself, and to others. For the same reason, it is partly constitutive of a self worth loving, an ideally human or rational self. Like Plato and Aristotle, Rand argues that virtue necessarily creates inner harmony and certitude. Any value gained at the price of rectitude is only the simulacrum of genuine value. In a variety of conceptually interconnected ways, then, virtuous individuals are necessarily better off than those willing to take moral short-cuts. In its structure and much of its content, Rand\u2019s ethical egoism is thus of a piece with the egoism of ancient eudaimonistic theories.\n\nAn objection often levied against egoistic theories is that they give the wrong reason for acting in other-regarding ways: justly, kindly, etc. My act is not really just if I give you your due because it is good for me rather than because you deserve it; it is not really charitable if I help you for my own benefit rather than yours. A common reply is that the egoist\u2019s justification is egoistic but not her motivation, a reply that itself invites the charge of moral \u201cschizophrenia\u201d. Rand does not address the \u201cwrong-reason\u201d objection, but it\u2019s unlikely that she would accept this dichotomy between justification and motivation. So insofar as her view is instrumentalist and act-egoistic, the problem remains. The non-instrumentalist strand in her theory, however, implies that the objection itself is mistaken, because giving you what you deserve/merit is partly constitutive of my rational interests; there is no conflict between your rational interests and mine (cf. 1964a: 57\u201365).\n\n2.6 Altruism\n\nRand regards goodwill towards others, or a generalized benevolence, as an offshoot of proper self-love, with no independent source in human nature. There is only one alternative to being rationally self-interested: sacrificing one\u2019s proper interests, either for the sake of other people (which she equates with altruism) or for the sake of the supernatural (which she calls mysticism) (1982a: ch. 7). Kant\u2019s ethics is a secularized mysticism insofar as it rests on categorical commands and duty for duty\u2019s sake, which is to say: regardless of any earthly desire or interest (1970). An altruistic ethics equates right action with self-sacrifice for the sake of others\u2019 good and immorality with \u201cselfishness\u201d, while saying nothing about the standard of the good (\u201cIntroduction\u201d, 1964a: iii; 1974). It thus fails to answer the prior question of what code of values we should follow and why, and provides no motivation to be moral other than guilt over \u201cselfishness\u201d. When taken to its logical conclusion, altruism does not simply tell us that it is \u201cselfish\u201d to pursue our own desires, but also that it is \u201cselfish to uphold\u2026 [our own] convictions, \u2026 [that we] must sacrifice them to the convictions of others\u201d (Rand 1957 [1992]: 943; Galt\u2019s Speech, Rand 1961a: 142). In foreign policy, altruism is used to justify and gain support for America\u2019s intervention in other countries (1966a). Altruism is also the reason why so many sympathize with, or even praise, bloody dictatorships that proudly proclaim that the sacrifice of the individual is a necessary and noble means to the goal of the collective good (Rand 1966a).\n\nAs a moral code, altruism is impractical, because its requirements are contrary to the requirements of life and happiness, both the agent\u2019s and other people\u2019s. As such, it is also profoundly immoral. Altruism leaves us without any moral guidance in our everyday lives and gives morality a bad name.\n\nWhat, then, is the psychological explanation for the widespread equation of altruism with morality? Rand suggests various explanations reminiscent of Nietzsche\u2019s analysis of the psychology of altruism. The theorists and preachers of altruism are motivated largely by a desire to control and manipulate others by playing on their guilt. Those who accept their teachings typically do so either because of guilt over their own superior achievements, or because, lacking any \u201cintellectual integrity, love of truth\u2026or a passionate dedication to an idea\u201d, they have nothing much worth saving, and so do not mind sacrificing themselves (\u201cSelfishness Without a Self\u201d, 1973b; 1982a). Some altruists are altruists because their mentalities are still frozen in a tribal past when survival required the sacrifice of some for the sake of others (1973b). Rand herself rejects a zero-sum picture of human relationships, so long as everyone in the relationship acts rationally.\n\nRand\u2019s defense of \u201cselfishness\u201d and rejection of altruism are part of the reason both for her popularity with the general reader, and her unpopularity with philosophers and other intellectuals, although some would no doubt agree with her rejection of abject self-sacrifice and her recognition of proper concern with the self as moral (Falk 1963; Gilligan 1982; Hampton 1993; Badhwar 1993a). The general reader who responds positively to Rand\u2019s work finds, for the first time, a moral justification for pursuing a life of her or his own and a liberation from \u201cunearned guilt\u201d. The philosopher who responds negatively to her work finds many biased and simplistic interpretations of philosophers and philosophical doctrines, including her claim that she is the first to consistently defend a morality of rational self-interest, all other philosophers having defended either altruism or mysticism (Pojman 1995). Her critics also challenge her equation of altruism with abject self-sacrifice (Rachels 2000, Flew 1984), and her claim (explained below) that there is no conflict between people\u2019s rational interests (Flew 1984). An adequate interpretation of her views, however, requires attention both to the fact that, in the absence of special obligations created by bonds of love, contract, or family, she regards others\u2019 needs as making no claim on us, and to the fact that she is an uncompromising defender of justice, honesty, and respect for others as ends in themselves.\n\n3. Social-Political Philosophy\n\n3.1 Rights, Capitalism, and the Trader Principle\n\nRand\u2019s moral society is a society of independent individuals who respect each other\u2019s natural rights to life, liberty, and property, and who trade value for value, materially and spiritually. They live, in her words, by \u201cthe trader principle\u201d. Individual (natural) rights and the trader principle are both dictated by the fact that, as rational, independent beings, we need to think and act for our \u201cproper survival\u201d (1961b: 31). Both are required by respect for individuals as ends in themselves, not mere means to others\u2019 ends.\n\n\u201cRights\u201d are a moral concept\u2014the concept that provides a logical transition from the principles guiding an individual\u2019s actions to the principles guiding his relationship with others\u2014the concept that preserves and protects individual morality in a social context\u2014the link between the moral code of a man and the legal code of a society, between ethics and politics. Individual rights are the means of subordinating society to moral law. (1963b: 92).\n\nThese natural rights are basically rights to actions, not to things or outcomes, and they can be violated only through the initiation of force or fraud. Hence, all natural rights are negative, that is, claims on others\u2019 non-interference, and not claims on them to provide one with certain goods or outcomes.[9] The fundamental right is the right to life: the right to take the actions necessary for sustaining the life proper to a human being.\n\nThe right to life means\u2026the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life. (Such is the meaning of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.). (1963b: 93)\n\nThe right to liberty is the right to act (including to write and speak) on one\u2019s judgment; the right to the pursuit of happiness is the right to pursue goals for one\u2019s own fulfillment; the right to property is \u201cthe right to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values\u201d (1963b: 94). Like the mind-body dichotomy, the common dichotomy between \u201chuman rights\u201d and the right to property is a false one, because to own one\u2019s life is to own one\u2019s actions and their fruits (1962b: 91).[10] Just as there is a causal and logical connection between the virtues, so there is between these rights: a government that violates human rights also violates property rights. Thus, for example, in violating the right to freedom of expression by banning \u201cobscene\u201d speech on TV, the government violates the property right of the owners of the TV station to use their property as they see fit. Like other libertarians, both right (market) and left (egalitarian), Rand opposes state regulation of morality, as well as forced service to the state, whether military or civilian. She criticizes both conservatives and liberals (as these terms are understood in American politics) for wanting government to control the realm they regard as important: the spiritual or moral realm in the case of conservatives, and the material or economic realm in the case of liberals (1981b). Both sides thus betray a lack of understanding of the fact that human beings need to be free in both realms to be free in either.\n\nThere is much that is of great value here, especially Rand\u2019s insight that we would not have rights if we did not need them for our survival and happiness (Miller & Mossoff forthcoming; Badhwar forthcoming-a). But critics point out that grounding all rights in the right to take the actions necessary for \u201cproper survival\u201d entails that one has no right to take actions that are contrary to proper survival: blindly following a guru instead of thinking for oneself, living off others because one prefers the life of a couch potato to fending for oneself, wasting one\u2019s property instead of using it wisely, or, most obviously, committing suicide (Mack 1984; Zwolinski forthcoming; Badhwar forthcoming-a). Yet the freedom to do only that which is morally good or rational is not a freedom at all. But this is not Rand\u2019s consistent position. For example, she also says that, as fallible creatures, human beings\n\nmust be free to agree or disagree, to cooperate or to pursue their own independent course, each according to his own rational judgment. (1965: 17)\n\nSome commentators rely on this statement to argue that Rand is not restricting rights to actions that are necessary for proper survival (Miller & Mossoff forthcoming). But it would be more accurate to say that, while this position is the one that is compatible with her deep-seated commitment to liberty and a minimal government, she also often makes statements that entail the opposite.\n\nRand argues that the only just social-political system, the only system compatible with our rational nature and with the right of individuals to live for their own sakes, is capitalism (1965, 1967b), that is,\n\nlaissez-faire capitalism\u2014with a separation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church. (1961b, 1964a)\n\nState regulation of the market, she argues, is responsible for corrupting both state and market institutions, just as political regulation of religion (or religious regulation of politics), wherever it exists, corrupts both state and religious institutions. Regulation creates the opportunity for the trading of favors between politicians and religious leaders, and politicians and businesses. Atlas Shrugged offers a complex and compelling depiction of the economic, political, and moral corruption spawned by \u201ccronyism\u201d between government and business. Laissez-faire capitalism is \u201cthe only [social] system that bans force from social relationships\u201d domestically and abroad, because the trader and the warrior are antagonists (Rand 1966a). Rand\u2019s conception of capitalism is, thus, more radical than the mainstream conception, and her defense of it significantly different both from the utilitarian defenses given by most economists, and the religious defenses given by many conservatives (see Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1984b; Machan 1984). She does, of course, praise capitalism (or semi-capitalism) for creating widespread prosperity, but this feature is itself explained only by the fact that it leaves individuals free to produce in peace. In Atlas Shrugged, Rand distinguishes between the few business people who earn their money through honest effort, without seeking favors from the government, and the vast majority who are members of \u201cthe aristocracy of pull\u201d (\u201ccrony capitalists\u201d, in contemporary terminology) and get rich only through such favors, a situation that she thinks prevails, and has always prevailed, in the real world (Rand 1964c). She holds that for a short period in the nineteenth-century America came closer to a laissez-faire system than any other society before or since, but that capitalism remains an unknown ideal. Some critics complain, however, that in her non-fiction (1961c) Rand does not always recognize the aristocrats of pull in the real world\u2014business leaders who lobby politicians for subsidies for themselves and restrictions on their competitors (Rothbard 1968; Johnson 2006).\n\nRand rejects the criticism that unregulated, laissez-faire capitalism would lead to a concentration of power in a few hands and undermine equality of opportunity because laissez-faire capitalism requires the rule of law, a well-defined system of property rights, freedom of contract, and, as a corollary, a government that abstains from all favoritism.\n\nRand holds that there is no conflict between one person\u2019s rational interests and another\u2019s, hence that respecting other people\u2019s rights is perfectly compatible with advancing or preserving one\u2019s own interests. Is it true, however, that rational interests cannot conflict? It seems that whenever two people have an interest in one good, for example, a job, and are equally qualified to have it, their rational interests conflict, Perhaps what Rand has in mind is that rational interests don\u2019t necessarily conflict, that is, that it is not in their nature to conflict. Their conflict is due to external factors, such as only one job for two qualified people. But is such conflict compatible with rights in an egoistic framework? And can rights be defended within an egoistic framework? Critics object that respect for others\u2019 rights cannot be justified only as a means to one\u2019s ultimate value, whether this be survival or happiness (Mack 1984; Flew 1984). For under perfectly realistic scenarios, one\u2019s ultimate value can require one to violate another\u2019s right to life or property. In her justification of rights we see the same unresolved tension between the instrumentalist strand and the deontic strand that we do in her justification of morality in general (Mack 1984, 2003). The eudaimonist strand in Rand\u2019s justification, however, allows her to respond that respect for others\u2019 rights expresses our recognition of the fact that others are ends in themselves, a recognition that is required by justice, and that justice, along with the other virtues, is necessary for leading a happy life.\n\nRand defines government as\n\nan institution that holds the exclusive power to enforce certain rules of social conduct in a given geographical area. (1963a: 125)\n\nA proper government is\n\nthe means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control\u2014i.e., under objectively defined law. (1963b: 128)\n\nSuch a government is minimal, limited to protecting us from criminals and foreign aggressors, and enforcing individual rights and contracts, with the help of the armed forces, police, and objectively defined civil and criminal laws and courts. Someone who violates his contracts, or engages in fraud, is guilty of the \u201cindirect\u201d use of force, in that he obtains a value from another without that person\u2019s consent (1963a: 111). Accordingly, the government may use or threaten force only in retaliation against those who initiate or threaten force directly or indirectly. A government that tries to enforce the brother\u2019s keeper principle\u2014\u201cfrom each according to his ability, to each according to his need\u201d; or that drafts citizens into the armed services or \u201cpublic service\u201d; or that tries to make them more virtuous, educated, well-mannered, healthy, or wealthy, violates rights. Statism in all its forms, from unlimited democracy to a mixed economy to dictatorship, is at odds with our status as independent, rational beings, as ends in ourselves. Statism also destroys ability and fails to fulfill anyone\u2019s needs for long, because \u201c[t]o deal with men by force is as impractical as to deal with nature by persuasion\u201d (1973a: 32). The fountainhead of all progress is the human mind, and the mind does not function well when forced.\n\nIn Atlas Shrugged Rand depicts her utopia, Galt\u2019s Gulch, as a \u201cvoluntary association of men held together by nothing but every man\u2019s self-interest\u201d, without any formal organization (1957 [1992]: 690). There is a judge to arbitrate disagreements, but there has never been any need for arbitration. Galt\u2019s Gulch is, thus, an anarchist society, although Rand never calls it that. In \u201cThe Nature of Government\u201d, however, Rand rejects anarchism as irrational and unworkable because, she says, it is incompatible with a single, objective system of law and, thus, with rights and peaceful cooperation (1963a). Anarchist critics, such as Roy Childs (1969 [1994]) and Murray Rothbard (1978), have argued that a territorial monopoly on law and force (government) is not necessary, because people can establish a just and effective legal system in a competitive market of security providers (see Long and Machan 2009). The Law Merchant, a body of law established and enforced in private courts by the merchants of various countries, illustrates the possibility of an effective voluntary legal system. Further, a government is incompatible with Rand\u2019s own principle of the non-initiation of force, a principle she regards as the linchpin of a moral society (Long 2013; cf. Cox 2013a and 2013b).\n\nThe trader principle states that a voluntary, mutually beneficial exchange between independent equals is the only basis for a mutually respectful and rational relationship (1961b: 31). It is also the only basis for a peaceful relationship among countries: \u201cthe trader and the warrior have been fundamental antagonists throughout history\u201d (1966a: 38).\n\nThe trader principle applies to emotional relationships as well. To love or admire someone is to \u201cpay\u201d him for the pleasure one derives from his virtues (1961b: 31)\u2014or, Rand might say in the case of love for a small child, from his personality. It would seem, however, that the trade between parent and child is unequal, given that the child receives both pleasure and material support from the parent. And it is unclear how the trader principle applies at all when a severe disability renders a beloved child or spouse a source of pain rather than pleasure.\n\n3.2 Feminism\n\nIf feminism is the view that women are, and ought to be recognized as, men\u2019s intellectual, moral, sexual, and political equals, then the Objectivist philosophy of human nature is inherently feminist, since it applies equally to all human beings, regardless of gender (or race) (N. Branden 1999). Decades before it was considered acceptable for women to lack \u201cmaternal instincts\u201d or pursue careers, Rand created heroines who lack the first and pursue the second, free of guilt or self-doubt.[11] Kira (We the Living) wants to be an engineer, and Dagny (Atlas Shrugged) runs Taggart Transcontinental, the largest and most successful transcontinental railroad in the country. None of Rand\u2019s heroines sacrifices her interests, intellect, or principles for the man or men in her life. One literary critic argues that Dagny is the first, and perhaps only, epic heroine in Western literature because of the grandness of her vision, her courage and integrity, her unusual abilities, and her national importance (Michalson 1999). Rand\u2019s depiction of her heroines\u2019 enjoyment of sex and their freedom from all merely conventional norms about sex anticipates the sexual liberation movement of the 20th century by at least 30 years. In all three novels, it is the heroine who has the power to choose which of the men who love, admire, and desire her (and only her) she will have. Rand was also an ardent champion of a woman\u2019s right to control her own reproductive choices (1968a, 1981).\n\nHer relationship to the feminist movement, however, was more complex. Although she praised Betty Friedan\u2019s The Feminine Mystique, mainstream feminism\u2019s collectivism and emphasis on women as victims later led her to reject feminism as such. Many theorists argue that Rand\u2019s work, especially Atlas Shrugged, upholds important feminist ideals, even as it succumbs to some anti-feminist tendencies that contradict her individualistic ethics (e.g., Gladstein 1978, 1999; B. Branden 1999; Presley 1999; Sheaffer 1999; Taylor 1999). Many others regard her and her work as plainly anti-feminist, with Susan Brownmiller even calling her \u201ca traitor to her own sex\u201d (Brownmiller 1975). One criticism takes aim at the individualism of Rand\u2019s ethics and politics, which rejects any special government help for women or discrimination against men (e.g., Harrison 1978). Another objects that Rand has internalized a masculine conception of human nature and virtue, and then created her ideal woman in light of this conception (Brownmiller 1975; Glennon 1979). This may be responsible for Rand\u2019s puzzling (and offensive) view that the essence of femininity is to hero-worship (not men, but) masculinity, while insisting (as her novels depict) that women and men are inherently equal and that the ideal romantic relationship is between moral and intellectual equals (1968b; cf. Brown 1999). At least as offensive to many are the violent sex scenes in her novels, especially the infamous scene in The Fountainhead that many regard as rape, where Howard Roark has sex with Dominique in spite of her resistance.\n\nThose who reject the charge of rape argue that in the 1940s and 50s, when Rand wrote her novels, it would have been seen as rough sex rather than non-consensual sex (McElroy 1999; Sheaffer 1999). That Rand herself thought of this scene as consensual is shown a few pages later, when she writes: \u201cThey had been united in an understanding beyond the violence, beyond the deliberate obscenity of his action\u201d (1943: 218). And in letters to disturbed readers in 1946 and 1965, Rand denied that the scene is \u201cactual rape\u201d which, she stated, is \u201ca dreadful crime\u201d, a \u201cvicious action and a violation of a woman\u2019s rights\u201d (Rand 1995a). On the other hand, she also depicts Dominique exultantly telling herself that she\u2019s been raped. McElroy wonders if having her heroine call it rape is just another instance of Rand\u2019s desire to provoke and shock the reader (McElroy 1999), as when she uses \u201cselfishness\u201d to mean \u201crational self-interest\u201d.\n\n4. Aesthetics\n\nRand holds that our actions need guidance by a vision of the fundamental nature of the universe and of the efficacy of human thought and activity\u2014a vision that can be grasped directly rather than requiring the conscious repetition of long chains of abstract reasoning. The chief function of art is to meet this psychological need by expressing abstract conceptual values and metaphysical truths in concrete perceptible form. Art, according to Rand, constitutes a selective, stylized re-creation of reality, with the principle of selection being the artist\u2019s \u201csense of life\u201d, a set of implicit \u201cmetaphysical value-judgments\u201d, i.e., judgments about what is fundamentally significant about the world and our place in it. (There is controversy among Rand scholars as to whether what is re-created in art is certain elements of reality or reality as a whole, i.e., a \u201cmicrocosm\u201d, as well as how and whether the concept of re-creation applies to apparently non-representational forms of art: Torres and Kamhi 2000; Bissell 2004.) Both the artist\u2019s creative work and the audience\u2019s emotional responses to it are driven by their senses of life, that is, the worldviews they have \u201cformed by a process of emotional generalization \u2026 a subconscious counterpart of a process of abstraction\u201d (1966b: 27). The role of art in sustaining us psychologically by providing a concretization of our most fundamental values is a frequent theme in Rand\u2019s fiction as well, especially The Fountainhead.[12]\n\nWhile art can be used to convey information or to advocate a position, such functions are secondary to its chief task: providing an object whose mere contemplation brings spiritual fulfillment. Hence Rand does not regard her own novels primarily as vehicles for her philosophy, though of course they are that inter alia. Given her own worldview, Rand favors literature with a strong plot as a way of expressing purposeful human action in a world of causal regularity, and stories involving value-conflicts as a way of expressing the importance of free choice; hence her preference for romantic (as opposed to, e.g., naturalistic) literature. But Rand holds that it is possible to evaluate an artwork\u2019s aesthetic value simply in terms of its success in conveying a concretization of the artist\u2019s sense of life, whether or not one shares the values and judgments so conveyed."}, {"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/Archives/fall2013/entries/ayn-rand/", "page_content": "Ayn Rand\n\nFirst published Tue Jun 8, 2010; substantive revision Thu Jul 5, 2012\n\nAyn Rand (1905\u20131982) was a philosopher and a novelist who outlined a comprehensive philosophy, including an epistemology and a theory of art, in her novels and essays. Early in her career she also wrote short stories, plays, and screenplays. Rand's first and most autobiographical novel, We the Living (1936), set in the Soviet Union, was published only after many rejections, owing to widespread sympathy for the Soviet \u201cexperiment\u201d among the intellectuals of the day. We the Living was quickly followed by the dystopian novel, Anthem (1938), written as \u201ca kind of rest\u201d from work on her next major novel, The Fountainhead (1943). The Fountainhead, also published after many rejections because of its individualism, and largely panned by critics, soon became a best-seller by word of mouth. The Fountainhead brought Rand international fame, and Atlas Shrugged (1957) sealed this fame. By 1958, Rand's novels, increasingly philosophical, had won her ideas a sufficiently devoted following for her to form, in association with psychologist Nathaniel Branden (with whom she later broke), an official \u201cObjectivist\u201d philosophical movement, complete with journals and lecture courses. We the Living and The Fountainhead have been made into movies, as has Part I of a projected trilogy of Atlas Shrugged.\n\nIn Rand's own words, her first and greatest love, her \u201clife purpose,\u201d was \u201cthe creation of the kind of world \u2026 that represents human perfection,\u201d while her interest in philosophical knowledge was \u201conly\u201d for the sake of this purpose (Journal entry for 4 May 1946; in 1997, p. 479).[1] Nevertheless, her interest in philosophical knowledge continued long after she had created this world in her magnum opus, Atlas Shrugged, her last work of fiction. In essays and lectures, Rand developed her conception of metaphysical realism, rationality, ethical egoism (rational self-interest), individual rights, laissez-faire capitalism, and art, and applied her philosophy to social issues. The libertarian political movement, though largely disowned by Rand, drew\u2014and draws\u2014great inspiration from her moral defense of the minimal state, that is, the state whose only raison d'\u00eatre is protection of individual rights. For all her popularity, however, only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously. As a result, most of the serious philosophical work on Rand has appeared in non-academic, non-peer-reviewed, journals, or in books, and the bibliography reflects this fact. We discuss the main reasons for her rejection by most professional philosophers in the next section. Our discussion of Rand's philosophical views, especially her moral-political views, draws not only from her non-fiction, but also her fiction, since her views cannot be accurately interpreted or evaluated without doing so.\n\nAyn Rand was born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum, to a bourgeois Jewish family in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 2 February 1905. A witness to the Russian Revolution and civil war, Rand opposed both the Communists and the Tsarists. She majored in history, but the social science program in which she was enrolled at Petrograd State University included philosophy, law, and philology. Her teachers emphasized\u2014as she herself later did\u2014the importance of developing systematic connections among different areas of thought (Sciabarra 1995). Rand's formal philosophical education included ancient philosophy (especially Plato and Aristotle), logic, philosophical psychology, Marxism-Leninism, and non-Marxist political thought. But she was evidently also exposed to Hegelian and Nietzschean ideas, which blossomed during this period (known as the Russian Silver Age), and read a great deal of Friedrich Nietzsche on her own. After graduating from Petrograd State University in 1924, an interest in screenwriting led her to enroll in the State Institute for Cinematography. On the literary side, she studied the great Russian novelists and poets, but fell in love with Victor Hugo, to whose influence she owes the \u201cRomantic Realism\u201d of her novels.\n\nIn 1925 Rand succeeded in obtaining permission to visit relatives in the United States; hating the Soviet system, she left with no intention of returning. After six months with relatives in Chicago, she made her way to Hollywood where, on her second day, a fortuitous encounter with Cecil B. DeMille led to a job as a script reader, and later as a screenplay writer. The next week she had another fortuitous encounter, this time with the actor Frank O'Connor, whom she married in 1929. She was married to him till his death in 1979. She adopted the pen name Ayn Rand to (it is thought) protect her family back in Russia, although she also told the New York Evening Post in 1936 that \u201cRand\u201d was an abbreviation of her Russian surname.\n\nRand and her husband moved permanently to New York City in 1951, where she became involved with, and was influenced by, the circle of mostly New-York-based intellectuals involved in the revival of classical liberalism, such as the economic journalist Henry Hazlitt, the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, and the Canadian-American novelist, literary critic, and political philosopher Isabel Paterson. Rand also studied, and was a great admirer of, the Lockean philosophy of the American founding. Rand lived and worked in New York City until her death in 1982.\n\nRand holds that philosophy, like all forms of knowledge and achievement, is important only because it is necessary for living a good human life and creating a world conducive to living such a life. Philosophy supplies the most fundamental cognitive and normative abstractions which, respectively, identify and evaluate what is. Everyone, according to Rand, needs a philosophy and is guided by at least an implicit one (1982a, ch. 1). Her novels express her belief that if our philosophy is more or less correct, our lives will be more or less successful, if our philosophy is wildly off the mark, our lives will be disastrous. Philosophy thus has an urgent, practical importance. But unlike Marx, her philosophical and political antipode, Rand thinks that social change has to start with a moral revolution within each individual and the spread of the right ideas and ideals through rational discourse and the inspiration of art.\n\nRand's ideal human being appears, in varying degrees of development, in all her novels; her ideal world appears in Atlas Shrugged. Her novels feature striking, complex plots with subtle psychological explorations of her characters' emotions and thoughts, and philosophical reflections that rarely lose sight of the dramatic context. Like many famous Russian novelists, especially Dostoevsky, whom she recognized as a great psychologist, Rand also uses long speeches to lay out her philosophy, a device that has both its supporters and its detractors. She described Atlas Shrugged as a \u201cstunt novel\u201d and a murder mystery\u2014the murder of the human soul by a collectivist culture. By \u201csoul,\u201d however, she meant not an immortal substance that survives the death of the body\u2014she is not a dualist in any aspect of her philosophy\u2014but the mind, or the human spirit that celebrates life on this earth. The novel shows what happens when \u201cthe men of mind\u201d\u2014the \u201cprime movers,\u201d the producers\u2014go on strike. It also shows how the wrong epistemology can lead to train wrecks, how the wrong metaphysics can lead to the wrong ethics and thus to disastrous personal choices and a disastrous political and economic system, and how the right philosophy is needed for the rebirth of the soul and the rebuilding of the world. Her protagonists are not knights on white steeds rescuing damsels in distress, or swordsmen who can fight off a dozen enemies single-handed, but men and women in the mid-century industrial America of steel mills, skyscrapers, and glimmering highways: women who run transcontinental railroads and men who revolutionize architecture or (long before clean energy became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre) build a motor powered by static electricity to produce limitless, clean energy. In many people's eyes, her novels are inspiring because they bring moral perfection down to earth. They see her moral exemplars as people of unbreached integrity, with colorful and remarkable lives, made more remarkable by their philosophical depth. This estimate is not, of course, shared by all: many readers find her characters wooden, her writing stilted, and her ethical and political views misguided.\n\nRand paid tribute to Aristotle, whom she considered the greatest of all philosophers, in the titles she gave to the three Parts of Atlas Shrugged (Non-Contradiction, Either-Or, A is A) and to one of the chapters (The Immovable Movers). While she differed sharply from Nietzsche on many issues, including rationality, free will, and individual rights, his influence is evident in her provocative, often aphoristic, point-counterpoint writing style, as well as in her \u201ctransvaluation\u201d of traditional values and her powerful affirmation of life and joy and the spirit of youth. In the Introduction to the 25th Anniversary edition of The Fountainhead, she stated that the novel's sense of life is best conveyed by a quotation from Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil: \u201cThe noble soul has reverence for itself\u201d. (For The Fountainhead's partly sympathetic and partly critical engagement with Nietzsche's ideas, see Hunt 2006.)\n\nAfter publishing Atlas Shrugged in 1957 Rand devoted herself to non-fiction\u2014albeit non-fiction liberally peppered with quotations from her heroes' speeches. She wrote polemical, philosophical essays, often in response to questions by fans of Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead; lectured on college campuses; and gave radio and television interviews. Her views of past and contemporary Anglo-American philosophy, however, seem to have been based largely on summaries of philosophers' works and conversations with a few philosophers and with her young acolytes, themselves students of philosophy. Unfortunately, this did not stop her from commenting dismissively, and often contemptuously, on other philosophers' works. Contemporary philosophers, by and large, returned the compliment by dismissing her work contemptuously, often on the basis of hearsay or cursory reading. A common source of misunderstanding is Rand's use of \u201cselfishness\u201d to mean rational self-interest rather than \u201cpursuit of one's own interests at the cost of others' interests,\u201d and \u201caltruism\u201d to entail abject self-sacrifice rather than \u201cother-regard\u201d. But there are also other barriers to an academic study of Rand's work: most of her non-fiction is written for the general public, and lacks the self-critical, detailed style of analytic philosophy; understanding her views requires reading her fiction, but her fiction is not to everyone's taste; she developed many of her views in lectures and essays and letters written in response to questions sent by her readers, but never took the time to defend them against possible objections or to reconcile them with the views expressed in her novels; and finally, her polemical style, often contemptuous tone, and the dogmatism and cult-like behavior of many of her fans suggest that her work is not worth taking seriously.[2] Last but not least, her advocacy of a minimal state with the sole function of protecting negative individual rights is contrary to the welfare statism of most academics. For all this, however, in recent years academic appreciation of Rand's work has increased, and many philosophers now recognize it as often original, containing insights that sometimes anticipate later academic work.\n\nRand states that her philosophy, \u201cin essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute\u201d (Rand 1957, Afterword). Capitalism, \u201cthe unknown ideal,\u201d is the only political-economic system compatible with this philosophy because it is the only system based on respect for human beings as ends in themselves.\n\nFundamental to Rand's outlook\u2014so fundamental that she derives the name of her philosophical system, \u201cObjectivism,\u201d from it\u2014is a trichotomy among three categories: the intrinsic, the subjective, and the objective. (Rand 1990a, 52\u201354; Rand 1965, 13\u201323) An intrinsic phenomenon is one whose nature depends wholly on factors external to the mind; a subjective phenomenon is one whose nature depends wholly on the mind; and an objective phenomenon is defined, variously, as that which depends on the relation between a living entity's nature (including the nature of its mind) and its environment, or as that which depends on the relation between a properly functioning (rational) mind and extramental reality. Commentators are divided over the best way to interpret Rand's views on this issue.\n\nRand holds that there is a widespread tendency to ignore the third category or to assimilate it to the second, thus setting up a false dichotomy between the intrinsic and the subjective. On Rand's view, many of the fundamental questions of philosophy, from the existence of universals to the nature of value, involve fruitless debates over the false alternative \u201cintrinsic or subjective?\u201d in cases where the phenomenon in question is neither intrinsic nor subjective, but rather objective.\n\nIf ethics is the branch of philosophy concerned with practice, then in a sense all of Rand's philosophy is ethics, for Rand stresses \u201cthe supremacy of actual living over all other considerations,\u201d and insists that philosophy needs to be \u201cbrought up to the realm of actual living\u201d\u2014adding \u201cI say intentionally brought up to it, not down\u201d (Journal entry for 15 May 1934, p. 72; in Rand 1997, p. 73). Consequently, Rand regularly concerns herself with the practical implications and social relevance not only of moral and political philosophy, but likewise of the seemingly more arcane strata of metaphysics and epistemology\u2014as when she identifies errors in concept-formation as one of the roots of racism, or mind-body dualism as a root of the dichotomy between economic and personal freedom. This approach likewise reflects Rand's emphasis on integrating each piece of information into the total context of one's knowledge, and her consequent hostility to compartmentalization.\n\nRand's conviction of the vital practical importance of abstract theory may help to explain the passionately polemical nature of her philosophical writing, which some readers find inspiring and others hyperbolic and off-putting\u2014though Rand's admiration for Nietzsche, as well as her having been educated in a Marxist-Leninist atmosphere, may also play a role. Rand also tended\u2014perhaps owing in part to the same two influences\u2014to regard philosophical errors as revelatory of the psychological flaws of their authors.\n\nFor Rand, all knowledge is derived from perception, and a judgment can be \u201cvalidated\u201d (Rand's term for establishing an idea's basis in reality) only by tracing it to its foundations at the perceptual level. In this sense Rand counts as a kind of empiricist. But she rejects the traditional rationalist/empiricist dichotomy, taking it to embody a false alternative: rationalism holds that we can deduce knowledge from concepts acquired without the help of perception, whereas empiricism holds that we can gain propositional knowledge from experience without the help of concepts. For Rand, neither is possible: while the senses provide the raw material of knowledge, conceptual processing is needed to establish knowable propositions. (Whether Rand's characterization of rationalists and empiricists is fair is debatable.)\n\nFor Rand the acquisition of knowledge is a process of differentiation and integration\u2014of discriminating among objects of awareness on the basis of their differences, and then uniting the discriminated phenomena into a cognitively graspable whole. The process begins at the perceptual level (Rand accepts the existence of a pre-perceptual form of consciousness which she calls sensation, but does not assign it much of a role in her theory), when entities are differentiated from their surroundings and integrated as unified wholes.\n\nThe primary objects of perception\u2014and the basic building blocks of Rand's ontology as well\u2014are entities. Attributes and actions are secondary; they make sense only as actions and attributes of entities. This does not mean, however, that entities are bare substrata underlying their attributes. There is no such thing as existence other than as some definite thing with a specific identity; identity is the form that existence takes. Hence an entity just is the totality of its attributes.\n\nRand distinguishes two senses of \u201centity\u201d (1990a, 268\u201374). In the narrow sense, an entity is an object whose unity is independent of our consciousness. Rand compares entities in this sense to Aristotelian primary substances (though without endorsing the details of Aristotle's hylomorphism), and regards them as the basic ontological constituents of reality. In the broader sense, an entity is anything we choose to consider apart from its surroundings, even if it has no more unity than what we give it in so considering it\u2014as when we attend either to parts of entities or to groups of entities. Entities in the narrow sense have their entity status metaphysically, and presumably intrinsically, i.e., as explained above, apart from their relationship to our consciousness (though this is a matter of debate in Rand scholarship: Jilk 2003; Bissell 2007). Entities in the broad sense may have their entity status only epistemologically, that is, only in relation to consciousness. Their status as existents, however, remains metaphysical. That is, they really exist apart from our manner of considering them, even if they do not exist as entities apart from our manner of considering them.\n\nWhile Rand sometimes refers to the evidence of the senses as \u201cdata,\u201d she does not regard the deliverances of the senses as \u201csense-data\u201d understood as features of our subjective experience; the data of the senses, for her, are genuine extramental entities and their attributes. Our perceptual faculties place us in direct contact with reality. In this sense Rand's theory of perception is a version of direct realism, holding that the objects of perception are extramental entities (rather than, say, subjective experiences on the basis of which we infer entities as their causes).\n\nThe validity of sense-perception is not susceptible of proof, because it is presupposed by all proof, since proof just is a matter of adducing sensory evidence. Nor can its validity be denied or questioned, since the very conceptual tools one would have to use to do this are derived from sensory data and so presuppose their validity. Hence perceptual error is not strictly possible, though it is possible to misinterpret perceptual evidence\u2014and phenomena that many would regard as perceptual illusions are instead identified by Rand either as correct perceptions misinterpreted (e.g., optical illusions) or as non-perceptions mistaken for perceptions (e.g., dreams and hallucinations).\n\nThe formation of concepts and beliefs upon this sensory basis, by contrast, is a volitional process that is quite definitely capable of being subject to error. Rand accepts sensory data as a basic, unquestionable, pre-conceptual starting-point of all knowledge, and so in that sense embraces a version of the epistemologically \u201cGiven.\u201d Rand's \u201cGiven,\u201d however, are extramental entities and their attributes, not propositional judgments about them; all propositional judgments are products of the volitional, conceptual level of consciousness and so are potentially fallible.\n\nRand rejects the view that some perceptions are of the qualities of objects as they are independently of us (primary qualities), whereas others (secondary qualities) are caused by the primary qualities, and are entirely in the mind (Rand 1990a, 279ff ). Instead, she distinguishes between the content of a perception and its form; when we perceive an object as, e.g., square and red, what we perceive are its intrinsic features in a certain form, a form that is determined by the nature of the object, the nature of our perceptual organs, and the environment. Thus, we perceive the object's shape as square, and the reflectance properties of its surface as red; both are the result of the interaction of our perceptual organs with what is out there. Neither squareness nor redness belong either to the object apart from our mode of perception, or to our mode of perception apart from the object in its environment. Hence, these attributes are neither intrinsic nor subjective but relational and objective (Kelley 1986; Peikoff 1991).\n\nThus while Rand is a direct realist in the sense explained above, she is not a naive realist in the sense of regarding all perceived attributes as enjoying equal extramental status. It is possible for us to misidentify features of a perception's form as belonging to its content (and presumably vice versa). But Rand does not regard this fact as impugning the reliability of the senses, since the judgment that a particular feature belongs to a perception's content rather than its form is not contributed by the perception itself but is a volitionally, fallibly formed conceptual response to that perception.\n\nNor is the existence of features belonging to the form rather than the content of perception indicative of any flaw in our perceptual faculties. On the contrary, every process must have some definite nature and occur by some definite means; thus it is inevitable, on Rand's view, that the way objects appear to us should depend on the nature of our perceptual organs. The fact that the form of our knowledge is partly determined by the means by which it is acquired does not invalidate its status as knowledge. To assume otherwise would be, in effect, to conclude that \u201cyou can know nothing, because you know it by means of something\u201d\u2014that you are \u201cblind \u2026 because you have eyes, and deaf \u2026 because you have ears\u201d (1997, p. 655). Nor, again, should the discovery that attributes like color are not intrinsic features of entities be taken to imply their subjectivity. Inasmuch as such attributes depend not on consciousness alone but rather on the relationship between consciousness and its objects, they are neither intrinsic nor subjective, but rather objective. (Thus an entity can exist intrinsically even if some of its attributes exist only objectively.)\n\nRand rejects Kant's idea of innate conceptual categories on the grounds that it confuses the form of thought with the object and content of thought, thus cutting us off from reality (IOE, Ch. 8). Some critics, however, see Rand's own distinction as strikingly reminiscent of Kant (Walsh 2000). Other charges raised against Rand's epistemology include: making the reliability of perception vacuous (since nothing counts as perception unless it's accurate); assuming a foundationalist approach that conflates the perceptual process by which judgments are formed with the way in which they are to be justified; and leaving it unclear how judgments with propositional structure can be validated by sensory data lacking such structure (Dipert 1987; Long 2000). On the positive side, several philosophers have developed Rand's theory of perception in a way that successfully engages with problems in contemporary analytic epistemology (Kelley 1986; Ghate 2012; Salmieri 2012).\n\nThe process of differentiation and integration that begins at the perceptual level continues at the level of concept-formation, as we selectively attend to certain attributes of an entity, discriminate it from entities lacking those attributes, and mentally group it together with entities that share the attributes. This makes it possible to treat entities as units, that is, as members of a group (Rand 1990a; Kelley 1984; Kelley and Krueger 1984; Peikoff 1991). An entity's status as a unit is not intrinsic, since the basis of its status is our mental process of differentiation and integration. But neither is its status subjective, because the process is based on actually existing similarities and differences. Its status is, therefore, objective. Consequently, Rand rejects as a false dichotomy the debate between realists and nominalists over the nature of universals. (\u201cRealism,\u201d as a theory about universals, is to be distinguished from the kind of perceptual realism that Rand accepts.) Rand identifies universals with concepts, understood as attributes of consciousness, and so repudiates the intrinsicism of the realists; for Rand, the problem of universals belongs to epistemology, not to metaphysics. But because she takes concepts to be objective in her sense, Rand likewise distinguishes her theory from nominalism, which she interprets as a subjectivist approach to universals.\n\nAttributes can also be regarded as units. This makes possible the process of measurement, which involves relating perceptible attribute-units to larger or smaller quantities, including those too large or too small to perceive, thus permitting the expansion of our knowledge beyond the perceptual level. Measurement is here understood broadly, as covering ordinal as well as cardinal relationships, and thus applies to all concepts, not just narrowly quantitative ones. Concepts expand the range of our knowledge by reducing the number of units with which we must deal.\n\nRand holds a \u201cmeasurement-omission\u201d theory of abstraction; that is, she regards concept-formation as a matter of grouping items together on the basis of a commensurable characteristic while omitting the specific measurements (e.g., grouping red objects together while omitting specific shades of red). Such abstraction does not falsify its objects, as in omitting specific measurements we do not claim that they do not exist, we merely fail to specify them. The similarities on the basis of which we form our earliest concepts are perceptually identified; more sophisticated concepts involve conceptually identified similarities.\n\nThe extramental attributes on the basis of which we form our concepts are presumably intended by Rand to be particulars, not universals (since otherwise she would be a traditional realist). But Rand says little about the metaphysical status of the \u201csimilarity\u201d or \u201csameness\u201d that we identify among such attribute-particulars. Theories of universals traditionally seek to account both for generic identity across specific difference (e.g., how redness applies to two distinct shades of red), and specific identity across numerical difference (e.g., how a specific shade of red applies to two particulars of that shade). Rand's theory of measurement-omission seems primarily intended to address the former issue, and she has little to say about the latter. Rand's insistence that everything in reality is particular has been taken by critics as undermining the possibility of the mind-independent similarities needed to ground the objectivity of concepts (for how can two objects be similar if there's nothing real that they share in common?). But it is possible that Rand would regard similarities as themselves being relational property-particulars or tropes, rather than universals, so that the canine-similarity between Fido and Lassie would be a different particular from the canine-similarity between Lassie and Snoopy.\n\nAbstractions, once formed, are \u201copen-ended,\u201d applying not just to the specific concretes from which they were formed but to all concretes of the same kind. The characteristics on the basis of which items are conceptually grouped should be essential, that is, explanatorily fundamental; but since Rand regards explanation as an epistemological rather than a metaphysical category, essences are objective, not intrinsic. These essential characteristics determine the definition of the concept; however, the meaning of a concept lies not in its definition but in its referents, where membership in the class of referents is determined not by anything like Fregean \u201csense,\u201d but rather by a prospective member's fundamental similarities (whether as yet known or unknown) to the original concretes on which the concept is based. The test of whether to include a new instance under a concept is ultimately not whether it fits the existing definition but whether it is of the same kind as the instances already established. Definitions are context-relative and can change in response to new discoveries without requiring a change in the concept itself; thus continuity of reference can be preserved across revision in definitions. Hence Rand rejects the analytic-synthetic distinction; that is, she denies any significant difference in metaphysical or modal status, as well as in means of being known, between those characteristics of a class that are and those that are not mentioned in the definition. Despite various differences, Rand's overall discussion of reference obviously bears intriguing similarities to the realist theories of reference developed by Saul Kripke and Hilary Putnam during the 1970s, although Rand developed her ideas independently, their earliest statement appearing in the 1966\u20131967 issues of her periodical The Objectivist.\n\nCritics have objected that Rand offers no argument against the possibility that some concepts may have their referents determined by the definition (Browne 2000; Long 2005a, 2005b). Rand describes the meaning of \u201ccapitalism,\u201d for example, as \u201cfull, pure, uncontrolled, unregulated laissez-faire\u201d (1964a, p. 33). Since Rand does not regard such as a system as ever having existed, it's hard to see how the concept of \u201ccapitalism\u201d could have been formed on the basis of its referents (what referents?). If instead Rand's definition of \u201ccapitalism\u201d serves as the criterion to determine what would count as a referent, then some statements will be \u201ctrue by definition\u201d after all, thereby potentially resurrecting the analytic-synthetic distinction.\n\nConcepts (or attempts at concepts) that group their purported referents according to non-essential or inconsistent characteristics, or otherwise embody mistaken presuppositions\u2014such as \u201cextremism,\u201d which implicitly treats any consistent or thoroughgoing conviction as bad, regardless of its content\u2014are invalid and cannot be rationally used. In Rand's view, such \u201canti-concepts\u201d or \u201cpackage deals\u201d are frequently employed as an ideological strategy to hinder people's ability to grasp politically inconvenient concepts. (It's worth noting that Rand's novella Anthem (1938), about a collectivist society that deliberately distorts the use of language in order to prevent the development of individualist thinking\u2014replacing all uses of \u201cI\u201d with \u201cwe,\u201d for example\u2014predates by over a decade George Orwell's use of a similar idea in Nineteen Eighty-Four.) Judgments that deny their own conceptual presuppositions are likewise invalid. The possibility that all of our experience is a dream, for example, is rejected as what Rand calls a \u201cstolen concept\u201d fallacy, since possession of the concept \u201cdream\u201d presupposes the ability to distinguish dreaming from waking. This is because genuine possession of a concept requires both the ability to derive an abstraction from concretes and the ability to go on to apply it to new concretes; if all our experience were a dream, the concept of waking could neither be derived from nor applied to any concretes. Those who claim to have grasped a concept but are unable to recognize instances of it \u201chave not performed either part of the cycle: neither the abstraction nor the translating of the abstraction into the concrete.\u201d As with an electric circuit, \u201cno part of it can be of any use, until and unless the cycle is completed\u201d (Journal entry for 4 May 1946, in 1997, p. 481).\n\nThus many people who appear to be operating at the conceptual level may not in fact be fully doing so. Rand appeals to this \u201canti-conceptual mentality\u201d\u2014the result of laziness or miseducation\u2014to explain the prevalence of thoughtless social conformity, since those who have not mastered higher abstractions are compelled to navigate the social world by imitating the concrete behavior of other people. In other words, for an anti-conceptual mentality a concept like \u201cjustice\u201d would simply refer to the concrete practices that people in a given society engage in when they use the term, thereby forestalling the possibility of any critical reflection on the actual justice of those practices (1982a, ch. 4; 1999a, ch. 3).\n\nEpistemologically, the most important concepts are those Rand identifies as axiomatic concepts. (Axioms themselves are secondary, being propositional expressions of the corresponding concepts, which themselves are non-propositional.) The three axiomatic concepts to which Rand devotes the most attention are existence, identity, and consciousness. These three, she tells us, are implicit in all knowledge, and cannot be rejected without being relied upon in the course of the attempted rejection. Unlike ordinary concepts, they are not susceptible of definition (except ostensively), because there are no more basic concepts in terms of which they could be defined. Nor are the axioms that express them susceptible of proof, since they are presupposed by all proof (Rand 1990a; Peikoff 1991).\n\nThe concept of existence identifies as basic and unquestionable the fact that something exists; to ask for a cause or explanation of there being something rather than nothing is to misunderstand the place of existence in the hierarchy of concepts. (This is one of Rand's reasons for rejecting the idea of a divine creator as the cause of the universe; though it is a matter of dispute whether this objection works if such a creator is merely supposed to be responsible for the existence of everything other than itself.) Rand's expression of this concept in propositional form, as the axiom that \u201cexistence exists,\u201d is intended not as the mere tautological observation that \u201cwhatever exists, exists,\u201d but rather as a recognition that something does indeed exist.\n\nThe concept of identity identifies the fact that everything that exists is some kind of thing or other\u2014that it has a specific, non-contradictory nature. This concept\u2014which Rand often expresses in propositional form as the Law of Identity, \u201cA is A\u201d\u2014has as a corollary the principle of causality: since everything has a specific nature, a thing can act only in ways consistent with that nature.\n\nFinally, the concept of consciousness identifies the fact that consciousness exists; Rand agrees with the Cartesian view that one cannot coherently deny the existence of one's own consciousness. Unlike Descartes, however, Rand denies the \u201cprior certainty of consciousness,\u201d i.e., the idea that we can be aware of the contents of our own minds without knowing whether any extramental reality corresponds to them; for Rand, there can be no content without an external reality. Rand regards consciousness as inherently relational: to be conscious is to be conscious of something beyond one's own consciousness, and of one's consciousness itself only secondarily.\n\nExistence has primacy over consciousness both epistemologically and metaphysically (with the latter explaining the former): epistemologically, because consciousness has to be aware of a distinct object before it can be aware of itself; metaphysically, because consciousness is a response to its objects and so cannot precede them\u2014thus ruling out metaphysical theories like theism and idealism that, in Rand's view, make existence dependent on consciousness.\n\nFrom the fact that consciousness\u2014both perceptual and conceptual\u2014is an active and causally complex process, it does not follow that it is creative or distortive with regard to its objects. To suppose otherwise, Rand holds\u2014to demand that consciousness, in order to be in contact with reality, must be purely passive and not involve any sort of processing\u2014is to object to consciousness on the absurd grounds that it has a specific identity and employs specific means, and thus, once again, to regard us as blind because we have eyes and deaf because we have ears.\n\nAccording to Rand, as we've seen, our senses cannot deceive us; and in forming conceptual judgments on the basis of sensory evidence, we can be deceived only if we allow ourselves to fall into inattention or evasion. Hence certainty is always available to us. But while Rand takes knowledge to require certainty, she distinguishes certainty from infallibility or inerrancy: a judgment can be certain, within a given context of available knowledge, even if it needs to be revised in the light of new information. Peikoff interprets Rand to hold that, so long as a contextual qualifier is understood to be implicit in one's judgments at each stage (e.g., \u201cSo far as can be determined in the light of present knowledge \u2026\u201d), the revised judgments need not contradict the original ones (Peikoff 1991). But this is a problematic notion, and Rand herself never makes any statement to this effect.\n\nRand rejects both dogmatism (asserting knowledge or demanding assent in the absence of contextually sufficient evidence) and skepticism (denying knowledge, or demanding the withholding of assent, in the presence of contextually sufficient evidence). Mysticism\u2014in the sense of claims to a non-rational, non-sensory mode of knowledge\u2014is likewise rejected as a form of dogmatism. The application of logic\u2014the \u201cart of non-contradictory identification\u201d\u2014to sensory data should be the sole ultimate determinant of belief.\n\nRand's conception of the role of metaphysics is fairly minimalist; its task is the investigation of the most general features of existence as such\u2014of \u201cbeing qua being,\u201d in Aristotle's phrase. Hence a great deal of traditionally metaphysical inquiry into the specific characteristics of the universe and its constituents she regards as properly the province of the special sciences rather than philosophy. Moreover, consistent with her conviction that many of the central issues of philosophy turn on phenomena that are properly to be understood as objective rather than intrinsic, she tends to assign a broader role to epistemology than to metaphysics. For Rand, metaphysics tells us that entities have definite natures, epistemology tells us how to investigate those natures, and the special sciences then do the actual investigating.\n\nNevertheless, Rand does take a stand on a number of metaphysical questions more specific than the priority of existence to consciousness or of entities to attributes. For example, Rand denies the possibility of actualized infinities (as opposed to potential infinities, in the Aristotelian sense of processes that can be continued indefinitely), on the grounds that the axiom of identity requires every magnitude to be of some definite measurable extent. On the other hand, Rand maintains that given the character of existence as basic and unquestionable, it makes no sense to think of reality as a whole coming into or going out of existence; the universe is a fundamental fact that cannot be created or destroyed but has always existed. It's not clear whether Rand holds that the universe is infinitely old (a position that would seem to sit oddly with her denial of actualized infinities\u2014though of course Aristotle held the same combination of views), or only that it was not preceded by a temporal period of nothingness (a potentially distinct claim if one holds, as Rand does, that the passage of time requires change).\n\nBut most of Rand's more specific metaphysical theses have to do with the nature of one particular type of entities\u2014human beings. Rand regards human beings, and indeed living organisms generally, as teleologically ordered systems, though her teleology takes a naturalized form that makes no essential reference to purposiveness; her point is simply that organisms depend for their existence on the successful carrying out\u2014conscious or otherwise\u2014of self-maintenance activities, and so are necessarily organized around the goal of furthering their life functions. Rand rejects both substance dualism and reductive materialism, holding that a human being is an integrated unit of mind and body, a unified entity, with mental characteristics neither separable from nor fully explicable in terms of physical ones. (Whether Rand's position is best identified as property dualism, nonreductive physicalism, or neither is unclear.)\n\nConsciousness is not epiphenomenal, but rather is causally efficacious\u2014or, perhaps more precisely, human beings are causally efficacious in virtue, inter alia, of possessing consciousness; we know this on the basis of direct experience. Moreover, while perception is automatic, at the conceptual level the operation of consciousness is free from causal necessitation. The reality of incompatibilist free will is axiomatic, since the conceptual tools needed to question its reality presuppose our volitional command over our thought-processes, and in particular, our ability to raise or lower our level of mental alertness\u2014inasmuch as our ability to judge whether we are reasoning correctly presupposes that our thinking is not directed by factors beyond our knowledge and control (N. Branden 1971).[3]\n\nFree choices are not uncaused, since for Rand actions (in general, not just human actions) are caused not by prior events but by the natures of the entities involved. There is even a sense in which free choices are necessitated\u2014namely, it is necessary that human beings, given their nature as conscious rational beings, make free choices, though it is not necessary that they choose this rather than that.\n\nBeyond the realm of human choice, however, Rand regards all facts and events as necessary and \u201cmetaphysically given.\u201d Rand seems to consider this position a corollary of the primacy of existence, though it is unclear, given Rand's exception for human choice, why there could not also be entities whose nature was such as to behave probabilistically, as postulated by many interpretations of quantum physics. (By contrast, the distinct view that a quantum particle's present state is merely probabilistic clashes much more obviously with the primacy of existence.)\n\nEthics \u201cis a code of values to guide man's choices and actions\u2014the choices and actions that determine the purpose and the course of his life\u201d (1961b, p. 13). Before we can decide which code of values we should accept, we need to ask why we need a code of values at all. Rand claims that no philosopher before her has provided a scientific answer to this question, and so none has provided a satisfactory ethics.\n\nRand starts by describing value or \u201cthe good,\u201d in classical fashion, as the object of pursuit: \u201cthat which one acts to gain and/or keep\u201d (1961b, p. 16). Thus, the concept of value presupposes the concept of \u201can entity capable of acting to achieve a goal in the face of an alternative\u201d\u2014and the basic alternative facing any living entity is life or death (p. 16). It is the conditional nature of life that gives rise to values, not just human values, but values as such. As she puts it: \u201cMetaphysically, life is the only phenomenon that is an end in itself: a value gained and kept by a constant process of action\u201d (p. 18). Survival is the organism's ultimate value, the \u201cfinal goal or end to which all [its] lesser goals are the means,\u201d and the standard of all its other values: \u201cthat which furthers its life is the good, that which threatens it is the evil\u201d (pp. 16\u201317). The same, suitably modified, applies to human beings. Life is the standard and goal of all genuine human values, in the sense that all of them \u2014 from food to philosophy to fine art to ethics\u2014must be explained and justified as requirements of human survival. \u201cEthics is an objective, metaphysical necessity of man's survival\u201d (p. 24). Thus, \u201c[t]he standard of value of the Objectivist ethics \u2026 is man's life, or: that which is required for man's survival qua man\u201d (p. 25), that is, \u201cthe terms, methods, conditions and goals required for the survival of a rational being through the whole of his lifespan\u2014in all those aspects of existence which are open to his choice\u201d (p. 27). To choose to live is to accept one's \u201cown life\u201d as one's \u201cethical purpose.\u201d\n\nRand's metaphysical arguments make two points central to her axiology and ethics. (1) Values are not just a human phenomenon but a phenomenon of life: life necessitates value. Thus, values are neither intrinsic properties of things, nor subjective, neither free-floating Platonic entities, nor mere matters of desire or preference, culture or time. Rather, values are relational or objective, dependent on the nature of the valuing entity and the nature of its environment. (2) An entity's values are determined by its objective life-needs, the requirements of survival for entities of its kind, and ethics is a requirement of human survival.\n\nRand seeks to bolster this claim by arguing that the concept of value entails the concept of life: \u201cepistemologically, the concept of \u2018value\u2019 is genetically dependent upon and derived from the antecedent concept of \u2018life\u2019\u201d (1961b, p. 18). She supports it by asking us \u201cto imagine an immortal, indestructible robot, an entity which moves and acts, but which cannot be affected by anything, which cannot be changed in any respect, which cannot be damaged, injured or destroyed\u201d (p. 16). Such an entity, she concludes, cannot have values.\n\nCritics raise two objections to this argument. (i) It begs the question by assuming what is at issue, namely, that a non-living entity cannot be harmed (Nozick 1971). Unlike the robot of this example, real robots can be damaged or destroyed, not only by external events, but also by a failure to perform their functions well, that is, by their own actions or inactions. Hence they can, quite straightforwardly, be said to have values. [4] (ii) Even if one were to accept that the concept of value entails the concept of life, one could consistently regard one's survival as a means to a certain kind of life: a life of dedication to the greater glory of God, the common good, the environment, and so on (Mack 1984).\n\nRand's naturalism, and her rejection of intrinsicism and subjectivism in favor of objectivism, anticipate recent naturalisms and echo Aristotle's argument, against both the Platonist and the subjectivist, that \u201cthe good\u201d must always be good-for-something. Her conception of the function of morality is notable both for its affinity to, and its difference from, Thomas Hobbes' conception: like Hobbes, Rand sees morality as a necessary means to long-term survival, but unlike Hobbes, she does not see morality as requiring a contract or even as a fundamentally social affair. The need for morality, according to Rand, is dictated by our nature as creatures that must think and produce to survive; hence we would need morality even on a desert island. There is, however, no duty to survive; morality is based on a hypothetical imperative: if you choose to live, then you must value your own long-term survival as an ultimate end, and morality as a necessary means to it. (The much-debated question of whether the choice to live is a moral choice (Mack 1984, 2003; Long 2000; Rasmussen 2002) or a pre-moral one (Peikoff 1991; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000, 2006), and the implications of either position for the objectivity of Rand's Objectivist ethics must, unfortunately, be left undiscussed.) If asked why the choice to live commits you to your own long-term survival rather than some other ultimate end (such as, for example, the greatest happiness of the greatest number (Nozick 1971), or becoming worthy of eternal life in heaven), the answer is: because any other ultimate end, if consistently adhered to, would lead to death.\n\nRand's ethics is thus firmly teleological, this-worldly, and foundationalist. Virtue is \u201cthe act by which one gains/and or keeps\u201d values in light of a recognition of certain facts (1961b, pp. 27, 28); it \u201cis not an end in itself \u2026 not its own reward\u201d (1957, p. 939). A fact central to a \u201cscientific\u201d ethics is that reason is the chief indispensable human tool of survival, and we exercise reason by choice. Hence rationality is the fundamental moral virtue, a virtue implicated in all the other virtues, including productiveness (Section 3.4 below).\n\nRand is widely credited by Objectivists (Peikoff 1991; Binswanger 1990, 1992; Kelley & Thomas 1999 (Other Internet Resources); Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000, 2006) with having solved the is-ought problem by showing that the requirements of long-term survival as a rational being determine the content of morality, and so anyone who chooses to live ought to be moral (1961b, p. 19). But if the choice to live is itself a moral choice, in the sense that we ought to choose to live, then the argument proceeds from an ought to an ought, not from an is to an ought. On the other hand, if the choice to live is a non-moral choice (an idea that's had to reconcile with Rand's general view that all significant choices are moral choices), then suicide can never be wrong, even if it is done for cowardly, irresponsible, or unjust reasons, a view that seems incoherent.\n\nRelatedly, how should we understand the idea of survival as a rational being\u2014the life \u201cproper to a rational being\u201d (p. 27). Is survival as a rational being a necessary means to literal, long-term survival? Or is such survival itself the ultimate goal, something to be created and preserved for its own sake? Again, what are we to make of the many passages in which Rand states that the ultimate goal is one's own happiness?\n\nRand herself thought that she had only one, consistent metaethical view: the ultimate goal is the individual's own survival; the only way to survive long-term, i.e., over a complete life-span, is to live by the standard of man's life as a rational being, which means: to live morally; and happiness is the psychological \u201cresult, reward and concomitant\u201d (p. 32) of living thus. Many of Rand's commentators follow her in holding that there is only one consistent view, while disagreeing on the right interpretation of it (Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1978, 1984b; Machan 1984, 2000; Peikoff 1991; Bidinotto 1994; Hunt 1999; Kelley & Thomas 1999 (Other Internet Resources); Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000, 2006). Others (Mack 1984; Badhwar 1999, 2001; Long 2000) argue that Rand's writings actually allow of three, or at least two, mutually incompatible views of the ultimate goal, and our task is to see which of these is the dominant or most plausible view. The three views are: survival, survival qua rational being, and happiness in the ancient Aristotelian sense of flourishing or eudaimonia. In the rest of Section 3, we will present the textual evidence for each of these views of the final goal, and the common objections to them, in turn.\n\nThe survivalist view holds that just as literal survival is the ultimate value for other living entities, so it is for human beings (Kelley & Thomas 1999; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000). Survival is the source and final goal of all the actions of an entity, that which gives point to all its other values. For human beings, happiness, intellectual and artistic pursuits and rationality/morality are all means to survival. The vicious can \u201cachieve their goals [only] for the range of a moment,\u201d as evidenced by \u201cany criminal or any dictatorship\u201d (1961b, p. 26). Even those whose vice consists of imitating others rather than looting them live a precarious existence because they are likely to follow any destroyer who promises to be their savior (p. 25).\n\n\u201cNon-survivalists\u201d make the following objections:\n\nThe biological premise that survival is the ultimate goal of all living things is mistaken. Animals of many species risk their own death for the sake of reproduction, or for protecting their young or even their group. But even if survival were the ultimate goal of other species, it need not be ours. Even if our own survival needs were the source of all our values, it would not follow that survival must be the ultimate psychological and moral goal to which all our other values are merely necessary means. The genesis of x does not logically determine the ultimate goal of x. The survivalist view that turns happiness into a mere means to survival entails, quite implausibly, that a long, unhappy life is better than a somewhat shorter but happy life, and just as good as a long and happy one. Many dictators, including the Pharaohs of the past and the Stalins and Maos of the 20th century, have survived by making elaborate plans to preserve their lives and their power by using a combination of terror, myth, and bribery. So have many common criminals. So even if morality enhances our chances of survival, it cannot be necessary for survival. Under some circumstances, such as in a dictatorial system, acting morally decreases our chances of survival, a point that Rand herself convincingly dramatizes in We the Living and Anthem. Rand is right to point out (as was Hobbes) that if everyone or most people were to start preying on each other, then no one would survive for long\u2014literally, and that generations of predators would end up destroying or driving away the producers, and thus destroying themselves (Anthem and Atlas Shrugged). But survivalism rests on an illicit move from what the generic \u201cman\u201d (alone in the world) must do to survive to what particular men (in a society of producers) need to do. A survivalist ethics can support, at best, a bare-bones Hobbesian morality, not a virtue ethics. If Rand's virtues were necessary for survival, the human species would have perished a long time ago, instead of expanding exponentially. Her rich and challenging picture of human life and virtue in her novels points to a richer and more challenging conception of the final end than mere survival. Many of Rand's heroes, from Kira (We the Living) to Prometheus (Anthem) to John Galt (Atlas Shrugged), risk their lives for the sake of the values that make their lives worth living. Rand herself sometimes acknowledges that evil people can survive by free-riding (\u201chitch-hiking,\u201d as she calls it) on rational, productive people: \u201cIf some men attempt to survive by means of brute force or fraud \u2026 it still remains true that their survival is made possible only by their victims, only by the men who choose to think and to produce the goods which they, the looters, are seizing\u201d (1961b, p. 25). Rand often says that the final end is survival proper to a human being (1961b, p. 26), or that the final end is happiness (1961b, pp. 27, 30). Neither can be reduced to survival.\n\nJust as the standard of value is survival qua human being, so the ultimate goal is one's own survival qua human being. To accept this standard and goal is to accept (i) the three cardinal values of reason, purpose (or purposiveness) and self-esteem as not only \u201cthe means to\u201d but also \u201cthe realization of one's ultimate value, one's own life\u201d (1961b, p. 27), and (ii) the three \u201ccorresponding virtues\u201d of rationality, productiveness, and pride. These values are means to one's life insofar as they further one's life as a rational being, and they realize it insofar as they express the value we place on our lives.\n\nWhat it means to value survival qua human being turns on the relationship of the three cardinal values to the three virtues. Rand often states that virtue is only a means to value. But when she explains how the three cardinal values \u201ccorrespond\u201d to their three virtues, she does not provide a means-end analysis (Badhwar 1999, 2001). Thus, she says:\n\n\u201cProductive work is the central purpose of a rational man's life, the central value that integrates and determines the hierarchy of all his other values. Reason is the source, the precondition of his productive work\u2014pride is the result.\u201d\n\nThe virtue of productiveness becomes the central example of purpose (one of the three cardinal values), reason (another cardinal value) becomes its source, and the virtue of pride becomes its result. Rand also defines rationality, which is \u201cthe basic virtue,\u201d in terms of \u201cthe recognition and acceptance of reason as one's only source of knowledge \u2026 and one's only guide to action\u201d (p. 28). By this definition, being rational means valuing reason in thought, word, and deed, and realizing reason in one's life means being rational: the virtue and the value entail each other.\n\nThis point generalizes to all the virtues and values. Further, since the (cardinal) values are both \u201cthe means to\u201d and \u201cthe realization of one's ultimate value\u201d (p. 27), it follows that the (cardinal) virtues are also both the means to and the realization of one's ultimate value: long-term survival qua human being. On this interpretation, to survive qua human being is none other than to lead a virtuous life in which one has realized one's potential.\n\nBoth survivalists and eudaimonists, however, point out that this conception of the final end contradicts Rand's oft-repeated claim that \u201cVirtue is not an end in itself.\u2026\u201d In addition, eudaimonists make the following objections:\n\nSince even a long, virtuous life need not be a happy one, positing it as the final end contradicts Rand's related claim that \u201cLife is the reward of virtue\u2014and happiness is the goal and reward of life\u201d (1957, p. 939). It contradicts Rand's conception of the final end in her novels, where happiness is proclaimed as \u201cthe purpose, the sanction and the meaning of life\u201d (1957, p. 674).\n\nEudaimonists hold that the dominant and/or more plausible view expressed in Rand's writings is that happiness is the ultimate value, where happiness is understood as a state that necessarily involves virtue, but is not identical with virtue (Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1978, 1984b; Machan 1984, 2000; Mack 1984; Badhwar 1999, 2001; Hunt 1999; Long 2000).\n\nHappiness is the existentially and psychologically \u201csuccessful state of life\u201d (1961b, p. 27). As an emotion it is not simply a positive subjective state, as on some contemporary views, but an emotion that meets certain normative standards: \u201ca state of non-contradictory joy\u2014a joy without penalty or guilt,\u201d achievable only by \u201cthe man who desires nothing but rational goals, seeks nothing but rational values and finds his joy in nothing but rational actions\u201d (p. 32). Happiness is also a form of life-affirmation: \u201cthe feeling of one's blessing upon the whole of the earth, the feeling of being in love with the fact that one exists and in this kind of world\u201d (1957, pp. 105\u20136). Thus, happiness is an objectively worthwhile and emotionally positive state.\n\nRand holds that the pursuit of happiness is inseparable from the activity of maintaining one's life through the rational pursuit of rational goals (1961b, pp. 29, 32). A virtuous life is, thus, essential to happiness. It is also a shield against soul-wracking unhappiness. Just as even great misfortunes don't throw Aristotle's virtuous individual into misery, they don't throw Rand's heroes into misery. Even at the worst of times, the virtuous individual's pain \u201conly goes down to a certain point\u201d (1943, p. 344), never touching the core of her being: the self-esteem that consists of the conviction that she is worthy and capable of happiness.[5]\n\nIn keeping with their richer conception of the final end, Rand's novels also employ a richer conception of virtue as an integrated intellectual-emotional character trait to think, feel, and act in certain ways, rather than simply as an act in light of a recognition of certain facts (Badhwar 1999, 2001). Her characters reveal their souls not only in what they say or do, notice or fail to notice, focus on or evade, but in their cognitive, emotional, and action dispositions, their style of being in the world. Their actions show not only an intellectual commitment to the right but a wholehearted \u201clove of rectitude\u201d (1957, p. 512).\n\nThis basically Aristotelian view of virtue goes hand-in-hand with a basically Aristotelian view of emotions. Rand rejects the reason-emotion dichotomy as stemming, ultimately, from a false mind-body dichotomy. Emotions are neither raw feelings nor inherently irrational but automatized value-judgments: \u201cestimates of that which furthers man's values or threatens them \u2026 lightning calculators giving him the sum of his profit or loss\u201d (1961b, p. 27). Emotions provide instant guidance when circumstances do not permit reasoning everything out anew. But our emotions are only as good as our reason, because they are \u201cprogrammed\u201d by our reason. Hence they can only be corrected by conscious reasoning, and in a conflict between reason and emotions, one must always side with the former.[6]\n\nEudaimonists argue that Rand's vision of a virtuous and happy life in her novels can be understood only as a form of eudaimonism, even if she often makes statements inconsistent with this vision. But eudaimonism faces the following objections:\n\nIn defining happiness partly in terms of virtue, eudaimonism employs an unconvincing conception of happiness. Given its conception of happiness, eudaimonism cannot, without circularity, regard happiness as the standard of virtue, but neither does it have any other standard on offer. In addition, a naturalistic eudaimonism must show a connection between our survival needs and our values and virtues.\n\nThe chief Objectivist virtues are rationality, integrity, honesty (with self and others), justice, independence, productiveness, and pride. Rationality, \u201cone's total commitment \u2026 to the maintenance of a full mental focus in all issues, in all choices \u2026 to the fullest perception of reality within one's power\u201d (1961b, p. 28), is the basic virtue of which the other virtues are aspects or derivatives. The virtues are thus united or reciprocal. Each virtue is defined partly in terms of a recognition and whole-hearted commitment to some fact or facts, a commitment understood by the agent to be indispensable for gaining, maintaining, or expressing her ultimate value. For example, integrity is \u201cthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake your consciousness\u201d (1957, p. 936), a recognition that is expressed in loyalty to one's rational values and convictions, especially in the face of social pressures to surrender them (1961b, p. 28; 1964a, pp. 52, 80); honesty is \u201cthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake existence,\u201d a recognition that is expressed in truthfulness in thought and speech (1957, pp. 936\u201337); and justice is \u201cthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake the character of men as you cannot fake the character of nature, \u2026 that every man must be judged for what he is and treated accordingly\u2026\u201d (1957, p. 937).\n\nConspicuous by their absence from Rand's list of the cardinal virtues are the \u201cvirtues of benevolence\u201d, such as kindness, charity, generosity, and forgiveness. Rand states that charity is not a major virtue or moral duty (1964b); likewise, presumably, kindness, generosity, and forgiveness. Whether, and how much, one should help others depends on their place in one's rationally defined hierarchy of values, and on the particular circumstances (whether they are worthy of help, what the likely consequences are of helping them, and so on). The greater their value vis-\u00e0-vis one's rational self-interest, the greater the help that one should be willing to give, ceteris paribus. What is never morally appropriate is making sacrifices, that is, surrendering something of value to oneself for the sake of something of less or no value to oneself. Thus, it can never be moral to knowingly risk one's life for a stranger (unless, of course, one's life is no longer worth living) or to court unhappiness for the happiness of another, whether stranger or friend.\n\nOne might ask why charity etc. are not just as major virtues when they do meet all the conditions of appropriateness: the recipient is worthy of help, one can afford to help, it is in one's rational self-interest (or not contrary to it) to help, and so on. Perhaps Rand thinks that they are \u201cminor\u201d virtues because all the conditions for exercising them are only sometimes met. But this idea is debatable. A deeper reason for her relegation of kindness etc. to the status of minor virtues, however, might be her conception of people as essentially agents rather than patients, doers rather than receivers, self-sufficient rather than dependent. Nevertheless, Rand's view of the unity of the virtues dictates that, even if we do not need to act on these virtues at all times, they are just as important to possess as the other virtues. Moreover, in keeping with her emphasis on the importance of goodwill towards others and \u201cthe benevolent universe premise,\u201d Rand's heroes are often extraordinarily (and almost always appropriately) kind and generous, not only to those they love but also to mere acquaintances, and even sometimes adversaries (Badhwar 1993b). Striking examples include, from The Fountainhead, Howard Roark's unsought-for attempt to give hope and courage to Steven Mallory, the gifted young sculptor whose failure to get work has driven him to the verge of a spiritual and physical collapse; Roark's unreproachful help to his erstwhile adversary, Peter Keating, when Keating falls on hard times; and from Atlas Shrugged, Dagny's support to a heart-broken and despairing Cheryl Taggart who, in the past, has treated Dagny with scorn; and Hank Rearden's generosity towards his exploitative family before he realizes their exploitativeness.[7] By contrast, Rand's villains lack genuine goodwill towards others and, thus, lack true kindness or generosity.\n\nJust as rationality, a focus on reality, is at the heart of every virtue, so irrationality, evasion of reality (including self-deception), is at the heart of every vice. Rand's villains are all master evaders motivated by a desire for power, social status, fame, or unearned wealth, and resentment of the good. They are \u201csecond-handers\u201d\u2014people whose primary relationship is to other people rather than to reality. Between the virtuous and the vicious are the \u201cinnocently wrong,\u201d people who adopt wrong moral principles or make wrong choices, not through evasion but through an error of judgment (Rand does not explicitly recognize any moral category other than virtue, vice, and moral error, although her novels portray characters that do not easily fit into any of these categories). Hank Rearden, in Atlas Shrugged, is the great innocent living under a burden of unearned guilt because of his mistaken sense of honor and his charity towards a family interested only in manipulating and using him. Cheryl Taggart is killed by the too-sudden revelation that the man she loved and admired as the embodiment of her ideals is a fraud\u2014and that the world is full of such frauds.\n\nAs already indicated, Rand justifies virtue in both instrumental and non-instrumental terms, though without distinguishing between them. The instrumental arguments show the existential and psychological rewards of virtue and costs of vice. Virtue creates a sense of inner harmony and enables mutually beneficial interactions with others. Evasiveness, by contrast, traps one in a \u201ctangled web\u201d of rationalizations and pretenses. The evader who deceives others is either eventually caught, or lives in fear of being caught, becoming dependent on others' unconsciousness. He is \u201ca fool,\u201d says a character in Atlas Shrugged, \u201cwhose source of values is the fools he succeeds in fooling\u201d (1957, p. 945). There is also a psychological reason why evasiveness is contrary to the evader's self-interest: Rand holds, like Sartre, that no evasion is completely successful, because the truth constantly threatens to resurface. Hence, the evader's \u201cdiseased soul\u201d is in a state of constant inner conflict and anxiety as he tries to suppress his awareness of uncomfortable truths while maintaining his hold on others. His lack of integrity and of esteem for reality results in a lack of self-love or self-esteem and, indeed, of a solid self. (It is noteworthy, however, that her portrayal of Gail Wynand in The Fountainhead is closer to Aristotle's portrayal of the vicious man in Book III of the Nicomachean Ethics as someone who is \u201cunconscious of his vice,\u201d than to her own stated view of the evader.)\n\nThese views are familiar from the history of philosophy, but many readers find their expression in Rand's novels to be of unusual psychological depth, subtlety, and conviction. Nevertheless, the views are subject to the well-known objection that the complexity and variability of human psychology and society allow only \u201cfor the most part\u201d generalizations about the existential and psychological benefits of virtue or costs of vice. Thus, it is possible for a small injustice to lead to great rewards, especially since others are willing to shrug off or forgive occasional transgressions. It is also possible for poor introspection, forgetfulness, or self-acceptance to allow one to evade something without any need for supporting evasions or damage to one's self-esteem. Again, even if every wrongdoing carries psychological costs, they might sometimes be outweighed by the long-term costs of doing the right thing (as Rand herself suggests in her portrayal of the embittered Henry Cameron and Stephen Mallory in The Fountainhead).\n\nThe non-instrumentalist justification of virtue in Rand's novels is largely immune to these objections (though subject to the objections noted in 3.4 above). To compromise morally is, necessarily, to compromise one's own happiness, because no existential loss can compare to the loss of moral integrity. Rectitude is partly constitutive of genuine happiness because it expresses the right relationship to reality: to existence, to oneself, and to others. For the same reason, it is partly constitutive of a self worth loving, an ideally human or rational self. Like Plato and Aristotle, Rand argues that virtue necessarily creates inner harmony and certitude. Any value gained at the price of rectitude is only the simulacrum of genuine value. In a variety of conceptually interconnected ways, then, virtuous individuals are necessarily better off than those willing to take moral short-cuts. In its structure and much of its content, Rand's ethical egoism is thus of a piece with the egoism of ancient eudaimonistic theories.\n\nAn objection often levied against egoistic theories is that they give the wrong reason for acting in other-regarding ways: justly, kindly, etc. My act is not really just if I give you your due because it is good for me rather than because you deserve it; it is not really charitable if I help you for my own benefit rather than yours. A common reply is that the egoist's justification is egoistic but not her motivation, a reply that itself invites the charge of moral \u201cschizophrenia\u201d. Rand does not explicitly address the \u201cwrong-reason\u201d objection, but the non-instrumentalist strand in her theory implies that the objection itself is mistaken, because giving you what you deserve/merit is partly constitutive of my rational interests; there is no conflict between your rational interests and mine (cf. 1964a, pp. 57\u201365).\n\nRand regards goodwill towards others, or a generalized benevolence, as an offshoot of proper self-love, with no independent source in human nature. There is only one alternative to being rationally self-interested: sacrificing one's proper interests, either for the sake of other people (which she equates with altruism) or for the sake of the supernatural (which she calls mysticism) (1982a, ch. 7). Kant's ethics is a secularized mysticism insofar as it rests on categorical commands and duty for duty's sake, which is to say: regardless of any earthly desire or interest (1970). The altruistic ethics equates right action with self-sacrifice for the sake of others' good and immorality with \u201cselfishness,\u201d while saying nothing about the standard of the good (\u201cIntroduction,\u201d 1964a, iii; 1974). It thus fails to answer the prior question of what code of values we should follow and why, and provides no motivation to be moral other than guilt over \u201cselfishness\u201d. When taken to its logical conclusion, altruism does not simply tell us that it is \u201cselfish\u201d to pursue our own desires, but also that it is \u201cselfish to uphold\u2026 [our own] convictions, \u2026 [that we] must sacrifice them to the convictions of others\u201d (Rand 1957, 943; Galt's Speech, Rand 1961a, 142). In foreign policy, altruism is used to justify and gain support for America's interventionism in other countries. Altruism is also the reason why so many sympathize with, or even praise, bloody dictatorships that proudly proclaim that the sacrifice of the individual is a necessary and noble means to the goal of the collective good (Rand 1967).\n\nAs a moral code, altruism is impractical, because its requirements are contrary to the requirements of life and happiness, both the agent's and other people's. As such, it is also profoundly immoral. Like Kant's deontology, altruism leaves us without any moral guidance in our everyday lives and gives morality a bad name.\n\nWhat, then, is the psychological explanation for the widespread equation of altruism with morality? Rand suggests various explanations reminiscent of Nietzsche's analysis of the psychology of altruism. The theorists and preachers of altruism are motivated largely by a desire to control and manipulate others by playing on their guilt. Those who accept their teachings typically do so either because of guilt over their own superior achievements, or because, lacking any \u201cintellectual integrity, love of truth\u2026or a passionate dedication to an idea,\u201d they have nothing much worth saving, and so do not mind sacrificing it (\u201cSelfishness Without a Self,\u201d 1973b; 1982a). Some altruists are altruists because their mentalities are still frozen in a tribal past when survival required the sacrifice of some for the sake of others (1973b).\n\nRand's defense of \u201cselfishness\u201d and rejection of altruism are part of the reason both for her popularity with the general reader, and her unpopularity with philosophers and other intellectuals, although some would no doubt agree with her rejection of abject self-sacrifice and her recognition of proper concern with the self as moral (Falk 1963; Gilligan 1982; Hampton 1993; Badhwar 1993a). The general reader who responds positively to Rand's work finds, for the first time, a moral justification for pursuing a life of her or his own and a liberation from \u201cunearned guilt\u201d. The philosopher who responds negatively to her work finds many biased and simplistic interpretations of philosophers and philosophical doctrines, including her claim that she is the first to consistently defend a morality of rational self-interest, all other philosophers having defended either altruism or mysticism (Pojman 1995). Her critics also challenge her equation of altruism with abject self-sacrifice (Rachels 2000, Flew 1984), and her claim (explained below) that there is no conflict between people's rational interests (Flew 1984). An adequate interpretation of her views, however, requires attention both to the fact that, in the absence of special obligations created by bonds of love, contract, or family, she regards others' needs as making no claim on us, and to the fact that she is an uncompromising defender of justice, honesty, and respect for others as ends in themselves.\n\nRand's moral society is a society of independent individuals who respect each other's natural rights to life, liberty, and property, and who trade value for value, materially and spiritually. They live, in her words, by \u201cthe trader principle\u201d. Individual (natural) rights and the trader principle are both dictated by the fact that, as rational, independent beings, we need to think and act for our \u201cproper survival\u201d (1961b, p. 31). Both are required by respect for individuals as ends in themselves, not mere means to others' ends.\n\nThe concept of rights, says Rand, \u201cprovides a logical transition from the principles guiding an individual's actions to the principles guiding his relationship with others\u2026 Individual rights are the means of subordinating society to moral law\u201d (1963b, p. 108). These natural rights are basically rights to action, not to things or outcomes, and can be violated only through the initiation of force or fraud. Hence, all natural rights are negative, that is, claims on others' non-interference, and not claims on them to provide one with certain goods or outcomes.[8] The fundamental right is the right to life: the right to take the actions necessary for sustaining the life proper to a human being. All other rights follow from this right. Thus, the right to liberty is the right to act (including to write and speak) on one's judgment; the right to the pursuit of happiness is the right to pursue goals for one's own fulfillment; the right to property is \u201cthe right to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values\u201d (1963b, p.94). Like the mind-body dichotomy, the common dichotomy between \u201chuman rights\u201d and the right to property is a false one, because to own one's life is to own one's actions and their fruits (1962b, p. 91).[9] As there is a causal and logical connection between the virtues, so there is between rights: a government that violates one right violates others. Thus, for example, in violating the right to freedom of expression by banning \u201cobscene\u201d speech on TV, the government violates the property right of the owners of the TV station to use their property as they see fit.\n\nRand argues that the only just social-political system, the only system compatible with our rational nature, is capitalism (1965, 1967), that is, \u201claissez-faire capitalism\u2014with a separation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church\u201d (1961b, 1964a). Her conception of capitalism is, thus, more radical than the mainstream conception, and her defense of it significantly different both from the utilitarian defenses given by most economists, and the religious defenses given by many conservatives (Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1984c; Machan 1984). She regards laissez-faire capitalism as \u201cthe only [social] system that bans force from social relationships\u201d domestically and abroad, because the trader and the warrior are antagonists (Rand 1966a). In Atlas Shrugged, she distinguishes between the few business people who earn their money through honest effort, without seeking favors from the government, and the vast majority who are members of \u201cthe aristocracy of pull,\u201d and get rich only through such favors, a situation that she thinks prevails, and has always prevailed, in the real world (Rand 1964c). She holds, much like Marx did, that for a short period in the nineteenth-century America came closer to a laissez-faire system than any other society before or since, but that capitalism remains an unknown ideal. Some critics charge, however, that Rand does not always recognize the aristocrats of pull in the real world (Rothbard 1968; Johnson 2006 in Other Internet Resources).\n\nIn response to the criticism that unregulated, laissez-faire capitalism would lead to a concentration of power in a few hands and undermine equality of opportunity, Rand argues that we need the rule of law, a well-defined system of property rights, and freedom of contract. She regards state regulation of the market as responsible for corrupting both state and market institutions, just as in the past political regulation of religion corrupted both state and religious institutions. In both cases, regulation created or creates the opportunity for the trading of favors between politicians and religious leaders, or politicians and businessmen.\n\nRand holds that there is no conflict between one person's rational interests and another's, hence that respecting other people's rights is perfectly compatible with advancing or preserving one's own interests. Critics, however, object that if my ultimate value, whether this be my survival or my happiness, is related to respect for rights as goal to means, then this last claim is simply false (Mack 1984; Flew 1984 ). For under perfectly realistic scenarios, my ultimate value can require me to violate your right to life or property. The most that Rand can show, on an instrumentalist justification of respect for rights, is that there is no conflict between rights, not that there is no conflict between rational interests. In her justification of rights we see the same unresolved tension between the instrumentalist strand and the deontic strand as we do in her justification of morality in general (Mack 1984).\n\nRand defines government as \u201can institution that holds the exclusive power to enforce certain rules of social conduct in a given geographical area\u201d (1963a, p. 125). A proper government is \u201cthe means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control\u2014i.e., under objectively defined law\u201d (1963b, p. 128). Such a government is minimal, limited to protecting us from criminals and foreign aggressors, and enforcing individual rights and contracts, with the help of the armed forces, police, and objectively defined civil and criminal laws and courts. Accordingly, the government may use force only in retaliation. A government that tries to enforce the brother's keeper principle\u2014\u201cfrom each according to his ability, to each according to his need\u201d; or that drafts citizens into the armed services or \u201cpublic service\u201d; or that tries to make them more virtuous, educated, well-mannered, healthy, or wealthy, violates rights. Statism in all its forms, from unlimited democracy to a mixed economy to dictatorship, is at odds with our status as independent, rational beings, as ends in ourselves. Statism also destroys ability and fails to fulfill anyone's needs for long, because \u201c[t]o deal with men by force is as impractical as to deal with nature by persuasion\u201d (1973a, p. 32). The fountainhead of all progress is the human mind, and the mind does not function well when forced.\n\nIn Atlas Shrugged Rand depicts her utopia, Galt's Gulch, as an anarchist society: a \u201cvoluntary association of men held together by nothing but every man's self-interest,\u201d without any formal organization (1957, p. 690). There is a judge to arbitrate disagreements, but there has never been any need for arbitration. In \u201cThe Nature of Government,\u201d however, Rand rejects anarchism as irrational and unworkable because, she says, it is incompatible with a single, objective system of law and, thus, with rights and peaceful cooperation (1963a). Anarchist critics, such as Roy Childs (1969) and Murray Rothbard (1978), have questioned whether a territorial monopoly (a government), as opposed to, e.g., a competitive market of security providers, is necessary to provide an effective legal system (cf. Long and Machan 2009).\n\nThe trader principle states that a voluntary, mutually beneficial exchange between independent equals is the only basis for a mutually respectful and rational relationship (1961b, p. 31). It is also the only basis for a peaceful relationship among countries: \u201cthe trader and the warrior have been fundamental antagonists throughout history\u201d (1966a, p. 38).\n\nThe trader principle applies to emotional relationships as well. To love or admire someone is to \u201cpay\u201d him for the pleasure one derives from his virtues (1961b, p. 31)\u2014or, Rand might say in the case of love for a small child, from his personality. It would seem, however, that the trade between parent and child is unequal, given that the child receives both pleasure and material support from the parent. And it is unclear how the trader principle applies at all when a severe disability renders a beloved child or spouse a source of pain rather than pleasure.\n\nIf feminism is the view that women are, and ought to be recognized as, men's intellectual, moral, sexual, and political equals, then the Objectivist philosophy of human nature is inherently feminist, since it applies equally to all human beings, regardless of gender (or race) (N. Branden 1999). Decades before it was considered acceptable for women to lack \u201cmaternal instincts\u201d or pursue careers, Rand created heroines who lack the first and pursue the second, free of guilt or self-doubt.[10] Kira (We the Living) wants to be an engineer, and Dagny (Atlas Shrugged) runs Taggart Transcontinental, the largest and most successful transcontinental railroad in the country. None of Rand's heroines sacrifices her interests, intellect, or principles for the man or men in her life. One literary critic argues that Dagny is the first, and perhaps only, epic heroine in Western literature because of the grandness of her vision, her courage and integrity, her unusual abilities, and her national importance (Michalson 1999). Rand's depiction of her heroines' enjoyment of sex and their freedom from all merely conventional norms about sex anticipates the sexual liberation movement of the 20th century by at least 30 years. In all three novels, it is the heroine who has the power to choose which of the men who love, admire, and desire her (and only her) she will have. Rand was also an ardent champion of a woman's right to control her own reproductive choices (1968a, 1981).\n\nHer relationship to the feminist movement, however, was more complex. Although she praised Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique, mainstream feminism's collectivism and emphasis on women as victims later led her to reject feminism as such. Many theorists argue that Rand's work, especially Atlas Shrugged, upholds important feminist ideals, even as it succumbs to some anti-feminist tendencies that contradict her individualistic ethics (e.g., Gladstein 1978, 1999; B. Branden 1999; Presley 1999; Sheaffer 1999; Taylor 1999). Many others regard her and her work as plainly anti-feminist, with Susan Brownmiller even calling her \u201ca traitor to her own sex\u201d (Brownmiller 1975). One criticism takes aim at the individualism of Rand's ethics and politics, which rejects any special government help for women or discrimination against men (e.g., Harrison 1978, 1999). Another objects that Rand has internalized a masculine conception of human nature and virtue, and then created her ideal woman in light of this conception (Brownmiller 1975; Glennon 1979). This may be responsible for Rand's puzzling (and offensive) view that the essence of femininity is to hero-worship (not men, but) masculinity, while insisting (as her novels depict) that women and men are inherently equal and that the ideal romantic relationship is between moral and intellectual equals (1968b; cf. Brown 1999). At least as offensive to many are the violent sex scenes in her novels, especially the infamous scene in The Fountainhead that many regard as rape, where Howard Roark has sex with Dominique in spite of her resistance.\n\nThose who reject the charge of rape argue that in the 1940s and 50s, when Rand wrote her novels, it would have been seen as rough sex rather than non-consensual sex (McElroy 1999; Sheaffer 1999).That Rand herself thought of this scene as consensual is shown a few pages later, when she writes: \u201cThey had been united in an understanding beyond the violence, beyond the deliberate obscenity of his action\u201d (1943, p. 218). And in letters to disturbed readers in 1946 and 1965, she denied that the scene is \u201cactual rape\u201d which, she stated, is \u201ca dreadful crime,\u201d a \u201cvicious action and a violation of a woman's rights\u201d (Rand 1995a). On the other hand, she also depicts Dominique exultantly telling herself that she's been raped. McElroy wonders if having her heroine call it rape is just another instance of Rand's desire to provoke and shock the reader (McElroy 1999), as when she uses \u201cselfishness\u201d to mean \u201crational self-interest\u201d.\n\nRand holds that our actions need guidance by a vision of the fundamental nature of the universe and of the efficacy of human thought and activity\u2014a vision that can be grasped directly rather than requiring the conscious repetition of long chains of abstract reasoning. The chief function of art is to meet this psychological need by expressing abstract conceptual values and metaphysical truths in concrete perceptible form. Art, according to Rand, constitutes a selective, stylized re-creation of reality, with the principle of selection being the artist's \u201csense of life,\u201d a set of implicit \u201cmetaphysical value-judgments,\u201d i.e., judgments about what is fundamentally significant about the world and our place in it. (There is controversy among Rand scholars as to whether what is re-created in art is certain elements of reality or reality as a whole, i.e., a \u201cmicrocosm,\u201d as well as how and whether the concept of re-creation applies to apparently non-representational forms of art: Torres and Kamhi 2000; Bissell 2004.) Both the artist's creative work and the audience's emotional responses to it are driven by their senses of life, that is, the worldviews they have \u201cformed by a process of emotional generalization \u2026 a subconscious counterpart of a process of abstraction\u201d (1966b, p. 27). The role of art in sustaining us psychologically by providing a concretization of our most fundamental values is a frequent theme in Rand's fiction as well, especially The Fountainhead.[11]\n\nWhile art can be used to convey information or to advocate a position, such functions are secondary to its chief task: providing an object whose mere contemplation brings spiritual fulfillment. Hence Rand does not regard her own novels primarily as vehicles for her philosophy, though of course they are that inter alia. Given her own worldview, Rand favors literature with a strong plot as a way of expressing purposeful human action in a world of causal regularity, and stories involving value-conflicts as a way of expressing the importance of free choice; hence her preference for romantic (as opposed to, e.g., naturalistic) literature. But Rand holds that it is possible to evaluate an artwork's aesthetic value simply in terms of its success in conveying a concretization of the artist's sense of life, whether or not one shares the values and judgments so conveyed.\n\n1943, The Fountainhead, Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill.\n\n1953, Anthem (1 st ed. 1938), Caldwell, Idaho: Caxton Printers.\n\ned. 1938), Caldwell, Idaho: Caxton Printers. 1957, Atlas Shrugged, New York: Random House.\n\n1959, We the Living (1 st ed. 1936), New York: Macmillan.\n\ned. 1936), New York: Macmillan. 1961a, For the New Intellectual: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand, New York: New American Library.\n\n1961b, \u201cThe Objectivist Ethics,\u201d in Rand 1964a, pp. 13\u201339.

Born in Russia in 1905 and educated there, she immigrated to the United States after graduating from university. Upon becoming proficient in English and establishing herself as a writer of fiction, she became well-known as a passionate advocate of a philosophy she called Objectivism. This philosophy is in the Aristotelian tradition, with that tradition\u2019s emphasis upon metaphysical naturalism, empirical reason in epistemology, and self-realization in ethics. Her political philosophy is in the classical liberal tradition, with that tradition\u2019s emphasis upon individualism, the constitutional protection of individual rights to life, liberty, and property, and limited government. She wrote both technical and popular works of philosophy, and she presented her philosophy in both fictional and nonfictional forms. Her philosophy has influenced several generations of academics and public intellectuals, and has had widespread popular appeal.\n\nRegarding human nature, Rand said, \u201cMan is a being of self-made soul.\u201d Rand believes human beings are not born in sin or with destructive desires; nor do they necessarily acquire them in the course of growing to maturity. Instead one is born morally tabula rasa (a blank slate), and through one\u2019s choices and actions one acquires one\u2019s character traits and habits. Having chronic desires to steal, rape, or kill others is the result of mistaken development and the acquisition of bad habits, just as are chronic laziness or the habit of eating too much junk food. And just as one is not born lazy but can by one\u2019s choices develop oneself into a person of vigor or sloth, so also one is not born antisocial but can by one\u2019s choices develop oneself into a person of cooperativeness or conflict.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Life\n\nAyn Rand\u2019s life was often as colorful as those of her heroes in her best-selling novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. Rand first made her name as a novelist, publishing We the Living (1936), The Fountainhead (1943), and her magnum opus Atlas Shrugged (1957). These philosophical novels embodied themes she subsequently developed in nonfiction form in a series of essays and books written in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nBorn in St. Petersburg, Russia, on February 2, 1905, Rand was raised in a middle-class family. As a child, she loved storytelling, and at age nine she decided to become a writer. In school she showed academic promise, particularly in mathematics. Her family was devastated by the communist revolution of 1917, both by the social upheavals that the revolution and the ensuing civil war brought and by her father\u2019s pharmacy being confiscated by the Soviets. The family moved to the Crimea to recover financially and to escape the harshness of life the revolution brought to St. Petersburg. They later returned to Petrograd (the new name given to St. Petersburg by the Soviets), where Rand was to attend university.\n\nAt the University of Petrograd, Rand concentrated her studies on history, with secondary focuses on philosophy and literature. At university, she was repelled by the dominance of communist ideas and strong-arm tactics that suppressed free inquiry and discussion. As a youth, she had been repelled by the communists\u2019 political program, and now an adult, she was also more fully aware of the destructive effects that the revolution had had on Russian society more broadly.\n\nHaving studied American history and politics at university, and having long been an admirer of Western plays, music, and movies, she became an admirer of American individualism, vigor, and optimism, seeing them as the opposites of Russian collectivism, decay, and gloom. Not believing, however, that she would be free under the Soviet system to write the kinds of books she wanted to write, she resolved to leave Russia and go to America.\n\nRand graduated from the University of Petrograd in 1924. She then enrolled at the State Institute for Cinema Arts in order to study screenwriting. In 1925, she finally received permission from the Soviet authorities to leave the country in order to visit relatives in the United States. Officially, her visit was to be brief; Rand, however, had already decided not to return to the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter several stops in western European cities, Rand arrived in New York City in February 1926. From New York, she traveled on to Chicago, Illinois, where she spent the next six months living with relatives, learning English, and developing ideas for stories and movies. She had decided to become a screenwriter, and, having received an extension to her visa, she left for Hollywood, California.\n\nOn Rand\u2019s second day in Hollywood, an event occurred that was worthy of her fiction. She was spotted by Cecil B. DeMille, one of Hollywood\u2019s leading directors, while she was standing at the gate of his studio. She had recognized him as he was passing by in his car, and he had noticed her staring at him. He stopped to ask why she was staring, and Rand explained that she had recently arrived from Russia, that she had long been passionate about Hollywood movies, and that she dreamed of being a screenwriter. DeMille was then working on \u201cThe King of Kings,\u201d and gave her a ride to his movie set and signed her on as an extra. During her second week at DeMille\u2019s studio, another significant event occurred: Rand met Frank O\u2019Connor, a young actor also working as an extra. Rand and O\u2019Connor were married in 1929, and they remained married for fifty years until his death in 1979.\n\nRand worked for DeMille as a reader of scripts and struggled financially while working on her own writing. She also held a variety of non-writing jobs until in 1932 she was able to sell her first screenplay, \u201cRed Pawn,\u201d to Universal Studios. Also in 1932 her first stage play, \u201cNight of January 16th,\u201d was produced in Hollywood and later on Broadway.\n\nRand had been working for years on her first significant novel, We the Living, and finished it in 1933. However, for several years it was rejected by various publishers, until in 1936 it was published by Macmillan in the U.S. and Cassell in England. Rand described We the Living as the most autobiographical of her novels, its theme being the brutality of life under communist rule in Russia. We the Living did not receive a positive reaction from American reviewers and intellectuals. It was published in the 1930s, a decade sometimes called the \u201cRed Decade,\u201d during which American intellectuals were often pro-communist and respectful and admiring of the Soviet experiment.\n\nRand\u2019s next major project was The Fountainhead, which she had begun to work on in 1935. While the theme of We the Living was political, the theme of The Fountainhead was ethical, focusing on individualist themes of independence and integrity. The novel\u2019s hero, the architect Howard Roark, is Rand\u2019s first embodiment of her ideal man, the man who lives on a principled and heroic scale of achievement.\n\nAs with We the Living, Rand had difficulties getting The Fountainhead published. Twelve publishers rejected it before it was published by Bobbs-Merrill in 1943. Again not well received by reviewers and intellectuals, the novel nonetheless became a best seller, primarily through word-of-mouth recommendation. The Fountainhead made Rand famous as an exponent of individualist ideas, and its continuing to sell well brought her financial security. Warner Brothers produced a movie version of the novel in 1949, starring Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal, for which Rand wrote the screenplay.\n\nIn 1946, Rand began work on her most ambitious novel, Atlas Shrugged. At the time, she was working part-time as a screenwriter for producer Hal Wallis. In 1951, she and her husband moved to New York City, where she began to work full-time on Atlas. Published by Random House in 1957, Atlas Shrugged is her most complete expression of her literary and philosophical vision. Dramatized in the form of a mystery about a man who stopped the motor of the world, the plot and characters embody the political and ethical themes first developed in We the Living and The Fountainhead and integrates them into a comprehensive philosophy including metaphysics, epistemology, economics, and the psychology of love and sex.\n\nAtlas Shrugged was an immediate best seller and Rand\u2019s last work of fiction. Her novels had expressed philosophical themes, although Rand considered herself primarily a novelist and only secondarily a philosopher. The creation of plots and characters and the dramatization of achievements and conflicts were her central purposes in writing fiction, rather than presenting an abstracted and didactic set of philosophical theses.\n\nThe Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, however, had attracted to Rand many readers who were strongly interested in the philosophical ideas the novels embodied and in pursuing them further. Among the earliest of those with whom Rand became associated and who later became prominent were psychologist Nathaniel Branden and economist Alan Greenspan, later Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Her interactions with these and several other key individuals were partly responsible for Rand\u2019s turning from fiction to nonfiction writing in order to develop her philosophy more systematically.\n\nFrom 1962 until 1976, Rand wrote and lectured on her philosophy, now named \u201cObjectivism.\u201d Her essays during this period were mostly published in a series of periodicals: The Objectivist Newsletter, published from 1962 to 1965; the larger periodical The Objectivist, published from 1966 to 1971; and then The Ayn Rand Letter, published from 1971 to 1976. The essays written for these periodicals form the core material for a series of nine nonfiction books published during Rand\u2019s lifetime. These books develop Rand\u2019s philosophy in all its major categories and apply it to cultural issues. Perhaps the most significant of these books are The Virtue of Selfishness, which develops her ethical theory, Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, devoted to political and economic theory, Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, a systematic presentation of her theory of concepts, and The Romantic Manifesto, a theory of aesthetics.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Rand\u2019s most significant professional relationship was with Nathaniel Branden. Branden, author of The Psychology of Self-Esteem and later known as a leader in the self-esteem movement in psychology, wrote many essays on philosophical and psychological topics that were published in Rand\u2019s books and periodicals. He was the founder and head of the Nathaniel Branden Institute, the leading Objectivist institution of the 1960s. Based in New York City, the Nathaniel Branden Institute published with Rand\u2019s sanction numerous periodicals and pamphlets and sponsored many lectures in New York that were then distributed on tape around the United States and the rest of the world. The rapid growth of the Nathaniel Branden Institute and the Objectivist movement came to a halt in 1968 when, for both professional and personal reasons, Rand and Branden parted ways.\n\nRand continued to write and lecture consistently until she stopped publishing The Ayn Rand Letter in 1976. Thereafter she wrote and lectured less as her husband\u2019s health declined, leading to his death in 1979, and as her own health began to decline. Rand died on March 6, 1982, in her New York City apartment.\n\n2. Rand\u2019s Ethical Theory: Rational Egoism\n\nThe provocative title of Ayn Rand\u2019s The Virtue of Selfishness matches an equally provocative thesis about ethics. Traditional ethics has always been suspicious of self-interest, praising acts that are selfless in intent and calling amoral or immoral acts that are motivated by self-interest. A self-interested person, on the traditional view, will not consider the interests of others and so will slight or harm those interests in the pursuit of his own.\n\nRand\u2019s view is that the exact opposite is true: Self-interest, properly understood, is the standard of morality and selflessness is the deepest immorality.\n\nSelf-interest rightly understood, according to Rand, is to see oneself as an end in oneself. That is to say that one\u2019s own life and happiness are one\u2019s highest values, and that one does not exist as a servant or slave to the interests of others. Nor do others exist as servants or slaves to one\u2019s own interests. Each person\u2019s own life and happiness are their ultimate ends. Self-interest rightly understood also entails self-responsibility: One\u2019s life is one\u2019s own, and so is the responsibility for sustaining and enhancing it. It is up to each of us to determine what values our lives require, how best to achieve those values, and to act to achieve those values.\n\nRand\u2019s ethic of self-interest is integral to her advocacy of classical liberalism. Classical liberalism, more often called \u201clibertarianism\u201d in the twentieth century, is the view that individuals should be free to pursue their own interests. This implies, politically, that governments should be limited to protecting each individual\u2019s freedom to do so. In other words, the moral legitimacy of self-interest implies that individuals have rights to their lives, their liberties, their property, and the pursuit of their own happiness, and that the purpose of government is to protect those rights. Economically, leaving individuals free to pursue their own interests implies in turn that only a capitalist or free market economic system is moral: Free individuals will use their time, money, and other property as they see fit, and will interact and trade voluntarily with others to mutual advantage.\n\n3. Reason and Ethics\n\nFundamentally, the means by which humans live is reason. Our capacity for reason is what enables us to survive and flourish. We are not born knowing what is good for us; that is learned. Nor are we born knowing how to achieve what is good for us; that too is learned. It is by reason that we learn what is food and what is poison, what animals are useful or dangerous to us, how to make tools, what forms of social organization are fruitful, and so on.\n\nThus, Rand advocates rational self-interest: One\u2019s interests are not whatever one happens to feel like; rather it is by reason that one identifies what is in one\u2019s interest and what is not. By the use of reason one takes into account all of the factors one can identify, projects the consequences of potential courses of action, and adopts principled policies of action.\n\nThe principled policies a person should adopt are called virtues. A virtue is an acquired character trait; it results from identifying a policy as good and committing to acting consistently in terms of that policy.\n\nOne such virtue is rationality: Having identified the use of reason as fundamentally good, the virtue of rationality is being committed to acting in accordance with reason. Another virtue is productiveness: Given that the values one needs to survive must be produced, the virtue of productiveness is being committed to producing those values. Another is honesty: Given that facts are facts and that one\u2019s life depends on knowing and acting in accordance with the facts, the virtue of honesty is being committed to awareness of the facts.\n\nIndependence and integrity are also core virtues for Rand\u2019s account of self-interest. Given that one must think and act by one\u2019s own efforts, being committed to the policy of independent action is a virtue. And given that one must both identify what is in one\u2019s interests and act to achieve it, the virtue of integrity is a policy of being committed to acting on the basis of one\u2019s beliefs. The opposite policy of believing one thing and doing another is of course the vice of hypocrisy; hypocrisy is a policy of self-destruction, on Rand\u2019s view.\n\nJustice is another core self-interested virtue: Justice, on Rand\u2019s account, means a policy of judging people, including oneself, according to their value and acting accordingly. The opposite policy of giving to people more or less than they deserve is injustice. The final virtue on Rand\u2019s list of core virtues is pride, the policy of \u201cmoral ambitiousness,\u201d in Rand\u2019s words. This means a policy of being committed to making oneself be the best one can be, of shaping one\u2019s character to the highest level possible.\n\nThe moral person, in summary, on Rand\u2019s account, is someone who acts and is committed to acting in their best self-interest. It is by living the morality of self-interest that one survives, flourishes, and achieves happiness.\n\n4. Criticisms of Rand\u2019s Ethics\n\nEvery aspect of Rand\u2019s philosophy is subject to lively criticism and debate, but her normative views are the ones most focused upon.\n\nFrom the broadly defined conservative right, the main criticisms are (a) that Rand\u2019s metaphysical naturalism involves an atheism that undercuts religious metaphysics, (b) that her strong emphasis upon empirical data and reason undercut epistemologies based on faith and tradition, and (c) that her normative individualism undercuts the commands of duty, obligation and selflessness that are necessary for achieving social values. From the left, again defined broadly, the main criticisms are (a) that Rand\u2019s individualism atomistically isolates each of us from genuine society, (b) that her advocacy of free markets enables strong-versus-weak exploitation, and in left-postmodern critique (c) that her philosophical fundamentals commit her to an untenable foundationalism and absolutism.\n\nHere we will focus only on the arguments over Rand\u2019s account of self-interest, which is currently a minority position and subject to strong criticism from both the philosophical left and the philosophical right.\n\nThe contrasting view of self-interest typically pits it against morality, holding that one is moral only to the extent that one sacrifices one\u2019s self-interest for the sake of others or, more moderately, to the extent one acts primarily with regard to the interests of others. For example, standard versions of morality will hold that one is moral to the extent one sets aside one\u2019s own interests in order to serve God, or the weak and the poor, or society as a whole. On these accounts, the interests of God, the poor, or society as a whole are held to be of greater moral significance than one\u2019s own, and so accordingly one\u2019s interests should be sacrificed when necessary. These ethics of selflessness thus believe that one should see oneself fundamentally as a servant, as existing to serve the interests of others, not one\u2019s own. \u201cSelfless service to others\u201d or \u201cselfless sacrifice\u201d are stock phrases indicating these accounts\u2019 view of appropriate motivation and action.\n\nOne core difference between Rand\u2019s self-interest view and the selfless view can be seen in the reason why most advocates of selflessness think self-interest is dangerous: conflicts of interest.\n\n5. Conflicts of Interest\n\nMost traditional ethics take conflicts of interest to be fundamental to the human condition, and take ethics to be the solution: Basic ethical principles are to tell us whose interests should be sacrificed in order to resolve the conflicts. If there is, for example, a fundamental conflict between what God wants and what humans naturally want, then religious ethics will make fundamental the principle that human wants should be sacrificed for God\u2019s. If there is a fundamental conflict between what society needs and what individuals want, then some versions of secular ethics will make fundamental the principle that the individual\u2019s wants should be sacrificed for society\u2019s.\n\nTaking conflicts of interest to be fundamental almost always stems from one of two beliefs: that human nature is fundamentally destructive or that economic resources are scarce. If human nature is fundamentally destructive, then humans are naturally in conflict with each other. Many ethical philosophies start from this premise\u2014for example, Plato\u2019s myth of Gyges, Jewish and Christian accounts of original sin, and Freud\u2019s account of the id. If what individuals naturally want to do to each other is rape, steal, and kill, then in order to have society these individual desires need to be sacrificed. Consequently, a basic principle of ethics will be to urge individuals to suppress their natural desires so that society can exist. In other words, self-interest is the enemy, and must be sacrificed for others.\n\nIf economic resources are scarce, then there is not enough to go around. This scarcity then puts human beings in fundamental conflict with each other: For one individual\u2019s need to be satisfied, another\u2019s must be sacrificed. Many ethical philosophies begin with this premise. For example, Thomas Malthus\u2019s theory that population growth outstrips growth in the food supply falls into this category. Karl Marx\u2019s account of capitalist society is that brutal competition leads to the exploitation of some by others. Garrett Hardin\u2019s famous use of the lifeboat analogy asks us to imagine that society is like a lifeboat with more people than its resources can support. And so, in order to solve the problem of destructive competition the lack of resources leads us to, a basic principle of ethics will be to urge individuals to sacrifice their interests in obtaining more, or even some, so that others may obtain more or some and society can exist peacefully. In other words, in a situation of scarcity, self-interest is the enemy and must be sacrificed for others.\n\nRand rejects both the scarce resources and destructive human nature premises. Human beings are not born in sin or with destructive desires; nor do they necessarily acquire them in the course of growing to maturity. Instead one is born morally tabula rasa (\u201cblank slate\u201d), and through one\u2019s choices and actions one acquires one\u2019s character traits and habits. As Rand phrased it, \u201cMan is a being of self-made soul.\u201d Having chronic desires to steal, rape, or kill others is the result of mistaken development and the acquisition of bad habits, just as are chronic laziness or the habit of eating too much junk food. And just as one is not born lazy but can by one\u2019s choices develop oneself into a person of vigor or sloth, one is not born antisocial but can by one\u2019s choices develop oneself into a person of cooperativeness or conflict.\n\nNor are resources scarce, according to Rand, in any fundamental way. By the use of reason, humans can discover new resources and how to use existing resources more efficiently, including recycling where appropriate and making productive processes more efficient. Humans have, for example, continually discovered and developed new energy resources, from animals to wood to coal to oil to nuclear fission to solar panels; and there is no end in sight to this process. At any given moment, the available resources are a fixed amount, but over time the stock of resources are and have been constantly expanding.\n\nBecause humans are rational they can produce an ever-expanding number of goods, and so human interests do not fundamentally conflict with each other. Instead, Rand holds that the exact opposite is true: Since humans can and should be productive, human interests are deeply in harmony with each other. For example, my producing more corn is in harmony with your producing more peas, for by our both being productive and trading with each other we are both better off. It is to your interest that I be successful in producing more corn, just as it is to my interest that you be successful in producing more peas.\n\nConflicts of interest do exist within a narrower scope. For example, in the immediate present available resources are more fixed, and so competition for those resources results, and competition produces winners and losers. Economic competition, however, is a broader form of cooperation, a social way to allocate resources without resorting to physical force and violence. By competition, resources are allocated efficiently and peacefully, and in the long run more resources are produced. Thus, a competitive economic system is in the self-interest of all of us.\n\nAccordingly, Rand argues that her ethic of self-interest is the basis for personal happiness and free and prosperous societies.\n\n6. Rand\u2019s Influence\n\nThe impact of Rand\u2019s ideas is difficult to measure, but it has been large. All her books were still in print as of 2017, had sold more than thirty million copies, and continued to sell approximately one million copies each year. A survey jointly conducted by the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club early in the 1990s asked readers to name the book that had most influenced their lives: Atlas Shrugged was second only to the Bible. Excerpts from Rand\u2019s works are regularly reprinted in college textbooks and anthologies, and several volumes have been published posthumously containing her early writings, journals, and letters. As an outsider with iconoclastic views, Rand\u2019s influence within the academic world has been limited, though university press books and scholarly articles about her work continue to be published regularly. Outside the academic world are several institutes founded by those influenced by Rand. Noteworthy among these are the Cato Institute, based in Washington, D.C., the leading libertarian think tank. Rand, along with Nobel Prize-winners Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, was highly instrumental in attracting generations of individuals to the libertarian movement. Also noteworthy are the Ayn Rand Institute, founded in 1985 by philosopher Leonard Peikoff and entrepreneur Edward Snider and based in California, and The Atlas Society, founded in 1990 by philosopher David Kelley and based in Washington, D.C.\n\n7.

Sometimes the name emerges from a consensus of its practitioners \u2013 for example, Existentialism. It takes a bigger than average ego to consciously create a philosophy and give it a name of one\u2019s own choosing. In For the New Intellectual (1961), Ayn Rand wrote, \u201cThe name I have chosen for my philosophy is Objectivism.\u201d\n\n\n\nAyn Rand by Gail Campbell 2019\n\nRussia & America\n\nAyn Rand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum in Saint Petersburg in 1905. Her father was a successful Jewish pharmacist. At the age of twelve the October Revolution totally changed her life. Her father\u2019s business was confiscated and the family fled to the Crimea, where they spent the years of the Russian Civil War (1918-21).\n\nRand is often accused of mythologising her early life, but one passage rings true, and reveals a lot:\n\n\u201cI lived in a small town that changed hands many times\u2026 When it was occupied by the White Army [Tsarist], I almost longed for the return of the Red Army [Communist], and vice versa. There was not much difference between them in practice, but there was in theory. The Red Army stood for totalitarian dictatorship and rule by terror. The White Army stood for nothing; repeat: nothing. In answer to the monstrous evil they were fighting, the Whites found nothing better to proclaim than the dustiest, smelliest bromides of the time: we must fight, they said, for Holy Mother Russia, for faith and tradition.\u201d\n\n(\u2018The Lessons of Vietnam\u2019, 1975)\n\nAfter the war the family returned to Saint Petersburg, which had by then become known as Petrograd, and Alisa enrolled in the State University. She was awarded a diploma in History in 1924, allegedly after being expelled as bourgeois but then rescued through the intervention of foreign scholars. After this she studied Screen Arts in what was by then Leningrad. About this time she adopted the \u2018writing name\u2019 Ayn Rand , although she apparently never explained her reasons for doing so. In 1925 she was granted a visa to visit relatives in Chicago, and she arrived in New York in February 1926, allegedly speaking no English. (If so, she became fluent very quickly.) She attempted to secure visas to bring her family to the USA, but without success.\n\nWriter & Philosopher\n\nRand moved to Hollywood and got work as an extra, through, it is claimed, a chance meeting with Cecil B. DeMille. Later she worked as a screenwriter. In 1929 she married the actor Frank O\u2019Connor, and became an American citizen in 1931. She embarked on a career as a novelist and playwright, initially with limited success. Then one of her plays was produced on Broadway, and in 1936 she published her semi-autobiographical novel We the Living.\n\n1943 saw the publication of The Fountainhead, her first bestseller. It was filmed in 1949 using Rand\u2019s own script (slightly modified), and starred Gary Cooper. According to some accounts, Rand did not like the film, despite having written it. Other accounts have her thanking the producer and director for staying true to her vision.\n\nHer next novel, Atlas Shrugged (1957) was an expression of the philosophy she\u2019d been developing. It was also her last work of fiction. By the time it appeared, Rand had moved from Los Angeles to New York and surrounded herself with a group of admirers who met in her apartment to discuss her ideas. They humorously described themselves as \u2018the collective\u2019. In 1961 she published For the New Intellectual, the manifesto of Objectivism, and for the next twenty years she devoted herself to expressing her beliefs through non-fiction, mainly in The Objectivist Newsletter and through public talks.\n\nRand tells the story that she was asked if she \u201ccould present the essence of [her] philosophy while standing on one foot.\u201d Her reply was:\n\n1. Metaphysics: Objective Reality\n\n2. Epistemology: Reason\n\n3. Ethics: Self-interest\n\n4. Politics: Capitalism\n\nShe also wrote that \u201cThe motive and purpose of my writing is the projection of an ideal man.\u201d Of course, her ideas are much more complex than this. But it is probably in her fiction rather than in her essays that her intentions become most clear.\n\nThe Fountainhead revolves around a housing development project designed by the hero, architect Howard Roark. A key plot development occurs when a member of the development team manipulates a change to the design in order to provide herself with a long term job. This is a self-interested act, which is seemingly in line with the third tenet of Rand\u2019s philosophy so you might expect her to approve; but Rand implicitly condemns it. Roark is presented as having artistic integrity: he does what he believes in, even when it seems contrary to his immediate self-interest. Therefore Roark is true to himself. Here Rand contrasts petty selfishness with the \u2018heroic egoism\u2019 that she really believes in.\n\nRand did admit to having been influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900), but also claimed to have rejected his ideas. Her heroes, however, show all the traits of a Nietzschean \u00dcbermensch. In particular, her capitalists are consistently tycoons, usually self-made, who own their own businesses and are not constrained by the \u2018herd instinct\u2019 of shareholders. (Another Nietzschean trait in Rand is the frequent quoting of her own works.)\n\nThe Individual & the State\n\nRand argued that for most of history, human societies had been governed either by men of violence or by men of mysticism (\u2018Attila and the witch-doctor\u2019, as she eloquently borrowed from Nathaniel Branden). Neither the violent nor the mystics produced anything: rather, they both took from the producers, whether by force or by what Rand regarded as the fraud of religion. Only in modern times have the \u2018producers\u2019 (by which she means capitalists) come to dominate society, under the guidance of reason. But, she argues in For the New Intellectual, contemporary thought is tending to reverse this development.\n\nHer two bugbears were altruism and statism. She never denied that human beings could give unselfishly to each other, for whatever reasons, but she argued against all moral systems which claimed or implied that human beings were obliged to live for others, whether for other individuals or for the community. Her vision of ideal human interaction was instead based on capitalism. Human beings should relate to each other as \u2018traders\u2019, each pursuing their rational self-interest, and so engaging with each other in a decent and reasonable fashion, with mutual respect and acknowledging the value of every human being \u2013 in E.F. Schumacher\u2019s phrase, practicing \u2018economics as if people mattered\u2019. (Interestingly, the novelist and Christian apologist C.S. Lewis gave a criticism of what he called \u2018unselfishness\u2019 which closely resembles Rand\u2019s critique of altruism.)\n\nRand accepted the need for some sort of state. She wrote against all forms of anarchism, including capitalist anarchism, and argued that a state was necessary in order to provide a framework of law and to protect its citizens against aggression, either from outside or from each other. However, beyond that she believed that the capitalist market/trader interaction was sufficient for a good society. But, she noted, the state has a tendency to extend its activities beyond the limited role she advocated. In particular, the state could be taken over by \u2018altruism\u2019. This meant that it became a means of redistributing the property of its citizens on the basis of service to each other. That is, it collected taxes on the basis of ability to pay, but supplied services on the basis of need, as defined by the state.\n\nTo return to the quotation about the Russian Civil War: in her adolescence Ayn Rand was offered two visions of how the world should be \u2013 monarchical or Communist \u2013 and rejected them both. She then moved to the United States with a vision of how the USA should be, and slowly discovered that the USA did not live up to her ideal, either. She then spent decades trying to convince the USA to become what she thought it should be.\n\nCriticism & Appreciation\n\n\u201cSex is the most profoundly selfish of all acts,\u201d says a character in Atlas Shrugged: \u201cA man\u2019s sexual choice is the result and the sum of his fundamental convictions.\u201d In 1954 Rand began an affair with Nathaniel Branden, one of her followers, who was also married. His wife and her husband apparently consented to the affair. In 1958 Branden began the Nathaniel Branden Lectures to promote Rand\u2019s ideas, later incorporating them as the Nathaniel Branden Institute. In 1964, after the affair with Rand was over, Branden began an affair with a young actress. When Rand learned of it in 1968 she was furious. She accused Branden of dishonesty and \u2018irrational behaviour in his private life\u2019 and cut off relations with both him and his wife. The Nathaniel Branden Institute had to close. No-one really understands what lay behind Rand\u2019s reaction; but it provoked accusations that Objectivism, despite its overt commitment to reason, had cult-like elements.\n\nActually it is easy to criticise Ayn Rand. For instance, her interpretation of history in her writings is overly simplistic. For one classic error, consider this: \u201cCapitalism was the system originated in the United States.\u201d (\u2018Introducing Objectivism\u2019, LA Times, June 17th 1962). Adam Smith would be surprised. She was also unable to appreciate non-Western art; indeed, it can be argued that the only art she really understood was fiction in the European tradition. But one then has to say that she appreciated Ian Fleming and Mickey Spillane, and tap dancing. She may have had a narrow vision, but she was not an intellectual snob.\n\nIn fact, Rand can only be understood in terms of her paradoxes. She was viewed as a right-winger in the American tradition, but she supported the right to abortion and opposed the Vietnam war. She despised homosexuality but argued against its criminalisation. She was an atheist, but regarded Saint Thomas Aquinas as her greatest influence after Aristotle. She was a strong-minded independent woman but not a feminist. Rather, she believed that women should look up to men. In The Fountainhead she even presented Dominique Francon as accepting her rape by Roark because he dominated her. But she accepted that women could rise almost to the top \u2013 she drew the line at a female President of the USA.\n\nRand\u2019s greatest weakness was perhaps her belief that her conclusions were the product of uncontaminated reason. If she allowed Objectivism to turn into a cult, it was because she believed that her conclusions, having been reached through pure reason, were the only possible conclusions. She often criticised other thinkers for letting emotion influence their ideas, but she never realised the extent to which her emotions and past experience led her to her own conclusions.\n\nWhy then should we consider Ayn Rand\u2019s ideas? First, because she is not, ever, a conventional thinker. However misguided her conclusions may seem, she has reached them through her own effort. Moreover, she asks the kind of questions about interhuman relations and our relationship to the state which still need to be asked, and answered. Even if we consider her answers wrong, we need to accept that she asked the right questions and reflect on what our responses should be to the same issues. For instance, at the end of For the New Intellectual, Rand puts forward two important propositions:\n\na. That emotions are not tools of cognition;\n\nb. That no man has the right to initiate the use of physical force against others.\n\nIt is possible to imagine arguments against both of these propositions: possible, but not easy.\n\nRand was a lifelong heavy smoker and underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974. She enrolled in Social Security and Medicare, but this was not inconsistent with her philosophy: she argued that if the state had improperly taken money from you in taxes, you were entitled to a return on your unwilling investment. As she aged, and especially after her husband\u2019s death in 1979, she reduced her activity, but continued to work on a (never completed) TV adaptation of Atlas Shrugged. She died of a heart attack on March 6th 1982. She was buried next to her husband in a New York cemetery. Her tombstone reads \u2018Ayn Rand O\u2019Connor 1905-1982\u2019.\n\n\u00a9 Martin Jenkins 2019\n\nMartin Jenkins is a retired community worker and a Quaker.

January 20] 1905 \u2013 March 6, 1982), better known by her pen name Ayn Rand (/a\u026an/), was a Russian-American writer and philosopher. She is known for her fiction and for developing a philosophical system she named Objectivism. Born and educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926. She wrote a play that opened on Broadway in 1935. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead. In 1957, Rand published her best-known work, the novel Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, until her death in 1982, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays.\n\nRand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge; she rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral[5][6] and opposed collectivism, statism, and anarchism. Instead, she supported laissez-faire capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights, including property rights. Although Rand opposed libertarianism, which she viewed as anarchism, she is often associated with the modern libertarian movement. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas and classical liberals.\n\nRand's fiction received mixed reviews from literary critics.[ Although academic interest in her ideas has grown since her death, academic philosophers have generally ignored or rejected her philosophy because of her polemical approach and lack of methodological rigor.[4] Her writings have influenced some libertarians and conservatives politically. The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings"}, {"url": "https://historyofwomenphilosophers.org/project/directory-of-women-philosophers/rand-ayn-1905-1982/", "page_content": "Ayn Rand, n\u00e9e Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum\n\n*February 2, 1905 (St. Petersburg, Russia)\n\n\u2020March 6, 1982(New York, U.S.)\n\nSpouses: Frank O\u00b4Connor (?-1978)\n\nAyn Rand was a major intellectual of the twentieth century. Born in Russia in 1905, she emigrated to the United States after graduating from university. Upon establishing herself as a writer of fiction, she became well-known as an advocate of Objectivist philosophy. Rand\u2019s philosophy is Aristotelian, with its emphasis upon naturalism, empirical reason, and self-realization. Her politics are classically liberal, with connections John Locke\u2019s emphasis upon individualism, the constitutional protection of individual rights to life, liberty, and property, and limited government. She wrote popular and technical philosophy and presented it in fictional and non-fictional forms.\n\nRand\u2019s first novel was We the Living (1936), followed by The Fountainhead (1943), and her magnum opus Atlas Shrugged (1957). These philosophical novels embody themes she subsequently developed in the 1960s and 1970s in non-fiction essays and books ranging over concept-formation in epistemology, meta-ethics and virtue theory, political and economic rights, and aesthetics. Her views were controversial in her lifetime and continue to be so. \u201cRight conservatives\u201d (defined broadly) criticize her (a) metaphysical naturalism for undermining religion, (b) emphasis upon empirical rationality for undermining faith and tradition, and (c) egoism for undermining duty and selflessness. \u201cLeft progressives\u201d (again taken broadly) criticize her (a) individualism on the ground that it isolates human from their social needs, (b) free-market capitalism on the ground that that it leads to exploitation of the weak by the strong, and by postmodernists favorable to the left (c) her naturalism and advocacy of reason that they judge to be untenable. Rand and those influenced by her naturally engage and the debates continue. In the 1990s a survey conducted by the Library of Congress asked readers to identify the book that had most influenced them: Atlas Shrugged was second to the Bible. She died in her New York City apartment in 1982.\n\nHicks, Stephen (Rockford University)"}]}
