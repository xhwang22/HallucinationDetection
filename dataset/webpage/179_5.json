But the free silver views of Mr. Sewall had at that time caused him to be classed by many of his friends in the East as a man who had gone wild on money questions. As a result of Mr. Cleveland's opposition to silver, Mr. Sewall fought against his renomination. He worked unceasingly for Cleveland's defeat at Chicago, standing for David B. Hill to the end but then came into line and helped elect the nominee. He never ceased to be an active member of the party. He was the unanimous choice of his party in Maine for United States Senator in 1892, and the attempt to turn him down at the State Convention by a resolution denouncing his free silver views failed.\n\nMr. Sewell was a delegate to the National Democratic Convention at Baltimore in 1872; at Cincinnati in 1880 and 1884; at St. Louis in 1888; and at Chicago in 1892 and 1896. At Chicago in July, 1896, he was one of the few advocates from New England of the free and unlimited coinage of silver. He was selected by the convention as their candidate for the office of Vice-president of the United States, and in an interview at the time voiced his sentiments on the platform as follows:\n\n\"There are thousands of business men in the East who are turning away from the single gold standard. It is not a class issue. In my opinion there is not a legitimate business in this country but that would be benefited by the restoration of silver to its rightful place in our national currency.\n\n\"I have been an advocate of silver ever since Congress\n\ndemonetized that metal in 1873. I held at the time that a mistake had been made, and have had no reason since to change my mind. \"There are two sides to every question, and as an individual banker I have a perfect right to take a position opposite to those who constitute the majority in the banking business. As I said before, this is not a technical question nor a class issue.\" Upon his return to his home in Bath he received an ovation from his fellow citizens long to be remembered by the staid people of that maritime town. The mayor warmly welcomed the nominee, and Mr. Sewall in the course of his reply to the warm welcome, said: \"It was a great convention, yet it did not seem to me to be a partisan one. It seemed more like the uprising of the people, and they seemed to be controlled by one idea, and that idea has filled me for years. They knew that this country is in deep distress, that it has been in distress for years, and that the great trouble is with our monetary system; and they believe as I believe, that there is only one remedy. They entertain no dishonest or dishonorable idea, but they demand that we be carried back to the money of our fathers, to that monetary system under which this government flourished for so many years, and they believe that is the only road to prosperity.\" \"The keynote of the Chicago platform is found in the Declaration of Independence. It simply implies that wherever the Government comes in contact with the citizen, wherever the citizen touches the Government, that all stand upon a common level, and there shall be equal rights to all and special privileges to no one. \"\u2014William J.

As the Populist Party nominee, Bryan had another running mate as well, Thomas E. Watson. Sewall never held elective office, although he was a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1888 to 1896.\n\nArthur Sewall's main claim to fame had been as an exceptionally successful, wealthy shipbuilder and New England industrialist. He was a director of the Maine Central railroad and President of the Bath National Bank for years. His selection is believed to have been an effort to win votes among conservative and New England members of the party who were disturbed by the populist aspects of William Jennings Bryan. Arthur Sewall is also one of the few politicians to be an adherent of Swedenborgianism, a religion based on the writings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg.\n\nHis main vice-presidential opponent, Garret A. Hobart (Rep), was also an Eastern banker and industrialist who had served on his party's national committee.\n\nSewall was Bryan's running mate for the first of Bryan's three times as the Democratic presidential nominee. He died not long after Bryan was nominated for the second time in 1900.\n\nSewall's grandson, Sumner Sewall, served as Governor of Maine from 1941 to 1945, as a Republican.\n\nLegacy\n\nIn 2008, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch referenced Sewall in an article criticizing Senator John McCain's selection of Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential candidate in the 2008 presidential election, saying he had picked \"the least qualified running mate since the Swedenborgian shipbuilder Arthur Sewall ran as William Jennings Bryan's No. 2 in 1896.\""}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7232538/arthur-sewall", "page_content": "Your suggestions have been submitted and will be reviewed by the memorial manager.\n\nYour edit did not contain any changes from the original.\n\nThank you!

Gignoux U.S. Courthouse ~ 1911- 2011\n\nConstruction of the United States Courthouse, now known as the Edward T. Gignoux U.S. Courthouse (dedicated in 1988), began in November, 1908. The building was completed in February, 1911, and dedicated on July 20, 1911.\n\nThe Thursday, July 20, 1911, edition of the Portland Evening Express reported:\n\n\u201c Distinguished Attendance at Dedication of New Building, Impressive Exercises at Fine Federal Courts Building This Afternoon . Judge William I. Putnam of the U.S. Circuit Court, Judge Clarence Hale of the U.S. District Court, the Right Rev. Robert Codman, Bishop of the Diocese of Maine of the Protestant Episcopal Church, entered the court room. Judges Putnam and Hale occupied their positions on the bench. The dedicatory exercises were presided over by Judge Putnam and were opened with prayer by Bishop Codman. Judge Putnam, without preamble, introduced U.S. District Attorney Robert Treat Whitehouse, who delivered the opening address.\u201d\n\nJames Knox Taylor (1857-1929), the Supervising Architect of the United States Treasury from 1897 to 1912, designed the building in the Second Renaissance Revival style. F.W. Cunningham & Sons, Portland contractors, constructed the courthouse, as well as other notable Portland landmarks, such as the Cumberland County Courthouse, Portland High School, Nathan Clifford School, additions to Union Station, Evergreen Cemetery, and the Chapel at St. Luke\u2019s Church, to name a few. The U.S. Courthouse is one of several government buildings which form a distinguished group near Lincoln Park in the center of the city, which includes the U.S. Custom House (1872), Cumberland County Courthouse (1910), and Portland City Hall (1912). The U.S. Courthouse was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\n\n\n\nWhen constructed in 1911, the Courthouse occupied the southwestern half of the lot bounded on the northwest by Federal Street, on the northeast by Pearl Street, on the southeast by Newbury Street, and on the southwest by Market Street. The main entrance was at the western corner, facing the junction of Market and Federal Streets. The building was a \u201cu\u201d shape, open toward Pearl Street.\n\nThe cornerstone for an addition was laid in September, 1931. The addition was a \u201cu\u201d shaped wing added to the existing building on the northeastern end. The United States Courthouse became a trapezoid, enclosing a courtyard, which filled the entire block. Construction was completed by November, 1932.\n\nIn 1932, the original section of the Courthouse was used by the United States Courts, including the U.S. Courtroom, the Grand Jury Room, the U.S. Bankruptcy Courtroom, offices for the officials connected with the courts and a GSA office. The addition housed the Pearl Street Station branch of the U.S. Postal Service and the offices of various federal agencies. The Pearl Street Station branch was removed in 1976.\n\nThe Courthouse is two stories high with a hip roof which encloses a third story. The roof slopes back to reveal dormer windows with arched pediments. Windows on the first two stories are elaborately treated with balustrade segments below them. They are surmounted by raised triangular or arched pediments. At the roof line a continuous frieze and dentil cornice and balustrade of open balusters and solid panels runs around the entire building. The exterior of the original building is granite which came from North Jay, Maine; and the granite for the addition came from Vermont. Many of the original finishes in the interior of the Courthouse are intact: marble and terrazzo flooring, molded wood trim, marble trim, molded plaster cornices. Of special interest is the building\u2019s formal entrance. The entrance leads into the elliptical rotunda, an elegant and open two-story foyer with refined classical detailing. The rotunda features a curving marble staircase with a balustrade of thin cast-iron balusters, rising to the second floor along the perimeter of the room.\n\nIn 1992, a major renovation project began to modernize and renovate the historic fabric of the building. Designs were prepared by Leers, Weinzapfel of Boston. The improvements included two full-sized district courtrooms and a magistrate judge\u2019s hearing room. A wholly new courtroom was constructed inside the old building. A wall painting, The Virtues of Good Government, is a frieze located just below the courtroom\u2019s skylight. The mural by Dorothea Rockburne is \u201ca modern contemplation on the virtues of prudence, faith, common good, hope and magnanimity, using pure geometry and vibrant color as meditative devices.\u201d The original Courtroom One was carefully restored to its original design including arched casement windows, period light fixtures, its original color palette, and replicated plaster moldings for the ceiling. Copies of the original chandeliers and wall sconces were crafted and installed in the original locations.\n\nThe Reopening Ceremony was held June 26, 1996. As a result of the project, the Edward T. Gignoux U.S. Courthouse was awarded an Institutional Preservation Award from Greater Portland Landmarks in 1999.\n\nIn 2012, in its 100th year, the Edward T. Gignoux U.S. Courthouse underwent an extensive exterior building envelope improvement to restore the roof and granite fa\u00e7ade, as well as some associated interior repairs. This work was completed in the summer of 2013"}, {"url": "https://snaccooperative.org/view/70090964", "page_content": "Joseph Sewall (1795-1851) was the son of Joseph Sewall (1770-1852) and Lydia Marsh Sewall (1773-1805) of Bath, Me.
