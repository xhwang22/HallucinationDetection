{"Joe Holland was named the WCAL Player of the Year as a senior in 2006\u201307.": [{"url": "https://volleyballmag.com/2022-vbm-boys-hs-all-americans-070522/", "page_content": "Dillon Klein of Loyola is the player of the year, Jonah Carson of St. Francis is the coach of the year, and the top team is Newport Harbor:\n\nWhen it comes to boys high school and club volleyball in this country, the attention quickly turns to Southern California \u2014 and rightfully so.\n\nThat region has pumped out countless future superstars over the years, both indoors and outdoors. And when it comes to the 2022 boys high school scene, the same remained true this spring (more on that in a bit).\n\nBut something special also was brewing in the Bay Area, where St. Francis High School of Mountain View, California, about 15 miles north of San Jose, won both CIF Central Section and CIF NorCal regional titles under the direction of semi-homegrown coach Jonah Carson.\n\nCarson is deservedly our 2022 VolleyballMag.com boys high school coach of the year. He\u2019s part of a clean Cali sweep with our boys high school awards.\n\nLoyola High School (Los Angeles, California) senior Dillon Klein is our player of the year (after earning the top-recruit status in our previously released 2022 Boys Fab 50 list), and Newport Harbor High School of Newport Beach, California, walks away with our team of the year award, replicating what St. Francis did up north with CIF Southern Section and SoCal Division I regional titles.\n\nBack to Carson and his Lancers squad, which went 38-2 on their way to winning West Coast Athletic League, CCS and NorCal titles.\n\nA Dallas, Texas-area native, Carson played at UC Santa Cruz (a 35-mile jaunt south from Mountain View) under now George Mason men\u2019s head coach Jay Hosack, and then returned to coach his Banana Slugs alma mater for six years. Carson then moved on to be an assistant at Pacific under Joe Wortmann before landing at St. Francis, where he teaches English.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be at a value-based institution and St. Francis has a lot of good qualities,\u201d said Carson, who also is the boys director at Mountain View Volleyball Club.\n\nCarson has now won three CCS titles at St. Francis and is enjoying his first NorCal regional crown. It was St. Francis\u2019 second NorCal title and sixth CCS title in program history.\n\n\u201cIt was three years of grinding together and developing a team and a group of guys that really wanted to be great,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won CCS in 2021 and in 202 we felt we had a good, young team, but we got cut short because of COVID. We started talking then about the opportunity we had as a group and how good we could be.\n\n\u201cThe guys really bought into it. Everyone had a lot of challenges going on through COVID with academics, social-skill wise and athletics. Our guys did an incredible job coming into the gym and giving it their best effort and learning how to get better. We had a group of guys that figured out how to play well together, and that is pretty cool.\u201d\n\nSt. Francis\u2019 beat in-town Mountain View High School for both the CCS and NorCal regional titles. The Lancers\u2019 only two losses came to Mater Dei (Santa Ana, California) in the Best of the West tournament and to Mountain View in the final of the Bellarmine tournament in San Jose \u2014 a contest where St. Francis was missing two starters. Carson feels that match may have been the turning point for this group.\n\n\u201cWe had some role players step up and help us win some really big matches, one against Servite to get us to the finals,\u201d Carson explained. \u201cEven though we lost in the finals, I think that tournament solidified our belief that we are good and we can win matches where everybody on the team has to contribute. That showed us we had a really special team. That Bellarmine tournament set a pretty high standard for us and it paid off in CCS and Nor Cal.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s team also was loaded with frontline talent.\n\nSenior 6-8 middle blocker Ethan Watson was the WCAL player of the year and earned 2022 VolleyballMag.com All-American first-team honors. He\u2019s headed to Pepperdine.\n\nSenior outside hitter Jerry Feng (VBM All-American second team), senior setter Ryan Morey (headed to Carthage College in Kenosha, Wisconsin) and junior outside hitter Jack Ebertin (committed to USC) also played key roles, as did senior libero Joe Wallace (son of former Santa Clara women\u2019s head coach Jon Wallace). Wallace, a 2022 VBM honorable-mention All-American pick, is uncommitted at the moment.\n\n\u201cJoe Wallace is a stud libero,\u201d Carson said. \u201cSomeone will pick him up. He\u2019s too good.\u201d\n\nSt. Francis, which was also shorthanded in the CIF playoffs, played the vast majority of the season without 6-9 senior middle and UCLA commit Chris Hersh, who was injured early-on.\n\n\u201cJonah is directly responsible for our success,\u201d Ebertin said, \u201cnot only bringing in a great group of guys to the program, but also developing us as players. He does a great job teaching the basic skills and making tactical decisions throughout the season. I think he\u2019s a great coach because he finds unique ways in practice to prepare us for matches. He does a good job firing the team up for important games, but also stays calm and collecting when we are struggling.\u201d\n\nCarson said he a group this season that got it done both in and out of the classroom.\n\n\u201cThere were good with the academics, but we also had savvy volleyball guys on this team,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got this group together and looked around and said, \u2018Hey, we are a special team.\u2019 I have been coaching long enough where you can feel it and the guys felt it. The started to believe it. They looked around and said we can be pretty good. They had that understanding and they pulled it together.\u201d\n\nLoyola\u2019s Klein, our 2022 VolleyballMag.com boys high school player of the year, was named the CIF Southern Section Division I co-player of the year along with Newport Harbor 6-7 senior middle blocker James Eadie.\n\nKlein, inbound to USC, is the grandson of former Trojans and Los Angeles Rams tight end Bob Klein. His father, Jimmy, played football and volleyball at Stanford, while his aunt, Kristin Klein Keefe, was a four-time Stanford women\u2019s volleyball All-American and was the 1991 national player of the year. Cousins Caitlin and Michaela Keefe played on Stanford volleyball teams that won three NCAA titles (2016, 2018 and 2019).\n\nKlein, a 6-4 outside hitter, helped perennial national power Loyola advance to the finals of both the CIF Southern Section and SoCal championships, losing to Newport Harbor both times.\n\nSpeaking of Newport Harbor, coach Eric Vallely\u2019s squad won its final eight matches of the season that included a couple of return-the-favor-type victories. Harbor\u2019s last loss came on April 5 to Los Alamitos in five on the road. The Sailors avenged that loss in the opening round of the Southern Section Division I playoffs. Harbor also lost to Loyola earlier in the season, but got that win back with a hard-fought five-setter in the Southern Section final and then swept the Cubs to win the SoCal regional title on their home surface.\n\nJake Read, who is joined on the VBM All-American first team by teammates Eadie and Curci, had 18 kills in the SoCal final, while Curci had 12 and Eadie ended with seven kills and five blocks, giving Harbor its second regional title in program history and first since 2019.\n\nLoyola\u2019s Klein is joined on the VBM All-American first team by teammate and senior setter Ryan Sprague, while senior outside Owen Loncar and senior middle blocker Ryan Vena rep the Cubs on the second team.\n\nThe remainder of the All-American first team includes St. Louis-area standout Ethan Jennings (Parkway West), Mountain View senior outside Patrick Kane, suburban Chicago junior Jakobi Lange, and Hawai\u2019i product Aidan Tune (of perennial island power Punahou), along with Phoenix product Zach Rama (Sandra Day O\u2019Connor High) and Florida state star Ryan Peluso.\n\nRama, if you recall, was the runner-up to Loyola\u2019s Klein as the top two recruits in the 2022 VolleyballMag.com Boys Fab 50 list, while the Long Beach State-bound Peluso helped lead his Winter Park (Florida) team to a state title and was named 2022 Florida Mr. Volleyball. Peluso surpassed the 1,000 career barrier in kills, assists and digs at the Orlando-area school.\n\nO\u2019Connor, with multiple Fab 50 selections on the roster, went 44-0 and won the Arizona 6A state title. Rama finished with 447 kills as the Eagles\u2019 top pin option and hit .440. The Eagles also were strongly considered for national team of the year honors.\n\nPlayer of the Year: Dillon Klein (Loyola)\n\nTeam of the Year: Newport Harbor\n\nCoach of the Year: Jonah Carson (St. Francis)\n\nFirst-Team\n\nName Ht.

Serra lost badly in the state game to national No. 1 Mater Dei-Santa Ana, but it was still a historic season for Tom Brady\u2019s alma mater nonetheless. What will the Padres do for an encore? They\u2019ll know where they stand in Northern California after two games. Serra opens the season on Aug. 26 at Folsom and then travels to De La Salle for an ESPNU matchup on Sept. 2. If the Padres win both of those games, they might be on their way to another Open title game. Of course, that\u2019s easier written than achieved. Walsh, the team\u2019s longtime coach, likes what he has at the skill positions. WR/CB Joey Villaroman returns after missing last season with a knee injury suffered during the 2021 COVID spring season. \u201cHuge potential,\u201d Walsh said. Junior Joseph Bey, who has played on varsity since his freshman year, will lead the defensive secondary from a safety position and play running back. Jabari Mann and Danny Niu stand out as linebackers and also will play running back. Ryan Silver will anchor the lines, and Seamus Gilmartin will contribute at tight end and defensive end. Walsh, entering his 22nd season, said the challenge will be finding players to step up on the lines. Sam Goligoski could be a surprise as a defensive end, Walsh noted.\n\nSeason opener: Aug. 26 at Folsom, 7 p.m.\n\nNo. 2 ST. FRANCIS\n\nCoach: Greg Calcagno\n\nFall 2021 record: 11-1\n\nWhat to expect: For 11 games and 45-plus minutes in the 12th, St. Francis had a perfect season last fall. The Lancers ended De La Salle\u2019s 30-year unbeaten streak against regional opponents. They rolled through the West Catholic Athletic League on their way to the league title. They won their first two CCS playoff games and were leading Serra down the stretch in the final. But a surreal finish remembered for gunshots fired in the parking lot late in the fourth quarter ended with Serra celebrating a 16-12 victory. St. Francis graduated much of its stout defense and record-setting running back Viliami Teu, the Bay Area News Group\u2019s player of the year in 2021. But Calcagno, entering his 10th season, has another strong offensive line and a quarterback returning from injury who knows how to win a big game. The final pass Matthew Dougherty threw last season was the one to beat De La Salle. He\u2019s back this fall. \u201cFully healthy and excited to see what he can do for us,\u201d Calcagno said about the 6-6, 215-pound senior. OT Oliver Bari (6-4, 265) and C Alex Bobadilla (6-3, 275) are back on the line. S Keala Keanaaina is one of the few returning starters on defense. He also will play running back. Andrew Adkison is back at receiver and will play cornerback. The Lancers visit De La Salle on Sept. 9. Two weeks later, they play host to Serra in a league opener. They\u2019ll know a lot more about themselves after those games.\n\nSeason opener: Aug. 26 vs. Central Catholic-Modesto, 7 p.m.\n\nNo. 3 BELLARMINE\n\nCoach: Jalal Beauchman\n\nFall 2021 record: 8-4\n\nWhat to expect: The Bells are heading in the right direction under coach Jalal Beauchman, who enters his second fall season and third overall. Last year, Bellarmine was an exciting and vastly improved team that reached the semifinals of the CCS Division I playoffs. But in games against the WCAL\u2019s top teams, Serra and St. Francis, Bellarmine remained several steps behind. Maybe that will change this fall as the storied San Jose program returns RB Ben Pfaff, along with lineman Jae\u2019Von Reels and LB Brandon Broch to the defense. Phaff was the WCAL\u2019s junior of the year last season. Broch deflected the pass at the line of scrimmage that Thomas Di Vittorio intercepted and returned 94 yards for a TD to dramatically beat Los Gatos in the CCS playoffs. If Broch isn\u2019t the best LB in the CCS, Beauchman believes he\u2019s in the neighborhood. Philip Miller will be counted on to cover in the defensive secondary and catch passes at wide receiver. Senior Nate Escalada and junior Parker Threatt, both 6-foot-1 and 180 pounds, are competing to play quarterback. The Bells play three non-league road games \u2014 against Menlo-Atherton, San Leandro and MyClymonds \u2014 before starting WCAL play.\n\nSeason opener: Aug. 27 at Menlo-Atherton, 2 p.m.\n\nNo. 4 ST. IGNATIUS\n\nCoach: John Regalia\n\nFall 2021 record: 5-7\n\nWhat to expect: In the season before the pandemic, St. Ignatius shared the WCAL title with Serra and Valley Christian. The Wildcats followed that up with a 3-1 record in the COVID spring season in 2021 and a 5-7 mark last fall that ended with a loss to Wilcox in the CCS Division II playoffs. Regalia, now in his 12th season as the program\u2019s head coach, said this year\u2019s team \u201cbrings a great competitive drive and mindset to the work and preparation we have put in so far this offseason. The excitement is high as we look to put that into action this fall season.\u201d Senior QB Davin McAndrews is back after making an impact down the stretch last season. \u201cDynamic, versatile athlete that has gained command of the offensive system,\u201d Regalia said. Linemen Santino Franco and John O\u2019Brien will be responsible for protecting McAndrews and opening holes for the runners. Franco is a three-year starter on offense and defense. OLB/TE Luke Leupold is a returning all-WCAL player, as is WR/DB Gus Parker. The San Francisco school has added lights to its stadium, which the Wildcats will debut on opening night against Palo Alto.\n\nSeason opener: Aug. 26 vs. Palo Alto, 7 p.m.\n\nNo. 5 ARCHBISHOP RIORDAN\n\nCoach: Adhir Ravipati\n\nFall 2021 record: 5-5\n\nWhat to expect: The last time we saw Adhir Ravipati as a head coach on a high school sideline, he was celebrating a state championship with Menlo-Atherton. That was in 2018. Four years later, he has taken over the program at Riordan, which hasn\u2019t finished above .500 since going 9-4 and reaching a CCS final in 2015. Last fall, the Crusaders were 5-5 but 2-5 in the WCAL. Ravipati notes that the senior class, offensive line and athletic skill-position players are the team\u2019s strengths. Depth at the skill positions and the first year in a new system and culture are the weaknesses, the coach added. The talent starts with DL Isiah Chala, a 6-5, 260-pound three-star senior who has an offer from Cal. Senior WR/DB Zachary Jones, a preseason all-Bay Area News Group pick, is among the region\u2019s fastest players, Ravipati said. The coach added that senior RB/WR/DB Javius Redding will be one of the area\u2019s best players and a contender for WCAL player of the year. \u201cElectric playmaker on offense and elite cover skills/open field tackling ability on defense,\u201d Ravipati said. Freshman QB Mike Mitchell Jr. could be a breakout star, and sophomore OL Losipini Tupou is a returning starter with an offer from San Jose State.\n\nSeason opener: Aug. 27 vs. Granada, 2 p.m.\n\nNo. 6 VALLEY CHRISTIAN\n\nCoach: Mike Machado\n\nFall 2021 record: 6-5\n\nWhat to expect: The perennial WCAL contender could take a few steps back this season. Five-star senior receiver Jurrion Dickey transferred to Menlo-Atherton, and QB Jakson Berman, who received first-team all-Bay Area News Group honors after accounting for 40 touchdowns last season, has graduated. Coupled with the fact Valley Christian didn\u2019t have a JV team last fall after a drop in participation numbers brought on by the pandemic, the Warriors could be in for a rare rebuilding year under longtime coach Mike Machado, whose demeanor remains positive. \u201cTo feel sorry for yourself would be inappropriate,\u201d the coach said. Valley has only seven seniors on its roster. The team will be \u201cvery young and inexperienced,\u201d Machado noted, adding that he has a \u201cgreat group of young men.\u201d Senior TE/DE Tyler Bourland is a three-star prospect with offers from Nevada and Northern Colorado. The Warriors also will count on a trio of juniors: OL/DL Rayne Mayo, WR Kai Hamilton and halfback Uchenna Eke. OL/DL Champ Taulealea (6-4, 325) is a talented sophomore and college prospect.\n\nSeason opener: Aug. 26 vs. Wilcox, 7 p.m.\n\nNo. 7 SACRED HEART CATHEDRAL\n\nCoach: Antoine Evans\n\nFall 2021 record: 8-7\n\nWhat to expect: Antoine Evans has taken over from Barry McLaughlin, who stepped down after leading the San Francisco school to a Division 4-A state championship. The Fightin\u2019 Irish went 3-7 in the regular season last fall, then won five consecutive playoff games to capture section, regional and state titles. LB/RB Jerry Mixon (6-3, 230) is among the returning standouts. He recently committed to the University of Oregon. Senior OLB/WR RL Miller is an Arizona State commit. \u201cAt 6-4 with hands it\u2019s going to be very hard for opposing defensive to stop him,\u201d Evans said. Senior Jordan Solofa-Fatu and junior Benjamin Hatch anchor the offensive and defensive lines, and Isaiah Keishk is a three-year starter at wide receiver.\n\nSeason opener: Aug. 26 vs. Sacred Heart Prep at Kezar Stadium, 7 p.m.\n\nNo. 8 ARCHBISHOP MITTY\n\nCoach: Danny Sullivan\n\nFall 2021 record: 1-9\n\nWhat to expect: Mitty could be better than this projection. The Monarchs return a roster of 70-plus players, including nearly 40 who have been on the varsity team since the spring 2021 COVID season. \u201d A successful summer of workouts, 7-on-7, and line work has created a belief that things will be different in 2022,\u201d coach Danny Sullivan said. The Monarchs went 0-7 in WCAL play last fall and were 0-3 in the COVID season, all against WCAL opponents. Senior WR Danny Scudero could help flip the script. \u201cHe is a matchup nightmare who runs a 4.42 (40-yard dash) and is able to create space in the passing game,\u201d Sullivan said. Senior Wills Towers (6-3, 210) returns as the starting quarterback. He will be surrounded by Scudero, senior RB/DB Justice Toavalu and senior WR Ben Kim. Senior Michael Forney will be a presence on the offensive and defensive lines.\n\nSeason opener: Aug. 26 vs. Palma at Foothill College, 7 p.m.\n\nComplete digital access\n\nThis is part of the Bay Area News Group\u2019s high school football preview package.

The Smithies won the inaugural postseason game before falling the next week in the state Div. V semifinals.\n\nThe 1997 Waynedale team reached the Div. V state semis as well, winning a then-league-record 12 games against just one defeat.\n\nAnd just last fall, the 2002 state runner-up Smithville team outdid all the rest, finishing 14-1. The Green Machine became the first WCAL team to play in a state title game, where it dropped a 33-18 contest to Marion Pleasant in Div. V.\n\nThose powerhouses, along with an unbeaten Dalton squad from 1961 and the school's 2002 regional final squad, Waynedale's '73 and '78 squads and the once-beaten Rittman '86 team have been selected by The Daily Record sports staff as the WCAL's Golden Anniversary all-time top 10 teams.\n\nThe following is a further look at the top 10 all-time teams from the WCAL's first 50 years, starting with the oldest squad and working up to last year.\n\n1956 Doylestown Chippewas (9-0, 6-0 WCL)\n\nThe first powerhouse of the WCAL remains one of its greatest dynasties.\n\nDoylestown (now referred to as Chippewa High School) shared the first WCL league title in 1954 with Dalton by going 7-2 (3-1) under coach Ken Black. He then directed the school to a perfect season (9-0, 3-0) the next fall before turning the reins over to Sam Yelic, who led the '56 Chipps to a second straight 9-0 campaign.\n\nThe '56 Chipps were the most dominant of any of the school's early powerhouses, outscoring opponents by a 363-44 margin. The league expanded from four schools to seven that year, and Doylestown overpowered conference rivals by a 274-19 margin.\n\nLeading the way for the Chippewas were first-team all-league performers Jerry Galehouse (end), Jon Galehouse (quarterback), Gene Hummel (halfback) and Ron Williams (center). Tackles Elwin Bachman and Mike Higgins were second-team all-stars.\n\n\"We just had a lot of real good athletes on that 1956 team,\" said Williams, who went on to start for Bowling Green on the 1959 college division national title squad. \"When we graduated we had a 21-game winning streak.\n\n\"We had a good coach, good players and everyone really worked together.\"\n\nWith the Galehouse cousins at quarterback and receiver the Chipps were a constant threat to throw the ball, but could hurt opponents with the run as well.\n\n\"It was a great offense to play on,\" Williams said. \"Our offense was a combination of run and pass and that made us very difficult to defend.\"\n\n1961 Dalton Bulldogs (8-0-1, 5-0-1 WCL)\n\nThe '61 Bulldogs were quarterbacked by Dutch Martin, who legendary coach Billie J. McFarren let call his own plays almost all the time.\n\n\"We let our quarterbacks call 95 percent of the plays because if after coming up in our system they didn't know what we wanted they shouldn't be out there,\" said McFarren, 79, who lives a stone's throw from Bulldogs Stadium.\n\nHowever, Martin, part of what the coach called \"a very intelligent team,\" got frustrated over play-calling during a game at senior running back Larry Zuercher (the AP's class \"A\" state back of the year).\n\n\"That darn Zuercher,\" McFarren recalled being surprised to hear Martin complain on the sidelines.\n\n\"I asked 'What did Larry do?'\" McFarren said. \"Martin told me 'I just started to set up the defense and Zuercher had to go and run for another 40-yard touchdown. Why don't you take him out once so I can run some plays?'\"\n\nSuch was the \"good\" problem the '61 Bulldogs had. With a back like Zuercher and a team committed to blocking for him, every play was a possible touchdown. Zuercher (5-foot-8, 165) averaged an incredible 14 yards a carry as he ran for 1,585 yards and 29 TDs on just 113 carries.\n\n\"Larry was a phenomenal back,\" McFarren said. \"He was also very smart. He didn't say much, but was a great young man.\"\n\nPaving the way for Zuercher were first-team all-league two-way linemen Bob Geisler and Bill Karcagi. Also named all-stars were Larry McCullough (DB) and Bob Renner (DT). McCullough (5-6, 130) was sarcastically referred to as \"Moose\" by his teammates, but was tough as nails and was a key blocking back for Zuercher.\n\nThe Bulldogs missed a perfect season when Norwayne tied them 8-8 in the season finale.\n\n1966 Dalton Bulldogs (10-0, 7-0 WCL)\n\nMcFarren won nine WCAL titles in 21 seasons at Dalton, but described his '66 team as probably the \"strongest.\" It was also the league's first 10-0 team as most schools had gone from nine- to 10-game seasons only a few years earlier.\n\nDalton outscored opponents 289-57 as it gave up double-digit points only once in a 16-12 win over Waynedale.\n\n\"That was a real close group of guys,\" McFarren said. \"The team was more balanced than in '61. It would be hard to pick out stars from that team because there were so many good players.\"\n\nWCL coaches voted six Dalton players to the league's all-star team: Mark Berg (QB), Fred Blosser (DE), Larry Huff (SE-HB), Doby Hunter (DB), Mike McFarren (C) and Cecil McGraner (E). Huff was a secret weapon on the halfback pass, completing 6-of-8 passes for five TDs. Gordon Ober was a strong junior runner, while Bruce Nussbaum was another key lineman.\n\nBlosser went on to play for Kent State where he was named a captain and today is Dalton's school superintendent.\n\n1973 Waynedale Golden Bears (9-0, 7-0 WCL)\n\nHow good were the '73 Golden Bears?\n\n\"We led the whole season except for eight seconds,\" said coach Bill Kjerrumgaard. \"Wire to wire, we were pretty much dominant.\"\n\nIndeed, Waynedale had a 302-59 final scoring margin as it won all but one game by 14 or more points.\n\nKjerrumgaard brought a slightly different wrinkle with him as a coach by spreading his offense, but like many of the great WCAL teams the Bears still used the run as their bread-and-butter.\n\n\"We'd have two wideouts and a slotback at times, with the quarterback under center,\" the coach known as KJ said. \"We were more wide open in our formations than a lot of teams, but we still wanted to run it.\"\n\nJon Thompson was the star runner as he scored 102 points in league games and was named honorable mention UPI \"AA\" All-Ohio. Other standouts on the team were All-WCAL picks Chuck Donley (OT-DT), Jim Gessel (FB-LB), Roger Miller (G-LB), Mark Pringle (RB-DB) and Les Thompson (DL). Sophomore quarterback Matt Amstutz stepped in after the team had narrowly missed winning league titles the previous seasons and played well also.\n\nAlthough the OHSAA began holding annual state playoffs in 1972, there were only three divisions back then. Only four schools in each class made the postseason until it was expanded in 1980.\n\n\"Nowadays a perfect season in the WCAL would guarantee a postseason ticket,\" said Kjerrumgaard, who later went on to coach at Triway. \"Because of the playoff situation back then we didn't get to go. It's too bad because I think we could have done well, but who knows for sure.\"\n\n1978 Waynedale Golden Bears (9-0, 7-0 WCL)\n\nWhen Jeff Souers thought back a quarter century ago to his '78 Bears, the first thing he remembered was \"teamwork.\"\n\n\"We had a group of guys who truly liked each other,\" said Souers, now an assistant at The College of Wooster. It was easy for that team to feel good about one another. They won big (251-58 overall scoring margin) and lots of people contributed.\n\n\"Our fullback, Galen Mast, ran for right around 600 yards and 12 TDs in nine games,\" Souers said. \"Our two tailbacks, Brian Troyer and Rick Drouhard, combined for better than 600 yards, too. And our passing game was the strength.\"\n\nWhat people remember most about the '78 Bears was the pass-and-catch combination of UPI \"AA\" first-team All-Ohioans Paul Troyer and Bruce Miller, who hooked up for another 789 yards and 12 TDs. For the season, Troyer was 76-of-142 passing for 1,290 yards and 15 TDs.\n\n\"They were quite a passing combo and everyone knew them that year after three years together,\" Souers said. \"They hooked up for a number of deep posts and fades and Paul could also throw the long out cut. He just had a real gun.\"\n\nAlong with Mast, Troyer and Miller, Ross Miller (OL) and Mike Pritt (C-LB) were all-league selections.\n\n\"We had a tremendous defense, too,\" Souers said. \"We had four shutouts and only gave up an average of 2.1 yards per rush. It was really a great team to coach. Our motto to start the season was 'Great in '78' and that's the way it turned out.\"\n\nLike the '73 Bears the playoff picture didn't even come close to materializing. The unbeaten '78 group finished seventh in its region, which only took two teams and included the likes of Youngstown Cardinal Mooney, Akron Buchtel and Orrville.\n\n1984 Smithville Smithies (10-2, 7-0 WCAL)\n\nThe WCAL's first playoff team nearly had its hopes dashed in the first week of the season after a 13-12 loss to Indian Valley North.\n\nHowever, the Smithies ran the table from there and in a tournament that was expanded to five divisions in 1980 earned the first postseason trip for a WCAL team.\n\nSmithville defeated Windham 6-0 in a mud bowl at Massillon Perry in the first playoff game to win its region, but then fell 41-6 against eventual state champ Newark Catholic at Dover.\n\n\"Really, we had Newark Catholic worried in the first half,\" said Keith Schrock, currently in his 27th year as Smithies coach. \"We played pretty tough.\n\n\"We were getting pressure on their quarterback (Shane Montgomery, who went on to set numerous records at NC State) with our ends, Frank Besancon and Ron Fuller. They were doing five-step drops on pass plays and their answer (to the pressure) was seven-step drops and they still winged the ball all over the place.\"\n\nSchrock, who still has assistants Chuck Saris and Bill Hardman from that team on his staff, said the '84 Smithies (229-102 scoring margin) were a well-balanced group. Running back-linebacker Mike Smith was voted the WCAL MVP and joined on the first team by Besancon (first-team All-Ohio), Fuller, Gary Herron (WR) and Rob Meadows (LB).\n\n1986 Rittman Indians (10-2, 7-0 WCAL)\n\nBefore taking his coaching talents to The College of Wooster, Mike Schmitz enjoyed a strong seven-year run at Rittman. His best Indians team was his second to last, an '86 group that boasted one of the greatest defenses in WCAL history.\n\nRittman surrendered only three touchdowns in league play as it steamrolled foes by a 241-20 margin. In fact, the Tribe gave up an average of just 4.4 points a game overall until it fell 18-9 against Castalia Margaretta in the first round of the Div. V playoffs.\n\nDonny Mutters (FB-LB) was named the WCAL MVP and joined on the first team by teammates Todd Brewer (OL-DL), Ron Craddock (TE-OLB), Jon Tomlinson (WR-DB) and Specialty POTY Tom Lycans (K-P).\n\n1997 Waynedale Golden Bears (12-1, 7-0 WCAL)\n\nWith the playoffs expanded to six divisions in 1994 it meant more teams than ever made the postseason, but it also took more wins to capture a state title.\n\nThe '97 Bears were nearly up to the task. They took their fans on a thrilling ride that saw them defeat Dalton (28-22) in a battle of unbeatens to close the regular season and then win playoff games over Black River (28-14) and Orwell Grand Valley (14-12) before falling in the state semis to eventual state champ Liberty Center (44-8). When it was all said and done, the powerful Bears had a whopping 448-131 scoring edge over the opposition.\n\n\"That was the first 10-0 regular season for Waynedale,\" said coach Bill Seder, now in his 14th year as coach. \"That was the year both Dalton and us were both 9-0 entering the final game and we beat them to put a culmination on the perfect season.\n\n\"Then to go on to the state semifinals was quite a trip in the playoffs. We had a real nice mix of talented classes back to back that really complemented each other. It was a great group of guys.\"\n\nThe unquestioned leader of the team was senior fullback-linebacker Matt Zuercher, who racked up 559 tackles in his career and ran for better than 2,500 career yards. Other top performers included Todd Miller (QB-DB), Chris Zimmer (OL), Brody Hewitt (DL), Brandon Hewitt (LB) and Matt Steffen (LB-P).\n\n2002 Dalton Bulldogs (11-2, 6-1 WCAL)\n\nAfter setting a single-season school record for wins, the '02 Bulldogs earned the right to be called one of the 10 best teams of the WCAL's first 50 years. However, they will be remembered most by many for two memorable games they didn't win.\n\nDalton played toe-to-toe with eventual league champion and Div. V state runner-up Smithville in Week 8 of the regular season before being stunned with two fourth-quarter touchdowns in a 21-19 loss. The Bulldogs closed out the regular season with two easy wins and then won playoff games against Springfield (35-28) and Middlefield Cardinal (38-14) before dropping a regional final rematch to Smithville 35-8 in the first playoff meeting between WCAL schools. A crowd of more than 6,000 fans jammed into Orrville's Red Rider Stadium to watch the Smithies-Bulldogs playoff game.\n\n\"That game probably drew the biggest crowd to watch a game in Wayne County regardless of who was playing,\" Dalton coach Bob Ramsay said. \"I think as my people can attest to I was glad the game was played there, I just wasn't too happy with the outcome.\n\n\"It was a great season overall and it was the farthest Dalton has gone in the playoffs. That team definitely ranks with 1996 (10-1, lost to eventual Div. VI state champion Mogadore in playoff opener) as one of my top teams here.\"\n\nDalton senior quarterback Mark Jameson was named the WCAL Player of the Year and earned second-team All-Ohio honors after converting from wide receiver. He came within seven passing yards of becoming the league's first player to rack up both 1,000 yards rushing and passing in the same season.\n\nAlso taking second-team All-Ohio honors were then-juniors Derek Jackson (RB) and Justin Stutz (OL), along with senior Pete Kiko (DL). Jackson led area rushers in attempts (303), yards (1,610) and touchdowns (25). The Bulldogs finished with a 375-179 scoring edge.\n\n2002 Smithville Smithies (14-1, 7-0 WCAL)\n\nSchrock and his assistant coaches wondered for many years if the Smithies, or any WCAL team for that matter, could ever reach a state championship game.\n\nAfter winning two games apiece in the '00 and '01 playoffs, including upsetting two-time defending state champion Amanda-Clearcreek on its home field 15-12 in '01, the Smithies saw the light at the end of the tunnel. They knew it was possible to go all the way, but they also told their players they'd need to work even harder to do it.\n\nThe '02 Smithies won playoff games over Newton Falls (21-20), defending state champion Bedford Chanel (17-9), Dalton and three-time state champion Delphos St. John's (27-20) before falling to Marion Pleasant (33-18) in the title game. The Smithies actually led early in the fourth quarter before being blitzed with an unanswered 20-point rally.\n\n\"You're going to play more games in the playoffs nowadays and you have to be ready each week,\" Schrock said. \"So that was the incredible thing last season for us to win 14 games. It was a heckuva team last year and it was a heckuva run. It was a very close-knit team that really played its best in the playoffs. I think we were lucky to stay injury-free and put closure on so many wins.\"\n\nThree players were named first-team All-Ohio: linebackers Caleb Middleton (junior) and Kyle Kauffman (senior), along with senior offensive lineman Jason Indermuhle. Additionally, seniors Andy Foster (QB-DB) and Seth Hostetler (OL-DL) were selected named Special Mention All-Ohio.\n\nMiddleton led the team with 187 tackles and drew comparisons from Schrock to former Ohio State and Miami Dolphins player Larry Kolic, a Smithville All-Ohioan whose senior team went 8-2 in 1980. Kauffman logged 118 stops, ran for 992 yards and scored 159 points as the kicker and leading-TD scorer. Foster passed for 953 yards, 14 TDs and five INTs, with arguably his two biggest throws of the year coming on scoring strikes to Drew Beichler in the fourth quarter to beat Dalton in the regular season. Junior Eric Beichler was another star, rushing for 1,194 yards and 10 scores, while leading the team with seven INTs and making 118 tackles.\n\nDon't blame the '02 Smithies and Bulldogs if they're not quite in the mood to reminisce like earlier teams. With a game tonight between one another at Smithville, a league title and playoff spots still hang in the balance between the Smithies, Bulldogs and Golden Bears.\n\nPerhaps one of those teams will get a head start this season on becoming one of the greatest squads of the next 50 years.\n\nInformation for this series was obtained from interviews, Daily Record files and Michael Paul Vasas' 1988 book \"A History of Wayne County Football.\"\n\nAaron Dorksen can be reached at (330) 287-1621 or adorksen@the-daily-record.com."}, {"url": "https://pac-12.com/article/2021/11/10/mens-golf-signs-daniel-heo-nathan-wang-2022-signing-class", "page_content": "BERKELEY \u2013 California men's golf signed a pair of incoming freshman to its 2022 signing class in Daniel Heo and Nathan Wang.

Although playing just one season for the Colts, he left his mark on the program. Known for his big serve and strong ground strokes, Maguire overpowered opponents at the collegiate level. Rocky was the team\u2019s #1 singles player and won the Northern California and State Singles Championships in the \u201974 season.\n\nThat same year, Maguire went to Kalamazoo, Michigan and won the United States Tennis Association Junior Boys 18 & Under Junior Title\u2013 the most prestigious youth tournament in tennis, with doubles partner Francisco Gonzalez.

He was named All SPAL 1st Team three times and became the soccer programs all-time leading goal scorer. The forward came to Ca\u00f1ada and played under the Colts Hall of Fame Coach Sil Vial. At Ca\u00f1ada, Polla was switched to central midfielder and earned Camino Norte Conference Most Valuable Player, All-State and All- American honors.\n\nThat same year, 1975, Garibay was selected to represent the United States in soccer at the Pan American games in Mexico City. In 1976, Garibay left the Ca\u00f1ada soccer program to once again represent his country with the US Olympic team during the qualifying campaign for the 1976 Olympics.\n\nUnfortunately, the US would lose their final classification game to Mexico in a home and away series. A highlight during his tenure with the Olympic team was playing games at Mexico City\u2019s famed Azteca Stadium, at that time the world\u2019s second largest stadium with a capacity of 120,000 spectators. With the North American Soccer League starting to dismantle, Garibay gave up his dream of pursuing professional soccer, instead opting for a career in hair styling and has been in the profession for over 30 years.\n\nPolla is single and owns a salon in Menlo Park.\n\nThe Colts Lifetime Achievement Award\n\nMoises Alou - Baseball\n\nOne of the most notable families in Major League Baseball, Moises is the son of legendary San Francisco Giant former player and manager Felipe Alou. Like his father, Moises had a 17 year Major League career playing from 1990 \u2013 2008. The self-stated best right handed hitter in the National League backed it up with these numbers: A .303 career batting average, 332 home runs and 1,287 RBI\u2019s. The second pick overall in the 1986 MLB amateur draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates, Moises played for 7 National League teams, including the Giants in 2005-06. He twice won time Silver Slugger Award, given to the best offensive player at each position. Alou was a World Series Champion in 1997 with the Florida Marlins and earned the Babe Ruth Award which is given to the Most Valuable Player of the post season by contributing 9 hits, 9 RBI\u2019s and 3 home runs in the World Series alone.

The interviewer was given the phone numbers for the ex-Cornell football star, the same guy who then graduated from Harvard Law School.\n\n\n\nCould the numbers be right? The home number was in the \"212\" area code - New York City. The work number was in the \"914\" area - in this case, White Plains in Westchester County.\n\n\n\nNow maybe the interviewer was being unfairly biased, but he thought to himself, \"Don't most New York metro lawyers do their days in the hustle and bustle, and then retreat to the burbs at night?\"\n\n\n\nNot Joe Holland.\n\n\n\nDriven by the values instilled in him by his parents, the dominant theme of Joe Holland's life has been giving something back to the community, or as he said with a Biblical reference, \"To whom much is given, much is required.\"\n\n\n\nThe story of Joe Holland begins with his father. Jerome Brud Holland was a football All-American at Cornell in the late 1930s. A March 1970 article about Brud Holland, the only one of 13 children from his family to go to college, stated it simply and sadly. \"Jerome Holland was not offered a job upon graduation; he was not even interviewed. This -- because he was black -- and American industry had no place for the educated black man in 1939.\"\n\n\n\nFaced with the unavoidable obstacle of skin color, Brud Holland chose to further his education with a masters degree from Cornell and a doctorate in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania. He began his working life as an educator, eventually holding the presidencies of two institutions of higher learning -- Delaware State College and Hampton Institute.\n\n\n\nIt was during this time that Brud Holland and his wife, Laura, began to raise a family. Joe was born in 1956, and at age seven he got his first taste of Ithaca, N.Y., attending his father's 25th Reunion. \"I remember going over to the football field and running around,\" Joe recalled. \"So I guess that was when the Big Red seed was first planted,\" he laughed. \"It was really that love of football that I remember from my childhood years. It was an early passion.\"\n\n\n\nHolland showed his talents at the Pop Warner level in Virginia. His mother still likes to tell the story of how Joe, who was the biggest and fastest player in the league, caused other parents to get together and have the rules changed. After his first year in Pop Warner, a 125-pound weight limit was enacted, and Holland no longer could play. The next athletic hurdle came Holland's way when his father became Richard Nixon's choice as U.S. Ambassador to Sweden. Joe was 13 at the time, and for three years he lived in a country where \"football\" was played with the feet. \"They put me out on the soccer field, and I kept wanting to grab the ball with my hands so the best position for me was in the goal,\" said Holland. Needless to say, he wasn't too keen on the European version of football.\n\n\n\nThe Hollands moved back to the States for Joe's junior year at Roosevelt High School in Yonkers, N.Y. Joe missed the coach-mandated preseason camp by one day, and that meant he could not start any games during his junior year. The rule may have not been too smart, but the coaching staff soon realized that getting Joe into games was. Holland played everywhere both sides of the ball -- as a junior and was dubbed the \"super sub.\"\n\n\n\nNo substitute role as a senior, however, and Joe wound up averaging more than 200 yards a game as a running back. He earned the attention of some of the top college football programs in the country -- Ohio State, Notre Dame, Penn State and Michigan. His choice came down to Michigan and Cornell, and he chose to take the athletic scholarship to Michigan.\n\n\n\n\"I have to say that I had visions of the Rose Bowl dancing in my head, but after a year there I was ready to come home,\" said Holland. \"I was the only ballplayer on the team from New York at the most competitive position -- running back. I found myself getting lost in the crowd because I was a good player, but I wasnt head-over-heels so talented that I stood out in a crowd.\"\n\n\n\n\"Coming home\" in this case meant transferring at Cornell. Because of NCAA rules, Holland had to sit out as a sophomore. A torn hamstring muscle hampered his junior season, and as a senior he was the blocking back in head coach Bob Blackman's I-formation offense. The Ivy League had a rule at the time that said a student could get an extra year of athletic eligibility while enrolled in graduate school. Holland took advantage, and the fall of 1978 became his year to shine.\n\n\n\nHe finished the year with 1,213 yards in the seven Ivy games, still the fourth-highest single-season rushing total in Ivy League history. Two games, in particular, stood out. Against Harvard, a game played in a driving rainstorm, Holland set what is still the Ivy League record for rushing attempts in a game with 55.\n\n\n\n\"I guess I wasn't aware just how much I had carried the ball. About the middle of the third quarter, my legs started cramping up,\" remembered Holland, \"and that had never happened before. I can remember after the game, [Cornell won, 25-20, on Holland's game-winning touchdown run, his fourth of the day to go with 244 yards rushing] on the bus ride back, my muscles stiffening up. And by the time we got back to Ithaca, I had to have some guys literally help me from the bus.\"\n\n\n\nThe Harvard game was the fourth of the year, and Holland's \"dream season\" came to a close with a 263-yard performance against Pennsylvania in the finale. \"My parents had been so supportive through all the low times,\" said Holland. \"They came to all the games when we were losing. The fact that we were able to turn it around and have a winning season ... it was really special.\"\n\n\n\nHolland earned third-team All-America honors from the Associated Press after he finished second in the country in rushing and scoring to Oklahoma's Billy Sims, the Heisman Trophy winner that year. He also was named Academic All-America for the second straight year.\n\n\n\nFootball was not quite finished for Holland after that big day against Penn. He played in the Japan Bowl senior all-star game and got some interest from professional teams. But the teams did not want to waste a draft pick because they knew that Holland had been accepted at Harvard Law School the previous year. Harvard allowed him to defer a year, but that wasn't going to happen again. Holland decided to forego the free agent offers and headed off to Harvard.\n\n\n\nFollowing Harvard, Holland had plenty of opportunities to \"go for the big money\" as he put it, but there was something else at work in his head. \"Growing up in the South during the 1960s -- Virginia was not right in the heart of the Civil Rights movement -- but I was exposed to the issues of the movement,\" Holland said.\" When I was making the decision about how I wanted to start my career, I wanted to make my life count for something important. As God has blessed me, I wanted to reach out and bless others.\"\n\n\n\nSo while many of his peers went off to large corporate firms, Holland moved to Harlem and opened up his own law practice. \"My motivation in going was to make a difference. There were some pressing needs that I wanted to try and meet. I decided the best way to meet those was to develop some initiatives that were responsive.\"\n\n\n\nHe established his law practice, but then he also founded a homeless shelter. Holland was quick to point out that his philosophy was not simply housing, but \"holistic housing\" housing not as an end, but as a means to restore the whole person. His HARKHOMES project continues to aid the homeless. Connected with that, he established the BETH-HARK Crisis Center for addicts and ex-offenders.\n\n\n\nHolland also created some small businesses to create employment opportunities for the community as well. Among those businesses is a Ben and Jerrys Ice Cream Store, which was featured in the Sept. 14, 1992, issue of People Magazine.\n\n\n\nThe Cornell Cooperative Extension-Harlem Literacy Project arose out of Holland's involvement as a trustee of the university. Cornell students come to Harlem in the summer to provide literacy training.\n\n\n\nAbout a year ago, Holland was approached by a not-for-profit agency to help in the production of a video series. It is a series of 10 lectures based on the practical life skills curriculum he developed at HARKHOMES to help individuals, as he says, \"move from a life of crisis to a life of self-sufficiency.\" He calls the curriculum, \"Holistic Hardware.\"\n\n\n\nIf all that werent enough, Holland was appointed by New York Governor George Pataki to serve as State Housing Commissioner in 1995 and 96. \"I came into it at a time when there was a budget deficit in New York,\" Holland said. \"The mandate that the Governor gave us was to downsize. We worked through those challenges and were able to come up with some new initiatives that ensured affordable housing was out there.\"\n\n\n\nHis political career, which meant a great deal of time away from home, was pleasantly short-circuited by his marriage in 1995 to Alisa Holland, and, later, the birth of the couples daughter, Shelby. They continue to live in Harlem, and Holland does not event mention the possibility of leaving.\n\n\n\nHolland also gets a lot of enjoyment out of his being a playwright. \"Homegrown,\" a play that he wrote based on his experiences with HARKHOMES, ran for 14 weeks in 1992 at the National Black Theater in Harlem.\n\n\n\nAnd, he is one of only three Ivy Leaguers -- Princeton's Bill Bradley and Cornell's Ellen Mayer Sabik are the others -- named to the GTE/CoSIDA Academic All-America Hall of Fame, and he remains an active member of their Speakers Bureau. This story will not end on a self-serving note, especially given the subject himself, but Holland had this to say about the Ivy League. \"I see it as the best of both worlds as far as athletics and academics. I never made it to the Rose Bowl, but I've gotten so much in return.\" \u2014 Chuck Yrigoyen\n\n\n\n"}]}
