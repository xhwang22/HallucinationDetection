{"Bob Miller played college football at the University of Michigan from 1964 to 1966.": [{"url": "https://www.vintagedetroit.com/lions-tackle-bob-miller-was-a-success-as-lineman-horseman/", "page_content": "Bob Miller was a man who always knew his own mind, even as a rookie. Detroit Lions quarterback Bobby Layne \u201cloved to give the younger players a hard time,\u201d linebacker Joe Schmidt once remembered. \u201cHe would make the younger players sing their school fight song or something dumb like that.\n\n\u201cWell, that never went over real big with Bob Miller. Layne could never get him to do what Bob didn\u2019t want to do anyway, and you could see it didn\u2019t go over real well with Layne. But that\u2019s just the way Bob is.\u201d\n\nOn a team filled with such stars as Layne, Schmidt, Leon Hart, and Doak Walker, the literally \u201cunsung\u201d Miller crashed pads in steady if unspectacular style at his left defensive tackle position. In a sense, he was the John Doe of the Lions\u2019 glory days. To this day, when his name is mentioned, it\u2019s often confused with that of Detroit Tigers bonus baby Bob Miller, who pitched four seasons at Briggs Stadium in the middle \u201850s.\n\nAccording to Schmidt, Miller \u201cwas a very good football player who could have been a great one except that he had a bad back.\u201d Bad back or not, Miller was one of just eight players to suit up for each of the Lions\u2019 six postseason games during the 1950s: four championship games against Cleveland (in 1952-54 and 1957) plus divisional playoff games against Los Angeles (1952) and San Francisco (1957). Not even Schmidt, Layne, Walker, and Yale Lary\u2014all Hall of Famers\u2014could claim that distinction. Overall, the 6-3, 245-pound standout from Virginia played seven seasons in Detroit, 1952 through 1958. He was good enough to be named a first-team starter by The Sporting News in 1956.\n\nCharacteristically, Miller retired from football on his own terms, though he had just turned 29, was making $11,500 a year (a good salary for the era), and still could have played a few more seasons.\n\n\u201cI got out of football when they started talking about trading me here, trading me there,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to go where they wanted me to go.\u201d Instead he became involved in a successful stamping business in Metro Detroit. He did well enough to spend the last quarter-century of his life with no financial worries. He carved out a third career\u2014after his NFL and industrial careers\u2014as a leading Michigan thoroughbred trainer and breeder.\n\nMiller first got into horse racing in the late 1970s. \u201cA friend took me over to Detroit Race Course, and I just kept coming back,\u201d he explained. \u201cI guess there was some of the same psychology involved in horse racing as there was in football. It meant working hard and it meant constantly learning the business. It also offered competition, and I could come and go as I pleased.\u201d\n\nAlong with his wife, Delphine, Miller operated Del-Rob Stables on their Clarkston farm. They had 870 winners out of 4,790 starts, including 59 stakes winners. \u201cRacing gives me that adrenaline rush the way football did,\u201d Miller once told a Chicago reporter after his filly came from eight lengths back to win a blanket finish at Hawthorne Race Course in Illinois. \u201cWhen my horse runs a big race, it\u2019s the way it was when I\u2019d make a big play.\u201d\n\nMiller was a familiar sight at race tracks, his suit pocket stuffed with cigars, until he died at age 76 in 2009. He presumably left with few regrets. As he once said, \u201cI\u2019ve never done anything I didn\u2019t want to do or that didn\u2019t make me happy.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://andscape.com/features/in-the-1960s-michigan-state-truly-helped-integrate-college-football/", "page_content": "As college football embraces its 150th season, black athletes have been at the center of that story.\n\nAs early as 1890, black athletes have played football at predominantly white universities. However, the catalyst for true integration of college football began with the success of Michigan State\u2019s 1965 and 1966 national championship teams, which featured 20 black players. This is the story of one of those players.\n\nJimmy Raye II was the quarterback of the 1966 national title team for the Spartans. Raye said his family assessed his escape from segregated Fayetteville, North Carolina, to take a chance at college football\u2019s promised land.\n\nFor Raye, a star football and basketball player among the all-black high school leagues in the early 1960s, the main concerns involved football.\n\n\u201cThe apprehension was about whether I\u2019d get to play the position [quarterback] that I wanted to play or whether I\u2019d be switched,\u201d Raye told The Undefeated, \u201cor that I had never played against white players.\u201d\n\nRaye, who went on to play defensive back in the NFL and enjoy a long coaching career, had climbed aboard Spartans coach Duffy Daugherty\u2019s \u201cunderground railroad,\u201d which brought in the first large influx of African American athletes from the South.\n\nFor Raye\u2019s mom, the concerns were strictly academic.\n\n\u201cMy mom\u2019s main concern \u2013 as we talked to the Michigan State coaches \u2013 was about whether I was going to get an education and graduate,\u201d said Raye, now 73 and living in the Fayetteville area. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about football. It was about whether I was going to get a degree.\n\n\u201cAt the time I was being recruited, I didn\u2019t think of it as any kind of social pioneering experience,\u201d Raye said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of it as being any first anything. I just went to play football and to get an education.\u201d\n\nRaye and his teammates were more trailblazers than pioneers.\n\nOther black players had played at predominantly white institutions before this great migration. Michigan State was not even the first school in its own state to field a black athlete. But Daugherty and his assistants built a network of coaches at segregated black high schools by holding clinics specifically for coaches barred from attending white football clinics and camps.\n\nAlthough the concept of separate but equal had been struck down in 1954 by the U.S. Supreme Court, a series of inappropriately named \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreements\u201d held that white universities could stymie black athletes. For instance, most Southern universities did not allow black athletic participation. And, in some cases, according to those agreements, black players would be held out of games against non-integrated white teams.\n\nBut gradually, schools in the Big Ten and PAC 10 chipped away at much of the racism that kept black athletes off the playing field.\n\nMeanwhile, in the 1960s and \u201970s, several historically black college and university (HBCU) teams earned multiple black college national championships, including Grambling, North Carolina A&T, Alcorn State, Florida A&M, Prairie View, Tennessee State and Morgan State. These schools put multiple players into the NFL and eventually into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nSo black football players always had those schools as a choice \u2013 and many used that as a route to the NFL. But the lure of bigger budgets and eventually playing on television meant greater exposure and more lavish facilities, making the major colleges the athletic promised land.\n\nAnd the nation was changing\n\nDaugherty had the backing of Michigan State president John Hannah, whom President Dwight Eisenhower had appointed as the country\u2019s first chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in 1957.\n\nAnd in February 1965, Martin Luther King Jr. was given a standing ovation after speaking on the Michigan State campus.\n\nSo, in these friendly confines, from 1959 to 1972, Daugherty recruited 44 black players from the South. The 1966 team \u2013 bolstered by the 1963 recruiting class \u2013 had 20 black players.\n\nBut perhaps the key piece who came in the 1964 recruiting class was Raye, the junior quarterback on the 1966 Spartans championship team that was immortalized after a 10-10 tie on Nov. 18 with Notre Dame. The so-called Game of the Century was watched by 33 million TV viewers, the largest sports television audience at that time.\n\nRaye became the first black quarterback from the South to guide his team to a national championship.\n\nOther players on the team \u2013 barred from their state\u2019s predominantly white institutions \u2013 included Charlie Thornhill from Roanoke, Virginia; Robert Moreland from Richmond, Virginia; Ernie Pasteur from Beaufort, North Carolina; Bubba Smith and Jess Phillips from Beaumont, Texas; George Webster from Anderson, South Carolina; Jimmy Garrett from Columbia, South Carolina; Jimmy Summers from Orangeburg, South Carolina; and Eugene \u201cGene\u201d Washington from La Porte, Texas.\n\nSmith, Webster and Washington would be named All-Americans, and several of the players are in the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nLooking back, Raye told The Undefeated that he and his parents had little hesitation about leaving a town of 65,000 to attend a college of 45,000 students.\n\nBesides, it was a chance to leave segregated water fountains and restrooms and other indignities of the Jim Crow South.\n\nIn his new surroundings, Raye ordered from a menu for the first time and enjoyed his first night in a hotel.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult, and then it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Raye said of his decision to spurn N.C. A&T and North Carolina Central for Michigan State. \u201cThe difficulty is that nobody had ever done it from my area.\u201d\n\nHe said that \u201cthe naysayers\u201d cautioned that he would be a little fish in big pond or that \u201cthe competition would be too great.\u201d\n\nOther critics said: \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to play quarterback; they\u2019re going to switch you to a defensive back or running back.\u201d\n\nBut Raye was encouraged by many of his teachers at segregated E.E. Smith High School in Fayetteville, many of whom had earned master\u2019s degrees from Big Ten schools, after earning undergraduate degrees from HBCUs.\n\nPlus, an older neighbor and friend, Ron Chalmers, who had earned a degree at Johnson C. Smith in Charlotte, North Carolina, would be enrolling in graduate school around the same time Raye would arrive.\n\nAnd Raye\u2019s parents were solidly supportive of his new venture.\n\n\u201cMy mom and dad were very encouraging,\u201d Raye said. \u201cMy mom had no apprehension that I could compete academically.\n\n\u201cMy father said if you go, don\u2019t go looking back this way; go moving forward and whatever comes with that, face it head on.\n\n\u201cThat gave me enough encouragement,\u201d Raye said.\n\nBut Raye felt confident in his playing ability, having competed well against the best black players in North Carolina. His high school team was beaten in the second round of the state playoffs by eventual Elizabeth City State and Los Angeles Rams alum Johnny Walton of P.W. Moore High School of Elizabeth City.\n\nEarly days of integration\n\nIn 1890, scholar-athlete George Jewett starred at halfback at Michigan, according to several sources. That makes him the first black athlete to play college football.\n\nAnd in 1939, the UCLA Bruins sported four local black players, including Tom Bradley, who would become the first black mayor of Los Angeles and another, Jackie Robinson, who later would break Major League Baseball\u2019s color barrier. Their experiences are chronicled in a 2018 book, The Black Bruins, by James W. Johnson.\n\nWilliam \u201cBig Bill\u201d Bell has sometimes been cited \u2013 such as his 1991 obituary in the Fayetteville (North Carolina) Observer as the first black football player at Ohio State, playing from 1929-1931.\n\nBell later became head coach at historically black Claflin, Howard, Florida A&M and North Carolina A&T, then serving as athletic director at N.C. A&T and Fayetteville State.\n\nOther researchers cite Ohio-born Fred Patterson as Ohio State\u2019s first black player, 1891-1893.\n\nStill Bell, who was born in Polk County, Georgia, was among the early players from the deep South to play at a predominantly white university.\n\nBut he was not as early as Gideon Smith, who played at Michigan State (then known as Michigan Agricultural College) from 1913-1915, according to author and Michigan State alum Tom Shanahan and others.\n\nSmith, from Hampton, Virginia, first played at Ferris Industrial School (now Ferris State) in Big Rapids, Michigan, having arrived through an educational arrangement between Ferris and then Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute (now Hampton University).\n\nBut the real path to modern-day college football integration was emboldened by the 1965 and 1966 Michigan State football teams, loaded with players from North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Texas.\n\nMichigan State opened the door\n\nRaye said his first contact with Michigan State had been Spartan assistant Cal Stoll, who presented him with the MVP trophy at the East-West Shrine All-Star game and began recruiting him immediately.\n\nRaye\u2019s odyssey included his first airplane flight in a trip to Michigan State\u2019s East Lansing campus and, during the summer, a 36-hour train ride back to Michigan.\n\nHe remembers that black people could not enter the food car until the train crossed the Mason-Dixon Line above Maryland. Raye laughed when discussing how his mother had prepared him for the trip with a \u201cshoebox full of food.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had eaten that up by the time I got to Wilson, North Carolina, which was only about 80 miles,\u201d Raye said. \u201c\u2026 I was a kid; I was hungry. I had a shoebox full of fried chicken. I couldn\u2019t resist the smell. \u2026 And the bologna sandwiches.\u201d\n\nRaye said he was \u201cin bad shape\u201d by the time he got to Michigan.\n\nMuch of Raye\u2019s story and that of his teammates have been chronicled in Shanahan\u2019s 2014 book, Raye of Light: Jimmy Raye, Duffy Daugherty, the Integration of College Football and the 1965-66 Michigan State Spartans.\n\nJesse Jackson told Shanahan that seeing black athletes in the Game of the Century was important to the cause of civil rights.\n\n\u201cThe athletes redefined race in many ways,\u201d Jackson says in the book. \u201cOn the ball field, the playing field is even. When the rules are objective and public, and the referees are fair, we can win.\u201d\n\nUnlike their counterparts in the South, Raye and his teammates were not burdened by responsibilities to integrate lunch counters \u2013 as Jackson and his N.C. A&T teammates did in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1960.\n\nThe black Spartans were mainly about the business of football. Raye said that black students, mostly male, numbered 150-200, and they socialized very little with the general student body.\n\n\u201cYou stayed in your lane, and they stayed in their lane,\u201d Raye said. \u201cThe fact that you were there as an athlete, they probably knew that. Most of the blacks on campus were males, and they were athletes.\n\n\u201cThe black fraternities and the black sororities are where most [black] kids did their socializing,\u201d said Raye, who pledged the Omega Psi Phi fraternity in 1965.\n\n\u201cAs it turns out, it was during the height of civil rights movement,\u201d Raye said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t involved in the civil rights movement. Dr. King spoke on campus, and we heard him. But we didn\u2019t talk about race. We just matriculated and played football.\u201d\n\nAnd they had great success.\n\nShanahan says history has not given fair recognition to the role of Daugherty and his players. Shanahan also asserts that Michigan State should erect a statue of Bubba Smith on campus. Smith died in 2011 at the age of 66.\n\nSmith had a legendary career as a fearsome defensive lineman, mainly with the Baltimore Colts, and later became an actor famous for the Police Academy movies.\n\nRaye says in the book that Smith did more than any other college athlete to bring about social change \u2013 including dating women of his choice and joining a Jewish fraternity.\n\nIt was during the week of Smith\u2019s funeral that Maya Washington, Gene Washington\u2019s youngest daughter, was inspired to begin work on her 2018 documentary film Through the Banks of the Red Cedar.\n\nThe title of the film is a play on the Michigan State fight song.\n\n\u201cOn the banks of the red cedar there\u2019s a school that\u2019s known to all.\n\nIts specialty is winning, and those Spartans play good ball.\u201d\n\nMaya Washington learned during conversations about Smith that her dad, Gene Washington, had been referred to Michigan State by Smith\u2019s father, Willie Ray Smith Sr., a very successful coach and athletic director at segregated Charlton-Pollard High School in Beaumont, Texas.\n\nSmith would compete against Washington on the gridiron, as their teams were in an all-black league. Gene Washington could not attend the white high school in his hometown of La Porte, so he was bused 30 minutes to Baytown, where he attended segregated George Washington Carver High.\n\nGene Washington, a national-caliber hurdler, played at Michigan State on a track scholarship, because at the time he came in, the team was out of football scholarships. He excelled in both sports for the Spartans.\n\nWashington told The Undefeated that when Michigan State assistant coach Danny Boisture came to Texas to visit with Washington\u2019s mom, dad and two sisters: \u201cIt was the first time a white person had visited our home. We weren\u2019t sure why he was coming; we didn\u2019t know much about that recruitment stuff.\u201d\n\nBoisture explained that Michigan State was part of the Big Ten and played Michigan and Ohio State and that they also played Notre Dame.\n\n\u201cHe goes on and on about the state of Michigan,\u201d Washington said, \u201cbut we had no clue where the state of Michigan was.\u201d\n\nAs the coach continued his pitch, Washington said, \u201cMy dad finally asked: \u2018Say, sir, is this free?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cAnd my mom asked: \u2018How will he get up there?\u2019 \u201d\n\nA week later, Washington was flown \u2013 his first airplane trip \u2013 to East Lansing, where, he said, \u201cI\u2019d never seen so many white people in one place.\u201d\n\n(After his college days, Washington would excel with the Minnesota Vikings, where he also became a successful businessman.)\n\nWashington remembered Daugherty as a caring person who wanted his athletes to excel on and off the playing field.\n\n\u201cHe was a great guy, a very warm guy,\u201d Washington said. \u201c\u2026 He didn\u2019t like that whole segregation thing. In his mind, it wasn\u2019t fair. And there were a whole lot of young people like me and Bubba who were kind of caught in the middle of all that.\n\n\u201cAnd we were treated so badly in Texas, just because of being black,\u201d Washington continued. \u201cDuffy didn\u2019t think that was right, and so he did all he could. If there was any athlete who could play football and was a good student, he wanted them to come to Michigan State.\n\n\u201cThe No. 1 thing that he wanted to do was to make sure that we got our studies, that we went to class and got our degrees.\u201d\n\nThe pioneering Big Ten\n\nAfter the success of the iconic Michigan State teams, other programs slowly began to bring in more black athletes, and with Raye having served as a role model, Big Ten schools began suiting up black quarterbacks in numbers unseen before.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Tony Dungy played the position at Minnesota (\u201973-\u201976), Charlie Baggett at Michigan State (\u201973-\u201975), Dennis Franklin at Michigan (\u201971-\u201974) and Cornelius Green at Ohio State (\u201973-\u201976), just to name a few.\n\nMichigan native Dungy wrote in the foreword of Raye of Light that he was a Spartans fan intent on playing in East Lansing until Stoll, who had recruited Raye, became head coach at Minnesota. Stoll lured Dungy away with the prospect of creating a new legacy.\n\nThe Golden Gophers\u2019 legacy was already being written, with Bobby Bell from Shelby, North Carolina, earning two-time All-America honors with the Gophers (1961-62) and Carl Eller from Winston-Salem, North Carolina (1961-63).\n\nIt was also where Pennsylvania-born Sandy Stevens II (1959-61) became the first black quarterback to lead a major college to a national football championship.\n\nDungy would add to that legacy. He wrote that by his junior year in 1975, he was one of seven black quarterbacks in the Big Ten. One of those was Baggett, Raye\u2019s former next-door neighbor from Fayetteville, who transferred from the University of North Carolina after the school proposed to switch him to wide receiver after he had played quarterback as a freshman.\n\nDungy wrote in the forward to Raye of Light that he believes the success of modern-day black quarterbacks \u201cstems back to the Big Ten in the early \u201960s and the influence those players had on the rest of the country.\u201d\n\nRaye, who coached in the NFL for 37 years, was a longtime mentor to many who would come after him, including Dungy.\n\nIn 2014, Raye was named senior adviser to Troy Vincent, the NFL executive vice president for football operations. His son, Jimmy Raye III, is senior personnel executive for the Detroit Lions.\n\nShanahan writes that a conversation with Raye III, when they both worked for the San Diego Chargers, sparked the discussion about a book on Jimmy Raye.\n\nMeanwhile, Maya Washington works with universities and other organizations to build symposiums around the screenings of her film to spread the story about the integration of college football.\n\nShe also discussing a television deal or a streaming option.\n\nThus far, she says, the film, which predictably has been embraced by older audiences, also has been well received by young people.\n\n\u201cPretty much all of the young people who see the film are so moved and sort of awestruck because they did not know this history,\u201d Washington said. \u201cThey\u2019ve always grown up in a United States that was integrated. They\u2019ve always grown up in a time where professional athletes make million-dollar salaries.\n\n\u201cSo, they did not have the information to fully appreciate what my dad and his teammates at Michigan State or his teammates at the Minnesota Vikings or the Broncos contributed to what athletes have today.\n\n\u201cThey had no understanding,\u201d she said, \u201cthat football was a white sport prior to 1965, when my dad\u2019s team gained national prominence.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.michiganbaseballhall.org/miller", "page_content": "Born in Detroit, Bob Miller starred in baseball, football, and basketball at St. Mary\u2019s of Redford High School. After a stint in the Army from 1944-1947, Miller pursued baseball at the University of Detroit, signing with the Philadelphia Phillies for $25,000 following his sophomore year. He made his MLB debut in September 1949 before establishing himself alongside young aces Robin Roberts and Curt Simmons as a frontline starter for the Phillies\u2019 very first pennant winners, the Whiz Kids of 1950. He finished 11-6 with a 3.57 ERA and two shutouts in 174 innings, placing second in the National League Rookie of the Year voting. In all, Miller pitched 10 years in the Major Leagues, appearing in 261 games spanning 822 innings. Said Phillies manager Eddie Sawyer, \u201c[Bob Miller] got more fellows out on a 3-2 curveball than anybody I ever saw in my life.\u201d\n\nIn 1963, Miller rejoined the University of Detroit as an assistant coach. Two years later, he was named head baseball coach upon Lloyd Brazil\u2019s untimely passing in a car accident.

Ufer used to call him \"Lundo\". I used to listen every Saturday also. Many times, especially for Ohio State and \"Dr. Strangehaze\", from the \"snake pit in Columbus\", I would turn the sound on the TV off and turn the radio up. NOBODY could call a Meeechigan game like Ufer!! Remember \"General Bo George Patton Schembeckler\" and \"God bless his cotton pickin' Maize and Blue MEEECHIGAN heart?\n\nGO BLUE\n\nGod bless your Maize and Blue heart. You have truly struck a cord with me today as you know football is religion and Saturday is the holly day of obligation. With today being the Holiest of all days. The answer to your question wherever Bob Ufer may be he is in Footballs Valhalla.\n\nBob Ufer is one of my most outstanding memories of my youth. I grew up in Michigan and was a student at UM from '77-'81, where I listened to his broadcasts religiously. I even took a radio to home games and listened to Ufer call the game while I watched them live. He was also an experience I shared with my father. My father attended Michigan as a grad student from '52-'58, so Bob Ufer was a bridge between the two generations. I talked to my own son (now 12) today about football, and explained how he had really missed something great that I wished he could have been in on, so I played my old \"Ufer of Michigan\" records (which I had bought when they were first released some 20 years ago), explaining, \"Now, THAT was a real football announcer. I wish every school had someone like him to call their games.\" My son couldn't believe that someone so blatantly biased (but thoroughly enthusiastic) didn't get fired! - but nonetheless, he was transfixed by the albums, listening to play calls by Bob involving players and schools he'd never heard of, getting caught up in the Uferisms and general passion of the man. Even my 14-year-old daughter, who generally disdains football, sat and listened. I am one of the luckiest people around to have been a part of this man and his life, and that I could attend the University of Michigan that he loved and served so dearly. Thank you, Bob. The world is most definitely a better place for your having been here.\n\nBy the way, my own recollection of the play that set up Anthony Carter's amazing TD catch vs. Indiana in '79 is a bit different from the others above. I was at the game as a student, and was very proud that a former high school colleague of mine, Norm Betts, was playing (he was 2 years behind me, so we weren't real close, but I remembered him quite clearly!). I was even prouder of him on that next-to-last play. John Wangler threw a short pass to him as the only open receiver. Norm was stopped near the line of scrimmage, about 10 yards from the sideline (so he couldn't get out of bounds), and with no time-outs remaining - but he had the presence of mind to fire that ball out of bounds (laterally, so it wasn't an illegal forward pass) to stop the clock and set up AC's great catch and run. It was one of the cleverest moves I have ever seen, one I'm surprised hasn't been emulated by others since. I was further gratified to see that Norm was one of the first Ufer Foundation scholarship winners in 1983, to attend the UM Dental School. Way to go, Norm!\n\nGo Blue!!\n\nTom Moyer, Chattanooga, TN\n\nHello,\n\nI am very proud to say that I am a releative of Bob Ufer and your page is fantastic. I happened to just stumble by it and it is wonderful to see how many people young and old still Keep the memories alive of my Great Uncle Bob. he was more than just an anouncer he was a very special man to alot of people. Thank you for all the work you have put in this page and keep it up, I then will be able to share this with my daughter as she becomes a meeechigan fan!\n\nSean Smith\n\nAlthough I eventually graduated from Michigan State, there will always be room in my heart for the Michigan football team. Why? Because of Bob Ufer.\n\nThe first Michigan game I saw was on TV. Michigan at Ohio State, 1976. I was 10. Two things got me hooked on Michigan football: first, the helmets. They really made the players look action-heroish, and especially to a ten-year old, that was cool. Second, the TV sound was turned down, and out of the radio came a voice unlike any I had heard. \"Who's that kid?\" I asked my parents. \"That's Bob Ufer, and he's no kid,\" they replied. \"He's a 55-year old man!\" \"He sure sounds like a kid,\" I said, grinning from ear to ear. Even at my young age, I knew what a typical sportscaster sounded like: businesslike, impartial, and reading little or no significance into victory or defeat. Bob Ufer was different. His attitude was : \"Michigan must win!! Michigan has got to win, or the world will end in 60 seconds!\" So I donned the battle gear and jumped into the trenches with him. I had found my first set of heroes outside my family (rock and roll bands would come later): Bob Ufer, Bo Schembechler and the Michigan football team. I lived by them, I defended them to the death, they were me and I was them. Oh, by the way, the fact that Michigan crushed Ohio State 22-0 for their first Rose Bowl trip in 5 years (I found that out from Bob) helped too. Winning always helps. Then, as now, the Detroit area pretty much had teams that ranged from maddening mediocre to awful. Remember, in 1976, Detroit had Mark Fidrych and THAT WAS IT! Just a winning team alone would have been a nice gift. Throw in the cool helmets and Bob Ufer, and I was in love. No, love is not too strong a word here.\n\nI cried every time Michigan went to the Rose Bowl and came up just short.\n\nI cried because Bob Ufer cried. We all did. Bob swept us all up in his emotional tide. When they finally beat Washington in 1981 we rejoiced because Bob rejoiced. Sadly, he never lived to see the 1997 National Championship season (What would he have called Charles Woodson? \"The Two-Way Wonder\", perhaps?) Still, after Michigan beat Washington State in the 1998 Rose Bowl to win that title, I thought I could hear the ol Bo George Patton Schembechler scoring horn honking from somewhere over the San Gabriel Mountains.\n\nJ. Michaels, Massachusetts\n\nI found your webpage on the internet because I am on a quest to find out...what is the meaning behind the design on the Michigan helmet? I don't mean to sound stupid, but I'm only a high school senior...and I'm a girl...so really it's not that bad of a question. Right?? Thanks so much! Holly\n\nHello Holly,\n\nI hope you are going to college because you aren't stupid. You are smart because you weren't afraid to ask the question.\n\nMost times I don't know the answer to questions but this time I do.\n\nIn the old days, helmets were made out of leather and imagine you as a quarterback looking downfield to pass the ball and all you see are the same color leather helmets. The design was actually placed on the helmet to help the quarterback figure out where his men were vs. the other team's men. It stuck ever since and as you can guess, all the teams adopted this concept. That is why you see many multi-colored helmets on many teams.\n\nGreat site. I was telling my roommate(who is from Iowa) about how great Bob Ufer was, and trying to find some of his audio clips when I stumbled across your site. One Ufer moment that I have not seen mentioned is the infamous tearing-down of the banner in an OSU game. I listened to that clip tonight, and it gave me goosepimples(as Bob would say). I wish I could have been there for that! To see such a despicable act, and then to witness the resurrecting of the M Club Banner...UNBELIEVABLE! You can just hear the intensity of the crowd!\n\nI was born on New Year's Day in 1981, the year Michigan beat Washington in the Rose Bowl. So, I guess I was destined to be a Wolverine nut. I've been to a lot of games, but every time the band takes the field, it feels like the first time I watched a game there. Then, when the Maize & Blue storm the field, touch the M Club banner, and the crowd goes crazy, you can't help but think anyone who doesn't love Meechigan Football is crazy! After an indoor track meet at Michigan(I run for Hillsdale College), a friend and I snuck into the stadium and snuck all the way back to the player's entrance inside the tunnel. We both when running out of there imagining all the great players who have ran out of the tunnel before us. Words can not describe the feelings I felt that day! Thanks for such a great site. Andy I was fortunate today to find your Internet site.. I think of Bob Ufer's game calling quite often as I did today!. I look to the U of. Michigan site every now and then in hopes someone will honor him with a place there.. Thanks for honoring a GREAT announcer of college football.. I am an Ohio State fan but when your School Up north played the Buckeyes I listened to Bob Ufer!. He made the game LIVE for his listeners and so VERY entertaining!. The horn rings in my mind!. I find that I judge every college football game announcer by his standards!. As you know the card board announcers of today. could not carry BOB Ufer's HORN! I thoroughly enjoyed your entire web page . . . well conceived and just as well executed (as Ufer would say). I believe the horn Ufer used to sound was the horn off one of Gen. George Patton's jeeps. Somebody had given it to him. It was three honks for a TD, two honks for a FG and one honk for a PAT. I remember when Ufer got flustered because Michigan had just scored on a safety and he didn't know how many honks to give it. The day I became a UM fan was in 1969. I did not plan on watching the game on TV so my dad gave me his \"Aircastle\" transistor radio and insisted that whatever I do, I listen to the game. Looking back now, I don't know if I was more stunned at the Meechigan drubbing of the invincible OSU Buckeye's or that my dad had let me use his radio. Anyway, ever since that day I have been a huge UM fan. I was at the UM-Indiana game and was sitting in the \"flagpole\" end zone that AC scored in. It was the greatest moment I ever saw in person in sports. One thing I'll never foret is when AC scored the TD the stadium went into a stunned silence for what seemed to be an eternity but actually just a couple of seconds. On the prior play to the catch Russell Davis was called on for some reason to run the ball up the middle, when he was going down in the middle of the field, he underhanded the ball to the Indiana sideline killing the clock allowing the final play. If you ever watch ESPN with Lee Corso, you can't help but notice his dislike for UM . . . I still wonder if it is because the ball Russell Davis launched out of bounds ended up in the stomach of Indiana's head coach -- Lee Corso. One last memory was when it was UM vs. Dr. Strangehayes and OSU. It was very cold that November day so my dad and myself left my 1974 Gremlin running to keep us warm. We would stand outside a take in the atmosphere then sit in the car for a few minutes when we got cold. As the OSU band passed by my car (we were parked on the golf course) it was so loud, we fell in behind the band to offer moral support and followed them into the stadium. After the game I couldn't find my keys . . . they were still in that Gremlin and the engine was still running. It was a good thing that car was easy on gas. Thanks for the website, ALL OF THEM! . . . keep it up! GO BLUE R. Henry\n\nHey Fellow Maize and Blue Fans!! I'm deaf so I never really had a chance to listen to Bob Ufer's voice however I can image how it feels because I'm from Chicago and listen to simple phrases like Harry Caray's \"Holy Cow!! Cubs win!! Cubs Win!!\" I can understand the feelings of it...the picture, the drama and the announcer's voice that make it very magical. I'm sure my dad will tell me stories of Bob Ufer because my dad is from Detroit and my mom is from Dearborn before moving to Chicago area where I was born. STILL I'M A HUGE MICHIGAN FAN IN HEART!! I bleed Maize and Blue!\n\nI have few great memories and a bad ones such as the Hail Mary Throw by Colorado but the next two games against Colorado was sweet especially the possible Hail Mary II but thank god that Charles Woodson and Marcus Ray was there to stop it in Boulder, Colorado! :) My heart was pounding and knowing the odds of repeating a possible Hail Mary was slim, but it has been two years and I still can taste it the agony of defeat especially knowing Westbrook is orginally from Ann Arbor and decided to go to Colorado!\n\nI can't really think of the best game I ever seen, but I know Michigan's biggest rivalary is Ohio State, but I seem to enjoy more when Michigan plays against the Fightin Irish cuz of where I came from, the Chicago area where Notre Dame fans usually dominates. All of my friends are Notre Dame fans and I'm the only one, for that long period of time where Notre Dame was stealing the spotlight, beating Michigan on a yearly basis where it became very frustrating because my friends kept heckling me why Notre Dame is king of football. The year of 1991 was the super best of all!! Elvis Grbac, Desmond Howard, Ricky Powers and the defense beat Notre Dame at Michigan Stadium was the best game I ever seen! Watching Desmond Howard dancing all over the field, confusing Notre Dame with his super catches and the reverse play that led to a touchdown. The best of all was the 4th down and inches, all Michigan needed to make a power middle drive to get a first down and go for the touchdown in 4 chances, NOPE, instead, Grbac threw an arching throw to Desmond Howard, the pass seem out of bounds or out of reach, but watching Howard rushing past his ND defender and making a diving catch and it was a TOUCHDOWN!! I just jumped all over the place, making remarks to my friends and I knew Howard will have a big year. Turns out he was the best player in the land of College football with the Hiesman Trophy and two Sports Illustrated covers!\n\nEven though I HATE GREEN BAY PACKERS!! I told my dad, if Desmond Howard ever help Green Bay Packers to win the Super Bowl, then I'll root for the Packers just for Howard and good enough, he became part of the Super Bowl Legend with that famous 99 yards kick off return! Now he's playing for my favorite team, the Detroit Lions and now he's a Pro Bowler!! Gosh how much I love him!! Same goes for Charles Woodson and the biggest blue plate special is Michigan winning it all in 1997 to become a National Champions since 1948. It make me proud to be a Michigan fan even though I attend Arizona State University. Don't remind of 1987 Rose Bowl and I do not want to hear it! :)\n\nMichigan at heart!! GO BLUE!!\n\nI remember (at least, basically) the legendary Snow Bowl of 1950. I wish you or someone would put up some highlights of that great game on the Web. I personally call Vic Janowicz's 27-yard field goal the greatest scoring play in college history. How many games can you name in which a team won, though, without ever scoring a first down, and gaining only 27 yards in total offense. That may have been the most classic game in all history.\n\nI was just now fortunate enough to \"stumble\" across your page of \"Michigan Football and Bob Ufer Memories\", including the Real Audio sound clips, and I LOVE IT!!! After reading all of the other memories sent in, I had to add mine:\n\nI grew up in a household that was all Notre Dame. Not only my family, but also most of my relatives, including my grandparents(whose apple farm was right in my backyard) -they all brought me up on the Notre Dame traditions. I was a sport nut from my early years-as far back as I remember the first section I always grabbed from the newspapers was the sports pages. Although raised to be an Irish fan, there was something about MICHIGAN that got me interested. I remember watching as far back as the mid 60's, when Bob Timberlake led the Wolverines to a Rose Bowl victory. Then come memories of Ron Johnson's record-setting day a couple years later. But for the most part back then, college football to me was listening to Notre Dame football on the transistor radio as I picked apples on Saturdays in my grandparent's orchard.\n\nI don't recall the exact year that I was transformed to becoming a Meechigan fan, so it must have been a gradual thing, but I found myself tuning in more and more to Bob Ufer' s Michigan broadcasts and less and less into the N.D. games. I got hooked on Michigan Football just listening to Bob's descriptions of the action on the football field, and to the stories he told about the great Michigan teams of the past. There just never seemed to be a dull moment when it came to Ufe and the Maize and Blue. I always made sure, when I headed out to the orchards on Saturday mornings, that I always had my own radio and a spare battery: I knew I just couldn't miss a minute of Bob Ufer-and I knew that everyone else would be listening to N.D., so I had to be prepared so as not to miss a minute of the MEEECHIGAN broadcast.\n\nI have now been a Michigan season-ticket holder since 1977-and I still bring my radio to the games-but the trip to Ann Arbor is never complete without my Ufer tapes for the drive and/or tailgate party. For that matter, even on road game saturdays in the fall, I still listen to Ufer as part of my pre-game ritual. As Bob himself put it best, describing Michigan Football: \"Football is a religion and Saturday is the Holy Day of Obligation!\" To Bob, up there in \"Football's Walhalla\" --THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH for converting me to Michigan Football- and THANK YOU, too, for the Ufer of Meeechigan Memories!!\n\nThanks for your Ufer Page. I have the CD and play it often. This year I tried to write a poem to the team for each game, starting with the Rose Bowl. Some people thought they reminded them of the Ufer poems he often read. Here's my latest.

Is there any chance you could add a audio clip of Anthony Carter's miracle touchdown against Indiana in 1979? Bob Ufer called some great games in his day, but that one is among the most memorable. My God bless his Maize & Blue Michigan heart.\n\nDan Vincent\n\nI wish to thank you for this web site to put back in my heart the sound of the one and only Bob Ufer. I remember being in my seat for over 24 years and having my radio in my pocket and the earplug in my ear listening to the broadcast from Bob Ufer on WJR. I can still recall hearing him say : Welcome to the house that Yost dug, Crisler paid for, Canham carpeted and Schembecler fills every Saturday afternoon ! There was only one man given to us by the Grace and Hands of GOD, that was given the talent and voice to bring millions of people a lot of joy and happiness with his voice at the University of Michigan. I listened every Saturday both in the \"Big House\", as it is now called and on my radio at home for the road games to hear the voice of Bob Ufer. Mr. Ufer brought more joy into my mind and body with his stories and play by play just by being Bob Ufer. Every game Mr. Ufer could tell you of plays that happened 10 to 40 years ago, that were just like the play that just took place. He was a TRUE BLUE man and a tremendous representative of the greatest college in the world, the UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.\n\nWE MISS YOU BOB.\n\nDan Field\n\nJackson, Mi.\n\nI'm a lifelong Michigan resident now living in Cleveland. As luck would have it, WJR comes in as clearly in Cleveland as it did in my hometown as a youth in Manitou Beach, MI. This morning, I listened to WJR and heard a few of Ufer's clips from 1975, 1973, 1969. They brought tears to my eyes. I had not heard his voice since the year he died.\n\nWhen I was a sophomore at Central Michigan, I remember exactly where I was standing in our kitchen, listening to the old AM radio, when Carter made the famous catch against IU.\n\nOn this most special of weeks (we travel to Columbus three days hence as this is being written), I discovered your tribute to Bob Ufer. Congratulations on a job well done.\n\nHe was truly unique. And oh so special in the memories he helped create for so many.\n\nI had the good fortune of meeting Bob. As a junior in 1969 (Bo's first season), I was an intern in the Sports Information Department and met him.\n\nWe might have talked several times. Some seven years later, it was the week of the Ohio State game. I hadn't seen Bob since that '69 season. My brother and his wife (both M grads) had scheduled their wedding for the next Saturday, right during the game. I phoned Bob at his home on Monday before the game/wedding. Introduced myself and he said he remembered me although I had a sneaky feeling that he was just being nice. I asked him if he would be willing to do a favor for me. Asked him if he'd phone my brother and his fiancee on Friday night during the rehearsal dinner and congratulate them and wish them well. He got very excited and said he would love to. There was a smoker scheduled for that Friday night in Columbus and he said he would just phone them from there.\n\nHe did just that, surprising the heck out of the couple and creating a wonderful memory for them. Some 22 years later they still mention their phone call from Bob Ufer on the night before their wedding. Ufe wished them well and emphasized the importance of family. Not bad on the eve of Michigan and Ohio State. But that's Bob Ufer. Oh, and we stomped the Bucks 22-0 that next day and the marriage is beautiful and will last forever.\n\nThe letters on your site brought back so many memories. I got a few tears reading some of them. Michigan football and Bob Ufer will do that to you.\n\nThanks again. GO BLUE. D. Thoits\n\n\n\nI remember listening to Bob Ufer broadcast Michigan games when I was in northwestern PA - WJR carried across Lakes Huron & Erie. Although I had been exposed to the wonderful Meechigan football tradition through relatives, listening to Mr. Ufer's invigorating take on those games charged my interest and drove me to become a #1 Meechigan fan (if only I had indeed transferred to Ann Arbor). Mr. Ufer was definitely the most passionate broadcaster I've heard, without exception across all sports. He was a vibrant catalyst that made the tradition what it became and will forever be a tangible, indelible cornerstone of that tradition. I certainly miss his enthusiasm and will always remember his dedication and distinct passion despite having listened to his live broadcasts during the last 2 years before he passed from us. He was certainly unique, never rote nor premeditated, but original and dynamic...and someone who is missed. God bless him.\n\nI just got done reading your site and listening to the great Ufer clips from the 1979 18-15 loss to OSU. I come from an entire family of Michigan grads and was fortunate enough graduate from Michigan in 1988. In the second grade I attended my first Michigan game, a 49-0 whipping of Tony Dungy and The Minnesota Golden Gophers. I remember going to the Pretzel Bell with my parents who had graduated from Michigan in the early 60s (They tore it down right before my Freshman year in 1985). On the way back to Grand Rapids, my parents taught me the Victors. In 1975 I began collecting Michigan t-shirts and understanding what was happening at the games. That was also the year I began listening to that nut on the radio.\n\nIn 1976 Michigan opened the year preseason #1. I listened to the opener at Wisconsin and became hooked. I have not missed a more than 4 or 5 games -either listening on the radio, watching on TV, or being in the Big House since that time. Ufer was a big part of it. Only about two Michigan games per year were on TV in the 70s. I listened to every one. Like many of your respondents, my parents bought me both Ufer albums. I also got a tape of Ufer calling old Michigan classics like the 1902 Rose Bowl, the 1943 Notre Dame game, the 1948 Rose Bowl, the 1950 Snow Bowl, The 1969, 1971 & 1973 Ohio State games. By the end of 1976 I had read (at least four times) and memorized The Wolverines, a book published in 1973 concerning the entire history of Michigan football to that date. Then I read and memorized Joe Fall's A Man in Motion a biography of Bo Schembechler. Yes, Ufer turned me into a complete geek. None of my friends could understand my passion for Michigan football. Ufer and I were on the same wave length. My friends and I played football on Saturday afternoons in the fall but we stopped at 12:30 to listen to the pregame, the game and the post game with Ufer. Every single week, bar none!!! Soon my friends lost interest and couldn't understand why we had to sit on my couch and listen to this lunatic on the radio for 3 hours every saturday. I am glad you all understand.\n\nI think the memory that stands out most about my Ufer listening days (other than the obvious 1979 Anthony Carter TD against Indiana - I had actually did the unheard of back then for me. I gave up in disappointment with a few minutes to go and left the house to rake leaves. Fortunately I took my portable radio outside with me. I was sort of pouting about the impending tie to Indiana when all of a sudden...) is a loss to Purdue in 1976. I have acted up mightily, even in recent years, over losses. But I don't think any loss in the history of Michigan football hurt me more than the 1976 loss to Purdue. We were riding high with an 8-0 record and 8 straight weeks as the nations #1 team. This was my first really full season listening to every game and truly understanding what was going on. I had the opportunity to see the MSU game that year and witnessed Rob Lytle run for 181 yards on just 10 carries. I was hooked. Michigan led the nation in total offense, rushing offense, total defense, scoring defense - basically everything. On that fateful day against Purdue I had a little league football game and did not get home in time to hear the first half of the game. My family was gone so I was home alone. I couldn't believe my ears when I heard Michigan was locked in a tight game with a completely average team. I remember Ufer describing Purdues' Scott Deirking chewing up yardage and blasting into the end zone in the fourth quarter to give Purdue a 16-14 lead. We came right back and this is where I died. I was sitting there biting my nail and dreading a loss when Ufer described as follows: \"Walt Downing comes up over the ball. The line follows and its balanced. Its Hucklebee deep and Lytle close. Ricky Leach under center. Jimmy Smith comes out wide to the right. Ricky Leach fakes it to Hucklebee and drops back to pass. He's going long for Jimmy Smith!!! He's wide open!!! and he drops it!!! Oh my God Jimmy Smith dropped it!!! He was wide open in the end zone and he dropped it!!!. Well Donno that's the breaks of football.\" Well, it wasn't good enough for me. As a fourth grader who was not used to that kind of disappointment I broke. I ran out of the house saying words I probably shouldn't have said. That was the beginning of the end that day for me. We eventually moved into position to win the game in the final seconds with a 38 yard Bob Wood field goal but we missed it. Ufer called the game like a gentleman. \" A well deserved victory for the Michigan Wolverines\". But I was screaming shut up!!! I do not think this was one of my finer moments.\n\nA better moment came in the 7th grade when I had to do a career counseling day. I had long decided I wanted to be a Michigan sportscaster like my idol. My dad fanagled me into the press box for the 1979 Michigan v. Wisconsin game. It was the week after the Carter TD against Indiana. My dad hurried me through the crowd and into the press box elevator. I really had to go to the bathroom but I was told to hold it. I mean I really really had to go. So I get up into the press box and Ufer is going at it real hard. The game had just ended in a 56-0 Michigan romp. Off the air I was right there when Ufer was talking football. I remember him saying \"Damn that Wolfolk's good\" (Remember don't call my Harold my name is Butch) Then he goes back on the air and he is in full gear - \"Michigan is about to enter the biggest two game stretch in the history of Meechigan football!!! Next week its Mark Herman and the 9-1 Purdue Boilermakers and their air show!!! Then, we play Dr. Strange Hayes and the #1 ranked....!!!\" That was it. I couldn't hold it anymore. I was so excited I just had to let it go. I may be the oldest kid ever to wet his pants but there was nothing better. It was a dream day. The next week I taped the entire Michigan v. Purdue radio broadcast. I still have the 4 cassette tapes it took to get the whole thing, pregame and all, on tape.\n\nThanks for letting me share my Ufer stories. My wife is sick of them.\n\nHaving lived in the Detroit area most of my life and been weened on Michigan football, my fondest memory of Bob Ufer, was when Bo asked him to speak at the Pep Rally prior to an OSU game.\n\nI now reside in Florida and cannot help but shake my head when these people talk about \"Big Games\" and sportsmanship. I cannot remember MI or OSU ever running up a score on the other.\n\nBig Games and Sportsmanship are of an era long gone. Sadly So!\n\nAlthough everyone remembers AC's catch at the Indiana game, you must remember how livid Lee Corso was when he caught the ball \"fumbled\" out of bounds by one of the running backs - I believe Lawrence Ricks -- to stop the clock and thus set up AC's scoring catch. Watch ESPN. Corso still holds a grudge! I've had the opportunity to be present at the home games for 1975 and 76 seasons and then since 1979 to the present. For any of you who have experienced Michigan Stadium on game day, in person or via Bob Ufer, it is an experience which never grows old and stills sends chills up my spine. Now with the addition of 5500 additional seats, we should once again be the largest crowd watching a football game in America on those special Saturdays. And Fritz Crisler's seat will still be there!\n\nGene Hullinghorst\n\nAnn Arbor,MI\n\n[Comment by the Webmaster: We just returned from the 1998 Michigan Homecoming game against Indiana and guess who was honored during the game?\n\nJohnny \"Wingin'\" Wangler and Anthony Carter...and they were both there at the game! They showed the replay of the last \"famous\" 6 seconds against Indiana on that fateful day!]\n\nI was just searching through Michigan web pages for information for the educational service agency that I am webmaster for when I ran across your website dedicated to Bob Ufer.\n\nI have some memories of my own.....My Aunt Phil married Bob Ufer after my Uncle Doc passed away in his thirties. They had all been friends, and I believe Uncle Bob and Aunt Phil's courting first began in my parents living room playing bridge.\n\nAs a child I had a hard time understanding why my parents would have me do certain things when we were visiting the Ufers at their cottage. You see, both of my parents graduated from Michigan State. Now I know why they had me sneak down to Uncle Bob's boat and tie a Michigan State sweatshirt on his antenna! I also remember hearing the story about how my parents got a key to his apartment and during a Michigan/Michigan State game snuck in and decorated everything in green and white. This happened to be one of those rare years when Michigan lost to State, and I heard that when Bob came back to his apartment with other media people he had invited that.....well, that he didn't find it very humorous!\n\nAlthough we didn't see Bob and Phil Ufer that often while I was growing up, there is one memory that will always be so special to me. I come from a very small family; no siblings for either of my parents. So when my father died when I was seventeen, it was my grandmother and my Uncle Bob and Aunt Phil who were there for us in Chelsea where my father is buried. Even though it had been some time since we had seen the Ufers, Bob took over everything that day, and was our rock throughout that day. I remember sitting on the couch with him and he distracting me with stories about Michigan (what else!), and showing me the Rose Bowl ring that he had been given. I'm sure it was one of his most precious possessions. There are those who remember Bob Ufer as Michigan's great football announcer. I will always remember the man who took care of us when we were in shock at my father's sudden passing, and the great kindness and gentleness he showed us during that time. For me, that is the best memory of Bob Ufer, and one I'll never forget. Anne Goodrich\n\nI love Bob Ufer I am not old enough to have heard him live so i have all of the tapes and cds now. He was an interesting and great man. I love it when my dad tells me all of the great stories about him.\n\nI just finished reading all the fine letters from devoted Ufer lovers like myself. Born in 1966, my father had me in the pressbox (so he tells me) in 1969 for the upset that \"Ripley couldn't have made any better\" .... the Michigan 24-12 win over Ohio State. My earliest memory of Michigan football was watching the 10-10 tie on television in 1973. I am a lifer ... I love the University and the tradition, but most of all I loved Bob Ufer. My present career of a sports broadcaster is likely because of countless hours of listening to \"Uferlosophies.\" As a young Michigander I memorized the two audio tapes of Ufer. I still can reel them off as easily today as I could when I was twelve (I'm not sure if that is pitiful or more of a tribute). My family moved to Florida in 1979, so I found out of Mr. Ufer's death via long distance. It was as if I had lost a grandparent. He will never know this, but he was the single biggest influence in my professional life. I only wish I could tell him that today.\n\nJ. Lighthall\n\nTampa, Florida\n\nUFER1@aol.com\n\n\n\nI'm not honestly sure which was more touching.... you're page itself with the great audio clips, or reading everyone else's comments and favorite Ufer stories... I thought I'd take a few moments to share mine.\n\nUnlike many of the people who have written in before, Bob Ufer *wasn't* the reason I learned to love Michigan football. No, instead, it was my Grandfather. My Grandfather had taken some correspondence classes through U of M in the 30's, but had never been a full-time student, nor did he graduate from there. But he was always a Michigan Man at heart.\n\nI was born in 1976, and it didn't take long for me to pick up on Grampa's love of Michigan football. I don't know if I explicitly remember the 79 Indiana game or not, but I do know that Anthony Carter will always be \"#1\" in my heart when it comes to Michigan football players. But even though I was so young, I fondly and distinctly remember other names from the era, such as John Wangler, Ali-haji Shiek, Butch Woolfolk, Bo, and of course, Mr. Meeeechigan himself, Bob Ufer.\n\nI think I was 5 when my grandfather passed away... due to cancer. I remember at the funeral, telling my mom how upset I was that grandpa wasn't being buried in a Maize and Blue casket. It was not long after that when Bob Ufer also lost his battle with cancer. I remember hearing the announcement on the radio, and crying just as much as I had at grampa's funeral. Then, through the tears, I smiled. My mom looked down, and asked why I was smiling.\n\nI replied, \"Because... Now Grampa has someone to sing The Victors with in Heaven.\"\n\nEvery time I think of this story, it brings tears to my eyes. (Writing it now is no exception.) I am now a 4th year student at U of M, and God willing, next year I will become the first person from my family to graduate from Michigan. This fall was an emotional climax, following Michigan's undefeated season, trekking to California for the Rose Bowl, and ultimately, seeing them become National Champions.\n\nBob Ufer and my Grandfather have become almost synonymous in my heart when it comes to Michigan football because I know, that every fall Saturday, they're up there, singing The Victors together.\n\nGO BLUE! Tristan Pruss\n\n\n\nHail! To the Victors, Valiant!\n\nHail! To the Conquering Heroes!\n\nHail! Hail! To MICHIGAN\n\nThe Leaders and Best!\n\nHail! To the Victors, Valiant!\n\nHail! To the Conquering Heroes!\n\nHail! Hail! To MICHIGAN\n\nThe Champions of the West!\n\nSince I had a Michigan connection through my son-in-law, I have pulled for 'em. When I started high school, all my buddies went out for the football team. (1951-God I'm old) So I did too, never having even seen a football game in person. Big school, rough road ahead. Didn't make varsity until junior year. Senior year, utility player, 145 pounds, started at defensive back, line backer, and even defensive end, as well as all kicking teams. The guys I played with and against were on the LSU national championship team in 1959. I knocked Billy Canon on his can...once. We played Baton Rouge and Jimmy Taylor, later of the Green Bay Packers...beat them 20-zip when they were unbeaten and he was the top ground gainer in the state...held him to 20 yards. Met one of the Baton Rouge team members later in college. He said we took them out in the sugar cane fields, with mud and only lanterns for lighting to beat them. Not far from the truth.\n\nAnyway, I really understand and appreciate the meaning of being a sports fan. Even here in the deep south I was aware of Ufer...bless his maize and blue heart. Charlie\n\n[From time to time, I have received a very special Email which makes me so proud to be associated with the great Bob Ufer. What follows is one very special Email...]\n\nEvery Michigan fan man or woman, boy or girl knows who Bob Ufer is and how he loved his MEE-CHIGAN!! Even though Bob is not with us physically Bob was with the UM team this fall and every fall ever since he unfortunately went up to football's vallhalla to join Benny, Fritz, and other UM greats. I am only 16, but my father has both tapes and I listen to them daily and nightly. I fall asleep recalling former UM teams of the past and wishing that I could have this great man. I live in Indiana and every time I hear Ufer recall the 1979 homecoming game, I get chills. In fact I listened to his tapes every Friday night before the football game this autumn and I think that and the great talent Mich had helped. I can just see ol' Bob calling plays of Tyrone Wheatley, Jamie Morris, Jim Harabaugh, Todd Collins, Brian Griese, and yes Charles Woodson. Can't we all imagine how Ufer would react to some of Woodson's plays this year like against all the State's:Michigan, Penn, and Ohio. America and the world truly misses Bob Ufer and I sure do. We miss ya Bob, and God bless your cotton pickin' maize-n-blue heart.\n\nA. P.\n\nMiddletown, Indiana USA\n\nI have been a Michigan resident since 1988, having moved from New Jersey where I spent my first 36 years. I became a U of M fan almost immediately, and I am hopeful that both of my daughters will be attending the university within the next couple of years. I have heard snippets from time to time of Bob Ufer, and being a radio buff and fan of great announcers, was in awe of this very powerful voice pulling me into the games and the emotions of that time. He must have been absolutely great, and I wish I had been around at the time when he was in his heyday. Your web page is great! I played all of the sound bites, and I hope more are added. Thanks for some great listening pleasure! Peter Kovacs\n\nThanks for providing some Bob Ufer highlights. I cried like a baby when that wonderful man passed away. He was saluted at one of his last games (after having been absent for some time) but I can't remember the specifics.\n\nMaybe it was the 1981 Iowa game. I think the band spelled his name on the field at halftime and prompted him to make a short speech. If you remember it, please indulge me with your recollection (when housebound on a blizzardy afternoon!).\n\n[Webmaster's Comment: What I remember is this: The banner that the M Club holds up and the players run under before the start of the game was changed to read \"Bob Ufer We Support You\". Every player, coach, cheerleader and Pom Pom girl jumped up and touched the banner. It really brought tears to my eyes...]\n\nFellow Meeechigan Football Fan!\n\nI just stumbled upon your website and saw your tribute to Bob Ufer, the Voice of Meeechigan Football. I thought I needed to add my 2 cents worth. First of all, the spotter that Bob used during his games was a man named Don Lund. Mr. Lund is still associated with broadcasts of U of M football.\n\nOne thing you may not know is that Ol' Ufe showed up for an interview with Joe Falls of the Detroit News on one occasion, near the end of his career. He wasn't feeling well, and when he sat down with Mr. Falls he wasn't saying anything. Suddenly, Bob broke into a huge grin, and printed on his teeth were the words \"Go Blue!\" His license plate read simply \"VOICEM,\" and everybody knew who was in that car. In his house, he had an M shaped couch.\n\nFinally, you might like to know that there is a new 2 CD set out, called Bob Ufer, 50 Years of Michigan Football. It is available through the website www.uferfoundation.org. All proceeds from the sale of this CD set go to the Bob Ufer Scholarship Foundation. It really is a collection worth having. And tell all your fellow Ufer fans about it. It's for a good cause! Bob would be, and is, proud, I'm sure.\n\nThanks for your fantastic tribute to Robert Frost Ufer. His enthusiasm and love for old Meeechigan live on every time I play his tapes.\n\nGo Blue!\n\nJohn Selewski\n\n105233.152@compuserve.com\n\nI wasn't sure if you knew this or not, so that's why I'm send this to you.\n\nThe scoring horn came from Gen. George Pattons' jeep. It was sent to Ufer by Pattons' nephew because he heard Ufer refer to Bo as Patton.\n\nThe horn was blown 3 times for touchdowns, twice for field goals and once for the extra point.\n\nI also loved how Ufer would refer to Woody Hayes as \"Dr Strange Hayes and his scarlet and gray test tube players\" and Earl Bruce as \"Darth Vader Bruce and his scarlet and gray storm troopers\".\n\n-- Phil Duva\n\nWhat a delightful discovery : your website. You have recreated some of the most memorable moments of being a 78-year old Meechigan fan. It all started in l938-prewar years. It became a way of life as we spent our first married years in Ann Arbor, l94l. We lived through the war years ( I had to go to Northwestern and Dcyche Stadium to watch the Wolverines beat Northwestern, because my husband was overseas, and I was living with my son in Chicago at my parents home). Then post war, moving back to MIchigan, going to games for forty years, and finally reaching the point where we are content to watch from our recliners. BUT THE SPIRIT IS STILL THERE. THE CHEERS ARE JUST AS LOUD. I wear the colors, I play the Victors, and I salute the Maize and Blue as lustily as ever. And I have a strong feeling that this team will do it. They will beat O. S. U.\n\nThanks again for a most delightful evening with you and your website.\n\nNancy Vander Heide\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines was just a football team based out of The state of Michigan until I accidentally heard a Wolverine broadcast on the radio. Being a confessed \"homer\" for the Detroit Tigers, Lions and Red Wings, it wasn't unusual for me to attach to a team that I supported. After Bob Ufer expressed so much love, excitement and support to the Michigan Wolverines, like some religious conversion or addictive drug, I instantly became \"hooked\" on the Maize and Blue. Even to this day when I hear excerpts of his play by play, I get hair raising goose bumps. I can feel the excitement that \"Ufer\" felt as though I was at the games during those moments. Except for the University of Michigan, the staff, students, the tradition and history, I can think of nothing or no one that represents the U of M and all its glory as much as Bob Ufer. Every sports fan of the Wolverines have been blessed to have experienced the voice and dedication of Bob Ufer and his love for the University of Michigan football team. HAIL TO THE VICTORS AND GO BLUE GO!\n\nEnnis Woods\n\nThanks for the web-site! I'm another great big Meeechigan fan that also did not make it to that wonderful school. Its Bob Ufer's fault for making me a Meeechigan football fan though. I can remember being very young (maybe 7 or 8) and was running an errand with my dad when I first heard his voice broadcasting a UM football game on the car radio. When we got home, I ran up to my room and tuned in the rest of the game. I haven't missed one since!!!! About 31 years worth!\n\nI have both records (yes RECORDS!) with his broadcasts from 1969 through the Rose Bowl season of 1980! They are absolutely fabulous. I know them just about by heart. Once in a bar I was imitating Bob and rattled off his famous summery of the 69 upset of Ohio State. The place was rolling! My encore was calling a Gordie Bell touchdown and reminding them that.....\"He could [run?] 15 minutes in a phone booth...... and he wouldn't even touch the sides!!!\" Also the one, when he thanked Gil Chapman's mom after a great touchdown run against Mich. St..... \"And Michigan really wants to thank Mrs. Chapman, for the birth of her son!!!\" Oh I could go on and on!\n\nI'll never, ever forget Bob Ufer and I'm glad nobody else has either! Please let me close with one last funny Uferism.........\n\n\"When you spend your entire adult life around Fritz Crisler, Benny (Oesterban), Bump (Elliott), and Bo Schembechler.....you learn that football is a religion and Saturday is the Holy Day of Obligation!!!\"\n\nGod Bless You Bob Ufer .....up there in football's Valhalla!!!\n\nGo Blue!!!\n\nSteve Cushman\n\nFlushing, MI.\n\nWe tailgate outdoors in all types of weather, except sleet. About 3 years ago, after a Michigan victory, we decided to move our party indoors to the Cub's AC bar (near the Michigan golf course) when the north wind and ice moved in. I am known among the group as a Michigan trivia buff and our indoor party soon became a trivia contest. Many of us remember Bob's broadcasts and occasionally we were injecting Ufer'isms into the contest (you know, \"hot herring in his cumberbund\", \"Bless his maize and blue heart\", the Patton scoring horn, things like that).\n\nA gentleman at the next table joined in our contest. He gave me more than a run for my money and in most cases was beating me quite handily. Not being used to being on the losing end, we started to reach deep into the trivia bag from Yost to Crisler to Schembechler. Where ever the discussion went, our new acquaintance just seemed to gain knowledge.\n\nFinally, the stranger smiled and showed us a watch that he wore to all Michigan home games. On the back was a thank you note to Bob Ufer from one of Bo's Rose Bowl teams. He introduced himself as Bob's son, and said he was pleased that people still remembered his father and his broadcasts.\n\nTomorrow, as with all home games, there will be a small tethered blimp flying over the southeast corner of the stadium with the single word UFER.\n\nGo Blue! Brian Bartlett '79\n\nThanks so much for this Web page. I really enjoyed the recordings. I only wish there were more! I thought I would write and tell you about some tapes I made years ago as a teenager when I lived and breathed Michigan football -- especially the Ufer broadcasts. Remember back then that Michigan was only on TV once or twice a year, usually the OSU game. So most of us fans who couldn't go to the games were glued to our radios listening to Ufe.\n\nIt's been years since I pulled out [my old Michigan broadcast] tapes, but your audio clips inspired me. Regards,\n\nSteve Davenport\n\nLifetime rabid U-M fan\n\nGO BLUE!\n\nMy brother turned me on to your site which he found in USA Today. Bob Ufer......what can you say about the man. I never went to U of M, but have been a Michigan for all of my 52 years. Saturday afternoon before the TV (with sound turned off) and radio ON with Mr. Ufer. Just great to listen to your RA files of Mr. Ufer. And you must also remember J. P. McCarthy's Friday before the Ohio State game shows also!! Great memories. THANK'S.\n\nThank you for putting together the Web page about Bob Ufer memories.\n\nI was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan and now live in Cologne, Germany. I am probably the biggest Wolverine fan in the country right now!\n\nMy most memorable Bob Ufer broadcast was when I was 8 years old, during the 1978 OSU-MICH game. The game just started and I couldn\u00a6t figure out why my mom had turned off the TV volume. Dad then brought in the radio and I heard Bob Ufer\u00a6s voice. He was a true Wolverine fanatic. \"Who is that guy?\" I asked. \"It\u00a6s Bob Ufer\" and that\u00a6s all that had to be said. In the first half of the game, Rod Feaster caught a pass from Rick Leach for the go ahead score. I\u00a6ll never forget Bob Ufer screaming on the radio. Michigan won 14-3 and was going to the Rose Bowl and I was a very happy kid.\n\nAside from the band, 100,000 fans, the dark uniforms, black shoes and striped helmets, Bob Ufer was an extra special ingredient that made Michigan Football something special on Saturdays in the 1970s. I miss listening to him.\n\nMr. Loose, I just spent the last half hour listening to the Ufer Real Audio files on your Meeeeechigan page. They are absolutely wonderful. I listened to them over and over....\n\nI graduated from U of M in 91. My memories of Ann Arbor and Michigan Stadium on an Autumn Saturday are my finest and cherished dearly. I still remember Bob Ufer's voice ringing out of the Fraternity house's windows on game day in tribute to the greatest.\n\nI, myself, have a meager tribute to our Michigan Wolverines on the Internet. As far as I am concerned the more the merrier.\n\nI have a link to your page, I hope you don't mind.\n\nSign me Going Blue....\n\nRichard Fiori\n\nScottsdale, Arizona\n\n\n\nHello,\n\nMy name is Joe Vocke. I found your site today by doing a search for Ufer. I am a '93 UM grad, and am an avid 'M' football fan. I have been into 'M' for as long as I remember. My family has always been loyal 'M' followers.\n\nOne of my most cherished memories as a kid is watching 'M' on t.v. with the tv volume down, and listening to WJR with Ufe. I have his tapes, and still cry when I hear the last second td catch from A.C.\n\nGo Blue !!\n\nJoe Vocke joseh.b.vocke@owens-corning.com\n\nI would like to let you know about Victory Sports' new web site promoting our Wolverines football screen saver.

It was a grey day, rainy and cold in November of 79. Heavily favored Meechigan struggled with IU all game.\n\nJohnny Wangler wasn't sharp and all looked bleak as a tie loomed over Ann Arbor like so many rain clouds, how could we live down the embarrassment of tieing terrible Indiana. Little did we know of the explosive package that was #1, Anthony \"the Darter\" Carter.\n\nIt was a big day for my family that Saturday. My older sister was beginning her first year in Ann Arbor, my parents were on campus visiting, I was playing basketball with my brother back home in the yard listening and loving every word out of Ufer's \"cotton-picking maise and blue mouth.\" We live and die maise and blue football at our home, and I too fell in love with Michigan because of Bob Ufer. I consider that game, though not as important as a Rose Bowl win, my favorite UM moment. As Anthony incredibly crossed the goal in the flagpole endzone, all we could hear over the crowd was Ufer's touchdown horn again and again, I never jumped so high in my whole life. We didn't need the TV for the replay, nothing could compare to the picture we had painted in our mind's that day via the radio.\n\nThough almost thirty, I still have the Sunday Detroit News sports section framed on my wall to remind me of that game. When Bob died, a bit of the special nature of Saturday's in Ann Arbor died along with him. He was truly one of the greats and I miss hearing him every time I hear a game.\n\nUMkidd@aol.com\n\nJust finished reading your notes about Bob Ufer. I constantly listen to his tapes and his picture hangs in my bedroom. I grew up around Ann Arbor. I remember my dad putting on the fight song on Saturdays and waking us up. I would spend the rest of the day listening to the game thoughts etc. I couldn't wait to hear Bob come on. I would laugh, cheer and cry right along with Bob. It was the one thing I looked forward to year after year. Now I carry on the tradition by waking my son to my Michigan CD every Saturday morning in the fall. Although he won't understand what Bob meant, he can sense the spirit of Michigan present in our house.\n\nNice Home Page, I will add you as a link to my Michigan Page.\n\nThanks and Go Blue!!\n\nSteve Staton\n\n\n\nI'm a proud graduate of the UofM, 1938-1940,1946-1948 BSE. My best memory was of a group of veterans who attended a meeting of the SDS, a communist organization, voted themselves in to all the offices and then voted to disband the whole organization. Can you imagine what would happen to them today?\n\nJust read your Michigan Football page with a nostalgic tear in my eye. Who couldn't fall in love with UM football when one of their earliest memories is the voice of Bob Ufer. I have the two highlight tapes that WJR produced, plus a rebroadcast of a 1970s UM MSU game. Needless to say they are the centerpiece of every Saturday tailgate party in Ann Arbor. I also have a LP of him highlighting UM's 5 top games of all time. I bought it for $10 at a memorabilia sale but haven't transferred it to tape yet since I don't have a phonograph. If you have any Ufer recordings you'd like to trade let me know.\n\nThe highlight of my apartment is a authentic Michigan helmet and a seat from the original Michigan Stadium with Bob's faced cared into it. It's beautiful. Feel free to write back about any of your memories of Bob. He was the best.\n\nWatch for me this Saturday with 106,000 of my closest friends when the Blue stomps the Green (he says with fingers crossed)\n\nDon Helfrich, Rochester Hills, MI\n\nI hit your website today and played some Bob Ufer audios for my wife ... she didn't really understand. But I thought you might appreciate my application called PocketPigskin. The database runs on PCs, Palm OS, and Pocket PC PDAs. Jim Talbot ('84)\n\nMy mother, who just passed away, talks about a boy she dated who played football on a Rose Bowl team '48? '51? His name was Bill Olenroth (sp?) and he played tackle. Apparently while he was away at the Rose Bowl was when Mom met my Dad, but that's not the story. I have a standout son who plays tackle in H.S. and his dream is to play for the maize&blue. Yet I cannot find any info on Olenroth. Any Help here?

He died on November 27 from natural causes at the age of 94. Miller, one of four Bob Millers to play professional baseball, played for the Philadelphia Phillies from 1949-1958.\n\n(The other Bob Millers: Robert W. Miller played in 1890-91 in the American Association; Robert Gerald Miller played for three teams from 1953-62; Robert Lane Miller played for 10 teams between 1957-74. All four Bob Millers were pitchers.)\n\nRobert John Miller was born on June 16, 1926, in Detroit. He went to high school there, he went to college there, and when his baseball career ended, he spent almost 40 years as a college baseball coach there, too. The only thing that the lifelong National Leaguer didn\u2019t do in Detroit was pitch in a major-league game.\n\nAccording to his obituary in The Detroit News, Miller was a three-sport athlete at St. Mary\u2019s of Redford High School, playing basketball and football as well as baseball. In 1943, Miller was named as a defensive end on the Detroit Free Press All-Catholic League team \u2014 he was also St. Mary\u2019s best wide receiver. As a 6\u20193\u2033 high school junior, he was an intimidating presence on the mound during baseball season. The baseball team won the First Division West Side title in Miller\u2019s senior year of 1944, and he pitched the team to an 8-1 over St. Leo\u2019s to win the title.\n\nSource: The Evening Sun, May 11, 1950.\n\nMiller said that the Detroit Tigers were interested in signing him while he was a high school pitcher. \u201cBut they beat around the bush too much after I lost two Catholic high school city finals to Art Houtteman in Briggs Stadium,\u201d he said. The Tigers focused on Houtteman instead, and he would become an All-Star pitcher for the team.\n\nMiller had to put his education and athletics on hold after high school graduation, as he was inducted into the Army. He served for a total of 26 months. Miller said he spent a month in combat on northern Luzon during six months in the Philippines. He then spent a year in Japan, where he pitched for the entire summer of 1946. After his discharge, he attended the University of Detroit Mercy for two years. He pitched on the school\u2019s baseball team in 1947 and 1948.\n\nDue to his military service, Miller was a 22-year-old sophomore in 1948 and decided to turn pro. He signed with the Philadelphia Phillies and was assigned to the club\u2019s Class-B affiliate in Terre Haute, Ind. After some good relief work, Miller made his first start as a pro on June 10 and beat Springfield 9-3. All of Springfield\u2019s runs were unearned, and Miller fanned 5 in the complete game win. He won 6 games for Terre Haute in 1948 and turned in an excellent season in 1949, winning 19 games and leading the league with 207 strikeouts. He was also one of the team\u2019s better hitters, as he batted .268 with 5 home runs. It wasn\u2019t a lights-out dominant year, as he gave up 255 hits in 255 innings and had an ERA of 3.95, but he still walked away with the Three-I League\u2019s Most Valuable Player Award. He also earned a late-season call-up with the Phillies that year.\n\nMiller threw a scoreless inning of relief against the Reds on September 16, 1949, in his major-league debut. He allowed 1 hit \u2014 a single to Ted Kluszewski. He appeared in 3 games and threw 2-2/3 scoreless innings with the Phillies.\n\nThe 1950 Philadelphia Phillies, aka The Whiz Kids, are one of the most celebrated teams in Phillies history. Even with so many young, inexperienced players on the roster (hence the nickname), the Phillies won 91 games to clinch the NL pennant, the first time the team had finished first since 1915. The pitching staff was anchored by youngsters Robin Roberts, Curt Simmons (the last surviving Whiz Kid) and Miller. In his first full season, Miller turned in an 11-6 record in 35 games (21 starts), with a 3.57 ERA. He threw 7 complete games and 2 shutouts while posting an ERA+ of 113. Miller finished second to the Braves Sam Jethroe for the Rookie of the Year award.\n\nPhillies manager Eddie Sawyer, left, with his Whiz Kids pitching staff: Curt Simmons, Robin Roberts, Bob Miller and Bubba Church.\n\nThe first win of Miller\u2019s career came on April 29, 1950, and was a 2-1 victory over the Boston Braves. Boston\u2019s only run came on a throwing error by catcher Stan Lopata \u2014 an old teammate of Miller\u2019s from the Detroit American Legion days. Miller won his first 8 decisions before the Cubs tagged him with a loss on July 16.\n\nMiller admitted that he was nervous at the start of the season. \u201cBut I\u2019m gaining confidence with every game now that I\u2019ve found major leaguers can be fooled just the same as in the minors.\u201d\n\nMiller wasn\u2019t as effective in the second half of the season thanks to an ailing shoulder. He did start the Phillies\u2019 90th win of the season and pitched into the seventh inning before tiring. The Phillies were swept in the World Series by the Yankees, and Miller started Game Four. He didn\u2019t last long, though. The Yankees leadoff hitter, Gene Woodling, reached on an error by second baseman Granny Hamner. He advanced to second base on a Phil Rizzuto grounder and scored on a single by Yogi Berra. Berra raced to third base on a wild pitch and scored on a double by Joe DiMaggio. That was enough for Phillies manager Eddie Sawyer, who removed Miller for reliever Jim Konstanty. The Yankees, backed by the pitching of Whitey Ford, won 5-2 to win the World Series.\n\nMiller\u2019s excellent rookie season was followed by two bad ones, and he bounced between the big leagues and the minors. He spent most of 1951 as a little-used reliever and accumulated a 2-1 record and 6.82 ERA in 17 games before he was optioned to the Wilmington Blue Rocks in August. In 1952, he made the Opening Day roster and allowed 1 run in 2 innings of work against the New York Giants before being sent to AAA Baltimore. He won 12 games with the Orioles and returned in September to make 2 more appearances, including an unsuccessful start against the Cubs.\n\nSome of those struggles came from a couple of injuries. He injured his back in the second half of the 1950 season when he fell trying to catch a train at the North Philadelphia Station. Then he hurt his arm and wouldn\u2019t be fully healthy until 1953. He began that season in the bullpen, but after Curt Simmons injured his foot in a lawn mower accident and was lost for several weeks, he moved into the starting rotation. Miller turned in an 8-9 record and an even 4.00 ERA in 20 starts and 15 relief outings. Many of those losses were hard-luck defeats, where the Phillies offense failed to support good pitching performances. He had 3 shutouts, including a 2-0 3-hitter against the Milwaukee Braves on September 9.\n\n\u201cI think I pitched the best ball I ever did over those last eight or nine weeks,\u201d Miller later said.\n\nMiller made 16 starts in 1954, but he began to see more work coming out of the bullpen. As a starter in \u201954, he was 3-8 with a 4.96 ERA, but he was 4-1 with a 3.28 ERA as a reliever. Opposing batters hit .260 off him as a reliever but more than 50 points when he started a game. Miller would make just 7 more starts over the final 4 years of his career.\n\nSource: The Philadelphia Inquirer, March 18, 1956.\n\nFor the next three seasons, Miller became a very reliable reliever for new Phillies manager Mayo Smith. He made 40 appearances in 1955 and had a fine 2.41 ERA while earning an 8-4 record. He wasn\u2019t a typical reliever who relied on strikeouts to get through innings \u2014 he had 28 K\u2019s and 28 walks in 89-2/3 innings in 1955 \u2014 but he had the lowest ERA on the staff.\n\nHe could still make a spot start and do very well at it. One of the best games of his career came on August 25, 1956 \u2014 against the Milwaukee Braves. He retired the first 14 batters before Bobby Thomson lined a single to center in the fifth inning. Miller had to settle for a 2-hit, 3-0 shutout. Immediately after the game, he flew to Detroit to attend the funeral of his grandmother, so he couldn\u2019t exactly enjoy the moment.\n\nBetween 1955 and 1957, Miller appeared in 121 games for the Phillies, with 7 starts, and had a 13-15 record with 12 saves. He also had an ERA of 2.84 and a WHIP of 1.230. He attributed his success to the fact that Smith used him exclusively in one role, instead of moving him in and out of the rotation constantly.\n\n\u201cWhen Mayo Smith told me [in 1955] that he planned to restrict me to relief work, I was more than satisfied,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care whether I start or relieve, but I don\u2019t like the idea of doing both.\u201d\n\nMiller made it through his first outing of 1958 safely, pitching 2 scoreless innings against the Pirates on April 24. After that, though, he gave up runs in almost every other game in which he appeared, and he was soon relegated to a mop-up role. He picked up his only win on July 29 by shutting down the Cardinals for 2 innings, lowering his ERA to 9.00 on the season. Shortly after that, the Braves got their revenge for all the times he bested them and scored 6 times off him in 3 innings on August 10. It was his last appearance in the major leagues. The Phillies released him to the Miami Marlins of the International League on August 12, with an 11.69 ERA in 17 games and 36 hits allowed in 22-1/3 innings.\n\nMiller played in a handful of games for Miami and was briefly property of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1959 when they bought his contract in the offseason. That gave them two Bob Millers on the team, which would have made for some confusion had both made the team. The Cardinals returned Miller to Philadelphia, and he pitched briefly in the minors for Buffalo and Montreal before calling it quits at the end of the season.\n\nIn his 10-year career, Miller had a record of 42-42, with 15 saves. He appeared in 261 games and made 58 starts, with 23 complete games and 6 shutouts. He struck out 263 batters and walked 247, and he had a career WHIP of 1.382.\n\nAfter baseball, Miller returned to Detroit and took a job as the assistant baseball coach at the University of Detroit Mercy. When head coach Lloyd Brazil was killed in a car accident in 1965, Miller took over the role and remained head coach until his retirement in 2001. The baseball program was cut by the college in 2004.\n\nSource: University of Detroit Mercy Athletics.\n\nMiller had a career record of 896-780-2 as coach of the Detroit Mercy Titans, the most wins of any coach in the program\u2019s history as well as the most by any Michigan college coach. Sixteen of his former players were drafted by MLB organizations, and more than 40 others signed professional contracts. Several of his players, including Dick Drago, Bill Fahey and Pete Craig, reached the major leagues. His sons Pat and Bob Jr. both played for him as well.\n\nMiller was inducted into the University of Detroit Mercy Hall of Fame in 1979, the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Michigan Baseball Hall of Fame in 2020. He received the John Conti Letterman of Distinction Award, which is given to former Titan athletes who go above and beyond at work and in the community, in 2011.\n\nChris Czarnik, a former Titan player who took over as head coach upon Miller\u2019s retirement, said the following: \u201cCoach Miller was a larger-than-life person to generations of Titan baseball players. He was the man that was watching from behind a distant fence at a remote ballpark on a hot and dusty summer evening, and when he saw a Titan, he knew it. Decades later, he could make a former player beam with pride by recalling that moment, \u2018I remember the first time I saw you swing that bat; he would say, and bring alive a detail of a ringing double in Redford or Livonia or East Detroit \u2013 and how he wouldn\u2019t leave your driveway that night until you told him you would be part of his team. He knew baseball before it could be measured. He loved the game and could feel it in his blood when it was time to squeeze a run in or when a struggling freshman needed a word of confidence. Coach also cherished his players and the University. He made teammates of us, linking generations, and captured an unforgettable era. He earned this legacy. But perhaps the thing I\u2019ll remember coach most for is how his children looked up to him and how proud he was of them. You could see it in their eyes and hear it in his unforgettable voice. I know I speak for all Titans in expressing our love and condolences to his family upon the loss of this legendary man.\u201d\n\nFor more information: The Detroit News\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @rip_mlb\n\n\n\nFollow me on Instagram: @rip_mlb\n\n\n\nFollow me on Facebook: ripbaseball\n\n\n\nSupport RIP Baseball\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"url": "https://www.ccsportshof.com/inductees/bob-miller/", "page_content": "Bob Miller was a three-year letterman in football and basketball at Piedmont but basketball was Miller\u2019s sport and he excelled wherever he played. As a senior at Piedmont in the 1947-48 season, he was one of five players chosen first-team all-tournament at the Sixth District tournament. The team was dominated by players from district champion Etowah, Gadsden and Talladega. Miller was the lone selection from a small-school team.\n\nIn high school, Miller was at his best against bigger schools. He scored 20 of his team\u2019s 30 points in a 31-30 loss to Oxford. He led Piedmont with another 20-point performance in a 41-34 victory over Anniston. Miller scored 24 points in Piedmont\u2019s 47-30 win against Alexandria. In a 33-23 loss to Etowah, Miller had 16 points. He finished the season with 354 points.\n\nAfter completing high school, Miller spent two seasons with coach J.W. Stephenson\u2019s Jacksonville State teams. In Miller\u2019s sophomore year, Jacksonville State was 23-6 and Miller led in scoring with 428 points. That total was almost 25 percent of the Gamecocks\u2019 total as a team. He connected on 76 percent of his free throws and shot 41 percent from the field.\n\nMilitary service during the Korean War interrupted Miller\u2019s basketball career for two years. His final two years of basketball were played at Auburn University for coach Joel Eaves.\n\nMiller missed Auburn\u2019s initial games of the 1952-53 season but led the team in scoring with 228 points after gaining eligibility and was named the Tigers\u2019 most outstanding player of the 1953 season.\n\nAs a senior, he served as Auburn\u2019s captain and averaged a double-double of 17.8 points and 11.5 rebounds per game over a 24-game season.

A bout with polio the summer after his sophomore year landed him in the hospital for 10 months, during which time he kept up with his course work by listening to reel-to-reel tapes of his classes. With one leg completely paralyzed and the other partially immobilized, Mr. Miller\u2019s athletic career at the Heights was over, but he had just begun to forge strong ties with BC Athletics.\n\n\n\nFor some years, BC had played a majority of its home football games at Fenway Park, but at the end of the 1956 season the Boston Red Sox ended the arrangement. In January of 1957, then-BC President Joseph R. N. Maxwell, S.J., announced the University would build a new football stadium to open that fall. As fundraising efforts for the new facility began, Mr. Miller\u2014who had been elected Class of 1957 president\u2014spearheaded a \u201cDollar Per Student\u201d campaign that yielded $2,600.\n\n\n\nThat was not the extent of Mr. Miller\u2019s or his fellow undergraduates\u2019 involvement in the opening of Alumni Stadium, as he recounted in a 1982 interview with BC's undergraduate newspaper, The Heights: Students supplied labor\u2014especially in reconditioning the stands from Alumni Field, the old venue for BC football\u2014and as the stadium\u2019s debut on September 21, 1957, drew nearer, they aided in painting, cleaning up \u201cand tying loose ends,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\"We painted the stands just a day or two before the game; little did we know, but some of the paint didn't dry fast enough. We had people coming in the athletic office all of the following week demanding that we send their clothes to the cleaners or buy them new clothes.\"\n\n\n\nWhen, with just a few days left, the fire marshal said there were not enough exits in the stands, \u201cwe just took out a few rows,\u201d Mr. Miller added\u2014which wound up creating another problem: \u201cWhat nobody thought of was that the game was a sell-out and that the seats we removed had already been sold. People wondered what was going on when they came looking for the missing seats.\"\n\n\n\nDuring the Alumni Stadium campaign, Mr. Miller had met William Flynn \u201939, who at the time was secretary for BC\u2019s Alumni Association. Later in 1957, Flynn was appointed athletic director, and he offered Mr. Miller the position of business manager for athletics.\n\n\n\nBut the job Mr. Miller coveted was sports information director, and when it became available in the fall of 1960, he put his name in. While he lacked the journalistic background of most SIDs, Mr. Miller had developed friendships with Boston-area sportswriters as well as athletics personnel at other colleges. An acumen for public relations, combined with his in-depth knowledge of, and love for, his alma mater made him the ideal candidate, as a Heights columnist noted almost three years after Mr. Miller\u2019s appointment.\n\n\n\n\u201c[He] has earned the close friendships of countless alumni, old and young. The number of Boston sportswriters that don't count Eddie as a friend are few. His easy-going smile and dynamic personality have brightened many a room dimmed by the cigar smoke of writers.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe 1960s and early \u201970s were a transformative period for collegiate athletics, especially football, marked by increased coverage from television and other media and, in the wake of the civil rights movement, a greater spotlight on Black athletes. It was an eventful time for sports at Boston College as well, with plenty of activity to keep Mr. Miller busy: BC football established itself as a solid regional program; the men\u2019s basketball team enjoyed success under the tutelage of Boston Celtics legend Bob Cousy, making it to a regional final in the 1967 NCAA Tournament; the men\u2019s hockey team reached the NCAA Frozen Four in 1963, 1965 (losing the championship game), 1968, and 1973; and the baseball team made three appearances in the College World Series during the 1960s.\n\n\n\nDespite the difficulties travel posed for him, Mr. Miller made it a point to be on hand for as many BC sporting events as possible\u2014even after his years as SID\u2014whether to hockey games at Cornell and St. Lawrence, basketball games at Syracuse and Georgetown, or down south for Eagle football games in Texas and Alabama.\n\n\n\nMr. Miller\u2019s contribution to BC Athletics was recognized when he entered the BC Varsity Club Athletic Hall of Fame in 1977, three years after he had moved on to become the University\u2019s director of public relations. Speaking with The Heights after his appointment, Mr. Miller said he saw his task, and that of his colleagues, to tell the story of Boston College \u201con a wider spectrum,\u201d not only through Boston-area media but also that of \u201cNew York, Washington and the national press.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. Miller asserted that BC\u2019s story was one worth reporting: \"The excellence of our academic program, faculty, and our students are probably where we are going to get the most mileage. We should also gain recognition because we are one of the top two or three Catholic universities in the country, and our alumni are successful in a great variety of fields.\" He added that it was important to make clear \"that BC is not just a small college but actually a university.\"\n\n\n\nAmong other accomplishments during his years as public relations director, Mr. Miller revamped several University publications and founded Boston College Colleague, a biweekly newspaper to present campus news, events, and features aimed at University administrators, faculty, and staff. Colleague became Boston College Biweekly in 1980 and Boston College Chronicle in 1992.\n\n\n\nMr. Miller also played an integral part in obtaining support for the University, through his network of relationships formed with BC alumni in the business and political communities, during what would be a period of major growth during the presidential administration of J. Donald Monan, S.J., for whom he later served as special assistant.\n\n\n\nMr. Miller, who retired from the University in 1996, co-authored with his daughter Michelle a biography of his friend Wallace E. Carroll, the entrepreneur, businessman, philanthropist and namesake of BC\u2019s Carroll School of Management. His honors included the Sports Information Director Award from the All-American Football Foundation and the Press Box Award from the New England Writers.\n\n\n\nWhen he earned a doctorate in higher education of administration, he wrote his dissertation, \u201cFulfilling a Mission: Profiles of Outstanding Student Athletes at Boston College,\u201d on the role Jesuit education played in the formation of BC\u2019s student-athletes across several decades.\n\n\u201cEddie Miller was an \u2018old-fashioned\u2019 public relations professional who perfected his trade in the days before texts, emails, and cable television networks took over the industry,\u201d said Reid Oslin \u201968, M.S.P. \u201971, who succeeded Mr. Miller as SID in 1974.\n\n\n\nOslin noted that Mr. Miller was not shy about showing his affection for BC, whether sporting a maroon-and-gold tie or\u2014when Massachusetts first offered vanity plates to drivers in the late 1960s\u2014obtaining an \"EAGLES\" plate for his shiny white convertible.\n\n\n\nMr. Miller also maintained his connection to BC Athletics, Oslin added, and was a familiar figure at Eagles football games and other events for many years.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe was a marvelous \u2018in-person\u2019 representative of Boston College, always with a sincere handshake, a warm smile, a funny story, and a genuine eagerness to promote the University that he so loved.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. Miller is survived by his wife, Patricia (Klier), whom he married after his release from the hospital following his bout with polio; his children\u2014all of whom have a Boston College degree\u2014Jeannie Hynes, Stephanie Greene (a professor in the Carroll School of Management), Edward Jr., Christine, John, Michelle, Gretchen Johnson, Gregory, and Julie Freking; 23 grandchildren and 12 great grandchildren.\n\n\n\nBurial will take place at Milton Cemetery.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to:\n\nThe Edward D. and Patricia K.

He was 94.\n\nMiller pitched for 10 seasons in the major leagues, all with the Phillies, from 1949-58 \u2014 sandwiched between two stints at Detroit, the first as a player, the latter as a coach.\n\n\"What my dad told me not too long ago, he said, 'I've lived a charmed life, I got to live my dream from a little kid, which was to play pro baseball,\" said Bob Miller Jr., one of Miller's four children.\n\n\"Nothing was more important to my dad than baseball and U of D.\"\n\nOne of his best seasons was 1950, when he was 11-6 with a 3.57 ERA in 35 games, 21 of which were starts, as the Phillies went 91-63 to win the National League. Fellow pitcher Curt Simmons is the last surviving member of that Phillies team. (Another teammate on that cast-of-characters squad, late first baseman Eddie Waitkus, was said to be an inspiration for Robert Redford's character in \"The Natural\" \u2014 having been shot by a fan at a hotel early in his career.)\n\nIn 1950, Miller recorded seven complete games and two shutouts, finishing second in National League rookie-of-the-year voting, to the Boston Braves' Sam Jethroe. Miller also made one start in the 1950 World Series, lasting two-thirds of an inning in the must-win Game 4 of the Yankees' eventual sweep. That was the lone postseason appearance of his career, which spanned 261 games, 68 of which were starts. He was mostly a reliever the rest of his career, and even closed games late in his career.\n\nA 6-foot-3, 190-pound right-hander, he threw a shutout and had four hits in a game in 1953 at Chicago's Wrigley Field, the only man ever to do that at that historic ballpark. Also in 1953, Miller was the reliever who took over in the eighth inning of a game started by Michigan State alum and future Hall-of-Famer Robin Roberts, who was working on a 28-game complete-game streak.\n\nMiller pitched in the minor leagues in 1959, for the Phillies and Los Angeles Dodgers (he also briefly was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals, but never pitched for them in the minors or majors), before retiring.\n\nIn 1963, he took a job as an assistant coach for the University of Detroit baseball team.\n\nHis boss, head coach Lloyd Brazil, died in a car accident in 1965 and Miller took over as head coach, a job he held through the 2001 season. During his tenure, Miller's teams were was 896-780-2, his wins ranking in the top 30 in NCAA history, and tops for any baseball coach in Michigan.\n\nUnder Miller, Detroit had winning seasons 25 of 36 years, making the NCAA Tournament in 1965 and winning a school-record 36 games in 1975. In 1997, it won its first Midwestern Collegiate Conference.\n\nSixteen Detroit players were drafted by MLB during Miller's coaching tenure, including son Pat in 1990, and two of them made the major leagues, Pete Craig and Dick Drago. His son Bob Jr. also played for him.\n\nThe job wasn't just coaching. He also mowed the baseball field's grass, laid the chalk, raked the field, and ran the tractor. He never had a paid assistant coach, so he did all the recruiting himself.\n\n\"He made hardly any money, and worked 60 hours a week,\" Bob Miller Jr. said. \"He did it all himself, and he gladly did it because he loved U of D.\"\n\nMiller retired after the 2001 season; in 2004, Detroit Mercy baseball was cut because of budget issues.\n\nMiller played three sports at St. Mary's of Redford, including football and basketball. He had basketball scholarship offers, but out of high school he served four years in the U.S. Army, including in World War II. After his armed-services career, he attended Detroit Mercy and pitched two seasons, 1947-48. As a freshman, he was 3-2 with a 2.34 ERA; sophomore season, he had three wins. The Phillies then signed him.\n\nMiller is a member of the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame (1999) and Detroit Mercy's Hall of Fame (1979). He was scheduled to be inducted to the Michigan Baseball of Fame, along with former Michigan quarterback Drew Henson, in August, but the ceremony was canceled because of COVID-19.\n\nMiller died of natural causes, and lived in West Bloomfield. He is survived by his four children, Thomas, Bob, Mary and Patrick.

Vowels, Jr.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow #DetroitsCollegeTeam: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | YouTube\n\nThe University of Detroit Mercy Department of Athletics is in deep mourning as it learned that former player, longtime baseball coach and former major league baseball player Bob Miller passed away on Saturday night due to natural causes.Coach Miller was 94 years old.After serving four years in the military after an outstanding prep career, he pitched two seasons for the Titans from 1947-48 before signing with the Philadelphia Phillies. As a freshman, he was 3-2 with a 2.34 ERA and then collected another three wins as a sophomore.After his professional days were over, he came back to his alma mater as an assistant coach in 1963 before taking the reins in 1965 following the tragic auto accident that took the life of head coach Lloyd Brazil, his college coach. That turned into 36 years of greatness as he guided his alma mater from 1965 to 2001 recording an 896-780-2 mark, top 30 in NCAA history when he retired and still the most by any coach in the state of Michigan.The Titans tallied winning seasons in 25 of his 36 years - including reaching 30 victories nine times with a school-record 36 victories in 1975 - reaching the NCAA Tournament in 1965 and claiming its first-ever MCC baseball championship in 1997.During his time, 16 Titans were drafted by the MLB, including his son Pat in 1990, while over 40 other players signed professional contracts. Two of the players he coached made the major league in Pete Craig (1966) and Dick Drago (1969).He signed with Philadelphia in 1948 and enjoyed a 10-year career with the Phillies, appearing in 261 games, starting 69, and going 42\u201342 with 15 saves and a 3.96 ERA.In two years in the minors, he was 6-5 with the Terre Haute Phillies of the Class-B Three I League in 1948 before dominating the 1949 season, earning the MVP after going 19-9 with a 2.72 ERA and striking out 207 in 255 innings.That sparked a call to the majors at the end of the 1949 season, where he pitched in three games, not allowing a run in 2 2/3 innings. At the age of 23, he made his MLB debut on September 16, 1949, at Crosley Field in Cincinnati throwing a scoreless eighth in a 2-1 loss.In 1950, he was a member of the Phillies' \"Whiz Kids\" that won the National League pennant as he went 11-6 and a save, throwing seven complete games and two shutouts and ending the season with a 3.57 ERA in 190.0 innings. He was second for the Rookie of the Year award behind Sam Jethroe of the Boston Braves. He was used primarily as a starter appearing in 25 games with 22 starts.He won his first game on Apr. 29, 1950, tossing a complete game in a 2-1 win at home over the Boston Braves, scattering six hits and striking out seven. Miller would start out with an 8-0 record as a rookie in 1950 and at one point had thrown 22 2/3 straight scoreless innings. He would also start game four of the world series that year against the New York Yankees.Miller was part of two historic moments in the 1953 season. First, he was the reliever who came into the game to for Philadelphia ace Robin Roberts, who was on his way to a major-league record 29 consecutive complete-game starts when he ran into trouble in the eighth against the Dodgers. Against the Cubs, he tossed a 7-0 complete game shutout giving up just six hits, but he was also 4-for-5 at the plate with two runs scored and a RBI, making him the only pitcher in baseball history to throw a shutout and get four hits in the same game at Wrigley Field.Miller was a three-sport star in high school, playing baseball, football and basketball at St. Mary's in Redford, Michigan, and actually earned a basketball scholarship to the University before pursuing baseball when he came back from the war.Miller has been inducted into a number of Hall of Fames in the Titan Hall Of Fame (1979), Michigan Sports Hall of Fame (1999) and the Michigan Baseball Hall Of Fame (2020). In 2011, he received the John Conti Letterman of Distinction Award, presented to former Titan varsity athletes who go above and beyond at work and in the community.Final arrangements are being made for family only, but a celebration of his life will be announced in the future.\"I was deeply hit when I heard the news of coach Miller passing. He was an icon here for so many years and touched so many players. I hear stories all the time of how much he meant to this University and how much he loved U-D. I have had the chance to talk to him and his kids since I have been here and something that always comes across is the love and pride for the University that the Miller family has. He will truly be missed by everyone.\" -\"The biggest thing was that I was a walk-on and he kept me on the team for a few years before I worked my way into the line-up. I was grateful that he kept me on the team and was fortunate that I was able to play and then get an invite to the Tigers in Lakeland (Florida). That was because he gave me that chance and saw something in me to keep me on the team. After I graduated, I realized how much time and money he put into the program all those years. He loved the program and he loved U-D.\"Coach Miller was a larger-than-life person to generations of Titan baseball players. He was the man that was watching from behind a distant fence at a remote ballpark on a hot and dusty summer evening, and when he saw a Titan, he knew it. Decades later, he could make a former player beam with pride by recalling that moment, 'I remember the first time I saw you swing that bat; he would say, and bring alive a detail of a ringing double in Redford or Livonia or East Detroit - and how he wouldn't leave your driveway that night until you told him you would be part of his team. He knew baseball before it could be measured. He loved the game and could feel it in his blood when it was time to squeeze a run in or when a struggling freshman needed a word of confidence. Coach also cherished his players and the University. He made teammates of us, linking generations, and captured an unforgettable era. He earned this legacy. But perhaps the thing I'll remember coach most for is how his children looked up to him and how proud he was of them. You could see it in their eyes and hear it in his unforgettable voice. I know I speak for all Titans in expressing our love and condolences to his family upon the loss of this legendary man.\" -\"I don't know what to say, this is so saddening. We use to drive cars to our games and my first year, we rode a lot with coach Miller and he was such a funny guy and a prankster. I will always remember how lively he was and he loved the school, he loved U-D. One day, I remember in practice, he was pitching to us and he said the way he was feeling right now, he was probably in his late 30's, that he hoped he didn't give up baseball too soon. He loved the game.\" -\"I owe a lot because of him, he was such a great coach and a great person. The way he and his wife made sandwiches when we were going on the road, it was about family. You realized what he put into that program and deserves all the credit he gets. He gave me the opportunity to walk-on and start at shortstop and he gave me a lot of confidence. When I coming out of high school, I wasn't going to college, but he gave me an opportunity and it was all because of him. He knew the game, loved the game and he made everything fun. In 1975, we won 36 games and should have got into the playoffs, but that was one of the best teams I have ever played on beating Eastern Michigan and Michigan State.\" -\"He gave me a great chance to play college baseball. He was a great guy and he probably had as much fun as any of the guys playing. I remember the day he came over to my house to recruit me and he walked in and it was like my uncle walking in. Here is Bob Miller, great coach, great pitcher and part of the Whiz Kids and he was part of the family and he the program a family. It was an easy sell.\" -Coach was a father figure to all of us. He didn't just teach us about baseball, he taught us about life and how to set ourselves up for success and preparation and living for the moment. More importantly and more than anything was just teaching us to be good men. I remember coach always being proud of the University and being proud of the field that he took care of so well. One of my fondest memories is seeing him on that John Deere tractor on the field, cutting the grass and make sure we had the best playing field possible for a small Division one college.This was just devastating. He was a great, great guy, a great coach and mentor and he meant everything to me. That booming voice, the presence he had whenever he walked in a room. He had that personality that everyone loved. He was good to everyone and it's quite a loss. He was everything to me, he gave me my chance, believed in me and gave me confidence and I will always be grateful for that. If you can live a life like him, that's the way to do it. He was a great family man, great baseball guy and couldn't ask for a better coach.\" -\"Playing for coach Miller was a huge honor. He took great care of us and treated every player equally and gave us a chance to play at Detroit Mercy and in Division one. Some of the stories he told us were incredible, just all the great memories he had with the game. Every time you came to the field, he had a new story for you,. Just a great memory he had with everyone he played with. He loved every ballplayer that put a U-D uniform on.\" -"}], "Bob Miller played professional football in the American Football League (AFL) for the Buffalo Bills from 1967 to 1969.": [{"url": "https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MillBo20.htm", "page_content": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen was Bob Miller born?\n\nBob Miller was born on December 11, 1929.\n\nWhere was Bob Miller born?\n\nBob Miller was born in Norwalk, CT.\n\nHow tall was Bob Miller?\n\nBob Miller was 6-3 (190 cm) tall.\n\nHow much did Bob Miller weigh when playing?\n\nBob Miller weighed 242 lbs (109 kg) when playing.\n\nIs Bob Miller in the Hall of Fame?\n\nBob Miller has not been elected into the Hall of Fame.\n\nHow many games did Bob Miller play?\n\nBob Miller played 81 games over his career.\n\nHow many Super Bowls has Bob Miller won?\n\nBob Miller never won a Super Bowl.\n\nWhen did Bob Miller retire?\n\nBob Miller last played in 1958."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/sports/Super-Bowl", "page_content": "The Super Bowl has topped television ratings in the United States every year since the first championship game in 1967.

In 1951 he journeyed south to Tasmania to take up the role as captain-coach of City in the NTFA, a club who hadn\u2019t won an NTFA premiership since 1941; his arrival would usher in the greatest era in the club\u2019s 106-year history. After making his debut for the Redlegs in the opening round of 1951, Miller had become one of the star centremen in the competition by season\u2019s end, leading his side to a Grand Final against Launceston, a match City would lose by 12 points. They would go one better the following year, getting the better of Scottsdale by 20 points.\n\nThe 1952 triumph was to be the first of a hat trick of premierships for City under Miller\u2019s guidance: in 1953 the Redlegs proved too strong for Longford, while the following year it would be Launceston who would be the vanquished challenger, City emerging premiers by five goals. This led to the club\u2019s first state premierships decider since 1941, and as they had done at league level City emerged triumphant, toppling TANFL premiers Hobart by 24 points. During this period Miller became an effective and popular coach, regularly inspiring teammates through pieces of on-field brilliance through the middle of the ground or during a short-lived stint at full forward. Sadly, Miller would watch his teammates\u2019 glorious 1954 achievements from the sidelines, after badly breaking his leg during the NTFA finals. After retiring at the end of 1955 Miller retained his role as coach, and his on-field absence failed to blunt City\u2019s dominance. After falling to Longford in 1955 NTFA decider, Miller\u2019s charges brought home their fourth flag in five years in 1956, overcoming North Launceston by eight points.\n\nAfter (the re-named) City-South failed to reach the Grand Final for the first time under his watch in 1957, Miller stepped down as coach, handing the reigns to champion Centre Half Forward Geoff Long. Miller subsequently spent some time coaching in the country, most notably in the Fingal District Association with Rossarden where he guided the club to a dynasty of six premierships in seven seasons between 1961 and 1967. He was eventually lured back to City-South as coach after nearly 15 years in 1970, replacing club champion Berkley Cox. City-South\u2019s golden era had ended in 1966 and it was hoped that the previously successful Miller would be able to lead the club back into the top echelon of teams in the NTFA. His re-appointment was met with almost immediate success: after reaching the preliminary final in his first season back, City-South finished as minor premiers in 1971, only to be crushed by Scottsdale in the Grand Final by 93 points. Stung by that humiliation, the Redlegs and Miller were back with a vengeance the following year, exacting revenge on Scottsdale to take out the NTFA premiership, before winning their seventh and final State premiership with a magnificent victory over the Darrel Baldock-coached Latrobe by 36 points. Despite this success, Miller stepped down as coach at season\u2019s end, going out on the highest note possible.\n\nIn ten combined seasons as coach of City/City-South, Bob Miller led his side to eight Grand Final appearances, five premierships and two state flags. When the club\u2019s Team of the Century was named in 2002, Miller was an obvious choice as coach. Unfortunately he didn\u2019t live to see himself accorded the honour, passing away in 1993 at the age of 69."}, {"url": "http://www.remembertheafl.com/AFLPlayers.htm", "page_content": "American Football League Roster 1960 - 1969\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nPLAYER POSITION TEAM(S) YEARS COLLEGE\n\n\n\nAbell, Bud LB KC 66-68 Missouri\n\nAbruzzese, Ray DB Buf 62-64 Alabama d. 8/22/2011\n\nNY 65\n\nAdamson, Ken OG Den 60-62 Notre Dame\n\nAddison, Tom LB Bos 60-67 South Carolina d. 6/14/2011\n\nAgajanian, Ben K LA/SD 60, 64 New Mexico\n\nDal 61\n\nOak 62\n\nAkin, Harold OT SD 67-68 Oklahoma State\n\nAlflen, Ted DB-HB Den 69 Springfield\n\nAlford, Bruce K Buf 68-69 TCU\n\nAllard, Don QB NY 61 Boston College d. 5/4/2002\n\nBos 62\n\nAllen, Buddy HB Den 61 Utah State\n\nAllen, Chuck LB SD 61-69 Washington\n\nAllen, Dalva DE Hou 60-61 Houston\n\nOak 62-64\n\nAllen, Don FB Den 60 Texas\n\nAllen, George DT Hou 66 West Texas State\n\nAllen, Jackie DB Oak 69 Baylor\n\nAllison, Jim RB SD 65-68 San Diego State\n\nAlliston, Buddy LB Den 60 Mississippi\n\nAlworth, Lance FL-WR SD 62-69 Arkansas\n\nAmes, Dave HB-DB NY 61 Richmond d. 8/4/2009\n\nDen 61\n\nAnderson, Billy QB Hou 67 Tulsa d. 4/11/1996\n\nAnderson, Dick DB Mia 68-69 Colorado\n\nAnderson, Max RB-KR Buf 68-69 Arizona State\n\nAnderson, Ralph OE LA 60 Los Angeles State d. 11/27/1960\n\n\n\nAndrus, Lou LB Den 67 Brigham Young\n\nAntwine, Houston DT Bos 61-69 Southern Illinois d. 12/26/2011\n\nApple, Jim HB NY 61 Upsala\n\nAppleton, Scott DT Hou 64-66 Texas d. 3/2/1992\n\nSD 67-68\n\nArbanas, Fred OE-TE Dal/KC 62-69 Michigan State\n\nArcher, Dan OG-OT Oak 67 Oregon\n\nCin 68\n\nArmstrong, Ray DT Oak 60 TCU\n\nAsad, Doug OE Oak 60-61 Northwestern\n\nAtchason, Jack OE Hou 60 Western Illinois\n\nBos 60\n\nAtkins, Billy DB-P-K-HB Buf 60-61, 63 Auburn d. 11/5/1991\n\nNY 62-63\n\nDen 64\n\nAtkins, Pervis HB-FL-KR Oak 65-66 New Mexico State\n\nAtkinson, Al LB NY 65-69 Villanova\n\nAtkinson, Frank DT Den 64 Stanford\n\nAtkinson, George DB-KR Oak 68-69 Morris Brown\n\nAuer, Joe RB-KR Buf 64-65 Georgia Tech\n\nMia 66-67\n\nAutry, Hank C Hou 69 Southern Mississippi\n\nAvery, Ken LB Cin 69 Southern Mississippi\n\nAvezzano, Joe C Bos 66 Florida State\n\nBabb, Gene FB-LB Hou 62-63 Austin\n\nBaccaglio, Martin DE SD 68 San Jose State\n\nCin 68-69\n\nBachman, Jay C Den 68-69 Cincinnati\n\nBailey, Teddy RB Buf 67 Cincinnati\n\nBos 69\n\nBaird, Bill DB-KR-HB NY 63-69 San Francisco State\n\nBaker, Art FB Buf 61-62 Syracuse\n\nBaker, Johnny LB-OE Hou 63-66 Mississippi State\n\nSD 67\n\nBaker, Larry OT NY 60 Bowling Green d. 12/23/2000\n\nBaker, Ralph LB NY 64-69 Penn State\n\nBanaszak, Pete RB Oak 66-69 Miami FL\n\nBanfield, Tony DB Hou 60-63, 65 Oklahoma State\n\nBanks, Estes RB Oak 67 Colorado\n\nCin 68\n\nBansavage, Al LB LA 60 USC d. 8/19/2003\n\nOak 61\n\nBarbee, Joe DT Oak 60 Kent State d. 8/12/1969\n\nBarber, Rudy LB Mia 68 Bethune-Cookman\n\nBarber, Stew OT Buf 61-69 Penn State\n\nBarnes, Charley OE Dal 61 Northeast Louisiana\n\nBarnes, Ernie OG-OT NY 60 N.

Its purpose is simply to recognize and acknowledge each of the individuals who contributed on the football field to the league's success. A total of 1,398 players are named, and some summary statistics on the roster's contents are also provided.\n\nThe information in the roster was compiled from the following sources:\n\n\u2500\u2500Total Football II, edited by Bob Carroll, Michael Gershman, David Neft and John Thorn (New York: Harper Collins, 1999)\n\n\u2500\u2500The Sports Encyclopedia: Pro Football, by David Neft and Richard Cohen (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1988)\n\n\u2500\u2500The Official NFL Encyclopedia, by Beau Riffenburgh (New York: New American Library, 1986)\n\n\u2500\u2500The Other League, by Jack Horrigan and Mike Rathet (Chicago: Follett Publishing, 1970)\n\n\u2500\u2500American Football League Official Guide annual books published by The Sporting Newsbetween 1962 and 1969\n\n\u2500\u2500Football Register annual books published by The Sporting News between 1966 and 1970\n\nFor the most part, the information on the players' teams and years of service was simple enough to assemble. There were a few instances of conflicting information on whether or not a player who was listed on a team's roster in a particular year actually played in any games. I resolved those questions as best I could. In keeping with this roster's purpose, I did not include individuals who were named on a team's roster but never played in any AFL games.\n\nAnother unusual case was Morris Stroud. Stroud was drafted by Kansas City in 1969 and spent the season on their taxi squad. Since he did not appear in any regular season games, some sources do not consider him an AFL player. However, he did play in the 1969 AFL championship game, so I did include him as an AFL player.\n\n\n\nEditor's note: Wide receiver Stone Johnson 's name will not be found on the above list. However, the Chiefs retired his number 33, after he died of a spinal cord injury sustained in an exhibition game on August 21, 1963.\n\n\n\nWith regard to colleges: Several players attended more than one college, and a number of others attended a junior college in addition to a four-year college. For simplicity's sake I did not expand the roster to cover multiple colleges; instead I simply listed the \"final\" college out of which each player entered professional football. Fans seeking more extensive biographical information on particular players should consult Total Football II or the annual player register books published byThe Sporting News.\n\nThe most difficult part of the project was the position listings. Several comments are in order regarding particular positions. First, I tried to preserve the distinction between halfbacks and fullbacks wherever possible. Where information from different sources was unclear or conflicting, or where a player was listed as \"HB-FB\" or simply as \u201cRB,\u201d I used \"RB.\"\n\nSecond, all of the sources listed most or all cornerbacks and safeties with the generic \"DB.\" None distinguished consistently between the two positions. As much as I would have preferred to recognize the cornerback and safety positions separately, I was unable to do so for most players and so to be consistent I used \u201cDB\u201d throughout.\n\nThird, pass catchers. In 1960 virtually everyone who played a receiver position was designated simply as an offensive end. As the 1960s progressed, tight end and flanker positions were recognized while the \u201cOE\u201d designation continued to be used for split ends. By 1968 receivers were all either \"TE\" or \"WR\". All of these designations are incorporated in the roster, but please be aware that there is some fuzziness among them due to the evolution of the positions during these years.\n\nA final note on positions concerns special teams. Among the sources I found relatively few designations of placekickers, punters or kick returners, particularly in the league's early years. Most of the players who assumed those roles were listed only by their offensive or defensive positions, even though for many of them their most significant contributions were on special teams. To rectify this, I reviewed the league\u2019s annual and ten-year statistics and added to the roster a \"K,\" \"P,\" or \"KR\" designation for players who performed a significant share of their teams' placekicking, punting or kick returning at some point in their careers. Between the existing designations and my additions, the roster recognizes a total of 30 placekickers, 30 punters and 34 kick returners.\n\nI am not an expert football historian and cannot claim any first-hand experience with the AFL, so I certainly do not consider this roster to be definitive or set in stone. It is very much a work in progress. Any reliable information that improves upon its contents would be welcomed.\n\nAlbert Klumpp\n\nnospam.aklumpp@mwe.com"}, {"url": "http://www.remembertheafl.com/AFLAnnouncers.htm", "page_content": "CURT GOWDY had an illustrious career as a sports broadcaster, but his finest comment was not known to many fans. He made it near the end of the third AFL-NFL World Championship game, when the Jets were whipping the NFL's over-rated champions, the Baltimore Colts. If you can find a copy of that telecast's NBC-TV 'network feed', which stayed on the air during commercial breaks, you can hear Gowdy asking: \"I wonder if that son-of-a-bitch Tex Maule is watching?\" A member of the\n\nAmerican Football League\n\nHall of Fame CHARLIE JONES spent 38 years as a Professional Football announcer and play-by-play man, and was one of ABC's original AFL voices in 1960. He covered the Dallas Texans on radio and is shown at left in a image from a 1961 team photo from Dale Stram, son of Hall of Famer Hank Stram. In his first TV assignment, Jones called the play-by-play the first AFL game ever broadcast, on ABC-TV. Jones followed the AFL to NBC-TV in 1965, and covered all ten years of the league's existence. A member of the\n\nAmerican Football League\n\nHall of Fame GEORGE RATTERMAN learned about Professional Football with the Buffalo Bills, as a quarterback in the All America Football Conference, and then under Paul Brown as Otto Graham's able backup. He started in TV in 1960 with the inception of the American Football League. . Ratterman was a 10-year AFL television broadcaster on ABC-TV and NBC-TV. He was teamed regularly with Jack Buck, Jim Simpson or Charlie Jones. He worked Super Bowls I and III and several AFL championship games on TV and radio PAUL CHRISTMAN was a two-time All-American quarterback at the University of Missouri, elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1956, whose #44 is retired by the university. He played Pro Football six years as part of the Cardinals' \"million-dollar backfield.\" With Curt Gowdy, he broadcast AFL games from the league's inception through 1967, first with ABC, then with NBC's \"full color network.\" He was color commentator for the first eight AFL title games before leaving NBC for CBS in 1968. He was the first modern football analyst on television, providing detailed commentary of the game as it unfolded, not simply announcing what the viewers could see.\n\nChristman's pioneering work was not emulated by the other league until the mid-1960s.

These lists were compiled from information provided by AFL fans, players and officials or their families, and in some cases from my own memory and research.\n\n\n\nI apologize for being behind on these records, but I'll add them as soon as I'm able. AFL fan David Coleman has started a page on the site Find A Grave, that will eventually list the final resting place of all deceased AFLers. See it at http://bit.ly/GravesAFL Players are listed by team, with the player's position, years of service for the team while in the AFL (1960-1969), and (where known) the date of of the individual's passing. Men who served with more than one team are listed multiple times. Members of the American Football League Hall of Fame, or other notables, are linked to pages elsewhere on this site. Deceased former head coaches, owners or contributors to the history of the AFL are also shown. Players' active years are from The Other League by Jack Horrigan and Mike Rathet. Three players died of injuries sustained on the field of play. Howard Glenn , an offensive tackle, died of a spinal cord injury in the Titans' 27-21 loss to Houston at Jeppesen Field on October 9, 1960. Read a 2010 story about Howard Glenn HERE. Chiefs' running back Mack Lee Hill injured a knee in the Chiefs' 34-25 loss to the Bills on December 12, 1965 and died on the operating table, reportedly of heat stroke, on December 14, 1965, in Kansas City. Although wide receiver Stone Johnson was never on an active AFL roster, the Chiefs retired his number 33, after he died of a spinal cord injury sustained in an exhibition game on August 21, 1963.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Ralph Anderson , a wide receiver with the Los Angeles Chargers, died of a diabetic reaction on November 26, 1960, the day before the Chargers' 52-28 thumping of the Raiders at the LA Coliseum.
