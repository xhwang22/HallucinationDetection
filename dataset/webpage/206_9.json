Both as a person and as a driver, he very much contributes to our team's goals and objectives. He is fast and a pleasure to work with. And, having won the FIA championship in a Ferrari 550 last year, he of course brings a lot of highly relevant experience to the team.\"\n\n27-year old Biagi from Bologna (Italy) is equally pleased: \"I am delighted to race with the Barron Connor team this year. I very much like John and his people, who make me feel very welcome. They are very serious about achieving their ambitions. The team is extremely professional, with highly skilled people and phenomenal facilities. I am happy to be partnering John, the reigning FIA Sportscar champion, and Danny, who is of course highly experienced. For me, to race the new Ferrari 575 GTC in the most prestigious sports car races, is exiting as well as an honour.

Biagi, who drives a BMW M3 for BMW Team Italy (ROAL Motorsport), finished third and fifth in the two races to secure the Italian title.\n\nThe first of the two races at Vallelunga was won by multiple touring car champion Fabrizio Giovanardi in the impressive Porsche Panamera, run by N.Technology. The second race was won by Audi Sport Italia driver Alberto Cola. Having entered the weekend leading the standings, Biagi's results ensured he would beat Mercedes drivers Max Pigoli and Luigi Ferrara to the title.\n\n34-year-old Biagi won two of the sixteen races that made up the Italian Superstars Championship for 2010, also taking a pole position and five fastest laps. The Vallelunga races also counted towards the International Superstars Series, which concludes at Kyalami in South Africa on 28 November. Biagi leads the International standings too, followed by Pigoli and Ferrara again.\n\n2010 is Biagi's first year competing in the Superstars Series. The Italian has traditionally competed in GT racing, winning the FIA GT Championship in 2003 and 2007. At the end of the weekend, Biagi said: \u201cThis is a dream come true for me. This championship was new territory for me, and the car was obviously very different to drive compared to those I am familiar with from GT1 and LMP2. I found my feet quickly, however, and was competitive from the word go. BMW Team Italy has worked very hard since the winter tests. Everyone in the team contributed to this success. Roberto Ravaglia, who I always admired as a driver, also played a key role. He is also an outstanding team principal. Our focus now turns to the final in Kyalami, where there is another title up for grabs.\u201d\n\nRavaglia said: \u201cThis victory is one of the two objectives we set at the beginning of the year. We are also in a very promising position in the international series. With just one round to go, we are close to ending the season with the best possible result.\u201d\n\nUmberto Grano, Sporting Activities Manager at BMW Italy, added: \u201cWe can be extremely satisfied. BMW Italy believed in the growth of the Superstars Series. The fact that there were well over 20,000 fans again in Vallelunga is a just reward for the work put in by the organisers. Thomas Biagi\u2019s title and his consistent lead in the international series just go to prove the ability of ROAL Motorsport to develop awinning car.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/thomas.biagi/1847841", "page_content": "Thomas Biagi\n\nracecar driver\n\nMarch 7, 1976 Bologna, Province of Bologna, Italy\n\nBiagi started his career in single seaters, driving in Formula Alfa Boxer and Italian Formula Three Championship, where he was 5th best in 1995, with two wins.

Backed by BMW, his team in 2001 entered the FIA European Super Production with two BMW 320i cars, driven by Peter Kox and Norman Simon. The start was excellent after Kox became a champion while Simon won the title in the Under 23 class.\n\nAfter a blistering start, the new team in 2002 entered the FIA European Touring Car Championship under the name BMW Team Spain with Jordi Gene and Fabrizio de Simone as drivers. The results weren\u2019t glorious after only one podium finish was scored. In the following season, Fabrizio Giovanardi and Antonio Garcia were behind the wheels of two BMW 320is. The results were something better. A total of seven podium finishes were scored before Garcia and Giovanardi finished 8th and 9th respectively. Interestingly, Alessandro Zanardi made his comeback to racing after a horrible crash in 2001 when he lost both legs. Driving the ROAL Motorsport\u2019s specially modified BMW in the final race of the season at Monza, Zanardi finished 7th.\n\nIn 2004 Zanardi was teamed with Garcia but the team again failed to score a maiden victory in the ETCC. After scoring three podiums, Spanish driver took the 7th place in the Drivers\u2019 championship, while the Italian driver was 15th overall.\n\nZanardi scored maiden victory for ROAL Motorsport\n\nSince 2005, the team is competing under its current name \u2013 ROAL Motorsport. The ETCC became World Touring Cars Championship and those changes were lucky for the team. Alex Zanardi at Oschersleben scored a maiden victory in the series and Garcia also drove in fine form during the season. Zanardi also won the title in the Italian Super Touring Cars Championship, bringing the first trophy in the team\u2019s showcase. Alex also finished 3rd in the first edition of the European Touring Car Cup.\n\nZanardi stayed with the team in 2006, while Marcel Costa and Duncan Huisman shared the second driver seat of new BMW 320si. Italian driver won in Istanbul and scored two more podiums before finishing 11th in the standings. In the following year, Felix Porteiro was teamed with Zanardi and Spanish driver did relatively well in his first year. He won the race at Automotodrom Brno and finished 12th in the Drivers\u2019 championship, while Zanardi somewhat underachieved and with only one podium finished dropped to the 15th position in overall standings.\n\nBrno was the lucky circuit\n\nBoth drivers remained with ROAL Motorsport in 2008 and at Automotodrom Brno they scored maiden 1-2 finish for the team in the WTCC race, with Zanardi as a winner. The Italian driver almost scored double that day but finished 2nd in the main race, narrowly losing to his compatriot Gabriele Tarquini. Porteiro later in the season triumphed at Oschersleben and took the 10th place in the championship, while Zanardi was 13th.\n\nThe same year ROAL Motorsport developed the BMW M3 for the Superstars Series and Italian driver Luca Rangoni scored a victory in his first race. In the following year, Gianni Morbidelli won the title in the Superstars International Series driving the BMW M3 sedan prepared by ROAL Motorsport.\n\nIn 2009 WTCC Zanardi drove alongside Sergio Hernandez. They won both races at Brno and, interestingly, those were the only podiums scored by the team that year. Hernandez and Zanardi finished 11th and 12th in the final standings respectively.\n\nA short break and return to the WTCC\n\nROAL Motorsport left the FIA World Touring Car Championship in 2010 and focused solely to Superstars Series with the new BMW M3 coupe. That was the very fruitful season for the team after Thomas Biagi won both Italian and International Superstars Series titles, scoring a total of six wins for ROAL Motorsport.\n\nIn 2011, Italian team returned to WTCC with the new BMW 320 TC and Tom Coronel as a driver. The experienced Dutch driver won the race at Suzuka and scored other four podiums before finishing 4th in the Drivers\u2019 Championship. Alberto Cerqui became the champion in the Superstars Italian Series at the wheel of the BMW M3.\n\nCoronel in 2012 failed to score a victory in the WTCC but still had a good campaign and had five podium finishes before taking the 5th place overall, while Alberto Cerqui was 8th in the Yokohama Drivers\u2019 Trophy. At the same time, ROAL Motorsport entered the Italian GT Championship with the BMW Z4 GT3. Thomas Biagi and Stefano Colombo claimed the title, amassing a total of five wins and the same number of pole positions for the team. ROAL Motorsport won the Teams\u2019 title in 2013 Italian GT Championship, having an all-Italian driver line-up of Michela Cerruti, Stefano Colombo, and Stefano Comandini.\n\nROAL Motorsport won 2014 Yokohama Teams\u2019 Trophy\n\nThe season in the WTCC also was fine. Coronel won the races in Slovakia and Japan before taking the 10th place in the final classification, while Darryl O\u2019Young was 6th in the Yokohama Drivers\u2019 Trophy. ROAL Motorsport finished 5th in the Teams\u2019 Trophy that year.\n\nThe season of 2014 was one of the best so far. ROAL Motorsport lost BMW factory backing in the WTCC and switched to Chevrolet to compete in the Independent entries championship with Tom Coronel and Tom Chilton as drivers. British driver scored the only victory for the team in Beijing but thanks to many strong finishes of both drivers ROAL Motorsport won the Yokohama Teams\u2019 Trophy.\n\nBlancpain GT Series was a new challenge\n\nRoberto Ravaglia\u2019s squad will enter a specially modified 2014-specificated BMW Z4 GT3 for former ChampCar-champion and Paralympic gold medalist Alex Zanardi for the Blancpain Sprint Series. He finished 20th in the standings, while the second car driven by David Fumanelli and Stefano Colombo was runner-up in Silver Cup. Finally, ROAL Motorsport was 10th in the Blancpain GT Series Teams\u2019 Championship.\n\nThe same year ROAL Motorsport also entered the Blancpain Endurance Series and won the Pro-Am class in the season-opening race at Monza. In the following seasons team continued to race in the Endurance Series but without too much success.\n\nAnother WTCC Trophy was won in 2015\n\nROAL Motorsport left Blancpain GT Series in 2015 but continued in the WTCC and defended its Yokohama Teams\u2019 Trophy title. Coronel and Chilton again were behind the wheel of two Chevrolets and even being unable to score a race win, they were in the consistent form over the season. At the same time, Chilton was 3rd in the Yokohama Drivers\u2019 Trophy standings.\n\nIn 2016, the team reduced its presence in the WTCC to one car with Coronel as a driver. Dutch veteran surprised many by winning in two races, in Morocco and Portugal, and finishing 3rd in the WTCC Trophy standings. At the same time, ROAL Motorsport was the vice-champion in the WTCC Teams\u2019 Trophy."}]}
