He played an important role in the life of the community before the Dissolution of the Monasteries.\n\nConsidered to be a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Thomas Cromwell, Holgate was appointed president of the Council in the North in 1538, a post he held for 11 years. He lived in the house of the former abbot of St Mary\u2019s Abbey in York, which has survived as King\u2019s Manor.\n\nFollowing the death of Archbishop Lee in September 1544, Holgate was named his successor and was consecrated as Archbishop of York at Lambeth in January 1545, renouncing papal authority.\n\nFrom then, the tenets of Protestant theology were regularly expounded in the Minster for the first time, and organ music was abolished. He instructed that the Minster Library be furnished with new Protestant commentaries on the Bible by theologians like Calvin.\n\nArchbishop Holgate founded three grammar schools in 1546, one at his birthplace of Hemsworth in the West Riding, one at Old Malton and one in York. He required his headmasters to be skilled in Hebrew, Greek and Latin and to take his pupils to the Minster on Sundays.\n\nIn order to prove his Protestantism to the sceptical Duke of Northumberland, in 1550, aged 68, the Archbishop took a bride when he was 68 \u2013 local gentlewoman Barbara Wentworth. This was a year after an Act of Parliament removed the duty of celibacy from the English clergy.\n\nBut when Queen Mary came to the throne in 1553 and returned England to Catholicism, Holgate was sent to the Tower then stripped of his post for breaking his vow of celibacy.\n\nHaving paid the crown \u00a31,000 for his \u2018crimes\u2019 Holgate was set free in January 1555 only to die that November in London."}, {"url": "https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192802903.001.0001/acref-9780192802903-e-3295", "page_content": "Note on the Revision of the Third Edition\n\nAbp. of *York.

But back in Tudor times it wasn't the done thing for a priest who had taken a vow of chastity to suddenly decide to get married.\n\nRobert Holgate wasn't just any priest: he was the Archbishop of York and President of the King's Council in the North. When he married in 1550, at the age of 68, it caused quite a scandal - particularly in conservative northern Church circles.\n\nHe got away with it during the reign of the young, and Protestant, King Edward VI, Henry VIII's son. But when Edward died at the age of 15 in 1553 and his Catholic sister Mary succeeded him, Robert quickly found himself in hot water.\n\nHe was imprisoned in the Tower of London for 'divers offences' - most notably getting married after having taken a vow of chastity.\n\nStripped of all his offices, he apologised to the Queen, and was eventually released in 1555 on payment of a huge fine. It did him little good - he died ten months later, clearly a broken man.\n\nRobert's career was typical of many statesmen in Tudor times. Like Cardinal Wolsey, he rose to dizzying heights, only to fall quickly from grace when he offended the ruling monarch.\n\nHis name survives in York, however, because of something he did while at the height of his power in York.\n\nHolgate had bought the Treasurer's House and other property in Minster Close.\n\nIn 1546, he founded three schools - one in York, one in Hemsworth, and one in Old Malton. The York school was in Ogleforth 'close by the cathedral' and, like other early grammar schools in England, was intended to train students for the church. The curriculum included Latin, Greek and Hebrew with some history, geography and maths but with the emphasis firmly on religious and moral education. Discipline is said to have been severe - as it was for poor Archbishop Robert himself once Queen Mary came to the throne.\n\nThe school survived the Archbishop's fall from grace, however. More than 200 years after his death, an advert in the York Courant in December 1799 stated that: \"The Free Grammar School situate within the Close of the Cathedral Church of York founded by Archbishop Holgate for the Instruction of Youth ... will open again after the Christmas recess on Monday, January 20, 1800.\"\n\nLike other grammar schools Archbishop Holgate's struggled for pupils in the early 1800s: it had just 10 in 1818, and 17 in 1824.\n\nThen, in 1845-6, the York Diocesan School Society built a new training college (St John's College) on Lord Mayor's Walk. A new school, the Yeoman School, was built next door. Opened in 1846 this was intended to cater for the 'middle class children' of agriculturalists, as well as to provide teaching practice for student teachers at St John's.\n\nThe new school ran into financial difficulties, however, and in 1858, after 300 years in Ogleforth, Archbishop Holgate's School took it over.\n\nThe iron gates to the school's playing fields seem to have been designed between 1850 and 1860 by George Townsend Andrews, the architect who had designed St John's College itself. They were made by the Walmgate-based Walker Iron Foundry, which also made railings and gates for the British Museum, as well as others across York, including in St Leonard's Place, York Cemetery, Dean's Park and at St Peter's School.\n\nArchbishop Holgate's School thrived in its new location in Lord Mayor's Walk. By 1915, when the Rev William Johnson retired as headmaster, the school had 294 pupils.\n\nBy then, the school had leased part of Bootham Stray for playing fields, which is why the school playing field gates - which were restored in 2017 by York Civic Trust working with York Hospital - are there to this day.\n\nThe school itself moved to its present site on Hull Road in 1963.\n\nStephen Lewis\n\nFor the stories behind more York Civic Trust plaques, visit yorkcivictrust.co.uk"}, {"url": "https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/history", "page_content": "1209 Groups of scholars congregate at the ancient Roman trading post of Cambridge for the purpose of study, the earliest record of the University.\n\n1284 Peterhouse, the first college at Cambridge, is founded by the Bishop of Ely.\n\n1347 Mary, Countess of Pembroke, founds Pembroke College.\n\n1446 Henry VI, founder of Eton and of King's College, Cambridge, lays the first stone of King's College Chapel.\n\n1473 Robert Woodlark founds St Catharine\u2019s College.\n\n1503 Thomas Cranmer, aged 14, enters the newly-endowed Jesus College.\n\n1511 Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII, founds St John's College.\n\n1516 Erasmus, Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at Cambridge, works on his translation of the Greek New Testament and on textbooks which were to become the staple of the 'new learning'.

He recognised Henry VIII as head of the Church of England.\n\nAlthough a protege of Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, Holgate had a career in the Gilbertine Order of which he became master. He was briefly Prior of Watton until the priory was dissolved in 1539. Most of the Gilbertine houses were lesser establishments which should have been dissolved under the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535 (only four out of twenty-six houses had revenues over \u00a3200 a year). However, Holgate is credited with using his influence to save them for a few years. For example, Malton Priory, one of the lesser Gilbertine houses, was the last of them to surrender in December 1539, whereas Sempringham Priory, worth more than \u00a3200 a year, surrendered in 1538.\n\nHolgate was consecrated as Bishop of Llandaff on 25 March 1537. He translated to York on 16 January 1545. At York in 1546, he founded a school, now called Archbishop Holgate's School.\n\nHe was President of the Council of the North from 1538.\n\nIn 1550 Holgate married Barbara Wentworth, who was about 25 at the time. This might, however have been a second wedding to make it fully legal, and Holgate and Wentworth might have first married in late 1547 with Roger Tongue officiating. In 1551 Anthony Norman claimed that he was already married to Barbara Wentworth, but the courts decided that their marriage when she was about seven had not been a binding legal transaction. Robert and Barbara remained married until 1553, when shortly after Mary I of England came to the throne. She imprisoned Holgate on various charges, with his being a married cleric being central to these. In 1554 Holgate renounced his marriage claiming he had only entered it to avoid suspicion as a papist. In January 1555 Holgate was released from prison, but he was not restored to priestly office. He died later that year.\n\nIn 1558 a Robert Holgate from Yorkshire entered the University of Cambridge. He may have been a son of Holgate, since there are some claims he had two children by Barbara, but there is no conclusive evidence on the matter.\n\nReferences\n\nThis article contains public domain text from William Page's Houses of the Gilbertine order: The priory of Sempringham, A History of the County of Lincoln: Volume 2 (1906)"}, {"url": "https://maltonians.maltonschool.org/people/holgate.php", "page_content": "Illustrated here is the church at Darrington, near Pontefract.

The venue was appropriate since the gathering followed up on a tradition whereby Old Boy Fellows of Oxford and: Cambridge colleges offered hospitality and help to members of the School during their undergraduate days ( Frank Woodward was himself a Mathematical Fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge ).\n\nThe decision of that February meeting was \"to form a London Association of Old Boys of Archbishop Holgate's School affiliated to the Association in York\" with the principal aims of \"facilitating re-union gatherings and social intercourse for its members\"; also \"to help all boys, past and present, of the school\" and \" to take steps, wherever possible, to enhance the reputation of the ancient school and to foster its traditions\".\n\nColonel E A Loftus (school 1897 -1903) was elected Chairman; Frank Woodward was Honorary Treasurer and Harry Ward ( 1904 -1914) became Honorary Secretary.\n\nReunion Dinners.\n\nThe first reunion dinner was held at the Waldorf Hotel, Aldwych, WC2 on 14 May 1947. The cost was 16 shillings (80p); this was quite expensive when one considers that, during the war, the charge for any meal was limited to 5 shillings (25p). It was agreed to charge a membership fee, per annum, of one guinea (\u00a3 1.05) for those aged 25 and over, with a reduced fee of half a guinea (52.5p) for those under 25. It has pointed out that Old Boys could become Life Members of the York Association at a cost of \u00a34; this sum included receipt of \"The Mitre\" free of charge for the rest of one's life!\n\nFrom the earliest times, much emphasis was given to the third of the above objectives (\"taking steps, wherever possible, to enhance the reputation of the school ...\"). This applied particularly to gathering information relating to our Founder - a seemingly endless task, which I enjoy doing to this day.\n\nBy the Autumn of 1947, Sir Gerald Woolston, Norroy and Ulster King of Arms and formerly Garter Principal King of Arms, had prepared, at the request of the Society, a sketch of the Archbishop's armorial bearings. A replica in oak was prepared and presented by the President to the Society.\n\nThe other objectives were forwarded by arranging to complete a list of Old Boys willing to offer hospitality to boys \"newly coming to London\" and to forward the list to the Headmaster. The Society decided upon affiliation with the Society of Yorkshiremen in London, especially because so many Old Boys were the recipients of Scholarships founded by that Society.\n\nA pattern of two reunion dinners per year (spring and autumn) was agreed upon; most of these were held at Brown's Hotel, Dover Street (at least until 1963). Accompanying each dinner was a beautifully-produced menu card, the work of Frank Woodward (by now our Honorary Archivist). Collectively they comprise valuable historical material relating back to the early days of the school and to its Founder. The considerable effort involved was finally well-rewarded, since they formed a significant part of the material available to E N Jewels when he agreed to prepare a \"History of Archbishop Holgate's Grammar School, York\" published as a book in 1962 (and thus beyond the scope of my remit).\n\nThe pattern of two dinners per year was unexpectedly interrupted almost as soon as it began. We had planned our most important reunion so far, with significant progress to report, and with the Archbishop of York as our chief guest and speaker. The meeting was to be held at Brown's Hotel as usual, on 26 November 1948. At the last minute, the Archbishop's secretary discovered that the Archbishop Holgate Society held its meetings in London and not in York - so the Archbishop had to withdraw and the meeting was cancelled! Since that time I do not think that we have ever had the pleasure of receiving an Archbishop (as Chairman of Governors) at a London meeting ( I hope to hear that this was not the case). This was the only time a reunion was cancelled in the early years - and we made up for it by holding three meetings in 1949.\n\nThe reunion held on 12 January 1949 was the first occasion on which a committee meeting was held on the same evening and at the same place as the dinner itself; the arrangement proved popular and has continued more or less ever Since.\n\nThe Holgate Portrait\n\nThe only known portrait of our Founder belongs to the Holgate Hospital at Hemsworth (founded under the terms of Robert Holgate's will); it hangs in the Governor's Room at the hospital. The Society arranged for Eric Westbrook, Principal of the Wakefield School of Art, to make a copy and this was on show for the first time at the meeting on 12 January 1949. It was subsequently handed over, on \"permanent loan\", at a ceremony held at the School on 18 February 1949.\n\nThis dinner also witnessed the introduction of the first of a series of post-prandial discussions. The topic was \"CRIME\",introduced by Harry Ward who had himself lived in an English prison for two years and had studied the prison systems of several countries. The conclusion was \"that the present crime wave is likely to grow for a while and then die down again to the astonishing orderliness which characterised us before the war\"\n\nThe November 1949 reunion was an important one for the Society and the School. Our guest speaker was Rt. Hon. J Bowes Morrell, Lord Mayor of York. His speech mainly concerned proposals and arrangements for York's celebration of the forthcoming 1951 Festival of Britain. He also announced that consideration was being given to the establishment of a new (or second) University in York. Alderman Morrell played a leading part in the successful launch of the University at Heslington in mid-1963, a few weeks before our own new school was opened on adjacent land. The Alderman's name is commemorated by the University's main library; The J B Morrell Library. The Archbishop Holgate Society was active in a number of ways in assisting the start-up of both the University and the new school - but this is a story too long to detail here."}]}
