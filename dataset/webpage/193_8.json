Sylvain developed this system during the season, showing that he is a sensitive tester and, also, able to understand this new technology. And, in addition, he also confirmed he is a fast and talented rider. There\u2019s no doubt that Sylvain is ready to step up to a higher series.

Having had no time to test before the first round at Aragon, the Frenchman was playing catch-up all weekend.\n\nHis prospects of a strong first showing aboard the new R1 weren't helped by a heavy spill on Saturday morning which required a subsequent hospital visit. Yet the 26-year old still managed a gritty eleventh place finish on Sunday while riding with several cracked ribs.\n\nBarrier spoke to Crash.net on Saturday evening at Aragon about his split with BMW, the potential for a Superbike return in 2016, and his new role as Michelin test rider.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nAfter losing your ride with BMW you've ended up back in the series you've won twice. Was it your first choice to return to the European Superstock 1000 class?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nI was looking honestly everywhere. BSB, IDM, everywhere. But I wanted to stay in the paddock of Superbike. I call every team in the paddock but everything was taken. There was quite some people who wanted to have me. The thing is I don't want to wait for a rider to crash, get injured and take his ride. For me it's not really correct. I prefer to go back to where I was. I'm doing some development for Michelin for the MotoGP. I'm in the Italian series with the same team. They give me the chance to maybe come into Superbike next year. But they say I need to fight. If everything come easy it's not my way to do things.\n\nYamaha gave me the chance to come back. Now it's in my side to give everything to show them and show me what I'm able to do. Also if one day I have children I can tell them what we need to do. I don't want to sit on the sofa when I'm 50 years old and say, 'Oh, if I did this I could be world champion.' No, [I have to] give everything and after show my children how to do it and how to be a better person.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nAre you still upset with BMW's decision?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nHonestly I think I can be a better person. When you stay for five years with the same team you don't feel lazy. You think, 'Ok, I'm here and everything is good.' But when this happens it gives you the feeling in the heart to battle. For sure this what they did was not the correct way to do things but it will help me to become a better person.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nDid you foresee the split with BMW?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nFrom the beginning of the year I was always saying the two first races will be quite difficult because Phillip Island I don't really like the circuit. After Thailand I didn't know the circuit. The first race was a complete disaster. In the second race I begin to enjoy on the bike. I was enjoying the qualifying. In the race I didn't have the good feeling to really push. The bike was quite good and I need to over-push. I wasn't feeling the confidence to do it. I thought, 'take this race easy, then in Aragon battle.' The bike is good and I wanted to battle. The team said, 'See you in Aragon.'\n\nBut when we come back from Thailand they didn't call me to tell me that. They called my manager and they say this to him. I am going out with my manager's daughter. He called his daughter and asked, 'Is Sylvain not professional?' But everything was fine. We understand the [ex-BMW WSBK] manager Andrea Dosoli go away and a new one comes. Also they say from the car accident last year, when I was not in contract with BMW at this moment, that it was bad for the image of BMW. We come back and finish some races second and third. Ok, I maybe was not battling with [David] Salom but I was in front of him in many race. I don't know exactly what happened. Maybe [Ayrton] Badovini is Italian, it is BMW Italia. I don't blame anyone. Just the way they did it is not really professional. They do it all [behind] the back and this is not really nice after five years.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nYou stood by BMW when they didn't provide you with a Superbike after your first Superstock 1000 title. Does that make their decision more difficult to accept?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nThe deal was you win the championship you go to Superbike [in 2012]. I win the championship and they take Davies and Melandri [for the 2013 season]. What is the plan? 'You go back to Superstock.' And after you will get a Superbike in a professional team. I was like perfect. I will do again. After two race or three race BMW take the decision to stop everything. I thought, 'For fuck sake!' I sign again for this for 'Evo'. We do 'Evo' and it was not what I expect. If this happen in your life it's for a reason. You need to take the best and try to grow up. It's what I do now. If I come back from now I will be much stronger and it will be much better for me.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nWhat are your first impressions of the new Yamaha R1?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nIt's completely a new bike and we didn't make any tests before we come here. On Monday I was under contract with BMW. We make all this at the last minute. We need to learn to the bike. Yesterday was a good day but we make the lap time with the new tyres. We didn't do anything else. We just put the new tyres and then try to understand the handling of the bike. The lap time was coming easy. This means the potential of the bike is really high. The bike is standard. It's Stock from the shop. We have the suspension. The session is really good. This morning I go with the tyres from the day before. I do three laps and come back in but the last thing I use for the second practice yesterday. We changed the spring on the bike. When I changed direction in the middle of the corner then the front is straight away go away because the track is a little bit cold. We only have four tyres all weekend. So it's difficult to imagine all that.\n\nAlso I was a little bit too aggressive. It's the game. But from the first time we get on the bike after two days we have one second free on people that are doing this for three months. It's not really bad. It means the bike is quite easy to ride straight away. We just need to understand more the bike.\n\nNow she's [the bike] the boss. I'm like 'ok'. We need to find a couple of things and it will be fine. But we need a little bit more time. The family of Yamaha is really great. Everybody we eat in the same hospitality. Everyone talk to everyone. It's intense competition but it's quite natural. This is quite nice.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nThe chance to race Yamaha's R1 in the World Superbike series next year is a nice incentive...\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nSuperbike was something else. I'm rider official for Michelin to develop the MotoGP tyres. I work with them for many years and they really like the way I speak about the tyres. I'm quite easy to live with and to do all the things. I think I will make a really good job. I don't know where it will bring us but for sure it will be fun.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nThe depth of quality in this class has significantly increased this year. Do you feel it will be harder to regain your title?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nI'm quite happy. Just one thing I think is, 'Why don't they fire me before?' I can make one or two test before this race and be much more stronger. Now I am quite limited but I need to take the race like a practice. This morning I was a little ambition more than talent, like Stoner said. I leaned over, get back the front, I said, 'Come back!' but it didn't listen. It was not good.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nYou suffered a fairly big fall on Saturday morning and were taken to hospital. What happened?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nFor the crash I just lose the front and the bike come on me. We have the security here [on the handlebar] and my glove stay in. It brings me then the bike go up. It does a spin, it come on me and I was made to go to the hospital for checks. I have two ribs cracked. The shoulder is painful and the muscle [in the arm]. Honestly on the bike it's quite hard. But I can ride and this is a good thing."}, {"url": "https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/news-and-views/racing/world-superbikes/2016/february/world-superbike-2016-whos-who-/", "page_content": "Author: Oli Rushby Pics: Gold & Goose Posted: 25 Feb 2016\n\nThe 2016 race season is set to get underway with Round 1 of the 2016 Superbike World Championship in Australia this weekend.\n\nThe upcoming season marks a new era for World Superbikes with the traditional two-race Sunday format being spread across the weekend, with the first race now taking place on Saturday afternoon ahead of the second on Sunday.\n\nIt\u2019s all change on the grid for 2016 too, with Yamaha back plus a whole host of new riders joining the championship. Here\u2019s a quick look at the field and their bikes\u2026\n\nKawasaki Racing Team\n\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Rea #1\n\nTom Sykes #66\n\nBike: ZX-10R\n\nKawasaki\u2019s line-up remains unchanged for 2016 with World Champion Jonathan Rea alongside Kawasaki stalwart Tom Sykes.\n\nHaving dominated the 2016 season, Rea will be keep to take more of the championships he missed out on while riding slower machinery but Sykes might have other ideas. Having been annihilated by his team-mate last year, the Yorkshireman appears to have come out fighting and has shown strong in pre-season testing.\n\nAruba.it Racing Ducati\n\n\n\n\n\nChaz Davies #7\n\nDavide Giugliano #34\n\nBike: Panigale R\n\nJonathan Rea might have cruised to the 2016 title but had Chaz Davies performed in the first half of the season as he did in the second, it might have been a different story. Davies scored more points than any other rider in the second half of last season to secure second spot overall.\n\nIt looked as though there was a huge breakthrough for the Panigale after several years of turmoil. With Kawasaki already looking strong, he\u2019ll have to hit the ground running if he\u2019s to challenge Team Green in 2016.\n\nLast year was a write off for Italian Davide Giugliano. A number of serious injuries, including broken vertebrae, ruled him out for most of the year, which was a shame as he\u2019d been super quick in pre-season testing. He\u2019s a bit of a loose canon, so providing he can stay on the bike he\u2019s sure to be fast and definitely has a point to prove.\n\nHonda World Superbike Team\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael van der Mark #60\n\nNicky Hayden #69\n\nBike: Honda CBR100RR Fireblade SP\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no denying Honda had an awful year last season, but youngster Michael van der Mark did show flashes of speed. Learning year now over, he\u2019ll be looking to step up to the plate in 2016. He\u2019s young, keen and exceedingly quick so if anyone can drag the Honda up the sharp end he stands a good chance.\n\nSo does his team-mate. 2006 MotoGP World Champion Nicky Hayden moves to the production class this year and after two dire years in the open class, Hayden is determined to prove he\u2019s still got what it takes to win races.\n\nBefore writing Honda\u2019s blade off, let\u2019s not forget the miracles Jonathan Rea could perform on the bike before he made his switch to Kawasaki. It was old then too, you know.\n\nAlthea BMW\n\n\n\n\n\nJordi Torres #81\n\nMarkus Reiterberger #21\n\nBike: S1000RR\n\n\n\nJordi Torres impressed once he found his feet in World Superbikes last year. The former Moto2 runner showed he could give WSBK veteran and team-mate Leon Haslam a run for his money. After being shafted by Aprilia, Torres moves to the Althea BMW season for 2016 and has to be a little bit of a dark horse. He might not be a championship contender but there could be a few trophies with his name on by the end of the year.\n\nDespite Markus Reiterberger only being 21 years old, he should have been in the World Superbike Championship before now. The youngster dominated IDM on the BMW S1000RR at the mere age of 18 to become BMW\u2019s golden child, but with their withdrawal from WSB in 2013 he was left to race for another two years in Germany before getting his WSB call-up. He has a lot to learn, but we reckon his name could become a lot more familiar as the season goes on.\n\nPATA Yamaha\n\n\n\n\n\nAlex Lowes #22\n\nSylvain Guintoli #50\n\nBike: YZF-R1\n\nYamaha\u2019s R1 makes its long awaited return to World Superbikes this year and the Crescent team have signed both youth and experience for their 2016 campaign.\n\nAlex Lowes showed flashes of speed on the dated GSX-R1000, but it\u2019s now crunch time for the 2013 British Superbike championship as he\u2019s handed one of the trickest sports bikes on the market. His talent is unquestionable, so if he and the Crescent team can get to grips with the techy R1, he should be quick.\n\nGuintoli is the experience in the team. He\u2019s never been the fastest rider in World Superbikes but he\u2019s by far one of the most consistent. Guintoli will often go unnoticed, but he\u2019s always there fighting for podiums if not race wins. 2015 was but a blip for the Frenchman; make no mistake, he\u2019ll be there or there abouts this year.\n\nBarni Ducati\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXavi Fores #12\n\nBike: Panigale R\n\nSpaniard Xavi Fores has shown in recent years that he has the pace to run well in World Superbikes having substituted for Davide Giugliano last year. His best finish in the series is a fifth place and having shown to be fast in testing, he should fare well with the Barni team.\n\nMilwaukee BMW\n\n\n\nJosh Brookes #27\n\nKarel Abraham #17\n\nBike: S1000RR\n\nNew on the block for 2016 is British Superbike Champions Shaun Muir Racing, who have swapped Yamaha machinery for BMW for their debut on the world stage. Brookes and Abraham are two riders who should be able to hold their own in World Superbikes, but it might take the team a while to find their feet.\n\nIODA Aprilia\n\nAlex De Angelis #15\n\nLorenzo Savadori #23\n\nFormer MotoGP team IODA moves to World Superbikes for 2016 with Aprilia machinery, aboard is Alex De Angelis and 2015 Superstock 1000 champion Lorenzo Savadori.\n\nPedercini Kawasaki\n\n\n\n\n\nSylvain Barrier #20\n\nSaeed Al Sulaiti #11\n\nBike: ZX-10R\n\nBarrier dominated two European Superstock titles before moving to the Superbike championship in 2014. A flurry of injuries put pay to a strong challenge in 2014 and the 2015 season just didn\u2019t get going for the Frenchman who was eventually dropped by the BMW Italia team.\n\nHe\u2019s back for 2016 with the Pedercini team and knows this is one of his last chances to prove he\u2019s got it. He is fast, but whether he\u2019ll show that remains ot be seen.\n\nHe\u2019s joined by Qatari Saeed Al Sulaiti, who steps up from the Qatar Superbike Championship.\n\nMV Agusta Reparto Corse\n\n\n\n\n\nLeon Camier #2\n\nBike: F4RC\n\n\n\nLeon Camier sticks with MV Agusta for the 2016 season for the second of a two year deal. He had some strong top ten finishes last season and he\u2019ll be looking to build on that this year.\n\nTeam GoEleven Kawasaki\n\n\n\n\n\nRoman Ramos #40\n\nBike: ZX-10R\n\nRoman Ramos remains with the GoEleven Kawasaki team this year. He\u2019ll be looking to build on a best finish of seventh place.\n\nGrillini Racing Team\n\n\n\n\n\nDominic Schmitter #9\n\nJosh Hook #16\n\nBike: ZX-10R\n\nGrillini Racing line up two WSBK rookies this season in Dominic Schmitter and Josh Hook.\n\nKawasaki ZX-10R.\n\n\n\nHook, however, won\u2019t be racing in Phillip Island after a crash in testing. He\u2019ll be replaced by rapid young Turkish rider, Topak\n\nTeam Toth Yamaha\n\n\n\n\n\nImre Toth #10\n\nPeter Sebestyen #56\n\n\n\nTeam Toth retain Imre Toth and Peter Sebestyen for 2016 but switch to Yamaha machinery.\n\nVFT Racing\n\n\n\n\n\nFabio Menghi #61\n\nBike: Panigale R\n\nEstablished World Supersport contender Fabio Menghi steps up to the big class in 2016 but will miss Phillip Island after a fall in testing."}, {"url": "https://us.motorsport.com/wsbk/news/ss1000-silverstone-garnier-racing-team-junior-saturday-report/2476105/", "page_content": "BARRIER ON THE FRONT ROW\n\nGood qualification for Sylvain Barrier at Silverstone with the fourth time. He will start tomorrow from the front row with Ayrton Badovini, Maxime Berger and Andrea Antonelli.\n\nSylvain was the fourth fastest of the free practice session in the morning, which was on the wet. Surprisingly enough there was no crash at all, even with 25 very motivated young riders.\n\nDuring the afternoon qualifying session, Barrier went for his fastest lap 7 minutes before the chequered flag. He was 0.1 behind the pole position time at the first intermediate, 0.2 at the second and 0.7 at the third to finish fourth overall at the end, only at 0.1 of the third time.\n\nThe championship leader Ayrton Badovini, also on a BMW S 1000 RR, was the pole position man. He was in front of the Hondas of Maxime Berger and Andrea Antonelli.\n\nThis is the third time this year that Sylvain will start from the front row, after having done so already at Monza and Brno.\n\nMichel Garnier (team owner): \"It was good. We are always happy to be on the front row. The bike is progressing. Everything has been good since the beginning of the weekend and it should be OK tomorrow.\"\n\nSylvain Barrier: \"We are progressing with the set up of the suspension.

Highlighting the grid is an American favorite \u2013 Nicky Hayden. The 2006 MotoGP Champion retired from Grand Prix racing following 2015 MotoGP, and is the only American on the 2016 World SBK grid.\n\nThis year\u2019s grid features 24 riders, including the return of the Yamaha Factory team with riders Sylvain Guintoli (2014 World SBK Champion) and Alex Lowes.\n\nAll of the top five World SBK finishers from last season will also compete. Jonathan Rea, the 2015 WSBK Champion, has made it very clear that he\u2019ll be working hard to claim another title in the coming season. The Kawasaki Racing Team ZX-10R Ninja pilot claimed last year\u2019s title two rounds short of the final race, establishing his point domination early on in the season. He wrapped up the season with 548 points, which was well out of reach of anyone else in the top five.\n\nChaz Davies, the runner up in the World SuperBike Championship of 2015, had an impressive year as well. Winning five races aboard the Ducati 1199 Panigale R, and taking a place on the podium several more times, Davies remains a strong contender into the coming season.\n\nRea\u2019s teammate Tom Sykes claimed third place overall. The 2013 WSBK title holder has been attempting to reclaim that glory ever since and in the downtime, also had a direct hand in influencing the new Kawasaki ZX-10R. In the coming seasons, we expect the battle between Sykes and Rea to be particularly close. Let\u2019s hope we\u2019re right because it\u2019ll make one interesting season.\n\nLeon Haslam is a name that has been gracing World Superbike for many years now. Having a long career while aboard plenty of different bikes over the years, Haslam is an experienced veteran with the numbers to prove it. During the 2015 season, he got on the podium more than a handful of times and claimed a victory during the final round aboard his Aprilia RSV4.\n\nThe other factory Aprilia pilot, Jordi Torres, rounded out the overall top five for the 2015 FIM Superbike World Championship. Torres found himself in the top 10 consistently during his debut WSBK season, getting on the podium three times and claiming a victory during the first race of the final round.\n\n2015 World Superbike Standings:\n\nJonathan Rea, Kawasaki ZX-10R, 548 points Chaz Davies, Ducati 1199 Panigale, 416 Tom Sykes, Kawasaki ZX-10R, 399 Leon Haslam, Aprilia RSV4, 332 Jordi Torres, Aprilia RSV4, 247\n\nFollowing is the provisional entry list for 2016 World Superbike.
