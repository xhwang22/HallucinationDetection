Milsom\u2019s powerful Archibald prize winning portrait portrayed his criminal barrister, Charles Waterstreet.

At the time, he was wielding a tomahawk and under the influence of heroin, ice, and prescription drugs.\n\nBarrister, Charles Waterstreet appeared for Milsom during his trial for armed robbery. According to Nigel, during the court proceedings, his relationship with Waterstreet began to strengthen and he began to trust him. They became friends.

Ingrid Periz\n\n\n\n\n\nNigel Milsom (b. 1975, Albury, l. Newcastle) is a figurative painter of baroque abstractions. Formal contestations within each painting and within each exhibition (light versus dark, motion versus stasis, advantage and disadvantage) slip into more complex and more personal structures. Milsom has had a consistent studio practice over two and a half decades. While at times his paintings have been more provisional in nature, strong painting is his signature indebted to chiaroscuro persuasion and a highly distinctive personal style. Typically white paint figures on black paint ground with the occasional intervention of colour, Milsom\u2019s subjects are constructed energetically via a scaffold of construction lines that begin in ink studies and are left visible in the final work. His bodies are geometric form against a more gestural and more openly brushy sequence of marks. His subjects range widely and function abstractly as entry points to composition and pictorial pragmatics. While focused around an athletics of form, Milsom\u2019s slippages into social dynamics and cultural references are ubiquitous and operate in parallel \u2014 often including veiled music and literary motifs as well as autobiographical chapters.\n\nMilsom has been awarded three of Australia\u2019s most prestigious painting prizes: The Sir John Sulman Prize (2012), The Doug Moran National Portrait Prize (2013) and The Archibald Prize (2015).

And for the Archibald, it\u2019s a dramatic backstory for an exhibition prize that is sometimes accused of being less than the sum of its parts.\n\nThe award was announced at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney by Guido Belgiorno-Nettis, president of the gallery\u2019s board, to the heaving media throng who routinely report for duty on the biggest day in the Australian art calendar.\n\nMilsom\u2019s story is the stuff of TV drama itself. He was considered one of Australian art\u2019s most promising talents before depression, drug addiction and the death of several close friends derailed his career soon after he won the Sulman prize, sister award to the Archibald, in 2012.\n\nHigh on heroin, ice and prescription drugs, Milsom was involved in the hold-up of a 7/11 store in the Sydney suburb of Glebe with his drug dealer James Simon. At trial, the artist pleaded guilty to aggravated armed robbery, and was sentenced to six years, with a minimum jail period of two years and six months. Simon was given six years too.\n\nHe put his head on the chopping block and restored my faith in the legal system Nigel Milsom\n\nWhile inside, Milsom picked up Australia\u2019s other big portrait prize, the Moran, though not in person \u2013 his girlfriend and art dealer spoke on his behalf. The artist\u2019s sentence was later reduced by the NSW court of criminal appeal, in no small part due to Waterhouse\u2019s defence.\n\n\u201cHe basically put his hand up and said that he\u2019d help me, that he\u2019d help sort out the mess that I found myself in and that\u2019s what he did,\u201d said Milsom, who was released from Cessnock correctional centre after 12 months and showed his first exhibition after prison at Juniper Hall in Paddington in April.\n\n\u201cHe put his head on the chopping block and restored my faith in the legal system.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn Milsom\u2019s portrait, which took just a week to paint but three years to conceive, Waterstreet is rendered in Goya-esque shades of black, white and blue. In life, the lawyer is a colourful character whose quick thinking and faster living have given actor Richard Roxburgh, as his fictional alter ego Cleaver Greene, plenty to play with.\n\n\u201cCharlie is a very complex person,\u201d wrote Milsom in his supporting statement for his painting. \u201cHe isn\u2019t just a law man. He\u2019s a writer, a social environmentalist and he is involved in film, photography and theatre, too. Despite personal struggles with his own demons over the years, he has managed to dedicate most of his time to the welfare of others.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy portrait is an attempt to depict him a giant, part-man, part-mythical creature with hands that appear otherworldly, as though the anatomy of his hands has been designed to grasp unnatural disasters naturally.\u201d\n\nAlso announced on Friday were the $50,000 Wynne landscape prize and $40,000 Sulman prize for genre painting. The former went to Natasha Bieniek for her work Biophilia, an intricate painting of St Kilda botanical gardens, inspired by iPhone photos and at just a few inches square, not much bigger than one.\n\nThe Sulman went to Chinese-Australian artist Jason Phu for his piece, I Was At Yum Cha When In Rolled The Three Severed Heads of Buddha: Fear, Malice and Death.\n\nThe Young Archies, for child and teenage artists, will be announced on 22 July."}, {"url": "https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/artsets/9t7vre", "page_content": "In The art that made me, artists discuss works in the Art Gallery of NSW collection that either inspire, influence or simply delight them. This selection by Nigel Milsom first appeared in Look \u2013 the Gallery\u2019s members magazine.\n\nNigel Milsom knows the Art Gallery of NSW collection well, having worked as a Gallery Services Officer in the 2000s. 'I spent four years as a GSO there and raced home to paint every day,' he says. 'I saw it as another part of my art education. I even used to paint there. I\u2019d go downstairs to the painting workshop and do text pieces and stuff.'\n\nIt didn\u2019t always endear him to his bosses, he confesses, but his dedication to his art eventually paid off, despite personal battles that culminated in a prison term in 2013. In 2012 he won the Sulman Prize, in 2013 the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize and last year he returned to the AGNSW as the winner of the Archibald Prize. When Look visited Milsom\u2019s Newcastle studio, the artist was preparing for an upcoming solo exhibition of painting, video and sculpture.\n\n'You can\u2019t let things like an Archibald define you,' he recently told the Newcastle Herald.

This year\u2019s prize exhibitions are an indication that they are all having a lot of fun.\n\nThe guide to winning\n\nThe choice of winner for the Archibald, Nigel Milsom\u2019s Judo House Part 6 (The White Bird) \u2013 main image \u2013 is a portrait of the showman barrister, Charles Waterstreet was widely predicted, as was the runner-up Mitch Cairns\u2019 angular portrait of artist Peter Powditch. There were several reasons for this.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nFirst, the Archibald is \u2013 in essence \u2013 not an art prize but a celebration of the personalities who define Australia, and especially Sydney. Waterstreet, the flamboyant inspiration for the ABC television series Rake, has to be a front runner on those grounds alone.\n\nIn addition, Milsom was the winner of the 2013 Moran Prize \u2013 and a convicted criminal \u2013 all of which makes good copy. The Archibald is, above all things, about media coverage.\n\nThe other guide to the winner comes from the hanging. In the 1950s and 60s the Gallery director, Hal Missingham, used to write the telegrams for the winner before the judging. The Trustees were furious with him, but he had their measure.\n\nFor the 33 years of Edmund Capon\u2019s directorship it became very easy to work out which work was most likely to win. For well over a week before the final judging, the winner would be hanging in the central court on one of the long walls \u2013 either opposite where the announcement would be made, or adjacent to it.\n\nThe Director always chose the location.\n\nUnder the terms of JF Archibald\u2019s will, the prize must be judged by the Trustees. Since the rise of curators and professional gallery directors, only a few trustees are artists, but the current crop include some extremely knowledgeable collectors and art patrons.\n\nThe lighter and livelier exhibition is a reflection of their broad understanding that the Archibald exists to celebrate portraiture and people, not to elevate the status of the artists.\n\n\u00a9 the artist. Photograph courtesy of AGSNW, Mim Sterling\n\nFor me, the most impressive painting that was hung in the \u201cwinning room\u201d this year is still Kerry McInnis\u2019s Omar Musa, the poetry of unease \u2013 a muted study of one of this coming generation\u2019s most interesting writers.\n\nThe Archibald rules\n\nOne of the unspoken rules for hanging the Archibald, and the reason for the primacy of the central room, is the need to create a space for television cameras to film from a relative distance before zooming on the detail, the artist and the subject.\n\nJust outside the favoured room the curator has installed what is probably the most unusual painting to enter the Archibald.\n\nPaul Ryan has previously been exhibited, but this year\u2019s Thirteen Noahs easily outdoes his previous efforts.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nIt is a compilation of paintings of the character actor Noah Taylor, based on different images, some distorted, each superimposed on discarded artworks \u2013 including a tapestry and ping pong bats. Taylor has inserted himself in such a wide range of characters on film and television that it makes sense for him to appear as a part of the scenery with kitsch naked ladies, landscapes and a dog. It might not have been awarded the prize, but it is easily the most exciting work in the show.\n\nThe dead and the famous\n\nThere are sub-themes in the exhibition.\n\nTwo portraits of the recently dead could not provide a greater contrast.\n\nJohn Beard has painted Bill Wright, the much loved curator, director and artist as pale ghost seen through a veil of striped primary colours. It is a celebration of his life and his values.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nPeter Churcher has painted his mother, Betty Churcher, on her deathbed as a slack jawed empty shell with just a flicker of life in one eye. I can understand the impulse that led the artist to paint her as she faded from life, but this work needs a more sensitive context than the boisterous Archibald.\n\nMore than almost anyone I knew, Betty Churcher was very conscious of her public image.\n\nIn her last interview with Leigh Sales she went to an enormous effort to look immaculate, because she was speaking to her legacy.\n\nAnother surprising disappointment is Shaun Gladwell\u2019s monochrome portrait of Mark Donaldson VC, where a skull crashes onto the subject\u2019s helmeted head.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nGladwell\u2019s style here is deliberately reminiscent of action hero comic books, and it does not quite work in this context.\n\nTianli Zu also uses monochrome (plus a burst of lurid green shoes) for his portrait of Edmund Capon, \u201cEdmund, your Twomblys are behind you\u201d, a reference to Capon\u2019s most distinguished acquisition for the Gallery\u2019s collection.\n\nHe has chosen to give the former director an especially gnarled face, which contrasts with the stylishly painted building.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Mim Sterling\n\nIf it were dependant on subject matter, the clear winners would have been portraits of artists and people working in the arts.\n\nFilippa Buttitta has painted the much loved Judy Cassab while Tom Carment has a self portrait of his own ageing face.\n\nRodney Pople, an Archibald regular, has painted Frannie Hopkirk, Brett Whiteley\u2019s sister looking bug-eyed, while former National Portrait Gallery director Andrew Sayers has a portrait of Tim Bonyhady but manages to give him an expression that looks a bit like Sayers himself.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nPerhaps the selection of so many people from the arts is a retreat from the current abysmal state of Australian politics \u2013 the only politicians included are those mad mavericks, Bob Katter and Cory Bernardi \u2013 neither with works that are especially memorable.\n\nThere is a sign of a better world with Sally Ross\u2019s very sweet portrait of documentary film maker Eva Orner, which hangs adjacent to Guy Morgan\u2019s portrait of Louise Voigt, the CEO of Barnardo\u2019s Australia.\n\nThe Wynne Prize, also judged by the Trustees, is often overlooked in the annual festival of faces. Mostly that neglect is justified, but this year the Trustees have reached out and given the prize to a young Melbourne artist Natasha Bieniek.\n\nI get the impression that, having done their duty by the public and paid homage to the sheer exuberant sensationalism of the Archibald, the Trustees have collectively released their inner aesthete and indulged in supporting both quality and the coming generation. As Guido Belgiorno-Nettis says, judging these prizes is \u201cabsolutely the most fun thing\u201d.\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\nCongratulations Natasha Bieniek, but the Wynne Prize is deeply flawed\n\n\n\nThe Archibald Prize exhibition will show at the Art Gallery of NSW from July 18 - September 27.

Uncle Paddy and in 2012 he won the Sulman Prize for his painting Judo House pt 4 (Golden mud).\n\nGallery owner and art dealer Kerry Crowley described Milsom's work as \"influenced by the nineteenth-century Japanese master Hokusai, Edward Hopper, white-on-white abstractionist Robert Ryman, Gerhard Richter, and Pop figurative painter Alex Katz.\"\n\nCriminal conviction\n\nIn 2014, Milsom was convicted and sentenced to a maximum six-and-a-half years imprisonment for the April 2012 armed robbery, while under the influence of drugs and alcohol, of a 7-Eleven in Glebe, an inner neighbourhood of Sydney. The sentence was reduced on appeal to two years and four months\u2019 imprisonment.

Ingrid Periz\n\n\n\n\n\nNigel Milsom (b. 1975, Albury, l. Newcastle) is a figurative painter of baroque abstractions. Formal contestations within each painting and within each exhibition (light versus dark, motion versus stasis, advantage and disadvantage) slip into more complex and more personal structures. Milsom has had a consistent studio practice over two and a half decades. While at times his paintings have been more provisional in nature, strong painting is his signature indebted to chiaroscuro persuasion and a highly distinctive personal style. Typically white paint figures on black paint ground with the occasional intervention of colour, Milsom\u2019s subjects are constructed energetically via a scaffold of construction lines that begin in ink studies and are left visible in the final work. His bodies are geometric form against a more gestural and more openly brushy sequence of marks. His subjects range widely and function abstractly as entry points to composition and pictorial pragmatics. While focused around an athletics of form, Milsom\u2019s slippages into social dynamics and cultural references are ubiquitous and operate in parallel \u2014 often including veiled music and literary motifs as well as autobiographical chapters.\n\nMilsom has been awarded three of Australia\u2019s most prestigious painting prizes: The Sir John Sulman Prize (2012), The Doug Moran National Portrait Prize (2013) and The Archibald Prize (2015). He received a Master of Fine Arts (Research) from the College of Fine Arts, University of New South Wales, Sydney in 2002.\n\n\n\nKey exhibitions\n\n\n\nKey readings\n\nCollections\n\nAllens Arthur Robinson Art Collection\n\nArtbank\n\nANZ Bank Art Collection\n\nArt Gallery of New South Wales\n\nCampbelltown Arts Centre\n\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia Art Collection\n\nMaitland Regional Art Gallery\n\nMonash University Art Collection\n\nMurray Art Museum Albury\n\nMuseum of Contemporary Art Australia\n\nNewcastle Art Gallery\n\nWesfarmers Art Collection\n\nWollongong University Art Collection\n\n\u00bb View available artworks by Nigel Milsom"}, {"url": "https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/artsets/9t7vre", "page_content": "In The art that made me, artists discuss works in the Art Gallery of NSW collection that either inspire, influence or simply delight them.

This year\u2019s prize exhibitions are an indication that they are all having a lot of fun.\n\nThe guide to winning\n\nThe choice of winner for the Archibald, Nigel Milsom\u2019s Judo House Part 6 (The White Bird) \u2013 main image \u2013 is a portrait of the showman barrister, Charles Waterstreet was widely predicted, as was the runner-up Mitch Cairns\u2019 angular portrait of artist Peter Powditch. There were several reasons for this.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nFirst, the Archibald is \u2013 in essence \u2013 not an art prize but a celebration of the personalities who define Australia, and especially Sydney. Waterstreet, the flamboyant inspiration for the ABC television series Rake, has to be a front runner on those grounds alone.\n\nIn addition, Milsom was the winner of the 2013 Moran Prize \u2013 and a convicted criminal \u2013 all of which makes good copy. The Archibald is, above all things, about media coverage.\n\nThe other guide to the winner comes from the hanging. In the 1950s and 60s the Gallery director, Hal Missingham, used to write the telegrams for the winner before the judging. The Trustees were furious with him, but he had their measure.\n\nFor the 33 years of Edmund Capon\u2019s directorship it became very easy to work out which work was most likely to win. For well over a week before the final judging, the winner would be hanging in the central court on one of the long walls \u2013 either opposite where the announcement would be made, or adjacent to it.\n\nThe Director always chose the location.\n\nUnder the terms of JF Archibald\u2019s will, the prize must be judged by the Trustees. Since the rise of curators and professional gallery directors, only a few trustees are artists, but the current crop include some extremely knowledgeable collectors and art patrons.\n\nThe lighter and livelier exhibition is a reflection of their broad understanding that the Archibald exists to celebrate portraiture and people, not to elevate the status of the artists.\n\n\u00a9 the artist. Photograph courtesy of AGSNW, Mim Sterling\n\nFor me, the most impressive painting that was hung in the \u201cwinning room\u201d this year is still Kerry McInnis\u2019s Omar Musa, the poetry of unease \u2013 a muted study of one of this coming generation\u2019s most interesting writers.\n\nThe Archibald rules\n\nOne of the unspoken rules for hanging the Archibald, and the reason for the primacy of the central room, is the need to create a space for television cameras to film from a relative distance before zooming on the detail, the artist and the subject.\n\nJust outside the favoured room the curator has installed what is probably the most unusual painting to enter the Archibald.\n\nPaul Ryan has previously been exhibited, but this year\u2019s Thirteen Noahs easily outdoes his previous efforts.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nIt is a compilation of paintings of the character actor Noah Taylor, based on different images, some distorted, each superimposed on discarded artworks \u2013 including a tapestry and ping pong bats. Taylor has inserted himself in such a wide range of characters on film and television that it makes sense for him to appear as a part of the scenery with kitsch naked ladies, landscapes and a dog. It might not have been awarded the prize, but it is easily the most exciting work in the show.\n\nThe dead and the famous\n\nThere are sub-themes in the exhibition.\n\nTwo portraits of the recently dead could not provide a greater contrast.\n\nJohn Beard has painted Bill Wright, the much loved curator, director and artist as pale ghost seen through a veil of striped primary colours. It is a celebration of his life and his values.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nPeter Churcher has painted his mother, Betty Churcher, on her deathbed as a slack jawed empty shell with just a flicker of life in one eye. I can understand the impulse that led the artist to paint her as she faded from life, but this work needs a more sensitive context than the boisterous Archibald.\n\nMore than almost anyone I knew, Betty Churcher was very conscious of her public image.\n\nIn her last interview with Leigh Sales she went to an enormous effort to look immaculate, because she was speaking to her legacy.\n\nAnother surprising disappointment is Shaun Gladwell\u2019s monochrome portrait of Mark Donaldson VC, where a skull crashes onto the subject\u2019s helmeted head.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nGladwell\u2019s style here is deliberately reminiscent of action hero comic books, and it does not quite work in this context.\n\nTianli Zu also uses monochrome (plus a burst of lurid green shoes) for his portrait of Edmund Capon, \u201cEdmund, your Twomblys are behind you\u201d, a reference to Capon\u2019s most distinguished acquisition for the Gallery\u2019s collection.\n\nHe has chosen to give the former director an especially gnarled face, which contrasts with the stylishly painted building.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Mim Sterling\n\nIf it were dependant on subject matter, the clear winners would have been portraits of artists and people working in the arts.\n\nFilippa Buttitta has painted the much loved Judy Cassab while Tom Carment has a self portrait of his own ageing face.\n\nRodney Pople, an Archibald regular, has painted Frannie Hopkirk, Brett Whiteley\u2019s sister looking bug-eyed, while former National Portrait Gallery director Andrew Sayers has a portrait of Tim Bonyhady but manages to give him an expression that looks a bit like Sayers himself.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nPerhaps the selection of so many people from the arts is a retreat from the current abysmal state of Australian politics \u2013 the only politicians included are those mad mavericks, Bob Katter and Cory Bernardi \u2013 neither with works that are especially memorable.\n\nThere is a sign of a better world with Sally Ross\u2019s very sweet portrait of documentary film maker Eva Orner, which hangs adjacent to Guy Morgan\u2019s portrait of Louise Voigt, the CEO of Barnardo\u2019s Australia.\n\nThe Wynne Prize, also judged by the Trustees, is often overlooked in the annual festival of faces. Mostly that neglect is justified, but this year the Trustees have reached out and given the prize to a young Melbourne artist Natasha Bieniek.\n\nI get the impression that, having done their duty by the public and paid homage to the sheer exuberant sensationalism of the Archibald, the Trustees have collectively released their inner aesthete and indulged in supporting both quality and the coming generation. As Guido Belgiorno-Nettis says, judging these prizes is \u201cabsolutely the most fun thing\u201d.\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\nCongratulations Natasha Bieniek, but the Wynne Prize is deeply flawed\n\n\n\nThe Archibald Prize exhibition will show at the Art Gallery of NSW from July 18 - September 27.

Gadigal were one of a number of clans, collectively known as the Eora Nation, living in what is now called the Sydney Metropolitan area.\n\nIn Aboriginal People and Place on the City of Sydney\u2019s website Barani: Sydney\u2019s Aboriginal History, Anita Heiss and Melodie-Jane Gibson describe Gadi (gal) country stretching along the southern side of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour) from South Head to around what is now known as Petersham, while the southern boundary is unclear.\n\nIt is thought the hill where NAS now stands was a significant Gadigal site with pathways running through it and possibly used for ceremony, with good views of the harbour to the north and an abundant supply of water from Yurong Creek that ran from Darlinghurst to Waalamool (Woolloomooloo), and Rushcutters Creek to the east.\n\nDarlinghurst Gaol was built on the ridge between Waalamool and Kogerrah (Rushcutters Bay), a place of sandstone and dry sclerophyll forest with many Sydney redgums, as well as banksia and coastal heath plants such as hakea.\n\nNorth of where NAS now stands, the valleys leading down to Waalamool (Wooloomooloo) and Wahganmuggalee (Farm Cove) gave way to Swamp Oak Forest. To the east and on exposed headlands were pockets of coastal heath forest. To the south the dry forest turned to grassland, swamp and wetlands.\n\nThe harbour including Warrane (Sydney Cove) was an important part of Gadigal country and culture. The coastal people gathered shellfish including badangi (Sydney rock oysters), gadyan (Sydney cockles) and mussels, shown by the many middens that remain in the Sydney area. They also used nawi (canoes) for fishing, during the day and at night, building fires onboard to cook their catch.\n\nThe 2022 public artwork bara by Waanyi artist Judy Watson was inspired by the shell hooks Gadigal women used for fishing, kept in the Australian Museum\u2019s collection in Sydney. Of her sculpture, which sits high on a lawn near the Sydney Opera House facing the Harbour Bridge, Watson said: \u201cMy concept for bara re-imagines ancient gathering spaces where people sat by fires on the headlands and feasted. bara provides a quiet space for ceremony, reflection and contemplation in a busy and ever-changing city.\u201d\n\nWith the invasion of the country in 1788 by the British First Fleet, the impact on Indigenous people, their country and culture, was catastrophic in the short and long term. Early colonists estimated 1,500 Aboriginal people were living at that time between Broken Bay in Sydney\u2019s north and Botany Bay to the south, but more recent estimates range from 3000 to 5000 people. Within a year, it was reported that around half these local people had died from the smallpox epidemic of 1789.\n\nAt the same time as this terrible loss of life, there was also resistance to the invaders, such as the guerrilla war waged from 1788 to 1802 against the Sydney Cove colony by Pemulwuy, a Bidjigal man from the Botany Bay area.\n\nAs Sydney historian and lecturer Alana Piper notes in her research paper exploring the history of Yirranma Place in Darlinghurst near the National Art School, Aboriginal presence, culture and history did not end in Sydney with the First Fleet\u2019s arrival in 1788, but has continued, disrupted but unbroken, to this day.\n\nBy 1822, when building began on the Darlinghurst Gaol walls, the First Peoples who had lived here and cared for their country for countless generations had largely been dispossessed in this area, but more than 200 Aboriginal people lived nearby in Gurrajin (Elizabeth Bay), (Derrawunn) Potts Point and Waalamool (Woolloomooloo), which remains an important site for Aboriginal people today.\n\nAfter the so-called \u2018assimilation\u2019 of Aboriginal people into the British colony, many were interned in Darlinghurst Gaol after it opened in 1841. At least five were condemned to death and four were hanged for murder or rape: Mogo Gar in 1850, John McGrath in 1875, Jimmy Governor in 1901 and Thomas Moore in 1903. Others had their death sentences commuted to life imprisonment, often with hard labour.\n\nAccording to Sydney historian and archaeologist Paul Irish, First Nations people lived nearby while the gaol was in operation, including at Barcom Glen just below the gaol until the 1860s, and elsewhere around Kogerrah (Rushcutters Bay) until around 1900. While some were inmates at Darlinghurst, usually interned for minor offences, most Aboriginal prisoners came from elsewhere across NSW.\n\nSydney was the centre of the colonial justice system, and Darlinghurst Gaol came into operation when colonial expansion across the state was underway. Aboriginal people were arrested for offences such assault, murder and spearing cattle on the colonial frontier, and for a range of other crimes as they were forced to adjust to life under colonial rule.\n\nIrish says poor conditions in the gaol contributed to the ill health of prisoners, and many inmates died. As Darlinghurst Gaol was primarily a manufacturing gaol, some First Nations prisoners received training in stonemasonry in the 1850s and 1860s and in 1876 several skilled weavers at the gaol had their mats displayed at the Centennial International Exhibition in Philadelphia.\n\nIrish says it is not known how many Aboriginal prisoners served time in Darlinghurst Gaol, as their heritage was not always recorded in admission registers, particularly in cases of mixed ancestry. Prison photos and records are sometimes the only archival evidence of these inmates, and historians are now beginning to examine these records more closely for a more detailed understanding of the lives of Indigenous prisoners.\n\nWiradjuri man Jimmy Governor was the most renowned First Peoples inmate in Darlinghurst Gaol. As NAS archivist and historian Deborah Beck notes in her book about the gaol, Hope in Hell, Jimmy\u2019s life was recorded in detail and was the basis for Thomas Keneally\u2019s 1972 book, The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith, later made into a 1978 film by Fred Schepisi. After committing murder and rape with his brother Joe, Jimmy eluded the police and Aboriginal trackers for 14 weeks. Joe was killed after an extensive manhunt. Jimmy was captured on 19 October, 1900 and taken to Darlinghurst Gaol where he was photographed for the Entrance and Description Book.\n\nHe was convicted on 23 November 1900, given the death penalty, and was hanged at the gaol on 18 January 1901, aged 26. His story has seen a resurgence of interest recently, including the 2021 book On Thomas Keneally by Wiradjuri man, journalist and writer Stan Grant, reflecting on Governor\u2019s life and Keneally\u2019s rewriting of it. Grant visited the former gaol site as part of his research:\n\n\u2018I went in search of a ghost: the ghost of Jimmy Governor. I went to the place where he took his last breath. The old Darlinghurst Gaol is now the site of the National Art School. The gallows are gone. But behind the high sandstone walls, it is not so hard to imagine what it was like, back then. I was taken through the time-worn corridors, past what once were cold prison cells. I turned a corner and stopped suddenly, like something \u2013 or someone \u2013 had grabbed hold of me. I looked up and my tour guide said, that\u2019s where it happened. Exactly there, she said, where I was standing, is where Jimmy was hanged. Above me was where the trapdoor would have been, and where the hangman would have placed the noose around Jimmy\u2019s neck.\n\n\u2018\u2026 Jimmy was executed less than three weeks after Federation, and here I am searching for him still, looking back into the past to try to make sense of who I am. More than a hundred years later, Jimmy Governor still casts a shadow over this nation. Jimmy Governor haunts me and he haunts Australia.\u2019\n\nKudjla/Gangalu artist Daniel Boyd made two paintings of Jimmy Governor for the 2016 exhibition in the NAS Gallery, Sixth Sense, and generously donated the works to the NAS Collection. Painted on small canvasses using oil, acrylic, pastel, charcoal and glue, they hung in the gallery on either side of Boyd\u2019s site-specific work, an untitled window piece with many pinholes, which transformed the exterior into a dotted vision.\n\nNAS students have also responded to the story of Jimmy Governor. In 2016, printmaking student Kirtika Kain made some large prints outside Building 24. Using text and enlarged photographs, the interactive prints were displayed for a few months, and students were encouraged to place their thumbprint onto one of the panels.\n\nOverall, NAS has had relatively few First Peoples students, however many of those who studied here went on to successful careers as artists. These include the late Thainakuith woman Thancoupie, recognised today as a ground-breaking Australian ceramicist, who drew inspiration from her cultural stories, translating them into contemporary three-dimensional forms. Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Cooperative founders and artists Euphemia Bostock, Fiona Foley, Fern Martins and Jeffrey Samuels also studied at NAS.\n\nWiradjuri woman Karla Dickens has spoken about how her time studying at NAS helped save her life, before she went on to build a career as one of Australia\u2019s most acclaimed contemporary artists. Most recently, Dickens took part in the 2022 Sydney Festival with her show Return to Sender at Carriageworks, and was commissioned to create the artwork To see or not to see for the fa\u00e7ade of the Art Gallery of NSW. Embracing Shadows, the artist\u2019s 2023 survey exhibition at Campbelltown Arts Centre, spanned 30 years of practice, and Moby Dickens, the portrait of Dickens by artist Blak Douglas in the wake of the Lismore floods, won the 2022 Archibald Prize.\n\nBadtjala artist and NAS alumna Fiona Foley\u2019s solo exhibition and installation, Who are these strangers and where are they going?, was shown in the NAS Gallery in January 2020 as part of the Sydney Festival, including a Q&A discussion with Bandjalung man and curator Djon Mundine. Foley is a highly respected contemporary artist, academic and writer, with her 2020 book Biting the Clouds uncovering the little-known colonial-era practice of paying Indigenous workers in opium.\n\nTony Albert (Girramay/Yidinji/Kuku\u2013Yalanji peoples) created a site-specific artwork for the NAS campus as part of NIRIN, the 22nd Biennale of Sydney in March 2020. Inspired by the original 1873 stained-glass window in the NAS Chapel building depicting the prodigal son parable, Brothers (The Prodigal Son) was a life-sized stained-glass work set in sandstone, installed at the art school\u2019s entrance with the Chapel behind it.\n\nIn February 2021 NAS graduate Rubyrose Bancroft was featured in the Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Co-operative group show Loom at Carriageworks. Rubyrose was one of the emerging artists presented by NAS at the 2021 Sydney Contemporary art fair.\n\nIn February 2022, NAS welcomed John Waight as the new Head of First People\u2019s Programs.

She said he would be \"thrilled\" at news of the win.\n\nJudge Daniel Thomas said fellow judge Ben Quilty knew Milsom and described him as a sweet, gentle person.\n\nThomas, a leading figure in the Australian art scene, said he didn't mind awarding such a handsome sum to a prison inmate, given the supreme quality of Milsom's work and the positive effect the prize could have on his life.\n\n\"Even someone who has gotten into some state of punishment for whatever he did could come good,\" he said. \"So that's how I reconciled myself with Milsom getting that money.\"\n\nMilsom's Uncle Paddy portrait features cubist-like brush strokes in his subject's face, which soften in his shirt.\n\nMilsom's Uncle Paddy portrait employs cubist-like brush strokes. Photograph: Evans Media\n\n\"He has an extraordinarily refined technique, the brushwork, so smooth, so delicate,\" Thomas said.\n\nHe said he admired the imagery in the portrait even more than the technique.\n\n\"It's a very old-fashioned Australian face,\" Thomas said.\n\nUpon entering for the prize artists had to provide a description of their work. In his statement, Milsom wrote that his portrait was of his grandfather's friend Paddy, who used to have beers with him at a NSW leagues club every Saturday night.\n\nPaddy was one of the few non-family members to attend Milsom's grandfather's funeral.\n\n\"I knew that Paddy's Saturday nights would never be the same,\" Milsom said. \"There is a quiet sadness about Paddy that seems to stem from the realisation that death will be visiting him soon, too. When I painted his portrait I got a sense that he has learnt to sit with this feeling of sadness, which has given him a greater strength and wisdom.\"\n\nPhotographer and filmmaker John Janson-Moore took out the $50,000 Moran Contemporary Photographic Prize for his work Nyirripi Girl With Finger."}, {"url": "https://nas.edu.au/nas-archive-and-collection/", "page_content": "How many works are in the Collection?\n\nThere are currently 4,768 works in the NAS Archive and Collection.\n\nDo you have a list of past NAS Collection Exhibitions?\n\nVisit the Past Exhibitions page on our website.\n\nDo you keep records of former students and staff?\n\nEnquiries from researchers or biographers regarding former students and staff at any point in the NAS\u2019s history are welcome, but please be advised that in many cases we can provide only limited personal information, and, in the case of alumni, sometimes no more than confirmation of department and year of graduation.\n\nWe do not hold records of students who graduated prior to 2000.
