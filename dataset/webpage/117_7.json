Wet Leg\u2019s debut album took the music industry by storm on its release last year, topping the charts and spawning the hit singles \u2018Wet Dream\u2019 and \u2018Chaise Longue\u2019. The Ivors judges described Teasdale and Chambers\u2019 writing as fresh, unapologetic and direct, with surprising melodies that demand attention.\n\nBest Contemporary Song went to Raye, 070 Shake and Mike Sabath for \u2018Escapism\u2019 \u2013 which Raye performed live at the awards ceremony. Described by the judges as daring, brave and empowering songwriting, the track found huge success after going viral on TikTok, marking Raye\u2019s first ever number one single in the UK, where it was also certified platinum.\n\nIn recognition of the massive impact her musical vision has made on her fellow songwriters, hyper-pop trailblazer Charli XCX is awarded the Visionary Award with Amazon Music.\n\nHarry Styles, Kid Harpoon and Tyler Johnson, together win PRS for Music Most Performed Work for their collaboration on the UK\u2019s biggest song of 2022, \u2018As It Was\u2019. This marks the third Ivor Novello Award each for the fruitful partnership of Harry Styles and Kid Harpoon, who won both PRS for Music Most Performed Work for \u2018Adore You\u2019 and Songwriter of the Year in 2021.\n\nWith over 40 million records sold worldwide, the Special International Award celebrates the outstanding career and influence of Blondie\u2019s Debbie Harry and Chris Stein. Emerging from the New York new wave scene in the mid-seventies, the group have written a huge number of celebrated songs throughout their illustrious career and remain one of the world\u2019s most influential bands.\n\nBest Album goes to 11 by SAULT, written by Dean \u201cInflo\u201d Josiah Cover, Jamar McNaughton, Cleopatra Nikolic and Jack Pe\u00f1ate. Drawing from Afrobeat and blues influences, 11 was one of five critically acclaimed albums released for free simultaneously by SAULT in November 2022. Dean \u201cInflo\u201d Josiah Cover\u2019s win marks the significant achievement of his fourth Ivor Novello Award.\n\nBest Song Musically and Lyrically goes to \u2018King\u2019 by Florence + the Machine, written by Florence Welch and Jack Antonoff. Considered a standout from the group\u2019s last album, Dance Fever, the song discusses Welch\u2019s conflict in choosing between her career and starting a family as well as gender expectations for women in society.\n\nKAMILLE\u2019s impressive body of work was recognised with the Outstanding Song Collection award. KAMILLE has built a career as one of Britain\u2019s most successful songwriters, working with artists such as Mabel, The Saturdays, Dua Lipa and, most famously, Little Mix, for whom she wrote over 30 songs including the number one hits \u2018Black Magic\u2019 and \u2018Shout Out To My Ex\u2019. On top of her songwriting achievements, she has also launched a career as an artist in her own right.\n\nThe PRS for Music Icon Award goes to Tim Booth, Saul Davies, Jim Glennie, Larry Gott and Mark Hunter for James. From their original breakthrough in the \u2018Madchester\u2019 scene of the early nineties, James have become an enduring gem of British music, selling over 25 million albums over their 39-year career.\n\nThe Rising Star Award with Amazon Music has been awarded to singer-songwriter Victoria Canal, who counts legendary names in Chris Martin and Jon Hopkins amongst her admirers and mentors. She is the fourth consecutive female songwriter to pick up the award since it was introduced in 2020, with The Ivors judges complementing her powerful songwriting and compelling sound.\n\nSting received the Fellowship of The Ivors Academy, the highest honour the Academy bestows. With over 100 million albums sold throughout his career from his combined work with The Police and as a solo artist, Sting is one of Britain\u2019s most successful, accomplished, and pioneering songwriters.

The only prize to be judged exclusively by fellow music creators and presented by The Ivors Academy, the awards are the pinnacle in the careers of many in the songwriting and composing field.\n\nBetween 1991 and 2019, PRS for Music contributed to and supported three prestigious Ivor Novello Award categories, the PRS for Music award for: Most Performed Work; Outstanding Contribution to British Music; and Special International Award.\n\nAndy Bell and Vince Clarke won the first PRS for Music Most Performed Work Award for Erasure classic, Blue Savannah, released in 1990. While Kenney Jones, Ronnie Lane, Steve Marriott and Ian McLagan were the first to take home the PRS for Music Outstanding Contribution to British Music award as The Small Faces in 1996, and Hal David won the inaugural Special International Award in 1999.\n\nGary Barlow is the only songwriter to have won three PRS for Music-supported Ivor Novello awards, spanning three decades, for his widely celebrated work with Take That. He has received the Most Performed Work award twice, for Back for Good in 1996 and Shine in 2008, and he received the Outstanding Contribution to British Music Award in 2012 alongside his Take That band mates Robbie Williams, Mark Owen, Howard Donald and Jason Orange.\n\nOther songwriters and composers who have won the PRS for Music Most Performed Work Award more than once include Cathy Dennis for her work on Kylie Minogue\u2019s Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head in 2002 and Britney Spears\u2019 Toxic in 2005, William Orbit for his work on Madonna\u2019s Beautiful Stranger in 2000 and All Saints\u2019 Pure Shores in 2001, and Fred Fairbrass, Richard Fairbrass and Robert Manzoli for the Right Said Fred hits I\u2019m Too Sexy in 1992 and Deeply Dippy in 1993.\n\nRobbie Williams is the only songwriter to have won awards both as a solo artist and as part of a group, winning the PRS for Music Most Performed Work Award (1998) for Angels in 1999 and the PRS for Music Outstanding Contribution to British Music in 2012 with Take That.\n\nThe PRS for Music Special International Award is the only Ivor Novello Award independently presented to an international writer, recognising those whose work has left an indelible mark on British music. Winners have included Stevie Wonder (2001), Brian Wilson (2003), Quincy Jones (2007), Diane Warren (2008), Nile Rodgers (2014), Mariah Carey (2019) and the legendary Bill Withers (2017), who sadly passed away in April this year."}]}
