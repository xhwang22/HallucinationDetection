He was selected to the all California Interscholastic Federation team and twice captured All Irvine League honors.\n\nCollege career\n\nAs a 6'2\" forward for Orange Coast College, Vallely averaged 26 points per game and broke 18 scoring records. He was selected a junior college All-American. He dribbled with his left hand and shot with his right hand. He was especially good at shooting an outside jump shot.\n\nAfter transferring to UCLA in 1968, he became an integral member of the Bruins' backcourt in 1968. Vallely was quick to make the transition from forward to guard at UCLA. In his first season, he was the Bruins' third leading scorer (12.9 ppg) and adapted smoothly to head coach John Wooden's \"attack and gamble offense\".[1] He was a member of the UCLA teams that won national titles in the 1969 NCAA tournament and the 1970 NCAA tournament. Vallely majored in economics at UCLA and had a 3.36 grade point average as a junior.[1]\n\nHe was selected to the twelve man 1968 Olympic trials team coached by Jerry Tarkanian which competed in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nProfessional career\n\nVallely was selected by the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the 1970 NBA draft. He sat on the bench much of the time, playing behind Pete Maravich, Lou Hudson, Walt Hazzard, and Herm Gilliam.[2] Vallely was acquired by the Houston Rockets in November 1971 along with 6'7\" forward Jim Davis.[2]\n\nHe served as player-coach for the Belgium Lions of the European Professional Basketball League in 1975.[3]\n\nPersonal\n\nVallely married Karen, a woman he met at Orange Coast College, where he studied prior to attending UCLA. They wed around the time he was selected in the NBA. The couple had two children, Eric and Erin. Erin died of a rare form of cancer of the soft muscle tissue in September 1991. Eric starred as a volleyball player while he was a student at UCLA.\n\nIllness\n\nVallely was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2003. He had a single stem cell treatment which was unsuccessful. He received a second offer from a stem cell donor bank, which received a nearly exact match from a winemaker who lived near Frankfurt, Germany. This time the treatment was a success. Vallely was able to meet his donor following a two-year waiting period.[4]\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://www.patrickspeople.scot/our%20family/13512.htm", "page_content": "Family Links Spouses/Children:\n\n1.

BOTTOM: Henry Bibby, Terry Schofield, Andy Hill.\n\nJohn Vallely Today\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Vallely, age 53, was raised in Orange County and now lives in Newport Beach. During his college days, John was a member of the UCLA Bruins basketball team and participated in two National Championship seasons, 1969 and 1970, under legendary coach John Wooden. John and wife Karen met during college and were married in 1970, the year John graduated with a degree in sociology. The couple had two children: a son, Eric, and a daughter, Erin. When Erin was 9 years old she was diagnosed with cancer, and eventually lost her battle, at the age of 12, in 1991. Since then, John and Karen have been committed to fighting pediatric cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, John is completing treatment for his own illness, lymphoma, and is very optimistic about his recovery. John says he uses Wooden\u2019s Pyramid of Success strategy to deal with his cancer. Wooden\u2019s philosophy, according to Vallely, focuses on success rather than winning. \u201cI have no conflict in my heart about knowing that I am the best I can be and so I have peace of mind,\u201d John says. \u201cSuccess is the absence of conflict. Actually it\u2019s harder to do than winning. It\u2019s possible to win a game without doing your best. But knowing have been the best husband, the best father, the best patient I can, is all I can do.\u201d\n\nSurviving With Strength\n\nA Former UCLA Basketball Star Writes About Dealing with the Loss of a Daughter from Cancer, and Then, Fighting His Own Battle with Lymphoma\n\nBy John Vallely\n\n\n\nA random attack of cancer strikes fear in anyone. Why me? Am I going to die? What did I do wrong? Why did this have to strike my daughter at such a young age? It\u2019s not possible to answer these questions. What matters most, is our response to these life challenges.\n\n\n\nMy experience with cancer began in 1988. My 9- year-old daughter Erin was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma. Surgeons removed a cantaloupe- sized tumor from her abdomen, but were unable to get the entire growth. Until her death in 1991, she endured multiple s u r g e r i e s , chemotherapy and radiation that severely burned her already ill body. I learned so much from her. I miss her.\n\n\n\nIn April 2002, at 53 years old, I was diagnosed with lymphoma. I cannot tell you how astonished I was to learn of my condition. How could this be? Haven't we had enough? My wife and I had already experienced our child dying in our arms. What could be next for us? What about our son Eric? Again I was filled with fear, but once we all began to fight back it gradually subsided.\n\n\n\nThe first step of each patient\u2019s process is correct diagnosis. I believe you must have at least two opinions regarding pathology. If a patient is incorrectly diagnosed, the treatment will not attack their disease. I have spoken with patients who were disappointed with treatment outcome. They later learned that the course of medications would have been different had they researched their circumstances more thoroughly. Consensus on diagnosis is good. Differing opinions lead to better decisions, so patient and family must be proactive and explore options. The relationship with the medical system should be considered a partnership.\n\n\n\nThe next step is launching a plan of attack. After all, this is War! Most things, including my cancer, are not simply about winning and losing. My disease is about the process. I believe it is important to have a positive attitude. Mine is: \"I will be the best I can be. I will do all that I can do to get well and to help my loved ones. I will follow all of the doctor\u2019s directions. I will do everything in my power to give myself and loved ones every chance to survive this disease. And then I will pray!\"\n\n\n\nI believe \"hope\" is important. One can benefit from faith in something. The mental, physical and spiritual obstacles related to cancer are severe. A positive outlook may not have the power to heal -\u2014 but, then again, it might. I believe, at the very least, it can make the process more manageable. Hope and faith are very personal. I was broken-hearted and disappointed when God did not heal my daughter. Yet, I believe she is in heaven. When I was diagnosed, I was angry with God. My lonely walks on the beach brought on another series of questions: What kind of God are you? Do you care? What do you want with my family? Even so, I never gave up my trust that God is watching over Erin.\n\n\n\nMy journey forward has been steady but difficult. It requires a willingness to participate on so many levels and I\u2019m always seeking answers. I believe that the process will lead to living my life at the highest level, regardless of the outcome. Prayer and reflection are part of my daily vigilance. I am grateful that doctors, nurses, chemotherapy, and other drugs are available. I consider these to be gifts from God. I also believe this is part of a grand plan that will give me, the cancer patient, an opportunity to fight and a chance to get well.\n\n\n\nWhen our daughter Erin died my wife, Karen, and I made our decision to fight back. We joined with others in an organization called the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation (PCRF) to raise funds for research aimed at curing pediatric cancer. I\u2019m a past president of PCRF, and currently a member of the PCRF board of directors. Karen spends countless hours on the PCRF Holiday Card Program \u2014 their major fund raising activity for the last 20 years. Our family shares the goals of PCRF.\n\n\n\nRaising funds to support research will help fight this terrible disease. Over the last 20 years the survival rate for children with cancer has more than doubled because of research. Regardless of the outcome of my disease, I know that we are making a difference in this big battle, that we are committed until cancer is defeated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links John Vallely Motivates\n\nLatest News Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.gofundme.com/f/johnathan-david-vallely-memorial", "page_content": "Hi! This is Noelle, Johnathan's daughter, asking for any donations possible to fund my father's memorial service. I have attached the description below. Thank you in advance for all of your support. <3\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnathan David Vallely was born in Greenwood, South Carolina, on November 15, 1973. He was born into a set of unfortunate circumstances that followed him through childhood into his adult life, as many children today suffer from similar situations. His life served as an example of what can happen to children when they are raised in homes with abuse and neglect, as he spent a significant amount of his life in and out of foster homes, until he was finally old enough to live on his own. Though the multiple foster homes and families him and his siblings were passed through, Johnathan always was there to stand as a strong protector, taking responsibility for not only his own actions, but that of his siblings when he feared their punishments. Despite the severe physical and emotional pain he was put through, he loved his family enough to take on those burdens and fight the battles for them, and that spoke of his capacity to love with full force.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the consequences of a tumultuous, frightening, abusive, and neglectful upbringing, John fell victim to the disease of addiction. In his youth, between foster care, boys' homes for wayward youth, and various punishments for acting out in school, he was an extremely intelligent individual with various talents and an overflowing heart. He wanted nothing more than to be a good man, a good father, a good brother, and a good citizen, but the pain and burdens he carried upon his shoulders were more than many of us could ever fathom. No child should ever have to endure the pain he did, and it could be said that the mere fact he was able to put a smile on his face and the faces of others is miraculous. Fishing was his escape, his safe space, and he deeply loved spending time out on the water away from everything, it was his peace and had him smile cheek to cheek when he caught a biggun'! He loved animals and was a man of faith, he could recite just about any bible verse if you asked him, and he had a beautiful and boisterous singing voice, even singing for a traveling church choir.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the late 1970s, John and his siblings were adopted by Kathy and Myron Chorbaijian, known as Johnathan David Chorbajian until being the first male in the state of South Carolina to adopt his wife's name, making him Johnathan David Vallely. As he was a huge bookworm and very much an intellectual at heart, he was a top scholar at Bob Jones University, later moving on to own and manage several different roofing and construction companies. John married Dawn Noel Vallely in 1997 and together they had a daughter, Noelle Virginia Vallely (23), in 1998, and welcomed a beautiful baby boy in 2004, Dominic Johnathan Vallely (18). As much love that he had for his family, the traumatic events of his childhood dominated his ability to lead a life of 'normalcy' in his adulthood, which led him down a rather destructive path. A slave to his addictions, as many others face these demons on a daily basis, he lost everything in his life, more than once he hit rock bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the sad story of many who suffer at the hands of abusive and neglectful family members, John adopted maladaptive coping mechanisms that took over his life, it was a destructive love and first hit. In his own words, he admitted his addictions were so strong, even the love of his children couldn't save him. Divorced in 2010, numerous times in and out of rehabilitation facilities, jail, and halfway homes, he was left penniless, homeless, and unrecognizable, he had become a shell of the person he wanted to be. On April 26th, 2022, our Creator called him home, and he is now free to be at peace, no longer haunted by his demons and hurt of past traumas, he is able to be truly happy. The authentic John could put a smile on anyone's face, sell a bikini to an eskimo, and love like no other! He will be remembered as a jokester, a lover, and one with charismatic soul, with a love for fishing, boating, singing, playing games, and spending time with his family.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pain and devastation of John's passing has been especially rough and arduous for his surviving children, Dominic and Noelle, of whom witnessed both his absence and destruction his disease left on others first-hand. We find comfort in the fact that we know John is no longer suffering here on earth, he is at peace in the sky, sitting with his fishing pole while laughing and cracking jokes! The demons may think they have won, but he is no longer in mental and physical pain. We send him so much love, as he is missed dearly.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnathan is survived by his children, Noelle and Dominic, his adopted parents Myron & Kathy Chorbajian. He is predeceased by his brother Tiger and sister Stacey. He is survived by his siblings Tammy, Pam, Chris, Rick, Teresa, Rita and Karissa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemorial Service will be held:\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 20 at 12pm\n\n\n\n\n\nBrookwood Church\n\n\n\n\n\n580 Brookwood Point Pl\n\n\n\n\n\nSimpsonville, SC 29681\n\n\n\n\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please assist Johnathan's children to cover his final costs by clicking the link to GoFundMe.\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Vallely Family"}, {"url": "https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/john-f-vallely-birth-1924-death-1994/5706516", "page_content": "Refresh this page to see various historical events that occurred during John's lifetime.\n\nIn 1924, in the year that John F Vallely was born, Macy's department store in New York held its first \"Thanksgiving parade\" on November 27th at 9a - during church services but leaving plenty of time to attend the big football game between Syracuse and Columbia universities. The parade was held as a way to promote the opening of the \u201cWorld\u2019s Largest Store\u201d and its 1 million square feet of retail space in Manhattan\u2019s Herald Square. The parade was 6 miles long and included floats, Macy's employees dressed as clowns, cowboys, and sword-wielding knights, and animals from Central Park Zoo. Santa Claus, of course, brought up the rear - opening the Christmas shopping season for Macy's.\n\nIn 1939, when he was just 15 years old, on the 1st of September, Nazi Germany invaded Poland. On September 17th, the Soviet Union invaded Poland as well. Poland expected help from France and the United Kingdom, since they had a pact with both. But no help came. By October 6th, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany held full control of the previously Polish lands. Eventually, the invasion of Poland lead to World War II.\n\nIn 1940, at the age of 16 years old, John was alive when on July 27th, the cartoon character Bugs Bunny debuted in his first film A Wild Hare - voiced by Mel Blanc. He has since appeared in more short films, feature films, compilations, TV series, music records, comic books, video games, award shows, amusement park rides, and commercials than any other cartoon character. He even has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. \"What's up, Doc?\"\n\nIn 1973, by the time he was 49 years old, in October, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned - President Nixon nominated Gerald Ford for Vice President. Nixon's tax returns came under investigation. Nixon offered the recently discovered Oval Office tapes be heard by one person and summarized - his offer was rejected by the Special Prosecutor. Nixon ordered the Attorney General, then the assistant Attorney General, to fire the Special Prosecutor. Both refused and were fired. The Solicitor General became the acting Attorney General and fired the Special Prosecutor (the Saturday Night Massacre). Nixon releases some of the tapes, under extreme pressure because of the firings.\n\nIn 1994, in the year of John F Vallely's passing, on May 6th, the Channel Tunnel or \"Chunnel\" was officially opened. The Chunnel is a railway tunnel beneath the English Channel that connects Great Britain to mainland France. Original plans for such a tunnel were developed in 1802 and approved by Napoleon Bonaparte but the British rejected the plan fearing that Napoleon would use the railway to invade."}, {"url": "https://www.edline-yahn.com/obituary/John-VallelyJr", "page_content": "John Walters Vallely, Jr. of Auburn, passed away April 13, 2020 in Kent, WA after a long, heart breaking battle with Alzheimer\u2019s, at the age of 79.\n\nJohnny, as he was affectionately known, was born in Bell Gardens, CA, a suburb of Los Angeles County, in May of 1940. His family moved to a new home in Norwalk, CA, when he was 9 years old. He attended Centennial Junior High and Excelsior High School from 1952-1958. Always a hard worker, he delivered newspapers early in the morning before going to school. He also worked selling flowers on weekends and washing dishes in a restaurant. Turning 16 and getting his driver\u2019s license allowed him to begin one of his life-long loves: driving cars and motorcycles.\n\nIn 1963, Johnny was drafted into the U.S. Army. After basic training at Fort Ord, CA, he was stationed at Fort Lewis, WA for 9 months, before serving in South Korea in the 7th Infantry Division, 13th Engineer Battalion, stationed at Camp Casey about 20 minutes from the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). In looking back on his service, Johnny was filled with a sense of pride and patriotism and felt it helped him gain a broader perspective, understanding and appreciation of our world. His grandsons, Darren and Nicko, were so influenced by their \u201cPapa\u201d, that they have now followed in his footsteps and joined the U.S Army and U.S. Marines, respectively.\n\nAfter the service, Johnny returned to the Seattle area to begin a new life in the Pacific Northwest. For over 30 years he had a successful career with Oak Harbor Freight Lines. He loved his job and the many people he met. Although it was hard work, the job allowed him to not only be of service to others, but also to learn first-hand about the many highways and byways of Washington. For leisure, he would go for long rides on his Harley Davidson through backwoods and forests and to the majestic mountains, lakes and streams. He loved the roar and mist of waterfalls and the smell of fresh air. He and his wife, Carol, were members of the Christian Motorcycle Association for about 20 years. For part of that time, he was a Safety Coordinator for the Washington chapter. He was especially proud of a mission trip he did to the Philippines with CMA in 1999.\n\nIf you were around Johnny, you were more than likely going to be laughing and having a good time. He was outgoing and charismatic. He loved joking around, telling stories and at times playing pranks on others. But he was also quick to laugh at himself. One of his favorite sayings was \u201cOuch i wawa!\u201d Who knows what it means, but he loved saying it! You might find him dancing or listening to music. Oldies but goodies were favorites, especially songs by Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry. He also loved mariachi music, Mexican food, tortillas and hot chili.\n\nAt the top of his list was being around family. He would make yearly trips to California with his daughter, Eve, to visit with his Mom and Dad, Jack & Eloise Vallely and his siblings Jeannie, Debbie and Dwight. One of his greatest loves in life was being \u201cPapa\u201d to his grandsons Darren and Nicholas (Nicko).

Family, friends and faith were his cornerstones and governed how he lived life.\n\nAlthough we miss him deeply, we know he is in the loving embrace of God. In fact, he continues to send a few \u201cgodwinks\u201d to his daughter in the form of pictures and postcards to let her and us know he is OK and that things are beautiful where he is. Leave it to Johnny to continue to put a smile on the face of all those he loved.\n\nJohnny was interred at the Tahoma National Cemetery in Kent, Washington on April 17, 2020.

Actually it\u2019s harder to do than winning. It\u2019s possible to win a game without doing your best. But knowing have been the best husband, the best father, the best patient I can, is all I can do.\u201d\n\nSurviving With Strength\n\nA Former UCLA Basketball Star Writes About Dealing with the Loss of a Daughter from Cancer, and Then, Fighting His Own Battle with Lymphoma\n\nBy John Vallely\n\n\n\nA random attack of cancer strikes fear in anyone. Why me? Am I going to die? What did I do wrong? Why did this have to strike my daughter at such a young age? It\u2019s not possible to answer these questions. What matters most, is our response to these life challenges.\n\n\n\nMy experience with cancer began in 1988. My 9- year-old daughter Erin was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma. Surgeons removed a cantaloupe- sized tumor from her abdomen, but were unable to get the entire growth. Until her death in 1991, she endured multiple s u r g e r i e s , chemotherapy and radiation that severely burned her already ill body. I learned so much from her. I miss her.\n\n\n\nIn April 2002, at 53 years old, I was diagnosed with lymphoma. I cannot tell you how astonished I was to learn of my condition. How could this be? Haven't we had enough? My wife and I had already experienced our child dying in our arms. What could be next for us? What about our son Eric? Again I was filled with fear, but once we all began to fight back it gradually subsided.\n\n\n\nThe first step of each patient\u2019s process is correct diagnosis. I believe you must have at least two opinions regarding pathology. If a patient is incorrectly diagnosed, the treatment will not attack their disease. I have spoken with patients who were disappointed with treatment outcome. They later learned that the course of medications would have been different had they researched their circumstances more thoroughly. Consensus on diagnosis is good. Differing opinions lead to better decisions, so patient and family must be proactive and explore options. The relationship with the medical system should be considered a partnership.\n\n\n\nThe next step is launching a plan of attack. After all, this is War! Most things, including my cancer, are not simply about winning and losing. My disease is about the process. I believe it is important to have a positive attitude. Mine is: \"I will be the best I can be. I will do all that I can do to get well and to help my loved ones. I will follow all of the doctor\u2019s directions. I will do everything in my power to give myself and loved ones every chance to survive this disease. And then I will pray!\"\n\n\n\nI believe \"hope\" is important. One can benefit from faith in something. The mental, physical and spiritual obstacles related to cancer are severe. A positive outlook may not have the power to heal -\u2014 but, then again, it might. I believe, at the very least, it can make the process more manageable. Hope and faith are very personal. I was broken-hearted and disappointed when God did not heal my daughter. Yet, I believe she is in heaven. When I was diagnosed, I was angry with God. My lonely walks on the beach brought on another series of questions: What kind of God are you? Do you care? What do you want with my family? Even so, I never gave up my trust that God is watching over Erin.\n\n\n\nMy journey forward has been steady but difficult. It requires a willingness to participate on so many levels and I\u2019m always seeking answers. I believe that the process will lead to living my life at the highest level, regardless of the outcome. Prayer and reflection are part of my daily vigilance. I am grateful that doctors, nurses, chemotherapy, and other drugs are available. I consider these to be gifts from God. I also believe this is part of a grand plan that will give me, the cancer patient, an opportunity to fight and a chance to get well.\n\n\n\nWhen our daughter Erin died my wife, Karen, and I made our decision to fight back. We joined with others in an organization called the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation (PCRF) to raise funds for research aimed at curing pediatric cancer. I\u2019m a past president of PCRF, and currently a member of the PCRF board of directors. Karen spends countless hours on the PCRF Holiday Card Program \u2014 their major fund raising activity for the last 20 years. Our family shares the goals of PCRF.\n\n\n\nRaising funds to support research will help fight this terrible disease. Over the last 20 years the survival rate for children with cancer has more than doubled because of research. Regardless of the outcome of my disease, I know that we are making a difference in this big battle, that we are committed until cancer is defeated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links John Vallely Motivates\n\nLatest News Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/John_Vallely", "page_content": "What we do.

Eric starred as a volleyball player while he was a student at UCLA.\n\nIllness\n\nVallely was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2003. He had a single stem cell treatment which was unsuccessful. He received a second offer from a stem cell donor bank, which received a nearly exact match from a winemaker who lived near Frankfurt, Germany. This time the treatment was a success.

Indeed, the ones that do are the truly special individuals who not only make you proud to watch them, but to know them. These are the superstars who use their athletic achievements as not only building blocks, but as stepping stones to life's grander assignments. John Vallely is one such person, a man who knows how to win in life...the right way. You'll not only enjoy, but be entertained and empowered by his words and message. I am every time\". Dan Guerrero Director of Athletics\n\nUCLA\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this letter is to recommend John Vallely as an excellent public speaker. As a former teammate, I have heard him on a number of occasions, including most recently at his induction into the UCLA Hall of Fame Induction ceremony in October of 2006. He has a good message and story to tell of his own life experiences that tie into his many accomplishments in life. He has experienced many highs athletically and in his personal life, many lows. During his speech at the Hall of Fame Induction one could hear a pin drop to the floor as he covered some of the difficult parts of his life\u2019s journey.\n\n\n\nWhen one has reached the pinnacle of accomplishments athletically in basketball and beach volleyball and seen the lows in life, it is a truly compelling story. He conveys this concisely and articulately in a straightforward manner without needless whining or complaining. It is indeed inspiring to hear\". Lynn Shackelford \u201cI was uplifted by the humble message and giant heart of an athlete who has walked the walk of cancer that stole the life of his precious young daughter, Erin; yet later spared his own.\n\n\n\nI am grateful and forever changed as I journeyed in spirit with the dynamic John Vallely. The depth of his experience and good humor enlightens the struggles, doubt, loss, restored hope, triumphs, and convictions that he and we all may face as we each seek to make sense of life.\n\n\n\nJohn made me cry, he made me laugh, and he touched my soul. Give yourself the warming gift of his message--it's awesome--it will renew you!\u201d Deedreea Rich, DDS Newport Beach, California \u201cJohn's speech at his induction into the UCLA Hall of Fame was one of the most inspirational I have ever heard. It's obvious that John's passion for life and his belief in the \"Pyramid of Success\" has served him well from the glory days at UCLA to the unimaginable pain of losing a child to cancer. He tells his life story with heartfelt candor and wit, including examples of how the many facets of the \"Pyramid\" shape his daily life. I feel honored to have John as a friend, and thank him for one of the most entertaining evenings I have ever experienced.\u201d Dee DeVaney Retired Airline Pilot\n\n\u201cJohn's story moves his listeners to both tears and laughter, and his ability to weave his life's message around John Wooden's Pyramid of Success is masterful. From the pinnacles of athletic success, to the depths of despair over the death of his beautiful 12 year old daughter, to his own two life-and-death struggles with lymphoma, his faith has been shaken, renewed, and then solidified. John's commitment to useing the Pyramid of Success to face and overcome life's adversites is truly inspirational.\u201d Bob Kendall, Self-employed Mathematics Tutor Karen Kendall, School Administrator \u201cNever have I been so proud. You were on fire last night.That was the greatest moment in the history not only of UCLA Basketball but in the history of Western civilization. You have changed my life. You are an unbelievable humanitarian. I want to thank you for everything, John. You are up there with Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu, Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and John Vallely. The list is endless. Oh my gosh! What a performance! Forget the jump shot, forget the rebounds, forget the defense, forget the leadership, what you did last night was the greatest thing that any man has ever done in this world as we know it. Intergalactic transmission is the next order of the day. Please, Lets get it going. I have never been so proud. I have been 6ft 11 since I was 19 yrs old; today I have broken the 7 ft. barrier. I have reached nirvana because of you. We are so happy for you. We could not have been more honored to have been in that room last night when the future of all worlds known and unknown were changed irreversibly for the better thanks to one John Vallely. Oh, what a speech!\u201d Bill Walton Class of 1974 \u201cWhen you were speaking at the UCLA Induction Dinner,I was taking notes.\u201d Rafer Johnson Olympic Gold Medalist\n\n\u201cJohn Vallely captivated our audience and his genuine warmth and caring came through in all his words. John wove the concept of team building and relationships into everything he said and presented a talk that was interesting and motivational at the same time. Best of all, he did his homework about the group he was speaking to and included specific references about them in his talk. This personalized presentation was impressive. We have already asked him to return for two more events.\u201d Volunteer Endowment for Patient Support MD Anderson \u201cAs the speaker chairman for the Breakfast Club of Newport Beach, I can confidently say that John's presentation deeply touched everyone in our group on many levels. In telling his life's story, his ability to blend his humility, strength and humor was powerful. What our group especially appreciated was the way John wove the principles of the great John Wooden into his own life in a such an honest manner that any one could relate, even a die-hard Trojan like myself. He is truly a terrific communicator of John Wooden's principles and of his own hard won wisdom.\u201d Bob Bernatz, Ph.D. President \u2013 InsightGlobal \u201cI am grateful that John Vallely participated as one of the Distinguished Speaker\u2019s for the Volcom University. His willingness to speak to our employees and share how we may achieve competitive greatness through \u201cThe Pyramid of Success\u201d was both humbling and a learning experience. I appreciated his intimate stories and personal life experiences, proving how successful this tool has been in his life. I truly believe that everyone who attended felt inspired and learned some tips on how they could individually reach competitive greatness at work and in their personal lives. What a terrific and moving message and I would recommend anyone who wants to be motivated to listen to John speak.\u201d Tara Bennett Sr. Director of the People\u2019s Department\n\nVolcom, Inc."}, {"url": "https://dailybruin.com/2010/06/06/former-bruin-basketball-player-john-vallely-wooden", "page_content": "John Vallely, like many of coach John Wooden\u2019s players, knew Wooden\u2019s Pyramid of Success like the back of his hand.\n\nVallely, however, could never have guessed how much he would use the pyramid in his adult life.\n\n\u201cThe personal integrity, the honesty, the sincerity, of the way he shared his thoughts on life,\u201d\u009d Vallely said. \u201cIt was the direction that he gave us for dealing with these challenges and change that made such a big difference in my life in everything that I\u2019ve been involved with.\u201d\u009d\n\nVallely was a starting guard on both the 1969 and 1970 championship teams after transferring from Orange Coast College. Vallely\u2019s 1970 team was not expected to win the NCAA Championship, and they were not ranked No. 1 until after their victory in the title game over 7-foot-2-inch Artis Gilmore and the Jacksonville Dolphins.\n\n\u201cSeveral days before the Final Four began, we came into the gym where Artis Gilmore and his Jacksonville teammates were going through their practice session,\u201d\u009d Vallely said. \u201cThey had a boom box \u2026 and they had the concept of just being loose, being loose as much as you could in that environment. We watched them and thought, \u201c\u02dcThese guys are just goofing around down here.'\u201d\u009d\n\n\u201cThen, we put on our practice uniforms and went out and went through one half hour of an absolutely precise workout where there was no goofing around. The footwork was perfect, the passing was perfect, the fast breaks were so precise, and it was such a contrast from what they had prepared. It was great to be able to end up in that final game, overmatched maybe physically, but we were able to achieve so much and win the championship.\u201d\u009d\n\nCoach Wooden played a prominent role in some of Vallely\u2019s most important life decisions, such as who he chose to spend the rest of his life with.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a young 21-year-old and didn\u2019t know which way to turn and had been in a relationship with Karen, my wife, for three years \u2026 and before I could even get my question finished about what I should do, he put his finger in my chest and he said, \u201c\u02dcYou marry that girl,'\u201d\u009d Vallely said. \u201cAnd so Coach has been giving me good advice for many, many years.\u201d\u009d\n\nBut Coach Wooden\u2019s helpful advice didn\u2019t stop there for Vallely.\n\nIn 1988, Vallely\u2019s nine-year-old daughter Erin was diagnosed with cancer and passed away three years later.\n\n\u201cCoach gave all of his players a foundation to deal with challenges and change so when it came to dealing with my daughter\u2019s cancer \u2026 I would think about the characteristics of the Pyramid and how I might apply those in an uncontrollable situation,\u201d\u009d Vallely said. \u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t control the cancer but I could certainly control my attitude and I wanted to be the best I could be for my daughter Erin.\u201d\u009d\n\nVallely said that it was vital for him to latch on to the teachings of Wooden\u2019s Pyramid early on in his life to make up for some of the physical ability that he lacked on the court.\n\n\u201cI got a chance to focus on some of the concepts of the Pyramid, which is to simply be the best player I can be within that environment and Coach taught us to think like that, so I began using it right away as a 21-year-old in my life,\u201d\u009d Vallely said.\n\nWhether he was prompting him to marry his future wife or helping him make up for a talent discrepancy on the court, John Wooden has played a large role in John Vallely\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely love and will always miss our Coach Wooden,\u201d\u009d Vallely said."}, {"url": "https://new.dailybruin.com/post/former-ucla-basketball-player-leads-11th-annual-dribble-for-the-cure", "page_content": "John Vallely and his wife held their daughter in their arms.\n\nAfter fighting for two and a half years, Erin died of cancer at the age of 12.\n\nVallely \u2013 a former UCLA men\u2019s basketball player \u2013 established Dribble for the Cure at UCLA in 2008 as a way to combine his love for the sport and determination to improve cancer research.\n\nCancer has played a huge role in Vallely\u2019s life.\n\nHe began the fight of pediatric cancer with his daughter in 1988. Erin was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare cancer of the soft muscle tissue.\n\n\u201cAs a result of losing Erin that day, we\u2019ve been giving our time and funds and effort to try to change the world for these children that fight cancer,\u201d Vallely said.\n\nThe UCLA Hall of Famer fought a long battle of non-Hodgkins lymphoma himself in 2003, pulling inspiration from his daughter\u2019s perseverance in his long journey to remission.\n\nAfter undergoing multiple rounds of stem cell treatment, Vallely decided that serving as a longtime member on the board of directors for the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation wasn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201c(Vallely) had this idea,\u201d said Ashley Armstrong, an associate athletic director. \u201cAnd so he brought it to me and (Director of Athletics Dan Guerrero) and talked about wanting to partner with the basketball programs.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Dribble for the Cure debuted as an annual event hosted by UCLA. PCRF, the Cancer Research Program at Mattel Children\u2019s Hospital and UCLA Athletics put on the event for kids, students and families.\n\n\u201c(Guerrero) kind of left it up to me to decide how we wanted to do the event,\u201d Armstrong said. She was the director of student-athlete development at the time.\n\nParticipants receive pledges to raise money for pediatric cancer by dribbling a 1-mile course from Drake Stadium to Pauley Pavilion.\n\nDribble for the Cure has brought in $1,464,350 from 7,425 participants over the past 10 years. Participants raised just over $80,000 in the event\u2019s inaugural year, but has since increased in proceeds each year.\n\nSt. John\u2019s University \u2013 the only other institution that currently hosts the event \u2013 held its eighth Dribble for the Cure on Sept. 22 and has raised over $500,000 since it first ran the event in 2011.\n\nThe money raised is split evenly between PCRF and the Cancer Research Program at Mattel Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nUCLA\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball players have also played an integral role in the event, dribbling the course with the participants and signing autographs at the end.\n\n\u201cOver the last 11 years, we\u2019ve had different coaches (both men\u2019s and women\u2019s),\u201d said Ric Coy, the current director of student-athlete development. \u201cEach coach that we have brought in has totally been happily involved in this event because they see the purpose of it.\u201d\n\nCoy has been assisting Armstrong in Dribble for the Cure since 2008, but took over coordinating duties in 2016. This will be Coy\u2019s third year leading the event.\n\nStudent-athlete participation has also grown. About 100 student-athletes from men\u2019s volleyball, women\u2019s water polo and gymnastics participated in 2017. \u201cThey may not be fundraising,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cBut they\u2019re there to help out with registration, they\u2019re painting faces, they\u2019re handing out goodies, they\u2019re hanging out with the kids and participating some way in the event.\u201d\n\nOther student groups including Bruins Fighting Pediatric Cancer as well as fraternities and sororities have participated in previous years. Armstrong said local middle schools and high schools have also been participating.\n\nUCLA\u2019s 11th annual Dribble for the Cure will be held on Sunday, coincidentally falling on what would have been coach John Wooden\u2019s 108th birthday.\n\nVallely, who came to UCLA as a junior transfer out of Orange Coast College, played on Wooden\u2019s 1969 and 1970 championship teams, and was picked by the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the 1970 NBA Draft.\n\n\u201cCoach (Wooden) taught us that finding the true meaning of success in our lives would be more important than probably anything we would ever do on the basketball court,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cSo I think he would be thrilled that anything was happening in relationship to him as it relates to giving others.\u201d\n\nKids will be given backpacks with the words \u201cHappy Birthday, Coach Wooden\u201d on them to honor the former UCLA coach Sunday.\n\nAs 12 year olds dribble toward Pauley Pavilion this weekend, their efforts will make strides in the fight against pediatric cancer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve managed to help improve the survival rate in children,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cSo it\u2019s kind of cool to know that we\u2019ve had a hand in that.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.owlapps.net/owlapps_apps/articles?id=16995065&lang=en", "page_content": "John Vallely (born October 3, 1948) is an American former professional basketball player from Balboa Island, Newport Beach, California who played for UCLA and in the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n\nHigh school career\n\nVallely attended Corona del Mar High School, where he was a guard turned forward. He was selected to the all California Interscholastic Federation team and twice captured All Irvine League honors.\n\nCollege career\n\nAs a 6'2\" forward for Orange Coast College, Vallely averaged 26 points per game and broke 18 scoring records. He was selected a junior college All-American. He dribbled with his left hand and shot with his right hand. He was especially good at shooting an outside jump shot.\n\nAfter transferring to UCLA in 1968, he became an integral member of the Bruins' backcourt in 1968. Vallely was quick to make the transition from forward to guard at UCLA. In his first season, he was the Bruins' third leading scorer (12.9 ppg) and adapted smoothly to head coach John Wooden's \"attack and gamble offense\". He was a member of the UCLA teams that won national titles in the 1969 NCAA tournament and the 1970 NCAA tournament. Vallely majored in economics at UCLA and had a 3.36 grade point average as a junior.\n\nHe was selected to the twelve man 1968 Olympic trials team coached by Jerry Tarkanian which competed in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nProfessional career\n\nVallely was selected by the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the 1970 NBA draft. He sat on the bench much of the time, playing behind Pete Maravich, Lou Hudson, Walt Hazzard, and Herm Gilliam. Vallely was acquired by the Houston Rockets in November 1971 along with 6'7\" forward Jim Davis.\n\nHe served as player-coach for the Belgium Lions of the European Professional Basketball League in 1975.\n\nPersonal\n\nVallely married Karen, a woman he met at Orange Coast College, where he studied prior to attending UCLA. They wed around the time he was selected in the NBA. The couple had two children, Eric and Erin. Erin died of a rare form of cancer of the soft muscle tissue in September 1991. Eric starred as a volleyball player while he was a student at UCLA.\n\nIllness\n\nVallely was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2003. He had a single stem cell treatment which was unsuccessful. He received a second offer from a stem cell donor bank, which received a nearly exact match from a winemaker who lived near Frankfurt, Germany. This time the treatment was a success. Vallely was able to meet his donor following a two-year waiting period."}, {"url": "https://amickamookandamic.com/2022/04/john-vallely-2x-ucla-basketball-champion-joins-mick-mook-on-4-13/", "page_content": "Frank & Billy are looking forward to a visit from the legendary UCLA basketball star and a first round pick in the NBA draft, John Vallely, on the April 13th episode of A Mick A Mook and A Mic.\n\nVallely, a former NBA player and 2x NCAA Basketball Champion, was a star and All-American for the John Wooden led UCLA Bruins.
