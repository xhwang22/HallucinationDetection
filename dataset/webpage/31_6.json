But Biden was successful in the other battle, as he thwarted Bork's nomination to the high court.\n\nPlagiarism charges against Biden\n\nIt was Sept. 23, during a break in the Bork confirmation hearings, that Biden held a press conference announcing his presidential campaign was over.\n\n\"It seems to me I have a choice,\" Biden said. \"I have to choose between running for president and doing my job to keep the Supreme Court from moving in a direction that I believe to be truly harmful.\"\n\nThere's a question of how much of a choice it really was. Had he stayed in, it's not clear Biden's campaign would have been able to recover from the scandal that had enveloped it since just before the hearings began.\n\nThe month before, the Democratic presidential candidates debated at the Iowa State Fair. In his closing statement, Biden made a biographical turn, talking about why his family had remained working class for generations.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ron Edmonds/AP Ron Edmonds/AP\n\n\"Is it because they didn't work hard?\" Biden asked. \"My ancestors who worked in the coal mines of Northeast Pennsylvania and then would come up after 12 hours and play football for four hours.\"\n\n\n\nIt turns out he was paraphrasing a rousing speech-turned-campaign ad from a British Labour Party politician named Neil Kinnock.\n\n\"Was it because they were weak?\" Kinnock asked. \"Those people who could work eight hours underground and then come up and play football.\"\n\n\n\nBiden had referenced it in speeches before, with proper attribution. But this time, he made it his own. Line after line, the similarities were unmistakable.\n\nIt took a couple of weeks for the story to break, seeded by a rival campaign. But Biden had very little time to tamp down the controversy. The Bork hearings began three days later.\n\nDropping out of the presidential race\n\nAs a law professor, Bork had criticized the legal reasoning behind Supreme Court decisions on civil rights and abortion. Republicans saw his nomination as a chance to reshape the court and public policy. Democrats were determined to stop him.\n\n\"This nomination is more \u2014 with all due respect, judge, and I'm sure you agree \u2014 than about you,\" Biden said in his opening statement of the hearings.\n\nNow, hearings for Supreme Court picks last a couple of days and very little is revealed about the nominee's views. But with Bork, with Biden holding the gavel, the Judiciary Committee hearings went on for 12 long days. Bork went on at length about his judicial philosophy and his writings about the law when he was a professor at Yale University. He didn't do himself any favors.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden's campaign was in trouble. There were questions being asked about whether his slip-up with the Kinnock speech was part of a pattern, whether it said something about Biden's character.\n\nBiden went out and defended himself. \"You'll all be the judge and the people will be the judge,\" Biden said in a press conference that was at turns combative and sarcastic. \"I think this is much ado about nothing.\"\n\nThere will be other opportunities for me to campaign for president. But there will not be many other opportunities for me to influence President Reagan's choice for the Supreme Court.\n\nHe insisted he had done nothing wrong, but also said he would certainly remember to attribute the quotes to Kinnock in the future.\n\n\n\n\"Shouldn't have made much difference anyway,\" Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader, said in an interview with NPR. \"But you guys, the press, jumped on him.\"\n\n\n\nReid was a relatively junior Democratic senator at the time. But looking back, he said Biden did what he had to do.\n\n\"You could not be running for president and trying to overcome some of the things that had gone wrong and still chair that committee,\" Reid said. \"He had to get rid of the running for president or his running that committee would not have worked.\"\n\n\n\nAnd that's exactly what Biden did. On Day 8 of the Bork hearings, he announced his campaign was over.\n\n\n\n\"There will be other opportunities for me to campaign for president,\" Biden said, foreshadowing his runs in 2008 and now. \"But there will not be many other opportunities for me to influence President Reagan's choice on the Supreme Court.\"\n\nIn a way, the Bork hearings allowed Biden to save face while quitting the race. He didn't have to stand there and say he was dropping out because of the plagiarism charges. No, he had something important to do.\n\n\n\n\"This country's going to be lifted up and I'm going to play a big part in doing it,\" Biden said, referencing a refrain from his stump speech. \"But for now folks, gotta go handle the Bork hearings.\"\n\n\"Oh, Joe, you just forget that stuff\"\n\nAt some point during that difficult day, Biden called the Judiciary Committee members together behind closed doors. It was a gut check.\n\n\n\n\"It was devastating,\" said Alan Simpson, then a Republican senator from Wyoming. \"He was ambitious, as he is now, and he was running for president of the United States. And he was quite filled with angst.\"\n\n\n\nSimpson says Biden told them he was embarrassed and hurt, but took responsibility, that the \"buck stops\" with him. Biden offered to resign his chairmanship, Simpson said, if he had embarrassed the committee in any way.\n\nThere was silence in the room.\n\n\n\n\"And then old Strom Thurmond, who was ranking member, leaned over and slapped his knee and said, 'Oh, Joe, now let me tell you, just forget that stuff,' \" Simpson said, adopting a Southern accent in an impression of the late South Carolina senator.\n\n\n\nBy Simpson's telling, the senators went around the room talking about all the mistakes they had made over the years and had a good laugh.\n\n\n\nBiden had long known that trying to run the Bork hearings while running for president might end badly, said Mark Gitenstein, a longtime Biden friend and adviser who was then chief counsel on the Judiciary Committee. He remembers a contentious meeting Biden attended with civil rights leaders about the Bork nomination where they asked him: \"Which is more important, your presidential race or the Supreme Court fight?\"\n\nIn Gitenstein's retelling, Biden said, \"Without a doubt, Supreme Court fight. I'll give up my presidential race if necessary to win this fight.\"\n\nThe meeting happened months before the Kinnock controversy broke, said Gittenstein. \"And of course ultimately that's what happened.\"\n\nBork defeated\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Doug Mills/AP Doug Mills/AP\n\nAfter Biden ended his campaign in the press conference, he went back to the hearing room and swore in the next witness.\n\n\"Look, my business is behind us. Let's move on,\" Biden said after a couple of Senate colleagues piped up to offer him support.\n\nUltimately Bork's nomination failed in the Senate. It was bipartisan. Biden was able to sway a handful of moderate Republicans to vote with Democrats against Bork.\n\n\n\nReagan went on to nominate Anthony Kennedy for that Supreme Court slot. Over his generation on the court, Kennedy became a swing justice. And when it came time for the next president, George H.W. Bush, to nominate a justice, he picked David Souter because he was less ideological, with less of a paper trail than Bork, in hopes that he would be able to get get bipartisan support.\n\nGitenstein argues Biden was able to do more for progressive causes by sinking Bork than he would have been able to do as president.\n\n\n\n\"It shaped the court for 30 years on everything from saving Roe vs. Wade to, you know, the gay marriage issue,\" Gitenstein said.\n\nAnd, as Biden said the day he quit the race, there would be other presidential campaigns, and he would be there."}, {"url": "https://judiciary.house.gov/about/subcommittees/committee-judiciary-117th-congress", "page_content": "The U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary, also known as the House Judiciary Committee, is a standing committee of the U.S. House of Representatives.

This week, a local newspaper in his district, the Daily Herald, endorsed Minor in the three-way race.\n\nIllinois GOP Chairman Tim Schneider said on Thursday that it was the first time he had heard the allegations. The party has been under fire since a self-proclaimed Nazi, Arthur Jones, made it onto the ballot, running unopposed as a Republican in the 3rd Congressional District.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a GOP official has directed offensive comments toward Harold. In 2013, when Harold unsuccessfully challenged Republican U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis for Congress, a Republican county chairman called Harold a \u201cstreet walker\u201d who was a \u201clittle queen.\u201d The official resigned over the remarks.\n\n\u201cI certainly face my share of objectionable comments on the campaign trail,\u201d she said, adding she tries to face them with grace and dignity. \u201cI think black women are underrepresented. I want to win this race and to be in a position to make change. I know there are a lot of women of color who need to see their perspectives and in the leaders who serve.\u201d\n\nAccording to the campaign, Minor asked Harold: \u201cAre you a lesbo?\u201d and she replied: \u201cNo, and that\u2019s offensive.\u201d The campaign also confirmed he used the slur multiple times and she told him that was offensive.\n\n\u201cErika found it offensive and said it was offensive at the time,\u201d her spokesman, Jason Heffley, said.\n\nMinor is running for the 42nd District state House seat that is being vacated by Jeanne Ives, who is challenging Rauner in the March 20 gubernatorial primary. Also running in the primary are DuPage County Board member Amy Grant and Ryan Byrne. The district includes some of Chicago\u2019s western suburbs.\n\nMinor did not respond to a request for comment from POLITICO today. But in a recent interview with POLITICO, Minor adamantly denied using the word \u201clesbo\u201d or the racial slur.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not. No, no. I talked with Erika last night, in fact. We\u2019re friends, we support and respect each other,\u201d he told POLITICO. \u201cThere was never any inappropriate [conversation].

whereas, some AI applications have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks (e.g. legal tech), and can provide results at a drastically higher speed and wider scale;\n\nC. whereas some countries, including several Member States, make more use of AI applications, or embedded AI systems, in law enforcement and the judiciary than others, which is partly due to a lack of regulation and regulatory differences which enable or prohibit AI use for certain purposes; whereas the increasing use of AI in the criminal law field is based in particular on the promises that it would reduce certain types of crime and lead to more objective decisions; whereas these promises, however, do not always hold true;\n\nD. whereas fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the Charter should be guaranteed throughout the life cycle of AI and related technologies, notably during their design, development, deployment and use, and should apply to the enforcement of the law in all circumstances;\n\nE. whereas AI technology should be developed in such a way as to put people at its centre, be worthy of public trust and always work in the service of humans; whereas AI systems should have the ultimate guarantee of being designed so that they can always be shut down by a human operator;\n\nF. whereas AI systems need to be designed for the protection and benefit of all members of society (including consideration of vulnerable, marginalised populations in their design), be non-discriminatory, safe, their decisions be explainable and transparent, and respect human autonomy and fundamental rights, in order to be trustworthy, as described in the Ethics Guidelines of the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence;\n\nG. whereas the Union together with the Member States bears a critical responsibility for ensuring that decisions surrounding the life cycle and use of AI applications in the field of the judiciary and law enforcement are made in a transparent manner, fully safeguard fundamental rights, and in particular do not perpetuate discrimination, biases or prejudices where they exist;

whereas any blanket application of AI for the purpose of mass surveillance would be disproportionate;\n\nI. whereas the development and operation of AI systems for police and judicial authorities involves the contribution of multiple individuals, organisations, machine components, software algorithms, and human users in often complex and challenging environments; whereas the applications of AI in law enforcement and the judiciary are in different stages of development, ranging from conceptualisation through prototyping or evaluation to post-approval use; whereas new possibilities for use may arise in the future as technologies become more mature owing to ongoing scientific research worldwide;\n\nJ. whereas a clear model for assigning legal responsibility for the potential harmful effects of AI systems in the field of criminal law is imperative; whereas regulatory provisions in this field should always maintain human accountability and must aim, first and foremost, to avoid causing any harmful effects to begin with;\n\nK. whereas it is ultimately the responsibility of the Member States to guarantee the full respect of fundamental rights when AI systems are used in the field of law enforcement and the judiciary;\n\nL. whereas the relationship between protecting fundamental rights and effective policing must always be an essential element in the discussions on whether and how AI should be used by the law enforcement sector, where decisions may have long-lasting consequences on the life and freedom of individuals; whereas this is particularly important as AI has the potential to be a permanent part of our criminal justice ecosystem providing investigative analysis and assistance;\n\nM. whereas AI is in use by law enforcement in applications such as facial recognition technologies, e.g. to search suspect databases and identify victims of human trafficking or child sexual exploitation and abuse, automated number plate recognition, speaker identification, speech identification, lip-reading technologies, aural surveillance (i.e. gunshot detection algorithms), autonomous research and analysis of identified databases, forecasting (predictive policing and crime hotspot analytics), behaviour detection tools, advanced virtual autopsy tools to help determine cause of death, autonomous tools to identify financial fraud and terrorist financing, social media monitoring (scraping and data harvesting for mining connections), and automated surveillance systems incorporating different detection capabilities (such as heartbeat detection and thermal cameras); whereas the aforementioned applications, alongside other potential or future applications of AI technology in law enforcement, can have vastly varying degrees of reliability and accuracy and impact on the protection of fundamental rights and on the dynamics of criminal justice systems; whereas many of these tools are used in non-EU countries but would be illegal under the Union data protection aquis and case law; whereas the routine deployment of algorithms, even with a small false positive rate, can result in false alerts outnumbering correct alerts by far;\n\nN. whereas AI tools and applications are also used by the judiciary in several countries worldwide, including to support decisions on pre-trial detention, in sentencing, calculating probabilities for reoffending and in determining probation, online dispute resolution, case law management and the provision of facilitated access to the law; whereas this has led to distorted and diminished chances for people of colour and other minorities; whereas at present in the EU, with the exception of some Member States, their use is limited mainly to civil matters;\n\nO. whereas the use of AI in law enforcement entails a number of potentially high, and in some cases unacceptable, risks for the protection of fundamental rights of individuals, such as opaque decision-making, different types of discrimination and errors inherent in the underlying algorithm which can be reinforced by feedback loops, as well as risks to the protection of privacy and personal data, the protection of freedom of expression and information, the presumption of innocence, the right to an effective remedy and a fair trial, as well as risks for the freedom and security of individuals;\n\nP. whereas AI systems used by law enforcement and the judiciary are also vulnerable to AI-empowered attacks against information systems or data poisoning, whereby a wrong data set is included on purpose in order to produce biased results; whereas in these situations the resulting damage is potentially even more significant, and can result in exponentially greater levels of harm to both individuals and groups;\n\nQ. whereas, the deployment of AI in the field of law enforcement and the judiciary should not be seen as a mere technical feasibility, but rather a political decision concerning the design and the objectives of law enforcement and of criminal justice systems; whereas modern criminal law is based on the idea that authorities react to an offence after it has been committed, without assuming that all people are dangerous and need to be constantly monitored in order to prevent potential wrongdoing; whereas AI-based surveillance techniques deeply challenge this approach and render it urgent that legislators worldwide thoroughly assess the consequences of allowing the deployment of technologies that diminish the role of human beings in law enforcement and adjudication;\n\n1. Reiterates that, as processing large quantities of personal data is at the heart of AI, the right to the protection of private life and the right to the protection of personal data apply to all areas of AI, and that the Union legal framework for data protection and privacy must be fully complied with; recalls, therefore that the EU has already established data protection standards for law enforcement, which form the foundation for any future regulation in AI for the use of law enforcement and the judiciary; recalls that processing of personal data should be lawful and fair, the purposes of processing should be specified, explicit and legitimate, processing should be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose for which is it processed, it should be accurate, kept up to date and inaccurate data should, unless restrictions apply, be corrected or erased, data should not be kept longer than is necessary, clear and appropriate time limits should be established for erasure or for periodic review of the need for storage of such data, and it should be processed in a secure manner; underlines also that possible identification of individuals by an AI application using data that was previously anonymised, should be prevented;\n\n2. Reaffirms that all AI solutions for law enforcement and the judiciary also need to fully respect the principles of human dignity, non-discrimination, freedom of movement, the presumption of innocence and right of defence, including the right to silence, freedom of expression and information, freedom of assembly and of association, equality before the law, the principle of equality of arms and the right to an effective remedy and a fair trial, in accordance with the Charter and the European Convention on Human Rights; stresses that use of AI applications must be prohibited when incompatible with fundamental rights;\n\n3. Acknowledges that the speed at which AI applications are being developed around the world does not allow for an exhaustive listing of applications and thus necessitates a clear and coherent governance model guaranteeing both the fundamental rights of individuals and legal clarity for developers, considering the continuous evolution of technology; considers, however, given the role and responsibility of police and judicial authorities, and the impact of decisions they take for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, that the use of AI applications has to be categorised as high-risk in instances where there is the potential to significantly affect the lives of individuals;\n\n4. Considers, in this regard, that any AI tools either developed or used by law enforcement or the judiciary should, as a minimum, be safe, robust, secure and fit for purpose, respect the principles of fairness, data minimisation, accountability, transparency, non-discrimination and explainability, and that their development, deployment and use should be subject to risk assessment and strict necessity and proportionality testing, where safeguards need to be proportionate to the identified risks; highlights that trust among citizens in the use of AI developed, deployed and used in the EU is conditional upon the full fulfilment of these criteria;\n\n5. Acknowledges the positive contribution of certain types of AI applications to the work of law enforcement and judicial authorities across the Union; highlights, as an example, the enhanced case law management achieved by tools allowing for additional search options; believes that there is a range of other potential uses for AI for law enforcement and the judiciary which could be explored while taking into consideration the five principles of the Ethical Charter on the use of artificial intelligence in judicial systems and their environment, adopted by the CEPEJ, and paying particular attention to the \u2018uses to be considered with the most extreme reservation\u2019, identified by the CEPEJ;\n\n6. Underlines that any technology can be repurposed and therefore calls for strict democratic control and independent oversight of any AI-enabled technology in use by law enforcement and judicial authorities, especially those that can be repurposed for mass surveillance or mass profiling; notes, thus, with great concern the potential of certain AI technologies used in the law enforcement sector for mass surveillance purposes; highlights the legal requirement to prevent mass surveillance by means of AI technologies, which by definition does not fulfil the principles of necessity and proportionality, and to ban the use of applications that could result in it;\n\n7. Emphasises that the approach taken in some non-EU countries regarding the development, deployment and use of mass surveillance technologies disproportionately interferes with fundamental rights and thus is not to be followed by the EU; stresses therefore that safeguards against the misuse of AI technologies by law enforcement and judicial authorities also need to be regulated uniformly across the Union;\n\n8. Stresses the potential for bias and discrimination arising from the use of AI applications such as machine learning, including the algorithms on which such applications are based; notes that biases can be inherent in underlying datasets, especially when historical data is being used, introduced by the developers of the algorithms, or generated when the systems are implemented in real world settings; points out that the results provided by AI applications are necessarily influenced by the quality of the data used, and that such inherent biases are inclined to gradually increase and thereby perpetuate and amplify existing discrimination, in particular for persons belonging to certain ethnic groups or racialised communities;\n\n9. Underlines the fact that many algorithmically driven identification technologies currently in use disproportionately misidentify and misclassify and therefore cause harm to racialised people, individuals belonging to certain ethnic communities, LGBTI people, children and the elderly, as well as women; recalls that individuals not only have the right to be correctly identified, but they also have the right not to be identified at all, unless it is required by law for compelling and legitimate public interests; stresses that AI predictions based on characteristics of a specific group of persons end up amplifying and reproducing existing forms of discrimination; considers that strong efforts should be made to avoid automated discrimination and bias; calls for robust additional safeguards where AI systems in law enforcement or the judiciary are used on or in relation to minors;\n\n10. Highlights the power asymmetry between those who employ AI technologies and those who are subject to them; stresses that it is imperative that use of AI tools by law enforcement and judicial authorities does not become a factor of inequality, social fracture or exclusion; underlines the impact of the use of AI tools on the defence rights of suspects, the difficulty in obtaining meaningful information on their functioning and the consequent difficulty in challenging their results in court, in particular by individuals under investigation;\n\n11. Takes note of the risks related in particular to data leaks, data security breaches and unauthorised access to personal data and other information related to, for example. criminal investigations or court cases that is processed by AI systems; underlines that security and safety aspects of AI systems used in law enforcement and by the judiciary need to be considered carefully and be sufficiently robust and resilient to prevent the potentially catastrophic consequences of malicious attacks on AI systems; stresses the importance of security by design, as well as specific human oversight before operating certain critical applications and therefore calls for law enforcement and judicial authorities only to use AI applications that adhere to the privacy and data protection by design principle in order to avoid function creep;\n\n12. Stresses that no AI system used by law enforcement or the judiciary should be enabled to harm the physical integrity of human beings, nor to distribute rights or impose legal obligations on individuals;\n\n13. Recognises the challenges to the correct location of legal responsibility and liability for potential harm, given the complexity of development and operation of AI systems; considers it necessary to create a clear and fair regime for assigning legal responsibility and liability for the potential adverse consequences produced by these advanced digital technologies; underlines, however, that the aim must, first and foremost, be to prevent any such consequences materialising to begin with; calls, therefore, for the application of the precautionary principle in all applications of AI in the context of law enforcement; underlines that legal responsibility and liability must always rest with a natural or legal person, who must always be identified for decisions taken with the support of AI; emphasises, therefore, the need to ensure the transparency of the corporate structures that produce and manage AI systems;\n\n14. Considers it essential, both for the effectiveness of the exercise of defence rights and for the transparency of national criminal justice systems, that a specific, clear and precise legal framework regulates the conditions, modalities and consequences of the use of AI tools in the field of law enforcement and the judiciary, as well as the rights of targeted persons, and effective and easily available complaint and redress procedures, including judicial redress; underlines the right of the parties to a criminal proceeding to have access to the data collection process and the related assessments made by or obtained through the use of AI applications; underlines the need for executing authorities involved in judicial cooperation, when deciding on a request for extradition (or surrender) to another Member State or non-EU country, to assess whether the use of AI tools in the requesting country might manifestly compromise the fundamental right to a fair trial; calls on the Commission to issue guidelines on how to conduct such an assessment in the context of judicial cooperation in criminal matters; insists that Member States, in accordance with applicable laws, should ensure that individuals are informed when they are subject to the use of AI applications by law enforcement authorities or the judiciary;\n\n15. Points out that if humans only rely on the data, profiles and recommendations generated by machines, they will not be able to conduct an independent assessment; highlights the potentially grave adverse consequences, specifically in the area of law enforcement and justice, when individuals overly trust in the seemingly objective and scientific nature of AI tools and fail to consider the possibility of their results being incorrect, incomplete, irrelevant or discriminatory; emphasises that over-reliance on the results provided by AI systems should be avoided, and stresses the need for authorities to build confidence and knowledge to question or override an algorithmic recommendation; considers it important to have realistic expectations on such technological solutions and not to promise perfect law enforcement solutions and detection of all offences committed;\n\n16. Underlines that in judicial and law enforcement contexts, the decision giving legal or similar effect always needs to be taken by a human, who can be held accountable for the decisions made; considers that those subject to AI-powered systems must have recourse to remedy; recalls that, under EU law, a person has the right not to be subjected to a decision which produces legal effects concerning them or significantly affects them and is based solely on automated data processing; underlines further that automated individual decision-making must not be based on special categories of personal data, unless suitable measures to safeguard the data subject\u2019s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests are in place; stresses that EU law prohibits profiling that results in discrimination against natural persons on the basis of special categories of personal data; highlights that decisions in the field of law enforcement are almost always decisions that have a legal effect on the person concerned, owing to the executive nature of law enforcement authorities and their actions; notes that the use of AI may influence human decisions and have an impact on all phases of criminal procedures; takes the view, therefore, that authorities making use of AI systems need to uphold extremely high legal standards and ensure human intervention, especially when analysing data deriving from such systems; requires therefore the sovereign discretion of judges and decision-making on a case-by-case basis to be upheld; calls for a ban on the use of AI and related technologies for proposing judicial decisions;\n\n17. Calls for algorithmic explainability, transparency, traceability and verification as a necessary part of oversight, in order to ensure that the development, deployment and use of AI systems for the judiciary and law enforcement comply with fundamental rights, and are trusted by citizens, as well as in order to ensure that results generated by AI algorithms can be rendered intelligible to users and to those subject to these systems, and that there is transparency on the source data and how the system arrived at a certain conclusion; points out that in order to ensure technical transparency, robustness, and accuracy, only such tools and systems should be allowed to be purchased by law enforcement or judiciary authorities in the Union whose algorithms and logic is auditable and accessible at least to the police and the judiciary as well as the independent auditors, to allow for their evaluation, auditing and vetting, and that they must not be closed or labelled as proprietary by the vendors; points out, furthermore, that documentation should be provided in clear, intelligible language about the nature of the service, the tools developed, the performance and conditions under which they can be expected to function and the risks that they might cause; calls therefore on judicial and law enforcement authorities to provide for proactive and full transparency on private companies providing them with AI systems for the purposes of law enforcement and the judiciary; recommends therefore the use of open source software where possible;\n\n18. Encourages law enforcement and judicial authorities to identify and assess the areas where some tailor-made AI solutions might be beneficial and to exchange best practices on AI deployment; calls for the adoption by Member States and EU agencies of appropriate public procurement processes for AI systems when used in a law enforcement or judicial context, so as to ensure their compliance with fundamental rights and applicable legislation, including ensuring that software documentation and algorithms are available and accessible to the competent and supervisory authorities for review; calls, in particular, for binding rules requiring public disclosure on public-private partnerships, contracts and acquisitions and the purpose for which they are procured; stresses the need to provide the authorities with the necessary funding, as well as to equip them with the necessary expertise to guarantee full compliance with the ethical, legal and technical requirements attached to any AI deployment;\n\n19. Calls for traceability of AI systems and the decision-making process that outlines their functions, defines the capabilities and limitations of the systems, and keeps track of where the defining attributes for a decision originate, through compulsory documentation; underlines the importance of keeping full documentation of training data, its context, purpose, accuracy and side effects, as well as its processing by the builders and developers of the algorithms and its compliance with fundamental rights; highlights that it must always be possible to reduce the computations of an AI system to a form that is comprehensible to humans;\n\n20. Calls for a compulsory fundamental rights impact assessment to be conducted prior to the implementation or deployment of any AI systems for law enforcement or the judiciary, in order to assess any potential risks to fundamental rights; recalls that the prior data protection impact assessment is mandatory for any type of processing, in particular, using new technologies, that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and is of the opinion that this is the case for most AI technologies in the area of law enforcement and judiciary; underlines the expertise of data protection authorities and fundamental rights agencies in assessing these systems; stresses that these fundamental rights impact assessments should be conducted as openly as possible and with the active engagement of civil society; demands that the impact assessments also clearly define the safeguards necessary to address the identified risks and that they be made, to the greatest extent possible, publicly available before the deployment of any AI system;\n\n21. Stresses that only robust European AI governance with independent evaluation can enable the necessary operationalisation of fundamental rights principles; calls for periodic mandatory auditing of all AI systems used by law enforcement and the judiciary where there is the potential to significantly affect the lives of individuals, by an independent authority, to test and evaluate algorithmic systems, their context, purpose, accuracy, performance and scale, and, once they are in operation, in order to detect, investigate, diagnose and rectify any unwanted and adverse effects and to ensure the AI systems are performing as intended; calls therefore for a clear institutional framework for this purpose, including proper regulatory and supervisory oversight, to ensure full implementation and to guarantee a fully informed democratic debate on the necessity and proportionality of AI in the field of criminal justice; underlines that the results of these audits should be made available in public registers so that citizens know the AI systems being deployed and which measures are taken to remedy any violation of fundamental rights;\n\n22. Stresses that the datasets and algorithmic systems used when making classifications, assessments and predictions at the different stages of data processing in the development of AI and related technologies may also result in differential treatment and both direct and indirect discrimination of groups of people, especially as data used to train predictive policing algorithms reflects ongoing surveillance priorities and consequently may end up reproducing and amplifying current biases; emphasises therefore that AI technologies, especially when deployed for the use of law enforcement and the judiciary, require inter-disciplinary research and input, including from the fields of science and technology studies, critical race studies, disability studies, and other disciplines attuned to social context, including how difference is constructed, the work of classification, and its consequences; stresses the need therefore to systematically invest in integrating these disciplines into AI study and research at all levels; stresses also the importance for the teams that design, develop, test, maintain, deploy and procure these AI systems for law enforcement and judiciary of reflecting, where possible, the diversity of society in general as a non-technical means to reduce the risks of discrimination;\n\n23. Highlights further that adequate accountability, responsibility, and liability require significant specialised training with regard to the ethical provisions, potential dangers, limitations, and proper use of AI technology, especially for police and judiciary personnel; emphasises that suitable professional training and qualifications should ensure that decision-makers are trained about the potential for bias, as the data sets may be based on discriminatory and prejudiced data; supports the establishment of awareness-raising and educational initiatives to ensure that individuals working in law enforcement and the judiciary are aware of and understand the limitations, capabilities and risks that the use of AI systems entails, including the risk of automation bias; recalls that the inclusion in AI training data sets of instances of racism by police forces in fulfilling their duties will inevitably lead to racist bias in AI-generated findings, scores, and recommendations; reiterates its call on Member States, therefore, to promote anti-discrimination policies and to develop national action plans against racism in the field of policing and the justice system;\n\n24. Notes that predictive policing is among the AI applications used in the area of law enforcement, but warns that while predictive policing can analyse the given data sets for the identification of patterns and correlations, it cannot answer the question of causality and cannot make reliable predictions on individual behaviour, and therefore cannot constitute the sole basis for an intervention; points out that several cities in the United States have ended their use of predictive policing systems after audits; recalls that during the LIBE Committee\u2019s mission to the United States in February 2020, Members were informed by the police departments of New York City and Cambridge, Massachusetts, that they had phased out their predictive policing programmes due to a lack of effectiveness, discriminatory impact and practical failure, and had turned instead to community policing; notes that this has led to a decline in crime rates; opposes, therefore, the use of AI by law enforcement authorities to make behavioural predictions on individuals or groups on the basis of historical data and past behaviour, group membership, location, or any other such characteristics, thereby attempting to identify people likely to commit a crime;\n\n25. Notes the different types of use of facial recognition, such as, but not limited to, verification/authentication (i.e. matching a live face to a photo in an ID document, e.g. smart borders), identification (i.e. matching a photo against a set database of photos) and detection (i.e. detecting faces in real time from sources such as CCTV footage, and matching them to databases, e.g. real-time surveillance), each of which carry different implications for the protection of fundamental rights; strongly believes that the deployment of facial recognition systems by law enforcement should be limited to clearly warranted purposes in full respect of the principles of proportionality and necessity and the applicable law; reaffirms that as a minimum, the use of facial recognition technology must comply with the requirements of data minimisation, data accuracy, storage limitation, data security and accountability, as well as being lawful, fair and transparent, and following a specific, explicit and legitimate purpose that is clearly defined in Member State or Union law; is of the opinion verification and authentication systems can only continue to be deployed and used successfully if their adverse effects can be mitigated and the above criteria fulfilled;\n\n26. Calls, furthermore, for the permanent prohibition of the use of automated analysis and/or recognition in publicly accessible spaces of other human features, such as gait, fingerprints, DNA, voice, and other biometric and behavioural signals;\n\n27. Calls, however, for a moratorium on the deployment of facial recognition systems for law enforcement purposes that have the function of identification, unless strictly used for the purpose of identification of victims of crime, until the technical standards can be considered fully fundamental rights compliant, results derived are non-biased and non-discriminatory, the legal framework provides strict safeguards against misuse and strict democratic control and oversight, and there is empirical evidence of the necessity and proportionality for the deployment of such technologies; notes that where the above criteria are not fulfilled, the systems should not be used or deployed;\n\n28. Expresses its great concern over the use of private facial recognition databases by law enforcement actors and intelligence services, such as Clearview AI, a database of more than three billion pictures that have been collected illegally from social networks and other parts of the internet, including from EU citizens; calls on Member States to oblige law enforcement actors to disclose whether they are using Clearview AI technology, or equivalent technologies from other providers; recalls the opinion of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) that the use of a service such as Clearview AI by law enforcement authorities in the European Union would \u2018likely not be consistent with the EU data protection regime\u2019; calls for a ban on the use of private facial recognition databases in law enforcement;\n\n29. Takes note of the Commission\u2019s feasibility study on possible changes to the Pr\u00fcm Decision[8], including regarding facial images; takes note of earlier research that no potential new identifiers, e.g. iris or facial recognition, would be as reliable in a forensic context as DNA or fingerprints; reminds the Commission that any legislative proposal must be evidence based and respect the principle of proportionality; urges the Commission not to extend the Pr\u00fcm Decision framework unless there is solid scientific evidence of the reliability of facial recognition in a forensic context compared to DNA or fingerprints, after it has conducted a full impact assessment, and taking into account the recommendations of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and EDPB;\n\n30. Stresses that the use of biometric data relates more broadly to the principle of the right to human dignity forming the basis of all fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter; considers that the use and collection of any biometric data for remote identification purposes, for example by conducting facial recognition in public places, as well as at automatic border control gates used for border checks at airports, may pose specific risks to fundamental rights, the implications of which could vary considerably depending on the purpose, context and scope of use; further highlights the contested scientific validity of affect recognition technology, such as cameras detecting eye movements and changes in pupil size, in a law enforcement context; is of the view that the use of biometric identification in the context of law enforcement and the judiciary should always be considered \u2018high risk\u2019 and therefore be subjected to additional requirements, as per the recommendations of the Commission\u2019s High-Level Expert Group on AI;\n\n31. Expresses strong concern over research projects financed under Horizon 2020 that deploy artificial intelligence on external borders, such as the iBorderCtrl project, a \u2018smart lie-detection system\u2019 profiling travellers on the basis of a computer-automated interview taken by the traveller\u2019s webcam before the trip, and an artificial intelligence-based analysis of 38 microgestures, tested in Hungary, Latvia and Greece; calls on the Commission, therefore, to implement, through legislative and non-legislative means, and if necessary through infringement proceedings, a ban on any processing of biometric data, including facial images, for law enforcement purposes that leads to mass surveillance in publicly accessible spaces; calls further on the Commission to stop funding biometric research or deployment or programmes that are likely to result in indiscriminate mass surveillance in public spaces; highlights, in this context, that special attention should be paid, and a strict framework applied, to the use of drones in police operations;\n\n32. Supports the recommendations of the Commission\u2019s High-Level Expert Group on AI advocating for a ban on AI-enabled mass scale scoring of individuals; considers that any form of normative citizen scoring on a large scale by public authorities, in particular within the field of law enforcement and the judiciary, leads to the loss of autonomy, endangers the principle of non-discrimination and cannot be considered in line with fundamental rights, in particular human dignity, as codified in EU law;\n\n33. Calls for greater overall transparency in order to form a comprehensive understanding regarding the use of AI applications in the Union; requests that Member States provide comprehensive information on the tools used by their law enforcement and judicial authorities, the types of tools in use, the purposes for which they are used, the types of crime they are applied to, and the names of the companies or organisations that developed those tools; calls on law enforcement and judicial authorities also to inform the public and provide sufficient transparency as to their use of AI and related technologies when implementing their powers, including disclosure of false positive and false negative rates of the technology in question; requests that the Commission compile and update the information in a single place; calls on the Commission to also publish and update information concerning the use of AI by the Union agencies charged with law enforcement and judicial tasks; calls on the EDPB to assess the legality of these AI technologies and applications in use by law enforcement authorities and the judiciary;\n\n34. Recalls that AI applications, including those used in the context of law enforcement and the judiciary, are being developed globally at a rapid pace; urges all European stakeholders, including the Member States and the Commission, to ensure, through international cooperation, the engagement of partners outside the EU in order to raise standards at international level and to find a common and complementary legal and ethical framework for the use of AI, in particular for law enforcement and the judiciary, that fully respects the Charter, the European data protection acquis and human rights more widely;\n\n35. Calls for the EU Fundamental Rights Agency, in collaboration with the EDPB and the EDPS, to draft comprehensive guidelines, recommendations and best practices in order to further specify the criteria and conditions for the development, use and deployment of AI applications and solutions for use by law enforcement and judicial authorities; undertakes to conduct a study on the implementation of the Law Enforcement Directive[9] in order to identify how the protection of personal data has been ensured in processing activities by law enforcement and judicial authorities, particularly when developing or deploying new technologies; calls on the Commission, furthermore, to consider whether specific legislative action on further specifying the criteria and conditions for the development, use and deployment of AI applications and solutions by law enforcement and judicial authorities is needed;\n\n36.

The full House of Representatives would need to vote to impeach Trump before the Senate can begin debating whether to remove him from office.\n\nToday\u2019s hearing will not feature witnesses who can testify about Trump\u2019s efforts to push Ukraine to investigate his political enemies. Instead, it is scheduled to include four legal scholars \u2014 three chosen by Democrats, one by Republicans \u2014 to discuss the \u201cconstitutional grounds for presidential impeachment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMelania, Republicans outraged by Barron Trump reference\n\nUpdated: 2:28 p.m. PT\n\nProfessor Pamela Karlan mentioned President Trump\u2019s son, Barron, during the Judiciary Committee hearing, prompting a barrage of backlash from Republicans.\n\nKarlan, a Stanford Law School professor, was making the point that the Constitution doesn\u2019t give the president the power to do whatever he wants, such as give someone a title of nobility. \u201cSo, while the president can name his son Barron, he can\u2019t make him a baron,\u201d she said.\n\nThe mention of the president\u2019s 13-year-old son prompted outrage from Republicans on the panel, including Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, and the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cA minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics,\u201d First Lady Melania Trump said on Twitter. \u201cPamela Karlan, you should be ashamed of your very angry and obviously biased public pandering, and using a child to do it.\u201d\n\nKarlan later apologized for the remarks. \u201cIt was wrong of me to do that,\u201d she said, adding that she wished the president would apologize for \u201csome\u201d of his behavior. \u201cBut I do regret having said that.\u201d\n\nA minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics.

In the prior elections, he voted for Democratic Presidents Clinton and Obama.)\n\nStill, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla) and others focused their ire at the three witnesses called by Democrats.\n\n\u201cI do not have contempt for conservatives,\u201d said Prof. Pamela Karlan, when Gaetz suggested she did. The congressman and professor then spoke over each other until he complained, \u201cYou don\u2019t get to interrupt me on this time.\u201d\n\nRep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) alleged that the constitutional scholars had a partisan agenda, \u201cWhat I\u2019m suggesting to you today is a reckless bias coming in here.\u201d\n\nKarlan pointed out that contributions to political campaigns are protected under the First Amendment as free speech -- in contrast to foreign interference or foreign contributions in U.S. elections, which are prohibited by law.\n\n\u201cI apologize for getting a little overheated a moment ago,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have a constitutional right under the First Amendment to give money to candidates, at the same time we have a constitutional duty to keep foreigners from spending money in elections, and those are two sides of the same coin.\u201d\n\n-- Molly O\u2019Toole\n\nJudiciary members: long on speeches, short on questions\n\nMembers of the House Judiciary Committee get five minutes each to ask questions of witnesses as part of the day\u2019s impeachment hearing.\n\nBut many are giving speeches rather than questioning the four constitutional scholars brought in to testify.\n\nMost members who queried the witnesses simply asked for confirmation of their own position.\n\n\u201cLet me go with a few examples and see if you agree with me,\u201d Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) prompted Jonathan Turley, the George Washington University law professor brought by Republicans, asking if certain actions by previous presidents would be an abuse of power.\n\nTelevised congressional hearings, especially in Judiciary, which has some of the most conservative and liberal members of Congress, can devolve quickly into speechifying and pontificating as some lawmakers try to get TV soundbites that can be used for reelection campaigns.\n\nBut the hearing is far from over. With 41 members, the Judiciary Committee is one of the largest in Congress, and at least half still are waiting their turn to speak.\n\n-- Sarah D. Wire\n\nMeanwhile, in Ukraine ...\n\nUpdated: 10:41 a.m. PT\n\nDemocrats and Republicans sparred in the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s first impeachment hearing, battling over whether Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to conduct investigations into his political rivals constituted impeachable offenses.\n\nMeanwhile, in Ukraine, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, met with former government officials in what he said was an effort to undermine the impeachment inquiry and continue his crusade to dig up dirt on those same Democratic rivals, according to the New York Times.\n\n\u201cLike a good lawyer, I am gathering evidence to defend my client against the false charges being leveled against him,\u201d Giuliani wrote the New York Times in a text message on Wednesday.\n\nGiuliani did not respond to requests for comment from the Los Angeles Times. It\u2019s unclear whether he briefed Trump, who has been in London since Monday for a two-day NATO summit, about his travel plans.\n\nGiuliani canceled a trip to Ukraine last spring after he was heavily criticized, and State Department officials are tracking his current sojourn with concern due to the ongoing scrutiny, the New York Times reported.\n\nBoth impeachment investigators and federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York are looking at Giuliani\u2019s activities with Ukraine, in part to determine whether he violated laws regarding lobbying for a foreign country.\n\n\u201cIf S.D.N.Y. leaks and Democrats\u2019 threats stopped me then I should find a new profession,\u201d Giuliani told the New York Times.\n\nAfter a stop in Budapest, Giuliani traveled to Kiev, Ukraine\u2019s capital. He met with former Ukrainian prosecutors who have faced allegations of corruption and promoted unfounded claims about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, as well as the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAlong for the ride were reporters for conservative television outlet One America News Network, promoting a documentary series that OANN says is \u201cDebunking Schiff\u2019s Impeachment Narrative\u201d with \u201cfirst-hand witnesses.\u201d\n\n-- Molly O\u2019Toole\n\nDemocrats \u2018want to set the record for fastest impeachment,\u2019 law expert says\n\nUpdated: 10:32 a.m. PT\n\nJonathan Turley, the George Washington University Law School expert called by Republicans, said Democrats are moving too quickly on impeachment and haven\u2019t taken the time to prove their case. He said their case is thin compared to the voluminous evidence presented against Presidents Clinton and Nixon during their impeachment battles.\n\n\u201cIt has not been explained to me why you want to set the record for the fastest impeachment,\u201d Turley said. \u201cYou need to stick the landing on quid pro quo.\u201d\n\nHe warned that the American public isn\u2019t behind the idea of impeaching Trump, noting that public sentiment eventually turned to favor impeachment during the longer Nixon impeachment inquiry. The Judiciary Committee held several hearings over six months when considering articles against Nixon. It held just four hearings over two days when considering the Clinton impeachment articles in 1998.\n\n\u201cIf you rush this impeachment, you\u2019re going to leave half the country behind,\u201d Turley said. \u201cThis is not an impulse buy item.\u201d\n\n-- Sarah D. Wire\n\nDemocrats narrow questions onto likely articles of impeachment\n\nUpdated: 9:58 a.m. PT\n\nOver 45 minutes of questions, Democrats focused on three areas of what they consider President Trump\u2019s offenses, suggesting the basis of likely articles of impeachment.\n\n\u201cWe talked first about abuse of power and bribery and then about obstruction of Congress. Now\u2026 a third impeachable offense [and] that is obstruction of justice,\u201d Norm Eisen, the Democratic counsel, said as a form of summary.\n\nEisen focused his questions on the three legal scholar witnesses who were brought forward by Democrats to reinforce their argument. The questions focused on whether Trump abused his office while pressuring Ukraine to begin an investigation into the Bidens and whether it could be identified as a form of bribery, which is specifically listed in the constitution as an impeachable offense. The professors were also quizzed on whether the president obstructed justice and obstructed Congress.\n\n-- Jennifer Haberkorn\n\nDemocrats steer clear of Republican witness\n\nUpdated: 9:45 a.m. PT\n\nCommittee counsel Norm Eisen led Democrats\u2019 questioning of the legal experts, but almost entirely ignored Jonathan Turley, the sole witness called by Republicans.\n\nTurley was the only member of the panel who cautioned the House of Representatives against impeaching President Trump, suggesting that the evidence did not support such a step.\n\nEisen clearly had no use for that argument, directing nearly all of his queries to the other legal scholars. He did, however, ask Turley a question about a Wall Street Journal column he had written.\n\nDid Turley write that impeachable offenses did not need to be violations of criminal law? Eisen asked. Turley confirmed his writing, but Eisen quickly cut him off when Turley tried to elaborate on his column, which argued that Trump should not be impeached.\n\n-- Chris Megerian\n\nTrump questions panel\u2019s loyalty: \u2018Do they love our country?\u2019\n\nFrom London, where he\u2019s taking part in a two-day NATO summit, President Trump denounced the Judiciary Committee\u2019s impeachment hearing, calling it a \u201cjoke\u201d that is harmful to the country.\n\n\u201cYou almost question whether or not they love our country, and that\u2019s a very serious thing: Do they love our country?\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump is scheduled to return Wednesday night after the hearing ends. He was invited to attend or send an attorney to question the witnesses, but declined.\n\n\u201cThe word impeachment is a dirty word,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat should only be used in special occasions.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sarah D. Wire\n\nRepublican tactic: Demand votes and kill time\n\nUpdated: 8:37 a.m. PT\n\nThe Judiciary hearing started with a sharp partisan bent, with Republicans immediately demanding a vote on whether House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) should be required to testify.\n\nThe vote failed along partisan lines and provided a preview of a delay tactic Republicans are expected to use repeatedly in today\u2019s hearing. Nearly one hour into the hearing, several Republican lawmakers have already tried to pause the opening speeches to demand votes on motions. Democrats are expected to be able to vote down all of the procedural motions, but they each eat up time.\n\nChairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) tried to frame the hearing in its historical context as the panel that traditionally leads impeachment inquiries.\n\n\u201cThis Committee has voted to impeach two presidents for obstructing justice. We have voted to impeach one president for obstructing a congressional investigation. To the extent that President Trump\u2019s conduct fits these categories, there is precedent for recommending impeachment here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut never before, in the history of the republic, have we been forced to consider the conduct of a president who appears to have solicited personal, political favors from a foreign government.\u201d\n\nRep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), the top Republican on the committee, blasted the hearing, criticizing Democrats for bringing in a panel of law professors who should be preparing for finals. He also accused the Judiciary hearing for merely acting as a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for the report written by the Intelligence Committee.\n\n\u201cThe clock and the calendar are driving this. Not the facts,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Jennifer Haberkorn\n\nStanford professor snaps back at Georgia lawmaker\n\nUpdated: 8:26 a.m. PT\n\nPamela S. Karlan, a professor at Stanford Law School, has represented the Judiciary Committee before the Supreme Court. An expert on voting rights, she framed Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine as \u201cdemanding\u201d foreign involvement in the 2020 presidential election, arguing they rise to impeachable offenses.\n\n\u201cThat demand constituted an abuse of power,\u201d she said. \u201cDrawing a foreign government into our election process is an especially serious abuse of power because it undermines democracy itself.\u201d\n\nShe referred to Russian interference in the last election cycle, saying, \u201cWhat happened in 2016 was bad enough.\u201d What Trump should\u2019ve said then, she continued, was \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, butt out of our elections.\u201d\u201d\n\nAmid that argument, she chided the committee\u2019s senior Republican, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, who said in his opening statement that the witnesses could not have had time to review all the evidence in the case. She has read every transcript released in the impeachment inquiry, Karlan said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m insulted by the suggestion that as a law professor, I don\u2019t care about those facts,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2014 Molly O\u2019Toole\n\nLaw professor testifying today also appeared as witness in Clinton impeachment\n\nUpdated: 7:38 a.m. PT\n\nJonathan Turley, a professor of public interest law at George Washington University law school, found himself in a familiar place Tuesday morning: testifying before the House Judiciary Committee as part of impeachment proceedings against a president.\n\nMore than two decades ago, Turley was a witness in the impeachment of Democratic President Bill Clinton. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a longtime member of the powerful committee and now its chairman, was also present.\n\nClinton was ultimately impeached by the House, but acquitted in the Senate trial \u2014 a likely outcome for Trump, with a Democratic majority in the House but GOP control of the Senate.\n\n\u201cI never thought that I would have to appear a second time to address the same question with regard to another sitting president,\u201d Turley, who was called as a witness by the committee\u2019s Republican minority, wrote in his prepared remarks. \u201cThe intense rancor and rage of the public debate is the same.\u201d\n\nHe made clear he wasn\u2019t a Trump supporter, but also wrote, \u201cIn truth, I have not held much fondness for any president in my lifetime.\u201d\n\nIn his prepared statements in 1998, he issued a stark warning.\n\n\u201cCrime is contagious,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the government becomes a lawbreaker; it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto itself; it invites anarchy.\u201d\n\nThis time, he found himself on the other side. The case for impeachment against Trump is \u201cnot just woefully inadequate, but in some respects, dangerous,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am concerned about lowering impeachment standards to fit a paucity of evidence and an abundance of anger.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Molly O\u2019Toole\n\nLegal expert: Trump\u2019s actions were worse than those of any prior president who faced impeachment proceedings\n\nUpdated: 7:26 a.m. PT\n\nOne of the constitutional law experts testifying before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday will tell members that President Trump\u2019s conduct is worse than that of any prior president who faced similar proceedings.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cserious misconduct\u201d includes \u201cbribery, soliciting a personal favor from a foreign leader in exchange for his exercise of power, and obstructing justice and Congress,\u201d Michael Gerhardt, a law professor at the University of North Carolina, will say according to his prepared remarks. Those transgressions \u201care worse than the misconduct of any prior president, including what previous presidents who faced impeachment have done or been accused of doing,\u201d Gerhardt plans to say.\n\nGerhardt, who also testified to lawmakers while they considered impeaching President Clinton, plans to tell lawmakers that when constitutional law is applied to the facts of the Mueller report and the evidence gathered in the impeachment inquiry, \u201cI cannot help but conclude that this president has attacked each of the Constitution\u2019s safeguards against establishing a monarchy in this country.\u201d\n\nGerhardt takes particular issue with Trump blocking his administration from complying with House subpoenas for testimony and documents.\n\n\u201cThe power to impeach includes the power to investigate, but, if the president can stymie this House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, he can eliminate the impeachment power as a means for holding him and future presidents accountable for serious misconduct,\u201d he wrote. The House has an obligation to push back on the attempt to block congressional oversight, he added.\n\n\u201cIf Congress fails to impeach here, then the impeachment process has lost all meaning, and, along with that, our Constitution\u2019s carefully crafted safeguards against the establishment of a king on American soil,\u201d Gerhardt wrote.\n\nRead Gerhardt\u2019s testimony here.\n\n\u2014 Sarah D. Wire\n\nExpect today\u2019s hearing to be more theatrical\n\nUpdated: 7:16 a.m. PT\n\nThe tone of the Judiciary hearing is likely to be far more partisan and theatrical than the recent sprint of hearings in the more staid Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee is a much bigger panel and is packed with partisans on both sides of the aisle.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t look like Intel, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said one Democratic source.\n\nSeveral of Trump\u2019s strongest allies sit on the Republican side, including Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida, John Ratcliffe of Texas and Jim Jordan of Ohio, who was briefly moved to the Intelligence Committee to provide support to the White House position during last month\u2019s public hearings. At the helm for the GOP is another Trump ally: Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, who speaks as quickly and forcefully as an auctioneer hawking a hot product.\n\nThe Democrats are just as partisan: Nearly the entire Judiciary Committee supported an impeachment inquiry during former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference and long before the president spoke with the new president of Ukraine.\n\nThat combination could give the Judiciary Committee hearings a level of bombast the public hasn\u2019t seen so far. That poses some risks for Democrats because the proceedings could give Republicans a lot of television time to muddy the Democrats\u2019 presentation, pointing out flaws in a process that they view as unfair and poking holes in the Democrats\u2019 case.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Jennifer Haberkorn\n\nWho will House Judiciary Committee members hear from?\n\nThe committee is bringing in four experts: Noah Feldman, a Harvard Law professor; Pamela Karlan, a Stanford law professor; Jonathan Turley of George Washington University law school and Michael Gerhardt, a law professor at the University of North Carolina.\n\nFeldman has argued that an actual crime is not necessary to impeach a president and has written in opinion columns that Democrats have legitimate grounds to impeach Trump because he has abused the power of his office.\n\nKarlan is a former Obama administration Justice Department official who has not been vocal about the impeachment proceedings. She is well known in legal circles for her work of voting rights and political processes and has argued several cases before the Supreme Court. Karlan was a law clerk for Justice Harry Blackmun.\n\nGerhardt, a former Al Gore campaign official, gave a similar presentation to Congress when the Judiciary Committee was considering impeaching Clinton. His book \u201cImpeachment: What Everyone Needs to Know\u201d describes itself as a nonpartisan \u201cprimer for anyone eager to learn about impeachment\u2019s origins, practices, limitations and alternatives.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://rantt.com/the-house-judiciary-committee", "page_content": "The House Judiciary Committee\n\nAs several committees continue to investigate President Trump, learn more about the committee that would draft articles of impeachment.\n\nWhat Is The House Judiciary Committee?\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee, also referred to as the United States Committee on the Judiciary, oversees the execution of our legal system by US administrative agencies, the federal courts, and Federal law enforcement agencies. Additional responsibilities include impeachments of federal officials and oversight of judicial legislation.\n\nTo facilitate the nature of the committee\u2019s legal bailiwick, members often have a legal background. Nonetheless, legal experience is not required for committee members.\n\nSubcommittees Of The House Judiciary Committee\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee also has five subcommittees. The Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet Subcommittee have jurisdiction over the US Court system while the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties Subcommittee has jurisdiction over all matters concerning the United States Constitution.\n\nAdditional subcommittees include:\n\nCrime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security\n\nImmigration and Citizenship\n\nAntitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law\n\nWhat Is The Judiciary Committee Responsible For?\n\nAlthough the committee was originally established to consider legislation related to the administration of justice, its jurisdiction has expanded over the decades.

Trump.\n\nThe Mueller Report\n\nOn July 24, 2019, the committee heard the testimony of Special Counsel Robert Muller. In his comprehensive report, Mueller found that President Donald Trump did not criminally conspire with Russia to win the 2016 Presidential election. The report also detailed several instances where the President obstructed justice during the subsequent investigation of his actions. Mueller stated in his report, and to the committee, that although his team was not able to conclude that the President committed a crime, they did not exonerate him.\n\nImpeachment\n\nOn October 31, 2019, the US House of Representatives voted on party lines to approve an Impeachment Resolution. The resolution codified the rules for public hearings to be conducted by the House Intelligence Committee. The Intelligence Committee will draft a report of its findings and transfer the document to the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee will then move forward with subsequent impeachment proceedings, including the President\u2019s efforts to defend himself via due process.

The measure passed on June 3rd and the House Judiciary became the 13th standing committee introduced to the US House of Representatives.\n\nThe first House Judiciary committee had seven members and was chaired by Pennsylvania Congressman Charles J. Ingersoll. For the first time, Congress had a \u201ccentral authority on the courts\u201d. Previously, legislative matters of law were handled on an ad hoc basis by select committees or by a Committee of the Whole.\n\nBy 1880, the committee\u2019s jurisdiction expanded to include matters of civil law, criminal law, and subsequent penalties. Just over half a decade later the Reorganization Act of 1946 added patents, immigration, and naturalization to the committee\u2019s responsibilities.

Two centuries later, the committee is the central legislative legal body in the US House of Representatives and performs oversight of the legal activities of all US departments and agencies. In 2019, the committee will determine if the United States Congress will draft articles impeachment of the 45th president of the United States.\n\nJoin Our Exclusive Community One-Month Free 24/7 Access To The Rantt Community\n\n24/7 Access To The Rantt Community Daily morning and evening news briefings\n\nDaily morning and evening news briefings High-minded analysis from industry experts Participate in thoughtful discussions\n\nParticipate in thoughtful discussions Amplify your voice on social media\n\nAmplify your voice on social media No trolls.

Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Dozens of the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officials have signed a letter released Monday urging the U.S. Senate to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cAs members of the law enforcement community, we write in recognition of Judge Jackson\u2019s strong, effective and long-standing role in criminal justice issues,\u201d wrote 63 officials from around the country.\n\nJackson would be the first Black woman named to the nation\u2019s highest court. She was nominated last month by President Joe Biden to fill the seat of Justice Stephen Breyer, who is retiring. She began courting lawmakers last week, meeting privately with Republicans and Democrats. She will meet with more lawmakers Tuesday.\n\nIt\u2019s unusual for police officials to engage so specifically in politics. Those named in the letter represent the nation\u2019s biggest and busiest police departments and courts. The signers to the letter \u2014 addressed to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2014 include former New York Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton and former NYPD official Ben Tucker, who just retired as highest-ranking Black official in the nation\u2019s largest department.\n\nThey include current law enforcement officials like Sheriff Peter Koutoujian of Middlesex County, New Jersey; Oakland, California, Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong; Savannah, Georgia, Chief of Police Roy Minter; Beth McCann, district attorney in Denver; and Karl Racine, attorney general for the District of Columbia. Top policing academics also signed the letter.\n\nThe letter cites Jackson\u2019s history with law enforcement. Growing up in Miami, her uncle was the city\u2019s police chief and another uncle was a sex crimes detective. Her father was an attorney.\n\n\u201cSuch direct familiarity with the experiences and challenges of law enforcement enriches her understanding of criminal justice issues,\u201d the letter states.\n\nJackson has also worked as a federal public defender and for the U.S. Sentencing Commission as well as the federal judiciary, and has been praised by defense attorney groups.\n\nSenate Democrats concerned about their narrow 50-50 majority \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris breaks the tie \u2014 said the hearings will begin March 21.

President Patrick Yoes said the union was \u201creassured\u201d by her record and history and \u201cshould she be confirmed, she would approach her future cases with an open mind and treat issues related to law enforcement fairly and justly.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAn earlier version of this story misstated Karl Racine\u2019s title. He is the attorney general for the District of Columbia."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/judiciary", "page_content": "judiciary, branch of government whose task is the authoritative adjudication of controversies over the application of laws in specific situations.\n\nConflicts brought before the judiciary are embodied in cases involving litigants, who may be individuals, groups, legal entities (e.g., corporations), or governments and their agencies. See also constitutional law, court, and procedural law.\n\nMore From Britannica court\n\nConflicts that allege personal or financial harm resulting from violations of law or binding legal agreements between litigants\u2014other than violations legally defined as crimes\u2014produce civil cases. Judicial decisions in civil cases often require the losing or offending party to pay financial compensation to the winner. Crimes produce criminal cases, which are officially defined as conflicts between the state or its citizens and the accused (defendant) rather than as conflicts between the victim of the crime and the defendant. Judicial decisions in criminal cases determine whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. A defendant found guilty is sentenced to punishments, which may involve the payment of a fine, a term of imprisonment, or, in the most serious cases in some legal systems, state-imposed physical mutilation or even death (see capital punishment).\n\nJudiciaries also frequently resolve administrative cases, disputes between individuals, groups, or legal entities and government agencies over the application of laws or the implementation of government programs. Most legal systems have incorporated the principle of state sovereignty, whereby governments may not be sued by nonstate litigants without their consent. This principle limits the right of litigants to pursue remedies against government actions. Nevertheless, the right of citizens to be free from the arbitrary, improper, abusive application of laws and government regulations has long been recognized and is the focus of administrative cases.\n\nLegal systems differ in the extent to which their judiciaries handle civil, criminal, and administrative cases. In some, courts hear all three kinds of disputes. In others there are specialized civil, criminal, and administrative courts. Still others have some general and some specialized courts.\n\nIn many cases the conflicts that are nominally brought to courts for resolution are uncontested. The majority of civil cases\u2014such as those involving divorce, child custody, or the interpretation of contracts\u2014are settled out of court and never go to trial. The same is true for criminal cases in the United States, where the practice of extrajudicial plea bargaining is used extensively. The different criminal process that characterizes the United Kingdom and civil-law countries makes plea bargaining of the sort practiced in the United States less likely\u2014or even officially impossible. Nevertheless, there is evidence that analogous practices for generating and accepting guilty pleas are common in the United Kingdom and are not unknown in Germany. In cases of plea bargaining the court\u2019s function is administrative, limited to officially ratifying and recording the agreement the parties have reached out of court.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Judicial proceedings involve the participation of a number of people. Although the judge is the central figure, along with the parties to the controversy and the lawyers who represent them, there are other individuals involved, including witnesses, clerks, bailiffs, administrators, and jurors when the proceeding involves a jury.\n\nThe stated function of the courts is the authoritative adjudication of controversies over the application of laws in specific situations. However, it is unavoidable that courts also make law and public policy, because judges must exercise at least some measure of discretion in deciding which litigant claims are legally correct or otherwise most appropriate. Lawmaking and policy making by courts are most evident when powerful national supreme courts (e.g., those in the United States, Germany, and India) exercise their power of judicial review to hold laws or major government actions unconstitutional. They also can occur, however, when judiciaries are behaving as administrators, even when they are merely ratifying agreements reached out of court. Patterns of settlement for suits between employers and employees may be more favourable to employees than formal law would seem to require, because they are influenced by de facto changes in the law that may result from the decisions by juries or trial judges who may regularly be more sympathetic to workers. Formal laws regulating child custody or financial settlements in divorce cases can similarly be altered over time as juries process the claims of the litigants before them in persistent ways.\n\nAfter a court decision has been made, it may or may not require enforcement. In many cases the parties accept the judgment of the court and conform their behaviour to it. In other cases a court must order a party to cease a particular activity. The enforcement of such orders is carried out by the executive branch and may require funding from the legislative branch. The judiciary has been described as the least-dangerous branch of government because it has \u201cneither the purse nor the sword,\u201d but, in reality, enforcement of the orders of any government institution depends on the enforcing institution\u2019s acceptance of the issuing institution\u2019s right to make the ruling and to have it enforced."}]}
