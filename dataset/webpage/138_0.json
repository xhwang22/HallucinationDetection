But 35 years ago, when Peter Weir embraced the spirit of the title \u201cThe Year of Living Dangerously\u201d and hired an American woman to play a Chinese-Australian man in that political drama, his gamble paid off: Linda Hunt became the only person to win an Academy Award for playing a cisgender character of the opposite sex.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy decision. The filmmaker had asked a fellow Australian, David Atkins, to take the role of the dwarf Billy Kwan in the drama about expats in Indonesia during the 1965 coup attempt. But Atkins didn\u2019t click with the movie\u2019s star, Mel Gibson, during rehearsals. \u201cSets were being constructed in Manila, and the clock was ticking,\u201d Weir recalled in a recent email. \u201cThe casting agent said he had a possible Billy Kwan called L. Hunt. He then revealed he was a she. We were desperate and gave her a try, and she was great.\u201d\n\nBut Hunt, a stage actress whose sole film credit was a part in Robert Altman\u2019s \u201cPopeye,\u201d wasn\u2019t sure she could pull off the role of a male photographer who facilitates a romance between an Australian journalist (Gibson) and a British diplomat (Sigourney Weaver). \u201cShe said, \u2018Could you rewrite it for a woman?\u2019\u201d Weir remembered. \u201cI said it would change the whole story. Silence. \u2018Could you play a man?\u2019 Now a really long silence. \u2018Only if you believe in me,\u2019 she said. So we took the plunge.\u201d\n\nDuring the early stages of production, Hunt still doubted herself. \u201cI thought, oh my God, I\u2019m going to have to go somewhere when this film opens, just away, as far as I could get,\u201d she told The Daily Beast in 2011. She said she thought her performance \u201cwas so awful. It got better and better as we went on.\u201d Hunt declined to be interviewed for this article."}]}
