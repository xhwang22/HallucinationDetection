{"Thomas Clayton Wolfe was born on October 3, 1900.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Wolfe", "page_content": "Thomas Wolfe, in full Thomas Clayton Wolfe, (born Oct. 3, 1900, Asheville, N.C., U.S.\u2014died Sept. 15, 1938, Baltimore, Md.), American writer best known for his first book, Look Homeward, Angel (1929), and his other autobiographical novels.\n\nHis father, William Oliver Wolfe, the Oliver Gant of his novels, was a stonecutter, while his mother, Julia Elizabeth Westall Wolfe, the Eliza of the early novels, owned a successful boardinghouse in Asheville, N.C., where Wolfe grew up. He was educated privately and in 1916 entered the University of North Carolina, where he wrote and acted in several one-act plays. In 1920 he enrolled in George Pierce Baker\u2019s 47 Workshop at Harvard University, intending to become a playwright. Several of his plays were produced at Harvard, including Welcome to Our City (1923), in which the town of Altamont (Asheville) first appeared.\n\nIn 1923 Wolfe left Harvard for New York City, where he resided for the rest of his life. Still intending to be a playwright, he taught at Washington Square College of New York University. In 1926, while abroad, he began work on what eventually became Look Homeward, Angel, in which he recounted the growth of an autobiographical protagonist, Eugene Gant, in the mountain town of Altamont. The book was a success, though its publication caused a great furor in Asheville.\n\nDuring the late 1920s Wolfe entered into a relationship with the theatrical designer Aline Bernstein, who appeared as Esther Jack in his last two novels and who wrote of their friendship in the novel The Journey Down (1938). After the publication of Look Homeward, Angel, Wolfe quit teaching to write full-time. His second novel, Of Time and the River (1935), takes up the story of Eugene Gant from his leaving home to attend Harvard until his meeting with Esther Jack. Wolfe\u2019s memoir of his life in the 1930s, The Story of a Novel (1936), describes his close working relationship with the editor Maxwell Perkins (q.v.), who helped him reduce the enormous manuscripts of his first two works down to manageable novelistic proportions.\n\nWolfe did not publish another novel during his lifetime, though at his death he left a prodigious quantity of manuscript, from which the editor Edward Aswell extracted two more novels, The Web and the Rock (1939) and You Can\u2019t Go Home Again (1940). These books depict the struggles of a young writer to become established in New York City and his first experiences with literary fame. A collection of Wolfe\u2019s shorter pieces and chapters of an uncompleted novel, The Hills Beyond (1941), and his Letters to His Mother (1943) were also published, as well as his Selected Letters (1956).\n\nWolfe was gifted with the faculty of almost total recall, and his fiction is characterized by an intense consciousness of scene and place, together with what is often an extraordinary lyric power. In Look Homeward, Angel and Of Time and the River, Wolfe was able to imbue his life story and the figures of his parents with a lofty romantic quality that has epic and mythopoeic overtones. Powerful emotional evocation and literal reporting are combined in his fiction, and he often alternates between dramatically effective episodes of recollection and highly charged passages of rhetoric. Though The Web and the Rock and You Can\u2019t Go Home Again contain episodes of great vividness, they are too often uncontrolled in their form and fail to sustain the epic tone of Look Homeward, Angel, which has become an American classic."}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/thomas-wolfe", "page_content": "(1900-1938)\n\nWho Was Thomas Wolfe?\n\nThomas Wolfe was a notable American novelist from the early 20th century. He first attended the University of North Carolina and then Harvard University before moving to New York City in 1923. It was there that he wrote his most popular work, Look Homeward, Angel (1929), an autobiographical piece centering on his alter ego, Eugene Gant. Wolfe followed with four novels over the following eight years and had more than 10 works published after his untimely death in 1938.\n\nEarly Years\n\nThomas Wolfe was born on October 3, 1900, in Asheville, North Carolina, to a stonecutter father and a mother who owned a boardinghouse. After attending a private prep school, Wolfe enrolled in the University of North Carolina in 1916. There he began his writing career, penning and acting in several one-act plays. Wolfe also edited The Tar Heel, UNC's student newspaper, and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for his essay \"The Crisis in Industry.\" Wolfe graduated in 1920, and in the fall he entered the Graduate School for Arts and Sciences at Harvard University, where he set his sights on becoming a professional playwright as a part of Harvard's 47 Workshop.\n\nIn 1923, Wolfe left Boston for New York, the city he called home for the rest of his life. He taught at Washington Square College of New York University and continued to write. Three years later, while abroad, he began work on what eventually became the novel Look Homeward, Angel.\n\n'Look Homeward, Angel'\n\nIn early 1928, Wolfe completed the manuscript for Look Homeward, Angel, and by summer he learned that Scribner was interested in the work. The book was officially accepted for publication in January 1929, and Wolfe began his long, close and tumultuous relationship with editor Maxwell Perkins (who was also famously the editor of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald). Perkins edited the manuscript down into a more manageable form (a process that would eventually mark the beginning of the end of the pair's working relationship), and it was published in October 1929 to great critical reception, placing Wolfe on the literary map as one of America's most promising young novelists.\n\nAnother consequence of publication was the furor caused in Wolfe's hometown of Asheville, as the cast of characters in the autobiographical book hit close to home for many of Asheville's residents.\n\nThe Road to Success\n\nThe following year, Wolfe received a Guggenheim Fellowship and published a second short novel, Web of Earth, and soon began preparations for several other works: K-19, No Door (a short novel) and a collection of three short novels. Wolfe's publication plan conflicted with that of Perkins, who wanted Wolfe to write a follow-up to the story of Eugene Gant, the protagonist of Look Homeward, Angel. Perkins began working with Wolfe daily in 1933 on this proposed book, and in the summer of 1934, ignoring Wolfe's objections, Perkins sent the manuscript of Of Time and the River to Scribner. The book was generally well-received upon publication, but Wolfe was bitterly displeased with it, blaming Perkins for the unsatisfactory form of the final product.\n\nAn Early Death\n\nIn 1936, Wolfe's dissatisfaction with Perkins led to a larger conflict with Scribner, and Wolfe left Scribner for Harper & Brothers. Two years after leaving Scribner, Wolfe left New York to travel to the American West. In July 1938, he became sick in Seattle, and two months later he was sent to the Johns Hopkins University Hospital. Wolfe could not recover his health, and he died at Johns Hopkins of tuberculosis of the brain shortly before his 38th birthday.\n\nAfter Wolfe's death, Edward Aswell, Wolfe's Harper editor, assembled from the manuscripts left behind the novels The Web and the Rock (1939) and You Can't Go Home Again (1940). Several other collections and uncompleted works also appeared posthumously, and Wolfe's legacy is that of one of America's strongest writers whose potential was cut tragically short.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Thomas Wolfe\n\nBirth Year: 1900\n\nBirth date: October 3, 1900\n\nBirth State: North Carolina\n\nBirth City: Asheville\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Thomas Wolfe was a major American novelist of the early 20th century, notable for his first book, 1929's 'Look Homeward, Angel.'\n\nIndustries\n\nEducation and Academia\n\n\n\nTheater and Dance\n\n\n\nFiction and Poetry\n\nAstrological Sign: Libra\n\nSchools\n\nUniversity of North Carolina\n\n\n\nHarvard University\n\nDeath Year: 1938\n\nDeath date: September 15, 1938\n\nDeath State: Maryland\n\nDeath City: Baltimore\n\nDeath Country: United States\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: Thomas Wolfe Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/thomas-wolfe\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E; Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: September 6, 2019\n\nOriginal Published Date: April 2, 2014\n\nQUOTES"}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Thomas-Clayton-Wolfe/6000000005582272742", "page_content": "About Thomas Clayton Wolfe\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wolfe\n\nhttps://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wolfe-2120\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/1120\n\nhttps://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/104277501/family?cfpid=21...\n\nhttps://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/89349251/family?cfpid=485...\n\nThomas Clayton Wolfe (October 3, 1900 \u2013 September 15, 1938) was a major American novelist of the early 20th century.\n\nWolfe wrote four lengthy novels, plus many short stories, dramatic works and novellas. He is known for mixing highly original, poetic, rhapsodic, and impressionistic prose with autobiographical writing. His books, written and published from the 1920s to the 1940s, reflect vividly on American culture and mores of the period, albeit filtered through Wolfe's sensitive, sophisticated and hyper-analytical perspective. He became very famous during his own lifetime.\n\nAfter Wolfe's death, his chief contemporary William Faulkner said that Wolfe may have had the best talent of their generation. Wolfe's influence extends to the writings of famous Beat writer Jack Kerouac, authors Ray Bradbury and Philip Roth, among others. He remains one of the most important writers in modern American literature, as he was one of the first masters of autobiographical fiction. He is considered North Carolina's most famous writer.\n\nEarly life\n\nWolfe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the youngest of eight children of William Oliver Wolfe (1851\u20131922) and Julia Elizabeth Westall (1860\u20131945). His siblings were sister Leslie E. Wolfe (1885\u20131886); Effie Nelson Wolfe (1887\u20131950); Frank Cecil Wolfe (1888\u20131956); Mabel Elizabeth Wolfe (1890\u20131958); Grover Cleveland Wolfe (1892\u20131904); Benjamin Harrison Wolfe (1892\u20131918); and Frederick William Wolfe (1894\u20131980). Six of the children lived to adulthood.\n\nThe Wolfes lived at 92 Woodfin Street, where Tom was born. His father, a successful stone carver, ran a gravestone business. His mother took in boarders and was active in acquiring real estate. In 1904, she opened a boarding house in St. Louis, for the World's Fair. While the family was in St. Louis, 12-year-old Grover died of typhoid fever.\n\nIn 1906, Julia Wolfe bought a boarding house named \"Old Kentucky Home\" at nearby 48 Spruce Street in Asheville, taking up residence there with her youngest son while the rest of the family remained at the Woodfin Street residence. Wolfe lived in the boarding house on Spruce Street until he went to college in 1916. It is now the Thomas Wolfe Memorial. Wolfe was closest to his brother Ben, whose early death at age 26 is chronicled in Look Homeward, Angel. Julia Wolfe bought and later sold many properties, eventually becoming a successful real estate speculator.\n\nWolfe began to study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) when he was 15 years old; he was a member of the Dialectic Society and Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and predicted that his portrait would one day hang in New West near that of celebrated North Carolina governor Zebulon Vance, which it does today.[6] Aspiring to be a playwright, in 1919 Wolfe enrolled in a playwriting course. His one-act play, The Return of Buck Gavin, was performed by the newly-formed Carolina Playmakers, then composed of classmates in Frederick Koch's playwriting class, with Wolfe acting the title role. He edited UNC's student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for an essay titled The Crisis in Industry. Another of his plays, The Third Night, was performed by the Playmakers in December 1919. Wolfe was inducted into the Golden Fleece honor society.\n\nHe graduated from UNC with a B.A. degree in June 1920. In September of that year, he entered the Graduate School for Arts and Sciences at Harvard University, where he studied playwriting under George Pierce Baker. Two versions of Wolfe's play The Mountains were performed by Baker's 47 Workshop in 1921.\n\nIn 1922, Wolfe received his Master's degree from Harvard. His father died in Asheville in June of that year, an event that would strongly influence his writing. Wolfe continued to study for another year with Baker in the 47 Workshop, which produced his ten-scene play Welcome to Our City in May 1923.\n\nWolfe visited New York City again in November 1923 and solicited funds for UNC while trying to sell his plays to Broadway. In February 1924, he began teaching English as an instructor at New York University (NYU), a position he occupied periodically for almost seven years.\n\nCareer\n\nUnable to sell any of his plays after three years due to their excessive length, including a time when the Theatre Guild came close to producing his play Welcome to Our City before ultimately rejecting it, Wolfe found his writing style more suited to fiction than the stage. He sailed to Europe in October 1924 to continue writing. From England he traveled to France, Italy and Switzerland. On his return voyage in 1925, he met Aline Bernstein (1882\u20131955), a scene designer for the Theatre Guild. 18 years his senior, Bernstein was married to a successful stock broker with whom she had two children.\n\nIn October 1925, Wolfe and Bernstein became lovers and remained so for five years. Their affair was turbulent and sometimes combative, but she exerted a powerful influence, encouraging and funding his writing. He returned to Europe in the summer of 1926 and began writing the first version of a novel, O Lost, which eventually evolved into Look Homeward, Angel. An autobiographical novel that fictionalized his early experiences in Asheville, the narrative chronicled family, friends and the boarders at his mother's establishment on Spruce Street. In the book, he renamed the town Altamont and called the boarding house \"Dixieland.\" His family was fictionalized under the name Gant, with Wolfe calling himself Eugene, his father Oliver, and his mother Eliza.\n\nThe original manuscript of O Lost was over 100 pages and 66,000 words longer and considerably more experimental in character than the final edited version of Look Homeward, Angel. The editing was done by Maxwell Perkins at Scribner's, the most prominent book editor of the time, who also worked with Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Initially, Wolfe expressed gratitude to Perkins for his disciplined editing. It has been said that Wolfe found a father figure in Perkins, who had five daughters and found in Wolfe a sort of foster son relationship. Perkins cut the book to focus more on the character of Eugene, a stand-in for Wolfe himself.\n\nWhen the novel was published 11 days before the stock market crash of 1929, Wolfe dedicated it to Bernstein. Soon after the book's publication, Wolfe returned to Europe and ended his affair with Bernstein. The publication of the novel caused a stir in Asheville, with its over 200 thinly disguised local characters. Wolfe chose to stay away from Asheville for eight years due to the uproar; he traveled to Europe for a year on a Guggenheim fellowship. Look Homeward, Angel was a bestseller in the United Kingdom and Germany. Some members of Wolfe's family were also upset with their portrayal in the book, but his sister Mabel wrote to him that she was sure he had the best of intentions.\n\nAfter four more years writing in Brooklyn, the second novel Wolfe submitted to Scribner's was The October Fair, a multi-volume epic roughly the length of Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time. After considering the commercial possibilities of publishing the book in full, Perkins opted to cut it down significantly and create a single, bestseller-sized volume, which would be titled Of Time and the River. This novel was more commercially successful than Look Homeward, Angel. In a twist from the publication of his previous novel, the citizens of Asheville were more upset this time if they hadn't been included than if they had. The character of Esther Jack was based on Bernstein. In 1934, Maxim Lieber served as his literary agent.\n\nWolfe left Scribner's and signed with Harper Bros. By some accounts, Perkins' severe editing of Wolfe's work prompted him to leave the Scribner imprint. Other accounts describe Wolfe's growing resentment that some attributed his success to Perkins' work as editor. In 1936, Bernard DeVoto, reviewing The Story of a Novel for Saturday Review, wrote that Look Homeward, Angel was \"hacked and shaped and compressed into something resembling a novel by Mr. Perkins and the assembly-line at Scribners.\"\n\nWolfe spent much time in Europe and was especially popular and at ease in Germany, where he made many friends. However, in 1936, he witnessed discriminatory incidents towards Jewish people that upset him and changed his mind about the political developments in the country. Wolfe returned to America and published a short story chronicling the incidents called \"I Have a Thing to Tell You\" in The New Republic. Following that publication, Wolfe's books were banned by the German government and he was prohibited from traveling there. Wolfe did return to Asheville in the summer of 1937 for the first time since publication of his first book.\n\nDeath\n\nIn 1938, after turning in a large body of manuscript materials, over one million words, to his new editor, Edward Aswell, Wolfe left New York for a tour of the West. On the way, he stopped at Purdue University and gave a lecture, Writing and Living, then spent two weeks traveling through 11 national parks in the West, the only part of the country he had never visited before. Wolfe wrote to Aswell that while he had focused on his family in his previous writing, he would now take a more global perspective. In July, Wolfe became ill with pneumonia while visiting Seattle, spending three weeks in the hospital there. His sister Mabel closed her boardinghouse in Washington, DC and went to Seattle to care for him. Complications arose, and Wolfe was eventually diagnosed with miliary tuberculosis of the brain.\n\nOn September 6, he was sent to Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital for treatment under the most famous neurosurgeon in the country, Dr. Walter Dandy, but an attempt at a life-saving operation revealed that the disease had overrun the entire right side of his brain. Without regaining consciousness, he died 18 days before his 38th birthday. His last writing, a journal of his two-week trip through the national parks, was found in his belongings hours after his death.\n\nDespite his disagreements with Perkins and Scribner's, on his deathbed Wolfe wrote a deeply moving letter to Perkins, whom he considered to be his closest friend. He acknowledged that Perkins had helped to realize his work and had made his labors possible. In closing he wrote:\n\n\"I shall always think of you and feel about you the way it was that Fourth of July day three years ago when you met me at the boat, and we went out on the cafe on the river and had a drink and later went on top of the tall building, and all the strangeness and the glory and the power of life and of the city was below.\"\n\nThomas Wolfe is interred in Riverside Cemetery, Asheville, North Carolina, beside his parents, W.O. and Julia Wolfe, and his siblings.\n\nThe next day, The New York Times wrote: \"His was one of the most confident young voices in contemporary American literature, a vibrant, full-toned voice which it is hard to believe could be so suddenly stilled. The stamp of genius was upon him, though it was an undisciplined and unpredictable genius.... There was within him an unspent energy, an untiring force, an unappeasable hunger for life and for expression which might have carried him to the heights and might equally have torn him down.\" Time wrote: \"The death last week of Thomas Clayton Wolfe shocked critics with the realization that, of all American novelists of his generation, he was the one from whom most had been expected.\" Due to his early death, Wolfe spent the shortest amount of time writing of any major novelist during that time, with a career less than half as long as Fitzgerald, Hemingway, or Faulkner.\n\nAfterward\n\nWolfe saw less than half of his work published in his lifetime, due to the amount of the material he left at his death. He was the first American writer to leave two complete, unpublished novels in the hands of his publisher at death. Two further Wolfe novels, The Web and the Rock and You Can't Go Home Again, were edited posthumously by Edward Aswell of Harper and Row. The novels were \"two of the longest one-volume novels (some 700 pages apiece) ever written.\" In these novels, Wolfe switched his autobiographical character from Eugene Gant to George Webber.\n\nO Lost, the original \"author's cut\" of Look Homeward, Angel, was reconstructed by F. Scott Fitzgerald scholar Matthew Bruccoli and published in 2000 on the centennial of Wolfe's birth. Bruccoli said that while Perkins was a talented editor, Look Homeward, Angel is inferior to the complete work of O Lost and that the publication of the complete novel \"marks nothing less than the restoration of a masterpiece to the literary canon.\"\n\nCritical reception and legacy\n\nUpon publication of Look Homeward, Angel, most reviewers responded favorably, including John Chamberlain, Carl Van Doren, and Stringfellow Barr. Margaret Wallace wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Wolfe had produced \"as interesting and powerful a book as has ever been made out of the drab circumstances of provincial American life.\" An anonymous review published in Scribner's magazine compared Wolfe to Walt Whitman, and many other reviewers and scholars have found similarities in their works since.\n\nWhen published in the UK in July 1930, the book received similar reviews. Richard Aldington wrote that the novel was \"the product of an immense exuberance, organic in its form, kinetic, and drenched with the love of life... I rejoice over Mr. Wolfe.\" Both in his 1930 Nobel Prize for Literature acceptance speech and original press conference announcement, Sinclair Lewis, the first American to win the Nobel Prize for literature, said of Wolfe, \"He may have a chance to be the greatest American writer.... In fact I don't see why he should not be one of the greatest world writers.\"\n\nUpon publication of his second novel, Of Time and the River, most reviewers and the public remained supportive, though some critics found shortcomings while still hailing it for moments or aspects of greatness. The book was well-received by the public and became his only American bestseller. The publication was viewed as \"the literary event of 1935\"; by comparison, the earlier attention given to Look Homeward, Angel was modest. Both The New York Times and New York Herald Tribune published enthusiastic front-page reviews. Clifton Fadiman wrote in The New Yorker that while he wasn't sure what he thought of the book, \"for decades we have not had eloquence like his in American writing.\" Malcolm Cowley of The New Republic thought the book would be twice as good if half as long, but stated Wolfe was \"the only contemporary writer who can be mentioned in the same breath as Dickens and Dostoevsky.\" Robert Penn Warren thought Wolfe produced some brilliant fragments from which \"several fine novels might be written.\" He went on to say: \"And meanwhile it may be well to recollect that Shakespeare merely wrote Hamlet; he was not Hamlet.\" Warren also praised Wolfe in the same review, though, as did John Donald Wade in a separate review.\n\nWhile acclaimed when alive as one of the most important American writers of equal quality to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Faulkner, Wolfe's reputation has been \"all but destroyed\" since his death, although The New York Times wrote in 2003 that Wolfe's reputation and related scholarship appeared to be on an \"upswing.\" He is often left out of college courses and anthologies devoted to great writers. Faulkner and W.J. Cash listed Wolfe as the ablest writer of their generation, although Faulkner later qualified his praise. Despite his early admiration of Wolfe's work, Faulkner subsequently concluded that his novels were \"like an elephant trying to do the hoochie-cooochie.\" Ernest Hemingway's verdict was that Wolfe was \"the over-bloated Lil Abner of literature.\"\n\nTwo universities hold the primary archival collections of Thomas Wolfe materials in the United States: the Thomas Clayton Wolfe Papers at Harvard University's Houghton Library, which includes all of Wolfe's manuscripts, and the Thomas Wolfe Collections in the North Carolina Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. UNC-Chapel Hill presents the annual Thomas Wolfe Prize and Lecture each October at the time of Wolfe's birthday to a contemporary writer, with past recipients including Roy Blount, Jr., Robert Morgan, and Pat Conroy.\n\nThe \"Old Kentucky Home\" was donated by Wolfe's family as the Thomas Wolfe Memorial and has been open to visitors since the 1950s, owned by the state of North Carolina since 1976 and designated as a National Historic Landmark. In 1998, 200 of the house's 800 original artifacts and the house's dining room were destroyed in an act of arson during the Bele Chere street festival, the perpetrators still unknown. After a $2.4 million restoration, the house was re-opened in 2003. Return of an Angel, by Sandra Mason, is a play that explores the reactions of Wolfe's family and the citizens of his hometown of Asheville to the publication of his novel, Look Homeward, Angel. It was produced for several years in October, next door to the Thomas Wolfe Memorial, in celebration of Wolfe's birthday. Pack Memorial Library in Asheville hosts the Thomas Wolfe Collection which \"honors Asheville's favorite son.\" The Western North Carolina Historical Association has presented the Thomas Wolfe Memorial Literary Award yearly since 1955 for a literary achievement of the previous year. The Thomas Wolfe Society celebrates Wolfe's writings and publishes an annual review about Wolfe's work. The United States Postal Service honored Wolfe with a postage stamp on the occasion of what would have been Wolfe's 100th birthday in 2000.\n\nWolfe inspired the works of many other authors, including Betty Smith with A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Robert Morgan, author of Gap Creek, and Prince of Tides author Pat Conroy, who has said, \"My writing career began the instant I finished Look Homeward, Angel.\" Jack Kerouac idolized Wolfe. Ray Bradbury was both influenced by and included Wolfe as a character in his books.\n\nThe Thomas Wolfe Society\n\nThe Thomas Wolfe Society was established in the late 1970s to promote appreciation and study of the works of this famous American author. The Society meets annually in May at locations in the U.S. or Europe visited by Wolfe. Recent conferences have been held in Greenville, South Carolina, Paris, France, and Saint Louis, Missouri. The Society issues an annual publication of Wolfe-related materials, as well as its signature journal, The Thomas Wolfe Review, featuring scholarly articles, belles lettres, and reviews. The Society also awards prizes for literary scholarship on Wolfe.\n\nAdaptations\n\nIn 1958, Ketti Frings adapted Look Homeward, Angel into a play of the same name. It ran on Broadway for 564 performances at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, received six Tony Award nominations, and won the 1958 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Frings was named \"Woman of the Year\" by The Los Angeles Times in the same year. In 1972, it was presented as a television drama, as was Of Time and the River in a one-hour version.\n\nWolfe's play Welcome to Our City was performed twice at Harvard during his graduate school years, in Zurich in German during the 1950s, and by the Mint Theater in New York City in 2000 in celebration of Wolfe's 100th birthday.\n\nWorks and Essays\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wolfe#Works\n\nExerpt from Wikitree Wolfe-2120:\n\nThomas Wolfe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the youngest child of William Oliver Wolfe and Julia Elizabeth Westall His siblings were sister Leslie E.

One of seven children to Julia Westall and William Oliver Wolfe, Thomas\u2019s childhood was often strained due to his father\u2019s heavy drinking and his mother\u2019s bitterness toward her husband. However, William learned from his father the love of language whether it be the Appalachian mountain vernacular or the lofty poetry of the Elizabethan era. Thomas\u2019s somewhat troubled childhood and his parents\u2019 domestic problems provided the material for his magnus opus, Look Homeward, Angel (1929).\n\nWolfe was an avid reader as well as an intelligent writer, and he was educated at the North State Fitting School, the University of North Carolina, and Harvard University. From 1905 to 1912, Thomas attended school in Asheville, and in 1916, when he was only fifteen years old he was admitted to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 1918, Wolfe started to pen plays with Frederick Koch and the Carolina Playmakers. The Playmakers, along with Wolfe and Koch, would be the first important group to influenced North Carolina theater. In addition, the group\u2019s first play was The Return of Buck Gavin, a play that Wolfe penned in only three hours. Wolfe would later attend Harvard University. There he studied drama and wrote over 140 plays.\n\nIn 1924 after stints at several northern universities, Wolfe traveled to Europe where his time there influenced his novel, Of Time and the River. Wolfe returned to New York the year after and began a relationship with a wealthy, married woman named Alice Bernstein; their affair would last for several years, and she (Bernstein was seventeen years his senior) became the mother-mistress Wolfe had wanted since his childhood. Bernstein provided the inspiration for Wolfe to begin Look Homeward, Angel and he started writing the novel in July 1926 while traveling with his mistress.\n\nPublished in 1929, Look Homeward, Angel was in many ways the story of Wolfe\u2019s own life, and it was connected to the region, family, and friends of his childhood in Asheville. Due to the distinct details and parallels in the novel and Wolfe\u2019s childhood, many in Asheville were irate because of Wolfe\u2019s sometimes harsh descriptions. Look Homeward was even banned from the Asheville public library, and Wolfe could not return to his hometown nearly seven years after the novel\u2019s publication. The exile that Wolfe faced provided even more inspiration and his novel, You Can\u2019t Go Home Again (1940), was influenced by the troubles Wolfe faced after Look Homeward. Wolfe returned in 1937, and he later wrote in his defense of his novel, entitled The Story of a Novel (1936), \u201cthat the people he described, whatever their faults, were magnificent.\u201d\n\nEven though Wolfe was famous for his epic Look Homeward, Angel, he was also known for his personal appearance and idiosyncrasies. A tall, robust man standing at six-feet-six-inches, Wolfe\u2019s hands were too large for a conventional typewriter, so he would use the top of his refrigerator as a desk as he stood to write. In addition to his writing style, Wolfe dressed in meager clothes and he roamed the streets of Brooklyn very late at night. One witness remarked that Wolfe, as he walked the dark streets, proclaimed, \u201cI wrote ten thousand words today! I wrote ten thousand words today!\u201d\n\nIn 1938, Wolfe toured of the West and during his trip he became sick with pneumonia. Later that year as the disease worsened, Wolfe was transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Despite surgery to correct brain trauma that Wolfe suffered from tuberculosis, Wolfe passed away on September 15, 1938. He was eighteen days shy of his thirty-eight birthday.\n\nHighly regarded during his lifetime, Wolfe was driven to write and it is remarkable that he appealed to such a large audience and completed so many works in such a short period. Look Homeward, Angel established Wolfe as an accomplished author in the late 1920s, but he continued to write for magazines in New York which influenced numerous readers during the Depression. Although fellow authors of his time such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and William Faulkner were more popular during Wolfe\u2019s lifetime, it is noteworthy that Wolfe completed so much in only a decade of writing. He would write numerous short stories, dramas, and other significant novels such as Of Time and the River (1935), The Web and the Rock (1939), and You Can\u2019t Go Home Again (1940). William Faulkner, a prominent Modernist author, wrote about Wolfe in 1957: \u201cMy admiration for Wolfe is that he tried the best to get it all said; he was willing to throw away style, coherence, all the rules of preciseness to try to put all the experience of the human heart on the head of the pin.\u201d\n\nAlthough Look Homeward, Angel was banned from Asheville, Wolfe is now one of the city\u2019s most famous citizens. In addition, Wolfe is considered the first North Carolinian author to appeal to a large reader base in the twentieth century."}, {"url": "https://thomaswolfe.org/about-thomas-wolfe/common-questions/", "page_content": "Feel free to share your question with us at deborah.borland3@gmail.com.

His highly autobiographical novels are notable for fervent energy, uninhibited emotion, and grandly rhetorical language.\n\nThomas Wolfe achieved critical acclaim for his unabashed romanticism and visionary faith in the inherent greatness of America and the heroism of its people. He possessed an extraordinary ability for portraiture and a gift for visual detail and sensory impressions, but his brilliance is often diminished in a diffuse sea of inflated irrelevancies and ranting incantations and exhortations. Modern critics have grown less infatuated with his prose and become more aware of the lack of thematic focus, structural cohesion, and controlling artistic intelligence in even his most disciplined work.\n\nThe most striking irony in Wolfe's work is that despite his spontaneous emotionalism there is an absence of compassion for any character other than his self-identifying protagonist, and despite his mystic exaltation of sex there is little credible sexuality and even less love.\n\nLonely Childhood\n\nWolfe was born on Oct. 3, 1900, in Asheville, N.C. His mother had been a schoolteacher before marrying William O. Wolfe, a stonecutter and a man of towering assertiveness and drive. After the parents split up, Wolfe's lonely childhood was spent shuttling between the two. The death of his older brother Ben, whom he idolized, left an emotional scar from which he never recovered.\n\nAfter an outstanding scholastic record, at the age of 15 Wolfe was admitted to the University of North Carolina, where he became active in various publications and theater groups. Two plays were produced: The Return of Buck Gavin (published 1924) and The Third Night (1938). Upon graduation the embryonic author continued at Harvard University, eventually earning a master of arts degree. His involvement with the famous Playwright Workshop led to Welcome to Our City (produced at Harvard, 1923) and to work on Mannerhouse (published 1948), concerning the disintegration of a southern family. His professors' enthusiasm encouraged Wolfe to move to New York in 1923 to seek success in the theater. Failure forced him to accept a position as English instructor at New York University. In 1924 in Europe he met Aline Bernstein, a married mother of two, 16 years his senior, with whom he had a brief but intense love affair.\n\nLook Homeward, Angel\n\nIn 1926 Wolfe began work on an enormous novel which would explore and explain \"the strange and bitter magic of life.\" After some 20 months of furious writing, Wolfe left the huge, sprawling manuscript with Maxwell Perkins, editor of Scribner's. Though impressed with the author's genius, Perkins would not publish the novel until it was considerably revised and drastically cut. After a great deal of reworking and editing, Look Homeward, Angel appeared in 1929. Opening with a 90-page account of the early lives of his father and mother, the novel is a thinly disguised autobiographical record of the author's early years in the person of Eugene Gant.\n\nIn contrast to the critics' instant praise, Wolfe earned the hostility of many relatives and friends who easily recognized themselves in the novel. Though recent critical judgment of the work has been tempered by the recognition of its romantic and at times adolescent pretentiousness, Look Homeward, Angel contains vigorous prose and sequences of unquestionable power, such as the chilling conversation between Eugene and the ghost of his brother Ben, and the graphic description of his father's struggle against cancer. It is Wolfe's major contribution to American literature.\n\nWolfe resigned from New York University in 1930 and returned to Europe for a year on a fellowship. He had in mind a vast novel of several volumes which would range in time from the Civil War to the present and would replace Eugene Gant with a less autobiographical protagonist. After nearly five years of grappling with this conception\u2014while living in extreme loneliness and near poverty in Brooklyn Heights, New York City\u2014Wolfe recognized his inability to achieve a structural unity for the work.\n\nOf Time and the River\n\nPerkins insisted that Wolfe return to his previous autobiographical mode. Despite Wolfe's bitter protestations, a mammoth, haphazardly organized novel, Of Time and the River, appeared in 1935. Here the story of Eugene Gant continues, from his journey to Harvard University, through his period of personal turmoil in Europe, including an unhappy love affair, concluding with his return to the United States. The work's two outstanding sections are a vivid description of Eugene's ride to Boston and the horrifyingly effective account of the death of Gant's father.\n\nAlternating between hysterical affirmation and maudlin self-pity, the novel's young protagonist is a rather unpleasant individual whose heroic conception of himself is never sustained by objective facts. Most of the other characters are sketchily drawn, with the exception of the friend Starwick, who, like Eugene, is endowed with a tragic dimension, whose basis is never made clear. Eugene's relationship with Starwick and his horror at discovering his friend's homosexuality are psychologically ambiguous and absurdly melodramatic. The study maintains a strange effectiveness, however, because of its frequent insights into the abyss of human loneliness and the sterility of self-love.\n\nSeveral months after publication of Of Time and the River, Perkins collected several short stories and sketches extracted from Wolfe's earlier uncompleted novel. Under the title From Death to Morning, the uneven work was severely attacked by critics, although it included two of Wolfe's finest pieces of controlled narration\u2014\"Only the Dead Know Brooklyn\" and \"Death the Proud Brother.\" In 1936 Wolfe terminated his association with Perkins, largely to quell the rumor that the editor had acted as a near collaborator in the creation of his fiction, and signed with Edward C. Aswell, editor of Harper and Brothers.\n\nPosthumous Publications\n\nForgiven by his family and friends in North Carolina, for the first time in many years Wolfe returned home, where he spent several months writing and discovering that \"you can't go home again.\" He presented a voluminous manuscript to Aswell, the working outlines for a new series of novels. On vacation in the West, Wolfe suddenly contracted pneumonia, which activated a tubercular condition. He died on Sept. 15, 1938, in Baltimore.\n\nFrom the eight-foot pile of manuscript left him, Aswell compiled two novels, The Web and the Rock (1939) and You Can't Go Home Again (1940), and a volume of short stories, The Hills Beyond (1941). The novels are no less autobiographical than Wolfe's earlier ones, and despite some impressive prose in The Web and the Rock, there is no indication that Wolfe had begun to achieve mastery of his medium or to discover fresh thematic material. Wolfe's other posthumous writings include Letters to His Mother (1943), Western Journal (1951), and Letters (1956).\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe only biography of Wolfe is Andrew Turnbull, Thomas Wolfe (1968).

He studied for one more year under Baker. In May 1923, his 10-scene play, \u2018Welcome to Our City,\u2019 was staged by \u201847 Workshop.\u2019\n\nIn June 1920, Wolfe graduated with a BA degree. He joined the \u2018Graduate School for Arts and Sciences\u2019 at \u2018Harvard University\u2019 in September 1920. He studied playwriting under George Pierce Baker at his \u201847 Workshop.\u2019 In 1921, two versions of Wolfe\u2019s play \u2018The Mountains\u2019 were performed by the \u201847 Workshop.\u2019 In 1922, he obtained his MA degree from \u2018Harvard.\u2019\n\nWolfe volunteered as a civilian war worker in Norfolk during the summer of 1918. Later, he joined Prof. Frederick Koch\u2019s playwriting course at the university. In March 1919, the university\u2019s theater company, \u2018Carolina Playmakers,\u2019 performed his one-act play, \u2018The Return of Buck Gavin.\u2019 The play witnessed Wolfe playing the title role. The group also staged his \u2018The Third Night\u2019 in December 1919.\n\nIn 1916, Wolfe joined the \u2018University of North Carolina,\u2019 where he was the editor of the student newspaper \u2018The Tar Heel.\u2019 His essay \u2018The Crisis in Industry\u2019 won him the \u2018Worth Prize for Philosophy.\u2019 He was a member of the \u2018Dialectic Society\u2019 and the \u2018Pi Kappa Phi\u2019 fraternity. He was an inductee of the \u2018Golden Fleece\u2019 honor society.\n\nWolfe\u2019s mother bought a boarding house named the \u2018Old Kentucky Home\u2019 on 48, Spruce Street of Asheville, where she moved in with Thomas. Though it was situated close to the family home on 92 Woodfin Street, where Thomas often went to meet his siblings, he mostly spent a lonely childhood. His older brother, Ben, died in 1918. This left a deep emotional impact on Wolfe, as he was quite close to Ben.\n\nWolfe was youngest of the eight siblings in the family. The first-born child of his parents, Leslie, died in infancy. His other siblings were Eddie Nelson, Frank Cecil, Mabel Elizabeth, twins Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison, and Frederick William. In 1904, during the \u2018World Fair,\u2019 he accompanied his family to St. Louis, where his mother ran a boarding house. One of his brothers, Grover, died of typhoid in St. Louis.\n\nWolfe was born on October 3, 1900, in Asheville, North Carolina, to William Oliver Wolfe and Julia Elizabeth Westall-Wolfe. His father was a stone carver, while his mother owned a boarding house and dealt in real estate.\n\nRecommended Lists:\n\nCareer\n\nIn November 1923, Wolfe went to New York City to raise funds for the \u2018University of North Carolina\u2019 and with an aim to see his plays on \u2018Broadway.\u2019 However, even after 3 years, he did not succeed, as the plays were lengthy and unsuitable for stage. In 1924, he joined the \u2018Washington Square College\u2019 of \u2018New York University\u2019 as an instructor for English. He continued to teach from time to time, until January 1930.\n\nWolfe went to Europe for the first time in October 1924. There, he visited France, Italy, and Switzerland. While returning in 1925, he met Mrs. Aline Bernstein, wife of a stockbroker and a mother of two. She was a scene designer for \u2018Theater Guild.\u2019 In October 1925, he got romantically involved with Aline, who was 18 years his senior. The two had an intense, stormy affair for the next 5 years. She proved to be a powerful influence and muse of his life.\n\nOn his second European trip in 1926, Wolfe commenced work on his first novel, initially titled, \u2018O Lost.\u2019 After 20 months of writing, he completed it in March 1928 and submitted the manuscript to \u2018Scribner\u2019s,\u2019 who showed immense interest in it. The lengthy manuscript was edited by well-known editor Maxwell Perkins. The two had a long and close association.\n\nPerkins edited the long autobiographical fiction to a manageable proportion. It was named \u2018Look Homeward, Angel.\u2019 The novel was about the protagonist \u2018Eugene Gant,\u2019 Wolfe\u2019s alter ego, who lived in the town of \u2018Altamont,\u2019 which stood for Asheville. It was published on October 8, 1929, and was well-received. Wolfe was considered one of the most promising American novelists of the time. However, his family and the residents of Asheville, who could easily recognize their references in the novel, did not take it well. Wolfe stayed away from the town for nearly 8 years. Soon after, he ended his relationship with Bernstein.\n\nin 1930, Wolfe went to Europe for a year on a \u2018Guggenheim Fellowship.\u2019 Later, he stayed in Brooklyn and continued to write. He withdrew his second novel, \u2018K-19,\u2019 after submitting it for publication. He published the short novels \u2018A Portrait of Bascom Hawk\u2019 and \u2018Web of Earth.\u2019 The former co-won the \u2018Scribner\u2019s Short Novel Prize.\u2019\n\nBy 1935, Wolfe had completed a short novel named \u2018No Door\u2019 and a collection of three more novellas. On Perkins\u2019s suggestion, in 1933, he began his second lengthy autobiographical novel, \u2018Of Time and the River.\u2019 Wolfe had reservations about the final edited product, though it sold better than his first novel.\n\nNot too happy with Perkins\u2019s severe editing, Wolfe signed with \u2018Harper & Brothers.\u2019 He made a speech at the 1935 \u2018Writer\u2019s Conference,\u2019 Colorado, (later published as \u2018The Story of a Novel\u2019), stating his struggle with his second novel. A collection of short stories and novels, \u2018From Death to Morning,\u2019 was published in November 1935.\n\nWolfe\u2019s writing was popular in Europe, especially in Germany. On his last two visits, he witnessed the treatment given to Jews in Germany, which culminated in his short novel \u2018I Have a Thing to Tell You.\u2019 After it was published, he was prohibited from entering that country.\n\nIn 1936\u20131937, Wolfe released his short writings through several publications. In 1937, he visited Asheville after nearly 8 years.\n\nIn 1938, he submitted a volume of his writings to Edward Aswell of \u2018Harper & Brothers.\u2019 He then began a tour of Western United States. He delivered a guest lecture at the \u2018Purdue University\u2019 and then visited 11 national parks. While in Seattle, he fell sick with pneumonia, which later developed in tuberculosis that spread to his brain. He was sent to the \u2018John Hopkins Hospital,\u2019 Baltimore, but died on September 15, 1938."}], "Thomas Clayton Wolfe died on September 15, 1938.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Wolfe", "page_content": "Thomas Wolfe, in full Thomas Clayton Wolfe, (born Oct. 3, 1900, Asheville, N.C., U.S.\u2014died Sept. 15, 1938, Baltimore, Md.), American writer best known for his first book, Look Homeward, Angel (1929), and his other autobiographical novels.\n\nHis father, William Oliver Wolfe, the Oliver Gant of his novels, was a stonecutter, while his mother, Julia Elizabeth Westall Wolfe, the Eliza of the early novels, owned a successful boardinghouse in Asheville, N.C., where Wolfe grew up. He was educated privately and in 1916 entered the University of North Carolina, where he wrote and acted in several one-act plays. In 1920 he enrolled in George Pierce Baker\u2019s 47 Workshop at Harvard University, intending to become a playwright. Several of his plays were produced at Harvard, including Welcome to Our City (1923), in which the town of Altamont (Asheville) first appeared.\n\nIn 1923 Wolfe left Harvard for New York City, where he resided for the rest of his life. Still intending to be a playwright, he taught at Washington Square College of New York University. In 1926, while abroad, he began work on what eventually became Look Homeward, Angel, in which he recounted the growth of an autobiographical protagonist, Eugene Gant, in the mountain town of Altamont. The book was a success, though its publication caused a great furor in Asheville.\n\nDuring the late 1920s Wolfe entered into a relationship with the theatrical designer Aline Bernstein, who appeared as Esther Jack in his last two novels and who wrote of their friendship in the novel The Journey Down (1938). After the publication of Look Homeward, Angel, Wolfe quit teaching to write full-time. His second novel, Of Time and the River (1935), takes up the story of Eugene Gant from his leaving home to attend Harvard until his meeting with Esther Jack. Wolfe\u2019s memoir of his life in the 1930s, The Story of a Novel (1936), describes his close working relationship with the editor Maxwell Perkins (q.v.), who helped him reduce the enormous manuscripts of his first two works down to manageable novelistic proportions.\n\nWolfe did not publish another novel during his lifetime, though at his death he left a prodigious quantity of manuscript, from which the editor Edward Aswell extracted two more novels, The Web and the Rock (1939) and You Can\u2019t Go Home Again (1940). These books depict the struggles of a young writer to become established in New York City and his first experiences with literary fame. A collection of Wolfe\u2019s shorter pieces and chapters of an uncompleted novel, The Hills Beyond (1941), and his Letters to His Mother (1943) were also published, as well as his Selected Letters (1956).\n\nWolfe was gifted with the faculty of almost total recall, and his fiction is characterized by an intense consciousness of scene and place, together with what is often an extraordinary lyric power. In Look Homeward, Angel and Of Time and the River, Wolfe was able to imbue his life story and the figures of his parents with a lofty romantic quality that has epic and mythopoeic overtones. Powerful emotional evocation and literal reporting are combined in his fiction, and he often alternates between dramatically effective episodes of recollection and highly charged passages of rhetoric. Though The Web and the Rock and You Can\u2019t Go Home Again contain episodes of great vividness, they are too often uncontrolled in their form and fail to sustain the epic tone of Look Homeward, Angel, which has become an American classic."}, {"url": "https://historicsites.nc.gov/all-sites/thomas-wolfe-memorial/history/biography-thomas-wolfe", "page_content": "Throughout his literary career, Thomas Clayton Wolfe mined the early years of his life to extract every scrap of truth from his experiences, and to carve these truths into art. He seemed to take little pleasure in the finished work, but would feverishly turn to the next. During his brief but eventful life, Thomas Wolfe traveled the length and breadth of the United States, sailed to Europe on glamorous ships, conversed with literary giants and film stars, and loved a famous, successful woman.\n\nHis first novel, Look Homeward, Angel, recounted the life of a young man born in western North Carolina, the son of a stonecutter and a woman who ran a boardinghouse. He once said the reason he wrote a book was to forget it. But he never did forget his experiences of growing up in the boardinghouse his mother ran in the mountain town of Asheville, North Carolina.\n\nTom's Life\n\nAt age five, while too young to attend, Thomas Wolfe followed his sister Effie to the nearby Orange Street School and the teacher allowed him to stay. Completing eighth grade in 1912, Tom was invited to attend the North State Fitting School, a new private preparatory school. The school was operated by John and Margaret Roberts. Margaret Roberts immediately noticed his interest in reading and encouraged studies in poetry and classic literature. Wolfe thrived under her attention and encouragement. He later inscribed a copy of his book Look Homeward, Angel to Margaret Roberts \u201cthe mother of my spirit.\u201d\n\nThomas Wolfe as\n\n\"Buck Gavin, \"\n\nUNC Chapel Hill,\n\n1919.\n\n\"Against the bleak horror of Dixieland, against the dark road of pain and death down which the great limbs of Gant had already begun to slope, against all the loneliness and imprisonment of his own life which had gnawed him like hunger, these years at Leonard's [school] bloomed like golden apples.\" - Look Homeward, Angel\n\nAt the age of fifteen, upon completing his studies at the North State Fitting School, Thomas Wolfe enrolled in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Tom soon became active in a number of campus organizations including the Dialectic Literary Society and the campus newspaper. During the induction of new members to the Dialectic Literary Society, Wolfe gave a solemn speech predicting that his portrait would one day hang in the Old West Hall next to that of Governor Zebulon Vance. His prediction was accurate. His portrait can be found hanging in the \u201cDi\u201d hall among the great leaders of the State. Wolfe was one of the original members of the Carolina Playmakers, a course in playwriting taught by Frederick Koch. Tom played the starring role in his first written drama, The Return of Buck Gavin, one of the earliest productions staged by the group. Wolfe was also a member of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity. In 1919 he was inducted into the Golden Fleece Honor society. The biographical sketch under his picture in the senior yearbook proclaimed, \u201cHe can do more between 8:25 and 8:30 than the rest of us do all day, and it is no wonder that he is classed as a genius.\u201d\n\nDespite his family\u2019s desire for him to return home and take a job as a teacher, Tom wished to continue his studies in graduate school at Harvard University. After convincing his mother to pay for his first year\u2019s tuition, he enrolled in 1920. Thomas Wolfe was awarded his Master degree in 1922. For three years, he attended the prestigious 47 Workshop, a playwriting class taught by George Pierce Baker. The 47 Workshop staged two of Wolfe\u2019s plays, The Mountains and Welcome To Our City. Many of the themes Wolfe employed in these plays would later become inspiration for parts of his novels. Upon leaving Harvard, unable to sell his plays, Tom took a job teaching English at Washington Square College in New York City.\n\nIn 1924, Wolfe took his first trip to Europe. During the return voyage home aboard the steamer Olympic, he met Aline Bernstein, a theatrical set and costume designer from New York. In spite of the fact that she was nearly twenty years his senior, and married with a family, they were immediately interest in one another. The result was a long-term relationship. Bernstein encouraged Tom to pursue his dream of becoming a writer. She supported his continuing travels in Europe to allow him the time and seclusion he needed to write. She convinced Wolfe to put aside playwriting and focus on writing a novel. Rejected by several publishing houses, Wolfe\u2019s first manuscript, O Lost, found its way to the desk of publisher Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons and their respected senior editor, Maxwell Perkins. Perkins soon realized the value of Wolfe\u2019s work. He also counselled Wolfe that it would require a good deal of rewriting before it was ready for publication. The final result, Look Homeward, Angel, was published in October 1929. Tom dedicated his first book to \u201cA. B.\u201d Aline Bernstein.\n\n\"He turned, and saw her then, and so finding her, was lost, and so losing self, was found, and so seeing her, saw for a fading moment only the pleasant image of the woman that perhaps she was, and that life saw. He never knew: he only knew that from that moment his spirit was impaled upon the knife of love.\" - Of Time and the River\n\nBefore its publication, concerned about the autobiographical nature of Look Homeward, Angel, Wolfe felt a strong need to return home to Asheville and see his family. In the book\u2019s note \u201cTo the Reader\u201d Wolfe he wrote that he \u201cmeditated no man\u2019s portrait here.\u201d The truth was that over two hundred characters were based upon living people, many living citizens of Asheville, including his family. Their personal flaws and failures were exposed for the world to see. Asheville was shocked, as was his family. The violent reaction in his hometown to his work resulted in a self-imposed exile from Asheville for the next eight years.\n\nOutside Asheville Look Homeward, Angel met with both critical and commercial success. For the next several years Wolfe divided his time between Europe and New York. In 1935, Scribner\u2019s published his second novel, Of Time and the River, and a collection of short stories, From Death to Morning. His second book was more commercially successful than his first, and soon Tom embarked on a plan for a series of novels, each presenting an aspect of the history of America from 1790 to 1935.\n\nIn 1937, Thomas Wolfe finally returned to Asheville to a warm reception. Unable to work on his writing, after spending time with his family and friends, he returned to New York. The following year, struggling with his manuscripts and feeling the need for a vacation, he travelled west. Tom spent the summer touring the West and visiting National Parks.\n\nThomas Wolfe sitting\n\non the rim of Crater\n\nLake, feeding a\n\nchipmunk, Crater Lake\n\nNational Park, Oregon,\n\n1938.\n\nExhausted and suffering from a fever and headaches, he checked into a Seattle sanatorium for rest and then a hospital. Suspecting a brain abscess or tumor doctors urged that he be sent immediately by train to Johns Hopkins Hospital at Baltimore. Exploratory surgery revealed tubercular meningitis of the brain. Sadly the disease had advanced too far for treatment. Thomas Wolfe died a few days later on September 15, 1938. He was only thirty-seven years old. The funeral was held at the First Presbyterian Church in Asheville. Following the service Thomas Wolfe was interred in the family plot at Asheville\u2019s Riverside Cemetery.\n\nWolfe\u2019s editor since late 1937, Edward Aswell at Harper and Brothers inherited Wolfe\u2019s unfinished manuscript. It led to the printing of three posthumous publications; The Web and the Rock (1939), You Can\u2019t go Home Again (1940), and a collection of short stories, The Hills Beyond (1941)."}, {"url": "https://www.vqronline.org/authors/thomas-wolfe%E2%80%99s-final-journey", "page_content": "On September 15, 1938, Thomas Wolfe, author of the novels Look Homeward, Angel and Of Time and the River, died unexpectedly at the age of thirty-seven. For the literary world, the death of the talented and ambitious young writer was a profound and tragic loss. As the New York Times observed in an unsigned article the next day\n\nHis was one of the most confident young voices in contemporary American literature, a vibrant, full-toned voice which it is hard to believe could be so suddenly stilled. The stamp of genius was upon him, though it was an undisciplined and unpredictable genius\u2026 . There was within him an unspent energy, an untiring force, an unappeasable hunger for life and for expression which might have carried him to the heights and might equally have torn him down\u2026 .\n\nMany publications echoed these sentiments, including Time in their Sept. 26, 1938 issue:\n\nThe death last week of Thomas Clayton Wolfe shocked critics with the realization that, of all American novelists of his generation, he was the one from whom most had been expected. He had almost finished his third novel when he contracted pneumonia in Seattle two months ago and was apparently recovering when an infection spread to his kidneys and heart. Rushed to Johns Hopkins hospital in Baltimore, he was operated on twice during the week, [and] died of an acute cerebral infection\u2026 .\n\nVQR had published one of Wolfe\u2019s earliest stories and the passing of this vital literary figure prompted VQR to solicit another. Nine months after Wolfe\u2019s death, the Summer 1939 issue of VQR contained the last words Wolfe penned, an excerpt from a journal called \u201cA Western Journey,\u201d written just weeks before he died.\n\n* * *\n\nOn October 4, 1938\u2014just nineteen days after Wolfe\u2019s death\u2014VQR\u2019s managing editor William Jay Gold wrote to Elizabeth Nowell, Wolfe\u2019s literary agent, to inquire about obtaining a piece by Wolfe even though \u201cprobably every magazine in the country is looking for stuff by him.\u201d He wrote\n\nWhat is the situation on Thomas Wolfe manuscripts? That sounds cold-blooded and vulture-like, I know, and I do find it a bit difficult to write about it like this. All of us here were deeply sorry and shocked to learn of his death, and to me it came almost as a personal tragedy, just as his books always hit me with a tremendous personal impact \u2026\n\nNowell replied to Gold\u2019s request a few days later: \u201cI am planning to go through the crates of script which he left and am going to make an inventory of it all with [Maxwell] Perkins, Wolfe\u2019s literary executor.\u201d This was, no doubt, a challenging task given Wolfe\u2019s notoriously illegible handwriting. Indeed, several months passed before Wolfe\u2019s affairs were sufficiently in order to allow Nowell to respond with good news. On Feb 1, 1939, she wrote to Gold:\n\nI now have something which I want to ask you about\u2014the very last thing of all that Wolfe ever wrote, finishing it just three days before he contracted pneumonia. It is called \u201cA Western Journey\u201d and is a sort of diary of the motor trip which he was taking in the west. He had intended to expand this journal, probably into a whole book, but naturally never got to it\u2026 . In form, it is a sort of diary, but its chief merit is the very lovely lyrical description and the individuality which was so markedly Wolfe\u2019s all through it.\n\nGold responded cautiously without promising an acceptance, but admitted that \u201cwe do want very much to have something by Wolfe, and this does look like our meat.\u201d He formally accepted the piece just a few days later; despite VQR\u2019s long relationship with Wolfe, it would be just the second piece VQR had ever published of his, the first being the short story \u201cOld Catawba\u201d in the Spring 1935 issue. Upon hearing of the piece\u2019s acceptance, Nowell remarked on the way VQR had bookended Wolfe\u2019s career:\n\nYou know that \u201cOld Catawba\u201d piece was the first thing of Wolfe\u2019s I ever sold as an agent; and \u201cThe Western Journey\u201d will almost undoubtedly be the last. In fact, \u201cCatawba\u201d was one of his earliest magazine pieces published.\n\n* * *\n\nThomas Wolfe in June 1938. (Photo by Edward Miller. Thomas Wolfe Collection, Pack Memorial Public Library, Asheville, North Carolina.)\n\nIn the spring of 1938, Wolfe\u2019s life was in transition\u2014he had just severed ties with his longtime editor and friend Maxwell Perkins and publisher Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons, joined Edward Aswell at Harper & Brothers, returned from Europe, and revisited Asheville for the first time since he had outraged his hometown with his portrayal of it in Look Homeward, Angel. During this time, Wolfe\u2019s writing was also evolving; witness to the Great Depression and Nazi Germany\u2019s rise to power, Wolfe wrote in February that his writing was becoming less focused on his own experiences and more socially conscious. He said that a young writer\u2019s first work \u201cshould be a very personal one, and [\u2026] he should see life and the world largely in terms of its impingements on his own personality.\u201d But encounters with people during his travels had changed his thoughts about the goals and duties of literature: \u201csince then I have never felt the same way about love or art or beauty or thought they were enough.\u201d His writing was about to take on a new scope, a global perspective. This change is perhaps best characterized by a note he wrote to Elizabeth Nowell in May 1938:\n\nI am tired, but otherwise I have not felt such hope and confidence in many years. It may be that I have come through a kind of transition period in my life\u2014I believe this is the truth\u2014and have now, after a lot of blood-sweat and anguish, found a kind of belief and hope and faith I never had before.\n\nDuring this period of personal and professional upheaval, Wolfe deposited a massive manuscript with Aswell in New York and then fled westward\u2014with a brief stop at Purdue University for a speaking engagement\u2014where he would eventually embark on a whirlwind automobile trip through all the western national parks. The trip was the idea of Raymond Conway of the Oregon State Motor Association, who suggested to Edward Miller, the Portland Oregonian\u2019s Sunday editor, that they attempt to show how cost-effectively a motorist could visit \u201cthe Western national parks within the time limits of the average man\u2019s vacation.\u201d To that end, they designed a trip to visit eleven national parks in just two weeks, passing the nights inexpensively in roadside lodgings. Conway and Miller had taken similar journeys that had resulted in travel articles for the Oregonian. Around this same time, a senior editor at the paper pitched to Miller the idea for a story about Thomas Wolfe, who was coming to the Portland area to search for some relatives. Miller responded, \u201cWho\u2019s Thomas Wolfe?\u201d\n\nMiller quickly learned who Wolfe was, and the two projects soon became one. Wolfe was eager to participate in the excursion. He wrote to Elizabeth Nowell on June 15 to say that he was about to embark \u201con what promises to be one of the most remarkable trips of my life.\u201d In an interview with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer two days later, he told a reporter, \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time in Europe, and I\u2019m just beginning to realize how much I\u2019ve been missing in not seeing my own country.\u201d\n\nOn June 20, 1938 Conway and Miller picked up Wolfe, who had never learned to drive. Miller described Wolfe at the start of the trip:\n\nHe was wearing a tan summer suit destined to becomes mightily wrinkled. In a single collapsible bag he carried a pencil and ledger. With these he nightly wrote the entries that became his thin and final volume, A Western Journal.\n\nRaymond Conway, Thomas Wolfe, and Edward Miller gather around their \u201cTravel Development Car\u201d before beginning their trip in Portland, OR, June 20, 1938. (Thomas Wolfe Collection, Pack Memorial Public Library, Asheville, NC.)\n\nIn thirteen days, the trio passed through Crater Lake, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Glacier, and a half-dozen other national parks. They covered more than 4,500 miles, Conway and Miller switching off at the wheel every hundred miles while Wolfe squeezed his six-foot-six-inch frame into the back seat. Despite the physical discomfort of being confined in the car, Wolfe was by all indications having the time of his life. Miller would later write\n\nTom told us that he had spent more time with the two of us\u2014that is, steady-diet time\u2014then with any person or persons since he was in the teens. And when you keep company with any one for two weeks steady, you get to know them rather well. And between Conway and myself, Tom put in a good deal more time with me because we hit for the beer counters while Conway was sleeping or keeping his books.\n\nIn addition to delighting in the companionship, Wolfe was enthusiastic about the scenery. This enthusiasm is abundantly evident in his decision to refer to the Grand Canyon as the \u201cBig Gorgooby,\u201d a decision that would later thoroughly confuse VQR\u2019s managing editor William Jay Gold, who asked, upon reviewing the manuscript, \u201cWas gorgooby simply the result of a mistake in deciphering Wolfe\u2019s handwriting? Or did Wolfe actually think of the Canyon in this splendid term?\u201d Miller clarified the issue in a letter:\n\nThis was Wolfe\u2019s pet nickname for the Grand Canyon. I would say that the spelling should be \u201cGaboochee\u201d. Conway prefers \u201cGooboocheee\u201d. You can take your pick. It was Wolfe\u2019s own invention and he said it over and over again to his great joy and satisfaction.\n\nThomas Wolfe feeds a chipmunk, Crater Lake National Park, Oregon, June 20, 1938. (Thomas Wolfe Collection, Pack Memorial Public Library, Asheville, NC.)\n\nThe trip ended on July 2, and, upon checking into his hotel, Wolfe received a message from his editor Edward Aswell praising the manuscript that Wolfe had given him in May. Aswell wrote that \u201cwhen you finish you will have written your greatest novel so far.\u201d The day after receiving this welcome news, Wolfe wrote to Elizabeth Nowell describing his trip in ecstatic terms and indicating his intention to celebrate Independence Day by \u201cbuying some firecrackers and spending to-morrow in H. M.\u2019s Canadian town of Victoria, B. C.\u201d Though the trip must have been exhausting, Wolfe seemed refreshed. On July 4, he wrote back to Aswell:\n\nI am feeling much better already. Although I have traveled ten thousand miles, five thousand in the last two weeks, and seen hundreds of new places and people. My fingers are itching to write again.\n\nWolfe at the southern rim of the Grand Canyon, June 23, 1938. Miller is visible in the reflection. (Thomas Wolfe Collection, Pack Memorial Public Library, Asheville, NC.)\n\nUnfortunately, Wolfe\u2019s good fortune and good spirits did not last. At the point when he was most exhilarated with life and most confident in his writing, he fell ill\u2014as Nowell posits\u2014by sharing \u201ca pint of whisky which he had bought with \u2018a poor, shivering wretch,\u2019 who probably had influenza\u201d on the boat from Victoria to Vancouver. Wolfe biographer Joanne Maudlin points out that he probably contracted the disease in another way since his excessive smoking and drinking would have placed him at high risk for pneumonia. However he contracted his illness, Wolfe was soon desperately ill with pneumonia and tuberculosis and died less than ten weeks later on September 15.\n\nIn his introduction to \u201cA Western Journey\u201d in VQR, Aswell reveals that Wolfe\u2019s journal of the trip was discovered in the hospital just hours after his death:\n\nHis mother undertook to look through his bags. And there it was\u2014a bound ledger of the kind used in simple bookkeeping [\u2026] The ledger was full to the last page of his almost illegible penciled scrawl with the title, \u201cA Western Journey,\u201d at the beginning.\n\nThe publication of Wolfe\u2019s piece generated much excitement among VQR readers, and William Jay Gold wrote to Elizabeth Nowell to inform her of the successful publicity surrounding the Summer 1939 issue, which would contain Wolfe\u2019s piece:\n\nI think you will be glad to know that the Publicity is doing exceedingly good work for us. Tom Wolfe readers all over the country are writing in for the special introductory offer we are making in connection with the Wolfe material, and we are really grateful to you for putting this bonanza our way.\n\nVQR paid $115 for the piece. The full journal of the trip would later be published as A Western Journal: A Daily Log of The Great Parks Trip (University of Pittsburgh Press, 1951).\n\n* * *\n\nThe text of \u201cA Western Journey\u201d is full of astute descriptions of dramatic western scenery\u2014\u201cthe bay-bright gold of wooded big barks,\u201d \u201ca valley plain, flat as a floor and green as heaven and fertile and more ripe than the Promised Land,\u201d \u201cvast, pale, lemon-mystic plain,\u201d\u2014but the people of the American West fascinated Wolfe as much as the scenery. He describes women feeding deer outside the hotel, the Indian children begging for pennies, the diverse spectators at Old Faithful, the motorists who stop along the road to play with the bears, \u201ca quaint old gal named Florence who imitates bird calls,\u201d the man who pulls his son back from a geyser (\u201cDon\u2019t lean over that, I\u2019ll have a parboiled boy\u201d). Wolfe\u2019s deep interest in people was also apparent to Miller, who later commented, \u201cWhat stood out to me was the enormous kindliness of the man, his intense sympathy for the average, untalented, decent person.\u201d\n\nWolfe admiring \u201cOld Faithful\u201d in Yellowstone National Park, June 1938. (Thomas Wolfe Collection, Pack Memorial Public Library, Asheville, NC.)\n\nBecause he delighted in the land and its people, the trip\u2019s end was melancholy for Wolfe. On the last day of the journey, he wrote:\n\nAnd so, at last farewell. They are gone, and a curiously hollow feeling is in me as I stand there on the streets of Olympia and watch the white Ford flash away.\n\nWolfe ended his journal and, with it, added the final pen strokes to a brief but brilliant career. In just twelve years he had created a body of work of such volume and quality that William Faulkner ranked him as the best novelist amongst his contemporaries and remembered him as the writer who \u201chad tried hardest to say the most.\u201d With its hastily scrawled but trenchant and voluminous descriptions, \u201cA Western Journey\u201d stands as a final testament to that effort.\n\nRead \u201cA Western Journey\u201d from our Summer 1939 issue.\n\nRead Edward Aswell\u2019s introductory \u201cNotes on \u2018A Western Journey\u2019\u201d from our Summer 1939 issue.\n\nAdditional Reading:"}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Thomas-Clayton-Wolfe/6000000005582272742", "page_content": "About Thomas Clayton Wolfe\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wolfe\n\nhttps://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wolfe-2120\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/1120\n\nhttps://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/104277501/family?cfpid=21...\n\nhttps://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/89349251/family?cfpid=485...\n\nThomas Clayton Wolfe (October 3, 1900 \u2013 September 15, 1938) was a major American novelist of the early 20th century.\n\nWolfe wrote four lengthy novels, plus many short stories, dramatic works and novellas. He is known for mixing highly original, poetic, rhapsodic, and impressionistic prose with autobiographical writing. His books, written and published from the 1920s to the 1940s, reflect vividly on American culture and mores of the period, albeit filtered through Wolfe's sensitive, sophisticated and hyper-analytical perspective. He became very famous during his own lifetime.\n\nAfter Wolfe's death, his chief contemporary William Faulkner said that Wolfe may have had the best talent of their generation. Wolfe's influence extends to the writings of famous Beat writer Jack Kerouac, authors Ray Bradbury and Philip Roth, among others. He remains one of the most important writers in modern American literature, as he was one of the first masters of autobiographical fiction. He is considered North Carolina's most famous writer.\n\nEarly life\n\nWolfe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the youngest of eight children of William Oliver Wolfe (1851\u20131922) and Julia Elizabeth Westall (1860\u20131945). His siblings were sister Leslie E. Wolfe (1885\u20131886); Effie Nelson Wolfe (1887\u20131950); Frank Cecil Wolfe (1888\u20131956); Mabel Elizabeth Wolfe (1890\u20131958); Grover Cleveland Wolfe (1892\u20131904); Benjamin Harrison Wolfe (1892\u20131918); and Frederick William Wolfe (1894\u20131980). Six of the children lived to adulthood.\n\nThe Wolfes lived at 92 Woodfin Street, where Tom was born. His father, a successful stone carver, ran a gravestone business. His mother took in boarders and was active in acquiring real estate. In 1904, she opened a boarding house in St. Louis, for the World's Fair. While the family was in St. Louis, 12-year-old Grover died of typhoid fever.\n\nIn 1906, Julia Wolfe bought a boarding house named \"Old Kentucky Home\" at nearby 48 Spruce Street in Asheville, taking up residence there with her youngest son while the rest of the family remained at the Woodfin Street residence. Wolfe lived in the boarding house on Spruce Street until he went to college in 1916. It is now the Thomas Wolfe Memorial. Wolfe was closest to his brother Ben, whose early death at age 26 is chronicled in Look Homeward, Angel. Julia Wolfe bought and later sold many properties, eventually becoming a successful real estate speculator.\n\nWolfe began to study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) when he was 15 years old; he was a member of the Dialectic Society and Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and predicted that his portrait would one day hang in New West near that of celebrated North Carolina governor Zebulon Vance, which it does today.[6] Aspiring to be a playwright, in 1919 Wolfe enrolled in a playwriting course. His one-act play, The Return of Buck Gavin, was performed by the newly-formed Carolina Playmakers, then composed of classmates in Frederick Koch's playwriting class, with Wolfe acting the title role. He edited UNC's student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for an essay titled The Crisis in Industry. Another of his plays, The Third Night, was performed by the Playmakers in December 1919. Wolfe was inducted into the Golden Fleece honor society.\n\nHe graduated from UNC with a B.A. degree in June 1920. In September of that year, he entered the Graduate School for Arts and Sciences at Harvard University, where he studied playwriting under George Pierce Baker. Two versions of Wolfe's play The Mountains were performed by Baker's 47 Workshop in 1921.\n\nIn 1922, Wolfe received his Master's degree from Harvard. His father died in Asheville in June of that year, an event that would strongly influence his writing. Wolfe continued to study for another year with Baker in the 47 Workshop, which produced his ten-scene play Welcome to Our City in May 1923.\n\nWolfe visited New York City again in November 1923 and solicited funds for UNC while trying to sell his plays to Broadway. In February 1924, he began teaching English as an instructor at New York University (NYU), a position he occupied periodically for almost seven years.\n\nCareer\n\nUnable to sell any of his plays after three years due to their excessive length, including a time when the Theatre Guild came close to producing his play Welcome to Our City before ultimately rejecting it, Wolfe found his writing style more suited to fiction than the stage. He sailed to Europe in October 1924 to continue writing. From England he traveled to France, Italy and Switzerland. On his return voyage in 1925, he met Aline Bernstein (1882\u20131955), a scene designer for the Theatre Guild. 18 years his senior, Bernstein was married to a successful stock broker with whom she had two children.\n\nIn October 1925, Wolfe and Bernstein became lovers and remained so for five years. Their affair was turbulent and sometimes combative, but she exerted a powerful influence, encouraging and funding his writing. He returned to Europe in the summer of 1926 and began writing the first version of a novel, O Lost, which eventually evolved into Look Homeward, Angel. An autobiographical novel that fictionalized his early experiences in Asheville, the narrative chronicled family, friends and the boarders at his mother's establishment on Spruce Street. In the book, he renamed the town Altamont and called the boarding house \"Dixieland.\" His family was fictionalized under the name Gant, with Wolfe calling himself Eugene, his father Oliver, and his mother Eliza.\n\nThe original manuscript of O Lost was over 100 pages and 66,000 words longer and considerably more experimental in character than the final edited version of Look Homeward, Angel. The editing was done by Maxwell Perkins at Scribner's, the most prominent book editor of the time, who also worked with Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Initially, Wolfe expressed gratitude to Perkins for his disciplined editing. It has been said that Wolfe found a father figure in Perkins, who had five daughters and found in Wolfe a sort of foster son relationship. Perkins cut the book to focus more on the character of Eugene, a stand-in for Wolfe himself.\n\nWhen the novel was published 11 days before the stock market crash of 1929, Wolfe dedicated it to Bernstein. Soon after the book's publication, Wolfe returned to Europe and ended his affair with Bernstein. The publication of the novel caused a stir in Asheville, with its over 200 thinly disguised local characters. Wolfe chose to stay away from Asheville for eight years due to the uproar; he traveled to Europe for a year on a Guggenheim fellowship. Look Homeward, Angel was a bestseller in the United Kingdom and Germany. Some members of Wolfe's family were also upset with their portrayal in the book, but his sister Mabel wrote to him that she was sure he had the best of intentions.\n\nAfter four more years writing in Brooklyn, the second novel Wolfe submitted to Scribner's was The October Fair, a multi-volume epic roughly the length of Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time. After considering the commercial possibilities of publishing the book in full, Perkins opted to cut it down significantly and create a single, bestseller-sized volume, which would be titled Of Time and the River. This novel was more commercially successful than Look Homeward, Angel. In a twist from the publication of his previous novel, the citizens of Asheville were more upset this time if they hadn't been included than if they had. The character of Esther Jack was based on Bernstein. In 1934, Maxim Lieber served as his literary agent.\n\nWolfe left Scribner's and signed with Harper Bros. By some accounts, Perkins' severe editing of Wolfe's work prompted him to leave the Scribner imprint. Other accounts describe Wolfe's growing resentment that some attributed his success to Perkins' work as editor. In 1936, Bernard DeVoto, reviewing The Story of a Novel for Saturday Review, wrote that Look Homeward, Angel was \"hacked and shaped and compressed into something resembling a novel by Mr. Perkins and the assembly-line at Scribners.\"\n\nWolfe spent much time in Europe and was especially popular and at ease in Germany, where he made many friends. However, in 1936, he witnessed discriminatory incidents towards Jewish people that upset him and changed his mind about the political developments in the country. Wolfe returned to America and published a short story chronicling the incidents called \"I Have a Thing to Tell You\" in The New Republic. Following that publication, Wolfe's books were banned by the German government and he was prohibited from traveling there. Wolfe did return to Asheville in the summer of 1937 for the first time since publication of his first book.\n\nDeath\n\nIn 1938, after turning in a large body of manuscript materials, over one million words, to his new editor, Edward Aswell, Wolfe left New York for a tour of the West. On the way, he stopped at Purdue University and gave a lecture, Writing and Living, then spent two weeks traveling through 11 national parks in the West, the only part of the country he had never visited before. Wolfe wrote to Aswell that while he had focused on his family in his previous writing, he would now take a more global perspective. In July, Wolfe became ill with pneumonia while visiting Seattle, spending three weeks in the hospital there. His sister Mabel closed her boardinghouse in Washington, DC and went to Seattle to care for him. Complications arose, and Wolfe was eventually diagnosed with miliary tuberculosis of the brain.\n\nOn September 6, he was sent to Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital for treatment under the most famous neurosurgeon in the country, Dr. Walter Dandy, but an attempt at a life-saving operation revealed that the disease had overrun the entire right side of his brain. Without regaining consciousness, he died 18 days before his 38th birthday. His last writing, a journal of his two-week trip through the national parks, was found in his belongings hours after his death.\n\nDespite his disagreements with Perkins and Scribner's, on his deathbed Wolfe wrote a deeply moving letter to Perkins, whom he considered to be his closest friend. He acknowledged that Perkins had helped to realize his work and had made his labors possible. In closing he wrote:\n\n\"I shall always think of you and feel about you the way it was that Fourth of July day three years ago when you met me at the boat, and we went out on the cafe on the river and had a drink and later went on top of the tall building, and all the strangeness and the glory and the power of life and of the city was below.\"\n\nThomas Wolfe is interred in Riverside Cemetery, Asheville, North Carolina, beside his parents, W.O. and Julia Wolfe, and his siblings.\n\nThe next day, The New York Times wrote: \"His was one of the most confident young voices in contemporary American literature, a vibrant, full-toned voice which it is hard to believe could be so suddenly stilled. The stamp of genius was upon him, though it was an undisciplined and unpredictable genius.... There was within him an unspent energy, an untiring force, an unappeasable hunger for life and for expression which might have carried him to the heights and might equally have torn him down.\" Time wrote: \"The death last week of Thomas Clayton Wolfe shocked critics with the realization that, of all American novelists of his generation, he was the one from whom most had been expected.\" Due to his early death, Wolfe spent the shortest amount of time writing of any major novelist during that time, with a career less than half as long as Fitzgerald, Hemingway, or Faulkner.\n\nAfterward\n\nWolfe saw less than half of his work published in his lifetime, due to the amount of the material he left at his death. He was the first American writer to leave two complete, unpublished novels in the hands of his publisher at death. Two further Wolfe novels, The Web and the Rock and You Can't Go Home Again, were edited posthumously by Edward Aswell of Harper and Row. The novels were \"two of the longest one-volume novels (some 700 pages apiece) ever written.\" In these novels, Wolfe switched his autobiographical character from Eugene Gant to George Webber.\n\nO Lost, the original \"author's cut\" of Look Homeward, Angel, was reconstructed by F. Scott Fitzgerald scholar Matthew Bruccoli and published in 2000 on the centennial of Wolfe's birth. Bruccoli said that while Perkins was a talented editor, Look Homeward, Angel is inferior to the complete work of O Lost and that the publication of the complete novel \"marks nothing less than the restoration of a masterpiece to the literary canon.\"\n\nCritical reception and legacy\n\nUpon publication of Look Homeward, Angel, most reviewers responded favorably, including John Chamberlain, Carl Van Doren, and Stringfellow Barr. Margaret Wallace wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Wolfe had produced \"as interesting and powerful a book as has ever been made out of the drab circumstances of provincial American life.\" An anonymous review published in Scribner's magazine compared Wolfe to Walt Whitman, and many other reviewers and scholars have found similarities in their works since.\n\nWhen published in the UK in July 1930, the book received similar reviews. Richard Aldington wrote that the novel was \"the product of an immense exuberance, organic in its form, kinetic, and drenched with the love of life... I rejoice over Mr. Wolfe.\" Both in his 1930 Nobel Prize for Literature acceptance speech and original press conference announcement, Sinclair Lewis, the first American to win the Nobel Prize for literature, said of Wolfe, \"He may have a chance to be the greatest American writer.... In fact I don't see why he should not be one of the greatest world writers.\"\n\nUpon publication of his second novel, Of Time and the River, most reviewers and the public remained supportive, though some critics found shortcomings while still hailing it for moments or aspects of greatness. The book was well-received by the public and became his only American bestseller. The publication was viewed as \"the literary event of 1935\"; by comparison, the earlier attention given to Look Homeward, Angel was modest. Both The New York Times and New York Herald Tribune published enthusiastic front-page reviews. Clifton Fadiman wrote in The New Yorker that while he wasn't sure what he thought of the book, \"for decades we have not had eloquence like his in American writing.\" Malcolm Cowley of The New Republic thought the book would be twice as good if half as long, but stated Wolfe was \"the only contemporary writer who can be mentioned in the same breath as Dickens and Dostoevsky.\" Robert Penn Warren thought Wolfe produced some brilliant fragments from which \"several fine novels might be written.\" He went on to say: \"And meanwhile it may be well to recollect that Shakespeare merely wrote Hamlet; he was not Hamlet.\" Warren also praised Wolfe in the same review, though, as did John Donald Wade in a separate review.\n\nWhile acclaimed when alive as one of the most important American writers of equal quality to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Faulkner, Wolfe's reputation has been \"all but destroyed\" since his death, although The New York Times wrote in 2003 that Wolfe's reputation and related scholarship appeared to be on an \"upswing.\" He is often left out of college courses and anthologies devoted to great writers. Faulkner and W.J. Cash listed Wolfe as the ablest writer of their generation, although Faulkner later qualified his praise. Despite his early admiration of Wolfe's work, Faulkner subsequently concluded that his novels were \"like an elephant trying to do the hoochie-cooochie.\" Ernest Hemingway's verdict was that Wolfe was \"the over-bloated Lil Abner of literature.\"\n\nTwo universities hold the primary archival collections of Thomas Wolfe materials in the United States: the Thomas Clayton Wolfe Papers at Harvard University's Houghton Library, which includes all of Wolfe's manuscripts, and the Thomas Wolfe Collections in the North Carolina Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. UNC-Chapel Hill presents the annual Thomas Wolfe Prize and Lecture each October at the time of Wolfe's birthday to a contemporary writer, with past recipients including Roy Blount, Jr., Robert Morgan, and Pat Conroy.\n\nThe \"Old Kentucky Home\" was donated by Wolfe's family as the Thomas Wolfe Memorial and has been open to visitors since the 1950s, owned by the state of North Carolina since 1976 and designated as a National Historic Landmark. In 1998, 200 of the house's 800 original artifacts and the house's dining room were destroyed in an act of arson during the Bele Chere street festival, the perpetrators still unknown. After a $2.4 million restoration, the house was re-opened in 2003. Return of an Angel, by Sandra Mason, is a play that explores the reactions of Wolfe's family and the citizens of his hometown of Asheville to the publication of his novel, Look Homeward, Angel. It was produced for several years in October, next door to the Thomas Wolfe Memorial, in celebration of Wolfe's birthday. Pack Memorial Library in Asheville hosts the Thomas Wolfe Collection which \"honors Asheville's favorite son.\" The Western North Carolina Historical Association has presented the Thomas Wolfe Memorial Literary Award yearly since 1955 for a literary achievement of the previous year. The Thomas Wolfe Society celebrates Wolfe's writings and publishes an annual review about Wolfe's work. The United States Postal Service honored Wolfe with a postage stamp on the occasion of what would have been Wolfe's 100th birthday in 2000.\n\nWolfe inspired the works of many other authors, including Betty Smith with A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Robert Morgan, author of Gap Creek, and Prince of Tides author Pat Conroy, who has said, \"My writing career began the instant I finished Look Homeward, Angel.\" Jack Kerouac idolized Wolfe. Ray Bradbury was both influenced by and included Wolfe as a character in his books.\n\nThe Thomas Wolfe Society\n\nThe Thomas Wolfe Society was established in the late 1970s to promote appreciation and study of the works of this famous American author. The Society meets annually in May at locations in the U.S. or Europe visited by Wolfe. Recent conferences have been held in Greenville, South Carolina, Paris, France, and Saint Louis, Missouri. The Society issues an annual publication of Wolfe-related materials, as well as its signature journal, The Thomas Wolfe Review, featuring scholarly articles, belles lettres, and reviews. The Society also awards prizes for literary scholarship on Wolfe.\n\nAdaptations\n\nIn 1958, Ketti Frings adapted Look Homeward, Angel into a play of the same name. It ran on Broadway for 564 performances at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, received six Tony Award nominations, and won the 1958 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Frings was named \"Woman of the Year\" by The Los Angeles Times in the same year. In 1972, it was presented as a television drama, as was Of Time and the River in a one-hour version.\n\nWolfe's play Welcome to Our City was performed twice at Harvard during his graduate school years, in Zurich in German during the 1950s, and by the Mint Theater in New York City in 2000 in celebration of Wolfe's 100th birthday.\n\nWorks and Essays\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wolfe#Works\n\nExerpt from Wikitree Wolfe-2120:\n\nThomas Wolfe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the youngest child of William Oliver Wolfe and Julia Elizabeth Westall His siblings were sister Leslie E. Wolfe , Effie Nelson Wolfe , Frank Cecil Wolfe , Mabel Elizabeth Wolfe, Grover Cleveland Wolfe , Benjamin Harrison Wolfe , and Frederick William Wolfe . The family lived at 92 Woodfin Street in Asheville, North Carolina where Tom was born. His father, a successful stone carver who ran a gravestone business. His mother took in boarders and bought and sold real estate. In 1906 Julia bought a boarding house named \"Old Kentucky Home\" at nearby 48 Spruce Street in Asheville, taking up residence there with Thomas while the rest of the family remained at the Woodfin Street residence. Thomas lived in the boarding house on Spruce Street until he went to college in 1916. Wolfe began to study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill when he was 15 years old. He was a member of the Dialectic Society and Pi Kappa Phi fraternity. Thomas was interested in becoming a playwright and in 1919 he enrolled in a playwriting course. Some plays he wrote in his life were \"The Return of Buck Gavin\" ,\"The Third Night\" and \"The Mountains\". He also edited UNC's student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for an essay titled \"The Crisis in Industry\". In June of 1920 Wolfe graduated from UNC with a B.A. He entered Graduate School for Arts and Sciences at Harvard University in September of the same year, where he studied playwriting under George Pierce Baker. In 1922, Wolfe received his master's degree from Harvard. His father died in Asheville in June of that year, an event that would strongly influence his writing. Wolfe continued to study for another year with Baker in the 47 Workshop, which produced his ten-scene play \"Welcome to Our City\".

He is known for his autobiographical fiction written in highly original, impressionistic prose. His books, written during the Great Depression show an almost obsessive interest in the self, particularly the development of the self within the context of the family and community.\n\nIn his personal life, the author was known by friends as an enthusiastic yet lonesome man, who often desired more than he was able to attain in happiness, health, and love. He died unmarried, young, and without having realized his full potential as an artist. His literary output included two novels published before his death: Look Homeward, Angel (1929), and Of Time and River (1935); and three published posthumously The Web and the Rock (1939), You Can't Go Home Again (1940), and The Hills Beyond (1941).\n\nHe was known for his passionate writing that clearly conveyed the emotional side of human experience. Though the lyrical quality of his writing, his vigorous rhetoric, and his vast command of the English language was what made him popular to readers, to critics he was considered egotistical, undisciplined, and dependent on editors, who greatly improved his manuscripts.\n\nBiography\n\nThomas Wolfe was born in the mountain resort town Asheville, North Carolina, the last born of a large middle-class family. His mother, Julia E. Wolfe, was a successful real estate speculator, and his father, William Oliver Wolfe, was a tombstone maker. His ancestors on his father's side were German-Dutch-English farmers who had settled in Pennsylvania, and his mother was a third-generation North Carolinian of Scot-Irish-English stock. His parents married in 1885, giving birth to eight children of whom only six survived into adulthood. Mr. Wolfe's alcoholism eventually divided the couple in 1906, and young Thomas was the only child to go into the custody of his mother. During his childhood, the family member he felt closest to was his brother, Benjamin.\n\nFrom the age of eleven, Wolfe attended a local private school from which he would graduate shortly before he turned 16. On September 12, 1916, he began to go to school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he joined the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and became editor of the school's newspaper. At Chapel Hill, Thomas developed an ambition for the theater through his work with the UNC Dialectic Society as well as the Carolina Playmakers.\n\nWhen Wolfe graduated, at age twenty, he went to Harvard to study playwrighting under Professor George Pierce Baker in his renowned 47 Workshop. The aspiring dramatist's first play at Harvard was The Mountains, a folk play about North Carolina. He received his Master of Arts Degree in Literature in two years, but stayed one year extra to further hone his skills as a playwright. Wolfe would later satirize the pretentiousness of Harvard life, and the 47 Workshop in particular, in his piece, Of Time and the River.\n\nThough Wolfe did not lack in talents, ultimately his personal style and temperament were not well suited to the theater, and he was unsuccessful in getting his plays produced after graduating from Harvard. He took work as an English instructor at New York University in 1924. He would teach there off and on until 1930, initially departing from the school after his first year there to work on his personal writing overseas in Europe. On his return voyage in 1925, he met the married Aline Bernstein, a successful set and costume designer in the New York theater, who was twenty years his senior. Thus began their turbulent affair which would last the next five years.\n\nIn June of 1926, Mrs. Bernstein and Wolfe vacationed in England, where Thomas began to write what would become his breakthrough work, Look Homeward, Angel. In the late fall of 1928, while in Vienna on yet another trip to Europe, Wolfe received a letter from Maxwell E. Perkins, the legendary editor at Charles Scribner\u2019s and Sons, asking him to meet with him in New York City to discuss his book. Perkins had also worked with Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald and saw in Wolfe potential to equal them. The following year, in October, the book was completed and published by Scribner's, with a dedication to Mrs. Bernstein for her artistic, emotional, and financial support.\n\nLook Homeward created an uproar in the author's hometown, as over 200 characters in the novel were easily identifiable citizens of Asheville. The book was banned from the public library and people were encouraged not to read it. Death threats were even sent to Wolfe, and it was not until 1937, that he would feel safe enough to return to the town.\n\nAround this time, Thomas' affair with Bernstein had reached a breaking point. In March of 1930, the author was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship that allowed him to travel to Europe and stay there for the next year, also providing the opportunity to finally end his relationship with Aline. When he returned to New York in February of 1931, he rented an apartment in Brooklyn and worked to complete his second book.\n\nInitially, Wolfe had been grateful for the extreme editing conditions he had worked under with Perkins, who had become almost like a father to him. However, with his second offering, the multi-volume epic originally titled The October Fair, Wolfe became disgruntled. Perkins cut the piece down dramatically to create a single, bestseller-sized volume, which would be called Of Time and the River. The young author would stick it out at Scribner's for two more of his publications, From Death to Morning (1935) and The Story of a Novel (1936), but the painful editing process, and his own fears that he was becoming too dependent on Perkins, caused him to abandon his relationship with Scribner's in 1937, and switch to Harper and Row under the editorship of Edward Aswell.\n\nDespite his disagreements with Perkins and Scribner's and Sons, Wolfe, on his deathbed, wrote a moving letter to his former editor. He acknowledged that Perkins had helped to realize his work and had made his labors successful. In closing he wrote, \"Let's think of the day we walked over the Brooklyn Bridge together, and the book had been published, and the first reviews were coming in, and the world with all its glory and beauty lay before us, and we were happy. That's the way I think of you now. I've met the dark man, and I don't think I was too afraid of him. But I know I have to go and I wanted you to get this before that happened.\"[1]\n\nOn a pleasure trip to the state of Washington with friends, soon after leaving Scribner's, Wolfe had come down with pneumonia. Complications continued and in September of 1938, he was admitted to John Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. There, Dr. Walter Dandy, the foremost brain surgeon in the country at that time, diagnosed Wolfe with tuberculosis of the brain. An attempt to operate on September 12th revealed that the entire right side of the patient's brain was overrun by the disease, and by this point it was too late for anything to be done. Three days later, on September 15th, 1938, never having regained consciousness, Thomas Wolfe died at the age of 37. He was interred at Riverside Cemetery in Asheville, next to his family at Riverside Cemetery. Another famous writer, O. Henry is buried in the same cemetery.\n\nMajor works and style\n\nStyle\n\nPerhaps the most autobiographical of America's major novelists of the time, Wolfe's highly literary and sentimental style could be overwhelming to readers more inclined toward traditional prose. His critics say his writing was tedious, long-winded, and self-indulged; while his admirers refer to it as intensely introspective, with highly original poetic prose. Said fellow Scribner's author, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings:\n\nWhen Wolfe hits it right with his gorgeous style, the effect is tremendously satisfying, emotionally like a symphony at its best\u2026. When a little of the torment has expended itself, you will have the greatest artist America has ever produced.[2]\n\nThough his opulent style has not dated well, it was considered very relevant by the generation that came of age in the middle decades of the century. It was Thomas Wolfe's writing that inspired the young Jack Kerouac to become an author, an influence most obvious in Kerouac's first novel, The Town and the City.\n\nWorks\n\nDid you know? Thomas Wolfe\u2019s novel \u201cLook Homeward, Angel\u201d contained thinly disguised portrayals of many local people from his hometown\n\nLook Homeward, Angel was Wolfe's first novel. Published in 1929, by Scribner's, it is heavily autobiographical, and Wolfe uses the main character, Eugene Gant, as a stand-in for himself. It shows his maturing from birth to the age of eighteen in the fictional town and state of Altamont, Catawba, which many believe to be a not-so-subtle mirror of his hometown, Asheville, North Carolina. Many of the characters of Look Homeward, Angel were also strongly based on real people from Asheville, and were often not portrayed in a pleasing manner. This resulted in a certain estrangement between Wolfe and his hometown, and it is speculated that this formed some of the basis for his later work, You Can't Go Home Again.\n\nThe title comes from the poem Lycidas by John Milton.\n\nLook homeward Angel now, and melt with ruth: And, O ye Dolphins, waft the hapless youth. (163-164)\n\nOf Time and the River, published on March 8, 1935, by Scribner's, is the sequel to Look Homeward, Angel and was an even greater success. The book chronicles the maturation of the autobiographical character, Eugene Gant, in his search for fulfillment, making his way from small-town North Carolina to Harvard University, New York City, and Europe. Wolfe examines the passing of time and the nature of the creative process as Gant gradually embraces the urban life, recognizing it as a necessary ordeal for the birth of his creative genius as a writer. As P. M. Jack observed in The New York Times, \"Of Time and the River is a triumphant demonstration that Thomas Wolfe has the stamina to produce a magnificent epic of American life.\"[3]\n\nYou Can't Go Home Again (1940) was one of two novels published posthumously from the October Fair manuscript. The last of Thomas Wolfe's novels, it tells the story of George Webber, who after having written a successful novel about his family and hometown, returns to find that town shaken by outrage and hatred over the truths exposed in the book. He begins a search for his own identity that takes him to New York City and a hectic social whirl: To Paris with an uninhibited group of expatriates, and Berlin, lying cold and sinister under Hitler's shadow.\n\nLegacy\n\nWolfe's mother's boardinghouse, now the Thomas Wolfe Memorial, has become one of literature's most famous landmarks. He composed many passages and created many characters based on boyhood remembrances experienced in this house. On July 19, 1949, the Memorial opened for the first time to the public, with an admission charge of $0.30. The first year drew 1,300 visitors.\n\nThe Thomas Wolfe Society was formed in 1979, responsible for various publications as well as an annual meeting held in different cities significant to Wolfe (Asheville, New York City, Paris).\n\nWolfe was inaugurated into The North Carolina Literary Hall of Fame when it was established in 1996.\n\nThe Thomas Wolfe Prize was established in 2000, by the Thomas Wolfe Society and the (UNC). It honors writers who share the same ambition, talent, and strength as Thomas Wolfe. Past recipients include: Tom Wolfe, The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test; Larry Brown, Billy Ray's Farm; and Elizabeth Spencer, No Place for an Angel.\n\nPat Conroy, who received the award in 2003, after his seventh book, My Losing Season, was released, related that his first teenage reading of Wolfe's Look Homeward, Angel was an event that set him on course to become a writer: \"I learned from \u2026 Thomas Wolfe: A book can change your life and change it forever.\"[4]\n\nAfter Wolfe's death, William Faulkner, considered by many to be the best writer of the Lost Generation-era, said that Wolfe was his generation's best writer; Faulkner listed himself as second.\n\nIn 2000, O Lost, the original \"author's cut\" of Look Homeward, Angel, was reconstructed by Matthew Bruccoli and published.\n\nAll of Wolfe's manuscripts are housed at the Houghton Library, Harvard University. Wolfe scholars continue to use these manuscripts to produce such works as the complete edition of The Party at Jack's, published in 1995.\n\nBibliography\n\nLook Homeward, Angel (1929) ISBN 0743297318\n\n(1929) ISBN 0743297318 Of Time and the River (1935) ISBN 0684867850\n\n(1935) ISBN 0684867850 From Death to Morning (1935)\n\n(1935) The Story of a Novel (1936)\n\n(1936) The Web and the Rock (1939) ISBN 0060913207\n\n(1939) ISBN 0060913207 You Can't Go Home Again (1940) ISBN 0060930055\n\n(1940) ISBN 0060930055 The Hills Beyond (1941)\n\n(1941) A Western Journal: A Daily Log of the Great Parks Trip, June 20-July 2, 1938 (1951)\n\n(1951) Letters (1956)\n\n(1956) The Mountains: A Play in One Act; The Mountains: A Drama in Three Acts and a Prologue (1970)\n\n(1970) Welcome to our City: A Play in Ten Scenes (1983)\n\n(1983) Mannerhouse: A Play in a Prologue and Four Acts (1985)\n\n(1985) The Collected Stories (Francis E.

His father, William Oliver Wolfe (1851-1922), was descended from hardy Pennsylvania German-English-Dutch farmers; his mother, Julia Elizabeth Westall Wolfe (1860-1945), was a third-generation North Carolinian of Scots-Irish-English stock. Surprisingly, Julia Wolfe did not operate the boardinghouse because of financial need. W. O. Wolfe made enough money from the tombstone shop he owned and operated on Asheville's city square to support the family. But former teacher Julia was obsessed with the real estate market and used profits from the boardinghouse's operation to buy more property. A shrewd and hard-nosed businesswoman, Julia Wolfe was remembered as a \"driver of hard bargains\" by family members.\n\nThe sprawling frame of the Queen Anne-influenced house was originally only seven rooms with a front and rear porch when it was constructed in 1883 by prosperous Asheville banker, Erwin E. Sluder. By the early 1890s, additions had more than doubled the size of the original structure, but the architecture changed little over the next 27 years. In Look Homeward, Angel Thomas Wolfe accurately remembered the house he moved into in 1906 as a \"big cheaply constructed frame house of eighteen or twenty drafty, high-ceilinged rooms.\" In 1916, Wolfe's mother enlarged and modernized the house by adding additional indoor plumbing and 11 more rooms.\n\nToday, the boardinghouse where Thomas Wolfe spent his childhood and adolescence evokes the daily routine of life in both fact and fiction. In Wolfe's second novel, Of Time and the River (1935), 14 years before the \"Old Kentucky Home\" became a memorial, Wolfe had already intuitively assessed the house's true importance. He said his mother's \"old dilapidated house had now become a fit museum.\" It is preserved almost intact with original furnishings arranged by family members in very much the way it appeared when the writer lived there. Memories, kept alive through Wolfe's writings, remain in each of the home's 29 rooms.\n\nThomas Wolfe was perhaps the most overtly autobiographical writer of this country's major novelists. His boyhood at 48 Spruce Street shaped his work and influenced the rest of his life. So frank and realistic were his reminiscences that Look Homeward, Angel was banned from Asheville's public library for over five years, and Wolfe himself avoided his hometown for nearly eight years to let the uproar die down. Today Wolfe is celebrated as one of Asheville's most famous citizens, and his boyhood home has become a part of our nation's literary history.\n\nOf Time and the River was a continuation of Look Homeward, Angel and Wolfe's last two major novels (published posthumously), The Web and the Rock (1939) and You Can't Go Home Again (1940), followed the events of his life in New York and Brooklyn, his wandering travels through Europe, his success as a novelist, and his final sad revelation that \"you can't go home again.\" Thomas Wolfe died tragically of tubercular meningitis on September 15, 1938, 18 days short of his 38th birthday.\n\nWolfe's mother lived on in the \"Old Kentucky Home\" until her death in 1945. Four years later her surviving sons and daughters sold the house to a private organization, the Thomas Wolfe Memorial Association, and it opened to the public as a house museum on July 19, 1949. The association continued to operate the memorial until 1958, when it was taken over by the City of Asheville. On January 16, 1976, the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources acquired the property.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nWolfe's Four Novels:"}, {"url": "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wolfe-2120", "page_content": "Thomas Clayton Wolfe\n\n3 Oct 1900 in Asheville, North Carolina, United States Bornin\n\nAncestors\n\n[spouse(s) unknown]\n\n[children unknown]\n\n15 Sep 1938 at age 37 in Baltimore, Maryland, USA Diedin\n\nProfile last modified 25 Apr 2023 | Created 4 Oct 2014\n\nThis page has been accessed 1,624 times.\n\nBiography\n\nThomas Wolfe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the youngest child of William Oliver Wolfe and Julia Elizabeth Westall .[1] His siblings were sister Leslie E.

The family lived at 92 Woodfin Street in Asheville, North Carolina where Tom was born. His father, a successful stone carver who ran a gravestone business. His mother took in boarders and bought and sold real estate. In 1906 Julia bought a boarding house named \"Old Kentucky Home\" at nearby 48 Spruce Street in Asheville, taking up residence there with Thomas while the rest of the family remained at the Woodfin Street residence. Thomas lived in the boarding house on Spruce Street until he went to college in 1916. Wolfe began to study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill when he was 15 years old. He was a member of the Dialectic Society and Pi Kappa Phi fraternity. Thomas was interested in becoming a playwright and in 1919 he enrolled in a playwriting course. Some plays he wrote in his life were \"The Return of Buck Gavin\" ,\"The Third Night\" and \"The Mountains\". He also edited UNC's student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for an essay titled \"The Crisis in Industry\". In June of 1920 Wolfe graduated from UNC with a B.A. He entered Graduate School for Arts and Sciences at Harvard University in September of the same year, where he studied playwriting under George Pierce Baker. In 1922, Wolfe received his master's degree from Harvard. His father died in Asheville in June of that year, an event that would strongly influence his writing. Wolfe continued to study for another year with Baker in the 47 Workshop, which produced his ten-scene play \"Welcome to Our City\". In February 1924, he began teaching English as an instructor at New York University , a position he occupied periodically for over six years. During his short life Thomas Clayton Wolfe wrote several lengthy novels, \"Look Homeward, Angel\", \"Of Time and the River\", \"The October Fair\", \"The Web and the Rock\" and \"You Can't Go Home Again\" plus many short stories, dramatic works and novellas.

It was there that he wrote his most popular work, Look Homeward, Angel (1929), an autobiographical piece centering on his alter ego, Eugene Gant. Wolfe followed with four novels over the following eight years and had more than 10 works published after his untimely death in 1938.\n\nEarly Years\n\nThomas Wolfe was born on October 3, 1900, in Asheville, North Carolina, to a stonecutter father and a mother who owned a boardinghouse. After attending a private prep school, Wolfe enrolled in the University of North Carolina in 1916. There he began his writing career, penning and acting in several one-act plays. Wolfe also edited The Tar Heel, UNC's student newspaper, and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for his essay \"The Crisis in Industry.\" Wolfe graduated in 1920, and in the fall he entered the Graduate School for Arts and Sciences at Harvard University, where he set his sights on becoming a professional playwright as a part of Harvard's 47 Workshop.\n\nIn 1923, Wolfe left Boston for New York, the city he called home for the rest of his life. He taught at Washington Square College of New York University and continued to write. Three years later, while abroad, he began work on what eventually became the novel Look Homeward, Angel.\n\n'Look Homeward, Angel'\n\nIn early 1928, Wolfe completed the manuscript for Look Homeward, Angel, and by summer he learned that Scribner was interested in the work. The book was officially accepted for publication in January 1929, and Wolfe began his long, close and tumultuous relationship with editor Maxwell Perkins (who was also famously the editor of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald). Perkins edited the manuscript down into a more manageable form (a process that would eventually mark the beginning of the end of the pair's working relationship), and it was published in October 1929 to great critical reception, placing Wolfe on the literary map as one of America's most promising young novelists.\n\nAnother consequence of publication was the furor caused in Wolfe's hometown of Asheville, as the cast of characters in the autobiographical book hit close to home for many of Asheville's residents.\n\nThe Road to Success\n\nThe following year, Wolfe received a Guggenheim Fellowship and published a second short novel, Web of Earth, and soon began preparations for several other works: K-19, No Door (a short novel) and a collection of three short novels. Wolfe's publication plan conflicted with that of Perkins, who wanted Wolfe to write a follow-up to the story of Eugene Gant, the protagonist of Look Homeward, Angel. Perkins began working with Wolfe daily in 1933 on this proposed book, and in the summer of 1934, ignoring Wolfe's objections, Perkins sent the manuscript of Of Time and the River to Scribner. The book was generally well-received upon publication, but Wolfe was bitterly displeased with it, blaming Perkins for the unsatisfactory form of the final product.\n\nAn Early Death\n\nIn 1936, Wolfe's dissatisfaction with Perkins led to a larger conflict with Scribner, and Wolfe left Scribner for Harper & Brothers. Two years after leaving Scribner, Wolfe left New York to travel to the American West. In July 1938, he became sick in Seattle, and two months later he was sent to the Johns Hopkins University Hospital. Wolfe could not recover his health, and he died at Johns Hopkins of tuberculosis of the brain shortly before his 38th birthday.\n\nAfter Wolfe's death, Edward Aswell, Wolfe's Harper editor, assembled from the manuscripts left behind the novels The Web and the Rock (1939) and You Can't Go Home Again (1940). Several other collections and uncompleted works also appeared posthumously, and Wolfe's legacy is that of one of America's strongest writers whose potential was cut tragically short.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Thomas Wolfe\n\nBirth Year: 1900\n\nBirth date: October 3, 1900\n\nBirth State: North Carolina\n\nBirth City: Asheville\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Thomas Wolfe was a major American novelist of the early 20th century, notable for his first book, 1929's 'Look Homeward, Angel.'\n\nIndustries\n\nEducation and Academia\n\n\n\nTheater and Dance\n\n\n\nFiction and Poetry\n\nAstrological Sign: Libra\n\nSchools\n\nUniversity of North Carolina\n\n\n\nHarvard University\n\nDeath Year: 1938\n\nDeath date: September 15, 1938\n\nDeath State: Maryland\n\nDeath City: Baltimore\n\nDeath Country: United States\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: Thomas Wolfe Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/thomas-wolfe\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E; Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: September 6, 2019\n\nOriginal Published Date: April 2, 2014\n\nQUOTES"}, {"url": "https://library.unc.edu/wilson/ncc/wolfe_bio/", "page_content": "by C. Hugh Holman\n\nThomas Clayton Wolfe (3 Oct. 1900-15 Sept. 1938), novelist and short story writer, was born in Asheville, the eighth child of William Oliver, a stonecutter from Pennsylvania, and Julia Elizabeth Westall Wolfe, a native North Carolinian. In 1904 he went with his mother and some of the other children to St. Louis, where his mother kept a boardinghouse during the World\u2019s Fair and where his brother Grover died, an event that he was to use with distinction in his fiction. In 1905 he began attending public school in Asheville and in 1912 moved to a private school operated by Mr. and Mrs. J.M. Roberts. Margaret Roberts was a major influence on his life and work.\n\nIn 1916 Wolfe entered The University of North Carolina as a freshman. In the summer of 1918 he was a civilian war worker in Norfolk; that fall he enrolled in Professor Frederick H. Koch\u2019s playwriting course at The University of North Carolina. On 14 and 15 Mar. 1919 his one-act play, The Return of Buck Gavin, was performed with Wolfe in the title role on the first bill of the Carolina Playmakers. Wolfe edited The Tar Heel, the University of North Carolina student newspaper, and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for an essay, \u201cThe Crisis in Industry.\u201d Another of his plays, The Third Night, was performed by the Playmakers in December 1919.\n\nIn June 1920 he was graduated from the university with a B.A. degree and in September entered the Graduate School for Arts and Sciences at Harvard University to earn an M.A. in English and to study playwriting under George Pierce Baker. Two versions of his play The Mountains were performed by the 47 Workshop at Harvard in 1921. In 1922 he completed the requirements for the M.A. degree, and in June of that year his father died in Asheville, another event of great importance in his fiction. Wolfe continued to study with Baker in the 47 Workshop, which in May 1923 produced his ten-scene play Welcome to Our City. In November 1923 he went to New York City, where he solicited funds for the University of North Carolina. In February 1924 he began teaching English as an instructor at the Washington Square College of New York University, a task that he continued to perform intermittently until January 1930. According to student reports, he was a conscientious and successful teacher.\n\nIn October 1924 he sailed for England on the first of what proved to be seven European trips. He traveled in France, Italy, and Switzerland, and on his return voyage in 1925, he met Mrs. Aline Bernstein, who was eighteen years his senior, a scene designer for the Theater Guild and the wife of a successful stockbroker. In October 1925 she became his mistress. Their affair was stormy, but Aline Bernstein was one of the powerful influences on his life. In the summer of 1926 he returned to Europe and there began work on the first version of his novel Look Homeward, Angel. In the summer of 1927 he made his third European journey, traveling in France, Austria, and Germany.\n\nOn 31 Mar. 1928 he completed the manuscript for the novel Look Homeward, Angel. That summer he made his fourth European trip, was injured in a fight at the Oktoberfest in Munich, and received news of Scribner\u2019s interest in Look Homeward, Angel, which was accepted for publication in January, beginning his long, close, and sometimes painful association with the editor Maxwell Perkins. The amount of editing done of the manuscript by Perkins has been greatly exaggerated. The novel, when published on 8 Oct. 1929, was of all Wolfe\u2019s long works the one closest to his original plan. It sold only moderately well, but it was a great critical success, and Wolfe was hailed as the most promising young American novelist.\n\nIn 1930 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship and made his fifth European tour. On his return in the late spring of 1931, he began living in Brooklyn. The following year his tempestuous affair with Mrs. Bernstein ended. Perkins, after first putting it into production, withdrew his second novel, K-19, which remained unpublished. His short novel, A Portrait of Bascom Hawke, appeared in Scribner\u2019s Magazine, and it was co-winner of the $5,000 Scribner\u2019s Short Novel Prize.\n\nIn July he published a second short novel, Web of Earth, one of his best works.\n\nDuring the period between 1932 and 1935 Wolfe prepared three books for publication, K-19, No Door, a short novel, and a collection of three short novels. Perkins, however, insisted that Wolfe must come forward with a long work continuing his saga of Eugene Gant, the protagonist of Look Homeward, Angel. Wolfe was having difficulty with the large book although he was publishing excellent short stories and short novels. In 1933 Perkins began to work with him daily on the \u201cbig book\u201d and finally, in July 1934, over Wolfe\u2019s protests, sent the manuscript of Of Time and the River to the publishers. On its publication Wolfe was bitter about the shape of the book, declaring that had he been allowed to, he would have made it much better. The critics, although generally approving, did find the work to be sprawling and ill organized.\n\nIn 1935 he participated in the Writer\u2019s Conference at Boulder, Colo., and his speech made there was published as a serial in The Saturday Review of Literature and as a book, The Story of a Novel. This work recounts his struggle to produce Of Time and the River. In November 1935 From Death to Morning, a collection of short novels and short stories, was published.\n\nIn 1935 and 1936 Wolfe made his sixth and seventh European trips, spending much time in Germany, where translations of his works had made him a very popular figure. In 1936, leaving Berlin on a train, an incident with a Jew trying to escape Germany forced him to recognize the cruel nature of the Nazi state, and on returning home he wrote one of his most powerful short novels, I Have a Thing To Tell You, a strong indictment of Germany, which was serialized in The New Republic. Like many of his short novels, it was later incorporated in expanded form in one of his novels, in this case You Can\u2019t Go Home Again.\n\nIn 1936 his quarrel with his publisher, Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons, began; it grew out of his sense that Perkins was preventing him from writing what he truly wished to write, and it was exacerbated by what he felt was Scribner\u2019s unwillingness to defend him in a libel suit and by his unhappiness about the reputation that Of Time and the River and The Story of a Novel gave him of being a prodigious but formless writer whose works were shaped by his editor. This struggle with Scribner\u2019s continued throughout 1937, until in December he signed a contract with Edward C. Aswell, of Harper and Brothers, for the publication of his later work. However turbulent this period was emotionally, it was one of the most fruitful for Wolfe in terms of short publications in such journals as The New Republic, The New Yorker, Scribner\u2019s, American Mercury, Harpers Bazaar, the Yale Review, and The Saturday Evening Post.\n\nIn 1938 he left New York for a western tour, depositing the large body of manuscript materials that he had with his new editor, Edward C. Aswell. On the way west, he stopped by Purdue University and gave a lecture, \u201cWriting and Living\u201d (published in 1964). In July 1938 he became ill in Seattle and on 6 September he was sent to the Johns Hopkins University Hospital, where he died of tuberculosis of the brain, eighteen days before his thirty-eighth birthday.\n\nAfter Wolfe\u2019s death, Edward Aswell assembled from the manuscripts the novels The Web and the Rock and You Can\u2019t Go Home Again, which were published in 1939 and 1940. A collection of short stories and sketches and fragments of a novel were published as The Hills Beyond in 1941. In assembling these works, Aswell worked from Wolfe\u2019s outline and organized the material in the huge but incomplete collection of manuscripts that Wolfe had left. The Web and the Rock, which deals with a new protagonist George Webber, is pretty much the novel that Wolfe would have produced, although the latter two-thirds would certainly have been greatly revised. You Can\u2019t Go Home Again, also about Webber, is largely a collection of materials, with narrative links written by Aswell to bridge the gaps. Thus only in his short stories, short novels, and Look Homeward, Angel does Wolfe\u2019s work survive in a a form in which he himself was the principal agent of organization. Of Time and the River carried too much of Maxwell Perkins intention rather than Wolfe\u2019s, even to being in the third person when Wolfe had written most of it in the first person. The last two novels had to be given their present shape by Aswell with only Wolfe\u2019s outline to assist him.\n\nIn 1991 The University of North Carolina Press and Paul Gitlin, administrator of the estate of Thomas Wolfe, brought out The Good Child\u2019s River, an unfinished novel \u201cbased loosely on the early life of\u201d Aline Bernstein, edited and with an introduction by Suzanne Stutman. According to the jacket, \u201cSome sections of this work were heavily edited and published after Wolfe\u2019s death. Here for the first time is The Good Child\u2019s River, as Wolfe wrote it, along with some fragments, contained in two appendixes, that Wolfe may have intended to include in the finished work.\u201d\n\nThomas Wolfe was a writer of enormous energy and imaginative force, marked by a richly rhetorical style and powerful command of language. The subject of the bulk of his writing was his own experience as an American. He was in the tradition of Walt Whitman, attempting through the record of himself to explain and define what it meant to be an American. His work is marred by excesses and exuberance, and of his novels, only Look Homeward, Angel has the firm shape that he himself gave it. Out of these facts has grown the legend that Wolfe was an uncontrolled and excessive writer, blessed with the gift of language but unable to control the structure of his works. But his thiry-two short stories and his seven short novels indicate quite clearly that this was not true. In the short length of the story and the intermediate length of the short novel, he was able to write tightly organized, powerful, and convincing stories, and it was only when he began to assemble these works into large structures, such as those that Perkins imposed on him in the early 1930s, that his lack of artistic control became apparent.\n\nWolfe\u2019s subject was always himself and his experiences, transmuted by the imagination and elevated by the power of his rhetoric. His effort to put a person, himself, fully \u201con record\u201d through the guise of fiction was a major and masterful accomplishment in the American novel, and at the time of his death he was ranked among the top three or four twentieth-century American novelists. His critical stock has fallen severely since his death in 1938, yet his command of language, the strength of his characterizations, and the power with which he could describe the experiences and feelings of youth were all such that his place as a permanent figure in American writing seems assured.\n\nFrom the Dictionary of North Carolina Biography, edited by William S.

His highly autobiographical novels are notable for fervent energy, uninhibited emotion, and grandly rhetorical language.\n\nThomas Wolfe achieved critical acclaim for his unabashed romanticism and visionary faith in the inherent greatness of America and the heroism of its people. He possessed an extraordinary ability for portraiture and a gift for visual detail and sensory impressions, but his brilliance is often diminished in a diffuse sea of inflated irrelevancies and ranting incantations and exhortations. Modern critics have grown less infatuated with his prose and become more aware of the lack of thematic focus, structural cohesion, and controlling artistic intelligence in even his most disciplined work.\n\nThe most striking irony in Wolfe's work is that despite his spontaneous emotionalism there is an absence of compassion for any character other than his self-identifying protagonist, and despite his mystic exaltation of sex there is little credible sexuality and even less love.\n\nLonely Childhood\n\nWolfe was born on Oct. 3, 1900, in Asheville, N.C. His mother had been a schoolteacher before marrying William O. Wolfe, a stonecutter and a man of towering assertiveness and drive. After the parents split up, Wolfe's lonely childhood was spent shuttling between the two. The death of his older brother Ben, whom he idolized, left an emotional scar from which he never recovered.\n\nAfter an outstanding scholastic record, at the age of 15 Wolfe was admitted to the University of North Carolina, where he became active in various publications and theater groups. Two plays were produced: The Return of Buck Gavin (published 1924) and The Third Night (1938). Upon graduation the embryonic author continued at Harvard University, eventually earning a master of arts degree. His involvement with the famous Playwright Workshop led to Welcome to Our City (produced at Harvard, 1923) and to work on Mannerhouse (published 1948), concerning the disintegration of a southern family. His professors' enthusiasm encouraged Wolfe to move to New York in 1923 to seek success in the theater. Failure forced him to accept a position as English instructor at New York University. In 1924 in Europe he met Aline Bernstein, a married mother of two, 16 years his senior, with whom he had a brief but intense love affair.\n\nLook Homeward, Angel\n\nIn 1926 Wolfe began work on an enormous novel which would explore and explain \"the strange and bitter magic of life.\" After some 20 months of furious writing, Wolfe left the huge, sprawling manuscript with Maxwell Perkins, editor of Scribner's. Though impressed with the author's genius, Perkins would not publish the novel until it was considerably revised and drastically cut. After a great deal of reworking and editing, Look Homeward, Angel appeared in 1929. Opening with a 90-page account of the early lives of his father and mother, the novel is a thinly disguised autobiographical record of the author's early years in the person of Eugene Gant.\n\nIn contrast to the critics' instant praise, Wolfe earned the hostility of many relatives and friends who easily recognized themselves in the novel. Though recent critical judgment of the work has been tempered by the recognition of its romantic and at times adolescent pretentiousness, Look Homeward, Angel contains vigorous prose and sequences of unquestionable power, such as the chilling conversation between Eugene and the ghost of his brother Ben, and the graphic description of his father's struggle against cancer. It is Wolfe's major contribution to American literature.\n\nWolfe resigned from New York University in 1930 and returned to Europe for a year on a fellowship. He had in mind a vast novel of several volumes which would range in time from the Civil War to the present and would replace Eugene Gant with a less autobiographical protagonist. After nearly five years of grappling with this conception\u2014while living in extreme loneliness and near poverty in Brooklyn Heights, New York City\u2014Wolfe recognized his inability to achieve a structural unity for the work.\n\nOf Time and the River\n\nPerkins insisted that Wolfe return to his previous autobiographical mode. Despite Wolfe's bitter protestations, a mammoth, haphazardly organized novel, Of Time and the River, appeared in 1935. Here the story of Eugene Gant continues, from his journey to Harvard University, through his period of personal turmoil in Europe, including an unhappy love affair, concluding with his return to the United States. The work's two outstanding sections are a vivid description of Eugene's ride to Boston and the horrifyingly effective account of the death of Gant's father.\n\nAlternating between hysterical affirmation and maudlin self-pity, the novel's young protagonist is a rather unpleasant individual whose heroic conception of himself is never sustained by objective facts. Most of the other characters are sketchily drawn, with the exception of the friend Starwick, who, like Eugene, is endowed with a tragic dimension, whose basis is never made clear. Eugene's relationship with Starwick and his horror at discovering his friend's homosexuality are psychologically ambiguous and absurdly melodramatic. The study maintains a strange effectiveness, however, because of its frequent insights into the abyss of human loneliness and the sterility of self-love.\n\nSeveral months after publication of Of Time and the River, Perkins collected several short stories and sketches extracted from Wolfe's earlier uncompleted novel. Under the title From Death to Morning, the uneven work was severely attacked by critics, although it included two of Wolfe's finest pieces of controlled narration\u2014\"Only the Dead Know Brooklyn\" and \"Death the Proud Brother.\" In 1936 Wolfe terminated his association with Perkins, largely to quell the rumor that the editor had acted as a near collaborator in the creation of his fiction, and signed with Edward C. Aswell, editor of Harper and Brothers.\n\nPosthumous Publications\n\nForgiven by his family and friends in North Carolina, for the first time in many years Wolfe returned home, where he spent several months writing and discovering that \"you can't go home again.\" He presented a voluminous manuscript to Aswell, the working outlines for a new series of novels. On vacation in the West, Wolfe suddenly contracted pneumonia, which activated a tubercular condition. He died on Sept. 15, 1938, in Baltimore.\n\nFrom the eight-foot pile of manuscript left him, Aswell compiled two novels, The Web and the Rock (1939) and You Can't Go Home Again (1940), and a volume of short stories, The Hills Beyond (1941). The novels are no less autobiographical than Wolfe's earlier ones, and despite some impressive prose in The Web and the Rock, there is no indication that Wolfe had begun to achieve mastery of his medium or to discover fresh thematic material. Wolfe's other posthumous writings include Letters to His Mother (1943), Western Journal (1951), and Letters (1956).\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe only biography of Wolfe is Andrew Turnbull, Thomas Wolfe (1968).

In assembling these works, Aswell worked from Wolfe's outline and organized the material in the huge but incomplete collection of manuscripts that Wolfe had left. The Web and the Rock, which deals with a new protagonist George Webber, is pretty much the novel that Wolfe would have produced, although the latter two-thirds would certainly have been greatly revised. You Can't Go Home Again, also about Webber, is largely a collection of materials, with narrative links written by Aswell to bridge the gaps. Thus only in his short stories, short novels, and Look Homeward, Angel does Wolfe's work survive in a form in which he himself was the principal agent of organization. Of Time and the River carries too much of Maxwell Perkins's intention rather than Wolfe's, even to being in the third person when Wolfe had written most of it in the first person. The last two novels had to be given their present shape by Aswell with only Wolfe's outline to assist him.\n\nIn 1991 The University of North Carolina Press and Paul Gitlin, administrator of the estate of Thomas Wolfe, brought out The Good Child's River, an unfinished novel \"based loosely on the early life of\" Aline Bernstein, edited and with an introduction by Suzanne Stutman. According to the jacket, \"Some sections of this work were heavily edited and published after Wolfe's death. Here for the first time is The Good Child's River, as Wolfe wrote it, along with some fragments, contained in two appendixes, that Wolfe may have intended to include in the finished work.\"\n\nThomas Wolfe was a writer of enormous energy and imaginative force, marked by a richly rhetorical style and powerful command of language. The subject of the bulk of his writing was his own experience as an American. He was in the tradition of Walt Whitman, attempting through the record of himself to explain and to define what it meant to be an American. His work is marred by excesses and exuberance, and of his novels, only Look Homeward, Angel has the firm shape that he himself gave it. Out of these facts has grown the legend that Wolfe was an uncontrolled and excessive writer, blessed with the gift of language but unable to control the structure of his works. But his thirty-two short stories and his seven short novels indicate quite clearly that this was not true. In the short length of the story and the intermediate length of the short novel, he was able to write tightly organized, powerful, and convincing stories, and it was only when he began to assemble these works into large structures, such as those that Perkins imposed on him in the early 1930s, that his lack of artistic control became apparent.\n\nWolfe's subject was always himself and his experiences, transmuted by the imagination and elevated by the power of his rhetoric. His effort to put a person, himself, fully \"on record\" through the guise of fiction was a major and masterful accomplishment in the American novel, and at the time of his death he was ranked among the top three or four twentieth-century American novelists. His critical stock has fallen severely since his death in 1938, yet his command of language, the strength of his characterizations, and the power with which he could describe the experiences and feelings of youth were all such that his place as a permanent figure in American writing seems assured."}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3145258-the-four-lost-men", "page_content": "The extended version of Wolfe's short story in memory of his father\n\n\n\nThe Four Lost Men is the first publication of the long version of Thomas Wolfe's story of familial and national reflection set during World War I.

These presidents are iconic figures in the recollections and political monologues of the teenaged narrator's dying father.

He is known for mixing highly original, poetic, rhapsodic, and impressionistic prose with autobiographical writing. His books, written and published from the 1920s to the 1940s, reflect vividly on American culture and mores of the period, albeit filtered through Wolfe's sensitive, sophisticated and hyper-analytical perspective. He became very famous during his own lifetime.\n\nAfter Wolfe's death, his chief contemporary William Faulkner said that Wolfe may have had the best talent of their generation. Wolfe's influence extends to the writings of famous Beat writer Jack Kerouac, authors Ray Bradbury and Philip Roth, among others. He remains one of the most important writers in modern American literature, as he was one of the first masters of autobiographical fiction. He is considered North Carolina's most famous writer.\n\nEarly life\n\nWolfe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the youngest of eight children of William Oliver Wolfe (1851\u20131922) and Julia Elizabeth Westall (1860\u20131945). His siblings were sister Leslie E. Wolfe (1885\u20131886); Effie Nelson Wolfe (1887\u20131950); Frank Cecil Wolfe (1888\u20131956); Mabel Elizabeth Wolfe (1890\u20131958); Grover Cleveland Wolfe (1892\u20131904); Benjamin Harrison Wolfe (1892\u20131918); and Frederick William Wolfe (1894\u20131980). Six of the children lived to adulthood.\n\nThe Wolfes lived at 92 Woodfin Street, where Tom was born. His father, a successful stone carver, ran a gravestone business. His mother took in boarders and was active in acquiring real estate. In 1904, she opened a boarding house in St. Louis, for the World's Fair. While the family was in St. Louis, 12-year-old Grover died of typhoid fever.\n\nIn 1906, Julia Wolfe bought a boarding house named \"Old Kentucky Home\" at nearby 48 Spruce Street in Asheville, taking up residence there with her youngest son while the rest of the family remained at the Woodfin Street residence. Wolfe lived in the boarding house on Spruce Street until he went to college in 1916. It is now the Thomas Wolfe Memorial. Wolfe was closest to his brother Ben, whose early death at age 26 is chronicled in Look Homeward, Angel. Julia Wolfe bought and later sold many properties, eventually becoming a successful real estate speculator.\n\nWolfe began to study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) when he was 15 years old; he was a member of the Dialectic Society and Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and predicted that his portrait would one day hang in New West near that of celebrated North Carolina governor Zebulon Vance, which it does today.[6] Aspiring to be a playwright, in 1919 Wolfe enrolled in a playwriting course. His one-act play, The Return of Buck Gavin, was performed by the newly-formed Carolina Playmakers, then composed of classmates in Frederick Koch's playwriting class, with Wolfe acting the title role. He edited UNC's student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for an essay titled The Crisis in Industry. Another of his plays, The Third Night, was performed by the Playmakers in December 1919. Wolfe was inducted into the Golden Fleece honor society.\n\nHe graduated from UNC with a B.A. degree in June 1920. In September of that year, he entered the Graduate School for Arts and Sciences at Harvard University, where he studied playwriting under George Pierce Baker. Two versions of Wolfe's play The Mountains were performed by Baker's 47 Workshop in 1921.\n\nIn 1922, Wolfe received his Master's degree from Harvard. His father died in Asheville in June of that year, an event that would strongly influence his writing. Wolfe continued to study for another year with Baker in the 47 Workshop, which produced his ten-scene play Welcome to Our City in May 1923.\n\nWolfe visited New York City again in November 1923 and solicited funds for UNC while trying to sell his plays to Broadway. In February 1924, he began teaching English as an instructor at New York University (NYU), a position he occupied periodically for almost seven years.\n\nCareer\n\nUnable to sell any of his plays after three years due to their excessive length, including a time when the Theatre Guild came close to producing his play Welcome to Our City before ultimately rejecting it, Wolfe found his writing style more suited to fiction than the stage. He sailed to Europe in October 1924 to continue writing. From England he traveled to France, Italy and Switzerland. On his return voyage in 1925, he met Aline Bernstein (1882\u20131955), a scene designer for the Theatre Guild. 18 years his senior, Bernstein was married to a successful stock broker with whom she had two children.\n\nIn October 1925, Wolfe and Bernstein became lovers and remained so for five years. Their affair was turbulent and sometimes combative, but she exerted a powerful influence, encouraging and funding his writing. He returned to Europe in the summer of 1926 and began writing the first version of a novel, O Lost, which eventually evolved into Look Homeward, Angel. An autobiographical novel that fictionalized his early experiences in Asheville, the narrative chronicled family, friends and the boarders at his mother's establishment on Spruce Street. In the book, he renamed the town Altamont and called the boarding house \"Dixieland.\" His family was fictionalized under the name Gant, with Wolfe calling himself Eugene, his father Oliver, and his mother Eliza.\n\nThe original manuscript of O Lost was over 100 pages and 66,000 words longer and considerably more experimental in character than the final edited version of Look Homeward, Angel. The editing was done by Maxwell Perkins at Scribner's, the most prominent book editor of the time, who also worked with Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Initially, Wolfe expressed gratitude to Perkins for his disciplined editing. It has been said that Wolfe found a father figure in Perkins, who had five daughters and found in Wolfe a sort of foster son relationship. Perkins cut the book to focus more on the character of Eugene, a stand-in for Wolfe himself.\n\nWhen the novel was published 11 days before the stock market crash of 1929, Wolfe dedicated it to Bernstein. Soon after the book's publication, Wolfe returned to Europe and ended his affair with Bernstein. The publication of the novel caused a stir in Asheville, with its over 200 thinly disguised local characters. Wolfe chose to stay away from Asheville for eight years due to the uproar; he traveled to Europe for a year on a Guggenheim fellowship. Look Homeward, Angel was a bestseller in the United Kingdom and Germany. Some members of Wolfe's family were also upset with their portrayal in the book, but his sister Mabel wrote to him that she was sure he had the best of intentions.\n\nAfter four more years writing in Brooklyn, the second novel Wolfe submitted to Scribner's was The October Fair, a multi-volume epic roughly the length of Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time. After considering the commercial possibilities of publishing the book in full, Perkins opted to cut it down significantly and create a single, bestseller-sized volume, which would be titled Of Time and the River. This novel was more commercially successful than Look Homeward, Angel. In a twist from the publication of his previous novel, the citizens of Asheville were more upset this time if they hadn't been included than if they had. The character of Esther Jack was based on Bernstein. In 1934, Maxim Lieber served as his literary agent.\n\nWolfe left Scribner's and signed with Harper Bros. By some accounts, Perkins' severe editing of Wolfe's work prompted him to leave the Scribner imprint. Other accounts describe Wolfe's growing resentment that some attributed his success to Perkins' work as editor. In 1936, Bernard DeVoto, reviewing The Story of a Novel for Saturday Review, wrote that Look Homeward, Angel was \"hacked and shaped and compressed into something resembling a novel by Mr. Perkins and the assembly-line at Scribners.\"\n\nWolfe spent much time in Europe and was especially popular and at ease in Germany, where he made many friends. However, in 1936, he witnessed discriminatory incidents towards Jewish people that upset him and changed his mind about the political developments in the country. Wolfe returned to America and published a short story chronicling the incidents called \"I Have a Thing to Tell You\" in The New Republic. Following that publication, Wolfe's books were banned by the German government and he was prohibited from traveling there. Wolfe did return to Asheville in the summer of 1937 for the first time since publication of his first book.\n\nDeath\n\nIn 1938, after turning in a large body of manuscript materials, over one million words, to his new editor, Edward Aswell, Wolfe left New York for a tour of the West. On the way, he stopped at Purdue University and gave a lecture, Writing and Living, then spent two weeks traveling through 11 national parks in the West, the only part of the country he had never visited before. Wolfe wrote to Aswell that while he had focused on his family in his previous writing, he would now take a more global perspective. In July, Wolfe became ill with pneumonia while visiting Seattle, spending three weeks in the hospital there. His sister Mabel closed her boardinghouse in Washington, DC and went to Seattle to care for him. Complications arose, and Wolfe was eventually diagnosed with miliary tuberculosis of the brain.\n\nOn September 6, he was sent to Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital for treatment under the most famous neurosurgeon in the country, Dr. Walter Dandy, but an attempt at a life-saving operation revealed that the disease had overrun the entire right side of his brain. Without regaining consciousness, he died 18 days before his 38th birthday. His last writing, a journal of his two-week trip through the national parks, was found in his belongings hours after his death.\n\nDespite his disagreements with Perkins and Scribner's, on his deathbed Wolfe wrote a deeply moving letter to Perkins, whom he considered to be his closest friend. He acknowledged that Perkins had helped to realize his work and had made his labors possible. In closing he wrote:\n\n\"I shall always think of you and feel about you the way it was that Fourth of July day three years ago when you met me at the boat, and we went out on the cafe on the river and had a drink and later went on top of the tall building, and all the strangeness and the glory and the power of life and of the city was below.\"\n\nThomas Wolfe is interred in Riverside Cemetery, Asheville, North Carolina, beside his parents, W.O. and Julia Wolfe, and his siblings.\n\nThe next day, The New York Times wrote: \"His was one of the most confident young voices in contemporary American literature, a vibrant, full-toned voice which it is hard to believe could be so suddenly stilled. The stamp of genius was upon him, though it was an undisciplined and unpredictable genius.... There was within him an unspent energy, an untiring force, an unappeasable hunger for life and for expression which might have carried him to the heights and might equally have torn him down.\" Time wrote: \"The death last week of Thomas Clayton Wolfe shocked critics with the realization that, of all American novelists of his generation, he was the one from whom most had been expected.\" Due to his early death, Wolfe spent the shortest amount of time writing of any major novelist during that time, with a career less than half as long as Fitzgerald, Hemingway, or Faulkner.\n\nAfterward\n\nWolfe saw less than half of his work published in his lifetime, due to the amount of the material he left at his death. He was the first American writer to leave two complete, unpublished novels in the hands of his publisher at death. Two further Wolfe novels, The Web and the Rock and You Can't Go Home Again, were edited posthumously by Edward Aswell of Harper and Row. The novels were \"two of the longest one-volume novels (some 700 pages apiece) ever written.\" In these novels, Wolfe switched his autobiographical character from Eugene Gant to George Webber.\n\nO Lost, the original \"author's cut\" of Look Homeward, Angel, was reconstructed by F. Scott Fitzgerald scholar Matthew Bruccoli and published in 2000 on the centennial of Wolfe's birth. Bruccoli said that while Perkins was a talented editor, Look Homeward, Angel is inferior to the complete work of O Lost and that the publication of the complete novel \"marks nothing less than the restoration of a masterpiece to the literary canon.\"\n\nCritical reception and legacy\n\nUpon publication of Look Homeward, Angel, most reviewers responded favorably, including John Chamberlain, Carl Van Doren, and Stringfellow Barr. Margaret Wallace wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Wolfe had produced \"as interesting and powerful a book as has ever been made out of the drab circumstances of provincial American life.\" An anonymous review published in Scribner's magazine compared Wolfe to Walt Whitman, and many other reviewers and scholars have found similarities in their works since.\n\nWhen published in the UK in July 1930, the book received similar reviews. Richard Aldington wrote that the novel was \"the product of an immense exuberance, organic in its form, kinetic, and drenched with the love of life... I rejoice over Mr. Wolfe.\" Both in his 1930 Nobel Prize for Literature acceptance speech and original press conference announcement, Sinclair Lewis, the first American to win the Nobel Prize for literature, said of Wolfe, \"He may have a chance to be the greatest American writer.... In fact I don't see why he should not be one of the greatest world writers.\"\n\nUpon publication of his second novel, Of Time and the River, most reviewers and the public remained supportive, though some critics found shortcomings while still hailing it for moments or aspects of greatness. The book was well-received by the public and became his only American bestseller. The publication was viewed as \"the literary event of 1935\"; by comparison, the earlier attention given to Look Homeward, Angel was modest. Both The New York Times and New York Herald Tribune published enthusiastic front-page reviews. Clifton Fadiman wrote in The New Yorker that while he wasn't sure what he thought of the book, \"for decades we have not had eloquence like his in American writing.\" Malcolm Cowley of The New Republic thought the book would be twice as good if half as long, but stated Wolfe was \"the only contemporary writer who can be mentioned in the same breath as Dickens and Dostoevsky.\" Robert Penn Warren thought Wolfe produced some brilliant fragments from which \"several fine novels might be written.\" He went on to say: \"And meanwhile it may be well to recollect that Shakespeare merely wrote Hamlet; he was not Hamlet.\" Warren also praised Wolfe in the same review, though, as did John Donald Wade in a separate review.\n\nWhile acclaimed when alive as one of the most important American writers of equal quality to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Faulkner, Wolfe's reputation has been \"all but destroyed\" since his death, although The New York Times wrote in 2003 that Wolfe's reputation and related scholarship appeared to be on an \"upswing.\" He is often left out of college courses and anthologies devoted to great writers. Faulkner and W.J. Cash listed Wolfe as the ablest writer of their generation, although Faulkner later qualified his praise. Despite his early admiration of Wolfe's work, Faulkner subsequently concluded that his novels were \"like an elephant trying to do the hoochie-cooochie.\" Ernest Hemingway's verdict was that Wolfe was \"the over-bloated Lil Abner of literature.\"\n\nTwo universities hold the primary archival collections of Thomas Wolfe materials in the United States: the Thomas Clayton Wolfe Papers at Harvard University's Houghton Library, which includes all of Wolfe's manuscripts, and the Thomas Wolfe Collections in the North Carolina Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. UNC-Chapel Hill presents the annual Thomas Wolfe Prize and Lecture each October at the time of Wolfe's birthday to a contemporary writer, with past recipients including Roy Blount, Jr., Robert Morgan, and Pat Conroy.\n\nThe \"Old Kentucky Home\" was donated by Wolfe's family as the Thomas Wolfe Memorial and has been open to visitors since the 1950s, owned by the state of North Carolina since 1976 and designated as a National Historic Landmark. In 1998, 200 of the house's 800 original artifacts and the house's dining room were destroyed in an act of arson during the Bele Chere street festival, the perpetrators still unknown. After a $2.4 million restoration, the house was re-opened in 2003. Return of an Angel, by Sandra Mason, is a play that explores the reactions of Wolfe's family and the citizens of his hometown of Asheville to the publication of his novel, Look Homeward, Angel. It was produced for several years in October, next door to the Thomas Wolfe Memorial, in celebration of Wolfe's birthday. Pack Memorial Library in Asheville hosts the Thomas Wolfe Collection which \"honors Asheville's favorite son.\" The Western North Carolina Historical Association has presented the Thomas Wolfe Memorial Literary Award yearly since 1955 for a literary achievement of the previous year. The Thomas Wolfe Society celebrates Wolfe's writings and publishes an annual review about Wolfe's work. The United States Postal Service honored Wolfe with a postage stamp on the occasion of what would have been Wolfe's 100th birthday in 2000.\n\nWolfe inspired the works of many other authors, including Betty Smith with A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Robert Morgan, author of Gap Creek, and Prince of Tides author Pat Conroy, who has said, \"My writing career began the instant I finished Look Homeward, Angel.\" Jack Kerouac idolized Wolfe. Ray Bradbury was both influenced by and included Wolfe as a character in his books.\n\nThe Thomas Wolfe Society\n\nThe Thomas Wolfe Society was established in the late 1970s to promote appreciation and study of the works of this famous American author. The Society meets annually in May at locations in the U.S. or Europe visited by Wolfe. Recent conferences have been held in Greenville, South Carolina, Paris, France, and Saint Louis, Missouri. The Society issues an annual publication of Wolfe-related materials, as well as its signature journal, The Thomas Wolfe Review, featuring scholarly articles, belles lettres, and reviews. The Society also awards prizes for literary scholarship on Wolfe.\n\nAdaptations\n\nIn 1958, Ketti Frings adapted Look Homeward, Angel into a play of the same name. It ran on Broadway for 564 performances at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, received six Tony Award nominations, and won the 1958 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Frings was named \"Woman of the Year\" by The Los Angeles Times in the same year. In 1972, it was presented as a television drama, as was Of Time and the River in a one-hour version.\n\nWolfe's play Welcome to Our City was performed twice at Harvard during his graduate school years, in Zurich in German during the 1950s, and by the Mint Theater in New York City in 2000 in celebration of Wolfe's 100th birthday.\n\nWorks and Essays\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wolfe#Works\n\nExerpt from Wikitree Wolfe-2120:\n\nThomas Wolfe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the youngest child of William Oliver Wolfe and Julia Elizabeth Westall His siblings were sister Leslie E.

Though it was situated close to the family home on 92 Woodfin Street, where Thomas often went to meet his siblings, he mostly spent a lonely childhood. His older brother, Ben, died in 1918.

In 1924, he joined the \u2018Washington Square College\u2019 of \u2018New York University\u2019 as an instructor for English. He continued to teach from time to time, until January 1930.\n\nWolfe went to Europe for the first time in October 1924. There, he visited France, Italy, and Switzerland. While returning in 1925, he met Mrs. Aline Bernstein, wife of a stockbroker and a mother of two.

The lengthy manuscript was edited by well-known editor Maxwell Perkins. The two had a long and close association.\n\nPerkins edited the long autobiographical fiction to a manageable proportion. It was named \u2018Look Homeward, Angel.\u2019 The novel was about the protagonist \u2018Eugene Gant,\u2019 Wolfe\u2019s alter ego, who lived in the town of \u2018Altamont,\u2019 which stood for Asheville. It was published on October 8, 1929, and was well-received. Wolfe was considered one of the most promising American novelists of the time. However, his family and the residents of Asheville, who could easily recognize their references in the novel, did not take it well. Wolfe stayed away from the town for nearly 8 years. Soon after, he ended his relationship with Bernstein.\n\nin 1930, Wolfe went to Europe for a year on a \u2018Guggenheim Fellowship.\u2019 Later, he stayed in Brooklyn and continued to write. He withdrew his second novel, \u2018K-19,\u2019 after submitting it for publication. He published the short novels \u2018A Portrait of Bascom Hawk\u2019 and \u2018Web of Earth.\u2019 The former co-won the \u2018Scribner\u2019s Short Novel Prize.\u2019\n\nBy 1935, Wolfe had completed a short novel named \u2018No Door\u2019 and a collection of three more novellas. On Perkins\u2019s suggestion, in 1933, he began his second lengthy autobiographical novel, \u2018Of Time and the River.\u2019 Wolfe had reservations about the final edited product, though it sold better than his first novel.\n\nNot too happy with Perkins\u2019s severe editing, Wolfe signed with \u2018Harper & Brothers.\u2019 He made a speech at the 1935 \u2018Writer\u2019s Conference,\u2019 Colorado, (later published as \u2018The Story of a Novel\u2019), stating his struggle with his second novel. A collection of short stories and novels, \u2018From Death to Morning,\u2019 was published in November 1935.\n\nWolfe\u2019s writing was popular in Europe, especially in Germany. On his last two visits, he witnessed the treatment given to Jews in Germany, which culminated in his short novel \u2018I Have a Thing to Tell You.\u2019 After it was published, he was prohibited from entering that country.\n\nIn 1936\u20131937, Wolfe released his short writings through several publications. In 1937, he visited Asheville after nearly 8 years.\n\nIn 1938, he submitted a volume of his writings to Edward Aswell of \u2018Harper & Brothers.\u2019 He then began a tour of Western United States. He delivered a guest lecture at the \u2018Purdue University\u2019 and then visited 11 national parks. While in Seattle, he fell sick with pneumonia, which later developed in tuberculosis that spread to his brain. He was sent to the \u2018John Hopkins Hospital,\u2019 Baltimore, but died on September 15, 1938."}, {"url": "https://worldsbeststory.com/blog/the-enduring-legacy-of-thomas-wolfe-an-exploration-of-his-novels-writing-style-and-impact-on-popular-culture/", "page_content": "Thomas Clayton Wolfe (October 3, 1900 \u2013 September 15, 1938) was an American novelist and short story writer of the early 20th century.\n\nHe is considered one of the most important figures in American literature of his time.\n\nWolfe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the youngest of eight children.
