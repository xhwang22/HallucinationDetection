Born in New Jersey, Lewis and a friend, Lucius Allen, traveled across the continent in 1851 to open a dry goods and grocery store in what was then a frontier town of about 800 people living along the west bank of the Willamette River. By 1880, their firm, Allen & Lewis, had become one of the leading wholesale grocery companies on the West Coast.\n\nSupporting transportation projects that affected his business, he was a member of the Portland River Channel Improvement Committee in the 1860s, invested in the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company in the 1870s, and was appointed to the original Port of Portland Commission in the 1890s. He helped form a local subscription library in the 1860s, and he was named to the city's first water board in the 1880s.\n\nMarried to Clementine Couch, daughter of another prominent Portland pioneer, Lewis fathered 11 children and after 1881 lived in a large, elegantly furnished house within walking distance of his office. He spent most of his time at work or at home, and had few other interests aside from church and charitable donations. He died in 1897 while walking to work on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in 1826 in Cranbury, New Jersey, Lewis moved with his parents at age 13 to Newburgh, New York. At age 20, he went to New York City to work in the dry-goods business of Chambers, Heiser & Company.[1]\n\nMerchant-entrepreneur\n\nJohn DeWitt, a New York merchant, hired Lewis in 1851 to assist DeWitt's son-in-law, Lucius Allen, in running a wholesale supply house in Portland, a frontier settlement on the West Coast.[2] Portland, with a population of about 800, was in good position to trade via the Willamette and Columbia rivers and the Pacific Ocean with San Francisco and other ports and by land with an increasing number of pioneer farmers in the Willamette Valley.[3] Allen, a friend of Lewis, had tried and failed in 1850 to establish a Portland branch store, and DeWitt thought that the more experienced Lewis would be able to help. In 1883 after several setbacks, the two men opened their own business (independent of New York) in a rented store at Front and \"B\" (Burnside) streets. They specialized in dry goods and groceries, building customer loyalty by selling at a fixed price, extending credit to reliable customers, and offering free space in their safe for storage of their customers' gold.[2]\n\nBy 1860, Allen had moved to San Francisco, a seaport city about 600 miles (970 km) south of Portland, where the company bought most of its supplies. He became a silent partner, uninvolved in day-to-day management. By then the firm of Allen & Lewis had begun to focus on wholesale markets, and by 1880, it was one of the leading wholesale grocery firms on the West Coast.[2] Lewis and three contemporaries, Henry W. Corbett, William S. Ladd, and Henry Failing, who arrived in Portland in 1851 and set up businesses along Front Street,[4] became \"merchant princes of the Northwest\".[5]\n\nWithin 10 years, this group of dedicated Front Street merchants and their families would dominate the economic, political and social life of Portland. All became warm and lasting friends with Ladd, the former teacher and railroad agent, first among equals... With Benjamin Stark and John H. Couch, who became Lewis's father-in-law, they formed Portland's earliest Establishment, one of merchant-entrepreneurs.[4]\n\nIn 1864, these four merchants and others formed the Portland River Channel Improvement Committee, to raise money to make the Willamette shipping channel more easily navigable. This led to a federally-funded project by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which dredged the channel in 1866.[6] In 1891, Lewis was named to the original Port of Portland Commission, established by the Oregon Legislative Assembly to oversee the maritime commercial and shipping interests of the city.[7]\n\nWhen railroads began replacing steamships as a shipping method in the 1870s, Lewis, Ladd, Corbett, Failing, and Simeon Reed (a Portland transportation executive), became the five largest stockholders, aside from Henry Villard, in Villard's Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (OR&N).[8] In 1888, Lewis was part of a group that visited Villard in New York to negotiate favorable shipping rates on the Union Pacific and the Northern Pacific railroads, with which Villard and the OR&N had contracts affecting Portland.[9] Lewis's interest in Portland railroads extended to the Portland & Willamette Valley Railroad, of which he became a local director in 1885, and which was controlled and formally taken over by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1890.[10]\n\nLewis and the other three pioneer merchants were among those in 1864 who formed the Mercantile Library Association (later renamed the Library Association of Portland) to establish a local subscription library. Roughly 30 years later, after a public library opened in Portland in 1891, members of the Cicero Lewis family were among its largest donors.[11] In 1885, Lewis was one of 15 men named to the Portland Water Committee, empowered by the state legislature to acquire and operate a municipal water system for the city.[12]\n\nFamily, other interests, death\n\nIn 1857 Lewis married Clementine Couch, daughter of John H. Couch, a sea captain and early Portland settler. Unlike many of his friends, Lewis developed few interests beyond his business. His only form of recreation was walking to work, and although he was a charter member of the Arlington Club and could have dined there, he usually walked home for lunch. Historian E. Kimbark MacColl writes that Lewis \"spent his life at his desk and never went out in the evening for entertainment or the theater... He was never known to have taken a pleasure trip, spending what remaining leisure time he had with his wife and 11 children.\"[13] Lewis died of a stroke in 1897 while walking back to work on a Saturday afternoon.[13]\n\nLewis was a member of the Episcopal Church[14] and a Mason.[15] He was one of the largest supporters of Good Samaritan Hospital and Trinity Episcopal Church in Portland.[13] After Lewis died, his wife funded a hospital addition named in his honor at Good Samaritan.[1]\n\nThe Lewis family lived in a house on Fourth and Everett streets until 1881, when they built a large house on a lot in the Couch tract in northwest Portland. The tract, consisting of half of the block between 19th and 20th streets and Everett and Flanders streets, was owned by Mary Couch, Clementine's sister, and was developed by other members of the Couch family.[n 1] The project consisted of four houses, each on a lot 100 feet (30 m) wide and 100 feet (30 m) long.[5] The Lewis property, facing 19th Street, included stables, a greenhouse, and a sweeping drive leading to a carriage porch. Their very large house was built in a stick style that was \"rather simple for its period\", but its interior featured tall windows, a massive staircase, front and rear parlors, a reception room with a marble fireplace, and tall mirrors in elaborate frames, as well as \"rare woods, marble mantels, brocaded walls [and] fine lighting fixtures\" throughout.[5] The four houses on the Couch tract were demolished in the 1960s.[5]\n\nNotes and references\n\nNotes\n\n^ Central Portland lies on the west side of a bend in the north-flowing Willamette River.

During a time of political corruption and violence, he wrote on what he believed to be the ideal form of government.\n\nBorn in 106 B.C., Marcus Tullius Cicero came from a wealthy landowning family. But he was not from one of the old patrician families that held most of the political power in the Roman Republic. He studied law and rhetoric (public speaking and writing) under a celebrated Roman orator and statesman.\n\nAs a young man, Cicero witnessed many great orators speaking at trials in the outdoor Roman Forum. They inspired him to seek fame and glory as a trial advocate (a type of early lawyer) and political leader.\n\nCicero along with boyhood friends like Julius Caesar, grew up as political crises began to overwhelm the Roman Republic. Revolutionaries had established the republic over 400 years earlier when they overthrew the last Roman king.\n\nThe Roman Republic, as it evolved over the centuries, attempted to satisfy the political demands of two major groups of citizens. First were the old aristocratic families and their upper-class allies, which included Cicero. The second group included everyone else, the commoners. Together they made up \"the people.\"\n\nThe Roman Republic had an elaborate system of checks and balances to prevent one man or one class from controlling the government. For example, while important government officials usually belonged to the upper classes, an assembly of \"the people\" elected them for one-year terms.\n\nInstead of a king, the republic installed two \"consuls\" to rule. In theory, they replaced the king as heads of state. Their main job, however, was to enforce the will of the Senate. Each consul could veto an act of the other. Most important, they took charge of the army in wartime.\n\nThe Senate was the center of power in the Roman Republic. Every man who served as one of the major elected officials became a lifetime member of the Senate. Senators set government policies and debated proposed laws. But when the Senate passed legislation, a people's assembly had to approve it before it became law.\n\nIn one more check on power, 12 elected tribunes represented the interests of the commoners. The tribunes could propose laws before the Senate and veto any of its actions.\n\nThis was how the Roman Republic was supposed to work. By Cicero's time, however, a number of fatal weaknesses had undermined the system. Rich Romans commonly bribed voters and trial jurors. Provincial governors (usually retired consuls) extorted money from people in their provinces. Military men periodically used their armies to back up political demands.\n\nOne feature of the Roman Republic worked in favor of power falling into the hands of one man. During wartime and other emergencies, the Senate could appoint a dictator with absolute powers for a six-month period. After this period, the dictator's power ended. In 83 B.C., however, Sulla, a Roman general, forced the Senate to appoint him dictator indefinitely. He then executed thousands of upper-class Romans to secure his power.\n\nThe 24-year-old Cicero witnessed it all.\n\nSavior of the Republic\n\nIn the year 81, Cicero launched his career as a trial advocate. In most of his trials, he argued for the defense in criminal cases. Cicero studied the gestures and speaking patterns of actors to give him an edge. Soon, his skills as an orator made Cicero the leading court advocate in Rome. Grateful clients made Cicero a rich man.\n\nAt age 27, Cicero married a woman from a wealthy family, but then left Rome to study philosophy and polish his oratory in Greece. When Cicero returned in 77, Sulla had resigned his dictatorship and soon after died.\n\nAt age 30, Cicero decided to begin a political career. His goal was to become a consul. Politicians usually had to climb a political ladder, winning election to several government positions in a certain order before running for consul.\n\nCicero won all his elections and then campaigned for one of the consul positions in 64. He ran as a \"New Man,\" meaning he did not have the advantage of coming from one of the old patrician families. He depended on his oratory, reputation as a court advocate, and honesty. Cicero's chief opponent, an arrogant patrician named Catilina, ran on a platform of canceling all debts, including his own. Many believed he had participated in several murders. Cicero accused him of being \"soaked in blood.\"\n\nCicero won by a big margin. Catilina was so angry that he plotted to stage a violent take-over of the government. When Cicero took office, he learned of the plot and secured \"emergency powers\" from the Senate to defend the Republic. Catilina fled the city, but his top lieutenants stupidly wrote down the details of their plan to kill all the senators. When this fell into Cicero's hands, he arrested five plot leaders.\n\nCicero wanted to execute the five leaders immediately because of the emergency then in force. Roman law, however, normally required a trial before imposing the death penalty. Caesar, a general and member of the Senate, said execution without trial would set a bad precedent. But most senators finally agreed with Cicero. He personally supervised the execution of the men, and the Senate proclaimed him savior of the Republic. Cicero thoroughly enjoyed the glory.\n\nCaesar, elected a consul for the year 59, allied himself with two other army generals, Pompey and Crassus. With thousands of soldiers behind them, the three military men, called the \"Triumvirate,\" intimidated the Senate with their political demands. They also asked Cicero to join them, but he refused, believing the Triumvirate was a threat to the Republic.\n\nAfter completing his year as consul, Caesar took his troops to fight uprisings in Gaul (which encompassed today's France, Belgium, and northern Italy). Even so, the Triumvirate remained a powerful force in Roman politics.\n\nCicero's Ideal Government\n\nCicero resumed his trial work, but his political career had stalled. He decided to turn to writing as a way to influence public affairs.\n\nIn 56, Cicero wrote two important books on government, known today as The Laws and The Republic. He wrote these books in the form of dialogues, discussions among friends, modeled after earlier works by the Greek philosopher Plato. Cicero wrote on papyrus scrolls and published his writings by using the common practice of having slaves copy them.\n\nIn these two books, Cicero wanted to restore the republic to its uncorrupted and truest form, which he believed had existed several generations earlier. He intended to persuade good and honorable men to participate actively in public affairs. Politics, he argued, was the most honorable of all professions. His ideas were not new. He relied on Greek and Roman writings, many of which were later lost.\n\nIn The Laws, Cicero explored his concept of natural law. \"Law is the highest reason,\" he wrote, \"implanted in Nature, which commands what ought to be done and forbids the opposite.\" Thus, natural law is the guide for right and wrong in human affairs.\n\nSince reason \"is certainly common to us all,\" Cicero asserted, the law in nature is \"eternal and unchangeable, binding at all times upon all peoples.\" Cicero warned that it was \"never morally right\" for humans to make laws that violate natural law.\n\nWithout laws, Cicero reasoned, there can be no state or government. More important, he continued, there must be equality under the law with no special exceptions. This is essential, he said, for justice, which in turn is necessary for a successfully functioning government.\n\nIn The Republic, Cicero argued that laws are not enough for a just state. There also must be liberty. \"But if liberty is not equally enjoyed by all the citizens,\" he declared, \"it is not liberty at all.\" Therefore, liberty cannot exist unless \"the people have the supreme power\" in government.\n\nCicero looked into the ideal form of government for upholding natural law, establishing justice, and ensuring liberty. He started by examining three \"good states\" and their perverted forms, described earlier by the Greek historian Polybius.\n\nCicero believed the best of the good states was a monarchy, but the king could turn into a tyrant. Cicero also approved of an aristocracy, rule by the best men, but it was vulnerable to conspiracies by factions intent on grabbing power (an oligarchy). In Cicero's view, the worst of the good states was a democracy, where all the people participated directly in running the government. It eventually led to mob rule.\n\nCicero went a step further than Polybius to describe a cycle of government forms. \"The government is thus bandied about like a ball,\" Cicero wrote, \"tyrants receive it from kings; from tyrants it passes either to aristocrats or to the people; and from the people to oligarchs or tyrants.\" Therefore, he concluded that all three good states were flawed and unstable.\n\nEven so, Cicero recognized each good state had its merits. A king could act quickly and decisively in an emergency. The people in a democracy enjoyed liberty with equal rights. The aristocrats possessed experience and wisdom.\n\nCicero proposed that the ideal government \"is formed by an equal balancing and blending\" of monarchy, democracy, and aristocracy. In this \"mixed state,\" he argued, royalty, the best men, and the common people all should have a role.\n\nUnlike many of the political philosophers before him, Cicero was an experienced politician and had a working model for his \"mixed state.\" This was the Roman Republic, with its consuls (co-kings), Senate (aristocrats), and democratic assemblies (commoners).\n\nTo achieve his ideal government, Cicero argued that Romans only had to restore the republic to its previous perfect form. He proposed strengthening the aristocratic consuls and Senate at the expense of the democratic assemblies. But Cicero's reforms did little to address the mounting forces endangering the existence of the republic.\n\nThe Fall of the Republic\n\nThe greatest threat facing the Roman Republic was ambitious military men, especially the Triumvirate. When Crassus died in a disastrous war in the eastern empire, Pompey and Caesar each plotted to become master of Rome, and civil war erupted.\n\nIn 49, Caesar led his legions into Italy from Gaul to confront Pompey. Fearing Caesar, the Senate made Pompey sole consul. Pompey, however, fled to Greece followed by Caesar and his close ally, Mark Antony. Cicero, who at first wanted to be a neutral mediator between the two generals, finally decided to join Pompey since he had the backing of the Senate.\n\nIn 48, Caesar destroyed Pompey's legions in battle. Pompey sought refuge from the Egyptians, but they executed him, thinking it would please Caesar.\n\nThe frightened Senate made Caesar dictator, but many feared he wanted to become king, which would end the republic. Cicero reconciled with Caesar, but was depressed about the fate of the republic. He turned to writing works on philosophy influenced by the Stoics and other Greek thinkers.\n\nOn March 15, 44 B.C., a conspiracy of up to 60 senators led by Cassius and Brutus stabbed Caesar to death in the Senate. Cicero was not a conspirator, but he witnessed the assassination. Afterward, Brutus congratulated Cicero for once again having a free Republic. Cicero believed the murder of Caesar had saved the Republic.\n\nCaesar's friend Mark Antony, who was a consul, began to take charge and turned public opinion against the conspirators, forcing Cassius and Brutus to flee Italy. Soon, it became clear that Antony was using Caesar's name to take control of Rome.\n\nAt age 60, Cicero again took center stage in the Senate and launched a series of more than a dozen speeches against Antony, calling for the Senate to declare war on him. \"I defended the republic as a young man,\" he exclaimed, \"I shall not desert her now that I am old.\"\n\nCaesar's adopted 19-year-old son and heir, Octavian, was recruiting an army and offered to side with Cicero and the Senate against Antony. Cicero leaped at this chance to save the republic once again. He thought he could use the teenager and then dismiss him. Cicero remarked to a friend, \"The young man should be praised, honored, and then gotten rid of.\"\n\nBut Octavian ended up using Cicero and the Senate to maneuver his way into an alliance with Antony and another general, creating the Second Triumvirate. They agreed to divide the western empire among themselves and placed hundreds of senators and other nobles on an execution list. Antony insisted that Cicero be included.\n\nIn November 43, Cicero retreated to his seaside villa, intending to sail to Greece. A band of armed men sent by Antony caught up with him and slit his throat. Antony ordered Cicero's head and hands nailed to the speaker's rostrum in the Forum.\n\nOctavian eventually defeated Cassius, Brutus, and Antony in battle. Taking the title Emperor Caesar Augustus, he ruled as a king. The Roman Republic was dead.\n\nAugustus banned Cicero's works. One day, according to the Roman biographer Plutarch, Augustus caught his grandson reading one of Cicero's books. Augustus took the book from the boy and read from it for a long time. He then said, \"My dear child, this was an eloquent man, and a patriot.\"\n\nFor Discussion and Writing\n\n1. What do you think was Cicero's greatest achievement? Why?\n\n2.

When Octavian and Antony reconciled, a centurion murdered Cicero on Antony\u2019s order. Cicero\u2019s head and hands were nailed to the rostra in the Roman Forum.\n\nIn his youth, Marcus Tullius Cicero was instructed by the famed rhetorician Molon of Rhodes. Molon did not stick to any one style, instead drifting between florid and concise language. Cicero perfected this methodology, relying on cadence, emotion, and the energy of his audience and interweaving references to literature, philosophy, and history.\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero resented the political machinations of Julius Caesar , Pompey , and Marcus Licinius Crassus and initially refused to ally himself with them, even attempting to isolate Pompey from Caesar. However, he later committed himself publicly\u2014if not personally\u2014to their advancement before diminishing his political involvement during the civil war between Caesar and Pompey.\n\nIn 63 BCE Marcus Tullius Cicero gave an impassioned oration to his fellow senators that charged Catiline with plotting to stage a violent coup. This so moved the Senate that they voted to implement martial law and execute the conspirators. Cicero was named pater patriae\u2014\u201cfather of the country\u201d\u2014for his service to the republic.\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero was a masterful orator known for his ability to evoke a wide range of emotions in plebeians and patricians alike. Cicero\u2019s political career saw him as quaestor , praetor , consul , and proconsul , providing him with several opportunities to influence the trajectory of Rome and the Senate in the waning days of the republic.\n\nCicero , in full Marcus Tullius Cicero , (born 106 bce, Arpinum, Latium [now Arpino, Italy]\u2014died December 7, 43 bce, Formiae , Latium [now Formia]), Roman statesman, lawyer, scholar, and writer who vainly tried to uphold republican principles in the final civil wars that destroyed the Roman Republic . His writings include books of rhetoric , orations, philosophical and political treatises , and letters. He is remembered in modern times as the greatest Roman orator and the innovator of what became known as Ciceronian rhetoric.\n\nIn the first of his consular speeches, he opposed the agrarian bill of Servilius Rullus, in the interest of the absent Pompey; but his chief concern was to discover and make public the seditious intentions of Catiline, who, defeated in 64, appeared again at the consular elections in 63 (over which Cicero presided, wearing armour beneath his toga). Catiline lost and planned to carry out armed uprisings in Italy and arson in Rome. Cicero had difficulty in persuading the Senate of the danger, but the \u201clast decree\u201d (Senatus consultum ultimum), something like a proclamation of martial law , was passed on October 22. On November 8, after escaping an attempt on his life, Cicero delivered the first speech against Catiline in the Senate, and Catiline left Rome that night. Evidence incriminating the conspirators was secured and, after a senatorial debate in which Cato the Younger spoke for execution and Julius Caesar against, they were executed on Cicero\u2019s responsibility. Cicero, announcing their death to the crowd with the single word vixerunt (\u201cthey are dead\u201d), received a tremendous ovation from all classes, which inspired his subsequent appeal in politics to concordia ordinum, \u201cconcord between the classes.\u201d He was hailed by Catulus as \u201cfather of his country.\u201d This was the climax of his career.\n\nCicero was the son of a wealthy family of Arpinum . Admirably educated in Rome and in Greece , he did military service in 89 under Pompeius Strabo (the father of the statesman and general Pompey ) and made his first appearance in the courts defending Publius Quinctius in 81. His brilliant defense, in 80 or early 79, of Sextus Roscius against a fabricated charge of parricide established his reputation at the bar, and he started his public career as quaestor (an office of financial administration) in western Sicily in 75.\n\nAlliance with the First Triumvirate\n\nAt the end of 60, Cicero declined Caesar\u2019s invitation to join the political alliance of Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey, the so-called First Triumvirate, which he considered unconstitutional, and also Caesar\u2019s offer in 59 of a place on his staff in Gaul. When Publius Clodius, whom Cicero had antagonized by speaking and giving evidence against him when he was tried for profanity early in 61, became tribune in 58, Cicero was in danger, and in March, disappointed by Pompey\u2019s refusal to help him, he fled Rome. On the following day Clodius carried a bill forbidding the execution of a Roman citizen without trial. Clodius then carried through a second law, of doubtful legality, declaring Cicero an exile. Cicero went first to Thessalonica, in Macedonia, and then to Illyricum. In 57, thanks to the activity of Pompey and particularly the tribune Titus Annius Milo, he was recalled on August 4. Cicero landed at Brundisium (Brindisi) on that day and was acclaimed all along his route to Rome, where he arrived a month later.\n\nIn winter 57\u201356 Cicero attempted unsuccessfully to estrange Pompey from Caesar. Pompey disregarded Cicero\u2019s advice and renewed his compact with Caesar and Crassus at Luca in April 56. Cicero then agreed, under pressure from Pompey, to align himself with the three in politics, and he committed himself in writing to this effect (the \u201cpalinode\u201d). The speech De provinciis consularibus (On the Consular Provinces) marked his new alliance. He was obliged to accept a number of distasteful defenses, and he abandoned public life. In the next few years he completed the De oratore (55; On the Orator) and De republica (52; On the Republic) and began the De legibus (52; On Laws). In 52 he was delighted when Milo killed Clodius but failed disastrously in his defense of Milo (later written for publication, the Pro Milone, or For Milo).\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The province had been expecting a Parthian invasion, but it never materialized, although Cicero did suppress some brigands on Mt. Amanus. The Senate granted a supplicatio (a period of public thanksgiving), although Cicero had hoped for a triumph, a processional return through the city, on his return to Rome. All admitted that he governed Cilicia with integrity.\n\nBy the time Cicero returned to Rome, Pompey and Caesar were struggling against each other for complete power. He was on the outskirts of Rome when Caesar crossed the Rubicon and invaded Italy in January 49. Cicero met Pompey outside Rome on January 17 and accepted a commission to supervise recruiting in Campania. He did not leave Italy with Pompey on March 17, however. His indecision was not discreditable, though his criticism of Pompey\u2019s strategy was inexpert. In an interview with Caesar on March 28, Cicero showed great courage in stating his own terms\u2014his intention of proposing in the Senate that Caesar should not pursue the war against Pompey any further\u2014though they were terms that Caesar could not possibly accept. Cicero disapproved of Caesar\u2019s dictatorship; yet he realized that in the succession of battles (which continued until 45) he would have been one of the first victims of Caesar\u2019s enemies, had they triumphed. This was his second period of intensive literary production, works of this period including the Brutus, Paradoxa Stoicorum (Paradoxes of the Stoics), and Orator (The Orator) in 46; De finibus (On the Supreme Good) in 45; and Tusculanae disputationes (Tusculan Disputations), De natura deorum (On the Nature of the Gods), and De officiis (On Duties), finished after Caesar\u2019s murder, in 44."}, {"url": "https://abovethelaw.com/2014/05/cicero-on-being-more-than-just-a-lawyer/", "page_content": "It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day life of a lawyer. And the longer you are a lawyer, the more it will come to define you \u2013 if you let it. But it is a limiting definition, even for the best and brightest of lawyers. Take Marcus Tullius Cicero, likely the most famous lawyer in history. Upon being acclaimed for his skills as a lawyer, it is said that Cicero remarked:\n\n\u201cAnd yet he often desired his friends not to call him orator, but philosopher, because he had made philosophy his business, and had only used rhetoric as an instrument for attaining his objects in public life. But the desire of glory has great power in washing the tinctures of philosophy out of the souls of men, and in imprinting the passions of the common people, by custom and conversation, in the minds of those that take a part in governing them, unless the politician be very careful so to engage in public affairs as to interest himself only in the affairs themselves, but not participate in the passions that are consequent to them.\u201d\n\nSponsored The Essential Guide to Slack eDiscovery Someday, you will likely need to extract data from Slack for eDiscovery, compliance, or other purposes.

Being a lawyer was part of who he was; it did not define him\u2026.\n\nToday\u2019s lawyers increasingly pigeonhole themselves into the trap that Cicero spoke of. Being a lawyer can be a time-consuming process with long hours and dark work that eat into one\u2019s personal life. Eventually it can seem as though being a lawyer is the central defining characteristic of an individual. This is further exacerbated by the monetary rewards, public respect, and admiration from one\u2019s colleagues that lawyers can develop over several years of successful practice.

There is more to life than the practice of law. And a lawyer hoping to have a rich life should keep Cicero\u2019s desires on how he wished to be defined in mind.

Jobs will surely come up in conversations with new people, but then let it go. Focus on the task at hand and the people you are with. And turn off (or at least ignore) your damn phone as best you can.

Her nieces and nephews barely looked up from their gadgets when she entered a room. Another new acquaintance agreed, and described how Google had blocked off avenues of conversation with her boyfriend. \u201cBefore we would argue about this or that, but now we just look it up on Wikipedia,\u201d she said.\n\nModern internet communication technology has enabled us to to live in a hyper-connected society \u2013 but it\u2019s worthless if we can\u2019t connect with those immediately around us. The knee-jerk reaction is to blame technology \u2013 \u201cOh it\u2019s those blasted iPhones and the Googles!!\u201d But technology is just a tool.\n\nHaving an iPhone on hand doen\u2019t automatically turn you into a introverted prick.

It\u2019s a chance to interact, share, and grow from those around you. It\u2019s an opportunity to learn. There is little in life as satisfying as a stimulating conversation among friends. Again, Cicero:\n\nTo begin with, how can life be worth living, to use the words of Ennius, which lacks that repose which is to be found in the mutual good will of a friend? What can be more delightful than to have some one to whom you can say everything with the same absolute confidence as to yourself? Is not prosperity robbed of half its value if you have no one to share your joy? \u2014 Laelius de Amicitia\n\nIf your phone is such a problem, turn it off! Leave it at the house.

We used technology to reach out, connect, and have a conversation with a friend thousands of miles away from us because he couldn\u2019t be there that day. Our day was better because we could share it with our friend \u2014 but not to the point that we ignored one another.\n\nPeople don\u2019t need a class on conversation.

In his political speeches especially and in his correspondence we see the excitement, tension and intrigue of politics and the part he played in the turmoil of the time.

The focus will be on providing a sense of the distinctiveness of his philosophical approach, with particular attention paid to how his philosophical allegiance and method of composition contribute to forming a conception of philosophy that remains worthy of notice.\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero (106\u201343 BCE) is best known to posterity as a prominent statesman and orator in the tumultuous period of the late Roman republic. As well as being a leading political actor of his time, he also wrote voluminously. Among his writings, around a dozen philosophical works have come down to us. Philosophy was a lifelong passion for Cicero. In addition to what one might call his strictly philosophical compositions, much else of what he wrote \u2013 including his speeches, works on rhetoric, and a large collection of letters \u2013 show evidence of his philosophical interests. In terms of modern scholarship, the value of Cicero\u2019s philosophical work was held, until relatively recently, to lie chiefly in the information it provided about the thought of the leading philosophical schools of his day: Stoicism, Epicureanism and Academic scepticism among them. However, in part because of the creative way in which he engages with his predecessors, he is increasingly studied today as a philosophical thinker of independent interest.\n\n1. Cicero\u2019s Life and Times\n\nThere are a number of good studies of Cicero\u2019s life (e.g. Fuhrmann 1992, Rawson 1994, Tempest 2011); some background knowledge is salient to an understanding of his philosophical outlook. As already mentioned, Cicero lived through a turbulent historical period. Under the strains of empire, the Roman republican system of government had fractured, and was eventually to prove unsustainable. Cicero was both witness to and participant in some of the events that hastened the collapse of republican government and that ushered in, within fifteen years or so of his death, the rule of Augustus, first of the Roman emperors.\n\nCicero rose to the highest political office in the republic \u2013 the consulship \u2013 in 63 BCE. His period as consul was both the high-water mark of his political career and a fateful turning-point. While consul, he put down the conspiracy against the republic led by Catiline. But his actions led to his being exiled in 58; and, while he was restored to Rome the following year through the influence of Pompey, he could do little other than contemplate with horror the deterioration of relations between Caesar and Pompey that led to civil war and the ascendancy of Caesar to the dictatorship. Caesar\u2019s assassination in 44 brought only brief respite. Cicero himself was put to death on Mark Antony\u2019s orders in 43.\n\n2. Philosophy and Roman Society\n\nAs a staunch republican himself, Cicero frequently despaired of the state of the republic. Writing philosophy provided both consolation and a resource that, at least in more hopeful moments, he believed could help ameliorate the political crisis. One of the things that makes Cicero an interesting philosophical figure is his conviction that philosophy has the potential to change lives and make societies better. This belief in philosophy\u2019s practical purpose explains why much, though by no means all, of Cicero\u2019s philosophical production has a broadly ethical or political orientation.\n\nThe social and political backdrop is important in another way too. One of Cicero\u2019s purposes in writing philosophy is to bring the best of the Greek philosophical inheritance to wider Roman attention. That does not, however, mean that his works are simple philosophical manuals to be absorbed uncritically by their readership. A striking feature of Cicero\u2019s philosophical output is that it takes seriously and critically the question of the relation between abstract ideas, on the one hand, and the culture and tradition of particular societies (most saliently, for him, Rome), on the other.\n\nIndeed, Cicero treats this relation as bringing with it a set of distinctly philosophical questions about, for example, the normative weight to be assigned to the deliverances of rational theology as against traditional religious practice (see section 7.3 below), or to the precepts of an abstract ethical theory as against the theory\u2019s liveability in a concrete society (section 7.2 below). His discussions of the leading philosophical theories of his day tend to be used not for the purpose of firm advocacy of one particular set of doctrines or another, but to give his readers the tools to think through positions for themselves. Cicero\u2019s project of disseminating philosophy has the aim of inducing what he saw as the properly philosophical approach, one that is critical and open-minded.\n\n3. Dialogue and the Sceptical Stance\n\nHis philosophical compositions bear out this approach in two important and connected ways. Firstly, they are by and large written in dialogue form (see Gorman 2005, Schofield 2008). His adoption of the form in part reflects his admiration for Plato, whom he considered the greatest of all philosophers. Now Cicero\u2019s relation to Plato is a complex one (see Long 1995b, H\u00f6sle 2008, Bishop 2019 ch. 2), and his use of the dialogue form differed from Plato\u2019s, manifesting itself principally in opposed set speeches rather than rapid back-and-forth exchanges, though the latter are not completely absent from Cicero\u2019s work (and long speeches are common enough in Plato). We find Cicero also invoking the (now lost) dialogues of Aristotle and of the early Platonist philosopher Heraclides of Pontus as influences on him. Still, his favouring of dialogue over straight treatise shares the Platonic motive of engaging readers in active philosophical enquiry.\n\nThe majority of Cicero\u2019s philosophical writings feature a speaker or series of speakers setting out the views held on a core topic (for example, the nature of the gods, or the best way to live) by various philosophical schools, with a critique of those views mounted after each exposition, often by Cicero himself. Thus, in terms of their structure, his works lend themselves not to decisive acceptance or rejection of a particular view, but to a setting out of all sides of an argument so readers can make their own assessment.\n\nThis feature reflects, in turn, Cicero\u2019s allegiance to Academic scepticism. Now the extent and nature of this allegiance is a matter of debate (see Glucker 1988, G\u00f6rler 1995, Thorsrud 2012, Brittain 2016, Wynne 2018) but what matters for present purposes is that the sceptical stance takes it as a mistake to believe that certainty is possible. The most one can do is form a judgement that some particular position is more or less plausible than another, such a judgement itself being revisable in the light of further evidence or argument.\n\nThe truly philosophical approach is thus one that refuses to take any philosophical view as settled \u2013 including this very one (see section 7.1 below). Cicero thereby sets himself against the approach of the contemporary \u2018dogmatic\u2019 schools \u2013 in particular, Epicureanism and Stoicism \u2013 where dogmatism refers not to positions that are unargued for, but to doctrines regarded by their advocates as settled truth. Cicero\u2019s stance is not one that pits itself primarily against specific doctrines of these schools \u2013 the sceptic is entitled to adopt any view as plausible. Rather, what he opposes is a conception of intellectual endeavour as capable of arriving at certainty. The best philosophy is one that fosters critical enquiry; and the nature and role of philosophy must, by the same token, itself be in the critical spotlight.\n\n4. Philosophy and Oratory\n\nCicero\u2019s main philosophical production can be divided into two chronological periods. The first, from around 54\u201351 BCE, sees the writing of his two main works of political philosophy, the Republic and the Laws (the latter apparently unfinished), each loosely based on a Platonic archetype, together with his great work on the nature and role of oratory, On the Orator. The second period, during which he composed the greater part of his philosophical oeuvre, occurred in an astonishing two-year burst of creativity towards the end of his life, in 45 and 44. Although Cicero\u2019s writings on oratory (he composed several works on the topic) will not be discussed here, they should not be regarded as entirely distinct from his philosophical writings. That is because the relation between philosophy and oratory was of central importance to him. While this might sound arcane to a modern ear, what it encapsulated for Cicero was the vital question of how philosophy is best communicated.\n\nIn the Gorgias, Plato had Socrates mount a passionate attack on rhetoric, by contrast with philosophy, as concerned with mere persuasion rather than truth. For Cicero, as probably the supreme orator of his day, matters could not be that simple. The use of speech to manipulate others for self-serving ends could not, of course, be condoned. But the idea that pure reasoning, divorced from communicative skill, was sufficient to win people round to philosophy struck Cicero as, if anything, even more dangerously misguided. The resources of oratory must be recruited to the vital enterprise of disseminating philosophy to new audiences. Cicero often shows himself acutely conscious of criticism that a practical Roman should so much as attempt to write philosophy. By writing it in a way that was not alienating to its potential audience, he could aspire to draw his critics in despite themselves.\n\n5. The First Period: Philosophical Politics\n\n5.1 The Republic and Laws\n\nIt is perhaps no accident that Cicero\u2019s first two major philosophical works should be in political philosophy, given both the crisis faced by the republican system of government and the need to produce work in a field that would be regarded as suitable for a Roman statesman. But the Republic and Laws (in Latin De Re Publica and De Legibus respectively) are in at least one respect radical nonetheless: together with On the Orator, they introduce the dialogue form into Latin literature. And notwithstanding the influence of Plato, the two works can lay claim to being among the most original parts of Cicero\u2019s philosophy, since each deals to a substantial extent with the government and institutions of a state of which Plato could have had no inkling, namely Rome.\n\nBoth works are intensely Roman. The Republic takes as the best kind of state one that, to a large extent, consists in the traditional structures of the Roman republic. The Laws considers the sort of laws that will best maintain or restore those structures. To this extent, they challenge the idea, one that Cicero saw reflected in the utopianism of Plato\u2019s Republic, that political philosophy should proceed in isolation from consideration of actual political structures and societies. Yet, in ways that make their overall message far from straightforward, both are deeply influenced by abstract theory as well, and by questions of how theory, history and practical politics interact.\n\n5.2 The Republic\n\nIn the Republic, a work which unfortunately has not come down to us complete (none of its six books survive whole, with large portions missing especially from the last four), Cicero stakes out his position early with an attack on philosophers who argue that one should refrain from public affairs \u2013 he means principally Epicureans. The Stoics, in offering a more activist model, present the alternative view. The Stoic philosopher Panaetius, together with the Greek historian Polybius, is named in the main body of the dialogue as having discussed political matters with one of the work\u2019s principal speakers, Scipio (1.34); and the influence of Stoic political thinking is evident in the idea that humans share with gods dominion not just of the place in which they happen to live, but of the Earth and indeed the whole universe (1.19). Yet this cosmopolitan outlook in turn creates tension with the idea, also prominent in the dialogue, of the specialness of Rome, and raises the question of whether Roman exceptionalism can sit comfortably with a view of human beings as citizens of the world.\n\nIt is noteworthy that, even before embarking on a discussion of the nature of the state, Cicero is explicit in his preface (1.12) about the need to justify participation in public affairs, a stance that underlines his view that theories of good government are all very well but may be idle unless one makes the case that engaging in the public arena is the right thing to do. Yet, having commended the participant over the theoretician, Cicero goes on to say that he will now appeal to those who are moved by the authority of philosophers, and declares that in their discussions of government such philosophers have themselves discharged a public office.\n\nThe debate about the role of philosophy is reflected within the main body of the dialogue as well, and here it becomes if anything clearer that Cicero\u2019s purpose is not to play down philosophy but to play up the practically oriented way of doing political philosophy that he considers appropriate to the subject. At the same time, this enables him to present his writing on the topic as genuine progress over his Greek predecessors. It may, then, come as a surprise to find, in a work of supposedly practical orientation, that prior to Scipio\u2019s main exposition in Book 1 of the different types of political constitution, Cicero depicts a rather lengthy discussion of a cosmological event: the recent apparent sighting of a \u2018second sun\u2019 in the sky (1.15).\n\nScipio, even though he will take the lead role in the discussion of political theory, fulsomely praises the more abstract kinds of study directed at the celestial realm (1.26\u201328); but he is persuaded by Laelius, another participant, that it is of greater importance now to address terrestrial issues, particularly regarding the best form of government (1.30\u201334). The debate that Cicero lays out about the investigation of the human versus the divine realm makes the case for the study of both as having value, and intriguingly leaves open the question of the relation between the two: Scipio speaks of how the Earth pales into insignificance beside the heavens, and asserts that there is a universal natural law that has authority over any civil law, so that what has ultimate moral weight is the decree of the wise person who understands the natural law, rather than that of the Roman people (1.27). Similar principles are laid down at 3.33, anticipating the fuller discussion in the Laws. These are pronouncements with a strongly Stoic flavour; and when another participant, Philus, speaks of the Stoic notion that gods and humans share the whole universe as their homeland, he suggests that for that reason cosmology might be relevant to politics in any case (1.19).\n\nBy the time that we turn to Scipio\u2019s exposition of the various forms of government, it can be seen that Cicero has used the flexibility of the dramatic dialogue to prime his reader to examine the topic with a critical eye. Scipio\u2019s focus on Rome is a response to the lack of practical awareness that he (or his author) sees infecting Greek models. But if Stoic universalism is correct, such focus on a particular concrete system seems itself to be headed in the wrong direction. And if cosmology is more important than politics, yet too important for politics to ignore, then an exposition that sticks to the human realm \u2013 as Scipio\u2019s, as far as we can tell, largely does \u2013 is missing something. Cicero thus invites us, in the midst of a work on political theory, to consider how small the human (and within that the Roman) domain is, a thought reinforced in some complex ways in the dialogue\u2019s concluding Dream of Scipio, perhaps the most famous excerpt in all of Cicero\u2019s philosophy (its survival owed to its coming down to us as part of a separate manuscript tradition). In thus giving the work as a whole structural integrity (despite its, for us, truncated condition), Cicero\u2019s framing challenges the reader to maintain a critical perspective on the doing of political philosophy itself.\n\n5.3 The Laws\n\nIn Republic 5, Scipio had affirmed that the political leader requires knowledge of justice and of the laws and will have studied their foundations. The discussion of natural law in Laws 1 offers an account of those foundations. The purpose of such an account is to set the parameters within which more concrete laws must fall and be judged. The natural law is god\u2019s law; it is also what human beings who have perfected their reason would follow. Law is to be identified with right reason (1.23), or more specifically with right reason in the realm of what is commanded or forbidden (1.33, 1.42). This, then, is a normative account: it tells us what law, properly speaking, is; and that may be very different from the actual laws that particular states have enacted.\n\nGiven the normative character of Cicero\u2019s enquiry, it is not difficult to see why law should be identified with right reason. Rationality, after all, is itself a normative concept. Not every piece of thinking counts as rational, and rationality can be exercised imperfectly and so, at least in principle, perfectly. If one reasons correctly about the relevant matters in the case of what is just and unjust, then it seems fair to conclude that one will enunciate standards against which, for example, actual laws will be required to measure up. Law in the normative sense is \u2018what distinguishes just things from unjust\u2019 (2.13).\n\nIt is not as obvious why the concept of nature, or the natural, looms large in Cicero\u2019s account of law. One of its main purposes is, again, to stress that he is conducting a normative enquiry. We are, he says, \u2018born for justice\u2019, and what is right is a matter not of opinion but of nature (1.28). Here Cicero draws upon a tradition, already going back at least as far as Plato, in which nature stands in contrast with convention. What is merely a matter of convention or opinion is not the same as what is really \u2013 \u2018by nature\u2019 \u2013 the case. Thus the fact that a certain (human-made) law states that something is right or wrong does not mean that its pronouncements are correct.\n\nWhat is this nature that is thus contrasted with matters of opinion or convention? It is, in the first instance, human nature, as witnessed by Cicero\u2019s statement that \u2018we\u2019 are born for justice. We all belong to the same species, and to that extent are all alike (1.29), in particular in our possession of reason, which distinguishes us from other creatures (1.30). This explains the sense of mutual fellowship and union between human beings (1.28) and means that we are formed by nature to share justice and impart it to all (1.33). This does not mean that we necessarily do this. Nature is itself a normative concept, so humans can fail to live up to their own nature, corrupted by the effects of bad habit and opinion (1.29, 1.33). Nonetheless, Cicero argues, if one considers the endowments that humans share, one will conclude that justice is the natural human condition.\n\nBut nature also refers, compatibly, to the nature of the universe as a whole, since on the Stoic theory that Cicero draws upon (a theory set out more fully in Book 2 of Cicero\u2019s On the Nature of the Gods, see esp. 2.73\u201390), the universe \u2013 \u2018all of nature\u2019, as Cicero puts it \u2013 is governed by god (1.21). God in turn exercises governing power through the activity of right reason, which we humans, at least in our best condition, share with god (1.23). Reason is thus natural, in that it underlies the workings of the universe; and since we possess it too, as the divine element in us, in expressing our human nature it expresses our kinship with the gods as well. Hence Cicero can refer in Book 2 of the Laws to the \u2018true and original law\u2019 as identified with the right reason of god (2.10).\n\nCicero\u2019s thinking seems to be that to regard laws as no more than human artefacts \u2013 that is, as not based in nature \u2013 is to concede that reward and punishment are the only motivations for obedience. But then it will be the rewards and punishments, not the justice or injustice of the act in question, that will have normative force. But if that is so, then if one calculates correctly that, say, greater utility will arise from breaking than obeying a law, it seems that one has no reason to obey it. What is needed, rather, is a conception of justice as something to be sought, as Cicero puts it, \u2018for its own sake\u2019 (1.48). That is, we must think of what is just as having an inherent normative force, to be pursued because it is just. And that means, for Cicero, that justice must be based in nature and not simply a matter of human convention.\n\nWhether or not we find this stance convincing, there is a specific theory of justice that Cicero appears to have in mind as the object of his critique: the Epicurean theory. Epicurus regarded justice as precisely a matter of social agreements concluded with the aim of maximizing utility. One should further note that Cicero\u2019s friend Atticus is, along with Cicero\u2019s brother Quintus, one of Cicero\u2019s two main interlocutors in the dialogue, and that Atticus is an adherent of Epicureanism. His presence seems to emphasize that there is an alternative point of view that is not being given the opportunity to defend itself. Strikingly, Cicero does not even say that he thinks the Epicurean theory is wrong; rather, he bids the Epicureans abstain from all matters of government, which they neither know about nor have wished to know about (1.39). It is true that the Epicureans, unlike the Stoics, generally maintained a quietist outlook and believed that by and large one should not be politically active. But they did have a specific theory of justice. So Cicero seems a little high-handed in excluding them from a conversation featuring that as one of its principal topics.\n\nEpicureans are not the only ones whose views Cicero seems intent on marginalizing in this context. Remarkably, he asks the adherents of the New (that is, sceptical) Academy to \u2018be silent\u2019, since their habit of attacking any doctrinal view will cause \u2018confusion\u2019 and result in the ruin of Cicero\u2019s \u2018elegantly arranged edifice\u2019 (1.39). We have indeed just been reminded that Cicero himself is a follower of the sceptical Academy, with Atticus\u2019 ironical comment that Cicero is of course someone who does not follow his own judgement in debate but the authority of others (1.36). Cicero replies that he indeed does not always accept the authority of others but that he is here trying to establish a foundation for states and cities (1.37).\n\nShould we take Cicero at face value here? Although one can understand that having to deal with opposing views may make it more difficult to establish the kind of basis for systems of law and justice that he has in mind, that could surely apply to any philosophical thesis and any sort of opposition. One might even suppose that attacking an edifice, however elegantly constructed, might lead to a stronger edifice being built. Cicero in fact says that he would like to appease the sceptics and does not dare drive them off (1.39). So why does Cicero attempt just here to stifle debate? Why, in particular, does he draw attention to the fact that that is what he is doing? He need not have mentioned the sceptics, nor for that matter the Epicureans. He need not have chosen Atticus as a participant whom he could then ask not to dispute his basic premise.\n\nCicero clearly expects his readers to notice these moves. One might say that to announce loudly that one is closing down debate is itself to initiate a debate. Cicero thus uses the notion of uniformity of outlook both to illustrate and critique a crucial feature of the theory he is advocating. The idea of natural law is precisely the idea that there is a universal set of normative principles of equal applicability in all contexts. If that idea is correct, then there is no room for divergence of opinion about what justice is. At the same time, Cicero\u2019s dismissal of the Epicurean and sceptical viewpoints reminds us that, in the real world as opposed to the ideal one of perfected reason, there are competing and critical opinions, and that the universalist theory is itself a product of a particular philosophical school (Stoicism).\n\nOn the one hand, then, we have a vision of uniformity, representing a kind of ideal endpoint in which all is organized and measured in accordance with the same basic principles. On the other, we have concrete and divergent voices that embody a range of perspectives and show where we are now and perhaps \u2013 though the voices may change \u2013 where we will be at any specific historical moment: at some distance from an undisputed endpoint. In the very process of apparent suppression of dissent, Cicero uses the resources of the dialogue form to draw readers into critical participation in his enquiry.\n\n6. The Second Period: An Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n\nCicero\u2019s second, and most intense, period of philosophical production occurs during the last few years of his life, a period that saw the dictatorship and then assassination of Julius Caesar. The latter event caused Cicero\u2019s political stock to rise briefly but, in the end, brought only futile hope of the restoration of republican government. The political situation, combined with personal tragedy \u2013 the death of his daughter Tullia in childbirth \u2013 resulted in a remarkable bout of creativity during which Cicero produced substantial works on a wide range of philosophical themes. His ambition, as he puts it in his preface to On the Nature of the Gods (1.7), was to compose nothing less than a comprehensive treatment covering \u2018the whole of philosophy\u2019 \u2013 a veritable encyclopedia of the subject.\n\nFor the purposes of this entry, a more selective approach is adopted. Three late dialogues will be highlighted below, but the late period also saw the composition of two works likely to be relatively familiar to non-specialists: On Duties (De Officiis), concerning practical conduct, and Tusculan Disputations, on the theory of the emotions, together with a trio of works on mainly Stoic themes: On Fate (De Fato), On Divination (De Divinatione) and Stoic Paradoxes (Paradoxa Stoicorum), as well as a pair on specific issues in ethics: On Old Age (De Senectute) and On Friendship (De Amicitia). In what follows, further works from the period on each of three central topics \u2013 epistemology, ethical theory and theology \u2013 are discussed, in order to offer a representative illustration of the distinctiveness of Cicero\u2019s approach as an Academic sceptic and writer of philosophical dialogues.\n\n6.1 Epistemology\n\nAlthough it has come down to us in a rather misshapen state, containing portions of two quite different editions of the work, On Academic Scepticism (in Latin Academica) cannot be passed over, since it presents an account of the epistemological viewpoint of the sceptical Academy and so in effect serves as a defence of the method that Cicero employs in much of his philosophical writing. At the same time, Cicero does not present a one-sided picture. In the segment sometimes known (after its leading character) as the Lucullus, critique of the New, or sceptical, Academy is mounted, with Cicero responding on behalf of the sceptic.\n\nAgainst a position that denies that certainty is attainable, Lucullus argues that intellectual enquiry, which aims at proof, will be hamstrung, since proof requires certainty (2.26). Moreover, the sceptic\u2019s refusal to allow that there can be \u2018cataleptic\u2019 impressions \u2013 the Stoic technical term for impressions that can be grasped with certainty \u2013 will subject the sceptic to the charge of inconsistency (cf. 2.44): the sceptic holds that nothing can be grasped with certainty, but surely the claim that \u2018nothing can be grasped with certainty\u2019 must itself be graspable with certainty, or else the sceptic position lacks firm foundation.\n\nIf the sceptics have their own counterpart of a criterion of truth, in terms of the notion of plausibility, they must surely regard that notion as beyond dispute if it is to play its allotted role (2.29). Given the importance of correctly identifying the proper basis for one\u2019s decisions and actions, it cannot for the sceptic be merely plausible, but must be certain, that plausibility is the right criterion. Sceptics are thus impaled on a dilemma: their system undermines itself by being either inconsistent (if \u2018nothing can be grasped\u2019 is graspable) or ineffectual (if it is not graspable).\n\nLucullus continues to take aim at the notion of plausibility that features as the sceptics\u2019 criterion for determining what we accept and do (2.32); but he approaches it in a way that might seem to beg the question, asking how the sceptic can maintain a criterion of truth and falsehood if truth and falsehood are indistinguishable (2.33). It seems as if the sceptic could reply that they do not in fact have such a criterion. They do not, unlike their dogmatic opponents, claim to pronounce one thing true, another false. What they can do \u2013 what, if they are right, is the most one can do \u2013 is identify one thing as plausible, another as implausible.\n\nLucullus has an interesting riposte to this, which involves questioning the intelligibility of being able to determine what is plausible and what is not without a criterion for determining what is true and what is not. He points out that in rejecting the cataleptic impression, the sceptic does not allow that there are impressions distinctively marked out as truth-bearing. But if so, it follows that there is no difference between true and false, in the sense that there is nothing about a given impression that will mark it out as true rather than false. So, says Lucullus, \u2018there will be no criterion\u2019 (2.34). In other words, without a means of determining which is true, no impression will be more deserving of credence than any other.\n\nMoreover, the notion of plausibility is, logically, tied to the notion of truth: what is plausible is what \u2018resembles truth\u2019, in Latin veri simile, the phrase Cicero uses as an alternative for probabile to represent the concept of plausibility. If something is plausible, then it is likely (though not certain) to be true. But the sceptics by their own admission have no criterion for determining what is true. Hence, they have no way of judging something as likely to be true, since that presupposes a standard of truth against which the purported plausibility would be judged.\n\nCicero responds by sketching a distinction, made by the sceptical philosopher Clitomachus, of two ways in which one might withhold assent: by refraining (a) from \u2018completely\u2019 assenting to anything, and (b) from approving or disapproving. The wise sceptic will never completely assent to any impression but will \u2018approve\u2019 those that are plausible and \u2018disapprove\u2019 those that are not. One will then be able to act on the basis of those impressions one approves, without having entirely assented to them (2.104).\n\nThe distinction has an air of sophistry about it, but it corresponds reasonably well to the way we actually make decisions. Take a simple case of my deciding whether to drink the tap water in my glass. It looks and smells healthy, there seems nothing to suggest otherwise. Nonetheless it might always be the case that it is unhealthy. I \u2018approve\u2019 the impression that it is healthy and drink the water, while accepting that it cannot, strictly speaking, be certain but at most plausible that the water is healthy; hence I do not \u2018completely\u2019 assent to the impression. If it turns out to be unhealthy, my original impression was not mistaken, because I only took it to be plausible, rather than true, that the water was healthy, which is consistent with its being unhealthy. Thus the wise sceptic can act on the basis of mere plausibility while in an intelligible sense not getting things wrong.\n\nCicero suggests that even the Stoic sage will follow many things on the basis of plausibility, if life is to be possible at all (2.99); and his point, I take it, is supposed to apply not just in case it turns out that there are no cataleptic impressions, but even in those (presumably frequent) situations where such impressions, should they exist, are not present. The wise still have to live. Indeed, if one includes the crucial refinement made by the leading sceptical philosopher Carneades as part of the plausibility criterion \u2013 namely that the impression must be \u2018unimpeded\u2019 (2.104) \u2013 then we seem to have a way of addressing Lucullus\u2019 point that to have a notion of plausibility, or being likely to be true, depends on one\u2019s having a prior notion of truth as such.\n\nWhat does \u2018unimpeded\u2019 mean? Cicero spoke at 2.99 in terms of there being nothing that presents itself in opposition to the plausibility of the impression. Take the example of the water again. It looks healthy in my glass, it comes from a generally reliable source (my tap), there is nothing to indicate that it is not healthy \u2013 nothing, therefore, \u2018impeding\u2019, or presenting itself in opposition to, the plausibility of the impression that it is healthy. Say, further, that I then hear on the radio a news report that the water supply in my area has been contaminated. At this point there is something opposing \u2013 undercutting, one might say \u2013 the plausibility of the impression that the water is healthy and I would not therefore drink it.\n\nHow does this tell against Lucullus\u2019 criticism? It suggests that, rather than plausibility being dependent on truth, we might build a notion of truth upon that of unimpeded plausibility. Take the water case once again. What would it mean to be able to identify as true the impression that \u2018this water is healthy\u2019? It could be argued that its truth would be a matter of there being nothing to oppose the impression of plausibility \u2013 no \u2018defeaters\u2019, as it were. Say, then, that I turn on the radio and hear no news reports pertaining to my water; but being the ultra-cautious type I send the water to a lab for testing. It turns out that the sample is laden with harmful microbes. There is thus something opposing the plausibility of the impression that the water is healthy.\n\nIt seems as if one could move towards a notion of truth by utilising the condition that there is nothing opposing an initial impression that things are a certain way \u2013 in the water case, no news report, no adverse lab results, and so forth. This would still be a notion of truth as something possessed fallibly. But the sceptic can now speak of identifying some things as true (rather than as simply plausible) and others as the contrary (2.111). Carneades at any rate is not trying to provide an equivalent of the Stoic notion of infallible truth-possession. His \u2018unimpeded\u2019 condition is a refinement designed to give a criterion of reasonable action in the absence of such a notion. What one can do, using Carneades\u2019 method, is start with the impression of something\u2019s being the case and approach, but never reach, a position of certainty. It is a question of increasing the likelihood of correctness, not eliminating completely the possibility of error.\n\nIf so, then Cicero can likewise reject Lucullus\u2019 assertion that the sceptic must (inconsistently) hold their own theory of plausibility as certain. He reiterates Carneades\u2019 view that the theory, like any other claim, could at most have the status of plausibility by the very terms of the theory (2.110). Seen in the light of the \u2018unimpeded\u2019 condition, plausibility now looks a more robust notion than it may have appeared, and so the resting of one\u2019s whole procedure for decision and action on such a basis looks correspondingly less fragile, though of course it is still fallible. But scepticism deserves to be rejected not if it cannot claim certainty for its guiding principle, but if it fails to apply to itself the same standards of critical scrutiny that it does elsewhere.\n\nIn perhaps Cicero\u2019s most technical work, he rarely allows us to lose sight of what purpose the technicality serves. Lucullus had ended his speech in critique of scepticism by addressing Cicero himself, making what looks like a light-hearted jest that Cicero supports a philosophy that keeps things in the dark despite his having brought the most deeply hidden matters to light (2.62). He refers to the uncovering by Cicero of Catiline\u2019s conspiracy, a plot whose nature and significance remain a matter of debate, but whose thwarting Cicero refers to often and takes to represent his having more or less single-handedly saved the republic from catastrophe.\n\nThe punning contrast of obscurity and illumination that Lucullus employs thus has a serious point, reminding us that what turns on the sometimes abstruse epistemology is the vital practical question of whether the sceptical viewpoint allows there to be a proper basis for decision and action, especially on the political stage. Roman \u2013 and of course not just Roman \u2013 politicians, including Cicero himself and those whom he might hope to win over to the sceptical cause, must at times take life-and-death decisions.\n\nOne of the most controversial aspects of Cicero\u2019s actions against Catiline was the execution without trial of five of the alleged co-conspirators, an act that ultimately led to Cicero\u2019s exile. Is mere likelihood sufficient to justify the weight of one\u2019s actions in such cases? Should not certainty be the only proper basis? And is a criterion of plausibility even intelligible without a notion of certainty? Whatever we think of Cicero\u2019s answers to these questions, he leaves us in no doubt about why the questions matter. Even at its most abstract, philosophy\u2019s relation to the concrete and practical lies at the heart of his enterprise.\n\n6.2 Ethical Theory\n\nCicero\u2019s principal work on ethical theory, On Ends or On Moral Ends (in Latin De Finibus), offers perhaps the most vivid example of his use of the sceptical method to engage critically with questions about the nature of philosophy itself. The title abbreviates a longer Latin title (De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum) whose meaning \u2013 literally, On Ends of Goods and Evils \u2013 raises puzzles of its own (on which see Allen 2014), but refers, to simplify a little, to the question of what are the highest goods, the attainment of which will bring about a happy human life. Cicero considers three leading ethical theories of his day: Epicureanism, which proposes that pleasure is the highest good; Stoicism, which holds that virtue is not just the highest but the only good; and the theory of the so-called Old Academy, which, while including goods other than virtue within its conception of the supreme good, ranks virtue higher than the rest. The structure of the work is once again dialogical: for each theory, Cicero puts into the mouth of a proponent an exposition of that theory, followed by a critical response delivered by Cicero himself.\n\nCicero allows himself a head start on the exposition of Epicurean hedonism by its proponent Torquatus with an initial, critical outline of the theory in Book 1. At 1.23\u201324 he appeals to the behaviour of two of Torquatus\u2019 ancestors, both stern military men who treated their sons harshly (execution for cowardice and banishment for taking bribes, respectively), behaviour which in Cicero\u2019s view can only be explained by their having put the wider public interest ahead of their own pleasure, contrary to Epicurean prescription.\n\nCicero chooses examples that, in combining military with family, evoke core ancient Roman values. Torquatus then defends his ancestors\u2019 behaviour in terms compatible with Epicurean theory. Focusing in particular on the first Torquatus, he argues that he acted to uphold his authority at a time of war, and therefore to enhance his own security and so, ultimately, pleasure. More striking than the details of Torquatus\u2019 explanation is that he feels the need to give it. Why could he not have said that his ancestors were misguided and that it took later generations to see the Epicurean light? Torquatus says explicitly that he has no reason to fear that he cannot \u2018accommodate\u2019 his ancestors to the Epicurean view (1.34). That he rises to Cicero\u2019s challenge in this way indicates that ancestral behaviour has normative force for him: his ancestors must be read as acting from (what he considers) the correct motives.\n\nInterestingly, it appears that Torquatus\u2019 own father was an Epicurean, whom Torquatus evidently admired. He reports with enthusiasm his father\u2019s rebuttal of a Stoic argument against hedonism (1.39); and, though this is not said explicitly, perhaps was influenced by his father in adopting Epicureanism himself. Cicero thus slyly reinforces the sense that ancestral piety is an ineliminable part of the value system that Torquatus shares. He has induced Torquatus to agree that it would be a problem for the validity of Epicurean ethics if it did not sit comfortably with the norms of Roman culture. The reader is thus encouraged to reflect on whether, and if so how, the abstract and general features of an ethical theory are to fit with outlooks and practices which, at least in part, carry normative weight precisely because they represent adherence to a particular tradition: a strategy that Cicero further deploys in his more lengthy critique of Epicurean ethics in Book 2 (see Inwood 1990).\n\nHowever difficult it might be for Torquatus himself, it seems open to an Epicurean to respond that they have no obligation to simply accept Roman values as authoritative. Epicurean theory is professedly a radical one that sees most humans as having been corrupted by false values. What, then, should we, as non-Roman readers, make of Cicero\u2019s discussion? Even if we accepted that he demonstrates an incompatibility between Roman and Epicurean values, it is not clear that this should have any hold on us. We are surely both able and entitled to assess the Epicurean case on its own merits. On the other hand, we are no less the inheritors of cultural assumptions and outlooks than the Romans, even if ours are different, and even if the \u2018we\u2019 implied are a great and diverse plurality. Disentangling a thing\u2019s \u2018own merits\u2019 from the values we bring to an encounter with it is neither a simple nor perhaps a viable task.\n\nThis is not of course to say that our perspectives cannot be changed by such philosophical encounters. Ethical theory, particularly of the professedly radical sort that many ancient philosophers propounded, would hardly have a point if that were the case; and Cicero\u2019s project of communicating such theories would be equally unintelligible in that light. But coming to a theory from outside of any perspective is unintelligible. What Cicero\u2019s holding up of Epicurean ethics against the canvas of Roman tradition conveys is a point about how ethical theory in particular must conform, not so much to specific values and traditions, as to certain basic elements of what makes us human, without which it would be hard to discern how an ethical theory could have purchase on us at all: above all, perhaps, our status as social creatures shaped by our relation to specific histories and traditions.\n\nWhen it comes to Stoic theory, as laid out next by its spokesman Cato the Younger, things look more promising. Cato was historically the arch-defender of the traditional values of the Roman republic, while Stoicism, with its emphasis on the supremacy of virtue and the value of political participation, seems on the face of it to conform to the Roman way much more readily than Epicureanism does. Nonetheless, the stringency of Stoic theory, which holds that virtue is the only good thing, and vice the only bad thing, and takes virtue not to admit of degrees \u2013 without complete virtue one is not virtuous at all \u2013 allows Cicero to mount his critique.\n\nHe invites us to consider whether the Stoics have a theory which, in the terms they express it, can be proclaimed in those contexts that define the sphere of public life for a Roman: courts, assembly, Senate house, and battlefield. A lawyer, observes Cicero, could not credibly conclude the case for the defence by declaring that the punishments of exile and confiscation were not evils, but merely to be \u2018rejected\u2019 (the Stoic technical term for aversion toward things that nonetheless cannot affect one\u2019s happiness); nor could an orator announce, with Hannibal at the gates, that captivity, enslavement, and death were no evils (4.22). Moreover, the Senate would not be able to speak of Scipio Africanus\u2019 triumph as having been won by his valour, since he did not meet the standards of perfection required, in Stoic terms, for virtue (4.22).\n\nThis sort of objection seems especially damaging for the Stoics, with their emphasis on agency and public participation. In effect Cicero argues that the Stoics can have their integrity, or their theory, but not both. They cannot express their doctrines about virtue in public contexts without incurring ridicule or incomprehension. What they are left with, according to Cicero, is hypocrisy: the use of ordinary language in public, their own language in their writings (4.22).\n\nWhether or not Cicero is fair to the detail of Stoic and Epicurean ethics, his aim, as exemplified by the dialogical structure, is to provoke debate. In particular, his readers are invited to consider to what extent ethical theory must be answerable to social reality. Is not an ethical theory that cannot be lived consistently thereby flawed as a theory? In keeping with this question, Cicero moves next to a theory that seems on the face of it rather more congenial to lived experience, with an exposition by his interlocutor Piso of the ethics of the Old Academy, broadly in line with what we now think of as Aristotelian ethics.\n\nCrucially, this theory recognises a plurality of goods. Piso holds that virtue is sufficient for happiness but that there are also bodily goods such as health and freedom from pain, the possession of which, when added to virtue, will render the subject not just happy, as virtue on its own does, but \u2018supremely happy\u2019 (5.71). Cicero wonders whether treating such things as goods will not simply mean adopting the view of Aristotle\u2019s distinguished successor Theophrastus who, while providing a good deal of the resources for Piso\u2019s account (5.12), also acts as something of an outlier for having claimed that no life could be happy if caught up in pain or misfortune (5.77).\n\nCicero asks Piso to consider whether, even if one were to allow that a single misfortune might not affect the happiness of the virtuous, an accumulation of them would: could someone wracked by pain, disease, and other misfortunes plausibly be thought of as happy, let alone happiest? (5.84). Shrewdly turning against him the Aristotelian method of canvassing the views of both the many and the wise, to which Piso had appealed at 5.63 in support of his view of the supremacy of virtue, Cicero declares that ordinary folk would deny, and experts be unsure, that someone being tortured could be happy (5.85). Piso responds by giving a more worked-out \u2018lexical\u2019 account of the relation between virtue and the other goods, so as to underpin his view that virtue suffices for a happy (even if not for the happiest) life: the smallest amount of excellence of character is ranked ahead of all bodily goods; and no foul-but-pleasant action is better than any honourable-but-painful one (5.93). Virtue can thus be equated with happiness, while happiness can be enhanced through the addition of other goods (5.95).\n\nOne might think, however, that this theoretical tightening comes at a cost. The advantage of Piso\u2019s originally looser pluralism is that it accords with the views about value of those who, as Cicero puts it, have never come across a philosopher even in a painting (5.80). Piso is allowed to reiterate the criticism \u2013 indicating its importance for Cicero \u2013 that the Stoics adopt one set of terms in real life and another in the lecture room (5.89). But when Piso asks disapprovingly whether philosophers should speak in a different way from human beings (5.89), it is hard to avoid the thought that in his case the terminology of the street now dresses a more rigid substance. In becoming full-fledged theory, his discourse is in danger of losing what made it distinctive and attractive as an account of the good human life.\n\nCicero does not tell us which, if any, of the ethical theories that he discusses we should adopt. Matters are left explicitly unresolved at the close of On Ends (5.95\u20136). Cicero, however, not only offers us tools to think through the issues for ourselves, but in so doing, utilises the series of expositions and critiques that he lays out to raise pertinent questions, befitting the sceptical stance, about the status of ethical theory itself.\n\n6.3 Theology\n\nCicero\u2019s manifesto to write, in what proved to be his last period of literary production, encyclopedically about philosophy, is set out in the preface to his work of philosophical theology On the Nature of the Gods. The daunting task he sets himself is linked by him to the specific approach of the Academic sceptic. He cites with approval the example of Carneades, who by challenging Stoic theology aroused in people a desire to discover the truth (1.4). Cicero will take this one step further and aspire to examine critically all the relevant theories about the gods. His conception of a worthy philosophical encyclopedia is therefore much more than a dutiful trotting out of who thought what. His aim is to subject all available views to scrutiny.\n\nIn Cicero\u2019s view this approach fits the questions of theology particularly well, given the many and varied differences of opinion that exist about the nature of the gods. It may be, he declares, that none of the positions are correct; certainly, no more than one can be (1.5). The reader is thus put on notice that any view might in principle be overturned, and it is perhaps no surprise that Cicero says he will need to respond to critics who claim that sceptical philosophy, rather than providing illumination, \u2018floods things with darkness\u2019 (1.6).\n\nIn response, he says that upon the verdict reached about the nature of the gods will depend our assessment of the whole moral and material apparatus of religion, including by implication traditional Roman religion \u2013 indeed the examples he lists suggest that this is primarily what he has in mind (1.14). When he speaks, at the very start of the work, of its subject being one that was vital \u2018for the regulation of religion\u2019 (1.1), one might easily read that conservatively: we investigate the gods in order better to maintain the religious status quo. Now, however, it seems that our investigation is to be open, our sense of what (if any) is the correct religion awaiting the outcome of enquiry into the nature of the gods.\n\nThe greater part of Book 1 is given over to an exposition of Epicurean theology by Cicero\u2019s spokesman Velleius, followed by a critique from the work\u2019s representative of Academic scepticism, Cotta \u2013 Cicero also portrays a younger version of himself as holding mainly a listening brief at the discussion. Books 2 and 3 consist respectively of exposition (by Balbus) and critique (by Cotta) of Stoic theology, which, in stark contrast to the Epicurean version, has god managing the workings of the universe down to the smallest detail.\n\nThe Epicurean gods, on Velleius\u2019 telling, live a life of utter tranquility. They have no business to attend to; they simply take pleasure in their own wisdom and virtue, secure in the knowledge that their bliss will be everlasting (1.51). Since they have no troubles, they are not involved in the laborious business of creating or governing the universe, which arises and is sustained by the clustering of atoms in the void; they likewise have no concern with the travails of human life (1.52\u201354). This does not, however, mean that they are not rightly objects of piety and reverence: we worship the sublimity of their nature (1.56).\n\nWe can discern a coherent, if hardly uncontroversial, theological account here. Having previously criticised his opponents for not setting out a clear roster of divine attributes, Velleius is at pains to do that himself. The gods are, in a nutshell, immortal, beautiful and happy, with the corollaries of happiness meaning that they are virtuous and wise as well. Happiness is inconsistent with making or having trouble, so god is completely and everlastingly tranquil and at rest, enjoying the bliss of that state. Underlying this account is what one might call a negative principle: god must not exhibit any weakness or imperfection. If we now consider the maxim of Epicurus that Velleius cites about the blessed and eternal, its unfolding of what such a state implies is framed entirely negatively: it does not have troubles or make trouble for others, nor is it in the grip of anger or partiality since each is a sign of weakness (1.45). We might agree that the concept of god has to be that of a perfect being. And conceiving of perfection in terms of a lack of negative qualities is one way to substantiate what perfection might mean.\n\nThe Epicurean viewpoint also has implications for how we are to consider the relation between god and religion. Velleius\u2019 insistence on an anthropomorphic conception of god (1.46\u20138) is, in part, motivated by a desire to do justice to the traditional Greek picture of the gods \u2013 and, for that matter, the traditional Roman one, which shared an anthropomorphic conception with, and was deeply influenced by, the Greek inheritance. Equally, however, Velleius takes aim at traditional poetic representations of the gods as badly behaved humans on a larger scale. There is, in a correct conception of divinity, no place for war, strife, lust, anger or other violent emotions (1.42). And Velleius has little time for ordinary people\u2019s views about the gods, which he dismisses as \u2018mired in the greatest inconsistency through their ignorance of the truth\u2019 (1.43).\n\nCicero\u2019s agile use of the dialogue form is manifest in Cotta\u2019s response. He picks up on an aspect of the Epicurean method as Velleius had described it, namely that we must infer the existence of the gods from the fact that everyone has a conception (if often a distorted conception) that the gods exist. Cotta is happy for present purposes to grant the existence of god, while registering his dissatisfaction with both the idea that the belief is universally held, and the notion that, if it were, this would justify inferring its truth.\n\nHowever, Cotta also says that while it might be difficult to deny the existence of the gods in a public assembly, it should be easy to do so in the sort of meeting they are currently having (1.61). He later adds the thesis that anthropomorphic gods were either thought up by philosophers to encourage ordinary people to turn from vice to worship or were a product of a superstition that considered that the worship of concrete images allowed access to the gods themselves (1.77). He then presses the idea that the non-interventionist gods of the Epicureans are fatal to religion (1.116\u20137, 1.121), while characterising under the same heading, as \u2018utterly destructive of religion\u2019, those who claim that the notion of immortal gods is a fiction invented by the wise to lead people unsusceptible to reason to do, through religion, their duty (1.118). Cotta does not say that this analysis of the origin of the gods is incorrect; rather, he implies that its public dissemination would undermine the very aim that the analysis posits as an explanation.\n\nWe are back to the question of the relation between one\u2019s theory and one\u2019s public pronouncements. On this occasion, Cotta\u2019s own stance may seem both cynical and hypocritical: to maintain social order one must suppress one\u2019s own views, while reserving frankness for private gatherings of the philosophically minded. Yet here the formal difference between Cicero the author and Cotta the character is important. If, within the dramatic setting of On the Nature of the Gods, the gathering is indeed as Cotta describes, its embedding in a written work that Cicero intends to be read more widely blurs the line between private and public on which the charge of hypocrisy rests. If Cotta can be convicted of hypocrisy, it is less clear that Cicero is open to the same charge. He has let the cat out of the bag, and in so doing raised the vital question, for any reader, of the extent to which unrestricted frankness of speech can co-exist with the maintenance of social order.\n\nThe Stoic theology expounded next by Balbus seems less immediately vulnerable to these practical concerns; here there is a parallel with the respective treatments of the schools\u2019 ethical theories in On Ends. Indeed, while Velleius relied on a relatively technical and abstract approach in his exposition of the Epicurean view, Balbus offers in Stoicism a theology that seems targeted rather specifically at a Roman audience, and this in two distinct ways. First, the less technical presentation encourages readers who are unwilling or unable to enter the more tangled thickets of philosophical theory to engage with the basic ideas. Second, it promises to appeal to a Roman sense of specialness and pride in their nation by portraying the gods themselves as certifying that attitude through the interest they take in the wellbeing of Rome.\n\nThus, having separated out \u2018our [Roman] people\u2019 as bearers of the belief in gods\u2019 existence, Balbus proceeds to declare that the ever-increasing strength (as he sees it) of religious belief is no accident given the way the gods have concretely manifested their power. He then cites examples, from both distant and more recent Roman military history, of gods seen fighting on the side of Rome, or acting as messengers of Roman victory (2.6). He follows this up with tales of how divine premonitions were sent by the gods to warn Rome away from impending disaster, with dire consequences when they were ignored (2.7\u20138).\n\nIn fact, Balbus\u2019 lengthy speech both begins and ends with the placing of Rome at the forefront of divine providence. Towards the close of his speech, having argued for the thesis that the care of the gods is, to be sure, directed at the whole human race (2.164), he then gradually zooms in, first to the specific regions of the world, with Europe listed first; then to particular cities, with Rome listed first; and finally to individuals, all of whom happen to be Romans who achieved significant military success (2.165), though there is a nod to Greece and the Homeric heroes to bring up the rear.\n\nHence, in terms of the structure of his speech, one of the chief points of theological doctrine that distinguishes the Stoic view from the Epicurean \u2013 namely that the gods are concerned with human wellbeing and actively promote it \u2013 becomes, in Balbus\u2019 hands, the notion that this providential outlook has Rome not as its exclusive but certainly as its primary focus. On the face of it, this seems like a shrewd strategy: a Roman audience is, perhaps, more likely to be won over by an account that shows the gods as Rome\u2019s best friend than by one that shuns any notion of divine favour.\n\nYet there is also, from the point of view of the dramatic context, something peculiar about this approach. Balbus, it is true, is conversing with a group of staunch Romans. But they are also Romans whose philosophical sophistication has been emphasised. Is recounting tales of divine support for the Roman enterprise really the best way to persuade such an audience of the truth of one\u2019s philosophical position? The short answer, of course, is that Cicero\u2019s intended audience is wider and no doubt on average less philosophically sophisticated than the interlocutors at the scene. But there is a bit more going on than this.\n\nIn Book 1 Velleius\u2019 lucidity of exposition was pointedly contrasted by Cotta with more typical Epicurean obscurity (notably in Epicurus himself) in a way that seemed to warn that change of style does not necessarily leave substance untouched. Balbus in turn speaks of the advantages of his own full and rich style over the more compressed argumentative method found in the Stoic theoreticians, in particular Stoicism\u2019s founder Zeno of Citium. But he does so in a way calculated by Cicero to raise our suspicions: my style of presentation, says Balbus, flows like a river; and just as flowing rivers avoid being polluted much better than do enclosed pools, so too my stream of eloquence will dilute a critic\u2019s protestations, while a closely reasoned argument cannot so easily protect itself (2.20).\n\nThis is surely intended by Cicero to seem disquieting. If arguments need a cloak of rhetorical eloquence to save them from refutation, then the ideas in support of which those arguments are advanced might, on reflection, appear less, not more, convincing. Balbus then gives a brief list of some of Zeno\u2019s succinct deductive arguments in favour of the universe being intelligent, wise, happy and eternal, and therefore divine (2.21). So even as Balbus tells us that a more flowing presentation has a better chance of evading the \u2018calumnies\u2019 of the Academic critics (2.20), we as readers are offered the chance by Cicero to exercise our critical judgement on some concrete arguments, while reflecting, in equally critical vein, on the issue of how philosophy can be communicated without either the alienation of excessive technicality or the distortion of an overly smooth rhetoric.\n\nThe issue is then shown to have particular pertinence when religion is to the forefront. In his response to Balbus, Cotta, who also held the Roman office of priest, picks up on Balbus\u2019 plea, at the end of Book 2, that Cotta support Stoic doctrine, by asserting that by this was no doubt meant that he should uphold the ancestral beliefs about the gods and about religious practice \u2013 and, he adds, no discourse will ever turn him away from such beliefs (3.5). As a Roman aristocrat of distinguished ancestry and as a priest, it behooves Cotta to accept ancestral precedent even without rational argument; but, since Balbus is a philosopher, the latter ought to give such argument in defence of his claims (3.6). For Cotta, ancestral authority suffices for his belief that the gods exist (3.7, 3.9), whereas Balbus, since he \u2018despises authority\u2019, must fight using reason alone. So, in responding to him, Cotta will pitch his own reason against Balbus\u2019 (3.9).\n\nIt seems rather alarming that Cotta the avowed sceptic should tell us that he accepts positions on authority rather than through reason and imply that he (unlike Balbus) is no philosopher. One has some sympathy with Balbus\u2019 riposte that, if Cotta is already convinced that the gods exist, why should he want anything from him? (3.7). Of course, Cotta as a proponent of scepticism is prepared to use the weapons of reason against a philosopher. But one suspects that there is more to his disclaimers than a sly false modesty designed to provoke Balbus. We might think that appeal to authority is, in the religious case, very much to the point.\n\nReligions are not free-floating products of reason. They are based on tradition and the establishment of authority. Tradition of course is itself a product of evolution over time. But once something can be talked of as a religion, it already has in place structures and a history that can be seen to be reasonably deep-rooted and which, although it can evolve, must retain a sense of connection with those roots. In the religious context, tradition rather than reason is the principal authority, whether that be located in founding figures or documents, in time-honoured ceremonies and rituals, or in leaders who can claim to inherit the mantle of authority via their own devotion to the tradition \u2013 in the Roman context, the high priests whom Cotta affirms that he defers to on religious matters, rather than Stoic theorists (3.5).\n\nCotta has put his finger on something important about the role of authority in religion. If one calls the authority of tradition into question, then one risks having no religion left. And if one of the purposes of religion is, from a practical point of view \u2013 both in the Roman context and surely more widely \u2013 the promotion of a sense of social cohesion and communal identity, then to challenge tradition is to threaten those objectives. So Cotta\u2019s remarks on authority are not an evasion of Balbus\u2019 closing challenge, but an acknowledgement of what it means to have a religious commitment in the first place. Cotta\u2019s position here has plausibly been seen (Wynne 2019, 167) as an inspiration for fideism, the view that faith or tradition is a justificatory source of religious belief independent of reason.\n\nWe might nonetheless wonder whether Cotta can compartmentalise things so straightforwardly as to be governed by tradition from the point of view of his religious and Roman identity, and by reason when it comes to philosophical discourse. Here Cotta\u2019s implication that he is not a philosopher perhaps recognises something crucial about the nature of reason. The problem is not exactly that one might have different approaches in different contexts; in principle, that might be a perfectly sensible way to proceed. It is, rather, that if one demonstrates by reason that, for example, the gods do not exist, then the gods do not exist. Reason is not a compartment in which one can store a certain set of beliefs or conclusions that need not carry over to other areas of one\u2019s life. It is an integral part of the claim of reason that its claim is a universal one.\n\nThe tension between reason and tradition is not, then, to be resolved simply by carving out, for example, separate spaces for religion on the one hand and philosophy on the other. At the same time religion itself has something important to tell us about the nature of belief. When Cotta scoffs at Balbus\u2019 assertion, from his main speech, that the tales of gods appearing to us in human form provide evidence of their existence, Balbus responds by saying that surely ancient authority must carry some weight with Cotta. To this Cotta replies, along previous lines, that Balbus is offering \u2018hearsay when what I ask for is reason\u2019 (3.13). Balbus, as before, owes Cotta a rational defence of Stoic claims even if Cotta\u2019s own beliefs do not, and are apparently not required to, rest on such a defence.\n\nThis contrast between beliefs based on hearsay and on rational justification invites us to consider what it would be like if the latter were given the unrestricted scope that it seems to demand. Cotta\u2019s hiving off to the realm of the philosopher the task of giving rational explanations suggests that the role of reason might, in fact, have its limits. If, for example, rational justification were the only acceptable basis for holding a belief, it is difficult to imagine that one would hold many, or any, beliefs at all. Certainly, many if not most of our beliefs are ones that we simply find ourselves with \u2013 acquired on the authority of \u2018hearsay\u2019, whether that be parents, friends, books, teachers, religious leaders, public figures, or any other source that may not necessarily have offered a strict rational justification for claims that we come to believe.\n\nNow the beliefs that we do come to hold can then be subject to rational scrutiny; this notion is at the core of the sceptical approach that Cotta, and of course Cicero himself, espouse. But to make sense even of this it seems that we have to take some beliefs as given in order to find a perspective from which to rationally assess others. A project in which all one\u2019s beliefs are simultaneously subject to the test of rational justification is incoherent. And from a practical point of view, if we only acted on the basis of those beliefs that had been subject to, and survived, rational scrutiny, we would scarcely act at all.\n\nIf so, then it is not simply a case of religion deferring to reason. Beliefs we hold without the legitimation of reason have a necessary place. The upshot seems to be that religious beliefs, insofar as they either are not or cannot be subject to rational defence, are more representative than one might have supposed of the beliefs we hold more generally. In this regard, On the Nature of the Gods is not uncharacteristic of Cicero\u2019s whole approach to philosophy: he uses his characters\u2019 debates both to advertise the virtues of rational enquiry, and to suggest that those virtues reach right the way up, as perhaps they should, to the status of rational enquiry itself.\n\n7. Cicero and Bernard Williams\n\nThere is no space here to explore in any detail the question of Cicero\u2019s later reception. The influence of his philosophical approach on his great eighteenth-century successor, David Hume, particularly in matters of theology and religion, is, however, well-documented (see e.g. Fosl 1994, Stuart-Buttle 2020). So it seems appropriate instead to juxtapose that approach, albeit briefly, with the work of one of the most noted Anglophone philosophers of the twentieth century, Bernard Williams. Insofar as there are discernible points of contact between the two thinkers, readers may be in a better position to \u2018place\u2019 Cicero\u2019s philosophical project which, in its context of Roman politics and Hellenistic philosophical debate, is liable to appear a little recondite to contemporary eyes.\n\nLike Williams, then, Cicero engages deeply with his philosophical predecessors not principally as a historical exercise but as a creative way of doing, and communicating, philosophy. Like Williams, he is concerned to explore the scope and limits of philosophical theory, especially ethical theory, in relation to the character of lived human experience. Both thinkers take the view that theory tends to fall short in accounting for how one should live in practical contexts and for the place of integrity in an agent\u2019s life. Each combines a belief in the power of philosophy to illuminate with a marked scepticism about some of the claims that philosophy makes for itself. Not unconnectedly, the two thinkers show great care in the way they write philosophy; both evince a distaste for technicality for its own sake.\n\nIt is an irony in the history of philosophy that Williams himself, during a discussion of ancient scepticism, refers to Cicero, in passing, as a \u2018third-rate\u2019 thinker (2006, 33). If the affinities with Williams sketched here are anywhere near the mark, readers may be motivated to explore, by engaging with Cicero\u2019s philosophical work themselves, whether that verdict is entirely just."}, {"url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/cicero/", "page_content": "Marcus Tullius Cicero was born outside of Rome in 106 B.C.E. Born to a wealthy family, Cicero received a quality education. After he served in the military, Cicero studied Roman law. He went on to be elected to each of Rome\u2019s principal offices, becoming the youngest citizen to attain the highest rank of consul without coming from a political family.\n\nCicero remained loyal to the Roman Republic during his career. He viewed the informal alliance known as the First Triumvirate to be in direct opposition to the principles of the republic and authority of the Senate. By refusing to join this alliance , Cicero left himself vulnerable to attacks from his political enemies. This became an issue for Cicero when he came under fire for speaking out against the political figure and tribune Publius Clodius.\n\nWhen Clodius was elected as a tribune, he introduced a bill that revoked the citizenship of anyone who killed a Roman citizen without granting them a trial. This was designed to strike at Cicero for his role in putting down an uprising known as the Catalonian rebellion. Cicero ordered the execution of the revolutionaries without a trial due to the urgency that the rebellion needed to be ended. With no allies remaining to protect him from Clodius\u2019 attacks, Cicero fled Rome and become an exile. After a year and a half, however, he was allowed to return back to Rome as a result of Pompey\u2019s intervention following Clodius\u2019 term as tribune.\n\nWhen Cicero returned to Rome, he was forced to stay out of politics, so he turned to writing. He wrote many works relating to philosophy, such as On the Republic, On Invention, and On the Orator. He established himself as a prolific Roman author. He also made many speeches and wrote letters that have been preserved, allowing the modern world to gain knowledge of the politics and culture of Cicero\u2019s era.\n\nCicero\u2019s fate was sealed when he began speaking out against Mark Antony, who rose to power following Julius Caesar\u2019s assassination. Once Cicero denounced Antony, he was declared a public enemy and was executed in 43 B.C.E."}, {"url": "https://study.com/learn/lesson/cicero-philosophy-biography.html", "page_content": "In addition to his career in politics, Cicero was also a notable philosopher. His most notable contribution was transmitting ancient Greek ideas to Rome and (through Roman traditions) later Medieval Europe. Cicero's translation of ancient Greek ideas led him to invent several Latin terms. Key among his philosophical ideas is the idea of natural laws , which are independent of man-made laws and can be uncovered through the use of reason. Even rulers must obey natural laws, or else they are unjust tyrants. This idea was inspirational for the Founding Fathers of the United States, who channeled that idea into inalienable rights into the Constitution and Declaration of Independence.\n\nCicero was born in 106 BCE to a Roman Equestrian family. He was a gifted orator, politician, lawyer, and philosopher. His political life was characterized by an attempt to defend the Roman Republic from tyranny. His political career hit a high point when he dismantled a conspiracy by Catiline to overthrow the Roman Republic. Later, he would oppose Julius Caesar , Crassus, and Pompey when they seized political power. After the death of Crassus, Caesar and Pompey fought for control of Rome, and ultimately Caesar won. After Caesar's assassination, Cicero used one of his usual techniques, giving a speech to turn people against his enemies, to undermine Marc Antony . The speeches Cicero gave are called the Philippics , and although he had some early success in convincing Octavius to fight Marc Antony, Octavius and Marc Antony ultimately joined forces along with Lepidus. Marc Antony had Cicero (and many of his family members) killed.\n\nThe years following the execution of Catiline and his conspirators were turbulent. In 60 BCE, Julius Caesar , Pompey, and Crassus seized political power in Rome. Interestingly, Cicero's talents were so well-respected that they made multiple attempts to recruit Cicero to their cause. Ultimately Cicero refused. Consequently, a follower of Caesar's, Clodius, passed a law that made executing Roman citizens without trial a crime. Thus, Cicero was retroactively found guilty for having executed Catiline and his conspirators and was thereby exiled. Cicero returned to Rome after a brief period in exile after being invited by Julius Caesar. Upon his return, he practiced law and produced several philosophical works.\n\nCicero's philosophy was expounded in a series of works that he wrote later in life, e.g., On the Republic and On the Laws. His thought is highly indebted to the works of Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics. In studying ancient Greek philosophy , Cicero's definitions and terms were novel. He invented Latin terms to translate Greek concepts, and Cicero's Latin terms would provide the origins for the English terms morals, property, individual, science, image, and appetite.\n\nBiography: Early Career\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero was born in 106 BCE. His father was a member of Rome's growing middle class, known as Equestrians. A weak and sickly youth, Cicero was ill suited to military service, so he sought to expand his mind instead. He learned Greek at an early age and studied in Athens for several years.\n\nCicero's focus on improving his mind, rather than his might, proved a wise choice. The Rome of his age would see the rise of many great military leaders, but no one of an intellectual caliber to match Cicero.\n\nCicero was a great thinker and speaker and one of the most influential writers in Western history\n\nYet Cicero was not just a great thinker; he was also a great speaker. Cicero's life is an example of that age-old adage, 'the pen is mightier than the sword'. With his pen, Cicero destroyed his enemies and did all he could to protect the Republic from the series of ambitious generals who sought to rule Rome as tyrants.\n\nCicero's political career began in 75 BCE, when, at age 31, he served as quaestor for the province of Sicily. During his time there, the people of Sicily persuaded Cicero to bring charges against their old governor Gaius Verres, who had used his position to plunder the populace. For his defense, Gaius Verres hired Quintus Hortensius Hortalus, then the greatest lawyer of his age. Cicero's case for the Sicilians was so solid, his speeches so persuasive, that he defeated Hortalus completely, earning him great fame and making him one of the most sought-after lawyers in Rome.\n\nHis fame bolstered, Cicero climbed the Roman political system with surprising speed. He served as an aedile in 69 BCE (age 37), and praetor in 66 BCE (at age 40). And in 63 BCE, he attained the highest honor a Roman citizen could hope for, being elected consul at the incredibly young age of 43.\n\nAs consul, Cicero had to deal with the Catiline Conspiracy, an attempt to overthrow the Republic with a foreign army. He rallied the Senate against Catiline and his co-conspirators in a series of speeches called the Catiline Orations, which survive to this day. After assembling a mountain of evidence against the conspirators, Cicero had them all summarily executed.\n\nThe execution of Roman citizens without trial led the Senate to exile Cicero to Thessalonika in Greece, but the same Senate brought him back the next year. The Senate found themselves dealing with another political powerhouse, Julius Caesar, who also seemed to be threatening to overthrow the Republic.\n\nThe Death of Cicero and the Republic\n\nIf the Senate had hoped Cicero would help deal with Caesar, they were sadly mistaken. Caesar was far too popular at that point and had powerful allies in Pompey and Crassus. Though Cicero tried to rein in Caesar, his measures were defeated, and Cicero retreated to the literary life. When Caesar brought his army to Rome, Cicero fled with the other senators and Pompey.\n\nYet Cicero need not have fled, since Caesar was actually very keen on having Cicero as an ally. In 60 BCE, Caesar had invited Cicero to join his alliance with Pompey and Crassus, but Cicero refused, seeing this triumvirate as a danger to the Republic. Before Cicero's flight in 49 BCE, Caesar again tried to court the great orator's support. Upon Cicero's return to Rome in 47 BCE, Caesar pardoned him without reservation, hoping to bring Rome's great orator into his camp.\n\nCicero worked with Caesar to rebuild the Republic; later, the divide of Rome would lead to his death\n\nCicero did his best to rebuild the Republic under Caesar, but his fellow senators could not bring themselves to make the same compromises. They murdered Caesar on the Ides of March in 44 BCE.\n\nAfter Caesar's assassination, Rome divided into two camps: the Senatorial camp, who supported the aristocracy and strove to restore the Republic, and the Caesarian camp, who supported Caesar and his many reforms. Cicero became the foremost representative of the Republic and the Senate, while Caesar's right hand man, Mark Antony, led the Caesarian camp. This marks the height of Cicero's political power.\n\nWhen Caesar's heir, the young Octavian, came on the scene, Cicero attempted to turn Octavian and the Republic against Mark Antony, with a series of speeches known as the Philippics. Cicero succeeded at first. He got Mark Antony declared an enemy of the state, and sent Octavian with an army to defeat him. But Octavian and Antony eventually united and turned against the Senate. Antony returned Cicero's dislike with interest, and had the great orator labeled an enemy of the state.\n\nCicero's name was added to the list of proscriptions, and in 43 BCE, Cicero was dragged from his litter and summarily executed at the age of 63. Upon his murder, his hands were nailed to the rostrum of the Roman Forum.\n\nCicero's Philosophy\n\nThough Cicero played an important role in Roman political life, his greatest impact on Rome was in his philosophical writings. Cicero's philosophy was largely derivative. Clearly, he was heavily influenced by Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics, though he did differ with the Stoics on the importance of public service."}]}
