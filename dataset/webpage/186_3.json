The fact that he died relatively young has in some ways diminished his reputation. And yet his catalogue of recordings is a testament to his brilliance and along with Jimmy Smith and his Hammond B3, Montgomery did so much to encourage people, who were perhaps a little fearful, to give jazz a try.\n\n\u201cI learned to play listening to Wes Montgomery\u2019s Smokin\u2019 at the Half Note.\u201d \u2013 Pat Metheny\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJohn Leslie Montgomery got the name Wes when he was a teenager; it\u2019s a corruption of his middle name. Born on 6 March 1923 in Indianapolis, Wes followed in the footsteps of his bass playing older brother, Monk, and took up the six-string guitar when he was twenty, having played a four-string guitar since he was twelve; later their piano and vibes playing younger brother, Buddy, joined the family of musicians. He learned the guitar from listening to Charlie Christian records, he was note-perfect on his hero\u2019s solos, and also taught himself to read music.\n\nAfter a spell playing in local bands, he joined Lionel Hampton\u2019s orchestra in July 1948 and spent the next eighteen months touring and recording with the band. After Montgomery quit Hampton\u2019s band in January 1950 he went back to Indianapolis and nothing more was heard from him musically until 1955, and then just one session for Columbia. In 1957 the three brothers and trumpeter Freddie Hubbard recorded together. For the next two years the Montgomery Brothers recorded for World Pacific Jazz and Wes, in particular, began to build a reputation as a gifted guitarist.\n\nIn October 1959 the Wes Montgomery Trio recorded for the Riverside label in New York City and over the next year or so, as well as recording under his own name, Wes worked in the studio with singer Jon Hendricks, trumpeter Nat Adderley, saxophonists Harold Land and Cannonball Adderley, John Coltrane, George Shearing, Milt Jackson as well as a number of sessions with his brothers. In the Downbeat poll for best guitarist, he was pre-eminent from this time onwards; his much loved, unique, tone was in part derived from using his thumb rather than a plectrum.\n\nMontgomery\u2019s work is characterised by the way he built his solos from the melodies. His original imagination created seemingly simple solos that often surprises the listener but always felt just right.\n\nFrom 1962 he recorded mostly under his own name for the Riverside label and recorded some acclaimed albums including The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery in 1960 with pianist Tommy Flanagan, bassist Percy Heath and drummer Albert \u2018Tootie\u2019 Heath. It features two of Montgomery\u2019s best-known compositions, \u2018Four on Six\u2019 and \u2018West Coast Blues.\u2019 He was signed by Verve late in 1964 and his first sessions with Johnny Pate\u2019s orchestra in November produced the album, Movin\u2019 Wes.\n\nIn March 1965 he recorded with Don Sebesky\u2019s Orchestra at Rudy Van Gelder\u2019s studio and the tracks made up the album Bumpin\u2019 becoming the first of his ten albums to make the Billboard Pop charts. The album proved difficult for Montgomery to make as when he was recording with the full orchestra he was unable to get the results he wanted. Sebesky came up with the idea of Montgomery recording with a small group to which orchestral overlays were added. Over the next three years, Wes was rarely off the charts with albums including Tequila (1966), arranged by Claus Ogerman, California Dreaming (1967) and Jimmy & Wes The Dynamic Duo, an album recorded with Jimmy Smith.\n\nOne of his most appreciated Verve albums is Smokin\u2019 at the Half Note (1965) that was recorded at the New York City club with the Wynton Kelly Trio. Although both this and his Further Adventures of Jimmy and Wes failed to chart they are fine albums and certainly at the jazzier end of the spectrum, which may well account for their lower sales. Both these albums are representative of Montgomery\u2019s club appearances throughout his career when he played in small group settings rather than the orchestral accompaniment that he so often appeared with on record.\n\nIn late 1967 Montgomery signed for Creed Taylor\u2019s CTI Records, a subsidiary of A&M Records, and had his most successful record on the Billboard charts when A Day In The Life reached No.13 and stayed on the charts for well over a year on its way to becoming the best selling jazz album of 1967.\n\nOn 15 June 1968, just a month after his last ever recording session for A&M, and shortly after returning from a tour with his quartet, Montgomery woke up feeling unwell; within minutes he had a heart attack and died instantly. He was forty-five years old and at the peak of both his fame and success.\n\nMontgomery\u2019s influence on jazz guitar cannot be understated. Joe Pass said, \u201cTo me, there have been only three real innovators on the guitar\u2014Wes Montgomery, Charlie Christian, and Django Reinhardt.\u201d It is not just jazz guitarists that recognise Montgomery\u2019s talent, among the rock fraternity; Stevie Ray Vaughan, Joe Satriani and Jimi Hendrix have all acknowledged his influence. Lee Ritenour, who recorded the 1992 album Wes Bound, also named his son Wesley.\n\nWords: Richard Havers\n\nUK English Format:UK English"}, {"url": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/wes-montgomery-a-players-perspective-622741", "page_content": "With the recent release of In The Beginning, a double-album set on Resonance Records that features newly discovered 'live' recordings and studio sessions, we ask: what makes Wes Montgomery so special? Why is he still relevant today? And what can all guitarists, regardless of style, learn from this humble genius?\n\nThroughout the 1930s and 40s, guitarists were faced with a major challenge: how to adapt the 'language' of jazz on to the fretboard. From its seedy beginnings in the Red Light District of New Orleans at the turn of the 20th century, jazz had been a horn players' music. So much of the basic vocabulary centred around the way trumpets, saxophones, clarinets and trombones slid, bent, glissed and sustained their phrases.\n\nFor years, the humble guitar languished in the rhythm section, where it thumped along with the bass and drums while horn players wailed out front.\n\nEarly solo pioneers such as Eddie Lang, Lonnie Johnson and Django Reinhardt paved the way for the single-string genius of Charlie Christian who, blessed with the new-fangled electric guitar, was able to forge its place in the 'front line' of jazz ensembles.\n\nChristian's contribution started a revolution. Guitarists were finally liberated - and among them was Wes Montgomery.\n\nThe Thumb\n\nWes was entirely self-taught and early on decided to sacrifice speed for tone by using the right-hand thumb instead of a plectrum. The fat, warm sound he was able to produce with the thumb created a very vocal, soulful 'voice' that's very difficult to obtain with a pick.\n\n\"His technique seemed to allow him to play anything he wanted\" - Steve Howe\n\nMost players who try this technique find it stifling, as upstrokes are so difficult to articulate. Jim Mullen, himself a thumb player, points out that Wes \"had a double-jointed thumb, which meant he could play both up- and downstrokes like a pick player\".\n\nUltimately, Wes became so good with the thumb that any drop in speed became irrelevant, as Steve Howe points out: \"His technique seemed to allow him to play anything he wanted.\"\n\nListening now, over 50 years after some of his most celebrated recordings were made, the velocity Wes could generate when needed is still astonishing. A prime example is his solo on the John Coltrane tune Impressions, which he takes at a breakneck speed. In fact, there isn't a single moment in any Wes recording where you would think he'd do better with a pick!\n\nPicky about picks\n\n\"His technique shouldn't have allowed him to play fast, but... he could play fast!\" says John Etheridge, although speed-for-speed's-sake was the last thing on Wes's mind. He always seemed to play exactly what was right in any given musical moment and was much more interested in generating a 'mood'.\n\nThe tone produced by his magic thumb was a prime ingredient in Wes Montgomery's emotional arsenal. On top of this, Wes had his own way of emulating the horn style of jazz phrasing by, in the words of Nigel Price, \"constructing a huge vocabulary of slides, hammer-ons, pull-offs and slurs, which set him apart from all the other guitarists of the day\".\n\nHerein lies a major component of what makes Wes so great. He was, arguably, the first jazz guitarist to fully incorporate the legato approach of the horn players, and we can speculate as to how much the thumb approach contributed to that.\n\nAdrian Utley makes the point that the thumb gave Wes \"a great 'connection' with his instrument... no plastic pick to get in the way\". This also played a large part in his beautiful, relaxed phrasing, which, coupled with his innate musicianship, produced playing that is as moving as it is awe-inspiring.\n\nThe 'Formula'\n\n\"I was immediately struck by the energy, sophistication and sheer joy in his playing\" - Martin Taylor\n\n\"I first saw Wes on a BBC TV show in the 60s,\" recalls Martin Taylor. \"I was immediately struck by the energy, sophistication and sheer joy in his playing.\"\n\nIt's difficult to imagine the impact that Wes had when he first came to prominence. As Steve Howe says: \"The newness of the sound that Wes brought to us in the 1960s was so refreshing.\"\n\nWhat was it, then, that set him apart from other great guitarists of the day? The answer, perhaps, lies in his unique approach to soloing, which became something of a 'formula' and ultimately defined his art.\n\nThe formula itself? Single-line passage, octave passage, block-chord passage was a beautifully simple way of building subtle intensity as the solo developed and yet another indication of his genius. Horn players - having a broader palette of range, dynamics and tonal colours - were able to build their solos by introducing those elements as the solo developed.\n\nThick solos\n\nCertainly in those days, guitarists had just one sound at their disposal, making it more difficult to maintain interest and intensity when they played. Wes found a brilliant and simple way round this problem by, as John Etheridge points out, \"reinforcing\" and \"thickening\" his lines as his solo progressed.\n\nAfter a passage of fluid, bluesy, always relaxed single-string licks, Wes would move onto octaves for the next stage, and play them so effortlessly that you would hardly notice the transition. Yet, the line is now doubled and intensity is added to the solo.\n\nThe last phase of the solo would see Wes move from octaves to full chords - known as 'block' chords - which would further increase the drama and excitement. John Etheridge elaborates:\n\n\"All three were used strictly melodically, the single line reinforced with octaves, essentially thickening the line. Then, his chord improvisations - and this is very important - were also used melodically. It wasn't like, 'Look, I can do this harmonic inversion of this substitution.'\"\n\nEach device follows as a natural progression from the other. There are countless examples of Wes employing the 'formula', although West Coast Blues epitomises the technique.\n\nThe key, as Jazz player Jim Mullen points out that Wes had a double-jointed thumb, enabling him to play both up- and downstrokes Etheridge points out, is melody and melodic drive. Jim Mullen adds:\n\n\"His octave playing was an imitation of the trumpet-tenor sax frontline and his improvised chord solos were beautiful, melodic inventions.\"\n\nSteve Howe describes Wes as a \"brilliant, naturally gifted improviser\", and Nigel Price emphasises how one \"rarely gets the feeling that Wes is forcing through pre-learned patterns, unlike many jazz guitarists today\".\n\nNatural is a key word. Wes played in a way that is increasingly absent from jazz these days. He sounds like he doesn't care about scales, modes, substitutions or clever little 'guitaristic' devices. His playing exists solely in the pursuit of melody. As Adrian Utley says about another Montgomery masterpiece, D-Natural Blues: \"You can sing the whole thing: it's so melodic, perfect and succinct.\"\n\nThe Blues\n\nWes Montgomery was a master of the blues. Regardless of how complicated the chord changes or melody of the tune he was playing, it was always laced with the blues. Wes recorded many variations on the 12-bar throughout his career: the aforementioned D-Natural Blues, as 'down-home' as it gets; and the loping waltz time of West Coast Blues, with its lovely 'twist' in the chord pattern.\n\n\"Wes sounded so effortless, his rhythmic feel was so 'in the pocket', relaxed and flowing\" - John Etheridge\n\nOther prime examples are Blue 'N' Boogie, a medium-up-tempo swinger, and Cariba, a minor blues with a Latin feel. Then there's the unusual 16-bar Twisted Blues, which features some fabulous alterations to the standard sequence, as its title suggests.\n\nRegardless, Wes played real blues on everything - meaning 'blues, the attitude' rather than 'blues, the pentatonic scale'. John Etheridge reminds us that Wes \"sounded so effortless, his rhythmic feel was so 'in the pocket', relaxed and flowing. Everything he did was beautifully played and phrased, it was so sensitive... he makes you 'feel' the song, which is very important... he really does tell a story.\"\n\nA musician first\n\nOf course, telling a story has its roots in the blues. When you listen to old live recordings of, say, BB King, you can hear the crowd responding vocally to phrases he plays - call and response - and you can hear the jazz equivalent with Wes.\n\nHe'll put a 'full stop' on a phrase at the perfect moment before picking up the next idea. Subtle use of space was as powerful a tool in Wes's hands as all the blistering single lines, octaves and chord melody he'd mastered.\n\nKnowing when not to play, creating momentum with subtle but brilliant rhythmic devices, holding back, pushing forward. There's such a vocal quality to Montgomery's playing that you could almost fit lyrics to his lines - \"you can sing the whole thing!\"\n\nIn some ways, he was the most un-guitar- like of guitar players. His musicianship transcended his chosen instrument. Martin Taylor reinforces this point when he says:\n\n\"Django has gone down in history as a great guitarist but I always think that Wes was a musician first, a guitarist second. Wes would have been a great musician whatever instrument he chose to play.\"\n\nTranscribe a Wes Montgomery solo for a sax player and what you will hear is a great jazz solo, exactly as Taylor describes. Nigel Price adds: \"Wes played everything for the music. His improvisations were always in keeping with the vibe of the material.\" This was most apparent when Wes played his beloved blues.\n\nwes montgomery\n\nThe Guitar\n\nWes owned and played a variety of Gibson archtops over the years that would have us all drooling. A Gibson L-4 with a 'Charlie Christian' pickup, an ES-175 and an ES-125 are all guitars he was photographed with in the early days. The instrument he'll be forever associated with, though, is the L-5.\n\nLater in his career, Gibson made him a 'custom' model with a single neck humbucker and a metal tune-o-matic bridge to replace the traditional wooden one. This was Wes's request, as the metal bridge brightened the tone, offsetting the dark sound produced by his thumb. At some point, Wes had the pickup reversed.\n\nContrary to popular belief, he was constantly looking for ways to brighten the sound. His strings were, in the words of Russell Malone, \"cables!\" - 0.014 to 0.058. His choice of amp fluctuated between Fender Super Reverbs and Twins, before he switched to a Standel Super Custom in the mid 60s.\n\nRegardless, Wes never cared too much about gear and saw his equipment as nothing more than a tool to get the job done, once saying, \"I got a standard box. I don't never want nothing special. Then, if I drop it, I can borrow someone else's.\"\n\nHe also dabbled with a Fender electric bass. His brother Monk Montgomery is credited with being the first to play jazz on a bass guitar, so it was close to Wes all along. He even recorded some solos on bass for the Movin' Wes album, which Steve Howe describes as a \"hidden gem in his crown\".\n\nThe Legacy\n\nFor someone who was quite content honing his craft in jazz clubs around Indianapolis while supporting his wife and seven children by also holding down a full-time day job, Wes probably wasn't as ready for the limelight as much as the jazz world was ready for him to be there.\n\nHe was 37 years old when he was 'discovered' and signed to Riverside Records but had been quietly \"reinventing jazz guitar\" for over a decade, as Jim Mullen says, with nightly gigs on his local scene.\n\n\"I don't practise. Every now and then I open the guitar case and throw a piece of raw meat in!\" - Wes Montgomery\n\nThe recordings just released by Resonance come from these times. Here, we can get close to the 'real' Wes, playing effortless jazz to a relative handful of clubgoers. We can hear him in a relaxed and informal setting playing for the sheer joy of it and clearly having the time of his life. The \"relaxed but ferocious energy\" that Adrian Utley describes is in evidence on these amateur recordings.\n\nThe years in the clubs meant that Wes arrived on the international scene fully formed, making him seem even more incredible when his albums first appeared. The fact that he lived fewer than 10 years between his first major album and his death only serves to add to the intensity.\n\nThat he chose, admirably it would seem, to 'sell out' to a major label and become a Grammy Award-winning 'pop' act toward the end allows us an insight into his philosophy on music and the guitar. He only ever saw it as \"a hobby\" and remained humble and down- to-earth while blowing everybody away with his incredibly joyous music.\n\nBoundary pusher\n\nHe claimed not to practise, saying, \"I don't practise. Every now and then I open the guitar case and throw a piece of raw meat in!\" On another occasion, he elaborated: \"If I know it, I don't need to practise it. If I don't know it, I ain't risking it!\"\n\nThe fact is, Wes Montgomery was a man who genuinely did play for the love of it. He never allowed himself to be tortured by any technical shortcomings or threatened by the new generation of great players coming up in the 60s, such as Joe Pass or George Benson. He merely turned up at a gig or a studio and played heartfelt, honest, soulful and beautiful music before going home to his beloved family.\n\nGuitarists of all genres have repeatedly acknowledged their admiration for Wes Montgomery. From Jimi Hendrix to Eric Johnson; from Steve Vai to Stevie Ray Vaughan; from Joe Satriani to Steve Lukather... Wes has never been just a jazz guitarists' favourite. His music has, and always will, defy categorisation and transcend musical boundaries. Perhaps this should serve as the ultimate lesson taught by this great man.\n\nMany thanks to John Etheridge, Steve Howe, Jim Mullen, Nigel Price, Martin Taylor and Adrian Utley."}, {"url": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/george-benson-the-11-guitarists-that-blew-my-mind", "page_content": "(Image credit: Austin Hargrave)\n\nIt should come as no surprise that a conversation with jazz guitar hero George Benson often feels every bit as poetic as the music made by the man himself.\n\n\u201cYou know, I really like Walking To New Orleans because it\u2019s so simple,\u201d he says of the title track on his new covers album, out now via Mascot Label Group/Provogue.\n\n\u201cOnly Fats Domino could have come up with an idea like that.

It was very informing, very enlightening and very pleasurable. Chuck probably had a small amplifier that could not project loudly, so he had to turn it up to distortion level in order to be heard - which is how he invented that fuzz tone and made it popular.\n\n\u201cBut cats who had money to afford a big amplifier didn\u2019t have the same advantage, so someone had to invent the fuzz tone box to create that sound, haha! I think Chuck is very important in causing all of it to happen.\u201d\n\nYears ago, they tried to get me to use pedals. I tried for a minute and then thought it just took too much attention off the guitar\n\nThe brown sunburst Ibanez GB10 held in his hands on the album cover is precisely what can be heard throughout the album, fed direct into a Fender Twin - an amp which George praises for its ultra-clean and lightning-quick response.\n\n\u201cThough I also used the really old, classic D\u2019Angelico that I made a lot of hit records with,\u201d he notes.\n\n\u201cIt only comes out of the closet every now and then because I\u2019ve been an avid Ibanez player for many years and we have a great relationship. They make such beautiful guitars - I enjoy playing them because they make life easy for me! I did use Polytone for a while, but I have to say Fender have made me some great amps over the years. There\u2019s a Bassman and a Deluxe model I use for smaller venues, but the Twin you hear on this album is my favourite amplifier of them all.\u201d\n\nThere was a time long ago in Benson\u2019s career where he very briefly considered adding to the basic building blocks of his sound. It didn\u2019t take much longer than 60 seconds for him to realise he simply had no cause for anything else but an amp, a cable and the guitar in his hands.\n\n\u201cYears ago, they tried to get me to use a lot of those things - pedals, as you call them,\u201d he laughs.\n\n\u201cI tried for a minute and then thought it just took too much attention off the guitar. I can\u2019t concentrate on improvisation while worrying about what\u2019s going on with my feet.

Perhaps that\u2019s because, traditionally, the guitar, which superseded the banjo in jazz rhythm sections, was primarily perceived as a supporting and accompanying instrument rather than a viable vehicle for solo improvisation.\n\nAnother reason why the spotlight didn\u2019t fall on jazz guitar players in the music\u2019s formative years was that their instrument was acoustic and didn\u2019t have the ability to cut through the rest of the ensemble like brass and woodwind instruments could. So while the horns basked in the limelight, guitarists had to make do strumming chords and comping in the background.\n\nBut electric amplification changed everything for the role of the guitar in jazz. Introduced in 1931, the hollow-bodied electric guitar was immediately sought-after by guitarists struggling to be heard in the swing era of brass-heavy big bands. Now, though, not only could their percussive rhythm work be clearly audible in relation to the rest of the ensemble, but the possibility of playing solo passages had also become a tangible reality. Even so, due to the propulsive nature of big band swing and its emphasis on the interplay of the horns, the best jazz guitarists of the era \u2013 like the Count Basie band\u2019s Freddie Green, one of the pre-eminent swing-era axe men \u2013 were rarely granted, or even desired, solo passages.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut there were exceptions. Enter Django Reinhardt, the revolutionary Belgian gypsy guitarist who made his name playing in smaller ensembles and redefined the role of the guitar in jazz. His phenomenal fingerboard work was an inspiration to guitarists everywhere and gave rise to a new generation of jazz guitar star: virtuosic soloists as well as solid rhythm section men.\n\nCharlie Christian was the next significant guitarist in jazz. As part of Benny Goodman\u2019s band, he blew people\u2019s minds with his ability to solo using single, flowing melodic lines like a horn player. Christian\u2019s advanced harmonic conception anticipated the development of bebop, which, though a horn-led sonic revolution (its main architects were saxophonist Charlie Parker and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie), nonetheless saved a bit of the spotlight for some of the best jazz guitarists of the 40s and 50s.\n\nTheir ilk proliferated in the 50s, though the guitarist who stood head and shoulders above everyone else was a modest genius from Indianapolis called Wes Montgomery, who rose to fame as the 50s met the 60s. Montgomery, like his idol, Charlie Christian, could play single-note lines like a horn player, but also incorporated chords and octaves in his solos. His jaw-dropping abilities made him seem superhuman, and he was soon hailed as one of the best jazz guitarists to have walked the planet.\n\nMontgomery\u2019s influence was deep and wide, but the 60s witnessed the arrival of a new breed of jazz guitar slinger (think Larry Coryell and John McLaughlin) that combined jazz\u2019s complex harmonic language with the high-decibel dynamics of rock music.\n\nSince then, jazz guitarists (Pat Metheny, for example) have generally been a more eclectic breed, absorbing an array of influences, sounds, and stylistic elements from all kinds of different musical sources. But one thing that unites them all is their debt to the early pioneers, who took jazz guitar out of the shadows and into the light.\n\nWhile you\u2019re reading, listen to our best jazz guitarists playlist here.\n\n50: John Pizzarelli (born 1960)\n\nHaving a noted guitar-playing father (swing specialist Bucky Pizzarelli) no doubt accelerated this New Jersey fretboardist\u2019s musical development; he found himself playing with the likes of Benny Goodman and Clark Terry while still a teenager.

As a result, Ulmer created a discursive idiom defined by scratchy chords and jagged melodic shards. More recently, Ulmer has explored his blues roots, though his sui generis approach to jazz guitar remains unparalleled among the best jazz guitarists in history.\n\n40: Eric Gale (1938-1994)\n\nA prolific session ace with perfect pitch whose main musical domain was R&B and funk, Gale \u2013 as some of his solo albums attested \u2013 could also play some mean and dexterous bop-influenced jazz guitar. At the root of his sound was a deep blues core, which manifested itself in a plaintive, BB King-esque crying tone.\n\n39: Eddie Lang (1902-1933)\n\nA crucial architect in the evolution of big band swing guitar (he played in Paul Whiteman\u2019s and Bing Crosby\u2019s large ensembles in the early 30s), Lang (born Salvatore Massarro) earns his place among the world\u2019s best jazz guitarists thanks to the pivotal role he played in getting the guitar accepted as a viable jazz instrument (replacing the traditional banjo). A huge influence on Django Reinhardt, Eddie Lang is rightly hailed as the \u201cfather of the jazz guitar.\u201d\n\n38: Larry Carlton (born 1948)\n\nLike his contemporaries Steve Khan and Lee Ritenour, Larry Carlton was a first-call session guitarist in the 70s and his distinctive, jazz-informed blues-rock sound defined seminal albums such as Steely Dan\u2019s The Royal Scam and Joni Mitchell\u2019s Hejira. Carlton\u2019s own work has been more fusion-oriented, with his early albums being a precursor to what is now called smooth jazz.\n\n37: Laurindo Almeida (1917-1995)\n\nHailing from S\u00e3o Paulo, self-taught Almeida\u2019s passport to the US was writing the lucrative song \u201cJohnny Peddler,\u201d which was a hit for vocal group The Andrews Sisters. He then joined Stan Kenton\u2019s band and, in addition to being a prolific recording artist, found plenty of work as a West Coast session musician. At home with both acoustic and electric guitars, Almeida was a pioneer who blended jazz with the sounds and styles of Brazil.\n\n36: George Van Eps (1913-1998)\n\nWith his mellow, well-rounded tone, this New Jersey-born guitarist was first drawn to the banjo as a youngster, but after hearing Eddie Lang playing with big bands, switched to the guitar. He made his radio debut at 13 and then, in the 30s, as his notoriety gained momentum, he played in several big bands, including Bennie Goodman\u2019s. Van Eps designed his own seven-string guitar, which added lower bass notes and allowed him to develop his own finger-picking style.\n\n35: Sonny Sharrock (1940-1994)\n\nNot many of the world\u2019s best jazz guitarists can also claim to have started out singing doo-wop in the 50s. That\u2019s how New Yorker Warren \u201cSonny\u201d Sharrock began his career, though in the 60s he became one of the leading lights of avant-garde jazz guitar. The saxophone was his preferred choice of instrument (he had fallen in love with John Coltrane\u2019s sound) but his asthma prevented him taking up a woodwind instrument. Instead, he turned to the guitar, and his signature style \u2013 which was loud and funky \u2013 used horn-like lead lines as well as rock-style amp feedback.\n\n34: Howard Roberts (1929-1992)\n\nHailing from Phoenix, Arizona, Roberts picked up his first guitar at the age of eight and was working professionally at 15. He moved to Los Angeles and was soon in demand as a session ace, eventually working with the elite group of sessioneers known as The Wrecking Crew. An adherent of the West Coast \u201ccool school,\u201d Roberts\u2019 style combined a detached emotional restraint with fleet-of-finger technical virtuosity. As well as recording many solo albums for a plethora of labels, he also worked as a record producer. Outside of jazz, Roberts appeared on songs by The Monkees and The Electric Prunes.\n\nWhen The Sun Comes Out\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n33: Kevin Eubanks (born 1957)\n\nThe nephew of jazz pianist Ray Bryant, Philly-born Eubanks arrived at the guitar after trying his hand at the violin and trumpet. His big break came when he moved to New York in 1980 and played with Art Blakey. 1983 saw the release of Eubanks\u2019 debut album and he\u2019s been recording regularly ever since. A dexterous guitarist who\u2019s comfortable with both electric and acoustic instruments, Eubanks combines flowing melodic lines with crisp percussive effects and a sumptuous harmonic content.\n\n32: Bill Connors (born 1949)\n\nThough his tenure with Return To Forever was short and overshadowed by the arrival of his flamboyant replacement, Al Di Meola, in 1974, Connors played on the group\u2019s seminal Hymn Of The Seventh Galaxy album and takes his place among the world\u2019s best jazz guitarists thanks to his importance in the evolution of jazz-rock guitar. The Los Angeles guitarist created a signature, readily identifiable style fusing jazz chromatics and advanced chord changes with elements of blues and rock.\n\n31: Steve Khan (born 1947)\n\nThe son of renowned songwriter Sammy Cahn, Steve Khan excelled as a versatile studio sideman (his credits range from Steely Dan and Bob James to Billy Joel and Aretha Franklin) while pursuing a solo career that has garnered two Grammy nominations. In the 70s, Khan successfully fused jazz with rock and later added piquant Latin flavors to expand his stylistic palette. Still recording regularly, Khan is one of the pre-eminent jazz guitarists working today.\n\n30: Lee Ritenour (born 1952)\n\nNicknamed Captain Fingers, LA-born Ritenour recorded with The Mamas & The Papas while still a teenager before becoming an in-demand session ace whose clients included Frank Sinatra, Barry White, and Aretha Franklin. Ritenour\u2019s solo career took off in 1976 when he followed a fusion path that was funkier, lighter, and less grandiose than bands such as Return To Forever. He is also a former member of the influential smooth jazz group Fourplay.\n\n29: Pat Martino (born 1944)\n\nThis Philly axe-meister (born Pat Azzara) is a musical shape-shifter who can switch from straight-ahead jazz to fusion and post-bop at the drop of a plectrum. He served his apprenticeship with soul-jazzers Willis Jackson, Brother Jack McDuff, and Richard \u201cGroove\u201d Holmes before establishing his solo career in the latter half of the 60s. Keen to share his knowledge, Martino has also written textbooks on approaches to guitar playing.\n\nSunny\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n28: Ralph Towner (born 1940)\n\nDespite now sitting comfortably among the world\u2019s best jazz guitarists, the guitar wasn\u2019t Ralph Towner\u2019s first instrument of choice. He began on trumpet, then moved to piano, before finally arriving at the classical guitar, which he studied in Austria for two years. After cutting his teeth with the Paul Winter Consort, in 1970 Towner co-founded Oregon, an all-acoustic band that blended chamber jazz with Eastern sounds and which was a forerunner of New Age music. Though the band is still going strong today, Towner has also enjoyed a fertile solo career, and his striking guitar work \u2013 limpid and crystalline \u2013 remains a thing of beauty.\n\n27: John Abercrombie (1944-2017)\n\nA prolific recording artist for Manfred Eicher\u2019s Munich-based ECM label since the 70s, this native New Yorker cited Chuck Berry and Barney Kessel among his influences. A member of pioneering jazz-rock band Dreams, in the 70s Abercrombie played with the likes of Gil Evans and in supergroup Gateway, while developing a warm, pastel-hued sound that was infused with a melodic lyricism.\n\n26: Bill Frisell (born 1951)\n\nA student of jazz guitar greats Johnny Smith and Jim Hall, Maryland-born Frisell has found his own stylistic niche by blending jazz with elements from country, folk, and rock music. His ability to conjure a particular mood or atmosphere with effects is also part of his signature style. An eclectic, versatile guitarist who has helped expand the boundaries of the instrument.\n\n25: Freddie Green (1911-1987)\n\nHailing from South Carolina, Green was a long-serving stalwart of the Count Basie band and spent almost half a century with the jazz aristocrat. He began on the banjo before graduating to the six-string guitar, and rose to fame in the big band swing era. Rarely taking solos, Greene preferred to help drive the rhythm section by providing a flowing and hard-swinging chordal accompaniment. He wrote the book on big band guitar paying.\n\n24: Herb Ellis (1921-2010)\n\nThere\u2019s a slight but perceptible country twang in the bebop-rooted style of this noted Texas guitarist, who came on the radar of most jazz aficionados due to his indispensable presence in the Oscar Peterson Trio during the 50s. Together with fellow fretboard luminaries Joe Pass, Charlie Byrd, and Barney Kessell, Ellis co-founded a jazz guitar supergroup called The Great Guitars.\n\nCocktails For Two\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n23: Al Di Meola (born 1954)\n\nA veritable fretboard speed king, New Jersey\u2019s Di Meola fused the passionate, fleet-of-finger intensity of flamenco music with the visceral crunch of Santana-esque Latin rock. He was plucked from obscurity at age 19 when he replaced Bill Connors in Chick Corea\u2019s Return To Forever and then went on to forge a successful solo career.\n\n22: Lenny Breau (1941-1984)\n\nFrom Auburn, Maine, and born into a family of country musicians, Breau was a member of his family\u2019s band for several years when he was a teenager, but left after angering his father by playing a jazz-inflected solo. After that, the technically brilliant Breau gravitated towards jazz and also assimilated Flamenco music, which resulted in a distinctive personal style that never forgot its country roots.\n\n21: Mike Stern (born 1953)\n\nBorn Mike Sedgwick in Boston, Stern played in drummer Billy Cobham\u2019s fusion band in the 70s before joining a resurgent Miles Davis on the comeback trail in 1981. After leaving Miles in \u201983, Stern began a solo career that showed him blossoming into an all-round guitarist who can marry the visceral power of blues and rock with jazz\u2019s advanced vocabulary.\n\n20: John Scofield (born 1951)\n\nLike his contemporary Mike Stern, Ohio-born Scofield played fusion with Billy Cobham and then joined a rejuvenated Miles Davis for two years (he was Stern\u2019s replacement). With his acerbic tone and blues-infused string pulls, Scofield developed an immediately recognizable style and has recorded in a breathtaking variety of styles (embracing jam band funk, orchestral jazz, and even country music).\n\nA Go Go\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n19: Charlie Byrd (1925-1999)\n\nA jazz proponent of the acoustic, nylon-stringed, classical guitar, Virginia-born Byrd studied with Spanish master Andre Segovia and then began to make his mark as a recording artist in the late 50s. His biggest mainstream breakthrough was the innovative album Jazz Samba, recorded in tandem with saxophonist Stan Getz in 1962, which fused jazz improv with sinuous Brazilian rhythms and instantly put him on the map as one of the world\u2019s best jazz guitarists. Byrd\u2019s sound, with its finger-picked gossamer filigrees, is a unique one in jazz.\n\n18: Allan Holdsworth (1946-2017)\n\nSomething of a musical polymath, this supernal British jazz guitarist advanced the vocabulary of his instrument by using unusual scales and absorbing elements from progressive rock (including effects pedals). Though he often used ornate finger-picking, he liked to articulate melodies in a smooth, legato style, reflecting his interest in the sound of the saxophone.\n\n17: Larry Coryell (born 1943-2017)\n\nSometimes dubbed The Godfather Of Fusion, Galveston-born Coryell (real name Laurence Van DeLinder III) was Gabor Szabo\u2019s replacement in Chico Hamilton\u2019s band and began to make his name in the late 60s as a proponent of a new musical hybrid called jazz-rock. He led his own fusion band, Eleventh House, in the 70s and later joined forces with John McLaughlin and Paco de Luc\u00eda to form The Guitar Trio. A hugely influential axe god who bridged the divide between jazz and rock, Coryell will forever be remembered as one of the best jazz guitarists to ever pick up the instrument.\n\n16: Jimmy Raney (1927-1995)\n\nTal Farlow\u2019s replacement in the Red Norvo Trio, Kentucky-born Raney branched out as a bandleader in the mid-50s, triumphing in DownBeat magazine\u2019s Best Guitarist polls on two occasions during that time. His eloquent style, with its lucid melodic lines and cool harmonies, won him many fans and his numerous credits include recording stints with Stan Getz, Oliver Nelson, Lalo Schifrin, and Eddie Harris.\n\n15: John McLaughlin (born 1942)\n\nMiles Davis was so smitten with McLaughlin\u2019s guitar playing that he named a song after him (on Bitches Brew). Before that, the Yorkshire-born axe deity made his name as a first-call session musician in London during the 60s when he appeared on myriad pop and R&B records. He played with Tony Williams\u2019 Lifetime before, in the 70s, co-founding the influential jazz fusion supergroup Mahavishnu Orchestra. Combining technical brilliance with emotional depth and a genuine appreciation of Indian music, McLaughlin remains one of the best jazz guitarists in the world, and has led the way in jazz-rock for five decades.\n\n14: Gabor Szabo (1936-1982)\n\nWith his meld of Hungarian Gypsy folk music, extended modal vamps, Indian ragas, and psychedelic coloration, this versatile Budapest-born guitarist exerted a huge influence on Mexican axe god Carlos Santana. His rise to fame was accelerated by his presence in Chico Hamilton\u2019s pathfinding jazz group in the early 60s, before he embarked on a successful solo career.\n\nSan Franciscan Nights\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n13: Johnny Smith (1922-2013)\n\nOriginally from Birmingham, Alabama, Smith was a precociously talented musician who learned to play guitar as a pre-teen while hanging around in local pawnshops. His all-round versatility (he toured with a hillbilly band before gravitating towards jazz and could play anything from swing and bebop to avant-garde classical music) meant that he was much in demand. Smith was also a noted composer: his classic 1954 song \u201cWalk, Don\u2019t Run\u201d became an instrumental standard and was a hit for Chet Atkins and later, in 1964, The Ventures.\n\n12: Stanley Jordan (born 1959)\n\nBack in 1985, this Chicago-born fretboard sorcerer, then just 26, caused a sensation with his Blue Note debut LP, Magic Touch, which showcased Jordan\u2019s remarkably unorthodox technique of playing the guitar by tapping the fingerboard with his fingertips to produce sounds. Such was Jordan\u2019s digital dexterity that, much like a pianist, he could articulate melodies and chords at the same time with both hands. A phenomenal talent who more than earns his place among the world\u2019s best jazz guitarists.\n\n11: Tal Farlow (1921-1998)\n\nNorth Carolinian Talmadge Farlow was a self-taught guitarist who, in his early days, worked as a sign-painter by day and a musician at night. He was inspired to build his first electric guitar himself after hearing Charlie Christian with the Benny Goodman band. His solo career gained pace in the mid-50s and he quickly acquired the nickname The Octopus, which referred to the combination of his large hands and jaw-dropping technical prowess.\n\n10: Pat Metheny (born 1954)\n\nThis chameleonic fretboard sorcerer from Missouri \u2013 whose album credits range from David Bowie and Joni Mitchell to Ornette Coleman \u2013 cites the influence of Wes Montgomery and Jim Hall as key components in the foundation of his own unique style. Lyrical, harmonically rich, and yet also intent on dissolving musical boundaries, Metheny\u2019s shape-shifting music is hard to classify, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him nabbing 20 Grammy awards. Not only one of the best jazz guitarists in history, Metheny is, without doubt, the most progressive guitarist in jazz right now.\n\n9: Joe Pass (1929-1994)\n\nA New Jersey native with Sicilian ancestry, Pass (born Joe Passalaqua) started playing guitar at the age of nine and advanced so rapidly that he was gigging by the time he was 14. A supremely versatile guitarist, he patented a singular and innovative style with which he could articulate melodic lines using deft sequences of chord progressions. Pass spent many years accompanying singer Ella Fitzgerald and also played extensively with pianist Oscar Peterson.\n\nNature Boy\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n8: Kenny Burrell (born 1931)\n\nA go-to sideman as well as being a recording artist in his own right, Detroit-born Burrell drew inspiration from blues music as well as Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt. He started playing guitar at the age of 12 and made his recording debut eight years later with trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. Burrell became a key figure in the hard bop movement and can play soulfully as well as swing hard. His myriad credits range from Sonny Rollins and Donald Byrd to Billie Holiday and Tony Bennett.\n\n7: Barney Kessell (1923-2004)\n\nA member of the 60s LA session mafia dubbed The Wrecking Crew, this guitar master was originally from Tuskegee, Oklahoma, and came to prominence in the 50s, both as a leader and a sideman (he famously accompanied singer Julie London on her 1955 LP, Julie Is Her Name, which featured \u201cCry Me A River\u201d). Fittingly, for one of the best jazz guitarists in history, Kessell played with the great and good of the jazz world (everyone from Billie Holiday to Sonny Rollins) and was noted for his mellow sound and judicious choice of chords.\n\n6: Grant Green (1935-1979)\n\nA prolific recording artist at Blue Note during the 60s and early 70s, St Louis-born Green, who was influenced by bebop horn players, adopted a linear approach to the guitar, favoring single melodic lines over chordal accompaniment. His minimalist, less-is-more aesthetic, with its blues-infused phrasing, was often highlighted within an organ trio setting. A good starting place? Idle Moments.\n\nIdle Moments (Rudy Van Gelder Edition / Remastered 1999)\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n5: George Benson (born 1943)\n\nInfluenced by Charlie Christian and mentored by Wes Montgomery (he\u2019s often considered the latter\u2019s heir apparent \u2013 no finer compliment for any of the world\u2019s best jazz guitarists), this Pittsburgh-born guitar slinger was a child prodigy who became a jazz and soul superstar in the 70s when he reinvented himself as a vocalist. A dexterous fretboardist out of the soul-jazz school, Benson\u2019s calling card is doing a scat vocal while doubling the melody on the guitar. Probably the greatest jazz guitarist alive right now.\n\n4: Jim Hall (1930-2013)\n\nBorn in Buffalo, New York, Ohio-raised Hall started playing guitar aged 10 and had a life-changing epiphany went he first heard Charlie Christian, who had a profound influence on his own style. Noted for his warm, mellow sound, Hall is a master of utilizing space and creating tonal contrasts. He earns his place among the world\u2019s best jazz guitarists thanks to an eclectic choice of collaborators and wide range of musical settings that helped to expanded the lexicon of the jazz guitar.\n\n3: Charlie Christian (1916-1942)\n\nA true jazz guitar revolutionary, Texas-born Christian rose to fame in Benny Goodman\u2019s band during the years 1939-41. He pioneered the electric guitar in jazz, which, combined with his penchant for using single-note lines (like a horn player), took the instrument out of the rhythm section and into the foreground, making it a valid solo instrument. An early proponent of what evolved into bebop, Christian was only 25 when he died, succumbing to tuberculosis.\n\n2: Django Reinhardt (1910-1953)\n\nThe founding father of swing-influenced European \u201chot\u201d jazz in the 30s, this Belgian-born Romani boasted a prodigious technical ability despite only playing with his thumb and two middle fingers (after a fire had left his other two digits on his left hand paralyzed). He was able to combine speed, precision, and a dazzling manual dexterity with imagination and deep feeling. A true jazz giant whose playing never ceases to astonish.\n\n1: Wes Montgomery (1923-1968)\n\nTopping our list of the best jazz guitarists of all time is a revered and profoundly influential Indianapolis fretboard genius who couldn\u2019t read a note of music. Just using a calloused thumb to pick out notes, Montgomery was inspired by the bebop horn-like phrasing of his idol, Charlie Christian, but offered a more advanced harmonic style that incorporated block chords and the use of parallel octaves. He died too young, but his music and its influence lives on.

His unique idiomatic conception to the instrument and the power of his soloing influenced generations of players who followed him; guitar icons such as George Benson, Pat Martino, Larry Coryell, John Scofield, Pat Metheny, Lee Ritenour and Russell Malone.\n\nHistorically, Wes Montgomery\u2019s relatively short career arose in the era after Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt had established the prevailing standard for jazz guitar in the early and mid-twentieth century. Indeed, Wes was heavily influenced by Charlie Christian, in particular. But Wes changed the language of jazz guitar, harmonically, melodically and technically. The way he approached the harmonic structures of tunes, reharmonizing them by implication in the course of his improvisations set the standard for virtually every guitarist who followed him. Typically, in his solos, he outlined chords melodically, but the chords he outlined were often different chords than the rhythm section was playing\u2014a kind of subtle chord substitution\u2014which, in effect, extended the overall harmony in an idiosyncratic way that was unique, distinctive and immediately identifiable. Wes\u2019s compelling harmonic approach, his remarkably fluid single note facility along with his trademark octaves and use of sophisticated chord melodies influenced generations of players who followed in his wake.\n\nMontgomery was self-taught. He devised unconventional techniques that involved, for example, striking the strings exclusively with his right thumb instead of a pick. This unorthodox fingers-on-strings approach allowed him to achieve a warm, round sound on the instrument that was instantly recognizable while his delivery was imbued with deep soul and an irrepressible swing feel that set him apart from most other players of his day.\n\nWhile he emerged on the scene as a solo artist in the late 1950s as a highly regarded exponent of urgently swinging hard bop (later exemplified by such classic recordings as 1960\u2019s The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery, 1962\u2019s Full House and 1965\u2019s Smokin\u2019 at the Half Note), Montgomery had success late in his career as a prominent crossover artist whose pleasingly melodic fare caught on with much larger audiences than has his pure jazz efforts. His later recordings like Bumpin\u2019, California Dreaming, Goin\u2019 Out of My Head and Road Song (all lush productions masterminded by Creed Taylor) served as a jumping-off point for the many pop-oriented jazz guitarists who followed him; guitarists such as Ronnie Jordan, Norman Brown, Peter White, Chieli Minucci and Chuck Loeb.\n\nBorn John Leslie Montgomery on March 6, 1923 in Indianapolis, Indiana, Montgomery picked up guitar at the relatively late age of 19 and began teaching himself how to play by imitating recordings of his idol, Charlie Christian (particularly his ground-breaking single note choruses on \u201cSolo Flight\u201d with the Benny Goodman Orchestra). He played locally at the Club 440 with his brothers Monk on bass and Buddy on piano before touring the Midwest and South with his own group. In 1948, he began a two-year stint with Lionel Hampton\u2019s big band, a band that included Charles Mingus on bass. Returning to his hometown, for a time, Wes had to make music a secondary part of his life, succumbing to the pressures of supporting a large family, which grew to encompass his wife and seven children. While settling down to a grueling factory job by day, he continued playing guitar by night at the Missile Club and often after-hours sessions at local clubs and other venues.\n\nIn 1955, Wes and his brothers began playing regularly around Indianapolis with Sonny Johnson and Alonzo \u201cPookie\u201d Johnson in the Montgomery-Johnson Quintet (documented on the 2015 Resonance Records release In the Beginning). At the end of 1957, the Montgomery brothers, along with a fledgling trumpeter from Indianapolis, Freddie Hubbard, recorded several tunes that were issued on the Pacific Jazz label. A few months later, Wes recorded in Los Angeles with his brothers\u2019 new group, The Mastersounds, although the guitarist continued to be based in his hometown. In September of 1959, Montgomery was discovered by alto sax great and talent scout Cannonball Adderley, who caught the guitarist at the Missile Room and immediately brought word of the phenomenal new talent to Riverside producer Orrin Keepnews, who signed him to the label. Wes\u2019s debut for Riverside, 1959\u2019s A Dynamic New Sound, was an organ trio outing with fellow Indianapolis native Melvin Rhyne on Hammond B-3 and Paul Parker on drums. But it was 1960\u2019s The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery, featuring pianist Tommy Flanagan, bassist Percy Heath and drummer Albert \u201cTootie\u201d Heath, that established Montgomery as the new six-string king and heir to Charlie Christian\u2019s throne.\n\nBetween 1959 and 1963, Keepnews produced a dozen Riverside albums with Montgomery as leader and three others on which he participated as a sideman. Those four years represented Montgomery at his peak. His stints with Verve (1964-1966) and A&M (1967-1968) \u2014 both under the direction of producer Creed Taylor \u2014 were commercially successful (he won a Best Instrumental Jazz Performance Grammy in 1967 for Goin\u2019 Out of My Head), although these efforts were less highly regarded by jazz critics and guitar aficionados than by the general public or by the popular music press.\n\nThe guitar great had just returned home from a national tour when he suddenly died of a heart attack on June 15, 1968 at age 43. Rare recordings of Montgomery\u2019s early years in Indiana, posthumously released on Resonance Records (2012\u2019s Echoes of Indiana Avenue, 2015\u2019s In The Beginning), add significantly to Wes\u2019s rich recorded legacy."}, {"url": "https://artsparksmusic.com/wes-montgomery-generations-of-jazz-guitarists-intimate-his-technique-and-style/", "page_content": "The telling originality and influence of a great innovator in jazz, based on their instrument, technique, and voicing, is often echoed by the number of outstanding musicians of future generations that advance the established style. The signature thumb-based strumming method, soft tone, and octave-chordal sound of Wes Montgomery\u2019s Gibson is instantly recognizable from the opening notes of any recording or performance. From a superb list of accomplished legends on jazz guitar, you can readily hear his overall musical presence: Pat Metheny (listen to Have You Heard), George Benson (listen to Affirmation), Pat Martino (listen to Four on Six) or Kenny Burrell (listen to Billie Jean). Seminal jazz guitarist Joe Pass, often considered in the same breath and at the top of the short list of greatest jazz guitar virtuosos, stated in an interview, \u201cto me, there have been only three real innovators on the guitar\u2014Wes Montgomery, Charlie Christian, and Django Reinhardt.\u201d In many ways, post-Wes Montgomery generations of jazz fans have been hearing his style through some of their favorite contemporary jazz guitarists without making the connection.\n\nBorn in 1923 in Indianapolis, Montgomery would later join his brothers, Buddy and Monk, in their home city, as young men searching for work during the aftermath of the Great Depression. His narrative speaks of hard times, family divorce, and moving to another state \u2013 a profile of poverty experienced profoundly by Black Americans during this period.\n\nBy 1943, Wes and his brothers returned to Indianapolis, and he had already experienced playing his first guitar, a tenor 4-string, purchased for him by his older brother Monk. Montgomery would then be forever changed, in a musical sense, by hearing pioneering American swing and jazz guitarist Charlie Christian on recordings. He would be inspired to buy his first 6-string guitar and practice relentlessly. With his brothers Monk on electric bass and Buddy on piano, jamming sessions began as Montgomery was copying and emulating Christian\u2019s style and signature sound. As a trio, they were beginning to play all around the nightclubs in Indianapolis after working their day jobs.\n\nIn 1948, coming to the attention of bandleader and vibraphone master Lionel Hampton, Montgomery, at 25 years old, would be hired by and begin touring with the Hampton band for two years, at times playing with Charles Mingus, Milt Buckner, and Fats Navarro. Wes\u2019s brothers were enjoying some degree of success with their own band, the Mastersounds, and they invited him to record with them after his stint with Hampton. An exemplary sampling from this group can be found on Fingerpickin\u2019 (Blue Note, 1958).\n\nMontgomery would then be discovered by the upper tier of bandleaders at the forefront of jazz, as word had spread, from nightclub play and recordings with his brothers. He was developing professional attention, as cited in an NPR profile, \u201cCannonball and Nat Adderly were flocking to the Missile Room to witness the new sensation. Riverside Records producer Orrin Keepnews was blown away by Wes\u2019s virtuosity and signed him on for 25 sessions.\u201d Wes\u2019s second album, The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery (Riverside, 1960), earned him Downbeat magazine\u2019s \u201cNew Star\u201d award in 1960.\n\n(npr.org/2007/09/26/14687657/wes-montgomery-the-unmistakeable-jazz-guitar)\n\nThe jazz music critics\u2019 overall reaction, astonishment, and praise for Montgomery\u2019s unique style and technique, after The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery release, has held as a standard measurement of his innovative jazz guitar method. AllMusic critic Michael G. Nastros praised the album, writing: \u201cSetting him apart from the rest, this recording established Montgomery as the most formidable modern guitarist of the era, and eventually its most influential\u2026clearly talented beyond convention, consistently brilliant, and indeed incredible.\u201d\n\nAccording to most jazz critics, Montgomery\u2019s finest recording period includes The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery (Riverside, 1960, Movin\u2019 Along (Concord, 1960), So Much Guitar! (Original Jazz Classic, 1961) and Full House (Riverside, 1961), dating from 1959-1963.\n\nDuring this richly productive period, he also performed and toured with various groups, including his brothers; John Coltrane; Wynton Kelly\u2019s trio, and his own trio. His reputation was being established by listeners, jazz journalists and aficionados, hearing an utterly unique sound on the jazz guitar. Jazz author James Sallis, in his book The Guitar Players (Morrow, 1982), observed, \u201cWhen Wes hit a string you felt it, and it wasn\u2019t just a note, a C-sharp or B-flat, it was part of the story he was telling you.\u201d\n\nAs jazz recordings were in a period of low demand in the mid-\u201860s, and when Riverside Records went bankrupt, Creed Taylor of Verve Records signed the acclaimed guitarist, \u201csteering his career in a different direction.\u201d Several jazz artists had found commercial success with a pop- oriented blend including trumpeter Herb Albert (Taste of Honey), The Ramsey Lewis Trio (The \u2018In\u2019 Crowd) and even Louis Armstrong (Hello Dolly) \u2013 all were rediscovered by a new audience by playing more popularized compositions that could meet radio-play demands. Montgomery\u2019s Goin\u2019 Out of My Head, an R&B cover, crossed over to the popular music charts as well, earning him a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Jazz Performance in 1960.\n\nNow with Verve Records and only producing a few straight jazz albums, the innovations of this stellar stylist had transitioned to the commercial blend of orchestrated renditions of popular songs, including some Beatles\u2019 hits, movie soundtracks, and straight ballads. As stated by music editor Scott Yanow of AllMusic, in his review of Goin Out of My Head, \u201cAccompanied by a wasted all-star big band given dull arrangements by Oliver Nelson, Montgomery mostly sticks to playing themes, even those as dull as \u201cChim Chim Cheree\u201d and \u201cIt Was a Very Good Year.\u201d\n\nThough remaining more mainstream in his recordings in this second phase of his musical career, Montgomery would continue to improvise on solo work during live performances.\n\nHe defended criticism and was aware of growing dissatisfaction in the jazz community with his commercialism. \u201cThere is a jazz concept to what I am doing, but I\u2019m playing popular music and it should be regarded as such.\u201d Unconvinced, there remained disheartened jazz fans and critics alike that felt he had traded his musical integrity for best-selling recordings.\n\n(www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608001780/Wes-Montgomery.html)\n\nHowever, his historical groundbreaking impact on his instrument remains solidly intact. A wide range of testaments from other exceptional jazz guitarists, both contemporaries and current, reaffirm his unprecedented, inventive method and approach. Grammy-award winning \u201880s period smooth jazz guitarist Lee Ritenour, (nicknamed \u201cCaptain Fingers\u201d), a master instrumentalist with fluid and impeccable style, speaks to his idol\u2019s technique: \u201cWes played with his thumb as opposed to a pick, freeing himself from rhythmic constraints and typical phrasing.\u201d Ritenour\u2019s tribute recording Wes Bound (Capital Records, 1993) offers a wonderful mix of renditions of Montgomery compositions as well as originals by Ritenour.\n\nMulti-Grammy Award winning jazz guitarist impresario and bandleader Pat Metheny recalls an early childhood experience, watching Montgomery perform in Kansas City, as he sat at the edge of the stage at the age of 13. \u201c It was unreal, Wes was playing his Gibson L-5, a lot of songs from Verve period \u2013 like Goin\u2019 Out of My Head \u2013 but really stretching out on them. The main impression was\u2026that he made it look so easy \u2013 offhand the way he played physically \u2013 the instrument was sort of a non-issue for him, the music was just kind of flowing out.\u201d\n\n(www.patmetheny.com/qa/questionView.cfm?queID=275)\n\nWes Montgomery died in 1968, but his mark on jazz guitar technique, originality, and a much-emulated style, have become recognized markers, living well beyond him and the evolution he brought to the instrument. He would also contribute significantly, specifically during the \u201860s, to expanding the range of audience from early recordings for jazz aficionados, to a larger general public who did not require a critical understanding of the boundaries between musical genres. In an article for Jazz Journal International (July, 1986), jazz critic Adrian Ingram affirmed, \u201cEven when he was immersed in blatantly commercial surroundings, Montgomery never lost his ability to create sophisticated, tasteful jazz. He could turn tap water into vintage wine, though it is sad he was forced to do so, so often.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://newyorkjazzworkshop.com/wes-montgomery-1925-1968/", "page_content": "A brief profile of the great Wes Montgomery (1925-1968)\n\nFifty years ago in 1968 the world lost Wes Montgomery. His playing and revolutionary ideas are ingrained into the fabric of jazz guitar, but at the time there was simply nothing like his approach and he was the most significant innovator since Charlie Christian. Despite the landscape filled with great guitarists like Jimmy Raney, Tal Farlow, Barney Kessel and Kenny Burrell, Montgomery\u2019s style has been the formative template for players like the late Emily Remler, George Benson, Pat Metheny, Lee Ritenour, and popular smooth jazz guitarists such as the late Ronny Jordan and Norman Brown. Montgomery also enjoyed tremendous cross over success with his Verve recordings (1964-1966) and for A&M/CTI (1967-1968).\n\nBorn John Leslie Montgomery on March 6, 1925 in Indianapolis, he was self taught. He picked up the guitar at the age of 19, being able to imitate the solos of Charlie Christian from his favorite recordings. The guitarist played with his brothers, vibraphonist Buddy and pioneer of the electric bass, Monk at the 440 club. While holding a day job, at night the guitarist would play clubs around town such as the Missile Lounge and in 1957 recorded a Pacific Jazz date with his brothers and a then unknown trumpeter on the rise, Freddie Hubbard.\n\nIn 1959, the guitarist signed with Orrin Keepnews\u2019 Riverside records where he would remain until 1964 where he recorded 12 albums including the classics The Incredible Jazz Guitar (1960) Bags Meets Wes with vibraphonist Milt Jackson (1961), the precursor to his future commercial successes at Verve, Fusion! The Incredible Guitar of Wes Montgomery with Strings (1962) and the classic Full House: Recorded Live At Tsubo a live club date in Berkeley, California with Johnny Griffin on tenor, and the ex Miles Davis rhythm section of Wynton Kelly, piano; Paul Chambers, bass; and Jimmy Cobb, drums. The Riverside albums showcased Montgomery as a fearless improviser who also had a strong melodic approach. In 1964, he signed with Verve where the idea was to present him to a wider audience beyond jazz. Creed Taylor, who previously worked at Bethlehem, and Impulse! where he signed John Coltrane produced Movin Wes featuring the guitarist with a large big band playing Johnny Pate\u2019s arrangements. The approach of presenting him in front of a big band playing concise solos and strong focus on melody was very similar to what Taylor was doing with Jimmy Smith\u2019s Verve albums at the same time. The following year Smokin\u2019 At The Half Note a half live, half studio affair was purely small group with the Kelly/Chambers/Cobb rhythm section offering peerless support behind the guitarist\u2019s stretching out. The album is widely considered to be the best of Montgomery\u2019s recordings that Pat Metheny has famously called \u201cthe greatest jazz guitar album ever made\u201d. In 1966, the guitarist joined forces with Jimmy Smith for two albums which rank with some of the best music of their careers.\n\nIn 1967 Taylor reached an agreement with A&M to start his own subsidiary, CTI which eventually would become independent in 1970 and one of the most significant jazz labels in history. Montgomery recorded A Day In The Life (1967), Down Here On The Ground and Road Song (1968). The three albums rankled jazz purists to no end not only due to the fact they were some of his most successful recordings, but because they featured a minimum of improvisation, regardless of the fact it was there in spots. In truth, the approach was not all that different from albums like Goin\u2019 Out Of My Head (Verve, 1966) just grander with large orchestral backdrops like french horns and strings. A Day In The Life reached number one on the Billboard Jazz chart. The albums were predecessors to the smooth jazz genre and should be viewed as marvels of melodic invention. Suddenly on June 15th, 1968, the guitar giant was gone after he suffered a heart attack.\n\nIn 2012 Resonance records released Echoes Of Indiana Avenue comprised of early recordings of the guitarist\u2019s early years in Indiana. The release sent shock waves of anticipation in the jazz community as there had not been any \u201cnew\u201d music from the guitarist in more than forty years. Resonance\u2019s series of Montgomery releases have done much to add to his recorded legacy, particularly with the January 2018 release of In Paris: The Definitive ORTF Recording. The album marks the first official release from his only European tour directly after being bootlegged for many years from inferior sources. The 2 CD recording ranks as one of the best sessions of Montgomery\u2019s available. In some ways the level of inspiration from the tracks with Johnny Griffin added to the band with the guitarist, and the rhythm team of Harold Mabern, piano; Arthur Harper, bass; and Jimmy Lovelace, drums helps nearly supersede the Half Note recording. It\u2019s proof Wes Montgomery\u2019s spirit is ever present and never will be forgotten.\n\nIf you enjoy the music of Wes Montgomery and are an aspiring guitarist or maybe just hoping to get your chops up, the New York Jazz Workshop offers courses in guitar, an improvisation with a worrld classic faculty including Vic Juris and Kenny Wessel.

Basically, he's the one that changed both the mentality of players that followed AND the way the instrument is played. It's hard to hear anything \"Jazz Guitar\" and not associate with a hint of Wes Montgomery behind it! He came right after Charlie Christian and he's considered by many to be the logical sequel in jazz guitar history.\n\nWes was in fact very much inspired and influenced by Christian's playing. It is said that early on, Wes was actually hired to play Christian's solos during live concerts! He learned them all (by ear... Wes was not a reader) to the point that the vinyls started to disintegrate. That's the spirit! (-:\n\nIn the end, both Montgomery and Christian contributed to the then new bebop language with great tones, rhythms, dexterity and soulfulness. Wes always had fresh, surprising melodic ideas as well a great chops. He never read a single note on paper but his ears and heart guided him dearly. Watch him on video, you'll understand!\n\nWes Montgomery is now part of this great tradition and still has an influence on young jazz guitarists. His music is worth studying carefully. Most (if not all) jazz guitarists that came after cite Wes as an influence. It's hard not to...\n\nThe great Pat Metheny goes further and says: \"Wes and Miles, [...] the two guys who have left a sonic residue that has pervaded all of music, not just jazz.\" It's true. When listening to both of these masters, we almost hear the conscious \"edition\" that is going on in their musical minds: they leave out all the extra notes and keep only the essential... We know that Wes was a HUGE perfectionist, perpetually disatisfied with his solos... keeping only \"the good stuff in\" take after the take in the studio.\n\nMy favorite recordings of Wes are on the Riverside label. They are small group performances that are very much in the bebop (and post-bop) idioms. I love Wes' playing in quartets and organ trios. Such groovy stuff!\n\nPlaying Style and Gear\n\nWes used a Gibson L-5 throughout his career. It is a hollow-body carved-top (spruce top, maple back and sides) guitar and it was plugged into very clean sounding amplifiers. Gibson still produces a replica of the guitar Wes used to play. (-:\n\nWes' sound is totally unique and original. He never liked the \"noise\" of the pick striking the strings. That is why he started plucking strictly with the fleshy part of his right thumb. That is perhaps, one of the most imitated sound in the jazz guitar world. If you've never tried it, take 10 minutes and experiment with just the thumb, it's addictive!\n\nAnother technique that gave Wes his personal sound is the use of octaves. He would play in and out of octave playing in most of his solos. That too is a sound that's always imitated. However, in its first experimentation with octaves, Wes was discouraged by his colleages. They said it was \"piano stuff\" ... go figure! (-:\n\nIn summary, his signature sound opened the way for future generations. The use of the thumb and octave playing was revolutionary at the time. It is now in widespread use!

He was known for his distinctive playing style, which involved using his thumb instead of a pick, resulting in a warm, mellow tone that was instantly recognizable.\n\nMontgomery began playing the guitar at an early age, and by the time he was in his teens, he was already performing professionally. He played in a number of local bands before forming his own group, the Montgomery Brothers, with his brothers Monk and Buddy.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Montgomery signed with the Riverside record label and released a series of albums that established him as one of the most innovative and influential guitarists in jazz. These albums, which included \u201cThe Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery\u201d and \u201cFull House,\u201d showcased Montgomery\u2019s virtuosity and creativity and helped to popularize jazz guitar as a solo instrument.\n\nMontgomery\u2019s playing style, which involved using his thumb to pluck the strings instead of a pick, was a departure from the traditional jazz guitar approach and gave him a unique sound that was both smooth and soulful. He was also known for his use of octaves, which he used to great effect in his solos.\n\nSadly, Montgomery\u2019s life was cut short when he died of a heart attack in 1968 at the age of 45. However, his legacy lives on through his music and his influence on generations of guitarists who followed in his footsteps.\n\nMontgomery\u2019s innovative approach to jazz guitar helped pave the way for future generations of guitarists, and his influence can be heard in the playing of musicians such as George Benson, Pat Metheny, and John Scofield. He was inducted into the DownBeat Jazz Hall of Fame in 1972 and continues to be regarded as one of the greatest jazz guitarists of all time.\n\nHow Did Wes Montgomery Get His Tone?\n\nWes Montgomery was known for his unique guitar tone, which is still widely admired and emulated today. His tone was characterized by a warm, round sound, with a singing sustain and a natural compression that allowed his notes to ring out clearly and evenly.\n\nThere are several factors that contributed to Montgomery\u2019s distinctive tone. One of the most important was his use of his thumb instead of a pick to pluck the strings. This allowed him to achieve a smooth, flowing sound with a consistent attack, which helped to create his signature sustain.\n\nAnother key aspect of Montgomery\u2019s tone was his use of a technique called \u201coctave playing.\u201d This involves playing a melody note and its octave simultaneously, which creates a full, rich sound. Montgomery would often use this technique to play chords, creating a lush, harmonic texture.\n\nMontgomery also favored a hollow-bodied guitar, which added to his warm, resonant tone. He played primarily on a Gibson L-5CES, which had a deep, mellow sound that complemented his playing style.\n\nFinally, Montgomery\u2019s tone was also influenced by his use of amplifiers and effects. He favored a Polytone amplifier, which had a clean, transparent sound that allowed his guitar to shine through. He also used a delay pedal, which added a subtle echo to his notes, further enhancing their sustain and richness."}], "Brian Hughes began playing guitar at the age of nine": [{"url": "https://www.wikilogy.com/biography/brian-hughes/", "page_content": "Brian Hughes is an American guitarist who has played with a variety of artists, including Melissa Etheridge, Lyle Lovett, and Chris Isaak.

In 1992, when Loreena was nominated for a Juno Award as producer on The Visit, Brian was also nominated as co-producer for his work on the album. He also mixed her 2012 Grammy-nominated Troubadours on the Rhine.\n\nThe Visit won a Juno Award for Best Roots & Traditional Album and is the recording that propelled Loreena onto the international stage.\n\nAn accomplished guitarist/composer/producer, Brian has been described as \u201cunclassifiable\u201d and \u201cgenre busting\u201d. He has built a successful career of his own, recording nine jazz albums, most of them released under his own record label Sylvan House Music and available through his website. Over the years, he\u2019s earned a string of accolades, including winning SOCAN\u2019s Jazz and Instrumental Composer of the Year Award seven times. \u201cIt\u2019s really great when you get acknowledged \u2013 it\u2019s a little notch in your belt, but then you move on,\u201d he says.\n\nSo where did it all start?\n\n\u201cI was around 14 or 15 and I was only dabbling in guitar really. I\u2019d be walking home from school having these fantasies about being on stage in Edmonton or Vancouver playing for 20,000 people. I guess it kinda worked out,\u201d he laughs.\n\nBorn in Alberta, Canada, Brian moved to Los Angeles in 2000 to pursue opportunities in the robust jazz community there. Through the decades his music has been influenced by everyone from Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix to Talking Heads and jazz great Wes Montgomery. When he was a teenager, his friend\u2019s sister was into Celtic music and that\u2019s where he heard it first. \u201cWhen I did that 15-minute section of the Toronto concert with Loreena in 1987 as soon as she started playing I knew all the parts would come together, that I could move my jazz and rock sensibility into the music.\u201d\n\nBrian\u2019s main instrument is guitar, but he also plays the oud, bouzouki and the balalaika. He has toured with The Chieftains, produced and mixed international platinum-selling albums for several prominent Greek recording artists, appeared with Loreena on The Late Show with David Letterman, and the title track from his album Shakin\u2019 Not Stirred was featured in an episode of the popular television series Sex and the City.\n\nBrian has also joined creative forces with two other long-standing members of Loreena\u2019s band: cellist/singer Caroline Lavelle and violinist Hugh Marsh in a project dubbed Secret Sky. Four years ago, they released their first CD by the same name. Despite living in three different countries, they were able to stitch together the music remotely thanks to Brian\u2019s production skills, the advancements in home recording technology and as Brian puts it, \u201cwith a lot of back and forthing\u201d. He describes the album as having \u201cthe passionate feel reminiscent of some of the expansive, filmic albums of the \u201870s\u201d. To the layperson, it may seem like a strange way to make a record, but it\u2019s become increasingly common and easier to produce.\n\n\u201cWith Loreena\u2019s albums we had the luxury of all being in the same room. That way, you have the opportunity to pick up on the vibes of other musicians and work off each other,\u201d says Brian. \u201cBut both ways have their benefits.\u201d\n\nNow, with The Visit: The Definitive Edition, Brian is looking back 30 years to the time of the original recording in 1991. Three decades is a long time and he admits his brain is \u201ca bit fuzzy\u201d, but there are some things that are etched in his memory.\n\nHis girlfriend at the time, Pamela (now his wife of 27 years), had an apartment in Toronto back then where her brother\u2019s balalaika hung on the wall. He\u2019d won it as a prize for best costume on a cruise when he was 12 (dressed as a chicken). One day while working on The Visit, Brian took the balalaika off the wall and started playing. When Loreena heard the instrument, she felt it belonged in the musical imagery of \u201cThe Lady of Shalott\u201d, and so it made its way into the recording.\n\n\u201cThey were pretty intense studio sessions and we were at it every day,\u201d recalls Brian. \u201cLoreena\u2019s more of a morning person and I\u2019m more of an evening person, but it all worked out. The sessions were a lot of fun. We were big on textures and ambient sounds and we had these wonderful tribal drum sounds, Middle Eastern percussion and great fiddling.\u201d\n\nLoreena has her own special memories from the time and of working with Brian. \u201cIt\u2019s been great to have Brian\u2019s support all these years, in the studio and on the road. In addition to being able to travel the world while performing, we\u2019ve also had some great times, great meals and some really great laughs. I remember one time when we were recording at Real World Studios and I was auditioning musicians. Out of fun, I put little coloured dots on my forehead and I would add to them as the day went on. Before each of the musicians would come in to play for me, Brian would mention to them that I had this odd fascination with putting dots on my forehead. But he cautioned them to please, whatever they do, don\u2019t say anything when they met me. The musician would politely come into the studio and we\u2019d work with them playing a few tracks, all the while suspecting how whacky they must have thought I was. When the day was over, we had a great laugh over how considerate and respectful everyone had been, though likely privately wondering \u2018what was up with her\u2019!\u201d\n\nBrian too has some funny memories from The Visit. \u201cI can remember Loreena saying to me, \u2018Brian, give me a drag of your cigarette\u2019, then it would go to her head and she\u2019d have to lie down on the sofa for 20 minutes.\u201d\n\nThese days, Brian and his wife Pamela divide their time between L.A. and their hacienda in Mexico. Since the pandemic put the kibosh on live performances of all kinds, they\u2019ve been working on their place in Mexico and \u201cdoing a lot of dog walking\u201d.\n\nAnd of course, he\u2019s dreaming again of performing in front of thousands of people someday soon.\n\nBrian Hughes on Spotify\n\nBrian Hughes Best Of on Spotify\n\nBrian Hughes on AppleMusic\n\nwww.brianhughes.com\n\nSecret Sky on Spotify\n\nSecret Sky on AppleMusic\n\nwww.secretskymusic.com\n\nWritten by Diane Sewell, a career journalist for more than 30 years.

Bryan\u2019s focus is on revitalizing sounds from the past into music unbound by generation or musical genre. His songs are composed to ignite feeling, vibrate the soul, and move through time in order to connect the listener to long forgotten memories or an unimagined future.\n\nIn the early 1990\u2019s, Bryan moved to New York City to pursue a career in music. His style evolved as he worked with experienced artists from varying backgrounds and musical genres. He was fortunate to write with smooth jazz artists of the time such as George Jinda and Chieli Minucci of Special Effects. He also had the great fortune of working with Earnie Lake, Bobby Guy and Hex Hexter of Soul Solutions \u2013 three of the biggest remixers of the 2000\u2019s. Bryan also befriended Christoph Spendel, with whom he enjoys a lifelong friendship and who gave Bryan his first writing credits on the smooth jazz CD Out of Town, released in 1995. These experiences helped refine Bryan\u2019s arrangement and production skills.\n\nThrough years of playing, exposure to the music industry, and working relationships with expert musicians, Bryan cultivated his own artistic style, refined his lyric and music compositions, and progressed to working on his own music. Notably and simultaneously, he continued to play in numerous original bands with other musicians trying to make a mark in the NYC club scene. Like other committed musicians at the time, Bryan\u2019s typical Friday or Saturday evening consisted of one-hour sets in three separate venues including popular clubs such as CBGB\u2019s, the Bitter End, Cafe Wa, and the Bottom Line. This era marked a great time in Bryan\u2019s life during which he enjoyed playing and preforming live while gaining valuable experiences and insights from and with a wide variety of musicians.\n\nWanting to return to his roots, Bryan moved back to Florida to embark on a solo project, allowing him to apply acquired skills and to explore new ideas. Through a collaborative partnership with Scott Rogness who wrote \u201cThat Thing you Do\u201d, which was featured in a movie of the same name, Bryan released his CD The Distance in the spring of 2008. Bryan and his writing partner Howard Kleinfeld were competitively selected to score the TV series Will to Live and, later, the 2013 made for television movie It Was Him or Me.\n\nHaving developed a knack for writing and arranging songs and jingles, Bryan felt compelled to return to his love of singing. He formed a jazz trio in the Tampa Bay area. Focusing on the music that had influenced him from an early age, he dove into the American Song Book titles and began performing at local jazz clubs. As he gained recognition and his popularity grew, Bryan was soon recruited to front jazz orchestras including Helios, Summit, and the Sarasota Jazz Orchestra. These performances allowed him to further perfect his voice and carve out a niche for his talent."}, {"url": "https://www.folkandhoney.co.uk/all-our-uk-gigs/brian-hughes-a3697/", "page_content": "Edit Artist\n\nFolk Bands and Artists\n\nBrian Hughes\n\nBrian Hughes began playing traditional Irish music at a very young age, in his home town of Athy Co Kildare.

Hughes\u2019s family moved to Washington, DC when he was nine years old. His father, who worked for the Bureau of Engraving, began playing the trombone, and performed in the Elks Club marching band. After attending rehearsals and marching band gigs with his dad, Hughes began playing the trombone at the age of 12 or 13.\n\nHis musical skills progressed rapidly, so much so that by 16 he was jamming at a jazz venue called the 7T Club\ufffd\u201dit was located at 7th and T Street. There he played with many great musicians, including his friend Frank Wess. During his last year in high school, his father took him to New York, where in 1947 or \u201948 he saw the Count Basie band live for the first time. Although he had heard the band on the radio, this live performance mesmerized him. Although he loved playing music, he didn\u2019t think that he would become a professional musician, especially after marrying his college sweetheart. He thought becoming a pharmacist would be his ticket to career stability, so he graduated from the Howard University School of Pharmacy in 1952. Hughes began working at the National Institute of Health under the direction of Dr. Arnold W. Pratt. Interestingly, Dr. Pratt would have the staff take breaks in which they would sight sing! By this time, Hughes was raising a family with his beloved wife Delores.\n\nBut in 1953, he got what he described as \u201cThe Call.\u201d At the time, Hughes was still jamming with musicians in DC clubs such as the Howard Theater, and was noted for his prowess at swinging. His homeboy Frank Wess was performing with the renowned Count Basie Orchestra and had told the Count about Hughes when a need surfaced for another brass player for the trombone section. When Basie called and said that he had heard about him, and wanted him to come to try out for the band, Hughes thought it was a prank call. He hung up without committing to audition. Basie called right back for confirmation, and Hughes realized that it was actually the great man himself!\n\nSo he joined the Count Basie Orchestra in September 1953. Around this same time Hughes was also invited to join the Duke Ellington Orchestra but chose Basie where he would be more comfortable with friends like Frank, Eddie Jones and Benny Powell."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/brian-hughes-musician", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nBrian Hughes was born on 5 May, 1955 in Vegreville, Canada, is a Musician, composer, producer.

With influences ranging from Robben Ford to Steve Vai, his music is extremely tasty, yet never predictable.

He has studied music at the University of Nebraska and most recently, at the University of Maine, where he completed his Bachelor's degree in Jazz and Contemporary Music. Hughes has played live throughout the New England area with a variety of rock and top-40 bands. Hughes credits further development as a player and a composer to his private lessons with Bob Thompson, a top studio guitarist..\n\nOne of Hughes main goals is to draw on his many influences outside of the rock idiom and assimilate them into a style of his own, stressing his uniqueness as a composer and player. Other goals include more original recordings, studio work and perhaps joining an established band.
