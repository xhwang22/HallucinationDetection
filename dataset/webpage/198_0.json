Tisci\u2019s critics have argued that he failed to make the most of Burberry\u2019s British heritage and there was a sense of disconnect between his designs and the brand\u2019s history.\n\nTisci leaves less than a year after the man who brought him in, Gobbetti, departed; he was replaced by a Briton, Jonathan Akeroyd. The changing of the guard also includes the long-term finance head, Julie Brown, who, it was announced earlier this week, is moving to the drug group GSK.\n\nTisci brought a streetwear aesthetic to Burberry, which helped re-energise its brand image and attract a younger, more diverse and fashion-conscious set of customers.\n\nHis exit had long been rumoured since Gobbetti left. The gossip reached a crescendo at Burberry\u2019s London fashion week show on Monday, with insiders pointing out that the contract Tisci signed when he was appointed was about to expire.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Impressively, the designer crafted distinct brand identities for all of Givenchy\u2019s product categories across women\u2019s and men\u2019s ready-to-wear and haute couture lines. At Burberry, he lifted sales after faltering period, and revamping the company's brand identity.\n\nTisci grew up in a tight-knit, single-parent, working-class family in Italy. The designer describes his family life as hugely influential on him and remembers his childhood as one filled with love. Tisci left regular school aged 11 to enroll in art school in Milan. \u201cI wanted to express myself and I couldn't really do it through words at that point,\" he told The Daily Telegraph. The designer was selected for a scholarship by Central Saint Martins, from which he graduated in 1999. He then held design positions at Puma, Antonio Berardi and with Ruffo Research, before embarking on his own brand in 2004. As a result of his bold, powerfully-feminine designs, Tisci was announced as the creative director of Givenchy\u2019s womenswear and haute couture lines in 2005. After announcing his amicable departure from the house in February 2017 with a subsequent sabbatical, Tisci was named chief creative officer at Burberry in March 2018, succeeding Christopher Bailey .\n\nTisci\u2019s creations found willing consumers immediately; the designer\u2019s vision for Givenchy initially found traction with consumers rather than editors. In just two years Tisci had revitalised the house\u2019s couture business. He chose to stop showing couture in 2012, taking the business behind the scenes in-house once more.\n\nIn May 2008 he was appointed chief designer of menswear and menswear accessories in addition to his womenswear role. His menswear collections have received rampant critical acclaim and caused the formation of tribe-like followers, many of whom, such as Kanye West, are very much in the public eye. Tisci\u2019s marriage of streetwear influences, Parisian sensibilities and global motifs made Givenchy\u2019s printed sweatshirts a fashion staple, as well as broadening the brand\u2019s appeal exponentially.\n\nFollowing over a decade of experience at the creative helm of Givenchy, Tisci transitioned to Burberry, an announcement that sent share prices soaring by over 5 percent. Joining Marco Gobetti a second time, who also joined Burberry as its chief executive following a stint at Givenchy, Tisci took on plans to reinvigorate product and consumer experiences and expand Burberry's first venture into high end streetwear after a partnership with Gosha Rubchinsky in 2018. Under Tisci's watch, both Burberry's London flagship location and it's monogram logo underwent a revamp, the latter of which debuted with a series of international pop-up installations featuring the new Peter Saville -designed Burberry logo. Following the highly anticipated first Spring/Summer 2019 collection and logo redesign, Burberry reported a 4 percent rise in first quarter comparable store sales in 2019."}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-burberrys-riccardo-tisci-survived-his-tough-italian-childhood-to-become-a-fashion-superstar-j703sbdg0", "page_content": "Riccardo Tisci is the chief creative officer of Burberry and former creative director of Givenchy. His closest friends include Kim Kardashian, Madonna and the artist Marina Abramovic. He has four homes and 2.5 million Instagram followers. And every Christmas he treats his family to a glamorous holiday. Recent destinations have included Paris and Rome, and the trips usually involve a devotional element \u2013 a visit to the Vatican, or midnight Mass in Notre Dame cathedral \u2013 as a treat for Tisci\u2019s devoutly Catholic 90-year-old mother, Elmerinda.\n\nWhatever the location, there is one ritual that is always honoured: Tisci, his eight older sisters and his mother will gather to watch Little Lord Fauntleroy on DVD, or Il Piccolo Lord as it is known in Italy; a film about an impoverished American boy whose father has died and who unexpectedly comes into a fortune. \u201cIn Italy they always used to show this movie on December 25 and, imagine for us, we were poor, watching this movie,\u201d he says. \u201cSo me and my sisters \u2013 the husbands, they leave \u2013 all sit with my mum and we cry. I love that movie.\u201d\n\nCorset top, \u00a3990, dress, \u00a315,500, earrings, \u00a3350, shoes, \u00a3570; Bodysuit, \u00a3590, blazer, \u00a31,790, skirt, \u00a3450, all Burberry PHOTOGRAPHS BY LUIGI AND IANGO; STYLING BY PRUE WHITE; MODELLED BY FRAN SUMMERS\n\nTisci and I are on the top floor of Burberry HQ in Pimlico, London, in a penthouse-style meeting room clad in cream marble and pale wood. It is evening, the sky black beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows, a balcony door propped open so that Tisci can smoke without setting off the fire alarm. I\u2019ve been asked if I mind about the smoking \u2013 I don\u2019t \u2013 and given a blanket to stop my knees getting chilly.\n\nTisci, 45, is wearing matching grey Carhartt WIP tracksuit bottoms and top. \u201cIt is very strange for me to have so many colours,\u201d he says, and there is indeed a tiny flash of yellow amid the soft grey. He normally wears black jeans, a T-shirt (usually black, but sometimes white or grey) and trainers. This was the look that he assumed when he arrived in London from Como, aged 17, penniless and barely able to speak English. \u201cPeople who have known me for a long time are taking the piss out of me, because they are, like, \u2018My God, he is never going to change,\u2019 \u201d Tisci says, laughing. But this is an unfair observation. His life has involved huge personal transformation, which has indeed been reflected in his clothes, just not always the ones he wears.\n\nRiccardo Tisci LUIGI AND IANGO\n\nRiccardo was Elmerinda and Francesco Tisci\u2019s ninth child, his father\u2019s longed-for boy. \u201cUnluckily, four years after I was born, he went away,\u201d he says. It is interesting that Tisci uses this language to describe his father\u2019s death, because this is what his mother told him, to try to protect her son from the pain of what had really happened. \u201cShe always told me that Dad was coming back. I found out later when I went to school. The kids were, like, \u2018I think your father is never going to come back.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe family struggled, financially and emotionally. Tisci remembers that he and his sisters used to sleep together on a mattress on the floor; he remembers wearing hand-me-downs, his mother stitching down a flared shoulder on a girl\u2019s jumper for him; he remembers being sent to stay with aunts in the south of Italy when there wasn\u2019t enough money to feed him and starting working aged eight, just as his sisters worked, so they could contribute to the bills. He doesn\u2019t remember his father, who sold fruit, \u201cnot even one second\u201d. The only memory he has is of the domed chocolates with a delicate sponge filling that Francesco used to bring back from trips to Switzerland to buy gasoline.\n\nTisci and his mother, Elmerinda\n\nYet it is a childhood that Tisci remembers with huge fondness and gratitude. \u201cMy family always filled me with love. My mum always made us laugh and smile. She said, \u2018Never judge anybody, we are all the same.\u2019 Every Sunday we would go to church. We were the poor ones, but my mum was, like, \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter if people are going to look at you or laugh at you, we are together.\u2019 So we used to be the first ones to arrive, looking like a mess, sitting in front. She used to be so proud.\u201d\n\nTisci didn\u2019t dream of being an internationally f\u00eated fashion designer. He hoped only that one day he might be able to earn enough money to help his family. He was shy and introverted, happiest gardening with his mother, drawing or making collages from the fashion magazines that his sisters brought home from the hairdressing salon where they worked. He didn\u2019t like talking to people he didn\u2019t know, and as he grew older (and taller than any of his siblings or classmates, which put an end to any bullying) he became obsessed with performers such as Nina Hagen and David Bowie. \u201cPeople who wore masks. I was trying to find my mask.\u201d\n\nHe began to understand that the clothes he wore, the image he projected, could be his protection. He grew his hair long, dressed in black and wore platform shoes. \u201cI was the only goth in town. On the bus to school everyone would literally move away from me.\u201d But he made friends at art college, where he went aged 15, and in the nightclubs where he was paid to dance. After a wild three-day trip to London with a friend, he decided to move to the UK, to try to build a different life for himself, away from the struggles and small-mindedness of smalltown Italy at that time. He spent a summer making money for the move, taking the midnight shift cleaning floors in a canning factory and a job as an assistant at an undertaker\u2019s. \u201cMy mum was so sad, but she was so happy for me, because she could see that I was going to try to change my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a long time I couldn\u2019t talk about my father, or about who I was, without being scared of being judged. Now I can be proud of who I am\u201d LUIGI AND IANGO\n\nSponsored\n\nThe easy anarchy of London in the late Eighties and early Nineties suited Tisci; it was a whirl of bedsits and nightclubs, dawn raves and multiple menial jobs. Tisci\u2019s nostalgia for the wild energy of this time was one of the reasons that he was excited to accept the role at Burberry. He wanted to return to the city that had played such a pivotal role in his life, a place that he equates with \u201cfreedom, eccentricity, elegance, royalty, punk. Britain is the only country in the world where you have the Queen and you have the skinhead, where you have the rebellion and you have the establishment.\u201d\n\nEven now, after a year and half in the job, living in a small rented flat in Mayfair, successfully merging his reckless romantic aesthetic with that of the historic British brand, he still he gets goose-bumps every time his driver unexpectedly takes him past one of his old haunts. \u201cRecently I passed the club that used to be Trade. Now it is a restaurant. The car stopped and I got tears in my eyes.\u201d\n\nBy his early twenties Tisci was working as a supervisor at Accessorize in Covent Garden during the week and as the manager of Monsoon in Richmond at the weekend, partying the rest of the time. \u201cI was the happiest person in the world, I didn\u2019t need anything more, I was young, having fun. I was calling my mum one time a week.\u201d And then he saw an advert in The Big Issue for free courses at the London College of Fashion. There his work was soon spotted by Priyesh Shah, the business partner of the designer Antonio Berardi, who invited Tisci to work at their London studio as an assistant. \u201cAntonio really opened the world to me of a lot of things like tailoring and sexiness and freedom.\u201d He also encouraged Tisci to apply for a place at Central Saint Martins, for which he was awarded a scholarship. Tisci was bumped into the second year because his sketchbooks were so impressive.\n\nTrench coat, \u00a32,490, corset top, \u00a31,990, skirt, \u00a3450, bag, \u00a31,290, shoes \u00a3570, all Burberry PHOTOGRAPHS BY LUIGI AND IANGO; STYLING BY PRUE WHITE; MODELLED BY FRAN SUMMERS\n\nAt first he was confused by the indifference of the tutors, but soon he found their hands-off approach liberating, because it enabled him to shed the constraints of his background, culture and religion. \u201cThose two years made everything that was impossible possible in my head \u2013 you want to write \u2018fuck off\u2019 on a T-shirt, you do it. You want to be dark, to be sexual, you do it.\u201d Tisci responded to the opportunity by working with the relentless intensity for which he is known, producing 25 sketchbooks when only two had been asked for, his confidence buoyed by good grades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the mining of the self required by the work brought up all sorts of emotions and memories. \u201cSo then it came out: all my childhood, the missing of my father.\u201d His sketchbooks were full of \u201cdarkness and romance\u201d, gothic visions, broken dolls, urbanity and decadence. It was a very personal aesthetic, but one that resonated with a wider public and led, ultimately, to his job at Givenchy aged only 30.\n\nTisci brought a slouchy, restless glamour to Givenchy, in shades of pale peach, muted rose and, of course, black. He remained at Givenchy for 13 years, increasing the brand\u2019s revenue, its number of couture clients and its visibility through the endorsement of friends such as the Kardashians and Kanye West. So it was a surprise when he announced that he was stepping down without another job lined up. \u201cPeople think that I took a sabbatical from Givenchy, but no, I took a sabbatical from life,\u201d he explains. \u201cI started work very young, and the biggest goal was to give joy to my family, I didn\u2019t expect my success.\u201d Furthermore, at Givenchy, he \u201calways felt like I was under exam, so it was intense\u201d.\n\nIt was during one of the most intense times \u2013 fashion week \u2013 that he learnt that the husband of his sister Lucrezia had died \u201cvery young\u201d of cancer.\n\nDress, corset dress and shoes, POA, Burberry; top, \u00a3490, shirt, \u00a3550, skirt \u00a3690, Burberry PHOTOGRAPHS BY LUIGI AND IANGO; STYLING BY PRUE WHITE; MODELLED BY FRAN SUMMERS\n\n\u201cI flew to Italy. At the funeral I was sitting on the first row with my mum. I looked at her hands and saw the hands of this old lady. Then I saw my sisters\u2019 kids and I realised that they were not kids any more, they were adults. I was, like, \u2018OK, wait a second.\u2019 It was a dream, I am very blessed, but I cannot miss this time. After the funeral I went back to Paris and told them that I was leaving.\u201d Tisci spent the next 18 months taking his mother on dream holidays and relaxing in his home in Paris. \u201cGoing to the gym maybe two hours a day, reading, going to a museum, things that had been impossible for me. That was luxury.\u201d\n\nAnd then the call came from Marco Gobbetti, the man who had hired Tisci at Givenchy and \u201cthe man that took the place of a father for me\u201d. Gobetti had been the chief executive of Burberry since 2017 and knew precisely who he wanted when Christopher Bailey stood down. \u201cRiccardo has a very strong creative instinct,\u201d Gobbetti says. \u201cHe continually strives to push boundaries, to explore the open spaces of what\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nBurberry was founded in 1856 by Thomas Burberry, a 21-year-old gentleman\u2019s outfitter from Basingstoke who went on to invent gabardine, a lightweight fabric that would protect people from the soggy English climate. Polar explorers and hot-air balloonists wore his designs and in 1912 the iconic trench coat was designed to keep British officers dry during the First World War. It is a brand with an incredible heritage and history, one that resonates with Britishness, but also one that has inventiveness and innovation stitched into its story. Bailey, during his 17 years there, steered the company to its mega-brand status and it is the only British high-fashion company on the FTSE 100 (its 2018/19 revenue was \u00a32.7 billion).\n\n\u201cThomas Burberry was a genius and a very daring man, but today the world is different, there is a lot of energy changing,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cI want Burberry to be recognised as a global luxury house.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA new focus has been placed on accessories, with bags including the TB and the Lola, a nifty little creation that comes in multiple iterations from punky to urban to self-consciously twee in tweed. The spirit of Vivienne Westwood and her revisionist take on Britishness is in evidence, and one of Tisci\u2019s first moves was to announce a Burberry collaboration with Westwood in 2018, a capsule collection that went heavy on the classic Burberry check, but reimagined in various sexy and subversive ways. \u201cI want Burberry to be exclusive, but also approachable for everyone, so you have the classic and the more urban, things for everybody.\u201d\n\nKeeping innovation at the heart of the brand, Tisci has introduced a \u201cmonthly drop\u201d \u2013 regular launches of limited-edition pieces on its social media feeds. It is a transformation, but a subtle one, wrought by a designer who has a special affinity for the sort of Britishness that Burberry represents, and who understands the bravery and the work that transformation requires.\n\nI ask how he is different today from the boy who arrived in London all those years ago. \u201cI can talk to you now, I couldn\u2019t then,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a long time I couldn\u2019t talk about my father, or about who I was, without being scared of being judged. Now I can be proud of who I am.\u201d\n\nModel: Fran Summers @ Storm Management. Photography Assistants: Fabio Affuso, James McNaught, Matt Wash. Digital Technician: Victor Gautier.

A stone\u2019s throw away from the brand\u2019s HQ, Boris Johnson has just entered 10 Downing Street for the first time, to jeers from protesters. Anti-Brexit demonstrators roam Parliament Square. Commuters on their way home try to manage the late July heatwave, some with ice lollies, others with pints. Some have given up entirely and are just sitting on the pavement, totally frazzled.\n\nFrazzled is not a word that gets much use at the top of Burberry Towers. The rooftop is all members\u2019 club discretion \u2013 bleached wood furniture, bowls of gigantic roses and perfectly chilled, iced sparkling water. The designer has specified this location, where some might have suggested their office, maybe, or a carefully chosen buzzy restaurant. If Burberry is a brand based on a very British weather system of cloudy with a chance of rain, Tisci is different. Born near Lake Como in Italy, he\u2019s accustomed to sunshine.\n\nThis becomes clear when he sits down and launches into his summer plans. \u201cI am going to Como to celebrate my birthday,\u201d he says. \u201cThen Mykonos\u2026 Me and all best friends who live in different countries, we meet there in August. A nice villa in the middle of nowhere\u2026 I love it. If you want to go and eat fish, you go and eat fish; if you want to sleep, you sleep; or if you want to get drunk all together \u2013 it\u2019s nice. The sea, the food, the fish, the tomatoes, everything.\u201d These words tumble out of Tisci\u2019s mouth, and he finishes with a grin, and a sip of the iced coffee he arrived with. Anyone after more of this scenario would do well to join 2.5m others and follow Tisci on Instagram. This year\u2019s destinations include a boat in Ibiza (he is pictured topless, wetsuit pulled down to his waist) and New York for Pride (surrounded by friends, all in hotpants). Or look up his 40th birthday in Ibiza \u2013 a decadent affair with Kate Moss, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell attending.\n\n\u2018When you do well for yourself in France you get the Chanel bag, in England you get the Burberry trench\u2019.

He carries a Burberry bumbag with a packet of American Spirit peeking out. If you didn\u2019t know he was a designer, you might think he worked in the music industry.\n\nThis look signals that Tisci is a departure for Burberry. Google Image Christopher Bailey, the previous chief creative officer for 17 years, and you\u2019ll see what I mean. Bailey is much more a crisp shirt and occasional blazer kind of man, the uniform of the discreetly wealthy. Bailey\u2019s collections reflected this taste, too. They often came with a blue-chip British bookish reference \u2013 the Bloomsbury group, say, or David Hockney \u2013 and a BBC Radio 6 Music-approved sound: Paloma Faith, Keane, Jake Bugg. Samantha Cameron and Kate Middleton wore the clothes.\n\nAnd Bailey\u2019s Burberry was successful. Thanks to him, the brand is now Proper Fashion, with the London fashion week show a hot ticket every season. But Bailey\u2019s Burberry was not really cool. Tisci, by contrast, is one of fashion\u2019s current arbiters of that intangible quality. Previously the creative director of Givenchy for 12 years, he designed the wedding outfits for his good friends Kanye and Kim, and has a long-running collaboration with Nike. Madonna, Frank Ocean and Marina Abramovi\u0107 are part of his friendship group (he bought a house with the artist). Since Tisci joined Burberry last year, the brand has worked with MIA (even persuading the edgy musician to appear in the slightly cheesy format of a Christmas advert) and dressed Gen Z favourites Ariana Grande, Rihanna and Gigi Hadid. Such is Tisci\u2019s influence that model Freja Beha Erichsen \u2013 who is Kind of a Big Deal in fashion, with 24 Vogue covers to her name and a starring role in Burberry\u2019s autumn ad campaign \u2013 rejigged her schedule to be part of this shoot.\n\nRiccardo Tisci with his good friends Kanye West and Madonna. Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nAt Givenchy, Tisci turned a couture relic most associated with Audrey Hepburn\u2019s LBDs into the height of millennial cool \u2013 specifically appealing to the hypebeast demographic who might also wear streetwear labels Supreme and Palace. Originally known for his gothic aesthetic, streetwear started appearing on the catwalk around 2011. Hypebeasts swiftly signed up \u2013 they loved the T-shirts with a snarling rottweiler print, the basketball vests, the plaid shirt with studs. And at around \u00a3360 for one of those T-shirts, they were within reach \u2013 more affordable than a four-figure gown, anyway. This was part of the strategy \u2013 that, and his duties as a good uncle. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go home for Christmas and have my sisters\u2019 kids say, \u2018It\u2019s beautiful, what you do, but I can\u2019t afford it,\u2019\u201d Tisci explains. \u201cThat killed me. I wanted them to come to me and say, \u2018I have been saving money to buy the Bambi T-shirt.\u2019\n\n\u201c[At first], nobody was caring about it. Slowly but slowly, it was selling, selling, getting bigger,\u201d Tisci continues. \u201c[Then] everybody wants a piece and everybody starts doing it. I don\u2019t mind it because whenever the younger generation talk about that, they always mention my name.\u201d Tisci\u2019s success meant high street brands started producing their own take. You might not know his name but he is the reason you have a statement sweatshirt, the reason the phrase \u201cposh tracksuit trousers\u201d is not an oxymoron.\n\nReworking the check. Tisci\u2019s Burberry designs bring the classic to the radar of a new generation.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that Tisci is intrigued by a part of Burberry\u2019s history that was, until now, a touchy subject: its association with \u201cchav\u201d culture. In 2002, actor Danniella Westbrook was snapped in a Burberry check skirt with matching handbag. Her daughter wore a matching kilt, and sat in a Burberry check pushchair. The label was also spotted on football terraces. By being associated with the working-classes, the luxury brand was seen as losing its way. While check had already been reintroduced by Bailey, with a 2018 collaboration with streetwear designer Gosha Rubchinskiy, Tisci has reassessed the idea of \u201cchav\u201d. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t say it, but last season it was a little bit the inspiration,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it is great because I come from the streets.\u201d The AW collection, entitled Tempest, included streetwear, sophisticated classics and that oh-so-familiar check, reworked with a darker khaki and the punchy graphics that Tisci fans flock to.\n\nDesigners from humble backgrounds are nothing new \u2013 Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood, Bailey himself - but Tisci has a genuine rags to riches story. Born in 1974, he grew up the youngest child \u2013 and only boy \u2013 of nine children. He wore his sisters\u2019 pink hand-me-downs to school. His father died when Tisci was four and the siblings had to work to keep the family afloat. He has spoken before about one meal a day being the norm, how he was helping his uncle with plastering from the age of 11. It\u2019s all a long way from rooftops with a view of the Houses of Parliament.\n\nTisci\u2019s unlikely success is, he says, down to \u201cangels I have crossed in my life\u201d. The first arrived when he stopped attending primary school. \u201cThe teachers came to my house, Miss Besio and Mr Borriero. They said to my mum, \u2018Your son needs to study because he has something different to all the other children.\u2019\u201d Tisci stayed in school. This continued in London \u2013 on an internship, fellow designer Antonio Berardi saw his illustrations and sent Tisci to renowned fashion college Central Saint Martins. While there, tutor Willie Walters ensured he received a grant so he was able to study. Tisci was made creative director of Givenchy in 2005, aged 29. \u201cI am a self-made person,\u201d he says now, with a drag of an American Spirit. \u201cMy mum gave me love but that is the only thing she gave me.\u201d (Tisci is prone to these telenovela-ish soundbites, which is understandable when you find out he has a story worthy of a box set.)\n\nRihanna wears a Burberry trench on stage at a Fenty Beauty event. Photograph: Mark Ganzon/Getty\n\nTisci sees a kindred spirit in Thomas Burberry, who started the eponymous brand in 1856, at the age of 21, in the far from fashionable environs of Basingstoke. He invented gabardine, the waterproof fabric that went on to be used for the trenchcoat, in 1879. Adopted by explorers and intrepid types including Ernest Shackleton and Betty Kirby-Green, Burberry trenches were worn in the trenches in the first world war. By 1965, it\u2019s said that one in every five coats exported from the UK was made by Burberry. These days, the brand employs around 10,000 people and is the only luxury fashion brand in the FTSE 100. It also looms large in British style. In the time I have been working on this interview, I have seen Tisci-designed Burberry tote bags on the tube, the check on a woman\u2019s scarf in the supermarket, a trench, with rolled-up check sleeves, in a cocktail bar.\n\nTisci says Thomas is central to his reworking of Burberry, so much so that he changed the Burberry logo \u2013 with the help of Peter Saville \u2013 to feature the founder\u2019s initials. \u201cThe company should still be an institution but at the same time we need to have the perception of human,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a business company.\u201d That may seem a bit soppy to any board members reading this, but his nose for hits is well-known \u2013 Burberry\u2019s share price went up 5% when his appointment was announced. There\u2019s still work to do, though: even after a 4% rise in sales, analysts at the Bernstein Group downgraded Burberry to \u201cunderperform\u201d in August.\n\nTisci\u2019s track record for courting millennials suggests this is just a blip. He\u2019s started Burberry\u2019s B Series which plays into the \u201cdrop\u201d culture of streetwear \u2013 a new product is released on the 17th of each month (August\u2019s was a dog hoodie, personalisable with the lucky pooch\u2019s name), and reliably sells out in minutes. Another addition is T-shirts, scarves and bags covered in unicorns. If that sounds like a cynical ploy to appeal to fans of emojis and pool inflatables, the story has the authenticity this cohort highly prizes. A search of the archive revealed an alternative insignia from the brand\u2019s famous knight \u2013 a unicorn, designed by Burberry for his family. \u201cIn the day it was a horse, in the night it became a unicorn,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cI thought it was a very beautiful thing. In a way, it\u2019s very relatable to what happened in my life\u2026 My sisters were like Thomas Burberry. During the day, they have to be strong warriors, but in the night they would take off all this armour and be very sweet mothers to me.\u201d\n\nFamily comes first for Tisci. He remains very close to his mother, who is now 90. His formative experiences of fashion came from watching his eight sisters \u2013 who, he says, are four pairs of best friends \u2013 get ready to go out, when he was a child. \u201cThey would be in the bathroom, putting makeup on. I was sitting on the bathtub thinking, one day I can go out and meet the people around the world.\u201d\n\nTisci has said before that he took the Givenchy job so he could buy his mother a house. His break with the brand was also prompted by family \u2013 at the funeral of his brother-in-law in 2016, he realised his mother was getting older, his nieces and nephews were growing up. And he wanted in. \u201cI wanted to be the son of my mother, the brother of my sister, that I have never been really because life never gave me the opportunity,\u201d he says. He quit Givenchy the following spring. The announcement went out while he was in a desert in Algeria, with his phone switched off.\n\nSitting back. Model Freja Beha Erichsen wearing Burberry. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nThe next year was low-key. He had, he says, \u201cno agenda\u201d. \u201cLike anyone when you are busy, you have a PA, a PR,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes you want to go to buy your toothpaste, you want to discover what is the new cream for your skin, not always have somebody going for you.\u201d He slept a lot and he travelled, going to Portugal with his family and backpacking around Costa Rica. That is, until Burberry called. Tisci was brought back to fashion by the man who brought him into it in the first place \u2013 Marco Gobbetti, now CEO of Burberry (with an annual salary of \u00a37.3m, as was recently revealed), but then at Givenchy. \u201cMarco is the person who saved my career and gave me the opportunity to be who I am today,\u201d Tisci says, with that frisson of drama. The trench was also enticing. \u201cWhen you behave well at school, in France you get the Chanel bag,\u201d he says. \u201cIn England you get the Burberry trench. It\u2019s something I discovered here. Adele told me the first thing she bought when her first single came out was a Burberry trench.\u201d Tisci\u2019s first collection for Burberry featured 20 trenches.\n\nBut will the perception of a brand \u2013 and an item \u2013 so associated with Britishness change post-Brexit? \u201cBritish is not my culture but I am representing a very important British house,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cFor me to celebrate Britishness and bring it to America, China, it\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nI would guess Tisci was Remain \u2013 inclusivity and diversity are his MO. He championed casting people of colour well before the rest of fashion woke up to the idea. He also cast his friend Lea T, a trans woman, in an ad campaign in 2010, helping her financially and opening the door to models such as Hari Nef, Andreja Pejic and Nathan Westling. \u201cI got so much shit. You cannot imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cThank God we had people like Oprah Winfrey who said, \u2018Stop a second, he is doing something that is right.\u2019 When somebody more powerful says something, it changes.\u201d Family Tisci were a support network, too. \u201cWhen she [Lea T] decided to become a woman and her family didn\u2019t accept her, my mum took her to our house and she lived with us,\u201d he says. \u201cShe treated Lea as a daughter. Lea still says, \u2018Your mum is the first person to call me she, not he.\u2019\u201d\n\nTisci is definitely an ally to a socially aware generation (Burberry\u2019s policy of burning clothes and its use of fur ended soon after he joined). But he doesn\u2019t always get it right. There was a skirmish after the autumn show when model Liz Kennedy compared the fastening on a hoodie to a noose on social media. \u201cSuicide is not fashion,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRiccardo Tisci and everyone at Burberry it is beyond me how you could let a look resembling a noose hanging from a neck out on the runway.\u201d While other brands have seen items that cause offence reach stores \u2013 both Gucci and Prada have had scandals around designs with racist imagery \u2013 this was swiftly shut down. In a statement, Tisci said, \u201cIt does not reflect my values nor Burberry\u2019s and we have removed it from the collection.\u201d\n\nThe good ship Burberry: Tisci brings a twist to Burberry\u2019s heritage with graphic prints and a new logo. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nWhile Tisci says he isn\u2019t a political person, he does concede he has a platform. \u201cIf it\u2019s to fight for rights, to help people, I am the first one,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s about going to sit at a table and talk about money, numbers and power, that is, like you say here, not my cup of tea.\u201d\n\nNow back in London for over a year, Tisci lives in Mayfair (he did consider Marylebone, where his friend Madonna has a house), trains every day in a local gym and watches what he eats. Then, once in a while, he lets himself go. Tisci has gone to raves, festivals \u2013 \u201cI never thought I would be a festival person\u201d \u2013 and gigs: Rosal\u00eda, the buzzy Spanish singer, Bj\u00f6rk, Primal Scream. The evening we speak, he is having drinks with singer Dua Lipa. Next up, his birthday, celebrated quietly with family. I\u2019m not taking his word for it \u2013 it\u2019s all documented on Instagram a few days later. The designer looks content, lake in the background, Aperol spritz on the table, surrounded by his sisters and mother.

That wasn\u2019t due to a lack of commercial success nor understanding of big business (Tisci has both). It was more the fact that, well, Tisci isn\u2019t British: he is Italian, born in 1974 in Cermenate, near Lake Como. And his name was established during a 12-year tenure at Givenchy, that most patrician and aristocratically French of fashion houses, where Tisci was one of only a handful of designers to create haute couture, while also offering couture-tinged ready-to-wear for women and, more unexpectedly, men. With more than a touch of small-mindedness, many commentators couldn\u2019t see how Riccardo Tisci could, on the one hand, interpret the quintessence of Britishness embedded in Burberry and, on the other, understand the complexities of our strange little society. \u201cI\u2019m not British, obviously,\u201d says Tisci, in his still-heavy Italian accent. \u201cBut I lived here when I was young. I studied here. I graduated here. I have to give all my gratitude to England.

He\u2019s careful and measured \u2013 how anyone is when you talk about Brexit, especially in fashion. His thick black eyebrows frequently furrow. \u201cI\u2019m interested in how Britishness is developing in different ways.\u201d\n\nIn a sense, Tisci is now part of said \u201cBritishness\u201d. Burberry is a company that is a component of our national identity, with its royal warrant and trench coats and checks dressing every echelon of society since Thomas Burberry founded the company as a 21-year-old in 1856. There was already some Britishness to Tisci: he first came to the country in 1991, when he was 17, and later studied at Central Saint Martins. His work is tinged with a rebellion often perceived as distinctly English, born from punk and the revolutionary work of Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood \u2013 the first person Tisci chose to collaborate with at Burberry, on a capsule collection that reiterated her Nineties greatest hits, which Tisci knew well and evidently still loves."}, {"url": "https://www.famousfashiondesigners.org/riccardo-tisci", "page_content": "Riccardo Tisci is an Italian designer from Taranto, who was born in 1974. He graduated from Central Saint Martin\u2019s Academy in 1999, London, after studying in Italy. The city of his birthplace is tied to mythological stories of marines and mermaids, that acted as an inspiration in designs he created for Givenchy haute couture and ready-to-wear. After graduation, Tisci worked for a series of companies such as Coccapani and Puma prior to signing a three year agreement with Ruffo Research, which initiated the careers of many fashion designers including Sophia Kokosalaki. In 2004, when the contract expired, he started working on his personal collection, that he exhibited in 2005 and 2006 Fall Milan Fashion Week.\n\nBefore long, he was appointed as the creative director at Givenchy in 2005. This was an offer he had almost turned down since his original idea was to focus on his own fashion collection. However, when the designer found out about his mother selling the house for a personal problem related to his sisters and their new family life, he accepted the company\u2019s offer and was content with his salary. Marco Gobbetti of Givenchy described Tisci as a perfect fit for the label because the designer has an elegance that is highly contemporary, modern and romantic simultaneously. Unlike the many designers who have succeeded Hubert de Givenchy, Tisci has received immense success, both financially and critically, specially in the sphere of haute couture. His catwalk presentations are very stylized with regards to space and architecture. The designer explained that his way of displaying the work is extremely melancholic and Tisci loves sensuality and romanticism.\n\nTisci, while working for Givenchy, created costumes for Madonna in 2008 to wear on the Sticky and Sweet Tour, following Dolce & Gabbana and Jean Paul Gaultier. In 2009, he designed another outfit for the introductory song, Candy Shop. In addition to this, he also designed exclusive clothes for Madonna \u2013 when she is not performing on stage.\n\nFor Givenchy\u2019s Fall collection in 2010 he launched a new Brazilian transsexual model, Lea T. He worked with this models for years and Lea was also his personal assistant. In 2011, Tisci was considered to become John Galliano\u2018s successor at Christian Dior as the head designer, however a year later Raf Simons was announced as the Dior\u2019s creative director after Galliano.\n\nHis other projects include an invitation in 2008 to curate A-Anna magazine, issue eight. In 2011, he was the guest editor of Visionaire\u2018s issue on religion. Moreover, other than working with Madonna, Riccardo Tisci has collaborated with Kanye West and Jay Z to make the covers for H.A.M and Watch The Throne. He again worked with West for his label GOOD Music on the Cruel Summer album.\n\nMariacarla Boscono, Italian model, appears frequently in his fashion shows and advertisement campaigns not only because of her talents but also because she is Tisci\u2019s friend since his days at Givenchy.\n\nTisci desires to open a foundation for young people, to help them pursue their dreams and do what they are passionate about. This charitable thought came to his mind because of a young Iranian boy, who he encountered, who attends a boarding school in Dubai and is highly interested in fashion. However, his parents want the boy to study the subject of law.\n\nMany fashion lovers, critics, and people feel that Riccardo Tisci\u2019s fashion designing sense is gothic and dark."}, {"url": "https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/riccardo-tisci-life-in-looks", "page_content": "After bowing out of his creative directorship at Burberry with a goth-at-the-beach spring/summer 2023 show and Shakira-fronted Christmas campaign, Riccardo Tisci is taking a break. But don\u2019t think he\u2019s forgotten about the industry completely. Already, the designer has fashioned his first solo work in 17 years for friend Michaela Coel and now, he\u2019s sifted through his vast archive to compile his Life in Looks for British Vogue. For a man who has collaborated with Madonna, Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna, and calls Naomi Campbell and Mariacarla Boscono muses and sisters, this is no mean feat. It was also, says Tisci, highly emotional.\n\nWhile there have been obvious professional highs \u2013 including the first Riccardo Tisci show, which saw friends Karen Elson and Liya Kebede model his anti-polished, pro-gothic looks for free, and Givenchy\u2019s anniversary show during which the rain clouds parted and a glorious sunset backdropped his darkly sensual work \u2013 many of the Italian\u2019s creatives wins are deeply personal. He accepted that coveted Givenchy contract in 2005, for example, not because of the prestige, but because of the pay cheque that would enable him to save his mother from selling the family home to make ends meet.\n\nTisci\u2019s collaboration with Nike, back when it was unheard of for a couturier to elevate sportswear into high fashion, was also rooted in a childhood where a simple pair of trainers acted as a great leveller and allowed him to fit in. And so, years down the line, when industry outsider Kim Kardashian was not considered in vogue, it was Tisci who stepped forward to dress the then-heavily pregnant reality TV star for the 2013 Met Gala \u2013 an event she was only allowed to attend as the plus one of Kanye West. The blossoming rose gown he made was symbolic of the woman he saw: a strong individual expressing one of the most powerful acts of femininity.\n\nIt is unsurprising, then, that before Tisci\u2019s next move (a new vacancy at Gucci has just become available), he is taking stock of his core values: making his new house in London a home, spending time with the eight sisters who shaped him and, he reveals, \u201ctrying to have a child\u201d. Rather than jumping into the next project, \u201csimplicity\u201d is the biggest trend in Tisci\u2019s life right now \u2013 and it looks good.

A stone\u2019s throw away from the brand\u2019s HQ, Boris Johnson has just entered 10 Downing Street for the first time, to jeers from protesters. Anti-Brexit demonstrators roam Parliament Square. Commuters on their way home try to manage the late July heatwave, some with ice lollies, others with pints.

Born near Lake Como in Italy, he\u2019s accustomed to sunshine.\n\nThis becomes clear when he sits down and launches into his summer plans. \u201cI am going to Como to celebrate my birthday,\u201d he says. \u201cThen Mykonos\u2026 Me and all best friends who live in different countries, we meet there in August. A nice villa in the middle of nowhere\u2026 I love it. If you want to go and eat fish, you go and eat fish; if you want to sleep, you sleep; or if you want to get drunk all together \u2013 it\u2019s nice. The sea, the food, the fish, the tomatoes, everything.\u201d These words tumble out of Tisci\u2019s mouth, and he finishes with a grin, and a sip of the iced coffee he arrived with. Anyone after more of this scenario would do well to join 2.5m others and follow Tisci on Instagram. This year\u2019s destinations include a boat in Ibiza (he is pictured topless, wetsuit pulled down to his waist) and New York for Pride (surrounded by friends, all in hotpants). Or look up his 40th birthday in Ibiza \u2013 a decadent affair with Kate Moss, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell attending.\n\n\u2018When you do well for yourself in France you get the Chanel bag, in England you get the Burberry trench\u2019. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nToday, like most days, the gym-honed 45-year-old \u2013 \u201cI am Leo with a moon ascending Gemini\u201d \u2013 wears a black T-shirt of his own design with TB (Thomas Burberry) logo, black basketball shorts and well-worn, even slightly bobbly, black Nike socks with swoosh. He carries a Burberry bumbag with a packet of American Spirit peeking out. If you didn\u2019t know he was a designer, you might think he worked in the music industry.\n\nThis look signals that Tisci is a departure for Burberry. Google Image Christopher Bailey, the previous chief creative officer for 17 years, and you\u2019ll see what I mean. Bailey is much more a crisp shirt and occasional blazer kind of man, the uniform of the discreetly wealthy. Bailey\u2019s collections reflected this taste, too. They often came with a blue-chip British bookish reference \u2013 the Bloomsbury group, say, or David Hockney \u2013 and a BBC Radio 6 Music-approved sound: Paloma Faith, Keane, Jake Bugg. Samantha Cameron and Kate Middleton wore the clothes.\n\nAnd Bailey\u2019s Burberry was successful. Thanks to him, the brand is now Proper Fashion, with the London fashion week show a hot ticket every season. But Bailey\u2019s Burberry was not really cool. Tisci, by contrast, is one of fashion\u2019s current arbiters of that intangible quality. Previously the creative director of Givenchy for 12 years, he designed the wedding outfits for his good friends Kanye and Kim, and has a long-running collaboration with Nike. Madonna, Frank Ocean and Marina Abramovi\u0107 are part of his friendship group (he bought a house with the artist). Since Tisci joined Burberry last year, the brand has worked with MIA (even persuading the edgy musician to appear in the slightly cheesy format of a Christmas advert) and dressed Gen Z favourites Ariana Grande, Rihanna and Gigi Hadid. Such is Tisci\u2019s influence that model Freja Beha Erichsen \u2013 who is Kind of a Big Deal in fashion, with 24 Vogue covers to her name and a starring role in Burberry\u2019s autumn ad campaign \u2013 rejigged her schedule to be part of this shoot.\n\nRiccardo Tisci with his good friends Kanye West and Madonna. Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nAt Givenchy, Tisci turned a couture relic most associated with Audrey Hepburn\u2019s LBDs into the height of millennial cool \u2013 specifically appealing to the hypebeast demographic who might also wear streetwear labels Supreme and Palace. Originally known for his gothic aesthetic, streetwear started appearing on the catwalk around 2011. Hypebeasts swiftly signed up \u2013 they loved the T-shirts with a snarling rottweiler print, the basketball vests, the plaid shirt with studs. And at around \u00a3360 for one of those T-shirts, they were within reach \u2013 more affordable than a four-figure gown, anyway. This was part of the strategy \u2013 that, and his duties as a good uncle. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go home for Christmas and have my sisters\u2019 kids say, \u2018It\u2019s beautiful, what you do, but I can\u2019t afford it,\u2019\u201d Tisci explains. \u201cThat killed me. I wanted them to come to me and say, \u2018I have been saving money to buy the Bambi T-shirt.\u2019\n\n\u201c[At first], nobody was caring about it. Slowly but slowly, it was selling, selling, getting bigger,\u201d Tisci continues. \u201c[Then] everybody wants a piece and everybody starts doing it. I don\u2019t mind it because whenever the younger generation talk about that, they always mention my name.\u201d Tisci\u2019s success meant high street brands started producing their own take. You might not know his name but he is the reason you have a statement sweatshirt, the reason the phrase \u201cposh tracksuit trousers\u201d is not an oxymoron.\n\nReworking the check. Tisci\u2019s Burberry designs bring the classic to the radar of a new generation.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that Tisci is intrigued by a part of Burberry\u2019s history that was, until now, a touchy subject: its association with \u201cchav\u201d culture. In 2002, actor Danniella Westbrook was snapped in a Burberry check skirt with matching handbag. Her daughter wore a matching kilt, and sat in a Burberry check pushchair. The label was also spotted on football terraces. By being associated with the working-classes, the luxury brand was seen as losing its way. While check had already been reintroduced by Bailey, with a 2018 collaboration with streetwear designer Gosha Rubchinskiy, Tisci has reassessed the idea of \u201cchav\u201d. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t say it, but last season it was a little bit the inspiration,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it is great because I come from the streets.\u201d The AW collection, entitled Tempest, included streetwear, sophisticated classics and that oh-so-familiar check, reworked with a darker khaki and the punchy graphics that Tisci fans flock to.\n\nDesigners from humble backgrounds are nothing new \u2013 Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood, Bailey himself - but Tisci has a genuine rags to riches story. Born in 1974, he grew up the youngest child \u2013 and only boy \u2013 of nine children. He wore his sisters\u2019 pink hand-me-downs to school. His father died when Tisci was four and the siblings had to work to keep the family afloat. He has spoken before about one meal a day being the norm, how he was helping his uncle with plastering from the age of 11. It\u2019s all a long way from rooftops with a view of the Houses of Parliament.\n\nTisci\u2019s unlikely success is, he says, down to \u201cangels I have crossed in my life\u201d. The first arrived when he stopped attending primary school. \u201cThe teachers came to my house, Miss Besio and Mr Borriero. They said to my mum, \u2018Your son needs to study because he has something different to all the other children.\u2019\u201d Tisci stayed in school. This continued in London \u2013 on an internship, fellow designer Antonio Berardi saw his illustrations and sent Tisci to renowned fashion college Central Saint Martins. While there, tutor Willie Walters ensured he received a grant so he was able to study. Tisci was made creative director of Givenchy in 2005, aged 29. \u201cI am a self-made person,\u201d he says now, with a drag of an American Spirit. \u201cMy mum gave me love but that is the only thing she gave me.\u201d (Tisci is prone to these telenovela-ish soundbites, which is understandable when you find out he has a story worthy of a box set.)\n\nRihanna wears a Burberry trench on stage at a Fenty Beauty event. Photograph: Mark Ganzon/Getty\n\nTisci sees a kindred spirit in Thomas Burberry, who started the eponymous brand in 1856, at the age of 21, in the far from fashionable environs of Basingstoke. He invented gabardine, the waterproof fabric that went on to be used for the trenchcoat, in 1879. Adopted by explorers and intrepid types including Ernest Shackleton and Betty Kirby-Green, Burberry trenches were worn in the trenches in the first world war. By 1965, it\u2019s said that one in every five coats exported from the UK was made by Burberry. These days, the brand employs around 10,000 people and is the only luxury fashion brand in the FTSE 100. It also looms large in British style. In the time I have been working on this interview, I have seen Tisci-designed Burberry tote bags on the tube, the check on a woman\u2019s scarf in the supermarket, a trench, with rolled-up check sleeves, in a cocktail bar.\n\nTisci says Thomas is central to his reworking of Burberry, so much so that he changed the Burberry logo \u2013 with the help of Peter Saville \u2013 to feature the founder\u2019s initials. \u201cThe company should still be an institution but at the same time we need to have the perception of human,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a business company.\u201d That may seem a bit soppy to any board members reading this, but his nose for hits is well-known \u2013 Burberry\u2019s share price went up 5% when his appointment was announced. There\u2019s still work to do, though: even after a 4% rise in sales, analysts at the Bernstein Group downgraded Burberry to \u201cunderperform\u201d in August.\n\nTisci\u2019s track record for courting millennials suggests this is just a blip. He\u2019s started Burberry\u2019s B Series which plays into the \u201cdrop\u201d culture of streetwear \u2013 a new product is released on the 17th of each month (August\u2019s was a dog hoodie, personalisable with the lucky pooch\u2019s name), and reliably sells out in minutes. Another addition is T-shirts, scarves and bags covered in unicorns. If that sounds like a cynical ploy to appeal to fans of emojis and pool inflatables, the story has the authenticity this cohort highly prizes. A search of the archive revealed an alternative insignia from the brand\u2019s famous knight \u2013 a unicorn, designed by Burberry for his family. \u201cIn the day it was a horse, in the night it became a unicorn,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cI thought it was a very beautiful thing. In a way, it\u2019s very relatable to what happened in my life\u2026 My sisters were like Thomas Burberry. During the day, they have to be strong warriors, but in the night they would take off all this armour and be very sweet mothers to me.\u201d\n\nFamily comes first for Tisci. He remains very close to his mother, who is now 90. His formative experiences of fashion came from watching his eight sisters \u2013 who, he says, are four pairs of best friends \u2013 get ready to go out, when he was a child. \u201cThey would be in the bathroom, putting makeup on. I was sitting on the bathtub thinking, one day I can go out and meet the people around the world.\u201d\n\nTisci has said before that he took the Givenchy job so he could buy his mother a house. His break with the brand was also prompted by family \u2013 at the funeral of his brother-in-law in 2016, he realised his mother was getting older, his nieces and nephews were growing up. And he wanted in. \u201cI wanted to be the son of my mother, the brother of my sister, that I have never been really because life never gave me the opportunity,\u201d he says. He quit Givenchy the following spring. The announcement went out while he was in a desert in Algeria, with his phone switched off.\n\nSitting back. Model Freja Beha Erichsen wearing Burberry. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nThe next year was low-key. He had, he says, \u201cno agenda\u201d. \u201cLike anyone when you are busy, you have a PA, a PR,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes you want to go to buy your toothpaste, you want to discover what is the new cream for your skin, not always have somebody going for you.\u201d He slept a lot and he travelled, going to Portugal with his family and backpacking around Costa Rica. That is, until Burberry called. Tisci was brought back to fashion by the man who brought him into it in the first place \u2013 Marco Gobbetti, now CEO of Burberry (with an annual salary of \u00a37.3m, as was recently revealed), but then at Givenchy. \u201cMarco is the person who saved my career and gave me the opportunity to be who I am today,\u201d Tisci says, with that frisson of drama. The trench was also enticing. \u201cWhen you behave well at school, in France you get the Chanel bag,\u201d he says. \u201cIn England you get the Burberry trench. It\u2019s something I discovered here. Adele told me the first thing she bought when her first single came out was a Burberry trench.\u201d Tisci\u2019s first collection for Burberry featured 20 trenches.\n\nBut will the perception of a brand \u2013 and an item \u2013 so associated with Britishness change post-Brexit? \u201cBritish is not my culture but I am representing a very important British house,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cFor me to celebrate Britishness and bring it to America, China, it\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nI would guess Tisci was Remain \u2013 inclusivity and diversity are his MO. He championed casting people of colour well before the rest of fashion woke up to the idea. He also cast his friend Lea T, a trans woman, in an ad campaign in 2010, helping her financially and opening the door to models such as Hari Nef, Andreja Pejic and Nathan Westling. \u201cI got so much shit. You cannot imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cThank God we had people like Oprah Winfrey who said, \u2018Stop a second, he is doing something that is right.\u2019 When somebody more powerful says something, it changes.\u201d Family Tisci were a support network, too. \u201cWhen she [Lea T] decided to become a woman and her family didn\u2019t accept her, my mum took her to our house and she lived with us,\u201d he says. \u201cShe treated Lea as a daughter. Lea still says, \u2018Your mum is the first person to call me she, not he.\u2019\u201d\n\nTisci is definitely an ally to a socially aware generation (Burberry\u2019s policy of burning clothes and its use of fur ended soon after he joined). But he doesn\u2019t always get it right. There was a skirmish after the autumn show when model Liz Kennedy compared the fastening on a hoodie to a noose on social media. \u201cSuicide is not fashion,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRiccardo Tisci and everyone at Burberry it is beyond me how you could let a look resembling a noose hanging from a neck out on the runway.\u201d While other brands have seen items that cause offence reach stores \u2013 both Gucci and Prada have had scandals around designs with racist imagery \u2013 this was swiftly shut down. In a statement, Tisci said, \u201cIt does not reflect my values nor Burberry\u2019s and we have removed it from the collection.\u201d\n\nThe good ship Burberry: Tisci brings a twist to Burberry\u2019s heritage with graphic prints and a new logo. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nWhile Tisci says he isn\u2019t a political person, he does concede he has a platform. \u201cIf it\u2019s to fight for rights, to help people, I am the first one,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s about going to sit at a table and talk about money, numbers and power, that is, like you say here, not my cup of tea.\u201d\n\nNow back in London for over a year, Tisci lives in Mayfair (he did consider Marylebone, where his friend Madonna has a house), trains every day in a local gym and watches what he eats. Then, once in a while, he lets himself go. Tisci has gone to raves, festivals \u2013 \u201cI never thought I would be a festival person\u201d \u2013 and gigs: Rosal\u00eda, the buzzy Spanish singer, Bj\u00f6rk, Primal Scream. The evening we speak, he is having drinks with singer Dua Lipa. Next up, his birthday, celebrated quietly with family. I\u2019m not taking his word for it \u2013 it\u2019s all documented on Instagram a few days later. The designer looks content, lake in the background, Aperol spritz on the table, surrounded by his sisters and mother. Rooftops in London are all very well but for Tisci, there\u2019s still no place like home."}, {"url": "https://www.businessoffashion.com/community/people/riccardo-tisci", "page_content": "Riccardo Tisci is an Italian designer, renowned for his work at Givenchy, a French house that Tisci resurrected to its former profitable glory and his latest work at Burbery. Impressively, the designer crafted distinct brand identities for all of Givenchy\u2019s product categories across women\u2019s and men\u2019s ready-to-wear and haute couture lines. At Burberry, he lifted sales after faltering period, and revamping the company's brand identity.\n\nTisci grew up in a tight-knit, single-parent, working-class family in Italy. The designer describes his family life as hugely influential on him and remembers his childhood as one filled with love. Tisci left regular school aged 11 to enroll in art school in Milan. \u201cI wanted to express myself and I couldn't really do it through words at that point,\" he told The Daily Telegraph. The designer was selected for a scholarship by Central Saint Martins, from which he graduated in 1999. He then held design positions at Puma, Antonio Berardi and with Ruffo Research, before embarking on his own brand in 2004. As a result of his bold, powerfully-feminine designs, Tisci was announced as the creative director of Givenchy\u2019s womenswear and haute couture lines in 2005. After announcing his amicable departure from the house in February 2017 with a subsequent sabbatical, Tisci was named chief creative officer at Burberry in March 2018, succeeding Christopher Bailey .\n\nTisci\u2019s creations found willing consumers immediately; the designer\u2019s vision for Givenchy initially found traction with consumers rather than editors. In just two years Tisci had revitalised the house\u2019s couture business. He chose to stop showing couture in 2012, taking the business behind the scenes in-house once more.\n\nIn May 2008 he was appointed chief designer of menswear and menswear accessories in addition to his womenswear role. His menswear collections have received rampant critical acclaim and caused the formation of tribe-like followers, many of whom, such as Kanye West, are very much in the public eye. Tisci\u2019s marriage of streetwear influences, Parisian sensibilities and global motifs made Givenchy\u2019s printed sweatshirts a fashion staple, as well as broadening the brand\u2019s appeal exponentially.\n\nFollowing over a decade of experience at the creative helm of Givenchy, Tisci transitioned to Burberry, an announcement that sent share prices soaring by over 5 percent. Joining Marco Gobetti a second time, who also joined Burberry as its chief executive following a stint at Givenchy, Tisci took on plans to reinvigorate product and consumer experiences and expand Burberry's first venture into high end streetwear after a partnership with Gosha Rubchinsky in 2018. Under Tisci's watch, both Burberry's London flagship location and it's monogram logo underwent a revamp, the latter of which debuted with a series of international pop-up installations featuring the new Peter Saville -designed Burberry logo. Following the highly anticipated first Spring/Summer 2019 collection and logo redesign, Burberry reported a 4 percent rise in first quarter comparable store sales in 2019."}, {"url": "https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/riccardo-tisci-life-in-looks", "page_content": "After bowing out of his creative directorship at Burberry with a goth-at-the-beach spring/summer 2023 show and Shakira-fronted Christmas campaign, Riccardo Tisci is taking a break. But don\u2019t think he\u2019s forgotten about the industry completely. Already, the designer has fashioned his first solo work in 17 years for friend Michaela Coel and now, he\u2019s sifted through his vast archive to compile his Life in Looks for British Vogue. For a man who has collaborated with Madonna, Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna, and calls Naomi Campbell and Mariacarla Boscono muses and sisters, this is no mean feat. It was also, says Tisci, highly emotional.\n\nWhile there have been obvious professional highs \u2013 including the first Riccardo Tisci show, which saw friends Karen Elson and Liya Kebede model his anti-polished, pro-gothic looks for free, and Givenchy\u2019s anniversary show during which the rain clouds parted and a glorious sunset backdropped his darkly sensual work \u2013 many of the Italian\u2019s creatives wins are deeply personal. He accepted that coveted Givenchy contract in 2005, for example, not because of the prestige, but because of the pay cheque that would enable him to save his mother from selling the family home to make ends meet.\n\nTisci\u2019s collaboration with Nike, back when it was unheard of for a couturier to elevate sportswear into high fashion, was also rooted in a childhood where a simple pair of trainers acted as a great leveller and allowed him to fit in. And so, years down the line, when industry outsider Kim Kardashian was not considered in vogue, it was Tisci who stepped forward to dress the then-heavily pregnant reality TV star for the 2013 Met Gala \u2013 an event she was only allowed to attend as the plus one of Kanye West. The blossoming rose gown he made was symbolic of the woman he saw: a strong individual expressing one of the most powerful acts of femininity.\n\nIt is unsurprising, then, that before Tisci\u2019s next move (a new vacancy at Gucci has just become available), he is taking stock of his core values: making his new house in London a home, spending time with the eight sisters who shaped him and, he reveals, \u201ctrying to have a child\u201d. Rather than jumping into the next project, \u201csimplicity\u201d is the biggest trend in Tisci\u2019s life right now \u2013 and it looks good.

Tisci has brought his creative talents to the worlds of music, film, art, sports and, of course, fashion. Throughout his career, he has pushed boundaries and set trends during tenures as creative director at Givenchy and Burberry and as the first couturier to collaborate with Nike.\n\nWhen Tisci first joined Givenchy, it meant leaving behind his own fashion label, founded in 2004. As of November, he is back designing for his namesake brand. (At the London premiere of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Michaela Coel wore a custom design from the line.)\n\nThe fashion industry was riveted last September when Tisci announced his departure from Burberry \u2014 where he reignited the brand\u2019s image, revived the Thomas Burberry Monogram and expanded the brand\u2019s audience to a younger and more diverse crowd \u2014 after nearly five years. At the time, the brand\u2019s CEO Jonathan Akeroyd said: \u201cRiccardo has played a pivotal role in repositioning Burberry. He has enhanced our creative language, modernised and elevated our product offer and brought a new generation of luxury customers to our brand.\u201d\n\nSaid Tisci: \u201cBurberry is a very special place with a magical past and a very promising future. I thrived to continue a legacy of innovation and consistently championed for creativity and diversity, in order to always keep Burberry moving forward.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.famousfashiondesigners.org/riccardo-tisci", "page_content": "Riccardo Tisci is an Italian designer from Taranto, who was born in 1974. He graduated from Central Saint Martin\u2019s Academy in 1999, London, after studying in Italy. The city of his birthplace is tied to mythological stories of marines and mermaids, that acted as an inspiration in designs he created for Givenchy haute couture and ready-to-wear. After graduation, Tisci worked for a series of companies such as Coccapani and Puma prior to signing a three year agreement with Ruffo Research, which initiated the careers of many fashion designers including Sophia Kokosalaki. In 2004, when the contract expired, he started working on his personal collection, that he exhibited in 2005 and 2006 Fall Milan Fashion Week.\n\nBefore long, he was appointed as the creative director at Givenchy in 2005. This was an offer he had almost turned down since his original idea was to focus on his own fashion collection. However, when the designer found out about his mother selling the house for a personal problem related to his sisters and their new family life, he accepted the company\u2019s offer and was content with his salary. Marco Gobbetti of Givenchy described Tisci as a perfect fit for the label because the designer has an elegance that is highly contemporary, modern and romantic simultaneously. Unlike the many designers who have succeeded Hubert de Givenchy, Tisci has received immense success, both financially and critically, specially in the sphere of haute couture. His catwalk presentations are very stylized with regards to space and architecture. The designer explained that his way of displaying the work is extremely melancholic and Tisci loves sensuality and romanticism.\n\nTisci, while working for Givenchy, created costumes for Madonna in 2008 to wear on the Sticky and Sweet Tour, following Dolce & Gabbana and Jean Paul Gaultier. In 2009, he designed another outfit for the introductory song, Candy Shop. In addition to this, he also designed exclusive clothes for Madonna \u2013 when she is not performing on stage.\n\nFor Givenchy\u2019s Fall collection in 2010 he launched a new Brazilian transsexual model, Lea T. He worked with this models for years and Lea was also his personal assistant. In 2011, Tisci was considered to become John Galliano\u2018s successor at Christian Dior as the head designer, however a year later Raf Simons was announced as the Dior\u2019s creative director after Galliano.\n\nHis other projects include an invitation in 2008 to curate A-Anna magazine, issue eight. In 2011, he was the guest editor of Visionaire\u2018s issue on religion. Moreover, other than working with Madonna, Riccardo Tisci has collaborated with Kanye West and Jay Z to make the covers for H.A.M and Watch The Throne. He again worked with West for his label GOOD Music on the Cruel Summer album.\n\nMariacarla Boscono, Italian model, appears frequently in his fashion shows and advertisement campaigns not only because of her talents but also because she is Tisci\u2019s friend since his days at Givenchy.\n\nTisci desires to open a foundation for young people, to help them pursue their dreams and do what they are passionate about. This charitable thought came to his mind because of a young Iranian boy, who he encountered, who attends a boarding school in Dubai and is highly interested in fashion. However, his parents want the boy to study the subject of law.\n\nMany fashion lovers, critics, and people feel that Riccardo Tisci\u2019s fashion designing sense is gothic and dark."}, {"url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/riccardo-tisci-exits-burberry-daniel-lee-hired", "page_content": "Riccardo Tisci is exiting Burberry after five years as chief creative officer, the British company announced today. His last show for the brand took place on Monday, having been rescheduled from London Fashion Week due to the Queen\u2019s funeral. Daniel Lee, the former creative director of Bottega Veneta, will take Tisci\u2019s spot at the British heritage house joining on October 3.\n\n\u201cI am delighted that Daniel is joining Burberry as our new Chief Creative Officer. Daniel is an exceptional talent with a unique understanding of today\u2019s luxury consumer and a strong record of commercial success, and his appointment reinforces the ambitions we have for Burberry,\u201d Akeroyd said in a release. \u201cI am excited about working closely with him and I am confident he will have the impact we are aiming for in this next phase, supported by our talented and experienced teams.\u201d\n\nTisci\u2019s appointment at Burberry reunited him with then-CEO Marco Gobbetti, who held the same role at Givenchy during the designer\u2019s tenure there. Under his leadership, Tisci gave Burberry a more international gloss, and re-engaged millennial and Gen Z fans. But Gobbetti left Burberry in June of last year. (He is now at Ferragamo.) Akeroyd, formerly of Versace, was named Burberry\u2019s new CEO last October and began working in the role in April of this year.\n\nInterrupted by the Covid crisis, Tisci\u2019s Burberry failed to reach lift-off the way the LVMH-owned Givenchy did when he helmed that brand. The timing was hard, but Tisci was also playing against type. His predecessor Christopher Bailey embraced and extrapolated on Burberry\u2019s storied heritage; each collection was a sort of love letter to Britain. Being Italian-born, even though he is Central Saint Martins-trained, Tisci came at the label as more of an outsider. His run at the brand has also intersected with Brexit, which perhaps complicated the job of selling Burberry\u2019s Britishness to the world.\n\nNonetheless, he has had his triumphs at Burberry. Straight away, he hooked up with the design legend Peter Saville (of New Order album fame) and reimagined the house logo, adding a T for Thomas to the famous Burberry B. The company\u2019s use of fur ended on his watch, as did the controversial and environmentally harmful policy of burning unsold merchandise. And the Adam Driver-fronted campaign for Hero, Tisci\u2019s first Burberry men\u2019s fragrance, was an unmissable viral phenomenon."}, {"url": "https://showstudio.com/contributors/riccardo_tisci", "page_content": "Riccardo Tisci is a fashion designer born in Taranto, Italy. In February 2017, Tisci was named chief creative officer at Burberry. Tisci spearheaded the redesign of the Burberry brand and logo.\n\nTisci graduated from Central Saint Martins in 1999. Prior to launching his own label in 2004, Tisci worked for Puma, Antonio Berardi and Ruffo Research. In 2005, Tisci was named creative director for Givenchy ready-to-wear, haute couture and accessories, later taking over the menswear division in 2008. Tisci's Gothic sensibility and penchant for religious symbols hugely informed his work at Givenchy, garnering international press acclaim and increased sales.\n\nIn 2011, Tisci guest curated A Magazine and guest-edited Visionaire\u2019s \u2018Religion\u2019 issue in 2013.

The appeal of femininity, he said, was no longer restricted to womenswear. \u201cActually I want to make Burberry more sensual, more soft. I think I can do that in a very powerful way by doing it in menswear.\u201d\n\nA charity partnership with the footballer Marcus Rashford, who starred in a recent Burberry campaign, has boosted the visibility of the company\u2019s menswear. It now accounts for half of all sales.\n\nBurberry\u2019s show looked to the open air.

Models carried camping rucksacks, complete with rolled-up blankets. Some had umbrellas slotted behind the shoulder straps.\n\nTisci said he wanted to conjure up the mood of the progressive, open-air woodcraft groups that grew in popularity among young people in Britain in the 1920s, exploring alternative lifestyles centred around early environmental principles.\n\n\u201cIt is a part of British history that feels relevant now,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause in a way we\u2019ve been through a war too. After going through so much negativity there is a need to be outdoors, with the sun and the sky.\u201d\n\nHe had \u201cbeen learning the English way to dress\u201d at home in London during lockdown, he said. \u201cI used to be always in black T-shirt, jeans, white trainers. But I always loved the eccentric English way of dressing, and now I\u2019m wearing Birkenstocks and tracksuit bottoms and cashmere overcoats. There is so much character in the way British people dress in the street.\u201d\n\nMissing the \u201cpassion\u201d of a live fashion week, he is hoping that shows return next season. \u201cWe just have to wait and see what\u2019s allowed. But I\u2019m dreaming of doing a catwalk show in Trafalgar Square, or at Buckingham Palace,\u201d he joked.\n\nLondon fashion week is taking place in an increasingly fractious political atmosphere. Frustration is building within the industry about a lack of governmental support for businesses negotiating the costs, difficulties and time delays brought about by Brexit.\n\nTamara Cincik, the founder of the Fashion Roundtable thinktank, described the double whammy of the pandemic and Brexit as a perfect storm for British fashion.\n\nThe UK Fashion and Textile Association estimates that about three-quarters of Britain\u2019s clothing and textile exports, representing \u00a39.6bn in trade, go to the EU. Designers including Katherine Hamnett and Alice Temperley have reacted with exasperation to the culture secretary Oliver Dowden\u2019s suggestion that designers use their \u201cstar power\u201d to tackle the problems caused by Brexit.\n\nHamnett predicted that \u201cIf there isn\u2019t a radical overhaul, British brands will die\u201d.
