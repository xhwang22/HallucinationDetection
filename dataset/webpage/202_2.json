The man behind the Early American Room, George Hubbard Clapp, served as president of Pitt\u2019s Board of Trustees for 41 years. The 1877 alumnus also lends his name to a Pitt building. Clapp\u2019s ancestors arrived in what is now America in 1630, and the room represents his vision of settlers in Massachusetts.\n\nIt\u2019s also the only Nationality Room with two levels.\n\nThe space replicates the 17th-century New England home of an upper-class family. Two details stand out as class signifiers: the floor is made of wood as opposed to pressed-earth, and the windows have glass installed, a luxury item of the era. Renowned stained-glass artist Charles J. Connick designed the Early American Room\u2019s windows, as well as panes in the German Room and Pitt\u2019s Heinz Memorial Chapel.\n\nThe room is limited in its scope \u2014 for example, there\u2019s no evidence of Native Americans or indigenous people \u2014 and portrays a specific early American experience, but Nationality Rooms tour coordinator Michael Walter said it conveys universal values.\n\nSettlers had to adapt, he said, knowing the limitations of their new home and learning to prosper in that environment.\n\nKeep reading to learn more about the room\u2019s history and antiques, or schedule an in-person tour."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/george.clapp/2302796", "page_content": "George Clapp\n\nZoologist\n\nDecember 14, 1858 (age 90) Allegheny City, Pennsylvania , United States\n\nClapp took an engineering position at Park Brothers\" Black Diamond Steel Works.

The six-story Gothic Revival structure, designed by Trautwein & Howard, was completed in 1956 and serves as the primary facility of the University of Pittsburgh Department of Biological Sciences. It contains laboratories, classrooms, a greenhouse, and an amphitheater-style lecture hall with 404 seats.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe Ruskin Street side of Clapp Hall\n\nClapp Hall was designed by Trautwein & Howard, a successor to architectural firm of Charles Klauder who designed the university's gothic Cathedral of Learning, Stephen Foster Memorial, and Heinz Memorial Chapel.\n\nClapp Hall's exterior and interior spaces have been described as a mix of Collegiate Gothic and Art Deco. The building features a diagonally-positioned entrance that creates a direct axis with the Cathedral of Learning which is framed in Clapp Hall's stone portal entryway. The building is clad in textured Indiana limestone to match the stone used on the Cathedral of Learning. The building's use of aluminum windows has been suggested to be a quiet homage to the work of aluminum magnate George Hubbard Clapp, the building's namesake. The lobby of Clapp Hall is streamlined Art Deco in character, with terrazzo flooring and stainless steel doors, and is thus more stylistically modern than its exterior which is meant to reflect the Cathedral of Learning. It has been suggested that the lobby reveals a struggle in the design process to find a balance between the traditional gothic and more contemporary design elements.\n\nHistory\n\nGeorge Hubbard Clapp\n\nOriginal plans slated Clapp Hall to be built adjacent to the Cathedral of Learning facing the Masonic Temple, on the south side of Fifth Avenue, between the Cathedral and Heinz Memorial Chapel. Concerns over adding more buildings to the Cathedral of Learning lawn and impinging on the lawn's rare open space prompted a change to its current site across Fifth Avenue and effectively ended above-ground development of the Cathedral lawn space.\n\nThe 3-acre (12,000 m2) plot of land that Clapp Hall was constructed on was purchased for $675,000 ($6.8 million today) as a gift for the university by the A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust. Ground was broken for Clapp Hall in 1954 and the building was completed in 1956. The six-story building cost $2.5 million ($24.9 million today) and it was initially used only for freshman chemistry, although other sciences soon moved into the building. it is conjoined with Langley and Crawford Halls, which were added in later stages, and forms the three-building Clapp/Langley/Crawford Complex. The triangular courtyard at the southwest entry to Clapp Hall, facing the Cathedral of Learning, was modified in 2004 to accommodate trees and benches.\n\nThe building is named for George Hubbard Clapp (1858\u20131949), an alumnus (class of 1877) and president of Pitt's Board of Trustees for more than 40 years. Clapp was one of five responsible for the first commercial production of aluminum and was a founder of the Aluminum Company of America.\n\nUse\n\nThe six-story structure contains laboratories, classrooms, and an amphitheater-style lecture hall with 404 seats. A greenhouse, used mostly for teaching, is located on the fourth floor of Clapp Hall. Clapp Hall originally housed Pitt's Departments of Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Metallurgy, and Chemical Engineering.[3] Today the Department of Biological Sciences occupies the building."}, {"url": "https://db0nus869y26v.cloudfront.net/en/George_Hubbard_Clapp", "page_content": "George Hubbard Clapp (1858\u20131949) was an American pioneer in the aluminum industry and also a numismatist.\n\nHe was born on December 14 in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania, now a part of Pittsburgh, the son of Delia Dennig Hubbard and DeWitt Clinton Clapp, an iron company executive.
