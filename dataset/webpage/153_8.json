Two-time Olympic bronze medalist for Russia, Arkady Vyatchanin (now most likely representing Serbia), Olympic gold medalist for South Africa Roland Schoeman, and World Champion New Zealander Moss Burmester joined the 2004-Olympic bronze medalist in the Caribbean for a series of free clinics using swimming as a platform to both benefit and excite young athletes.\n\nThe \u201cGeorge Bovell Dive In Free Swim Clinics 2015\u201d were held at facilities in St. James, Macoya and San Fernando over January 15-17th, with the prestigious athletes teaching training methods, skills and drills with the purpose of not only encouraging the young attendees within the sport of swimming, but by also offering up hope and inspiration as they interacted and collaborated with the participants.\n\nBovell tells SwimSwam that, \u201cthe clinics were a huge success; you all can\u2019t imagine what it meant to those kids. It\u2019s an initiative that I try to put on every year to give back to and hopefully grow the sport here. It also serves to get the youth \u2018thinking big\u2019 and to help them understand that, through hard work, anything is possible.\u201d\n\nTo that end, while in the midst of ramping up his own training en route to this year\u2019s Pan American Games and World Championships, Bovell is monitoring the construction of the George Bovell Aquatic Center* taking shape in Couva, Trinidad (*name is not yet official). With the building\u2019s completion targeted for June 2015, Bovell hopes the country can offer the facility to Olympic teams to use for their Rio 2016 staging camps, especially with Trinidad\u2019s temperatures and time zone not far off Rio\u2019s mark.\n\nThis vision falls directly in line with what Bovell describes as his short- and long-term mission for the sport of swimming in Trinidad and Tobago. \u201cIn the next five years, I would love to see Trinidad and Tobago hosting regional and international swimming events and have all schools offer learn-to-swim classes as part of their curriculum so that the number of unnecessary drowning deaths annually will be significantly reduced.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in the 90\u2019s and pushing through the age group ranks with what Bovell has previously described as limited knowledge, resources and opportunities, he now feels compelled to contribute to the overall improvement of swimming on all levels. Bovell feels confident that, \u201cwith access to world-class facilities, world-class Trinidad swimmers will become the norm and not the exception.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://swimswam.com/george-bovell-lowers-50-breast-national-record-at-belgian-open-championships/", "page_content": "The 2015 Belgian Open Championships are underway in Antwerp, Belgium, and Trinidad & Tobago\u2019s George Bovell is making head lines.\n\nThe 31 year old is currently training in Italy and it is paying off.

He intends to compete in a record fifth Olympiad in Rio 2016, and gives his opinion on sport\u2019s drug testing regime.\n\nThe eerie light of the full moon shines through my window blinds as I lay my exhausted body down to sleep. I wonder if they will come to roust me awake again before the sun rises, come for my blood and demand me to do their irrefutable bidding. The banging on my door that heralds the arrival of these strangers of whom I can\u2019t refuse entry, has left me conditioned to sleep lightly and to assume that any early morning noise is them.\n\nI am not alone is suffering from this visiting affliction. It\u2019s the price that we must pay to compete at the top level of international Olympic sports. We submit ourselves to the random, out-of-competition drug testing of our blood and urine in the naive hope that we will be able to compete in a sport that is fair, and doping free.\n\nThe privilege of representing your country comes with great responsibility. In addition to the constant vigilance over the legal status of medications and supplements that are consumed (with many common ones being banned), an online database must be carefully kept up to date with our whereabouts, specifying where we can be found for one hour in each 24 as the spontaneity of life happens and our plans change from day to day.\n\nFor most of us, the hours of the early morning are our safest bet at predicting where we will be at that set time; at home in bed. However constant amends must be made for late nights out and expeditions that start in the early in the morning as the stakes are high. If the drug testers come looking for you and you are not at the stated location for the specified hour, and this happens three times in 18 months, it is considered a positive doping test result, requiring a minimum of a two-year ban.\n\nI have been subjected to constant random out of competition drug testing since 2001 as a result of being ranked among the World\u2019s top ten consistently for 14 years. Being randomly drug tested is both impersonal and uncomfortably intimate at the same time.\n\nOnce, I awoke horrified, into adrenaline fuelled survival mode instantly at the sight of a shadowy figure standing over over my girlfriend and I as we lay asleep early one morning. On that occasion, my roommate had answered the door and one creepy tester crept rudely into my room refusing to let me leave his sight, even to dress, horrifying my then girlfriend as he inquisitively stared around the room as I turned on the lamp. I felt violated!\n\nDrug testers are not supposed to get to know you, nor accept food or drink and must keep eyes on you at all times in order to make sure you don\u2019t consume any sort of masking agent before providing the necessary samples. Juxtaposed with how impersonal the random drug testers are is the fact that the tester collecting the sample must actually see the urine sample leave your naked body. That is easier to get used to than the needles in the veins that go with providing a blood sample.\n\nWe willingly submit to and endure the random, out-of-competition drug testing program\u2019s many inconveniences because we sincerely want to compete in a sport that\u2019s free from the cheaters who would steal our hard earned fruits of labour. However it\u2019s hard not to be cynical, especially for those fourth and ninth place finishers who have been robbed; and wonder if it\u2019s really even worth it when updating our whereabouts or providing our next sample. Cynicism is due to the common knowledge that Lance Amstrong, the reputed \u201cmost tested athlete ever\u201d and Marion Jones, the winner of 12 Olympic and World Championship medals, were doping for years yet never caught. And when doping athletes are actually caught but receive significantly reduced bans for co-operating or are deemed not responsible for the circumstances surrounding their doping and are handed down warnings instead, thus continuing to rob us.\n\n\u2022 This article originally appeared in George Bovell\u2019s regular column for the Trinidad & Tobago Guardian, \u2018Reflections off the water\u2019, on 7 April 2015.

One lap. Raw power and speed. First one to the other side is the man. Thirteen years ago, two Americans, Anthony Ervin and Gary Hall Jr., tied for the gold medal at the Sydney Olympics in the 50 free, in a time of 21.8 seconds.\n\nIn what may have been the most loaded 50 free field ever, Brazil's Cesar's Cielo rocked it Saturday night at the Palau Sant Jordi in 21.32 seconds. Afterward, he cried -- and cried -- on the medals stand, the tears redemption after knee surgery and validation of his standing as one of the all-time sprint greats. The crowd roared.\n\nThe time, the field, the race, all of it underscored how swimming keeps getting better and better. Indeed, this 50 free produced a new star, Russia's Vlad Morozov, who won silver, in 21.47, even as it re-charged the career of one of the sport's leading lights, George Bovell of Trinidad & Tobago, who won bronze in 21.51, the island nation's first-ever world-championships medal.\n\nThe 50 free highlighted a day and night of extraordinary racing.\n\nAmerican Katie Ledecky, for instance, set another world-record, her second here, in winning the women's 800, in 8:13.86. She is so good that runner-up Lotte Friis of Denmark applauded as Ledecky got out of the pool.\n\nLedecky's 800 marked her fourth gold here in Barcelona. She also won the 400, 1500 and took part in the 4x200 relay. She took six seconds off the world-record in the 1500. Her 400 time was an American record.\n\nWhen she gets home, she hopes to get her driver's license.\n\n\"I am thrilled,\" she said. \"I exceeded my expectations for this year.\"\n\nHer roommate at these worlds, Simone Manuel, who turned 17 on Friday, grabbed the final spot in the women's 50 free final Sunday by swimming 24.91; she is the first 18-and-under swimmer in U.S. history to break 25 seconds.\n\nMissy Franklin won her fifth gold medal Saturday, in the 200 backstroke, her signature event, in 2:04.76. She is the first woman since Australia's Libby Trickett to win five gold medals at a world championships, and swims Sunday in the medley relay for a sixth.\n\nNo female swimmer has ever won six gold medals at a world championships. Franklin could join Michael Phelps, Mark Spitz and Kristin Otto of East Germany as the only swimmers to win as many as six golds at the worlds or the Olympics. Otto won six golds at the 1988 Seoul Games.\n\nAsked about six, Franklin said it would \"mean so much to me\" but cautioned about the medley, \"Like every single race here, we are going to have very tough competition.\"\n\nIn the morning heats, Russia's Yulia Efimova set a world record in the women's 50 breaststroke, 29.78. The record lasted until the evening -- when Lithuania's Ruta Meilutyte went 29.48 in the semifinals.\n\nThe world records in the women's 50, 100 and 200 have all fallen at these 2013 championships -- stunning, because the plastic suits from 2008-09 were said to have helped the breaststroke most of all. The women's 50 breaststroke final is set for Sunday evening.\n\nRyan Lochte, the day after winning two medals and setting a personal best in the 100 fly semifinals, finished sixth in the men's 100 fly. South Africa's Chad le Clos, closing in the second lap just the way Phelps used to, won in 51.06.\n\n\"I don't know if it had an effect, the triple last night, but I just didn't have it,\" Lochte said.\n\nCielo for sure had it.\n\nHe won his third straight world championships title in the 50 free -- this despite surgery on both knees after the Olympics, and not even racing the 100 free.\n\nThe eight lanes of this 50 free final held three Olympic champions: Ervin, from 2000; Cielo, 2008; France's Florent Manaudou, 2012.\n\nAll eight guys had an Olympic medal. In all, there were 14 medals among the group -- seven gold, four silver, four bronze. Five of the eight had an individual medal.\n\nTo illustrate how the race has developed -- owing to advances in strength-training, straight-arm freestyle technique, a change in the racing blocks themselves and other factors -- Ervin finished Saturday in 21.65.\n\nHe took sixth.\n\n\"It happens,\" he said, adding, \"I just felt incredible yesterday. Things were a little bit apart from that when I was going through my routine today. So, you know, I don't attribute it to much other than things didn't line up perfectly. I didn't get the strike. I got the spare. Whatever.\"\n\nNathan Adrian, the London 100 gold medalist, finished fourth, in 21.6.\n\nHe said, \"21.6 would medal at most international competitions but the 50 was really fast this year,\" adding, \"I have been saying this all week: training has become so specific for every single event. Vlad and I were the only ones who swam the 100 and the 50. Look at the results from 2000, and that's not going to be the same. It has become so specific. The more you specialize, the better you can become at any particular event.\"\n\nIn the semis, Manaudou had gone 21.37. He looked like the man to beat.\n\nInstead, the race was all about Lanes 6, 7 and 8 -- Cielo, Morozov and Bovell.\n\nCielo had gone 21.76 in the prelims, then 21.6 in the semis.\n\nBut, as Cielo said late Saturday, there's a big difference between swimming the 50 and sprinting the 50. He reminded himself to swim \"fast and long, fast and long,\" and that's what he did, keeping his head down. his stroke long: \"When I saw the scoreboard, I was ecstatic. I had no idea where I was.\"\n\nMorozov, 21, moved to Southern California from Siberia when he was 14. He ripped up the NCAA championships this year swimming for USC, taking down no less than Cielo's record in the 100-yard sprint, then turned pro. He turned in a 47.62 in the 100 at the Summer University Games a few weeks back.\n\nHere, in the 100, he went out in the first 50 in 21.94 -- the first sub-22 split, ever, in any major international final. He finished fifth, in 48.01. \"I wish I didn't go out as fast,\" he said ruefully.\n\nIn the 50 prelims, he went 21.95. The semis, 21.63.\n\nIn this race, there was no back half to worry about. Just 50 meters.\n\nMorozov's 21.47 is a new national record -- beating the mark he set in the semis. He set it in front of Alex Popov, the former Russian sprint star -- who gave out the medals Saturday night.\n\n\"I'm really stoked with these medals,\" Morozov said, proving that seven years in SoCal is plenty long enough to learn to talk like a native. He also won a bronze medal as part of the 4x100 relay.\n\nMorozov, noting that this was his first long-course championships at which he was swimming individual events, added a moment later, \"To come here and get a silver medal already with guys who were in my heat -- they were already Olympic champions, world champions \u2026 I am really stoked with that. In 2016 I will do my best so that no one will be close to me.\"\n\nSprinters, it must be noted, do not as a general rule lack for confidence.\n\n\"He's going to give us a lot of trouble in the next years,\" Cielo said of Morozov, smiling.\n\nBovell, meanwhile, won a bronze medal in the 200 IM -- behind Phelps and Lochte -- in Athens in 2004. After that, he hurt his knee and could no longer swim the breaststroke.\n\nHe re-made himself into a sprinter. He turned 30 two weeks ago and, as he said, \"To be honest, when you get to be my age, there is some pressure to grow up, so to speak.\" A trip to these worlds without a medal, he said, would have put pressure on him to stop swimming competitively.\n\nNow, he said, he intends to keep on through Rio. \"I love swimming,\" he said. \"I did not want to give it up.\""}, {"url": "https://newsday.co.tt/2021/07/07/kelly-ann-baptiste-joins-george-bovell-iii-as-most-capped-trinidad-and-tobago-olympian/", "page_content": "Kelly-Ann Baptiste joins George Bovell III as most capped Trinidad and Tobago Olympian\n\nKelly Ann Baptiste -\n\nWOMEN\u2019S track and field sprinter Kelly-Ann Baptiste will join legendary swimmer George Bovell III as the most capped TT Olympian, as she is set to make her fifth appearance at the 2020 Tokyo Games, from July 23-August 8.\n\nA media release by the TT Olympic Committee (TTOC) on Wednesday, said, \u201cBovell made five consecutive appearances starting with the 2000 Sydney Olympics followed by his historic bronze medal effort at the 2004 Athens Games (in the 200-metre individual medley), team TTO\u2019s sole medal for that edition of the Olympics.\u201d\n\nBovell III did not let an injury deter him from continuing his swimming career as he switched focus to another event.\n\n\u201cAfter an ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) injury in September 2004, Bovell was forced to change his specialty from the endurance-testing 200m individual medley to the 50m freestyle dash.

TTOC president Brian Lewis hinted that TT may make history by naming its first women\u2019s flag-bearer for the opening ceremony.\n\n\"To date, the TTOC has never had a female flag-bearer at the opening ceremony of a Summer Olympic Games,\" Lewis said.\n\n\"It is my sincere hope that a female athlete will be chosen by the chef de mission Lovie Santana to carry the TT flag during the opening ceremony in Tokyo 2020.\"\n\nTT will have Santana, the experienced TTOC senior administrative officer, at the helm while TTOC project officer, athletes services and programmes, Rheeza Grant will serve as TT's covid19 liaison officer. TT will also rely on a strong medical staff of nine led by Dr Rudranath Ramsawak.\n\nAfter the Games were rescheduled due to the pandemic, Lewis said, \"The TTOC acknowledges the perseverance, dedication and determination of every athlete who tried their best to qualify for the covid19 pandemic impacted games, the first Olympic Games in history to be postponed.\"\n\nThis year's Olympic Games also hold special significance for the TTOC as it coincides with its 75-year anniversary."}, {"url": "https://dbpedia.org/page/George_Bovell", "page_content": "George Bovell (* 18.

Er gewann f\u00fcr sein Land im Jahr 2004 eine olympische Bronzemedaille und ist damit bis heute der erfolgreichste karibische Schwimmsportler. Sein Schwimmtalent wurde ihm offenbar in die Wiege gelegt, sein Vater George war College-Schwimmer und seine Mutter eine Langstrecken-L\u00e4uferin, die bei den Olympischen Spielen 1972 und 1976 f\u00fcr Barbados und Kanada startete. Sein Bruder nahm als Schwimmer bei den Olympischen Spielen 2008 teil. Seinen ersten gro\u00dfen internationalen Erfolg konnte George Bovell bei den Schwimmweltmeisterschaften 2001 in Fukuoka feiern, wo er \u00fcber seine Spezialstrecke 200 m Lagen in 2:01,50 Minuten den vierten Platz erreichte. Zwei Jahre sp\u00e4ter bei den Schwimmweltmeisterschaften 2003 in Barcelona konnte er zwar seine Zeit \u00fcber diese Strecke auf 2:00,06 Minuten verbessern, dennoch reichte es dort nur f\u00fcr einen f\u00fcnften Platz. Bei den Panamerikanischen Spielen 2003 in Santo Domingo konnte er dann zweimal Gold \u00fcber 200 m Freistil und 200 m Lagen sowie zweimal Silber \u00fcber 100 m Freistil und 100 m R\u00fccken erringen. Damit erlangte er allein vier der sieben Medaillen f\u00fcr Trinidad und Tobago bei den Spielen und dabei die einzigen beiden Goldmedaillen.

Von der Silbermedaille trennten ihn dabei gerade mal zwei Hundertstel Sekunden. Seine Medaille war f\u00fcr die Karibik die erste Medaille im Schwimmen bei Olympischen Spielen \u00fcberhaupt und die einzige f\u00fcr sein Land in Athen. Insgesamt war er der neunte Athlet, der f\u00fcr Trinidad und Tobago eine Medaille bei Olympischen Spielen holen konnte, die weiteren Medaillengewinner waren in der Leichtathletik und im Gewichtheben erfolgreich. Mit einer Zeit von 1:53,93 Minuten konnte er am 25. M\u00e4rz 2004 bei den NCAA-Meisterschaften 2004 in einen neuen Kurzbahn-Weltrekord \u00fcber 200 m Lagen aufstellen.
