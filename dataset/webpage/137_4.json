{"Paul Taylor began playing guitar at the age of 12.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Paul-Taylor-choreographer", "page_content": "Paul Taylor, in full Paul Belville Taylor, (born July 29, 1930, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, U.S.\u2014died August 29, 2018, New York, New York), American modern dancer and choreographer noted for the inventive, frequently humorous, and sardonic dances that he choreographed for his company.\n\nEntering Syracuse University in 1947 on a scholarship, Taylor took painting classes and joined the swim team. He began dance training in 1951 and subsequently studied modern dance at Juilliard with Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, and Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n and ballet with Antony Tudor and Margaret Craske. He began his professional career in 1953 with Martha Graham\u2019s company, creating such important roles as Aegisthus in Clytemnestra (1958), Hercules in Alcestis (1960), and Theseus in Phaedra (1962). He also performed in works by other modern choreographers, including those of Charles Weidman and Merce Cunningham. He danced a solo created for him by George Balanchine in Episodes (1959), a work choreographed by Balanchine and Graham to music by Anton Webern.\n\nAs a choreographer, Taylor utilized a wide variety of movement styles, some of which he described as \u201cflat\u201d (two-dimensional in appearance), \u201cdance scribbling\u201d (emphasis on action rather than on shape or line), and \u201clyric\u201d (\u201clong arms\u201d). His avant-garde works ranged from Duet (1957), in which he and his partner remained motionless for four minutes, to Orbs (1966), an hour-long composition to Beethoven\u2019s last string quartets. Other well-known dances included Three Epitaphs (1956), Aureole (1962), Scudorama (1963), The Book of Beasts (1971), Esplanade and Runes (1975), Cloven Kingdom (1976), Aphrodisiamania (1977), Airs (1978), Nightshade (1979), and Le Sacre du Printemps (1980). His Aureole entered the repertoires of such major ballet troupes as the Paris Op\u00e9ra Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet.\n\nTaylor\u2019s company, established in 1954 and usually numbering 13 dancers, first performed in Europe in 1960, toured South America in 1965 under the International Cultural Exchange Program of the U.S. State Department, and in 1978 toured the U.S.S.R. and appeared on the U.S. public-television network. Taylor also choreographed for the Spoleto (Italy) Festival of Two Worlds and won several prestigious awards. He withdrew from performing in the 1970s."}, {"url": "https://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/les-paul", "page_content": "One would be hard-pressed to find a guitar fan unfamiliar with the name Les Paul, who not only established himself as a renowned, pacesetting musician with a signature sound, but also contributed a number of advances in guitar design and recording processes, most notably with his invention of the solid-body electric guitar.\n\nBorn Lester William Polsfuss in Waukesha, Wisc., on June 9, 1915, he was hooked on music at an early age and sang for local organizations as a preschooler. As a child, Paul took piano lessons and taught himself how to play the harmonica, guitar, and banjo. He also had a natural curiosity and ability with things mechanical in nature and enjoyed making his own improvements to musical instruments. He built a recording machine with parts from an automobile and a dentist drill, as well as an amplifier made from radio and telephone components. As a high school student, Paul began experimenting with solid body electric guitars.\n\nAt the age of 13, Paul was performing semi-professionally. In high school, he joined a traveling band by the name of \u201cRube Tronson's Cowboys,\u201d where he went by the stage moniker \u201cRed Hot Red.\u201d The band was comprised of adults and was sponsored by Chicago\u2019s WLS radio. Paul dropped out of school to perform as \u201cRhubarb Red\u201d with Wolverton's Radio Band at a station in St. Louis, Mo., where he worked with and was mentored by the talented Sunny Joe Wolverton. He relocated to Chicago and began performing jazz music as \u201cLes Paul\u201d in 1934, while continuing to play as Rhubarb Red on the radio. He assembled his first trio in 1937 and released his first two albums. Next, he moved to New York with his then-wife, Virginia Webb Paul, and became known as a performer on radio broadcasts of Fred Waring's Pennsylvanians until 1941. In 1943, he moved to Los Angeles, where he made a name for himself with a new group, the Les Paul Trio, and performed with big-time entertainers, including Nat King Cole and Bing Crosby.\n\nBy the 1930s, electric versions of hollow-body guitars had become widely available, and although Paul tried playing them, he was unsatisfied with the existing models. He was convinced that a solid body model was a viable concept and that this design would produce a better sound with reduced feedback and better sustainability for notes and chords. He built his first prototype, called \u201cthe rail\u201d out of a piece of rail from a train track when he was in high school. Ten years later, while living in New York, he created a more advanced prototype out of a 4\u201d x 4\u201d piece of wood and an Epiphone guitar neck that he called \u201cthe Log.\u201d He performed with his own specially designed guitars, but at the time, guitar companies showed little interest in creating a solid body electric guitar. He approached the Gibson Musical Instrument Co. with his designs in the early 1940s, but the company was doing well with its arched, hollow-body electric models, and so, it rejected his proposals.\n\nPaul was encouraged to press on by others in the business, including fellow inventors, Leo Fender, and Paul Bigsby. Bing Crosby convinced him to set up his own studio and record his own masters. He began experimenting with recording devices en route to his breakthrough development of the concept of multi-track recording, which allowed musicians to play and record multiple parts of a song. In February 1948, Capitol Records released \"Lover (When You're Near Me),\u201d the first-ever multi-track recording release, featuring Paul playing eight different parts on the electric guitar. He played six parts himself in his 1948 hit, \"Brazil,\u201d from the alternate side of the same record. In 1953, he and recording partner Mary Ford, whom he had married in 1949, released their hit, a cover of \"How High the Moon,\" which sold 1.5 million copies. Paul worked on perfecting the multi-track recording system until 1957, and the music industry has relied heavily on the multi-track system for studio recording ever since.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1951, Leo Fender released a solid-body electric guitar called \u201cthe Broadcaster,\u201d and competition inspired Gibson to seek Paul\u2019s help in launching a comparable product. A collaboration employing Paul\u2019s original ideas led to the 1952 launch of Gibson\u2019s \u201cLes Paul Model,\u201d which was an incredible success and has been subsequently used by musicians around the world. Ted McCarty, a member of Gibson, was issued U.S. patent No. 3,018,680 for the Solid Body Electric Guitar in 1955, although Paul contributed a great deal to the solid-body design. Paul\u2019s innovations went far beyond the solid-body guitar and multi-track system. His musical breakthroughs include sound-on-sound recording, overdubbing, reverb effects, and the use of the echo chambers, which are still used today. His ideas are said to have helped define the blues rock-and-roll sound of the late 1960s and 1970s and to have helped drive style for recording artists in rock, blues, country, alternative, and metal music well into the 1990s and beyond.\n\nAfter dozens of hit albums and musical milestones, Paul went into semi-retirement in 1964 but returned to the scene several times in later years for recordings with Chet Atkins in 1976 and the Guitar Monsters in 1978, followed by regular trio performances in New York City from 1984 up until two months before his death. He has been honored with a number of awards for his achievements, including his 1979 induction, with Ford, into the Grammy Hall of Fame, induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2005. He was also awarded the John Smithson Bicentennial Medal from the Smithsonian Institution in 1996.\n\nPaul died on August 12, 2009 in White Plains, NY. The Les Paul Foundation was established to inspire innovative and creative thinking by sharing the legacy of Les Paul through supporting music education, engineering and innovation as well as medical research."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/31/paul-taylor-modern-dance", "page_content": "In the world of dance, the death of choreographer Paul Taylor marks not only the end of a long and productive career \u2013 he put together his first dance company in 1954 and his last work (147th) premiered in March 2018 \u2013 but it also feels like the end of an era. The history of American modern dance might go something like this: first came Isadora Duncan, casting off the corsetry of European ballet; then there was Martha Graham, high priestess of mythic psychodrama and female pelvic power; then Merce Cunningham rose to become the zen master of choreographic abstraction; and after that everything went postmodern and there was no centre any more. But right before that came Paul Taylor, who danced with both Graham and Cunningham before venturing forth himself \u2013 and so represents the last of a historic line.\n\nHe was never as iconic as those two grand masters: they were tenaciously single-minded while he was omnivorous and eclectic; they changed the game, he was more interested in playing his own. His early years certainly look wilfully mischievous. After some attractive but conventional early works, in 1957 he presented an evening of dance that included a minimalist solo with a speaking clock, another where his \u201cset design\u201d was a dog called Duchess, who kept upstaging him by sidling around; a four-minute duet with no movement and a silent score which provoked a now legendary example of dance criticism: four column inches of blank space. Graham called Taylor a \u201cnaughty boy\u201d, which thrilled him, but the audience walked out, which didn\u2019t.\n\nSyzygy\n\nWas he just ahead of his time? If that evening had come even five years later, it might have fitted right in with the Cunningham-influenced experimentalists of the Judson Dance Theater, who were to change dance history in the 60s. Indeed, in a 1982 interview with Jennifer Dunning, Taylor quipped that he, not Cunningham, was actually the father of the Judson, it was just that \u201ceveryone left before the concert was over\u201d. Whatever the case, Taylor\u2019s history took a very different course. \u201cI got back to making dances of a more kinetic approach,\u201d he recalled. \u201cTo everyone\u2019s relief, the dancers began to move all over the place.\u201d\n\nA scene from Le Sacre du Printemps by Paul Taylor Dance Company at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, in 2000. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian\n\nTaylor never invented a dance technique, as Graham and Cunningham did, but he did have a very distinctive physical style. It\u2019s no surprise that before he began dancing, at the late age of 22, Taylor was a swimmer. You see it not only in the full-bodied physicality of his dancers \u2013 the Taylor women are typically strong and athletic, and his men are famously as beefy as quarterbacks \u2013 but also in the quality of their movement: open arms curve and stretch over weighty, driving steps; the spine is supple and twisting, and there\u2019s much more interest in flow and action than in gesture and declamation. Watch the Taylor dancers and you almost feel the air not as space but as a denser, more resistant medium through which they dip, cut, arc and plunge.\n\nThat\u2019s the style, what about the substance? Taylor was an inveterate observer, and would often find movements through watching people: \u201calso animals and bugs, and anything that moves.\u201d A vagrant\u2019s tic was incorporated into the violently dystopian Last Look, George W Bush\u2019s walk appeared in Banquet of Vultures, and the exuberant Esplanade was said to have been inspired by seeing a woman running for a bus.\n\nLast Look trailer\n\nAs for subjects, he was entirely omnivorous. Some of his most widely performed works are full of sunny lyricism, as easy on the ear as they are on the eye: Aureole, Airs, Arden Court. But billed right next to them you\u2019d find something as brutal as Big Bertha, in which a family outing to a fairground ends with rape and murder \u2013 one of many works in which Taylor burned through the many masks of human civility. Or there\u2019s the romantic melancholy of Sunset, the simultaneously chipper and biting Americana of Company B, the galactic abstraction of Syzygy, the downbeat humour of Three Epitaphs \u2026 It might be quicker to say simply: all life is there.\n\n\n\nEsplanade\n\nAll that says what kind of choreographer Taylor was; but it doesn\u2019t explain the genius, the spark; not even the sureness of his craft, and ultimately, I don\u2019t know how to do that. All I can say is that some of his works remain landmarks in my dance-going. Piazzolla Caldera takes the cliches of tango and brilliantly exposes the human ambivalence behind them. It\u2019s a very long time since I\u2019ve seen Syzygy, but I still remember its cosmic rush. And of course, there is my all-time favourite, Esplanade \u2013 a work of art that looks entirely artless, is choreographed from movement not from dance, and feels just like being alive.\n\nAh, perhaps that\u2019s it. It feels just like being alive."}, {"url": "https://www.historylink.org/File/7479", "page_content": "At the dawn of the 1930s a radical new class of musical instrument -- electrified and amplified -- was introduced to the world by a few pioneering companies across America. And although electric guitars would prove in time to be a revolutionary agent of change in music, initially the invention lacked an urgent marketplace demand. Indeed, it would take years for musicians to cozy up to the new-fangled contraptions, and even longer for general musical tastes to make room for their odd sounds. Among the very first to take on the mighty challenge of popularizing electric guitars right in the middle of the Great Depression was the Seattle musician/inventor, Paul Tutmarc, and his Audiovox Manufacturing Company.\n\nThe Silver-Toned Tenor\n\nPaul H. Tutmarc joined his church choir as a child, and by the age of 12 was earning money by singing and playing guitar and banjo in order to help his Minneapolis-based family make ends meet. Tutmarc started playing Hawaiian-style steel guitar when he was 15, and eventually hit the road traveling with a vaudeville troupe on the Chautauqua circuit.\n\nIn 1917 Tutmarc rolled into Seattle to work at the shipyards and soon found steady work, first out in the rough-and-tumble Pacific coast town of Aberdeen, and finally in Centralia, where he and his wife, Lorraine, began raising a daughter and son, Jeanne and Paul \"Bud\" Tutmarc Jr.\n\nSeeking out opportunities to sing and perform music, by 1926 Tutmarc was being touted on Tacoma's KMO radio as the \"Silver Toned Tenor\" and he began making appearances with Sam Wineland's Broadway Orchestra at Tacoma's Broadway Theater. Then, after moving to Seattle in 1928, Tutmarc began to perform on KJR radio and on the Orpheum, Pantages theatrical circuits, and with the Fanchon and Marco troupe.\n\nIt's A Great Life\n\nBy 1929 Tutmarc had begun working the Seattle theaters as a tenor soloist with a number of the top dance orchestras, including those of Jackie Souders, Jules Buffano, and the town's premiere bandleader, Vic Meyers. That same year he was singing at the 5th Avenue Theater (and on KGW radio) with Georgie Stoll's Syncopaters. Stoll was also Mario Lanza's musical director and he lured Tutmarc to Hollywood where Tutmarc ended up singing in two moving pictures, probably MGM's It's A Great Life and The Voice of Hollywood that starred the fabulous Duncan Sisters.\n\nBack in Seattle, Tutmarc established a guitar instruction studio in his home, and then in 1931, moved into a downtown studio in the Fox 5th Avenue Theater building. By this time the dapper Tutmarc had become a true bon vivant around town and once had the unforgettable experience of singing \"There's Danger In Your Eyes\" to the visiting movie star, Jean Harlow, while suavely whisking her around a theater stage. With the rising strength of the Hawaiian music craze, Tutmarc's advanced skill at playing Hawaiian steel guitar made his new group, the Islanders, a popular feature at house parties, ballrooms, and other venues around the region.\n\nMagnetic Northwest\n\nIt was the winter of 1930-1931, according to his son, that Tutmarc began experimenting in his basement workshop with a fellow tinkerer on a secret project. Tutmarc's collaborator was Arthur \"Art\" J. Stimson, a jack-of-all-trades from Spokane, Washington, who'd worked as an auto mechanic and an aerial photographer. Together the two -- each inspired by the telephone's mechanism -- created a large mutant version of Ma Bell's dinky transducer. They attached an iron blade with copper wire coiled around it to a large horseshoe shaped magnet. When placed inside Tutmarc's flat-top Spanish-style guitar and plugged into a converted radio, the magnetic device picked-up the instrument's sound, amplified it, and surprised the partners with the beautiful tone it brought forth.\n\nThe two partners soon realized the importance of their discovery, but they differed on the next step to take. Stimson wanted to sell or license the \"pickup\" to some big company, while Tutmarc thought it best to quietly seek protective registration for its design with the federal Office of Patents. Unfortunately after investing $300 with attorneys who initiated a patent search with the government, Tutmarc was ultimately advised that their pickup design was non-patentable because the telephone companies had already patented similar devices.\n\nA disappointed Tutmarc put his electric guitar dreams on hold, while Stimson, apparently, headed off to Los Angeles where he said he was going to try to interest others in the idea.\n\nOne can imagine the shock then when Tutmarc -- a music teacher, shopkeeper, and dealer of instruments -- eventually took notice after a Los Angeles-based firm began selling their \"Electro String Instruments\" in August 1932. That company (eventually known as Rickenbacker International Corp.) was headed by a skilled engineer, Adolph Rickenbacher, whose machine shop had been fabricating metal parts for two of the town's successful guitar-making firms, the National String Instrument Corp. and the related Dobro Manufacturing Co. since about 1928.\n\nThen, in the spring of 1933, the Dobro firm began marketing their All-Electric model of electrified Spanish-style guitar and Tutmarc must have wondered how these companies could be pushing products without patent protections. Little did he know that Dobro had actually filed (on April 7th, 1933) a patent application form -- not for the pickup alone, but in conjunction with the overall guitar design. What Tutmarc learned, in time, was that Dobro's patent application actually listed one \"Art Stimson\" as the assignor. Worse yet: Tutmarc's erstwhile partner had apparently peddled their pickup design to Dobro for the measly sum of $600.\n\nThe Audiovox Manufacturing Co.\n\nCasting caution aside, Tutmarc finally forged ahead marketing his own brand of electric guitars. Though a bit late to the race now, Tutmarc became ever more determined to create a superior electric guitar and, through more experimentation, vastly improved his old design, effectively creating the world's first slanted split-polepiece magnetic \"humbucking\" pickup -- a design that Dobro, National, and other firms soon began emulating.\n\nIn 1934 Tutmarc relocated his shop to the Western Laboratories Building (806 Pine Street) -- conveniently located above the Birkel Electrical Supply Co., and just down the block from the grand Paramount Theater -- and soon formalized his guitar building enterprise as the Audiovox Manufacturing Company. Over time the Audiovox line of electric lap steel guitars earned a reputation amongst players for having powerful-yet-clean pickup sounds and Tutmarc established friendships with some of the era's top steel guitarists including: Sol \"The King of the Hawaiian Guitar\" Ho'opi'i, Dick Kaihue McIntire, and Frankie McPhalen.\n\nTutmarc himself was Audiovox's best promoter, and in addition to selling instruments to his students and working musicians, he consigned them to a few other regional music shops, and captivated listeners with daily \"Free Concert Demonstrations\" at his shop and at other downtown stores including the Sears, Roebuck & Co. department store and Myers Music store, and on his weekly KOMO radio show.\n\nIn February 1935, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer discovered Tutmarc and ran a photograph showing him with his latest invention -- an electrified, cello-sized, solid-bodied bass instrument -- and noted that \"People have always pitied the poor bass-fiddler ... who has to lug his big bull-fiddle home through the dark streets after the theatre closes. But he doesn't have to do it any more. Because Paul Tutmarc, Seattle music teacher and KOMO radio artist, has invented an electric bull-fiddle. One you can carry under your arm ... . The first electric bass-viol is only four feet tall, instead of six. It could be made a lot smaller, but Tutmarc didn't want to be too revolutionary right off the bat. Bass violinists are a conservative race, and have to be accustomed gradually to the idea, he says.\"\n\nFalling Through the Cracks of History\n\nWhen Audiovox finally produced Tutmarc's next invention -- the #736 Electronic Bass Fiddle -- the refined instrument's main innovation was as a string-bass instrument designed to be held in the now-familiar horizontal position rather than the traditional vertical upright position. So because of its electrified nature, fretted neck (unlike upright basses), and truly compact size, this revolutionary instrument can be considered the world's first solid-body electric bass guitar.\n\nHowever, even though Audiovox sold numerous Electronic Bass Fiddles to Northwest musicians, the instrument was so completely ahead-of-its-time that it never succeeded commercially. So, despite the trail-blazing uniqueness of Audiovox instruments, relatively few were sold, no national distribution strategy was ever implemented, and Tutmarc's contributions basically fell through the cracks of history. All of which helps explain why the Audiovox saga went missing in all of the early electric guitar history books, and other men -- like Fullerton, California's Leo Fender (who first marketed his famously successful bass guitar in 1951) -- long received all the credit for \"inventing\" the electric bass.\n\nOne additional factor was Tutmarc's failure to focus on promoting his inventions. Instead, he devoted much time to his shop, his students, his other hobbies, his church, and performing live. In 1943 the Tutmarc marriage broke up, and in 1944 he married one of his young guitar students, Bonnie Buckingham (1923-2019), and they began playing country music at rural dancehalls, urban nightclubs, and on local radio as a duo, or with either a trio or a full band, KVI radio's K6 Wranglers.\n\nDark Moon\n\nTutmarc continued to market his Audiovox guitars up until around 1950 -- when daughter Paula was born -- but by mid-decade that marriage was straining under the weight of Bonnie's dreams of stardom (the movie star Rudy Vallee and other Hollywood bigwigs were showing interest in her) and it also eventually ended in divorce.\n\nBonnie soon adopted the stage name of Bonnie Guitar and in 1957 her Top-10 gem, \"Dark Moon,\" launched a long string of national hits that made her the most successful country star ever to hail from the Pacific Northwest. Meanwhile, Tutmarc carried on performing until around 1966-1967, and continued teaching nearly up until his death from cancer on September 23, 1972.\n\nRock 'n' roll Guitars\n\nYet, the question remains: Given Tutmarc's early head-start over most of the other \"Fathers of the Electric Guitar,\" just exactly why did he receive such a paucity of recognition for his contributions? It would seem that a combination of bad advice from patent attorneys and his own unfocused business activities led to the Audiovox brand being overshadowed by a whole slew of other, subsequent, companies -- mega-successful corporate guitar makers like Fender and Gibson who've received tons of credit in myriad guitar history books for helping give birth to the twentieth century's most popular form of music, rock 'n' roll.\n\nNo fan of rock music himself, Tutmarc apparently harbored thoughts somewhat akin to those conceivably held by guilt-stricken creators of the atomic bomb -- \"Just look at what my invention hath wrought on humankind!\" -- because in an April 1972 newspaper interview he pondered his role in history and wearily conceded that \"A lot of fathers and mothers probably would like to kill me.\" But, perhaps in an attempt to ease the heavy burden of responsibility for having aided the rise of rock 'n' roll, Tutmarc also allowed himself that, \"Then again, if it hadn't been me, it would have been someone else\" (Duncan)."}, {"url": "https://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Taylor/+wiki", "page_content": "The name \"Paul Taylor\" is used for (at least) three different artists:\n\n(1) Paul Taylor - Jazz Musician\n\nPaul Taylor (born April 30, 1960) is an American smooth jazz saxophonist who has released eight albums since his debut On the Horn in 1995. He is signed to Peak Records. Although originally from Denver, Colorado, he is based in Las Vegas, Nevada. He also played as a special guest with the Rippingtons for a short time in 1999 and 2000, after Jeff Kashiwa left the group and before Eric Marienthal joined them.\n\nHe collaborated with many R&B vocalists such as LaToya London, Regina Belle, and Terry Dexter.\n\n\n\nExpanding upon the sensuous and romantic smooth jazz vibe that has made him one of the genre\u2019s most dynamic saxophonists, Paul Taylor makes his fourth Peak Records release a true Ladies\u2019 Choice; creating his most soulful instrumental tracks ever and keeping company with three of today\u2019s most acclaimed female R&B vocalists\u2014Regina Belle, La Toya London and Terry Dexter.\n\nCapturing all of the soulful grooves, dazzling melodies and seductive magic that have become his trademark, Ladies\u2019 Choice perfectly reflects the incredible synergy the charismatic Taylor has had for over a decade with his devoted audience, and takes his music to a whole new urban adult contemporary dimension. The collection is also the sax man\u2019s third in a row\u2014after 2003\u2019s Steppin\u2019 Out and 2005\u2019s Nightlife\u2013to feature tracks helmed by veteran R&B/jazz producers Barry Eastmond (Al Jarreau, Regina Belle, Jonathan Butler, Anita Baker) and Rex Rideout (Richard Elliot, Gerald Albright, Boney James, Najee). The title was inspired by a special moment that happened every night at clubs throughout the country in the 70s. The DJ would stop the music, take the mike and declare the next song to be \u201cLadies\u2019 Choice\u201d\u2014an invitation for the ladies to pick the guys they want to dance with.\n\n\u201cWhen I first got into the studio with Barry at his place in New York, we started completely from scratch and had no idea that the exciting Ladies\u2019 Choice idea would emerge,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cGenerally, he\u2019ll have some tracks worked up and I\u2019ll start with some melodic ideas and take it from there. When we listened back to the first song we wrote, its cool thumping old school vibe just reminded me of those 70s disco nights and the title \u2018Ladies\u2019 Night\u2019 just hit me as the right title to convey the blend of retro-soul, romantic music and contemporary edges we were going for. Once we had established this concept, we expanded on it by including songs sung by some of my favorite female artists. I\u2019ve included vocal tracks before on my recordings, but these ladies are taking my music to a whole new level.\u201d\n\nEastmond (who produced seven tracks), Rideout (four) and Taylor are all good friends, and Taylor\u2019s two producers have a friendly competition going each time the sax man asks them to come on board. \u201cThey want to know who\u2019s going to do the most tracks,\u201d Taylor laughs, \u201cand who\u2019s going to win out\u2014Barry, whom Rex calls \u2018the king of urban AC,\u2019 or Rex, whose trademark is creating subtle accompaniment that lets me grow and do my thing. I have a dynamic chemistry with both, and each in their own way brings out the essence of what I do with my melodies.\n\nI know their tracks and soundscapes are going to be amazing, and I look forward to what we\u2019re going to come up with together.\u201d The first five Eastmond-produced cuts on Ladies\u2019 Choice include the title track, \u201cHere We Go\u201d and \u201cStreamline,\u201d three co-writes by Eastmond and Taylor that blend old school soul atmospheres, bouncing bass grooves and the saxophonist\u2019s dashing flair for horn texturing. Taylor\u2019s powerful alto coloring and solo complement London\u2019s passionate voice on the dreamy late night ballad \u201cI Want To Be Loved By You\u201d; his alto also sways behind Belle\u2019s playful and sassy vocals on the crisp, sparsely arranged romance \u201cHow Did You Know\u201d (which she co-wrote with Eastmond).\n\nEastmond\u2019s other tracks include another lush Belle penned ballad, \u201cOpen Your Eyes,\u201d which features a searing vocal/sax duet energy; and the sweet and breezy, old school-vibin\u2019 \u201cSummer\u2019s End.\u201d Rideout produced the other two incredible vocals on Ladies\u2019 Choice, the sensuous, almost mystical \u201cLong Distance Relationship,\u201d which features beautiful voice texturing behind the lead of Terry Dexter, and the mid-tempo and brassy, classic blues and soul flavored \u201cA Love Of Your Own\u201d (a cover of an Average White Band classic) with vocalist Lauren Evans; Evans also co-wrote \u201cLong Distance Relationship\u201d with Rideout and guitarist Darrell Crooks. Rideout also helmed the sizzling, hard-edged disco-fied \u201cOverdrive\u201d and the funky; horn inflected closer \u201cPoint Of View.\u201d\n\nA native of Denver, Taylor has lived and worked in the thriving musical environment of Las Vegas since graduating as a music performance major from UNLV. He began playing sax at age seven and discovered his true calling while playing in a local high school garage band called Mixed Company, which played Top 40, funk and Crusader-styled fusion. Aiming to build his resume beyond the many dues-paying Vegas lounge gigs that marked his early professional life, he commuted often to Los Angeles and hooked up in the late 80s with (his later producer) Dino Esposito. Taylor did one of Esposito\u2019s sessions at Jeff Lorber's home studio; a few years later, in 1994, the popular keyboardist remembered Taylor and asked him to play with him at the Catalina Island Jazz Trax Festival. Popular keyboardist Keiko Matsui and her producer/husband Kazu liked Taylor\u2019s charismatic performance and soon offered him an audition with their band. He recorded and toured with the Matsuis for two years (appearing on Sapphire and Dream Walk), and Kazu Matsui eventually produced the sax man\u2019s debut On The Horn, which spawned the #1 radio hit \u201cTill We Meet Again.\u201d Taylor quickly found his own niche in the smooth jazz world, and his quick but well deserved popularity led Pleasure Seeker to the top of the radio charts. The #1 title track was one of Radio & Records most played genre cuts of the year.\n\nAlthough Taylor has since been one of the genre's most popular live attractions as a solo artist, he eagerly accepted Russ Freeman\u2019s invitation to tour with The Rippingtons as a special guest artist in 2000\u2014the year he released his third album Undercover\u2013after Jeff Kashiwa left the group. After making his Peak debut with 2001\u2019s Hypnotic, Taylor\u2019s career reached a fever pitch in 2004 when \u201cSteppin\u2019 Out,\u201d the title track from his 2003 Top Ten Billboard Contemporary Jazz album, became Radio & Records\u2019 third biggest genre airplay cut of the year. He also toured as a featured performer with the all-star \u201cGroovin\u2019 For Grover\u201d lineup (including Jeff Lorber, Richard Elliot and Gerald Albright) and performed and made his acting debut on the legendary ABC soap opera One Life To Live. The incredible momentum continued with his 2005 release Nightlife, Taylor\u2019s latest to hit the Top Five of Billboard\u2019s Contemporary Jazz Chart. After participating in Norman Brown\u2019s Summer Storm II tour in 2006, the saxophonist began 2007 aboard the Brian Culbertson All-Star Smooth Jazz Cruise as a featured headlining performer.\n\nThis year, he is looking forward to sharing numerous tour dates with Regina Belle. \u201cFor me, the whole music making process begins with me in a room with the sax, writing melodies from the heart,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cIn addition to working with Barry and Rex again, it\u2019s been a great experience to work with these incredible ladies. The best part of this project was just being able to get in the studio and do it. It\u2019s easy to take this journey for granted, but I\u2019m grateful to be alive to share the music that\u2019s in my heart with the fans. I feel very lucky that I\u2019ve been able to make it happen for so long.\u201d\n\nOne of the high points of Taylor\u2019s live performances is the segment when he invites a handful of excited female fans onstage to sway along with him as he plays his hit song \u201cDeeper.\u201d With Ladies\u2019 Choice, the sweet ongoing seduction goes deeper still!\n\n(2) Paul Taylor - Psytrance DJ\n\nAlready well known internationally as a DJ with a unique ability to source and play the freshest sounds, Paul\u0081fs credentials are well documented. A veteran from Goa parties since the mid nineties, he was quickly noticed by TIP records and joined in 2001 as a label DJ along with Dimitri Nakov and Raja Ram. After two years in the London Tip Office, he then relocated to Ibiza where he soon began to co produce music with artists such as Earthling, Shanti and Bushman.\n\nIn 2002 he joined Spun Records as Ibiza label manager and A&R/DJ, compiling the very well received Spun Complilation: Tweakers\u0081. A regular at many of the bigger events in Europe, Mexico, South America, Israel and Japan, Paul is one of the most sought after Psy Trance DJ\u0081's around the world, having made his reputation for playing powerful sets of his own particular style of Hi Tech inspired Full On and continuously pushing the boundaries of the Psy Trance medium. His exacting taste, and ability to source music has led to five very successful V.A compilations so far, on labels such as Crystal Matrix, Spun, Sirius, & Sound Sorcery; all of which have been firm favourites with on the world DJ circuit.\n\n\n\nHis new record 'High Times' (Kundalini 2008) was originally meant as another V/A compilation. However Paul soon decided to craft his own sounds and the album soon became an artist album under his own name. With a focus on a more minimal sound 'High Times' reflects on the tech-trance of the late 90's but gives it a new fresh edge with some tight production and forward thinking.\n\n(3) Paul Taylor - Experimental Musician\n\nOne half of Sutcliffe J\u00fcgend and occasional solo artist."}, {"url": "https://docslib.org/doc/1684258/paul-began-playing-at-age-12-on-an-acoustic-guitar-that-his", "page_content": "Paul began playing at age 12, on an acoustic guitar that his\n\ndad had \u201cbroken in\u201d singing pro-labor and \u201cpeoples\u2019 songs\u201d\n\nwhile performing at union rallies and concerts in the late\n\n\u201840\u2019 s.

Taylor\u2019s development as a titan of dance had a formative chapter during his time as a student here, and over the years, Juilliard has benefited from having a number of distinguished Taylor dancers as faculty members and by the presence of Taylor repertoire in performance on Juilliard\u2019s stages. We can only be grateful for this extraordinarily creative individual voice, which for more than six decades has been so primary in the foundation of what dance is and can be.\n\nHere we offer two perspectives on this modern dance icon and his legacy. The first is an overview of Taylor\u2019s legacy, written by Claudia Schreier, a gifted young choreographer who will be working at Juilliard this winter. Then on a more personal level, we share an excerpt from an article by Carolyn Adams, the legendary Taylor dancer and longtime Juilliard faculty member.\n\nTwo more faculty members and former Taylor dancers, Jane Kosminsky and Linda Kent, shared reminiscences about Taylor in 2014 on the occasion of the Paul Taylor Dance Company\u2019s 60th anniversary, and I encourage you to read those. Of dancing Taylor repertory, Kent wrote about \u201cthe joy and fulfillment inherent in performing his work.\u201d As we mourn the passing of Paul Taylor, we can take great solace in the knowledge that his magnificent legacy of dances will always provide the opportunity for dancers and audiences to connect with his extraordinary poetic voice.\n\n\u2014Damian Woetzel, President\n\nModern Dance Icon\n\nBy Claudia Schreier\n\nA captivating dancer, eminent choreographer, and trailblazer, Paul Taylor (\u201953, dance; honorary degree \u201988) was a chief founder of American modern dance and worldwide champion of the art form. He died on August 29 in Manhattan at the age of 88.\n\nPaul Taylor in the early 1960sTayTaylor in the early 1960s\n\nAt once a virtuosic luminary and an affable humorist, Taylor had a knack for exploring the complexities of the human experience. His work reflected an affinity for the idiosyncratic in lucid detail; across his creative canon and even within a single work, he could dissect unsavory realities and craft steps ascending to the sublime. Over his 64-year career, he created 147 dances, many regarded as breakthrough works upon their debuts that have since become pillars of the modern dance tradition.\n\nBorn in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, on July 29, 1930, Taylor was raised in the Washington, D.C., area. A nexus of academia and the arts launched his trajectory: it was at Syracuse University, where he enrolled in 1947 with a swimming scholarship, that Taylor first discovered his love for dance. He began his formal dance training in 1951 and made an auspicious connection with Martha Graham at the 1952 American Dance Festival at Connecticut College.\n\nThat fall, Taylor enrolled in Juilliard\u2019s dance division, which had opened the year before, for what would prove to be a singularly influential year, studying with Graham (faculty 1951\u201377), Doris Humphrey (faculty 1951-58), Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n (faculty 1951\u201372), Louis Horst (faculty 1951-64), Margaret Craske (faculty 1951\u201366), Alfred Corvino (faculty 1953- 94), and Antony Tudor (faculty 1951\u201371), among other distinguished faculty members.\n\nTaylor embarked upon his professional dance career in 1953 as a founding member of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. The following year, he gathered his own small group of dancers and began to create. His first work, Jack and the Beanstalk, a collaboration with the artist Robert Rauschenberg, was performed at the Henry Street Settlement in Manhattan.\n\nIn 1955, Taylor accepted Graham\u2019s invitation to join her troupe and embarked upon what would become a sevenyear career as a soloist with the Martha Graham Dance Company. In 1959, George Balanchine invited Taylor to perform as a guest artist with New York City Ballet and created for him the monumental solo from Episodes, a work that Balanchine and Graham choreographed in tandem.\n\nWhile continuing to receive praise as a dancer for his commanding figure and striking elegance, Taylor forged ahead with choreography. His versatile creations were a marvel from the outset; pieces like Duet (1957) and Orbs (1966) vividly reflected the influence of the avant-garde era, while others, such as landmark works Aureole (1962) and Esplanade (1975), captivated audiences with their abstract splendor and poignancy. Their groundbreaking premieres led Taylor to achieve legendary status mere decades into his career, even before he became known for his prolific output.\n\nIt was Taylor\u2019s trademark to pair classical music with modern dance, but his musical selections were as diverse as his subject matter, drawing upon genres ranging from 18thcentury baroque to tango to barbershop quartets. His many celebrated\u2014and sometimes controversial\u2014works include Runes (1975), Cloven Kingdom (1976), Airs (1978), Le Sacre du Printemps (the Rehearsal) (1980), Arden Court (1981), Company B (1992), Piazzolla Caldera (1997), Promethean Fire (2002), and Beloved Renegade (2008). Taylor continued to create into the last months of his life; his company premiered his final work, Concertiana, in March.\n\nTaylor received countless awards and honors, among them a Kennedy Center Honor, an Emmy, the National Medal of Arts, and a MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d grant. He was the subject of Matthew Diamond\u2019s award-winning documentary, Dancemaker, and wrote a critically acclaimed autobiography, Private Domain, both offering fascinating glimpses into the impact wrought by his genius.\n\nAt once a virtuosic luminary and an affable humorist, Taylor had a knack for exploring the complexities of the human experience.\n\nThe Paul Taylor Dance Company (PTDC) has performed in more than 540 cities in 64 countries, and repetiteurs affiliated with the company have restaged his works for numerous other professional companies and at universities around the globe. His work was staged more than 20 times over more than two decades at Juilliard, including Esplanade (1981, \u201983, \u201984, \u201994, 2004), Aureole (1982, \u201985), Three Epitaphs (1982), Cloven Kingdom (1985, \u201997), Diggity (1987), Duet (1988, 2001), Arden Court (1989), \u200b\u200bAirs (1991), Sunset (1996, 2013), \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bRoses (1988, 2016), \u200bMusical Offering (2001), and Last Look (2010). Many were staged by faculty member Linda Kent (BS '68, dance), who danced in Taylor's company.\n\nIn 2014, PTDC announced the establishment of Paul Taylor American Modern Dance, which expands the company\u2019s mission, ensuring that Taylor\u2019s legacy lives on not only in the preservation of his own works, but in the presentation of work by other giants of modern dance and through the cultivation of new creative voices.\n\nThis past May, Taylor announced as his successor company dancer Michael Novak, who officially assumed the role upon Taylor\u2019s death, at which point he said, \u201cPaul Taylor was one of the world\u2019s greatest dance-makers, and his passing deeply saddens not only those of us who worked with him, but also people all over the world whose spirits have been touched by his incomparable art.\u201d\n\nChoreographer Claudia Schreier, the artistic director of Claudia Schreier and Company, will choreograph the February Juilliard415-Juilliard Opera-Juilliard Dance production of Purcell\u2019s Dido and Aeneas"}, {"url": "https://sage-advices.com/at-what-age-did-taylor-swift-start-playing-guitar/", "page_content": "At what age did Taylor Swift start playing guitar?\n\n12 years old\n\nBy the age of 10, Swift was singing at a variety of local events, including fairs and contests. She sang \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d at a Philadelphia 76ers basketball game at the age of 11, and began writing her own songs and learning guitar at 12 years old.\n\nIs Taylor Swift considered a guitarist?\n\nYes, Taylor Swift can play the guitar, and she has been described by Andy Mooney, CEO of Fender, as \u201cone of the most influential guitarists of recent years\u201d. After learning to play at the age of 12, guitar-playing became an essential aspect of Taylor\u2019s image.\n\nDid Taylor Swift have guitar lessons?\n\nIt is known by Swift\u2019s fans that Swift\u2019s first musical instrument that she learned was a guitar. Taylor learned to play the guitar when she was just 12 years old. Reportedly a computer whiz taught Taylor Swift her first guitar chords.\n\nIs Taylor Swift a talented singer?\n\nWhere so many of her contemporaries pride themselves on technical excellence, Taylor Swift proves that there\u2019s more to a great voice than just the fireworks. With a middling soprano range that seems more secure in its middle and lower echelons, Tay-Tay\u2019s singing voice is not the most technically adept in the pop world.\n\nWhat type of music does Taylor Swift make?\n\npop\n\nTaylor Swift is an American pop and country music singer-songwriter. Five of her songs, including \u201cShake It Off\u201d (2014), \u201cBlank Space\u201d (2014), and \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d (2017), topped the Billboard Hot 100.

So the four instruments that Taylor Swift happens to know how to play are the guitar, banjo, ukulele, and piano.\n\nWhat are some interesting facts about Taylor Swift?\n\nTaylor wrote a 350 page novel when she was 12, which so far, has never been published. Taylor Swift is extremely talented, she can play the guitar, piano, ukulele, electric guitar and the banjo! She is also a talented painter. One of her favorite items of clothing she likes to wear is a pair of cowboy boots. Swifty\u2019s lucky number is 13.\n\nWhat makes Taylor Swift such a good singer?\n\nPerforming skills: Related to that, if you watch Taylor Swift play and sing at the same time, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s a very confident performer. Facial expressions, flipping hair, singing with emotion, etc. This may sound trivial, but it\u2019s definitely something that only comes from years of performing experience."}, {"url": "https://www.guitarworld.com/features/15-young-guns-making-the-gibson-les-paul-cool-again", "page_content": "Throughout music history, there have been few certainties and even fewer survivors. But when it comes to the Gibson Les Paul, it seems the iconic staple isn't only surviving, but thriving.\n\nThe '70s was a decade defined by the earliest wave of proverbial Guitar Gods \u2013 giant slayers posturing at the stage's edge, casting their lurid spells over unwitting audiences. And the preeminent choice of magic wand? The Gibson Les Paul.\n\nBut as the '80s surged, the Les Paul's fall was steep. Coinciding with that tumble from grace was a rise to prominence for technicolor, hot-rodded rigs. These seemingly mutant creations crafted in presto guitar labs were suddenly slung over the sweaty shoulders of droves of MTV-era icons.\n\nThrough synchronized bombast, this new generation of heroes wielded Jacksons, ESPs, haywire B.C. Rich rigs and eye-catching Ibanez JEMs. There was, of course, one notable exception: Slash, who is widely credited as saving the single-cut during the shred era.\n\nThe '90s would also prove challenging for the Les Paul, with alternative and indie six-stringers taking to Fender Jaguars, beat-up Stratocasters, twangy Telecasters and 12-string Epiphones instead of the load-bearing stalwart. Now, that's not to say the Les Paul died entirely; of course, it's always had its supporters. But somewhere along the way, it became chic to eschew Les Pauls in favor of various new kids on the block.\n\n(Image credit: Future )\n\nIn the modern day, there are still plenty of Frankenstein rigs strewn across stages worldwide. But finally, it seems the Gibson Les Paul is experiencing its long-awaited rebirth. With the resurgence of classic rock among young listeners and the resultant forming of \"new wave of classic rock\" bands, Les Pauls are once again being brandished by the masses.\n\nThough it's sometimes been forsaken, the Gibson Les Paul has never been forgotten. Its symbolic nature, reliability and unmistakable appearance have left it a musical pillar. Some may lean on other guitars or deny the Les Paul's versatility, but in the modern age, many young guns are making the model cool again. What follows are 15 players, all of whom are giving the Gibson Les Paul a new lease on life.\n\n15. Laura Cox\n\n(Image credit: Christophe Girard-Berthet/Instagram)\n\nFrench-born blues-rocker Laura Cox has been wowing audiences as an active musician since around 2008, but it wasn't until her 2017 debut, Hard Blues Shot, and its 2019 follow-up, Burning Bright, that audiences tasted the fruits of Cox's labor. Now, with two albums under her belt, it seems Cox is gaining perpetual steam.\n\nWith roots in the classical realm, it's Cox's habit of strutting her stuff with a dual-pickup, flat-black Les Paul that has defined her image in the present day. What's more, if you're a fan of Laura Cox, we've got good news: she has a new album, Head Above Water, due in early 2023. So, stay tuned.\n\n14. Sam 'Bam' Koltun (Faster Pussycat/Dorothy)\n\n(Image credit: Bill Raymond/DigitalNoiseMag)\n\nAs the successor to the likes of Brent Muscat, Greg Steele and Ace Von Johnson, for young Sam 'Bam' Koltun, taking up the mantle of lead guitarist in Faster Pussycat was no easy task, and while the vintage licks he is asked to perform in Faster aren't always ultra-technical, Koltun has excelled in maintaining the desired aesthetic. With a scuffed, jet-black Les Paul slung over his jean jacket-cloaked frame, Koltun transports fans back to the late '80s of the Sunset Strip each night.\n\nLately, Koltun has been pulling double duty, also providing tasty licks as a member of sultry serenader Dorothy's touring band. If you enjoy a good old fashioned rock 'n' roll spectacle, this particular player is a throwback showman who makes the price of admission worth every penny.\n\n13. Blake Allard (Joyous Wolf)\n\n(Image credit: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images)\n\nOften adorned in fur, pastels and floral patterns, Joyous Wolf's Blake Allard was seemingly plucked from the late '60s flower power music scene. Allard pulls no punches, making no secret of who his heroes are, and his no-holds-barred approach seems to be paying off in spades.\n\nAlong with a few others, Joyous Wolf is a massive part of a burgeoning \"new wave of classic rock\" scene. For rock music fans, Joyous Wolf's Place in Time is a monumental moment, which sees Allard providing old-school waves of guitar badassery via his trusty Gibson Les Paul Goldtop. If you're a fan of the Les Paul, old-school cool and rock music in general, feast your ears on Joyous Wolf.\n\n12. Adam Slack (The Struts)\n\n(Image credit: John Medina/Getty Images)\n\nAs a member of UK act The Struts, and with a classic Honey Burst Les Paul in hand, Adam Slack has been hovering around our collective consciousness for a decade. While it took a bit of time for the rest of the scene to catch up, it could be said that Slack is one of the earliest players to strap on a Les Paul in the name of its resurgence.\n\nFrom his long blonde hair, aviator sunglasses, leather jackets and big 'ol heavy rig, Slack is a throwback to a time when the lead guitarist commanded the stage with machismo and aching bravado. As for his playing, it's meaty, beefy, slick and governed by a soulful fire that burns deep within.\n\n11. Lukas Nelson (Promise of the Real)\n\n(Image credit: Terry Wyatt/Getty Images for Pilgrimage Music & Cultural Festival)\n\nAs a direct descendant of those that came before him, Promise of the Real's vocalist and lead guitarist Lukas Nelson is a verifiable bell cow amongst the masses. Skewing more toward roots and country rock, Nelson reminds listeners of a time in the '70s when country music, jam bands and classic rock merged into one blissful enigma.\n\nNelson is often one for collaboration, but for the unfamiliar, you'd be best served to run through Promise of the Real's eight studio records first. Through his soulful, retro licks, Lukas Nelson is, in many ways, the glue that holds multiple crossing genres together. Plus, his single-pickup tobacco sunburst Les Paul Junior is a simplistic thing of gorgeous majesty \u2013 and, accordingly, is available as a signature model.\n\n10. Dane Pieper (Classless Act)\n\n(Image credit: Michael Tullberg/Getty Images)\n\nClassless Act has taken the world by storm with the release of their debut record, the aptly titled Welcome to the Show, coinciding with their inclusion as openers for the Stadium Tour \u2013 which featured Def Leppard, Poison, Joan Jett and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce \u2013 in the summer of 2022. And while Griffin Tucker often gets the lion's share of attention, Classless Act's \u00fcber-energetic rhythm guitarist Dane Pieper comfortably steals the show.\n\nPieper is a full-on ball of fury known to jump and jive while slicing through heavy riffs. He will often execute Eddie Van Halen-inspired kickflips and David Lee Roth-esque mid-air splits while jumping off the drum riser, all while delivering bone-crushing rhythms via his vintage sunburst Les Paul. If you love energy, then Pieper is the perfect visual cue for Classless Act's wild party tricks.\n\n9. Sammy Boller\n\n(Image credit: Cheyenne Comerford)\n\nTo be sure, Detroit native Sammy Boller owns other guitars, and he even occasionally breaks them out for a solo now and again. But at the end of the day, the blond-haired axeman is most often seen with his beautiful black Les Paul, with the occasional Goldtop sprinkled in for good measure.\n\nConsidered one of the most promising young guns in the game today after six years as the lead guitarist of Citizen Zero, Boller delivered on the early praise heaped onto his instrumental record Kingdom of the Sun (2020).\n\nAs one of the most versatile players currently about, there's no telling what Boller will do next. Be it with a new band or through continued instrumental dominance, Boller is undoubtedly one to keep an eye on if the guitar is your muse.\n\n8. Graham Whitford (Tyler Bryant and the Shakedown)\n\n(Image credit: Scott Legato/Getty Images)\n\nUnfairly, Graham Whitford's claim to fame was most often the fact that his father, Brad Whitford, is the rhythm guitarist for Aerosmith. But all that changed when Whitford met fellow young gun Tyler Bryant.\n\nAfter joining Bryant's namesake group, the Shakedown, it was quickly apparent that Whitford's Les Paul-wielding ways complimented Bryant's Stratocaster adoration perfectly. And while you might think that joining forces with the likes of Tyler Bryant could lead to Whitford being overshadowed, if the group's latest record, Shake the Roots, is any indication, the pair are in perfect lockstep.\n\nIt's evident that Bryant allowed Whitford's array of Les Pauls plenty of room to breathe on the record. Listening back, one cannot help but have visions of Aerosmith's famous Whitford/Perry duo, from which the young pair surely take influence.\n\n7. Whitney Petty (Thunderpussy)\n\n(Image credit: Mat Hayward/Getty Images)\n\nSeattle native Whitney Petty's glam rock-steeped tradition can only be described as a superstock of molten lava delivered via a Rola guitar amp. With some help from Pearl Jam's Mike McCready, Thunderpussy broke through in 2018 after releasing their self-titled debut record. With tongue-in-cheek camp for days and a gloriously obscene singer/guitarist dynamic between Molly Sides and Petty, Thunderpussy is exactly what the doctor ordered.\n\nBut it's Petty's hair-raising swagger, delivered through her vintage sunburst Les Paul, that defines Tunderpussy's glam-inspired sound. With explosive bluster for days and the chops to back it up, Petty is an icon for female players looking to pick up the instrument and a prescription for those looking for new music.\n\n6. Joanne Shaw Taylor\n\n(Image credit: Burak Cingi/Redferns via Getty)\n\nWith a Les Paul in hand at the tender age of 16, Joanne Shaw Taylor caught her first big break. For Taylor, blues-driven stardom was inevitable. Still, her discovery by Eurythmics guitarist Dave Stewart came via an unlikely scenario, which saw Stewart first lay eyes and ears on the young talent at a breast cancer benefit for her mother.\n\nStewart knew talent when he saw it and immediately invited the teenage phenom to join his group D.U.P., which Taylor happily accepted. In the 20 years since, usually with any number of Les Pauls in hand, Shaw Taylor has self-managed her solo career to acclaim, with the best most definitely yet to come.\n\n5. John Notto (Dirty Honey)\n\n(Image credit: SUZANNE CORDEIRO/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIf there's one guitarist on the scene today who is most associated with the \"new wave of classic rock\", it's probably John Notto. Still without major label support (by choice), Notto has ascended the the upper echelons of guitardom solely by the merit of his well-worn playing alone. As such, the always self-assured Massachusetts native is no dummy; he knows when to hold serve and leave well enough alone.\n\nTo that end, Notto keeps it simple: slick, blues-inspired riffs, played via a Les Paul seemingly plucked from the hands of '60s-era Peter Green. Be it his style, his vibe or the Marshall stacks behind him, Notto's affinity for retrograde and apparent Jimmy Page worship has served him and Dirty Honey well.\n\n4. Tristan Thomas (Florence Black)\n\n(Image credit: Tristan Thomas/Instagram)\n\nNot every new kid on the block lives to recreate '70s classic rock. Don't believe us? Just ask Florence Black's Tristan Thomas, whose hyper-melodic tendencies will leave fans of '90s alt-rock feeling like they've entered a time machine. Truth be told, Black's sound contains references to every era, with his weighty riffs channeling from his fingers through his sunburst Les Paul and out his classic Marshall stacks.\n\nWhen listening to Thomas, it's as if Dr. Frankenstein has harvested the collective talents of Slash, Dave Grohl and Ace Frehley and then masterfully combined them into one super-titan of rock. Sound appealing? We certainly think so.\n\n3. Jackie Venson\n\n(Image credit: Gary Miller/Getty Images)\n\nWith her sleek Epiphone Les Paul in hand, Jack Venson's fretwork is a vision of sage beauty. A native of Austin, Texas, and a graduate of the esteemed Berklee College of Music in 2011, the six-stringer has spent the last decade staking her claim among a male-dominated scene.\n\nWhile it might have been easy to secure a foothold in rock alone, across three studio records, several live records and multitudes of EPs, Venson has slayed multiple dragons, logging miles as a road warrior in the blues, soul and pop scenes to boot. Few possess Venson's talent: her exquisite playing pairs with her smoky voice to sublime perfection.\n\n2. Ally Venable\n\n(Image credit: Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Gibson)\n\nIt's been quite a while since a talent like Ally Venable hit the rock and blues scenes. But if Venable's 2021 record Heart of Fire is any indication, the road ahead for the player Mike Zito lovingly refers to as \"Texas Honey\" is paved in pure, unadulterated gold. On the surface, you might assume the red-haired spitfire is flaunting yet another run-of-the-mill Les Paul.\n\nBut the 23-year-old blues-breaker prefers a magenta-colored rig, which Gibson made in very limited numbers in the '90s. Venable's style is tried and true, but her execution and mindset are unique. If you're looking for a guitarist to watch, take a deep dive into Ally Venable's catalog, and enjoy the ride.\n\n1. Jared James Nichols\n\n(Image credit: Sergione Infuso /Corbis via Getty Images)\n\nAt the age of 33, Jared James Nichols is an established name on the rock and blues circuits. Always bursting with energy, Nichols is perhaps best known for his \"pick-less\" playing technique. But then again, Nichols' guitar lineup \u2013 featuring his single-pickup \"Old Glory\" Epiphone Les Paul and a red 1953 model the bluesman has affectionately named \"Ole Red\" \u2013 make for an alluring aesthetic, too.\n\nIt takes skill to carry the weight of a power trio, but Nichols does so effortlessly. In short, each generation has a handful of players who will be remembered forever. Nearly a decade into his career, it appears that Jared James Nichols is this era's ultimate Les Paul-loving icon."}], "By the time Paul Taylor was 15, he was playing in local bands.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Paul-Taylor-choreographer", "page_content": "Paul Taylor, in full Paul Belville Taylor, (born July 29, 1930, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, U.S.\u2014died August 29, 2018, New York, New York), American modern dancer and choreographer noted for the inventive, frequently humorous, and sardonic dances that he choreographed for his company.\n\nEntering Syracuse University in 1947 on a scholarship, Taylor took painting classes and joined the swim team. He began dance training in 1951 and subsequently studied modern dance at Juilliard with Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, and Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n and ballet with Antony Tudor and Margaret Craske. He began his professional career in 1953 with Martha Graham\u2019s company, creating such important roles as Aegisthus in Clytemnestra (1958), Hercules in Alcestis (1960), and Theseus in Phaedra (1962). He also performed in works by other modern choreographers, including those of Charles Weidman and Merce Cunningham. He danced a solo created for him by George Balanchine in Episodes (1959), a work choreographed by Balanchine and Graham to music by Anton Webern.\n\nAs a choreographer, Taylor utilized a wide variety of movement styles, some of which he described as \u201cflat\u201d (two-dimensional in appearance), \u201cdance scribbling\u201d (emphasis on action rather than on shape or line), and \u201clyric\u201d (\u201clong arms\u201d). His avant-garde works ranged from Duet (1957), in which he and his partner remained motionless for four minutes, to Orbs (1966), an hour-long composition to Beethoven\u2019s last string quartets. Other well-known dances included Three Epitaphs (1956), Aureole (1962), Scudorama (1963), The Book of Beasts (1971), Esplanade and Runes (1975), Cloven Kingdom (1976), Aphrodisiamania (1977), Airs (1978), Nightshade (1979), and Le Sacre du Printemps (1980). His Aureole entered the repertoires of such major ballet troupes as the Paris Op\u00e9ra Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet.\n\nTaylor\u2019s company, established in 1954 and usually numbering 13 dancers, first performed in Europe in 1960, toured South America in 1965 under the International Cultural Exchange Program of the U.S. State Department, and in 1978 toured the U.S.S.R. and appeared on the U.S. public-television network. Taylor also choreographed for the Spoleto (Italy) Festival of Two Worlds and won several prestigious awards.

Whether they could really be described as dances was not immediately clear.\n\nIn one, Taylor and another dancer remained completely still, in silence, for four minutes and 33 seconds.

Then there was Merce Cunningham, who stripped away the externals and showed us the heart of movement. And then there was Paul Taylor, who let the sun shine in.\u201d\n\nPaul Taylor, indisputably an imperative pioneer of American Modern Dance, passed awayaged 88 on Wednesday 29 August 2018.\n\nA devastating loss for the modern dance community, his immense influence on the style will live on through his legacy as one of the worlds most celebrated artists.\n\nBorn 29 July 1930, and raised in and around Washington, DC, the young Paul Taylor displayed little sign of becoming a leading figure in the world of modern dance.\n\nHe began studies in painting at Syracuse University in 1949, before unearthing an interest in dance through books in the University library.\n\nActing on his intrigue into the art form, Taylor transferred to the Juilliard School, regarded as one of the world\u2019s leading performing arts conservatoires, on the Upper West side of Manhattan.\n\nTaylor assembled a small company of dancers in 1954 and began to choreograph his first dance work. It was the beginning of an astonishing career consisting of 147 dance works, most attaining iconic status and performed worldwide.\n\nDespite a late introduction to the dance world, Taylor excelled in both choreography and performance. Alongside choreographing for the troupe, Taylor performed as a soloist for seven seasons at the Martha Graham Dance Company from 1955. Showing unique talent and grace on the dance stage, Taylor was invited as a guest artist to New York City Ballet, where Balanchine created famous solo, \u2018Episodes\u2019, especially for him.\n\nThis was only the beginning, as Taylor was also hand-picked for roles in works by master choreographers Merce Cunningham and Martha Graham. He was considered an extremely valuable performer, and possessed the \u2018full package\u2019; with good looks, a powerful physique, and a mysterious yet confident personality.\n\nTaylor was in demand for leading roles up until the early 1970\u2019s when he decided to alter his focus exclusively to choreography, retiring from performance in 1974.\n\nTaylor could not be put into a box. Introduced to the dance world during the 1950s, amidst a period of radical experimentalism for most modern dance choreographers, his style became highly diverse and unpredictable.\n\nHis dances were often poignant, athletic and lyrical, for his eloquent dance troupe. However, the themes of each dance spanned a variety of concepts, and cannot be defined in one simple category.\n\nTaylor was known for employing opposing extremes both on and off stage. An introverted and unassuming character offstage, he graced the stage with enthusiasm and confidence. Likewise, Taylor created humorous, light-hearted utopias in his works, as often as he unflinchingly investigated cutting, dark realities.\n\nPossessing a rich talent for communicative choreography, these extremes were not only separated and assigned to different, individual works, but could be found combined in the same piece.\n\nTaylor also became notorious for his extensive range of musical accompaniment. Unusual choices were made in many of his works; from historical and classical scores such as medieval chants, renaissance dances, and classical symphonies; to the more recent Ragtime, Tango, or Barbershop Quartet music; and even sounds such as telephone time announcements, loon calls, and laughter.\n\nThe unpredictability of the choreographic components led to great intrigue at premiers of his new works. Collectively, his dance works proved the diverse range of outcomes a person\u2019s choreographic style has the potential to produce.\n\nThis new-found creative method, previously unfamiliar in the modern dance world, was a controversial move for Taylor as an artist, and secured him the label of the \u2018naughty boy\u2019 of dance, by modern dance pioneer Martha Graham.\n\nThis label came particularly after a piece created early in Taylor\u2019s career; Seven New Dances. The work was an early advancement into the world of postmodern dance, and brought the attention of audiences and critics around New York, to innovative artist, Paul Taylor.\n\nExperimenting with postmodern musical influences such as John Cage\u2019s \u2018silent\u2019 score, 4\u201933\u2019\u2019, Taylor created a postmodern response, experimenting with non-movement in a dance work. This in turn received a \u2018postmodern\u2019 experimentation of \u2018non-writing\u2019 in response from critic Louis Horst, who provided a blank column in the Dance Observer magazine.\n\nThe work was a milestone in his career, shaping the future of his choreographic approach, working with both the rich vocabulary of modern dance, alongside interesting observations of postures, gestures, and stillness\u2019s in everyday movements, which paved the way for the future style of postmodern dance.\n\nThe originality of Taylor\u2019s creation led to previously unseen levels of national and international popularity. Other companies began to perform his repertoire, and many of the most prestigious dancers of the time were compelled to perform in a number of appearances for his company, such as Rudolf Nureyev, Mikhail Baryshnikov, and a number of New York City Ballet principal dancers. Many illustrious performers and future world-class choreographers such as Pina Bausch and Twyla Tharp became Taylor company members.\n\nTaylor continued to expand his audience beyond the theatre, and into the modern media world. He became the subject of dance documentary, Dancemaker, by Matthew Diamond, which received an Oscar nomination, and was considered by Time to be \u2018perhaps the best dance documentary ever\u2019.\n\nHe was also the author of numerous essays, including Wall Street Journal essay \u2018Why I Make Dances\u2019. Taylor wrote an autobiography, \u2018Private Domain\u2019, nominated by the National Book Critics Circle at the most distinguished biography of 1987.\n\nThe awards continued for Taylor, who received nearly every important honour given to artists in the US. Throughout the duration of his career, Taylor received: Kennedy Center Honors, an Emmy Award, the National Medal of Arts, the Algur H. Meadows Award for Excellence in the Arts, three Guggenheim Fellowships, MacArthur Foundation Fellowship award for lifetime achievement, Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award, New York State Governor\u2019s Arts Award, and New York City Mayor\u2019s Award of Honor for Art and Culture.\n\nTaylor was named one of 50 prominent Americans honoured in recognition of outstanding achievement, and became an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts from numerous renowned American arts universities, including The Juilliard School, and Syracuse University at which he previously studied. France\u2019s highest honour, the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur, was awarded to Taylor for his contribution to French arts, and he was elected one of ten honorary members of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.\n\nThe Paul Taylor Dance Company and Taylor 2 (created 1993), toured the globe numerous times, performing his repertoire in more than 540 cities in 64 countries, in theatres and venues of every nature.\n\nIt was in 2014 that Taylor made the decision to establish an institutional home for his legacy: Paul Taylor American Modern Dance, after six decades as Artistic Director of the company. He curated important modern dances from past and present for the company to perform, alongside presenting his own works, at the Lincoln Center and other venues.\n\nHe appointed a promising new generation of choreographers in order to develop their creative talent, ensuring that the American-grown modern dance style Taylor had worked so hard to build, flourishes long into the future.\n\nTaylor continued to choreograph up until his death and his legacy still shapes the art of modern dance after his passing. He influenced many men and women who have become respected teachers and top-class choreographers including Pina Bausch, Patrick Corbin, David Parsons, and many more.\n\nThe dance works he created are now performed by the Paul Taylor Dance Company, Paul Taylor 2 Dance Company, and companies around the globe, including Royal Danish Ballet, Rambert Dance Company, American Ballet Theater, San Francisco Ballet, Miami City Ballet, and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.\n\nThe preservation of modern dance for years to come was imperative to Taylor, evident from inside the company, as Executive Director John Tomlinson said; \u2018we are inspired to carry on his (Taylor\u2019s) vision through Paul Taylor American Modern Dance. Paul planned aggressively for the future to ensure that generations to come can see his genius works along with other masterworks of modern dance, and great works that will be made by the next generation of modern choreographers.\u201d\n\nHence, Taylor made the careful and justified choice of Michael Novak as his successor, a Taylor dancer since 2010. Taylor prepared Novak for the role as the second Artistic Director of the company, and previously reported; \u201cOver the past decade, Michael has mastered our repertory and steeped himself in dance history. He understands the need to nurture the past, present and future of modern dance. I look forward to working with him and preparing him to assume artistic leadership of my company.\u201d\n\nNovak has pledged to carry on Taylor\u2019s legacy with \u2018utmost fidelity and devotion\u2019. Taylor was a well-loved and respected choreographer, not only by those in his company, but dance audiences around the world."}, {"url": "https://danceconsortium.com/features/article/paul-taylor-a-choreographer-for-all-seasons/", "page_content": "In 1957, with 7 New Dances Taylor inaugurated the post-modern revolution several years before that avant-garde movement actually emerged at Judson Church in 1962 when the likes of Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown, Steve Paxton, Douglas Dunn, Lucinda Childs and David Gordon began creating the sort of radical experimentation which Taylor had explored in his 1957 performance.\n\nAmong those pared-down 7 New Dances was one where Taylor stood behind a woman sitting on the floor. Neither moved, nor even blinked, for the four-minute duration of the piece. In another dance, Taylor struck a series of unconnected poses, each based on everyday posture. The score for this 20-minute dance was an ongoing recording of the voice on the telephone which updates itself every ten seconds: \u2018When you hear the tone, the time will be\u2026\u2019\n\nOvernight, Taylor became notorious. 7 New Dances received what has become the most infamous dance review in history. Louis Horst, who was Martha Graham\u2019s musical mentor, \u2018wrote\u2019 a review which consisted of nothing but the name and place of the performance followed by four inches of blank white space.\n\nIn 1962 the rigours of the Judson Church group (Judson was a deconsecrated venue in New York\u2019s Greenwich Village) began to reshape the dance map with everyday movement. By then Taylor had gone off in yet another unexpected direction with Aureole. He set this plotless series of dances to a string of Handel melodies. This fluid outpouring of movement, with its surging momentum and open ebullience, would bring Taylor his first huge success with the public. The post-modern generation might have scoffed at Taylor\u2019s new-found sense of lyricism, but audiences loved Aureole. They still do.\n\nToday, no one would think twice about Taylor\u2019s artistic stratagems. In fact in 1982, he went on to recycle parts of 7 New Dances in a piece he called Lost, Found and Lost. Now the performers were ironically garbed in swank black and white studded with rhinestones and danced to the sorts of swooning strings of Muzak as heard in louche cocktail lounges.\n\nAnd, of course, today even the most forward-looking and radical choreographers don\u2019t believe it is a betrayal of their avant-garde status to use baroque, or any other sort of music, which will suit their purpose. The strictures which the Judson group imposed on themselves now appear to have been more of an intellectual straightjacket than the \u2018open door\u2019 policy they were meant to be at the time. Major innovations and a stupendous amount of creativity happened during the Judson years, but many of the most significant pieces from the period now appear firmly frozen the 1960s, evocative of a very specific time and place. Aureole, like any true masterwork, continues to exude a sense of timeless simplicity.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t worry about what other people think,\u2019 Taylor said in an interview in 2000. \u2018If I like the piece, that\u2019s good enough for me. If somebody else doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s tough luck.\u2019\n\nThis is because throughout his entire career Taylor has believed that he needed to stick to no rules other than the ones he invented himself. \u2018I can\u2019t worry about what other people think,\u2019 Taylor said in an interview in 2000. \u2018If I like the piece, that\u2019s good enough for me. If somebody else doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s tough luck.\u2019\n\nWe were talking at his house in Greenwich Village. There\u2019s a room up at the top of the house where Taylor stashes all his awards and honourary doctorates. There are a lot of them and they illustrate that the \u2018luck\u2019 is ours. Over the past half century Taylor\u2019s dances have managed to show us who and what we are \u2014 or want to be.\n\nAnother maverick move for Taylor occurred in 1959 when he crossed the \u2018battle lines\u2019 which then divided classical and modern dance like the Berlin Wall. Taylor accepted an invitation to work with George Balanchine who created a solo for him in Episodes. A two-part evening which New York City Ballet shared with the Martha Graham company, Episodes was performed to the complete works of the serial composer Anton Webern.\n\nIn truth this was little more than a publicity gimmick for both Balanchine and Graham, an opportunity for both groups of their highly-polarised fans to cheer on their champion while deriding the opposite camp. Graham\u2019s contribution, a work about Mary Queen of Scots, soon disappeared. Balanchine\u2019s half, a plotless response to the music, is still in the repertory, though when Taylor decided, after three seasons, that he no longer had the time to dance his solo, Balanchine eliminated it from the ballet. He felt no other dancer would be able to recreate Taylor\u2019s highly individual and quirky movement style.\n\nAt the time of Episodes, Taylor was one of Graham\u2019s leading male dancers \u2018on loan\u2019 to Balanchine. In fact, she had first spotted him when he was just a beginning student at the annual summer school of the American Dance Festival at Connecticut College in 1952. According to legend, she took one look at his 6\u2032 3\u201d brawny, broad-shouldered body and announced, \u2018I want him\u2019.\n\nTaylor, who was in college on an athletics scholarship as a swimmer, was a novice. Graham the high priestess of modern dance. He would go on to perform with her company for seven seasons (1955-62).\n\nBefore joining Graham\u2019s company Taylor was one of the five dancers who spent the summer of 1953 at Black Mountain, a short-lived artists\u2019 colony in North Carolina, with Merce Cunningham, the composer John Cage and the artist Robert Rauschenberg. The outcome was not only the launch of the Cunningham company but the beginning of a long-term collaboration between Taylor and Rauschenberg. (With the exception of Graham, all these now-illustrious artists were then unknowns trying to make their mark.)\n\nTaylor would move on found his own company in 1954, though still continuing to be a member of Graham\u2019s troupe. 7 New Dances and Aureole are the most important works from the first years of his troupe. Aureole also has the distinction of being a pivot point in the rapprochement between ballet and modern dance.\n\nToday few people question ballet companies performing works by modern dance choreographers. Aureole set this pattern in motion when it entered the Royal Danish Ballet\u2019s repertory. A ballet company going barefoot and attempting to master a modern dance style was unheard of at the time and Taylor\u2019s antipathy towards nineteenth-century ballet conventions is well known. However, since then dozens of companies have performed Aureole, including London Festival (now English National) Ballet.

Taylor experienced his first mainstream success in the early 1980s as the touring keyboardist in Canadian musician Aldo Nova\"s backing band, and he appears in the music video for Nova\"s biggest hit, \"Fantasy.\" Prior to forming Winger, Taylor and Kip Winger were both playing with Alice Cooper\"s backing band on the tours for Cooper\"s mid-80s albums, Constrictor (1986) and Raise Your Fist and Yell (1987). During this time, the two began composing songs together and, while on break from touring, recorded what would become the first Winger demos. Whereas Kip left Alice\"s band prior to the European leg of the 1987 tour, Paul remained on board for the European dates. However, in the midst of touring Europe, Paul received a call from Kip, who had been working with future Winger lead guitarist Reb Beach recording more demos in New York, informing him that he had gotten a record deal. After the European tour was finished, Paul flew straight back to New York, and the Winger project (initially known as \"Sahara\") began rehearsing and recording their debut album. Taylor remained in Winger throughout the band\"s most successful period, which included the two smash albums, Winger and In the Heart of the Young. However, after the tour supporting the latter album ended in 1991, Taylor left the band in early 1992, citing exhaustion and a desire to write and get involved with other projects. Throughout the 1990s, Taylor immersed himself in numerous other projects, perhaps the most prolific of which was recording and touring with Steve Perry for his 1994 solo album. In 1998, he returned to the Alice Cooper band (this time, alongside fellow former Winger guitarist Reb Beach), and once that tour ended, he embarked on a brief tour with Tommy Shaw. Winger reunited in 2001 to record new material for a Greatest Hits album. Although it is unclear whether Taylor participated in these recording sessions, he did later join the band on the supporting tour. Though Paul was asked by Kip Winger to rejoin the band again to work on their 2006 reunion album, he declined because he was already involved with other projects. More recently, Taylor has become involved in composing music for television series programs and has also been pursuing his passion for photography. He also spent the summer months of 2012 touring with Cinderella throughout the United States. playing keyboards for them. He returned to Winger during mid-2013 and performed with them on select tour dates up through early 2014 and appeared in the Queen Babylon released in late 2014."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/nov/02/artsfeatures", "page_content": "What are the advantages of being Paul Taylor and ageing into one of the world\u2019s most venerated choreographers? Having a \u201cspiffy\u201d development director called Darcy, maybe, who forces you into a new designer suit when your old one has grown too ancient to take another curtain call. Or being so famous that the Queen inadvertently suffers you to feel her royal behind.\n\nThis last incident involved an uncharacteristic failure in timing, when Taylor, politely pushing down Her Majesty\u2019s theatre seat for her when she was visiting his company, didn\u2019t get his hand out fast enough as she sat down. He recalls the Queen being \u201cvery gracious\u201d and not batting an eyelid as he wriggled his fingers out from under her.\n\nBut ultimately Taylor\u2019s achievement is being 70 and still practising his art. While other dance groups fall victim to poverty and changes in fashion, the Paul Taylor Company has prospered since it was formed in 1955. Some of the dance world\u2019s starriest names, including Twyla Tharp, have been through its ranks, while others, including Mark Morris, owe a debt to his extrovert style.\n\nWhen I meet Taylor at his home on Long Island he looks far too youthful to have such a long history (he has created over 120 dances). His large, mild blue eyes may be a little crinkled round the edges but there\u2019s no slack in the expression. He smokes more cigarettes than anyone I\u2019ve seen, yet still seems far more laid-back than the typical jiggered-up New York artist, partly because he spends as little time as possible in the city. His country house looks as if it has put down roots in the local soil. He keeps bees, collects insects and has a view over the sea that it\u2019s hard to tear your eyes from. But he just keeps on working.\n\nLike so many choreographers, Taylor was spurred into creating work because he became frustrated performing other people\u2019s. He started training late. At university, on a swimming scholarship, he experienced a sudden conversion to dance. He took classes and his natural talent was such that within a few years he had performed in the companies of Merce Cunningham, Martha Graham and even, for a while, George Balanchine. Photos and film footage show a dancer whose lyric grace is made all the more beautiful and unexpected by the big-muscled frame of his body. Taylor moved through the air like a swimmer through water, buoyed up by the space around him.\n\nWhen his body failed him at 44, the anguish of having to yield his roles to younger men was mitigated by the realisation that he had to continue choreographing. Taylor admits that he couldn\u2019t do anything else, and he had nine dancers dependent on him for their careers. \u201cI stopped trying to get people to move exactly as I did and started using their own idiosyncrasies, the things that made them special,\u201d he says.\n\nMaking dance is a highly social process, yoking the choreographer physically and emotionally to the dancers, so the dynamic of any company is crucial to its identity. Typically when companies start out, the dancers and choreographer are all young, hopeful and pulling together; then a distance sets in and this gets larger the more celebrated the choreographer becomes.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem that Taylor and his dancers often defuse with humour. The dancers call him \u201cBoss\u201d and Taylor describes his company as \u201cfamily\u201d, although he adds: \u201cWith all the dysfunctions, too.\u201d It matters to him that dancers average \u201caround 10 years\u201d with the company before they move on. It has hurt him when finally go.\n\nLike all patriarchs, Taylor is having to address the issue of his legacy. The traumas suffered by the Martha Graham Dance Company show how bad it can get when factions are left to fight over who preserves the repertory and who plans the future. Taylor appears practical: \u201cNaturally you think ahead to when you\u2019re unable to deal with the company, so you\u2019re always looking round to see if there is someone who could take over as artistic director.\u201d He had his heart set on dancer Chris Gillis (\u201cHe was a wonderful choreographer\u201d) until Gillis\u2019s untimely death from Aids.\n\nHis dances have always tended to alternate between the lyric and the dramatic, and while the former are famous for their robust grace and exuberant celebration of music, the latter are often violently complicated in tone, flipping from macabre to comic, from savage to sentimental, so quickly that it is hard to plot the co-ordinates of Taylor\u2019s vision. It\u2019s clear that despite his lovable, easy charm, he stands guard over complex secrets.\n\nHis autobiography is entitled Private Domain and its writing style maintains a wary distance from the reader. Taylor complains about the frank sexual revelations contained in a recent biography of Frederick Ashton. \u201cThey should bring back the closet,\u201d he snorts. While he makes no secret of his own homosexuality, he doesn\u2019t see it as material for public discussion. But nor does he talk much about his art. In the book there\u2019s a lofty, curmudgeonly character called Tacet, whom Taylor invented todiscuss issues he didn\u2019t want to raise directly; and in conversation he can be evasive. When I ask if he enjoys the fact that dance is free of the constraints of words, he smiles. \u201cOh, but I try to be as clear as I can,\u201d he says, then adds: \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t believe in throwing everything into the audience\u2019s lap.\u201d\n\nHe claims that with each new work, \u201cI feel as if I\u2019m starting over.\u201d When pieces are revived, they can be a pleasurable surprise but his favourite is always \u201cthe one I\u2019m working on, the baby. I always hope the audience will love the work but there\u2019s no use getting all upset if they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHis inspirations are a random affair: \u201cI call myself a spy. I love to watch people in the street, their gestures, the way they walk. People who don\u2019t do art have a curiosity about where it comes from but I think everyone really knows. Problem-solving is the common thread. In a dance I set up problems to solve and others appear as I\u2019m working. Sometimes there are solutions, sometimes not.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803102311276", "page_content": "(b Edgewood, Pa., 29 Jul. 1930)\n\nUS dancer, choreographer, and company director. Having trained extensively as a swimmer, he took up dance while at Syracuse University (where he was studying art). In 1952 he moved to New York and studied modern dance with Graham, Humphrey, Lim\u00f3n, and Cunningham, and ballet with Tudor and Craske. He performed with Cunningham (1954), Lang (1955) and with the Martha Graham Dance Company (1955\u201362). Here he created the role of Aegisthus in Clytemnestra (1958), the Stranger in Embattled Garden (1958), a leading role in Alcestis (1960), Acrobats of God (1960), and a role in Episodes (1959), the joint Graham\u2013Balanchine work in which Balanchine choreographed a solo for Taylor. He founded his own company in 1954, only a year after making his first piece. He collaborated with the painter Robert Rauschenberg and, like him, worked as a window dresser at Tiffany's, the New York jewellers, in order to finance his early works. Their first collaboration was Jack and the Beanstalk (1954); Rauschenberg then designed all of Taylor's works in the 1950s, including Three Epitaphs (1956) and Seven New Dances (1957). With his company he travelled the world and consolidated his position as one of the most eclectic and popular masters of American modern dance, his works encompassing a range of influences, from dance, theatre, and the wider culture; his expansive, athletic style of movement proving unusually accessible. Some of Taylor's early work belied his later appeal: Duet (1957), premiered in the Seven New Dances evening, featured him and his pianist performing neither music nor movement for the duration of the piece (which was set to John Cage's \u2018non-score\u2019). The critic Louis Horst responded by leaving his review space in Dance Observer a blank. Later works however combined Taylor's experimental approach with a sure populist touch. In Esplanade (1975) he used a movement vocabulary that consisted of little more than walking, running, jumping, and falling, but still created an effect of infectious, exuberant power. In The Rehearsal (1980) he reworked Nijinsky's The Rite of Spring, into a tale of gangsters and kidnapping. In Company B (1991) Taylor explored the power of nostalgia and popular music, using songs by the Andrews Sisters to evoke the era of the Second World War.\n\nTaylor's choreography divides roughly into three styles, the lyrical, the comic, and the darkly psychological. Several of his more buoyant and fluidly phrased works have been taken into the repertoires of classical companies, including the Royal Danish Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, Joffrey Ballet, Paris Opera Ballet, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, and San Francisco Ballet. Aureole, Airs, and Arden Court have proved among the most internationally popular. Taylor retired from dancing in 1974 but continued to choreograph for his company. (The commissions he accepted from other companies were also created for, and with, his own dancers.)\n\nA list of his works includes 3 Epitaphs (mus. Laneville-Johnson Union Brass Band, 1956), Seven New Dances (mus. Cage and various sounds, 1957), Images and Reflections (mus. Feldman, 1958), Meridian (mus.
