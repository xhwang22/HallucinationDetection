But his personal life was complicated. Separated from his wife and living in a huge country mansion in Kent, the novelist was in the thrall of his young mistress, Ellen Ternan. This is the untold story of Charles Dickens\u2019s final hours and the furore that followed, as the great writer\u2019s family and friends fought over his final wishes.\n\nMy new research has uncovered the never-before-explored areas of the great author\u2019s sudden death, and his subsequent burial. While details such as the presence of Ternan at the author\u2019s funeral have already been discovered by Dickensian sleuths, what is new and fresh here is the degree of manoeuvring and negotiations involved in establishing Dickens\u2019s ultimate resting place.\n\nDickens\u2019s death created an early predicament for his family. Where was he to be buried? Near his home (as he would have wished) or in that great public pantheon, Poet\u2019s Corner in Westminster Abbey (which was clearly against his wishes)?\n\n\u201cThe Inimitable\u201d (as he sometimes referred to himself) was one of the most famous celebrities of his time. No other writer is as closely associated with the Victorian period. As the author of such immortal classics as Oliver Twist, David Copperfield and A Christmas Carol, he was constantly in the public eye. Because of the vivid stories he told, and the causes he championed (including poverty, education, workers\u2019 rights, and the plight of prostitutes), there was great demand for him to represent charities, and appear at public events and visit institutions up and down the country (as well as abroad \u2013 particularly in the United States). He moved in the best circles and counted among his friends the top writers, actors, artists and politicians of his day.\n\nDickens was proud of what he achieved as an author and valued his close association with his public. In 1858 he embarked on a career as a professional reader of his own work and thrilled audiences of thousands with his animated performances. This boost to his career occurred at a time when his marital problems came to a head: he fell in love with Ternan, an 18-year-old actress, and separated from his wife Catherine, with whom he had ten children.\n\nDickens was careful to keep his love affair private. Documentary evidence of his relationship with Ternan is very scarce indeed. He had wanted to take her with him on a reading tour to America in 1868, and even developed a telegraphic code to communicate to her whether or not she should come. She didn\u2019t, because Dickens felt that he could not protect their privacy.\n\nOn Wednesday June 8 1870, the author was working on his novel Edwin Drood in the garden of his country home, Gad\u2019s Hill Place, near Rochester, in Kent. He came inside to have dinner with his sister-in-law, Georgina Hogarth, and suffered a stroke. The local doctor was summoned and remedies were applied without effect. A telegram was sent to London, to summon John Russell Reynolds, one of the top neurologists in the land. By the following day the author\u2019s condition hadn\u2019t changed and he died at 6.10pm, on June 9.\n\nAccepted wisdom concerning Dickens\u2019s death and burial is drawn from an authorised biography published by John Forster: The Life of Charles Dickens. Forster was the author\u2019s closest friend and confidant. He was privy to the most intimate areas of his life, including the time he spent in a blacking (boot polish) warehouse as a young boy (which was a secret, until disclosed by Forster in his book), as well as details of his relationship with Ternan (which were not revealed by Forster, and which remained largely hidden well into the 20th century). Forster sought to protect Dickens\u2019s reputation with the public at all costs.\n\nLast Will and Testament\n\nIn his will (reproduced in Forster\u2019s biography), Dickens had left instructions that he should be:\n\nBuried in an inexpensive, unostentatious, and strictly private manner; that no public announcement be made of the time or place of my burial; that at the utmost not more than three plain mourning coaches be employed; and that those who attend my funeral wear no scarf, cloak, black bow, long hat-band, or other such revolting absurdity.\n\nForster added that Dickens\u2019s preferred place of burial \u2013 his Plan A \u2013 was \u201cin the small graveyard under Rochester Castle wall, or in the little churches of Cobham or Shorne\u201d, which were all near his country home. However, Forster added: \u201cAll these were found to be closed\u201d, by which he meant unavailable.\n\nLeon Litvack\n\nPlan B was then put into action. Dickens was set to be buried in Rochester Cathedral, at the direction of the Dean and Chapter (the ecclesiastical governing body). They had even dug a grave for the great man. But this plan too was scuppered, in favour of interment in Poets\u2019 Corner, in Westminster Abbey \u2013 the resting place of Geoffrey Chaucer, Samuel Johnson, and other literary greats.\n\nForster claims in the biography that the media led the way in agitating for burial in the abbey. He singles out The Times, which, in an article of January 13 1870, \u201ctook the lead in suggesting that the only fit resting place for the remains of a man so dear to England was the abbey in which the most illustrious Englishmen are laid\u201d. He added that when the Dean of Westminster, Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, asked Forster and members of the Dickens family to initiate what was now Plan C, and bury him in the abbey, it became their \u201cgrateful duty to accept that offer\u201d.\n\nThe private funeral occurred early in the morning of Tuesday June 14 1870, and was attended by 14 mourners. The grave was then left open for three days so that the public could pay their respects to one of the most famous figures of the age. Details of the authorised version of Dickens\u2019s death and burial were carried by all the major and minor newspapers in the English-speaking world and beyond. Dickens\u2019s estranged wife Catherine received a message of condolence from Queen Victoria, expressing \u201cher deepest regret at the sad news of Charles Dickens\u2019s death\u201d.\n\nThis article is part of Conversation Insights\n\nThe Insights team generates long-form journalism derived from interdisciplinary research. The team is working with academics from different backgrounds who have been engaged in projects aimed at tackling societal and scientific challenges.\n\nThe effect that Dickens\u2019s death had on ordinary people may be appreciated from the reaction of a barrow girl who sold fruits and vegetables in Covent Garden Market. When she heard the news, she is reported to have said: \u201cDickens dead? Then will Father Christmas die too?\u201d\n\nThe funeral directors\n\nMy investigation has revealed, however, how Dickens\u2019s burial in Poets\u2019 Corner was engineered by Forster and Stanley to satisfy their personal aims, rather than the author\u2019s own. While the official story was that it was the \u201cwill of the people\u201d to have Dickens buried in the Abbey (and there were articles in The Times to this effect), the reality was that this alteration suited both the biographer and the churchman.\n\nThe Life and Correspondence of Arthur Penrhyn Stanley , Author provided (no reuse)\n\nForster could conclude the volume he was contemplating in a fitting manner, by having Dickens interred in the national pantheon where so many famous literary figures were buried. He thus ensured that a stream of visitors would make a pilgrimage to Dickens\u2019s grave and spread his reputation far and wide, for posterity.\n\nStanley could add Dickens to his roll of famous people whose burials he conducted. They included Lord Palmerston, the former UK prime minister, mathematician and astronomer Sir John Herschel, missionary and explorer David Livingstone, and Sir Rowland Hill, the postal reformer and originator of the penny post.\n\nThe efforts of Forster and Stanley to get Dickens buried exactly where they wanted enhanced the reputations of both men. For each of them, the interment of Dickens in the abbey might be considered the highlight of their careers.\n\nCharles Dickens Museum , CC BY\n\n\u2018Mr Dickens very ill, most urgent\u2019\n\nThe new evidence I have found was gathered from libraries, archives and cathedral vaults and prove beyond a doubt that any claims about the Westminster burial being the will of the people are false.\n\nWhat emerges is an atmosphere of urgency in the Dickens household after the author collapsed. Dickens\u2019s son Charley sent the telegram to the author\u2019s staff in London, requesting urgent medical assistance from the eminent neurologist, John Russell Reynolds:\n\nGo without losing a moment to Russell Reynolds thirty eight Grosvenor St Grosvenor Sqr tell him to come by next train to Higham or Rochester to meet\u2026 Beard (Dickens\u2019s physician), at Gadshill \u2026 Mr Dickens very ill most urgent.\n\nDickens\u2019s sister-in-law, Georgina Hogarth, who ran his household and cared for his children after the separation from Catherine, was clearly disappointed that the specialist could do nothing for her much-adored brother-in-law. She sent a note to her solicitor with the doctor\u2019s fee: \u201cI enclose Dr Reynolds\u2019 demand (of \u00a320) for his fruitless visit.\u201d\n\nDean Stanley had met Dickens in 1870, after being introduced by the churchman\u2019s brother-in-law, Frederick Locker, who was a friend of the novelist. Stanley confided to his private journal (now housed in the archives of Westminster Abbey) that he was \u201cmuch struck\u201d by his conversation with Dickens and appreciated the few opportunities he had to meet the author before he died.\n\nLocker\u2019s memoir also records an interesting conversation he had with Stanley before this 1870 meeting, which sheds light on the Dean\u2019s attitude towards the novelist, his death and funeral. Locker writes about talking to Stanley \u201cof the burials in the abbey\u201d and they discussed the names of some \u201cdistinguished people\u201d. Stanley told him there were \u201ccertain people\u201d he would be \u201cobliged to refuse\u201d burial, on account of personal antipathies. But his attitude changed when the name of the author \u201ccame up\u201d and he said he \u201cshould like to meet Dickens\u201d. Then, to \u201cgratify\u201d Stanley\u2019s \u201cpious wish\u201d, Locker asked Dickens and his daughter to dine. Thus even while Dickens was still alive, Stanley privately expressed a desire to bury him.\n\nWhen the end came, Locker conveyed the news to his brother-in-law on that very day \u2013 June 9. The Dean wrote to Locker to say:\n\nAlas! \u2013 how soon we have been overtaken by the event which we were anticipating as so distant. I cannot amply thank you for having given me the opportunity of having met Charles Dickens while there was yet time. You will gather from what I have already said that I am quite prepared to raise any proposals about the burial that may be made to me.\n\nBy kind permission of the Armstrong Browning Library. , Author provided\n\nThe letter is fascinating. On the very day of the famous author\u2019s death, the Dean was already thinking about burial in the Abbey. But there was a catch: Stanley could only entertain such a proposal if it came from the family and executors. He could not act unilaterally.\n\nLocker quickly seized the opportunity hinted at in Stanley\u2019s letter and sent a copy of it to Charley Dickens (the author\u2019s son) on June 10. He wrote in his covering note: \u201cI wish to send you a copy of a letter that I have just received from Dean Stanley and I think it will explain itself. If I can be of any use pray tell me.\u201d\n\nFalse claims and ambition\n\nMeanwhile, the idea of getting Dickens to Poets\u2019 Corner was growing in Stanley\u2019s imagination. He wrote to his cousin Louisa on Saturday June 11 to say \u201cI never met (Dickens) till this year\u2026 And now he is gone \u2026 and it is not improbable that I may bury him\u201d. It\u2019s interesting how quickly the plan crystallised in the Dean\u2019s mind. Within the space of 48 hours, he went from hypothetical proposals from the family for burial, to foreseeing a key role for himself in the proceedings.\n\nHowever, an answer from Charley Dickens wasn\u2019t forthcoming. Stanley waited until the morning of Monday June 13, before seeking another way of making his wishes known to the family. He got in touch with his friend Lord Houghton (formerly Rickard Monckton Milnes \u2013 a poet, politician and friend of Dickens), reiterating his preparedness \u201cto receive any proposal for (Dickens\u2019s) burial in the Abbey\u201d and asking Houghton to \u201cact as you think best\u201d.\n\nIt was at this point in the proceedings that Forster took charge of the planning. He had been away in Cornwall when Dickens died and it took him two days to reach Gad\u2019s Hill. When he reached Dickens\u2019s country home on Saturday June 11 he was overcome with grief at the death of his friend and clearly unprepared for the suddenness with which the blow was struck. His first thoughts, and those of the immediate family, were to accede to Dickens\u2019s wishes and have him buried close to home. While the official account, in his Life of Dickens, claims that the graveyards in the vicinity of his home were \u201cclosed\u201d, an examination of the records of the churches in Cobham and Shorne demonstrate this to be false.\n\nThe proposed burial in Rochester Cathedral was not only advanced, but in fact finalised, costed, and invoiced. The Chapter archives demonstrate that a grave was in fact dug in St Mary\u2019s Chapel by the building firm Foord & Sons. The records also show that the Cathedral authorities \u201cbelieved, as they still believe (after Dickens was buried in the Abbey), that no more fitting or honourable spot for his sepulture could be found than amidst scenes to which he was fondly attached, and amongst those by whom he was personally known as a neighbour and held in such honour\u201d.\n\nMedway Archives & Local Studies. , Author provided\n\nThese views are reinforced by the claims of Hogarth, Dickens\u2019s sister-in-law, in a letter to a friend:\n\nWe should have preferred Rochester Cathedral, and it was a great disappointment to the people there that we had to give way to the larger demand.\n\nThis \u201clarger demand\u201d came \u2013 at least in part \u2013 from a leader that appeared in The Times on Monday June 13. It concluded:\n\nLet (Dickens) lie in the Abbey. Where Englishmen gather to review the memorials of the great masters and teachers of their nation, the ashes and the name of the greatest instructor of the nineteenth century should not be absent.\n\nDespite this appeal appearing in the press, Stanley\u2019s private journal records that he still \u201chad received no application from any person in authority\u201d, and so \u201ctook no steps\u201d to advance his burial plan.\n\nStanley\u2019s prayers must have seemed answered, then, when Forster and Charley Dickens appeared at the door of the Deanery on that same day. According to the Dean, after they sat down, Forster said to Stanley: \u201cI imagine the article in the \u2018Times\u2019 must have been written with your concurrence?\u201d Stanley replied: \u201cNo, I had no concern with it, but at the same time I had given it privately to be understood that I would consent to the interment if it was demanded.\u201d By this Stanley meant the letter he had sent to Locker, which the latter had forwarded to Charley. Stanley of course agreed to the request from Dickens\u2019s representatives for burial in Poets\u2019 Corner. What he refrains from saying is how much he personally was looking forward to officiating at an event of such national significance.\n\nWhile it\u2019s clear, from the private correspondence I have examined, that Stanley agitated for Dickens\u2019s burial in the abbey, the actions of Forster are harder to trace. He left fewer clues about his intentions and he destroyed all of his working notes for his monumental three volume biography of Dickens. These documents included many letters from the author. Forster used Dickens\u2019s correspondence liberally in his account. In fact, the only source we have for most of the letters from Dickens to Forster are the passages that appear in the biography.\n\nBut as well as showing how Forster falsely claimed in his biography that the graveyards near his home were \u201cclosed\u201d, my research also reveals how he altered the words of Stanley\u2019s (published) funeral sermon to suit his own version of events. Forster quoted Stanley as saying that Dickens\u2019s grave \u201cwould thenceforward be a sacred one with both the New World and the Old, as that of the representative of the literature, not of this island only, but of all who speak our English tongue\u201d. This, however, is a mis-quotation of the sermon, in which Stanley actually said:\n\nMany, many are the feet which have trodden and will tread the consecrated ground around that narrow grave; many, many are the hearts which both in the Old and in the New World are drawn towards it, as towards the resting-place of a dear personal friend; many are the flowers that have been strewed, many the tears shed, by the grateful affection of \u2018the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and those that had none to help them\u2019.\n\nStanley worked with Forster to achieve their common aim. In 1872, when Forster sent Stanley a copy of the first volume of his Life of Dickens, the Dean wrote:\n\nYou are very good to speak so warmly of any assistance I may have rendered in carrying out your wishes and the desire of the country on the occasion of the funeral. The recollection of it will always be treasured amongst the most interesting of the various experiences which I have traversed in my official life.\n\nFor the ages\n\nMy research demonstrates that the official, authorised accounts of the lives and deaths of the rich and famous are open to question and forensic investigation \u2013 even long after their histories have been written and accepted as canonical. Celebrity is a manufactured commodity, that depends for its effect on the degree to which the fan (which comes from the word \u201cfanatic\u201d) can be manipulated into believing a particular story about the person whom he or she adores.\n\nBy kind permission of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster. , Author provided (no reuse)\n\nIn the case of Dickens, two people who had intimate involvement in preserving his reputation for posterity were not doing so for altruistic reasons: there was something in it for each of them. Stanley interred the mortal remains of Dickens in the principal shrine of British artistic greatness. This ensured that his tomb became a site of pilgrimage, where the great and the good would come to pay their respects \u2013 including the Prince of Wales, who laid a wreath on Dickens\u2019s grave in 2012, to mark the bicentenary of his birth.\n\nSuch public commemorations of this Victorian superstar carry special meaning and mystique for his many fans. This year, on February 7 (the anniversary of his birth), Armando Iannucci (director of the new film adaptation The Personal History of David Copperfield) is scheduled give the toast to \u201cthe immortal memory\u201d at a special dinner hosted by the Dickens Fellowship \u2013 a worldwide association of admirers. The 150th anniversary of his death will be observed at Westminster Abbey on June 8 2020.\n\nWhether it\u2019s the remembrance of the author\u2019s death or his birth, these public acts symbolise how essential Dickens is to Britain\u2019s national culture. None of this would have been possible, however, had it not been for the involvement of Dickens\u2019s best friend and executor, John Forster. Forster organised the private funeral in Westminster Abbey in accordance with Dickens\u2019s wishes, and ensured that his lover Ellen Ternan could discreetly attend, and that his estranged wife would not. But he is also the man who overruled the expectations of the author for a local burial. Instead, through an act of institutionally sanctioned bodysnatching, the grave in Poets\u2019 Corner bound Dickens forever in the public mind with the ideals of national life and art and provided a fitting conclusion to Forster\u2019s carefully considered, strategically constructed biography. It ends with these words:\n\nFacing the grave, and on its left and right, are the monuments of Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Dryden, the three immortals who did most to create and settle the language to which Charles Dickens has given another undying name.\n\nFor you: more from our Insights series:\n\nTo hear about new Insights articles, join the hundreds of thousands of people who value The Conversation\u2019s evidence-based news.

His father gave him the greater part of his general education and University College, London, his medical training. He graduated in 1851 as University scholar and gold medallist in physiology, comparative anatomy and medicine. For so outstanding a student, a great future seemed assured. But his means were slender and he decided to begin practice in Leeds where he had relatives. However, his old teacher Marshall Hall persuaded him to return to London, offering him his house in Grosvenor Street on favourable terms. His enterprise was rewarded by appointments as assistant physician to the Hospital for Sick Children in 1855, the Westminster Hospital in 1857 and University College Hospital in 1859. After a further three years, he became full physician and Holme professor of clinical medicine at University College, and in 1867 he succeeded Jenner in the chair of medicine.\n\nReynolds gave distinguished service to the Royal College of Physicians, being Lumleian Lecturer in 1867, Harveian Orator in 1884, Censor, and finally, from 1893 to 1896, President. He was chosen as Physician to the Royal Household in 1879 and, with his friend, J. E. Erichsen, created a baronet in 1895. He was president of the B.M.A. at the time of his death. But he made his mark in the profession chiefly by his early writings on nervous diseases \u2014 he was one of the first to propound the possibilities of electricity as a therapeutic agent \u2014 and by his editorship of the System of Medicine, published in five volumes between 1866 and 1879. He was a fluent and popular lecturer and a careful and sympathetic physician. Somewhat shy and grave of mien, he could reveal both a quiet humour and a directness of speech that was no respecter of persons. Painting and music were his recreations, and he was well read in literature. He was married, firstly, to a Miss Ainslie and, secondly to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street.\n\nG H Brown\n\n[Lancet, 1896; B.M.J., 1896; D.N.B., xlviii, 52]"}, {"url": "https://acnr.co.uk/articles/john-russell-reynolds/", "page_content": "Abstract\n\nWhen neurology began to develop as a specialty, Russell Reynolds was one of the first neurologists appointed to the Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic, Queen Square.\n\nOf many contributions his work on epilepsy was influential, espousing many new concepts. He followed and developed Hughlings Jackson\u2019s original ideas about positive and negative neurological symptoms. His approach to patients was holistic at a time when more objectively defined notions of illness dominated medicine. He wrote on vertigo, and about criminal lunacy, and his book The Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, Nerves and their appendages was a major text of the period.\n\nWell versed in poetry, philosophy, art, and music, he was widely admired. He became President of the Royal College of Physicians.\n\nLike the great Sir Jonathan Hutchinson and other Victorians of privileged stock, Sir John Russell Reynolds (1828\u20131896) (Figure 1) never attended school. His father, a nonconformist minister at Romsey in Hampshire, educated him personally. His grandfather Henry Revell Reynolds (1745-1811), FRS, was an illustrious physician at the Middlesex and St Thomas\u2019s Hospitals and Physician to George III.\n\nFigure 1: Sir J Russell Reynolds. [Published in British Medical Journal, 6 June 1896)\n\nAs a nonconformist he was excluded from Oxford and Cambridge* and read Medicine at University College London, graduating with a gold medal in physiology, comparative anatomy, and medicine in 1851 [1]. An impecunious young doctor, he sought a living, practicing in Leeds where his brother was a Minister of the East Parade Mission Chapel, and his brother-in-law a journalist on the Leeds Mercury.\n\nA year later his former teacher Marshall Hall, FRS. (1790-1857), a physician and brilliant experimental physiologist persuaded him to return to London [2], where at modest cost Hall let him live in his home at 38, Grosvenor Street and join his Consultant practice, mainly in nervous diseases.\n\nOnly four years after graduating Russell Reynolds\u2019 outstanding ability led to his appointment as assistant physician at the Hospital for Sick Children and to the Westminster and University College Hospitals. There he became Holme Professor of Clinical Medicine in 1862, and in 1867 succeeding Sir William Jenner as Professor of Medicine. Just five years after the opening of the National Hospital for the Relief and Cure of Paralysis and Epilepsy, Russell Reynolds showed his interest in neurology and was appointed to its staff. He was elected FRS on 3rd June 1869.\n\nAt this time neurology began to flourish; he worked with many distinguished early neurologists. They included Hughlings Jackson (1835-1911), Jabez Ramskill (1825-1897), Charles Bland Radcliffe (1822\u20131889) who succeeded Brown\u2013S\u00e9quard in 1863, and published Lectures on Epilepsy, Pain, Paralysis, and certain other disorders of the Nervous System, 1864, and articles in Reynolds\u2019s System of Medicine. His brother John Netten Radcliffe (c. 1830-1884), a pioneering epidemiologist, was also Medical Superintendent of the Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic.\n\nNo man works in a vacuum. Marshall Hall, (who in spite of his acknowledged distinction [3] surprisingly had failed to get an academic post in London) inspired and encouraged Reynolds. Amongst contemporary and subsequent notable physicians he influenced were: the erudite Charlton Bastian (1837-1915); Charles Edward Beevor, (1854-1908); Howard Tooth (1856-1925); James Taylor, (1859-1946) editor of Jackson\u2019s Selected Writings; and the punctilious Thomas Buzzard (1831-1919), his neighbour in Grosvenor Street, and friend of both Hughlings Jackson and David Ferrier (1843-1928).\n\nSuch was Reynolds\u2019s reputation that he was rewarded with both the Lumleian and the Harveian lectures at the Royal College of Physicians of London, becoming President from 1893\u20131895. Like his grandfather, he was physician to the royal household in 1879 and was made a baronet in 1895. He was president of the BMA until his death.\n\nA popular and fluent lecturer, he was shy and serious but had a quiet humour and a \u2018directness of speech that was no respecter of persons.\u2019 Described as courteous, shrewd, and kind, his approach was holistic \u2013 long before it became fashionable:\n\nNot to merely make a diagnosis, much less to write a prescription, but to advise the individual patient what he or she should best do to regain their health\u2026 and what changes in the environment, mental, emotional, or physical were most likely to achieve this end. [2]\n\nMedical works\n\nRussell Reynolds is often remembered for his descriptions of epilepsy, eclamptic convulsions, and febrile convulsions in children [4,5]. He also used electrotherapy in various nervous diseases [6].\n\nInterestingly, he is widely quoted for commending the \u201cgreat value of Cannabis indica\u201d in migraine, epileptic conditions, depression, and asthma. In 1890 he prescribed a cannabis tincture for the menstrual cramps suffered by Queen Victoria. He noted in The Lancet:\n\nWhen pure and administered carefully, [cannabis] is one of the most valuable medicines we possess. [7]\n\nOf greater import was his 1861 paper (Figure 2) that espoused the concept of positive and negative neurological symptoms [5,8]. Positive symptoms were abnormal behaviours that included not only clonic jerking and abnormal movements but also hallucinations and paranoid delusions.\n\nSome symptoms are negative, i.e. they consist in the negation of vital properties. Of this kind are paralysis, anaesthesia, and the like\u2026Other symptoms are positive, i.e. they consist in excess or alteration of vital properties. Of this kind are spasms, pain, convulsions and the like\u2026 (p.9-12, 28)\n\nUnfortunately, he failed to write further on this theme. Like Jackson, Russell Reynolds shrewdly noted that the lesion did not directly cause the symptoms observed.\n\nThe origins of positive and negative symptoms were inextricably intertwined with Herbert Spencer\u2019s ideas of dissolution and evolution of the nervous system [9]. Hughlings Jackson extended Spencer\u2019s idea to patients\u2019 symptoms, both positive and negative. Jackson believed that negative symptoms related to the dissolution of neural function while positive symptoms resulted from excitation or the release of lower levels from higher inhibitory control:\n\nSpeaking of the physical side, there are degrees of loss of function of the least organized nervous arrangements with conservation of function of the more organized. There is in each reduction to a more automatic condition; in each there is dissolution, using this term as Spencer does, as the opposite of evolution. [10]\n\nFigure 2. Reynolds: Epilepsy, its symptoms, treatment and relation to other chronic convulsive diseases. 1861\n\nRussell Reynolds wrote his first book on Vertigo. In 1856 he examined legal pleas for insanity in his Criminal Lunatics: are they Responsible? He believed that epilepsy could be a distinct or \u2018idiopathic\u2019 disease, a controversial view well expressed in The Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, Nerves and their appendages in 1855 (dedicated to Marshall Hall), This was later contradicted by Kinnier Wilson who stated that all epileptic events were symptoms, whether or not any underlying pathology could be demonstrated [11].\n\nAlways inclined to a broad approach he described the interictal symptoms of 62 patients with idiopathic epilepsy. He found about one-third had mild impairment of recent memory and a similar proportion had moderate to severe psychopathological findings. His interpretation of epileptic activity (well described by Eadie) [12] was in large measure approved by Hughlings Jackson.\n\nHe edited and wrote many chapters in A system of medicine (London: Macmillan, in five volumes from 1866 to 1879), a major text rivalled only by John Cooke\u2019s Treatise in Nervous Diseases, published in two volumes, in 1820 and 1823, the second volume of Bright\u2019s Reports of Medical Cases 1831, and Romberg\u2019s Manual of the Nervous Diseases of Man 1840 [13].\n\nRussell Reynolds practiced at a time when neurology was in its infancy. It relied on clinical description and elementary pathology. In this morass of evolving knowledge, Reynolds formulated a classification of neurological diseases that remains the kernel of modern systems. His work in neurology linked the highly original physiological and clinical works of his mentor, Marshall Hall, to Hughlings Jackson\u2019s intellectual explorations of the brain\u2019s complex functions and hierarchies, and to the more systematic descriptive neurology of William Gowers [12]. His students included Charlton Bastian (1837-1915) and Sir William Gowers (1845-1915), whose writings often reflect his influence.\n\nLegacy\n\nHe was well versed in poetry, philosophy, art, and music. He was married, first, to Margaret Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances Crespigny, but left no children. He died aged 68 of \u2018pulmonary congestion\u2019 at his home in 1896.\n\nThe scholarship and clinical advances made by Reynolds can be seen as important influences on contemporary and also later notable neurologists at the National Hospital. He bridged the eras of Victorian Neurology with that of the dawning 20th century.\n\nHe was noted as:\n\nA man of scholarship and wisdom, in his presidential address in 1894, in a spirit of prophecy he warned the subject-ridden student of to day of the danger of becoming entangled in the net of an ill-considered and misunderstood technical phraseology, and of juggling with words when he ought to be dealing with concrete things. [2]\n\nAnd Eadie characterised him as:\n\nA most eminent, scholarly, and influential physician who was greatly respected and admired by his contemporaries\u2026the sort of man whose ideas would not readily be discarded because it might almost seem disrespectful to do so unless a better alternative could be clearly demonstrated to exist. [12]\n\n* So-called dissenters (Catholics, Jews, and Quakers) were denied admission because their religious beliefs prevented their taking an oath to adhere to the 39 articles of the Anglican Church. This was abolished by the Universities Tests Act in 1871.\n\nWomen had studied at Oxford since the 1870s. But until 1921, they were not entitled to claim the degrees they had earned. Cambridge followed in 1947.\n\nReferences\n\nBrown GH. Munk\u2019s Roll. Lives of the Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians of London (1826-1925).

His mother was Caroline Harriets, daughter of Dr Trott. From Westminster School he went to Guy\u2019s Hospital and after two years in practice with his father set up as a full time radiologist in 1920. In World War I he served with the R.A.M.C, in home hospitals until 1917 when he became electrical specialist to the Karachi Brigade in India, returning home in 1919. In 1921 he was appointed physician-in-charge of the X-ray departments of Charing Cross and the National Hospitals; his son, Seymour, succeeded him at Charing Cross in 1946, and he retired from the National Hospital in 1939.\n\nFor many years he was adviser in radiology to the Ministry of Pensions and Supply and an examiner to Cambridge University, the Conjoint Board, the Faculty of Radiologists and the R.A.M.C. On his retirement in 1946 he acted as honorary consulting radiologist to the Charing Cross, National, Samaritan, Bethlem Royal and Lambeth Hospitals, and to the Caernarvon and Anglesey Infirmary.\n\nFrom 1924 he had experimented with methods of cineradiography, pioneering in photofluorography with a very wide aperture camera lens. His success brought worldwide recognition. He was president of the British Institute of Radiology and of the section of radiology of the Royal Society of Medicine, warden of the Fellowship of the Faculty of Radiologists, Hunterian professor of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1936, and was awarded the Antoine Beclere award in Paris in 1957.\n\nIn addition he was made a member of the Canadian Radiological Society, the American Roentgen Ray Society, the New York Roentgen Society, the Association of Physicians of Vienna and the Society of Radiologists of Italy; the Australian College of Radiology elected him a fellow.\n\nHe was the author of many publications, particularly in his specialised field of cineradiography which culminated in the production of the Russell Reynolds cineradiographic unit. His paper on the early history of radiology in Britain was published in Clinical Radiology (1961, 12, 136-42).\n\nReynolds was quiet, unassuming and kindly; his strong personality was shown only in his teaching, which brought him the enthusiasm of students and the deep respect of his colleagues. In 1908 he married Anna Thekla Henriette, daughter of Adolf Romer, a banker. They had two sons, Seymour and Stewart, both of whom became consultant radiologists.\n\nRichard R Trail\n\n[Brit.med.J., 1964, 2, 1271 (p), 1403; Charing Cr. Hosp.

He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851 he graduated M.B. in the university of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852 he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a fellow of the college in 1859. In the same year he was appointed assistant physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, assistant physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 assistant physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865 he became professor of the principles and practice of medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed physician-in-ordinary to the queen's household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 vice-president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian oration in 1884, and was elected president in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a baronet. In the winter of 1895\u20136 he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as president of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, at St Pancras Old Church, London, on 28 August 1852 to Margaretta Susannah Ainslie (1831-1880) and, secondly, to Frances (Plunkett) Reynolds widow of C. J. C. Crespign, but left no children.\n\nThe Reynolds Baronetcy, of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds.[1] The title became extinct on his death.\n\nReynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an Essay on Vertigo; in 1855 Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves, as well as Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity; in 1872 The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the System of Medicine, in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write\u2014compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe.

But his personal life was complicated. Separated from his wife and living in a huge country mansion in Kent, the novelist was in the thrall of his young mistress, Ellen Ternan. This is the untold story of Charles Dickens\u2019 final hours and the furor that followed, as the great writer\u2019s family and friends fought over his final wishes.\n\nMy new research has uncovered the never-before-explored areas of the great author\u2019s sudden death, and his subsequent burial. While details such as the presence of Ternan at the author\u2019s funeral have already been discovered by Dickensian sleuths, what is new and fresh here is the degree of maneuvering and negotiations involved in establishing Dickens\u2019 ultimate resting place.\n\nDickens\u2019 death created an early predicament for his family. Where was he to be buried? Near his home (as he would have wished) or in that great public pantheon, Poet\u2019s Corner in Westminster Abbey (which was clearly against his wishes)?\n\n\u201cThe Inimitable\u201d (as he sometimes referred to himself) was one of the most famous celebrities of his time. No other writer is as closely associated with the Victorian period. As the author of such immortal classics as Oliver Twist, David Copperfield and A Christmas Carol, he was constantly in the public eye. Because of the vivid stories he told, and the causes he championed (including poverty, education, workers\u2019 rights, and the plight of prostitutes), there was great demand for him to represent charities, and appear at public events and visit institutions up and down the country (as well as abroad\u2014particularly in the United States). He moved in the best circles and counted among his friends the top writers, actors, artists and politicians of his day.\n\nDickens was proud of what he achieved as an author and valued his close association with his public. In 1858 he embarked on a career as a professional reader of his own work and thrilled audiences of thousands with his animated performances. This boost to his career occurred at a time when his marital problems came to a head: He fell in love with Ternan, an 18-year-old actress, and separated from his wife, Catherine, with whom he had ten children.\n\nDickens was careful to keep his love affair private. Documentary evidence of his relationship with Ternan is very scarce indeed. He had wanted to take her with him on a reading tour to America in 1868, and even developed a telegraphic code to communicate to her whether or not she should come. She didn\u2019t, because Dickens felt that he could not protect their privacy.\n\nOn Wednesday, June 8, 1870, the author was working on his novel Edwin Drood in the garden of his country home, Gad\u2019s Hill Place, near Rochester, in Kent. He came inside to have dinner with his sister-in-law Georgina Hogarth and suffered a stroke. The local doctor was summoned and remedies were applied without effect. A telegram was sent to London, to summon John Russell Reynolds, one of the top neurologists in the land. By the following day the author\u2019s condition hadn\u2019t changed, and he died at 6:10pm on June 9.\n\nAccepted wisdom concerning Dickens\u2019 death and burial is drawn from an authorized biography published by John Forster: The Life of Charles Dickens. Forster was the author\u2019s closest friend and confidant. He was privy to the most intimate areas of his life, including the time he spent in a blacking (boot polish) warehouse as a young boy (which was a secret, until disclosed by Forster in his book), as well as details of his relationship with Ternan (which were not revealed by Forster, and which remained largely hidden well into the 20th century). Forster sought to protect Dickens\u2019 reputation with the public at all costs.\n\nLast Will and Testament\n\nIn his will (reproduced in Forster\u2019s biography), Dickens had left instructions that he should be:\n\nBuried in an inexpensive, unostentatious, and strictly private manner; that no public announcement be made of the time or place of my burial; that at the utmost not more than three plain mourning coaches be employed; and that those who attend my funeral wear no scarf, cloak, black bow, long hat-band, or other such revolting absurdity.\n\nForster added that Dickens\u2019 preferred place of burial\u2014his Plan A\u2014was \u201cin the small graveyard under Rochester Castle wall, or in the little churches of Cobham or Shorne,\u201d which were all near his country home. However, Forster added: \u201cAll these were found to be closed,\u201d by which he meant unavailable.\n\nPlan B was then put into action. Dickens was set to be buried in Rochester Cathedral, at the direction of the Dean and Chapter (the ecclesiastical governing body). They had even dug a grave for the great man. But this plan too was set aside, in favor of interment in Poets\u2019 Corner, in Westminster Abbey\u2014the resting place of Geoffrey Chaucer, Samuel Johnson and other literary greats.\n\nForster claims in the biography that the media led the way in agitating for burial in the abbey. He singles out the Times, which, in an article of January 13, 1870, \u201ctook the lead in suggesting that the only fit resting place for the remains of a man so dear to England was the abbey in which the most illustrious Englishmen are laid.\u201d He added that when the dean of Westminster, Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, asked Forster and members of the Dickens family to initiate what was now Plan C, and bury him in the abbey, it became their \u201cgrateful duty to accept that offer.\u201d\n\nThe private funeral occurred early in the morning of Tuesday, June 14, 1870, and was attended by 14 mourners. The grave was then left open for three days so that the public could pay their respects to one of the most famous figures of the age. Details of the authorized version of Dickens\u2019 death and burial were carried by newspapers in the English-speaking world and beyond. Dickens\u2019 estranged wife Catherine received a message of condolence from Queen Victoria, expressing \u201cher deepest regret at the sad news of Charles Dickens\u2019s death.\u201d\n\nThe effect that Dickens\u2019 death had on ordinary people may be appreciated from the reaction of a barrow girl who sold fruits and vegetables in Covent Garden Market. When she heard the news, she is reported to have said, \u201cDickens dead? Then will Father Christmas die too?\u201d\n\nThe funeral directors\n\nMy investigation has revealed, however, how Dickens\u2019 burial in Poets\u2019 Corner was engineered by Forster and Stanley to satisfy their personal aims, rather than the author\u2019s own. While the official story was that it was the \u201cwill of the people\u201d to have Dickens buried in the abbey (and there were articles in the Times to this effect), the reality was that this alteration suited both the biographer and the churchman.\n\nForster could conclude the volume he was contemplating in a fitting manner, by having Dickens interred in the national pantheon where so many famous literary figures were buried. He thus ensured that a stream of visitors would make a pilgrimage to Dickens\u2019 grave and spread his reputation far and wide, for posterity.\n\nStanley could add Dickens to his roll of famous people whose burials he conducted. They included Lord Palmerston, the former U.K. prime minister; mathematician and astronomer Sir John Herschel; missionary and explorer David Livingstone; and Sir Rowland Hill, the postal reformer and originator of the penny post.\n\nThe efforts of Forster and Stanley to get Dickens buried exactly where they wanted enhanced the reputations of both men. For each of them, the interment of Dickens in the abbey might be considered the highlight of their careers.\n\n\u201cMr. Dickens very ill, most urgent\u201d\n\nThe new evidence was gathered from libraries, archives and cathedral vaults and prove beyond a doubt that any claims about the Westminster burial being the will of the people are false.\n\nWhat emerges is an atmosphere of urgency in the Dickens household after the author collapsed. Dickens\u2019 son Charley sent the telegram to the author\u2019s staff in London, requesting urgent medical assistance from the eminent neurologist, John Russell Reynolds:\n\nGo without losing a moment to Russell Reynolds thirty eight Grosvenor St Grosvenor Sqr tell him to come by next train to Higham or Rochester to mee t\u2026 Beard (Dickens\u2019s physician), at Gadshill \u2026 Mr Dickens very ill most urgent.\n\nDickens\u2019 sister-in-law Georgina Hogarth, who ran his household and cared for his children after the separation from Catherine, was clearly disappointed that the specialist could do nothing for her much-adored brother-in-law. She sent a note to her solicitor with the doctor\u2019s fee: \u201cI enclose Dr Reynolds\u2019 demand (of \u00a320) for his fruitless visit.\u201d\n\nDean Stanley had met Dickens in 1870, after being introduced by the churchman\u2019s brother-in-law, Frederick Locker, who was a friend of the novelist. Stanley confided to his private journal (now housed in the archives of Westminster Abbey) that he was \u201cmuch struck\u201d by his conversation with Dickens and appreciated the few opportunities he had to meet the author before he died.\n\nLocker\u2019s memoir also records an interesting conversation he had with Stanley before this 1870 meeting, which sheds light on the dean\u2019s attitude towards the novelist, his death and funeral. Locker writes about talking to Stanley \u201cof the burials in the abbey\u201d and they discussed the names of some \u201cdistinguished people.\u201d Stanley told him there were \u201ccertain people\u201d he would be \u201cobliged to refuse\u201d burial, on account of personal antipathies. But his attitude changed when the name of the author \u201ccame up\u201d and he said he \u201cshould like to meet Dickens.\u201d Then, to \u201cgratify\u201d Stanley\u2019s \u201cpious wish,\u201d Locker asked Dickens and his daughter to dine. Thus even while Dickens was still alive, Stanley privately expressed a desire to bury him.\n\nWhen the end came, Locker conveyed the news to his brother-in-law on that very day\u2014June 9. The dean wrote to Locker to say:\n\nAlas! \u2013 how soon we have been overtaken by the event which we were anticipating as so distant. I cannot amply thank you for having given me the opportunity of having met Charles Dickens while there was yet time. You will gather from what I have already said that I am quite prepared to raise any proposals about the burial that may be made to me.\n\nThe letter is fascinating. On the very day of the famous author\u2019s death, the dean was already thinking about burial in the abbey. But there was a catch: Stanley could only entertain such a proposal if it came from the family and executors. He could not act unilaterally.\n\nLocker quickly seized the opportunity hinted at in Stanley\u2019s letter and sent a copy of it to Charley Dickens (the author\u2019s son) on June 10. He wrote in his covering note: \u201cI wish to send you a copy of a letter that I have just received from Dean Stanley and I think it will explain itself. If I can be of any use pray tell me.\u201d\n\nFalse claims and ambition\n\nMeanwhile, the idea of getting Dickens to Poets\u2019 Corner was growing in Stanley\u2019s imagination. He wrote to his cousin Louisa on Saturday, June 11, to say \u201cI never met (Dickens) till this year \u2026 And now he is gone \u2026 and it is not improbable that I may bury him.\u201d It\u2019s interesting how quickly the plan crystallized in the dean\u2019s mind. Within the space of 48 hours, he went from hypothetical proposals from the family for burial to foreseeing a key role for himself in the proceedings.\n\nHowever, an answer from Charley Dickens wasn\u2019t forthcoming. Stanley waited until the morning of Monday, June 13, before seeking another way of making his wishes known to the family. He got in touch with his friend Lord Houghton (formerly Rickard Monckton Milnes\u2014a poet, politician and friend of Dickens), reiterating his preparedness \u201cto receive any proposal for (Dickens\u2019s) burial in the Abbey\u201d and asking Houghton to \u201cact as you think best.\u201d\n\nIt was at this point in the proceedings that Forster took charge of the planning. He had been away in Cornwall when Dickens died and it took him two days to reach Gad\u2019s Hill. When he reached Dickens\u2019 country home on Saturday, June 11, he was overcome with grief at the death of his friend and clearly unprepared for the suddenness with which the blow was struck. His first thoughts, and those of the immediate family, were to accede to Dickens\u2019 wishes and have him buried close to home. While the official account, in his Life of Dickens, claims that the graveyards in the vicinity of his home were \u201cclosed,\u201d an examination of the records of the churches in Cobham and Shorne demonstrates this to be false.\n\nThe proposed burial in Rochester Cathedral was not only advanced, but in fact finalized, costed and invoiced. The chapter archives demonstrate that a grave was in fact dug in St Mary\u2019s Chapel by the building firm Foord & Sons. The records also show that the cathedral authorities \u201cbelieved, as they still believe (after Dickens was buried in the Abbey), that no more fitting or honourable spot for his sepulture could be found than amidst scenes to which he was fondly attached, and amongst those by whom he was personally known as a neighbour and held in such honour.\u201d\n\nThese views are reinforced by the claims of Hogarth, Dickens\u2019 sister-in-law, in a letter to a friend: \u201cWe should have preferred Rochester Cathedral, and it was a great disappointment to the people there that we had to give way to the larger demand.\u201d\n\nThis \u201clarger demand\u201d came\u2014at least in part\u2014from a leader that appeared in the Times on Monday, June 13. It concluded:\n\nLet (Dickens) lie in the Abbey. Where Englishmen gather to review the memorials of the great masters and teachers of their nation, the ashes and the name of the greatest instructor of the nineteenth century should not be absent.\n\nDespite this appeal appearing in the press, Stanley\u2019s private journal records that he still \u201chad received no application from any person in authority,\u201d and so \u201ctook no steps\u201d to advance his burial plan.\n\nStanley\u2019s prayers must have seemed answered, then, when Forster and Charley Dickens appeared at the door of the Deanery on that same day. According to the dean, after they sat down, Forster said to Stanley, \u201cI imagine the article in the Times must have been written with your concurrence?\u201d Stanley replied, \u201cNo, I had no concern with it, but at the same time I had given it privately to be understood that I would consent to the interment if it was demanded.\u201d By this Stanley meant the letter he had sent to Locker, which the latter had forwarded to Charley. Stanley of course agreed to the request from Dickens\u2019 representatives for burial in Poets\u2019 Corner. What he refrains from saying is how much he personally was looking forward to officiating at an event of such national significance.\n\nWhile it\u2019s clear, from the private correspondence, that Stanley agitated for Dickens\u2019 burial in the abbey, the actions of Forster are harder to trace. He left fewer clues about his intentions and he destroyed all of his working notes for his monumental three-volume biography of Dickens. These documents included many letters from the author. Forster used Dickens\u2019 correspondence liberally in his account. In fact, the only source we have for most of the letters from Dickens to Forster are the passages that appear in the biography.\n\nBut as well as showing how Forster falsely claimed in his biography that the graveyards near his home were \u201cclosed,\u201d my research also reveals how he altered the words of Stanley\u2019s (published) funeral sermon to suit his own version of events. Forster quoted Stanley as saying that Dickens\u2019 grave \u201cwould thenceforward be a sacred one with both the New World and the Old, as that of the representative of the literature, not of this island only, but of all who speak our English tongue.\u201d This, however, is a misquotation of the sermon, in which Stanley actually said:\n\nMany, many are the feet which have trodden and will tread the consecrated ground around that narrow grave; many, many are the hearts which both in the Old and in the New World are drawn towards it, as towards the resting-place of a dear personal friend; many are the flowers that have been strewed, many the tears shed, by the grateful affection of \u2018the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and those that had none to help them.\u2019\n\nStanley worked with Forster to achieve their common aim. In 1872, when Forster sent Stanley a copy of the first volume of his Life of Dickens, the dean wrote:\n\nYou are very good to speak so warmly of any assistance I may have rendered in carrying out your wishes and the desire of the country on the occasion of the funeral. The recollection of it will always be treasured amongst the most interesting of the various experiences which I have traversed in my official life.\n\nFor the ages\n\nMy research demonstrates that the official, authorized accounts of the lives and deaths of the rich and famous are open to question and forensic investigation\u2014even long after their histories have been written and accepted as canonical. Celebrity is a manufactured commodity, that depends for its effect on the degree to which the fan (which comes from the word \u201cfanatic\u201d) can be manipulated into believing a particular story about the person whom he or she adores.\n\nIn the case of Dickens, two people who had intimate involvement in preserving his reputation for posterity were not doing so for altruistic reasons: There was something in it for each of them. Stanley interred the mortal remains of Dickens in the principal shrine of British artistic greatness. This ensured that his tomb became a site of pilgrimage, where the great and the good would come to pay their respects\u2014including the prince of Wales, who laid a wreath on Dickens\u2019 grave in 2012, to mark the bicentenary of his birth.\n\nSuch public commemorations of this Victorian superstar carry special meaning and mystique for his many fans. This year, on February 7 (the anniversary of his birth), Armando Iannucci (director of the new film adaptation The Personal History of David Copperfield) is scheduled to give the toast to \u201cthe immortal memory\u201d at a special dinner hosted by the Dickens Fellowship\u2014a worldwide association of admirers. The 150th anniversary of his death will be observed at Westminster Abbey on June 8, 2020.\n\nWhether it\u2019s the remembrance of the author\u2019s death or his birth, these public acts symbolize how essential Dickens is to Britain\u2019s national culture. None of this would have been possible, however, had it not been for the involvement of Dickens\u2019 best friend and executor, John Forster. Forster organized the private funeral in Westminster Abbey in accordance with Dickens\u2019 wishes, and ensured that his lover Ellen Ternan could discreetly attend, and that his estranged wife would not. But he is also the man who overruled the expectations of the author for a local burial. Instead, through an act of institutionally sanctioned bodysnatching, the grave in Poets\u2019 Corner bound Dickens forever in the public mind with the ideals of national life and art and provided a fitting conclusion to Forster\u2019s carefully considered, strategically constructed biography. It ends with these words:\n\nFacing the grave, and on its left and right, are the monuments of Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Dryden, the three immortals who did most to create and settle the language to which Charles Dickens has given another undying name.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

He followed and developed Hughlings Jackson\u2019s original ideas about positive and negative neurological symptoms. His approach to patients was holistic at a time when more objectively defined notions of illness dominated medicine. He wrote on vertigo, and about criminal lunacy, and his book The Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, Nerves and their appendages was a major text of the period.\n\nWell versed in poetry, philosophy, art, and music, he was widely admired. He became President of the Royal College of Physicians.\n\nLike the great Sir Jonathan Hutchinson and other Victorians of privileged stock, Sir John Russell Reynolds (1828\u20131896) (Figure 1) never attended school. His father, a nonconformist minister at Romsey in Hampshire, educated him personally. His grandfather Henry Revell Reynolds (1745-1811), FRS, was an illustrious physician at the Middlesex and St Thomas\u2019s Hospitals and Physician to George III.\n\nFigure 1: Sir J Russell Reynolds. [Published in British Medical Journal, 6 June 1896)\n\nAs a nonconformist he was excluded from Oxford and Cambridge* and read Medicine at University College London, graduating with a gold medal in physiology, comparative anatomy, and medicine in 1851 [1]. An impecunious young doctor, he sought a living, practicing in Leeds where his brother was a Minister of the East Parade Mission Chapel, and his brother-in-law a journalist on the Leeds Mercury.\n\nA year later his former teacher Marshall Hall, FRS. (1790-1857), a physician and brilliant experimental physiologist persuaded him to return to London [2], where at modest cost Hall let him live in his home at 38, Grosvenor Street and join his Consultant practice, mainly in nervous diseases.\n\nOnly four years after graduating Russell Reynolds\u2019 outstanding ability led to his appointment as assistant physician at the Hospital for Sick Children and to the Westminster and University College Hospitals. There he became Holme Professor of Clinical Medicine in 1862, and in 1867 succeeding Sir William Jenner as Professor of Medicine. Just five years after the opening of the National Hospital for the Relief and Cure of Paralysis and Epilepsy, Russell Reynolds showed his interest in neurology and was appointed to its staff. He was elected FRS on 3rd June 1869.\n\nAt this time neurology began to flourish; he worked with many distinguished early neurologists. They included Hughlings Jackson (1835-1911), Jabez Ramskill (1825-1897), Charles Bland Radcliffe (1822\u20131889) who succeeded Brown\u2013S\u00e9quard in 1863, and published Lectures on Epilepsy, Pain, Paralysis, and certain other disorders of the Nervous System, 1864, and articles in Reynolds\u2019s System of Medicine. His brother John Netten Radcliffe (c. 1830-1884), a pioneering epidemiologist, was also Medical Superintendent of the Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic.\n\nNo man works in a vacuum. Marshall Hall, (who in spite of his acknowledged distinction [3] surprisingly had failed to get an academic post in London) inspired and encouraged Reynolds. Amongst contemporary and subsequent notable physicians he influenced were: the erudite Charlton Bastian (1837-1915); Charles Edward Beevor, (1854-1908); Howard Tooth (1856-1925); James Taylor, (1859-1946) editor of Jackson\u2019s Selected Writings; and the punctilious Thomas Buzzard (1831-1919), his neighbour in Grosvenor Street, and friend of both Hughlings Jackson and David Ferrier (1843-1928).\n\nSuch was Reynolds\u2019s reputation that he was rewarded with both the Lumleian and the Harveian lectures at the Royal College of Physicians of London, becoming President from 1893\u20131895. Like his grandfather, he was physician to the royal household in 1879 and was made a baronet in 1895. He was president of the BMA until his death.\n\nA popular and fluent lecturer, he was shy and serious but had a quiet humour and a \u2018directness of speech that was no respecter of persons.\u2019 Described as courteous, shrewd, and kind, his approach was holistic \u2013 long before it became fashionable:\n\nNot to merely make a diagnosis, much less to write a prescription, but to advise the individual patient what he or she should best do to regain their health\u2026 and what changes in the environment, mental, emotional, or physical were most likely to achieve this end. [2]\n\nMedical works\n\nRussell Reynolds is often remembered for his descriptions of epilepsy, eclamptic convulsions, and febrile convulsions in children [4,5]. He also used electrotherapy in various nervous diseases [6].\n\nInterestingly, he is widely quoted for commending the \u201cgreat value of Cannabis indica\u201d in migraine, epileptic conditions, depression, and asthma. In 1890 he prescribed a cannabis tincture for the menstrual cramps suffered by Queen Victoria. He noted in The Lancet:\n\nWhen pure and administered carefully, [cannabis] is one of the most valuable medicines we possess. [7]\n\nOf greater import was his 1861 paper (Figure 2) that espoused the concept of positive and negative neurological symptoms [5,8]. Positive symptoms were abnormal behaviours that included not only clonic jerking and abnormal movements but also hallucinations and paranoid delusions.\n\nSome symptoms are negative, i.e. they consist in the negation of vital properties. Of this kind are paralysis, anaesthesia, and the like\u2026Other symptoms are positive, i.e. they consist in excess or alteration of vital properties. Of this kind are spasms, pain, convulsions and the like\u2026 (p.9-12, 28)\n\nUnfortunately, he failed to write further on this theme. Like Jackson, Russell Reynolds shrewdly noted that the lesion did not directly cause the symptoms observed.\n\nThe origins of positive and negative symptoms were inextricably intertwined with Herbert Spencer\u2019s ideas of dissolution and evolution of the nervous system [9]. Hughlings Jackson extended Spencer\u2019s idea to patients\u2019 symptoms, both positive and negative. Jackson believed that negative symptoms related to the dissolution of neural function while positive symptoms resulted from excitation or the release of lower levels from higher inhibitory control:\n\nSpeaking of the physical side, there are degrees of loss of function of the least organized nervous arrangements with conservation of function of the more organized. There is in each reduction to a more automatic condition; in each there is dissolution, using this term as Spencer does, as the opposite of evolution. [10]\n\nFigure 2. Reynolds: Epilepsy, its symptoms, treatment and relation to other chronic convulsive diseases. 1861\n\nRussell Reynolds wrote his first book on Vertigo. In 1856 he examined legal pleas for insanity in his Criminal Lunatics: are they Responsible? He believed that epilepsy could be a distinct or \u2018idiopathic\u2019 disease, a controversial view well expressed in The Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, Nerves and their appendages in 1855 (dedicated to Marshall Hall), This was later contradicted by Kinnier Wilson who stated that all epileptic events were symptoms, whether or not any underlying pathology could be demonstrated [11].\n\nAlways inclined to a broad approach he described the interictal symptoms of 62 patients with idiopathic epilepsy. He found about one-third had mild impairment of recent memory and a similar proportion had moderate to severe psychopathological findings. His interpretation of epileptic activity (well described by Eadie) [12] was in large measure approved by Hughlings Jackson.\n\nHe edited and wrote many chapters in A system of medicine (London: Macmillan, in five volumes from 1866 to 1879), a major text rivalled only by John Cooke\u2019s Treatise in Nervous Diseases, published in two volumes, in 1820 and 1823, the second volume of Bright\u2019s Reports of Medical Cases 1831, and Romberg\u2019s Manual of the Nervous Diseases of Man 1840 [13].\n\nRussell Reynolds practiced at a time when neurology was in its infancy. It relied on clinical description and elementary pathology. In this morass of evolving knowledge, Reynolds formulated a classification of neurological diseases that remains the kernel of modern systems. His work in neurology linked the highly original physiological and clinical works of his mentor, Marshall Hall, to Hughlings Jackson\u2019s intellectual explorations of the brain\u2019s complex functions and hierarchies, and to the more systematic descriptive neurology of William Gowers [12]. His students included Charlton Bastian (1837-1915) and Sir William Gowers (1845-1915), whose writings often reflect his influence.\n\nLegacy\n\nHe was well versed in poetry, philosophy, art, and music. He was married, first, to Margaret Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances Crespigny, but left no children. He died aged 68 of \u2018pulmonary congestion\u2019 at his home in 1896.\n\nThe scholarship and clinical advances made by Reynolds can be seen as important influences on contemporary and also later notable neurologists at the National Hospital. He bridged the eras of Victorian Neurology with that of the dawning 20th century.\n\nHe was noted as:\n\nA man of scholarship and wisdom, in his presidential address in 1894, in a spirit of prophecy he warned the subject-ridden student of to day of the danger of becoming entangled in the net of an ill-considered and misunderstood technical phraseology, and of juggling with words when he ought to be dealing with concrete things. [2]\n\nAnd Eadie characterised him as:\n\nA most eminent, scholarly, and influential physician who was greatly respected and admired by his contemporaries\u2026the sort of man whose ideas would not readily be discarded because it might almost seem disrespectful to do so unless a better alternative could be clearly demonstrated to exist. [12]\n\n* So-called dissenters (Catholics, Jews, and Quakers) were denied admission because their religious beliefs prevented their taking an oath to adhere to the 39 articles of the Anglican Church. This was abolished by the Universities Tests Act in 1871.\n\nWomen had studied at Oxford since the 1870s. But until 1921, they were not entitled to claim the degrees they had earned. Cambridge followed in 1947.\n\nReferences\n\nBrown GH. Munk\u2019s Roll. Lives of the Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians of London (1826-1925).

He asserts he is entitled to a new trial because a computer malfunction resulted in part of the transcript of his jury trial being unavailable for appeal. We conclude that the record was properly settled pursuant to W.R.A.P. 3.03 and 3.04, and Mr. Reynolds has failed to demonstrate the settled record is insufficient or the settlement process could not have been used to collect the information he claims is still missing.\n\n[\u00b62] We affirm.\n\nISSUE\n\n[\u00b63] Mr. Reynolds presents the following issue on appeal:\n\nIs the record too incomplete to provide appellant a meaningful appeal?\n\nThe State provides a more detailed statement of the issue:\n\nAfter Reynolds filed his notice of appeal, the court reporter discovered that a computer malfunction had destroyed her electronic notes covering jury selection, opening statements, and the first trial witness. The court and parties settled the record by reconstructing the missing portions as prescribed by Wyo. R. App. P. 3.03 and 3.04. In his brief, Reynolds identifies four substantive issues that he contends are outside the purview of meaningful appellate review because of the state of the record. Would the settled record allow a meaningful review of Reynolds\u2019 conviction on each of these issues if he had chosen to present their merits to this Court with cogent argument and supporting authority?\n\nFACTS\n\n[\u00b64] At 4:24 p.m. on October 24, 2010, the Campbell County Sheriff\u2019s Department received a REDDI (Report Every Drunk Driver Immediately) report from Arrow Langston. She reported a green Ford Ranger pickup was traveling at varying speeds and weaving across the road on Highway 59 near Wright, Wyoming. Ms. Langston did not feel comfortable getting close enough to the vehicle to read the license plate, but she continued to follow it and reported to the 911 operator that the vehicle had parked at Hank\u2019s Bar and Lounge.\n\n[\u00b65] Deputy Mark Raymond was dispatched to Hank\u2019s Bar and Lounge but could not locate the vehicle. A few minutes later an anonymous caller made a second REDDI report. Responding to that call, the deputy located a green Ford Ranger pickup parked off the road at milepost 79 on Highway 59 and Mr. Reynolds sitting in the driver\u2019s seat talking on his cell phone. The truck was running, but when the deputy approached, Mr. Reynolds turned it off, removed the key and threw it onto the passenger side floor board.\n\n[\u00b66] The deputy smelled alcohol on Mr. Reynolds\u2019 breath and there was a twelve pack container of beer on the passenger seat and a spilled beer on the floor. Mr. Reynolds told the deputy that he had consumed only one beer, but he refused to perform field sobriety maneuvers or take a portable breath test. Deputy Raymond arrested him for driving while under the influence of alcohol.\n\n[\u00b67] At the jail, Mr. Reynolds refused to take a breath test in accordance with the Wyoming implied consent law1 but later he requested and was given a portable breath test, which showed the presence of alcohol in his system. Mr. Reynolds was charged with driving while under the influence and, because it was his fourth offense in ten years, the charge was a felony under Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 31-5-233(b)(iii)(A) and (e) (LexisNexis 2010). He pleaded not guilty and the matter was tried to a jury. The jury returned a guilty verdict, and the district court sentenced Mr. Reynolds to twenty to twenty-four months incarceration.\n\n[\u00b68] Mr. Reynolds filed a notice of appeal and requested the trial transcript be prepared for appeal. The court reporter stated that she had experienced computer problems and the record of the morning session of the trial was lost and could not be transcribed. The missing session included voir dire, opening statements and the testimony of the first witness, Ms. Langston.\n\n[\u00b69] Mr. Reynolds\u2019 trial counsel filed a \u201cSupplemental to Transcript,\u201d in which he stated that he could not reconstruct the voir dire and asked that the following information about Ms. Langston\u2019s testimony be used to \u201ccomplete\u201d the transcript:\n\nThe First witness was Arrow Langston who observed a green pickup truck being [driven] erratically on Highway 59 until it pulled off and parked at Hanks Bar. She did not get close enough to see the license plate and could not identify the driver. She did call in a Reddi report.\n\nThe State responded with objections and proposed amendments pursuant to W.R.A.P. 3.03 and 3.04. The State\u2019s response was compiled from notes taken by the State\u2019s paralegal during the trial, the recollection of the district judge\u2019s law clerk who attended the entire trial and the prosecutor\u2019s recollection and notes. It included summaries of the parties\u2019 opening statements and a detailed rendition of Ms. Langston\u2019s direct, cross examination and redirect testimony.\n\n[\u00b610] Mr. Reynolds\u2019 appellate counsel filed a motion to correct or modify the record on appeal pursuant to W.R.A.P. 3.04 asking that the record be supplemented with the parties\u2019 earlier submissions and an additional proposed supplement. The motion stated that appellate counsel had attempted to \u201cobtain recollection of the trial from State\u2019s counsel, defense counsel, and Mr. Reynolds.\u201d The filings did not include any new substantive information regarding the trial proceedings or any objections to the State\u2019s earlier submission, although the proposed supplement did state: \u201cConsultation with Mr. Reynolds reveals that Mr. Reynolds, after this lapse of time, cannot reconstruct the cross-examination of the first witness, but Mr. Reynolds recalls the cross-examination as being extremely important to his defense.\u201d\n\n[\u00b611] After considering the various filings, the district court entered an Order Settling and Approving Statement of Evidence. It confirmed the accuracy of the defense trial counsel\u2019s submission and the State\u2019s response and provided its own detailed recollection of the voir dire.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n[\u00b612] Because the issue in this case requires our independent determination of the sufficiency of the record on appeal, our standard of review is de novo. See generally, Eaton v. State, 2008 WY 97, \u00b6\u00b6 101-102, 192 P.3d 36, 78 (Wyo. 2008); Bearpaw v. State, 803 P.2d 70, 78-79 (Wyo. 1990).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n[\u00b613] The court reporter is charged with producing the official transcript of criminal proceedings, including the trial, and filing the transcript as part of the official court record. See Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 5-3-403 through 5-3-406 (LexisNexis 2011); Bromley v. State, 2009 WY 133, \u00b6 17, 219 P.3d 110, 115 (Wyo. 2009). A criminal defendant is entitled to have his entire trial recorded and available for appeal. In Bearpaw, 803 P.2d at 78-79, we examined an early Wyoming decision which discussed a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a complete record for appeal, Richardson v. State, 15 Wyo. 465, 484, 89 P. 1027, 1034-35 (1907):\n\nIn its early years, this court determined \u201c[t]here is no more reason for permitting a party to be deprived of his legal rights through a failure or a refusal of the official stenographer to perform his duties than through the failure or refusal of the judge or any other officer of the court to perform a duty imposed by law.\u201d [Richardson, 89 P.] at 1030. The court recognized an absolute right of appeal in a criminal case and the corollary right to be provided a complete record. Otherwise, the court noted, the defendant is effectively deprived of the right of appeal. Richardson held that a new trial is required when a necessary record is absent.\n\nWe also discussed several cases from other jurisdictions with favor:\n\n[T]he rule that a mandatory requirement for the court reporter to record all proceedings in a criminal case establishes a principle which cannot be overridden by any local practice, United States v. Brumley, 560 F.2d 1268 (5th Cir.1977). That court, in quoting United States v. Selva, 559 F.2d 1303, 1306 (5th Cir.1977), emphasized that \u201c'[w]hen . . . a criminal defendant is represented on appeal by counsel other than the attorney at trial, the absence of a substantial and significant portion . . . of the record\u2019 will result in a presumption of prejudice sufficient to mandate reversal * * *.\u201d Brumley, 560 F.2d at 1281.\n\nBearpaw, 803 P.2d at 79.\n\n[\u00b614] Wyoming court rules, however, provide an alternative means of producing a record on appeal when a transcript is not available. See generally Barela v. State, 936 P.2d 66, 69 (Wyo. 1997). Under W.R.A.P. 3.03 and 3.04, the district court may settle the record when a transcript is unavailable or does not accurately reflect the court proceedings. W.R.A.P. 3.03 states:\n\nIf no report of the evidence or proceedings at a hearing or trial was made, or if a transcript is unavailable, appellant may prepare a statement of the evidence or proceedings from the best available means including appellant\u2019s recollection. The statement shall be filed and served on appellee within 35 days of the filing of the notice of appeal. Appellee may file and serve objections or propose amendments within 15 days after service. The trial court shall, within 10 days, enter its order settling and approving the statement of evidence, which shall be included by the clerk of the trial court in the record on appeal.\n\nW.R.A.P. 3.04 states:\n\nIf any difference arises as to whether the record discloses what occurred in the trial court, the difference shall be submitted to and settled by that court and the record made to conform to the truth. If anything material to either party is omitted from the record by error or accident or is misstated, the parties by stipulation, or the trial court either before or after the record is transmitted to the appellate court, or the appellate court on motion or its own initiative, may direct that the omission or misstatement be corrected, and if necessary that a supplemental record be certified and transmitted. All other questions as to the form and content of the record shall be presented to the appellate court by motion.\n\n[\u00b615] Unlike in Bearpaw, the parties in the case at bar used the procedures available under Rules 3.03 and 3.04, and the district court settled the record. Mr. Reynolds did not object to the settlement of the record or provide any additional information. The importance of the Rule 3.03 and 3.04 process is shown in other cases where we have rejected criminal defendants\u2019 claims that the record was inadequate when no effort was made to settle it. See, e.g., Eaton, \u00b6\u00b6 101-02, 192 P.3d at 78; Petersen v. State, 594 P.2d 978, 979-80 (Wyo. 1979) (applying former rule).\n\n[\u00b616] Because Fed. R. App. P. 10(c)2 is very similar to our Rule 3.03, we look to federal precedent for guidance as to the adequacy of the record on appeal. See, e.g., DeLoge v. State, 2010 WY 60, \u00b6 17, 231 P.3d 862, 865 (Wyo. 2010); Bromley, \u00b6 18, 219 P.3d at 115. Federal decisions emphasize the importance of the record settlement process and have noted the difficulty of challenging a district court\u2019s reconstruction of missing portions of transcripts. 16A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Juris. \u00a7 3956.3 (4th ed. 2012). \u201cIn rare cases, however, a party may persuade the court of appeals that the effort to reconstruct the record does not afford a sufficient foundation for effective review and that the case must be retried.\u201d Id. The Ninth Circuit conducted a comprehensive review of criminal and civil cases addressing the sufficiency of a reconstructed record and adopted the following analysis:\n\n[A]n appellant seeking a new trial because of a missing or incomplete transcript must 1) make a specific allegation of error; 2) show that the defect in the record materially affects the ability of the appeals court to review the alleged error; and 3) show that a Rule 10(c) [here, Rule 3.03] proceeding has failed or would fail to produce an adequate substitute for the evidence.\n\nBergerco, U.S.A. v. Shipping Corp. of India, Ltd., 896 F.2d 1210, 1217 (9th Cir. 1990).\n\n[\u00b617] The Bergerco test fulfills a number of purposes. It helps us identify when a substantial and significant portion of the record is absent, thereby adversely impacting the appellant\u2019s right of appeal. Bearpaw, 803 P.2d at 79. It also recognizes that a defect in the record will not result in reversal if the existing record is sufficient to review an alleged error. See Lucero v. State, 14 P.3d 920, 922 (Wyo. 2000) (refusing to grant the appellant a new trial even though the record did not include a transcript of the jury instruction conference because we were able to review the allegation of error from the existing record). Additionally, the test recognizes an appellant\u2019s responsibility to attempt to reconstruct the record using the rules of appellate procedure. See United States v. Williams, 2009 WL 4506411, p. 3-4 (D.Colo. 2009); United States v. Locust, 95 Fed. Appx. 507, 51213 (4th Cir. 2004) (recognizing appellants may not be entitled to a new trial if they do not attempt to reconstruct the record through the Fed. R. App. P. 10(c) process). In sum, the Bergerco test properly balances a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a record of his criminal proceedings with his obligation to participate in the process of creating an alternative record when the transcript is not available.\n\n[\u00b618] Mr. Reynolds identifies a number of issues which he asserts the settled record is insufficient to resolve. His first argument pertains to the district court\u2019s ruling that the recording of Ms. Langston\u2019s REDDI report could be played for the jury. The recording was played during the testimony of the 911 dispatcher who took Ms. Langston\u2019s REDDI call. Defense counsel objected to the recording because it was improper \u201cvouching,\u201d was not relevant and Ms. Langston had already testified. The district court overruled the objection, stating that \u201cit\u2019s either [a] prior consistent statement or prior inconsistent statement depending upon how it compares with the testimony.\u201d\n\n[\u00b619] On appeal, Mr. Reynolds does not identify the legal basis for his claim that the district court erroneously allowed the recording into evidence or provide any legal analysis to support his claim. As such, he has failed to make a specific allegation of error as required by the first factor of the Bergerco test. The second and third factors require Mr. Reynolds to demonstrate that the defect in the record materially affects our ability to review his claim and that the Rule 3.03 process failed to produce an adequate substitute for the transcript. Mr. Reynolds argues the statement of the evidence is insufficient to allow proper review of this issue because it does not describe Ms. Langston\u2019s testimony in sufficient detail to determine whether the trial court\u2019s ruling was correct.\n\n[\u00b620] As we described earlier, the defense provided a general statement of Ms. Langston\u2019s testimony and the State supplemented it with a more detailed statement. The State\u2019s submission included nearly two full pages describing Ms. Langston\u2019s direct, cross examination and redirect testimony. The district court confirmed the parties\u2019 submissions as accurate recollections of Ms. Langston\u2019s testimony, and Mr. Reynolds did not object to the statement as being incomplete or submit additional information relating to the supposedly missing parts of Ms. Langston\u2019s testimony. He also does not specify on appeal what specific information would be necessary for him to properly present the issue. Under these circumstances, Mr. Reynolds cannot be heard to complain that the record is incomplete, if, indeed, it could be considered so.\n\n[\u00b621] In his second issue, Mr. Reynolds claims the record is insufficient to evaluate the effectiveness of his trial counsel. He provides two \u201cexamples\u201d of possible ineffectiveness. First, he asserts his trial counsel may have improperly opened the door to admission of the second REDDI report when he mentioned it in his opening statement and he needs the transcript of the opening statement in order to effectively evaluate whether his counsel was effective. He also claims that his counsel may have been ineffective by stipulating that he was driving the vehicle when Deputy Raymond encountered him.\n\n[\u00b622] Both of Mr. Reynolds\u2019 claims fail to satisfy the third Bergerco element because he does not establish that the Rule 3.03 proceeding, had it been properly used, would have failed to produce an adequate substitute for the transcript. He made no effort to reconstruct the portions of the transcript which would have shown these alleged errors, i.e., the opening statement and the part of the record where the stipulation was presented to the jury, and he does not explain why such an effort would have been unsuccessful.\n\n[\u00b623] In addition, with regard to his first claim of ineffectiveness, Mr. Reynolds fails to fulfill the other Bergerco elements because the available transcript clearly shows that defense counsel objected to the admission of the contents of the second REDDI report and the district court partially upheld his objection. The district court ruled that the State could present evidence of the second REDDI report to establish the reason the dispatcher sent the deputy to the location where he encountered Mr. Reynolds, but the report itself could not be played for the jury. On appeal, Mr. Reynolds does not provide any legal analysis showing that the limited admission of the evidence of the second REDDI report was erroneous. He has not demonstrated that, even if his attorney referred to the report in his opening statement, he somehow opened the door to improper evidence. Mr. Reynolds has, therefore, failed to make a specific allegation of error or show that the missing parts of the transcript materially affect our ability to review this issue.\n\n[\u00b624] Mr. Reynolds\u2019 second claim of ineffective assistance of counsel suffers from similar problems. He questions his trial counsel\u2019s decision to stipulate that he was \u201cdriving\u201d the vehicle when, in fact, he was parked when Deputy Raymond contacted him. He claims the lack of a record of whether the stipulation was presented to the jury, and if so how it was done, hampers his ability to prove his attorney was ineffective for entering into the stipulation.\n\n[\u00b625] The extant parts of the record demonstrate that Mr. Reynolds stipulated that he would not \u201craise a defense to the element that he was driving a motor vehicle at the time of the stop by Deputy Mark Raymond on October 24, 2010.\u201d Defense counsel entered into the stipulation to avoid the State\u2019s introduction of W.R.E. 404(b) evidence that Mr. Reynolds had already been convicted in circuit court of two other crimes resulting from the same incident\u2014driving while under suspension and driving with an open container. By entering into the stipulation, the defense was able to keep evidence of the other convictions from the jury.\n\n[\u00b626] The available record clearly shows what was stipulated and why. Mr. Reynolds has not demonstrated that the unavailability of the portion of the trial transcript where the stipulation was read to the jury (if it was) would materially impact our ability to review his claim that his counsel was ineffective for entering into the stipulation. Despite having the information from the record, Mr. Reynolds does not provide any legal analysis of his ineffectiveness claim; consequently, we decline to address it. See Fix v. South Wilderness Ranch Homeowners Ass\u2019n, 2012 WY 96, \u00b6 15, 280 P.3d 527, 531-32 (Wyo. 2012) (stating we do not consider issues not supported by citation to pertinent authority or cogent argument).\n\n[\u00b627] Mr. Reynolds\u2019 next allegation of error relates to questions posed by the jury and the district court\u2019s response to them. The jury asked the following questions during deliberation:\n\n# 5 While under the influence of alcohol \u00e0 what indicates this? Blood level # or any alcohol?\n\nWho was the second call from? Was it reporting erratic driving[?]\n\nWhat about priors DUI???\n\nThe district court, with the consent of the attorneys, provided the following response: \u201cThe court cannot answer these questions. You must decide based upon the evidence presented in court.\u201d Mr. Reynolds suggests he needs the testimony of Ms. Langston and/or the opening statements to analyze whether the district court\u2019s answer was appropriate.\n\n[\u00b628] Mr. Reynolds falls short on the first factor of the Bergerco analysis because he does not identify a specific error or provide any analysis of how the judge\u2019s response was improper. Mr. Reynolds also fails to explain how the missing parts of the transcript, specifically opening statements and Ms. Langston\u2019s testimony, could possibly relate to the jury questions and, thus, does not establish that our review would be materially affected by the missing information. Finally, as we mentioned before, the reconstruction of Ms. Langston\u2019s testimony was quite detailed and Mr. Reynolds has failed to show that it was insufficient or that further efforts under Rules 3.03 or 3.04 would not have resulted in the information he says is missing.\n\n[\u00b629] Mr. Reynolds\u2019 next claim relates to the jury question about his prior DUI convictions. He maintains the jury\u2019s question suggests the district court may have read the criminal information (with the reference to his prior DUI convictions) to the jury. According to Mr. Reynolds, the possibility that the information was read to the jury raises two issues\u2014whether the district court erred by doing so and whether defense counsel was ineffective for failing to object to any such reading. This issue could have been simply resolved by using Rules 3.03 or 3.04 to determine whether the information was read to the jury or not. The details provided by the district court regarding voir dire and by the State concerning other aspects of the missing record indicate there is a good possibility that someone would have recalled whether the information was read to the jury or not. By failing to address this issue through the reconstruction process in the appellate rules, Mr. Reynolds failed the third element of the Bergerco test.\n\n[\u00b630] In his final substantive issue, Mr. Reynolds claims the prosecutor may have committed misconduct during her final argument by stating that Ms. Langston\u2019s REDDI report related directly to \u201cthis defendant,\u201d when Ms. Langston did not identify Mr. Reynolds. He claims that, without more detail about Ms. Langston\u2019s testimony, it is impossible to know whether it was a reasonable inference for the prosecutor to link Ms. Langston\u2019s call to him. We conclude that the settled part of the record very clearly demonstrates the inference was appropriate and any \u201cmissing\u201d part of her testimony does not materially affect our review of this issue. See Bergerco, 896 F.2d at 1217; Lucero, 14 P.3d at 922 (\u201cThis case is distinguishable from Bearpaw because the lack of the missing transcript does not frustrate our review of Lucero\u2019s claim of error . . . .\u201d).\n\n[\u00b631] The statement of the evidence included the following relevant information about Ms. Langston\u2019s testimony:\n\nMs. Langston testified that she was familiar with a REDDI report. Ms. Langston stated she called in a REDDI report to the Campbell County Sheriff\u2019s 911 Dispatch on October 24, 2010. Ms. Langston stated that she remembered the call very well. Ms. Langston testified that the subject of the REDDI report was a single cab vehicle which she identified as a green Ford Ranger. . . . Ms. Langston testified that she traveled east from her residence to Hwy 59. When she reached Hwy 59, she was unable to pull onto the highway because there was an on-coming vehicle traveling north that she had to wait to pass. Once the vehicle passed, Ms. Langston was able to safely pull her vehicle onto Hwy 59 and travel [n]orth to Wright, Wyoming. Ms. Langston stated that she quickly caught up to the vehicle that she had just had to wait for prior to pulling onto the highway. Ms. Langston testified the vehicle, which she identified as a green single cab Ford Ranger, was traveling at varying speeds and was having great difficulty maintaining its lane of travel. When asked, Ms. Langston stated the green Ford Ranger was drifting all the way into the southbound lane, bumping the fog line on the southbound lane of travel, then drifting back into the northbound lane and bumping the fog line. . . . Ms. Langston stated she had her daughter and her daughter\u2019s friend with her in her vehicle and was afraid so decided to call 911 to report the green Ford Ranger as a REDDI report. Ms. Langston stated she followed the green Ford Ranger the rest of the way to Wright, Wyoming where she observed it pull off into the parking lot of Hank\u2019s Bar and Lounge. Ms. Langston testified she remained on the phone with the 911 dispatcher while she was following the green Ford Ranger. Ms. Langston stated since she had two children with her in her vehicle she was afraid to follow the green Ford Ranger into the parking lot, so she pulled into the gas station across the street and continued to watch the green Ford Ranger and updated the 911 dispatcher. Ms. Langston testified that there was only one occupant in the green Ford Ranger while she was following behind it on Hwy 59.\n\nAt approximately 1152 hours on February 28, 2011, the Defendant\u2019s attorney began his cross examination of Ms. Langston. During cross, Ms. Langston testified she could see the cab of the green Ford Ranger when it was parked at Hank\u2019s Bar and Lounge. Ms. Langston stated she watched the green Ford Ranger the entire time she was on the phone with 911 until she was informed a Deputy was on his way. Ms. Langston stated she was afraid to get too close to the green Ford Ranger to get a license plate number when it was driving on Hwy 59 due to the erratic driving. Ms. Langston was questioned if she was sure the vehicle was a Ford Ranger. She stated she was sure as she used to drive an identical Ford Ranger as the one she was following and observing.\n\nAt approximately 1154 hours on February 28, 2011, the State conducted re-direct of Ms. Langston. Ms. Langston stated that while she was watching the green Ford pickup, nobody got in or out of the pickup and that the driver remained in the same position.\n\n[\u00b632] Deputy Raymond testified that he responded to Ms. Langston\u2019s REDDI report by going to Hank\u2019s Bar, but could not locate the vehicle. In response to a second REDDI report, he went to milepost 79; it took him approximately three minutes to get there. Deputy Raymond found \u201cthe little green Ford Ranger pickup\u201d off the side of the road. He called in the license plate number and learned the vehicle belonged to Mr. Reynolds. When he approached the vehicle, it was running and there was one person inside. The driver was talking on his cell phone and, when he realized the deputy was standing by the vehicle, he ended his call, turned off the vehicle, removed the key from the ignition, and threw it on the passenger side floorboard. The driver identified himself as John Reynolds.\n\n[\u00b633] A prosecutor\u2019s closing argument must be based upon the evidence produced at trial. However, the prosecutor is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the trial evidence. Adams v. State, 2005 WY 94, \u00b6 18, 117 P.3d 1210, 1217 (Wyo. 2005); Condra v. State, 2004 WY 131, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 100 P.3d 386, 392 (Wyo. 2004). Ms. Langston\u2019s testimony, as reflected in the statement of the evidence approved by the district court, together with Deputy Raymond\u2019s testimony, clearly establish the prosecutor\u2019s statement that Ms. Langston\u2019s REDDI report referred to \u201cthis defendant\u201d was a reasonable inference from the evidence produced at trial. The record was sufficient, and Mr. Reynolds has failed to demonstrate that a deficiency in the record materially affects our ability to address the issue. Under these circumstances, Mr. Reynolds is not entitled to a new trial.\n\n[\u00b634] Affirmed.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n1Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 31-6-101, et. seq.\n\n2Rule 10(c) states:\n\n(c) Statement of the Evidence When the Proceedings Were Not Recorded or When a Transcript Is Unavailable. If the transcript of a hearing or trial is unavailable, the appellant may prepare a statement of the evidence or proceedings from the best available means, including the appellant's recollection. The statement must be served on the appellee, who may serve objections or proposed amendments within 14 days after being served. The statement and any objections or proposed amendments must then be submitted to the district court for settlement and approval. As settled and approved, the statement must be included by the district clerk in the record on appeal."}, {"url": "https://history.rcplondon.ac.uk/inspiring-physicians/russell-john-reynolds", "page_content": "Russell John Reynolds was the son of Dr John Reynolds, a general practitioner in Streatham, who with Sir William Crookes constructed the X-ray apparatus now in the Science Museum, South Kensington. His mother was Caroline Harriets, daughter of Dr Trott. From Westminster School he went to Guy\u2019s Hospital and after two years in practice with his father set up as a full time radiologist in 1920. In World War I he served with the R.A.M.C, in home hospitals until 1917 when he became electrical specialist to the Karachi Brigade in India, returning home in 1919. In 1921 he was appointed physician-in-charge of the X-ray departments of Charing Cross and the National Hospitals; his son, Seymour, succeeded him at Charing Cross in 1946, and he retired from the National Hospital in 1939.\n\nFor many years he was adviser in radiology to the Ministry of Pensions and Supply and an examiner to Cambridge University, the Conjoint Board, the Faculty of Radiologists and the R.A.M.C. On his retirement in 1946 he acted as honorary consulting radiologist to the Charing Cross, National, Samaritan, Bethlem Royal and Lambeth Hospitals, and to the Caernarvon and Anglesey Infirmary.\n\nFrom 1924 he had experimented with methods of cineradiography, pioneering in photofluorography with a very wide aperture camera lens. His success brought worldwide recognition. He was president of the British Institute of Radiology and of the section of radiology of the Royal Society of Medicine, warden of the Fellowship of the Faculty of Radiologists, Hunterian professor of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1936, and was awarded the Antoine Beclere award in Paris in 1957.\n\nIn addition he was made a member of the Canadian Radiological Society, the American Roentgen Ray Society, the New York Roentgen Society, the Association of Physicians of Vienna and the Society of Radiologists of Italy; the Australian College of Radiology elected him a fellow.\n\nHe was the author of many publications, particularly in his specialised field of cineradiography which culminated in the production of the Russell Reynolds cineradiographic unit. His paper on the early history of radiology in Britain was published in Clinical Radiology (1961, 12, 136-42).\n\nReynolds was quiet, unassuming and kindly; his strong personality was shown only in his teaching, which brought him the enthusiasm of students and the deep respect of his colleagues. In 1908 he married Anna Thekla Henriette, daughter of Adolf Romer, a banker. They had two sons, Seymour and Stewart, both of whom became consultant radiologists.\n\nRichard R Trail\n\n[Brit.med.J., 1964, 2, 1271 (p), 1403; Charing Cr. Hosp.

He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851 he graduated M.B. in the university of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852 he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a fellow of the college in 1859. In the same year he was appointed assistant physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, assistant physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 assistant physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865 he became professor of the principles and practice of medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed physician-in-ordinary to the queen's household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 vice-president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian oration in 1884, and was elected president in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a baronet. In the winter of 1895\u20136 he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as president of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, to Miss Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children.\n\nThe Reynolds Baronetcy, of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds. The title became extinct on his death.\n\nReynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an Essay on Vertigo; in 1855 Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves, as well as Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity; in 1872 The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the System of Medicine, in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write\u2014compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe. Reynolds was a tall man, with dark hair, with a dignified delivery and some oratorical power.\n\nReynolds died in London."}, {"url": "https://iclg.com/firms/white-and-case/john-reynolds", "page_content": "We find these publications very useful, which we use as a quick reference guide.

The firm knew this when they recruited me and were very supportive. At short notice before the last election, my local MP decided to stand down and several people approached me and asked me to put my name forward as a possible candidate to replace him. I went on unpaid leave, won the selection contest, and was almost immediately thrust into a General Election campaign. It was difficult to come in at such short notice, but despite a bad night nationally for the Labour Party I was able to hold the seat.\n\nIt was difficult to leave my colleagues behind, but to represent the area you live in Parliament is an incredible honour. My background in law was extremely useful - law is often about taking complex issues and being able to present and explain them to clients in a way that is of use to them. Replace 'clients' with 'constituents' and politics isn't too different. There are also lots of skills in terms of negotiating, advocacy and drafting an argument which are complementary. It's probably why there are a lot of lawyers in the House of Commons.\n\nOne other thing that was essential was the work ethic I had got accustomed to in private practice. Solicitors work long hours, and are used to constant peer-evaluation and accountability for the outcomes they achieve. I think being trained to work in such a way sometimes gives me an edge in terms of being an MP."}, {"url": "https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/HighSchoolAffiliatedtoFudanUniversity_943/list.htm", "page_content": "SCHOOL PROFILE Facts at a Glance NAME: High School Affiliated to Fudan University (FDFZ) FOUNDING YEAR: 1950 TOTAL ENROLLMENT: 1115 FACULTY:\u00b7180 faculty members \u00b7123 with Master Degrees, 52 with senior professional titles, 46 with junior professional titles CAMPUS:\u00b713.5 acres including one teaching campus and one residential campus \u00b79 campus buildings WEBSITE: http://www.fdfz.cn CONTACT INFO:\u00b7383 Guoquan Road, Yangpu District, Shanghai, China, 200433 \u00b7Tel: +86-21-65643307 \u00b7Fax: +86-21-65641849\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurriculum\n\n4 CATEGORIES:\n\n\u00b7Compulsory foundation courses\n\n\n\n\u00b7Elective courses covering 8 academic fields\n\n\u00b7Optional research programs\n\n\u00b7Optional interdisciplinary programs\n\n\n\n\n\n8 ACADEMIC FIELDS:\n\n\u00b7Humanities & Classics (Literature, History, Philosophy, Psychology, etc.)\n\n\u00b7Culture & Language (Linguistics, Foreign Language, Geography, Folklore)\n\n\u00b7Society & Development (Political science, Sociology, Economics)\n\n\u00b7Mathematics & Logic (Mathematics, Logic, Information Science)\n\n\u00b7Science & Labs (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Physiology)\n\n\u00b7Technology & Design (Engineering, Computer Programming, Art)\n\n\u00b7Health & Athletics (Health Education, Sports)\n\n\n\n\n\nFDFZ also provides students with rich resources such as advanced teaching facilities, laboratories, and a massive library.

FDFZ adheres to the motto \u201cRich in knowledge and tenacious of purpose; Inquiring with earnestness and reflecting in depth\u201d of Fudan University. It requires her students to build a complete system of knowledge through different types of courses, encourages them to explore their own interests through arts, sports, and community activities, and assists them to understand China and the world through social practice and overseas exchange programs. As one of China's top high schools, FDFZ admits more than 360 students from the most competitive students in Shanghai each year. In three school years, every student takes fifteen compulsory foundation courses and six elective courses at minimum. The majority of the student body are active in various student associations. Meanwhile, about 50% of the student body participate in social practice across Mainland China and overseas exchange programs. All FDFZ graduates enter colleges for further study, among whom 45% receive Early Admission offers from top universities in China; 20% are accepted by leading universities overseas; another 35% of the students enter universities through the National College Entrance Exam (Gaokao).\n\n\n\nTo maintain high academic standard, FDFZ uses a rigorous performance-based grading system, in which the percent of \u201cA\u201d in each course does not exceed 30%.\n\nFDFZ signed a student exchange agreement with Sidwell Friends School in the United States in 1984 and began to cooperate with ASSIST (American Secondary Schools for International Students and Teachers) in 1986, which marked the beginning of China\u2019s high school international exchange programs. By now, FDFZ has established exchange programs with 27 schools in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, with more than 180 students and over 50 teachers participating on an annual basis. At the same time, FDFZ receives visitors from more than 500 high schools all over the world each year. With a global perspective and a good international reputation, FDFZ has cofounded many education associations, such as WLSA (World Leading Schools Association) and SAGE (Strategic Alliance of Global Educators).\n\n\n\nFDFZ has founded two Fudan International Schools (FDIS) and has been enrolling international students since 2002. FDIS is currently a member of Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), a member of College Board and a registered International Baccalaureate (IB) World School. In 2014, FDFZ started to offer IB courses for Chinese local students and enrolled students of Grade 10 as the first IBDP class. With municipal support, FDFZ established two other campuses in Pudong and Qingpu districts of Shanghai, both ranking as key high schools.

His father gave him the greater part of his general education and University College, London, his medical training. He graduated in 1851 as University scholar and gold medallist in physiology, comparative anatomy and medicine. For so outstanding a student, a great future seemed assured. But his means were slender and he decided to begin practice in Leeds where he had relatives. However, his old teacher Marshall Hall persuaded him to return to London, offering him his house in Grosvenor Street on favourable terms. His enterprise was rewarded by appointments as assistant physician to the Hospital for Sick Children in 1855, the Westminster Hospital in 1857 and University College Hospital in 1859.

He followed and developed Hughlings Jackson\u2019s original ideas about positive and negative neurological symptoms. His approach to patients was holistic at a time when more objectively defined notions of illness dominated medicine. He wrote on vertigo, and about criminal lunacy, and his book The Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, Nerves and their appendages was a major text of the period.\n\nWell versed in poetry, philosophy, art, and music, he was widely admired. He became President of the Royal College of Physicians.\n\nLike the great Sir Jonathan Hutchinson and other Victorians of privileged stock, Sir John Russell Reynolds (1828\u20131896) (Figure 1) never attended school. His father, a nonconformist minister at Romsey in Hampshire, educated him personally. His grandfather Henry Revell Reynolds (1745-1811), FRS, was an illustrious physician at the Middlesex and St Thomas\u2019s Hospitals and Physician to George III.\n\nFigure 1: Sir J Russell Reynolds. [Published in British Medical Journal, 6 June 1896)\n\nAs a nonconformist he was excluded from Oxford and Cambridge* and read Medicine at University College London, graduating with a gold medal in physiology, comparative anatomy, and medicine in 1851 [1]. An impecunious young doctor, he sought a living, practicing in Leeds where his brother was a Minister of the East Parade Mission Chapel, and his brother-in-law a journalist on the Leeds Mercury.\n\nA year later his former teacher Marshall Hall, FRS. (1790-1857), a physician and brilliant experimental physiologist persuaded him to return to London [2], where at modest cost Hall let him live in his home at 38, Grosvenor Street and join his Consultant practice, mainly in nervous diseases.\n\nOnly four years after graduating Russell Reynolds\u2019 outstanding ability led to his appointment as assistant physician at the Hospital for Sick Children and to the Westminster and University College Hospitals. There he became Holme Professor of Clinical Medicine in 1862, and in 1867 succeeding Sir William Jenner as Professor of Medicine. Just five years after the opening of the National Hospital for the Relief and Cure of Paralysis and Epilepsy, Russell Reynolds showed his interest in neurology and was appointed to its staff. He was elected FRS on 3rd June 1869.\n\nAt this time neurology began to flourish; he worked with many distinguished early neurologists. They included Hughlings Jackson (1835-1911), Jabez Ramskill (1825-1897), Charles Bland Radcliffe (1822\u20131889) who succeeded Brown\u2013S\u00e9quard in 1863, and published Lectures on Epilepsy, Pain, Paralysis, and certain other disorders of the Nervous System, 1864, and articles in Reynolds\u2019s System of Medicine. His brother John Netten Radcliffe (c. 1830-1884), a pioneering epidemiologist, was also Medical Superintendent of the Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic.\n\nNo man works in a vacuum. Marshall Hall, (who in spite of his acknowledged distinction [3] surprisingly had failed to get an academic post in London) inspired and encouraged Reynolds. Amongst contemporary and subsequent notable physicians he influenced were: the erudite Charlton Bastian (1837-1915); Charles Edward Beevor, (1854-1908); Howard Tooth (1856-1925); James Taylor, (1859-1946) editor of Jackson\u2019s Selected Writings; and the punctilious Thomas Buzzard (1831-1919), his neighbour in Grosvenor Street, and friend of both Hughlings Jackson and David Ferrier (1843-1928).\n\nSuch was Reynolds\u2019s reputation that he was rewarded with both the Lumleian and the Harveian lectures at the Royal College of Physicians of London, becoming President from 1893\u20131895. Like his grandfather, he was physician to the royal household in 1879 and was made a baronet in 1895. He was president of the BMA until his death.\n\nA popular and fluent lecturer, he was shy and serious but had a quiet humour and a \u2018directness of speech that was no respecter of persons.\u2019 Described as courteous, shrewd, and kind, his approach was holistic \u2013 long before it became fashionable:\n\nNot to merely make a diagnosis, much less to write a prescription, but to advise the individual patient what he or she should best do to regain their health\u2026 and what changes in the environment, mental, emotional, or physical were most likely to achieve this end. [2]\n\nMedical works\n\nRussell Reynolds is often remembered for his descriptions of epilepsy, eclamptic convulsions, and febrile convulsions in children [4,5]. He also used electrotherapy in various nervous diseases [6].\n\nInterestingly, he is widely quoted for commending the \u201cgreat value of Cannabis indica\u201d in migraine, epileptic conditions, depression, and asthma. In 1890 he prescribed a cannabis tincture for the menstrual cramps suffered by Queen Victoria. He noted in The Lancet:\n\nWhen pure and administered carefully, [cannabis] is one of the most valuable medicines we possess. [7]\n\nOf greater import was his 1861 paper (Figure 2) that espoused the concept of positive and negative neurological symptoms [5,8]. Positive symptoms were abnormal behaviours that included not only clonic jerking and abnormal movements but also hallucinations and paranoid delusions.\n\nSome symptoms are negative, i.e. they consist in the negation of vital properties. Of this kind are paralysis, anaesthesia, and the like\u2026Other symptoms are positive, i.e. they consist in excess or alteration of vital properties. Of this kind are spasms, pain, convulsions and the like\u2026 (p.9-12, 28)\n\nUnfortunately, he failed to write further on this theme. Like Jackson, Russell Reynolds shrewdly noted that the lesion did not directly cause the symptoms observed.\n\nThe origins of positive and negative symptoms were inextricably intertwined with Herbert Spencer\u2019s ideas of dissolution and evolution of the nervous system [9]. Hughlings Jackson extended Spencer\u2019s idea to patients\u2019 symptoms, both positive and negative. Jackson believed that negative symptoms related to the dissolution of neural function while positive symptoms resulted from excitation or the release of lower levels from higher inhibitory control:\n\nSpeaking of the physical side, there are degrees of loss of function of the least organized nervous arrangements with conservation of function of the more organized. There is in each reduction to a more automatic condition; in each there is dissolution, using this term as Spencer does, as the opposite of evolution. [10]\n\nFigure 2. Reynolds: Epilepsy, its symptoms, treatment and relation to other chronic convulsive diseases. 1861\n\nRussell Reynolds wrote his first book on Vertigo. In 1856 he examined legal pleas for insanity in his Criminal Lunatics: are they Responsible? He believed that epilepsy could be a distinct or \u2018idiopathic\u2019 disease, a controversial view well expressed in The Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, Nerves and their appendages in 1855 (dedicated to Marshall Hall), This was later contradicted by Kinnier Wilson who stated that all epileptic events were symptoms, whether or not any underlying pathology could be demonstrated [11].\n\nAlways inclined to a broad approach he described the interictal symptoms of 62 patients with idiopathic epilepsy. He found about one-third had mild impairment of recent memory and a similar proportion had moderate to severe psychopathological findings. His interpretation of epileptic activity (well described by Eadie) [12] was in large measure approved by Hughlings Jackson.\n\nHe edited and wrote many chapters in A system of medicine (London: Macmillan, in five volumes from 1866 to 1879), a major text rivalled only by John Cooke\u2019s Treatise in Nervous Diseases, published in two volumes, in 1820 and 1823, the second volume of Bright\u2019s Reports of Medical Cases 1831, and Romberg\u2019s Manual of the Nervous Diseases of Man 1840 [13].\n\nRussell Reynolds practiced at a time when neurology was in its infancy. It relied on clinical description and elementary pathology. In this morass of evolving knowledge, Reynolds formulated a classification of neurological diseases that remains the kernel of modern systems. His work in neurology linked the highly original physiological and clinical works of his mentor, Marshall Hall, to Hughlings Jackson\u2019s intellectual explorations of the brain\u2019s complex functions and hierarchies, and to the more systematic descriptive neurology of William Gowers [12]. His students included Charlton Bastian (1837-1915) and Sir William Gowers (1845-1915), whose writings often reflect his influence.\n\nLegacy\n\nHe was well versed in poetry, philosophy, art, and music. He was married, first, to Margaret Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances Crespigny, but left no children. He died aged 68 of \u2018pulmonary congestion\u2019 at his home in 1896.\n\nThe scholarship and clinical advances made by Reynolds can be seen as important influences on contemporary and also later notable neurologists at the National Hospital. He bridged the eras of Victorian Neurology with that of the dawning 20th century.\n\nHe was noted as:\n\nA man of scholarship and wisdom, in his presidential address in 1894, in a spirit of prophecy he warned the subject-ridden student of to day of the danger of becoming entangled in the net of an ill-considered and misunderstood technical phraseology, and of juggling with words when he ought to be dealing with concrete things. [2]\n\nAnd Eadie characterised him as:\n\nA most eminent, scholarly, and influential physician who was greatly respected and admired by his contemporaries\u2026the sort of man whose ideas would not readily be discarded because it might almost seem disrespectful to do so unless a better alternative could be clearly demonstrated to exist. [12]\n\n* So-called dissenters (Catholics, Jews, and Quakers) were denied admission because their religious beliefs prevented their taking an oath to adhere to the 39 articles of the Anglican Church. This was abolished by the Universities Tests Act in 1871.\n\nWomen had studied at Oxford since the 1870s. But until 1921, they were not entitled to claim the degrees they had earned. Cambridge followed in 1947.\n\nReferences\n\nBrown GH. Munk\u2019s Roll. Lives of the Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians of London (1826-1925).

He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851 he graduated M.B. in the university of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852 he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a fellow of the college in 1859. In the same year he was appointed assistant physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, assistant physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 assistant physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865 he became professor of the principles and practice of medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed physician-in-ordinary to the queen's household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 vice-president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian oration in 1884, and was elected president in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a baronet. In the winter of 1895\u20136 he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as president of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, to Miss Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children.\n\nThe Reynolds Baronetcy, of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds. The title became extinct on his death.\n\nReynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an Essay on Vertigo; in 1855 Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves, as well as Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity; in 1872 The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the System of Medicine, in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write\u2014compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe. Reynolds was a tall man, with dark hair, with a dignified delivery and some oratorical power.\n\nReynolds died in London."}, {"url": "https://law.justia.com/cases/wyoming/supreme-court/2012/s-11-0263.html", "page_content": "JOHN RUSSELL REYNOLDS v.

He asserts he is entitled to a new trial because a computer malfunction resulted in part of the transcript of his jury trial being unavailable for appeal. We conclude that the record was properly settled pursuant to W.R.A.P. 3.03 and 3.04, and Mr. Reynolds has failed to demonstrate the settled record is insufficient or the settlement process could not have been used to collect the information he claims is still missing.\n\n[\u00b62] We affirm.\n\nISSUE\n\n[\u00b63] Mr. Reynolds presents the following issue on appeal:\n\nIs the record too incomplete to provide appellant a meaningful appeal?\n\nThe State provides a more detailed statement of the issue:\n\nAfter Reynolds filed his notice of appeal, the court reporter discovered that a computer malfunction had destroyed her electronic notes covering jury selection, opening statements, and the first trial witness. The court and parties settled the record by reconstructing the missing portions as prescribed by Wyo. R. App. P. 3.03 and 3.04. In his brief, Reynolds identifies four substantive issues that he contends are outside the purview of meaningful appellate review because of the state of the record. Would the settled record allow a meaningful review of Reynolds\u2019 conviction on each of these issues if he had chosen to present their merits to this Court with cogent argument and supporting authority?\n\nFACTS\n\n[\u00b64] At 4:24 p.m. on October 24, 2010, the Campbell County Sheriff\u2019s Department received a REDDI (Report Every Drunk Driver Immediately) report from Arrow Langston. She reported a green Ford Ranger pickup was traveling at varying speeds and weaving across the road on Highway 59 near Wright, Wyoming. Ms. Langston did not feel comfortable getting close enough to the vehicle to read the license plate, but she continued to follow it and reported to the 911 operator that the vehicle had parked at Hank\u2019s Bar and Lounge.\n\n[\u00b65] Deputy Mark Raymond was dispatched to Hank\u2019s Bar and Lounge but could not locate the vehicle. A few minutes later an anonymous caller made a second REDDI report. Responding to that call, the deputy located a green Ford Ranger pickup parked off the road at milepost 79 on Highway 59 and Mr. Reynolds sitting in the driver\u2019s seat talking on his cell phone. The truck was running, but when the deputy approached, Mr. Reynolds turned it off, removed the key and threw it onto the passenger side floor board.\n\n[\u00b66] The deputy smelled alcohol on Mr. Reynolds\u2019 breath and there was a twelve pack container of beer on the passenger seat and a spilled beer on the floor. Mr. Reynolds told the deputy that he had consumed only one beer, but he refused to perform field sobriety maneuvers or take a portable breath test. Deputy Raymond arrested him for driving while under the influence of alcohol.\n\n[\u00b67] At the jail, Mr. Reynolds refused to take a breath test in accordance with the Wyoming implied consent law1 but later he requested and was given a portable breath test, which showed the presence of alcohol in his system. Mr. Reynolds was charged with driving while under the influence and, because it was his fourth offense in ten years, the charge was a felony under Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 31-5-233(b)(iii)(A) and (e) (LexisNexis 2010). He pleaded not guilty and the matter was tried to a jury. The jury returned a guilty verdict, and the district court sentenced Mr. Reynolds to twenty to twenty-four months incarceration.\n\n[\u00b68] Mr. Reynolds filed a notice of appeal and requested the trial transcript be prepared for appeal. The court reporter stated that she had experienced computer problems and the record of the morning session of the trial was lost and could not be transcribed. The missing session included voir dire, opening statements and the testimony of the first witness, Ms. Langston.\n\n[\u00b69] Mr. Reynolds\u2019 trial counsel filed a \u201cSupplemental to Transcript,\u201d in which he stated that he could not reconstruct the voir dire and asked that the following information about Ms. Langston\u2019s testimony be used to \u201ccomplete\u201d the transcript:\n\nThe First witness was Arrow Langston who observed a green pickup truck being [driven] erratically on Highway 59 until it pulled off and parked at Hanks Bar. She did not get close enough to see the license plate and could not identify the driver. She did call in a Reddi report.\n\nThe State responded with objections and proposed amendments pursuant to W.R.A.P. 3.03 and 3.04. The State\u2019s response was compiled from notes taken by the State\u2019s paralegal during the trial, the recollection of the district judge\u2019s law clerk who attended the entire trial and the prosecutor\u2019s recollection and notes. It included summaries of the parties\u2019 opening statements and a detailed rendition of Ms. Langston\u2019s direct, cross examination and redirect testimony.\n\n[\u00b610] Mr. Reynolds\u2019 appellate counsel filed a motion to correct or modify the record on appeal pursuant to W.R.A.P. 3.04 asking that the record be supplemented with the parties\u2019 earlier submissions and an additional proposed supplement. The motion stated that appellate counsel had attempted to \u201cobtain recollection of the trial from State\u2019s counsel, defense counsel, and Mr. Reynolds.\u201d The filings did not include any new substantive information regarding the trial proceedings or any objections to the State\u2019s earlier submission, although the proposed supplement did state: \u201cConsultation with Mr. Reynolds reveals that Mr. Reynolds, after this lapse of time, cannot reconstruct the cross-examination of the first witness, but Mr. Reynolds recalls the cross-examination as being extremely important to his defense.\u201d\n\n[\u00b611] After considering the various filings, the district court entered an Order Settling and Approving Statement of Evidence. It confirmed the accuracy of the defense trial counsel\u2019s submission and the State\u2019s response and provided its own detailed recollection of the voir dire.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n[\u00b612] Because the issue in this case requires our independent determination of the sufficiency of the record on appeal, our standard of review is de novo. See generally, Eaton v. State, 2008 WY 97, \u00b6\u00b6 101-102, 192 P.3d 36, 78 (Wyo. 2008); Bearpaw v. State, 803 P.2d 70, 78-79 (Wyo. 1990).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n[\u00b613] The court reporter is charged with producing the official transcript of criminal proceedings, including the trial, and filing the transcript as part of the official court record. See Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 5-3-403 through 5-3-406 (LexisNexis 2011); Bromley v. State, 2009 WY 133, \u00b6 17, 219 P.3d 110, 115 (Wyo. 2009). A criminal defendant is entitled to have his entire trial recorded and available for appeal. In Bearpaw, 803 P.2d at 78-79, we examined an early Wyoming decision which discussed a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a complete record for appeal, Richardson v. State, 15 Wyo. 465, 484, 89 P. 1027, 1034-35 (1907):\n\nIn its early years, this court determined \u201c[t]here is no more reason for permitting a party to be deprived of his legal rights through a failure or a refusal of the official stenographer to perform his duties than through the failure or refusal of the judge or any other officer of the court to perform a duty imposed by law.\u201d [Richardson, 89 P.] at 1030. The court recognized an absolute right of appeal in a criminal case and the corollary right to be provided a complete record. Otherwise, the court noted, the defendant is effectively deprived of the right of appeal. Richardson held that a new trial is required when a necessary record is absent.\n\nWe also discussed several cases from other jurisdictions with favor:\n\n[T]he rule that a mandatory requirement for the court reporter to record all proceedings in a criminal case establishes a principle which cannot be overridden by any local practice, United States v. Brumley, 560 F.2d 1268 (5th Cir.1977). That court, in quoting United States v. Selva, 559 F.2d 1303, 1306 (5th Cir.1977), emphasized that \u201c'[w]hen . . . a criminal defendant is represented on appeal by counsel other than the attorney at trial, the absence of a substantial and significant portion . . . of the record\u2019 will result in a presumption of prejudice sufficient to mandate reversal * * *.\u201d Brumley, 560 F.2d at 1281.\n\nBearpaw, 803 P.2d at 79.\n\n[\u00b614] Wyoming court rules, however, provide an alternative means of producing a record on appeal when a transcript is not available. See generally Barela v. State, 936 P.2d 66, 69 (Wyo. 1997). Under W.R.A.P. 3.03 and 3.04, the district court may settle the record when a transcript is unavailable or does not accurately reflect the court proceedings. W.R.A.P. 3.03 states:\n\nIf no report of the evidence or proceedings at a hearing or trial was made, or if a transcript is unavailable, appellant may prepare a statement of the evidence or proceedings from the best available means including appellant\u2019s recollection. The statement shall be filed and served on appellee within 35 days of the filing of the notice of appeal. Appellee may file and serve objections or propose amendments within 15 days after service. The trial court shall, within 10 days, enter its order settling and approving the statement of evidence, which shall be included by the clerk of the trial court in the record on appeal.\n\nW.R.A.P. 3.04 states:\n\nIf any difference arises as to whether the record discloses what occurred in the trial court, the difference shall be submitted to and settled by that court and the record made to conform to the truth. If anything material to either party is omitted from the record by error or accident or is misstated, the parties by stipulation, or the trial court either before or after the record is transmitted to the appellate court, or the appellate court on motion or its own initiative, may direct that the omission or misstatement be corrected, and if necessary that a supplemental record be certified and transmitted. All other questions as to the form and content of the record shall be presented to the appellate court by motion.\n\n[\u00b615] Unlike in Bearpaw, the parties in the case at bar used the procedures available under Rules 3.03 and 3.04, and the district court settled the record. Mr. Reynolds did not object to the settlement of the record or provide any additional information. The importance of the Rule 3.03 and 3.04 process is shown in other cases where we have rejected criminal defendants\u2019 claims that the record was inadequate when no effort was made to settle it. See, e.g., Eaton, \u00b6\u00b6 101-02, 192 P.3d at 78; Petersen v. State, 594 P.2d 978, 979-80 (Wyo. 1979) (applying former rule).\n\n[\u00b616] Because Fed. R. App. P. 10(c)2 is very similar to our Rule 3.03, we look to federal precedent for guidance as to the adequacy of the record on appeal. See, e.g., DeLoge v. State, 2010 WY 60, \u00b6 17, 231 P.3d 862, 865 (Wyo. 2010); Bromley, \u00b6 18, 219 P.3d at 115. Federal decisions emphasize the importance of the record settlement process and have noted the difficulty of challenging a district court\u2019s reconstruction of missing portions of transcripts. 16A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Juris. \u00a7 3956.3 (4th ed. 2012). \u201cIn rare cases, however, a party may persuade the court of appeals that the effort to reconstruct the record does not afford a sufficient foundation for effective review and that the case must be retried.\u201d Id. The Ninth Circuit conducted a comprehensive review of criminal and civil cases addressing the sufficiency of a reconstructed record and adopted the following analysis:\n\n[A]n appellant seeking a new trial because of a missing or incomplete transcript must 1) make a specific allegation of error; 2) show that the defect in the record materially affects the ability of the appeals court to review the alleged error; and 3) show that a Rule 10(c) [here, Rule 3.03] proceeding has failed or would fail to produce an adequate substitute for the evidence.\n\nBergerco, U.S.A. v. Shipping Corp. of India, Ltd., 896 F.2d 1210, 1217 (9th Cir. 1990).\n\n[\u00b617] The Bergerco test fulfills a number of purposes. It helps us identify when a substantial and significant portion of the record is absent, thereby adversely impacting the appellant\u2019s right of appeal. Bearpaw, 803 P.2d at 79. It also recognizes that a defect in the record will not result in reversal if the existing record is sufficient to review an alleged error. See Lucero v. State, 14 P.3d 920, 922 (Wyo. 2000) (refusing to grant the appellant a new trial even though the record did not include a transcript of the jury instruction conference because we were able to review the allegation of error from the existing record). Additionally, the test recognizes an appellant\u2019s responsibility to attempt to reconstruct the record using the rules of appellate procedure. See United States v. Williams, 2009 WL 4506411, p. 3-4 (D.Colo. 2009); United States v. Locust, 95 Fed. Appx. 507, 51213 (4th Cir. 2004) (recognizing appellants may not be entitled to a new trial if they do not attempt to reconstruct the record through the Fed. R. App. P. 10(c) process). In sum, the Bergerco test properly balances a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a record of his criminal proceedings with his obligation to participate in the process of creating an alternative record when the transcript is not available.\n\n[\u00b618] Mr. Reynolds identifies a number of issues which he asserts the settled record is insufficient to resolve. His first argument pertains to the district court\u2019s ruling that the recording of Ms. Langston\u2019s REDDI report could be played for the jury. The recording was played during the testimony of the 911 dispatcher who took Ms. Langston\u2019s REDDI call. Defense counsel objected to the recording because it was improper \u201cvouching,\u201d was not relevant and Ms. Langston had already testified. The district court overruled the objection, stating that \u201cit\u2019s either [a] prior consistent statement or prior inconsistent statement depending upon how it compares with the testimony.\u201d\n\n[\u00b619] On appeal, Mr. Reynolds does not identify the legal basis for his claim that the district court erroneously allowed the recording into evidence or provide any legal analysis to support his claim. As such, he has failed to make a specific allegation of error as required by the first factor of the Bergerco test. The second and third factors require Mr. Reynolds to demonstrate that the defect in the record materially affects our ability to review his claim and that the Rule 3.03 process failed to produce an adequate substitute for the transcript. Mr. Reynolds argues the statement of the evidence is insufficient to allow proper review of this issue because it does not describe Ms. Langston\u2019s testimony in sufficient detail to determine whether the trial court\u2019s ruling was correct.\n\n[\u00b620] As we described earlier, the defense provided a general statement of Ms. Langston\u2019s testimony and the State supplemented it with a more detailed statement. The State\u2019s submission included nearly two full pages describing Ms. Langston\u2019s direct, cross examination and redirect testimony. The district court confirmed the parties\u2019 submissions as accurate recollections of Ms. Langston\u2019s testimony, and Mr. Reynolds did not object to the statement as being incomplete or submit additional information relating to the supposedly missing parts of Ms. Langston\u2019s testimony. He also does not specify on appeal what specific information would be necessary for him to properly present the issue. Under these circumstances, Mr. Reynolds cannot be heard to complain that the record is incomplete, if, indeed, it could be considered so.\n\n[\u00b621] In his second issue, Mr. Reynolds claims the record is insufficient to evaluate the effectiveness of his trial counsel. He provides two \u201cexamples\u201d of possible ineffectiveness. First, he asserts his trial counsel may have improperly opened the door to admission of the second REDDI report when he mentioned it in his opening statement and he needs the transcript of the opening statement in order to effectively evaluate whether his counsel was effective. He also claims that his counsel may have been ineffective by stipulating that he was driving the vehicle when Deputy Raymond encountered him.\n\n[\u00b622] Both of Mr. Reynolds\u2019 claims fail to satisfy the third Bergerco element because he does not establish that the Rule 3.03 proceeding, had it been properly used, would have failed to produce an adequate substitute for the transcript. He made no effort to reconstruct the portions of the transcript which would have shown these alleged errors, i.e., the opening statement and the part of the record where the stipulation was presented to the jury, and he does not explain why such an effort would have been unsuccessful.\n\n[\u00b623] In addition, with regard to his first claim of ineffectiveness, Mr. Reynolds fails to fulfill the other Bergerco elements because the available transcript clearly shows that defense counsel objected to the admission of the contents of the second REDDI report and the district court partially upheld his objection. The district court ruled that the State could present evidence of the second REDDI report to establish the reason the dispatcher sent the deputy to the location where he encountered Mr. Reynolds, but the report itself could not be played for the jury. On appeal, Mr. Reynolds does not provide any legal analysis showing that the limited admission of the evidence of the second REDDI report was erroneous. He has not demonstrated that, even if his attorney referred to the report in his opening statement, he somehow opened the door to improper evidence. Mr. Reynolds has, therefore, failed to make a specific allegation of error or show that the missing parts of the transcript materially affect our ability to review this issue.\n\n[\u00b624] Mr. Reynolds\u2019 second claim of ineffective assistance of counsel suffers from similar problems. He questions his trial counsel\u2019s decision to stipulate that he was \u201cdriving\u201d the vehicle when, in fact, he was parked when Deputy Raymond contacted him. He claims the lack of a record of whether the stipulation was presented to the jury, and if so how it was done, hampers his ability to prove his attorney was ineffective for entering into the stipulation.\n\n[\u00b625] The extant parts of the record demonstrate that Mr. Reynolds stipulated that he would not \u201craise a defense to the element that he was driving a motor vehicle at the time of the stop by Deputy Mark Raymond on October 24, 2010.\u201d Defense counsel entered into the stipulation to avoid the State\u2019s introduction of W.R.E. 404(b) evidence that Mr. Reynolds had already been convicted in circuit court of two other crimes resulting from the same incident\u2014driving while under suspension and driving with an open container. By entering into the stipulation, the defense was able to keep evidence of the other convictions from the jury.\n\n[\u00b626] The available record clearly shows what was stipulated and why. Mr. Reynolds has not demonstrated that the unavailability of the portion of the trial transcript where the stipulation was read to the jury (if it was) would materially impact our ability to review his claim that his counsel was ineffective for entering into the stipulation. Despite having the information from the record, Mr. Reynolds does not provide any legal analysis of his ineffectiveness claim; consequently, we decline to address it. See Fix v. South Wilderness Ranch Homeowners Ass\u2019n, 2012 WY 96, \u00b6 15, 280 P.3d 527, 531-32 (Wyo. 2012) (stating we do not consider issues not supported by citation to pertinent authority or cogent argument).\n\n[\u00b627] Mr. Reynolds\u2019 next allegation of error relates to questions posed by the jury and the district court\u2019s response to them. The jury asked the following questions during deliberation:\n\n# 5 While under the influence of alcohol \u00e0 what indicates this? Blood level # or any alcohol?\n\nWho was the second call from? Was it reporting erratic driving[?]\n\nWhat about priors DUI???\n\nThe district court, with the consent of the attorneys, provided the following response: \u201cThe court cannot answer these questions. You must decide based upon the evidence presented in court.\u201d Mr. Reynolds suggests he needs the testimony of Ms. Langston and/or the opening statements to analyze whether the district court\u2019s answer was appropriate.\n\n[\u00b628] Mr. Reynolds falls short on the first factor of the Bergerco analysis because he does not identify a specific error or provide any analysis of how the judge\u2019s response was improper. Mr. Reynolds also fails to explain how the missing parts of the transcript, specifically opening statements and Ms. Langston\u2019s testimony, could possibly relate to the jury questions and, thus, does not establish that our review would be materially affected by the missing information. Finally, as we mentioned before, the reconstruction of Ms. Langston\u2019s testimony was quite detailed and Mr. Reynolds has failed to show that it was insufficient or that further efforts under Rules 3.03 or 3.04 would not have resulted in the information he says is missing.\n\n[\u00b629] Mr. Reynolds\u2019 next claim relates to the jury question about his prior DUI convictions. He maintains the jury\u2019s question suggests the district court may have read the criminal information (with the reference to his prior DUI convictions) to the jury. According to Mr. Reynolds, the possibility that the information was read to the jury raises two issues\u2014whether the district court erred by doing so and whether defense counsel was ineffective for failing to object to any such reading. This issue could have been simply resolved by using Rules 3.03 or 3.04 to determine whether the information was read to the jury or not. The details provided by the district court regarding voir dire and by the State concerning other aspects of the missing record indicate there is a good possibility that someone would have recalled whether the information was read to the jury or not. By failing to address this issue through the reconstruction process in the appellate rules, Mr. Reynolds failed the third element of the Bergerco test.\n\n[\u00b630] In his final substantive issue, Mr. Reynolds claims the prosecutor may have committed misconduct during her final argument by stating that Ms. Langston\u2019s REDDI report related directly to \u201cthis defendant,\u201d when Ms. Langston did not identify Mr. Reynolds. He claims that, without more detail about Ms. Langston\u2019s testimony, it is impossible to know whether it was a reasonable inference for the prosecutor to link Ms. Langston\u2019s call to him. We conclude that the settled part of the record very clearly demonstrates the inference was appropriate and any \u201cmissing\u201d part of her testimony does not materially affect our review of this issue. See Bergerco, 896 F.2d at 1217; Lucero, 14 P.3d at 922 (\u201cThis case is distinguishable from Bearpaw because the lack of the missing transcript does not frustrate our review of Lucero\u2019s claim of error . . . .\u201d).\n\n[\u00b631] The statement of the evidence included the following relevant information about Ms. Langston\u2019s testimony:\n\nMs. Langston testified that she was familiar with a REDDI report. Ms. Langston stated she called in a REDDI report to the Campbell County Sheriff\u2019s 911 Dispatch on October 24, 2010. Ms. Langston stated that she remembered the call very well. Ms. Langston testified that the subject of the REDDI report was a single cab vehicle which she identified as a green Ford Ranger. . . . Ms. Langston testified that she traveled east from her residence to Hwy 59. When she reached Hwy 59, she was unable to pull onto the highway because there was an on-coming vehicle traveling north that she had to wait to pass. Once the vehicle passed, Ms. Langston was able to safely pull her vehicle onto Hwy 59 and travel [n]orth to Wright, Wyoming. Ms. Langston stated that she quickly caught up to the vehicle that she had just had to wait for prior to pulling onto the highway. Ms. Langston testified the vehicle, which she identified as a green single cab Ford Ranger, was traveling at varying speeds and was having great difficulty maintaining its lane of travel. When asked, Ms. Langston stated the green Ford Ranger was drifting all the way into the southbound lane, bumping the fog line on the southbound lane of travel, then drifting back into the northbound lane and bumping the fog line. . . . Ms. Langston stated she had her daughter and her daughter\u2019s friend with her in her vehicle and was afraid so decided to call 911 to report the green Ford Ranger as a REDDI report. Ms. Langston stated she followed the green Ford Ranger the rest of the way to Wright, Wyoming where she observed it pull off into the parking lot of Hank\u2019s Bar and Lounge. Ms. Langston testified she remained on the phone with the 911 dispatcher while she was following the green Ford Ranger. Ms. Langston stated since she had two children with her in her vehicle she was afraid to follow the green Ford Ranger into the parking lot, so she pulled into the gas station across the street and continued to watch the green Ford Ranger and updated the 911 dispatcher. Ms. Langston testified that there was only one occupant in the green Ford Ranger while she was following behind it on Hwy 59.\n\nAt approximately 1152 hours on February 28, 2011, the Defendant\u2019s attorney began his cross examination of Ms. Langston. During cross, Ms. Langston testified she could see the cab of the green Ford Ranger when it was parked at Hank\u2019s Bar and Lounge. Ms. Langston stated she watched the green Ford Ranger the entire time she was on the phone with 911 until she was informed a Deputy was on his way. Ms. Langston stated she was afraid to get too close to the green Ford Ranger to get a license plate number when it was driving on Hwy 59 due to the erratic driving. Ms. Langston was questioned if she was sure the vehicle was a Ford Ranger. She stated she was sure as she used to drive an identical Ford Ranger as the one she was following and observing.\n\nAt approximately 1154 hours on February 28, 2011, the State conducted re-direct of Ms. Langston. Ms. Langston stated that while she was watching the green Ford pickup, nobody got in or out of the pickup and that the driver remained in the same position.\n\n[\u00b632] Deputy Raymond testified that he responded to Ms. Langston\u2019s REDDI report by going to Hank\u2019s Bar, but could not locate the vehicle. In response to a second REDDI report, he went to milepost 79; it took him approximately three minutes to get there. Deputy Raymond found \u201cthe little green Ford Ranger pickup\u201d off the side of the road. He called in the license plate number and learned the vehicle belonged to Mr. Reynolds. When he approached the vehicle, it was running and there was one person inside. The driver was talking on his cell phone and, when he realized the deputy was standing by the vehicle, he ended his call, turned off the vehicle, removed the key from the ignition, and threw it on the passenger side floorboard. The driver identified himself as John Reynolds.\n\n[\u00b633] A prosecutor\u2019s closing argument must be based upon the evidence produced at trial.

His mother was Caroline Harriets, daughter of Dr Trott. From Westminster School he went to Guy\u2019s Hospital and after two years in practice with his father set up as a full time radiologist in 1920. In World War I he served with the R.A.M.C, in home hospitals until 1917 when he became electrical specialist to the Karachi Brigade in India, returning home in 1919. In 1921 he was appointed physician-in-charge of the X-ray departments of Charing Cross and the National Hospitals; his son, Seymour, succeeded him at Charing Cross in 1946, and he retired from the National Hospital in 1939.\n\nFor many years he was adviser in radiology to the Ministry of Pensions and Supply and an examiner to Cambridge University, the Conjoint Board, the Faculty of Radiologists and the R.A.M.C. On his retirement in 1946 he acted as honorary consulting radiologist to the Charing Cross, National, Samaritan, Bethlem Royal and Lambeth Hospitals, and to the Caernarvon and Anglesey Infirmary.\n\nFrom 1924 he had experimented with methods of cineradiography, pioneering in photofluorography with a very wide aperture camera lens. His success brought worldwide recognition. He was president of the British Institute of Radiology and of the section of radiology of the Royal Society of Medicine, warden of the Fellowship of the Faculty of Radiologists, Hunterian professor of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1936, and was awarded the Antoine Beclere award in Paris in 1957.\n\nIn addition he was made a member of the Canadian Radiological Society, the American Roentgen Ray Society, the New York Roentgen Society, the Association of Physicians of Vienna and the Society of Radiologists of Italy; the Australian College of Radiology elected him a fellow.\n\nHe was the author of many publications, particularly in his specialised field of cineradiography which culminated in the production of the Russell Reynolds cineradiographic unit. His paper on the early history of radiology in Britain was published in Clinical Radiology (1961, 12, 136-42).\n\nReynolds was quiet, unassuming and kindly; his strong personality was shown only in his teaching, which brought him the enthusiasm of students and the deep respect of his colleagues. In 1908 he married Anna Thekla Henriette, daughter of Adolf Romer, a banker. They had two sons, Seymour and Stewart, both of whom became consultant radiologists.\n\nRichard R Trail\n\n[Brit.med.J., 1964, 2, 1271 (p), 1403; Charing Cr. Hosp.

The amount is what prosecutors say Reynolds pocketed illegally while sitting in three Circuit Court branches in the 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHart characterized the case as ''a tragedy for the defendant, his family and for the Circuit Court of Cook County.'' He ordered Reynolds to surrender Oct. 28 to begin serving his prison sentence.\n\nThe sentencing hearing was marked by a misty-eyed appeal for mercy by Reynolds who said his indictment and trial had left him stripped of all but his personal dignity. Prosecutors had urged Hart to send a message to would-be corrupt public officials by imposing a 20-year sentence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n''In my heart, I`m a good man,'' Reynolds began, his voice cracking with emotion. ''I`m not a bad person. I have never knowingly, intentionally hurt anyone in my life. Secondly, I want you to know how sorry I am, especially for my family, my wife and children, who have stood by me through all these terrible times.''\n\nReynolds was convicted by a federal jury May 7 on one count of racketeering, 30 counts of mail fraud and filing false federal income tax returns for 1979, 1980 and 1981. Under the racketeering statute, a convicted defendant can be compelled to forfeit any money prosecutors prove he has pocketed as a result of his illegal scheme.\n\nReynolds is the sixth sitting or former Cook County Circuit Court judge to have been sent to prison as a result of the ongoing Greylord probe.\n\nFormer Judge Reginald Holzer was sentenced to 18 years in prison by U.S. District Judge Prentice Marshall, the harshest Greylord sentence imposed so far.\n\nRichard LeFevour, former presiding judge of the court`s 1st Municipal Division and former supervising judge of Traffic Court, and former Judge Wayne Olson were sentenced to 12 years each in prison while former Associate Judge John Murphy received 10 years. A 15-year sentence was imposed on former Associate Judge John Devine.\n\nAs the sentence was imposed, Reynolds buried his eyes in a white handkerchief, shaking his head from side to side. His wife, Emily, who sat in the front row with Reynolds` son, Kiernan, jumped from her seat and walked to the defense table where she sought to console her husband.\n\nHarvey Silets, Reynolds` attorney, had urged leniency for his client, reminding Hart that Reynolds had lost his law license, had been disgraced in the eyes of his family and friends and had been stripped of his judicial pension. He also assailed the credibility of attorneys Thomas DelBeccaro, Arthur Cirignani and Edward Nydam, the key prosecution witnesses.\n\nDelBeccaro was a ''money hungry hustler,'' Cirignani was ''not unlike the Fagan of Oliver Twist,'' and Nydam was ''a heroin junkie,'' Silets charged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut First Assistant U.S. Atty. Daniel Reidy, a principal architect of the Greylord probe, urged a lengthy sentence, saying, ''Wherever the defendant was assigned in the Circuit Court of Cook County, whether Felony Court or Traffic Court or Maybrook Court in Maywood, he sought to make money for himself by selling his position.''\n\nReidy said Reynolds had tossed out a burglary case involving organized crime figures and had dismissed drunken-driving cases in exchange for bribes. He also charged that Reynolds had showed no remorse since his conviction.\n\nDuring the four-week trial, Reidy and Assistant U.S. Atty. James Schweitzer introduced evidence showing that Reynolds steered lucrative cases to Nydam, DelBeccaro and Cirignani between 1979 and 1981 while the three practiced in Reynolds` courtroom at Belmont and Western Avenues.\n\nIn exchange, prosecutors contended, Reynolds received kickbacks equal to one-half the fees the lawyers received in the cases.\n\nReynolds took the stand in his defense and for two days denied the accusations of Cirignani and DelBeccaro, at one point saying they were\n\n''aggressive young men of good character, good integrity and good ethics.''\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked by Silets how he paid bills for certain luxury items and travels to Europe and Mexico, Reynolds said he maintained a $2,500 contingency cash fund in a sock in his top dresser door and dipped into it periodically to pay his bills."}, {"url": "https://mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/493/reynolds-v-united-states", "page_content": "George Reynolds was a party to Reynolds v. United States (1879), in which the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a federal law prohibiting polygamy did not violate the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. The Court\u2019s decision was among the first to hold that the free exercise of religion is not absolute. (Image via Wikimedia Commons, public domain)\n\nIn Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145 (1879), the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a federal law prohibiting polygamy did not violate the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. The Court\u2019s decision was among the first to hold that the free exercise of religion is not absolute.\n\nReynolds was sentenced for polygamy\n\nThe case began when George Reynolds, a resident of the Territory of Utah, was sentenced to two years at hard labor and assessed a $500 fine by a federal court for violating a federal anti-bigamy law. Congress had passed the statute against polygamy because it perceived that such a practice contravened good order and peace.\n\nBy practicing polygamy, Reynolds, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also known as the Mormon Church), was following what was then one of the central tenets of his religion. Appealing his case to the Supreme Court, Reynolds argued that the anti-bigamy law was in direct violation of the First Amendment\u2019s free exercise clause.\n\nCourt said government could regulate actions that violated \"police powers\"\n\nAlthough the Court agreed with Reynolds that the free exercise of religion underlay the founding of the United States, it also held that government officials have a right to regulate behavior as part of religious practices that are considered odious and violate basic notions of morality. Until the inception of the Mormon Church, the Court noted, the northern and western nations of Europe and every state had criminalized polygamy.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling in 1879 that a federal law prohibiting polygamy was not a violation of religious liberty led to its important belief-action dichotomy for free exercise clause cases. A government can't interfere with a person's religious beliefs except when the religious practice violates certain notions of healthy, safety and morality. Polygamy continues to be prosecuted in the United States. In this photo, attorney Bill Morrison consults with four of his five clients, the wives of polygamist Tom Green, Thursday, June 29, 2000, in Nephi, Utah. Tom Green was convicted of four counts of bigamy and one count of child rape. (AP Photo/Douglas C. Pizac, used with permission from The Associated Press.)\n\nMore important, the Court created a belief-action dichotomy for free exercise clause cases. It held that the federal government cannot interfere with a person\u2019s religious beliefs, except when a religious practice violates certain notions of health, safety, and morality \u2014 commonly called police powers. Reynolds, therefore, had the freedom to believe in polygamy, but he could not practice it, because the action violated national police powers.\n\nIf the federal government could not regulate certain religious actions, the Court concluded, religious doctrines would become the superior law of the land. Indeed, in oft-cited language, Chief Justice Morrison Waite wrote: \u201cTo permit this would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself. Government could exist only in name under such circumstances.\u201d\n\nBelief-action dichotomy has become a central principle of free exercise jurisprudence\n\nSince this case, the belief-action dichotomy created by the Court in Reynolds has become a central principle of free exercise clause jurisprudence.\n\nJustices have cited this principle in cases such as:\n\nThis article was originally published in 2009.

Compiled Laws of Utah, ed. of 1876, p. 357, sect. 4.\n\n6 The court overruled the plea, on the ground that the territorial enactment governed.\n\n7 The prisoner then pleaded not guilty. Several jurors were examined on their voire dire by the district attorney. Among them was Eli Ransohoff, who, in answer to the question, 'Have you formed or expressed an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner at the bar?' said, 'I have expressed an opinion by reading the papers with the reports of the trial.'\n\n8 Q. 'Would that opinion influence your verdict in hearing the evidence?'\n\n9 A. 'I don't think it would.'\n\n10 By the defendant: 'You stated that you had formed some opinion by reading the reports of the previous trial?'\n\n11 A. 'Yes.'\n\n12 Q. 'Is that an impression which still remains upon your mind?'A. 'No; I don't think it does: I only glanced over it, as everybody else does.'\n\n13 Q. 'Do you think you could try the case wholly uninfluenced by any thing?'\n\n14 A. 'Yes.'\n\n15 Charles Read, called as a juror, was asked by the district attorney, 'Have you formed or expressed any opinion as to the guilt or innocence of this charge?'\n\n16 A. 'I believe I have formed an opinion.'\n\n17 By the court: 'Have you formed and expressed an opinion?'\n\n18 A. 'No, sir; I believe not.'\n\n19 Q. 'You say you have formed an opinion?'\n\n20 A. 'I have.'\n\n21 Q. 'Is that based upon evidence?'\n\n22 A. 'Nothing produced in court.'\n\n23 Q. 'Would that opinion influence your verdict?'\n\n24 A. 'I don't think it would.'\n\n25 By defendant: 'I understood you to say that you had formed an opinion, but not expressed it.'\n\n26 A. 'I don't know that I have expressed an opinion: I have formed one.'\n\n27 Q. 'Do you now entertain that opinion?'\n\n28 A. 'I do.'\n\n29 The defendant challenged each of these jurors for cause. The court overruled the challenge, and permitted them to be sworn. The defendant excepted.\n\n30 The court also, when Homer Brown was called as a juror, allowed the district attorney to ask him the following questions: Q. 'Are you living in polygamy?' A. 'I would rather not answer that.' The court instructed the witness that he must answer the question, unless it would criminate him. By the district attorney: 'You understand the conditions upon which you refuse?' A. 'Yes, sir.'\u2014Q. 'Have you such an opinion that you could not find a verdict for the commission of that crime?' A. 'I have no opinion on it in this particular case. I think under the evidence and the law I could render a verdict accordingly.' Whereupon the United States challenged the said Brown for favor, which challenge was sustained by the court, and the defendant excepted.\n\n31 John W. Snell, also a juror, was asked by the district attorney on voire dire: Q. 'Are you living in polygamy?' A. 'I decline to answer that question.'\u2014Q. 'On what ground?' A. 'It might criminate myself; but I am only a fornicator.' Whereupon Snell was challenged by the United States for cause, which challenge was sustained, and the defendant excepted.\n\n32 After the trial commenced, the district attorney, after proving that the defendant had been married on a certain day to Mary Ann Tuddenham, offered to prove his subsequent marriage to one Amelia Jane Schofield during the lifetime of said Mary. He thereupon called one Pratt, the deputy marshal, and showed him a subpoena for witnesses in this case, and among other names thereon was the name of Mary Jane Schobold, but no such name as Amelia Jane Schofield. He testified that this subpoena was placed in his hands to be served.\n\n33 Q. 'Did you see Mr. Reynolds when you went to see Miss Schofield?'\n\n34 A. 'Yes, sir.'\n\n35 Q. 'Who did you inquire for?'\n\n36 A. 'I inquired for Mary Jane Schofield, to the best of my knowledge. I will state this, that I inserted the name in the subpoena, and intended it for the name of the woman examined in this case at the former term of the court, and inquired for Mary Jane Schofield, or Mrs. Reynolds, I do not recollect certainly which.'\n\n37 Q. 'State the reply.'\n\n38 A. 'He said she was not at home.'\n\n39 Q. 'Did he say any thing further.'\n\n40 A. 'I asked him then where I could find her. I said, 'Where is she? And he said, 'You will have to find out.\"\n\n41 Q. 'Did he know you to be a deputy marshal?'\n\n42 A. 'Yes, sir.'\n\n43 Q. 'Did you tell him what your business was as deputy marshal?'\n\n44 A. 'I don't remember now: I don't think I did.'\n\n45 Q. 'What else did he say?'A. 'He said, just as I was leaving, as I understood it, that she did not appear in this case.'\n\n46 The court then ordered a subpoena to issue for Amelia Jane Schofield, returnable instanter.\n\n47 Upon the following day, at ten o'clock A.M., the said subpoena for the said witness having issued about nine o'clock P.M. of the day before, the said Arthur Pratt was again called upon, and testified as follows:\u2014\u2014\n\n48 Q. (By district attorney.) 'State whether you are the officer that had subpoena in your hands.' (Exhibiting subpoena last issued, as above set forth.)\n\n49 A. 'Yes, sir.'\n\n50 Q. 'State to the court what efforts you have made to serve it.'\n\n51 A. 'I went to the residence of Mr. Reynolds, and a lady was there, his first wife, and she told me that this woman was not there; that that was the only home that she had, but that she hadn't been there for two or three weeks. I went again this morning, and she was not there.'\n\n52 Q. 'Do you know any thing about her home,\u2014where she resides?'\n\n53 A. 'I know where I found her before.'\n\n54 Q. 'Where?'\n\n55 A. 'At the same place.'\n\n56 Q. 'You are the deputy marshal that executed the process of the court?'\n\n57 A. 'Yes, sir.'\n\n58 Q. 'Repeat what Mr. Reynolds said to you when you went with the former subpoena introduced last evening.'\n\n59 A. 'I will state that I put her name on the subpoena myself. I know the party, and am well acquainted with her, and I intended it for the same party that I subpoenaed before in this case. He said that she was not in, and that I could get a search-warrant if I wanted to search the house. I said, 'Will you tell me where she is?' He said, 'No; that will be for you to find out.' He said, just as I was leaving the house,\u2014I don't remember exactly what it was, but my best recollection is that he said she would not appear in this case.'Q. 'Can't you state that more particularly?'\n\n60 A. 'I can't give you the exact words, but I can say that was the purport of them.'\n\n61 Q. 'Give the words as nearly as you can.'\n\n62 A. 'Just as I said, I think those were his words.'\n\n63 The district attorney then offered to prove what Amelia Jane Schofield had testified to on a trial of another indictment charging the prisoner with bigamy in marrying her; to which the prisoner objected, on the ground that a sufficient foundation had not been laid for the introduction of the evidence.\n\n64 A. S. Patterson, having been sworn, read, and other witnesses stated, said Amelia's testimony on the former trial, tending to show her marriage with the defendant. The defendant excepted to the admission of the evidence.\n\n65 The court, in summing up to the jury, declined to instruct them, as requested by the prisoner, that if they found that he had married in pursuance of and conformity with what he believed at the time to be a religious duty, their verdict should be 'not guilty,' but instructed them that if he, under the influence of a religious belief that it was right, had 'deliberately married a second time, having a first wife living, the want of consciousness of evil intent\u2014the want of understanding on his part that he was committing crime\u2014did not excuse him, but the law inexorably, in such cases, implies criminal intent.'\n\n66 The court also said: 'I think it not improper, in the discharge of your duties in this case, that you should consider what are to be the consequences to the innocent victims of this delusion. As this contest goes on, they multiply, and there are pure-minded women and there are innocent children,\u2014innocent in a sense even beyond the degree of the innocence of childhood itself. These are to be the sufferers; and as jurors fail to do their duty, and as these cases come up in the Territory, just so do these victims multiply and spread themselves over the land.'\n\n67 To the refusal of the court to charge as requested, and to the charge as given, the prisoner excepted. The jury found him guilty, as charged in the indictment; and the judgment that he be imprisoned at hard labor for a term of two years, and pay a fine of $500, rendered by the District Court, having been affirmed by the Supreme Court of the Territory, he sued out this writ of error.\n\n68 The assignments of error are set out in the opinion of the court.\n\n69 Mr. George W. Biddle and Mr. Ben Sheeks for the plaintiff in error.\n\n70 First, The jury was improperly drawn. Two of the jurors were challenged for cause by the defendant below, because they admitted that they had formed, and still entertained, an opinion upon the guilt or innocence of the prisoner. The holding by a juror of any opinions which would disqualify him from rendering a verdict in accordance with the law of the land, is a valid objection to his serving.\n\n71 An opinion based merely upon a hypothetical case, as that 'if so and so is true, the prisoner is guilty,' is not always sufficient; but where the opinion is as to the actual fact of guilt or innocence, it is a disqualification, according to all the authorities.

The State, 13 Ark. 740.\n\n72 It was clearly erroneous for the prosecution to ask several of the jurymen, upon voire dire, whether they were living in polygamy; questions which tend to disgrace the person questioned, or to render him amenable to a criminal prosecution, have never been allowed to be put to a juror. Anonymous, Salk. 153; Bacon, Abr., tit. Juries, 12(f); 7 Dane, Abr. 334; Hudson v. The State, 1 Blackf. (Ind.) 319.\n\n73 Second, The proof of what the witness, Amelia Jane Schofield, testified to in a former trial, under another indictment, should not have been admitted. The constitutional right of a prisoner to confront the witness and cross-examine him is not to be abrogated, unless it be shown that the witness is dead, or out of the jurisdiction of the court; or that, having been summoned, he appears to have been kept away by the adverse party on the trial. It appeared not only that no such person as Amelia Jane Schofield had been subpoenaed, but that no subpoena had ever been taken out for her. An unserved subpoena with the name of Mary Jane Schobold was shown. At nine o'clock in the evening, during the trial, a new subpoena was issued; and on the following morning, with no attempt to serve it beyond going to the prisoner's usual residence and inquiring for her, the witness Patterson was allowed to read from a paper what purported to be statements made by Amelia Jane Schofield on a former trial. No proof was offered as to the genuineness of the paper or its origin, nor did the witness testify to its contents of his own knowledge. This is in the teeth of the ruling in United States v. Wood (3 Wash. 440), and the rule laid down in all the American authorities. Richardson v. Stewart, 2 Serg. & R. (Pa.) 84; Chess v. Chess, 17 id. 409; Huidekopper v.

(Va.) 722; Bergen v. The People, 17 Ill. 426; Dupree v. The State, 33 Ala. 380.\n\n74 Third, As to the constitutionality of the Poland Bill. Rev. Stat., sect. 5352. Undoubtedly Congress, under art. 4, sect. 3, of the Constitution, which gives 'power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States,' and under the decisions of this court upon it, may legislate over such territory, and regulate the form of its local government. But its legislation can be neither exclusive nor arbitrary. The power of this government to obtain and hold territory over which it might legislate, without restriction, would be inconsistent with its own existence in its present form. There is always an excess of power exercised when the Federal government attempts to provide for more than the assertion and preservation of its rights over such territory, and interferes by positive enactment with the social and domestic life of its inhabitants and their internal police. The offence prohibited by sect. 5352 is not a malum in se; it is not prohibited by the decalogue; and, if it be said that its prohibition is to be found in the teachings of the New Testament, we know that a majority of the people of this Territory deny that the Christian law contains any such prohibition.\n\n75 The Attorney-General and The Solicitor-General, contra.\n\n76 MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court.\n\n77 The assignments of error, when grouped, present the following questions:\u2014\u2014\n\n78 1. Was the indictment bad because found by a grand jury of less than sixteen persons?\n\n79 2. Were the challenges of certain petit jurors by the accused improperly overruled?\n\n80 3. Were the challenges of certain other jurors by the government improperly sustained?\n\n81 4. Was the testimony of Amelia Jane Schofield, given at a former trial for the same offence, but under another indictment, improperly admitted in evidence?\n\n82 5. Should the accused have been acquitted if he married the second time, because he believed it to be his religious duty?\n\n83 6. Did the court err in that part of the charge which directed the attention of the jury to the consequences of polygamy?\n\n84 These questions will be considered in their order.\n\n85 1. As to the grand jury.\n\n86 The indictment was found in the District Court of the third judicial district of the Territory. The act of Congress 'in relation to courts and judicial officers in the Territory of Utah,' approved June 23, 1874 (18 Stat. 253), while regulating the qualifications of jurors in the Territory, and prescribing the mode of preparing the lists from which grand and petit jurors are to be drawn, as well as the manner of drawing, makes no provision in respect to the number of persons of which a grand jury shall consist. Sect. 808, Revised Statutes, requires that a grand jury impanelled before any district or circuit court of the United States shall consist of not less than sixteen nor more than twenty-three persons, while a statute of the Territory limits the number in the district courts of the Territory to fifteen. Comp. Laws Utah, 1876, 357. The grand jury which found this indictment consisted of only fifteen persons, and the question to be determined is, whether the section of the Revised Statutes referred to or the statute of the Territory governs the case.\n\n87 By sect. 1910 of the Revised Statutes the district courts of the Territory have the same jurisdiction in all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States as is vested in the circuit and district courts of the United States; but this does not make them circuit and district courts of the United States. We have often so decided. American Insurance Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511; Benner et al. v. Porter, 9 How. 235; Clinton v. Englebrecht, 13 Wall. 434. They are courts of the Territories, invested for some purposes with the powers of the courts of the United States. Writs of error and appeals lie from them to the Supreme Court of the Territory, and from that court as a territorial court to this in some cases.\n\n88 Sect. 808 was not designed to regulate the impanelling of grand juries in all courts where offenders against the laws of the United States could be tried, but only in the circuit and district courts. This leaves the territorial courts free to act in obedience to the requirements of the territorial laws in force for the time being. Clinton v. Englebrecht, supra; Hornbuckle v. Toombs, 18 Wall. 648. As Congress may at any time assume control of the matter, there is but little danger to be anticipated from improvident territorial legislation in this particular. We are therefore of the opinion that the court below no more erred in sustaining this indictment than it did at a former term, at the instance of this same plaintiff in error, in adjudging another bad which was found against him for the same offence by a grand jury composed of twenty-three persons. 1 Utah, 226.\n\n89 2. As to the challenges by the accused.\n\n90 By the Constitution of the United States (Amend. VI.), the accused was entitled to a trial by an impartial jury. A juror to be impartial must, to use the language of Lord Coke, 'be indifferent as he stands unsworn.' Co. Litt. 155 b. Lord Coke also says that a principal cause of challenge is 'so called because, if it be found true, it standeth sufficient of itself, without leaving any thing to the conscience or discretion of the triers' (id. 156 b); or, as stated in Bacon's Abridgment, 'it is grounded on such a manifest presumption of partiality, that, if found to be true, it unquestionably sets aside the . . . juror.' Bac. Abr., tit. Juries, E. 1. 'If the truth of the matter alleged is admitted, the law pronounces the judgment; but if denied, it must be made out by proof to the satisfaction of the court or the triers.' Id. E. 12. To make out the existence of the fact, the juror who is challenged may be examined on his voire dire, and asked any questions that do not tend to his infamy or disgrace.\n\n91 All of the challenges by the accused were for principal cause. It is good ground for such a challenge that a juror has formed an opinion as to the issue to be tried. The courts are not agreed as to the knowledge upon which the opinion must rest in order to render the juror incompetent, or whether the opinion must be accompanied by malice or ill-will; but all unite in holding that it must be founded on some evidence, and be more than a mere impression. Some say it must be positive (Gabbet, Criminal Law, 391); others, that it must be decided and substantial (Armistead's Case, 11 Leigh (Va.), 659; Wormley's Case, 10 Gratt. (Va.) 658; Neely v. The People, 13 Ill. 685); others, fixed (State v. Benton, 2 Dev. & B. (N. C.) L. 196); and, still others, deliberate and settled (Staup v. Commonwealth, 74 Pa. St. 458; Curley v. Commonwealth, 84 id. 151). All concede, however, that, if hypothetical only, the partiality is not so manifest as to necessarily set the juror aside. Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, in Burr's Trial (1 Burr's Trial, 416), states the rule to be that 'light impressions, which may fairly be presumed to yield to the testimony that may be offered, which may leave the mind open to a fair consideration of the testimony, constitute no sufficient objection to a juror; but that those strong and deep impressions which close the mind against the testimony that may be offered in opposition to them, which will combat that testimony and resist its force, do constitute a sufficient objection to him.' The theory of the law is that a juror who has formed an opinion cannot be impartial. Every opinion which he may entertain need not necessarily have that effect. In these days of newspaper enterprise and universal education, every case of public interest is almost, as a matter of necessity, brought to the attention of all the intelligent people in the vicinity, and scarcely any one can be found among those best fitted for jurors who has not read or heard of it, and who has not some impression or some opinion in respect to its merits. It is clear, therefore, that upon the trial of the issue of fact raised by a challenge for such cause the court will practically be called upon to determine whether the nature and strength of the opinion formed are such as in law necessarily to raise the presumption of partiality. The question thus presented is one of mixed law and fact, and to be tried, as far as the facts are concerned, like any other issue of that character, upon the evidence. The finding of the trial court upon that issue ought not to be set aside by a reviewing court, unless the error is manifest. No less stringent rules should be applied by the reviewing court in such a case than those which govern in the consideration of motions for new trial because the verdict is against the evidence. It must be made clearly to appear that upon the evidence the court ought to have found the juror had formed such an opinion that he could not in law be deemed impartial. The case must be one in which it is manifest the law left nothing to the 'conscience or discretion' of the court.\n\n92 The challenge in this case most relied upon in the argument here is that of Charles Read. He was sworn on his voire dire; and his evidence, taken as a whole, shows that he 'believed' he had formed an opinion which he had never expressed, but which he did not think would influence his verdict on hearing the testimony. We cannot think this is such a manifestation of partiality as to leave nothing to the 'conscience or discretion' of the triers. The reading of the evidence leaves the impression that the juror had some hypothetical opinion about the case, but it falls far short of raising a manifest presumption of partiality. In considering such questions in a reviewing court, we ought not to be unmindful of the fact we have so often observed in our experience, that jurors not unfrequently seek to excuse themselves on the ground of having formed an opinion, when, on examination, it turns out that no real disqualification exists. In such cases the manner of the juror while testifying is oftentimes more indicative of the real character of his opinion than his words. That is seen below, but cannot always be spread upon the record. Care should, therefore, be taken in the reviewing court not to reverse the ruling below upon such a question of fact, except in a clear case. The affirmative of the issue is upon the challenger. Unless he shows the actual existence of such an opinion in the mind of the juror as will raise the presumption of partiality, the juror need not necessarily be set aside, and it will not be error in the court to refuse to do so. Such a case, in our opinion, was not made out upon the challenge of Read. The fact that he had not expressed his opinion is important only as tending to show that he had not formed one which disqualified him. If a positive and decided opinion had been formed, he would have been incompetent even though it had not been expressed. Under these circumstances, it is unnecessary to consider the case of Ransohoff, for it was confessedly not as strong as that of Read.\n\n93 3. As to the challenges by the government.\n\n94 The questions raised upon these assignments of error are not whether the district attorney should have been permitted to interrogate the jurors while under examination upon their voire dire as to the fact of their living in polygamy. No objection was made below to the questions, but only to the ruling of the court upon the challenges after the testimony taken in answer to the questions was in. From the testimony it is apparent that all the jurors to whom the challenges related were or had been living in polygamy. It needs no argument to show that such a jury could not have gone into the box entirely free from bias and prejudice, and that if the challenge was not good for principal cause, it was for favor. A judgment will not be reversed simply because a challenge good for favor was sustained in form for cause. As the jurors were incompetent and properly excluded, it matters not here upon what form of challenge they were set aside. In one case the challenge was for favor. In the courts of the United States all challenges are tried by the court without the aid of triers (Rev. Stat. sect. 819), and we are not advised that the practice in the territorial courts of Utah is different.\n\n95 4. As to the admission of evidence to prove what was sworn to by Amelia Jane Schofield on a former trial of the accused for the same offence but under a different indictment.\n\n96 The Constitution gives the accused the right to a trial at which he should be confronted with the witnesses against him; but if a witness is absent by his own wrongful procurement, he cannot complain if competent evidence is admitted to supply the place of that which he has kept away. The Constitution does not guarantee an accused person against the legitimate consequences of his own wrongful acts. It grants him the privilege of being confronted with the witnesses against him; but if he voluntarily keeps the witnesses away, he cannot insist on his privilege. If, therefore, when absent by his procurement, their evidence is supplied in some lawful way, he is in no condition to assert that his constitutional rights have been violated.\n\n97 In Lord Morley's Case (6 State Trials, 770), as long ago as the year 1666, it was resolved in the House of Lords 'that in case oath should be made that any witness, who had been examined by the coroner and was then absent, was detained by the means or procurement of the prisoner, and the opinion of the judges asked whether such examination might be read, we should answer, that if their lordships were satisfied by the evidence they had heard that the witness was detained by means or procurement of the prisoner, then the examination might be read; but whether he was detained by means or procurement of the prisoner was matter of fact, of which we were not the judges, but their lordships.' This resolution was followed in Harrison's Case (12 id. 851), and seems to have been recognized as the law in England ever since. In Regina v. Scaife (17 Ad. & El. N. S. 242), all the judges agreed that if the prisoner had resorted to a contrivance to keep a witness out of the way, the deposition of the witness, taken before a magistrate and in the presence of the prisoner, might be read. Other cases to the same effect are to be found, and in this country the ruling has been in the same way. Drayton v. Wells, 1 Nott & M. (S. C.) 409; Williams v. The State, 19 Ga. 403. So that now, in the leading text-books, it is laid down that if a witness is kept away by the adverse party, his testimony, taken on a former trial between the same parties upon the same issues, may be given in evidence. 1 Greenl. Evid., sect. 163; 1 Taylor, Evid., sect. 446. Mr. Wharton (1 Whart. Evid., sect. 178) seemingly limits the rule somewhat, and confines it to cases where the witness has been corruptly kept away by the party against whom he is to be called, but in reality his statement is the same as that of the others; for in all it is implied that the witness must have been wrongfully kept away. The rule has its foundation in the maxim that no one shall be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong; and, consequently, if there has not been, in legal contemplation, a wrong committed, the way has not been opened for the introduction of the testimony. We are content with this long-established usage, which, so far as we have been able to discover, has rarely been departed from. It is the outgrowth of a maxim based on the principles of common honesty, and, if properly administered, can harm no one.\n\n98 Such being the rule, the question becomes practically one of fact, to be settled as a preliminary to the admission of secondary evidence. In this respect it is like the preliminary question of the proof of loss of a written instrument, before secondary evidence of the contents of the instrument can be admitted. In Lord Morley's Case (supra), it would seem to have been considered a question for the trial court alone, and not subject to review on error or appeal; but without deeming it necessary in this case to go so far as that, we have no hesitation in saying that the finding of the court below is, at least, to have the effect of a verdict of a jury upon a question of fact, and should not be disturbed unless the error is manifest.\n\n99 The testimony shows that the absent witness was the alleged second wife of the accused; that she had testified on a former trial for the same offence under another indictment; that she had no home, except with the accused; that at some time before the trial a subpoena had been issued for her, but by mistake she was named as Mary Jane Schobold; that an officer who knew the witness personally went to the house of the accused to serve the subpoena, and on his arrival inquired for her, either by the name of Mary Jane Schofield or Mrs. Reynolds; that he was tole by the accused she was not at home; that he then said, 'Will you tell me where she is?' that the reply was 'No; that will be for you to find out;' that the officer then remarked she was making him considerable trouble, and that she would get into trouble herself; and the accused replied, 'Oh, no; she won't, till the subpoena is served upon her,' and then, after some further conversation, that 'She does not appear in this case.'\n\n100 It being discovered after the trial commenced that a wrong name had been inserted in the subpoena, a new subpoena was issued with the right name, at nine o'clock in the evening. With this the officer went again to the house, and there found a person known as the first wife of the accused. He was told by her that the witness was not there, and had not been for three weeks. He went again the next morning, and not finding her, or being able to ascertain where she was by inquiring in the neighborhood, made return of that fact to the court. At ten o'clock that morning the case was again called; and the foregoing facts being made to appear, the court ruled that evidence of what the witness had sworn to at the former trial was admissible.\n\n101 In this we see no error. The accused was himself personally present in court when the showing was made, and had full opportunity to account for the absence of the witness, if he would, or to deny under oath that he had kept her away. Clearly, enough had been proven to cast the burden upon him of showing that he had not been instrumental in concealing or keeping the witness away. Having the means of making the necessary explanation, and having every inducement to do so if he would, the presumption is that he considered it better to rely upon the weakness of the case made against him than to attempt to develop the strength of his own. Upon the testimony as it stood, it is clear to our minds that the judgment should not be reversed because secondary evidence was admitted.\n\n102 This brings us to the consideration of what the former testimony was, and the evidence by which it was proven to the jury.\n\n103 It was testimony given on a former trial of the same person for the same offence, but under another indictment. It was substantially testimony given at another time in the same cause. The accused was present at the time the testimony was given, and had full opportunity of cross-examination. This brings the case clearly within the well-established rules. The cases are fully cited in 1 Whart. Evid., sect. 177.\n\n104 The objection to the reading by Mr. Patterson of what was sworn to on the former trial does not seem to have been because the paper from which he read was not a true record of the evidence as given, but because the foundation for admitting the secondary evidence had not been laid. This objection, as has already been seen, was not well taken.\n\n105 5. As to the defence of religious belief or duty.\n\n106 On the trial, the plaintiff in error, the accused, proved that at the time of his alleged second marriage he was, and for many years before had been, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, commonly called the Mormon Church, and a believer in its doctrines; that it was an accepted doctrine of that church 'that it was the duty of male members of said church, circumstances permitting, to practise polygamy; . . . that this duty was enjoined by different books which the members of said church believed to be of divine origin, and among others the Holy Bible, and also that the members of the church believed that the practice of polygamy was directly enjoined upon the male members thereof by the Almighty God, in a revelation to Joseph Smith, the founder and prophet of said church; that the failing or refusing to practise polygamy by such male members of said church, when circumstances would admit, would be punished, and that the penalty for such failure and refusal would be damnation in the life to come.' He also proved 'that he had received permission from the recognized authorities in said church to enter into polygamous marriage; . . . that Daniel H. Wells, one having authority in said church to perform the marriage ceremony, married the said defendant on or about the time the crime is alleged to have been committed, to some woman by the name of Schofield, and that such marriage ceremony was performed under and pursuant to the doctrines of said church.'\n\n107 Upon this proof he asked the court to instruct the jury that if they found from the evidence that he 'was married as charged\u2014if he was married\u2014in pursuance of and in conformity with what he believed at the time to be a religious duty, that the verdict must be 'not guilty.\" This request was refused, and the court did charge 'that there must have been a criminal intent, but that if the defendant, under the influence of a religious belief that it was right,\u2014under an inspiration, if you please, that it was right,\u2014deliberately married a second time, having a first wife living, the want of consciousness of evil intent\u2014the want of understanding on his part that he was committing a crime\u2014did not excuse him; but the law inexorably in such case implies the criminal intent.'\n\n108 Upon this charge and refusal to charge the question is raised, whether religious belief can be accepted as a justification of an overt act made criminal by the law of the land. The inquiry is not as to the power of Congress to prescribe criminal laws for the Territories, but as to the guilt of one who knowingly violates a law which has been properly enacted, if he entertains a religious belief that the law is wrong.\n\n109 Congress cannot pass a law for the government of the Territories which shall prohibit the free exercise of religion. The first amendment to the Constitution expressly forbids such legislation. Religious freedom is guaranteed everywhere throughout the United States, so far as congressional interference is concerned. The question to be determined is, whether the law now under consideration comes within this prohibition.\n\n110 The word 'religion' is not defined in the Constitution. We must go elsewhere, therefore, to ascertain its meaning, and nowhere more appropriately, we think, than to the history of the times in the midst of which the provision was adopted. The precise point of the inquiry is, what is the religious freedom which has been guaranteed.\n\n111 Before the adoption of the Constitution, attempts were made in some of the colonies and States to legislate not only in respect to the establishment of religion, but in respect to its doctrines and precepts as well. The people were taxed, against their will, for the support of religion, and sometimes for the support of particular sects to whose tenets they could not and did not subscribe. Punishments were prescribed for a failure to attend upon public worship, and sometimes for entertaining heretical opinions. The controversy upon this general subject was animated in many of the States, but seemed at last to culminate in Virginia. In 1784, the House of Delegates of that State having under consideration 'a bill establishing provision for teachers of the Christian religion,' postponed it until the next session, and directed that the bill should be published and distributed, and that the people be requested 'to signify their opinion respecting the adoption of such a bill at the next session of assembly.'\n\n112 This brought out a determined opposition. Amongst others, Mr. Madison prepared a 'Memorial and Remonstrance,' which was widely circulated and signed, and in which he demonstrated 'that religion, or the duty we owe the Creator,' was not within the cognizance of civil government. Semple's Virginia Baptists, Appendix. At the next session the proposed bill was not only defeated, but another, 'for establishing religious freedom,' drafted by Mr. Jefferson, was passed. 1 Jeff. Works, 45; 2 Howison, Hist. of Va. 298. In the preamble of this act (12 Hening's Stat. 84) religious freedom is defined; and after a recital 'that to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion, and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles on supposition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy which at once destroys all religious liberty,' it is declared 'that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government for its officers to interfere when principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order.' In these two sentences is found the true distinction between what properly belongs to the church and what to the State.\n\n113 In a little more than a year after the passage of this statute the convention met which prepared the Constitution of the United States.' Of this convention Mr. Jefferson was not a member, he being then absent as minister to France. As soon as he saw the draft of the Constitution proposed for adoption, he, in a letter to a friend, expressed his disappointment at the absence of an express declaration insuring the freedom of religion (2 Jeff. Works, 355), but was willing to accept it as it was, trusting that the good sense and honest intentions of the people would bring about the necessary alterations. 1 Jeff. Works, 79. Five of the States, while adopting the Constitution, proposed amendments. Three\u2014New Hampshire, New York, and Virginia\u2014included in one form or another a declaration of religious freedom in the changes they desired to have made, as did also North Carolina, where the convention at first declined to ratify the Constitution until the proposed amendments were acted upon. Accordingly, at the first session of the first Congress the amendment now under consideration was proposed with others by Mr. Madison. It met the views of the advocates of religious freedom, and was adopted. Mr. Jefferson afterwards, in reply to an address to him by a committee of the Danbury Baptist Association (8 id. 113), took occasion to say: 'Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God; that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship; that the legislative powers of the government reach actions only, and not opinions,\u2014I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between church and State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore man to all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.' Coming as this does from an acknowledged leader of the advocates of the measure, it may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the amendment thus secured. Congress was deprived of all legislative power over mere opinion, but was left free to reach actions which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good order.\n\n114 Polygamy has always been odious among the northern and western nations of Europe, and, until the establishment of the Mormon Church, was almost exclusively a feature of the life of Asiatic and of African people. At common law, the second marriage was always void (2 Kent, Com. 79), and from the earliest history of England polygamy has been treated as an offence against society. After the establishment of the ecclesiastical courts, and until the time of James I., it was punished through the instrumentality of those tribunals, not merely because ecclesiastical rights had been violated, but because upon the separation of the ecclesiastical courts from the civil the ecclesiastical were supposed to be the most appropriate for the trial of matrimonial causes and offences against the rights of marriage, just as they were for testamentary causes and the settlement of the estates of deceased persons.\n\n115 By the statute of 1 James I. (c. 11), the offence, if committed in England or Wales, was made punishable in the civil courts, and the penalty was death. As this statute was limited in its operation to England and Wales, it was at a very early period re-enacted, generally with some modifications, in all the colonies. In connection with the case we are now considering, it is a significant fact that on the 8th of December, 1788, after the passage of the act establishing religious freedom, and after the convention of Virginia had recommended as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States the declaration in a bill of rights that 'all men have an equal, natural, and unalienable right to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience,' the legislature of that State substantially enacted the statute of James I., death penalty included, because, as recited in the preamble, 'it hath been doubted whether bigamy or poligamy be punishable by the laws of this Commonwealth.' 12 Hening's Stat. 691. From that day to this we think it may safely be said there never has been a time in any State of the Union when polygamy has not been an offence against society, cognizable by the civil courts and punishable with more or less severity. In the face of all this evidence, it is impossible to believe that the constitutional guaranty of religious freedom was intended to prohibit legislation in respect to this most important feature of social life. Marriage, while from its very nature a sacred obligation, is nevertheless, in most civilized nations, a civil contract, and usually regulated by law. Upon it society may be said to be built, and out of its fruits spring social relations and social obligations and duties, with which government is necessarily required to deal. In fact, according as monogamous or polygamous marriages are allowed, do we find the principles on which the government of the people, to a greater or less extent, rests. Professor, Lieber says, polygamy leads to the patriarchal principle, and which, when applied to large communities, fetters the people in stationary despotism, while that principle cannot long exist in connection with monogamy. Chancellor Kent observes that this remark is equally striking and profound. 2 Kent, Com. 81, note (e). An exceptional colony of polygamists under an exceptional leadership may sometimes exist for a time without appearing to disturb the social condition of the people who surround it; but there cannot be a doubt that, unless restricted by some form of constitution, it is within the legitimate scope of the power of every civil government to determine whether polygamy or monogamy shall be the law of social life under its dominion.\n\n116 In our opinion, the statute immediately under consideration is within the legislative power of Congress. It is constitutional and valid as prescribing a rule of action for all those residing in the Territories, and in places over which the United States have exclusive control. This being so, the only question which remains is, whether those who make polygamy a part of their religion are excepted from the operation of the statute. If they are, then those who do not make polygamy a part of their religious belief may be found guilty and punished, while those who do, must be acquitted and go free. This would be introducing a new element into criminal law. Laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinions, they may with practices. Suppose one believed that human sacrifices were a necessary part of religious worship, would it be seriously contended that the civil government under which he lived could not interfere to prevent a sacrifice? Or if a wife religiously believed it was her duty to burn herself upon the funeral pile of her dead husband, would it be beyond the power of the civil government to prevent her carrying her belief into practice?\n\n117 So here, as a law of the organization of society under the exclusive dominion of the United States, it is provided that plural marriages shall not be allowed. Can a man excuse his practices to the contrary because of his religious belief? To permit this would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself. Government could exist only in name under such circumstances.\n\n118 A criminal intent is generally an element of crime, but every man is presumed to intend the necessary and legitimate consequences of what he knowingly does. Here the accused knew he had been once married, and that his first wife was living. He also knew that his second marriage was forbidden by law. When, therefore, he married the second time, he is presumed to have intended to break the law. And the breaking of the law is the crime. Every act necessary to constitute the crime was knowingly done, and the crime was therefore knowingly committed. Ignorance of a fact may sometimes be taken as evidence of a want of criminal intent, but not ignorance of the law. The only defence of the accused in this case is his belief that the law ought not to have been enacted. It matters not that his belief was a part of his professed religion: it was still belief, and belief only.\n\n119 In Regina v. Wagstaff (10 Cox Crim. Cases, 531), the parents of a sick child, who omitted to call in medical attendance because of their religious belief that what they did for its cure would be effective, were held not to be guilty of manslaughter, while it was said the contrary would have been the result if the child had actually been starved to death by the parents, under the notion that it was their religious duty to abstain from giving it food. But when the offence consists of a positive act which is knowingly done, it would be dangerous to hold that the offender might escape punishment because he religiously believed the law which he had broken ought never to have been made. No case, we believe, can be found that has gone so far.\n\n120 6. As to that part of the charge which directed the attention of the jury to the consequences of polygamy.\n\n121 The passage complained of is as follows: 'I think it not improper, in the discharge of your duties in this case, that you should consider what are to be the consequences to the innocent victims of this delusion. As this contest goes on, they multiply, and there are pure-minded women and there are innocent children, innocent in a sense even beyond the degree of the innocence of childhood itself. These are to be the sufferers; and as jurors fail to do their duty, and as these cases come up in the Territory of Utah, just so do these victims multiply and spread themselves over the land.'\n\n122 While every appeal by the court to the passions or the prejudices of a jury should be promptly rebuked, and while it is the imperative duty of a reviewing court to take care that wrong is not done in this way, we see no just cause for complaint in this case. Congress, in 1862 (12 Stat. 501), saw fit to make bigamy a crime in the Territories. This was done because of the evil consequences that were supposed to flow from plural marriages. All the court did was to call the attention of the jury to the peculiar character of the crime for which the accused was on trial, and to remind them of the duty they had to perform. There was no appeal to the passions, no instigation of prejudice. Upon the showing made by the accused himself, he was guilty of a violation of the law under which he had been indicted: and the effort of the court seems to have been not to withdraw the minds of the jury from the issue to be tried, but to bring them to it; not to make them partial, but to keep them impartial.\n\n123 Upon a careful consideration of the whole case, we are satisfied that no error was committed by the court below.\n\n124 Judgment affirmed.\n\n125 MR. JUSTICE FIELD.\n\n126 I concur with the majority of the court on the several points decided except one,\u2014that which relates to the admission of the testimony of Amelia Jane Schofield given on a former trial upon a different indictment. I do not think that a sufficient foundation was laid for its introduction. The authorities cited by the Chief Justice to sustain its admissibility seem to me to establish conclusively the exact reverse.\n\n127 NOTE.\u2014At a subsequent day of the term a petition for a rehearing having been filed, MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court."}]}
