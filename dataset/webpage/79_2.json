He was not overly physical in his defending either, preferring to win the ball through quick thinking and anticipation rather than just brute strength. So in some ways he was ahead of his time.\n\nThis refined approach to the game made him a popular player among the Celtic support and the Scotland selectors who capped him 14 times.\n\nHe became the captain in 1961, and then led the first team to the Scottish Cup matches v Dunfermline (the final & replay), but in both unfortunately Celtic once again came up short and lost. The side were perennially underachieving despite the wealth of talent on hand.\n\nWith Celtic so poor, he actually decided openly to request a move to England, but there was surprisingly little interest (Celtic\u2019s poor state a likely major cause of the lack of interest). You have to take in the poor team management at the time at Celtic, lack of morale in the squad and the constant board meddling. It wasn\u2019t an uncommon position. Jimmy Johnstone, Billy McNeill and Lennox were all also on the verge of leaving or giving up before Jock Stein\u2019s arrival at Celtic.\n\nDuncan McKay lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill in 1963, and his place in the first team later in the year. His last game was a single appearance in the 1964/65 season with a 4-2 defeat to Hearts.\n\nHe was not a heavy goalscorer, but curiously once he scored his first the others soon enough followed. He took a long time to score his first for Celtic, a penalty in a 7-0 victory over St Mirren in November 1962. However, over April & May 1963, he scored five goals (all penalties), including a double over Raith Rovers in a Scottish Cup semi-final. His last goal (also a penalty) was in October 1963 as Celtic defeated Aberdeen 3-0.\n\nIt was a great injustice to Duncan McKay\u2019s wonderful ability that he never won any major trophies as a Celt. This popular player eventually left Parkhead in 1964 for Third Lanark after 236 appearances and 7 goals.\n\nThe saddest aspect is that he was a great player in one of the poorer eras for Celtic. After the League Cup win in 1957, Celtic did not win another major trophy again until 1965. His first team career sadly spanned practically the whole of this period. Jock Stein became the club manager only a few months after Duncan Mackay\u2019s departure. If Jock Stein had arrived sooner then possibly Duncan Mackay could have won a medal worthy of his talents.\n\nHe is one of the finest regular long-term first team Celtic players to leave Celtic without a medal for a major trophy (Willie Miller is another in this group). He deserved better, and it is an indictment of the club at the time for just how poor the First Team were.\n\nHowever, the Celtic support more then recognised his talent. In 1967, following the triumph in Lisbon in the European Cup, a poll by the Evening Times amongst its readers surveyed for the best Celtic team in living memory. To his credit, Duncan MacKay walked in at right-back. A great accolade and a mark of the respect the support had for him.\n\nAfter Third Lanark, he moved to Australia to play for various sides and then later to coach clubs there also, with a brief period back home in Scotland between 1972-74 when he was player-coach with Juniors St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHe passed away in December 2018, coincidentally just a few weeks after the passing of Ian Young who had succeeded him as the right-back at Celtic.\n\nPlaying Career\n\nAPPEARANCES LEAGUE SCOTTISH CUP LEAGUE CUP EUROPE TOTAL 1955-64 162 33 37 \u2013 236 Goals 5 2 0 \u2013 7\n\nHonours with Celtic\n\nnone\n\nPictures\n\nForums\n\nArticles\n\nDuncan MacKay Source: http://sesasport.com/?p=760 Duncan MacKay had a relatively short but stellar career with Celtic, racking up 236 games for the club from 1958 to 1964 and 14 Scottish caps in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He moved to Third Lanark in 1964 when Bill Hiddleston was engaged in the destruction of that club and in 1965 Frank Burin from the Croatia club in Melbourne persuaded him to try his luck in Australia. Mackay had an immediate impact on the club which had just been promoted to the Victorian State League, the top division. Croatia had been up and down between the State League and lower divisions over previous seasons but this time president Enver Begovic organised an open cheque-book approach that resulted in the expenditure of \u00a35000 in two months. Hammy McMeechan from Slavia was signed for a Victorian record fee of \u00a31200. Other newcomers were Joe Keenan, Ian Currie, Bobby McLachlan, Bill McIntyre and Brian Adlam. Croatia finished sixth in 1965. It was the \u2018Glamour Team\u2019 of the season, according to the Victorian Soccer Federation Yearbook. The early season form had been poor, six of the first seven games were lost, and it looked as if Croatia would go back down again, but the attraction of Duncan MacKay and the other players resulted in a transformation in the second half of the season when it finished with eleven wins. Croatia was also runner-up in the Dockerty Cup in 1965. The team which was to take Croatia to the top in Victoria and Australia was now in place. Croatia finished 6th in 1966, 3rd in 1967 under Jimmy Adam, and won the State League for the first time in 1968 under coach Mijo Kiss, finishing seven points clear of Polonia. Only four league games were lost all season. In addition, Croatia won the Ampol Cup and the Dockerty Cup, to complete an extraordinary triumph. In 1972 after an incident involving crowd trouble in a match against Hakoah, Croatia was suspended from the Victorian Soccer Federation and eventually refused permission to regain its position in the State League. It was not till 1974 that the Croatians took over Essendon Lions and resumed participation at a lower level. Duncan MacKay returned to Scotland in March 1972 and was player-coach at St Anthony\u2019s, but he came back to Australia to the Azzurri club in Western Australia in 1974 and in 1977 he returned to Melbourne with Essendon Lions as player-coach.\n\nDeath of Celtic great Duncan MacKay\n\nBy: Newsroom Staff on 26 Dec, 2019 11:31\n\nhttp://www.celticfc.net/news/17326\n\nEVERYONE at Celtic Football Club is saddened to hear of the death of former player, Duncan MacKay, who has passed away at the age of 82.\n\nDunky, who played for the Hoops between 1955-64, making 236 appearances and scoring seven goals, is rightly considered a Celtic great. His first-team debut came in August 1958, in a League Cup tie against Clyde at Shawfield, which Celtic won 4-1, and he soon established himself as first-choice right-back in the team.\n\nA highly-rated defender who was an early exponent of the attacking full-back role later honed by the likes of Tommy Gemmell and Jim Craig, Dunky MacKay was a firm fans\u2019 favourite and his leadership qualities were identified by Jimmy McGrory, who made him captain in 1961, succeeding Bertie Peacock as skipper.\n\nHe would later pass on the captain\u2019s armband to Billy McNeill for the start of the 1963/64 season.\n\nIn November 1984, he moved to Third Lanark, before heading out to Australia where he would eventually settle after a brief return to Scotland. He also gained 14 caps for Scotland during his playing career.\n\nThe thoughts and prayers of everyone at Celtic are with Duncan\u2019s family and friends at this very sad time.\n\nThe Celtic players will wear black armbands at today\u2019s game against St Mirren as a mark of respect.\n\nObituary: Duncan Mackay, highly esteemed Celtic full-back who won honours in Australia\n\nBy Matt Vallance\n\n(2)\n\nSource: https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/18141730.obituary-duncan-mackay-highly-esteemed-celtic-full-back-won-honours-australia/Former Celtic captain and Scotland full-back\n\nBorn:July 14, 1937;\n\nDied: December 23, 2019.\n\nIT IS a long way from Maryhill to Melbourne, but in his 82 years that was the journey made by the esteemed former Celtic and Scotland full-back Dunky Mackay.\n\nLike many before him, Duncan\u2019s father, also Duncan, had left the West Highlands for the city, where he worked at several jobs to keep a roof over his family\u2019s head. He insisted the young Duncan wore his Mackay tartan kilt every day. But getting into schoolyard scrapes when responding to taunts of \u201cKiltie, kiltie cauld-bum\u201d began to wear thin with the youngster, and he persuaded his parents to get him into long trousers.\n\nAt St Columba\u2019s High his exceptional skill with a football got him noticed. He moved to St Mary\u2019s Boys\u2019 Guild, where Celtic signed him on a provisional form, farming him out to juniors, Maryhill Harp. By now the teenaged Mackay had seen the great Hungarian side of Ferenc Puskas and the sort of attacking football he wanted to play. He had left school and started an apprenticeship as a marine engineer.\n\nHe turned full-time at Celtic after completing his apprenticeship. During the 1958-59 campaign he made the first of his 236 first-team appearances in a League Cup tie against Clyde. By season\u2019s end he was first choice, and an Under-23 cap. On April 11, 1959, aged 21, he made the first of an eventual 14 appearances for Scotland, against England at Wembley.\n\nHis full-back partner that day was Rangers\u2019 Eric Caldow and the pair hit it off immediately. Indeed, they played together 12 times for Scotland, making Mackay Caldow\u2019s most frequent international partner. Caldow would relate how, as Scotland captain, he once distributed \u2018fan mail\u2019 when the national squad was training at Largs; finding one addressed to \u201cDonkey Mackay\u2019 he quipped, \u201cThis lassie must have seen you playing, Dunky\u201d. In reality, Caldow, rated his Celtic friend very highly as a player.\n\nBut, if things were going well with Scotland, all was not well at Celtic Park, where, following the 1957 League Cup win, the side struggled to compete with Rangers, Kilmarnock and Hearts, then the top teams. Bertie Peacock left the club and Mackay was appointed team captain in 1960, leading them to the Scottish Cup final of 1961, where they lost to Dunfermline after a replay. Indeed, along with 1940s goalkeeper Willie Miller, Mackay shares the \u201cdistinction\u201d of having won more Scotland caps than medals as a Celtic player.\n\nIn 1963 he lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill, then, after injury he lost his first-team place, partly because, it is rumoured, manager Jimmy McGrory and chairman Bob Kelly, who picked the side, did not like Mackay\u2019s attacking sorties up the wing.\n\nIn November, 1964, he left Celtic for Third Lanark. This is one of Scottish football\u2019s great \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d; maybe, had he hung on until Jock Stein returned in February, 1965, he would have regained his place. Stein certainly preferred attacking full-backs. But Thirds were starting to implode and at the end of that season, Mackay joined Melbourne Croatia, who were spending big in a bid to become the top side in the Victoria League.\n\nHe was an instant success, being appointed captain and winning the Player of the Year title in his first season. He led Croatia to several trophies, including a league-and-two-cups treble in 1972, but the club fell foul of Australian Soccer financial rules and collapsed. Mackay returned to Scotland for two seasons, working as a bookbinder and coaching junior outfit St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHis first marriage, when a young man, had failed. But while, back home, he married his second wife, Marilyn, before, in 1974, Perth Azzurri, in Western Australia, offered him a player-coach role.\n\nHe led the Azzurri to back-to-back league titles, then returned to Melbourne, to Essendon Lions, as Croatia had now become. Here he found success as a league-winning coach, before winding down his active involvement in football with South Melbourne Hellas.\n\nMelbourne clearly suited Mackay. In his first spell with Croatia, he turned down the chance to join Pele at New York Cosmos. His non-football working life turned full circle when he joined Transfeld Ship Builders as a Senior Procurement Buyer \u2013 the post he filled until his retirement.\n\nHe and Marilyn, who survives him, had two daughters, Shone and Elissa. He is also survived by son Duncan Junior, from his first marriage, who also lives in Australia. Paul, another son from that first marriage predeceased his father. In retirement, Mackay enjoyed listening to the Beatles, Barbra Streisand and Tony Bennett.\n\nDunky Mackay was a very good full-back. He was Celtic\u2019s Player of the Year in 1963, and Man of the Match when they played Real Madrid at Parkhead in a friendly. Sadly, he never had the medals to show for playing at a low point in the club\u2019s history, but on the other side of the world he finally won a few medals, forged a good reputation as a coach, and perhaps showed Scottish football what it lost when it allowed him to leave.\n\nMATT VALLANCE"}, {"url": "https://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish-cup/archive/scottish-cup-history/scottish-cup-winners/", "page_content": "Scottish Cup - Past Winners\n\nThere have been twenty-five winners of the Scottish Cup.

This was his first cup final he was appearing in and was only days after the tragedy of his penalty miss against Inter Milan in the European cup semi final.\n\nEvery Celtic player was on form but there were truly outstanding performances from Bobby Murdoch and Jimmy Johnstone.

HIBERNIAN 1\n\nOn Hampden\u2019s field Hibs\u2019 hopes lay shredded and Celtic enthused over winning the Scottish Cup as if that were something new to them. Jock Stein grinned expansively and, with fitting decorum, acknowledged the acclaim of the supporters. We wondered what was to be done about this Celtic for it is becoming ridiculous that they should win seven successive league championships then score six goals in the Scottish Cup final and against what was, beforehand declared to be the most formidable challengers that could be produced.\n\nAt Celtic Park yesterday Jock Stein had little to say about the match except that it spoke for itself. He told me: \u201cThat\u2019s the past, \u201ccome and see the future.\u201d We went out to the field where two teams were playing.\n\nThey were from Celtic\u2019s 14 to 16-year-olds and if I were to tell of the astonishing speed and skill and team-sense and attacking flair these lads showed then it would send waves of despair through Scottish club football.\n\nThe evidence is that the Scottish League are premature in designing a trophy to mark Celtic winning seven successive League championships. They should wait until the run is over.\n\nIf there could be any com\u00adplaint about a pleasing Cup final on Saturday it would be that the score-line, suggests that it was an uninteresting one-sided game. It was never that, not even in the final minutes, when Hibs were on their knees, for even then that great competitor, Pat Stanton, was charging into Celtic\u2019s defence seeking a goal to ease his hurt pride.\n\nLINK WITH 6-1\n\nHibs had gone to Hampden with such hope and confidence, with such backing and encouragement, that to lose would have been bad enough. To lose by the biggest score ever in the history of the 98-year-old competition was shattering and maybe incomprehensible to them. The 6-1 final score had been matched in 1888 when Renton, the world champions then, beat Cambuslang.\n\nThere is a link in the scores in that after that final Kelly and McCallum the Renton half backs left and joined a new club being formed in Glasgow\u2014 Celtic! James Kelly became captain of the first Celtic team. He was the father of the late Sir Robert.\n\nThe simple explanation of Hibs\u2019 defeat is that Bobby Murdoch established himself as boss of the mid-field. He ruled that area with the haughty majesty of a ring master, bringing order to it and sending out his acts to delight the audience.\n\nWORLD CLASS\n\nHis was football of world class. Its quality was not just in interception and positioning and in accurate imaginative passes to inspire attacks, but in the less flamboyant settling passes. He could step into trouble and sweep the ball back to the goalkeeper or to a distant part of the field to allow the defence to get organised again. He always did the right thing. In such form there would be a place for him in any team in the world. Yet he is not in the Scotland pool of 22 players for the Home Internationals.\n\nHe was well supported by the running of the willing Tommy Callaghan but not so well by Kenny Dalglish who was out of touch completely and found usefulness only in filling space where Hibs hoped to find it. They had banked on establishing some sort of control in the mid-field.\n\nHibs had looked for so much from Alex Edwards but got very little. I had wondered about him before the match but had not expected that he could so vanish from the play that Pat Stanton would be shouldered with an intolerable burden. Jimmy O\u2019Rourke had his troubles with the speedy Celts and Stanton was left doing the work of three and in a position which is not his best.\n\nThings began to go wrong for Hibs when the rain came on Friday night and made the turf right. The ball sat down and that suited Jimmy Johnstone. There were ominous signs for them them even before the first goal was scored after 120 seconds. Johnstone beat a few men and Celtic strung together a few passes and clearly they were in the mood.\n\nJohnstone gave Hibs\u2019 defence a terrible time. His briefing was to go wherever he could find space. Thus, since he played in no specific position he was hard to mark. Once he got jinking there was only one way to stop him and when Hibs\u2019 defenders resorted to that they lost two goals from free kicks.\n\nThe first was a bad one to lose for when Billy McNeill took up position for the free kick he was loosely marked with much space in front of him and into that the ball was put. He was unimpeded when he shot the goal. There after Gordon had to do much running going up with McNeill for the set pieces in front of goal.\n\nIt was one of McNeill\u2019s best games. He had impressive control in the air and the expected heading duel between him and Alan Gordon did not materialise. Gordon won the ball but twice yet each header of his produced a half chance. Long before the end Gordon and young Hazell had been played out of the game by McNeill and George Connelly and only Arthur Duncan, on the left, was a threat. Eventually he was injured and had to be substituted. Connelly was a magnificent partner for McNeill.\n\nThe four Hibs backs had much to contend with in the switching imps, Lou Macari and Dixie Deans, and the jinking Johnstone and the probing of Murdoch and the running of Callaghan but they coped commendably well. Schaedler was the better full back for Brownlie, under pressure lost composure. Black was safe but Blackley was more than that in skill and competitiveness.\n\nBlackley was Hibs\u2019 most effective player and had he been able to stick to his own job then Celtic would not have found goal-scoring so easy. But when the midfield was lost he went charging forward trying to get into the game. This was forced on him for nobody else looked like shaking Celtic\u2019s defence.In the later stages when Hibs were trying to save face by pushing on they were at the mercy of the long passes of Murdoch springing Macari and Deans.\n\nThis Dixie Deans just can\u00adnot keep out of the limelight. He enjoyed the circumstances on Saturday for to score three goals in a Scottish Cup final must be the ultimate in foot\u00adball happiness. The second, in which he beat Brownlie twice and Herriot twice, was one we longed to see in action replay. Twice Macari came within an inch or two of matching the three goals and that would have been the ultimate in wonder.\n\nStein said yesterday. \u201cLet\u2019s take stock of the season, we won the League championship and the Scottish Cup and we were in the final of the League Cup and were not beaten in any of the European Cup matches. I think we did all right.\u201d\n\nAt least Hibs were not beaten by mugs. Glasgow Herald Monday May 8 1972 Longstanding cup record equalled by six-goal CelticBy Jim Parkinson Celtic 6, Hibernian 1 The last time six goals were scored in a Scottish Cup final goes back hazily to 1888, the year Celtic was instituted by Brother Walfrid as a means of dispensing help to the needy and impover\u00adished in Glasgow\u2019s East End.Since then the club have adhered to the basic principles of their origin, widening the circle of their benevolence but without extending it to rivals.Celtic were ruthlessly uncharitable to Hibernian at Hampden as they equalled the long-forgotten record by Renton, the reputed world champions of their day, and won the national trophy for the twenty-second time in their history.This final may be remarkable to the 106,102 spectators and the players and officials for a variety of reasons, but I shall always recall it for Cel\u00adtic\u2019s sheer simplicity in the art of goal-scoring. Such a lopsided result could easily give the impression that the game ceased to be alive long before the end, but the quality of those Celtic goals sustained interest at an exciting peak throughout. ACHIEVEMENT To add such an astonishing cup success to their league championship victory is an outstanding achievement for a team in the transitional stage, remembering also that they reached the League Cup final and were knocked out of their European Cup semi-final only on a technicality.Dixie Deans, whose miss in the deciding penalty series against Internationale put Celtic out of the European tournament, more than atoned by scoring three goals in his first Scottish Cup final \u2014 a feat made all the more memorable by the way in which he scored his second. Had it been executed by some one of the striking and dribbling prow\u00adess of Jimmy Johnstone it would have come as no surprise, but three times Deans might have lost the ball on a solo run which ended with his shooting the ball emphatically into the net.Deans and Jock Stein were, at the end, locked in a bear-hug all the way from the pitch to the tunnel as Celtic prepared to receive their medals. Stein, the architect of four other Celtic Scottish Cup successes as well as another with Dunfermline Athletic, had been proven right yet again, having decided early in the week that Deans must play in the final, along with young Kenny Dalglish, the only other player in the team who had not won a Scottish Cup-winners\u2019 medal.The Celtic manager reckoned that both deserved their places on their average ratings over the season, and after all they are two of the players the club will depend on in the future.Around them they had other fine players, and none better than Bobby Murdoch. He was Celtic\u2019s nerve-centre. The play pivoted around him in a steady pattern and yet he was at a disadvantage, having taken a knee knock in the first minute of the game.Tommy Callaghan, who masterfully controlled the midfield in partnership with Murdoch, also was troubled by injury, suffered in the second minute of the match just after McNeill had opened the scoring. The Hibs defence lined up crazily for a free kick, and Celtic\u2019s captain ran in to side-foot the ball into the net.This goal acted as a tranquilliser to Celtic, and even though Alan Gordon brought Hibs leveI minutes later, the Parkhead men calmly exhibited their skills. Jimmy Johnstone had the freedom of the pitch and used it effectively. It was a foul against him that led to the free kick for the first goal, and he was brought down again on the other side of the field in 24 minutes, with the result that Deans headed the next one.CONCUSSION Hibs were left stranded. Determination and the strong Arthur Duncan \u2014 who, unfortunately was carried off with concussion in the second half \u2014 were the Edinburgh side\u2019s only assets, and in an attempt to break Celtic\u2019s hold in midfield they even moved their sweeper, John Blackley, into attack. Pat Stanton also went forward.This gamble cruelly exposed further weaknesses in Hibs\u2019 defence. Deans and Lou Macari, wearing the No. 9 jersey, punched holes through the middle, and Johnstone alternated on the wings to pressurise the full backs, John Brownlie and Eric Schaedler.After Deans had put the issue beyond recall with two more goals in the second half, Celtic\u2019s defence had their concen\u00adtration disturbed by the crowd behind their goal. Spectators fled to the safety of the track to avoid flying bottles and beer cans, and youths from other sections of the West terracing added to the commotion by joining in the rush, just to be on the pitch.Stanton and Gordon had Hibs best scoring openings of the game at that point but Evan Williams dealt capably with everything that came his way.Celtic\u2019s rear quartette, McNeill; Jim Brogan, George Connelly, and Jim Craig, who was playing his last match for the Parkehead club, were utterly composed, apart from this brief second-half spell, and Craig even found time to help out his attackers. He had a big hand in the last two goals, both scored by Macari.Even the redoubtable men of Renton would have joined in the spontaneous ovation for Celtic had they been at Hampden on Saturday.\n\nThe Scotsman, Monday, May 8, 1972 (Page one).\n\nCeltic manager hits out at TV coverage of cup finals.\n\nBy John Rafferty\n\nThe presentation of the Scottish Cup Final by the Scottish Football Association and its treatment by tele\u00advision were strongly criti\u00adcised yesterday by the Celtic manager, Mr Jock Stein.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Scottish Cup Final is a national occasion but both downgraded it.\u201d\n\nHe was shocked when the teams were sent on the field, just as in any ordinary game, and the referee followed them later. He added: \u201cThat was rubbed in afterwards; when we had to watch the ceremonial at Wembley at the English Cup Final and to see that the Queen was there.\u201d\n\nNOT MENTIONED\n\nMr Stein said: \u201cWith this attitude, : if Kilmarnock had beaten us in the semi-final then the Hibs v. Kilmarnock final would have been just another game, and how many would have been at it.\u201d I think that the Scottish Cup Final must be treated as the big event of the year no matter who are the finalists and that it must be staged in such a way as to show its importance.\u201d\n\nHe was far from satisfied by the pre-match treatment of the final by television. \u201cFor the past week we have been bom\u00adbarded by the English Cup Final on radio and television. On Friday night there were interviews on television with the managers of the English finalists and interviews again on Saturday morning. Neither of the Scottish channels came near us.\n\n\u201cOn Friday night we had the players at Troon and were watching English television. There were programmes about the English final but not a mention of ours. Naturally the players wore not happy and I dare say many of the public were feeling the same. Yet the television people came after the match looking for favours after doing nothing beforehand to stimulate interest.\u201d\n\nThere will be few to disagree with Mr Stein and there will be those who add that the Scottish final was spectacular event with great goals while the English final was dull and not nearly matching its publicity.\n\nMr Stein was speaking in no churlish mood. He was happy beyond words over Celtic\u2019s sub\u00adstantial victory but he has always equated Celtic with Scottish football and has never undersold them.\n\nGlasgow Herald Monday May 8 1972\n\nCELTIC INVITED TO PLAY SANTOSCeltic, with the Scottish League championship and the Scottish Cup firmly secured, have been invited to play prestige games, prob\u00adably against Santos (Brazil), in Toronto and New York within the next few weeks, writes Jim Parkinson.They have been asked to consider the offer and tie it in with their holiday arrangements to Bermuda, where they meet two local teams later this month.It is unlikely that the Parkhead officials will de\u00adpart from their original schedule. The players have had another busy season and are due a well-earned rest.Jock Stein, however, is already looking ahead to next season and giving careful study to proposed pre-season games.\n\nPOSSIBILITIES He would like to have more competition from South America, and all the possibilities will be explored within the next few weeks.The most interesting proposition of all may arise tonight if Leeds United add the English league title to Saturday\u2019s F. A. Cup win. Leeds are too concerned at the moment to talk of such a proposal. But after their match against Wolverhampton Wanderers tonight, and if the result is favourable, discussions are likely to take place.\n\nNo matter Celtic\u2019s match arrangements, Jim Craig has played his last match. He is emigrating to South Africa to further his dental career and business and Celtic have generously released him to play for Hellenic, a Cape Town club, temporarily managed by George Eastham (Stoke City).\n\nHONOURS\n\nCraig has won all the honours with Celtic, and his departure leaves only four of the 1967 European Cup-winning side at Parkhead \u2013 Billy McNeill, Bobby Murdoch, Jimmy Johnstone, and Bobby Lennox. The 29-year-old Scottish International full back leaves for South Africa on May 16. He was thrilled to have made his farewell appearance in a brilliant Celtic team at Hampden, and having contributed to handsomely to the last two goals.There is no lack of replacements for Craig\u2019s position at Parkhead. In addition to David Hay there are a group of young contenders for his place.\n\nArthur Duncan, Hibernian\u2019s outside left who was taken to hospital in the second half at Hampden, was again detained last night.

I met Alf once. He told me it was after I\u2019d played quite well in a cup-tie against Manchester United that he decided to borrow my name. I gave him one of my Scotland shirts and he gave me a signed first edition. I\u2019m not much of a reader although I quite enjoyed the TV show. Pets? I\u2019ve never been one for animals and Ann was the same.\u201d\n\nThis is Herriot\u2019s wife who died three years ago. \u201cShe was my biggest fan; I miss her an awful lot,\u201d he adds, and breaks into another chuckle. \u201cWhen I was at Dunfermline, playing against Rangers, I had to come off with concussion. She was out front at East End as I was being carted into an ambulance. I was in my usual green jersey and a Rangers fan who was passing said something derogatory. Ann bashed him on the head with her brolly.\n\n\u201cThen there was the England-Scotland game at Wembley [1969], the first evening Home International between the countries, and unfortunately we lost 4-1. Afterwards Ann and I were with Jock Stein and his wife; they\u2019d been guests at our wedding. Big Jock was blaming me for one of England\u2019s goals and Ann wasn\u2019t standing for it, no matter the man\u2019s reputation. She gave Big Jock what for.\u201d\n\nAnn wore Jim\u2019s medal round her neck, the badge from Hibs\u2019 December 1972 League Cup triumph, the year\u2019s third Hampden final between the greens. Hibs took the Drybrough Cup as well but in the May, in front of a crowd of 106,101, a Dixie Deans-inspired Celtic ran out 6-1 winners for an 18th Scottish Cup. Stein vs Eddie Turnbull was the classic dugout confrontation of the age and Herriot, who lives in Larkhall, Lanarkshire, played for them both.\n\n\u201cJock was a great manager and Eddie was a great coach. Jock knew how to motivate and psyche you up, whereas Eddie\u2019s man-management was virtually non-existent.\u201d Herriot had a few fall-outs with the boss, wartime veteran of the Arctic Convoys, and was once reprimanded: \u201cDon\u2019t you dare f****n\u2019 swear at me!\u201d He adds: \u201cBut Eddie wasn\u2019t the least bit daunted by the Old Firm and always thought we could beat them with our flair. In training, if the guys made three or four square passes in a row, he\u2019d stop the session.\u201d\n\nHerriot recalls the Tornadoes by nickname: Onion (John Brownlie), Shades (Erich Schaedler), Niddrie (Pat Stanton), Cilla (Jim Black), Sloop (John Blackley), Mickey (Alex Edwards), Biffo (Jimmy O\u2019Rourke), Tosh (Alan Gordon), Nijinsky (Arthur Duncan \u2013 \u201cor the Roadrunner; there was a guy in the Easter Road enclosure who aye shouted \u2018Beep, beep!\u2019 whenever we sent Arthur away from our kick-off\u201d). Pung (John Hazel) deputised for the injured Alex Cropley in the Scottish Cup final, but Sodjer was back for the League Cup. And Herriot? \u201cAt Dunfermline I was Kookie after the detective in 77 Sunset Strip [a hotrod-driving hipster with a heavy personal grooming regime] because I was aye combing my hair like him. At Hibs I got another name. Alex Edwards said: \u2018You walk just like Robert Mitchum \u2013 dead suave.\u2019 So I became Big Bob.\u201d Edwards is one of the old team-mates who regularly checks on his well-being. \u201cI aye know it\u2019s him on the phone. He\u2019ll go: \u2018Is that the world\u2019s worst goalie?\u2019 I\u2019ll tell him: \u2018And you\u2019re the crankiest wee bugger there\u2019s ever been\u2019.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s a funny thing. Instead of picking the ball out of the Hibs net six times 43 years ago, Big Bob could have been Celtic\u2019s \u2019keeper, replacing Ronnie Simpson. \u201cBig Jock had saved my career at Dunfermline. We had five goalies and I was heading out the door but he decided to keep me and Eddie Connaghan. Then he tried to sign me for Celtic when I was at Birmingham, only they wanted a bigger fee than Stoke paid Leicester for Gordon Banks, and he eventually cooled on the idea. I was amazed when he went for Evan Williams, who at that point was in Wolves\u2019 reserves.\u201d\n\nWilliams smiles at his rival\u2019s recollection when I track him down in Dumbarton. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t doubt Jim\u2019s version of events. Yes, I did wonder why Wolves had bothered buying me [from Third Lanark] but when I was out on loan to Aston Villa, Sean Fallon told me not to sign for anyone else because Celtic would be coming.\u201d Was he intimidated by having to fill Simpson\u2019s gloves? \u201cNo, because I\u2019d had to follow Jocky Robertson at Thirds, while at Wolves all I heard was the name Bert Williams.\u201d\n\nTo show Stein what he was missing, Herriot always wanted to put on a show against Celtic. \u201cSometimes that was my downfall. I did have some good games against them but other times I tried too hard and made a fool of myself.\u201d In May \u201972, he was undone by an old trick. \u201cBilly McNeill scored from a header from a corner. Jock knew from Dunfermline that I liked to come for crosses so he had Bobby Lennox block me off. Exactly the same thing happened when Billy scored in the \u201965 final [Celtic 3, Pars 2] and if I remember right it was that bugger Lennox again.\u201d Alan Gordon equalised but Celtic regained the lead before the interval. Herriot again: \u201cIn the second half Eddie had us really attack them, leaving just three at the back. We had as many chances as them, possibly more, but they were so clinical. I know this might sound daft, given it finished 6-1, but we were quite unlucky.\u201d\n\nWilliams would not disagree. \u201cHibs had a great team back then. Even before that final, after I\u2019d played my first ten games for Celtic and we\u2019d won them all, we went to Easter Road and they beat us with two Joe McBride goals. That brought us down to earth. I can name their entire \u201972 side. [He does]. Not bad, given I\u2019m 70 this summer. It tells you the quality they had, at a time in the Scottish game when every team had some rare players. I\u2019m not being patronising, but even at 4-1 Hibs were still in that final. I was pretty pleased with my saves from wee Jimmy O\u2019Rourke and that bag of tricks Alex ?Edwards. Even at 5-1 they kept coming at us.\u201d\n\nCeltic had a great team, too: five Lisbon Lions plus Kenny Dalglish, Lou Macari, George Connelly, Tom Callaghan and Hibee nemesis Deans (18 goals in 13 games against them). \u201cWe were lucky back then,\u201d continues Williams. \u201cWell, not lucky, but we had Jinky who could beat the opposition on his own and Dixie who on that day couldn\u2019t stop scoring.\u201d For one of his goals Deans seemed to have been fired from a circus cannon to connect with a wayward Johnstone shot with his head. His next trick was impossible but \u2013 rounding Herriot twice and dumping three international defenders on their backsides \u2013 he pulled it off. The somersault celebration was less Olga Korbut, more Harry H. Corbett.\n\nAt Hibs\u2019 post-final dinner, Turnbull took the blame for the defeat through his gung-ho tactics and vowed the Tornadoes would be back; they were. At Celtic there was no real celebration, as was customary. Williams again: \u201cThe club won so much at that time and Jock didn\u2019t want us getting blas\u00e9. I won four league championships but never once got to hold the trophy and my four medals were given to me in a oner. Maybe that\u2019s why, until recently, every one I won was kept in a Safeway bag. Sorry to Hibs fans for that!\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s in a name? Evan Williams was christened Samuel. Dixie Deans is really John. The Hibs goalie in \u201972 has been called many things, and seen \u201cJim Herriot\u201d grow into a highly successful literary brand. He hopes Hibs will win on Sunday, writing their own famous story, and his old opposite number agrees they\u2019ve got a chance.\n\nCeltic: Williams, Craig, McNeill, Connelly, Brogan, Johnstone, Dalglish, Murdoch, Callaghan, Macari, Deans.\n\nHibernian: Herriot, Brownlie, Black, Blackley, Schaedler, Edwards, Stanton, Hazel, Duncan, O\u2019Rourke, Gordon.\n\nReferee: A Mackenzie.?Attendance: 106,102\n\nArticles\n\nEvening Times 8th May 1972\n\nGlasgow Herald 8th May 1972"}, {"url": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/18141730.obituary-duncan-mackay-highly-esteemed-celtic-full-back-won-honours-australia/", "page_content": "Born:July 14, 1937;\n\nDied: December 23, 2019.\n\nIT IS a long way from Maryhill to Melbourne, but in his 82 years that was the journey made by the esteemed former Celtic and Scotland full-back Dunky Mackay.\n\nLike many before him, Duncan\u2019s father, also Duncan, had left the West Highlands for the city, where he worked at several jobs to keep a roof over his family\u2019s head. He insisted the young Duncan wore his Mackay tartan kilt every day. But getting into schoolyard scrapes when responding to taunts of \u201cKiltie, kiltie cauld-bum\u201d began to wear thin with the youngster, and he persuaded his parents to get him into long trousers.\n\nAt St Columba\u2019s High his exceptional skill with a football got him noticed. He moved to St Mary\u2019s Boys' Guild, where Celtic signed him on a provisional form, farming him out to juniors, Maryhill Harp. By now the teenaged Mackay had seen the great Hungarian side of Ferenc Puskas and the sort of attacking football he wanted to play. He had left school and started an apprenticeship as a marine engineer.\n\nHe turned full-time at Celtic after completing his apprenticeship. During the 1958-59 campaign he made the first of his 236 first-team appearances in a League Cup tie against Clyde. By season's end he was first choice, and an Under-23 cap. On April 11, 1959, aged 21, he made the first of an eventual 14 appearances for Scotland, against England at Wembley.\n\nHis full-back partner that day was Rangers\u2019 Eric Caldow and the pair hit it off immediately. Indeed, they played together 12 times for Scotland, making Mackay Caldow\u2019s most frequent international partner. Caldow would relate how, as Scotland captain, he once distributed \u2018fan mail\u2019 when the national squad was training at Largs; finding one addressed to \u201cDonkey Mackay\u2019 he quipped, \u201cThis lassie must have seen you playing, Dunky\u201d. In reality, Caldow, rated his Celtic friend very highly as a player.\n\nBut, if things were going well with Scotland, all was not well at Celtic Park, where, following the 1957 League Cup win, the side struggled to compete with Rangers, Kilmarnock and Hearts, then the top teams. Bertie Peacock left the club and Mackay was appointed team captain in 1960, leading them to the Scottish Cup final of 1961, where they lost to Dunfermline after a replay. Indeed, along with 1940s goalkeeper Willie Miller, Mackay shares the \"distinction\u201d of having won more Scotland caps than medals as a Celtic player.\n\nIn 1963 he lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill, then, after injury he lost his first-team place, partly because, it is rumoured, manager Jimmy McGrory and chairman Bob Kelly, who picked the side, did not like Mackay\u2019s attacking sorties up the wing.\n\nIn November, 1964, he left Celtic for Third Lanark. This is one of Scottish football\u2019s great \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d; maybe, had he hung on until Jock Stein returned in February, 1965, he would have regained his place. Stein certainly preferred attacking full-backs. But Thirds were starting to implode and at the end of that season, Mackay joined Melbourne Croatia, who were spending big in a bid to become the top side in the Victoria League.\n\nHe was an instant success, being appointed captain and winning the Player of the Year title in his first season. He led Croatia to several trophies, including a league-and-two-cups treble in 1972, but the club fell foul of Australian Soccer financial rules and collapsed. Mackay returned to Scotland for two seasons, working as a bookbinder and coaching junior outfit St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHis first marriage, when a young man, had failed. But while, back home, he married his second wife, Marilyn, before, in 1974, Perth Azzurri, in Western Australia, offered him a player-coach role.\n\nHe led the Azzurri to back-to-back league titles, then returned to Melbourne, to Essendon Lions, as Croatia had now become. Here he found success as a league-winning coach, before winding down his active involvement in football with South Melbourne Hellas.\n\nMelbourne clearly suited Mackay. In his first spell with Croatia, he turned down the chance to join Pele at New York Cosmos. His non-football working life turned full circle when he joined Transfeld Ship Builders as a Senior Procurement Buyer \u2013 the post he filled until his retirement.\n\nHe and Marilyn, who survives him, had two daughters, Shone and Elissa. He is also survived by son Duncan Junior, from his first marriage, who also lives in Australia. Paul, another son from that first marriage predeceased his father. In retirement, Mackay enjoyed listening to the Beatles, Barbra Streisand and Tony Bennett.\n\nDunky Mackay was a very good full-back. He was Celtic's Player of the Year in 1963, and Man of the Match when they played Real Madrid at Parkhead in a friendly. Sadly, he never had the medals to show for playing at a low point in the club's history, but on the other side of the world he finally won a few medals, forged a good reputation as a coach, and perhaps showed Scottish football what it lost when it allowed him to leave.\n\nMATT VALLANCE"}, {"url": "https://theedinburghreporter.co.uk/2016/05/scottish-cup-final-1972-celtic-6-1-hibernian/", "page_content": "Dejected Hibs\u2019 fans leaving Hampden Park on 6 May 1972 didn\u2019t know it at the time, but that game sparked the emergence of one of the greatest teams in the club\u2019s history which would be forever known as Turnbull\u2019s Tornadoes.\n\nHibs started their Scottish Cup campaign in style with a 2-0 victory over Partick Thistle at Firhill then followed that up with a 2-0 home win over Airdrieonians.\n\nIn the quarter finals, Hibs took care of Aberdeen in front of what was described as a poor crowd of \u2018only\u2019 25,736. A goal from Jimmy O\u2019Rourke after 17 seconds was followed by a Joe Baker strike just after half time and a semi-final place against Rangers beckoned.\n\nThe game took place at Hampden Park and Hibs trailed to an Alex McDonald goal at half time but O\u2019Rourke equalised shortly after the restart and the tie went to a replay.\n\nThat night Hibs produced what many consider to be their best performance in Glasgow, running out comfortable 2-0 winners thanks to goals from Pat Stanton and Alex Edwards. The scoreline didn\u2019t reflect the play however and Hibs could easily have won by a much larger margin.\n\nThat performance inspired great confidence amongst the supporters and probably Hibs\u2019 largest ever travelling support headed west along the M8 to watch the final against Jock Stein\u2019s Celtic.\n\nAmong the fans were the remaining members of the Famous Five including Lawrie Reilly who withdrew from the qualifying stages of the Lothian Golf Tournament to make the trip.\n\nHibs\u2019 manager Eddie Turnbull\u2019s final instruction before the players left the dressing room was to remind Alan Gordon to pick up Billy McNeil at corners and free kicks,\n\nTwo minutes after the start John Hazel was harshly penalised for a foul on Jimmy Johnstone on the right hand side of the pitch and the resultant free kick was met by an unmarked McNeil with Gordon ball watching.\n\n\u2018Tosh\u2019 made amends in the 12th minute when he equalised after a through ball from Blackley found Duncan on the left wing and his powerful cross was fumbled by Williams.\n\nDixie Deans made the score 2-1 midway through the first half when Deans headed home from a Bobby Murdoch free kick.\n\nCeltic ran riot in the second half and ended the game as a contest in the 54th minute when deans collected a mis-headed clearance by the normally reliable John Brownlie before dribbling past Jim Heriot and John Blackley before dispatching the ball into the empty net. Unfortunately for Hibs the referee failed to spot a clear handball by Macari in the build up.\n\nEight minutes later Duncan was forced to leave the field with a head injury and he was replaced by former Celtic legend Bertie Auld.\n\nDeans completed his hat trick in the 74th minute after latching onto a through ball from Tommy Callaghan.\n\nThis led to fighting on the terraces at the Mount Florida end and thousands of fans invaded the track behind the goals as fans of both sides threw beer cans at each other.\n\nLou Macari made it 5- 1 in the 84th minute and completed the scoring three minutes later.\n\nThe Hibs team that day was Herriot, Brownlie Schaedler, Stanton, Black, Blackley, Edwards, Hazel, Gordon, O\u2019Rourke, Duncan.

He was not overly physical in his defending either, preferring to win the ball through quick thinking and anticipation rather than just brute strength. So in some ways he was ahead of his time.\n\nThis refined approach to the game made him a popular player among the Celtic support and the Scotland selectors who capped him 14 times.\n\nHe became the captain in 1961, and then led the first team to the Scottish Cup matches v Dunfermline (the final & replay), but in both unfortunately Celtic once again came up short and lost. The side were perennially underachieving despite the wealth of talent on hand.\n\nWith Celtic so poor, he actually decided openly to request a move to England, but there was surprisingly little interest (Celtic\u2019s poor state a likely major cause of the lack of interest). You have to take in the poor team management at the time at Celtic, lack of morale in the squad and the constant board meddling. It wasn\u2019t an uncommon position. Jimmy Johnstone, Billy McNeill and Lennox were all also on the verge of leaving or giving up before Jock Stein\u2019s arrival at Celtic.\n\nDuncan McKay lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill in 1963, and his place in the first team later in the year. His last game was a single appearance in the 1964/65 season with a 4-2 defeat to Hearts.\n\nHe was not a heavy goalscorer, but curiously once he scored his first the others soon enough followed. He took a long time to score his first for Celtic, a penalty in a 7-0 victory over St Mirren in November 1962. However, over April & May 1963, he scored five goals (all penalties), including a double over Raith Rovers in a Scottish Cup semi-final. His last goal (also a penalty) was in October 1963 as Celtic defeated Aberdeen 3-0.\n\nIt was a great injustice to Duncan McKay\u2019s wonderful ability that he never won any major trophies as a Celt. This popular player eventually left Parkhead in 1964 for Third Lanark after 236 appearances and 7 goals.\n\nThe saddest aspect is that he was a great player in one of the poorer eras for Celtic. After the League Cup win in 1957, Celtic did not win another major trophy again until 1965. His first team career sadly spanned practically the whole of this period. Jock Stein became the club manager only a few months after Duncan Mackay\u2019s departure. If Jock Stein had arrived sooner then possibly Duncan Mackay could have won a medal worthy of his talents.\n\nHe is one of the finest regular long-term first team Celtic players to leave Celtic without a medal for a major trophy (Willie Miller is another in this group). He deserved better, and it is an indictment of the club at the time for just how poor the First Team were.\n\nHowever, the Celtic support more then recognised his talent. In 1967, following the triumph in Lisbon in the European Cup, a poll by the Evening Times amongst its readers surveyed for the best Celtic team in living memory. To his credit, Duncan MacKay walked in at right-back. A great accolade and a mark of the respect the support had for him.\n\nAfter Third Lanark, he moved to Australia to play for various sides and then later to coach clubs there also, with a brief period back home in Scotland between 1972-74 when he was player-coach with Juniors St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHe passed away in December 2018, coincidentally just a few weeks after the passing of Ian Young who had succeeded him as the right-back at Celtic.\n\nPlaying Career\n\nAPPEARANCES LEAGUE SCOTTISH CUP LEAGUE CUP EUROPE TOTAL 1955-64 162 33 37 \u2013 236 Goals 5 2 0 \u2013 7\n\nHonours with Celtic\n\nnone\n\nPictures\n\nForums\n\nArticles\n\nDuncan MacKay Source: http://sesasport.com/?p=760 Duncan MacKay had a relatively short but stellar career with Celtic, racking up 236 games for the club from 1958 to 1964 and 14 Scottish caps in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He moved to Third Lanark in 1964 when Bill Hiddleston was engaged in the destruction of that club and in 1965 Frank Burin from the Croatia club in Melbourne persuaded him to try his luck in Australia. Mackay had an immediate impact on the club which had just been promoted to the Victorian State League, the top division. Croatia had been up and down between the State League and lower divisions over previous seasons but this time president Enver Begovic organised an open cheque-book approach that resulted in the expenditure of \u00a35000 in two months. Hammy McMeechan from Slavia was signed for a Victorian record fee of \u00a31200. Other newcomers were Joe Keenan, Ian Currie, Bobby McLachlan, Bill McIntyre and Brian Adlam. Croatia finished sixth in 1965. It was the \u2018Glamour Team\u2019 of the season, according to the Victorian Soccer Federation Yearbook. The early season form had been poor, six of the first seven games were lost, and it looked as if Croatia would go back down again, but the attraction of Duncan MacKay and the other players resulted in a transformation in the second half of the season when it finished with eleven wins. Croatia was also runner-up in the Dockerty Cup in 1965. The team which was to take Croatia to the top in Victoria and Australia was now in place. Croatia finished 6th in 1966, 3rd in 1967 under Jimmy Adam, and won the State League for the first time in 1968 under coach Mijo Kiss, finishing seven points clear of Polonia. Only four league games were lost all season. In addition, Croatia won the Ampol Cup and the Dockerty Cup, to complete an extraordinary triumph. In 1972 after an incident involving crowd trouble in a match against Hakoah, Croatia was suspended from the Victorian Soccer Federation and eventually refused permission to regain its position in the State League. It was not till 1974 that the Croatians took over Essendon Lions and resumed participation at a lower level. Duncan MacKay returned to Scotland in March 1972 and was player-coach at St Anthony\u2019s, but he came back to Australia to the Azzurri club in Western Australia in 1974 and in 1977 he returned to Melbourne with Essendon Lions as player-coach.\n\nDeath of Celtic great Duncan MacKay\n\nBy: Newsroom Staff on 26 Dec, 2019 11:31\n\nhttp://www.celticfc.net/news/17326\n\nEVERYONE at Celtic Football Club is saddened to hear of the death of former player, Duncan MacKay, who has passed away at the age of 82.\n\nDunky, who played for the Hoops between 1955-64, making 236 appearances and scoring seven goals, is rightly considered a Celtic great.

He insisted the young Duncan wore his Mackay tartan kilt every day. But getting into schoolyard scrapes when responding to taunts of \u201cKiltie, kiltie cauld-bum\u201d began to wear thin with the youngster, and he persuaded his parents to get him into long trousers.\n\nAt St Columba\u2019s High his exceptional skill with a football got him noticed. He moved to St Mary\u2019s Boys\u2019 Guild, where Celtic signed him on a provisional form, farming him out to juniors, Maryhill Harp. By now the teenaged Mackay had seen the great Hungarian side of Ferenc Puskas and the sort of attacking football he wanted to play. He had left school and started an apprenticeship as a marine engineer.\n\nHe turned full-time at Celtic after completing his apprenticeship. During the 1958-59 campaign he made the first of his 236 first-team appearances in a League Cup tie against Clyde. By season\u2019s end he was first choice, and an Under-23 cap. On April 11, 1959, aged 21, he made the first of an eventual 14 appearances for Scotland, against England at Wembley.\n\nHis full-back partner that day was Rangers\u2019 Eric Caldow and the pair hit it off immediately. Indeed, they played together 12 times for Scotland, making Mackay Caldow\u2019s most frequent international partner. Caldow would relate how, as Scotland captain, he once distributed \u2018fan mail\u2019 when the national squad was training at Largs; finding one addressed to \u201cDonkey Mackay\u2019 he quipped, \u201cThis lassie must have seen you playing, Dunky\u201d. In reality, Caldow, rated his Celtic friend very highly as a player.\n\nBut, if things were going well with Scotland, all was not well at Celtic Park, where, following the 1957 League Cup win, the side struggled to compete with Rangers, Kilmarnock and Hearts, then the top teams. Bertie Peacock left the club and Mackay was appointed team captain in 1960, leading them to the Scottish Cup final of 1961, where they lost to Dunfermline after a replay. Indeed, along with 1940s goalkeeper Willie Miller, Mackay shares the \u201cdistinction\u201d of having won more Scotland caps than medals as a Celtic player.\n\nIn 1963 he lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill, then, after injury he lost his first-team place, partly because, it is rumoured, manager Jimmy McGrory and chairman Bob Kelly, who picked the side, did not like Mackay\u2019s attacking sorties up the wing.\n\nIn November, 1964, he left Celtic for Third Lanark. This is one of Scottish football\u2019s great \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d; maybe, had he hung on until Jock Stein returned in February, 1965, he would have regained his place. Stein certainly preferred attacking full-backs. But Thirds were starting to implode and at the end of that season, Mackay joined Melbourne Croatia, who were spending big in a bid to become the top side in the Victoria League.\n\nHe was an instant success, being appointed captain and winning the Player of the Year title in his first season. He led Croatia to several trophies, including a league-and-two-cups treble in 1972, but the club fell foul of Australian Soccer financial rules and collapsed. Mackay returned to Scotland for two seasons, working as a bookbinder and coaching junior outfit St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHis first marriage, when a young man, had failed. But while, back home, he married his second wife, Marilyn, before, in 1974, Perth Azzurri, in Western Australia, offered him a player-coach role.\n\nHe led the Azzurri to back-to-back league titles, then returned to Melbourne, to Essendon Lions, as Croatia had now become. Here he found success as a league-winning coach, before winding down his active involvement in football with South Melbourne Hellas.\n\nMelbourne clearly suited Mackay. In his first spell with Croatia, he turned down the chance to join Pele at New York Cosmos. His non-football working life turned full circle when he joined Transfeld Ship Builders as a Senior Procurement Buyer \u2013 the post he filled until his retirement.\n\nHe and Marilyn, who survives him, had two daughters, Shone and Elissa. He is also survived by son Duncan Junior, from his first marriage, who also lives in Australia. Paul, another son from that first marriage predeceased his father. In retirement, Mackay enjoyed listening to the Beatles, Barbra Streisand and Tony Bennett.\n\nDunky Mackay was a very good full-back. He was Celtic\u2019s Player of the Year in 1963, and Man of the Match when they played Real Madrid at Parkhead in a friendly. Sadly, he never had the medals to show for playing at a low point in the club\u2019s history, but on the other side of the world he finally won a few medals, forged a good reputation as a coach, and perhaps showed Scottish football what it lost when it allowed him to leave.\n\nMATT VALLANCE"}, {"url": "https://www.thecelticwiki.com/1973-12-15-celtic-0-1-dundee-league-cup/", "page_content": "Trivia\n\nAttendance is a poor 27,974.

This particular occasion was nothing less than a 90 minute compendium of misery; an unholy coming together of all the worst elements the Scottish Football Experience had to offer.\n\n1973 Scottish League Cup Final programmeAn unfancied Dundee led by ex-Lisbon Lion Tommy Gemmell defeating mighty Celtic 1-0 was almost superfluous detail. This was a terrible game at the climax of a moribund tournament, played in appalling weather at a derelict stadium during a national fuel crisis in front of a paltry and apathetic crowd. It\u2019s no surprise the attendance for this game was by some distance the smallest Hampden had ever seen for a major Final.\n\nThe reason these two teams wearily trudged to Hampden Park on that foul December day in 1973 depends upon which perspective you prefer: to decide that season\u2019s League Cup competition and win the first major silverware of the season, or just to get that infernal tournament out the way for another year. By 1973 the League Cup was a bloated dog\u2019s dinner of a competition stumbling blindly towards utter irrelevance. With group stages, knock-out matches, one-off games, replays and random supplementary rounds; the format was a perplexingly complex and long-winded attempt to brazenly extract as much gate money from gullible punters as possible .\n\nDundee v Celtic Scottish League Cup Final 1973. Even the most faithful of fans had their loyalty tested to breaking point if their team advanced far into the competition. Take Celtic. By the time the final whistle blew at Hampden the Parkhead side had ground their way through 13 League Cup fixtures in just three months, including three Old Firm derbies. This was a ludicrous number when the European Cup could be won in nine games and the Glasgow club needed just six to win the Scottish Cup that same season.\n\nA sensible streamlining of the competition would take another decade to arrive, so the blazers at the Scottish League preferred a minor sop towards experimentation in an attempt to inject some vim into their ailing tournament. For League Cup games only a law that extended the offside line to 18 yards was introduced. To be fair this change did add another dimension to the competition: fans had moaned about the competition being boring, now they complained it was boring and confusing.\n\nDundee v Celtic Scottish League Cup Final 1973But now that Celtic had navigated their way past all of those meaningless games and stood just 90 minutes from silverware, this would surely inspire their supporters to turn out in force at Hampden? Not a chance. Overfamiliarity, apathy and a faint degree of suspicion dictated the terms of Celtic fans\u2019 awkward relationship with Scotland\u2019s second national cup competition. This 1973 game would be Celtic\u2019s tenth successive League Cup Final appearance and if winning five of those first six had been intoxicating, the three successive defeats in recent years \u2013 and especially the sobering 4-1 humiliation by Partick Thistle in 1971 \u2013 had been a stringent coffee enema to the system. With bigger fish to fry in League and European Cup, the League Cup was being seen by the Celtic-minded as a banana skin waiting to be trodden on and make them look foolish.\n\nAnother grim backdrop to this game was the national fuel crisis gripping the nation during that winter of 1973. To minimise electricity use the government had banned the external generators that football clubs utilised to power floodlights. These were troubled and strife-ridden times, but the strong voices in the media calling for the Final to be delayed until later in the season would be ignored.\n\nThe compromise was an earlier 1.30pm kick-off to ensure that the game could be completed before darkness set in, an optimistic notion considering Glasgow is a city where natural light barely breaks through the leaden pall at all during the winter months. The unusual dim and eery half-light the game was played in is captured well in the televised footage (included at the end of this article).\n\nAnd then there was Hampden Park. On a sunny day in May with flags fluttering against the gentle blue sky of a pleasant Scottish spring afternoon, you might just about be able to see past the many problems that blighted Scotland\u2019s grim and decaying national stadium. But for the rest of the year a visit there offered all the welcoming charm of a visit to a gigantic outdoor toilet.\n\nAfter gingerly inspecting the pitch the respective managers Jock Stein and Davie White radiated little in the way of goodwill either. The Hampden turf managed to combine the worst of all worlds: bone-hard underneath from outdoor temperatures that had barely risen above freezing point all week, and a cloying, muddy layer on top from the continuous sleet that fell all day. Both declared it unplayable while expressing their concern for spectator safety on the slippy and snowbound terraces.\n\nDundee v Celtic, Scottish League Cup Final 1973The safety aspect at least wasn\u2019t problematic with the stadium only a quarter full. Fewer than 28,000 brave souls turned out that day to sullenly stand huddled together in pockets on the exposed terraces of the cavernous stadium. Curious neutrals who might have been tempted to attend the game \u2013 had they suffered a temporary breakdown of their critical faculties \u2013 had the alternative of a full League programme taking place simultaneously around the country. Or better still, staying at home.\n\nAnd so to the game itself, for what it was worth. With Celtic firm 2/1 on favourites with the bookmakers, Dundee\u2019s Tommy Gemmell suggested beforehand that it would be \u2018Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs stuff if Dundee were to win\u2019. Surprisingly it was the Tayside club that adapted better to the conditions and managed to put together some decent one-touch football. By contrast Celtic unsuccessfully tried to take advantage of the experimental offside rule change by missing out midfield with long balls to Dalglish, Wilson and Hood.\n\nJohn Duncan shot over the bar in the fifth minute and ten minutes later Danny McGrain cleared a Gordon Wallace effort off the line with keeper Ally Hunter stranded. Dundee should have had a first-half penalty when the ball struck Brogan\u2019s arm. It was early in the second-half before Celtic had their first real chance when Dalglish shot straight into the arms of Dundee keeper Thomson Allan. With the afternoon darkening and standing water amassing on the pitch further reducing the game to a farce, the horrible prospect of another half an hour of this debacle was thankfully averted. Gordon Wallace beat the Celtic defence to a free kick, brought down the ball with his back to goal, turned and swept a shot past Ally Hunter. Sub Jimmy Johnstone came close to an equaliser late on but Dundee held out for a deserved win.\n\nDundee v Celtic Scottish League Cup Final 1973To this day the 1973 League Cup Final represents something of a nadir in Scottish football history. As if the potent combination of administrative incompetence, footballing apathy, infrastructure neglect and the vagaries of the Scottish weather weren\u2019t enough; unusual and never to be repeated external factors added another dimension of dreadfulness to this utter non-event.\n\nIt had been a universally recognised notion that in football a Cup Final represented something special, something distinct; something that set it apart from other games and made it into an occasion of note. The Scottish League Cup Final of 1973 single-handedly came close to demolishing this accepted wisdom for good."}, {"url": "https://dundeefc.co.uk/club/history/our-triumphs/1973-league-cup-win/", "page_content": "Slade topped the charts when Dundee won the League Cup in 1973 but it wasn\u2019t Noddy Holder hollering \u201cIt\u2019s Chriiiiistmassss!\u201d which lifted the gloom amongst a national energy crisis, miners\u2019 strike and horrific weather but a 5ft 9in Dundonian who went by the nickname of \u2018Stubby\u2019.\n\nOn December 15th 1973 Dundee defeated Celtic 1-0 in the League Cup Final at Hampden and Gordon Wallace wrote his name into Dundee folklore. In the seventy-fifth minute \u2018Stubby\u2019 chested down a Bobby Wilson free kick with his back to goal, turned on a sixpence in one swift move and fired the ball past the despairing dive of Celtic\u2019s Ally Hunter to score one of the best goals ever seen in a Hampden final and become an instant Dundee hero.\n\nBy the club\u2019s eightieth year Dundee had an excellent record in the League Cup with two wins, one runners-up, three semi-final and six quarter-final appearances in a competition that was only twenty-seven years old. That 1973 win was therefore Dundee\u2019s third victory in the competition which along with East Fife and Hearts gave them the best record behind the Old Firm.\n\nTo reach the final Dundee defeated Kilmarnock 1-0 in the semi at Hampden thanks to a goal from captain Tommy Gemmell and the match took place on Monday 3rd December after it was originally postponed on November 28th due to snow. With the floodlights powered by a generator producing only a third of its normal power and a spare crowd of just 4682 in attendance, there was an eerie atmosphere in the National Stadium which The Courier described as \u201cghost-like.\u201d\n\nThis was because the miners\u2019 strike had developed into a national energy crisis that would soon bring down Ted Heath\u2019s Conservative Government and with blizzard conditions all over Scotland in the lead up to the Final twelve days later, the game was in doubt right up to kick-off.\n\nFor the Dundee fans there was uncertainty over whether any trains were running and the 50 mph limit on the roads was expected to reduce the Dundee crowd and it took the players\u2019 coach three hours to reach Glasgow through snowbound roads which as a result saw the pre-match meal a hurried affair.\n\nIn the Final Dundee were due to meet Celtic who had emerged from the other semi-final with a 3-1 win over their Old Firm rivals Rangers. The Parkhead side were dominant in the Scottish Football at that time and in the middle of their nine-in-a-row League Championships while in the League Cup had played in the last nine finals winning five of them. Celtic had defeated Dundee 5-3 in the 1967 League Cup Final and with only one defeat to Dundee since 1966, they were strong favourites to take the trophy.\n\nThe kick-off was brought forward to an unprecedented time of 1.30pm to avoid having to switch the floodlights on in the event of extra-time and with freezing conditions of driving snow and sleet neither club wanted it played when they arrived at Mount Florida. Referee Bobby Davidson deemed the pitch playable and told the managers that the game was on and the 29,974 attendance was not surprisingly, the lowest ever for a League Cup Final.\n\nSo for Dundee\u2019s fourth League Cup Final and for the third time the clubs had met in a major final, the line ups were:\n\nDundee: Allan, Wilson, Gemmell (capt.), Ford, Stewart, Phillip, Duncan, Robinson, Wallace, J. Scott, Lambie. Subs \u2013 I. Scott, Johnston.\n\nCeltic: Hunter. McGrain, Brogan, McClusky, McNeill, Murray, Hood, Hay, Wilson, Callaghan, Dalgleish. Subs \u2013 Johnstone, Connelly.\n\nConditions were appalling and by the time kick off arrived, the driving snow and sleet had turned into driving rain which continued throughout the game. The pitch itself was bone hard with slush and pools of water forming as the game went on thanks to the relentless rain. It was also an uncomfortable afternoon for the fans as the terracings were a sea of mud and outside Hampden, there were deep pools of slush and water.\n\nOccasionally players would slip and the ball would bounce and skid awkwardly but despite this, it was an entertaining game. Celtic generally wanted to run with the ball while Dundee looked to use a more studied passing approach and it the early stages it was the Dark Blues who were more successful, creating four good scoring chances to Celtic\u2019s one.\n\nAt the interval however the score was still goalless and as conditions worsened after the break, chances became few and far between.\n\nOn 76 minutes, Dundee\u2019s Bobby Wilson was fouled by Paul Wilson on the halfway line and the right-back dusted himself down and took the free-kick himself. He sent a high, bending ball towards the edge of the Celtic box where it found Gordon Wallace with his back to goal and striker, surrounded by three Celtic defenders, took the ball on his chest and spun, before sweeping a low shot past the diving Ally Hunter.\n\nIt was 1-0 to Dundee and although Celtic moved up a gear in the remaining minutes, the Dark Blues were not to be denied their first trophy in eleven years. Ex-Dee Steve Murray went close before Celtic desperately appealed for a penalty when substitute Jimmy Johnstone went down in the box near the end but the referee was not impressed.\n\nThe downpour had continued until the end but there was no dampening the enthusiasm of the Dundee players and fans when the final whistle sounded and continued when captain Tommy Gemmell went up the Hampden steps to collect the glittering prize.\n\nAlthough Dundee\u2019s League Cup victory had been achieved by solid teamwork and a memorable goal, the swashbuckling Gemmell, who had joined the club in the summer from Nottingham Forest, had been an inspirational skipper. John Duncan was also outstanding in a deeper role on the right as was Wallace and Phillip, while Thomson Allan was immaculate in goal, showing the form that would earn him a place in the Scotland World Cup squad at the end of the season.\n\nAlthough Celtic had forced thirteen corners to Dundee\u2019s five, most of the menace had come from the Dark Blues and the Dens Park club were well worth their victory.\n\nLater the players, officials and wives celebrated in Dundee\u2019s Angus Hotel in the Overgate and the League Cup was paraded at Dens the following week before the next league game against Motherwell.\n\nThe 1973/74 League Cup win is the last major silverware to adorn the Dens Park trophy cabinet and the side who brought it home were a class act who also that season reached the Scottish Cup semi-final, finished fifth in the League and qualified for the UEFA Cup by virtue of that win. Three of that side Gemmell, Wallace and Scott went on to manage the club while three of them Wallace, Scott and Wilson are in the Dundee FC Hall of Fame with more in the coming years sure to follow.\n\nArticle by Kenny Ross"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/duncan.mackay/2398366", "page_content": "Duncan MacKay\n\nassociation football player\n\nJuly 14, 1937 Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom\n\nBorn in Glasgow, Mackay turned professional when he joined Celtic from Maryhill Harp aged 17 in 1955.

He insisted the young Duncan wore his Mackay tartan kilt every day. But getting into schoolyard scrapes when responding to taunts of \u201cKiltie, kiltie cauld-bum\u201d began to wear thin with the youngster, and he persuaded his parents to get him into long trousers.\n\nAt St Columba\u2019s High his exceptional skill with a football got him noticed. He moved to St Mary\u2019s Boys' Guild, where Celtic signed him on a provisional form, farming him out to juniors, Maryhill Harp. By now the teenaged Mackay had seen the great Hungarian side of Ferenc Puskas and the sort of attacking football he wanted to play. He had left school and started an apprenticeship as a marine engineer.\n\nHe turned full-time at Celtic after completing his apprenticeship. During the 1958-59 campaign he made the first of his 236 first-team appearances in a League Cup tie against Clyde. By season's end he was first choice, and an Under-23 cap. On April 11, 1959, aged 21, he made the first of an eventual 14 appearances for Scotland, against England at Wembley.\n\nHis full-back partner that day was Rangers\u2019 Eric Caldow and the pair hit it off immediately. Indeed, they played together 12 times for Scotland, making Mackay Caldow\u2019s most frequent international partner. Caldow would relate how, as Scotland captain, he once distributed \u2018fan mail\u2019 when the national squad was training at Largs; finding one addressed to \u201cDonkey Mackay\u2019 he quipped, \u201cThis lassie must have seen you playing, Dunky\u201d. In reality, Caldow, rated his Celtic friend very highly as a player.\n\nBut, if things were going well with Scotland, all was not well at Celtic Park, where, following the 1957 League Cup win, the side struggled to compete with Rangers, Kilmarnock and Hearts, then the top teams. Bertie Peacock left the club and Mackay was appointed team captain in 1960, leading them to the Scottish Cup final of 1961, where they lost to Dunfermline after a replay. Indeed, along with 1940s goalkeeper Willie Miller, Mackay shares the \"distinction\u201d of having won more Scotland caps than medals as a Celtic player.\n\nIn 1963 he lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill, then, after injury he lost his first-team place, partly because, it is rumoured, manager Jimmy McGrory and chairman Bob Kelly, who picked the side, did not like Mackay\u2019s attacking sorties up the wing.\n\nIn November, 1964, he left Celtic for Third Lanark. This is one of Scottish football\u2019s great \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d; maybe, had he hung on until Jock Stein returned in February, 1965, he would have regained his place. Stein certainly preferred attacking full-backs. But Thirds were starting to implode and at the end of that season, Mackay joined Melbourne Croatia, who were spending big in a bid to become the top side in the Victoria League.\n\nHe was an instant success, being appointed captain and winning the Player of the Year title in his first season. He led Croatia to several trophies, including a league-and-two-cups treble in 1972, but the club fell foul of Australian Soccer financial rules and collapsed. Mackay returned to Scotland for two seasons, working as a bookbinder and coaching junior outfit St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHis first marriage, when a young man, had failed. But while, back home, he married his second wife, Marilyn, before, in 1974, Perth Azzurri, in Western Australia, offered him a player-coach role.\n\nHe led the Azzurri to back-to-back league titles, then returned to Melbourne, to Essendon Lions, as Croatia had now become. Here he found success as a league-winning coach, before winding down his active involvement in football with South Melbourne Hellas.\n\nMelbourne clearly suited Mackay. In his first spell with Croatia, he turned down the chance to join Pele at New York Cosmos. His non-football working life turned full circle when he joined Transfeld Ship Builders as a Senior Procurement Buyer \u2013 the post he filled until his retirement.\n\nHe and Marilyn, who survives him, had two daughters, Shone and Elissa. He is also survived by son Duncan Junior, from his first marriage, who also lives in Australia. Paul, another son from that first marriage predeceased his father. In retirement, Mackay enjoyed listening to the Beatles, Barbra Streisand and Tony Bennett.\n\nDunky Mackay was a very good full-back. He was Celtic's Player of the Year in 1963, and Man of the Match when they played Real Madrid at Parkhead in a friendly. Sadly, he never had the medals to show for playing at a low point in the club's history, but on the other side of the world he finally won a few medals, forged a good reputation as a coach, and perhaps showed Scottish football what it lost when it allowed him to leave.\n\nMATT VALLANCE"}, {"url": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5105150/ex-celtic-duncan-mackay-died-82/", "page_content": "FORMER Celtic player Duncan MacKay has passed away aged 82.\n\nThe former right-back made 236 appearances in green and white after making his Hoops first-team debut in 1958.\n\n1 Celtic have confirmed former player Duncan MacKay has died Credit: PA:Press Association\n\nMacKay, who had came through the ranks, went on to establish himself as a first-team player.\n\nHe was made club captain in 1961 before handing over the armband to Celts legend Billy McNeill in 1963.\n\nCeltic confirmed the news in a statement, writing: \"Everyone at Celtic Football Club is saddened to hear of the death of former player, Duncan MacKay, who has passed away at the age of 82.\n\n\"Dunky, who played for the Hoops between 1955-64, making 236 appearances and scoring seven goals, is rightly considered a Celtic great.\n\n\"His first-team debut came in August 1958, in a League Cup tie against Clyde at Shawfield, which Celtic won 4-1, and he soon established himself as first-choice right-back in the team.\n\n\"A highly-rated defender who was an early exponent of the attacking full-back role later honed by the likes of Tommy Gemmell and Jim Craig, Dunky MacKay was a firm fans\u2019 favourite and his leadership qualities were identified by Jimmy McGrory, who made him captain in 1961, succeeding Bertie Peacock as skipper.\n\n\"He would later pass on the captain\u2019s armband to Billy McNeill for the start of the 1963/64 season.\n\n\"In November 1964, he moved to Third Lanark, before heading out to Australia where he would eventually settle after a brief return to Scotland.

A few days later my father, mother and myself travelled to Hamburg to see Australia\u2019s second match of the tournament against hosts West Germany.\n\n\n\nThe sight of Uncle Jimmy running out in the gold and green of Australia at the Volkspark in Hamburg that June day in 1974 to face a West Germany side containing not only Beckenbauer but also Sepp Maier, Paul Breitner and Gerd M\u00fcller is one that created an indelible impression on an eight-year-old.\n\n\n\nAll the Australians who guided the Socceroos to qualification for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa \u2013 the first time the country have made it through to consecutive tournaments having done so well when the event returned to Germany in 2006 \u2013 will be too young to recall the first time that Australia qualified for the World Cup finals but they will have heard of Jimmy Mackay (pictured), midfielder and scorer of the most famous goal in their country\u2019s history.\n\n\n\nThe scars of England fans, inflicted by elimination by Poland at Wembley in 1973, had barely begun to heal when the progress of Australia\u2019s team of failed professionals induced new agonies. The backbone of the team was English-and Scottish-born players \u2013 such as Jimmy, who was born in Edinburgh and appeared for Airdrieonians \u2013 who had never scaled the heights back home and had moved to Australia to combine playing semi-professional football with a trade. Unlike the present side, fair dinkum Aussies were thin on the ground.\n\n\n\nIt seemed they had blown their chances in a play-off when they drew 0-0 with South Korea in Sydney and quickly went two goals behind in Seoul in the second leg. But they pegged the Koreans back for a draw. With the away-goals rule not operating then, the teams had to replay in Hong Kong three days later.\n\n\n\nIn those days my father, in the Royal Signals and based thousands of miles away at the military base in Herford, West Germany, tried desperately to discover how his brother\u2019s adopted country had done. This, remember, was in the days before the internet, mobile telephones and rolling news channels. Then, much to his surprise, there was a headline on German television.\n\n\n\nI do not think he believed what he saw. The match was locked in stalemate when Jimmy settled the issue with a 25-yard half-volley that flew past the startled Korean keeper into the top left-hand corner. It was voted among the best eight goals worldwide by the following year\u2019s Rothmans Football Yearbook along with efforts from Joe Jordan, Alan Mullery, Malcolm Macdonald, Kevin Keegan and Denis Law.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 5,000-1 outsiders arrived in West Germany amid a fanfare of publicity after being drawn in the same group as the hosts and favourites. After an unlucky 2-0 defeat against East Germany in Hamburg they prepared to face West Germany four days later on the same pitch.\n\n\n\nThe day before the match my dad and I were invited to the Australia training camp. The most fascinating thing for me was not the fact I was having a kick-around with World Cup footballers but that at each corner was a policeman with a semi-automatic gun.\n\n\n\nEveryone had been talking about the prospect of facing the great Beckenbauer. So it was a bit confusing when the first time the West German captain touched the ball he was roundly booed by the crowd of 53,000. The locals were unable to set aside the fact Beckenbauer was the captain of Hamburg\u2019s biggest rivals, Bayern Munich. He inflamed the situation by appearing to spit at them; the booing grew louder. My uncle then got a huge cheer from the crowd for a particularly badly mistimed tackle on the Kaiser which earned him a yellow card.\n\n\n\nAustralia were 2-0 down at half-time to goals from Wolfgang Overath and Bernd Cullmann but the avalanche never came and Germany added only one more in the second period through M\u00fcller. Indeed for the final 20 minutes Australia enjoyed much more of the play and were unlucky not to score when Atti Abonyi hit a post.\n\n\n\nAustralia rounded off their first appearance in the World Cup finals with a 0-0 draw against Chile in the Olympiastadion in West Berlin.\n\n\n\nJimmy Mackay died in Melbourne 24 years after that never-to-be-forgotten June in West Germany. I like to think that the part he played in getting Australia get to the World Cup finals more than three decades ago helped establish the sport Down Under and has led to its current popularity, making Australia one of the favourites to host the 2018 or 2022 World Cup. He would have been a proud man.\n\n\n\nDuncan Mackay is the editor of insideworldfootball"}, {"url": "https://www.thecelticwiki.com/players/all-time-a-to-z-of-celtic-players/m/mackay-duncan/", "page_content": "Personal\n\nFullname: Duncan MacKay\n\naka: Dunky MacKay\n\nBorn: 14 July 1937\n\nDied: 23 December 2019\n\nBirthplace: Springburn\n\nSigned: 11 April 1955\n\nLeft: 6 November 1964 (Third Lanark)\n\nPosition: Right-back\n\nDebut: Clyde 1-4 Celtic, League Cup, 9 Aug 1958\n\nInternationals: Scotland\n\nInternational Caps: 14\n\nInternational Goals: 0\n\nBiog\n\nThe classy Duncan MacKay signed for Celtic from Maryhill Harp in April 1955.\n\nOn his signing, he was proclaimed as the find of the season, and for the next season was \u201cthe best defensive prospect in the country\u201c.\n\nThe stylish right-back made his debut in a 4-1 League Cup win at Clyde in August 1958 and would spend the next six years as one of the top performers in disappointing & underachieving Celtic sides.\n\nDuncan MacKay had fantastic pace and stamina and he was a wonderful attacking full-back who was one of the first players in that position to use the over-lap as a regular feature of his game.\n\nWith fine control and a pin-point accurate pass, Duncan MacKay would always attempt to play the ball out of defence rather than just rely on the long clearance up the park. He was not overly physical in his defending either, preferring to win the ball through quick thinking and anticipation rather than just brute strength. So in some ways he was ahead of his time.\n\nThis refined approach to the game made him a popular player among the Celtic support and the Scotland selectors who capped him 14 times.\n\nHe became the captain in 1961, and then led the first team to the Scottish Cup matches v Dunfermline (the final & replay), but in both unfortunately Celtic once again came up short and lost. The side were perennially underachieving despite the wealth of talent on hand.\n\nWith Celtic so poor, he actually decided openly to request a move to England, but there was surprisingly little interest (Celtic\u2019s poor state a likely major cause of the lack of interest). You have to take in the poor team management at the time at Celtic, lack of morale in the squad and the constant board meddling. It wasn\u2019t an uncommon position. Jimmy Johnstone, Billy McNeill and Lennox were all also on the verge of leaving or giving up before Jock Stein\u2019s arrival at Celtic.\n\nDuncan McKay lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill in 1963, and his place in the first team later in the year. His last game was a single appearance in the 1964/65 season with a 4-2 defeat to Hearts.\n\nHe was not a heavy goalscorer, but curiously once he scored his first the others soon enough followed. He took a long time to score his first for Celtic, a penalty in a 7-0 victory over St Mirren in November 1962. However, over April & May 1963, he scored five goals (all penalties), including a double over Raith Rovers in a Scottish Cup semi-final. His last goal (also a penalty) was in October 1963 as Celtic defeated Aberdeen 3-0.\n\nIt was a great injustice to Duncan McKay\u2019s wonderful ability that he never won any major trophies as a Celt. This popular player eventually left Parkhead in 1964 for Third Lanark after 236 appearances and 7 goals.\n\nThe saddest aspect is that he was a great player in one of the poorer eras for Celtic. After the League Cup win in 1957, Celtic did not win another major trophy again until 1965. His first team career sadly spanned practically the whole of this period. Jock Stein became the club manager only a few months after Duncan Mackay\u2019s departure. If Jock Stein had arrived sooner then possibly Duncan Mackay could have won a medal worthy of his talents.\n\nHe is one of the finest regular long-term first team Celtic players to leave Celtic without a medal for a major trophy (Willie Miller is another in this group). He deserved better, and it is an indictment of the club at the time for just how poor the First Team were.\n\nHowever, the Celtic support more then recognised his talent. In 1967, following the triumph in Lisbon in the European Cup, a poll by the Evening Times amongst its readers surveyed for the best Celtic team in living memory. To his credit, Duncan MacKay walked in at right-back. A great accolade and a mark of the respect the support had for him.\n\nAfter Third Lanark, he moved to Australia to play for various sides and then later to coach clubs there also, with a brief period back home in Scotland between 1972-74 when he was player-coach with Juniors St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHe passed away in December 2018, coincidentally just a few weeks after the passing of Ian Young who had succeeded him as the right-back at Celtic.\n\nPlaying Career\n\nAPPEARANCES LEAGUE SCOTTISH CUP LEAGUE CUP EUROPE TOTAL 1955-64 162 33 37 \u2013 236 Goals 5 2 0 \u2013 7\n\nHonours with Celtic\n\nnone\n\nPictures\n\nForums\n\nArticles\n\nDuncan MacKay Source: http://sesasport.com/?p=760 Duncan MacKay had a relatively short but stellar career with Celtic, racking up 236 games for the club from 1958 to 1964 and 14 Scottish caps in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He moved to Third Lanark in 1964 when Bill Hiddleston was engaged in the destruction of that club and in 1965 Frank Burin from the Croatia club in Melbourne persuaded him to try his luck in Australia. Mackay had an immediate impact on the club which had just been promoted to the Victorian State League, the top division. Croatia had been up and down between the State League and lower divisions over previous seasons but this time president Enver Begovic organised an open cheque-book approach that resulted in the expenditure of \u00a35000 in two months. Hammy McMeechan from Slavia was signed for a Victorian record fee of \u00a31200. Other newcomers were Joe Keenan, Ian Currie, Bobby McLachlan, Bill McIntyre and Brian Adlam. Croatia finished sixth in 1965. It was the \u2018Glamour Team\u2019 of the season, according to the Victorian Soccer Federation Yearbook. The early season form had been poor, six of the first seven games were lost, and it looked as if Croatia would go back down again, but the attraction of Duncan MacKay and the other players resulted in a transformation in the second half of the season when it finished with eleven wins. Croatia was also runner-up in the Dockerty Cup in 1965. The team which was to take Croatia to the top in Victoria and Australia was now in place. Croatia finished 6th in 1966, 3rd in 1967 under Jimmy Adam, and won the State League for the first time in 1968 under coach Mijo Kiss, finishing seven points clear of Polonia. Only four league games were lost all season. In addition, Croatia won the Ampol Cup and the Dockerty Cup, to complete an extraordinary triumph. In 1972 after an incident involving crowd trouble in a match against Hakoah, Croatia was suspended from the Victorian Soccer Federation and eventually refused permission to regain its position in the State League. It was not till 1974 that the Croatians took over Essendon Lions and resumed participation at a lower level. Duncan MacKay returned to Scotland in March 1972 and was player-coach at St Anthony\u2019s, but he came back to Australia to the Azzurri club in Western Australia in 1974 and in 1977 he returned to Melbourne with Essendon Lions as player-coach.\n\nDeath of Celtic great Duncan MacKay\n\nBy: Newsroom Staff on 26 Dec, 2019 11:31\n\nhttp://www.celticfc.net/news/17326\n\nEVERYONE at Celtic Football Club is saddened to hear of the death of former player, Duncan MacKay, who has passed away at the age of 82.\n\nDunky, who played for the Hoops between 1955-64, making 236 appearances and scoring seven goals, is rightly considered a Celtic great. His first-team debut came in August 1958, in a League Cup tie against Clyde at Shawfield, which Celtic won 4-1, and he soon established himself as first-choice right-back in the team.\n\nA highly-rated defender who was an early exponent of the attacking full-back role later honed by the likes of Tommy Gemmell and Jim Craig, Dunky MacKay was a firm fans\u2019 favourite and his leadership qualities were identified by Jimmy McGrory, who made him captain in 1961, succeeding Bertie Peacock as skipper.\n\nHe would later pass on the captain\u2019s armband to Billy McNeill for the start of the 1963/64 season.\n\nIn November 1984, he moved to Third Lanark, before heading out to Australia where he would eventually settle after a brief return to Scotland.

He insisted the young Duncan wore his Mackay tartan kilt every day. But getting into schoolyard scrapes when responding to taunts of \u201cKiltie, kiltie cauld-bum\u201d began to wear thin with the youngster, and he persuaded his parents to get him into long trousers.\n\nAt St Columba\u2019s High his exceptional skill with a football got him noticed. He moved to St Mary\u2019s Boys\u2019 Guild, where Celtic signed him on a provisional form, farming him out to juniors, Maryhill Harp. By now the teenaged Mackay had seen the great Hungarian side of Ferenc Puskas and the sort of attacking football he wanted to play. He had left school and started an apprenticeship as a marine engineer.\n\nHe turned full-time at Celtic after completing his apprenticeship. During the 1958-59 campaign he made the first of his 236 first-team appearances in a League Cup tie against Clyde. By season\u2019s end he was first choice, and an Under-23 cap. On April 11, 1959, aged 21, he made the first of an eventual 14 appearances for Scotland, against England at Wembley.\n\nHis full-back partner that day was Rangers\u2019 Eric Caldow and the pair hit it off immediately. Indeed, they played together 12 times for Scotland, making Mackay Caldow\u2019s most frequent international partner. Caldow would relate how, as Scotland captain, he once distributed \u2018fan mail\u2019 when the national squad was training at Largs; finding one addressed to \u201cDonkey Mackay\u2019 he quipped, \u201cThis lassie must have seen you playing, Dunky\u201d. In reality, Caldow, rated his Celtic friend very highly as a player.\n\nBut, if things were going well with Scotland, all was not well at Celtic Park, where, following the 1957 League Cup win, the side struggled to compete with Rangers, Kilmarnock and Hearts, then the top teams. Bertie Peacock left the club and Mackay was appointed team captain in 1960, leading them to the Scottish Cup final of 1961, where they lost to Dunfermline after a replay. Indeed, along with 1940s goalkeeper Willie Miller, Mackay shares the \u201cdistinction\u201d of having won more Scotland caps than medals as a Celtic player.\n\nIn 1963 he lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill, then, after injury he lost his first-team place, partly because, it is rumoured, manager Jimmy McGrory and chairman Bob Kelly, who picked the side, did not like Mackay\u2019s attacking sorties up the wing.\n\nIn November, 1964, he left Celtic for Third Lanark. This is one of Scottish football\u2019s great \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d; maybe, had he hung on until Jock Stein returned in February, 1965, he would have regained his place. Stein certainly preferred attacking full-backs. But Thirds were starting to implode and at the end of that season, Mackay joined Melbourne Croatia, who were spending big in a bid to become the top side in the Victoria League.\n\nHe was an instant success, being appointed captain and winning the Player of the Year title in his first season. He led Croatia to several trophies, including a league-and-two-cups treble in 1972, but the club fell foul of Australian Soccer financial rules and collapsed. Mackay returned to Scotland for two seasons, working as a bookbinder and coaching junior outfit St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHis first marriage, when a young man, had failed. But while, back home, he married his second wife, Marilyn, before, in 1974, Perth Azzurri, in Western Australia, offered him a player-coach role.\n\nHe led the Azzurri to back-to-back league titles, then returned to Melbourne, to Essendon Lions, as Croatia had now become. Here he found success as a league-winning coach, before winding down his active involvement in football with South Melbourne Hellas.\n\nMelbourne clearly suited Mackay. In his first spell with Croatia, he turned down the chance to join Pele at New York Cosmos. His non-football working life turned full circle when he joined Transfeld Ship Builders as a Senior Procurement Buyer \u2013 the post he filled until his retirement.\n\nHe and Marilyn, who survives him, had two daughters, Shone and Elissa. He is also survived by son Duncan Junior, from his first marriage, who also lives in Australia. Paul, another son from that first marriage predeceased his father. In retirement, Mackay enjoyed listening to the Beatles, Barbra Streisand and Tony Bennett.\n\nDunky Mackay was a very good full-back. He was Celtic\u2019s Player of the Year in 1963, and Man of the Match when they played Real Madrid at Parkhead in a friendly. Sadly, he never had the medals to show for playing at a low point in the club\u2019s history, but on the other side of the world he finally won a few medals, forged a good reputation as a coach, and perhaps showed Scottish football what it lost when it allowed him to leave.\n\nMATT VALLANCE"}, {"url": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5105150/ex-celtic-duncan-mackay-died-82/", "page_content": "FORMER Celtic player Duncan MacKay has passed away aged 82.\n\nThe former right-back made 236 appearances in green and white after making his Hoops first-team debut in 1958.\n\n1 Celtic have confirmed former player Duncan MacKay has died Credit: PA:Press Association\n\nMacKay, who had came through the ranks, went on to establish himself as a first-team player.\n\nHe was made club captain in 1961 before handing over the armband to Celts legend Billy McNeill in 1963.\n\nCeltic confirmed the news in a statement, writing: \"Everyone at Celtic Football Club is saddened to hear of the death of former player, Duncan MacKay, who has passed away at the age of 82.\n\n\"Dunky, who played for the Hoops between 1955-64, making 236 appearances and scoring seven goals, is rightly considered a Celtic great.\n\n\"His first-team debut came in August 1958, in a League Cup tie against Clyde at Shawfield, which Celtic won 4-1, and he soon established himself as first-choice right-back in the team.\n\n\"A highly-rated defender who was an early exponent of the attacking full-back role later honed by the likes of Tommy Gemmell and Jim Craig, Dunky MacKay was a firm fans\u2019 favourite and his leadership qualities were identified by Jimmy McGrory, who made him captain in 1961, succeeding Bertie Peacock as skipper.\n\n\"He would later pass on the captain\u2019s armband to Billy McNeill for the start of the 1963/64 season.\n\n\"In November 1964, he moved to Third Lanark, before heading out to Australia where he would eventually settle after a brief return to Scotland.

And while a member of those bands, at the same time he remained one of the most in-demand session musicians, participating in recordings by The Alan Parsons Project, Kate Bush, Camel, Budgie , and others. As unbelievable as it is, all three of these musicians are one and the same.\n\nThe man in question? The understated legend Duncan Mackay .\n\nNot only does Mackay\u2019s story incorporate that of the \u201cthree musicians,\u201d but he also moved to become an accomplished composer, delving into library music and soundtracking. And after focusing on composing for several years, Mackay decided to harken back to his progressive roots through a liaison with the Japanese label, Belle Antique.\n\nThat particular rabbit hole led Mackay to the most recent and exciting footnote in his celebrated career, Fluance , a band that\u2019s pitched a fresh take on a familiar sound, and one which both challenges and comforts the listener in one fell swoop.\n\nFluance is set to release their second album shortly, but in the meantime, you can get your fix listening to their first release, Lunacy.\n\nOne fine afternoon, from his home studio in South Africa, Mackay took the time to sit down with me via Zoom for an exclusive, career-spanning chat.\n\nJoe:\n\nFrom what I understand you initially studied violin in school. What drew you to focus more on the organ, keyboards, and other key-based instruments?\n\nDuncan:\n\nWell, I was very fortunate that my late father was a fabulous musician. He was a great violinist which is why the violin was the instrument that I went and did my music degree for. When I was at university, it was obligatory that your second instrument was keyboard based. I chose to do church organ as my second instrument. It was absolutely great. That\u2019s where I really honed my bass pedal playing. It was quite good at one time in my life. When I got my degree, I taught music for six months and realized that that was not what I wanted to do in my life. I just started playing around with keyboards, and I managed to get my first Hammond organ.\n\nThe way I was playing at that time was more from the jazz side. Jimmy Smith type Jazz, rather than traditional Jazz. I started getting noticed playing organ in that nontraditional Jazz style. In fact, that\u2019s how I ended up in Brazil at the age of 20. That all started when I met a fabulous guitarist by the name of Rosinha de Valen\u00e7a. She was in town playing with her band, but she also played with Sergio Mendes. She and I got on, and to cut the story short, their keyboard player had other things to do with his life. So, she said, \u201cWould you like to come to Rio de Janeiro and play with the rest of the chaps?\u201d I quickly resigned from my teaching job, and I was on the next plane to Brazil.\n\nJoe:\n\nSpeaking of your experience in Brazil, what effect did playing in the Sergio Mendes Band have on you as a young musician?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI think the experiences, as can happen when you\u2019re younger, are a natural chain of events that come about through a combination of chance and skill. I took it on board, and I got on with it. When I got a little older and was able to look back, I realized that was actually very important. At the time, it was just an adventure. Going to Rio. Holy shit, what a great place. Musically, I really learned rhythms from those guys. They were fantastic with rhythm. Rhythm is so important in music from Brazil.\n\nJoe:\n\nHow did the experience come to an end?\n\nDuncan:\n\nA chain of events led to the end of that experience. I can tell you I was lock-stock-and-barrel when I went over there. I shipped my prized possession, my Hammond organ, over to Rio. Unfortunately, some corruption in customs gave me trouble. Someone decided they liked my Hammond, and they didn\u2019t want to let it out of customs. I said, \u201cWell, send it back.\u201d They said, \u201cNo, no, no. You can\u2019t send it back unless you leave with it.\u201d So, wrongly, or rightly, I left with my Hammond, which was my most important possession at that age. I think I was over there for six months. It was a great time in my life.\n\nJoe:\n\nHow did you get into the prog rock scene?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI came back to South Africa by which time I\u2019d become aware of Keith Emerson. I think he was playing with The Nice in those days. What he was doing fit in with everything that I was writing. Keith was a big inspiration for the way I played in my early days. I love what he got up to. He was the first keyboard showman. There were plenty of guitarists chucking their guitars around, standing on monitors, a smashing up Marshall speakers. Normally, the keyboard player was somewhere in the background. Emerson stepped out and said, \u201cI\u2019m not doing that.\u201d I loved him for it, and of course, he was an extraordinary player.\n\nAll images courtesy of Duncan Mackay/Getty Images\n\nJoe:\n\nWhat sort of influence did Keith Emerson have on your playing and musical direction of your first solo album, Chimera?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI have always strived to be original in my career. Of course, you can\u2019t help but be influenced by outside things. Emerson was a big influence, and I enjoyed what he got up to for a lot of reasons. Back then \u2013 we\u2019re talking early 70s \u2013 there was one great thing about the music world. If your technique, playing, and imagination were bigger than the next guy, you were more likely to get the job. If you were also a good player and you practiced hard, then you could start going towards the virtuosity that Emerson had.\n\nJoe:\n\nThe attributes you mentioned: imagination, technique, and originality, were on full display on Chimera. Tell us about how the album came together.\n\nDuncan:\n\nIt was a massive stepping-stone. At that time, I was playing a multitude of keyboards, which included playing bass pedals with my feet. I was working with a fabulous drummer called Mike Gray. We were playing in a club several nights a week. Then we were offered an album deal. All of that meant that we were packing up all the gear every morning, at the club, and putting it in my van. Then we would drive into the recording studio, unload it, and record all day. Afterward, we would pack it up and put it back in the van. Then drive back to the club, set up all the gear, and play all night. Recording-wise, that was almost live. The whole album, the basic tracks anyway, were done in three days. That is unheard of nowadays. There were a couple of overdubs over a couple of days. We went in to sing a bit and do a few other things as well. But that was pretty much it. I look back at it now and wonder how the bloody hell that happened. [Laughs]. At the time, my knowledge of what was meant to happen in the studio was zero. It wasn\u2019t extraordinary, it was simply what we did. The whole process was part of what made the Chimera album special. Recording those songs all day and playing them every night.\n\nJoe:\n\nWhat part, if any, did Chimera have on enabling you to garner the amount of work you would come into shortly following its release?\n\nDuncan:\n\nSo, the club where we played was called The Branch Office. It instantly became a hub for other musicians. It was the only club around that didn\u2019t have a dance floor. People just came and sat and listened. When all the other musicians playing in other clubs finished playing at midnight, they would come over. It always turned into a jam session. It was very good times. One of the chaps who was visiting at the time was Peter Knight Jr. He was the head of Phonogram International. I felt I was coming to the end of the club thing. We hit the highs there. My plan was always to return to England. A couple of weeks later, I got a call from Peter, and said, \u201cGinger Baker and Adrian Gurvitz are starting a new band. They\u2019ve heard Chimera. I\u2019ve told them how you play. Would you like to join?\u201d I was a fan of Cream, and Ginger Baker was a hero of mine. Ginger was right up there, blimey. I got the call on a Saturday morning, and that same night I got on a plane to England. I showed up there and I started with Ginger Baker and Adrian Gurvitz. I believe the group was to be called The Baker-Gurvitz Army. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t work out. I\u2019ve met a lot of people in the music business. All types and levels of importance. Ginger Baker is right up there with one of the most unpleasant people I\u2019ve ever met. [Laughs].\n\nJoe:\n\nAt that point, you stayed in England to look for a gig that was a better fit, right? What led you to join Cockney Rebel?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI went to Peter Knight Jr., with who I\u2019d become friends, and was now back in London. I went to him, and I said, \u201cLook, I appreciate everything, but I can\u2019t do this.\u201d It was a difficult decision, but Peter was very helpful. I looked around and ended up meeting two great chaps. Jon Hiseman, from Colosseum , and Gary Moore, the guitarist. They were starting a band called Colosseum II. After I met them, I started rehearsing with them. It was fantastic. Nice people. Unbelievable players. But they were broke and didn\u2019t have any record company support. I was broke too, like most musicians, and needed a paying gig. Suddenly, the Cockney Rebel gig was offered to me. Initially, I auditioned with Steve Harley, and I didn\u2019t get the gig. Then, for some reason, I got called back for a second audition. By this time Jim Cregan was the guitarist in the band, and Jim said to Harley, \u201cYou got to get this guy,\u201d and I joined Cockney Rebel.\n\nJoe:\n\nCockney Rebel had some decent success and exposure in the U.K., including a number one hit. Why do you feel the band wasn\u2019t able to duplicate that same feat in The States?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI don\u2019t know. We did a tour of the states, which I enjoyed immensely. During the tour, we were supported by The Kinks. It all seemed to go down well. I wish I had a more definitive answer. Back then the business side of music wasn\u2019t at the forefront of my mind. I was playing music with a bunch of great guys and having fun. The politics and that side of music hadn\u2019t gotten their hooks into me yet. I look back on those times, by the way, Joe, with happiness. The business side of music isn\u2019t always something to be proud of. I understand it\u2019s got to be there, but it\u2019s got very little to do with actual music.\n\nAt that time, at least, the record companies were more apt to recognize a band for what it was and where it can progress to. It was not uncommon for a band to sign a three or four-album deal. The idea was the power of the record company would help the artist financially to make those three or four albums. Help them grow. That doesn\u2019t happen anymore.\n\nHowever, going back to your question, I don\u2019t think Steve [Harley] helped himself with his attitude. He was very arrogant and abrasive, which he got away with in the U.K. In hindsight, I think that had something to do with it. When he decided that he didn\u2019t need Cockney Rebel anymore, which was an enormous mistake, I stayed on as his right-hand man. He [Steve Harley] never did crack America, as you know.\n\nImage credit: Dick Barnatt/Redferns\n\nJoe:\n\nIt seemed like Cockney Rebel was getting stronger with each album. Can you provide any insight into the sequence of events that led to the eventual disbanding?\n\nDuncan:\n\nWhen we made that first album with \u201cMake Me Smile (Come Up and See Me),\u201d there was no doubt that Jim Cregan and I were very much part of the writing team. It became very apparent that Steve wasn\u2019t at all prepared to acknowledge that in terms of songwriting credits. Any future would have just been, \u201cHere\u2019s some money come and play,\u201d or \u201cCan I use your knowledge and expertise to make my next song?\u201d We all got a bit fed up with it. Jim left first and went off to join Rod Stewart.\n\nJoe:\n\nThat\u2019s kind of similar to what happened with the first iteration of the band.\n\nDuncan:\n\nThat\u2019s right. Steve Harley has done it all his life. The proof of what we\u2019re talking about is in the result. Since the Cockney Rebel that I was in, since we all stopped working together, there hasn\u2019t been a hit. It\u2019s really silly. I\u2019d personally rather have 50% of something than 100% of nothing.\n\nJoe:\n\nA handful of years ago you took part in a Cockney Rebel anniversary tour with most of the classic lineup intact. What was the impetus for that tour?\n\nDuncan:\n\nWell, that was Steve\u2019s [Harley] idea. I have been in some contact with Jim [Cregan] and Stuart Elliot, the original drummer, over the years. Stuart and I are good friends. When we talked about putting together a reunion to celebrate The Best Years of Our Lives, I thought, \u201cThat will be great fun to relive the camaraderie that we had in those beginning years.\u201d The band was all good mates. It was fabulous. So, I agreed to do it. I went back over to the U.K. for the tour. I enjoyed working with Jim, Stuart, and Steve\u2019s bass player at the time was a guy called Marty Prior. He toured with us and is also the bass player in Fluance. I ended up meeting all the other people from Fluance through Marty.\n\nJoe:\n\nWhat was the experience like of working with that group of guys again after all those years?\n\nDuncan:\n\nIt was terrific to play those old songs, but the tour ended up being all about Steve. Steve was still the prima donna that he always was, but now to an even greater extent. That\u2019s me being very polite. Despite all that, we had a great time. We did 23 dates, or something like that, and played to 3000 people a night. It was fabulous and very humbling to see people of our age coming to revisit their youth. It was amazing to see how important Rebel and those songs had been in their lives. I\u2019ve got goosebumps just thinking about it. I enjoyed that part of it a lot.\n\nJoe:\n\nYour second solo album, Score had some notable differences from Chimera. The psychedelic nature and frenetic pace of Chimera were replaced with jazzier sounds and a more melodic tempo. How did working with Steve Harley, and John Wetton\u2019s production inform your approach?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI think you hit the nail on the head with everything you said. I was now living in the U.K. and had different influences. And that\u2019s the way the record went. EMI was a big company and there were elements added to try to make it more accessible than Chimera. But there never has been a set plan going into an album. It\u2019s gonna go the way it goes naturally as I start writing. I mean, there\u2019s a fake plan, of course. [Laughs]. That\u2019s the lovely thing about going into the studio, you can go in the morning thinking, \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d and then you start fiddling around with this sound and that sound. You don\u2019t go in a completely different direction, but certainly with a different flavor. I love that, especially when mistakes in the studio stay on the record. Sometimes those mistakes are bloody brilliant. I find getting it clinically correct, which an awful lot of music is today, somehow sucks the soul out of it.\n\nJoe:\n\nOne of the most exciting opportunities you had was working with The Alan Parsons Project on three of their albums towards the beginning of their career. You first met Alan as a producer for Cockyney Rebel, right? What was that experience like and what did you take away from it?\n\nDuncan:\n\nThat\u2019s correct. So, there was Alan and Andrew Powell, who was Alan Parsons\u2019s orchestrator. He was a great classical orchestrator. I first met them while recording with Rebel. I got on really well with Alan Parsons. I learned so much from that man through his approach in the studio. He invited me and Stuart Elliott, the drummer from Cockney Rebel, as well as Ian Bairnson and David Paton from Pilot to record on several projects. The four of us became the nucleus for an awful lot of other people\u2019s records. If the four of us had been in a band together, it would have worked because we played well together. It wasn\u2019t the same as getting your average four-session guys to come and play drums, bass, guitar, and keyboards. Events unfolded and we just ended up doing the Parsons album. Then Andrew Powell got the job producing the first Kate Bush album and the same four chaps got pulled in to do that album. We became a team. When we weren\u2019t working with either rebel or pilot, and we had time down, then people would normally knock on the door. They would say, \u201cCan you guys come be the band for our album?\u201d It was all great fun, especially the Parsons Project. It [The Alan Parsons Project] was always innovative and adventurous.\n\nAll images courtesy of Duncan Mackay/Getty Images\n\nJoe:\n\nYou started to mention Kate Bush. What was it like to work with her at the beginning of her career?\n\nDuncan:\n\nKate was fantastic and delightful. She was unbelievably humble and sweet. She was extremely talented. I loved her songs, writing, and piano playing. She played a great piano. When we went to record Kate\u2019s first album, we all turned up, the four of us [Duncan Mackay, Stuart Elliott, Ian Bairnson, and David Paton]. We hadn\u2019t seen each other for a little while and we had gotten there early. So, we were chatting and catching up. That\u2019s when a funny little incident happened that describes Kate to a tee. This young lady comes into where we are sitting and says, \u201cWould anybody like a cup of tea?\u201d We all said, \u201cYes, thank you very much. That\u2019d be lovely.\u201d Off she went to get us our tea, and then Andrew Powell turned up. He was a bit late. When he came in, what we thought was the tea girl was beside him. He said, \u201cHave you met Kate yet?\u201d [Laughs]. Then we got to work.\n\nJoe:\n\nBy Kate\u2019s third album, Never For Ever, the studio nucleus surrounding the first two albums was mostly not involved. However, you stayed on to work with her on the album for a few tracks. What led to the change in personnel?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI may be wrong, but I think Stuart Elliott was also there. There were other people around that I didn\u2019t know so well. But Joe, that wasn\u2019t such a big deal, I thought \u201cOkay, there are other people around and that was fine.\u201d Around that time, she started to play live, and different people were part of her live outfit. It made sense to include those people in the studio. It was just a chain of events.\n\nJoe:\n\nDavid Gilmore had a role as an executive producer on Kate Bush\u2019s first album, The Kick Inside. Did you ever work with him in any capacity in the studio during the album?\n\nDuncan:\n\nNot so much, Joe. As far as I remember, heads would pop in, and people would talk, etc., but I don\u2019t remember specifically dealing with him. I know the story about how Kate got the EMI deal in the first place, which was through him. He\u2019d heard her somewhere and knew she was one to watch. And boy, was he right. But his involvement in the album, if my memory serves me right, wasn\u2019t enormous. Maybe behind the scenes, it was enormous.\n\nJoe:\n\nAnother band that, like Cockney Rebel, was going through a transitionary period when you joined was 10cc. How did it compare to when you joined Cockney Rebel?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI\u2019ve been very fortunate in both bands I\u2019ve been a member of. Fortunate because the chaps in the band we\u2019re good guys, which is unbelievably vital to any band. It is certainly vital to any band I want to be with. When I was with Rebel, we worked very hard, and we played hard. It was a very good time to be in the game. I had much the same experience with 10cc. 10cc had a different approach in that it was run like the military without the strict bit and certainly not the haircuts. [Laughs]. When we said 9 am in the studio to record, that meant 9 am. Musically, it was fantastic because everybody was always experimenting with different approaches and styles. The live shows were always fantastic with that band, and we were renowned for always having a very good sound. That\u2019s because of the time, the effort, and the thought that went into getting that level of sound. Our sound engineer, who mixed the live sound, was treated almost like a member of the band. That\u2019s how important he was to us. It all just worked well. Great players, great music. I was so fortunate that both bands I joined, Cockney Rebel and 10cc, had hits that went to number one with \u201cCome Up and See Me,\u201d and \u201cDreadlock Holiday.\u201d\n\nJoe:\n\nWas there anything in particular that pulled 10cc towards the ska and reggae sounds that were incorporated on both \u201cDreadlock Holiday\u201d and other songs on Bloody Tourists?\n\nDuncan:\n\nThe reason that I enjoyed 10cc from day one was the way the music would evolve and transpire. We never sat down and said, \u201cHey, let\u2019s do a reggae song, or let\u2019s specifically take the direction we did end up taking on \u2018Dreadlock Holiday.\u2019\u201d As far as I remember, it was just, we\u2019re going to do a song, and this is how it\u2019s progressing. It wasn\u2019t a whole preconceived idea. I don\u2019t think Eric [Stewart] and Graham [Gouldman] expected it to ever become the monster hit it turned into. I think the enormous success of that track took us all by surprise, at least a little bit.\n\nAll images courtesy of Duncan Mackay/Getty Images\n\nJoe:\n\nLet\u2019s backtrack for a minute and discuss how you ended up becoming a member of 10cc in the first place.\n\nDuncan:\n\nIt was New Year\u2019s Eve, and a mate of mine was throwing a party. This mate was a rather famous photographer. He used to throw a party every year to thank all the models, agencies, and other people he worked with. He asked, \u201cDo you want to put together a little scratch band and come play the New Year party?\u201d I went, \u201cYeah, why not?\u201d I remember lugging my Hammond up the stairs and helping set everything up. We started playing and one of the chaps who turned up was Rick Fenn, the guitarist from 10cc. We had a spare amp and Rick plugged in and jammed with us. We had great fun and eventually said our goodbyes. Later on, the next week, he phoned up and said, \u201cDo you want to come meet the band? I\u2019m in 10cc. We\u2019re looking for a keyboard player.\u201d I hit it off with the guys in the band. They had just started recording the Bloody Tourist album. I was able to slot in rather nicely, right at the beginning of that album. That\u2019s how that happened. It was a shame it didn\u2019t carry on longer.\n\nJoe:\n\nWhat were the circumstances that led to you parting ways with 10cc sometime after Look Here?\n\nDuncan:\n\nWe were in the middle of a world tour. We had just come back from America, and we had Christmas off. We had two weeks and then we were on our way to Australia and Japan. In that interim Eric [Stewart] had a terrible car crash on black ice. The car crash turned into a disaster for the band as Eric was injured quite badly. Some decisions were made by management that were silly. Then we did the Look Here? album, which was a very different experience from making Bloody Tourists. Things seemed to diminish from there to a point where I had to make the hard decision to move on.\n\nJoe:\n\nI wanted to touch on Budgie. I\u2019d say that Budgie was very different from many other artists you had worked with to that point. While Budgie had begun to experiment with various sounds, Deliver Us From Evil was certainly a divergence for the band. Where was the band both creatively and musically at the time, and what were the circumstances that led to you being involved in the album?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI don\u2019t know definitively, but I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019d heard some of my other work. Based on what they heard, they thought that I could help in with the direction they were looking to go in. My knowledge of them as a band, before I turned up in the studio, was limited. I knew of them, but I hadn\u2019t heard lots of their music. I had no idea what I was turning up for. In many ways, that aspect was no different from many of the other experiences I have had. People wanted me to play with them because of my style, which was a lot different than many of my contemporaries. Whatever I brought to the party, it was what they were looking for.\n\nJoe:\n\nWere you given full creative control over the keyboard parts, or were you considered more of a hired gun?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI have never been the hired gun, ever. It\u2019s not me being arrogant but simply the way my career has gone. People would ask me to play on an album because they liked how I played. I can only say this in hindsight but there really were no expectations. I was booked to do an album in this residential studio with Budgie. I turned up and it was great. I got to meet some nice guys and play some music. That\u2019s kind of how I went into it.\n\nJoe:\n\nGiven this was Budgie\u2019s first album to significantly feature the keyboards, what were the expectations set forth going into the studio?\n\nDuncan:\n\nYou should also understand that there are things I turned down. I remember one band, who I won\u2019t mention, had their management phone me up. They said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking for someone who plays piano like Jerry Lee Lewis.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, don\u2019t speak to me because I don\u2019t play anything like that. It\u2019s not how I play. So, thank you, but no thank you.\u201d I play how I play, and it seems to have worked rather well.\n\nJoe:\n\nIn the 70s through the early 80s, you were on a torrid recording pace. How did you find the time to record your solo music while also being a member of Cockney Rebel, as well as 10cc, and work as a session musician?\n\nDuncan:\n\nIt was my extreme, complete, and dedicated focus on playing and making music. I loved every second of it. None of it seemed like work. It was all, \u201cYeah, brilliant. Fancy that. Let\u2019s have a go.\u201d The timing of it all played into it as well. It was a different era in rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, progressive music, or whatever you want to call it. It was more adventurous, and people were taking a lot more risks than they do now. That all benefited me as a musician. I\u2019m delighted that I was able to work so extensively during that era and for it to have brought forth so many highlights from my career. It was an era where the music business seemed to be run more by music than business. I\u2019m sure that may not fully be an accurate statement, but those are my feelings regarding the music business. I\u2019m not moaning. It\u2019s changed. The world changed. Life changed. It is what it is.\n\nJoe:\n\nIt\u2019s certainly important to touch on Visa. I see it as a nod to much of your later work in library music and soundtracks. You mentioned that much of your music tends to develop organically in the studio, however, what inspired you to take the direction you developed on Visa?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI know what I said earlier about how I record but, Visa was the exception. I\u2019ve always been a tunesmith. Tunes have always just come to me. I love a good tune and that is probably based on my classical training. Mozart and Beethoven wrote great tunes and that\u2019s why we still know them hundreds of years later. In the Chimera days and subsequent albums, virtuosity was part of the writing thing there. When I did Visa, I thought, \u201cLet\u2019s explore this being a tunesmith idea, but keep some technique and a put bit of flash in it.\u201d Plus, I had just recently acquired some sequencers and other new equipment. It was an experiment and probably a bit more contrived than some of my other works. It was a different direction for sure. I had built my first ever studio and that was my first attempt at recording there. That was the path that Visa went down. It was an experiment, and it was exciting.\n\nAll images courtesy of Duncan Mackay/Getty Images\n\nJoe:\n\nWith Greg McEwan Kocovaos, you recorded The First Time. The two of you were seamlessly able to blend new wave/art rock sounds with more modern electronic and world music flavors. I was able to listen to the album on SoundCloud, but not much else is out there about the album.\n\nDuncan:\n\nTo tell you the truth, I had no idea it was available anywhere. [Laughs]. It was a great plan, but it didn\u2019t work out. If you want to work with me, committing to something is a prerequisite lesson. If I\u2019m going to put all my energy into something, I expect it from the other people I\u2019m working with as well. In my book, it\u2019s not too much to expect. It\u2019s a prerequisite for making good music and getting it somewhere. It didn\u2019t work out and it was a shame. The way it was going, it became obvious to me towards the end of making the album that it wasn\u2019t going to work out. So, I made the album and moved on. This has happened to me a few times. I\u2019ve gone down a path with someone who has said all the right words at the beginning about commitment and didn\u2019t follow through.\n\nYou know, people say musicians just go on stage and they work for two hours a day, \u201cLucky them.\u201d All the good musicians do much more. They just live it. You need to say, \u201cLook, I have no idea if this is gonna be successful. I have no idea if it\u2019s gonna make a dollar or a million dollars. But I\u2019m going into it with 100%.\u201d Otherwise, why bother? That\u2019s been my attitude to this game all my life. That happened with Greg, and it unfortunately also happened with the Bletchley Park Project. The projects that didn\u2019t work out always cause me to look back on my time with both Rebel and 10 CC with gratitude. Gratitude because all the people in those bands were so like-minded about what we were up to, and generally good chaps. That is vital for me. I can\u2019t work with someone who I haven\u2019t got any respect. I don\u2019t care how talented they are. Is the plan to be heart-and-soul 100%? Then off we go. That\u2019s the truth. Thank you for even knowing about it.\n\nJoe:\n\nYou mentioned the Bletchley Park Project. I wanted to discuss both that album and Kintsugi. What made you return to your 70s prog rock-styled musical approach, and how did you end up on the Japanese label, Belle Antique?\n\nDuncan:\n\nHow that came about was out of the blue. I got a request from a Japanese prog magazine to do an interview. My interview was featured in this magazine, and soon after I got a call from Belle Antique Records. They said, \u201cWould you be interested in doing a prog album.\u201d I\u2019ve done a lot of commercial things, as we\u2019ve talked about, but there is nothing like being inventive. Progressive music allows you to do that. \u201cProgressive\u201d means you experiment, and you go into places you wouldn\u2019t otherwise. So, I told them I would be glad to work on something with them. At the time, I already working on something with a drummer and that evolved into the Bletchley Park Project album.\n\nJoe:\n\nI know you also write and record library music. For those ignorant of the process, what is your approach to writing library music?\n\nDuncan:\n\nWell, library music started for me back in when I was still in the U.K. I became friends with people at KPM records, which was an affiliate of EMI. I started doing library music for them and it worked well for me, because, as I said, I\u2019m a bit of a tunesmith. With library music, they give you a kind of theme. They say, \u201cThis is going to be about industry,\u201d so you know it\u2019s gonna have to be powerful. Or they say, \u201cThis is going to be pastoral,\u201d so you think countryside and your tunes to go off in different directions from there. Once you have enough tunes, you end up with a library album that is suitable for your theme. I found that I was alright at that, and they liked what I was doing.\n\nJoe:\n\nHow did you get into soundtracking documentaries and TV shows? How is the approach taken for a soundtrack different?\n\nDuncan:\n\nConsequently, from the success with library music, came the commissions for film. The difference with writing for films and the like is that instead of an overall theme, you\u2019ve got a rough cut of the visuals or a storyboard. It enables you to fine-tune your work. The music is there to enhance the story not to take over. A perfect example is Jaws. Without the Jaws music, it\u2019s just somebody going for a swim on a beach. Pretty boring [imitates person snoring]. Because you hear that music [starts humming Jaws theme] you anticipate something exciting and awful is gonna happen. It\u2019s fabulous when music can do that. That\u2019s how I see music, whether it\u2019s rock \u2018n\u2019 roll or music for films. Is it making you feel something? What\u2019s it meant to do? If you can achieve a little bit of that you\u2019re winning.\n\nAll images courtesy of Duncan Mackay/Getty Images\n\nJoe:\n\nTell me a little about your studio.\n\nDuncan:\n\nThe studio has grown in importance for me as my life has changed from touring and all that to what I do now. My wife and I designed and built the studio in our house. I spent a lot of time in the studio, It\u2019s heaven.\n\nJoe:\n\nDo you only record your work, or others as well? If you do record others, are you involved as a producer, engineer, etc.?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI made a point to get into recording others in the studio because the opportunity is there. In this era, everybody I meet is a record producer or an engineer. I feel like it used to be quite an exclusive club, and I respect that. So, in 1,000 years I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m an engineer or a producer if I\u2019m being truthful. Yes, I am both, but that\u2019s not where I hang my hat. However, over the years, I\u2019ve learned some things. I\u2019m pretty good at pressing the buttons, I suppose. The whole point since I had my first eight-track studio \u2018til now, is that it enables me to create the music that\u2019s in my head or somebody else\u2019s head. It\u2019s a tool to create, hopefully, what everybody wants to hear. That\u2019s how I see my studio.\n\nJoe:\n\nAll of that aside, Duncan, what have you been up to in the past couple of years considering the current state of the world? Is Fluance a major point of focus?\n\nDuncan:\n\nYes. I\u2019ve been concentrating a lot on Fluance, which is the band that did Lunacy. When we brought out the Lunacy album, we dealt with Belle Antique because I\u2019ve got a deal with them. And they liked what I did in Japan. So, we were already getting ready for me to travel from Cape Town and Marty [Prior], the bass player, to travel from Spain to rehearse. Then hopefully go out and promote the album. Then, of course, the pandemic hits. So that all went out the window. It is a difficult time for everybody in any profession in the world, especially musicians. COVID and Brexit have completely screwed how musicians make money. It put a stop to things, with Fluance, for some time. There was nowhere to play because it was all closed down. The timing of the first album from Fluance was unfortunate. I said to the chaps, \u201cAll we can do in this time is use the time to create the best album we possibly can.\u201d So, we\u2019re getting to the end of completing the recording of it. That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019ve been doing in these strange times.\n\nJoe:\n\nSounds like you have been keeping yourself busy working on this new Fluance album. What can you tell us about it?\n\nDuncan:\n\nIt is 90% recorded. We have just in recent months found a new permanent guitarist. A guy called Mauritz Lotz. He lives in Johannesburg. It\u2019s funny, I\u2019ve been living in Cape Town for a long time now and I just discovered him. He is fitting in with the band rather well. He is in the process of putting some guitar on the tracks that we\u2019ve done. Then we sit down and decide where we go from there.\n\nJoe:\n\nAny other projects coming out in the future we should be aware of?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI\u2019m in the process of writing music for a movie that is coming out. It\u2019s from a South African film director and producer. He\u2019s planning to start shooting later this year. It has a wondrous title, Drunks Have Whiter Teeth. I\u2019ve been writing music for that when I\u2019m not working with Fluance.\n\n\u2013 Joe O\u2019Brien (@ JoeOB1005 ) is the Senior Columnist for www.vwmusicrocks.com and may be reached at joe@vinylwriter.com"}, {"url": "https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11787/11895223/former-celtic-captain-duncan-mackay-dies-aged-82", "page_content": "Celtic have announced the death of former captain Duncan MacKay at the age of 82.\n\nThe right-back made 236 appearances for the Hoops between 1955-64, making his debut in a League Cup game against Clyde at Shawfield in August 1958.\n\nHe was then made skipper by Jimmy McGrory in 1961 before passing on the armband to Billy McNeill two seasons later.\n\nFormer Scotland international MacKay later moved to Third Lanark in 1964 and subsequently had spells with Australian clubs Melbourne Croatia and Perth Azzurri.\n\nCeltic announced the news in a statement on their official website which read: \"Everyone at Celtic Football Club is saddened to hear of the death of former player, Duncan MacKay, who has passed away at the age of 82.\n\n\"Dunky, who played for the Hoops between 1955-64, making 236 appearances and scoring seven goals, is rightly considered a Celtic great.\n\n\"His first-team debut came in August 1958, in a League Cup tie against Clyde at Shawfield, which Celtic won 4-1, and he soon established himself as first-choice right-back in the team.\n\n\"A highly-rated defender who was an early exponent of the attacking full-back role later honed by the likes of Tommy Gemmell and Jim Craig, Dunky MacKay was a firm fans' favourite and his leadership qualities were identified by Jimmy McGrory, who made him captain in 1961, succeeding Bertie Peacock as skipper.\n\n\"He would later pass on the captain's armband to Billy McNeill for the start of the 1963/64 season.\n\n\"In November 1964, he moved to Third Lanark, before heading out to Australia where he would eventually settle after a brief return to Scotland.\n\n\"He also gained 14 caps for Scotland during his playing career.
