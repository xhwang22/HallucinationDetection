He served (1971\u201374) on the Inner London Education Authority and was its chair in 1973, before working as a special adviser to Labour Party cabinet ministers Barbara Castle (1974\u201376) and Peter Shore (1976\u201377). After a brief stint as a television researcher, Straw entered Parliament in 1979 as MP for Castle\u2019s former seat of Blackburn, Lancashire. He rose steadily through Labour\u2019s ranks and was elected to the party\u2019s opposition shadow cabinet in 1987. During the party\u2019s internal ideological conflict in the 1980s, he moved from being a traditional left-winger to becoming a more centrist modernizer. He was the first leading member of the Labour Party to propose that it repeal its socialist commitment\u2014Clause IV of the party\u2019s constitution\u2014to the state control of industry. In 1994 Straw managed Tony Blair\u2019s successful campaign to be elected party leader, and one of Blair\u2019s first acts on becoming leader was to win the party\u2019s agreement to rewrite Clause IV.\n\nFollowing Labour\u2019s election victory in 1997, Straw was appointed home secretary. He quickly established his progressive credentials by setting up an inquiry into charges of racism in the London police force, promoting the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, and refusing to allow the former Chilean head of state, Augusto Pinochet, to return home following Pinochet\u2019s October 1998 arrest in London. (The arrest followed a request by the Spanish government that Pinochet be extradited to Spain to face charges of murder. He was allowed to return to Chile in March 2000 when a panel of doctors advised that he was unfit to face trial.) Straw upset many progressives, however, by initiating legislation to withdraw the right of some defendants to be tried by a jury, introducing stricter requirements for people seeking political asylum in Great Britain, diluting Labour\u2019s pre-1997 election promise to establish a freedom of information law, and resisting calls to decriminalize the consumption of so-called \u201csoft\u201d drugs, such as marijuana.\n\nIn a 2001 cabinet reshuffle, Straw received the foreign and Commonwealth affairs portfolio. As foreign minister, Straw supported the invasion of Iraq as well as the expansion of the European Union (EU). Despite the latter position, however, Straw was a known skeptic of the euro, the EU\u2019s single currency. Shortly after Labour\u2019s poor showing in the May 2006 local elections, Blair overhauled his cabinet, and Straw was removed as foreign minister and made leader of the House of Commons. Later that year he caused controversy when he stated that Muslim women should not wear full veils. After Gordon Brown became prime minister in 2007, Straw was named justice secretary and lord chancellor, thereby becoming the first member of the House of Commons to take up the latter post. The following year he outlined potential reforms to the House of Lords, which included the election of a certain percentage of members and a reduction in the number of lords. In 2009 he sparked debate after stating that oil deals with Libya had played a \u201cvery big part\u201d in the decision to release Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi\u2014a Libyan convicted of bombing Pan Am flight 103 in 1988\u2014from a Scottish prison. In the general election of 2010 Straw easily retained his Blackburn constituency but lost his cabinet position when Labour was ousted from office. In February 2015 Straw temporarily resigned from the Labour Party after allegations surfaced of his involvement in an influence-peddling scandal that resulted from a sting investigation conducted by Channel Four and The Daily Telegraph. Having already announced in 2013 that he would not stand for reelection, Straw retired from the House of Commons in 2015."}, {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/bdeb3d28-255c-11dc-b338-000b5df10621", "page_content": "What is included in my trial?\n\nDuring your trial you will have complete digital access to FT.com with everything in both of our Standard Digital and Premium Digital packages.\n\nStandard Digital includes access to a wealth of global news, analysis and expert opinion.

Or is he an authoritarian opponent of freedom of information and trial by jury, as painted by civil libertarians? The answer to these questions may decide whether he is a contender for the top job if Tony Blair stands down and Gordon Brown fails to unite the cabinet behind him.\n\nThe real answer is that Mr Straw, widely seen as a decent man in politics, is a sure-footed, practical improver and cunning tactician. Nowhere was this clearer than in his handling of the Pinochet imbroglio from October 1998 onwards. The Tory right were seeking to canonise the Chilean ex-dictator while leftwing MPs hoped to crucify him. Mr Straw successfully got Pinochet off his hands and handed him back to Chile.\n\nPart of his reputation as an authoritarian is hardly his fault. The short-lived Cabinet Office minister David Clark's liberating freedom of information white paper, published in 1998 and subsequently watered down, could never have got by the restrictive lord chancellor, Derry Irvine. But Mr Straw took the blame. He also brought in his own much more restrictive version, getting it on the statute books in 2000.\n\nMr Straw has shown similar determination in his effort to limit trial by jury for petty criminals who, he argues, are \"playing the system\" very expensively. He sees this as a practical reform, not a betrayal of principle. He took the same view about legislation allowing the security services to intercept private emails.\n\nMr Straw has been just as pragmatic in accepting cabinet decisions which run against his sympathies. Nobody who knows him doubts he still fervently supports first-past-the-post and had doubts about the closed list system of proportional representation. But he accepted this in Scotland and Wales as part of Tony Blair's \"project\" to cosy up with the Liberal Democrats, for whom he himself has no time.\n\nHe is not in the Blairites inner-circle but bides his time on its outer soft-left fringe. His views derive from a practical, pragmatic examination of his own experience and those of his constituents.\n\nWhen Gordon Brown was worrying about the danger of a skills shortage, as made fashionable by US president Bill Clinton's adviser Robert Reich, Mr Straw privately pointed to the tens of thousands of skilled workers sacked in two recessions.\n\nHis ability to identify with his Blackburn constituents troubled by \"neighbours from hell\" on their council estates came from his own experience as a child on a council estate in Loughton, Essex. His father, Arthur, was an insurance clerk and conscientious objector who had met his mother, a teacher, in the peace pledge union. They were divorced when he was ten and he was brought up by a single mother. \"We had very little money. There were five children and no father but we didn't get into trouble.\"\n\nIf he is strong on anti-racism, announcing an immediate inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence case, it is partly because of his experience at Brentwood school where he became deputy head boy but was bullied.\n\nAn Aldermaston marcher at 12, a Labour party member by 15, he started on the sensible left as president of Leeds student union and the national union of students. His ambition for political office was whetted on Islington borough council.\n\nHe gave up the bar to become, at 27, special adviser to Barbara Castle at the Department of Social Security. He also met his wife Alice Perkins during his time there. She was a high flying junior civil servant, and is currently deputy to Richard Wilson, the cabinet secretary. The Straws are the most formidable power couple in Whitehall.\n\nHis time with Barbara Castle left him not only with a wife but also a deep-rooted Euroscepticism. This continued when she was sacked by James Callaghan in 1976. Mr Straw swiftly became adviser to Peter Shore, the Europhobe environment secretary.\n\nWith Mr Shore, he helped found the Labour common market safeguards committee, urging withdrawal from the EEC at Labour's 1980 Wembley conference. He was on Mr Shore's leadership campaign team too in 1980 and again in 1983.\n\nWhen Barbara Castle decided to retire from safe Blackburn, she recommended Jack Straw, who had already contested hopeless Tonbridge, as her parliamentary successor, which he became in 1979.\n\nHis party loyalism is of long standing. He tried to dissuade Tony Benn from contesting the deputy leadership against Denis Healey in 1981. He attacked both the SDP deserters and the radicals who provoked them into deserting. When Militant tried to unseat him at Blackburn, he secured 70% backing for the long procedure to expel the Blackburn Six. After Labour's 1983 defeat he warned that a majority of voters opposed its anti-nuclear defence policies. He later advised that London's loony-left councils were making the party unelectable.\n\nAs Labour's education spokesman 1987-92, Mr Straw increasingly fought a two-front war against Kenneth Baker and the Tories facing him and against the Bennite hard-left \"flat earthers\" behind him. It was then that he formed an alliance with Gordon Brown and Tony Blair in opposition to a joint slate for the shadow cabinet linking the soft-left Tribune group and the hard-left Campaign group of Tony Benn.\n\nAs education spokesman, he kept the teachers' unions at arms' length and insisted on frequent testing, high educational standards, quality control and consumer choice. He was, after all, a teacher's son.\n\nHe was the first in the \"reform Clause IV\" field with his 1993 pamphlet, 'Policy and Ideology', angering Labour's leader, John Smith, who thought it was a dead issue. He also advocated downgrading the monarchy to Scandinavian proportions.\n\nWhen Tony Blair succeeded to the leadership in 1994, he handed over to Jack Straw his portfolio of shadow home secretary. Famously, Mr Straw attacked aggressive beggars and squeegee merchants. But he failed to make an expected triumph over home secretary Michael Howard's sacking of Derek Lewis, the prison services chief, because of Tory heckling and his own tinnitus. To his embarrassment Mr Blair even took to the despatch box to challenge Mr Howard. Yet only months later, Mr Straw was doing Mr Howard's job.\n\nHe has done it ever since, a reassuring figure in the New Labour pantheon: confident, able and modestly ambitious. These are traits which may yet put him in the running to enter Number 10.\n\nAsk Aristotle about Jack Straw"}, {"url": "https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/ministers-reflect/jack-straw", "page_content": "Jack Straw gives his advice for incoming ministers\n\nNicola Hughes (NH): If we can think back to when you first started as a minister, in 1997, can you remember what the experience of coming into government for the first time was like?\n\nJack Straw (JS): I can remember exactly. Going to Number 10, being told by Tony Blair that I was going to be Home Secretary, which I was anticipating, but he was\u2026 from his body language he expected me to be more grateful. I was very, very grateful. I can remember going outside into the lobby of Number 10. My two children had been spirited in the back door of Number 10, which was completely improper but anyway they were there, so Will and Charlotte were in the lobby of the Cabinet room. Then Tony came out. He knew the kids very well, so they had a conversation. He said \u2018I\u2019ve just made your Dad Home Secretary\u2019, and they were then taken off by somebody or other and went home. I was bundled into the very smelly armoured Jaguar, which I was told Mrs Thatcher had used and it was pretty decrepit by the time I got it, and taken off to Queen Anne\u2019s Gate, which at that stage was the headquarters of the Home Office, through the litter-strewn quadrangle of this 1970s building and went up in the ministerial lift. I was met at the door by Richard Wilson who was the Permanent Secretary, later Cabinet Secretary, and Ken Sutton who was the Private Secretary and we went upstairs.\n\nI knew Richard anyway and in terms of \u2018was I wide-eyed?\u2019, less so I think than many of my colleagues for two reasons. One was that I\u2019d worked in government in the 1970s as a special adviser in two departments and the second was that I was, and am, married to somebody who was in the civil service. Although Alice, my wife, was extremely careful, and so was I, to maintain the Chinese wall about what exactly she was doing \u2013 because she was in some very sensitive jobs \u2013 if you are living day by day with someone who is in government for all that time you osmotically absorb how the system works and the balance between civil servants and officials.\n\nSo we went upstairs. I said hello to the private office and was then given four folders of the next week, the next fortnight, the next month, the next four months which had been partly based on the manifesto and partly on things which had arisen, and Richard Wilson took me to the window and it was a bright May day, it was May the 3rd 1997, and he said, \u2018What can you see in the sky, Jack?\u2019, and I said \u2018A clear blue sky\u2019 he said \u2018Yes, it\u2019s a very dangerous moment! At any moment in this department an exocet will come out of nowhere and land just there and you have to deal with it because this is the Home Office\u2019. So I then worked through the briefs for incoming minsters, prepared by one Claire Sumner, who is now the Chief of Staff to the Director General of the BBC and did various other jobs in between, and worked out what we should do next.\n\nNH: Home Secretary is obviously a pretty big job. How did you get your head round not just the policy briefings but how to shape and actually do the role?\n\nJS: Well it is a big job and indeed the department was about 80% bigger in those days than it is today, because it took in the prison service, the probation service, all sorts of things like horse racing and gambling and a host of constitutional issues as well as its core business, although terrorism was less on the agenda then. Thankfully we were at an interlude of terrorism then between Irish terrorism and Islamic terrorism. How did I get my brain round it? I was familiar with the subject, I\u2019d worked as a lawyer, I\u2019d always taken an interest in these subjects, and crucially, for the three years before that I was Shadow Home Secretary; we had worked incessantly and very thoroughly on a whole range of reforms that I wanted to introduce. I\u2019ve said this before but it was intellectually the most stimulating period of my time in politics and a very, very good team of people. We took no bullshit; we worked this stuff through because that was the environment that Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had set for us in those final years of opposition. We\u2019d stress-tested the material and the officials in the Home Office had had this material for at least six months. So I knew what I wanted to do. We\u2019d also had to go through a prioritisation for the manifesto which set out what the key things were, what could wait for a year or so. So it was very clear.\n\n\"\u2026it was intellectually the most stimulating period of my time in politics and a very, very good team of people.\"\n\nPeter Riddell (PR): You worked as a special adviser with Barbara Castle and Peter Shore, you were married to Alice; but how prepared were you after 18 years in opposition for actually being a secretary of state? In policy terms, alright you talked to Richard Wilson, you\u2019d done all the access talks, but in terms of, particularly with your whole team, for the actual fact of it\u2019s not talking, it\u2019s doing?\n\nJS: I was as prepared as I think I could have been. The thing that I believe that no one can know until they are faced with it is whether they can make decisions. And not just one decision, with the luxury of a day to think about it, but a box full of decisions and another box full. I\u2019m sure there are ways of testing that, but certainly in the British system prospective ministers are not tested for that. And that leads to there being an assumption that if you\u2019ve been good in opposition you\u2019re likely to be good in government. Whereas the skills needed for the two are often very different. You and I can think of quite a number of examples of people who were brilliant in opposition but simply froze in the headlights in government. Equally, I was OK in opposition and survived, notwithstanding one or two disasters which you\u2019ll remember\u2026\n\nPR: Indeed\u2026!\n\nJS: But I always believed that I would be better in government. I\u2019d had some experience of decision-making on this scale. At the ridiculously precocious age of 26 I found myself as Deputy Leader of the Inner London Education Authority, and I\u2019d been President of the National Union of Students at a very heady time where you had to make loads of decisions in the public eye. So I thought I would be alright, but you don\u2019t know until you are presented with a set of papers; you\u2019ve got to think about how this fits in with your party approach, what the public are expecting of you, and how it squares with the facts as you\u2019re presented. As it turned out I discovered I could do it.\n\nNH: We\u2019ll come back to some of the things you did at the Home Office, but I\u2019m interested in your reflections of different departments; you moved from the Home Office then to the Foreign Office, Leader [of the House] and then later to Ministry of Justice. What was that like going from Home Office to Foreign Office? And how did you get your head round that quite different role and new brief?\n\nJS: Well, in the three of the four jobs I did I was very familiar with the subject matter and really they were different aspects of the same set of dossiers. So Home Office, Leader of the House which I did for a year, and [the] Ministry of Justice were about home affairs and indeed when I was Leader of the House Tony Blair gave me two particular dossiers, party funding and House of Lords reform, which I carried on with in Justice. So I just knew those subjects pretty intimately and how the system operated. In all three of them, but particularly in Home Office and Justice, there was a lot of legislation. I\u2019ve got a good brain for legislation and I could handle all of that.\n\nThe Foreign Office: getting [the job] was literally a shock because I had turned up in Downing Street in early June, the day after the election, expecting to be given John Prescott\u2019s job, which was a big one of housing, local government, transport, the regions all of that stuff [as Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions]. And Prescott thought I\u2019d get that job as well and he had phoned me the day before to have a harmonious transfer. I didn\u2019t know that Tony had decided he wanted to move Robin Cook [then Foreign Secretary] so I turned up expecting the conversation to be about Prescott\u2019s job and Tony said to me, \u2018I\u2019m not giving you Prescott\u2019s job, I\u2019m sending you to the Foreign Office\u2019 and an expletive popped out of my mouth and he said \u2018Do you not want the job?\u2019 and I said \u2018No, no I would like the job, thanks very much, just a bit surprised!\u2019\n\n\"I turned up expecting the conversation to be about Prescott\u2019s job and Tony said to me, \u2018I\u2019m not giving you Prescott\u2019s job, I\u2019m sending you to the Foreign Office\u2019 and an expletive popped out of my mouth\u2026\"\n\nI\u2019d had no formal preparation for foreign policy except for two things. One which was that I\u2019d had a lot of experience of EU negotiations as Home Secretary and we\u2019d had the EU Presidency and I assumed that I\u2019d by all accounts done that fine. That had permeated back to Number 10. The second thing, as it turned out, that one most needed to be a Foreign Secretary was a good understanding of European and international history. Well, that\u2019s just been a continuing life interest of mine.\n\nBut after I got the job I contacted Douglas Hurd, a predecessor of mine who was a friend, and still is, asked him to come in, to tell me how to do the job, and asked him for a reading list. Which he duly produced the next day, and to my relief I\u2019d read most of the books on the reading list. I hadn\u2019t read [Henry] Kissinger on Diplomacy, I then read Kissinger on Diplomacy and discovered that the good parts of Kissinger on Diplomacy were about the Thirty Years\u2019 War and the Peace of Westphalia. Actually the less good parts of it were his contemporary description of diplomacy, but I am a quick learner. But even so, whereas in the Home Office I was blessed with very good press to begin with, which gave me a lot of confidence, in the Foreign Office for the first six months, there was quite a lot of back-biting: \u2018Can this man do this job?\u2019 No particular reason except that there were other people who would have liked the job and were smarting that I had it. And then come the beginning of 2002, there was a crisis between India and Pakistan and I did know an awful lot about the origins about the Kashmir issue between the two. And at that point people said, \u2018OK, you can do the job\u2019.\n\nPR: And of course wasn\u2019t 9/11 in between?\n\nJS: I was hit by 9/11 in between and indeed, and that was, well, the most profound shock to the system. If I look back at the travel plans for me as Foreign Secretary when I got into the office which was in early June 2001, and then what actually happened, the idea that I would be making endless trips to Afghanistan or to Iraq was not on the agenda at all. But that\u2019s what happened.\n\nNH: How did the departments themselves compare? In terms of the things they were doing, the people, the culture?\n\nJS: At one level the rhythm of the departments was very similar, in terms of what the private office [is] there for, the decision making machine for ministers, and in both departments there was a degree of what I call secretary-of-state-worship. So everything was focused on the secretary of state.\n\n\"\u2026in both departments there was a degree of what I call secretary-of-state-worship.\"\n\nAt the Home Office, when I first got there, when I went out, I spotted this the first day I was there, when I went into the private office, everybody stood up! I thought maybe it\u2019s just the first day and then I went out again about half an hour later to get some paperclips or something, and they all stood up, so I had to say to them \u2018You don\u2019t have to stand up, please don\u2019t stand up, that\u2019s not the way I want to do things.\u2019 But they would always call me \u2018Home Secretary\u2019 and in the Foreign Office, \u2018Foreign Secretary\u2019. There was a great woman, Hilary Jackson, who became my Private Secretary and I said to her after a while, I said \u2018Look Hilary, not in public or in front of anybody else, but in private why don\u2019t you call me Jack and I\u2019ll call you Hilary.\u2019 So we went through the phase of her, as I teased her, calling me Grunt! At one level formality helps, and I think overfamiliarity is a really, really bad idea because your roles are different, and also, though I was very lucky in this respect, you don\u2019t know how long you are going to be there.\n\nCulturally, the Home Office thought it was a cut above most other government departments, it had some bright people in it. What was striking when I got to the Foreign Office was that the quantum mass of really bright people was higher than in the Home Office. And also, they\u2019re a different breed in this respect, is that they\u2019re much more political with a small \u2018p\u2019 because when members of the diplomatic service are abroad, they are representing the government of the day publicly, in a way that no home civil service official does.\n\nBut also, Nicola, there was, as I say in terms of the rhythm, there was this profound difference that in the Home Office I was being asked to make decisions, binary decisions, \u2018Are we going to do this, are we going to do that?\u2019, and they were decisions by me, they were in respect of \u2018Do we deport this person, do we declare them persona non grata, do I put a telephone tap on or don\u2019t I, do I give them a warrant or don\u2019t I, do I do this, do I do that?\u2019 These were straightforward exercises of the power of the state at the rough end of the power of the state, which is the Home Office because ultimately it\u2019s about the state being able to lay hands on people. However carefully it is covered up, that\u2019s its job. And there was lots of legislation too, changing the rules.\n\nIn the Foreign Office there are internal decisions of that kind that you are making, but a lot of the time you are asked for a steer about how we should deal with another country, or agreement about a negotiating brief. You are trying to influence events which are happening elsewhere with actors who aren\u2019t open to you, you can\u2019t get the House of Commons to say \u2018we\u2019re not going to do this, we\u2019re going to do that\u2019 in the Foreign Office, it\u2019s not the way it works. That is a very big distinction in terms of the nature of most of the decisions you are asked to take.\n\n\"You are trying to influence events which are happening elsewhere with actors who aren\u2019t open to you, you can\u2019t get the House of Commons to say \u2018we\u2019re not going to do this, we\u2019re going to do that\u2019 in the Foreign Office\"\n\nPR: One thing that\u2019s come up quite a lot in our interviews is that people talk a lot about their private offices, but not much about permanent secretaries. You had some quite strong permanent secretaries, some you knew very well. This came up in some of our discussions, that people weren\u2019t talking about their permanent secretaries, it\u2019s funny. I remember Gus O\u2019Donnell [former Cabinet Secretary] saying \u2018Ah, but the secretary of state has most of the contact with their private offices, only if there is a problem does the permanent secretary come in.\u2019\n\nJS: Yeah. Well, different departments are different. So the Home Office, I knew Richard Wilson anyway, my wife had worked for him when she was at the Treasury. He was coming towards the end of his period at the Home Office and wanted to become Cabinet Secretary; after quite a short familiarity with him I thought he would make a very good cabinet secretary. I had quite a lot to do with him. But I had more to do day by day with the deputy secretaries or the under-secretaries who were responsible for particular subject areas.\n\nI then was given a choice by the civil service commissioner, well I insisted on a choice, over his successor and I was presented with three candidates who I interviewed and chose David Omand and he and I worked extremely closely together. So I saw a lot of David, partly because many of the problems we had in the Home Office were operational ones. Like the passport system collapsing, or the equally awful Siemens computer system for the immigration and nationality department, that collapsed too. And grungy things inside the prison service. My view was it was pretty difficult to be a home secretary unless you are willing to get involved in the operational stuff. So I had a lot to do with him and a very, very good relationship with him until he very sadly, if you remember, fell ill. And then John Gieve came in for a period, we didn\u2019t overlap for that long. And a guy called John Warne who was the Deputy Secretary for Security was the interim.\n\nIn the Foreign Office it was different. I mean, sorry about this thing about friends, I knew quite a lot of people who were in the Foreign Office, but I knew only two people very well as personal friends. One was David Manning who I think, was already a diplomatic adviser to the Prime Minister when I got there or very quickly thereafter, he had been at NATO and Israel. Then John Kerr was the Permanent Secretary and I had quite a lot to do with John but he was on his last six months, and by the time I got there, Michael Jay had already been appointed as Perm Sec to take over from John in January \u201902. I remember Tony asking me, I think when I was appointed, did I mind and I said \u2018absolutely fine\u2019.\n\nNow this was a very close relationship, Michael and his wife Sylvia were long-standing family friends. That made things much easier in many respects, but it also meant that we had to be careful to ensure that our relationship in the office was strictly professional. But the other thing about the Foreign Office is that the senior operational official is not the Permanent Secretary, or PUS [Permanent Under-Secretary] as it\u2019s known, but the Political Director. It\u2019s a misnomer as a title because it\u2019s not a political appointment and there\u2019s also the Deputy Secretary or Director General. Anyway, that bod is virtually the Deputy Foreign Secretary. So I spent more time with the Political Director than any other official. It started off being a guy called Emyr Jones-Parry whom I then appointed to the UN. After that it was Peter Ricketts who\u2019s just retired as our Ambassador to Paris but became the Permanent Secretary in between, and then it was John Sawers. So they would be the people I\u2019d go round the world with, [doing] really complicated and difficult negotiations in the thick of Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and stuff like that, then separately you would spend a lot of time with the Director General and the Director Europe on European stuff. So those are the key officials.\n\nPR: You mentioned junior ministers, and the difficulty [of] being a junior minister, can you elucidate?\n\nJS: Well, I think that talking to junior ministers, it\u2019s very clear to me that what their life is like depends almost entirely on their relationship with their secretary of state. And a lot of junior ministers complain that they have not much to do with their secretary of state, they don\u2019t know quite what they are expected to do except they know that what they have to do is deal with the dross like endless adjournment debate, lots of official ministerial correspondence, and visits that nobody else wants to do.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether junior ministers of mine complained of that, but what I tried to do was to involve them in the team. Key to that was having a Monday lunchtime meeting where they came and also the special advisers and the people from the party and from Number 10. We sat round the table, went through the business for the week, and also I used to talk to them. I mean sometimes they were a bit\u2026 it was horses for courses, and one or two you had to be careful about, because they would rather be getting your job and I used to say to them \u2018calm down!\u2019 You\u2019d find that they were few and far between, particularly by the time I was at the Foreign Office, but even at the Home Office [it was OK].\n\nIn the Home Office [there was] a colleague, George Howarth MP, who worked for me for two years. He was and is a very close personal pal, so I just gave him a whole [area of responsibility], he was a parly sec [Parliamentary Under-Secretary] but he likes horse racing so I gave him all the stuff that went off to the DCMS [Department for Culture, Media and Sport] and a lot of other stuff and just said \u2018Get on with it, come and see me if you ever need a steer\u2019. He had a great time. Similarly with Mike O\u2019Brien on other areas, I tried to give them stuff and say to them that I trusted them about whether they came to me. Sometimes, in the Ministry of Justice, it was a bit tricky.\n\nAnyway just to finish off about the permanent secretary position, in the Ministry of Justice it was Alex Allen to begin with, but he became ill and then again I saw three candidates and appointed Suma Chakrabarti, who is slightly \u2018marmite\u2019 with people but I judged, I think I was right about this, that given the fact there were two chunks of departments who had to be bolted together it probably needed someone like Suma. I saw a fair amount of him.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think you could do a job as a minister effectively unless you take an interest in the detail as well as the grand strategy\"\n\nNH: I suppose different ministers take different views on how actively they get involved with the management of the department, what did you see as being the perm sec\u2019s role versus your role?\n\nJS: Well, I don\u2019t think you could do a job as a minister effectively unless you take an interest in the detail as well as the grand strategy. This used to be a subject of some teasing between Tony Blair and me because he used to say \u2018You\u2019ve got to look at the big picture\u2019 and I used to say \u2018Yes Tony, that\u2019s true, but if you look at the big picture you\u2019ll find they are made up of very little brush strokes. And if you get them in the wrong place the picture doesn\u2019t work.\u2019 Or to an analogy more in my favour, I would say that the difference between German cars and British cars in the 1970s wasn\u2019t the big picture, British cars looked very nice; it was the fact that on the Friday afternoon British cars weren\u2019t bolted together properly. And the other thing is that if things go wrong operationally, you won\u2019t see the officials for dust. I mean you will, it doesn\u2019t mean they are abandoning you, but you\u2019re the bloke in the frame. So in the Home Office nobody really minded me getting involved in the operational stuff.\n\nThere was a bit of resentment in the Foreign Office because I was involved in it, but I was unapologetic about it. Why? Well because for example in October 2002 I was in bed, in the rather fine bed in Chevening [the Foreign Secretary\u2019s official residence], I was woken up on Sunday morning to discover that a very large number, it turned out to be 33 in the end, of British citizens had been killed in a terrorist bomb in Bali. And our response was inadequate. This was an operational response but we, the response centre wasn\u2019t properly operating, we didn\u2019t have virtual teams to move in for things like that, the place was very complacent and guess who was in the firing line for that: J. Straw. So I think you\u2019ve got to take an interest in these things.\n\nThere was a bit of tension between Suma and me, but we\u2019re grown up and I thought that, as I say, I was fully entitled to get involved in the operation. I was always extremely careful not to interfere with permanent secretaries\u2019 discretion over appointments. You had much more discretion as Secretary of State over appointments in the Foreign Office, just by tradition, than you did at the Home Office, or in the inland civil service. But anyway that was my view.\n\n\"I was woken up on Sunday morning to discover that a very large number, it turned out to be 33 in the end, of British citizens had been killed in a terrorist bomb in Bali. And our response was inadequate.\"\n\nPR: What about the balance of how you allocated your time, I accept in your Home Secretary job and the other three jobs there\u2019s a big contrast. One of the issues that\u2019s come up, again and again in interviews has been how people allocate their time. Particularly between the House and Department, and in some respects the constituency: I well know you did your bit going up there and what you did in Blackburn. How consciously did you, when you became Home Secretary think about allocating your time?\n\nJS: I was very conscious about the need to spend time in the Commons. So I didn\u2019t have my diary packed out with lunch appointments, I mean partly because I wanted to keep my weight down\u2026\n\nPR: Yes, a lot of us try and don\u2019t succeed. Anyway. [laughter]\n\nJS: And I went to the gym in the Commons. A long time before it was trendy! Both because I needed the exercise but also because the locker room is a great place for gossip and stuff amongst a particular cross section of members who keep themselves fit. I used to have lunch in the tea room regularly and in those days, before they changed the hours, I was around, particularly when I was, even when I was Foreign Secretary, if I was in the UK, I would make sure I\u2019d be in the House one evening a week. It wasn\u2019t much fun being married to me, I don\u2019t think. But I thought that was absolutely essential because I was really conscious of the fact that whilst my position at Blackburn, unless something absolutely extraordinary happened, was there as long as I wanted it \u2013 and as it turned out I was a minister for the whole of government \u2013 my position as a minister could come to an end at any moment.\n\n\"I went to the gym in the Commons. A long time before it was trendy! Both because I needed the exercise but also because the locker room is a great place for gossip\u2026\"\n\nIn fact, I think one of the reasons why it didn\u2019t was precisely because I was conscious of the fact that it could. So I never, ever regretted spending time in the Commons. I used to pick things up and I\u2019d have a little red book \u2013 which I still have \u2013 and people would raise things with me on both sides, and I\u2019d scribble them down and I\u2019d get back to the office and I\u2019d pull out the page and say will you get on with that and it made a phenomenal difference. And you\u2019d find things out.\n\nIn terms of managing my time if you talked to Alice, she would say that from time to time, the private office would get on to her and say \u2018We\u2019ve got to get a grip of Jack\u2019s diary,\u2019 so there\u2019d be a diary meeting, not a crisis management meeting but we\u2019d have a serious discussion about handling my diary. I didn\u2019t terribly like dealing with diary things, if you talk to Nicole [formerly a private secretary to Straw] I think she\u2019d say I wasn\u2019t a nightmare, but I used to spend too long thinking about whether I should do some particular engagement, I should have been slightly more ruthless about that.\n\nIn terms of getting through the work, I was very clear about that. One other thing I\u2019d say in terms of how can you be a minister, you need to be able to look at a set of papers and come to a decision there and then, or be very clear about why you are sending the papers back and always record your views on the papers, so it\u2019s clear. I tried to think ahead, so we\u2019d have strategy meetings about what was going to come up and prepare speeches properly, but not spend an inordinate amount of time on speeches, because except for the one to the UN General Assembly, and ones on the Iraq war and so on, the difference between me spending three hours and six hours wasn\u2019t a great deal in terms of output for me to spend three hours on and waste it.\n\n\"...you need to be able to look at a set of papers and come to a decision there and then\"\n\nPR: What about, and this particularly applies when you were Home Secretary, and to a certain extent in the Foreign Office, when something totally unexpected hit, how did you handle that? I know a couple of phone calls between you and I, I think it was when you had come back from either Pakistan or India and you were woken up when you\u2019d told the private office not to do that, and it was the men stuck in Dover?\n\nJS: Well, actually what happened there was this. I remember it acutely, it was a Sunday. Alice and I went out cycling around the lanes of West Oxfordshire, we\u2019ve got a house out there. We\u2019d stopped by a pub called the Swan at Swinbrook, which overlooks the river Windrush. There I was in my Lycra. One of the detectives, Garry, came to me out from the van \u2013 they used to trail me. He said \u2018Boss, you\u2019ve got to take a call\u2019 and this was about the fact that the English [football] fans had rioted in Charleroi and the Belgian government had arrested 1,000 people and they wanted us to take them back again. So I had to get on the phone to the Ministry of Defence, because they couldn\u2019t find any other bugger to do it, to ask them to lay on three Tri-Stars to get these bloody people back. And I\u2019m doing all this in my Lycra shorts!\n\nSo anyway, got that sorted and then was woken up in the early hours of the morning to say 58 poor souls had been found dead in the back of a lorry at Dover. So what you have to know about these situations is to understand that you\u2019ve got to get on top of the issue straight away and not mess around. Crises will always get worse if you are not seen to be taking control immediately. So I had a sort of crisis-mode, which I think sometimes used to take people by surprise, because normally I think I\u2019m fairly relaxed. I did my best to be well mannered with people all the time, but I was absolutely clear about things, about what had to happen and what you had to do and you had to get on top of it.\n\n\"\u2026 58 poor souls had been found dead in the back of a lorry at Dover. So what you have to know about these situations is to understand that you\u2019ve got to get on top of the issue straight away and not mess around.\"\n\nSo to take another example, on the 29th of August 2007, I was asleep, I got phoned by the private office at about 6.30am to say that the Prison Officers Association [POA] had just embarked on a one-day strike, that day, without any notice to us, they kept it completely secret. So we had 80,000 prisoners being taken hostage by the Prison Officers [Association].\n\nBy that stage I had been ten years a minister and knew what to do. I made some phone calls straight away to Alex Allen, to the private office and to the head of the prison service, making sure they were on top of it. I then had a visit to some court somewhere in London, I decided to do it because I judged that we wouldn\u2019t know precisely what was going on for a couple of hours and I might as well carry on normally and we\u2019d give the telly some wall paper. I then got to the office and went into overdrive. I\u2019d already told them to instruct lawyers to take an injunction out against the POA, and be very tough with them. Then I got to the office and by that stage the prisoners in Lancaster Farms, which is a youth offenders\u2019 institution and they are most difficult to handle, these are basically young thugs, who are out of control \u2013 they burnt down a wing because the prison officers weren\u2019t there. It was just outrageous what the POA did. Anyway, we just went into overdrive, I got hold of the president of the POA, said to him we were going to take them to court that day and they better back off. We then got an injunction against them and explained that there weren\u2019t going to be any concessions and we got there, they backed off. In between Gordon [Brown] got word of what I was doing and I had to go and talk to him for ten minutes and tell him that it was all OK, I was handling it and you just have to, just handle these things.\n\nPR: How, in these instances, how good were the civil service?\n\nJS: They were very good. The prison service knows what to do in a situation like that and they are very well skilled, they are well exercised, they got a gold command set up straight away. And so they were very, very good. I mean these are bods who are governor grade bods who have had a lifetime\u2019s experience of handling prisoners, which is quite difficult, and prison officers which is extremely difficult. You didn\u2019t leave it for half an hour, you just got on with it and got on top of it that day, never mind what else is going on, you dealt with that, because you had to.\n\nPR: Particularly when you were Home Secretary and at [the Ministry of] Justice, what were the major achievements, and how did you achieve them?\n\nJS: Well the major thing, in terms of the manifesto was to say we were going to get crime down, going to reform the youth justice system, going to provide remedies for people who were subject to antisocial behaviour. Going to improve the way the police operated, try to speed up the courts of justice. For most of those, there were metrics and they could be measured.\n\nBut there were other things, for instance, which weren\u2019t in the manifesto, [like] the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry, which now looks completely obvious in retrospect and fortunately it\u2019s not been subject to a further inquiry on an inquiry, unlike poor Peter Taylor\u2019s inquiry into Hillsborough. And that wasn\u2019t in the manifesto, I decided, in fact before the election, I\u2019d like to do it. There was quite a tussle for three months to get it going and then I got it going. You may remember that the Lawrence family had been persuaded that Sir William McPherson was not an appropriate appointment [to lead the enquiry] so I had to keep them onside and explain that this was the only show in town. And got through it and then crucially decided, the most important decision I made on that was to set up a mechanism for implementing what McPherson had recommended and one other thing, which I learnt quite quickly, is if you want to do something and you\u2019re not sure that the department or institution wants to do it, then what you have to do is set up a series of meetings; in the Lawrence case it was every month.\n\nI can give you another example where I had them every two weeks and so gradually the department gets the impression that you are really serious about them. The second case was on social impact bonds which was an idea from Ronnie Cohen [Sir Ronald Cohen, businessman and social investor] and it was new and no one was quite sure how it was going to operate. I wasn\u2019t quite sure how it was going to operate, but I thought that it was really important to give it a fair wind and also because there was an election coming up to show that we, the Labour government, were as interested in this as Conservatives, because it was something the Conservatives would be interested in, wouldn\u2019t they? And there was quite a lot of working without enthusiasm from officials, I felt they had other things on their agenda. So I just put in meetings every two weeks and after a while we got the scheme started.\n\nPR: What about relations with Number 10?\n\nJS: My relationship with Number 10? Right! Well in all three actually, all four jobs\u2026 In the Home Office, I mean, bear in mind at that stage my relationship with Tony was very close, he had every reason to trust me and vice-versa. I was doing the job that he was primed for. He\u2019d approved of my approach to this, so he trusted my judgement on it. With some exceptions, basically he left me to get on with it and I made sure I did. Liz Lloyd was the point person in the policy unit, political policy unit, in Number 10, I got [her] into all the meetings, I saw no reason [why not], I just thought they should see stuff. Alastair Campbell [then Director of Communications and Strategy for Tony Blair] \u2013 a friend of mine \u2013 I had a robust relationship with him. I mean he tried to interfere with me over whether Mike Tyson should be banned from coming to the UK or not. That sort of stuff. It was a very, very difficult decision to make, but each way in the end I decided we shouldn\u2019t. We couldn\u2019t ban him, it turned out that although he had a conviction for rape, his manager, Don King, had a conviction for murder and he\u2019d been coming in and out the country. Alastair got involved in stuff he shouldn\u2019t have done. I think if I\u2019d not been as confident as I was, I would have felt quite intimidated by it, but I didn\u2019t. Tony used to, if there was something really, really tricky coming on\u2026 I remember one morning I was on the Today programme, we had an ISDN box at home, so I\u2019d been getting keyed up to do this at ten past eight and Tony would come on the phone at ten to eight to take me through my lines! I used to have to say to him, \u2018Tony you just have to trust me\u2019, because it would just raise the blood pressure.\n\n\"I remember one morning I was on the Today programme\u2026 I\u2019d been getting keyed up to do this at ten past eight and Tony would come on the phone at ten to eight to take me through my lines!\"\n\nAt the Foreign Office obviously it was different. If you become foreign secretary, and this must be true for any combination of foreign secretary and prime minister these days, I think it was ever thus, you\u2019ve got to accept that the head of government is going to take a close interest in foreign policy and the closer you get to war, the closer will be their interest. Tony was famously in the lead, but for Afghanistan the decision was made anyway; there was no argument about whether we invaded Afghanistan after the Taliban had refused to give us access to the Al Qaeda network there. With Iraq obviously Tony was in the lead on that. But I absolutely was not out of the loop at all on that and was able, as I suspect the Chilcot Inquiry will show, to make my contributions and in the end came to view that the war was justified.\n\nOn some stuff Tony left me to it. So on India, Pakistan, bear in mind that was the key international issue in the first six months of 2002, not Iraq, he left me to it. On Iran, interestingly it was De Villepan, Fischer [then French and German Foreign Secretaries] and my idea to start these EU-3 negotiations. And Tony was a bit reluctant about it. I remember being on holiday, the Foreign Office had installed a fax machine in our gite in the South West of France and I had to keep having to push back on the changes he was making to the letter we were brokering with the Iranians. So there were\u2026 we were negotiating the terms of an exchange of letters. Tony did leave Iran to me thereafter although I think much later on it was one of the reasons I think he felt uncomfortable about me and got me to move. Having David Manning [then Diplomatic Adviser to Tony Blair] there in Number 10 was terrific, because he and I were close friends and we completely trusted each other.\n\nLeader of the House was a different job, there you\u2019ve got to handle all the whips. And as for Justice, Gordon, I mean he left me to it basically. There was constitutional stuff, which of course he was very keen on to begin with if you remember his July 2nd 2007 agenda. He might well have pursued that had it not been for the financial crisis. But he knew I knew all about this area and that I was on top of it.\n\nPR: Different thing, special advisers. You\u2019d been one. You always valued yours?\n\nJS: I did. I had, on the political side I only had two, Ed Owen who I\u2019d recruited in opposition in early 1993, he was with me for 12 years, and then as it turned out his best mate, Mark Davies was with me until, from \u201805 to \u201810. Then on the policy side, I always had one doing politics/media and the other doing policy, so I had Norman Warner and then Justin Russell who subsequently converted and became a career civil servant. In the Foreign Office I had Michael Williams, now Lord Williams, and a chap called Malcolm Chandler who is now at RUSI [the foreign affairs think-tank]. In the Ministry, Leader of the House and Ministry of Justice, I had Mark Davies and a guy called Declan McHugh.\n\nPR: Thanks to me.\n\nJS: Thanks to you. Indeed. You recommended him. So and they were all very good and I didn\u2019t really need to tell them this, but I established very clear rules for them, that they weren\u2019t to go round politicking, that they had to respect the civil service and all the rest of it. Anyway, that\u2019s what they did. I think they were extremely good and they worked very well with the private office.\n\nNH: Thinking about that whole period of 1997 to 2010, it\u2019s often seen as a time of quite big change in Whitehall; introducing PSAs and targets and things like that. What were the big changes that you observed in government over that time?\n\nJS: We did have all that bloody stuff! So I mean some of the stuff, I\u2019d been slightly dismissive of Number 10 but there were bilaterals on a fairly regular basis, particularly on the Home Office stuff with Tony, where he would try and put my feet in the fire for example on the performance of the immigration service or were we cutting crime. I used to sometimes get irritated by it, but actually it was perfectly sensible. For example he said to me, one time, \u2018I want you to get car crime and burglary down by 30%\u2019 and I think I said to him \u2018would you like me to produce a new plan for pushing water uphill?\u2019, but anyway when I got back and talked to the office and talked to people about it I thought we could do it and we did. But that idea would certainly not have come from me, it came from Number 10 and we got on with it. On the PSAs and stuff, I frankly found them a bit of a bore.\n\nNH: Was there anything you found particularly frustrating about being a minister or any ideas you might have about how Whitehall and government can be more effective?\n\nJS: I\u2019m sure I did. Well there were things I found frustrating, I mean, inevitably because you are running very large organisations. A sort of gratuitous incompetence I would find frustrating. So things where people say they\u2019re going to do them, and then they don\u2019t do them. If people tried hard to do something and didn\u2019t quite work out \u2013 well, OK. I mean I remember the time Ann Widdecombe [then a Conservative MP] was running a pretty effective campaign against me and the stars having been in the right place for 18 months, do you remember that first 18 months?\n\nPR: Yes, yes.\n\nJS: \u2026everybody thought I could walk on water and The Economist wrote me up as the coming man and all that stuff. And then we had a series of disasters because suddenly the Lawrence Report got leaked and I had to put an injunction on the Sunday Telegraph\u2026\n\nBut that was the one thing I really worried about Number 10, their leaking. And I was worried about them leaking the Lawrence Report and the reason I knew it was Number 10 was we\u2019d held back the full report, gave them a synopsis and it was the synopsis that got leaked. Anyway, it wouldn\u2019t have been leaked from my department. But that was a problem. So anyway, there was a whole series of things [that] had been going wrong. Ann Widdecombe was running this campaign of fortnightly supply day debates against me, you know \u2018part 52 about why Straw is incompetent\u2019. And the drill was you\u2019d put down an amendment so that the motion, in her name, would be \u2018This House believes that Straw is incompetent\u2019, but we\u2019d amend to delete everything after \u2018House\u2019 and insert \u2018Straw\u2019s wonderful\u2019 but then say why. And this one motion which Widdecombe had put down was about criminal justice, I think. And I drafted the amendment, gave it to the office. In those days the Commons\u2019 Order Paper came through the door the next morning, or the cops brought it round when they came to collect me. I looked through it and I thought this is the amendment to the motion that we had two weeks ago! So this is going to be a really easy, the charge that Straw\u2019s incompetent and we can\u2019t even put out the correct amendment, I was speechless. I saw this and I knew it had been a complete fuck-up. And everybody said they were very sorry. So at the beginning of the debate I had to withdraw my amendment, and I made a joke of it saying it was business as usual or something.\n\n\"\u2026that was the one thing I really worried about Number 10, their leaking.\"\n\nPR: What about relations with the Treasury?\n\nJS: Treasury, they were tricky. I felt that Gordon [Brown] had a sort of, a slightly Manichean view of the world about departments he wanted to favour and departments he didn\u2019t. Which was I think in retrospect something to do with\u2026 well, they were departments that Tony favoured. I was, and I remain, concerned about the lack of scrutiny of money that went to aid budget. I am perfectly in favour of some sensible increase in aid, but not the way it was handled, nor coming to the Foreign Office, the fact that Tony allowed DfID [Department for International Development] to be completely detached from the mainstream of UK foreign policy. Why is the British tax payer paying this money? I knew enough about negotiating with the Treasury to know that you had to take it to the wire. Alice [Perkins] had been Director of Public Spending. So that\u2019s what I used to do. You always get an extra \u00a320 million if you\u2019re difficult. But all three of the departments, they weren\u2019t regarded as sexy by the Treasury. So there wasn\u2019t money coming down from heaven.\n\nNH: And what did you observe about cross-departmental working, especially in [the Ministry of] Justice \u2013 you had quite a cross-cutting agenda?\n\nJS: Well, it remains very difficult to do that, because the departments are so strong. And also, I don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s an answer to this, but a critical part of the constitutional architecture of our system is that individual secretaries of state are responsible for what happens in their department. And you are. These things are done in your name. That makes the departments very strong but trying to work across government much more difficult, and that of course is compounded by inherent rivalry between ministers. And even, Nicola, if ministers were given a contract and told they were there for four years or something, I think it would still be inherently difficult. It might be much, much easier if you had a presidential system where the ministers were officials, it might be, but if you look at the American system you\u2019re still going to get people jockeying for positon. So it\u2019s difficult. I think we got better at it over the years.\n\n\"\u2026things are done in your name. That makes the departments very strong but trying to work across government much more difficult, and that of course is compounded by inherent rivalry between ministers.\"\n\nNH: Just through knowing each other better?\n\nJS: Yes and also the system getting better. I think greater collaboration at an official level as well. But I think it\u2019s an inherent problem. There are strengths in the British government system, which is that ministers are personally accountable and so are their permanent secretaries, there\u2019s lots of advantages of that. There are disadvantages too, that\u2019s one of them.\n\nNH: So we usually ask people at this juncture how you would define an effective minister. I\u2019m interested in your broad reflections on that, but also specifically if there are things you think make an effective Foreign Secretary, Home Secretary, Justice Secretary?\n\nJS: An effective minister. Having an individual who knows what they want to do: you\u2019re not just a place-holder, you\u2019ve got to be very clear about that. Then you can be much more explicit about what you want to do in any area of domestic policy, compared with foreign policy which I\u2019ll come on to in a moment. And then be capable of using the machine to produce and to implement the best possible decisions. You\u2019ve got to have the constitutional, the personal constitutional makeup, to be able to take decisions, inevitably on inadequate information. Inevitably about things that are going to happen in the future, so they are uncertain. To make the best decisions and then to move on, and to accept that some of the decisions will not be correct in retrospect. But that is life and they wouldn\u2019t be correct if you sat on them for another two weeks or so.\n\nTo recognise, just to repeat the point, the critical importance of implementing what you\u2019re doing, so the old story about policy and operations, the testimony of policy is how it operates, and trying to get follow through that is not just about a press notice or an interview on the Today programme or one minute 35 seconds on the ten o\u2019clock news. It is about what happens down the line.\n\n\"\u2026the testimony of policy is how it operates, and trying to get follow through that is not just about a press notice or an interview on the Today programme\u2026\"\n\nNH: If I can just push you on that slightly, because a lot of the ministers we speak to say that but do you have any examples of how as a secretary of state you can ensure it happens?\n\nJS: Yes. I\u2019ve given you an example in respect of the Lawrence enquiry, because I was very conscious of the fact that if I didn\u2019t do that, a fairly reluctant sort of Whitehall you know \u2013 the Lawrence Report would go the way of the Scarman Inquiry [on the Brixton Riots], fine reports shoved on the shelf. But you\u2019ve got to keep progress chasing and you\u2019ve got to know. So I did do a lot of that in all sorts of areas. And in fairness what Number 10 were doing as they got better at it, was actually progress chasing you, so you progress chased\u2026\n\nPR: Michael Barber\u2019s [Number 10 delivery specialist] processes?\n\nJS: Yeah, yeah. I thought, in the Immigration Service for example, I thought it was really helpful because the Immigration Service was almost impenetrable when I got there. I mean it\u2019s ten miles down the road in Croydon, very, very strong culture and they felt beleaguered, and sort of penetrating it [was hard] they had a monopoly supply of information about what you could do. So having Mike Barber\u2019s people come in was very helpful.\n\nIn the Foreign Office what you do is different, so on any dossier you\u2019ve got to say what you want to do and work out where your alliances are and so on. Sometimes you\u2019ll drum and manage events, other times you are trying to create history as well as managing it. In terms of managing events for a peaceful outcome, a good example is how we and the Americans handled the Kashmir dispute. It was actually us, as much as the Americans. And in terms of, if you like, making history the best example is the EU-3 negotiations on Iran, which 12 years later produced a result, I was really pleased about that because we got it going.\n\nPR: Just finally, what advice would you give to a minister entering government for the first time?\n\nJS: Well, if they happen to have read a lot of political history and biography, you\u2019ve got to have an understanding about what\u2019s happened before in order to know what may happen in the future. To pay attention to the House of Commons, not do what a lot of my colleagues did which was to disappear into the red box, in their ministerial suite of rooms, only to reappear when they got sacked. To pay attention to the detail: I mean have a big picture, but pay attention to the detail, don\u2019t sit on papers, turn them over. And go to the gym. Seriously, Peter, for me if I\u2019d not taken exercise throughout the period I wouldn\u2019t have coped as well as I did in government. Especially in the Foreign Office where the pressure was the greatest.\n\nPR: And you were ill a couple of times in the Foreign Office weren\u2019t you?\n\nJS: I had bronchitis.\n\nPR: That was 2002, wasn\u2019t it? It was during the Afghanistan period.\n\nJS: I had two bouts of being ill, both for about a week. The worst time was when I\u2019d been to Afghanistan, it was the week I think of the David Kelly [the weapons expert] death. So I went to, like you do, I went to Afghanistan and then I took the plane to Kandahar. And I had lunch in the governor\u2019s palace in Kandahar and then we took the plane to Baghdad, like you do, caught a plane I think to Basra and then to Baghdad and then I think we went to Beirut. Then I realised on the way back I was getting the most intense food poisoning. And I remember I had to make a statement outside Number 10, I said \u2018Well, you\u2019re going to have to get me a little podium\u2019 and I went out there and read this thing, thinking I\u2019m going to fall over in a minute and then the private office said to me \u2018I think you need to be in bed for a bit\u2019, which is why I never went to the Hutton Inquiry. And then I had pneumonia for about a week, yeah. It was a very unhealthy lifestyle."}, {"url": "https://londonspeakerbureau.com/speaker-profile/jack-straw/", "page_content": "Rt Hon Jack Straw is one of three senior Ministers to remain in Cabinet throughout the 1997 to 2010 Labour Governments under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He was Foreign Secretary (2001-2006), Home Secretary (1997-2001), Leader of the Commons (2006-7), and Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary (2007-10). After Labour lost power in 2010, Straw served for six months as Shadow Deputy Prime Minister, and then stood down from the Shadow Cabinet, having served on Labour\u2019s Front Bench for over thirty years.\n\nStraw was a Member of Parliament for Blackburn from 1979 to 2015, when he retired from the Commons. His approach won praise from Margaret Thatcher, who once declared \u201cI would trust Jack Straw\u2019s judgement. He is a very fair man\u201d. Before becoming an MP, Straw practised as a Barrister, and then worked as a Special Adviser in the 1974-79 Labour Government. Appointed Foreign Secretary in 2001, Straw played a leading role in the dramatic foreign policy problems arising from the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and the resulting interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. He was instrumental in helping to avoid an extremely dangerous armed conflict between India and Pakistan over Kashmir in 2002.\n\nJack Straw was a member of the European Council for five years. In 2005 he led successful efforts to open formal EU membership negotiations with Turkey. He is co-Chairman of the government-sponsored British-Turkish Forum. Straw was given the Order of the Republic of Turkey by President Abdullah G\u00fcl in 2012. With his French and German counterparts, Jack initiated the \u201cE3\u201d (later \u201cP5+1\u201d) negotiations with Iran over their nuclear programme, and has taken a close interest in Iran ever since, having visited it eight times. In July 2019 he published \u201cThe English Job: Understanding Iran, and why it distrusts Britain\u201d (Biteback), which has been very well reviewed: \u2018Highly readable, full of vivid history\u201d (Observer); \u201cEssential reading..clear-sighted and lucid\u201d (Sunday Times).\n\nHe is a Visiting Professor at University College London School of Public Policy. Since 2015 he has been Chairman of the Blackburn Youth Zone, and from 2017 a Trustee of the Star (Tauheedul) Education Trust, which runs over twenty mainly Muslim state-funded schools. Straw is a Trustee of the Global Strategy Forum, and of the Atlantic Partnership. He is a Distinguished Fellow of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), and a Bencher of the Inner Temple. He is an adviser to a number of companies. He is Honorary Vice-President of the Blackburn Rovers Football Club.\n\nJack Straw was appointed by Prime Minister David Cameron as a member of the Independent Commission on Freedom of Information (2015-16), and served as a member of the Archbishops\u2019 Council on the future of Cathedrals. In 2012 he published \u2018Last Man Standing: Memoirs of a Political Survivor\u2019 (2012, Macmillan).

Back in December 1997, young William, the 17-year-old son of the then home secretary, Jack Straw, fell victim to a nasty sting by the Daily Mirror. The tabloid paid two of his friends \u00a32,000 each to set up a meeting in a London pub, where an undercover reporter plied them with drinks and persuaded him to buy her \u00a310 of cannabis.\n\nThe resulting headline \u2013 \"Cabinet minister son sells drugs to Mirror\" \u2013 landed Straw a police caution which still causes him problems today. If he wants to go to the US to visit his Texan in-laws, like Nigella Lawson he requires a letter of special dispensation from the embassy to be let past the border.\n\nSixteen years on, it still smarts. \"It was a horrible experience realising that one of your friends had essentially betrayed you,\" says the 33-year-old, who insists he hasn't smoked weed in at least six years, probably longer.\n\n\"It made me wary of trusting people, which is a sad thing for a 17-year-old to deal with. But I think it's probably a good lesson for life, that you're really clear what people's motivations are before sharing too much with them.\"\n\nHowever painful the experience, it has not deterred Straw, now an associate director at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), from seeking a role in public life. In September he was selected as the Labour candidate for next year's general election in the Lancashire seat of Rossendale and Darwen, next door to the Blackburn constituency his father has served since before Will was born. Being an MP, he said solemnly in a cafe in the Rossendale valley last week, \"is a noble profession, even if some people let it down from time to time and give it a bad name\".\n\nOn Saturday, Straws senior and junior appeared together for the first time in the son's long parliamentary campaign when they held an open-air meeting in Rawtenstall. The election is still a year away and already he cheerfully admits to being \"a bit irritated\" by constant questions about his dad.\n\nSo why campaign together? Essentially, it seems, because it would be \"more weird\" to pretend he wasn't his father's offspring \u2013 and also because Jack Straw knows everybody in east Lancashire and has honed his vote-gathering technique to perfection after more than three decades standing on a soapbox outside Marks & Spencer in Blackburn town centre most weekends.\n\n\u2018The Mr Darcy of student politics\u2019: Will Straw, then president of the Oxford student union, on a protest against top-up fees in 2002. Photograph: Stephen Hird/Reuters\n\nThe resemblance between father and son is obvious: the same deliberate, classless way of speaking with an unplaceable accent; the impeccable manners; the New Labour. Straw the younger is probably better looking, with sandy dark blonde hair and light hazel eyes which earned him a special mention in a Guardian article back in 2002, when he was president of the Oxford student union. The piece compared him to Mr Darcy after he had been photographed at a march against top-up fees: \"hair glistening with rain, parka clinging damply to his manly frame and behind him a soggy banner asking \"What's worth more? Education or war?\" Laura Barton described him as \"true political totty \u2026 ever so slightly unkempt and tousle-haired.\"\n\nReminded of the article, Straw blushes. Today, married with a seven-month-old baby son, he possesses wholesome good looks of the sort which probably prompt old ladies to describe him as \"such a lovely boy\". He turns up for our interview wearing a cagoule and driving a Rover hatchback.\n\nAsk him about charges of nepotism in his selection, and Straw has a well-rehearsed answer: \"What I would say about the nepotism thing is that in all walks of life, whether it's the police, doctors or going into the family law firm, there are examples of children following their parents' footsteps. That's also been true in parliament going back many generations \u2013 there are actually now many fewer than there were in the past.\"\n\nWill Straw has fared better than other sons of New Labour ministers. David Prescott, pictured with father John, failed to be selected as a prospective MP last year. Photograph: Tony Kyriacou/Rex Features\n\nIt's worth noting that Straw has fared better than the sons of others who sat on the frontbench with his dad: David Prescott, son of the former deputy leader John Prescott, last year failed to be selected in Greenwich and Woolwich and, despite persistent rumours, Euan Blair has yet to publicly put himself forward for a Westminster seat.\n\n\"I'm not looking for special treatment,\" insists Straw. \"The people of Rossendale and Darwen can decide if they want me to be their MP or not. That's their prerogative.\"\n\nHe adds: \"Actually, I followed in my mum's footsteps for the first half of my career as a civil servant. I don't want anyone to vote for me or against me because of the surname.\"\n\nAnd anyway, he says, \"I was selected for a marginal seat, not a safe seat, in an open contest by the local members here.\" Since 2010 the constituency has been held by a young Tory, Jake Berry. A famous surname alone will not overturn his 4,493 majority. A number of local Labour members insist Straw was not parachuted in by the national executive but was a popular choice already well known after spending many weekends of his childhood in the area \u2013 \"some of our members have known him since he was a bairn,\" says one councillor, Andy McNae, who eventually lost out to Straw in a head-to-head race. \"It was not a stitch-up.\"\n\nEducated at a London state school, Straw studied politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford and won a Fulbright to study economic policy at Columbia University in New York. He then worked at the Treasury before a stint at the Centre for Democratic Progress thinktank in the US helping with Barack Obama's first election campaign, eventually ending up a policy wonk at the IPPR.\n\nHe talks passionately about the devastating effect the economic crisis and the cuts have had on the towns of east Lancashire. But what does he know about suffering on minimum wage having spent his whole career in the cosseted bubble of politics and thinktanks?\n\nJack Straw campaigns in his Blackburn constituency in 2005. One councillor said local Labour members have known Will Straw \u2018since he was a bairn\u2019 because of childhood weekends in the area. Photograph: Christopher Thomond\n\n\"Well,\" he says, \"there's nothing like going out on the doorstep night after night, weekend after weekend to get a sense of what their issues are. And through the visits to children's centres to factories you get a real sense of what people's concerns are.\" And anyway, he does have some real life experience: \"All the way when I was a sixth-former and at university I had jobs working in a warehouse, packing boxes, working in an accounts department of car showrooms, working in a psychiatric unit. So I have done jobs, more as holiday jobs, that have given me a real understanding of the issues facing people not just in managerial jobs and the struggles people face in their day-to-day lives.\"\n\nAsked who his political idol is, he initially plumps for Nelson Mandela, before saying that among the living, he \"really admires what Tony Blair and Gordon Brown did in their first term\". Given the widespread disdain for both men among the party grassroots, it's a bold choice \u2013 he could have gone for someone easy, like Alan Johnson. He's also proud of his dad. Despite clashing over the Iraq war, Straw talks fondly of \"the tremendous things he was doing in Blackburn, but also on gay rights, relations with Turkey and Iran when he was foreign secretary, the youth justice stuff he did as home secretary.\"\n\nLast month Straw ended up in the press for the wrong reasons once again, coming under fire for posing for a picture with a potential constituent whose face was blacked up: one of the Britannia Coconut Dancers of Bacup, a 158-year-old troupe of Lancastrian clog dancers who perform every Easter with blackened faces purporting to represent the town's mining past.\n\nStraw said he has been \"overwhelmed\" by the supportive messages he has received from locals as a result. \"But,\" he adds, \"what I've also tried to do is reach out to some of the people from the black and Asian community, the minority ethnic community, who felt very offended by it \u2013 not from here, I've not had anybody from Rossendale from any background objecting.\" He concedes that he wouldn't black up himself. \"But I don't have mining heritage\".\n\nThe controversy brought back memories of the fuss his dad caused when he admitted to asking Muslim constituents to take off their veils when they met him for private meetings, calling the niqab \"such a visible statement of separation and of difference\".\n\nThough of course Straw the younger would rather we stopped the comparisons altogether. \"What I want to do is prove myself and the thing I have to contend with is that often I will be described as Jack Straw's son, which is fair enough \u2013 it's a fact. But I also want to establish myself in my own right and show people what I can do.\""}]}
