The February revolution resulted in the abdication of Tsar Nicholas and a coalition of the Parliament and workers parties taking control of the government. The October revolution resulted in Lenin and the Bolsheviks taking complete control.\n\nIn 1931, at the age of just 14 years old, William was alive when on May 1st, the Empire State Building opened in New York City. At 1,454 feet (including the roof and antenna), it was the tallest building in the world until the World Trade Center's North Tower was built in 1970. (It is now the 34th tallest.) Opening at the beginning of the Great Depression, most of the offices in the Empire State Building remained unoccupied for years and the observation deck was an equal source of revenue and kept the building profitable.\n\nIn 1965, by the time he was 48 years old, from August 11 to 16, riots broke out in Watts, a Black section of Los Angeles. An allegedly drunk African-American driver was stopped by LA police and, after a fight, police brutality was alleged - and the riots began. 34 people died in the rioting and over $40 million in property damage occurred. The National Guard was called in to help the LA police quell rioting.\n\nIn 1972, by the time he was 55 years old, on November 7th, Richard Nixon won re-election, amidst the dawning knowledge of the Watergate scandal, by 60.7% to anti-war candidate George McGovern's 37.5%.\n\nIn 1990, when he was 73 years old, after 27 years in prison, Nelson Mandela, the leader of the movement to end South African apartheid was released on February 11th 1990."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/55416255/william-white-quinn", "page_content": "There is a problem with your email/password.\n\nWe\u2019ve updated the security on the site.

Two inmates and one corrections officer, 28-year-old William \u201cBilly\u201d Quinn, were killed by inmates. When inmates first seized control, several corrections officers were severely beaten, at least two inmates were raped and the schoolhouse, chapel and other buildings were torched.\n\nSixty-one inmates or former inmates were indicted for crimes committed during the riot, including murder charges against John Hill and Charles Pernasilice, who were accused of beating Quinn to death after Quinn unsuccessfully attempted to secure a prison gate against inmates charging against it. When the gate gave way, Hill allegedly used a 2-by-4 board to beat Quinn so severely that he sustained two open skull fractures. Quinn\u2019s hands and arms were also severely injured as he tried to protect himself. Quinn died in the hospital two days after four inmates carried Quinn on a mattress to the administration building, where they pleaded with officials to get him to a hospital.\n\nPernasilice was only convicted of a misdemeanor. Hill was convicted of murder. A May 9,1975, New York Times article described what Hill, who would be sentenced to 20 years to life, said at his sentencing. He called his trial \u201cthe most sickening and outrageous display of justice I have ever seen.\u201d Hill claimed he and Pernasilice were framed because of their Native American ethnicity.\n\nNo law enforcement personnel had been indicted for killing of hostages and inmates or for the brutal retaliations against subdued inmates; 83 inmates were hurt seriously enough to require medical treatment. In order to have \u201ceven-handedness\u201d in justice, in 1976 Gov. Hugh Carey announced amnesty for all riot-related crimes. Consequently, Hill was released from prison.\n\nHill became a television and film actor, as well as a Native American actionist. He died in 2013.\n\nIn her extraordinary memoir, \u201cThe Prison Guard\u2019s Daughter: My Journey Through the Ashes of Attica,\u201d Deanne Quinn Miller describes an occasion in 2011 when Miller was on a panel titled \u201cLooking Back: The Attica Rising and its Aftermath.\u201d During the presentation, Miller received a text message from a friend in the audience that Hill was seated near her. During a Q&A session, a former prison inmate who was then working with nonprofit prison reform organizations, asked Miller if Hill \u201cwas to come in and say, \u2018Can you forgive me for what I did?\u2019 Could you open your heart if he was sincere? Could you forgive him?\u201d Caught off guard by these questions, Miller\u2019s response was somewhat vague.\n\nI wonder if this man posed such questions at Hill\u2019s request. Did Hill\u2019s conscience bother him \u2014 notwithstanding his innocence claims? Miller\u2019s book has additional information that reinforce my belief that Hill killed Quinn.\n\nSeveral inmates tried to rescue Quinn. Miller would learn that the consensus among inmates was that Quinn was genuinely concerned for inmates\u2019 well-being. The inmates respected Quinn. One former inmate, who was 5 feet 2 inches tall and slightly built when he was at Attica, revealed that Quinn made sure he wasn\u2019t harmed by other inmates. \u201cHe was like a guardian angel,\u201d he said of Quinn.\n\nAn honor guard of several hundred corrections officers and firemen from all over New York led Quinn\u2019s funeral procession through downtown Attica.\n\nMiller explains that \u201cWhen my mom and dad first married, Dad worked as an attendant at the West Seneca Developmental Center, a facility that oversaw the care of institutionalized people with a range of disabilities. He grew close to the residents, one in particular, raising money from staff for a wig for a teenage girl who suffered from alopecia. She was so fond of my dad that he once took my mother to meet her. She tipped her wig at mom as if tipping a hat. My father left that job after a young boy died in his arms after a seizure. That was too much for him; he told my mother he could not return \u2014 it was just too painful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Prison Guard\u2019s Daughter\u201d is also the story of the formation, endeavors and accomplishments of the Forgotten Victims of Attica, an organization in which Miller remains involved, made up of surviving hostages and the families of Attica employees who were killed or wounded during the inmate takeover and the retaking of the prison.\n\nHere is a compelling story of tragedy, courage, betrayal, tribulations, perseverance and triumph, a story that, with the help of co-author and Rochester Democrat & Chronicle investigative reporter Gary Craig, captivates readers. We witness the closure process unravel for Miller, other victims\u2019 families and former inmates who Miller befriended. We also witness the life-altering lessons Miller has learned during a remarkable voyage that crosses racial and criminal justice system divides.\n\nI sensed a powerful father-daughter connection that transcends death as I contemplated the words of Malcolm Bell, former state prosecutor in the Attica uprising investigation: \u201cIf Bill Quinn had survived, he would surely be proud of what Dea (Miller\u2019s nickname) accomplished. I believe that in whatever hereafter awaits us, he is very proud of her.\u201d\n\nI believe Quinn, the father of three daughters, would be proud of his entire family and several other people whose memorable stories appear in \u201cThe Prison Guard\u2019s Daughter.\u201d\n\nAs a result of a long, tumultuous and continuing journey, Miller has helped to attain some semblance of justice \u2014 for herself and for other previously forgotten victims of the Attica tragedy \u2014 while simultaneously not only finding her father, but also finding previously hidden parts of herself during what became a revealing voyage of self-discovery.\n\nJoel Freedman, of Canandaigua, is a frequent Messenger Post contributor."}, {"url": "https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/william-v-quinn-birth-1913-death-1990/14635081", "page_content": "Refresh this page to see various historical events that occurred during William's lifetime.\n\nIn 1913, in the year that William v Quinn was born, Woodrow Wilson became the 28th President of the United States in March. Previously the Governor of New Jersey and President of Princeton University, he was the first Southerner to serve as President since Zachary Taylor, over 60 years previous. A Democrat, he led the U.S. during World War I and championed the League of Nations.\n\nIn 1935, by the time he was 22 years old, on August 14, the Social Security Act was signed into law. The purpose was to \"provide federal assistance to those unable to work\". The law established the Social Security Administration whose primary focus was to \"provide aid for the elderly, the unemployed, and children\". The Act survived many Supreme Court challenges and the Administration continues until today.\n\nIn 1951, by the time he was 38 years old, on April 5th, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg (husband and wife) were sentenced to death for treason. They were executed on June 19th. American citizens, they were convicted of spying for the Soviet Union. Their two young sons were adopted by a high school teacher and his wife.\n\nIn 1985, he was 72 years old when on March 15th, the first internet domain name was registered - Symbolics.com. Symbolics, Inc., a spinoff of the MIT AI Lab, was a computer manufacturer headquartered in Massachusetts. The company no longer exists and the domain name was sold 25 years later.\n\nIn 1990, in the year of William v Quinn's passing, on April 24th, the Hubble telescope was launched into space after long delays due to the Challenger explosion. An optical flaw was found within weeks of launch but was fixed within three years. The discoveries made possible by the Hubble have contributed to scientists' understanding of the universe."}, {"url": "https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/william-quinn-birth-1938-death-1983/16220767", "page_content": "Refresh this page to see various historical events that occurred during William's lifetime.\n\nIn 1938, in the year that William Quinn was born, on October 30th, a Sunday, The Mercury Theatre on the Air broadcast Orson Welles' special Halloween show The War of the World's. A clever take on H.G. Wells' novel, the show began with simulated \"breaking news\" of an invasion by Martians. Because of the realistic nature of the \"news,\" there was a public outcry the next day, calling for regulation by the FCC. Although the current story is that many were fooled and panicked, in reality very few people were fooled. But the show made Orson Welles' career.\n\nIn 1940, by the time he was just 2 years old, in July, Billboard published its first Music Popularity Chart. Top recordings of the year were Tommy Dorsey's \"I'll Never Smile Again\" (vocal Frank Sinatra) - 12 weeks at the top, Bing Crosby's \"Only Forever\" - 9 weeks at the top, and Artie Shaw's \"Frenesi\" - 12 weeks at the top.\n\nIn 1951, by the time he was just 13 years old, on February 27th, the 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution (which limited the number of terms a president may serve to two) was ratified by 36 states, making it a part of the U.S. Constitution. The Amendment was both a reaction to the 4 term Roosevelt presidency and also the recognition of a long-standing tradition in American politics.\n\nIn 1973, when he was 35 years old, in October, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned - President Nixon nominated Gerald Ford for Vice President. Nixon's tax returns came under investigation. Nixon offered the recently discovered Oval Office tapes be heard by one person and summarized - his offer was rejected by the Special Prosecutor. Nixon ordered the Attorney General, then the assistant Attorney General, to fire the Special Prosecutor. Both refused and were fired. The Solicitor General became the acting Attorney General and fired the Special Prosecutor (the Saturday Night Massacre). Nixon releases some of the tapes, under extreme pressure because of the firings.\n\nIn 1983, in the year of William Quinn's passing, on August 30th, the Soviet Union claimed that a South Korean Boeing 747 jetliner (Flight 007), bound for Seoul from New York City, had strayed into Soviet airspace. Saying that they believed it to be a U.S. spy plane, the passenger jet was shot down by a Soviet SU-15 fighter - after it had tracked the airliner for two hours. All 269 passengers (including a U.S. Representative from Georgia) and crew were killed."}]}
