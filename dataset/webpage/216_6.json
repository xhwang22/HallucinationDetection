In their first game, they defeated the St. Louis Hawks 97-84 on Dec. 26, 1964 in what became the first of 14 straight wins with the new starting five (Boston had won its two previous games prior to inserting Naulls into the starting five). That helped set the tone for the franchise\u2019s 7th straight NBA title, and 8th overall.\n\nIn addition to Naulls, the starting five for that game included Satch Sanders, Sam Jones, K.C. Jones and Bill Russell \u2013 all Naismith Memorial Hall of Famers in addition to being the only black players on the Celtics roster at that time.\n\nWhile there was certainly a heightened sense of social consciousness throughout the country at that time, Red Auerbach was a coach consumed by winning and because of that, didn\u2019t initially recognize the historical significance of putting Naulls in with the first unit.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I had no idea that I started five black players until a writer pointed it out to me a few weeks later,\u201d Auerbach said at the time. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make a difference to me what color any of my players were. I was putting the five best players out on the court so that we could win.\u201d\n\nBeing part of the first all-Black starting five was just part of the history-making narrative surrounding Naulls.\n\nHe spent his first seven seasons with the New York Knicks and served as a team captain for the last three. Naulls was the first Black captain in New York Knicks history and one of the first for any major professional sports team.\n\nDuring his career, the 6-foot-6 Naulls, known for his one-handed outside shot, was a four-time All-Star (1958; 1960-1962) who was a career 15.8 points per game scorer who left New York as one of the franchise\u2019s all-time leader scorers.\n\nSensing he could be of some help to the Boston Celtics in their quest to win yet another championship, Auerbach convinced Naulls to join forces with the Celtics.\n\n\u201cHe was one of the famous guys Red (Auerbach) enticed to come out of retirement,\u201d Heinsohn said.\n\nUpon retirement, the former UCLA star went into real estate and commercial development in addition to activating several community-based initiatives designed to aid youth.\n\nThat would serve as a precursor to his true calling as a pastor.\n\n\u201cThe main factors contributing to my success have been, first, the wisdom of my parents in seeing that I received a disciplined Christian upbringing and the best education available and, second, my good fortune in having achieved a high and rare degree of success in athletics,\u201d Naulls said in a curriculum vita obtained by NBC Sports Boston. \u201cAs an adult, I can reflect back and realize how blessed I am to have escaped the perpetuation of mediocrity foisted upon most African-American people. Even though I have had the opportunity of meeting and associating with the \u201celite\u201d of our society, I have always understood that my successes were a deviation from the norm, and I have never stopped agonizing over the plight of poor, underprivileged people who have not experienced the benefits of a mother\u2019s unselfish sacrifice and vision to equip her children.\n\nNaulls added, \u201cThe insecurities that I felt growing up in a disadvantaged community I have never\n\nforgotten. These memories have directly influenced my life\u2019s commitment to serve young people of all ethnic backgrounds who would commit themselves to the pursuit of Truth and excellence. I was taught very early the value of a positive attitude about working toward becoming the best that I could be. Young people are our most valuable resource, and my life\u2019s goal is to bring together prepared and committed teachers who will share their specific knowledge and wisdom with youth who commit themselves to preparing to become positive and productive members of our society.\u201d\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
