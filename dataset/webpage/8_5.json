{"Freddie Frith was willing to help other riders.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/free-riding", "page_content": "free riding, benefiting from a collective good without having incurred the costs of participating in its production.\n\nThe problem of free riding was articulated analytically in The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups (1965) by the American political economist Mancur Olson. Relying on an instrumental conception of rationality, according to which rational individuals make choices that they believe will bring about the outcomes they most prefer, Olson argued that there is little rational incentive for individuals to contribute to the production of a public (or common) good, given the costs they would incur, because they will benefit from the public good whether or not they contribute. (One of the defining characteristics of a public good is that everyone benefits from it.) Olson\u2019s thesis, which suggested that group mobilization to advance a common interest may be difficult, challenged the assumption of the pluralist school in political science, according to which individuals readily mobilize to defend the interests of the groups to which they belong.\n\nA familiar example of free riding is a partly unionized workplace. Benefits that result from trade union activity (such as improved working conditions and pay raises) accrue to all employees, including those who do not belong to the union. Although the benefits would be smaller or nonexistent if most workers had behaved rationally by free riding (i.e., by not belonging to the union and thus not paying union dues), each worker has a rational incentive to free ride. According to Olson, unions sought to overcome this difficulty through the use of selective incentives, benefits that would be available only to members of the union. Unions and other organizations have also adopted other devices to prevent or limit free riding, such as the closed shop.\n\nOthers besides those organizations and groups face the problem of free riding. The state, for example, seeks to address the issue by taxing citizens to fund public goods and services. Anthony Downs\u2019s An Economic Theory of Democracy (1957) implicitly highlights the problem of free riding in relation to democracy. It is rational for an individual voter not to vote, given the costs associated with voting and the infinitesimal chance of influencing the electoral outcome.\n\nThe concept of free riding has also been used to analyze problems of environmental politics. Garret Hardin wrote in the article \u201cThe Tragedy of the Commons\u201d (1968) that the exploitation and degradation of the environment is set to continue. It is rational for corporations to free ride, given the costs of individual action, which affect profits and competitiveness in an international economy. For states, managing environmental concerns places an individual burden on them relative to regulation and expenditure from taxes. Therefore, there is little incentive for individual states or corporations to do anything other than free ride. Yet, collectively, this is the worst possible outcome for the environment. This highlights the fundamental concern at the heart of Olson\u2019s identification of this issue\u2014that individually rational behaviour (i.e., free riding) is likely to produce collectively irrational outcomes."}, {"url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2020/02/29/809740346/the-cruel-story-behind-the-reverse-freedom-rides", "page_content": "The Cruel Story Behind The 'Reverse Freedom Rides'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Frank C. Curtin/AP Frank C. Curtin/AP\n\nAfter three days on a Greyhound bus, Lela Mae Williams was just an hour from her destination\u2014Hyannis, Mass.\u2014when she asked the bus driver to pull over. She needed to change into her finest clothes. She had been promised the Kennedy family would be waiting for her.\n\nIt was late on a Wednesday afternoon, nearly 60 years ago, when that Greyhound bus from Little Rock, Ark., pulled into Hyannis. It slowed to a stop near the summer home of President John F. Kennedy and his family. When the doors opened, Lela Mae and her nine youngest children stepped onto the pavement.\n\nReporters' microphones pointed at her, their cameras trained on her family. The photographs in the next day's newspaper show Lela Mae looking immaculate. In an elegant black dress, a triple string of pearls and a white hat, she was dressed to start a new life.\n\n\"She was going to have a job, and she was going to be able to support her family,\" one of Lela Mae's daughters, Betty Williams, remembered in a recent interview. Before coming north to Massachusetts, Lela Mae had been promised a good job, good housing and a presidential welcome.\n\nBut President Kennedy was not there to meet her. And there was no job or permanent housing waiting for her in Hyannis. Instead, Lela Mae and the others were unwitting pawns in a segregationist game.\n\n\"It was one of the most inhuman things I have ever seen,\" recalled Margaret Moseley, a longtime civil rights activist in Hyannis, in a televised interview a few years before her death.\n\nFuming over the civil rights movement, Southern segregationists had concocted a way to retaliate against Northern liberals. In 1962, they tricked about 200 African Americans from the South into moving north. The idea was simple: When large numbers of African Americans showed up on Northern doorsteps, Northerners would not be able to accommodate them. They would not want them, and their hypocrisy would be exposed.\n\nThe Reverse Freedom Rides have largely disappeared from the country's collective memory. The scheme almost never appears in history books and is little-known even in Hyannis, the primary target of the ploy. But some hear echoes of that segregationist past in America's present. And for the families that came to the North based on a lie, the journey has cast an enduring shadow on their lives.\n\nThe segregationists' game\n\nIn the summer of 1961, black and white activists, who became known as the Freedom Riders, boarded Greyhound buses and crisscrossed the South with the goal of integrating interstate buses and bus terminals. When the buses pulled into Southern cities, they were greeted by mobs armed with bats and firebombs.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nSouthern segregationists, who were still furious over the school desegregation fights that dominated the 1950s, saw the Freedom Riders as sanctimonious provocateurs. In a television interview from the time, Ned Touchstone of Louisiana\u2014a spokesperson for a local segregationist group\u2014said the North was \"sending down busloads of people here with the express purpose of violating our laws, fomenting confusion, trying to destroy 100 years of workable tradition and good relations between the races.\"\n\nTouchstone and other segregationists thought there was no way the Freedom Riders or their fellow Northern liberals actually cared about integrating interstate transit or advancing civil rights. Instead, they were convinced it was a strategy to embarrass the South and capture black votes for the Democratic party.\n\nThe segregationists decided to answer the Freedom Rides with the \"Reverse Freedom Rides.\" They would use the same weapon\u2014Greyhound buses\u2014and send African Americans to Northern cities.\n\n\"For many years, certain politicians, educators and certain religious leaders have used the white people of the South as a whipping boy, to put it mildly, to further their own ends and their political campaigns,\" said Amis Guthridge, a lawyer from Arkansas who helped spearhead the Reverse Freedom Rides. \"We're going to find out if people like Ted Kennedy ... and the Kennedys, all of them, really do have an interest in the Negro people, really do have a love for the Negro.\"\n\nMy mom thought that when she came to the North, she was going to have a better life for her children.\n\nThe segregationists tapped into a network of local groups called Citizens' Councils. Despite the sanitized name, the councils were essentially \"the Ku Klux Klan without the hoods and the masks,\" said historian Clive Webb.\n\nWebb, a professor at the University of Sussex in England, specializes in studying racists. Fifteen years ago, he published the first\u2014and still the only\u2014major academic article on the Reverse Freedom Riders.\n\nThe Citizens' Councils attempted to cloak their racism in respectability, Webb said. They held meetings in fancy downtown hotels and wore suits and ties.\"They could be members of the police force,\" said Webb. \"They could be bankers, businessmen and the like.\"\n\nThese men masterminded an advertising effort, with flyers and radio commercials, to attract African Americans to accept bus tickets, bought with money the councils had raised. Their ideal recruits were single mothers with many children, and men who had gotten entangled in the criminal justice system.\n\n\"They targeted people who were either welfare recipients or prison inmates,\" said Webb. \"People who were placing a burden, as they saw it, on public resources.\"\n\nThen, they sought media attention. George Singelmann of Louisiana, who claimed credit for the original idea, had once worked in a newsroom. He made sure to alert the press.\n\n\"Negro 'Ride' Plan Stirs New Furor\" read a front-page headline in The New York Times. The Boston Herald added, \"14 More Jobless Negroes Sent North.\" As spring rolled into summer and then fall, nearly daily articles chronicled the scheme as it unfolded.\n\nRelishing the coverage, Guthridge said in an interview, \"If it takes two weeks, two months, two years, five or 10 years, we will continue it until the white people up there ... tell those politicians we are tired of using the American Negro for a pawn just for their votes.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Bourdier/AP Jim Bourdier/AP\n\nBut when talking to reporters, the segregationists were not always so transparent about their motives. They offered ever-changing justifications for the scheme.\n\nNed Touchstone said his primary motivation was \"to bring about a more equitable distribution of the colored population.\" He added that African Americans were begging for assistance.\"Is it a crime to help people who come to you and say, 'Boss man, I want to go to the North'?\" he said.\n\nSingelmann cited American tradition as the rationale for the Reverse Freedom Rides.\"Our forefathers put everything in their possession into covered wagons and went out across the plains. In those days, it was rugged Americanism. Now today, for some reason or other, it's being frowned upon. I don't understand it,\" he said.\n\nThe Citizens Councils' plan didn't quite work how they had wanted; they'd envisioned sending thousands north, but the reality amounted to a couple hundred. Those folks boarded buses to New York, New Hampshire, Indiana, Idaho, Minnesota, California and elsewhere. Lela Mae Williams and her children were part of the 96 unwitting Reverse Freedom Riders who arrived at a makeshift bus stop closest to the Kennedys' \"summer White House\" on Cape Cod. They were far, far away from their rural Arkansas home.\n\nThe Williams family of Arkansas\n\nFor generations, the Williams family lived on the border of Louisiana and Arkansas. Betty and Mickey were born in the tiny town of Huttig, Ark. They had a little farm and a big family.\n\nBetty Williams, who was 18 years old when the family moved north, recalled the joy of fishing in the pond out back and scampering down the path to relatives' houses. But her memories are also colored by the trauma of whippings by the school headmaster and relatives dying without a doctor to visit.\n\n\"I remember the flooding in the house, snakes underneath the beds,\" said Mickey Williams, one of Betty's brothers. He was five when the family left Huttig, and his memories of the South are few and faded. But he does remember that the family struggled financially.\"We were poor,\" he said. \"We were really poor.\"\n\nStill, Mickey and Betty said, their late mother, Lela Mae managed to cook all their meals from scratch and insisted on schooling for every child.\n\nAt the time, Arkansas was segregated, and the Williams family was confined to the black side of town. Growing up, Betty didn't know anyone who was white.\n\n\"[I] never thought about why we were separated like this, why we can't go to school together, why we can't sit and eat together. I never even questioned that,\" she said.\n\nBut Betty's mother was aware of the political forces that swirled outside their three-room house, and she wanted better things. So when she heard about buses heading up north and promises of jobs and housing, she was enticed. And when she heard the Kennedys would greet the travelers, she was even more enthusiastic; she kept portraits of John and Robert F. Kennedy hanging on a wall next to one of Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\n\"My mom thought that when she came to the North, she was going to have a better life for her children, better jobs and better housing,\" said Betty. \"Everything that a mom could do, everything within her power, everything within her reach, my mom did it.\" So Lela Mae accepted tickets to take her family up north.\n\nThe Sunday after the school year was finished, two cars came to pick up Lela Mae and her nine youngest children\u2014ages two to 14\u2014and take them 150 miles to Little Rock's bus terminal. (Betty would follow on a different bus later that summer.) Amis Guthridge himself drove them, and bought the children ice cream and root beer.\n\nThe segregationist lawyer had alerted the local news outlets that he'd be holding a press conference when they arrived. At the bus terminal, he stood at the center of a small crew of journalists. Ernie Dumas, a young reporter for The Arkansas Gazette, was there.\n\n\"He made a little grinning speech,\" Dumas, now 81, recalled. Guthridge, pointed to the family and said, \"These fine, fine people. This wonderful woman and her fine little children,\" Dumas remembered. He thinks he saw Guthridge wink at his fellow segregationists, who sat off to the side.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Frank C. Curtin/AP Frank C. Curtin/AP\n\nThen, he remembers that Guthridge said, \"We're going to send them up to Massachusetts, and the Kennedys and those fine people up there are going to take care of them and give them a better life.\"\n\nDumas was not able to interview Lela Mae that May day in 1962, but he remembers her seeming a little reluctant, perhaps a little embarrassed.\n\nIn silent TV footage taken at the bus station, she looked focused. Some of the kids seemed giddy, flashing smiles at the camera and playing with a well-loved rabbit doll. Others were subdued, sitting quietly in pairs on the wooden benches in the waiting room. The family had very little luggage; after all, most of the Reverse Freedom Riders were told everything was going to be provided.\n\nAfter the press conference, Lela Mae herded her children onto the bus, toward the back of the bus and then onward, toward a promise that was a lie.\n\n\"We called them refugees\"\n\nIn the weeks before the Williams family boarded the Greyhound bus, the very first Reverse Freedom Rider to come to Hyannis arrived on May 12, 1962.\n\nDavid Harris, a 43-year-old army veteran in a suit and tie, received an enthusiastic welcome by a crowd of more than 100 people. There were several speeches, plenty of hands to shake and lots of reporters. Senate candidate Ted Kennedy was there to meet him. Harris drew cheers when he told onlookers it \"felt mighty good when I crossed that Mason-Dixon line.\"\n\nIn the weeks and months to come, the Greyhound buses kept arriving, but the spectators disappeared. Ted Kennedy never showed up again. The rest of the Kennedy family never made an appearance. Only a small crew of Hyannis residents, including the civil rights activist Margaret Moseley, remained.\n\nHearing media reports that more Reverse Freedom Riders were on their way, religious leaders, the local NAACP chapter and a few concerned residents teamed up to help. The group was half black, half white. They divided the tasks and gave themselves a name: The Refugee Relief Committee.\n\n\"We called them refugees. They represented what we feel a refugee is. They were homeless, broke, tired and afraid. We had to help them,\" Rev. Kenneth Warren, a Unitarian minister who was the chairman of the committee, said to a reporter at the time.\n\nThat summer of 1962, Moseley carried the bus schedule with her. Among her many duties, she was in charge of greeting the new arrivals.\"Most of the people who came had only a shopping bag with perhaps one change of clothing,\" said the late Moseley in an interview with Tales of Cape Cod in 1994, three years before her death. The Reverse Freedom Riders arrived with \"no money, knowing nobody.\"\n\nMoseley remembered one of the children who arrived asking, \"Where are the cotton fields?\" She told him there were no cotton fields. She said this news came as a terrible blow. She recalled the child saying, \"Well, what am I going to do to find employment? I can chop cotton. I don't know how to do anything else.\"\n\nThe committee scrambled to help, convincing the local community college to open its dorms to the new arrivals. The local jail provided the bedding. And when the summer semester started and students came back to the dorms, they got the governor to lobby for nearby Otis Air Force Base to open its barracks.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Walter Green/AP J. Walter Green/AP\n\nAt Otis, the rules were strict. Curfew was at 8 p.m., and lights were out at 8:30 p.m. Boys older than five were to be housed in barracks separate from their mothers. Heat and proximity to latrines were luxuries, not to be expected.\"They will be treated with firmness, with civility, with fairness, but not with familiarity,\" wrote Major Gen. Thomas Donnelly, the man in charge of the base. \"The basic attitude is that these are people with problems that we are trying to help in finding solutions.\"\n\nBut their efforts didn't stave off accusations from the segregationists that Hyannis was practicing forced segregation. In his effort to prove that white Northerners were indeed as racist as white Southerners, Singelmann told reporters that Otis Air Force Base was equivalent to a \"concentration camp.\"\n\nBetty never thought of life in Massachusetts as a concentration camp but, she said, things weren't easy. \"I used to never smile that much. I never smiled. I don't know why that was,\" said Betty, who joined her mother and nine siblings in the fall of 1962. She was 18 and eight months pregnant at the time, with her 2-year-old son in tow. Her older sister, Gloria, and her two children also came in the fall.\n\nAs the committee tried to disperse the Reverse Freedom Riders so it would be easier for them to find work, the Williams family was sent 100 miles north to Newburyport, Mass. And Betty did find work cleaning houses. While she noticed the kindness of the townspeople, she said there was also a nagging feeling of distance and difference.\n\nShe realized that Northerners \"don't think the same; they don't do the same. The culture is a whole lot different from where we were raised.\"\n\n\"A rather cheap exercise\"\n\nAs the Reverse Freedom Riders adjusted to their new lives, the country around them debated whether to intervene.\n\nIllinois' governor compared the Reverse Freedom Rides to Nazis deporting Jews. A Mississippi congressman delighted in watching the North squirm, saying, \"They want to 'free' the Negro in the South, but want to shun responsibility for him once he has been 'freed.'\" Gov. John Volpe of Massachusetts pledged to help, but worried his welfare budget would be depleted. He asked the federal government to step in.\n\nPresident Kennedy largely tried to avoid the topic. When worried and enraged citizens wrote letters to the White House, the standard reply was that the situation was \"deplorable\" but \"there is no violation of law.\" When Kennedy was asked about it at a news conference, he paused before saying, \"Well I think it's, uh, a rather cheap exercise in ....\" He hesitated, stumbled and tried to dodge the question for more than a minute.\n\nConversely, there were those who wrote hate mail to the Refugee Relief Committee about how the Bible calls for segregation, and even sending gag gifts\u2014including a live opossum and a goat to Hyannis for the Reverse Freedom Riders to eat.\n\nBut the prevailing sentiment was that the Reverse Freedom Rides exposed the callousness of the Southern segregationists, not the hypocrisy of Northern liberals. Private citizens from across the country wrote to offer their support. Some suggested housing the Reverse Freedom Riders in their own towns and homes; others wrote checks. The first donation arrived from Little Rock, where many of the Reverse Freedom Rides originated.\n\nBy the late fall, the scheme fizzled out unceremoniously. Funds that the Citizens' Councils had raised were drying up, and riders were hard to recruit. Betty Williams was the very last Reverse Freedom Rider to arrive in Hyannis, disembarking from her Greyhound Bus on October 17.\n\nBut even when it was over, the Williams family and the other Reverse Freedom Riders were still 1,000 miles from anything that resembled home.\n\nThe Williams family of Massachusetts\n\nLike many of those sent to Hyannis, the Williams family ultimately moved to Boston in search of work. They lived in one of the city's most notorious housing projects: the Bromley-Heath Apartments. Milkmen and furniture deliverymen were rumored to dodge the premises.\n\n\"The projects were nothing to be proud of,\" recalled Mickey. His memories of the place are dotted with cockroach sightings and crumbling concrete.\n\nShe tried with every ounce of strength that she had to try to hold this family together.\n\nAs she had done in the South, Lela Mae tried to make life for her children as stable as possible in an unstable situation. She gathered discarded tires, filled them with dirt and turned them into flowerbeds among the dilapidated brick apartment buildings.\n\nBut apart from the flowers, things were collapsing. With their support network and their relatives half a country away, their tight-knit family began to fray, Betty said. Things the Williams family had never experienced in their tiny Southern town\u2014drugs, jail and unfriendly neighbors\u2014started to define their lives. \"Things weren't like that when we were in the South,\" Betty said. \"All this happened when we came here.\"\n\nOne thing from the South, though, had followed the family to the North: racism.\n\n\"We were being attacked in school by white kids,\" Mickey said, recalling Boston's efforts to desegregate through busing during his high school years. \"I just remembered that they were all outside surrounding the school. White people, white kids. Young guys, old guys. They had dogs. They had chains. They were trying to get into the school.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption PJH/AP PJH/AP\n\nThis wasn't what Lela Mae had envisioned for her children. From one of Boston's harshest street corners, during one of the city's worst chapters, \"she tried with every ounce of strength that she had to try to hold this family together,\" said Betty. After years of processing what happened to their family, Betty and Mickey said they have resolved not to focus their energy on the segregationists who tricked their family. \"I don't want no hatred to live in my heart. Nowhere. I don't have room for that,\" Betty said.\n\nMickey, who has been working on a series of children's books about little-known African Americans who have done remarkable things, has spent years flipping through history books unearthing forgotten stories. But it's only recently, he said, that he started to think that his own family's journey might have a place in history.\n\nEchoes of the past in America's present\n\nIn April 2019, historian Clive Webb was cooking in his kitchen with the radio playing when a news story came on. He paused as he heard President Donald Trump explain his idea of putting undocumented immigrants on buses and dropping them off in so-called \"sanctuary cities.\"\n\n\"They want more people in the sanctuary cites. Well, we'll give them more people. We can give them a lot. We can give them an unlimited supply,\" Trump declared at a news conference. \"And let's see if they're so happy. They're always saying, 'We have open arms.' Let's see if they have open arms.\"\n\nAt the kitchen counter, Webb said, he thought back to segregationists like Amis Guthridge who had said the same of the Kennedy family and black people. \"In 1962, what was happening was the actions of a political fringe group,\" said Webb, \"And in 2019, it's the federal government.\" (There is no evidence that the Trump administration has enacted the policy, and the White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)\n\nAccording to Webb, the story of the Reverse Freedom Rides is not a tale of how the United States is battling the same foes forever. Instead, he said, it is a reminder of how bystanders can foil a racist plot. \"The white conservatives, who were behind that campaign then, actually underestimated the decency of many ordinary people,\" Webb said.\n\nBut the story has been largely forgotten by the next generation of Americans. Even the Williams family tried to forget. Both Mickey and Betty said their mother never talked about the trick that was played on her.\n\n\"She never discussed anything. Nothing. Nothing at all,\" said Mickey. \"She didn't want to burden us. It was just pride.\"\n\nThe white conservatives, who were behind that campaign then, actually underestimated the decency of many ordinary people.\n\nIt might have been that pride or perhaps the haziness of the segregationists' lies, but the Williams' family lore somehow became that they were Freedom Riders, not Reverse Freedom Riders. Jahmal Williams, one of Betty's sons and a professional skateboarder, said that growing up, whenever stories about the Civil Rights Movement would flicker past on TV, his mother would say, \"We played a part in this.\"\n\nIt was only when his grandmother, Lela Mae, passed away in 2013 that Jahmal had an inkling that there was more to know. At her funeral, he saw a pamphlet about the Reverse Freedom Rides. He went home and started Googling.\n\n\"And I was like, 'Whoa,'\" Jahmal recalled. He's still figuring out what to think. \"It was a horrible thing, the game of politics that these guys were playing,\" he said, \"but\u2014at the same time\u2014I would not be here if that game was not played.\""}, {"url": "https://andscape.com/features/a-freedom-rider-recalls-martin-luther-king-jr-and-the-complex-ride-to-civil-rights/", "page_content": "It was a warm May afternoon. May 22. 1961. About 30 activists, mostly of college age, were huddled in the Montgomery, Alabama, mansion of pharmacist Dr. Richard Harris. They were from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and they had two goals.\n\nOne: persuading Martin Luther King Jr. and CORE leader James Farmer to allow them to continue the Freedom Rides to Jackson, Mississippi. Two: They also wanted King to join them. A group of young activists from Nashville, Tennessee, led by Diane Nash, and a group from New Orleans led by activist Oretha Castle had rushed to Montgomery to plead their case as to why the Freedom Rides should continue.\n\nThese young men and women were also convinced that they would die in two days.\n\nBut the CORE and SNCC members, mostly younger and more rambunctious than the 32-year-old King, were determined that the rides should continue despite that certainty \u2014 and believed that he should join them. The pivotal meeting signaled a generation gap in the civil rights movement that endured through its existence. King had never participated in the Freedom Rides and, for some, this signaled a reluctance on his part to put his life in direct risk. That he may have felt too important to join others in the field. But the story is obviously more complicated.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. at First Baptist Church on May 21, 1961.\n\nMy father, David Dennis Sr., was part of the New Orleans contingent and part of that meeting with King. He was a scrawny 20-year-old Dillard University student and had joined the movement after trying to impress the beautiful Castle by joining her at a sit-in at Woolworth\u2019s lunch counters. He\u2019d been assured he wouldn\u2019t be arrested. Well, he sure was arrested and the mistreatment he witnessed in the jails moved him to spend the next few months training Freedom Riders in New Orleans, where hundreds of eventual riders would be taught how to stay calm while being spat on and beaten, how to protect themselves from violence, and how to stay safe in the face of certain danger.\n\nMy father grew into a passionate community organizer and field secretary for CORE. He was integral to the planning of 1964\u2019s Freedom Summer. But in the Montgomery meeting the man who became my dad 25 years later was just a kid who wanted to help.\n\nThe fire he had for equality was there. His longtime friends are quick to tell stories of his passion for civil rights, and his willingness to speak his mind. That intensity is still there 50 years later when I hear him talk about the \u201960s and the \u201970s, and when I hear him speak on current events. It\u2019s hard to imagine my dad being unsure of his place in the fight for civil rights, or unsure of anything, really.\n\n\u201cI was in awe of [King\u2019s] presence,\u201d my father says now. \u201cI was in a dreamland, being around all of these people I\u2019d read about [through the 1950s]. I was wondering if I belonged there.\u201d Though my father would eventually become a field secretary for CORE, when he went to Montgomery he was without a title and just eager to contribute something. And he was overcome by the reality of being in the same room as King in such a tense moment.\n\n\u201cTroops are on the way in from Montgomery now,\u201d King said on the night of May 21.\n\n\u201cThey have requested that all of us stay in here for the time being, that nobody will leave. And may I make another personal request on behalf I think all of us \u2014 that we must be sure that we adhere absolutely to nonviolence. Now it\u2019s very easy for us to get angry and bitter and even violent in a moment like this. But I think this is a testing point. Now, we had to go out a few minutes ago and counsel with some of our own people who were getting to the point of returning to violence. And we don\u2019t want to do that. We can\u2019t do that. We have won the moral victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could feel his spirit in the room,\u201d my father says now. \u201cAs far as I was concerned, he was a leader. But, in that meeting, he was really challenged by a lot of the CORE people.\u201d\n\nThe Freedom Rides were a very organized attempt to protest segregated interstate bus terminals in the South. The plan was to have black and white activists board buses in Washington, D.C., and ride through the Deep South. On May 14, the rides hit a violent roadblock, literally and metaphorically.\n\nA mob had descended on a bus carrying freedom riders through Anniston, Alabama, slashing the tires and smashing the windows. Someone from the mob \u2014 which included parents with kids on their shoulders who watched the violence like it was a sporting event \u2014 tossed an explosive into the bus. The vehicle was filled with smoke and the riders were trapped inside, struggling to breathe. An explosion ripped the rear of the bus apart, allowing the riders to escape \u2014 only to be beaten by the waiting mob. Another group of riders were beaten by attackers with lead pipes on May 14 in Birmingham, Alabama. The mayor, Bull Connor, refused to provide protection for the riders because it was Mother\u2019s Day. The violence led to a moratorium on Freedom Rides, and the belief that the movement had failed.\n\nKing, upon hearing of the violence, flew from Chicago to Montgomery on May 21 to meet with activists to discuss the future of the rides and whether they should continue. But first, he delivered a speech in support of the riders at Abernathy\u2019s First Baptist Church. He almost didn\u2019t survive the night. Another mob, including several Klansmen, surrounded the church and threatened to beat or kill anyone who left. King and the members of the church were held under siege in the church until dawn the next morning, when federal marshals and the Alabama National Guard finally escorted them out. When King left the church, he headed to Harris\u2019 house, where the pivotal meeting about the Freedom Rides took place.\n\nKing was on probation for a bogus traffic violation from the previous May. And another arrest, which was guaranteed to happen if he joined the rides, would have resulted in him being in jail for months. There wouldn\u2019t have been any way of getting him released, creating a growing possibility that he\u2019d be killed at some point during his time in jail. \u201cIf they put King in that Montgomery jail, he would have never gotten out alive,\u201d my dad recalled. A reminder of just how much danger King and other activists were in at the time.\n\nFor some, that was too much of a risk. Others believed it was a necessary risk that many other people on those buses were willing to take. King, to his credit, seemed amenable to going.\n\nIf you want me to go, I\u2019ll go. My dad remembers King\u2019s willingness to go on the rides. King\u2019s advisers, Wyatt Tee Walker and Ralph Abernathy among them, adamantly suggested during the meeting that King avoid the rides. So King\u2019s reputation among some riders took a hit as they boarded buses. They referred to him as \u201cDe Lawd,\u201d mocking his decision. The belief among these dissenters was that King would rather be the face of the movement and not actually do the dangerous work. \u201c[King] got flak for that decision [not to join the rides], but I didn\u2019t think he needed to go,\u201d my father says now. \u201cI didn\u2019t see him as being a coward for not going. It was an unnecessary risk. We all were willing to go on the rides, and didn\u2019t really need him to go.\u201d\n\nRobert F. Williams, president of the Union County, North Carolina, NAACP branch lambasted King in a June 5, 1961, edition of his newsletter The Crusader:\n\nIt is pathetic that some of the students are under suspended sentences and some are three and four time losers for freedom, yet they are participating. Maybe, in King\u2019s estimation, they are just students and only stand to lose their lives or careers while he stands to lose a fortune in struggle and blood money.\n\n\u201cIn our 20s we thought everyone should go to jail,\u201d said Dennis. \u201cBut [King] wouldn\u2019t have made it out of a Montgomery jail alive. When we were in that meeting, he\u2019d just spent the night in a church surrounded by Klansmen. He put his life on the line. Nobody in the movement was a coward.\u201d\n\nThe mansion was full of people who truly feared for their lives. And the folks from CORE and SNCC finally persuaded King and Farmer to give their blessings for the rides to continue. My dad, just a few months into the movement, was definitely scared. \u201cWhen we decided to get on that bus, I started having doubts \u2026 wondering, \u2018What am I doing here?\u2019 Then someone in the room, I don\u2019t even remember who it was, said something I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s not enough space in this room for both God and fear, so make your choice.\n\n\u201cThat snapped me out of my fear,\u201d he says. \u201c I knew I had to get on that bus.\u201d\n\nOn May 23, King, Abernathy and John Lewis \u2014 a man of action who was sporting a bandage after being attacked by the Montgomery mob two days before, and who would join the riders to Jackson \u2014 held a news conference stating that the rides would continue. On May 24, my dad was with the first group of Freedom Riders out of Montgomery.\n\nWhat the Riders did not know was that Attorney General Robert Kennedy had declared that the Freedom Riders would get National Guard protection along their routes and he vowed that there would be no more violence. What the Freedom Riders could not know is that seven years later, King would be assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee. And Robert Kennedy two months after King. And just last week, President Barack Obama proclaimed the site of the Anniston, Alabama, attack a national monument.\n\nThe conflict between King and the Freedom Riders is one to remember as the need for resistance persists more than half a century later. \u201cWe all had different roles,\u201d said Dennis, who has spent the last two decades trying to bridge the education gap in America while also traveling the country speaking about the civil rights movement and how to achieve those dreams in the 21st century. \u201cKing\u2019s role was different. Nobody could articulate the issues in the movement the way he did. His role was to do what he did. There were farmers, and workers in cities who had roles and couldn\u2019t go to jail because they had families to take care of. The students had their roles, too. We all had different things we needed to do to achieve our goals. Nobody was more important than anyone else.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.motorcycle.com/features/feel-dinner-freddie-spencer.html", "page_content": "1 View\n\nWe all feel the same when riding motorcycles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Photos by Armondo Lulu and Honda\n\nWhat makes pro riders pros, is their talent, their fearlessness, and perhaps more than anything else, their ability to feel. That skill applies to Freddie Spencer in more ways than one. A legend on two wheels, he had the magic touch, but he also had a feeling that led him to take a chance on Honda. And now he\u2019s telling his story in his aptly named bio, Feel. One of the greatest motorcycle racers of all time, winning the 1983 500cc championship and capturing both the 500cc and 250cc Grand Prix World titles in 1985, he comes by his nickname \u201cFast Freddie\u201d honestly.\n\nThe author and Freddie Spencer at the Honda Canada event.\n\nFrederick Burdette Spencer, 57, was born in Shreveport, Louisiana. Since he began competing in dirt track events at the age of four, racing was obviously in his blood. After winning the 1978 250cc U.S. National Road Racing Championship, he was signed by Honda. By 1982, he had been promoted full-time to Honda\u2019s Grand Prix team and, at the age of 21, won his first 500cc World Championship in 1983. In 1985, Freddie won the Daytona 200, as well as the Formula 1 and 250cc classes. He still holds the record of being the only rider to win all three divisions in a single year. This also happened to be the same year he became the only rider to win both the 250 and 500cc World Championships. Wrist injuries unfortunately cut his career short and, although he returned to successfully race in the AMA Superbike Championship in the 1990s, he officially retired from Grand Prix racing in 1988. Thanks to the generosity of Honda Canada, a small group of riders and VIPS were invited to join Freddie for dinner in Toronto while he was in town promoting his new book, Feel.\n\nFreddie signs a poster for a fan. Photo by Armondo Lulu.\n\nI have to admit I was pretty excited to meet him. Freddie has been a long-time motorcycle hero of mine. I can clearly remember the year he won the two world titles, and I have followed his career ever since, even naming one of my cats after him. Because of this, I realized on my way to the dinner that I was nervous. Despite feeling lucky to have my own career riding motorcycles for a living, I certainly can\u2019t compare my riding to a world champion racer, right? After he retired from racing, he opened a motorcycle training school in Las Vegas. I hoped that this would give us some common ground since I started my own motorcycle training school, MotorSoul Riding School, a few years ago in Toronto. I arrived at the restaurant and Freddie was already there at the bar with his wife and our VIP Honda representative. I had always wondered what he would be like, and Mr. Freddie Spencer did not disappoint. As I and the other attendees arrived at the restaurant, he greeted us warmly and was quick to make some friendly chit-chat. Over dinner, I was struck by his sincerity and how willing he was to talk candidly about his life. He told me he wanted to be forthright about his journey. So, he didn\u2019t hold anything back in his book. Feel is his story about his life \u2013 the good and the bad. Despite Freddie\u2019s worldwide success in racing, he struggled with childhood trauma and his purpose in life. I think one would just assume his life would have been fulfilled after his tremendously successful racing career. However, Freddie understood life is bigger than winning races.\n\nAs Freddie chatted throughout the evening, he made a point to include everyone at the table. He chatted about his love for his children, stories of racing his grandmother in her LTD, and dogs he used to have. He was very kind and charming, making sure everyone got some of his time. This should come as no surprise since he is known to spend time with every fan at his book signings. He\u2019s a true legend \u2013 always giving back to his fans! I asked Freddie what else motorcycling has given to him, besides a life-long career and fame. He was quick to respond that motorcycling gave him the ability to trust his own judgement and taught him to listen to his instincts \u2013 both critical things in order to navigate through life. He referred specifically to the late `70s, when he chose to go with Honda after meeting Mr. Honda himself and how he felt an immediate strong connection to him. At the time, Honda was struggling internationally to make the oval-pistoned NR500 four-stroke work in the two-stroke dominated 500cc Grands Prix, and Freddie was told that his decision to sign with Honda was crazy considering he had already won with Kawasaki. However, he knew in his gut that going with Honda was the right choice for him \u2013 a choice he more than validated in the coming years.\n\n1983 NS500\n\nI was curious how Freddie felt about the technology available today compared to when he raced, and would it have made a difference to his riding ability. \u201cYou had to adjust and adapt to the equipment,\u201d\u2019 he explained, and he liked that. He said he simply had to trust and feel the bike. \u201cElectronics can band-aid mistakes,\u201d he clarified. So, he wouldn\u2019t change a thing. Since I\u2019ve been involved in motorcycling over the past 20 years, I have seen a dramatic change in the demographic of riders myself \u2013 more women, more \u201chipsters\u201d, more over 50s learning to ride, more people choosing to ride for more cost-effective transportation purposes, etc. So, I wondered how much more it has changed since Freddie has been riding. The perception of riding and its acceptance by society is completely different now. When Freddie was growing up and people learned he rode motorcycles, he was asked one of two things: was he a biker gang member, or did he want to be Evel Knievel? There was no other perception and nothing in between. Freddie is all about the bigger picture with riding and what it does for the collective group. This change in perception is exactly what this sport needed in order to welcome more riders from every walk of life to enjoy all the benefits of riding.\n\nI was thrilled when we spoke about our mutual love for teaching new riders. We both delight in seeing that spark happen \u2013 when you know they \u201cget\u201d what riding is all about. As a female rider in a male-dominated sport, I wondered how he felt gender played a role generally, and in teaching. Freddie paused for a moment and asked what I thought. I explained how I never wanted to differentiate and separate male and female riders at my motorcycle training school. I am strongly against all-girl courses, because riding isn\u2019t gender based. Riding is riding, I said. Freddie smiled and agreed, \u201cRiding IS riding,\u201d he repeated. What was clearly evident at that moment was Freddie\u2019s pure love for riding motorcycles. He said there is no difference with how riding feels for him and how it feels to any other rider, \u201cWe feel the same things when we ride.\u201d I guess we riders have something in common with a legend like Freddie Spencer after all."}, {"url": "http://toefl.xdf.cn/201503/10226164.html", "page_content": "\u6258\u798f\u5199\u4f5c\u8303\u6587\uff1a\u73b0\u5728\u7684\u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba\u6bd4\u8fc7\u53bb\u66f4\u613f\u610f\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ed6\u4eba\n\n\u5199\u4f5c\u9898\u76ee\n\nDo you agree or disagree with the statement: young people today are more likely to help others than young people were in the past. \u73b0\u5728\u7684\u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba\u6bd4\u8fc7\u53bb\u66f4\u613f\u610f\u5e2e\u52a9\u522b\u4eba\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u8ba4\u540c\uff1f\n\n\u5199\u4f5c\u8303\u6587\n\nIn our country there has always been a spirit of volunteerism. As children, we are taught that helping those less fortunate is our responsibility. But unfortunately, the growing prosperity of the nation has placed an emphasis on materialism and individual success, creating a generation of youth that do not understand the meaning of being selfless. I believe young people today are not as charitable as previous generations of young people.\n\nThe main reasons I am so skeptical of the inclination of today\u2019s youth to help people is that they are spoiled. I remember when I was young and using a computer at the public library was a privilege. When my parents bought me my own computer when I went to university, I understood how much they sacrificed to give me that as a present. Nowadays, children see expensive computers, like the iPad and iPhone, as a necessity, not a privilege. They receive all these kinds of gifts without comprehending how much their parents sacrifice to give them the very best in the latest technology. They do not know what it is to be without. I believe this has created a generation of selfish young people who do not understand and cannot empathize with those less fortunate, making them less likely to feel compelled to help others.\n\nIn addition, I think this generation has not learned to respect others. Trapped in their own digital world, they are unaware of the disrespect they show their elders when they ignore their parents and grandparents as they text and talk on their cellphones. Maybe that is not the sole cause, but I see a distinct difference between how they behave and how my generation behaved at that age. For example, when riding the bus, it is commonplace to offer your seat to an elderly gentleman or lady. Now, when I ride the bus, I constantly see young people who are sitting in the seats specifically reserved for senior citizens and who basically refuse to vacate the seat when a senior citizen enters the bus. Instead, they pretend to be more absorbed in the game on their iPhones, pretending to be unaware of their obligation to offer their chair to those in need. Today\u2019s youth are so wrapped in their own self-interests that they are disrespectful and do not willingly help those in need.\n\nAdmittedly, it is not entirely correct to say that all young people are selfish and do not help others. The number of volunteer organizations in schools and community suggests that there are many youths who understand the importance of helping our fellow man. I am certain there are many students who full-heartedly believe in volunteerism and charity, but I think that in general these school volunteer programs serve a selfish end. Volunteering has more or less become a requirement for college applications. A student who does not have any volunteer service experience is a less competitive applicant than one who does have volunteer service experience. Although there may be a few students who genuinely believe in the social responsibility of charity, many students participate simply to forward their own self-interests.\n\nToday\u2019s youth, who have been raised in a period of affluence and privilege and do not understand what it means to have nothing, are self-centered, disrespectful, and less likely to help other than previous generations.\n\n(\u7f16\u8f91\uff1aJoe)\n\n\u7248\u6743\u58f0\u660e\uff1a\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u65b0\u4e1c\u65b9\u7f51\u72ec\u5bb6\u7a3f\u4ef6\uff0c\u7248\u6743\u4e3a\u65b0\u4e1c\u65b9\u7f51\u6240\u6709\u3002\u8f6c\u8f7d\u987b\u6ce8\u660e\u6765\u6e90\u53ca\u4f5c\u8005\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u5fc5\u5c06\u8ffd\u7a76\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8d23\u4efb\u3002"}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/finance/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/problem-free-riders", "page_content": "Problem of Free Riders\n\nWhat It Means\n\nThe problem of free riders is an economic dilemma that emerges in situations involving what economists call public goods. A public good is a product or service that, in being made available to one person, can be freely enjoyed by others. People cannot be easily prevented from using the good, and one person\u2019s use of the good does not diminish its usefulness to other people. For example, if Jane\u2019s neighborhood association pools money to build new sidewalks, everyone in the neighborhood will benefit equally. Jane\u2019s enjoyment of the sidewalks does not prohibit her neighbors\u2019 enjoyment of the sidewalks in the way that her use of a car prevents her neighbor from using that particular car.\n\nIf, however, Jane suspects that the project will still go ahead even without her contribution to the neighborhood association\u2019s pool of money, she may decide not to pay her share because she knows that she will still get the benefits of the new, smooth sidewalks anyway. Jane has chosen, in this situation, to be what is known as a free rider. If a large proportion of her neighbors made the same calculation that Jane made and chose not to pay their share, the new sidewalks might not get built.\n\nIn situations involving public goods, economists, governments, and other interested parties must address the problem of free riders: that is, they must consider ways of discouraging free-riding, of guarding against its negative effects, or both.\n\nWhen Did It Begin\n\nThinkers in a wide variety of contexts have, throughout the history of civilization, addressed the problems arising from public goods. Some scholars suggest that the logic behind free-riding is embodied by the arguments of Glaucon, a character in Plato\u2019s Republic (c. 360 bc ; Plato, who lived from approximately 428 to 348 bc , was an important ancient Greek philosophers, and one of his best-known works is The Republic, which concerns the form that a model society should take). Glaucon suggests that people have no reason to obey laws if they can be certain that they will not be caught or, if caught, that they will not be punished.\n\nThe founder of economics, Scottish philosopher Adam Smith (1723\u201390), wrote at length in his landmark work An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776) about the public benefits that arise when individuals independently pursue their own self-interest. His treatment of this topic suggests an understanding of the concept of public goods, but Smith saw the positive effects of the phenomenon more clearly than the potential problems. Smith\u2019s friend and contemporary, the Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711\u201376), had an earlier and more thorough grasp of what we now call the free-rider problem. In A Treatise of Human Nature (1739\u201340), Hume noted that, though two neighbors might agree to share the burden of draining a meadow they own together, trying to get a thousand people to agree on any common project and on their share of the burden would be all but impossible.\n\nSince that time the problem of the free rider has been a fixture in popular notions of human nature. Economists and other social scientists only began analyzing the problem in detail in the latter part of the twentieth century, however, after the publication of The Logic of Collective Action (1965) by American economist Mancur Olson (1932\u201398). Olson dealt thoroughly with what motivates individuals in the realm of collective action and public goods, and his theories have inspired detailed study of the conflicts between private drives and public goals in the decades since.\n\nMore Detailed Information\n\nThe problem of free riders emerges in many situations involving public goods, but it becomes a bigger problem, generally, as the number of people who share in the use of a particular good grows. The phenomenon of neighbors cooperating to fix sidewalks or otherwise improve their common living conditions is a fairly common one in today\u2019s world. The frequent success of these projects probably results from the fact that a relatively small number of people are usually involved. When a small group of people band together to solve some problem, each individual\u2019s participation is often vital to the success of the project.\n\nIf the sidewalk project in Jane\u2019s neighborhood involves five square blocks\u2019 worth of houses, Jane may understand that the project will not go forward if she does not pay her share. If she wants the benefit of sidewalks, then she has an incentive to pay her share. If the sidewalk project encompasses twenty square blocks of houses, however, Jane may feel that her participation is less vital and that she may as well save her money and enjoy the new sidewalks without contributing.\n\nVoting in national elections is commonly influenced by the problem of free riders. Jane\u2019s political beliefs may be strong, and she may want a certain candidate to be elected president of the United States, but she may feel that the large number of votes cast means that one measly vote cannot possibly have any effect on the ultimate outcome. Jane chooses to avoid the effort of taking time off work to go to the polls, trusting others to cast their votes for her candidate and bring about the outcome that she wants; or she may not vote because she doesn\u2019t believe her vote can help her candidate can win. If a large number of people feel as Jane does, the results of the elections will not reflect the desires of the voters.\n\nAnother factor that can encourage people to free ride is if the difficulty or expense of the burden they are being asked to share seems too great. For instance, if Jane\u2019s neighbors want to fix the sidewalks on their own and they ask Jane to contribute 20 hours of heavy labor in addition to money for materials, she would be much more likely to free ride than if she only had to contribute a small amount of money and no labor. Because of this phenomenon efforts encouraging people to vote often address the ease of voting. Polling places frequently open early and stay open late to enhance the convenience of voting, and there are no registration or other fees required to vote.\n\nSolutions to free-rider problems are often devised by governments. National defense is a classic example of a public good that would flounder under the free-rider problem if the government did not step in. It is a public good in that no one can be prevented from enjoying it and in that one person\u2019s enjoyment of it does not prevent another person\u2019s enjoyment of it. The amount of money and effort required to protect a nation from invasion and turmoil is immense, however. An effective national defense simply would not result from the self-interested actions of private individuals, so the government collects taxes and undertakes the burden of defending the nation\u2019s people independently of individual attitudes toward the problem.\n\nRecent Trends\n\nIn the early twenty-first century one of the public goods most susceptible to the problem of free riders is the health of the natural environment. Although most people accept that such threats as global warming and air pollution are serious issues and cannot be ignored, individual Americans are generally unwilling to do their part to bring about such desired public goods as clean air and reduced carbon emissions (carbon emissions, which contribute to global warming, are the pollutants that result from burning fossil fuels, such as coal and oil). Jane may be worried about global warming, but she may not be willing to change her lifestyle to help decrease it (by taking public transportation to work and by minimizing her plane travel and use of air conditioning, for instance) because she believes that she alone can do little to solve the problem. Meanwhile, many other people are making the same calculation as Jane, and the problem continues to grow. Addressing global warming requires vast changes in the habits of typical Americans, and most economists agree that only government has the power to solve the problem of free riders under these circumstances."}, {"url": "https://forums.autosport.com/topic/220297-hard-riders/", "page_content": "Posted 19 January 2022 - 14:19\n\nSo in fact we have come down to the definition of 'hard riding'\n\nIs it:\n\nOpportunistic?\n\nAggressive?\n\nDirty?\n\nStupid?\n\nArrogant?\n\nTo me an opportunistic rider might be considered hard as sometimes in the heat of battle the perceived opportunity for a pass might suddenly disappear the split second after it was perceived but by that time it was too late to pull out.

In 1961, integrated teams rode buses from the North to the South to force the government to uphold federal law prohibiting discrimination in public transportation and public facilities.The tactic was for blacks to sit in the front of the bus and whites in the back, or to sit together in the front. At every rest stop, blacks would enter the white waiting room and whites the black waiting room.In Alabama, in particular, the white reaction was swift and violent. In Anniston, a bus was firebombed, and the Klan attacked the riders at the bus station in Birmingham. Many were severely beaten and thrown in jail but the Freedom Riders were persistent, courageous, and ultimately victorious. PBS premiered a documentary about them on Monday, May 16. Watch excerpts and a preview What lessons can today's movements learn from that time in history?First is raw courage. The Freedom Riders put their bodies on the line to fight injustice, risking not only arrest but beatings and even death. They were willing to disrupt their normal lives for what they believed in; they couldn't count on returning to comfortable circumstances by the end of the day.Second, just as the lunch counter sit-ins in 1960 had electrified the nation, the Freedom Riders were not afraid to use new and daring tactics in confronting unjust segregationist laws.Third, they knew that only by generating a crisis would the federal government be forced to intervene. Business as usual had to cease. The status quo could no longer be accepted. Images of burning buses and bloodied youth were daily events on the evening news. The U.S. government was being shamed in the eyes of the world.Today's crisis of wealth inequality is becoming as stark as racial inequality in 1961. People of color are still disproportionately affected. Imagine if the victims of foreclosures, layoffs, plant closings, concessions were to unite to stop business as usual in 2011.At this time, a relatively unknown organizer was working behind the scenes in the civil rights movement. She encouraged the youth and supported their forming their own organization, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). She believed young people had to be empowered to run their own organization, not look to a leader outside themselves to follow.Her name was Ella Baker. She was responsible for helping SNCC make the transition from these high-profile events to day-to-day grassroots organizing. While having a dedicated cadre willing to risk their lives was important, she believed that ordinary people had to be involved if a movement was going to succeed.\"In the long run they themselves are the only protection they have against violence or injustice,\" Baker said. \"They cannot look for salvation anywhere but to themselves.\" She believed that \"strong people don't need strong leaders.\" This idea is relevant today when we look at the internal culture of most unions and how they handle power.Most unions operate under the service model, where the members pay dues and, in return, expect their grievances and contracts to be handled for them. This arrangement puts a great burden on the officers to \"bail out the ocean\" of endless problems that a local union faces daily. In this model, much of the decision-making is concentrated in the hands of a few officers. Similar to how a corporation operates, power is at the top.Ella Baker had a radically democratic vision: that those most affected by an issue should lead. That, in fact, their knowledge and wisdom about the problem was key to making progress. Before making any demands on the system, time had to be taken to ensure that everyone was on board. Success was judged not necessarily by how many people turned out for a rally but what people learned along the way. Did they learn how to write a leaflet, run a meeting, organize a phone bank? This was leadership as teaching.To Ella Baker, the steward would be the most important part of a union organization. This is the person who is most in touch with the issues and with those affected by them. A good steward will create a base by building strong ties with those he or she represents. Relationship-building and the personal development of individuals was central to Baker's thinking. Building trust and engaging in a democratic process can be very undramatic and takes years of work but is necessary in building power at the base of the union.In a typical scenario, a steward might handle a grievance herself and not involve anyone else. Using Ella Baker's organizing model, the steward would pay more attention to empowering as many people as possible in the process of resolving the problem. Time would be taken to discuss strategy and question what was trying to be accomplished by this action. Then, once a decision was reached, people would act together as one.Under Baker's influence, the SNCC culture was innovative and flexible and left room for plenty of debate and trial and error. This style could be applied to a contract campaign, for example, where the strategy would be driven by the needs of the members and answers about what to do would come from taking the time to dialogue and build consensus.Again, success might not be judged solely in the traditional way. Other factors such as increasing membership, healing divisions within the workforce, developing new leaders and a stronger steward network, educating the rank and file about the broader issues, and building better relations with the community would also be considered.Many social movements have a rich history for us to learn from. The story of Ella Baker is not told enough, but the example she set inspires many of us who are trying to build radical alternative ways of using power, instead of copying the way management and the system uses it.For more on Ella Baker and her organizing philosophy seeby Barbara Ransby andby Charles Payne.\n\n* * *\n\nPaul McLennan is a retired bus mechanic and Transit Union member in Atlanta.

Traveling on buses from Washington, D.C., to Jackson, Mississippi, the riders met violent opposition in the Deep South, garnering extensive media attention and eventually forcing federal intervention from John F. Kennedy\u2019s administration. Although the campaign succeeded in securing an Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) ban on segregation in all facilities under their jurisdiction, the Freedom Rides fueled existing tensions between student activists and Martin Luther King, Jr., who publicly supported the riders, but did not participate in the campaign.\n\nThe Freedom Rides were first conceived in 1947 when CORE and the Fellowship of Reconciliation organized an interracial bus ride across state lines to test a Supreme Court decision that declared segregation on interstate buses unconstitutional. Called the Journey of Reconciliation, the ride challenged bus segregation in the upper parts of the South, avoiding the more dangerous Deep South. The lack of confrontation, however, resulted in little media attention and failed to realize CORE\u2019s goals for the rides. Fourteen years later, in a new national context of sit-ins, boycotts, and the emergence of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the Freedom Rides were able to harness enough national attention to force federal enforcement and policy changes.\n\nFollowing an earlier ruling, Morgan v. Virginia (1946), that made segregation in interstate transportation illegal, in 1960 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Boynton v. Virginia that segregation in the facilities provided for interstate travelers, such as bus terminals, restaurants, and restrooms, was also unconstitutional. Prior to the 1960 decision, two students, John Lewis and Bernard Lafayette, integrated their bus ride home from college in Nashville, Tennessee, by sitting at the front of a bus and refusing to move. After this first ride, they saw CORE\u2019s announcement recruiting volunteers to participate in a Freedom Ride, a longer bus trip through the South to test the enforcement of Boynton. Lafayette\u2019s parents would not permit him to participate, but Lewis joined 12 other activists to form an interracial group that underwent extensive training in nonviolent direct action before launching the ride.\n\nOn 4 May 1961, the freedom riders left Washington, D.C., in two buses and headed to New Orleans. Although they faced resistance and arrests in Virginia, it was not until the riders arrived in Rock Hill, South Carolina, that they encountered violence. The beating of Lewis and another rider, coupled with the arrest of one participant for using a whites-only restroom, attracted widespread media coverage. In the days following the incident, the riders met King and other civil rights leaders in Atlanta for dinner. During this meeting, King whispered prophetically to Jet reporter Simeon Booker, who was covering the story, \u201cYou will never make it through Alabama\u201d (Lewis, 140).\n\nThe ride continued to Anniston, Alabama, where, on 14 May, riders were met by a violent mob of over 100 people. Before the buses\u2019 arrival, Anniston local authorities had given permission to the Ku Klux Klan to strike against the freedom riders without fear of arrest. As the first bus pulled up, the driver yelled outside, \u201cWell, boys, here they are. I brought you some niggers and nigger-lovers\u201d (Arsenault, 143). One of the buses was firebombed, and its fleeing passengers were forced into the angry white mob. The violence continued at the Birmingham terminal where Eugene \u201cBull\u201d Connor\u2019s police force offered no protection. Although the violence garnered national media attention, the series of attacks prompted James Farmer of CORE to end the campaign. The riders flew to New Orleans, bringing to an end the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s.\n\nThe decision to end the ride frustrated student activists, such as Diane Nash, who argued in a phone conversation with Farmer: \u201cWe can\u2019t let them stop us with violence. If we do, the movement is dead\u201d (Ross, 177). Under the auspices and organizational support of SNCC, the Freedom Rides continued. SNCC mentors were wary of this decision, including King, who had declined to join the rides when asked by Nash and Rodney Powell. Farmer continued to express his reservations, questioning whether continuing the trip was \u201csuicide\u201d (Lewis, 144). With fractured support, the organizers had a difficult time securing financial resources. Nevertheless, on 17 May 1961, seven men and three women rode from Nashville to Birmingham to resume the Freedom Rides. Just before reaching Birmingham, the bus was pulled over and directed to the Birmingham station, where all of the riders were arrested for defying segregation laws. The arrests, coupled with the difficulty of finding a bus driver and other logistical challenges, left the riders stranded in the city for several days.\n\nFederal intervention began to take place behind the scenes as Attorney General Robert Kennedy called the Greyhound Company and demanded that it find a driver. Seeking to diffuse the dangerous situation, John Seigenthaler, a Department of Justice representative accompanying the freedom riders, met with a reluctant Alabama Governor John Patterson. Seigenthaler\u2019s maneuver resulted in the bus\u2019s departure for Montgomery with a full police escort the next morning.\n\nAt the Montgomery city line, as agreed, the state troopers left the buses, but the local police that had been ordered to meet the freedom riders in Montgomery never appeared. Unprotected when they entered the terminal, riders were beaten so severely by a white mob that some sustained permanent injuries. When the police finally arrived, they served the riders with an injunction barring them from continuing the Freedom Ride in Alabama.\n\nDuring this time, King was on a speaking tour in Chicago. Upon learning of the violence, he returned to Montgomery, where he staged a rally at Ralph Abernathy\u2019s First Baptist Church. In his speech, King blamed Governor Patterson for \u201caiding and abetting the forces of violence\u201d and called for federal intervention, declaring that \u201cthe federal government must not stand idly by while bloodthirsty mobs beat nonviolent students with impunity\u201d (King, 21 May 1961). As King spoke, a threatening white mob gathered outside. From inside the church, King called Attorney General Kennedy, who assured him that the federal government would protect those inside the church. Kennedy swiftly mobilized federal marshals who used tear gas to keep the mob at bay. Federal marshals were later replaced by the Alabama National Guard, who escorted people out of the church at dawn.\n\nAs the violence and federal intervention propelled the freedom riders to national prominence, King became one of the major spokesmen for the rides. Some activists, however, began to criticize King for his willingness to offer only moral and financial support but not his physical presence on the rides. In a telegram to King the president of the Union County National Association for the Advancement of Colored People branch in North Carolina, Robert F. Williams, urged him to \u201clead the way by example.\u2026 If you lack the courage, remove yourself from the vanguard\u201d (Papers 7:241\u2013242). In response to Nash\u2019s direct request that King join the rides, King replied that he was on probation and could not afford another arrest, a response many of the students found unacceptable.\n\nOn 29 May 1961, the Kennedy administration announced that it had directed the ICC to ban segregation in all facilities under its jurisdiction, but the rides continued. Students from all over the country purchased bus tickets to the South and crowded into jails in Jackson, Mississippi. With the participation of northern students came even more press coverage. On 1 November 1961, the ICC ruling that segregation on interstate buses and facilities was illegal took effect.\n\nAlthough King\u2019s involvement in the Freedom Rides waned after the federal intervention, the legacy of the rides remained with him. He, and all others involved in the campaign, saw how provoking white southern violence through nonviolent confrontations could attract national attention and force federal action. The Freedom Rides also exposed tactical and leadership rifts between King and more militant student activists, which continued until King\u2019s death in 1968."}, {"url": "https://www.devittinsurance.com/guides/motorcycle-racing/manx-grand-prix-classic-tt/history/", "page_content": "Milestones\n\n1923: The first ever Manx Amateur Road Races take place.

Known as \u2018the Galahad in leathers\u2019 Frith gained a reputation for being a stylish and skilled racer. His accomplishments include winning the 1935 Junior Manx Grand Prix and becoming the first 350cc World Champion.\n\nEarly days\n\nFrith was born in Grimsby in 1909 and came from a well-known stonemason family. He inherited his motorcycle enthusiasm from his dad, even though he started working in the family business. He went on to become a motorbike retailer in his hometown, but he always had a need to be on the road.\n\nRacing career\n\nFrith managed to earn a sponsorship from Nigel Spring, who was part of a family known for owning a jam and curd factory. His first ride occurred in the Isle of Man at the 1930 Manx Grand Prix and he came third. The bike he rode was a 350 cc Velocette KTT. Frith enjoyed major success in 1935 when he won the Junior 350 cc.\n\nThis win inspired him to turn professional and he joined the Norton team in 1936. His success continued when he won the 1936 Junior Tourist Trophy, setting a new race record lap of 81.94 mph. He followed this up with a second place position in the Senior 500 cc race, losing out to Norton teammate Jimmie Guthrie. In 1937, Frith won the Senior TT, becoming the first man to lap the course at over ninety miles per hour.\n\nFrith served at the Infantry Driving & Maintenance School stationed in Keswick during WW2. He was set to participate in the 1947 TT, only to suffer a crash at Ballacraine during practice, dislocating his right shoulder. This stopped him from racing, but he came back strong in 1948 and won the Junior race in the European championship.\n\nIn 1949, the Moto GP was created and it became Frith\u2019s most successful season. He went on to win every round in the Junior class, including the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy and became the first 350 cc World Champion.\n\nAt the end of the season, Frith retired, winning his final race at the Ulster Grand Prix. In 1950, he received royal honours, being awarded the OBE for his service to motorcycle racing.\n\nVery few racers can claim to go out on the top of their career, but Frith was happy with the success that he\u2019d earned.

Frith was one of the few to win TT races before and after the Second World War.[5] He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1950 Birthday Honours.[6]\n\nMotorcycle racing career\n\nFrith entered his first major race, the first Manx Grand Prix in 1930 riding an over-the counter, 350 cc Velocette KTT in the Junior event, finishing third at a speed of 60.34 mph. He retired from the 500 cc race with a blown engine, again riding his 350, when holding third place.[7]\n\nHe won the 1935 Junior Manx Grand Prix and then joined the Norton team for the 1936 TT Races. It was a winning combination as he claimed the Junior TT and finished second in the Senior TT as well as winning the 350cc European Championship. In 1937 he went one better in the Senior and took a brilliant win and setting the first 90 mph plus lap of the Snaefell Mountain Course.\n\nAfter finishing third in the 1939 Senior he missed the 1947 TT due to a practice spill on a 500cc Moto Guzzi. Turning to Velocettes in 1948 he won the Junior Race, repeating this success a year later.

He also won the Dutch TT and the Belgian and Swiss GPs, and did not need to compete in the sixth and last race of the season (the Italian Grand Prix at Monza) having already won the Championship with maximum points.\n\n\n\nWinning the 350cc class of the FIM's inaugural World Championship was the pinnacle of Freddie Frith's career and he subsequently retired (he was by then 40 years old). He was honoured with an OBE by King George VI at the end of the year for 'services to British motorcycle racing' and 'British prestige' in general.\n\n\n\nThe works Velocettes of the late 1940s were based on the latest version of the company's immensely successful over-the-counter KTT racer: the MkVIII. With its deep petrol tank, massively finned overhead-camshaft engine and purposeful appearance, the MkVIII KTT is unquestionably one of the most beautiful racing motorcycles ever made. The talking point of Velocette's new racer on its introduction in 1939 was its swinging-arm rear suspension, an innovation first seen on the works bikes in 1936. By now tried and tested, the Velocette rear suspension comprised a pivoting fork made from tapered tubing and complemented by a pair of Dowty Oleomatic air-sprung struts. The rest of the cycle parts remained much as those of the rigid-framed MkVII.\n\n\n\nThe production Mk VIII's original engine, while basically the same as its MkVII predecessor's, incorporated a number of improvements intended to enhance power and reliability. The big-end bearing assembly had already been strengthened (after some failures on the earlier model) and despite the springer's increase in weight over the rigid machine, its superior performance and excellent handling made the MkVIII KTT a formidable competitor. Indeed, the production version differed little from the factory bikes that had dominated the 1938 Isle of Man Junior TT, Stanley Woods leading home team-mate Ted Mellors to break Norton's seven-year stranglehold on the event. Woods repeated his win the following year.\n\n\n\nDespite its pre-war design origins, the Nigel Spring-entered MkVIII KTT had proved good enough to provide Freddie Frith and Velocette with the 1948 Junior TT; however, in order to win the 350cc World Championship in 1949, a complete redesign of the valve gear was considered necessary. Velocette had first experimented with a double-overhead-camshaft (DOHC) cylinder head on the KTT-based factory bikes back in 1936 (courtesy of chief designer Charles Udall). The post-war revisit of the DOHC concept however, was instigated by Bertie Goodman, only son of company boss, Percy.\n\n\n\nThe principal advantage of the DOHC motor was its lighter and better-controlled valve gear, which enabled it to rev safely at 8,000rpm, as against the 7,200rpm maximum of the single-cam 'rocker' engines (though the latter were preferred at some circuits on account of their greater low-down torque). At 74mm x 81mm, the bore and stroke were the same as the standard KTT, but the DOHC 'double knocker' (an original term coined by team manager Harold Willis in the mid-1930s) differed considerably in its detail design. Special machined-all-over forged pistons were used while, in anticipation of higher revs, the exhaust valve was sodium-filled to dissipate heat. The post-war DOHC engines were also fitted with larger-than-standard Oldham couplings while at the same time (and for the same reason) the valve gear's vertical drive-shaft was waisted. As usual, there was the additional oil scavenge pump in the lower end of the timing cover, a normal practice on works machines, in an effort to minimise oil drag on the spinning crankshaft. For the first time since before the war there was extensive use of Elektron magnesium alloy and also, as with most of the Velocette TT and Grand Prix machines, larger capacity fuel tanks.\n\n\n\nAs well as being original thinkers, Velocette were masters of both chassis and engine development. After what can only be described as a very short 'teething' period, the engines were immediately producing significantly more power than the 'single-knockers' but with the - almost luxurious - added benefit of a turbine-smooth power delivery. On the circuit they were extremely quick, and Bertie's attention to detail clearly helped achieve this (as a good example, individual camshafts were carefully balanced with special counter-weights so as to avoid vibration within the gear trains). As with all the factory racers, a very large cylinder barrel was employed to improve cooling. In addition, to assist when climbing Snaefell Mountain at the Isle of Man TT, a batch of special gearboxes was produced, in Elektron magnesium alloy, employing modified internal ratios as used on the pre-war works machines.\n\n\n\nAccording to works mechanic Frank Panes' notes, '1046' was one of two experimental 350cc DOHC engines produced from scratch for the 1949 season. Bertie himself later stated that in total, six 350cc DOHC engines had been produced by the factory after the war (some having been converted from the earlier single-knocker works motors).\n\n\n\nWith most of Velocette Ltd's limited financial resources committed to developing the forthcoming LE model, the post-war racing effort was bankrolled by Castrol and supported by several dealers together with private entrants Nigel Spring and Dick Wilkins. Factory records show that the KTTs, which were to be ridden by Freddie Frith and Ken Bills, were invoiced to Nigel Spring on 20th May 1948 and delivered via the Premier Motor Company of Birmingham. Frith's machine was numbered 'SF114' (frame) and 'KTT 954' (engine), while Bills' was numbered 'SF129' and 'KTT 956' respectively. Interviewed by Motor Cycling in February 1948, Spring remarked that he had expected a couple of standard MkVIII KTTs, but was delighted to hear that Veloce had decided to build a limited number of special models, with 'hotted-up' engines. As works supported riders, Frith and Bills enjoyed the advantages of these special engines that had been modified by the factory. In the same Motor Cycling article, Bertie Goodman confirmed that four of these special KTTs had been made: two for the Spring \u00e9quipe, and one each for Bob Foster and David Whitworth.\n\n\n\nR M N Spring was proprietor of a preserves manufacturer ('Spring's Delights') based in Brigg, Lincolnshire where it operated a large fruit processing plant. He was also a pre-war Brooklands competitor, race winner, world record holder, tuner, and sponsor, so knew a thing or two about racing motorcycles. Another Lincolnshire man, and one of the few riders to win Isle of Man TT's both before and after the war, Freddie Frith first came to prominence in 1930 when he rode a Velocette to 3rd place in the inaugural Manx Grand Prix's Junior race. In 1935 he won the Junior Manx GP on a Norton, a ride that earned him a place in Bracebridge Street's works team for '36. Freddie Frith was an instant success at the higher level, winning the 1936 Junior TT and the Senior TT in 1937, during which he became the first man to lap the Mountain Course at over 90mph.\n\n\n\nHaving spent the war years as an Army motorcycle instructor, he was tempted back into the saddle in 1947 at the age of 38 but did not compete in that year's TT following a spill in practice on a Senior Moto-Guzzi. He joined the Spring stable for 1948, and the rest, as they say, is history. A quiet, modest man, referred to consistently by all as a 'real gentlemen' Freddie Frith retired at the end of the 1949 season and opened a motorcycle dealership in Grimsby, which traded successfully for many years. He died in 1988 aged 78 and is still remembered fondly in Lincolnshire as one of the county's greatest sporting heroes.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the 1949 season, the special DOHC engines that had been on loan to Spring were returned to the factory, while the rest of the Frith Velocette, being Spring's personal property, was retained by him. (Apparently, at some point, possibly after being sold to a private owner, it was fitted with a standard KSS engine and used on the road).\n\n\n\nVelocette's exceedingly fast DOHC 350s raced on into 1950, Bob Foster winning the World Championship for the second year in succession for Hall Green, and these advanced engines were so good that they continued to be reused in more up-to-date cycle parts as development progressed. Fitted into lightweight 'low-boy' frames in 1951, they were once again raced by Foster (now in his final year) as well as up-and-coming new team members Cecil Sandford and Bill Lomas, whose machine ended up being fitted with the ex-Frith engine, 'L.IOM 68560.1046'.\n\n1951 would turn out to be the swansong of the full Velocette race team (in 1952 Veloce Ltd were only to enter a single rider - Les Graham - in international events) and the race shop was closed down soon afterwards.\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, but as is so often the case with obsolescent racing machines, the works Velocettes were dismantled and the major components dispersed, their historic identities being lost in the short term. The special magnesium DOHC engines, which still retained the promise of a useful life, were all sold to private owners, and 'L.IOM 68560.1046' eventually found itself recycled into the Reynolds-framed Velocette originally built for Geoff Duke. This came about because the Duke Reynolds Velocette had been acquired as a rolling chassis by the Australian Hinton Brothers, minus its original single-knocker engine. As the Hinton's also by now owned the ex-Lomas low-boy works Velocette, they wasted no time in transferring the ultra-quick ex-Frith motor, 'L.IOM 68560.1046', into the Duke machine.\n\n\n\nHaving gone down separate paths for so many years, frame and engine have now been reunited, and the ex-Frith 350cc motor, having changed hands a multitude of times in the intervening years, has been rebuilt by the world's leading authority on the Velocette marque. Since the rebuild's completion, this beautiful historic Velocette has been ridden on the Isle of Man TT Parade Lap, at the Assen Classic TT, and at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. Presented in sound order, this turbine-smooth, docile yet exceptionally fast motorcycle is ready to parade or even race. Accompanying documentation consists of period photographs, copies of factory records, Velocette Owners Club works record extract, engine specification details, and various magazine articles.\n\n\n\nExceptional motorcycles with important race history seldom come to market, let alone ultra-rare factory racers such as that offered here, so this multiple Grand Prix-winning works DOHC KTT, originally ridden to such success by one of the sport's most iconic World Champions, represents a unique opportunity, of enormous significance for collectors, to own a genuine World Championship-winning Velocette."}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/2835567", "page_content": "Frederick L. \"Freddie\" Frith OBE (born May 30 , 1909 - May 24 1988 in Grimsby , Lincolnshire , England ) was a British former Grand Prix motorcycle road racing World Champion.
