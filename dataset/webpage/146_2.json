One of the country\u2019s most gossiped-about actresses, she was an unmistakable metaphor of the real Spain of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.\n\nAfter the success of El \u00faltimo cupl\u00e9 she began to star in a series of musical melodramas \u2013 and to name her price: \u201cA million dollars a movie.\u201d She also chose all her own songs, costumes and even her timetable: \u201cBecause I refused to get up early again. In Mexico and the US I had to get up at 5.30 and six in the morning. Never again!\u201d\n\nMontiel was born Mar\u00eda Antonia Abad Fern\u00e1ndez in 1928 in Campo de Criptana, Ciudad Real province, a humble agricultural town. At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936, she moved with her family to Orihuela in Alicante and attended a convent school where Sister Leocadia taught her to sing.\n\nThey love me a lot everywhere Spain. I\u2019m on stage for two hours and they leave delighted\"\n\nShe made her film debut in Empez\u00f3 en boda in 1944, alongside the great Fernando Fern\u00e1n-G\u00f3mez: \u201cHe was the first man who kissed me. I was 16 years old and I didn\u2019t know how. And he explained to me how they did it in the movies. I thought it was done how it looked: from start to finish.\u201d\n\nHer stage name came from illustrator Enrique Herreros who thought she needed a \u201cforceful surname,\u201d like Montiel. The first part she chose herself, after her great-grandmother.\n\nFeeling her career wasn\u2019t taking off in Spain, she moved to Mexico to make Furia roja for the Hispamex production company in 1950, on the recommendation of the playwright Miguel Mihura - \u201cmy first love.\u201d \u201cAh, what a country Mexico was,\u201d she remembered. \u201cA very professional film industry, in the middle of its golden age. And people could get divorced. A reality that contrasted with the crummy one we had in Spain. [\u2026] And I became Mexican, of course. I still have my nationality card in the safe. When I married Tony Mann, in Los Angeles, I got married with my other passport, the Mexican one.\u201d\n\nIn total she married four times and is survived by her two adopted children.\n\nShe died suddenly in her home in the Salamanca neighborhood of Madrid, having celebrated her 85th birthday barely three weeks before. Although Montiel retired from films in 1974, she never thought about giving up performing and continued to give concerts. \u201cLast year I did six galas. They love me a lot everywhere Spain. I\u2019m on stage for two hours and they all leave delighted. And I do nothing to look after my voice,\u201d she said in her final interview, given to EL PA\u00cdS last October."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/sara-montiel", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nSara Montiel (Mar\u00eda Antonia Abad Fern\u00e1ndez) was born on 10 March, 1928 in Campo de Criptana, Ciudad Real, Castilla-La Mancha, Spain, is an Actress, Soundtrack, Producer.

The news of her passing and her obituary ran in every major newspaper in the world in sixteen different languages, witnessing her enormous popularity and widespread appeal. She left behind a legacy of films and recordings that had already turned her into a legend even during her life.\n\n\n\nSara Montiel was born on March 10th, 1928 in the village of Campo de Criptana, province of Ciudad Real, in the Castile-La Mancha region of Spain and was christened Maria Antonia Alejandra Abad Fernandez. Barely in her teens, she won a beauty and talent contest and was signed to a movie contract making her film debut in 1944. The young actress caught the attention of producers and directors who realized her enormous potential and in the next four years Sarita (\"Little Sara, as she was affectionately nick named) appeared in 14 films including her first international success \"Locura de Amor\" (1948) which led to a contract in Mexico where she established herself as one of the most popular film actors of the decade making a total of 13 films between 1950 and 1955. Due to her popularity in Mexico, Hollywood producers showed interest and she was formally introduced to American moviegoers in \"Vera Cruz\" (1954) starring Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster. Later she filmed for Warner Bros. \"Serenade\" (1955) with Mario Lanza, Joan Fontaine and Vincent Price directed by Anthony Mann who became her first husband two years later.\n\n\n\nAfter starring in Samuel Fuller's \"Run Of The Arrow\" (1957) with Rod Steiger, Brian Keith and Charles Bronson, Sarita went to Spain to film \"El \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9\" (The Last Song), a musical production which became the biggest box-office success in Spain's film history. It played for a year in the same theaters in which it opened becoming a sociological event of major proportions. A similar reaction followed in Western Europe and Latin America. Sarita Montiel had become the most popular actress-singer of 1957 and a national treasure for Spain. The unprecedented success of \"El \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9\" threw a wrench into her Hollywood career as she was offered a multimillion dollar contract to film in Spain and Europe. Her next vehicle \"La Violetera\" (The Violet Peddler) was an international blockbuster that confirmed Sara's popularity and the theme song from the film became Montiel's signature song. The soundtrack albums from both films reportedly outsold Presley and Sinatra in the world market. From then on, Sarita would combine the making of films with the recording of highly successful albums and live concerts.\n\n\n\nThe next films .ratified her screen image and mass appeal: \"Carmen, la de Ronda\" (1959), \"Mi \u00daltimo Tango\" (1960), \"Pecado de Amor\" (1961) were all outstanding commercial successes and proved that the Montiel phenomenon had arrived to stay. By 1962 she had become a legend to millions worldwide and continued enchanting her public with films such as \"La Bella Lola\" (1962), \"La Reina del Chantecler\" (1963), \"Noches de Casablanca\" (1963) \"Samba\" (1964), \"La Dama de Beirut\" (1965), \"La Mujer Perdida\" (1966), \"Tuset Street\" (1967), \"Esa Mujer\" (1968), \"Variet\u00e9s\" (1971) and more record-breaking concert tours around the world. After starring in the 1974 film \"Cinco Almohadas Para Una Noche\", Montiel announced her retirement from movies complaining about the almost pornographic turn taken by the film industry after censorship was abolished in Spain. For a long time she concentrated on stage musicals which were highly successful and by the 1990s she was appearing on her own television shows. As with all major celebrities, her career and her personal life kept making headlines for decades.\n\n\n\nIn December 2000, Sara Montiel published her long awaited \"memoirs\" titled \"Vivir es un placer\" (To live is a pleasure) in which she candidly told her remarkable story...

Her parents were Isidoro Abad, a peasant, and Maria Vicenta Fern\u00e1ndez, a door-to-door beautician. The future star was christened Maria Antonia Alejandra Abad Fern\u00e1ndez. Barely in her teens, she won a beauty and talent contest held by Cifesa, the most influential Spanish film studio of that era. She was promptly signed to a movie contract and in 1944 made her debut playing a teenager in Te quiero para m\u00ed (1944), credited in the cast as \"Maria Alejandra\". By the end of 1944 she was given the starring role in Empez\u00f3 en boda (1944), which introduced her with a more adult image and a new name: Sara Montiel.\n\nIn the next four years she appeared in 14 films, including her first international success Locura de amor (1948), which led to a long term-contract in Mexico. She quickly established herself as one of the most popular film actors of the decade. starring in over a dozen films between 1950 and 1954. Hollywood came calling and she was formally introduced to American moviegoers in Vera Cruz (1954), playing Gary Cooper's love interest. Later she worked at Warner Bros. in Serenade (1956) with Mario Lanza, directed by Anthony Mann, who became her first husband. After starring in Samuel Fuller's Run of the Arrow (1957) with Rod Steiger, Sarita shot The Last Torch Song (1957) (\"The Last Song\") in Spain, a musical production that turned out to be the biggest box-office success in Spain's film history. It played for over a year in the same theaters in which it opened. A similar reaction followed in Western Europe and Latin America. Sarita Montiel had become the most popular actress-singer of 1957 and a national treasure for Spain.\n\nThe unprecedented success of \"El \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9\" threw a wrench into her Hollywood career, as she was offered a multimillion-dollar contract to star in four films in Europe. Her next vehicle, La violetera (1958) (\"The Violet Peddler\"), confirmed Sara's popularity and broke the box-office records set by the previous movie. The theme song from \"La Violetera\" became Montiel's signature song. The soundtrack albums from both films reportedly outsold Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra in the world market. From then on, Sarita would combine the making of films with the recording of highly successful albums and live concerts in four continents. By 1962 she had become a legend to millions of fans worldwide, reaching markets that had previously been uncharted territory for Spanish cinema. Among her many blockbusters of the 1960s were Mi \u00faltimo tango (1960), Pecado de amor (1961), La bella Lola (1962), La reina del Chantecler (1962) and Esa mujer (1969).\n\nHowever, by the 1970s her interest in films diminished, due largely to the almost pornographic turn of Spanish films in the late-Francisco Franco era when censorship was abolished and she retired from films in 1974. Her activities turned mainly to recording and stage work, and she achieved uncontested successes with her stage shows \"Sara en Persona\" (1970-73), \"Sarit\u00edsima\" (1974-75), \"Increible Sara\" (1977-78), \"Super Sara Show\"(1979-80), \"Do\u00f1a Sara de La Mancha\" (1981-82), \"Taxi Vamos Al Victoria\" (1983-84), \"Nostalgia\" (1985-86), \"Sara, Siempre Sara\" (1987-88) and others.\n\nIn the 1990s Sara surprised everyone by branching out into television: Sara y punto (1990), a mini-series of seven one-hour episodes, included a serialized biography of the star, many popular guests (including Luciano Pavarotti and Charles Aznavour, among others) and Miss Montiel singing her greatest hits in addition to new songs written especially for her. Next came Ven al Paralelo (1992), taped in a Barcelona theater where Montiel hosted,sang and acted in comedy sketches in front of a live audience.\n\nIt is quite impossible to cover here all the awards Sara Montiel has won in her long successful career but we must mention the \"Premio del Sindicato\" (at that time Spain's equivalent of the Oscar) for best actress, won two years in a row for her performances in \"El \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9\" and \"La Violetera\". In 1972 she was proclaimed an honorary citizen of Los Angeles by Mayor Sam Yorty and was given the gold key to the city. Similarly she has been awarded the gold keys of New York, Miami and Chicago. In 1981 she received Israel's most prestigious honor, the Ben Guiron Award and in 1983 she was awarded France's Legion of Honor medal, after a retrospective of her career ran at the Autumn Film Festival in Paris. In 1986 \"Nosotros\", a Hollywood-based Hispanic actors advocacy organization founded by Ricardo Montalban, gave her its Golden Eagle Award for life achievement. The trophy was presented to Sarita by her \"Vera Cruz\" costar-producer Burt Lancaster in an emotional reunion that triggered a standing ovation from all their Hollywood peers witnessing the event. In 1997 she was awarded the \"Gold Medal\", also a life achievement recognition, given--rarely0--by Spain's Academy of Arts and Sciences. The two-hour ceremony was beamed live by national television. In 2008 Sara returned to her hometown to unveil a sculpture with her image at the new Sara Montiel Park. A nearby avenue was also named after her and there was at the same time a dedication ceremony of her newly renovated museum, located inside a 16th-century windmill. In addition, the government placed a commemorative plaque on the house where she was born.\n\nSara Montiel's private life has also been a large part of her legend. After divorcing Anthony Mann in 1963, she married three more times (Vicente Ramirez Olalla 1964-1978; Jose Tous 1979-1992; Antonio Hernandez 2002-2004). Before, during and after these marriages she had countless affairs, among them Nobel prize-winning scientist Severo Ochoa and Italian actor Giancarlo Del Duca. Unable to have children, she adopted two during her marriage to Jose Tous: Thais (born in 1979) and Zeus (born 1983). In 2000 she published her autobiography, which became a best seller. Undaunted by the passage of time and ignoring critics who accused her of mishandling her legendary image, Sara Montiel continued living and working at a hectic pace. She kept touring with her one woman show and making guests appearances on television. In 2009 she won a new generation of fans when she recorded \"Absolutamente,\" an outrageous duet with Fangoria's vocalist Alaska.

She worked in Europe, Latin America and United States. Her films The Last Torch Song and The Violet Seller netted the highest gross revenues ever recorded for films made in the Spanish-speaking movie industry during the 1950s/60s. Montiel's film Variety was banned in Beijing in 1973. She played the role of Antonia, the niece of Don Quixote, in the 1947 Spanish film version of Cervantes's great novel.\n\nShe was portrayed in the Pedro Almod\u00f3var film Bad Education by a male actor in drag (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) as the cross-dressing character Zahara, and a film clip from one of her movies was used, as well.\n\nActing career\n\nMontiel started in movies at 15 in her native Spain where she filmed her first movie playing an Islamic princess in the 1948 film Madness for Love, released in the U.S. as The Mad Queen. Later worked in Mexico, starring in a dozen films in less than five years. Hollywood came calling afterwards, and she was introduced to United States moviegoers in the film Vera Cruz (1954) co-starring Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster, and directed by Robert Aldrich. She was offered the standard seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures, which she refused, afraid of Hollywood's typecasting policies for Hispanics. Instead she freelanced at Warner Bros. with Mario Lanza and Joan Fontaine in Serenade (1956), directed by Anthony Mann, and at RKO in Samuel Fuller's Run of the Arrow (1957), opposite Rod Steiger and Charles Bronson.\n\nFrom The Last Torch Song (1957) on she combined filming, recording songs in five languages and performing live. Almost all of her films earned high box office results. Among the films during the 1960s and early 1970s were The Violet Seller (1958), Carmen, la de Ronda (1959), Mi \u00daltimo Tango (1960), Pecado de Amor (1961), La Bella Lola (a 1962 version of Camille), Casablanca, Nid d'espions (1963), Samba (1964), La Femme Perdue (1966), Tuset Street (1967), Esa Mujer (1969), Varietes (1971) and others. By then she had become dissatisfied with the movie industry when producers started offering her erotic roles in comedy films. In 1974 Montiel announced her retirement from movies but continued performing live, recording and starring on her own variety television shows in Spain.\n\nIn November 2009, Alaska from the Spanish pop group Fangoria invited Montiel to record a track sharing vocals with her for the re-release of the band's album Absolutamente. They recorded the title track \"Absolutamente\" as a duet. The music video for the song was released in early 2010. She had no plans to retire, and, in May 2011, after almost 40 years without making a movie, she accepted to perform in a feature film directed by \u00d3scar Parra de Carrizosa. The film title is Abr\u00e1zame and was shot on location in La Mancha.\n\nPersonal information\n\nMontiel was born Mar\u00eda Antonia Abad Fern\u00e1ndez (complete name Mar\u00eda Antonia Alejandra Vicenta Elpidia Isidora Abad Fern\u00e1ndez) in 1928 in Campo de Criptana (Ciudad Real), Spain. She entered films after winning a beauty and talent contest at age 15. In her first movie she was credited as \"Mar\u00eda Alejandra\" a shortened version of her real name. For her next film she changed her name to Sara, after her grandmother, and Montiel after the Montiel fields in the Castile\u2013La Mancha region of her birth. She has been married four times:\n\nAnthony Mann (American actor, film director); 1957-1963 (divorced)\n\nJos\u00e9 Vicente Ram\u00edrez Olalla (attorney); 1964-1978 (annulled)\n\nJos\u00e9 Tous Barber\u00e1n (attorney, journalist); 1979-1992 (Tous's death); this union produced two adopted children: Thais (born 1979) and Jos\u00e9 Zeus (born 1983)\n\nAntonio Hern\u00e1ndez (Cuban videotape operator); 2002-2005 (divorced)\n\nIn 2000, Montiel published her autobiography Memories: To Live Is A Pleasure, an instant best seller with ten editions to date. A sequel Sara and Sex followed in 2003. In these books Montiel revealed other relationships in her past including one-night stands with writer Ernest Hemingway as well as actor James Dean. She also claimed a long-term affair in the 1940s with playwright Miguel Mihura and mentioned that science wizard Severo Ochoa, a Nobel Prize winner, was the true love of her life.\n\nMontiel died in 2013 at her home in Madrid at the age of 85 from congestive heart failure.\n\nDiscography\n\nSara Montiel en Mexico\n\nCanciones de la Pel\u00edcula \"El \u00daltimo Cuple\" - London 5409\n\nLa Violetera - Columbia - EX 5056\n\nBaile con Sara Montiel\n\nCarmen la de Ronda - Columbia EX 5020\n\nBesos de Fuego\n\nMi \u00daltimo Tango - Columbia EX 5048\n\nEl Tango\n\nPecado de Amor - Columbia EX 5092\n\nLa Bella Lola\n\nNoches De Casablanca\n\nLa Dama de Beirut\n\nCanta Sarita Montiel\n\nEsa Mujer\n\nSara\n\nVariet\u00e9s\n\nSara...

The young actress caught the attention of producers and directors who realized her enormous potential and in the next four years Sarita (\"Little Sara, as she was affectionately nick named) appeared in 14 films including her first international success \"Locura de Amor\" (1948) which led to a contract in Mexico where she established herself as one of the most popular film actors of the decade making a total of 13 films between 1950 and 1955. Due to her popularity in Mexico, Hollywood producers showed interest and she was formally introduced to American moviegoers in \"Vera Cruz\" (1954) starring Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster.

It played for a year in the same theaters in which it opened becoming a sociological event of major proportions. A similar reaction followed in Western Europe and Latin America.

After starring in the 1974 film \"Cinco Almohadas Para Una Noche\", Montiel announced her retirement from movies complaining about the almost pornographic turn taken by the film industry after censorship was abolished in Spain.

Her parents were Isidoro Abad, a peasant, and Maria Vicenta Fern\u00e1ndez, a door-to-door beautician. The future star was christened Maria Antonia Alejandra Abad Fern\u00e1ndez. Barely in her teens, she won a beauty and talent contest held by Cifesa, the most influential Spanish film studio of that era. She was promptly signed to a movie contract and in 1944 made her debut playing a teenager in Te quiero para m\u00ed (1944), credited in the cast as \"Maria Alejandra\". By the end of 1944 she was given the starring role in Empez\u00f3 en boda (1944), which introduced her with a more adult image and a new name: Sara Montiel.\n\nIn the next four years she appeared in 14 films, including her first international success Locura de amor (1948), which led to a long term-contract in Mexico. She quickly established herself as one of the most popular film actors of the decade. starring in over a dozen films between 1950 and 1954. Hollywood came calling and she was formally introduced to American moviegoers in Vera Cruz (1954), playing Gary Cooper's love interest. Later she worked at Warner Bros. in Serenade (1956) with Mario Lanza, directed by Anthony Mann, who became her first husband. After starring in Samuel Fuller's Run of the Arrow (1957) with Rod Steiger, Sarita shot The Last Torch Song (1957) (\"The Last Song\") in Spain, a musical production that turned out to be the biggest box-office success in Spain's film history. It played for over a year in the same theaters in which it opened. A similar reaction followed in Western Europe and Latin America. Sarita Montiel had become the most popular actress-singer of 1957 and a national treasure for Spain.\n\nThe unprecedented success of \"El \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9\" threw a wrench into her Hollywood career, as she was offered a multimillion-dollar contract to star in four films in Europe. Her next vehicle, La violetera (1958) (\"The Violet Peddler\"), confirmed Sara's popularity and broke the box-office records set by the previous movie. The theme song from \"La Violetera\" became Montiel's signature song. The soundtrack albums from both films reportedly outsold Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra in the world market. From then on, Sarita would combine the making of films with the recording of highly successful albums and live concerts in four continents. By 1962 she had become a legend to millions of fans worldwide, reaching markets that had previously been uncharted territory for Spanish cinema. Among her many blockbusters of the 1960s were Mi \u00faltimo tango (1960), Pecado de amor (1961), La bella Lola (1962), La reina del Chantecler (1962) and Esa mujer (1969).\n\nHowever, by the 1970s her interest in films diminished, due largely to the almost pornographic turn of Spanish films in the late-Francisco Franco era when censorship was abolished and she retired from films in 1974. Her activities turned mainly to recording and stage work, and she achieved uncontested successes with her stage shows \"Sara en Persona\" (1970-73), \"Sarit\u00edsima\" (1974-75), \"Increible Sara\" (1977-78), \"Super Sara Show\"(1979-80), \"Do\u00f1a Sara de La Mancha\" (1981-82), \"Taxi Vamos Al Victoria\" (1983-84), \"Nostalgia\" (1985-86), \"Sara, Siempre Sara\" (1987-88) and others.\n\nIn the 1990s Sara surprised everyone by branching out into television: Sara y punto (1990), a mini-series of seven one-hour episodes, included a serialized biography of the star, many popular guests (including Luciano Pavarotti and Charles Aznavour, among others) and Miss Montiel singing her greatest hits in addition to new songs written especially for her. Next came Ven al Paralelo (1992), taped in a Barcelona theater where Montiel hosted,sang and acted in comedy sketches in front of a live audience.\n\nIt is quite impossible to cover here all the awards Sara Montiel has won in her long successful career but we must mention the \"Premio del Sindicato\" (at that time Spain's equivalent of the Oscar) for best actress, won two years in a row for her performances in \"El \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9\" and \"La Violetera\". In 1972 she was proclaimed an honorary citizen of Los Angeles by Mayor Sam Yorty and was given the gold key to the city. Similarly she has been awarded the gold keys of New York, Miami and Chicago. In 1981 she received Israel's most prestigious honor, the Ben Guiron Award and in 1983 she was awarded France's Legion of Honor medal, after a retrospective of her career ran at the Autumn Film Festival in Paris. In 1986 \"Nosotros\", a Hollywood-based Hispanic actors advocacy organization founded by Ricardo Montalban, gave her its Golden Eagle Award for life achievement. The trophy was presented to Sarita by her \"Vera Cruz\" costar-producer Burt Lancaster in an emotional reunion that triggered a standing ovation from all their Hollywood peers witnessing the event. In 1997 she was awarded the \"Gold Medal\", also a life achievement recognition, given--rarely0--by Spain's Academy of Arts and Sciences. The two-hour ceremony was beamed live by national television. In 2008 Sara returned to her hometown to unveil a sculpture with her image at the new Sara Montiel Park. A nearby avenue was also named after her and there was at the same time a dedication ceremony of her newly renovated museum, located inside a 16th-century windmill. In addition, the government placed a commemorative plaque on the house where she was born.\n\nSara Montiel's private life has also been a large part of her legend. After divorcing Anthony Mann in 1963, she married three more times (Vicente Ramirez Olalla 1964-1978; Jose Tous 1979-1992; Antonio Hernandez 2002-2004). Before, during and after these marriages she had countless affairs, among them Nobel prize-winning scientist Severo Ochoa and Italian actor Giancarlo Del Duca. Unable to have children, she adopted two during her marriage to Jose Tous: Thais (born in 1979) and Zeus (born 1983). In 2000 she published her autobiography, which became a best seller. Undaunted by the passage of time and ignoring critics who accused her of mishandling her legendary image, Sara Montiel continued living and working at a hectic pace. She kept touring with her one woman show and making guests appearances on television. In 2009 she won a new generation of fans when she recorded \"Absolutamente,\" an outrageous duet with Fangoria's vocalist Alaska. Both the record and the promotional video reached the top of the popularity charts and remained there for weeks.\n\nNext Sara recorded some love duets with baritone Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rom\u00e1n Marcos and traveled to the United States for a short tour sponsored by New York's Cervantes Institute and the universities of Chicago and Cincinnati. In every city she charmed the audiences with her charismatic presence and sense of humor. Back in Spain she continued her activities which now included supporting the singing career of her son Zeus. She appeared in his 2011 \"Sex Dance\" video and caused quite a stir.\n\nIn February 2013 Sara Montiel became the subject of a made-for-TV documentary titled \"Sara's Dream\" which aired in Spain to high ratings and great reviews. It was a fitting celebration of her fantastic life and career which came at the right time. A couple of months later, the star who had seemed eternal, passed away suddenly and quietly in her Madrid penthouse. By her family's request, funeral services were private but the funeral procession, organized by the city of Madrid, was a very moving event attended by thousands who showed up at Plaza Callao to bid farewell to their beloved Sara. She was buried in the San Justo cemetery family plot."}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/sara-montiel/biography", "page_content": "Sara Montiel Biography\n\nSpanish-Mexican actress and singer (1928\u20132013)In this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname isand the second or maternal family name is\n\nMar\u00eda Antonia Abad Fern\u00e1ndez MML (10 March 1928 \u2013 8 April 2013), known professionally as Sara Montiel, also Sarita Montiel, was a Spanish actress and singer. She began her career in the 1940s and became the most internationally popular and highest paid star of Spanish cinema in the 1960s. She appeared in nearly fifty films and recorded around 500 songs in five different languages.\n\nMontiel was born in Campo de Criptana in the region of La Mancha in 1928. She began her acting career in Spain starring in films such as Don Quixote (1947) and Madness for Love (1948). She moved to Mexico where she starred in films such as Women's Prison (1951) and Red Fury (1951). She then moved to the United States and worked in three Hollywood English-language films Vera Cruz (1954), Serenade (1956) and Run of the Arrow (1957). She returned to Spain to star in the musical films The Last Torch Song (1957) and The Violet Seller (1958). These two films netted the highest gross revenues ever recorded internationally for films made in the Spanish-speaking movie industry during the 1950s/60s and made her immensely popular. She then established herself also as a singer thanks to the songs she performed in her films and combined filming new musical films, recording songs and performing live.\n\nThroughout her career, Montiel's personal life was the subject of constant media attention in the Spanish-speaking world. She was married four times and adopted two children.\n\nCareer\n\nMontiel started in movies at sixteen in her native Spain, where she appeared in a secondary role in her first movie, Te quiero para m\u00ed (I want you for myself) in 1944, immediately followed by a leading role in Empez\u00f3 en boda (It Began with a Wedding) also in 1944. They were followed by roles in films such as Mariona Rebull (1946), Don Quixote (1947) and Madness for Love (1948). In April 1950, accompanied by her mother, she moved to Mexico and starred in a dozen films there in less than five years, including Women's Prison (1951), Red Fury (1951) and Cinnamon Skin (1953).\n\nSara Montiel attending the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Week in 1956.\n\nHollywood came calling afterwards, and she was introduced to United States moviegoers in the film Vera Cruz (1954), directed by Robert Aldrich. She was offered the standard seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures, which she refused, afraid of Hollywood's typecasting policies for Hispanics. Instead she freelanced at Warner Bros. in Serenade (1956), directed by Anthony Mann, whom she married in 1957, and at RKO in Samuel Fuller's Run of the Arrow (1957).\n\nBetween November 1956 and January 1957, before filming Run of the Arrow, she filmed in Barcelona the musical film The Last Torch Song during a vacation in Spain and as a deference to its director Juan de Ordu\u00f1a. The film, that was filmed with a very low budget, became unexpectedly a worldwide megahit. Initially, the songs in the film were going to be sung by a professional singer who would dub Montiel, but due to the low budget, she eventually sang the songs herself. The film soundtrack album also became a hit.\n\nFollowing this success, in June 1957 she signed with producer Benito Perojo a lavish contract to make four films in three years, being the first of them The Violet Seller, a 1958 large-budget international co-production musical film. The economic agreement was ten million pesetas (US$240,000 as of 1957) for four films, which means that she was to receive 2.5 million pesetas (US$60,000) per film, making her the highest-paid Spanish star at a time when the highest-paid stars were netting one million pesetas (US$24,000) per film. The success of The Violet Seller surp*ed that of The Last Torch Song, and in a contractual dispute for the next film, A Girl Against Napoleon (1959), the agreement was improved by securing for her the twenty per cent of the producer's net revenue. She also signed a contract with Hispavox to record and release the soundtrack albums of her films for which she netted the ten per cent of the records sale as royalties. The Violet Seller soundtrack album, the first with them, topped sales in Spain and in Latin America and, in July 1959, Hispavox served a Golden Disk award to her for the number of records sold there.\n\nAll this made her a film and singing international superstar. Almost all of her next films earned high box office results and she combined filming, recording songs and performing live. She was the highest paid star of Spanish cinema, and many years later, she began to say that she had been paid more than US$1 million for each of these films, something that the press widely reported as the actual figure. Among the next films during the 1960s and early 1970s were My Last Tango (1960), Pecado de amor (1961), The Lovely Lola (a 1962 version of La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias), Casablanca, Nest of Spies (1963), Samba (1964), The Lost Woman (1966), Tuset Street (1967), Esa Mujer (1969) and Variety (1971). The film Variety was banned in Beijing in 1973.\n\nIn 1974, she announced her retirement from movies, as she become dissatisfied with the movie industry and the overt nudity in films, but continued performing live, recording and starring on her own variety television shows in Spain. In 2002 she was the advertising image of the MTV Europe Music Awards held in Barcelona.\n\nIn November 2009, singer Alaska who forms the Spanish pop group Fangoria with Nacho Canut, invited Montiel to record a track sharing vocals with her for the re-release of the band's album Absolutamente. They recorded the *le track \"Absolutamente\" as a duet. The music video for the song was released on 18 December 2009. Well into her eighties, she had no plans to retire, and continued working in various projects. In May 2011, after almost forty years without making a movie, she performed in a feature film directed by \u00d3scar Parra de Carrizosa. The film *le is Abr\u00e1zame and was shot on location in La Mancha.\n\nShe is considered \"one of the most important actresses in the history of Spain\", and has been described by Spain's press as a \"myth of Spanish cinema.\" She has also been characterized as \"the most beautiful woman of twentieth century Spain.\" She has also been called a \"sexual, feminist, and gay icon for Francoist Spain.\"\n\nPersonal information\n\nMonument to Montiel in Campo de Criptana.\n\nMontiel, whose complete name was Mar\u00eda Antonia Alejandra Vicenta Elpidia Isidora Abad Fern\u00e1ndez, was born in 1928 in Campo de Criptana (Ciudad Real), Spain.
