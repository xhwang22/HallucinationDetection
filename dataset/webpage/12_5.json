Coachella, the Indio, Calif., standard-bearer for festival culture in the U.S., has been postponed from its usual April date until October. And many other live music events have also been affected. Whether or not even more cancellations and postponements occur going forward, the virus has already taken a major toll on the festival industry.\n\nFestival cancellations happen for plenty of reasons, and have financial repercussions for everyone involved: artists, fans, staffers, vendors, and the festival organizers themselves. Last year alone, before the global coronavirus outbreak, at least a dozen music festivals threw in the towel, led by the calamitous Woodstock 50. What happens afterward and who gets paid depends on a few factors, including insurance coverage (or lack thereof) for festivals and artists, and whether the cancellation was voluntary or government-mandated. But the most important factors are the specifics of the deals between promoters and artists. \u201cThe short answer is: What does the contract say?\u201d notes concert insurance veteran Peter Tempkins, whose festival clients have included Warped Tour and Bonnaroo.\n\nThose contracts aren\u2019t typically made public, making it difficult to specifically assess whether any particular artist will be paid for any particular canceled or postponed festival appearance. In the case of Woodstock 50, all performers were compensated in full, thanks to a contract specifying advance payment into an escrow that would be released regardless of whether the concert actually happened, according to a Variety report. But the situation for coronavirus-related cancellations may be different, especially if a local or state government effectively bans an event from taking place, as in the case of SXSW and Ultra, which were shut down in response to mandates from the Austin and Miami mayors.\n\nForce Majeure\n\nTim Epstein, a sports and entertainment lawyer whose festival clients include Pitchfork, Life Is Beautiful, and Riot Fest, explains that government-mandated festival shutdowns may trigger \u201cforce majeure,\u201d a contract provision that lets people off the hook for their obligations under the deal if there are certain unforeseeable circumstances, such as a natural disaster. Epstein believes that most coronavirus-related festival cancellations will happen under similar government-ordered force majeure conditions.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is that the parties are basically returned to their position pre-contract\u2014with an exception being compensation for work performed to that point, for reimbursement of expenses incurred at that point,\u201d Epstein says. \u201cMost of the work is going to be taking place at the time of the event. And so most of the contracts for that work will not require performance because of the force majeure event, nor will it require a payment for the performance that did not occur.\u201d In other words, artists and vendors wouldn\u2019t be paid except for work or expenses from before the festival was canceled.\n\nInsurance for Festivals and Artists\n\nNext up is whether the festival bought an event cancellation insurance policy. But to be covered for communicable diseases, event organizers would need to pay extra for that specific protection from their insurance provider. And in recent weeks, insurers have generally stopped offering insurance coverage for COVID-19 whatsoever. SXSW recently acknowledged that despite having insurance for event cancellation due to terrorism, weather, injury, and other perils, it wasn\u2019t covered for viruses and pandemics. Lacking insurance, a festival\u2019s organizers may incur expenses out-of-pocket for things like staffing and marketing, even if its payments to performers are covered under force majeure."}, {"url": "https://pitchfork.com/news/72013-sxsw-under-fire-over-artist-deportation-contract-clause/", "page_content": "SXSW has been vocal in its opposition to President Trump\u2019s Travel Ban and is working hard to build a coalition of attorneys to assist artists with issues at U.S. ports of entry during the event. We have artists from 62 countries from around the world performing and have always supported our international music community. We have never reported international showcasing artists to immigration authorities.\n\nWe were sorry to learn that one of our invited performers chose to cancel his performance at this year\u2019s SXSW Music Festival due to a misunderstanding of our policies regarding international artists.\n\nWe understand that given the current political climate surrounding immigration, the language that was published seems strong. Violating U.S. immigration law has always carried potentially severe consequences, and we would be remiss not to warn our participating acts of the likely repercussions.\n\nLanguage governing SXSW\u2019s ability to protect a showcase has been in the artist Performance Agreement for many years. It is, and always was intended to be, a safeguard to provide SXSW with a means to respond to an act that does something truly egregious, such as disobeying our rules about pyrotechnics on stage, starting a brawl in a club, or causing serious safety issues.\n\nThe SXSW Performance Agreement states:\n\nIf SXSW determines, in its sole discretion, that Artist or its representatives have acted in ways that adversely affect the viability of Artist\u2019s official SXSW showcase, the following actions are available to SXSW:\n\n\u25cb Artist will be removed from their official SXSW showcase and, at SXSW\u2019s sole option, replaced.\n\n\u25cb Any hotels booked via SXSW Housing will be canceled.\n\n\u25cb Artist\u2019s credentials will be canceled.\n\n\u25cb SXSW will notify the appropriate U.S. immigration authorities of the above actions.\n\nWe hope never to be put in the position to act on this. Indeed, we spend a great deal of time communicating with international artists concerning numerous issues, including how to avoid issues at U.S. ports of entry.\n\nMoreover, there is language in the Performance Agreement which is included to inform foreign artists that the U.S. immigration authorities have mechanisms to create trouble for artists who ignore U.S. immigration laws. For example, those acts coming to SXSW to perform without a work visa are limited, by U.S. immigration law, to performing their showcase event only. If an artist wishes to perform elsewhere, they will require a work visa.\n\nAs such, both to protect SXSW and the interests of all the participating artists, we long ago added this language to our Performance Agreement:\n\n1.4. Foreign Artists entering the country through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), B visa or any non-work visa may not perform at any public or unofficial shows, DAY OR NIGHT, in Austin from March 10-19, 2017. Accepting and performing at unofficial events (including unofficial events aside from SXSW Music dates during their visit to the United States) may result in immediate deportation, revoked passport and denied entry by US Customs Border Patrol at US ports of entry.

Shock. I'll say it now - these were my favourites of the night. I'm not sure if this is a compliment to the band or a criticism of the bill.What they played was a fairly average set of songs; the only real difference would be that cello. Instead of playing it as a classical instrument like so many other experimenters, they played it like a guitar, only with a bow, and sat down. The only thing that detracted from their set was the poor sound levels that made me feel like I was standing next to an amp stack at Wembley, and not the back of the Barfly. That and an irritating need to \"tap in\" every song by the drummer. Surely it couldn't take much effort for the band to share out the task of counting in. It would give some variety at the very least.Apparentlyhad their stuff nicked last night, they also think it's funny to introduce themselves as. Like that's not been done kids. I bet Further have made that joke every night this week. In fact I bet Further probably claimed to be the Datsuns at Customs on coming to the country. The source of this joke? Well Further are from Australia. Erm, aren't the Datsuns from New Zealand?Bands that sing lyrics that repeat \"Goddamnit\" are ten a penny, so are bands that ultimately have a good sound but that should be taken out side and shot to put me out of my misery.are no better. Think of other guitar and percussion only bands and unless your head is inserted in the rear end of the underground you'll probably think ofWinnebago Deal are not like the White Stripes.The White Stripes are good.Spitting isn't big, it's isn't clever. Nor is seemingly playing two different songs over each other; quite possibly three if you include what I shall laughingly refer to as \"lyrics\". It's like when you're eight years old and go to the swimming baths with your school. Whilst (x) is greater than (y) were probably doing the musical equivalent of forty lengths of the front crawl I suspect Winnebago Deal were too busy trying to break out the floats and splashing water in the eyes of those trying to get on with it.Photos bysakura@gigwise.com"}, {"url": "https://pitchfork.com/news/sxsw-faces-class-action-lawsuit-over-ticket-refunds/", "page_content": "SXSW has been served with a class action lawsuit on behalf of ticket buyers who were not offered refunds after the Austin, Texas festival was canceled due to the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nAccording to documents viewed by Pitchfork, the suit was filed on April 24 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas Austin Division by plaintiffs Maria Bromley and Kleber Pauta and charges the festival with breach of contract and unjust enrichment. The suit also claims the festival\u2019s refund and revocation policy renders its own terms & conditions \u201can unenforceable, illusory, unilateral option contract that allows SXSW to sell credentials, cancel the festival for any or no reason whatsoever, and retain all customer payments while leaving plaintiffs and the class without a remedy,\u201d calling the refund and revocation policy \u201cunlawful, unconscionable and unenforceable.\u201d\n\nSXSW 2020 was originally scheduled for March 12\u201320.

The Berlin Wall was standing. The Euro did not exist. Many phones used rotary dials to enter numbers. An Apple Macintosh computer with 128 kilobytes of RAM sold for $5,500 (in 2015 dollars). 40 million music CDs were made and sold worldwide.\n\nThat same year, a small group of people in Austin, Texas began a series of long discussions about the future of entertainment and media. The meetings were in the offices of The Austin Chronicle, and participants were sworn to secrecy. A fundamental opinion shared by the group was that the local creative and music communities were as talented as anywhere else on the planet, but were severely limited by a lack of exposure outside of Austin.\n\nMusic was the uniting factor, but the group had a catholic taste for art and ideas. Inclusiveness and reaching for new things were core values. The solution being discussed was an event that would bring the outside world to Austin for a close-up view.\n\nAs the key ideas were formed, recognition grew that Austin was not the only city where this was an issue. For a local event to bring the world to Austin, it needed to have value everywhere. A name was sought that was not restrictive in its concept.\n\nFinally, in October of 1986, the announcement of the first South By Southwest was made. The SXSW group expected initial resistance from the locals, but it was quite the opposite. Almost everyone wanted to be involved. Resistance would come later.\n\nThe first event, held in March of 1987, saw an expected 150 registrants swell to 700 on the opening day. As hoped for, Austin\u2019s charm won over the visitors, and SXSW took on a life of its own.\n\nGrowth was steady for the first seven years. For SXSW \u201994, often remembered for the Johnny Cash keynote/performance, two new events - Interactive and Film - were introduced. It would mark a fundamental shift in how the world viewed SXSW. Still early in the paradigm shift created by the internet, the film and digital communities found a home in SXSW.\n\nThe event has changed in many surprising and meaningful ways since 1987, but at its core, SXSW remains a tool for creative people to develop their careers by bringing together people from around the globe to meet, learn and share ideas. (And maybe have a few once-in-a-lifetime experiences.)\n\n- Roland Swenson, CEO of SXSW"}]}
