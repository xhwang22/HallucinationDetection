In his childhood, he was no different than other children of his age, and did not exhibit unusual personality traits. Like most other residents of the town, the Ifargan family was a low-class family who originally came from Tiznit, Morocco.[10]\n\nIfargan did not undergo formal rabbinic ordination.[11] He studied in a religious Yeshiva, but dropped out at the age of 17. He spent a year studying mysticism in seclusion, in the forests of northern Israel. Then, at the age of 18 he was enlisted to the Israeli army, and served for three years as required by law. When his father died in 1995, Ifargan began spreading legends on the mystical powers of his father, which he claimed had healing powers and predicted the future. He started performing spiritual activities out of his parent's house, as well as the gravesite estate that he purchased for his father, outside of the Netivot cemetery. Ifargan started claiming that he possessed prophetic powers, by which he can see the future as well as diagnose the health problems of people. A diverse community of miracle-seeking admirers began to form around the young mystic, then 30 years old.

In 2013, Abergel ase well as the Israeli crime boss Shalom Domrani was arrested for threatening Ifargan to support Mayor Yehiel Zohar in the Netivot municipal elections. Abergel\u2019s supporters lobbied for the reelection of Mayor Yehiel Zohar, while Ifergan supported the challenger, Eyal Mesika.[14]\n\nIfergan's aides publish \"Inyan Ba'ir\", a Netivot local newspaper, to get across the rabbi's messages and strengthen his public profile.[15]\n\nTikkun ceremonies\n\nIfargan erected a large, truncated pyramid shaped mausoleum for his father at the top of a hill, entirely covered in white marble. In this location he performs ceremonies, and most importantly, the Tikkun (reparation). The ceremonies are always opened by David Zarfati, Ifargan's master of ceremonies, who instructs the participants, who sing and clap their hands, while loud music is played. Ifargan throws thousands of candles into a bonfire, creating massive flames. Sometimes Ifargan places his hands in the fire but is not burned. Ifargan says that this is a Kabbalistic ceremony. In reality the ceremony is unique in form, and differs significantly from the traditional Kabbalistic Tikkun, which does not include a bonfire.

Jan Koum, who controls a multi-billion-dollar charitable foundation, has not uttered a public word even as many other wealthy Ukrainians and Russians announce donations toward humanitarian relief efforts.\n\nBut based on an examination of tax returns filed by Koum\u2019s foundation before the war, the publicity-shy WhatsApp founder, who arrived in California as a teenager, is more entwined than meets the eye with the events rocking the country he left behind as a 16-year-old. His donations, only a sliver of which have been previously reported, include tens of millions of dollars to Jewish organizations now involved in relief efforts in Eastern Europe.\n\nFor example, from 2019 to 2020, the latest year for which there is a tax return, the Koum Family Foundation donated about $17 million to the European Jewish Association, an organization headquartered in Brussels that launched a campaign in March to provide housing, food and clothing to refugees from the war. Nearly all of the group\u2019s 2019 budget came from Koum.\n\nWith $10.6 million in gifts over that same period, Koum\u2019s foundation is also one of the most significant donors to another group involved in relief efforts: the Federation of Jewish Communities of the CIS. The group, whose name refers to the Commonwealth of Independent States, an association of former Soviet territories, announced the establishment of an ambulance fleet to evacuate patients throughout Ukraine.\n\nIt is unknown whether Koum continued to make donations in 2021 and afterward because his foundation and all of the past grantees contacted by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency have either ignored requests for comment or declined to speak on the record. JTA contacted more than a dozen of the nonprofits, several of which said they were prohibited from publicly acknowledging Koum\u2019s giving as a condition of their gift.\n\nSign up for JTA\u2019s Daily Briefing for the latest headlines. SUBSCRIBE HERE\n\nDue to the secrecy marking his charitable giving, as well as his personal life, Koum\u2019s profile as a philanthropist over the past several years has gone almost unnoticed. However, tax returns reveal that Koum, with a fortune estimated between $9.8 billion and $13.7 billion, has quietly become one of the largest donors to Jewish causes in the world.\n\nHis foundation gave nearly $140 million from 2019 to 2020 to about 70 Jewish charities working in the United States, Eastern Europe and Israel. That\u2019s on par with the rate of giving by the biggest and best-known donors in the Jewish world, such as Tulsa-based Charles and Lynn Schusterman Family Philanthropies, whose imprint is on hundreds of Jewish organizations, including JTA.\n\nAt this level of giving, Koum has an outsized impact on Jewish communal life but without any of the public awareness that often accompanies major philanthropy.\n\nThat Koum has been able to operate under the radar isn\u2019t surprising to Lila Corwin Berman, a professor of American Jewish history at Temple University, who writes about philanthropy.\n\n\u201cWe have a system in place that guards the privacy of donors and requires minimal forms of reporting and oversight,\u201d she said. \u201dOnly by knowing the Koum name can I excavate tax records to see the list of grantees \u2014 and this assumes that the foundation disburses all of its gifts directly, without using community foundations as pass-throughs. The rules as they exist appear to value the donor\u2019s privacy and autonomy above the public\u2019s knowledge.\u201d\n\nTransparency about funding should be particularly important when it comes to Jewish nonprofits because of their goal of \u201cstitchi[ing] together the broad diversity of Jewish life,\u201d according to Corwin Berman.\n\n\u201cThe Jewish public should care because such a large funder can inevitably sculpt and set communal priorities,\u201d she said.\n\nwhich provides religious and humanitarian services in far-flung Jewish communities, runs an array of current activities in the region. An analysis of the Koum foundation\u2019s tax returns reflects that, more than any other cause, Koum gives to nonprofits affiliated with Chabad-Lubavitch, the international and growing Hasidic Orthodox Jewish movement with origins in Eastern Europe. Chabad,runs an array of current activities in the region.\n\nThe European Jewish Association, for example, is led by a Chabad-affiliated rabbi, and the Federation of Jewish Communities of the CIS counts Berel Lazar, a major Chabad rabbi who leads Russia\u2019s Jewish community, as a director. Koum has also given to several Chabad congregations in California and other organs of the movement.\n\nOne of Koum\u2019s top Chabad-linked grantees is a nonprofit known as the Jewish Community Center of Moscow, whose address leads to a brown-brick residential building in Brooklyn, a few minutes\u2019 walk away from Chabad\u2019s global headquarters in Crown Heights.\n\nThe organization has no website, and since it is classified as a religious organization, the Jewish Community Center of Moscow is exempt from filing paperwork detailing its mission, leadership or financial activity, as is required of other types of nonprofits. But a review of IRS records suggests that a typical donation to the organization ranged from $15,000-$55,000 for a number of years until, in 2019, the pattern changed. That\u2019s when the Koum foundation gave the nonprofit $3.3 million. In 2020, it gave $5.7 million.\n\nNo one reached by JTA would speak on the record about Koum\u2019s motivations, but Chabad is popular among Jews who grew up in the former Soviet Union.\n\n\u201cIn their outreach, mode of operations and philosophy Chabad have been very welcoming and helpful to Russian-speaking Jews,\u201d said Misha Galperin, a consultant to donors and charities and the president of the National Museum of American Jewish History, who grew up in the Soviet Union.\n\nGalperin said this affinity exists despite the lack of religious observance among many Jews from the former Soviet Union.\n\n\u201cMost Jews from the former Soviet Union are not observant, and they\u2019re not particularly interested in following the commandments in the way that Chabad understands them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they [Chabad] look like Jews \u2014 in other religions, you might think of priests and imams as having a uniform. In Judaism, it\u2019s [Chabad] Lubavitch and other Hasidim who have a look. So many Russian-speaking Jews think of Chabad as \u2018my synagogue that I won\u2019t go to.\u2019\u201d\n\nJoshua Tapper, a historian of Soviet Jewry who has written about Chabad\u2019s success with this demographic, said the movement offers an appealing message for people whose Jewish identity was suppressed by Soviet authorities.\n\n\u201cChabad\u2019s rhetoric is that \u2018our movement was born here, we survived many decades underground, in the Soviet wilderness, getting by on our wits and our religious fervor and belief in God, and now we\u2019ve reclaimed our rightful place as the leader of Russian-speaking Jewry,\u2019\u201d said Tapper, who is a graduate student at Stanford University and former reporter for JTA.\n\nKoum\u2019s donations are not limited to Chabad or even to religious groups. He is also a major supporter of the Israeli healthcare system with gifts to Hadassah and to the U.S. fundraising affiliates of various Israeli hospitals.\n\nHe also donates millions to Jewish institutions in the San Francisco Bay Area, such as the Oshman Family Jewish Community Center in Silicon Valley. Tax records also reveal that he is the previously anonymous donor behind a new $3.5 million center for the Russian-speaking Jewish community of San Francisco.\n\nAt least a few of his donations reflect his right-wing political views on Israel. Donations of $600,000 went to the Maccabee Task Force Foundation, an organization founded by the late Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson to support Israel advocacy on college campuses. The foundation has also given $6 million to Friends of Ir David, the American fundraising arm of Elad, a group trying to expand Jewish settlement in parts of largely Arab East Jerusalem, and $175,000 to the Central Fund of Israel, which has been accused of supporting violent extremists in Israel.\n\nThe Koum foundation\u2019s only major non-Jewish gifts have gone to two universities: $1 million to Fordham in 2020 and some $41 million to Stanford since 2017. His affinity for these institutions is somewhat surprising considering that the only university Koum has attended is San Jose State University, from which he dropped out to focus on his first major job in tech, at Yahoo.\n\nKoum\u2019s story is a real-life rags-to-riches tale of an immigrant who came to the United States with nothing, sought to improve his lot, worked hard and became fabulously wealthy as he developed a product used by billions of people every day. Since he has granted very few interviews, most of what\u2019s known about his life can be gleaned from only a few sources, most notably a profile by Forbes penned as he and his partners sold WhatsApp to Facebook for $22 billion in 2014.\n\nA previously unreported lawsuit filed against Koum in Los Angeles by a former employee at one of his mega-mansions last year helps fill in the years since the acquisition and following Koum\u2019s departure from Facebook in 2018. It reflects an account of Koum as a hoarder of some of the most expensive homes in California and a zealous protector of his own privacy.\n\nKoum was raised on the outskirts of Kyiv in the town Fastiv, which happened to be shelled by Russian forces early in the current war.\n\nIn 1992, after the fall of the Soviet Union and amid political turmoil and antisemitic tension, a teen-aged Koum his mother immigrated to Mountain View, California, and began living in a two-bedroom apartment made available through public assistance. His father stayed behind and died in 1997.\n\nThey relied on food stamps as his mom earned money babysitting and Koum swept the floors of a grocery store for work. His mom was soon diagnosed with cancer, entitling the family to disability payments for a while. She died in 2000, leaving Koum an orphan at 24.\n\nHis self-education in computer networking brought him into contact with the emerging startup world in Silicon Valley, and he eventually went to work for Yahoo with his future WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton. The two bonded over their shared no-nonsense attitude. \u201cNeither of us has an ability to bullshit,\u201d Acton told Forbes.\n\nThe duo left Yahoo in 2007 to take a sabbatical, which was spent traveling South America and playing Ultimate Frisbee. In a twist that would prove ironic, they each applied to work at Facebook but were rejected.\n\nIn 2009, the iPhone had only recently been launched, and the App Store was only seven months old. Koum saw opportunity in this new mobile frontier and he began brainstorming ideas with members of the Russian-speaking community of San Jose. Forbes describes long conversations about WhatsApp over tea between Koum and Alex Fishman, a graduate of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, who played host to the community at his apartment in San Jose.\n\nWithin two years of WhatsApp\u2019s launch, it was among the most downloaded apps in the still-nascent world of apps, offering free, encrypted texts, phone calls, videos and other content. The company remained on a steep growth curve and by early 2013, WhatsApp had 200 million active users and a staff of 50.\n\nThe scrappy startup, operating out of a low-profile building without so much as a logo in sight, caught the attention of Mark Zuckerberg. After a protracted courtship, Zuckerberg got Koum and Acton to agree to a sale, and Facebook bought WhatsApp for $22 billion in cash and stock in 2014. On Koum\u2019s initiative, the three signed the deal while standing outside the building that formerly housed the welfare agency where Koum received food stamps.\n\nKoum stayed on with the company, joining Facebook\u2019s board of directors, but in 2018 he announced he was stepping down. The Washington Post reported that Koum left over Facebook\u2019s increasingly lax privacy practices.\n\nThe window into Koum\u2019s thinking narrowed at this time because of his lack of engagement with the press, but the billionaire did communicate some of his thoughts on Facebook to roughly 90,000 people following his posts. He was sharing links to pro-Trump and anti-immigration articles and expressed a hardline pro-Israel stance. Eventually, he all but stopped posting to social media.\n\nIt\u2019s largely a mystery how Koum spends his time nowadays. For a campaign donation made last year, the 46-year-old Koum declared his occupation as \u201cretired.\u201d\n\nHe is known to own six enormous mansions in the Silicon Valley enclave of Atherton and in Malibu, at least two of which are worth something close to $100 million.\n\nHe established a company for the sole purpose of operating these properties, according to a lawsuit by a former employee of the company named Carina Walker. In 2019, she was hired at an annual salary of $100,000 to maintain the landscaping at just one of these properties, in Malibu. About three months later, she was fired. Walker soon sued Koum, claiming he dismissed her because her disability and medical condition in violation of anti-discriminatory protections.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Koum is averse to the sight of hired help. \u201c[W]henever it was determined that Koum would arrive at one of his properties, his employees were forced to scramble off whichever property Koum was visiting in order to avoid being seen by him,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nThe year Koum sold WhatsApp he transferred $556 million to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, a charity that distributes money on behalf of donors. It\u2019s unknown where this money may have gone. But the following year, Koum established his own foundation, and a small view into Koum\u2019s affairs opened up.\n\nHe seeded the foundation with hundreds of millions of dollars in Facebook stock, building toward an endowment that was valued at more than $2 billion in 2020. Although tax returns detailing his giving are not yet available past that year, the legal requirement that a foundation dispense at least 5% of its assets each year suggests that his charitable donations have only ramped up since.\n\nKoum\u2019s devotion to funding Chabad and other Jewish groups became increasingly apparent starting in the foundation\u2019s 2018 tax returns.\n\nAside from the earlier pro-Israel statements, he didn\u2019t have much of a public Jewish identity, so the disclosure of these donations would seem to come out of nowhere.\n\nBut Koum\u2019s adventures in philanthropy continue a tradition of giving by Jews from the former Soviet Union, as well as a recent wave of philanthropy driven by new wealth in the community.\n\nLena Katsnelson, the director of UJA FSU, the division of UJA-Federation of New York focused on Jews of the former Soviet Union, noted there\u2019s a history of more than 30 years of charitable giving by this community.\n\nGalperin, meanwhile, noted that Koum isn\u2019t the only donor in what he characterizes as a wave of Russian-speaking Jews who have become wealthy in tech and other sectors. He gave the examples of Russian-born Eugene Fooksman, who joined WhatsApp early to work as a software engineer, and founded a foundation that made some $1.1 million in donations in 2020, and Max Levchin, a co-founder of PayPal, who was born in Ukraine and makes donations to various Jewish causes but not through a dedicated foundation.\n\n\u201cThis generation took its time to settle down, develop the means and the interests to become philanthropists,\u201d Galperin said,\n\nHe added that among all Jews, this group has a particular history that primes many to donate to Jewish causes above all else.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because for many of them, the act of leaving the Soviet Union and coming to whether it\u2019s Israel or the United States or Canada, have a lot to do with their Jewish identity,\u201d he said.\n\nJacob Henry contributed reporting to this story."}, {"url": "https://www.jta.org/2019/05/06/health/his-company-was-sold-to-staples-now-this-businessman-immerses-himself-in-the-fight-against-cancer", "page_content": "One of the first things Steve Miller and Bruce Barron did when planning their venture capital firm, Origin Ventures, was to send the business plan to Steve\u2019s father, Harvey, for his input.\n\nA legendary Chicago businessman and prominent philanthropist, Harvey L. Miller and his two brothers had built the Quill Corp. from a tiny company housed in their father\u2019s live poultry shop into a national supplier of office products. In 1998, they sold the company to Staples.\n\n\u201cHarvey had yellow Post-it notes on just about every page of our document,\u201d Barron recalled. \u201cHe wanted to understand every detail.\u201d\n\nThat kind of attention was a hallmark of Miller\u2019s business career. For more than four decades, Miller was Quill\u2019s operations chief, helping to oversee a company that eventually grew to employ 1,200 people, shipped 72 million catalogs annually and operated distribution centers in eight locations across North America.\n\nThat attention to detail carries into Miller\u2019s philanthropy. More than just writing checks, Miller has regularly immersed himself in the organizations he supports, serving on their boards, attending their meetings and bringing his creativity to bear in helping to advance their missions.\n\n\u201cYou really want to to know to whom and for what you are donating,\u201d the 86-year-old Miller said, \u201cand what you\u2019re expecting out of it. And what you are going to expect in the way of operations and so forth. To me, that\u2019s philanthropy.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, that propensity led Miller to launch a groundbreaking collaboration between the California-based cancer center City of Hope and the Israel Cancer Research Fund, or ICRF, which funds cancer research in Israel across a variety of institutions. Named for Barron and his wife, Jacki, the five-year, $5 million program aims to advance cancer research by awarding joint research grants, supporting sabbaticals for researchers and hosting an annual symposium to share research discoveries.\n\n\u201cThis is transformational philanthropy,\u201d said Dr. Mark Israel, ICRF\u2019s national executive director. \u201cIt goes beyond research support to provide a vehicle and the means for Israeli cancer researchers to work collaboratively and collegially with investigators at City of Hope.\u201d\n\nThe initiative came about through a series of fortuitous connections. Barron first became involved in the ICRF when the organization honored Dr. Steven Rosen, the oncologist who cured his wife of breast cancer. Barron in turn asked Harvey Miller, whom he became acquainted with through his partnership with Steve Miller, if he would co-chair a 2015 dinner that ICRF was holding in the Barrons\u2019 honor.\n\n\u201cFor more than 20 years, Harvey\u2019s vision has helped guide City of Hope\u2019s mission to advance new therapies for those on the cancer journey,\u201d said Rosen, director of City of Hope\u2019s Comprehensive Cancer Center. \u201cWe are blessed to have Harvey\u2019s guidance and support of our partnership with ICRF through the Barron program, bringing an international focus on developing insights into the complexities of cancer and innovative ways to help find new cures.\u201d\n\nRather than just lend his name to the event, the elder Miller started to think about how he could have a deeper impact. As it happened, Rosen in 2014 had become the provost and chief scientific officer at City of Hope, which had long been the charity of choice of the office products industry. Miller already was a longtime supporter.\n\n\u201cI thought that was a pretty nice connection,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI called Dr. Rosen and I said I\u2019d like to do something to honor Bruce and Jacki, and it seems to me that the top researchers at the City of Hope would benefit greatly by collaborating with the great researchers in Israel, who would also benefit greatly by collaborating with you.\u201d\n\nMiller knows a thing or two about successful collaborations. Quill\u2019s growth was itself the result of a remarkable partnership between Miller and his brothers. Each had his own domain: Jack did sales, Arnold handled the money and Harvey made sure the products were delivered.\n\nIt\u2019s a partnership that almost never happened.\n\nA native of the Albany Park neighborhood of Chicago \u2014 he still lives in the city\u2019s suburbs \u2014 Miller initially had pursued medicine, enrolling in a premed program at the University of Illinois. But within a year he had dropped out and joined the Navy. Over the next three years he circled the globe twice on a destroyer, specializing in underwater sound detection. On his return to Chicago in 1954, he found work at an electrical supply company earning $90 a week.\n\nJack launched Quill in 1956 and asked Harvey to join him, but Miller demurred. He had a decent job, was pursuing an electrical engineering degree at night and had a young son. But a year later he had a change of heart. Again, he dropped out of school.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been told many times if I had finished college I could have been a success,\u201d Miller notes dryly.\n\nQuill did fine in its early years, and when Arnold joined in 1974, it began to really take off. The company was doing $5 million in sales at the time. By the time it sold to Staples in 1998, that number had increased more than a hundredfold.\n\nAlong the way, the company won a landmark Supreme Court case that effectively freed Quill\u2019s customers from paying sales tax on interstate purchases, a ruling that remained in effect until last year.\n\nAfter the Staples sale, the brothers began developing real estate around Chicago, but philanthropy remained a major focus. In addition to the ICRF, Miller is a major supporter of a number of causes, including the Illinois Holocaust Museum, Chicago\u2019s Shedd Aquarium and the Jewish Theological Seminary, whose cantorial school is named for him.\n\n\u201cThe example that my parents set and continue to set is that when you are blessed with wealth, you have a deep responsibility to give back,\u201d Steve Miller said.\n\nMiller\u2019s gift to the ICRF is already going to support some promising research avenues. One study being funded by the program aims to understand how various bacteria in the gastrointestinal track can cause lung cancer to become resistant to chemotherapy treatments. Another project focuses on a class of drugs that can both enhance brain tumor imaging during MRIs and kill the tumors themselves.\n\nMiller continues to stay involved in monitoring the impact of his gift. He has attended both symposia held under the auspices of the Jacki and Bruce Barron Cancer Research Scholars\u2019 Program \u2014 in Duarte, California, and Jerusalem \u2014 where the researchers involved shared their findings.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t understand a damn thing they were talking about,\u201d Miller conceded. \u201cThey\u2019re talking their language. I don\u2019t speak that language.\n\n\u201cMy purpose for going and my purpose for being in that room is to show support, to add a personal touch, to keep them grounded. I want to keep reminding everyone that the purpose and goal of my funding, and the result of all this research, must be cures and treatments for cancer.\u201d"}]}
