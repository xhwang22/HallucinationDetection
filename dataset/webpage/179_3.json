As the Populist Party nominee, Bryan had another running mate as well, Thomas E. Watson. Sewall never held elective office, although he was a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1888 to 1896.\n\nArthur Sewall's main claim to fame had been as an exceptionally successful, wealthy shipbuilder and New England industrialist. He was a director of the Maine Central railroad and President of the Bath National Bank for years. His selection is believed to have been an effort to win votes among conservative and New England members of the party who were disturbed by the populist aspects of William Jennings Bryan. Arthur Sewall is also one of the few politicians to be an adherent of Swedenborgianism, a religion based on the writings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg.\n\nHis main vice-presidential opponent, Garret A. Hobart (Rep), was also an Eastern banker and industrialist who had served on his party's national committee.\n\nSewall was Bryan's running mate for the first of Bryan's three times as the Democratic presidential nominee. He died not long after Bryan was nominated for the second time in 1900.\n\nSewall's grandson, Sumner Sewall, served as Governor of Maine from 1941 to 1945, as a Republican.\n\nLegacy\n\nIn 2008, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch referenced Sewall in an article criticizing Senator John McCain's selection of Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential candidate in the 2008 presidential election, saying he had picked \"the least qualified running mate since the Swedenborgian shipbuilder Arthur Sewall ran as William Jennings Bryan's No. 2 in 1896.\""}, {"url": "https://www.boothbayregister.com/article/olin-sewall-pettingill-author-cinematographer-and-mainer/79276", "page_content": "We have written in these pages before about some of the past ornithologists that have lived in and been inspired by the birds and other natural wonders of our state. John James Audubon had a connection here, as did famed field guide artist and author Roger Tory Peterson, and even James Bond, whose book \u201cBirds of the West Indies\u201d was said to have been the source for the name of Ian Fleming\u2019s famous spy. The real James Bond summered on Mount Desert Island and also wrote a short book on the birds of the area.\n\nBut one Maine-born ornithologist that fewer people may have heard of is Olin Sewall Pettingill Jr. Born in 1907 in Belgrade and preferring to be called Sewall, he spent much of his formative young life in Maine, including summers at his grandparent\u2019s farm in Belgrade and a year at Kents Hill School in Mount Vernon.\n\nSewall\u2019s interest in birds was guided and focused when he attended Bowdoin College and studied with another well-known Maine ornithologist, Alfred Gross. While there he began learning about photography and videography, and traveled with Gross to document the last three remaining heath hens on Martha Vineyard before they became extinct a few years later.\n\nPettingill went on to attend our graduate school alma mater, Cornell University, where he completed a doctorate in 1933 on the American woodcock under the supervision of another famed ornithologist, Arthur Allen, the founder of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.\n\nSewall taught at Carleton College in Minnesota for 17 years. While there he wrote an ornithology textbook for use in his own ornithology class. That book, \u201cOrnithology in Laboratory and Field,\u201d was published and updated in multiple editions over decades and was one of the most widely used ornithology textbooks in North America. Our copy was given to us years ago by Dr. John Mudge, the former biology professor at the University of Maine at Farmington who used it in his courses there.\n\nBirders today take for granted the proliferation of birding site guides that help birders find birding locations with ease. But back in Pettingill\u2019s time, those books didn\u2019t exist. Sewall himself was the pioneer, writing two 700-page volumes, \u201cA Guide to Bird Finding East of the Mississippi\u201d and \u201cA Guide to Bird Finding West of the Mississippi\u201d in the early 1950s. Having worked on site guides ourselves for more restricted geographic regions, the immensity of the region he covered in these guides is impressive. For years these books were the key resources used by North American birders to guide them to birding hotspots when they visited new areas of the country.\n\nIf all this writing was not enough, Sewall was also a pioneer in bird and wildlife cinematography. He produced a number of bird and wildlife movies from his own footage and contributed to a number of other movies from the 1940s through the 1970s. Some of his photography and filming took place in remote regions including in the Falkland Islands, New Zealand, Iceland, northern Canada, and many other locations. He was a popular speaker on the so-called Audubon Screen Tours when filmmakers like himself showed their films and narrated them. In fact, one of us (Jeff) had the opportunity as a teenager to see Pettingill present one of these movies in Farmington.\n\nSewall went on to become the director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in 1960, where he remained until his retirement in 1973. He continued to update his many books and write some new ones throughout his retirement years, spending much of his time at a family home in Wayne, Maine. He passed away in 2001 at the age of 94.\n\nJeffrey V. Wells, Ph.D., is a Fellow of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Dr. Wells is one of the nation's leading bird experts and conservation biologists and author of the \u201cBirder\u2019s Conservation Handbook.\u201d His grandfather, the late John Chase, was a columnist for the Boothbay Register for many years. Allison Childs Wells, formerly of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, is a senior director at the Natural Resources Council of Maine, a nonprofit membership organization working statewide to protect the nature of Maine.

The family moved three years later after Philip accepted a teaching job at Lombard College, a Universalist college in Galesburg, Illinois. The ancestry of the Wright family could be traced through 16th century England to the 7th century reign of Charlemagne, and many of Sewall\u2019s ancestors were distinguished educated and innovative individuals. Wright would later profess a great interest in heredity; in the example of his life, he certainly manifested the genes of past success.\n\nWright and his brothers, Quincy and Theodore Paul, were very gifted children. Although they did not initially attend official schools, they were reading and writing at unusually early ages. Sewall entered the \u201cpublishing\u201d arena at the age of seven with his pamphlet on various animals\u2019 physical characteristics. Also, he was then able to extract cube roots, to the disgust of the other children. The atmosphere at the school was not conducive to learning, and Wright had to avoid participation for fear of sparking the ire of the other boys with his knowledge.\n\nFrom his youth, Wright was fascinated with math and mathematical models. He would often waste afternoons playing with his mother\u2019s balance in the kitchen, and she would in turn teach him arithmetical methods. The Wright parents were fond of reading to their children, and in the home a highly intellectual atmosphere was continually fostered. Wright, however, did not want to follow his father\u2019s suggestions to study poetry; he instead was enthralled by nature. Wright attended Galesburg High School, graduating in 1906 to enroll in Lombard College to concentrate on mathematics and surveying.\n\nAt the College, Sewall Wright\u2019s interest in biology was spurred by Professor Wilhelmine Entemann Key, one of the first women to earn a Ph.D from the University of Chicago. This interest led Wright to study at Cold Spring Harbor during the summers of 1911 and 1912, after which he entered the University of Illinois for graduate work in biology. After graduating with a Master\u2019s degree in 1912. he accepted an opportunity to work with Ernest William Castle of Harvard\u2019s Bussey Institution. The research would concentrate on mammalian genetics, particularly as exhibited in guinea pigs.\n\nFor his Ph.D, he investigated the inheritance of coat colors in the animals, received the degree in 1915, and went on to work on animal husbandry for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C, where his task was to improve livestock. Wright suggested, producing via inbreeding to promote genetic dominance over fringe traits. \u201cSystems of Matings,\u201d published in 1921, was the culmination of mathematical work on selection and breeding. Eventually, he would continue this line of investigation in studying population demographics.\n\nWright decided to return to the work that he loved best, and joined the faculty of the University of Chicago to teach and research genetics. He embarked upon a distinguished career of publication at the university level, writing on genetics in populations and path analyses that could be applied to mathematical and social scientific models. Wright\u2019s achievements in these areas were groundbreaking.\n\nAs a statistician, Wright began work in 1917 with covariant analyses to determine the importance of various factors in defining traits. This expertise was extended into animal breeding. Mammalian genetics was one of his main interests. At the Bussey Institution, he was concerned with studies of rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits. Wright published on color inheritance in 1917 and 1918, the year in which he pioneered path analyses in his study of body characteristics in animals.\n\nOn evolution, Sewall Wright was surely one of the most renowned researchers of the century. Wright developed a theory that attributed a substantial amount of genetic variance or \u201ccreativity\u201d to small genetic fluctuations among small population groups. This was an innovative idea and caused the well-documented debate with the Englishman R.A. Fisher, who insisted that variance could be analyzed only in relation to large populations. Wright specialized in this field of population genetics while a professor at the University of Chicago.\n\nOne of Wright\u2019s peculiar interests was in inbreeding, perhaps because his parents were in fact first cousins. His extensive guinea pig crosses were also notable.\n\nUpon mandatory retirement from the University of Chicago in 1955 at the age of 65, Wright entered the University of Wisconsin, and became the Leon J. Cole Professor of Genetics for 5 years. As a secondary interest, Wright also engaged in philosophy. On the philosophy of science, he expressed to the American Society of Naturalists in 1952, \u201cIt is the task of science, as a collective human undertaking, to describe from the external side, such statistical regularity as there is in a world in which every event has a unique aspect, and to indicate where possible the limits of such description. It is not a part of its task to make imaginative interpretations of the internal aspect of reality. The only qualification is in the field of introspective psychology in which each human being is both observer and observed, and regularities may be established by comparing notes.\u201d\n\nWright was known to be shy and unassuming but intense in academic matters. James Crow of the University of Wisconsin\u2019s Genetics Department traveled to Chicago with a student of his to ask Wright some questions on genetic experiments. Wright disappointed the men when he responded to each question that he was \u201cunable to answer\u201d it. The men left disillusioned, only to find that Wright had researched each question, and had written a 14- page response attending to every possible intricacy of each question. Professor Millard Sussman, who was the dean of the University of Wisconsin Medical School, offered that Wright was \u201ca remarkable man . who lived his entire life for population genetics and related areas of research.\u201d\n\nIn evolutionary biology Wright created a particularly outstanding work, Evolution and the Genetics of Populations, in four parts, of which the final volume was released in 1978 when he was 98 and he was \u201cretired. \u201d Among the numerous awards and honorary degrees received by Wright were the Balzan Prize (1984), Medal of the Royal Society of London (1980), the National Medal of Science (1966), the Weldon Medal of the Royal Society of London (1947), the Elliott and Kimber Awards from the National Academy of Sciences (1947 and 1956), and the Lewis Prize from the American Philosophical Society. Wright\u2019s biographer, William Provine, predicted that \u201chistorians and biologists in the 21st century will look upon Wright as perhaps the single most influential evolutionary theorist of this century.\u201d\n\nSewall Wright married Louise Williams, a genetics teacher at Smith College, in 1921, and they had three children Elizabeth Rose, Richard, and Robert. He was a Unitarian, and attended church in Madison during the years when the minister was Max Gaebler.\n\nSewall Wright died on March 3, 1988, at the age of 99, after a long and very productive life.\n\n\u2014 by Edric Lescouflair, a student of Sewall Wright.\n\nThe Career of Sewall Wright\n\nby James F. Crow, Professor Emeritus of Genetics and Medical Genetics, University of Wisconsin\n\nSewall Wright\u2019s untimely death occurred after complications from a fractured pelvis, the result of his slipping on an icy spot during one of his daily long walks. It may seem strange to regard a death in his 99th year as untimely, but not for Wright. He was eagerly looking forward to participating in this summer\u2019s International Congress of Genetics in Toronto and enjoying banter about what to do in his second century. Only a few hours before his death he was discussing his most recent paper, wondering whether his reprints had arrived, signing a check for the coming month\u2019s rent, and wondering how he could handle his income tax from the hospital. Yet in many ways a sudden death was a blessing. A long confining illness would have been very hard for one accustomed, as he was, to a high level of physical and mental activity. Walking and, when possible, swimming were very important to him, and he couldn\u2019t read in a hospital bed.\n\nWright\u2019s death marks the end of an era. He had been for many years the sole survivor among those who established genetics as a solid science starting about 1915, a group that included Muller, Stadler, Sturtevant, Bridges, Fisher, and Haldane. With the latter two he founded the subject of population genetics and gave natural and artificial selection a quantitative basis.\n\nWright\u2019s life and work are abundantly documented. There is a full-length biography, a reprinting of 42 of his 212 and several shorter articles. Provine has taped more than 120 hours of interviews and has preserved virtually all of Wright\u2019s voluminous correspondence. There is also an oral history. Future historians will have a plethora of material. Because so much has been written about his professional life, and much more will be, I have elected to give a more personal account of this amazing man.\n\nWright\u2019s first paper was published in 1912 and his last in 1988, a span of 76 years. Wright\u2019s four volume series was written in his late 70s and 80s. His last paper appeared in the January, 1988 issue of the American Naturalist. He retained his intellectual vigor until the end. Although his eyesight deteriorated badly, he learned to read with a machine that projected the printed page onto a television screen. He always liked history and biography, but only in his later years did he have the leisure to indulge this interest. In his last few weeks he read biographies of Jefferson, Tchaikovsky, Einstein, and the Kennedys and Fitzgeralds. And he could discuss them in detail. He was dissatisfied with the Einstein biography, and asked for a book with less personal life and more relativity.\n\nWright\u2019s intellectual life extended far beyond the normal range in both directions. He was also a precocious child. At age seven, before starting school, he wrote a pamphlet entitled \u201cThe Wonders of Nature\u201d which still exists. It included sections about constellations, squashes, ants, dinosaurs, bees, marmosets, and the story of a wren that could not be dissuaded from nesting in the family mailbox. His report on the chicken gizzard is typical: \u201cHave you ever examined the gizzard of a fowl? The gizzard of a fowl is a deep red color with blue at the top. First on the outside is a very thick muscle. Under this is a white and fleecy layer. Holding very tight to the other. I expect you know that chickens eat sand. The next two layers are rough and rumply. These layers hold the sand. They grind the food. One night when we had company we had chicken pie. Our Aunt Polly cut open the gizzard, and in it we found a lot of grain, and some corn.\u201d\n\nPhilip Wright, Sewall\u2019s father, was a polymath and was on the faculty of tiny Lombard College in Galesburg, Illinois. He taught mathematics, astronomy, surveying, economics, physical education, and English composition. He loved poetry and music and was disappointed that Sewall did not take to them. He had a printing press on which he printed his poems, as well as the College bulletins. Sewall and his brothers, Quincy and Theodore, printed the first poems of Carl Sandburg, who was a student in their father\u2019s composition class. Philip Wright later moved to Harvard and the Brookings Institution where he published a number of books on economics. One of them, The Tariff on Animal and Vegetable Oils, included an appendix by Sewall; Quincy went on to become a distinguished scholar in the field of international law, while Theodore was chief engineer at Curtis-Wright, a Civil Aeronautics commissioner, and acting president of Cornell University. He is said to have turned down the presidency because he didn\u2019t like raising money.\n\nSewall Wright was born December 21, 1889, in Melrose, Massachusetts, but grew up in Galesburg, Illinois, where he attended Lombard College. He learned about the subject of genetics by reading Punnett\u2019s account of Mendelism in the Encyclopedia Brittanica. Although biologists regard Wright as a formidable mathematician, he never took any advanced courses; his math, beyond what he learned from his father, was self-taught.\n\nBetween his third and fourth years of college, he made use of his surveying and mathematical skills by working with a crew surveying for a railroad line in the Standing Rock Reservation in South Dakota. It was an exciting time for him, in the Old West tradition with cowboys, Indians, mule skinners and outlaws; and he loved to tell about it. Late in the year he developed a lung infection and had to stay in a caboose. He was not too ill, however, to climb on the roof to see Halley\u2019s comet. While confined to the caboose, he read Tait\u2019s (1890) book on Quaternions. After his death I found what must be the same book, with many of the problems checked, these presumably being the ones that he had worked. It appears that he got about half way through the book. Curiously, J. B. S. Haldane also read Tait\u2019s book on Quaternions under strikingly similar circumstances\u2014while recovering from wounds in World War I. As far as I know, neither of them made use of this technique in his later work. One consequence of Wright\u2019s lung infection was that he was refused life insurance by New England Mutual, something he found increasingly amusing as his age advanced far beyond the usual life expectancy.\n\nUpon graduation from Lombard, he received a fellowship at the University of Illinois. During this year William Castle visited the campus and, after an interview with Wright, hired him on the spot as an assistant. Wright\u2019s Ph.D. from Harvard came in 1915. His thesis was on coat colors in guinea pigs, but he also worked out ways to measure inbreeding during this time.\n\nFrom 1915 to 1925 he was senior animal husbandman in the United States Department of Agriculture. During this period he did his classical studies on inbreeding and factor interaction in guinea pigs, the analysis of livestock breeds, and the method of path analysis. The last was a novel method for interpreting correlations in complex causal systems. His original paper on path analysis, \u201cCorrelation and Causation,\u201d was rejected by the Bureau of Animal Industry, but was later published, thanks to the intercession of his colleague G. N. Collins, a leading maize geneticist. Wright also had trouble with the publication of his monumental analysis of corn and hog correlations. It was rejected by the officials in the Department of Agriculture on the grounds that an animal husbandman had no business writing about economics. Henry Wallace, later to become Vice President, eventually learned of the paper and, through the influence of his father, then Secretary of Agriculture, arranged for its publication. This may well have been the zenith of the Harding administration.\n\nIn 1926 Wright moved to the University of Chicago where he continued his guinea pig studies and wrote his influential papers on evolutionary theory. There he had several graduate students who went on to distinguished careers. Curiously, only one did a thesis in population genetics and none in mathematical theory; Wright\u2019s emphasis at the time was on developmental and physiological genetics. At age 65 he retired from Chicago and was for 5 years Professor at the University of Wisconsin. Frugal Wisconsin never paid him a full salary, only a supplement to his Chicago retirement annuity. For this, the University got more than 30 years of Wright quality work\u2014surely the best bargain Wisconsin ever had.\n\nAn aspect of Wright\u2019s life that is not fully appreciated was his great service to others. While at the United States Department of Agriculture he answered, fully and conscientiously, numerous letters from farmers and breeders. He had heavy teaching responsibilities at the University of Chicago, often two courses in the same term. His lectures were always carefully prepared, and he was in the labs himself.\n\nHe was often called on to review manuscripts, difficult ones especially. He was one of the most frequent reviewers for Genetics. Many a published paper is better for Wright\u2019s attention. Once, as an anonymous reviewer, he spent an enormous amount of time re-analyzing the data in a paper on mouse genetics, and reached the opposite conclusion. The author simply rewrote the conclusion. Wright\u2019s reputation as a reviewer was so great that he was sometimes credited with reviews he didn\u2019t write.\n\nWright was quiet, shy, introverted, and uneasy with small talk. He liked to talk, but only when there was substance. Conversations were often strained until the right button was pressed; then he was off on what was typically a long monologue. He liked to talk about his ancestors (for example, Judge Samuel Sewall, of Salem witchcraft fame), the connections between some of these ancestors and characters in Shakespeare\u2019s historical plays, his childhood, his days on the railroad surveying crew, his travels, his guinea pigs, and, of course, his theory of evolution. All who heard him as a lecturer and teacher have vivid, affectionate memories of his crowding an enormous amount of factual information into a lecture; his talking and writing at breakneck speed; his note-cards, illegible to all but him; his covering the blackboard with symbols and his clothes with chalk, and erasing the board with any object at hand (although he denied the story of his using a guinea pig for this purpose); and, above all, his invariably running overtime. His wife Louise repeatedly reminded him to confine his lecture to the allotted time. He duly promised, but simply found it impossible to omit details.\n\nWright has had an abundance of medals, prizes and awards, essentially all for which a population geneticist is eligible. He has had a number of honorary degrees although, as he liked to say, far fewer than Herbert Hoover. He has been president of the Genetics Society of America, the American Society of Zoologists, the Society of Naturalists, the Society for the Study of Evolution, and the Tenth International Congress of Genetics. To mention one more, he was the only geneticist ever to be elected a fellow of the Econometric Society. He method of path analysis, which uses correlations to analyze complex interrelationships in nonexperimental data, has recently become de rigueur in some social sciences. At Wright\u2019s 90th birthday banquet a Wisconsin sociologist said that Wright\u2019s contributions were such that the Sociology Department was prepared to offer him an assistant professorship.\n\nWright married Louise Williams, who, in contrast to her husband, was an easy conversationalist and made friends readily. She especially liked to travel, and encouraged him to take long automobile trips which they both enjoyed. She died in 1975 leaving him very lonely, although this was not apparent; he was not one to share such feelings with others.\n\nMy favorite anecdote epitomizes this modest, unselfish man with his self-deprecating wit that I want to repeat it. While writing his books he received a modest stipend from the National Science Foundation and during this time the Foundation offered to provide an inflationary adjustment to his pay. He was in his late 80s at the time. When I brought him this good news, he replied that, according to his careful calculations, his productivity was declining at exactly the same rate as the value of the dollar and he didn\u2019t deserve any salary increase. He never accepted it.\n\n\u2014 By James F. Crow, a colleague of Sewall Wright. Abridged from Genetics 199, May 1988. Courtesy of the Genetics Society of America.\n\nThe Philosophy of Sewall Wright\n\nVery few geneticists have written seriously about philosophy. Wright is an exception. He discovered that his Chicago colleague, Charles Hartshorne, shared a similar view about the philosophy of organism, and they became lifelong friends.\n\nThe philosophy is in the tradition of Leibniz. Wright\u2019s view is that there is no material basis for a mysterious \u201cemergence\u201d of new properties as systems become more complex. This being the case, one is forced to assume that such properties as consciousness must necessarily reside in the most elementary particles. He has developed this view in several papers; a good example is his presidential address to the American Society of Naturalists, published in 1953 under the title \u201cGene and Organism.\u201d\n\nWright\u2019s philosophical view has attracted some attention among philosophers, and he has several times been invited to participate in national and international conferences. It has not received any significant attention from biologists. Wright found it amusing that his views of the biological organism got more notice from philosophers than from his fellow biologists. His teacher, Wilhelmina Key, wrote him after receiving a reprint of his presidential address that at last he had written a paper that she could understand.\n\n\u2014 From \u201cSewall Wright, the Scientist and the Man,\u201d Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, 25, 2 Winter 1982."}, {"url": "https://library.syracuse.edu/digital/guides/s/sewall_js.htm", "page_content": "John Smith Sewall (1830-1911) was an American sailor, minister, and professor who is best known for his book The Ship's Log of the Captain's Clerk: Adventures in the China Seas, which tells of his experiences aboard the U.S.S.

After donating a collection of Renaissance medals to the Museum in 1978, the Saltons followed up on this generosity with several large gifts of ancient coins between 1988 and 1997, numbering nearly seven hundred in all. The Saltons took great care to select coins from their collection for the Museum that filled important gaps and were of particular use in college teaching.\n\nRead more\n\nIndeed, their correspondence with the Museum reveals that they took a special interest in the educational value of their collection, receiving regular updates on the curriculum and even syllabi for specific classes. In 1990, for example, the Museum was gifted a group of 210 bronze coins spanning the first centuries of the Roman Empire. At the time, Mr. Salton wrote that he hoped this grouping would \u201cillustrate the political history and trade patterns of that period and show the complexities of Roman monetary administration throughout the Empire.\u201d Previously, the Saltons had gifted a group of silver coins of the Roman Republic (1989) and bronze and silver coins illustrating imperial portraiture (1988). The final gift from the Saltons came in 1997 and consisted of nearly 250 Roman coins illustrating what Mr. Salton described as \u201cLife in Ancient Rome,\u201d including art and architecture, music, the games, and agriculture."}, {"url": "https://www.bowdoin.edu/news/2021/05/bowdoin-to-award-to-award-467-degrees-at-216th-commencement-may-29.html", "page_content": "For those unable to attend Commencement in person, there is a new and engaging virtual experience, where you can watch the Commencement exercises, chat with others watching, customize a selfie with Bowdoin backgrounds, and take a Bowdoin quiz.

As early as 1376 the coat-of-arms of John Sewall was affixed to a deed: Fretty, in chief a sea-whale. The other coat-of-arms, used by most of the Sewalls, was borne by John de Sewelle, who accompanied Edward the Black Prince into Aquitaine; Sable, a chevron between three butterflies argent. In the arms used by the Sewalls of New England we find \"gadbees,\" instead of butterflies, and there is some mystery about the bees in this coat-of-arms; according to Colonel Chester, who investigated the subject, the coat-of-arms should be that containing the butterflies, if it can be proved that the Sewalls belong to the heraldic family.\n\nNo family has been more prominent in New England history than the Sewalls. Whether the emigrant ancestor, Henry Sewall, who came to Newbury, Mass. in 1635, was of gentle blood and entitled by descent to the arms - Sable, a chevron or between three bees argent, which his descendants used in colonial days, and which, with bees replaced by butterflies, adorned the shield of John de Sewalle, who attended Edward, the Black Prince, into Aquitaine in 1356 - is a question discussed at some length in E. E. Salisbury's Family Memorials. Whatever way it may be decided, it is certain that his descendants soon won prominence in the new world. Three became chief justices of Massachusetts, another of the Province of Quebec, and two others were judges of the highest court in the commonwealth. In each generation Sewalls have been among the foremost both in the learned professions and in political and business life. Furthermore, by marriage they have been connected with many of the leading families of the country. By female lines of descent, they can claim as kinsmen a host of distinguished Americans, from the poet Longfellow to President Cleveland. The most interesting, if not the most famous of the worthies who bore this surname before the revolution, was Chief Justice Samuel Sewall, of witchcraft times, the \"good and wise\" of Whittier's lines, who had the courage to rebuke the faults of others and the still greater courage to confess his own. Here is the poet's portrait:\n\n\"His face with lines of firmness wrought,\n\nHe wears the look of a man unbought,\n\nWho swears to his hurt and changes not;\n\nYet, touched and softened neveretheless\n\nWith the grace of Christian gentleness,\n\nThe face that a child would climb to kiss;\n\nTrue and tender and brave and just,\n\nThat man might honor and women trust.\"\n\nHis diary, printed in the Collections of the Mass. Historical Society, is a living picture of early New England ways of thought, sentiment, society and manners. His letter to his son Samuel, dated April 21, 1720, and printed in the first volume of the New England Historical and Genealogical Recorder, is the corner-stone of this family history.\n\n\n\n(I) William Shewall, or Sewall, the English progenitor to whom the American lineage is traced, lived in Coventry, Warwickshire. He married, about 1540, Matilda Horne.\n\nChildren:\n\n1. William, mayor of Coventry in 1617, who married Anna Wagstaffe and left no male heirs.\n\n2. Henry, mentioned below.\n\n\n\n(II) Henry (1), son of William Sewall, was born in Coventry about 1544. He was a linen-draper by occupation, a \"prudent man who acquired a large estate.\" He served as alderman of his city and was chosen its mayor in 1589 and 1606. He made his will Sept. 1, 1624, describing himself as of Mt. Michael's parish in the city of Coventry, alderman. He bequeaths to his wife Margaret all his lands and tenements in the city and county; after her death certain of said lands and tenements to Henry, his eldest son: \"and I doe bequeath and devise unto my sonne Henry upon trust and confidence and as he will answeare it before the Lord at the Day of Judgment that he do with all humilitie, acknoeladge his former offences against his mother, before my overseers, in her content, and afterwards to continue obedient;\" he gives certain other lands to Richard, the younger son, to his daughters Anne, wife of Anthony Power, and to youngest daughter, Margaret, wife of Abraham Randall; he also makes various charitable bequests to Coventry, and appoints his wife executrix. This will was proved April 8, 1628, and the testator was buried in the Drapers' Chapel of St. Michael's Church, famous for its spire and its architecture.\n\nHenry Sewall married Margaret, daughter of Alverey (or Avery) Gresbrooks, Gent. of Middleton, in the county of Warwick, and of his wife, Margaret Keene, of Sutton Coldfield. The latter was the great-niece of John Harmon, one of the earliest bishops of Exeter. Margaret Sewall made her will May 7, 1628, bequeathing lands, apparently held in her own right, in Wytherly, county Leicester, and at Ansley, county Warwick. She mentions all the children, but cuts off the eldest son with twelve pence in money, saying: \"And I do forgive unto Henry Sewall, my eldest son, his offences wherein and whereby he hath sundry times offended me, beseeching Almighty God to give him a heart to deal conscionably with his brother and sisters, as he would be done unto.\" This seems to imply that he made the apology prescribed by his father and received the latter's bequest. Letters of administration were granted on her estate Nov. 23, 1629, and she was buried beside her husband in St. Michael's.\n\nChildren:\n\n1. Henry, baptized April 8, 1576.\n\n2. Richard, married Mary Dugdale, sister of Sir William Dugdale, the historian, of Warwickshire.\n\n3. Anne, married Anthony Power.\n\n4. Margaret, married Abraham Randall.\n\n\n\n(III) Henry (2), son of Henry (1) and Margaret Sewall, was baptized April 8, 1576. He married Anne Hunt and lived in Coventry, England. Of him his grandson, Chief Justice Sewall writes: \"Out of dislike to the English hierarchy, he sent over his only son to New England in the year 1634 with net cattel and provisions suitable for a new plantation. Mr. Cotton (Rev. John Cotton) would have had my father settle at Boston, but in regard of his cattel he chose to go to Newbury, whether my grandfather soon followed him.\"\n\nAfter living ten years in Newbury, he removed to Rowley, where he died in March, 1657. During the latter part of his life he is said to have been slightly deranged. \"This was probably the cause of his being two or three times presented by the grand jury for various offences,\" and doubtless explains his earlier difficulties with his mother.\n\n\n\n(IV) Henry (3), only son of Henry (2) and Anne Sewall, was born in 1614. At the age of twenty he was sent to New England in the ship \"Elizabeth and Dorcas,\" with an outfit of servants and cattle. He spent the winter in Ipswich and in the spring of 1635 removed to Newbury. He was admitted a freeman May 17, 1637, and became a prominent citizen of Newbury.\n\nHe married Jane, daughter of Stephen Dummer, March 25, 1646, and received from his father five hundred acres of land in Coventry as a weddding gift. He and his wife returned to England with her parents in 1646-47, the climate not being agreeable to Stephen Dummer and his wife. The Sewalls dwelt a while at Warwick, and afterwards removed to Hampshire, and lived at Tamworth, Bishop Stoke and Badesly.\n\nHenry visited his father in New England once, and then returned to his family in old England. He made a third voyage to New England after the death of his father, to settle the estate, intending to return, bearing with him a letter from Richard Cromwell, the lord protector, to the governor and magistrates of Massachusetts. In this paper Henry Sewall is described as the only son, and \"minister of North Baddesly, County of Southampton, England, and he being personally knowne to us to be larobious and industrious in the work of the ministry, and very exemplary for his holy life and good conversation, we do earnestly desire that when he shall make his addresses to yuo he may receive all lawful favours and furtherance from you.\" (Cromwell's letter, dated March, 1658). Notwithstanding the expectation to return, he lived the remainder of his days in New England, sending for his wife and children to join him in Newbury. Evidently the return of the Stuarts to power caused him to prefer the colony to the old country. Judge Sewall says: \"I was born at Bishop Stoke, March 28, 1652 * * * baptized by Mr. Rashly in Stoke Church, May 4, 1652. Mr. Rashley first preached a sermon and then baptized me. After which an entertainment was made for him and many more. Some months after my father removed to Badesly, where my brother, John Sewall, was born Oct. 10, 1654. My father sent for my mother to come to him to New England. I remember being at Bishop Stoke and Badesly April 23, 1661, the day of the Coronation of K. Charles the 2d, the thunder and Lightening of it. Quckly after that, my mother went to live in Winchester with 5 small children - Hannah, Samuel, John, Stephen and Jane - and John Nash and Mary Hobbs, her Servants, there to be in readiness for the Pool Waggons. At this place her near relations, especially my very worthy and pious Uncle, Mr. Stephen Dummer, took leave with tears. Capt. Dummer of Swathling treated us with Raisons and Almonds. My mother lodged in Pumpyard, London, waiting for the going of the ship the Prudent Mary, Capt. Isaac Woodfreem, Commander.\"\n\nHenry Sewall was deputy to the general court in 1661-64-68-70. He died May 16, 1700, aged eighty-six years. His widow died Jan. 13, following, aged seventy-four years.\n\nChildren:\n\n1. Hannah, born at Tamworth, in Warwickshire, May 10, 1649, married Aug. 24, 1670, Jacob Toppan, of Newbury.\n\n2. Samuel, chief justice of Mass., born March 22, 1652, at Bishop Stoke.\n\n3. John, born Oct. 10, 1654, mentioned below.\n\n4. Major Stephen, of Salem, Mass., born Aug. 19, 1657.\n\n5. Jane, born Oct. 29, 1659, at Badesly, married Moses Gerrish.\n\n6. Anne, born Sept. 3, 1662, at Newbury, married William Longfellow.\n\n7. Mehitable, born May 8, 1665, married William Moody.\n\n8. Dorothy, born Oct. 29, 1668, married Ezekiel Northend and (second) Moses Bradstreet.\n\nThrough this marriage of Henry Sewall to Jane, daughter of Stephen and Alice (Archer) DUMMER, his descendants are allied to Governor William Dummer, of Mass., the founder of Dummer Academy and benefactor of Harvard College, and of his brother, Jeremiah Dummer, the distinguished scholar and political writer of the provincial period. They were grandchildren of her father's brother Richard. The English ancestor of his wife can be traced in an almost unbroken line to Henry de Domers, who was living in 1107. His son, Ralph de Dummers, married Agnes de la Penne, heiress of Penne, in the county of Somerset, afterwards known as Penne-Dummer, and still existing as Pendomer. Their great-grandson, Sir John de Dummer, living in 1268-1320, has an effigy still to be seen in Pendomer church, a magnificent example of its kind, cross-legged, and in a complete suit of ring-mail. The family estate of Dummer in Hampshire, on the death of Thomas de Dummer, passed through his only daughter, Ellen, who married Sir Nicholas Atte More, to their son Thomas, who assumed the name Dummer, and whose descendants in the direct male line ended in 1592 with a William Dummer, whose arms and memorial inscriptions are still to be seen of brass tablets in the Dummer church. Some heiress in collateral lines had meanwhile married a Pyldren, or Pyldryn, and Stephen Dummer, the father-in-law of Henry Sewall, was the great-grandson of Matilda, wife of Richard Pyldernson-Dummer, of Owslebury and Overton, in Hampshire, through her son John and grandson Thomas, the latter of Bishop Stoke in that county. The English family continued to be prominent in Hampshire for several generations.\n\n\n\n(V) John, son of Henry (3) Sewall, was born at Badesly, or Baddesley, Hampshire, England, Oct. 10, 1654, and was baptized there by Mr. Cox, Nov. 22 following. He became the ancestor of all the Sewalls of that province of Maine.\n\nHe married Oct. 27, 1674, Hannah Fessenden, of Cambridge. He lived with his father at Newbury, and died beforfe his father, Aug. 8, 1699.\n\nChildren:\n\n1. John, died without children.\n\n2. Henry.\n\n3. Hannah, married Rev. Samuel Moody, of York, Maine.\n\n4. Samuel, mentioned below.\n\n5. Nicholas, of York, married Mehitable Storer.\n\n6. Thomas, died unmarried.\n\n7. Stephen.\n\n\n\n(VI) Samuel, son of John Sewall, was born about 1688 at Newbury. He settled about 1708 in York, Maine, where his sister was then living. He became an elder of the church and held various positions of trust. He died April 25, 1769. We quote from his epitaph: \"For penetration, sound judgment, remarkable, given to hospitality. The widow and fatherless he relieved and protected. Various offices, civil, military and ecclesiastical ahe with honor and reputation sustained. Pious, exemplay and devot, on the 25th day of April, A.D. 1769, aged 81 years, he died.\"\n\nHe married (first) Lydia Storer; (second) Sarah (Bachelder) Titcomb.\n\nChildren of 1st wife:\n\n1. John, died young.\n\n2. Dummer, died young. [trans note: can you imagine giving a child this as a first name?!}\n\n3. Lydia.\n\n4. Mercy.\n\n5. Mary.\n\n6. Hannah.\n\nChildren of 2d wife:\n\n7.

Moses, of York, Maine, died aged about eighty-three years.\n\n13. Judge David, married Mary Paker, and (second) Elizabeth Langdon.\n\n14. Colonel Dummer, of Bath, Maine, mentioned below.\n\n15. Henry, of Bath, married Mary Stinson and (second) Sarah Henry.\n\n\n\n(VII) Dummer, son of Samuel and Sarah (Bachelder-Titcomb) Sewall, was born at York, Maine, in 1737. At the age of nineteen he enlisted in the provincial army, and served at the reduction of Louisburg, where he was appointed an ensign. On his return he was appointed lieutenant, and ordered to Canada, where he served in the army of General Wolfe, and under General Amherst, until the conquest of the French possessions in North America, participating in the battle that ended in the taking of Quebec in 1759.\n\nIn 1760 he married in York, Maine, Mary, daughter of William Dunning - said to be \"the handsomest girl in Old York\" - and removed with her to that part of Georgetown afterward incorporated into the town of Bath, and here he resided until his death. When the young couple came to Bath, Colonel Sewall built a log house on the eastern side of what was afterward High street, opposite to the spot where he built later the larger and more commodious huose which still stands.\n\nAs soon as hostilities were threatened with Great Britain, he was selected by the people of the district as one of the committee of safety, and associated with Brigadier-General Samuel Thompson, of Topsham, in the performance of the duties of that appointment. He was also a delegate to the provincial congress which assembeld at Watertown, and by the council then administering the affairs of the state he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the regiment commanded by Colonel Samuel McCobb. With this regiment he marched to Cambridge and joined the continental army under George Washington. Colonel Sewall soon after was appointed muster-master of the district of Maine - the duties of which he performed during the remainder of the war.\n\nHe was a magistrate of the county of Lincoln, appointed by the first government established by the commonwealth, and continued as such by successive appointments until his death. He was also for many years a special justice of the court of common pleas for the county. Soon after the adoption of the constitution of Mass., Colonel Sewall was elected a senator from Lincoln county. He was a member of the convention of 1788, called by that state to ratify the constitution of the U. S., and was one of the committee of compromise appointed at the suggestion of General Hancock toward the close of the session, to consider and report such amendment as would make the proposed form of government more acceptable, and without which the constitution would not probably have been ratified by the convention.\n\nHe was the first postmaster of Bath, serving from the establishment of a regular mail until 1806. Interested in education, he was one of the first overseers of Bowdoin College, and served as treasurer and trustee from 1799 to his resignation in 1806. A deeply and sincerely religious man, he was a founder and one of the deacons of the \"Old North Church,\" now represented by the Winter Street Congregational Church. Over three hundred of his family letters, written during the last thirty-five years of his life, have been preserved, and give a vivid picture of his own spiritual nature and his keen interest in religious matters. Noted for his amiable temper, his generous heart, his decision of character, his sound judgment in all practical matters, this good man died April 6, 1832, at the advanced age of ninety-four.\n\nChildren:\n\nDummer, Mary, Sarah, Lydia, Hannah (died young), Joseph, Samuel, Hannah, Deborah and John.\n\n\n\n(VIII) Joseph, son of Colonel Dummer Sewall, was born Dec. 17, 1770, at Bath. He was a carpenter and builder in his early life and afterwards engaged as an owner and builder in navigation. At Hunnewell's Point, Popham, where he lived for several years, he occupied what was known as the \"White House,\" a conspicuous building always kept painted in the color indicated. He was a man of magisterial prominence, presiding at town meetings, and a ready speaker.\n\nIn 1816 he removed to Farmington, Maine, where he spent the remainder of his life in farming, and where he died.\n\nHe married (first) Lydia Marsh, of Bath.\n\nChildren:\n\n1. General Joseph, adjutant-general of Maine.\n\n2. William Dunning, mentioned below.\n\n3. Lydia, who married Dr. Ebenezer Wells, of Freeport.\n\nSecond marriage to Hannah Shaw, of Hunnewell's Point.\n\nChildren:\n\n4. Hon. George Popham, who settled in Old Town, and was speaker of the Maine house of representatives 5. Mary, who married John Randolph Cony.\n\n6. Ellen, who married David Worcester, of Bangor.\n\n7. Mercy H., who married Governor Samuel Cony, of Augusta.\n\nHis third wife was Katherine Shaw, sistr of his second.\n\nChildren:\n\n8. Katherine, who died in childhood.\n\n9. Bradford, of Farmington.\n\n10. Arthur, of Dysart, Iowa.\n\n\n\n(IX) William Dunning, son of Joseph and Lydia (Marsh) Sewall, was born Nov. 27, 1795, at Bath. He became one of the earliest and most prominent of the ship-builders of Bath. He was also interested in the railroads of the state, and served as director of the Portland and Kennebec railroad. He repersented his district in the state senate and was influential in political affairs.\n\nHe married Rachel, daughter of William and granddaughter of Hon. David Trufant, of Bath.\n\nChildren:\n\n1. Harriet Hyde, who married Abram S. Cutler, of Brookline, Mass.\n\n2. Marcia Elizabeth, who married Joseph Ropes, of Salem, Mass.\n\n3. William Dunning, who was killed by an accidental fall in his father's shipyard, and whose only child died in infancy.\n\n4. Edward, the well-known ship-builder of Bath.\n\n5. Arthur, mentioned below.\n\n6. Rev. Frank Sewall, D.D., of Washington, D. C., and York, Maine.\n\n7. Alice Worcester, of Bath.\n\n\n\n(X) Arthur, son of William D. and Rachel (Trufant) Sewall, was born Nov. 25, 1835, at Bath. He received his education in the public schools of his native city. While still in his teens he was engaged in the pursuit of ship timber at Prince Edward Island, and in 1854 formed a partnership with his older brother, Edward, under the firm name of E. & A. Sewall. The next year the two brother launched their first ship, the \"Holyhead,\" of ovr one thousand tons, a large vessel for those days. Every year afterwards, on an average, a ship generally of large tonnage for the era was built by this firm. On the death of the senior partner in 1879, the firm name was changed to Arthur Sewall & Company, his nephew Samuel S. Sewall, and his son, William D. Sewall, becoming partners. Its activity was not diminished with the change of name.\n\nIn 1890 President Benjamin Harrison walked along the keel of the \"Rappahannock,\" of over three thousand sons burden, at her launching, the largest wooden ship afloat, and was remineded by his host that, in the presidency of the elder Harrison, his father had built another \"Rappahannock,\" which was also the largest ship of her day, though only a little over one thousand tons burden. The record of the largest wooden ship remained with these builders for several years later.\n\nIn 1893 Mr. Sewall went to England and Scotland, visited all the noted shipyards, studied the different lines of progress in marine construction, and returned to Bath to equip his yard for the complete construction of steel sailing vessels. The first steel ship built there bore the appropriate name of \"Dirigo.\" It was in his career as a builder of ships that Mr. Sewall took the greatest pride. To him the product of his shipyards was a matter of greatest interest and satisfaction. He watched every part of a vessel's construction, and there was no part of the work he was not capable of manually performing. His relations with his employees was always most cordial, most of them being fellow townsmen, and all possessed with the esprit de corps ever resulting from talented leadership. He took an equal pride in his work after a ship sailed out of the still waters of the Kennebec and began to make a record for herself upon the high seas. Almost all of the Sewall vessels were officered from the banks of the Kennebec, with a preference given to the boys of Bath. For many years there was no more promising field for a young man to adopt. The best blood of Maine has proudly walked the quarter-deck of Bath-built vessels, and it is hardly an exaggeration to say that at least every family on the river has contributed one son to the service of the merchant marine. The Sewall wooden ships have always borne a fine reputation, although, as being wooden ships, English discrimination in Lloyds operated somewhat to their detriment. They have not always been profitable investments, but Mr. Sewall continued steadily to add to his fleet long after others became discouraged by the poor returns. He never lost faith that ultimately the U. S. would regain its power and pre-eminence on the seas, and always favored the enactment of measures designed to enable it to do so, not regarding American ships in the light of an ordinary private industry seeking protection, but as a national industry, which national pride and patriotism should put into a position of profitably carrying the Stars and Stripes into all ports of the world. He was an intense American. In the times of war nothing would induce him to disguise or prepare his ships against possible capture, and the Stars and Stripes and the flag of the Sewalls continued to fly from his vessels during the entire Civil War. One of his best, the \"Vigilant,\" was captured by the Confederate gunboat \"Sumter,\" when she was but fairly out upon the high seas.\n\nMr. Sewall would have gladly devoted all his time to the building of ships, but his ability as a man of affairs caused him to be drafted into other lines of business activity. He was for nine years president of the Maine Central railroad, and a director and president of the Eastern railroad before it was merged in the Boston and Maine. He also served many years as president of the Bath National Bank. His executive capacity and his business judgment, rather than his wealth, caused him to be sought for many corporate positions. He always took a lively interest in the political affairs of his country. He was a Democrat from conviction, and in this conviction he never wavered. This, of course, closed to him all avenues of political advancement in Maine. The highest and only elective offices he held were those of councilman and alderman of his native city. Within his party, he occupied a position of enviable influence. He was a delegate to the national conventions of 1872, 1880 and 1884. In 1888 and 1892 he was chosen a member of the national Democratic committee, and served on the executive committee during each campaign. His democracy was virile and robust, but at times it seemed almsot overshadowed by his intense Americanism. With regard to the tariff, he would have used it so far as it is necessary to raise revenue, as a weapon against other nations - a weapon of defense to our industries, and of action to force from other nations a return for every concession we make to them. To this extent, he sympathized with the reciprocity measure of Secretary Blaine, and was a believer in discriminating duties in favor of American tonnage as advocated by Jefferson. He was an advocate of a vigorous foreign policy. He would deal with Canada so as to force her to realize her disadvantage as a British dependency. He favored the annexation of Hawaii, the maintenance of our influnec in Samoa, the independence of Cuba. He was an ardent and outspoken champion of bimetalism. This firm and early avowal of what was among Mr. Sewall's associates a very unpopular doctrine brought him into national prominence, and in 1896, to the surprise of the country and himself, he was nominated by the Democratic party as a candidate for vice-president. On accepting the nomination for the vice-presidency of the U. S. at Madison Square Garden, New York City, in August, 1906, he said:\n\n\"The Democracy of the country realize that all the great principles of our party are as potent and essential to the well-being of the country today as they have always been, and as they ever would be, but the overshadowing issues before the country now, made dominant by the distressed condition prevailing througout our land, is the demand for reform in our existing monetary system. Our party and, we belive, a great majority of the American people are convinced that the legislation of '73 demonetizing silver was a wrong inflicted upon our country which should and must be righted. We believe that the single gold standard has so narrowed the base of our monetary structure that it is unstable and unsafe, and so dwarfed it, in its development and in its power to furnish the necessary financial blood to the nation, that commercial and industrial paralysis has followed. We believe that we ned, and must have, the broad gold and silver foundation to support a monetary system strong and stable, capable of meeting the demand of a growing country and an industrious, energetic and enterprising people, a system that will not be weakened and panic-stricken by every foreign draft upon us, a system that will maintain a parity of just values and the nation's money and protect us from the frequent fluctuations of today, so disastrous to every business and industry in the land. We demand the free coinage of silver, the opening of our mints to both money metals without discrimination, the return of the money of our fathers, the money of the Constitution, gold and silver. We believe this is the remedy and the only remedy for the evil from which we are now suffering; the evil that is now so fast devastating and improverishing our land and people, bring poverty to our homes and bankruptcy to our business, which, if allowed to continue, will grow until our very institutions are threatened. The demonetization of silver has thrown the whole primary money function on gold, appreciating its value and purchasing power. Restore the money function to silver, and silver will appreciate and its purchasing power increase. Take from gold its monopoly, its value will be reduced, and in due course the parity of the two metals will again obtain under natural causes. We shall then have a broad and unlimited foundation for a monetary sytem, commensurate with our country's needs and future development, not the unsafe basis of today reduced by half by the removal of silver and continually undermined by foreigners carrying from us our gold.\"\n\nAfter his defeat for the vice-presidency, Mr. Sewall continued actively in his business and traveled extensively. In 1896-97 he went over the route of the Panama canal, and then, although it was generally conceded that the proper route for an interoceanic canal was by the way of Nicaragua, with his characteristic firmness he maintained that it whould be by way of Panama - a positon which has since been vindicated.\n\nHe died Sept. 5, 1900, at Small Point, his summer home. Mr. Sewall was sincerely a religious man and a prominent member of the New Church (Swedenborgian) over which the Rev. Samuel F. Dike, D.D., was for half a century the pastor. To this venerable man, by whom he was both baptized and married, he bore a deep affection, and one of the many generous deeds unostentatiously done by him was the provision for a year of foreign travel for this scholarly clergyman after the close of his pastorate.\n\nMr. Sewall married Emma Duncan, daughter of Charles and Rachel (Sewall) Crooker, of Bath, who survives her husband. A woman of quiet and refined tastes, an artist with pen and camera, so well read in history and literature that travel has meant more to her than to most, she has for years made her home a true center of culture and society. She is also a descendant of (V) John Sewall, though his son Samuel, his grandson Henry, his great-grandson James, his great-great-granddaughter, Rachel.\n\nChildren:\n\nHarold Marsh, mentioned below.\n\nWilliam Dunning, mentioned below.\n\nDummer, who died in infancy.\n\n\n\n(XI) Harold Marsh, son of Arthur and Emma D. (Crooker) Sewall, was born Jan. 3, 1860, at Bath. He graduated at Harvard, receiving the degree of A.B. in 1882 and LL.B. in 1885. He entered the consular service as a Democrat, being appointed vice-counsul to Liverpool and consul-general at Samoa in 1887 by President Cleveland. Finding himself unable to agree with the latter's policy in the Pacific, he resigned his post and returned to this country. Under President Harrison he was attached to the commission which negotiated the Berlin treaty of 1889, for the joint-government of Samoa by the powers. He was reappointed counsul-general at Samoa in 1889, and secured the site for the naval station at Pago-Pago.\n\nHe was admited to the Maine bar in 1892. He presided over the Republican state convention and was a delegate to the National Republican convention of 1896. The same year he was chosen a member of the Maine legislature. In 1897 he was appointed U. S. minister to Hawaii, and the following year personally received the transfer of the sovereignty of the islands. He remained at Hawaii as a special agent of the U. S. until the organiztion of the territory was completed, and served as its first member of the National Republican committee. Again taking up his residence in his native city, he was chosen a member of the Maine house of representatives for the years 1903-06, and of the Maine senate for 1907-08. His personal qualifications for the office made him a prominent candidate for nomination by the Republicans as a representative to congress from the second Maine district in 1908, and the selection of another candidate was due largely to considerations of place of residence and previous candidature.\n\nMr. Sewall married, in San Francisco, Sept., 1893, Camilla Loyall, daughter of Richard Porter and Caroline (Loyall) Ashe.\n\nChildren:\n\nLoyall Farragut, Arthur, Emma Kaiulani and Camilla Loyall Ashe.\n\n\n\n(XI) William Dunning, son of Arthur and Emma D.
