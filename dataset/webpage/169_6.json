{"Ayn Rand turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays.": [{"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ayn-rand/", "page_content": "First published Tue Jun 8, 2010; substantive revision Mon Jul 13, 2020\n\nAyn Rand (1905\u20131982) was a novelist-philosopher who outlined a comprehensive philosophy, including an epistemology and a theory of art, in her novels and essays. Early in her career she also wrote short stories, plays, and screenplays. Rand\u2019s first and most autobiographical novel, We the Living (1936), set in the Soviet Union, was published only after many rejections, owing to widespread sympathy for the Soviet \u201cexperiment\u201d among the intellectuals of the day. We the Living was quickly followed by the dystopian novel, Anthem (1938), written as \u201ca kind of rest\u201d from work on her next major novel, The Fountainhead (1943). The Fountainhead, also published after many rejections because of its individualism, and largely panned by critics, soon became a best-seller by word of mouth. The Fountainhead brought Rand international fame, and Atlas Shrugged (1957) sealed this fame. By 1958, Rand\u2019s novels, increasingly philosophical, had won her ideas a sufficiently devoted following for her to form, in association with psychologist Nathaniel Branden (with whom she later broke), an official \u201cObjectivist\u201d philosophical movement, complete with journals and lecture courses. For all her popularity, however, only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously. As a result, most of the serious philosophical work on Rand has appeared in non-academic, non-peer-reviewed journals, or in books, and the bibliography reflects this fact. We discuss the main reasons for her rejection by most professional philosophers in the first section. Our discussion of Rand\u2019s philosophical views, especially her moral-political views, draws from both her non-fiction and her fiction, since her views cannot be accurately interpreted or evaluated without doing so.\n\n1. Introduction\n\n1.1 Ayn Rand and Philosophy\n\nIn Rand\u2019s own words, her first and greatest love, her \u201clife purpose\u201d, was \u201cthe creation of the kind of world \u2026 that represents human perfection\u201d, while her interest in philosophical knowledge was \u201conly\u201d for the sake of this purpose (Journal entry for 4 May 1946; in 1997: 479).[1] Nevertheless, her interest in philosophical knowledge continued long after she had created this world in her magnum opus, Atlas Shrugged, her last work of fiction. In her non-fiction, Rand developed a conception of metaphysical realism, rationality, ethical egoism (rational self-interest), individual rights, laissez-faire capitalism, and art, and applied her philosophy to social issues. She wrote polemical, philosophical essays, often in response to questions by fans of Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead; lectured on college campuses; and gave radio and television interviews. In her own words, her philosophy,\n\nin essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute. (Rand 1957 [1992]: Afterword)\n\nCapitalism, \u201cthe unknown ideal\u201d, is for her the only political-economic system compatible with this philosophy because it is the only system based on respect for human beings as ends in themselves. The free-market libertarian political movement, though largely disowned by Rand, drew\u2014and draws\u2014great inspiration from her moral defense of the minimal state, that is, the state whose only raison d\u2019\u00eatre is protection of individual rights.\n\nWhereas Rand\u2019s ideas and mode of presentation make Rand popular with many non-academics, they lead to the opposite outcome with academics. She developed some of her views in response to questions from her readers, but seldom took the time to defend them against possible objections or to reconcile them with the views expressed in her novels. Her philosophical essays lack the self-critical, detailed style of analytic philosophy, or any serious attempt to consider possible objections to her views. Her polemical style, often contemptuous tone, and the dogmatism and cult-like behavior of many of her fans also suggest that her work is not worth taking seriously.[2] Further, understanding her views requires reading her fiction, but her fiction is not to everyone\u2019s taste. It does not help that she often dismisses other philosophers\u2019 views on the basis of cursory readings and conversations with a few philosophers and with her young philosophy student acolytes. Some contemporary philosophers return the compliment by dismissing her work contemptuously on the basis of hearsay. Some who do read her work point out that her arguments too often do not support her conclusions. This estimate is shared even by many who find her conclusions and her criticisms of contemporary culture, morality, and politics original and insightful. It is not surprising, then, that she is either mentioned in passing, or not mentioned at all, in the entries that discuss current philosophical thought about virtue ethics, egoism, rights, libertarianism, or markets. (Readers may also find the entry on Nozick\u2019s political philosophy to be of interest.) We present specific criticisms of her arguments and claims below, in the relevant sections of this entry.\n\n1.2 Life and Work\n\nAyn Rand was born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum, to a bourgeois Jewish family in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 2 February 1905. A witness to the Russian Revolution and civil war, Rand opposed both the Communists and the Tsarists. She majored in history, but the social science program in which she was enrolled at Petrograd State University included philosophy, law, and philology. Her teachers emphasized\u2014as she herself later did\u2014the importance of developing systematic connections among different areas of thought (Sciabarra 2013). Rand\u2019s formal philosophical education included ancient philosophy (especially Plato and Aristotle), logic, philosophical psychology, Marxism-Leninism, and non-Marxist political thought. But she was evidently also exposed to Hegelian and Nietzschean ideas, which blossomed during this period (known as the Russian Silver Age), and read a great deal of Friedrich Nietzsche on her own. After graduating from Petrograd State University in 1924, an interest in screenwriting led her to enroll in the State Institute for Cinematography. On the literary side, she studied the great Russian novelists and poets, but fell in love with Victor Hugo, to whose influence she owes the \u201cRomantic Realism\u201d of her novels.\n\nIn 1925 Rand succeeded in obtaining permission to visit relatives in the United States; hating the Soviet system, she left with no intention of returning. After six months with relatives in Chicago, she made her way to Hollywood where, on her second day, a fortuitous encounter with Cecil B. DeMille led to a job as a script reader, and later as a screenplay writer. The next week she had another fortuitous encounter, this time with the actor Frank O\u2019Connor, whom she married in 1929. She was married to him till his death in 1979. She adopted the pen name Ayn Rand to (it is thought) protect her family back in Russia, although she also told the New York Evening Post in 1936 that \u201cRand\u201d was an abbreviation of her Russian surname.\n\nRand and her husband moved permanently to New York City in 1951, where she became involved with, and was influenced by, the circle of mostly New-York-based intellectuals involved in the revival of classical liberalism, such as the economic journalist Henry Hazlitt, the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, and the Canadian-American novelist, literary critic, and political philosopher Isabel Paterson. Rand also studied, and was a great admirer of, the Lockean philosophy of the American founding. Rand lived and worked in New York City until her death in 1982.\n\nRand holds that philosophy, like all forms of knowledge and achievement, is important only because it is necessary for living a good human life and creating a world conducive to living such a life. Philosophy supplies the most fundamental cognitive and normative abstractions which, respectively, identify and evaluate what is. Everyone, according to Rand, needs a philosophy and is guided by at least an implicit one (1982a: ch. 1). Her novels express her belief that if our philosophy is more or less correct, our lives will be more or less successful, if our philosophy is wildly off the mark, our lives will be disastrous. Philosophy thus has an urgent, practical importance. But unlike Marx, her philosophical and political antipode, Rand thinks that social change has to start with a moral revolution within each individual and the spread of the right ideas and ideals through rational discourse and the inspiration of art.\n\nRand\u2019s ideal human being appears, in varying degrees of development, in all her novels; her ideal world appears in Atlas Shrugged. Her novels feature striking, complex plots with subtle psychological explorations of her characters\u2019 emotions and thoughts, and philosophical reflections that rarely lose sight of the dramatic context. Like many famous Russian novelists, especially Dostoevsky, whom she recognized as a great psychologist, Rand also uses long speeches to lay out her philosophy, a device that has both its supporters and its detractors. She described Atlas Shrugged as a \u201cstunt novel\u201d and a murder mystery\u2014the murder of the human soul by a collectivist culture. By \u201csoul\u201d, however, she meant not an immortal substance that survives the death of the body\u2014she is not a dualist in any aspect of her philosophy\u2014but the mind, or the human spirit that celebrates life on this earth. She took a familiar phenomenon and literary trope\u2014a workers\u2019 strike\u2014and turned it on its head to show what happens when \u201cthe men of mind\u201d\u2014scientists, philosophers, industrialists, entrepreneurs, writers\u2014the \u201cprime movers\u201d of a society\u2014go on strike. It also purports to show how the wrong metaphysics can lead to the wrong ethics and thus to disastrous personal choices and a disastrous political and economic system, and how the right philosophy is needed for the rebirth of the soul and the rebuilding of the world. Her protagonists are not knights on white steeds rescuing damsels in distress, or swordsmen who can fight off a dozen enemies single-handed, but men and women in the mid-20th century industrial America of steel mills, skyscrapers, and glimmering highways: women who run transcontinental railroads and men who revolutionize architecture or (long before clean energy became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre) build a motor powered by static electricity to produce limitless, clean energy. Her novels show the importance of striving to be the best we can be:\n\nDo not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but never have been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible\u2026. (Atlas Shrugged, 1957 [1992]: 983).\n\nHer novels inspire readers because they present heroes of unbreached integrity, heroes who lead colorful and remarkable lives and succeed not in spite of, but because of, their uncompromising virtue. This estimate of their virtue is not, of course, shared by all: many readers find her characters wooden, her writing stilted, and her ethical and political views misguided.\n\nRand paid tribute to Aristotle, whom she considered the greatest of all philosophers, in the titles she gave to the three Parts of Atlas Shrugged (Non-Contradiction, Either-Or, A is A) and to one of the chapters (The Immovable Movers). While she differed sharply from Nietzsche on many issues, including rationality, free will, and individual rights, his influence is evident in her provocative, often aphoristic, point-counterpoint writing style, as well as in her \u201ctransvaluation\u201d of traditional values and her powerful affirmation of life and joy and the spirit of youth. In the Introduction to the 25th Anniversary edition of The Fountainhead, she stated that the novel\u2019s sense of life is best conveyed by a quotation from Nietzsche\u2019s Beyond Good and Evil: \u201cThe noble soul has reverence for itself\u201d. (For The Fountainhead\u2019s partly sympathetic and partly critical engagement with Nietzsche\u2019s ideas, see Hunt 2006.)\n\n1.3 Metaphysics and Epistemology\n\nFundamental to Rand\u2019s outlook\u2014so fundamental that she derives the name of her philosophical system, \u201cObjectivism\u201d, from it\u2014is a trichotomy among three categories: the intrinsic, the subjective, and the objective (ITOE: 52\u201354; Rand 1965: 13\u201323). An intrinsic phenomenon is one whose nature depends wholly on factors external to the mind; a subjective phenomenon is one whose nature depends wholly on the mind; and an objective phenomenon is defined, variously, as that which depends on the relation between a living entity\u2019s nature (including the nature of its mind) and its environment, or as that which depends on the relation between a properly functioning (rational) mind and extramental reality. Commentators are divided over the best way to interpret Rand\u2019s views on this issue.\n\nRand holds that there is a widespread tendency to ignore the third category or to assimilate it to the second, thus setting up a false dichotomy between the intrinsic and the subjective. On Rand\u2019s view, many of the fundamental questions of philosophy, from the existence of universals to the nature of value, involve fruitless debates over the false alternative \u201cintrinsic or subjective?\u201d in cases where the phenomenon in question is neither intrinsic nor subjective, but rather objective.\n\nIf ethics is the branch of philosophy concerned with practice, then in a sense all of Rand\u2019s philosophy is ethics, for Rand stresses \u201cthe supremacy of actual living over all other considerations\u201d, and insists that philosophy needs to be \u201cbrought up to the realm of actual living\u201d\u2014adding \u201cI say intentionally brought up to it, not down\u201d (Journal entry for 15 May 1934, p. 72; in Rand 1997: 73). Consequently, Rand regularly concerns herself with the practical implications and social relevance not only of moral and political philosophy, but likewise of the seemingly more arcane strata of metaphysics and epistemology\u2014as when she identifies errors in concept-formation as one of the roots of racism, or mind-body dualism as a root of the dichotomy between economic and personal freedom. This approach likewise reflects Rand\u2019s emphasis on integrating each piece of information into the total context of one\u2019s knowledge, and her consequent hostility to compartmentalization.\n\nRand\u2019s conviction of the vital practical importance of abstract theory may help to explain the passionately polemical nature of her philosophical writing (which some readers find inspiring and others hyperbolic and off-putting), although Nietzsche\u2019s influence, as well as the influence of her Marxist-Leninist education also probably play a role. Rand also tended\u2014perhaps owing in part to the same two influences\u2014to regard philosophical errors as revelatory of the psychological flaws of their authors.\n\nFor a more in-depth presentation of Rand\u2019s views on epistemology and metaphysics, please see the supplement on Epistemology and Metaphysics\n\n2. Ethics\n\n2.1 What is Ethics, and Why do we need It?\n\nEthics\n\nis a code of values to guide man\u2019s choices and actions\u2014the choices and actions that determine the purpose and the course of his life. (1961b: 13)\n\nBefore we can decide which code of values we should accept, we need to ask why we need a code of values at all. Rand claims that no philosopher before her has provided a scientific answer to this question, and so none has provided a satisfactory ethics.\n\nRand starts by describing value or \u201cthe good\u201d, in classical fashion, as the object of pursuit: \u201cthat which one acts to gain and/or keep\u201d (1961b: 16). Thus, the concept of value presupposes the concept of \u201can entity capable of acting to achieve a goal in the face of an alternative\u201d\u2014and the basic alternative facing any living entity is life or death (1961b: 16). It is the conditional nature of life that gives rise to values, not just human values, but values as such. As she puts it:\n\nMetaphysically, life is the only phenomenon that is an end in itself: a value gained and kept by a constant process of action. (1961b: 18)\n\nSurvival is the organism\u2019s ultimate value, the \u201cfinal goal or end to which all [its] lesser goals are the means\u201d, and the standard of all its other values: \u201cthat which furthers its life is the good, that which threatens it is the evil\u201d (pp. 16\u201317). The same, suitably modified, applies to human beings. Life is the standard and goal of all genuine human values, in the sense that all of them\u2014from food to philosophy to fine art to ethics\u2014must be explained and justified as requirements of human survival. \u201cEthics is an objective, metaphysical necessity of man\u2019s survival\u201d (p. 24). Thus,\n\n[t]he standard of value of the Objectivist ethics \u2026 is man\u2019s life, or: that which is required for man\u2019s survival qua man, (1961b: 25)\n\nthat is,\n\nthe terms, methods, conditions and goals required for the survival of a rational being through the whole of his lifespan\u2014in all those aspects of existence which are open to his choice. (1961b: 27)\n\nTo choose to live is to accept one\u2019s \u201cown life\u201d as one\u2019s \u201cethical purpose\u201d.\n\nRand\u2019s metaphysical arguments make three points central to her axiology and ethics. (1) All living entities have values, not only human beings, and only living entities have values: life necessitates value, and value depends on life. (2) An entity\u2019s values are determined by its objective life-needs, that is, by the requirements of survival for entities of its kind, and ethics is a requirement of human survival. (3) Thus, values are neither intrinsic properties of things, nor subjective, neither free-floating Platonic entities, nor mere matters of preference, time, or culture. Rather, values are relational or objective, dependent on the nature of the valuing entity and the nature of its environment.\n\nRand supports the first point by arguing that the concept of value entails the concept of life:\n\nepistemologically, the concept of \u201cvalue\u201d is genetically dependent upon and derived from the antecedent concept of \u201clife\u201d. (1961b: 18)\n\nShe asks the reader to\n\nimagine an immortal, indestructible robot, an entity which moves and acts, but which cannot be affected by anything, which cannot be changed in any respect, which cannot be damaged, injured or destroyed. (1961b: 16)\n\nSuch an entity, she concludes, cannot have values.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that all it shows is that an entity that cannot be destroyed or harmed cannot have values, and not that a non-living entity cannot have values. Unlike the robot of this example, real robots can be damaged or destroyed, by external as well as internal events. What it means for them to be damaged or destroyed is that they cannot perform their functions well, or at all. Hence they can, quite straightforwardly, be said to have values.[3] To take this into account, Rand would have to say that for an entity that has a function, values are determined by what it needs to function (well), and that the function of living beings is to survive (well). Hence she can still maintain that for living things, values are determined by its objective life-needs, hence that values are objective, and that ethics is a requirement of a proper human survival.\n\nRand\u2019s naturalism, and her rejection of intrinsicism and subjectivism in favor of objectivism, anticipate recent naturalisms and echo Aristotle\u2019s argument, against both the Platonist and the subjectivist, that \u201cthe good\u201d must always be good-for-something. Her conception of the function of morality is notable both for its affinity to, and its difference from, Thomas Hobbes\u2019 conception: like Hobbes, Rand sees morality as a necessary means to long-term survival, but unlike Hobbes, she does not see morality as requiring a contract or even as a fundamentally social affair. The need for morality, according to Rand, is dictated by our nature as creatures that must think and produce to survive; hence we would need morality even on a desert island. There is, however, no duty to survive; morality is based on a hypothetical imperative: if you choose to live, then you must value your own long-term survival as an ultimate end, and morality as a necessary means to it. If asked why the choice to live commits you to your own long-term survival rather than some other ultimate end (such as, for example, the greatest happiness of the greatest number (Nozick 1971), or becoming worthy of eternal life in heaven), the only answer is: because any other ultimate end, if consistently adhered to, would lead to death.\n\nRand\u2019s ethics is thus firmly teleological, this-worldly, and foundationalist. Virtue is \u201cthe act by which one gains/and or keeps\u201d values in light of a recognition of certain facts (1961b: 27, 28); it \u201cis not an end in itself \u2026 not its own reward\u201d (1957 [1992]: 939). A fact central to a \u201cscientific\u201d ethics is that reason is the chief indispensable human tool of survival, and we exercise reason by choice. Hence rationality is the fundamental moral virtue, a virtue implicated in all the other virtues, including productiveness (Section 2.4 below).\n\nRand is widely credited by Objectivists (Peikoff 1991; Binswanger 1990, 1992; Kelley & Thomas 1999\u2014see Other Internet Resources; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000, 2006) with having solved the is-ought problem by showing that morality is essential for long-term survival as a rational being, and so anyone who chooses to live ought to be moral (1961b: 19). But if the choice to live is itself a moral choice, in the sense that we ought to choose to live, then the argument proceeds from an ought to an ought, not from an is to an ought. On the other hand, if the choice to live is a non-moral choice (an idea that\u2019s hard to reconcile with Rand\u2019s general view that all significant choices are moral choices), then suicide can never be wrong, even if it is done for cowardly, irresponsible, or unjust reasons, a view that is obviously incoherent (King 1984 and Narveson 1998 criticize this and other aspects of Rand\u2019s moral views). Again, if morality is needed only for long-term survival, and choosing death is not immoral, then a suicide-bomber does no wrong in killing innocent people. But people don\u2019t lose their rights just because their killer has decided to kill himself. Darryl Wright seeks to save something of the commonsense view that the suicide-bomber acts wrongly by arguing that his choice to die without good reason \u201ccorresponds to a real defect or corruption\u201d in him (Wright 2011: 26\u201329). But this verdict contradicts the premise that choosing death is not immoral. For if the choice expresses a corruption in the character of the suicide-bomber, then the choice itself is immoral. Moreover, this response leaves untouched the most important criticism of the suicide-bomber\u2019s actions: that he violates other people\u2019s rights by using them as mere means to his own (wicked) ends.\n\nMore fundamentally, the very idea of morality resting on the choice to live is questionable (Long 2000, Badhwar 2001). Most of us rarely, if ever, make a choice to live: we live by default. By giving us desires for food and water, for pleasure and security, Nature gives us, as she gives other animals, the implicit desire to stay alive. Perhaps the most dramatic evidence is the existence of feral children, children who have managed to stay alive for years in the company of wild animals. When we grow up, the only time we seriously ask ourselves if we want to live or die is when living requires an effort on our part, such as in a grave illness, or deep depression, or emergency. But we start learning the difference between right and wrong (for example, don\u2019t hit others, don\u2019t grab their things, and so on) long before we ever consider whether to live or die. A deeper reflection on morality begins when we mature and start asking ourselves what constitutes happiness and a worthwhile life. But this is an inherently moral question to which the answers are inherently moral or immoral.\n\nLet let us now return to the question of how we should understand the relationship between long-term survival and survival as a rational being\u2014the life \u201cproper to a rational being\u201d (Rand 1961b: 27). Is a life proper to a rational being a necessary means, and only a necessary means, to literal, long-term survival? Or is such a life itself the ultimate goal, the kind of survival worth having? Again, what are we to make of the many passages in which Rand states that the ultimate goal is one\u2019s own happiness?\n\nSome of Rand\u2019s statements suggest that she had only one, consistent ethical view: the ultimate goal is the individual\u2019s own survival; the only way to survive long-term, i.e., over a complete life-span, is to live by the standard of man\u2019s life as a rational being, which means: to live morally; and happiness is the psychological \u201cresult, reward and concomitant\u201d (p. 32) of living thus. Many of Rand\u2019s commentators follow her in holding that there is only one consistent view, while disagreeing on the right interpretation of it (Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1978; Machan 1984, 2000; Peikoff 1991; Bidinotto 1994\u2014see Other Internet Resources; Hunt 1999; Kelley & Thomas 1999\u2014see Other Internet Resources; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000, 2006). Others (Mack 1984, 2003; Badhwar 1999, 2001; Long 2000) argue that Rand\u2019s writings actually allow of two, if not three, mutually incompatible views of the ultimate goal, and our task is to see which of these is the dominant or most plausible view. The three views are: survival, survival qua rational being, and happiness in the ancient Aristotelian sense of flourishing or eudaimonia. In the rest of Section 2, we will present the textual evidence for each of these views of the final goal, and the common objections to them, in turn.\n\nAll three views are, of course, egoist, in that the primary or sole intended beneficiary of morality is supposed to be the moral agent herself. But some of the criticisms usually levied at egoism lose some of their force when directed at the second and third views.\n\n2.2 Survival as the Ultimate Value\n\nThe survivalist view holds that just as literal survival is the ultimate value for other living entities, so it is for human beings (Kelley & Thomas 1999; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000). Survival is the source and final goal of all the actions of an entity, that which gives point to all its other values. For human beings, morality and happiness are both instrumental means to survival. The vicious can \u201cachieve their goals [only] for the range of a moment\u201d, as evidenced by \u201cany criminal or any dictatorship\u201d (1961b: 26).\n\n\u201cNon-survivalists\u201d make the following objections:\n\nThe biological premise that survival is the ultimate goal of all living things is mistaken. Animals of many species risk their own lives for the sake of reproduction, or for protecting their young or even their group. But even if survival were the ultimate goal of other species, it need not be ours. Even if our own survival needs were the source of all our values, it would not follow that survival must be the ultimate psychological and moral goal to which all our other values are merely necessary means. The genesis of x does not logically determine the ultimate goal of x. For example, the source of sexual desire is our reproductive capacity but, as Rand would agree, it doesn\u2019t follow that we ought to satisfy our sexual desires only if we want to reproduce. The survivalist view that turns happiness into a mere means to survival entails, quite implausibly, that a long, unhappy life is better than a somewhat shorter but happy life, and just as good as a long and happy one. Many dictators, including the Pharaohs of the past and the Stalins and Maos of the 20th century, have survived by making elaborate plans to preserve their lives and their power by using a combination of terror, myth, and bribery. Their gross injustice poses a far greater threat to the lives of their subordinates than to their own. Morality enhances the individual\u2019s chances of survival under normal circumstances, but it is not necessary for survival. And in some circumstances, such as in a dictatorship, acting morally decreases the individual\u2019s chances of survival, a point that Rand herself convincingly dramatizes in We the Living and Anthem. A survivalist ethics can support, at best, a bare-bones Hobbesian morality, not a virtue ethics. If Rand\u2019s virtues were necessary for survival, the human species would have perished a long time ago, instead of expanding exponentially. Her rich and challenging picture of human life and virtue in her novels points to a richer and more challenging conception of the final end than mere survival. Many of Rand\u2019s heroes, from Kira (We the Living) to Prometheus (Anthem) to John Galt (Atlas Shrugged), risk their lives for the sake of the values that make their lives worth living. Like Hobbes, Rand rightly points out that if everyone or most people were to start preying on each other, then no one would survive for long\u2014literally, and that generations of predators would end up destroying or driving away the producers, and thus destroying themselves (Anthem and Atlas Shrugged). But this doesn\u2019t show that a few predators in a society of producers cannot survive by predation. Indeed, Rand herself sometimes acknowledges that evil people can survive by free-riding (\u201chitch-hiking\u201d, as she calls it) on rational, productive people: If some men attempt to survive by means of brute force or fraud \u2026 it still remains true that their survival is made possible only by their victims, only by the men who choose to think and to produce the goods which they, the looters, are seizing. (1961b: 25) Rand often says that the final end is survival proper to a human being (1961b: 26), or that the final end is happiness (1961b: 27, 30). Neither can be reduced to survival simpliciter. In \u201cMan\u2019s Rights\u201d, Rand explains an individual\u2019s right to his own life as the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life. (1963b: 93 and 1967a: 321\u201322) \u201cLife\u201d here is explicated in terms of not only continued survival but also of fulfillment and enjoyment.\n\nFor all these reasons, a more plausible interpretation of Rand\u2019s view is that morality is required for surviving qua human being, that is, for living a life proper to a human being.\n\n2.3 Survival Qua Man as the Ultimate Value\n\nJust as the standard of value is survival qua human being, so the ultimate goal is one\u2019s own survival qua human being. To accept this standard and goal is to accept (i) the three cardinal values of reason, purpose (or purposiveness) and self-esteem as not only \u201cthe means to\u201d but also \u201cthe realization of one\u2019s ultimate value, one\u2019s own life\u201d (1961b: 27), and (ii) the three \u201ccorresponding virtues\u201d of rationality, productiveness, and pride. These values are means to one\u2019s life insofar as they further one\u2019s life as a rational being, and they realize it insofar as they express the value we place on our lives.\n\nWhat it means to value survival qua human being turns on the relationship of the three cardinal values to the three virtues. Rand often states that virtue is only a means to value. But when she explains how the three cardinal values \u201ccorrespond\u201d to their three virtues, she does not provide a means-end analysis (Badhwar 1999, 2001). Thus, she says:\n\nProductive work is the central purpose of a rational man\u2019s life, the central value that integrates and determines the hierarchy of all his other values. Reason is the source, the precondition of his productive work\u2014pride is the result. (1961b: 27)\n\nThe virtue of productiveness becomes the central example of purpose (one of the three cardinal values), reason (another cardinal value) becomes its source, and the virtue of pride becomes its result. Rand also defines rationality, which is \u201cthe basic virtue\u201d, in terms of\n\nthe recognition and acceptance of reason as one\u2019s only source of knowledge \u2026 and one\u2019s only guide to action. (1961b: 28)\n\nBy this definition, being rational means valuing reason in thought, word, and deed, and realizing reason in one\u2019s life means being rational: the virtue and the value entail each other.\n\nThis point generalizes to all the virtues and values. Further, since the (cardinal) values are both \u201cthe means to\u201d and \u201cthe realization of one\u2019s ultimate value\u201d (1961b: 27), it follows that the (cardinal) virtues are also both the means to and the realization of one\u2019s ultimate value: long-term survival qua human being. On this interpretation, to survive qua human being is none other than to lead a virtuous life in which one has realized one\u2019s potential.\n\nBoth survivalists and eudaimonists, however, point out that this conception of the final end contradicts Rand\u2019s oft-repeated claim that \u201cVirtue is not an end in itself.\u2026\u201d In addition, eudaimonists make the following objections:\n\nSince even a long, virtuous life need not be a happy one, positing it as the final end contradicts Rand\u2019s related claim that \u201cLife is the reward of virtue\u2014and happiness is the goal and reward of life\u201d (1957 [1992]: 939). It contradicts Rand\u2019s conception of the final end in her novels, where happiness is proclaimed as \u201cthe purpose, the sanction and the meaning of life\u201d (1957 [1992]: 674).\n\nIn addition, it is psychologically implausible to hold that we would choose mere survival as an end even if we were deeply unhappy and saw no happiness in our future (cf. Wright 2019 20).\n\nEudaimonists hold that the dominant and/or more plausible view expressed in Rand\u2019s writings is that happiness\u2014a happy life\u2014is the ultimate value, where a happy life is understood as a life of emotional fulfillment in worthwhile goals and activities. Happiness in this sense necessarily involves virtue, but is not identical with virtue (Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1978; Machan 1984, 2000; Mack 1984; Badhwar 1999, 2001; Hunt 1999; Long 2000).[4]\n\n2.4 Happiness as the Ultimate Value\n\nHappiness is the existentially and psychologically \u201csuccessful state of life\u201d (1961b: 27). As an emotion it is not simply a positive subjective state, as on some contemporary views, but an emotion that meets certain normative standards: \u201ca state of non-contradictory joy\u2014a joy without penalty or guilt\u201d, achievable only by\n\nthe man who desires nothing but rational goals, seeks nothing but rational values and finds his joy in nothing but rational actions. (1961b: 32)\n\nHappiness is also a form of life-affirmation:\n\nthe feeling of one\u2019s blessing upon the whole of the earth, the feeling of being in love with the fact that one exists and in this kind of world. (1957 [1992]: 105\u20136)\n\nThus, happiness is an emotionally positive state of mind in an objectively worthwhile state of life.\n\nRand holds that the pursuit of happiness is inseparable from the activity of maintaining one\u2019s life through the rational pursuit of rational goals (1961b: 29, 32). A virtuous life is, thus, essential to happiness. It is also a shield against soul-wracking unhappiness. Just as even great misfortunes don\u2019t throw Aristotle\u2019s virtuous individual into misery, they don\u2019t throw Rand\u2019s heroes into misery. Even at the worst of times, the virtuous individual\u2019s pain \u201conly goes down to a certain point\u201d (1943: 344), never touching the core of her being: the conviction that she is worthy and capable of happiness.[5]\n\nIn keeping with their richer conception of the final end, Rand\u2019s novels also employ a richer conception of virtue as an integrated intellectual-emotional character trait to think, feel, and act in certain ways, rather than simply as an act in light of a recognition of certain facts (Badhwar 1999, 2001). Her characters reveal their souls not only in what they say or do, notice or fail to notice, focus on or evade, on this or that occasion, but in their cognitive, emotional, and action dispositions, their style of being in the world. Their actions show not only an intellectual commitment to the right but a wholehearted \u201clove of rectitude\u201d (1957 [1992]: 512).\n\nThis basically Aristotelian view of virtue goes hand-in-hand with a basically Aristotelian view of emotions. Rand rejects the reason-emotion dichotomy as stemming, ultimately, from a false mind-body dichotomy. Emotions are neither raw feelings nor inherently irrational but, rather, automatized value-judgments:\n\nestimates of that which furthers man\u2019s values or threatens them \u2026 lightning calculators giving him the sum of his profit or loss. (1961b: 27)\n\nEmotions provide instant guidance when circumstances do not permit reasoning everything out anew. But our emotions are only as good as our reason, because they are \u201cprogrammed\u201d by our reason. Hence they can only be corrected by conscious reasoning, and in a conflict between reason and emotions, one must always side with the former.[6]\n\nEudaimonists argue that Rand\u2019s vision of a virtuous and happy life in her novels can be understood only as a form of eudaimonism, even if she sometimes makes statements inconsistent with this vision. The chief objection to eudaimonism is that, by defining a happy life partly in terms of virtue, it employs an unconvincing conception of happiness. The philosophical literature on happiness in this sense (usually called well-being) makes and answers this and other such objections (Annas 1993, Haybron 2008, Badhwar 2014).\n\n2.5 Virtues, Vices, and Egoism\n\nThe chief Objectivist virtues are rationality, integrity, honesty (with self and others), justice, independence, productiveness, and pride. Rationality,\n\none\u2019s total commitment \u2026 to the maintenance of a full mental focus in all issues, in all choices \u2026 to the fullest perception of reality within one\u2019s power, (1961b: 28)\n\nis the basic virtue of which the other virtues are aspects or derivatives. The virtues are thus united or reciprocal. Each virtue is defined partly in terms of a recognition of, and appropriate responsiveness to, some important fact or facts, a recognition and responsiveness understood by the agent to be indispensable for gaining, maintaining, or expressing her ultimate value. For example, integrity is \u201cthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake your consciousness\u201d (1957 [1992]: 936), a recognition that is expressed in loyalty to one\u2019s rational values and convictions, especially in the face of social pressures to surrender them (1961b: 28; 1964a: 52, 80); honesty is \u201cthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake existence\u201d, a recognition that is expressed in truthfulness in thought and speech (1957 [1992]: 936\u201337); and justice is\n\nthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake the character of men as you cannot fake the character of nature, \u2026 that every man must be judged for what he is and treated accordingly\u2026. (1957 [1992]: 937)\n\nConspicuous by their absence from Rand\u2019s list of the cardinal virtues are the \u201cvirtues of benevolence\u201d, such as kindness, charity, generosity, and forgiveness. Rand states that charity is not a major virtue or moral duty (1964b); likewise, presumably, kindness, generosity, and forgiveness. Whether, and how much, one should help others depends on their place in one\u2019s rationally defined hierarchy of values, and on the particular circumstances (whether they are worthy of help, what the likely consequences are of helping them, and so on). The greater their value vis-\u00e0-vis one\u2019s rational self-interest, the greater the help that one should be willing to give, ceteris paribus. What is never morally appropriate is to make a sacrifice, that is, to surrender something of value to oneself for the sake of something of less or no value to oneself. Thus, it can never be moral to knowingly risk one\u2019s life for a stranger (unless, of course, one\u2019s life is no longer worth living) or to court unhappiness for the happiness of another, whether stranger or friend. It is appropriate to help a stranger only in an emergency, and only when the risk to our own life or well-being is minimal (1963c: 43\u201345). This should not be taken to imply that helping a stranger is always morally optional, regardless of the circumstances. Indeed, people who are \u201ctotally indifferent to anything living and would not lift a finger to help a man or a dog left mangled by a hit-and-run driver\u201d are \u201cpsychopaths\u201d (1963c: 43\u201345) Rand makes even more concessions to \u201ccommon sense morality\u201d when she states that it\u2019s good to help a neighbor going through a hard time till he can get back on his own feet, if we can afford to and if we have no reason to think that he is undeserving. Charity understood thus is a virtue because it is an expression of the generalized good will and respect that all normal people have towards others as creatures who share with them the capacity to value (1963c: 46\u201347). Nathaniel Branden tries to reconcile charity with egoism by declaring that the former stems from a species-identification with another, such that, in revering others, people \u201care revering their own life\u201d. By acting charitably, people actualize this sense of kinship, without sacrificing their own well-being.\n\nThis last is true, but the desire to reduce all proper motivations to egoistic motivations leads Branden (and Rand and many Objectivists) to ignore the fact that charity is first and foremost profoundly other-regarding, prompted by another\u2019s plight rather than concern for one\u2019s own self-actualization. The same is true of trying to rescue a dog mangled by a hit-and-run driver, where the egoistic motivation must be even weaker, since here there is no species-identification, but rather only a \u201cgenus-identification\u201d with another sufferer.\n\nThe problem with Rand and Branden\u2019s ethical egoism can be sharpened by asking why we should not harm others, for example, by spitefully stepping on their gouty toes. Rand and Branden\u2019s answer has to be: because doing so will harm us. But why will it harm us? Because we have unjustly and irrationally hurt another out of spite, and injustice and irrationality are bad for us. But our action wouldn\u2019t be unjust and irrational if it didn\u2019t hurt them \u2013 if, in fact, stepping on their toes cured their gout and we did it for that reason. Clearly, then, the wrongness of our action and motivation depends, in the first instance, on what we know it will do to our victims. This is why we ought to apologize to them, and not to ourselves. It\u2019s right and important to consider the effect on ourselves of being spiteful, unjust, and irrational, but there is no good argument for the view that we ought to be just to others only or primarily because it is good for us. All other-regarding virtues are responses to other people\u2019s moral standing.\n\nAt any rate, the argument from identification can also be used to justify charity towards strangers in non-emergency situations, for example, towards those who are permanently disabled and unable to care for themselves (Badhwar forthcoming). Rand concedes as much in \u201cWhat is Capitalism?\u201d (1965) where she argues that people who are unable to work must rely on voluntary charity, thus implying that it is proper for those who can afford it to support strangers in non-emergency situations. And indeed, as recent scholarship has revealed, in her own life Rand was often extremely generous, not only towards friends and acquaintances, but also strangers.[7]\n\nThe question arises why Rand thinks that charity, kindness etc. are not major virtues when they meet all the conditions of appropriateness: the recipient is worthy of help, one can afford to help, it is in one\u2019s rational self-interest (or not contrary to it) to help, and so on. Perhaps Rand thinks that they are \u201cminor\u201d virtues because we are not obligated to act on them at all times, the way we are obligated to act justly and honestly at all times. A deeper reason, however, might be her conception of people as essentially agents rather than patients, doers rather than receivers, self-sufficient rather than dependent. Nevertheless, Rand\u2019s view of the unity of the virtues dictates that, even if we are not obligated to act on charity, kindness etc. at all times, they are just as important to possess as the other virtues. Moreover, in keeping with her emphasis on the importance of goodwill towards others and \u201cthe benevolent universe premise\u201d, Rand\u2019s heroes are often extraordinarily (and almost always appropriately) kind and generous, not only towards those they love but also towards mere acquaintances, and even sometimes adversaries. Striking examples include, from The Fountainhead, Howard Roark\u2019s unsought-for attempt to give hope and courage to Steven Mallory, the gifted young sculptor whose failure to get work has driven him to the verge of a spiritual and physical collapse, and Roark\u2019s unreproachful help to his erstwhile adversary, Peter Keating, when Keating falls on hard times. In Atlas Shrugged, Dagny offers support to a heart-broken and despairing Cheryl Taggart who, in the past, has treated Dagny with scorn, and Hank Rearden generously supports his exploitative family before he realizes their exploitativeness.[8] Rand\u2019s implicit recognition that kindness and generosity are important virtues is shown also in her depiction of her villains as lacking all kindness and generosity.\n\nJust as rationality, a focus on reality, is at the heart of every virtue, so irrationality, evasion of reality (including self-deception), is at the heart of every vice. Rand\u2019s villains are all master evaders motivated by a desire for power, social status, fame, or unearned wealth, and resentment of the good. They are \u201csecond-handers\u201d\u2014people whose primary relationship is to other people rather than to reality. Between the virtuous and the vicious are the \u201cinnocently wrong\u201d, people who adopt wrong moral principles or make wrong choices, not through evasion but through an error of judgment (Rand does not explicitly recognize any moral category other than virtue, vice, and moral error, although her novels portray characters that do not easily fit into any of these categories). Hank Rearden, in Atlas Shrugged, is the great innocent living under a burden of unearned guilt because of his mistaken sense of honor and a family interested only in manipulating and using him. Cheryl Taggart is killed by the too-sudden revelation that the man she loved and admired as the embodiment of her ideals is a fraud\u2014and that the world is full of such frauds.\n\nAs already indicated, Rand justifies virtue in both instrumental and non-instrumental terms, though without distinguishing between them. The instrumental arguments show the existential and psychological rewards of virtue and costs of vice. In her depiction of her heroes, Rand shows her conviction that virtue creates an inner harmony and serenity. Virtue also makes one trustworthy, and thus enables mutually beneficial interactions with others. Evasiveness, by contrast, traps one in a \u201ctangled web\u201d of rationalizations and pretenses. The evader who deceives others is either eventually caught, or lives in fear of getting caught, becoming dependent on others\u2019 unconsciousness. He is \u201ca fool\u201d, says a character in Atlas Shrugged, \u201cwhose source of values is the fools he succeeds in fooling\u201d (1957 [1992]: 945). Further, like Sartre, Rand holds that no evasion is completely successful, because the truth constantly threatens to resurface. Hence, the evader\u2019s \u201cdiseased soul\u201d is in a state of constant inner conflict and anxiety as he tries to suppress his awareness of uncomfortable truths while maintaining his hold on others. His lack of integrity and of esteem for reality results in a lack of self-love or self-esteem and, indeed, of a solid self. (It is noteworthy, however, that Rand\u2019s portrayal of Gail Wynand in The Fountainhead is closer to Aristotle\u2019s portrayal of the vicious man in Book III of the Nicomachean Ethics as someone who is \u201cunconscious of his vice\u201d than to her own stated view of the evader.)\n\nThese views are familiar from the history of philosophy, but many readers find their expression in Rand\u2019s novels to be of unusual psychological depth and conviction. Nevertheless, the views are subject to the well-known objection that the complexity and variability of human psychology and society allow only \u201cfor the most part\u201d generalizations about the existential and psychological benefits of virtue or costs of vice. For example, it is possible for a small injustice to lead to great rewards, especially since others are willing to shrug off or forgive occasional transgressions. It is also possible for poor introspection, forgetfulness, or self-acceptance to allow one to evade something without any need for supporting evasions or damage to one\u2019s self-esteem. Again, even if every wrongdoing carries psychological costs, these might sometimes be outweighed by the long-term psychological and existential costs of doing the right thing (as Rand herself suggests in her portrayal of the embittered Henry Cameron and Stephen Mallory in The Fountainhead).\n\nThe non-instrumentalist justification of virtue in Rand\u2019s novels is largely immune to these objections (though subject to the objections noted in 2.4 above). To compromise morally is, necessarily, to compromise one\u2019s own (objectively conceived) happiness, because no existential loss can compare to the loss of moral integrity. Rectitude is partly constitutive of genuine happiness because it expresses the right relationship to reality: to existence, to oneself, and to others. For the same reason, it is partly constitutive of a self worth loving, an ideally human or rational self. Any value gained at the price of rectitude is only the simulacrum of genuine value. In a variety of conceptually interconnected ways, then, virtuous individuals are necessarily better off than those willing to take moral short-cuts. In its structure and much of its content, Rand\u2019s ethical egoism is thus of a piece with the egoism of ancient eudaimonistic theories.\n\nOf course, this non-instrumentalist justification of virtue depends on the prior instrumentalist justification, viz., that in normal circumstances (that is, in a society of more or less virtuous people), virtue enables us to gain both external and psychological goods. If justice or kindness were systematically bad for human beings, leading to disease and death, they would not be virtues. If rationality routinely led to an early demise, no one would value rationality. But this does not entail, as Salmieri seems to think, that the ultimate value is literal survival (Salmieri 2019). All it entails is that the virtues be compatible with survival in normal circumstances. For it is easy to see that if justice or kindness systematically led to deep depression, and rationality routinely sucked the joy out of life, only the rare misery-lover would value his life, or the virtues. Survival is a necessary condition of a happy life (as well as an unhappy one), not an ultimate value. And it\u2019s only because the virtues lead to, and partly constitute, a happy (eudaimonic) life, that a virtuous person considers it a greater loss to betray his principles than to lose the work he loves \u2013 or, sometimes, even his life. One of the best examples of this from Rand\u2019s own work is Howard Roark\u2019s decision to act out of integrity, even at the cost of being unable to practice architecture (The Fountainhead). Another example concerns two minor characters in We The Living who risk \u2013 and lose \u2013 their freedom and lives for resisting the new communist regime. (Note, however, that Rand does not think that we are morally obligated to martyr ourselves to fight evil. All we are obligated to do is not be complicit in evil, or betray our values.)\n\nEven on this indirect, sophisticated egoism, where the good to the agent lies in being virtuous, Rand\u2019s theory is open to the objection often levied against egoistic theories, viz., that they give the wrong reason for acting in other-regarding ways \u2013 justly, kindly, etc. My act does not adequately express the virtue of justice if I give you your due solely or primarily because acting justly is good for me rather than because I recognize and respect your moral standing, your entitlement to be treated justly. Nor does my helping you when you need help adequately express goodwill or kindness if I help you solely or primarily because acting benevolently is good for me. One way out taken by some other theories is to argue that the egoist\u2019s justification is egoistic but not her motivation. Rand does not address the \u201cwrong-reason\u201d objection, but there is no hint in her writings that she would accept this dichotomy between justification and motivation. The root of the problem is that, although Rand rejects psychological egoism, she seems to regard genuine goodwill towards, or love of, others as an offshoot of proper self-love, as though there were no independent source of love for others in human nature. This is where her metaethics and ethics differ most starkly from that of Aristotle.\n\n2.6 Altruism\n\nAccording to Rand, there is only one alternative to being rationally self-interested: sacrificing one\u2019s proper interests, either for the sake of other people (which she equates with altruism) or for the sake of the supernatural (which she calls mysticism) (1982a: ch. 7). \u201cThe basic principle of altruism\u201d, she argues, \u201cis that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the only justification of his existence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue and value\u201d (\u201cFaith and Force,\u201d PWNI 61). Kant\u2019s ethics is a secularized mysticism insofar as it rests on categorical commands and duty for duty\u2019s sake, which is to say: regardless of any earthly desire or interest (1970). An altruistic ethics equates right action with self-sacrifice for the sake of others\u2019 good and immorality with \u201cselfishness\u201d, while saying nothing about the standard of the good (\u201cIntroduction\u201d, 1964a: iii; 1974). It thus fails to answer the prior question of what code of values we should follow and why, and provides no motivation to be moral other than guilt over \u201cselfishness\u201d. When taken to its logical conclusion, altruism does not simply tell us that it is \u201cselfish\u201d to pursue our own desires, but also that it is \u201cselfish to uphold\u2026 [our own] convictions, \u2026 [that we] must sacrifice them to the convictions of others\u201d (Rand 1957 [1992]: 943; Galt\u2019s Speech, Rand 1961a: 142). In foreign policy, altruism is used to justify and gain support for America\u2019s intervention in other countries (1966a). Altruism is also the reason why so many sympathize with, or even praise, bloody dictatorships that proudly proclaim that the sacrifice of the individual is a necessary and noble means to the goal of the collective good (Rand 1966a).\n\nAs a moral code, altruism is impractical, because its requirements are contrary to the requirements of life and happiness, both the agent\u2019s and other people\u2019s. As such, it is also profoundly immoral. Altruism leaves us without any moral guidance in our everyday lives and gives morality a bad name.\n\nWhat, then, is the psychological explanation for the widespread equation of altruism with morality? Rand suggests various explanations reminiscent of Nietzsche\u2019s analysis of the psychology of altruism. The theorists and preachers of altruism are motivated largely by a desire to control and manipulate others by playing on their guilt. Those who accept their teachings typically do so either because of guilt over their own superior achievements, or because, lacking any \u201cintellectual integrity, love of truth\u2026or a passionate dedication to an idea\u201d, they have nothing much worth saving, and so do not mind sacrificing themselves (\u201cSelfishness Without a Self\u201d, 1973b; 1982a). Some altruists are altruists because their mentalities are still frozen in a tribal past when survival required the sacrifice of some for the sake of others (1973b). Rand herself rejects a zero-sum picture of human relationships, so long as everyone in the relationship acts rationally.\n\nRand\u2019s defense of \u201cselfishness\u201d (rational self-interest) and rejection of altruism (living for others\u2019 sake) are part of the reason both for her popularity with the general reader, and her unpopularity with philosophers and other intellectuals, although some would no doubt agree with her rejection of abject self-sacrifice and her recognition of proper concern with the self as moral (Falk 1963; Gilligan 1982; Hampton 1993; Badhwar 1993a). The general reader who responds positively to Rand\u2019s work finds, for the first time, a moral justification for pursuing a life of her or his own and a liberation from \u201cunearned guilt\u201d. The philosopher who responds negatively to her work finds many biased and simplistic interpretations of philosophers and philosophical doctrines, including her claim that she is the first to consistently defend a morality of rational self-interest, all other philosophers having defended either altruism or mysticism (Pojman 1995). Her critics also challenge her equation of altruism with abject self-sacrifice (Rachels 2000, Flew 1984), and her claim (explained below) that there is no conflict between people\u2019s rational interests (Flew 1984).\n\n3. Social-Political Philosophy\n\n3.1 Rights, Capitalism, the Trader Principle, and Government\n\n\u201cForce and mind are opposites; morality ends where a gun begins\u201d (Atlas Shrugged 1023). Not only actually shooting someone, but also threatening him with a gun, is an act of force. The non-initiation of force against others is the basic moral principle guiding our interactions with others, whether in a political society, or in the state of nature. It is also the basic political principle: \u201cno man may initiate the use of physical force against others. \u2026 Men have the right to use physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use\u201d (1961b, 1964a: 36). This political principle binds not only individuals in their interactions with each other, but also, importantly, the government. Rand\u2019s ideal society is a society of independent individuals who respect each other\u2019s rights to life, liberty, and property, and who trade value for value, materially and spiritually. They live, in her words, by \u201cthe trader principle\u201d. Individual rights and the trader principle are both dictated by the fact that, as rational, independent beings, we need to think and act for our \u201cproper survival\u201d (1961b: 31). Both are based in human nature, and required by respect for individuals as ends in themselves, not mere means to others\u2019 ends. But what exactly is a right?\n\n\u201cRights\u201d are a moral concept\u2014the concept that provides a logical transition from the principles guiding an individual\u2019s actions to the principles guiding his relationship with others\u2014the concept that preserves and protects individual morality in a social context\u2014the link between the moral code of a man and the legal code of a society, between ethics and politics. Individual rights are the means of subordinating society to moral law. (1963b: 92).\n\nAgain,\n\nA \u201cright\u201d is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man\u2019s freedom of action in a social context. (1964a 93).\n\nThese rights are based in human nature, and are basically rights to actions, not to things or outcomes, and they can be violated only through the initiation or threat of force, or through fraud. Hence, all natural rights are negative, that is, claims on others\u2019 non-interference, and not claims on them to provide one with certain goods or outcomes.[9] The fundamental right is the right to life: the right to take the actions necessary for sustaining the life proper to a human being.\n\nThe right to life means\u2026the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life. (Such is the meaning of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.). (1963b: 93)\n\nThe right to liberty is the right to act (including to write and speak) on one\u2019s judgment; the right to the pursuit of happiness is the right to pursue goals for one\u2019s own fulfillment; the right to property is \u201cthe right to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values\u201d (1963b: 94). Like the mind-body dichotomy, the common dichotomy between \u201chuman rights\u201d and the right to property is a false one, because to own one\u2019s life is to own one\u2019s actions and their fruits (1962b: 91).[10] Just as there is a causal and logical connection between the virtues, so there is between these rights: a government that violates human rights also violates property rights. Thus, for example, in violating the right to freedom of expression by banning \u201cobscene\u201d speech on TV, the government violates the property right of the owners of the TV station to use their property as they see fit. Like other libertarians, both right (market) and left (egalitarian), Rand opposes state regulation of morality, as well as forced service to the state, whether military or civilian. She criticizes both conservatives and liberals (as these terms are understood in American politics) for wanting government to control the realm they regard as important: the spiritual or moral realm in the case of conservatives, and the material or economic realm in the case of liberals (1981b). Both sides thus betray a lack of understanding of the fact that human beings need to be free in both realms to be free in either.\n\nCritics have pointed out that if we have rights only because we need them for our survival and happiness, then we have no right to take actions that are contrary to our survival and happiness, such as blindly following a guru instead of thinking for ourselves, living off others because we prefer the life of a couch potato to fending for ourselves, wasting our property instead of using it wisely, or, most obviously, committing suicide (Mack 1984; Zwolinski 2019). Yet the freedom to do only that which is morally good or rational is no freedom. But there is another interpretation of the claim that \u201cThe right to life means\u2026the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life.\u201d What Rand is pointing out here is that we would not have rights if we did not need them for our survival and happiness (Badhwar 2017, Miller & Mossoff 2019). This need (and the fact that we value our survival and happiness) is the source of rights. If by our very nature we didn\u2019t care whether we lived or died, didn\u2019t care about being forced by the government or other people to act in certain ways and not others, had no use for property, and couldn\u2019t be bothered to think for ourselves, we would have no rights. It doesn\u2019t follow, however, that we don\u2019t have the right to act contrary to the requirements of our survival or happiness. As Rand says elsewhere:\n\nA right is the sanction of independent action. A right is that which can be exercised without anyone\u2019s permission (Rand 2018 83). [A] right is the moral sanction of a positive, of his freedom to act on his own judgment, for his own goals, by his own voluntary, uncoerced choice. (Rand 1963b 93.)\n\nIn spite of several statements that justify such freedom in terms of the individual\u2019s rational judgments (Rand 1965 17), it is the position taken here that is compatible with Rand\u2019s deep-seated commitment to liberty and a minimal government.\n\nAnother criticism of Rand\u2019s theory of rights is that it is incompatible with her ethical egoism, because respect for others\u2019 rights cannot be justified as a means to the ultimate end of one\u2019s survival (Mack 1984; Flew 1984). For under perfectly realistic scenarios, one\u2019s survival can require one to violate another\u2019s right to life or property. Thus, according to these critics, Rand\u2019s defense of rights suffers from the same unresolved tension between the instrumentalist strand and the deontic strand that we find in her justification of morality in general (Mack 1984, 2003). On our eudaimonistic interpretation of Rand\u2019s ethical egoism and theory of rights, there is no incompatibility between the two. Nevertheless, as we\u2019ve argued above, both her ethical egoism and her theory of rights face the criticism that the primary reason for respecting others\u2019 rights, or exercising any of the other-regarding virtues, is not one\u2019s eudaimonia but the fact that others are ends in themselves. What promotes our eudaimonia is recognizing this and living accordingly, but our own eudaimonia is not the primary reason for respecting people\u2019s rights.\n\nEverything said so far shows that Rand believes that individuals have rights even in a state of nature, or a society without a government. Yet in later years, in a workshop on rights, Rand suggests that rights exist only in a society with some kind of authority and a \u201cformulated morality\u201d (2018: 111). It is not clear what Rand means by \u201cformulated morality\u201d: a written, or at least explicitly stated, morality that recognizes rights, like the Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution? Or like Thomas Paine\u2019s Rights of Man?? But aren\u2019t there many societies \u2013 perhaps a majority \u2013 that don\u2019t have a formulated morality yet do recognize at least individuals\u2019 basic rights against each other and the government, and many that can produce paper Constitutions claiming to recognize these rights that, in fact, they deny their citizens? In any case, Rand takes back her controversial statement by reiterating her earlier view that:\n\nThe source of man\u2019s rights is not divine law or congressional law, but the law of identity. A is A and Man is Man. Rights are conditions of existence required by man\u2019s nature for his proper survival (\u201cGalt\u2019s Speech,\u201d Rand 1961a: 182).\n\nWhat we don\u2019t have in the absence of a government, she says, is objectively defined laws that can determine if a right has been violated (2018: 211). A \u201cproper government,\u201d in her words, \u201cis the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control, i.e., under objectively defined laws\u201d (1963a: 128).\n\nOnkar Ghate (2019) and Harry Binswanger (2019) both defend this view. Ghate uses two scenarios involving individuals in a state of nature. Suppose you are by yourself on a desert island, and you domesticate a pig. Then someone from a neighboring tribe steals it. Do you have a right to retaliate by stealing some of his property, or stealing from his relatives? Again, suppose Robinson Crusoe and Friday are strangers sharing an island, and Crusoe invents a superior spear. Does Friday have a right to copy it? Ghate\u2019s main point is that because individuals in his scenarios don\u2019t have a government, they don\u2019t have objectively defined laws, and because they don\u2019t have objectively defined laws, the boundaries of their property rights are unclear. But Ghate does not explain why you, the pig owner, cannot talk to the tribe and come up with a mutually agreeable solution, or why Crusoe and Friday can\u2019t talk things over and decide on the boundaries of their rights vis-a-vis each other (if Crusoe has any common sense, he\u2019ll encourage Friday to copy his spear and propose that they cooperate in their future hunts). Of course the tribe and you might not be able to reach a resolution satisfactory to both of you. But that doesn\u2019t mean that it is in principle impossible to do so. Neither Rand nor Ghate (2019) provide an explanation of why a peaceful society of people without a government cannot come up with objective laws that define the boundaries of their rights \u2013 as, in fact, they do in Rand\u2019s Atlantis: Galt\u2019s Gulch. Their view seems to imply that if the Founding Fathers had been shipwrecked for 5 years on a desert island, they could not have come up with a Bill of Rights that defined the limits of their liberties vis-a-vis each other, or set up a fair system of adjudication in the event of a dispute. But we don\u2019t have to engage in hypotheticals. As many scholars have pointed out, starting in the 11th C, merchants from various countries created the body of law called the Law Merchant in order to protect foreign merchants not protected by the local laws (Benson 1989; see the entry on law merchant at libertarianism.org, linked from Other Internet Resources). The Law Merchant was uniform throughout Europe, and enforced by courts also created by merchants in European cities, without the involvement of any European government.\n\nRand argues that the only just social-political system, the only system compatible with our rational nature and with the right of individuals to live for their own sakes, is capitalism (1965, 1967b), that is,\n\nlaissez-faire capitalism\u2014with a separation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church. (1961b, 1964a)\n\nState regulation of the market, she argues, is responsible for corrupting both state and market institutions, just as political regulation of religion (or religious regulation of politics), wherever it exists, corrupts both state and religious institutions. Regulation creates the opportunity for the trading of favors between politicians and religious leaders, and politicians and businesses. Atlas Shrugged offers a complex and compelling depiction of the economic, political, and moral corruption spawned by \u201ccronyism\u201d between government and business. Laissez-faire capitalism is \u201cthe only [social] system that bans force from social relationships\u201d domestically and abroad, because the trader and the warrior are antagonists (Rand 1966a). Rand\u2019s conception of capitalism is, thus, more radical than the mainstream conception, and her defense of it significantly different both from the utilitarian defenses given by most economists, and the religious defenses given by many conservatives (for discussion, see Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1984b; Machan 1984). She does, of course, praise capitalism (or semi-capitalism) for creating widespread prosperity, but this feature is itself explained only by the fact that it leaves individuals free to produce in peace. In Atlas Shrugged, Rand distinguishes between the few business people who earn their money through honest effort, without seeking favors from the government, and the vast majority who are members of \u201cthe aristocracy of pull\u201d (\u201ccrony capitalists\u201d, in contemporary terminology) and get rich only through such favors, a situation that she thinks prevails, and has always prevailed, in the real world (Rand 1964c). She holds that for a short period in the nineteenth-century America came closer to a laissez-faire system than any other society before or since, but that capitalism remains an unknown ideal. Some critics complain, however, that in her non-fiction (1961c) Rand does not always recognize the aristocrats of pull in the real world\u2014business leaders who lobby politicians for subsidies for themselves and restrictions on their competitors (Rothbard 1968; Johnson 2006).\n\nRand rejects the criticism that unregulated, laissez-faire capitalism would lead to a concentration of power in a few hands and undermine people\u2019s ability to lead their own lives, because laissez-faire capitalism requires the rule of law, a well-defined system of property rights, freedom of contract, and, as a corollary, a government that abstains from all favoritism. In such a society, competition and opportunity will flourish, and prevent concentration of power in a few hands.\n\nRand holds that there is no conflict between one person\u2019s rational interests and another\u2019s, hence that there is no conflict between their rights (1962a, 1964a: 57\u201365). Is it true, however, that rational interests cannot conflict, or that, if they do, it follows that rights must also conflict? Our answer to both questions is \u2018no\u2019. We think that whenever two or more people have a rational interest in one good, there is potential for conflict, and sometimes that potential is actualized. To show otherwise, Rand considers a situation in which two people apply for the same job, and the better candidate gets the job. There is no conflict of interests here, she argues, because the better candidate has earned the job, and the loser cannot rationally wish to have been given the job. Both applicants also know that competition for jobs is a good thing, because the business would close if only one person applied for its jobs (presumably, because that would mean that the business wasn\u2019t doing very well).\n\nBoth points are well-taken. But what if the employer is not rational and gives the job to the somewhat less qualified applicant because, say, he reminds the employer of his long-lost brother? Or, what if the two candidates are equally qualified, and the hiring committee chooses one over the other by tossing a coin? In both cases there is a conflict of interests between two rational applicants. Rand raises the first possibility, that of the irrational employer, but doesn\u2019t trace its implications for her thesis that rational interests don\u2019t conflict. The second possibility, that of two equally qualified candidates, she does not consider at all. Rand would be on firmer ground if she were to argue that there is no necessary conflict between rational interests, that is, that it is not in their nature to conflict. When they conflict, it is due to contingent factors, such as only one job for two equally qualified people. In any case, a conflict between rational interests does not entail a conflict between rights, since, as Rand herself points out, neither party has a right to the job.\n\nRand defines government as:\n\nan institution that holds the exclusive power to enforce certain rules of social conduct in a given geographical area. (1963a: 125)\n\nA proper government is:\n\nthe means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control\u2014i.e., under objectively defined law. (1963b: 128)\n\nSuch a government is minimal, limited to protecting us from criminals and foreign aggressors, and enforcing individual rights and contracts with the help of the police and armed forces, using objectively defined civil and criminal laws and courts. Someone who violates his contracts, or engages in fraud, is guilty of the \u201cindirect\u201d use of force, in that he obtains a value from another without that person\u2019s consent (1963a: 111). Accordingly, the government may use or threaten force only in retaliation against those who initiate or threaten force directly or indirectly. A government that tries to enforce the brother\u2019s keeper principle\u2014\u201cfrom each according to his ability, to each according to his need\u201d; or that drafts citizens into the armed services or \u201cpublic service\u201d; or that forces them, directly or indirectly, to become more virtuous, well-mannered, healthy, or wealthy, violates rights. Statism in all its forms, from unlimited democracy to a mixed economy to dictatorship, is at odds with our status as independent, rational beings, as ends in ourselves. Statism also destroys ability and fails to fulfill anyone\u2019s needs for long, because \u201c[t]o deal with men by force is as impractical as to deal with nature by persuasion\u201d (1973a: 32). The fountainhead of all progress is the human mind, and the mind does not function well when forced.\n\nIn Atlas Shrugged Rand depicts her utopia, Galt\u2019s Gulch, as a \u201cvoluntary association of men held together by nothing but every man\u2019s self-interest\u201d, without any formal organization (1957 [1992]: 690). There is a judge to arbitrate disagreements, but there has never been any need for arbitration. Galt\u2019s Gulch is, thus, an anarchist society, although Rand never calls it that. In \u201cThe Nature of Government\u201d, however, Rand rejects anarchism as irrational and unworkable because, she says, it is incompatible with a single, objective system of law and, thus, with rights and peaceful cooperation (1963a; cf. 2018b). Anarchist critics, such as Roy Childs (1969 [1994]) and Murray Rothbard (1978), have argued that a territorial monopoly on law and force (government) is not necessary, because people can establish a just and effective legal system in a competitive market of security providers (see Long and Machan 2009). The Law Merchant, a body of law established and enforced in private courts by the merchants of various countries, illustrates the possibility of an effective voluntary legal system. Further, a government is incompatible with Rand\u2019s own principle of the non-initiation of force, a principle she regards as the linchpin of a moral society (Long 2013; cf. Cox 2013a and 2013b).\n\nThe trader principle states that a voluntary, mutually beneficial exchange between independent equals is the only basis for a mutually respectful and rational relationship (1961b: 31). It is also the only basis for a peaceful relationship among countries: \u201cthe trader and the warrior have been fundamental antagonists throughout history\u201d (1966a: 38).\n\nThe trader principle applies to emotional relationships as well. To love or admire someone is to \u201cpay\u201d him for the pleasure one derives from his virtues (1961b: 31)\u2014or, Rand might say in the case of love for a small child, from his personality. It would seem, however, that the trade between parent and child is unequal, given that the child receives both pleasure and material support from the parent. And it is unclear how the trader principle applies at all when a severe disability renders a beloved child or spouse a source of pain rather than pleasure.\n\n3.2 Feminism\n\nIf feminism is the view that women are, and ought to be recognized as, men\u2019s intellectual, moral, sexual, and political equals, then the Objectivist philosophy of human nature is inherently feminist, since it applies equally to all human beings, regardless of gender (or race) (N. Branden 1999). Decades before it was considered acceptable for women to lack \u201cmaternal instincts\u201d or pursue careers, Rand created heroines who lack the first and pursue the second, free of guilt or self-doubt.[11] Kira (We the Living) wants to be an engineer, and Dagny (Atlas Shrugged) runs Taggart Transcontinental, the largest and most successful transcontinental railroad in the country. None of Rand\u2019s heroines sacrifices her interests, intellect, or principles for the man or men in her life. One literary critic argues that Dagny is the first, and perhaps only, epic heroine in Western literature because of the grandness of her vision, her courage and integrity, her unusual abilities, and her national importance (Michalson 1999). Rand\u2019s depiction of her heroines\u2019 enjoyment of sex and their freedom from all merely conventional norms about sex anticipates the sexual liberation movement of the 20th century by at least 30 years. In all three novels, it is the heroine who has the power to choose which of the men who love, admire, and desire her (and only her) she will have. Rand was also an ardent champion of a woman\u2019s right to control her own reproductive choices (1968a, 1981).\n\nHer relationship to the feminist movement, however, was more complex. Although she praised Betty Friedan\u2019s The Feminine Mystique, mainstream feminism\u2019s collectivism and emphasis on women as victims later led her to reject feminism as such. Many theorists argue that Rand\u2019s work, especially Atlas Shrugged, upholds important feminist ideals, even as it succumbs to some anti-feminist tendencies that contradict her individualistic ethics (e.g., Gladstein 1978, 1999; B. Branden 1999; Presley 1999; Sheaffer 1999; Taylor 1999). Many others regard her and her work as plainly anti-feminist, with Susan Brownmiller even calling her \u201ca traitor to her own sex\u201d (Brownmiller 1975). One criticism takes aim at the individualism of Rand\u2019s ethics and politics, which rejects any special government help for women or discrimination against men (e.g., Harrison 1978). Another objects that Rand has internalized a masculine conception of human nature and virtue, and then created her ideal woman in light of this conception (Brownmiller 1975; Glennon 1979). This may be responsible for Rand\u2019s puzzling (and offensive) view that the essence of femininity is to hero-worship (not men, but) masculinity, while insisting (as her novels depict) that women and men are inherently equal and that the ideal romantic relationship is between moral and intellectual equals (1968b; cf. Brown 1999). At least as offensive to many are the violent sex scenes in her novels, especially the infamous scene in The Fountainhead that many regard as rape, where Howard Roark has sex with Dominique in spite of her resistance.\n\nThose who reject the charge of rape argue that in the 1940s and 50s, when Rand wrote her novels, it would have been seen as rough sex rather than non-consensual sex (McElroy 1999; Sheaffer 1999). That Rand herself thought of this scene as consensual is shown a few pages later, when she writes: \u201cThey had been united in an understanding beyond the violence, beyond the deliberate obscenity of his action\u201d (1943: 218). And in letters to disturbed readers in 1946 and 1965, Rand denied that the scene is \u201cactual rape\u201d which, she stated, is \u201ca dreadful crime\u201d, a \u201cvicious action and a violation of a woman\u2019s rights\u201d (Rand 1995a). On the other hand, she also depicts Dominique exultantly telling herself that she\u2019s been raped. McElroy wonders if having her heroine call it rape is just another instance of Rand\u2019s desire to provoke and shock the reader (McElroy 1999), as when she uses \u201cselfishness\u201d to mean \u201crational self-interest\u201d.\n\n4. Aesthetics\n\nRand holds that our actions need guidance by a vision of the fundamental nature of the universe and of the efficacy of human thought and activity\u2014a vision that can be grasped directly rather than requiring the conscious repetition of long chains of abstract reasoning. The chief function of art is to meet this psychological need by expressing abstract conceptual values and metaphysical truths in concrete perceptible form. Art, according to Rand, constitutes a selective, stylized re-creation of reality, with the principle of selection being the artist\u2019s \u201csense of life\u201d, a set of implicit \u201cmetaphysical value-judgments\u201d, i.e., judgments about what is fundamentally significant about the world and our place in it. (There is controversy among Rand scholars as to whether what is re-created in art is certain elements of reality or reality as a whole, i.e., a \u201cmicrocosm\u201d, as well as how and whether the concept of re-creation applies to apparently non-representational forms of art: Torres and Kamhi 2000; Bissell 2004.) Both the artist\u2019s creative work and the audience\u2019s emotional responses to it are driven by their senses of life, that is, the worldviews they have \u201cformed by a process of emotional generalization \u2026 a subconscious counterpart of a process of abstraction\u201d (1966b: 27). The role of art in sustaining us psychologically by providing a concretization of our most fundamental values is a frequent theme in Rand\u2019s fiction as well, especially The Fountainhead.[12]\n\nWhile art can be used to convey information or to advocate a position, such functions are secondary to its chief task: providing an object whose mere contemplation brings spiritual fulfillment. Hence Rand does not regard her own novels primarily as vehicles for her philosophy, though of course they are that inter alia. Given her own worldview, Rand favors literature with a strong plot as a way of expressing purposeful human action in a world of causal regularity, and stories involving value-conflicts as a way of expressing the importance of free choice; hence her preference for romantic (as opposed to, e.g., naturalistic) literature. But Rand holds that it is possible to evaluate an artwork\u2019s aesthetic value simply in terms of its success in conveying a concretization of the artist\u2019s sense of life, whether or not one shares the values and judgments so conveyed."}, {"url": "https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL59188A/Ayn_Rand", "page_content": "Alice O'Connor (born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum;[a] February 2, [O.S.

Her father was upwardly mobile and a pharmacist and her mother was socially ambitious and religiously observant.[13] Rand later said she found school unchallenging and began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten.[14] At the prestigious Stoiunina Gymnasium, her closest friend was Vladimir Nabokov's younger sister, Olga. The two girls shared an intense interest in politics and would engage in debates at the Nabokov mansion: while Olga defended constitutional monarchy, Alisa supported republican ideals.[15]\n\nShe was twelve at the time of the February Revolution of 1917, during which she favored Alexander Kerensky over Tsar Nicholas II. The subsequent October Revolution and the rule of the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin disrupted the life the family had previously enjoyed. Her father's business was confiscated, and the family fled to the Crimean Peninsula, which was initially under control of the White Army during the Russian Civil War. While in high school, she realized that she was an atheist and valued reason above any other human virtue. After graduating from high school in the Crimea in June 1921, she returned with her family to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg was renamed at that time), where they faced desperate conditions, on occasion nearly starving.[16][17]\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution, universities were opened to women, allowing her to be in the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University.[18] At the age of 16, she began her studies in the department of social pedagogy, majoring in history.[19] At the university she was introduced to the writings of Aristotle and Plato,[20] who would be her greatest influence and counter-influence, respectively.[21] She also studied the philosophical works of Friedrich Nietzsche.[22] Able to read French, German and Russian, she also discovered the writers Fyodor Dostoevsky, Victor Hugo, Edmond Rostand, and Friedrich Schiller, who became her perennial favorites.[23]\n\nAlong with many other bourgeois students, she was purged from the university shortly before graduating. After complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists, however, many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate,[24] which she did in October 1924.[25] She then studied for a year at the State Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad. For an assignment she wrote an essay about the Polish actress Pola Negri, which became her first published work.[26]\n\nBy this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be Rand,[27] possibly because it is graphically similar to a vowelless excerpt \u0420\u0437\u043d\u0431 of her birth surname in Cyrillic handwriting,[28] and she adopted the first name Ayn, either from a Finnish name Aino or from the Hebrew word \u05e2\u05d9\u05df (ayin, meaning \"eye\").[b]\n\nArrival in the United States [ edit ]\n\n[26] Cover of Rand's first published work, a 2,500-word monograph on actress Pola Negri published in 1925\n\nIn late 1925, Rand was granted a visa to visit relatives in Chicago.[31] She departed on January 17, 1926.[32] When she arrived in New York City on February 19, 1926, she was so impressed with the skyline of Manhattan that she cried what she later called \"tears of splendor\".[33] Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter, she lived for a few months with her relatives, one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films free of charge. She then left for Hollywood, California.[34]\n\nIn Hollywood, a chance meeting with famed director Cecil B. DeMille led to work as an extra in his film The King of Kings and a subsequent job as a junior screenwriter.[35] While working on The King of Kings, she met an aspiring young actor, Frank O'Connor; the two were married on April 15, 1929. She became a permanent American resident in July 1929 and an American citizen on March 3, 1931.[36] Taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing, she worked for a time as the head of the costume department at RKO Studios.[37] She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States, but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate.[38]\n\nEarly fiction [ edit ]\n\nRand's first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay Red Pawn to Universal Studios in 1932, although it was never produced.[39] This was followed by the courtroom drama Night of January 16th, first produced by E. E. Clive in Hollywood in 1934 and then successfully reopened on Broadway in 1935. Each night a jury was selected from members of the audience; based on the jury's vote, one of two different endings would be performed.[40] In 1941, Paramount Pictures produced a movie loosely based on the play. Rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result.[41] Ideal is a novel and play written in 1934 which were first published in 2015 by her estate. The heroine is an actress who embodies Randian ideals.[42]\n\nRand's first published novel, the semi-autobiographical We the Living, was published in 1936. Set in Soviet Russia, it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state. In a 1959 foreword to the novel, Rand stated that We the Living \"is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write. It is not an autobiography in the literal, but only in the intellectual sense. The plot is invented, the background is not ...\"[43] Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print,[44] although European editions continued to sell.[45] After the success of her later novels, Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies.[46] In 1942, without Rand's knowledge or permission, the novel was made into a pair of Italian films, Noi vivi and Addio, Kira. Rediscovered in the 1960s, these films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as We the Living in 1986.[47]\n\nHer novella Anthem was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel, The Fountainhead. It presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word 'I' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we'.[48] It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with We the Living, Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.[49]\n\nThe Fountainhead and political activism [ edit ]\n\nDuring the 1940s, Rand became politically active. She and her husband worked as full-time volunteers for the 1940 presidential campaign of Republican Wendell Willkie. This work led to Rand's first public speaking experiences; she enjoyed fielding sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had viewed pro-Willkie newsreels.[50] This activity brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism. She became friends with journalist Henry Hazlitt and his wife, and Hazlitt introduced her to the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises. Despite her philosophical differences with them, Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career, and both of them expressed admiration for her. Mises once referred to Rand as \"the most courageous man in America\", a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said \"man\" instead of \"woman\".[51] Rand also became friends with libertarian writer Isabel Paterson. Rand questioned Paterson about American history and politics long into the night during their many meetings and gave Paterson ideas for her only non-fiction book, The God of the Machine.[52]\n\nRand's first major success as a writer came in 1943 with The Fountainhead, a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years.[53] The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as \"second-handers\"\u2014those who attempt to live through others, placing others above themselves. It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the Bobbs-Merrill Company on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it.[54] While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed the amphetamine Benzedrine to fight fatigue.[55] The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel, but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks' rest.[56] Her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings.[57]\n\nThe Fountainhead became a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security.[58] In 1943, Rand sold the rights for a film version to Warner Bros. and she returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay. Finishing her work on that screenplay, she was hired by producer Hal B. Wallis as a screenwriter and script-doctor. Her work for Wallis included the screenplays for the Oscar-nominated Love Letters and You Came Along.[59] Rand also worked on other projects, including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called The Moral Basis of Individualism. Although the planned book was never completed, a condensed version was published as an essay titled \"The Only Path to Tomorrow\" in the January 1944 edition of Reader's Digest magazine.[60]\n\nRand extended her involvement with free-market and anti-communist activism while working in Hollywood. She became involved with the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a Hollywood anti-Communist group, and wrote articles on the group's behalf. She also joined the anti-Communist American Writers Association.[61] A visit by Isabel Paterson to meet with Rand's California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Paterson made comments, which Rand considered rude, to valued political allies.[62] In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, Rand testified as a \"friendly witness\" before the United States House Un-American Activities Committee. Her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the Soviet Union and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film Song of Russia.[63] Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union, portraying life there as much better and happier than it actually was.[64] She wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film The Best Years of Our Lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world, but she was not allowed to testify about it.[65] When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations, Rand described the process as \"futile\".[66]\n\nAfter several delays, the film version of The Fountainhead was released in 1949. Although it used Rand's screenplay with minimal alterations, she \"disliked the movie from beginning to end\", and complained about its editing, acting, and other elements.[67]\n\nAtlas Shrugged and Objectivism [ edit ]\n\nAnthem was reprinted in the June 1953 issue of the pulp magazine Famous Fantastic Mysteries. Rand's novellawas reprinted in the June 1953 issue of the pulp magazine\n\nIn the years following the publication of The Fountainhead, Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom the book profoundly influenced. In 1951, Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her. This group (jokingly designated \"The Collective\") included future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later Nathaniel Branden) and his wife Barbara and Barbara's cousin Leonard Peikoff. Initially the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy. She later began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, Atlas Shrugged, as the manuscript pages were written. In 1954 Rand's close relationship with the younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.[68]\n\nAtlas Shrugged, published in 1957, was considered Rand's magnum opus.[69] Rand described the theme of the novel as \"the role of the mind in man's existence\u2014and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest\".[70] It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of Objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement. The plot involves a dystopian United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists, and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy. The novel's hero and leader of the strike, John Galt, describes the strike as \"stopping the motor of the world\" by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation's wealth and achievement. With this fictional strike, Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive, the economy would collapse and society would fall apart. The novel includes elements of mystery, romance, and science fiction,[71][72] and it contains an extended exposition of Objectivism in the form of a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt.[73]\n\nDespite many negative reviews, Atlas Shrugged became an international bestseller. In an interview with Mike Wallace, Rand declared herself \"the most creative thinker alive\".[74] However, Rand was discouraged and depressed by the reaction of intellectuals to the novel.[75] Atlas Shrugged was Rand's last completed work of fiction; it marked the end of her career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher.[76]\n\nIn 1958, Nathaniel Branden established Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), to promote Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that she edited. Rand later published some of these articles in book form. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, later described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the Objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion.[77] Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair, and some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers.[78] However, some former NBI students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated, and the problem was concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York.[79] Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students[80] and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.[81]\n\nLater years [ edit ]\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as Yale, Princeton, Columbia,[82] Harvard, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[83] She received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Lewis & Clark College on 2 October 1963.[84] She also began delivering annual lectures at the Ford Hall Forum, responding afterward to questions from the audience.[85] During these speeches and Q&A sessions, she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day. These included supporting abortion rights,[86] opposing the Vietnam War and the military draft (but condemning many draft dodgers as \"bums\"),[87] supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations as \"civilized men fighting savages\",[88] saying European colonists had the right to develop land taken from American Indians,[89] and calling homosexuality \"immoral\" and \"disgusting\", while also advocating the repeal of all laws about it.[90] She also endorsed several Republican candidates for President of the United States, most strongly Barry Goldwater in 1964, whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for The Objectivist Newsletter.[91]\n\nIn 1964, Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott, whom he later married. Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand. When she learned of it in 1968, though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended,[92] Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens, which led to the closure of NBI.[93] Rand published an article in The Objectivist repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other \"irrational behavior in his private life\".[94] Branden later apologized in an interview to \"every student of Objectivism\" for \"perpetuating the Ayn Rand mystique\" and for \"contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the Objectivist movement\".[95] In subsequent years, Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company.[96]\n\nRand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking.[97] In 1976, she retired from writing her newsletter and, despite her initial objections, she allowed social worker Evva Pryor, an employee of her attorney, to enroll her in Social Security and Medicare.[98][99] During the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined, especially after the death of her husband on November 9, 1979.[100] One of her final projects was work on a never-completed television adaptation of Atlas Shrugged.[101]\n\nRand died of heart failure on March 6, 1982, at her home in New York City,[102] and was interred in the Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, New York.[103] Rand's funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers, including Alan Greenspan. A 6-foot (1.8 m) floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket.[104] In her will, Rand named Leonard Peikoff to inherit her estate.[105]\n\nPhilosophy [ edit ]\n\nRand called her philosophy \"Objectivism\", describing its essence as \"the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute\".[106] She considered Objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics.[107]\n\nIn metaphysics, Rand supported philosophical realism, and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism, including all forms of religion.[108]\n\nIn epistemology, she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception, the validity of which she considered axiomatic,[109] and reason, which she described as \"the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses\".[110] She rejected all claims of non-perceptual or a priori knowledge, including \"'instinct,' 'intuition,' 'revelation,' or any form of 'just knowing'\".[111] In her Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, Rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic\u2013synthetic dichotomy.[112]\n\nIn ethics, Rand argued for rational and ethical egoism (rational self-interest), as the guiding moral principle. She said the individual should \"exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself\".[113] She referred to egoism as \"the virtue of selfishness\" in her book of that title,[114] in which she presented her solution to the is-ought problem by describing a meta-ethical theory that based morality in the needs of \"man's survival qua man\".[115] She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness,[9] and held that the initiation of force was evil and irrational, writing in Atlas Shrugged that \"Force and mind are opposites.\"[116]\n\nRand's political philosophy emphasized individual rights (including property rights),[117] and she considered laissez-faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights.[4] She opposed statism, which she understood to include theocracy, absolute monarchy, Nazism, fascism, communism, democratic socialism, and dictatorship.[118] Rand believed that natural rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government.[119] Although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian, she preferred the term \"radical for capitalism\". She worked with conservatives on political projects, but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics.[120] She denounced libertarianism, which she associated with anarchism.[121] She rejected anarchism as a na\u00efve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice.[122]\n\nIn aesthetics, Rand defined art as a \"selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments\". According to her, art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped, thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness.[123] As a writer, the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature, where she considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will.[124] She described her own approach to literature as \"romantic realism\".[125]\n\nRand acknowledged Aristotle as her greatest influence[126] and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend \"three A's\"\u2014Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayn Rand.[127] In a 1959 interview with Mike Wallace, when asked where her philosophy came from she responded: \"Out of my own mind, with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle, the only philosopher who ever influenced me. I devised the rest of my philosophy myself.\"[128] However, she also found early inspiration in Friedrich Nietzsche,[129] and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rand's journals,[130] in passages from the first edition of We the Living (which Rand later revised),[131] and in her overall writing style.[132] However, by the time she wrote The Fountainhead, Rand had turned against Nietzsche's ideas,[133] and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed.[134] Rational egoism was embodied by Russian author Nikolay Chernyshevsky in the 1863 novel What Is to Be Done?[135] and several critics[136] claim that What Is to Be Done? is one of the sources of inspiration for Rand's thought. For example, the book's main character Lopuhov says \"I am not a man to make sacrifices. And indeed there are no such things. One acts in the way that one finds most pleasant.\"[137] Among the philosophers Rand held in particular disdain was Immanuel Kant, whom she referred to as a \"monster\",[138] although philosophers George Walsh[139] and Fred Seddon[140] have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences.\n\nRand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her \"theory of concepts, [her] ethics, and [her] discovery in politics that evil\u2014the violation of rights\u2014consists of the initiation of force\".[141] She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy,[142] stating: \"I am not primarily an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am not primarily an advocate of egoism, but of reason. If one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently, all the rest follows.\"[143]\n\nReception and legacy [ edit ]\n\nCritical reception [ edit ]\n\nDuring Rand's lifetime, her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation. Rand's first novel, We the Living, was admired by the literary critic H. L. Mencken,[144] her Broadway play Night of January 16th was both a critical and popular success,[145] and The Fountainhead was hailed by The New York Times reviewer Lorine Pruette as \"masterful\".[146] Rand's novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic.[6] However, they became bestsellers largely through word of mouth.[147]\n\nThe first reviews Rand received were for Night of January 16th. Reviews of the production were largely positive, but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer.[145] Rand believed that her first novel, We the Living, was not widely reviewed, but Rand scholar Michael S. Berliner says \"it was the most reviewed of any of her works\", with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications. Overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work.[148] Her 1938 novella Anthem received little attention from reviewers, both for its first publication in England and for subsequent re-issues.[149]\n\nRand's first bestseller, The Fountainhead, received far fewer reviews than We the Living, and reviewers' opinions were mixed.[150] Lorine Pruette's positive review in The New York Times was one that Rand greatly appreciated.[151] Pruette called Rand \"a writer of great power\" who wrote \"brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly\", and stated that \"you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time\".[146] There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications.[150] Some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel,[6] such as one that called it \"a whale of a book\" and another that said \"anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing\". Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style \"offensively pedestrian\".[150]\n\nRand's 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative.[6][152] In National Review, conservative author Whittaker Chambers called the book \"sophomoric\" and \"remarkably silly\". He described the tone of the book as \"shrillness without reprieve\" and accused Rand of supporting a godless system (which he related to that of the Soviets), claiming \"From almost any page of Atlas Shrugged, a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: 'To a gas chamber\u2014go!'\".[153] Atlas Shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications, including praise from the noted book reviewer John Chamberlain,[152] but Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein later wrote that \"reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put-downs\", calling it \"execrable claptrap\" and \"a nightmare\"\u2014they also said it was \"written out of hate\" and showed \"remorseless hectoring and prolixity\".[6]\n\nRand's nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had. The tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book, For the New Intellectual, was similar to that for Atlas Shrugged,[154][155] with philosopher Sidney Hook likening her certainty to \"the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union\",[156] and author Gore Vidal calling her viewpoint \"nearly perfect in its immorality\".[157] Her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers.[154]\n\nOn the 100th anniversary of Rand's birth in 2005, Edward Rothstein, writing for The New York Times, referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian \"retro fantasy\" and programmatic neo-Romanticism of the misunderstood artist while criticizing her characters' \"isolated rejection of democratic society\".[158] In 2007, book critic Leslie Clark described her fiction as \"romance novels with a patina of pseudo-philosophy\".[159] In 2009, GQ's critic columnist Tom Carson described her books as \"capitalism's version of middlebrow religious novels\" such as Ben-Hur and the Left Behind series.[160]\n\nPopular interest [ edit ]\n\nIn 1991, a survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the Book-of-the-Month Club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondent's life was. Rand's Atlas Shrugged was the second most popular choice, after the Bible.[161] Rand's books continue to be widely sold and read, with over 29 million copies sold as of 2013 (with about 10% of that total purchased for free distribution to schools by the Ayn Rand Institute).[162] In 1998, Modern Library readers voted Atlas Shrugged the 20th century's finest work of fiction, followed by The Fountainhead in second place, Anthem in seventh, and We the Living eighth; none of the four appeared on the critics' list.[163] Although Rand's influence has been greatest in the United States, there has been international interest in her work.[7][164] Rand's work continues to be among the top sellers among books in India.[165]\n\nRand's contemporary admirers included fellow novelists, such as Ira Levin, Kay Nolte Smith and L. Neil Smith; and later writers such as Erika Holzer and Terry Goodkind have been influenced by her.[166] Other artists who have cited Rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist Steve Ditko[167] and musician Neil Peart of Rush.[168] Rand provided a positive view of business and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work.[169] John Allison of BB&T and Ed Snider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rand's ideas,[170] while Mark Cuban (owner of the Dallas Mavericks) as well as John P. Mackey (CEO of Whole Foods) among others have said they consider Rand crucial to their success.[171]\n\nRand and her works have been referred to in a variety of media: on television shows including animated sitcoms, live-action comedies, dramas, and game shows,[172] as well as in movies and video games.[173] She, or a character based on her, figures prominently (in positive and negative lights) in literary and science fiction novels by prominent American authors.[174] Nick Gillespie, editor in chief of Reason, has remarked that \"Rand's is a tortured immortality, one in which she's as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist...\" and that \"jibes at Rand as cold and inhuman, run through the popular culture\".[175] Two movies have been made about Rand's life. A 1997 documentary film, Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.[176] The Passion of Ayn Rand, a 1999 television adaptation of the book of the same name, won several awards.[177] Rand's image also appears on a 1999 U.S. postage stamp illustrated by artist Nick Gaetano.[178]\n\nPolitical influence [ edit ]\n\nAlthough she rejected the labels \"conservative\" and \"libertarian\",[179] Rand has had continuing influence on right-wing politics and libertarianism.[11] Jim Powell, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, considers Rand one of the three most important women (along with Rose Wilder Lane and Isabel Paterson) of modern American libertarianism,[180] and David Nolan, one of the founders of the Libertarian Party, stated that \"without Ayn Rand, the libertarian movement would not exist\".[181] In his history of the libertarian movement, journalist Brian Doherty described her as \"the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large\"[161] and biographer Jennifer Burns referred to her as \"the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right\".[182] Economist and Ayn Rand student George Reisman wrote: \"Ayn Rand...in particular, must be cited as providing a philosophical foundation for the case of capitalism, and as being responsible probably more than anyone else for the current spread of pro-capitalist ideas.\"[183]\n\nShe faced intense opposition from William F. Buckley, Jr. and other contributors for the National Review magazine. They published numerous criticisms in the 1950s and 1960s by Whittaker Chambers, Garry Wills, and M. Stanton Evans. Nevertheless, her influence among conservatives forced Buckley and other National Review contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and Christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism.[184]\n\nThe political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives (often members of the Republican Party),[185] despite Rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives, such as being pro-choice and an atheist.[186] A 1987 article in The New York Times referred to her as the Reagan administration's \"novelist laureate\".[187] Republican Congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her novels.[188]\n\nThe financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 spurred renewed interest in her works, especially Atlas Shrugged, which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis.[189] Opinion articles compared real-world events with the plot of the novel.[190] During this time, signs mentioning Rand and her fictional hero John Galt appeared at Tea Party protests.[191] There was also increased criticism of her ideas, especially from the political left, with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets, particularly through her influence on Alan Greenspan.[192] For example, Mother Jones remarked that \"Rand's particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy, the talented, and the powerful as the oppressed\"[186] while equating Randian individual well-being with that of the Volk according to Goebbels. Corey Robin of The Nation alleged similarities between the \"moral syntax of Randianism\" and fascism.[193]\n\nAcademic reaction [ edit ]\n\nDuring Rand's lifetime, her work received little attention from academic scholars.[10] When the first academic book about Rand's philosophy appeared in 1971, its author declared writing about Rand \"a treacherous undertaking\" that could lead to \"guilt by association\" for taking her seriously.[194] A few articles about Rand's ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982, many of them in The Personalist.[195] One of these was \"On the Randian Argument\" by libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick, who argued that her meta-ethical argument is unsound and fails to solve the is\u2013ought problem posed by David Hume.[196] Some responses to Nozick by other academic philosophers were also published in The Personalist arguing that Nozick misstated Rand's case.[195] Academic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited. Academic Mimi Gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about Rand's novels when she began researching her in 1973, and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s.[197]\n\nSince Rand's death, interest in her work has gradually increased.[198] Historian Jennifer Burns has identified \"three overlapping waves\" of scholarly interest in Rand, the most recent of which is \"an explosion of scholarship\" since the year 2000.[199] However, few universities currently include Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area, with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study.[200]\n\nGladstein, Harry Binswanger, Allan Gotthelf, John Hospers, Edwin A. Locke, Wallace Matson, Leonard Peikoff, Chris Matthew Sciabarra, and Tara Smith have taught her work in academic institutions. Sciabarra co-edits the Journal of Ayn Rand Studies, a nonpartisan peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the study of Rand's philosophical and literary work.[201] In 1987 Gotthelf, George Walsh and David Kelley co-founded the Ayn Rand Society, a group affiliated with the American Philosophical Association.[202] In 2012, the University of Pittsburgh Press launched an \"Ayn Rand Society Philosophical Studies\" series based on the proceedings of the Society.[203] Smith has written several academic books and papers on Rand's ideas, including Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist, a volume on Rand's ethical theory published by Cambridge University Press. Rand's ideas have also been made subjects of study at Clemson and Duke universities.[204] Scholars of English and American literature have largely ignored her work,[205] although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s.[206]\n\nRand scholars Douglas Den Uyl and Douglas B. Rasmussen, while stressing the importance and originality of her thought, describe her style as \"literary, hyperbolic and emotional\".[207] Philosopher Jack Wheeler says that despite \"the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage\", Rand's ethics are \"a most immense achievement, the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought\".[208] In the Literary Encyclopedia entry for Rand written in 2001, John David Lewis declared that \"Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation\".[209] In a 1999 interview in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Sciabarra commented, \"I know they laugh at Rand\", while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community.[210]\n\nLibertarian philosopher Michael Huemer argues that very few people find Rand's ideas convincing, especially her ethics,[211] which he believes are difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence.[212] He attributes the attention she receives to her being a \"compelling writer\", especially as a novelist. Atlas Shrugged thus outsells Rand's non-fiction works as well as the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism such as Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, or Frederic Bastiat.[211]\n\nPolitical scientist Charles Murray, while praising Rand's literary accomplishments, criticizes her claim that her only \"philosophical debt\" was to Aristotle, instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche.[213] Although Rand maintained that Objectivism was an integrated philosophical system, philosopher Robert H. Bass argues that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas.[214]\n\nObjectivist movement [ edit ]\n\nIn 1985, Rand's intellectual heir Leonard Peikoff established the Ayn Rand Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rand's ideas and works. In 1990, after an ideological disagreement with Peikoff, philosopher David Kelley founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies, now known as The Atlas Society.[215] In 2001, historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia.[216] The charitable foundation of BB&T Corporation has also given grants for teaching Rand's ideas or works. The University of Texas at Austin, the University of Pittsburgh, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are among the schools that have received grants. In some cases, these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to Rand.[217]\n\nSelected works [ edit ]\n\nNovels:\n\nOther fiction:\n\nNon-fiction:\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0438\u0301\u0441\u0430 \u0417\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0301\u0432\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0431\u0430\u0301\u0443\u043c ^ Ayn was Finnish,[29] but some biographical sources question this, suggesting it may come from a Hebrew nickname.[30] Rand said the origin ofwas Finnish,but some biographical sources question this, suggesting it may come from a Hebrew nickname.\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nWorks cited [ edit ]"}, {"url": "http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-works/nonfiction.html", "page_content": "Home Search Search\n\nAyn Rand\u2019s Nonfiction\n\nAyn Rand\u2019s lifelong passion for philosophy was rooted in her conviction that philosophy is the most practical force in human life. In her novels, we see the power of fundamental ideas in animating men\u2019s lives; the right ideas give rise to the achievements and exalted happiness of her heroes, while the wrong ideas make possible her despicable villains and the destruction they bring about.\n\nAfter Atlas Shrugged , Ayn Rand turned to nonfiction, both to elaborate on the philosophy set forth in her novels, and to use her philosophy, which she named Objectivism, to explain and fight the decaying culture around her. From 1962 until 1976, she published and wrote for three successive periodicals: The Objectivist Newsletter , The Objectivist , and The Ayn Rand Letter . Many of her works in these publications were collected into anthologies. Ayn Rand\u2019s essays bring new clarity to a vast array of cultural and political problems, by identifying the fundamental ideas that are their deepest causes and that must be rejected and replaced if the culture is to be changed for the better.\n\nAlthough the events she discusses occurred decades ago, the value of her essays remains as great as ever, thanks to her penetrating analyses and her timeless observations about politics, sex, economics, history, psychology and philosophy. Additionally, many of the topics she wrote about remain part of today\u2019s cultural debate: from religion to environmentalism to sex to racism to liberalism to abortion to war to conservatism.\n\nAfter Ayn Rand\u2019s death, scholars (with the assistance of her Estate) have compiled collections of her unpublished work, in which she covered many issues that she did not in her formal essays\u2014including analyses of her own novels, elaborations on her theory of knowledge, and notes on psychology. Her posthumous works include her private intellectual journals, a series of lectures on writing fiction and a series on writing nonfiction , her correspondence with fans, friends, and colleagues, and her answers to questions at public speaking events.\n\nIn Ayn Rand\u2019s nonfiction we find an indispensable guide to thought and action, and a source of solutions to today\u2019s political and cultural problems.\n\nBooks and Periodicals Published During Ayn Rand\u2019s Life\n\nBooks Published Posthumously"}, {"url": "http://awardsandwinners.com/winner/?mid=/m/0h25", "page_content": "Quotes\n\nI am leaving it as I found it.

Hayek (Editor); Milton Friedman (Introduction by)\n\nA classic work in political philosophy, intellectual and cultural history, and economics, The Road to Serfdom has inspired and infuriated politicians, scholars, and general readers for half a century. Originally published in England in the spring of 1944\u2014when Eleanor Roosevelt supported the efforts of Stalin, and Albert Einstein subscribed lock, stock, and barrel to the socialist program\u2014The Road to Serfdom was seen as heretical for its passionate warning against the dangers of state control over the means of production. For F. A. Hayek, the collectivist idea of empowering government with increasing economic control would inevitably lead not to a utopia but to the horrors of nazi Germany and fascist Italy. First published by the University of Chicago Press on September 18, 1944, The Road to Serfdom garnered immediate attention from the public, politicians, and scholars alike. The first printing of 2,000 copies was exhausted instantly, and within six months more than 30,000 were sold. In April of 1945, Reader's Digest published a condensed version of the book, and soon thereafter the Book-of-the-Month Club distributed this condensation to more than 600,000 readers. A perennial best-seller, the book has sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States, not including the British edition or the nearly twenty translations into such languages as German, French, Dutch, Swedish, and Japanese, and not to mention the many underground editions produced in Eastern Europe before the fall of the iron curtain. After thirty-two printings in the United States, The Road to Serfdom has established itself alongside the works of Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, and George Orwell for its timeless meditation on the relation between individual liberty and government authority. This fiftieth anniversary edition, with a new introduction by Milton Friedman, commemorates the enduring influence of The Road to Serfdom on the ever-changing political and social climates of the twentieth century, from the rise of socialism after World War II to the Reagan and Thatcher \"revolutions\" in the 1980s and the transitions in Eastern Europe from communism to capitalism in the 1990s. F. A. Hayek (1899-1992), recipient of the Medal of Freedom in 1991 and co-winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1974, was a pioneer in monetary theory and the principal proponent of libertarianism in the twentieth century. On the first American edition of The Road to Serfdom: \"One of the most important books of our generation. . . . It restates for our time the issue between liberty and authority with the power and rigor of reasoning with which John Stuart Mill stated the issue for his own generation in his great essay On Liberty. . . . It is an arresting call to all well-intentioned planners and socialists, to all those who are sincere democrats and liberals at heart to stop, look and listen.\"\u2014Henry Hazlitt, New York Times Book Review, September 1944 \"In the negative part of Professor Hayek's thesis there is a great deal of truth.

Ayn Rand was a Russian-born American author and philosopher. Rand authored two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged (1957). Her novels were especially influential among conservatives and libertarians from the mid-20th century. Where is Ayn Rand from? Ayn Rand was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, on February 2, 1905. When the tsarist regime was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, her family moved to Crimea, where she finished high school. She returned to Russia in 1921 and then moved to the United States in 1926. What is Ayn Rand\u2019s real name? Ayn Rand is the pen name of Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum. She adopted it when she moved to the United States in 1926. The first name, which rhymes with \u201cpine,\u201d was inspired by the name of a Finnish writer (whom she declined to identify), and the surname she described as an abbreviation of Rosenbaum. When did Ayn Rand begin writing? Ayn Rand arrived in Chicago in 1926 and then moved to Hollywood, where she met American filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille. Her chance encounter with DeMille led to work as a movie extra and eventually to a job as a screenwriter. Rand sold her first screenplay, Red Pawn, to Universal Studios in 1932. What are Ayn Rand\u2019s most famous works? Rand\u2019s first major work, The Fountainhead, was published in 1943. It details the struggle of a genius architect against mediocrity. Her second major work, Atlas Shrugged, was published in 1957. It follows a railroad executive and a steel magnate as they grapple with a collectivist government. Both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged explicate Rand\u2019s personal philosophy of objectivism. How did Ayn Rand die? Rand died of heart failure on March 6, 1982, in New York City. At the time, she had been working on a television adaptation of her novel Atlas Shrugged.\n\nAyn Rand, original name Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum, (born February 2, 1905, St. Petersburg, Russia\u2014died March 6, 1982, New York, New York, U.S.), Russian-born American writer whose commercially successful novels promoting individualism and laissez-faire capitalism were influential among conservatives and libertarians and popular among generations of young people in the United States from the mid-20th century.\n\nEarly life and career Her father, Zinovy Rosenbaum, was a prosperous pharmacist. After being tutored at home, Alissa Rosenbaum, the eldest of three children, was enrolled in a progressive school, where she excelled academically but was socially isolated. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, her father\u2019s shop was confiscated by communist authorities, an event she deeply resented. As a student at Leningrad State University, she studied history and became acquainted with the works of Plato and Aristotle. After graduating in 1924, she enrolled in the State Institute for Cinematography, hoping to become a screenwriter. The arrival of a letter from cousins in Chicago gave her an opportunity to leave the country on the pretext of gaining expertise that she could apply in the Soviet film industry. Upon her arrival in the United States in 1926, she changed her name to Ayn Rand. (The first name, which rhymes with \u201cpine,\u201d was inspired by the name of a Finnish writer, whom she never identified, and the surname she described as an abbreviation of Rosenbaum.) After six months in Chicago she moved to Hollywood, where a fortuitous encounter with the producer Cecil B. DeMille led to work as a movie extra and eventually to a job as a screenwriter. In 1929 she married the actor Frank O\u2019Connor. Soon hired as a filing clerk in the wardrobe department of RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., she rose to head of the department within a year, meanwhile writing stories, plays, and film scenarios in her spare time.

Early in her career she also wrote short stories, plays, and screenplays. Rand\u2019s first and most autobiographical novel, We the Living (1936), set in the Soviet Union, was published only after many rejections, owing to widespread sympathy for the Soviet \u201cexperiment\u201d among the intellectuals of the day. We the Living was quickly followed by the dystopian novel, Anthem (1938), written as \u201ca kind of rest\u201d from work on her next major novel, The Fountainhead (1943). The Fountainhead, also published after many rejections because of its individualism, and largely panned by critics, soon became a best-seller by word of mouth. The Fountainhead brought Rand international fame, and Atlas Shrugged (1957) sealed this fame. By 1958, Rand\u2019s novels, increasingly philosophical, had won her ideas a sufficiently devoted following for her to form, in association with psychologist Nathaniel Branden (with whom she later broke), an official \u201cObjectivist\u201d philosophical movement, complete with journals and lecture courses. For all her popularity, however, only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously. As a result, most of the serious philosophical work on Rand has appeared in non-academic, non-peer-reviewed journals, or in books, and the bibliography reflects this fact. We discuss the main reasons for her rejection by most professional philosophers in the first section. Our discussion of Rand\u2019s philosophical views, especially her moral-political views, draws from both her non-fiction and her fiction, since her views cannot be accurately interpreted or evaluated without doing so.\n\n1. Introduction\n\n1.1 Ayn Rand and Philosophy\n\nIn Rand\u2019s own words, her first and greatest love, her \u201clife purpose\u201d, was \u201cthe creation of the kind of world \u2026 that represents human perfection\u201d, while her interest in philosophical knowledge was \u201conly\u201d for the sake of this purpose (Journal entry for 4 May 1946; in 1997: 479).[1] Nevertheless, her interest in philosophical knowledge continued long after she had created this world in her magnum opus, Atlas Shrugged, her last work of fiction. In her non-fiction, Rand developed a conception of metaphysical realism, rationality, ethical egoism (rational self-interest), individual rights, laissez-faire capitalism, and art, and applied her philosophy to social issues. She wrote polemical, philosophical essays, often in response to questions by fans of Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead; lectured on college campuses; and gave radio and television interviews. In her own words, her philosophy,\n\nin essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute. (Rand 1957 [1992]: Afterword)\n\nCapitalism, \u201cthe unknown ideal\u201d, is for her the only political-economic system compatible with this philosophy because it is the only system based on respect for human beings as ends in themselves. The free-market libertarian political movement, though largely disowned by Rand, drew\u2014and draws\u2014great inspiration from her moral defense of the minimal state, that is, the state whose only raison d\u2019\u00eatre is protection of individual rights.\n\nWhereas Rand\u2019s ideas and mode of presentation make Rand popular with many non-academics, they lead to the opposite outcome with academics. She developed some of her views in response to questions from her readers, but seldom took the time to defend them against possible objections or to reconcile them with the views expressed in her novels. Her philosophical essays lack the self-critical, detailed style of analytic philosophy, or any serious attempt to consider possible objections to her views. Her polemical style, often contemptuous tone, and the dogmatism and cult-like behavior of many of her fans also suggest that her work is not worth taking seriously.[2] Further, understanding her views requires reading her fiction, but her fiction is not to everyone\u2019s taste. It does not help that she often dismisses other philosophers\u2019 views on the basis of cursory readings and conversations with a few philosophers and with her young philosophy student acolytes. Some contemporary philosophers return the compliment by dismissing her work contemptuously on the basis of hearsay. Some who do read her work point out that her arguments too often do not support her conclusions. This estimate is shared even by many who find her conclusions and her criticisms of contemporary culture, morality, and politics original and insightful. It is not surprising, then, that she is either mentioned in passing, or not mentioned at all, in the entries that discuss current philosophical thought about virtue ethics, egoism, rights, libertarianism, or markets. (Readers may also find the entry on Nozick\u2019s political philosophy to be of interest.) We present specific criticisms of her arguments and claims below, in the relevant sections of this entry.\n\n1.2 Life and Work\n\nAyn Rand was born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum, to a bourgeois Jewish family in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 2 February 1905. A witness to the Russian Revolution and civil war, Rand opposed both the Communists and the Tsarists. She majored in history, but the social science program in which she was enrolled at Petrograd State University included philosophy, law, and philology. Her teachers emphasized\u2014as she herself later did\u2014the importance of developing systematic connections among different areas of thought (Sciabarra 2013). Rand\u2019s formal philosophical education included ancient philosophy (especially Plato and Aristotle), logic, philosophical psychology, Marxism-Leninism, and non-Marxist political thought. But she was evidently also exposed to Hegelian and Nietzschean ideas, which blossomed during this period (known as the Russian Silver Age), and read a great deal of Friedrich Nietzsche on her own. After graduating from Petrograd State University in 1924, an interest in screenwriting led her to enroll in the State Institute for Cinematography. On the literary side, she studied the great Russian novelists and poets, but fell in love with Victor Hugo, to whose influence she owes the \u201cRomantic Realism\u201d of her novels.\n\nIn 1925 Rand succeeded in obtaining permission to visit relatives in the United States; hating the Soviet system, she left with no intention of returning. After six months with relatives in Chicago, she made her way to Hollywood where, on her second day, a fortuitous encounter with Cecil B. DeMille led to a job as a script reader, and later as a screenplay writer. The next week she had another fortuitous encounter, this time with the actor Frank O\u2019Connor, whom she married in 1929. She was married to him till his death in 1979. She adopted the pen name Ayn Rand to (it is thought) protect her family back in Russia, although she also told the New York Evening Post in 1936 that \u201cRand\u201d was an abbreviation of her Russian surname.\n\nRand and her husband moved permanently to New York City in 1951, where she became involved with, and was influenced by, the circle of mostly New-York-based intellectuals involved in the revival of classical liberalism, such as the economic journalist Henry Hazlitt, the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, and the Canadian-American novelist, literary critic, and political philosopher Isabel Paterson. Rand also studied, and was a great admirer of, the Lockean philosophy of the American founding. Rand lived and worked in New York City until her death in 1982.\n\nRand holds that philosophy, like all forms of knowledge and achievement, is important only because it is necessary for living a good human life and creating a world conducive to living such a life. Philosophy supplies the most fundamental cognitive and normative abstractions which, respectively, identify and evaluate what is. Everyone, according to Rand, needs a philosophy and is guided by at least an implicit one (1982a: ch. 1). Her novels express her belief that if our philosophy is more or less correct, our lives will be more or less successful, if our philosophy is wildly off the mark, our lives will be disastrous. Philosophy thus has an urgent, practical importance. But unlike Marx, her philosophical and political antipode, Rand thinks that social change has to start with a moral revolution within each individual and the spread of the right ideas and ideals through rational discourse and the inspiration of art.\n\nRand\u2019s ideal human being appears, in varying degrees of development, in all her novels; her ideal world appears in Atlas Shrugged. Her novels feature striking, complex plots with subtle psychological explorations of her characters\u2019 emotions and thoughts, and philosophical reflections that rarely lose sight of the dramatic context. Like many famous Russian novelists, especially Dostoevsky, whom she recognized as a great psychologist, Rand also uses long speeches to lay out her philosophy, a device that has both its supporters and its detractors. She described Atlas Shrugged as a \u201cstunt novel\u201d and a murder mystery\u2014the murder of the human soul by a collectivist culture. By \u201csoul\u201d, however, she meant not an immortal substance that survives the death of the body\u2014she is not a dualist in any aspect of her philosophy\u2014but the mind, or the human spirit that celebrates life on this earth. She took a familiar phenomenon and literary trope\u2014a workers\u2019 strike\u2014and turned it on its head to show what happens when \u201cthe men of mind\u201d\u2014scientists, philosophers, industrialists, entrepreneurs, writers\u2014the \u201cprime movers\u201d of a society\u2014go on strike. It also purports to show how the wrong metaphysics can lead to the wrong ethics and thus to disastrous personal choices and a disastrous political and economic system, and how the right philosophy is needed for the rebirth of the soul and the rebuilding of the world. Her protagonists are not knights on white steeds rescuing damsels in distress, or swordsmen who can fight off a dozen enemies single-handed, but men and women in the mid-20th century industrial America of steel mills, skyscrapers, and glimmering highways: women who run transcontinental railroads and men who revolutionize architecture or (long before clean energy became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre) build a motor powered by static electricity to produce limitless, clean energy. Her novels show the importance of striving to be the best we can be:\n\nDo not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but never have been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible\u2026. (Atlas Shrugged, 1957 [1992]: 983).\n\nHer novels inspire readers because they present heroes of unbreached integrity, heroes who lead colorful and remarkable lives and succeed not in spite of, but because of, their uncompromising virtue. This estimate of their virtue is not, of course, shared by all: many readers find her characters wooden, her writing stilted, and her ethical and political views misguided.\n\nRand paid tribute to Aristotle, whom she considered the greatest of all philosophers, in the titles she gave to the three Parts of Atlas Shrugged (Non-Contradiction, Either-Or, A is A) and to one of the chapters (The Immovable Movers). While she differed sharply from Nietzsche on many issues, including rationality, free will, and individual rights, his influence is evident in her provocative, often aphoristic, point-counterpoint writing style, as well as in her \u201ctransvaluation\u201d of traditional values and her powerful affirmation of life and joy and the spirit of youth. In the Introduction to the 25th Anniversary edition of The Fountainhead, she stated that the novel\u2019s sense of life is best conveyed by a quotation from Nietzsche\u2019s Beyond Good and Evil: \u201cThe noble soul has reverence for itself\u201d. (For The Fountainhead\u2019s partly sympathetic and partly critical engagement with Nietzsche\u2019s ideas, see Hunt 2006.)\n\n1.3 Metaphysics and Epistemology\n\nFundamental to Rand\u2019s outlook\u2014so fundamental that she derives the name of her philosophical system, \u201cObjectivism\u201d, from it\u2014is a trichotomy among three categories: the intrinsic, the subjective, and the objective (ITOE: 52\u201354; Rand 1965: 13\u201323). An intrinsic phenomenon is one whose nature depends wholly on factors external to the mind; a subjective phenomenon is one whose nature depends wholly on the mind; and an objective phenomenon is defined, variously, as that which depends on the relation between a living entity\u2019s nature (including the nature of its mind) and its environment, or as that which depends on the relation between a properly functioning (rational) mind and extramental reality. Commentators are divided over the best way to interpret Rand\u2019s views on this issue.\n\nRand holds that there is a widespread tendency to ignore the third category or to assimilate it to the second, thus setting up a false dichotomy between the intrinsic and the subjective. On Rand\u2019s view, many of the fundamental questions of philosophy, from the existence of universals to the nature of value, involve fruitless debates over the false alternative \u201cintrinsic or subjective?\u201d in cases where the phenomenon in question is neither intrinsic nor subjective, but rather objective.\n\nIf ethics is the branch of philosophy concerned with practice, then in a sense all of Rand\u2019s philosophy is ethics, for Rand stresses \u201cthe supremacy of actual living over all other considerations\u201d, and insists that philosophy needs to be \u201cbrought up to the realm of actual living\u201d\u2014adding \u201cI say intentionally brought up to it, not down\u201d (Journal entry for 15 May 1934, p. 72; in Rand 1997: 73). Consequently, Rand regularly concerns herself with the practical implications and social relevance not only of moral and political philosophy, but likewise of the seemingly more arcane strata of metaphysics and epistemology\u2014as when she identifies errors in concept-formation as one of the roots of racism, or mind-body dualism as a root of the dichotomy between economic and personal freedom. This approach likewise reflects Rand\u2019s emphasis on integrating each piece of information into the total context of one\u2019s knowledge, and her consequent hostility to compartmentalization.\n\nRand\u2019s conviction of the vital practical importance of abstract theory may help to explain the passionately polemical nature of her philosophical writing (which some readers find inspiring and others hyperbolic and off-putting), although Nietzsche\u2019s influence, as well as the influence of her Marxist-Leninist education also probably play a role. Rand also tended\u2014perhaps owing in part to the same two influences\u2014to regard philosophical errors as revelatory of the psychological flaws of their authors.\n\nFor a more in-depth presentation of Rand\u2019s views on epistemology and metaphysics, please see the supplement on Epistemology and Metaphysics\n\n2. Ethics\n\n2.1 What is Ethics, and Why do we need It?\n\nEthics\n\nis a code of values to guide man\u2019s choices and actions\u2014the choices and actions that determine the purpose and the course of his life. (1961b: 13)\n\nBefore we can decide which code of values we should accept, we need to ask why we need a code of values at all. Rand claims that no philosopher before her has provided a scientific answer to this question, and so none has provided a satisfactory ethics.\n\nRand starts by describing value or \u201cthe good\u201d, in classical fashion, as the object of pursuit: \u201cthat which one acts to gain and/or keep\u201d (1961b: 16). Thus, the concept of value presupposes the concept of \u201can entity capable of acting to achieve a goal in the face of an alternative\u201d\u2014and the basic alternative facing any living entity is life or death (1961b: 16). It is the conditional nature of life that gives rise to values, not just human values, but values as such. As she puts it:\n\nMetaphysically, life is the only phenomenon that is an end in itself: a value gained and kept by a constant process of action. (1961b: 18)\n\nSurvival is the organism\u2019s ultimate value, the \u201cfinal goal or end to which all [its] lesser goals are the means\u201d, and the standard of all its other values: \u201cthat which furthers its life is the good, that which threatens it is the evil\u201d (pp. 16\u201317). The same, suitably modified, applies to human beings. Life is the standard and goal of all genuine human values, in the sense that all of them\u2014from food to philosophy to fine art to ethics\u2014must be explained and justified as requirements of human survival. \u201cEthics is an objective, metaphysical necessity of man\u2019s survival\u201d (p. 24). Thus,\n\n[t]he standard of value of the Objectivist ethics \u2026 is man\u2019s life, or: that which is required for man\u2019s survival qua man, (1961b: 25)\n\nthat is,\n\nthe terms, methods, conditions and goals required for the survival of a rational being through the whole of his lifespan\u2014in all those aspects of existence which are open to his choice. (1961b: 27)\n\nTo choose to live is to accept one\u2019s \u201cown life\u201d as one\u2019s \u201cethical purpose\u201d.\n\nRand\u2019s metaphysical arguments make three points central to her axiology and ethics. (1) All living entities have values, not only human beings, and only living entities have values: life necessitates value, and value depends on life. (2) An entity\u2019s values are determined by its objective life-needs, that is, by the requirements of survival for entities of its kind, and ethics is a requirement of human survival. (3) Thus, values are neither intrinsic properties of things, nor subjective, neither free-floating Platonic entities, nor mere matters of preference, time, or culture. Rather, values are relational or objective, dependent on the nature of the valuing entity and the nature of its environment.\n\nRand supports the first point by arguing that the concept of value entails the concept of life:\n\nepistemologically, the concept of \u201cvalue\u201d is genetically dependent upon and derived from the antecedent concept of \u201clife\u201d. (1961b: 18)\n\nShe asks the reader to\n\nimagine an immortal, indestructible robot, an entity which moves and acts, but which cannot be affected by anything, which cannot be changed in any respect, which cannot be damaged, injured or destroyed. (1961b: 16)\n\nSuch an entity, she concludes, cannot have values.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that all it shows is that an entity that cannot be destroyed or harmed cannot have values, and not that a non-living entity cannot have values. Unlike the robot of this example, real robots can be damaged or destroyed, by external as well as internal events. What it means for them to be damaged or destroyed is that they cannot perform their functions well, or at all. Hence they can, quite straightforwardly, be said to have values.[3] To take this into account, Rand would have to say that for an entity that has a function, values are determined by what it needs to function (well), and that the function of living beings is to survive (well). Hence she can still maintain that for living things, values are determined by its objective life-needs, hence that values are objective, and that ethics is a requirement of a proper human survival.\n\nRand\u2019s naturalism, and her rejection of intrinsicism and subjectivism in favor of objectivism, anticipate recent naturalisms and echo Aristotle\u2019s argument, against both the Platonist and the subjectivist, that \u201cthe good\u201d must always be good-for-something. Her conception of the function of morality is notable both for its affinity to, and its difference from, Thomas Hobbes\u2019 conception: like Hobbes, Rand sees morality as a necessary means to long-term survival, but unlike Hobbes, she does not see morality as requiring a contract or even as a fundamentally social affair. The need for morality, according to Rand, is dictated by our nature as creatures that must think and produce to survive; hence we would need morality even on a desert island. There is, however, no duty to survive; morality is based on a hypothetical imperative: if you choose to live, then you must value your own long-term survival as an ultimate end, and morality as a necessary means to it. If asked why the choice to live commits you to your own long-term survival rather than some other ultimate end (such as, for example, the greatest happiness of the greatest number (Nozick 1971), or becoming worthy of eternal life in heaven), the only answer is: because any other ultimate end, if consistently adhered to, would lead to death.\n\nRand\u2019s ethics is thus firmly teleological, this-worldly, and foundationalist. Virtue is \u201cthe act by which one gains/and or keeps\u201d values in light of a recognition of certain facts (1961b: 27, 28); it \u201cis not an end in itself \u2026 not its own reward\u201d (1957 [1992]: 939). A fact central to a \u201cscientific\u201d ethics is that reason is the chief indispensable human tool of survival, and we exercise reason by choice. Hence rationality is the fundamental moral virtue, a virtue implicated in all the other virtues, including productiveness (Section 2.4 below).\n\nRand is widely credited by Objectivists (Peikoff 1991; Binswanger 1990, 1992; Kelley & Thomas 1999\u2014see Other Internet Resources; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000, 2006) with having solved the is-ought problem by showing that morality is essential for long-term survival as a rational being, and so anyone who chooses to live ought to be moral (1961b: 19). But if the choice to live is itself a moral choice, in the sense that we ought to choose to live, then the argument proceeds from an ought to an ought, not from an is to an ought. On the other hand, if the choice to live is a non-moral choice (an idea that\u2019s hard to reconcile with Rand\u2019s general view that all significant choices are moral choices), then suicide can never be wrong, even if it is done for cowardly, irresponsible, or unjust reasons, a view that is obviously incoherent (King 1984 and Narveson 1998 criticize this and other aspects of Rand\u2019s moral views). Again, if morality is needed only for long-term survival, and choosing death is not immoral, then a suicide-bomber does no wrong in killing innocent people. But people don\u2019t lose their rights just because their killer has decided to kill himself. Darryl Wright seeks to save something of the commonsense view that the suicide-bomber acts wrongly by arguing that his choice to die without good reason \u201ccorresponds to a real defect or corruption\u201d in him (Wright 2011: 26\u201329). But this verdict contradicts the premise that choosing death is not immoral. For if the choice expresses a corruption in the character of the suicide-bomber, then the choice itself is immoral. Moreover, this response leaves untouched the most important criticism of the suicide-bomber\u2019s actions: that he violates other people\u2019s rights by using them as mere means to his own (wicked) ends.\n\nMore fundamentally, the very idea of morality resting on the choice to live is questionable (Long 2000, Badhwar 2001). Most of us rarely, if ever, make a choice to live: we live by default. By giving us desires for food and water, for pleasure and security, Nature gives us, as she gives other animals, the implicit desire to stay alive. Perhaps the most dramatic evidence is the existence of feral children, children who have managed to stay alive for years in the company of wild animals. When we grow up, the only time we seriously ask ourselves if we want to live or die is when living requires an effort on our part, such as in a grave illness, or deep depression, or emergency. But we start learning the difference between right and wrong (for example, don\u2019t hit others, don\u2019t grab their things, and so on) long before we ever consider whether to live or die. A deeper reflection on morality begins when we mature and start asking ourselves what constitutes happiness and a worthwhile life. But this is an inherently moral question to which the answers are inherently moral or immoral.\n\nLet let us now return to the question of how we should understand the relationship between long-term survival and survival as a rational being\u2014the life \u201cproper to a rational being\u201d (Rand 1961b: 27). Is a life proper to a rational being a necessary means, and only a necessary means, to literal, long-term survival? Or is such a life itself the ultimate goal, the kind of survival worth having? Again, what are we to make of the many passages in which Rand states that the ultimate goal is one\u2019s own happiness?\n\nSome of Rand\u2019s statements suggest that she had only one, consistent ethical view: the ultimate goal is the individual\u2019s own survival; the only way to survive long-term, i.e., over a complete life-span, is to live by the standard of man\u2019s life as a rational being, which means: to live morally; and happiness is the psychological \u201cresult, reward and concomitant\u201d (p. 32) of living thus. Many of Rand\u2019s commentators follow her in holding that there is only one consistent view, while disagreeing on the right interpretation of it (Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1978; Machan 1984, 2000; Peikoff 1991; Bidinotto 1994\u2014see Other Internet Resources; Hunt 1999; Kelley & Thomas 1999\u2014see Other Internet Resources; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000, 2006). Others (Mack 1984, 2003; Badhwar 1999, 2001; Long 2000) argue that Rand\u2019s writings actually allow of two, if not three, mutually incompatible views of the ultimate goal, and our task is to see which of these is the dominant or most plausible view. The three views are: survival, survival qua rational being, and happiness in the ancient Aristotelian sense of flourishing or eudaimonia. In the rest of Section 2, we will present the textual evidence for each of these views of the final goal, and the common objections to them, in turn.\n\nAll three views are, of course, egoist, in that the primary or sole intended beneficiary of morality is supposed to be the moral agent herself. But some of the criticisms usually levied at egoism lose some of their force when directed at the second and third views.\n\n2.2 Survival as the Ultimate Value\n\nThe survivalist view holds that just as literal survival is the ultimate value for other living entities, so it is for human beings (Kelley & Thomas 1999; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000). Survival is the source and final goal of all the actions of an entity, that which gives point to all its other values. For human beings, morality and happiness are both instrumental means to survival. The vicious can \u201cachieve their goals [only] for the range of a moment\u201d, as evidenced by \u201cany criminal or any dictatorship\u201d (1961b: 26).\n\n\u201cNon-survivalists\u201d make the following objections:\n\nThe biological premise that survival is the ultimate goal of all living things is mistaken. Animals of many species risk their own lives for the sake of reproduction, or for protecting their young or even their group. But even if survival were the ultimate goal of other species, it need not be ours. Even if our own survival needs were the source of all our values, it would not follow that survival must be the ultimate psychological and moral goal to which all our other values are merely necessary means. The genesis of x does not logically determine the ultimate goal of x. For example, the source of sexual desire is our reproductive capacity but, as Rand would agree, it doesn\u2019t follow that we ought to satisfy our sexual desires only if we want to reproduce. The survivalist view that turns happiness into a mere means to survival entails, quite implausibly, that a long, unhappy life is better than a somewhat shorter but happy life, and just as good as a long and happy one. Many dictators, including the Pharaohs of the past and the Stalins and Maos of the 20th century, have survived by making elaborate plans to preserve their lives and their power by using a combination of terror, myth, and bribery. Their gross injustice poses a far greater threat to the lives of their subordinates than to their own. Morality enhances the individual\u2019s chances of survival under normal circumstances, but it is not necessary for survival. And in some circumstances, such as in a dictatorship, acting morally decreases the individual\u2019s chances of survival, a point that Rand herself convincingly dramatizes in We the Living and Anthem. A survivalist ethics can support, at best, a bare-bones Hobbesian morality, not a virtue ethics. If Rand\u2019s virtues were necessary for survival, the human species would have perished a long time ago, instead of expanding exponentially. Her rich and challenging picture of human life and virtue in her novels points to a richer and more challenging conception of the final end than mere survival. Many of Rand\u2019s heroes, from Kira (We the Living) to Prometheus (Anthem) to John Galt (Atlas Shrugged), risk their lives for the sake of the values that make their lives worth living. Like Hobbes, Rand rightly points out that if everyone or most people were to start preying on each other, then no one would survive for long\u2014literally, and that generations of predators would end up destroying or driving away the producers, and thus destroying themselves (Anthem and Atlas Shrugged). But this doesn\u2019t show that a few predators in a society of producers cannot survive by predation. Indeed, Rand herself sometimes acknowledges that evil people can survive by free-riding (\u201chitch-hiking\u201d, as she calls it) on rational, productive people: If some men attempt to survive by means of brute force or fraud \u2026 it still remains true that their survival is made possible only by their victims, only by the men who choose to think and to produce the goods which they, the looters, are seizing. (1961b: 25) Rand often says that the final end is survival proper to a human being (1961b: 26), or that the final end is happiness (1961b: 27, 30). Neither can be reduced to survival simpliciter. In \u201cMan\u2019s Rights\u201d, Rand explains an individual\u2019s right to his own life as the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life. (1963b: 93 and 1967a: 321\u201322) \u201cLife\u201d here is explicated in terms of not only continued survival but also of fulfillment and enjoyment.\n\nFor all these reasons, a more plausible interpretation of Rand\u2019s view is that morality is required for surviving qua human being, that is, for living a life proper to a human being.\n\n2.3 Survival Qua Man as the Ultimate Value\n\nJust as the standard of value is survival qua human being, so the ultimate goal is one\u2019s own survival qua human being. To accept this standard and goal is to accept (i) the three cardinal values of reason, purpose (or purposiveness) and self-esteem as not only \u201cthe means to\u201d but also \u201cthe realization of one\u2019s ultimate value, one\u2019s own life\u201d (1961b: 27), and (ii) the three \u201ccorresponding virtues\u201d of rationality, productiveness, and pride. These values are means to one\u2019s life insofar as they further one\u2019s life as a rational being, and they realize it insofar as they express the value we place on our lives.\n\nWhat it means to value survival qua human being turns on the relationship of the three cardinal values to the three virtues. Rand often states that virtue is only a means to value. But when she explains how the three cardinal values \u201ccorrespond\u201d to their three virtues, she does not provide a means-end analysis (Badhwar 1999, 2001). Thus, she says:\n\nProductive work is the central purpose of a rational man\u2019s life, the central value that integrates and determines the hierarchy of all his other values. Reason is the source, the precondition of his productive work\u2014pride is the result. (1961b: 27)\n\nThe virtue of productiveness becomes the central example of purpose (one of the three cardinal values), reason (another cardinal value) becomes its source, and the virtue of pride becomes its result. Rand also defines rationality, which is \u201cthe basic virtue\u201d, in terms of\n\nthe recognition and acceptance of reason as one\u2019s only source of knowledge \u2026 and one\u2019s only guide to action. (1961b: 28)\n\nBy this definition, being rational means valuing reason in thought, word, and deed, and realizing reason in one\u2019s life means being rational: the virtue and the value entail each other.\n\nThis point generalizes to all the virtues and values. Further, since the (cardinal) values are both \u201cthe means to\u201d and \u201cthe realization of one\u2019s ultimate value\u201d (1961b: 27), it follows that the (cardinal) virtues are also both the means to and the realization of one\u2019s ultimate value: long-term survival qua human being. On this interpretation, to survive qua human being is none other than to lead a virtuous life in which one has realized one\u2019s potential.\n\nBoth survivalists and eudaimonists, however, point out that this conception of the final end contradicts Rand\u2019s oft-repeated claim that \u201cVirtue is not an end in itself.\u2026\u201d In addition, eudaimonists make the following objections:\n\nSince even a long, virtuous life need not be a happy one, positing it as the final end contradicts Rand\u2019s related claim that \u201cLife is the reward of virtue\u2014and happiness is the goal and reward of life\u201d (1957 [1992]: 939). It contradicts Rand\u2019s conception of the final end in her novels, where happiness is proclaimed as \u201cthe purpose, the sanction and the meaning of life\u201d (1957 [1992]: 674).\n\nIn addition, it is psychologically implausible to hold that we would choose mere survival as an end even if we were deeply unhappy and saw no happiness in our future (cf. Wright 2019 20).\n\nEudaimonists hold that the dominant and/or more plausible view expressed in Rand\u2019s writings is that happiness\u2014a happy life\u2014is the ultimate value, where a happy life is understood as a life of emotional fulfillment in worthwhile goals and activities. Happiness in this sense necessarily involves virtue, but is not identical with virtue (Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1978; Machan 1984, 2000; Mack 1984; Badhwar 1999, 2001; Hunt 1999; Long 2000).[4]\n\n2.4 Happiness as the Ultimate Value\n\nHappiness is the existentially and psychologically \u201csuccessful state of life\u201d (1961b: 27). As an emotion it is not simply a positive subjective state, as on some contemporary views, but an emotion that meets certain normative standards: \u201ca state of non-contradictory joy\u2014a joy without penalty or guilt\u201d, achievable only by\n\nthe man who desires nothing but rational goals, seeks nothing but rational values and finds his joy in nothing but rational actions. (1961b: 32)\n\nHappiness is also a form of life-affirmation:\n\nthe feeling of one\u2019s blessing upon the whole of the earth, the feeling of being in love with the fact that one exists and in this kind of world. (1957 [1992]: 105\u20136)\n\nThus, happiness is an emotionally positive state of mind in an objectively worthwhile state of life.\n\nRand holds that the pursuit of happiness is inseparable from the activity of maintaining one\u2019s life through the rational pursuit of rational goals (1961b: 29, 32). A virtuous life is, thus, essential to happiness. It is also a shield against soul-wracking unhappiness. Just as even great misfortunes don\u2019t throw Aristotle\u2019s virtuous individual into misery, they don\u2019t throw Rand\u2019s heroes into misery. Even at the worst of times, the virtuous individual\u2019s pain \u201conly goes down to a certain point\u201d (1943: 344), never touching the core of her being: the conviction that she is worthy and capable of happiness.[5]\n\nIn keeping with their richer conception of the final end, Rand\u2019s novels also employ a richer conception of virtue as an integrated intellectual-emotional character trait to think, feel, and act in certain ways, rather than simply as an act in light of a recognition of certain facts (Badhwar 1999, 2001). Her characters reveal their souls not only in what they say or do, notice or fail to notice, focus on or evade, on this or that occasion, but in their cognitive, emotional, and action dispositions, their style of being in the world. Their actions show not only an intellectual commitment to the right but a wholehearted \u201clove of rectitude\u201d (1957 [1992]: 512).\n\nThis basically Aristotelian view of virtue goes hand-in-hand with a basically Aristotelian view of emotions. Rand rejects the reason-emotion dichotomy as stemming, ultimately, from a false mind-body dichotomy. Emotions are neither raw feelings nor inherently irrational but, rather, automatized value-judgments:\n\nestimates of that which furthers man\u2019s values or threatens them \u2026 lightning calculators giving him the sum of his profit or loss. (1961b: 27)\n\nEmotions provide instant guidance when circumstances do not permit reasoning everything out anew. But our emotions are only as good as our reason, because they are \u201cprogrammed\u201d by our reason. Hence they can only be corrected by conscious reasoning, and in a conflict between reason and emotions, one must always side with the former.[6]\n\nEudaimonists argue that Rand\u2019s vision of a virtuous and happy life in her novels can be understood only as a form of eudaimonism, even if she sometimes makes statements inconsistent with this vision. The chief objection to eudaimonism is that, by defining a happy life partly in terms of virtue, it employs an unconvincing conception of happiness. The philosophical literature on happiness in this sense (usually called well-being) makes and answers this and other such objections (Annas 1993, Haybron 2008, Badhwar 2014).\n\n2.5 Virtues, Vices, and Egoism\n\nThe chief Objectivist virtues are rationality, integrity, honesty (with self and others), justice, independence, productiveness, and pride. Rationality,\n\none\u2019s total commitment \u2026 to the maintenance of a full mental focus in all issues, in all choices \u2026 to the fullest perception of reality within one\u2019s power, (1961b: 28)\n\nis the basic virtue of which the other virtues are aspects or derivatives. The virtues are thus united or reciprocal. Each virtue is defined partly in terms of a recognition of, and appropriate responsiveness to, some important fact or facts, a recognition and responsiveness understood by the agent to be indispensable for gaining, maintaining, or expressing her ultimate value. For example, integrity is \u201cthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake your consciousness\u201d (1957 [1992]: 936), a recognition that is expressed in loyalty to one\u2019s rational values and convictions, especially in the face of social pressures to surrender them (1961b: 28; 1964a: 52, 80); honesty is \u201cthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake existence\u201d, a recognition that is expressed in truthfulness in thought and speech (1957 [1992]: 936\u201337); and justice is\n\nthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake the character of men as you cannot fake the character of nature, \u2026 that every man must be judged for what he is and treated accordingly\u2026. (1957 [1992]: 937)\n\nConspicuous by their absence from Rand\u2019s list of the cardinal virtues are the \u201cvirtues of benevolence\u201d, such as kindness, charity, generosity, and forgiveness. Rand states that charity is not a major virtue or moral duty (1964b); likewise, presumably, kindness, generosity, and forgiveness. Whether, and how much, one should help others depends on their place in one\u2019s rationally defined hierarchy of values, and on the particular circumstances (whether they are worthy of help, what the likely consequences are of helping them, and so on). The greater their value vis-\u00e0-vis one\u2019s rational self-interest, the greater the help that one should be willing to give, ceteris paribus. What is never morally appropriate is to make a sacrifice, that is, to surrender something of value to oneself for the sake of something of less or no value to oneself. Thus, it can never be moral to knowingly risk one\u2019s life for a stranger (unless, of course, one\u2019s life is no longer worth living) or to court unhappiness for the happiness of another, whether stranger or friend. It is appropriate to help a stranger only in an emergency, and only when the risk to our own life or well-being is minimal (1963c: 43\u201345). This should not be taken to imply that helping a stranger is always morally optional, regardless of the circumstances. Indeed, people who are \u201ctotally indifferent to anything living and would not lift a finger to help a man or a dog left mangled by a hit-and-run driver\u201d are \u201cpsychopaths\u201d (1963c: 43\u201345) Rand makes even more concessions to \u201ccommon sense morality\u201d when she states that it\u2019s good to help a neighbor going through a hard time till he can get back on his own feet, if we can afford to and if we have no reason to think that he is undeserving. Charity understood thus is a virtue because it is an expression of the generalized good will and respect that all normal people have towards others as creatures who share with them the capacity to value (1963c: 46\u201347). Nathaniel Branden tries to reconcile charity with egoism by declaring that the former stems from a species-identification with another, such that, in revering others, people \u201care revering their own life\u201d. By acting charitably, people actualize this sense of kinship, without sacrificing their own well-being.\n\nThis last is true, but the desire to reduce all proper motivations to egoistic motivations leads Branden (and Rand and many Objectivists) to ignore the fact that charity is first and foremost profoundly other-regarding, prompted by another\u2019s plight rather than concern for one\u2019s own self-actualization. The same is true of trying to rescue a dog mangled by a hit-and-run driver, where the egoistic motivation must be even weaker, since here there is no species-identification, but rather only a \u201cgenus-identification\u201d with another sufferer.\n\nThe problem with Rand and Branden\u2019s ethical egoism can be sharpened by asking why we should not harm others, for example, by spitefully stepping on their gouty toes. Rand and Branden\u2019s answer has to be: because doing so will harm us. But why will it harm us? Because we have unjustly and irrationally hurt another out of spite, and injustice and irrationality are bad for us. But our action wouldn\u2019t be unjust and irrational if it didn\u2019t hurt them \u2013 if, in fact, stepping on their toes cured their gout and we did it for that reason. Clearly, then, the wrongness of our action and motivation depends, in the first instance, on what we know it will do to our victims. This is why we ought to apologize to them, and not to ourselves. It\u2019s right and important to consider the effect on ourselves of being spiteful, unjust, and irrational, but there is no good argument for the view that we ought to be just to others only or primarily because it is good for us. All other-regarding virtues are responses to other people\u2019s moral standing.\n\nAt any rate, the argument from identification can also be used to justify charity towards strangers in non-emergency situations, for example, towards those who are permanently disabled and unable to care for themselves (Badhwar forthcoming). Rand concedes as much in \u201cWhat is Capitalism?\u201d (1965) where she argues that people who are unable to work must rely on voluntary charity, thus implying that it is proper for those who can afford it to support strangers in non-emergency situations. And indeed, as recent scholarship has revealed, in her own life Rand was often extremely generous, not only towards friends and acquaintances, but also strangers.[7]\n\nThe question arises why Rand thinks that charity, kindness etc. are not major virtues when they meet all the conditions of appropriateness: the recipient is worthy of help, one can afford to help, it is in one\u2019s rational self-interest (or not contrary to it) to help, and so on. Perhaps Rand thinks that they are \u201cminor\u201d virtues because we are not obligated to act on them at all times, the way we are obligated to act justly and honestly at all times. A deeper reason, however, might be her conception of people as essentially agents rather than patients, doers rather than receivers, self-sufficient rather than dependent. Nevertheless, Rand\u2019s view of the unity of the virtues dictates that, even if we are not obligated to act on charity, kindness etc. at all times, they are just as important to possess as the other virtues. Moreover, in keeping with her emphasis on the importance of goodwill towards others and \u201cthe benevolent universe premise\u201d, Rand\u2019s heroes are often extraordinarily (and almost always appropriately) kind and generous, not only towards those they love but also towards mere acquaintances, and even sometimes adversaries. Striking examples include, from The Fountainhead, Howard Roark\u2019s unsought-for attempt to give hope and courage to Steven Mallory, the gifted young sculptor whose failure to get work has driven him to the verge of a spiritual and physical collapse, and Roark\u2019s unreproachful help to his erstwhile adversary, Peter Keating, when Keating falls on hard times. In Atlas Shrugged, Dagny offers support to a heart-broken and despairing Cheryl Taggart who, in the past, has treated Dagny with scorn, and Hank Rearden generously supports his exploitative family before he realizes their exploitativeness.[8] Rand\u2019s implicit recognition that kindness and generosity are important virtues is shown also in her depiction of her villains as lacking all kindness and generosity.\n\nJust as rationality, a focus on reality, is at the heart of every virtue, so irrationality, evasion of reality (including self-deception), is at the heart of every vice. Rand\u2019s villains are all master evaders motivated by a desire for power, social status, fame, or unearned wealth, and resentment of the good. They are \u201csecond-handers\u201d\u2014people whose primary relationship is to other people rather than to reality. Between the virtuous and the vicious are the \u201cinnocently wrong\u201d, people who adopt wrong moral principles or make wrong choices, not through evasion but through an error of judgment (Rand does not explicitly recognize any moral category other than virtue, vice, and moral error, although her novels portray characters that do not easily fit into any of these categories). Hank Rearden, in Atlas Shrugged, is the great innocent living under a burden of unearned guilt because of his mistaken sense of honor and a family interested only in manipulating and using him. Cheryl Taggart is killed by the too-sudden revelation that the man she loved and admired as the embodiment of her ideals is a fraud\u2014and that the world is full of such frauds.\n\nAs already indicated, Rand justifies virtue in both instrumental and non-instrumental terms, though without distinguishing between them. The instrumental arguments show the existential and psychological rewards of virtue and costs of vice. In her depiction of her heroes, Rand shows her conviction that virtue creates an inner harmony and serenity. Virtue also makes one trustworthy, and thus enables mutually beneficial interactions with others. Evasiveness, by contrast, traps one in a \u201ctangled web\u201d of rationalizations and pretenses. The evader who deceives others is either eventually caught, or lives in fear of getting caught, becoming dependent on others\u2019 unconsciousness. He is \u201ca fool\u201d, says a character in Atlas Shrugged, \u201cwhose source of values is the fools he succeeds in fooling\u201d (1957 [1992]: 945). Further, like Sartre, Rand holds that no evasion is completely successful, because the truth constantly threatens to resurface. Hence, the evader\u2019s \u201cdiseased soul\u201d is in a state of constant inner conflict and anxiety as he tries to suppress his awareness of uncomfortable truths while maintaining his hold on others. His lack of integrity and of esteem for reality results in a lack of self-love or self-esteem and, indeed, of a solid self. (It is noteworthy, however, that Rand\u2019s portrayal of Gail Wynand in The Fountainhead is closer to Aristotle\u2019s portrayal of the vicious man in Book III of the Nicomachean Ethics as someone who is \u201cunconscious of his vice\u201d than to her own stated view of the evader.)\n\nThese views are familiar from the history of philosophy, but many readers find their expression in Rand\u2019s novels to be of unusual psychological depth and conviction. Nevertheless, the views are subject to the well-known objection that the complexity and variability of human psychology and society allow only \u201cfor the most part\u201d generalizations about the existential and psychological benefits of virtue or costs of vice. For example, it is possible for a small injustice to lead to great rewards, especially since others are willing to shrug off or forgive occasional transgressions. It is also possible for poor introspection, forgetfulness, or self-acceptance to allow one to evade something without any need for supporting evasions or damage to one\u2019s self-esteem. Again, even if every wrongdoing carries psychological costs, these might sometimes be outweighed by the long-term psychological and existential costs of doing the right thing (as Rand herself suggests in her portrayal of the embittered Henry Cameron and Stephen Mallory in The Fountainhead).\n\nThe non-instrumentalist justification of virtue in Rand\u2019s novels is largely immune to these objections (though subject to the objections noted in 2.4 above). To compromise morally is, necessarily, to compromise one\u2019s own (objectively conceived) happiness, because no existential loss can compare to the loss of moral integrity. Rectitude is partly constitutive of genuine happiness because it expresses the right relationship to reality: to existence, to oneself, and to others. For the same reason, it is partly constitutive of a self worth loving, an ideally human or rational self. Any value gained at the price of rectitude is only the simulacrum of genuine value. In a variety of conceptually interconnected ways, then, virtuous individuals are necessarily better off than those willing to take moral short-cuts. In its structure and much of its content, Rand\u2019s ethical egoism is thus of a piece with the egoism of ancient eudaimonistic theories.\n\nOf course, this non-instrumentalist justification of virtue depends on the prior instrumentalist justification, viz., that in normal circumstances (that is, in a society of more or less virtuous people), virtue enables us to gain both external and psychological goods. If justice or kindness were systematically bad for human beings, leading to disease and death, they would not be virtues. If rationality routinely led to an early demise, no one would value rationality. But this does not entail, as Salmieri seems to think, that the ultimate value is literal survival (Salmieri 2019). All it entails is that the virtues be compatible with survival in normal circumstances. For it is easy to see that if justice or kindness systematically led to deep depression, and rationality routinely sucked the joy out of life, only the rare misery-lover would value his life, or the virtues. Survival is a necessary condition of a happy life (as well as an unhappy one), not an ultimate value. And it\u2019s only because the virtues lead to, and partly constitute, a happy (eudaimonic) life, that a virtuous person considers it a greater loss to betray his principles than to lose the work he loves \u2013 or, sometimes, even his life. One of the best examples of this from Rand\u2019s own work is Howard Roark\u2019s decision to act out of integrity, even at the cost of being unable to practice architecture (The Fountainhead). Another example concerns two minor characters in We The Living who risk \u2013 and lose \u2013 their freedom and lives for resisting the new communist regime. (Note, however, that Rand does not think that we are morally obligated to martyr ourselves to fight evil. All we are obligated to do is not be complicit in evil, or betray our values.)\n\nEven on this indirect, sophisticated egoism, where the good to the agent lies in being virtuous, Rand\u2019s theory is open to the objection often levied against egoistic theories, viz., that they give the wrong reason for acting in other-regarding ways \u2013 justly, kindly, etc. My act does not adequately express the virtue of justice if I give you your due solely or primarily because acting justly is good for me rather than because I recognize and respect your moral standing, your entitlement to be treated justly. Nor does my helping you when you need help adequately express goodwill or kindness if I help you solely or primarily because acting benevolently is good for me. One way out taken by some other theories is to argue that the egoist\u2019s justification is egoistic but not her motivation. Rand does not address the \u201cwrong-reason\u201d objection, but there is no hint in her writings that she would accept this dichotomy between justification and motivation. The root of the problem is that, although Rand rejects psychological egoism, she seems to regard genuine goodwill towards, or love of, others as an offshoot of proper self-love, as though there were no independent source of love for others in human nature. This is where her metaethics and ethics differ most starkly from that of Aristotle.\n\n2.6 Altruism\n\nAccording to Rand, there is only one alternative to being rationally self-interested: sacrificing one\u2019s proper interests, either for the sake of other people (which she equates with altruism) or for the sake of the supernatural (which she calls mysticism) (1982a: ch. 7). \u201cThe basic principle of altruism\u201d, she argues, \u201cis that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the only justification of his existence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue and value\u201d (\u201cFaith and Force,\u201d PWNI 61). Kant\u2019s ethics is a secularized mysticism insofar as it rests on categorical commands and duty for duty\u2019s sake, which is to say: regardless of any earthly desire or interest (1970). An altruistic ethics equates right action with self-sacrifice for the sake of others\u2019 good and immorality with \u201cselfishness\u201d, while saying nothing about the standard of the good (\u201cIntroduction\u201d, 1964a: iii; 1974). It thus fails to answer the prior question of what code of values we should follow and why, and provides no motivation to be moral other than guilt over \u201cselfishness\u201d. When taken to its logical conclusion, altruism does not simply tell us that it is \u201cselfish\u201d to pursue our own desires, but also that it is \u201cselfish to uphold\u2026 [our own] convictions, \u2026 [that we] must sacrifice them to the convictions of others\u201d (Rand 1957 [1992]: 943; Galt\u2019s Speech, Rand 1961a: 142). In foreign policy, altruism is used to justify and gain support for America\u2019s intervention in other countries (1966a). Altruism is also the reason why so many sympathize with, or even praise, bloody dictatorships that proudly proclaim that the sacrifice of the individual is a necessary and noble means to the goal of the collective good (Rand 1966a).\n\nAs a moral code, altruism is impractical, because its requirements are contrary to the requirements of life and happiness, both the agent\u2019s and other people\u2019s. As such, it is also profoundly immoral. Altruism leaves us without any moral guidance in our everyday lives and gives morality a bad name.\n\nWhat, then, is the psychological explanation for the widespread equation of altruism with morality? Rand suggests various explanations reminiscent of Nietzsche\u2019s analysis of the psychology of altruism. The theorists and preachers of altruism are motivated largely by a desire to control and manipulate others by playing on their guilt. Those who accept their teachings typically do so either because of guilt over their own superior achievements, or because, lacking any \u201cintellectual integrity, love of truth\u2026or a passionate dedication to an idea\u201d, they have nothing much worth saving, and so do not mind sacrificing themselves (\u201cSelfishness Without a Self\u201d, 1973b; 1982a). Some altruists are altruists because their mentalities are still frozen in a tribal past when survival required the sacrifice of some for the sake of others (1973b). Rand herself rejects a zero-sum picture of human relationships, so long as everyone in the relationship acts rationally.\n\nRand\u2019s defense of \u201cselfishness\u201d (rational self-interest) and rejection of altruism (living for others\u2019 sake) are part of the reason both for her popularity with the general reader, and her unpopularity with philosophers and other intellectuals, although some would no doubt agree with her rejection of abject self-sacrifice and her recognition of proper concern with the self as moral (Falk 1963; Gilligan 1982; Hampton 1993; Badhwar 1993a). The general reader who responds positively to Rand\u2019s work finds, for the first time, a moral justification for pursuing a life of her or his own and a liberation from \u201cunearned guilt\u201d. The philosopher who responds negatively to her work finds many biased and simplistic interpretations of philosophers and philosophical doctrines, including her claim that she is the first to consistently defend a morality of rational self-interest, all other philosophers having defended either altruism or mysticism (Pojman 1995). Her critics also challenge her equation of altruism with abject self-sacrifice (Rachels 2000, Flew 1984), and her claim (explained below) that there is no conflict between people\u2019s rational interests (Flew 1984).\n\n3. Social-Political Philosophy\n\n3.1 Rights, Capitalism, the Trader Principle, and Government\n\n\u201cForce and mind are opposites; morality ends where a gun begins\u201d (Atlas Shrugged 1023). Not only actually shooting someone, but also threatening him with a gun, is an act of force. The non-initiation of force against others is the basic moral principle guiding our interactions with others, whether in a political society, or in the state of nature. It is also the basic political principle: \u201cno man may initiate the use of physical force against others. \u2026 Men have the right to use physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use\u201d (1961b, 1964a: 36). This political principle binds not only individuals in their interactions with each other, but also, importantly, the government. Rand\u2019s ideal society is a society of independent individuals who respect each other\u2019s rights to life, liberty, and property, and who trade value for value, materially and spiritually. They live, in her words, by \u201cthe trader principle\u201d. Individual rights and the trader principle are both dictated by the fact that, as rational, independent beings, we need to think and act for our \u201cproper survival\u201d (1961b: 31). Both are based in human nature, and required by respect for individuals as ends in themselves, not mere means to others\u2019 ends. But what exactly is a right?\n\n\u201cRights\u201d are a moral concept\u2014the concept that provides a logical transition from the principles guiding an individual\u2019s actions to the principles guiding his relationship with others\u2014the concept that preserves and protects individual morality in a social context\u2014the link between the moral code of a man and the legal code of a society, between ethics and politics. Individual rights are the means of subordinating society to moral law. (1963b: 92).\n\nAgain,\n\nA \u201cright\u201d is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man\u2019s freedom of action in a social context. (1964a 93).\n\nThese rights are based in human nature, and are basically rights to actions, not to things or outcomes, and they can be violated only through the initiation or threat of force, or through fraud. Hence, all natural rights are negative, that is, claims on others\u2019 non-interference, and not claims on them to provide one with certain goods or outcomes.[9] The fundamental right is the right to life: the right to take the actions necessary for sustaining the life proper to a human being.\n\nThe right to life means\u2026the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life. (Such is the meaning of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.). (1963b: 93)\n\nThe right to liberty is the right to act (including to write and speak) on one\u2019s judgment; the right to the pursuit of happiness is the right to pursue goals for one\u2019s own fulfillment; the right to property is \u201cthe right to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values\u201d (1963b: 94). Like the mind-body dichotomy, the common dichotomy between \u201chuman rights\u201d and the right to property is a false one, because to own one\u2019s life is to own one\u2019s actions and their fruits (1962b: 91).[10] Just as there is a causal and logical connection between the virtues, so there is between these rights: a government that violates human rights also violates property rights. Thus, for example, in violating the right to freedom of expression by banning \u201cobscene\u201d speech on TV, the government violates the property right of the owners of the TV station to use their property as they see fit. Like other libertarians, both right (market) and left (egalitarian), Rand opposes state regulation of morality, as well as forced service to the state, whether military or civilian. She criticizes both conservatives and liberals (as these terms are understood in American politics) for wanting government to control the realm they regard as important: the spiritual or moral realm in the case of conservatives, and the material or economic realm in the case of liberals (1981b). Both sides thus betray a lack of understanding of the fact that human beings need to be free in both realms to be free in either.\n\nCritics have pointed out that if we have rights only because we need them for our survival and happiness, then we have no right to take actions that are contrary to our survival and happiness, such as blindly following a guru instead of thinking for ourselves, living off others because we prefer the life of a couch potato to fending for ourselves, wasting our property instead of using it wisely, or, most obviously, committing suicide (Mack 1984; Zwolinski 2019). Yet the freedom to do only that which is morally good or rational is no freedom. But there is another interpretation of the claim that \u201cThe right to life means\u2026the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life.\u201d What Rand is pointing out here is that we would not have rights if we did not need them for our survival and happiness (Badhwar 2017, Miller & Mossoff 2019). This need (and the fact that we value our survival and happiness) is the source of rights. If by our very nature we didn\u2019t care whether we lived or died, didn\u2019t care about being forced by the government or other people to act in certain ways and not others, had no use for property, and couldn\u2019t be bothered to think for ourselves, we would have no rights. It doesn\u2019t follow, however, that we don\u2019t have the right to act contrary to the requirements of our survival or happiness. As Rand says elsewhere:\n\nA right is the sanction of independent action. A right is that which can be exercised without anyone\u2019s permission (Rand 2018 83). [A] right is the moral sanction of a positive, of his freedom to act on his own judgment, for his own goals, by his own voluntary, uncoerced choice. (Rand 1963b 93.)\n\nIn spite of several statements that justify such freedom in terms of the individual\u2019s rational judgments (Rand 1965 17), it is the position taken here that is compatible with Rand\u2019s deep-seated commitment to liberty and a minimal government.\n\nAnother criticism of Rand\u2019s theory of rights is that it is incompatible with her ethical egoism, because respect for others\u2019 rights cannot be justified as a means to the ultimate end of one\u2019s survival (Mack 1984; Flew 1984). For under perfectly realistic scenarios, one\u2019s survival can require one to violate another\u2019s right to life or property. Thus, according to these critics, Rand\u2019s defense of rights suffers from the same unresolved tension between the instrumentalist strand and the deontic strand that we find in her justification of morality in general (Mack 1984, 2003). On our eudaimonistic interpretation of Rand\u2019s ethical egoism and theory of rights, there is no incompatibility between the two. Nevertheless, as we\u2019ve argued above, both her ethical egoism and her theory of rights face the criticism that the primary reason for respecting others\u2019 rights, or exercising any of the other-regarding virtues, is not one\u2019s eudaimonia but the fact that others are ends in themselves. What promotes our eudaimonia is recognizing this and living accordingly, but our own eudaimonia is not the primary reason for respecting people\u2019s rights.\n\nEverything said so far shows that Rand believes that individuals have rights even in a state of nature, or a society without a government. Yet in later years, in a workshop on rights, Rand suggests that rights exist only in a society with some kind of authority and a \u201cformulated morality\u201d (2018: 111). It is not clear what Rand means by \u201cformulated morality\u201d: a written, or at least explicitly stated, morality that recognizes rights, like the Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution? Or like Thomas Paine\u2019s Rights of Man?? But aren\u2019t there many societies \u2013 perhaps a majority \u2013 that don\u2019t have a formulated morality yet do recognize at least individuals\u2019 basic rights against each other and the government, and many that can produce paper Constitutions claiming to recognize these rights that, in fact, they deny their citizens? In any case, Rand takes back her controversial statement by reiterating her earlier view that:\n\nThe source of man\u2019s rights is not divine law or congressional law, but the law of identity. A is A and Man is Man. Rights are conditions of existence required by man\u2019s nature for his proper survival (\u201cGalt\u2019s Speech,\u201d Rand 1961a: 182).\n\nWhat we don\u2019t have in the absence of a government, she says, is objectively defined laws that can determine if a right has been violated (2018: 211). A \u201cproper government,\u201d in her words, \u201cis the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control, i.e., under objectively defined laws\u201d (1963a: 128).\n\nOnkar Ghate (2019) and Harry Binswanger (2019) both defend this view. Ghate uses two scenarios involving individuals in a state of nature. Suppose you are by yourself on a desert island, and you domesticate a pig. Then someone from a neighboring tribe steals it. Do you have a right to retaliate by stealing some of his property, or stealing from his relatives? Again, suppose Robinson Crusoe and Friday are strangers sharing an island, and Crusoe invents a superior spear. Does Friday have a right to copy it? Ghate\u2019s main point is that because individuals in his scenarios don\u2019t have a government, they don\u2019t have objectively defined laws, and because they don\u2019t have objectively defined laws, the boundaries of their property rights are unclear. But Ghate does not explain why you, the pig owner, cannot talk to the tribe and come up with a mutually agreeable solution, or why Crusoe and Friday can\u2019t talk things over and decide on the boundaries of their rights vis-a-vis each other (if Crusoe has any common sense, he\u2019ll encourage Friday to copy his spear and propose that they cooperate in their future hunts). Of course the tribe and you might not be able to reach a resolution satisfactory to both of you. But that doesn\u2019t mean that it is in principle impossible to do so. Neither Rand nor Ghate (2019) provide an explanation of why a peaceful society of people without a government cannot come up with objective laws that define the boundaries of their rights \u2013 as, in fact, they do in Rand\u2019s Atlantis: Galt\u2019s Gulch. Their view seems to imply that if the Founding Fathers had been shipwrecked for 5 years on a desert island, they could not have come up with a Bill of Rights that defined the limits of their liberties vis-a-vis each other, or set up a fair system of adjudication in the event of a dispute. But we don\u2019t have to engage in hypotheticals. As many scholars have pointed out, starting in the 11th C, merchants from various countries created the body of law called the Law Merchant in order to protect foreign merchants not protected by the local laws (Benson 1989; see the entry on law merchant at libertarianism.org, linked from Other Internet Resources). The Law Merchant was uniform throughout Europe, and enforced by courts also created by merchants in European cities, without the involvement of any European government.\n\nRand argues that the only just social-political system, the only system compatible with our rational nature and with the right of individuals to live for their own sakes, is capitalism (1965, 1967b), that is,\n\nlaissez-faire capitalism\u2014with a separation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church. (1961b, 1964a)\n\nState regulation of the market, she argues, is responsible for corrupting both state and market institutions, just as political regulation of religion (or religious regulation of politics), wherever it exists, corrupts both state and religious institutions. Regulation creates the opportunity for the trading of favors between politicians and religious leaders, and politicians and businesses. Atlas Shrugged offers a complex and compelling depiction of the economic, political, and moral corruption spawned by \u201ccronyism\u201d between government and business. Laissez-faire capitalism is \u201cthe only [social] system that bans force from social relationships\u201d domestically and abroad, because the trader and the warrior are antagonists (Rand 1966a). Rand\u2019s conception of capitalism is, thus, more radical than the mainstream conception, and her defense of it significantly different both from the utilitarian defenses given by most economists, and the religious defenses given by many conservatives (for discussion, see Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1984b; Machan 1984). She does, of course, praise capitalism (or semi-capitalism) for creating widespread prosperity, but this feature is itself explained only by the fact that it leaves individuals free to produce in peace. In Atlas Shrugged, Rand distinguishes between the few business people who earn their money through honest effort, without seeking favors from the government, and the vast majority who are members of \u201cthe aristocracy of pull\u201d (\u201ccrony capitalists\u201d, in contemporary terminology) and get rich only through such favors, a situation that she thinks prevails, and has always prevailed, in the real world (Rand 1964c). She holds that for a short period in the nineteenth-century America came closer to a laissez-faire system than any other society before or since, but that capitalism remains an unknown ideal. Some critics complain, however, that in her non-fiction (1961c) Rand does not always recognize the aristocrats of pull in the real world\u2014business leaders who lobby politicians for subsidies for themselves and restrictions on their competitors (Rothbard 1968; Johnson 2006).\n\nRand rejects the criticism that unregulated, laissez-faire capitalism would lead to a concentration of power in a few hands and undermine people\u2019s ability to lead their own lives, because laissez-faire capitalism requires the rule of law, a well-defined system of property rights, freedom of contract, and, as a corollary, a government that abstains from all favoritism. In such a society, competition and opportunity will flourish, and prevent concentration of power in a few hands.\n\nRand holds that there is no conflict between one person\u2019s rational interests and another\u2019s, hence that there is no conflict between their rights (1962a, 1964a: 57\u201365). Is it true, however, that rational interests cannot conflict, or that, if they do, it follows that rights must also conflict? Our answer to both questions is \u2018no\u2019. We think that whenever two or more people have a rational interest in one good, there is potential for conflict, and sometimes that potential is actualized. To show otherwise, Rand considers a situation in which two people apply for the same job, and the better candidate gets the job. There is no conflict of interests here, she argues, because the better candidate has earned the job, and the loser cannot rationally wish to have been given the job. Both applicants also know that competition for jobs is a good thing, because the business would close if only one person applied for its jobs (presumably, because that would mean that the business wasn\u2019t doing very well).\n\nBoth points are well-taken. But what if the employer is not rational and gives the job to the somewhat less qualified applicant because, say, he reminds the employer of his long-lost brother? Or, what if the two candidates are equally qualified, and the hiring committee chooses one over the other by tossing a coin? In both cases there is a conflict of interests between two rational applicants. Rand raises the first possibility, that of the irrational employer, but doesn\u2019t trace its implications for her thesis that rational interests don\u2019t conflict. The second possibility, that of two equally qualified candidates, she does not consider at all. Rand would be on firmer ground if she were to argue that there is no necessary conflict between rational interests, that is, that it is not in their nature to conflict. When they conflict, it is due to contingent factors, such as only one job for two equally qualified people. In any case, a conflict between rational interests does not entail a conflict between rights, since, as Rand herself points out, neither party has a right to the job.\n\nRand defines government as:\n\nan institution that holds the exclusive power to enforce certain rules of social conduct in a given geographical area. (1963a: 125)\n\nA proper government is:\n\nthe means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control\u2014i.e., under objectively defined law. (1963b: 128)\n\nSuch a government is minimal, limited to protecting us from criminals and foreign aggressors, and enforcing individual rights and contracts with the help of the police and armed forces, using objectively defined civil and criminal laws and courts. Someone who violates his contracts, or engages in fraud, is guilty of the \u201cindirect\u201d use of force, in that he obtains a value from another without that person\u2019s consent (1963a: 111). Accordingly, the government may use or threaten force only in retaliation against those who initiate or threaten force directly or indirectly. A government that tries to enforce the brother\u2019s keeper principle\u2014\u201cfrom each according to his ability, to each according to his need\u201d; or that drafts citizens into the armed services or \u201cpublic service\u201d; or that forces them, directly or indirectly, to become more virtuous, well-mannered, healthy, or wealthy, violates rights. Statism in all its forms, from unlimited democracy to a mixed economy to dictatorship, is at odds with our status as independent, rational beings, as ends in ourselves. Statism also destroys ability and fails to fulfill anyone\u2019s needs for long, because \u201c[t]o deal with men by force is as impractical as to deal with nature by persuasion\u201d (1973a: 32). The fountainhead of all progress is the human mind, and the mind does not function well when forced.\n\nIn Atlas Shrugged Rand depicts her utopia, Galt\u2019s Gulch, as a \u201cvoluntary association of men held together by nothing but every man\u2019s self-interest\u201d, without any formal organization (1957 [1992]: 690). There is a judge to arbitrate disagreements, but there has never been any need for arbitration. Galt\u2019s Gulch is, thus, an anarchist society, although Rand never calls it that. In \u201cThe Nature of Government\u201d, however, Rand rejects anarchism as irrational and unworkable because, she says, it is incompatible with a single, objective system of law and, thus, with rights and peaceful cooperation (1963a; cf. 2018b). Anarchist critics, such as Roy Childs (1969 [1994]) and Murray Rothbard (1978), have argued that a territorial monopoly on law and force (government) is not necessary, because people can establish a just and effective legal system in a competitive market of security providers (see Long and Machan 2009). The Law Merchant, a body of law established and enforced in private courts by the merchants of various countries, illustrates the possibility of an effective voluntary legal system. Further, a government is incompatible with Rand\u2019s own principle of the non-initiation of force, a principle she regards as the linchpin of a moral society (Long 2013; cf. Cox 2013a and 2013b).\n\nThe trader principle states that a voluntary, mutually beneficial exchange between independent equals is the only basis for a mutually respectful and rational relationship (1961b: 31). It is also the only basis for a peaceful relationship among countries: \u201cthe trader and the warrior have been fundamental antagonists throughout history\u201d (1966a: 38).\n\nThe trader principle applies to emotional relationships as well. To love or admire someone is to \u201cpay\u201d him for the pleasure one derives from his virtues (1961b: 31)\u2014or, Rand might say in the case of love for a small child, from his personality. It would seem, however, that the trade between parent and child is unequal, given that the child receives both pleasure and material support from the parent. And it is unclear how the trader principle applies at all when a severe disability renders a beloved child or spouse a source of pain rather than pleasure.\n\n3.2 Feminism\n\nIf feminism is the view that women are, and ought to be recognized as, men\u2019s intellectual, moral, sexual, and political equals, then the Objectivist philosophy of human nature is inherently feminist, since it applies equally to all human beings, regardless of gender (or race) (N. Branden 1999). Decades before it was considered acceptable for women to lack \u201cmaternal instincts\u201d or pursue careers, Rand created heroines who lack the first and pursue the second, free of guilt or self-doubt.[11] Kira (We the Living) wants to be an engineer, and Dagny (Atlas Shrugged) runs Taggart Transcontinental, the largest and most successful transcontinental railroad in the country. None of Rand\u2019s heroines sacrifices her interests, intellect, or principles for the man or men in her life. One literary critic argues that Dagny is the first, and perhaps only, epic heroine in Western literature because of the grandness of her vision, her courage and integrity, her unusual abilities, and her national importance (Michalson 1999). Rand\u2019s depiction of her heroines\u2019 enjoyment of sex and their freedom from all merely conventional norms about sex anticipates the sexual liberation movement of the 20th century by at least 30 years. In all three novels, it is the heroine who has the power to choose which of the men who love, admire, and desire her (and only her) she will have. Rand was also an ardent champion of a woman\u2019s right to control her own reproductive choices (1968a, 1981).\n\nHer relationship to the feminist movement, however, was more complex. Although she praised Betty Friedan\u2019s The Feminine Mystique, mainstream feminism\u2019s collectivism and emphasis on women as victims later led her to reject feminism as such. Many theorists argue that Rand\u2019s work, especially Atlas Shrugged, upholds important feminist ideals, even as it succumbs to some anti-feminist tendencies that contradict her individualistic ethics (e.g., Gladstein 1978, 1999; B. Branden 1999; Presley 1999; Sheaffer 1999; Taylor 1999). Many others regard her and her work as plainly anti-feminist, with Susan Brownmiller even calling her \u201ca traitor to her own sex\u201d (Brownmiller 1975). One criticism takes aim at the individualism of Rand\u2019s ethics and politics, which rejects any special government help for women or discrimination against men (e.g., Harrison 1978). Another objects that Rand has internalized a masculine conception of human nature and virtue, and then created her ideal woman in light of this conception (Brownmiller 1975; Glennon 1979). This may be responsible for Rand\u2019s puzzling (and offensive) view that the essence of femininity is to hero-worship (not men, but) masculinity, while insisting (as her novels depict) that women and men are inherently equal and that the ideal romantic relationship is between moral and intellectual equals (1968b; cf. Brown 1999). At least as offensive to many are the violent sex scenes in her novels, especially the infamous scene in The Fountainhead that many regard as rape, where Howard Roark has sex with Dominique in spite of her resistance.\n\nThose who reject the charge of rape argue that in the 1940s and 50s, when Rand wrote her novels, it would have been seen as rough sex rather than non-consensual sex (McElroy 1999; Sheaffer 1999). That Rand herself thought of this scene as consensual is shown a few pages later, when she writes: \u201cThey had been united in an understanding beyond the violence, beyond the deliberate obscenity of his action\u201d (1943: 218). And in letters to disturbed readers in 1946 and 1965, Rand denied that the scene is \u201cactual rape\u201d which, she stated, is \u201ca dreadful crime\u201d, a \u201cvicious action and a violation of a woman\u2019s rights\u201d (Rand 1995a). On the other hand, she also depicts Dominique exultantly telling herself that she\u2019s been raped. McElroy wonders if having her heroine call it rape is just another instance of Rand\u2019s desire to provoke and shock the reader (McElroy 1999), as when she uses \u201cselfishness\u201d to mean \u201crational self-interest\u201d.\n\n4. Aesthetics\n\nRand holds that our actions need guidance by a vision of the fundamental nature of the universe and of the efficacy of human thought and activity\u2014a vision that can be grasped directly rather than requiring the conscious repetition of long chains of abstract reasoning. The chief function of art is to meet this psychological need by expressing abstract conceptual values and metaphysical truths in concrete perceptible form. Art, according to Rand, constitutes a selective, stylized re-creation of reality, with the principle of selection being the artist\u2019s \u201csense of life\u201d, a set of implicit \u201cmetaphysical value-judgments\u201d, i.e., judgments about what is fundamentally significant about the world and our place in it. (There is controversy among Rand scholars as to whether what is re-created in art is certain elements of reality or reality as a whole, i.e., a \u201cmicrocosm\u201d, as well as how and whether the concept of re-creation applies to apparently non-representational forms of art: Torres and Kamhi 2000; Bissell 2004.) Both the artist\u2019s creative work and the audience\u2019s emotional responses to it are driven by their senses of life, that is, the worldviews they have \u201cformed by a process of emotional generalization \u2026 a subconscious counterpart of a process of abstraction\u201d (1966b: 27). The role of art in sustaining us psychologically by providing a concretization of our most fundamental values is a frequent theme in Rand\u2019s fiction as well, especially The Fountainhead.[12]\n\nWhile art can be used to convey information or to advocate a position, such functions are secondary to its chief task: providing an object whose mere contemplation brings spiritual fulfillment. Hence Rand does not regard her own novels primarily as vehicles for her philosophy, though of course they are that inter alia. Given her own worldview, Rand favors literature with a strong plot as a way of expressing purposeful human action in a world of causal regularity, and stories involving value-conflicts as a way of expressing the importance of free choice; hence her preference for romantic (as opposed to, e.g., naturalistic) literature. But Rand holds that it is possible to evaluate an artwork\u2019s aesthetic value simply in terms of its success in conveying a concretization of the artist\u2019s sense of life, whether or not one shares the values and judgments so conveyed."}, {"url": "https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/ayn-rands-legacy", "page_content": "Ayn Rand died on March 6th, 1982, leaving behind a controversial legacy that still engages millions of people worldwide. Her book, \"Atlas Shrugged,\" was voted the most influential in their lives by members of the Book-of-the-Month Club in response to a 1991 Library of Congress survey.\n\nAlthough she wrote books such as \"For the New Intellectual,\" and \"Capitalism - the Unknown Ideal,\" her philosophy was accessed by many readers through her fiction writing. She left post-revolutionary Russia and settled in the US, where she began script writing in Hollywood. Her best-selling, \"The Fountainhead,\" features a brilliant architect who refuses to compromise his principles, espousing a radical individualism central to Rand\u2019s philosophy. The book\u2019s success, and that of its movie adaptation starring Gary Cooper, projected Rand to a wider audience. Her later work, Atlas Shrugged (1957), depicting a mysterious strike by leading innovators and industrialists, still sells hundreds of thousands of copies a year.\n\nShe called her philosophy \"Objectivism,\" supposing that reality exists as an objective absolute, independently of any conscious mind. She thought knowledge to be based not on faith, but on sense perception, the validity of which she considered axiomatic, and which was interpreted through reason.\n\nIn ethics, she argued for rational self-interest as the guiding moral principle, and said the individual should \"exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself.\"\n\nHer political philosophy emphasized individual rights, including life, liberty and property, and she supported laissez-faire capitalism because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights. This led her to oppose any government action beyond those needed to protect individual rights.\n\nControversially, she opposed altruism as a denial of rational self-interest, saying that no person should live his or her life for the sake of another. Although some deride this as \"selfish,\" in her view there is no conflict of interests between rational individuals; they recognize the value of respecting each other\u2019s rights consistently, sacrificing neither themselves nor others.\n\nA biographer, Jennifer Burns, referred to her as \"the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right,\" and it is true that she leads many, by justifying their belief in themselves, to support capitalism and to oppose all forms of collectivism. Rand has a huge following today, especially among young people, attracted by her philosophy of rational individualism, and by the way the Objectivist view of knowledge meshes in with its ethical and political stance.\n\nShe remains massively popular, even a cult figure in some circles, and has been featured in several documentaries. Her likeness even appeared on a 1999 US postage stamp. Each year the Adam Smith Institute hosts an Ayn Rand Lecture to commemorate her ideas."}, {"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand", "page_content": "Alice O'Connor (born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0430 \u0417\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0431\u0430\u0443\u043c, [a\u02c8l\u02b2\u026asa z\u02b2\u026a\u02c8nov\u02b2\u026avn\u0259 r\u0259z\u02b2\u026an\u02c8ba\u028am].[1].February 2 [O.S. January 20] , 1905 \u2013 March 6, 1982), better known by her pen name Ayn Rand ( ), was a Russian-born American writer, screenwriter, playwright and philosopher.[3]\n\nShe published several popular books in the United States during the mid-1900s, including her two best-selling novels, Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead, plus We the Living and Anthem. Her novels promoted a viewpoint of laissez-faire capitalism as a political and social goal. It is a kind of political philosophy known in the U.S.A. as libertarian conservatism. She called this philosophy 'objectivism'.\n\nHer husband was American actor and artist Frank O'Connor.\n\nRand was born in St. Petersburg, Russia and grew up during the Russian Revolution, in the years after World War I. She left Russia to visit relatives in Chicago in the United States when she was 21 years old. She did not want to return to live under Communism, and stayed in the US. She changed her name, partly to protect her family in Russia. Rand moved to California to become a movie writer.\n\nMovies at the time did not have sound, and stories were mimed on camera. Dialogue was not important, so Rand could write simple stories while she improved her English language skills.\n\nRand met Frank O'Connor on a movie set, when they both appeared as extras. When O'Connor married Rand in 1929, she could live permanently in America. She later became an American citizen. O'Connor gave up his acting career, to work full-time so Rand could write full-time. Later he retired, when Rand's work made a good income. He began painting late in his life. He died in 1979.\n\nRand was a longtime tobacco smoker. She had lung cancer, but she recovered from the disease after surgery. She died of cardiovascular disease in New York City on March 6, 1982.\n\nRand's first book was We the Living. It is about life in Russia during and after the Russian Revolution, and how life in the later Soviet Union destroys the dreams and hopes of its main characters, who are mostly young people.\n\nHer second book was Anthem, which is a science fiction novella, a dystopian story about a man named Equality 7-2521 who lives in a future society. In that place, everybody is given their name by the government, and nobody can use the words \"I\" or \"me\". He escapes from this society with a partner, to live freely in a house in a hidden place.\n\nHer stage play Woman on Trial (better known as Night of January 16th) used audience members as a jury, to decide the play's outcome (by voting the lead character guilty or not guilty) each time it was performed. Some celebrities, such as Helen Keller, appeared as jury members.\n\nHer third novel was The Fountainhead. It is about an architect, who wants to have control over his building designs, and does not like when he has to compromise his building designs. The Fountainhead became a best-seller, and was made into a movie starring Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal.\n\nHer fourth novel was Atlas Shrugged. It is her longest book. It was also a best-seller. It tells a story about a worldwide economic crisis. This is caused by the best minds in business, industry, and science, and after a while all thinking people, quitting their jobs and disappearing. This is a protest against government regulations that get in the way of their work or make it harder to do.\n\nThe more that governments get in the way, the worse conditions become, until society collapses. A new future begins when the people who disappeared return, and governments adopt laissez-faire principles, that do not try to control how businesses work, or misuse innovations.\n\nAfter writing Atlas Shrugged, she wrote non-fiction books about her Objectivist ideas. She published The Objectivist Newsletter, which then became The Objectivist magazine, with contributions by other writers. She also published The Ayn Rand Letter, a later newsletter about her ideas. Rand's views are typical libertarian\u2013conservative views. Freedom of the individual, the evils of 'large' government, the economic benefits of low taxes and 'small' government, the 'open' society: these are values which run through all her work.\n\nRand invented a philosophy that she called \"Objectivism\". She was against communism, socialism, and collectivism, which are political systems where a community or the government of a country takes charge of distribution of that country's goods and products.\n\nShe opposed altruism, which she viewed as a form of self-sacrifice. She favored a form of rational selfishness.\n\nShe also thought that countries should have very small governments. Rand did not think that welfare payments to poor people were a good thing, because this involves using force to take money away from others. She believed that charity (giving money away) could be a good thing if the person giving the money wanted and chose to do it, but she did not think that people should be expected or forced to give away their money.\n\nShe was against religion, and was an atheist.\n\nSelected bibliography [ change | change source ]\n\n\u2191 Alisa or Alissa Most sources transliterate her given name as eitheror \u2191 The Passion of Ayn Rand.

Sometimes the name emerges from a consensus of its practitioners \u2013 for example, Existentialism. It takes a bigger than average ego to consciously create a philosophy and give it a name of one\u2019s own choosing. In For the New Intellectual (1961), Ayn Rand wrote, \u201cThe name I have chosen for my philosophy is Objectivism.\u201d\n\n\n\nAyn Rand by Gail Campbell 2019\n\nRussia & America\n\nAyn Rand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum in Saint Petersburg in 1905. Her father was a successful Jewish pharmacist. At the age of twelve the October Revolution totally changed her life. Her father\u2019s business was confiscated and the family fled to the Crimea, where they spent the years of the Russian Civil War (1918-21).\n\nRand is often accused of mythologising her early life, but one passage rings true, and reveals a lot:\n\n\u201cI lived in a small town that changed hands many times\u2026 When it was occupied by the White Army [Tsarist], I almost longed for the return of the Red Army [Communist], and vice versa. There was not much difference between them in practice, but there was in theory. The Red Army stood for totalitarian dictatorship and rule by terror. The White Army stood for nothing; repeat: nothing. In answer to the monstrous evil they were fighting, the Whites found nothing better to proclaim than the dustiest, smelliest bromides of the time: we must fight, they said, for Holy Mother Russia, for faith and tradition.\u201d\n\n(\u2018The Lessons of Vietnam\u2019, 1975)\n\nAfter the war the family returned to Saint Petersburg, which had by then become known as Petrograd, and Alisa enrolled in the State University. She was awarded a diploma in History in 1924, allegedly after being expelled as bourgeois but then rescued through the intervention of foreign scholars. After this she studied Screen Arts in what was by then Leningrad. About this time she adopted the \u2018writing name\u2019 Ayn Rand , although she apparently never explained her reasons for doing so. In 1925 she was granted a visa to visit relatives in Chicago, and she arrived in New York in February 1926, allegedly speaking no English. (If so, she became fluent very quickly.) She attempted to secure visas to bring her family to the USA, but without success.\n\nWriter & Philosopher\n\nRand moved to Hollywood and got work as an extra, through, it is claimed, a chance meeting with Cecil B. DeMille. Later she worked as a screenwriter. In 1929 she married the actor Frank O\u2019Connor, and became an American citizen in 1931. She embarked on a career as a novelist and playwright, initially with limited success. Then one of her plays was produced on Broadway, and in 1936 she published her semi-autobiographical novel We the Living.\n\n1943 saw the publication of The Fountainhead, her first bestseller. It was filmed in 1949 using Rand\u2019s own script (slightly modified), and starred Gary Cooper. According to some accounts, Rand did not like the film, despite having written it. Other accounts have her thanking the producer and director for staying true to her vision.\n\nHer next novel, Atlas Shrugged (1957) was an expression of the philosophy she\u2019d been developing. It was also her last work of fiction. By the time it appeared, Rand had moved from Los Angeles to New York and surrounded herself with a group of admirers who met in her apartment to discuss her ideas. They humorously described themselves as \u2018the collective\u2019. In 1961 she published For the New Intellectual, the manifesto of Objectivism, and for the next twenty years she devoted herself to expressing her beliefs through non-fiction, mainly in The Objectivist Newsletter and through public talks.\n\nRand tells the story that she was asked if she \u201ccould present the essence of [her] philosophy while standing on one foot.\u201d Her reply was:\n\n1. Metaphysics: Objective Reality\n\n2. Epistemology: Reason\n\n3. Ethics: Self-interest\n\n4. Politics: Capitalism\n\nShe also wrote that \u201cThe motive and purpose of my writing is the projection of an ideal man.\u201d Of course, her ideas are much more complex than this. But it is probably in her fiction rather than in her essays that her intentions become most clear.\n\nThe Fountainhead revolves around a housing development project designed by the hero, architect Howard Roark. A key plot development occurs when a member of the development team manipulates a change to the design in order to provide herself with a long term job. This is a self-interested act, which is seemingly in line with the third tenet of Rand\u2019s philosophy so you might expect her to approve; but Rand implicitly condemns it. Roark is presented as having artistic integrity: he does what he believes in, even when it seems contrary to his immediate self-interest. Therefore Roark is true to himself. Here Rand contrasts petty selfishness with the \u2018heroic egoism\u2019 that she really believes in.\n\nRand did admit to having been influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900), but also claimed to have rejected his ideas. Her heroes, however, show all the traits of a Nietzschean \u00dcbermensch. In particular, her capitalists are consistently tycoons, usually self-made, who own their own businesses and are not constrained by the \u2018herd instinct\u2019 of shareholders. (Another Nietzschean trait in Rand is the frequent quoting of her own works.)\n\nThe Individual & the State\n\nRand argued that for most of history, human societies had been governed either by men of violence or by men of mysticism (\u2018Attila and the witch-doctor\u2019, as she eloquently borrowed from Nathaniel Branden). Neither the violent nor the mystics produced anything: rather, they both took from the producers, whether by force or by what Rand regarded as the fraud of religion. Only in modern times have the \u2018producers\u2019 (by which she means capitalists) come to dominate society, under the guidance of reason. But, she argues in For the New Intellectual, contemporary thought is tending to reverse this development.\n\nHer two bugbears were altruism and statism. She never denied that human beings could give unselfishly to each other, for whatever reasons, but she argued against all moral systems which claimed or implied that human beings were obliged to live for others, whether for other individuals or for the community. Her vision of ideal human interaction was instead based on capitalism. Human beings should relate to each other as \u2018traders\u2019, each pursuing their rational self-interest, and so engaging with each other in a decent and reasonable fashion, with mutual respect and acknowledging the value of every human being \u2013 in E.F. Schumacher\u2019s phrase, practicing \u2018economics as if people mattered\u2019. (Interestingly, the novelist and Christian apologist C.S. Lewis gave a criticism of what he called \u2018unselfishness\u2019 which closely resembles Rand\u2019s critique of altruism.)\n\nRand accepted the need for some sort of state. She wrote against all forms of anarchism, including capitalist anarchism, and argued that a state was necessary in order to provide a framework of law and to protect its citizens against aggression, either from outside or from each other. However, beyond that she believed that the capitalist market/trader interaction was sufficient for a good society. But, she noted, the state has a tendency to extend its activities beyond the limited role she advocated. In particular, the state could be taken over by \u2018altruism\u2019. This meant that it became a means of redistributing the property of its citizens on the basis of service to each other. That is, it collected taxes on the basis of ability to pay, but supplied services on the basis of need, as defined by the state.\n\nTo return to the quotation about the Russian Civil War: in her adolescence Ayn Rand was offered two visions of how the world should be \u2013 monarchical or Communist \u2013 and rejected them both. She then moved to the United States with a vision of how the USA should be, and slowly discovered that the USA did not live up to her ideal, either. She then spent decades trying to convince the USA to become what she thought it should be.\n\nCriticism & Appreciation\n\n\u201cSex is the most profoundly selfish of all acts,\u201d says a character in Atlas Shrugged: \u201cA man\u2019s sexual choice is the result and the sum of his fundamental convictions.\u201d In 1954 Rand began an affair with Nathaniel Branden, one of her followers, who was also married. His wife and her husband apparently consented to the affair. In 1958 Branden began the Nathaniel Branden Lectures to promote Rand\u2019s ideas, later incorporating them as the Nathaniel Branden Institute. In 1964, after the affair with Rand was over, Branden began an affair with a young actress. When Rand learned of it in 1968 she was furious. She accused Branden of dishonesty and \u2018irrational behaviour in his private life\u2019 and cut off relations with both him and his wife. The Nathaniel Branden Institute had to close. No-one really understands what lay behind Rand\u2019s reaction; but it provoked accusations that Objectivism, despite its overt commitment to reason, had cult-like elements.\n\nActually it is easy to criticise Ayn Rand. For instance, her interpretation of history in her writings is overly simplistic. For one classic error, consider this: \u201cCapitalism was the system originated in the United States.\u201d (\u2018Introducing Objectivism\u2019, LA Times, June 17th 1962). Adam Smith would be surprised. She was also unable to appreciate non-Western art; indeed, it can be argued that the only art she really understood was fiction in the European tradition. But one then has to say that she appreciated Ian Fleming and Mickey Spillane, and tap dancing. She may have had a narrow vision, but she was not an intellectual snob.\n\nIn fact, Rand can only be understood in terms of her paradoxes. She was viewed as a right-winger in the American tradition, but she supported the right to abortion and opposed the Vietnam war. She despised homosexuality but argued against its criminalisation. She was an atheist, but regarded Saint Thomas Aquinas as her greatest influence after Aristotle. She was a strong-minded independent woman but not a feminist. Rather, she believed that women should look up to men. In The Fountainhead she even presented Dominique Francon as accepting her rape by Roark because he dominated her. But she accepted that women could rise almost to the top \u2013 she drew the line at a female President of the USA.\n\nRand\u2019s greatest weakness was perhaps her belief that her conclusions were the product of uncontaminated reason. If she allowed Objectivism to turn into a cult, it was because she believed that her conclusions, having been reached through pure reason, were the only possible conclusions. She often criticised other thinkers for letting emotion influence their ideas, but she never realised the extent to which her emotions and past experience led her to her own conclusions.\n\nWhy then should we consider Ayn Rand\u2019s ideas? First, because she is not, ever, a conventional thinker. However misguided her conclusions may seem, she has reached them through her own effort. Moreover, she asks the kind of questions about interhuman relations and our relationship to the state which still need to be asked, and answered. Even if we consider her answers wrong, we need to accept that she asked the right questions and reflect on what our responses should be to the same issues. For instance, at the end of For the New Intellectual, Rand puts forward two important propositions:\n\na. That emotions are not tools of cognition;\n\nb. That no man has the right to initiate the use of physical force against others.\n\nIt is possible to imagine arguments against both of these propositions: possible, but not easy.\n\nRand was a lifelong heavy smoker and underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974. She enrolled in Social Security and Medicare, but this was not inconsistent with her philosophy: she argued that if the state had improperly taken money from you in taxes, you were entitled to a return on your unwilling investment. As she aged, and especially after her husband\u2019s death in 1979, she reduced her activity, but continued to work on a (never completed) TV adaptation of Atlas Shrugged. She died of a heart attack on March 6th 1982. She was buried next to her husband in a New York cemetery. Her tombstone reads \u2018Ayn Rand O\u2019Connor 1905-1982\u2019.\n\n\u00a9 Martin Jenkins 2019\n\nMartin Jenkins is a retired community worker and a Quaker.

She promoted the philosophy of Objectivism, expressing her ideas in her books, most notably, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged.\n\nBackground Rand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum on February 2, 1905, to a Russian-Jewish family in Saint Petersburg. Her father, Zinovy Rosenbaum, was a prosperous pharmacist and her mother was socially ambitious and religiously observant.\n\nEducation After being tutored at home, Alissa Rosenbaum, the eldest of three children, was enrolled in Stoiunina Gymnasium where she excelled academically but was socially isolated. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, her father\u2019s shop was confiscated by communist authorities, an event she deeply resented. As a student at Leningrad State University (present Saint Petersburg State University), she studied history and became acquainted with the works of Plato and Aristotle. After graduating in 1924, she enrolled in the Russian State Institute of Performing Arts, hoping to become a screenwriter.\n\nCareer The arrival of a letter from cousins in Chicago gave her an opportunity to leave the country on the pretext of gaining expertise that she could apply in the Soviet film industry. Upon her arrival in the United States in 1926, she changed her name to Ayn Rand. After six months in Chicago, she moved to Hollywood, where a fortuitous encounter with the producer Cecil B. DeMille led to work as a movie extra and eventually to a job as a screenwriter. Soon hired as a filing clerk in the wardrobe department of RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., she rose to head of the department within a year, meanwhile writing stories, plays, and film scenarios in her spare time. She became an American citizen in 1931.\n\n\n\nRand\u2019s first successful play, Night of January 16th (1933; originally titled Penthouse Legend), was a paean to individualism in the form of a courtroom drama. In 1934 she and O\u2019Connor moved to New York City so that she could oversee the play\u2019s production on Broadway. That year she also wrote Ideal, about a self-centered film star on the run from the law, first as a novel and then as a play. However, she shelved both versions. The play was not produced until 1989, and the novel was not published until 2015. Her first published novel, We the Living (1936), was a romantic tragedy in which Soviet totalitarianism epitomized the inherent evils of collectivism, which she understood as the subordination of individual interests to those of the state. A subsequent novella, Anthem (1938), portrayed a future collectivist dystopia in which the concept of the self and even the word \u201cI\u201d have been lost.\n\n\n\nRand spent more than seven years working on her first major work, The Fountainhead (1943), the story of a handsome architectural genius whose individualism and integrity are evinced in his principled dedication to his own happiness. The hero, Howard Roark, blows up a public housing project he had designed after it is altered against his wishes by government bureaucrats. On trial for his crime, he delivers a lengthy speech in his own defense in which he argues for individualism over collectivism and egoism over altruism (\u201cthe doctrine which demands that man live for others and place others above self\u201d). The jury votes unanimously to acquit him. Despite generally bad reviews, the book attracted readers through word of mouth and eventually became a best seller. Rand sold it to Warner Brothers studio and wrote the screenplay for the film, which was released in 1949.\n\n\n\nHaving returned to Los Angeles with O\u2019Connor to work on the script for The Fountainhead, Rand signed a contract to work six months a year as a screenwriter for the independent producer Hal Wallis. In 1945 she began sketches for her next novel, Atlas Shrugged, which is generally considered her masterpiece. The book depicts a future United States on the verge of economic collapse after years of collectivist misrule, under which productive and creative citizens (primarily industrialists, scientists, and artists) have been exploited to benefit an undeserving population of moochers and incompetents.\n\n\n\nIn 1950 Rand agreed to meet a young admirer, Nathan Blumenthal, on the basis of his several articulate fan letters. The two established an immediate rapport, and Blumenthal and his girlfriend, Barbara Weidman, became Rand\u2019s friends as well as her intellectual followers. In 1951 the couple moved to New York, and Rand and O\u2019Connor soon followed. There the Brandens, as Nathan and Barbara called themselves after their marriage in 1953, introduced Rand to their friends and relatives, some of whom later attended regular meetings at Rand\u2019s apartment for discussion and to read newly written chapters of Atlas Shrugged. The group, which called itself the Class of \u201943 (a reference to the publication date of The Fountainhead) or (ironically) the Collective, included Alan Greenspan, an economics consultant who would later head the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers (1974\u201377) and serve as chairman of the Federal Reserve (1987\u20132006).\n\n\n\nIn the late 1950s, with Rand\u2019s permission, Branden established a business designed to teach the basic principles of objectivism to sympathetic readers of Rand\u2019s novels. The Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), as it was later called, offered courses in objectivism in New York and distributed tape-recorded lectures by Branden to \u201cobjectivist centers\u201d in various other cities. Despite its outward appearance as an educational institution, NBI did not permit its students to think critically about objectivism or to develop objectivist ideas in novel ways. Through the success of NBI, Branden would eventually become the public guardian of objectivist orthodoxy against innovation or unauthorized borrowing by objectivist sympathizers, especially among the growing student right. In 1962 Branden and Rand launched the monthly Objectivist Newsletter (renamed The Objectivist in 1966). Meanwhile, Rand\u2019s fame grew apace with the brisk sales of her novels. She was invited to speak at numerous colleges and universities and was interviewed on television talk shows and on the news program 60 Minutes. Growing into her role as a public intellectual, she published her first work of nonfiction, For the New Intellectual, largely a collection of philosophical passages from her fiction, in 1961. The Virtue of Selfishness (1964) and Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal (1966) were drawn mostly from lectures and newsletter articles.\n\n\n\nIn 1968 Rand learned that Branden, with whom she had been having an intermittent affair (with their spouses\u2019 knowledge) since 1954, was involved in a romantic relationship with a younger woman. Accusing him of betraying objectivist principles, she stripped him of his partnership in The Objectivist and demanded that he surrender control of NBI, which was soon dissolved. The closing of the institute freed various self-described objectivists to publicly develop their own interpretations of Rand\u2019s philosophy - all of which, however, she rejected as perversions or plagiarism of her ideas. She was especially incensed at the use of objectivist vocabulary by young libertarians, whom she accused of disregarding morality and flirting with anarchism.\n\n\n\nIn 1971 Rand ceased publication of The Objectivist and replaced it with the fortnightly Ayn Rand Letter, which appeared with increasing irregularity until 1976. In 1974 she underwent surgery for lung cancer. Although she recovered, she never again had the energy to pursue large-scale writing projects. In 1979 she published Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, a collection of philosophical articles originally written in 1967. She was working on an adaptation of Atlas Shrugged for a television miniseries - eventually unrealized - when she died.\n\nAchievements Ayn Rand remains a significantly influential philosopher among libertarians and American conservatives. Today, her books have sold in the millions, and she\u2019s the subject of an Oscar-nominated documentary, a U.S. postage stamp, university courses, and a philosophical society devoted to the study of her thought.\n\n\n\nAyn Rand has been a major inspiration for the Tea Party movement, which has swept a new generation of Republicans and self-described conservatives into power.\n\nReligion When asked about religion, Rand answered: \"Qua religion, no - in the sense of blind belief, belief unsupported by, or contrary to, the facts of reality and the conclusions of reason. Faith, as such, is extremely detrimental to human life: it is the negation of reason. But you must remember that religion is an early form of philosophy, that the first attempts to explain the universe, to give a coherent frame of reference to man's life and a code of moral values, were made by religion before men graduated or developed enough to have philosophy.\"\n\nPolitics Rand was a thinker forged in the Russian revolution, which happened in her home city of St. Petersburg when she was around 12. Her family\u2019s property was confiscated in the revolution. It happened at a formative moment of her life: She looked at the ideas of the Russian Revolution, which were equality and fairness, in the name of the people, and she saw that they led, in the experience of her family, to the seizure of their property. And she decided these ideals - fairness, equality, justice - were really just a cover for the state being able to do what it wanted and to trample over the rights of the individual.\n\n\n\nSo Rand was born as an individualist philosopher at that moment, in late 1917, early 1918, and then her ideas continued to develop in the context of the Cold War. And she began to see a global struggle between individualism, embodied in countries like the United States and the capitalist system, and collectivism, embodied in Soviet Russia, which she knew best, but also in Nazi Germany. So she fled Russia as a young woman and came to the United States.\n\n\n\nRand's political view's emphasized individual rights, she considered laissez-faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her opinion it was the only system based on the protection of those rights.\n\n\n\nOn the level of concrete policy, Rand defended a woman\u2019s right to abortion and was a four-square supporter of freedom of speech (both \u201cliberal\u201d causes). She also attacked racism ( a \u201cliberal\u201d bugbear) as grossly collectivist. However, she rejected affirmative action policies (the favored \u201cliberal\u201d solution) for exactly the same reason.\n\n\n\nRand's rejection of what she deemed to be \"primitivism\" extended to the Middle East peace process in the 1970s. Following the Arab-Israeli War of 1973, Rand denounced Arabs as \"primitive\" and \"one of the least developed cultures\" who \"are typically nomads\". Consequently, Rand contended Arab resentment for Israel was a result of the Jewish state being \"the sole beachhead of modern science and civilization on their (Arabs) continent\" while decreeing that \"when you have civilized men fighting savages, you support the civilized men, no matter who they are.\"\n\nViews Ayn Rand is the founder of the philosophy of objectivism. She described it in an appendix to Atlas Shruggedas as \"the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.\" In novels such as The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, Rand dramatized her ideal individual, the producer who lives by his own effort and does not give or receive the undeserved, who honors achievement and rejects envy. Rand laid out the details of her world-view in nonfiction books such as The Virtue of Selfishness and Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal. The following overview will give you a solid foundation in the basics of her ideas.\n\n\n\nAyn Rand\u2019s philosophy begins by embracing the basic fact that existence exists. Reality is, and in the quest to live we must discover reality\u2019s nature and learn to act successfully in it. To exist is to be something, to possess a specific identity. This is the Law of Identity: A is A. Facts are facts, independent of any consciousness. No amount of passionate wishing, desperate longing or hopeful pleading can alter the facts. Nor will ignoring or evading the facts erase them: the facts remain, immutable.\n\n\n\nIn Rand\u2019s philosophy, reality is not to be rewritten or escaped, but, solemnly and proudly, faced. One of her favorite sayings is Francis Bacon\u2019s: \"Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed.\" Reality - that which exists - has no alternatives, no competitors, nothing \"transcending\" it. To embrace existence is to reject all notions of the supernatural and the mystical, including God.\n\n\n\nConcerning morality, Rand argues, that its purpose is to teach us what is in our self-interest, what produces happiness. \"Man has,\" she observes, \"no automatic code of survival... His senses do not tell him automatically what is good for him or evil, what will benefit his life or endanger it, what goals he should pursue and what means will achieve them, what values \u200b\u200bhis life depends on, what course of action it requires.\" This is what the science of ethics studies - and what Objectivism offers. \"Man must choose his actions, values \u200b\u200band goals,\" she summarizes, \u201cby the standard of that which is proper to man - in order to achieve, maintain, fulfill and enjoy that ultimate value, that end in itself, which is his own life.\"\n\n\n\nShe thought capital punishment was morally just, but legally dangerous - because of the possibility of jury errors which could not be rectified after the death of the innocent man. She had no position on whether there should be a death penalty or not.\n\n\n\nRand acknowledged Aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend \"three A's\" - Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayn Rand. Quotations: \"An individualist is a man who says: 'I'll not run anyone's life - nor let anyone run mine. I will not rule nor be ruled. I will not be a master nor a slave. I will not sacrifice myself to anyone - nor sacrifice anyone to myself.'\"\n\n\n\n\"There is no difference between communism and socialism, except in the means of achieving the same ultimate end: communism proposes to enslave men by force, socialism - by vote. It is merely the difference between murder and suicide.\"\n\n\n\n\"What is greatness? I will answer: it is the capacity to live by the three fundamental values of John Galt: reason, purpose, self-esteem.\"\n\n\n\n\"Even if smog were a risk to human life, we must remember that life in nature, without technology, is wholesale death.\"\n\n\n\n\"The worst evil that you can do, psychologically, is to laugh at yourself. That means spitting in your own face.\"\n\n\n\n\"Man - every man - is an end in himself, not a means to the ends of others; he must live for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself; he must work for his rational self-interest, with the achievement of his own happiness as the highest moral purpose of his life.\"\n\n\n\n\"There is no such thing as duty. If you know that a thing is right, you want to do it. If you don't want to do it - it isn't right. If it's right and you don't want to do it - you don't know what right is and you're not a man.\"\n\n\n\n\"The highest thing in a man is not his god. It's that in him which knows the reverence due a god. You are my highest reverence.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am. I think. I will.\"\n\n\n\n\"Anyone who fights for the future, lives in it today.\"\n\n\n\n\"I shall choose friends among men, but neither slaves nor masters. And I shall choose only such as please me, and them I shall love and respect, but neither command nor obey. And we shall join our hands when we wish, or walk alone when we so desire.\"\n\n\n\n\"In the temple of his spirit, each man is alone.\"\n\n\n\n\"Racism is the lowest, most crudely primitive form of collectivism.\"\n\nPersonality Ayn Rand was highly intelligent, passionate about ideas, and strongly idealistic. She was known for having a fierce temper. She drove herself on a ruthless schedule: she worked seven days a week, for as many hours each day as she was able to write. It was not unusual for her to eat dinner at midnight.\n\n\n\nVirginia Postrel, cultural critic, former Reason editor and author of several books including The Power of Glamour: Longing and the Art of Visual Persuasion, called Rand \"very much a woman of her time.\"\n\n\n\n\"Her taste and personal style combined modernist design ideals with the movie glamour of the 1920s and '30s. They expressed who she wanted to be and how she wanted the world to be: scientific, strong, streamlined, and modern,\" Postrel said in an interview with The Atlas Society (TAS).\n\n\n\nWhile many view Rand as an iconoclast, \"her ideals of luxury in clothing and interior design are straight out of the costumes and sets of 1930s movies.\" Postrel said, and these styles showed up on her characters as well. Dagny Taggart, the executive heroine of Atlas Shrugged, notably wore a one-shouldered black evening gown that featured a cape that covered just one arm and shoulder. Physical Characteristics: Ayn Rand was of average build with her height being approximately 5' 2\" (157 cm). She had dark brown hair and dark brown eyes. Quotes from others about the person \"A passionate hater of religion, Rand founded a cult around her own person, complete with rituals of excommunication; a passionate believer in rationality and logic, she was incapable of seeing the contradictions in her own work. She was a rationalist who was not entirely rational; she could not distinguish between rationalism and rationality. Of narrow aesthetic sympathies, she laid down the law in matters of artistic judgment like a panjandrum; a believer in honesty, she was adept at self-deception and special pleading. I have rarely read a biography of a writer I should have cared so little to meet.\" - Theodore Dalrymple\n\n\n\n\"[Her work] is both angry and exaltedly idealistic, a tortured hymn to integrity. In it one sees the union of passionate idealism with a profound scorn for those who\u2026 renounce the responsibility of translating their ideals into action and reality.\" - Barbara Branden\n\n\n\n\"I believe Ayn Rand's first love poem went: Roses are red/ violets are blue/ finish this poem yourself / you dependent parasite.\" - Stephen Colbert\n\n\n\n\"Ayn Rand is one of those things that a lot of us, when we were 17 or 18 and feeling misunderstood, we'd pick up. Then, as we get older, we realize that a world in which we're only thinking about ourselves and not thinking about anybody else, in which we're considering the entire project of developing ourselves as more important than our relationships to other people and making sure that everybody else has opportunity \u2013 that that's a pretty narrow vision.\" - Barack Obama\n\n\n\n\"There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old\u2019s life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world.

She was 77.\n\nThe Russian-born Miss Rand, an American citizen since 1931, was found in her apartment on Manhattan's East Side in the early afternoon. Death was attributed to natural causes, but no details were immediately available.\n\n\"The Fountainhead,\" published in 1943, was the work that established her reputation and appeared to embody her philosophy, which has been described as a sort of romantic selfishness.\n\nAn unconventional novel of ideas, the book has as its hero a brilliant, iconoclastic architect who demolishes one of his own buildings because scorned planners had corrupted the purity of its design.\n\n\"When I am questioned about myself,\" Miss Rand wrote in a letter to the readers of the book, \"I am tempted to say, paraphrasing Roark: 'Don't ask me about my family, my childhood, my friends or my feelings. Ask me about the things I think.' \"\n\nMiss Rand asserted that it is the \"content of a person's brain, not the accidental details of his life, that determines his character. My own character is in the pages of 'The Fountainhead' . . . \"\n\n\"The Fountainhead,\" along with \"Atlas Shrugged,\" which was published in 1957, and appeared to glorify capitalism, served as texts for the objectivist movement led by Miss Rand. Objectivists appeared to adhere and aspire to a form of rugged individualism that rejected the doctrines of present-day conservatives and liberals. Her fictional characters, such as the architect Howard Roark, as well as John Galt, the industrialist hero of \"Atlas Shrugged,\" reflected Rand's concept of objectivism.\n\nBorn in 1905 in St. Petersburg, now Leningrad, into a prosperous Jewish mercantile family, she was determined and independent from the start. \"I decided to be a writer at the age of nine,\" she once said. \"It was a specific, conscious decision--I remember the day and the hour.\"\n\n\"I left home when I was quite young,\" she said, \"and have been on my own ever since . . . My life has been 'single-tracked' or anything anyone wishes to call a life consciously devoted to a conscious purpose.\n\n\"I have no hobbies,\" she went on. \"I have few friends. I do not like to 'go out,' \" she added in the letter to the readers. \"I am unbearable--to myself and others--when I stay too long away from my work.\"\n\nShe said nothing else ever mattered to her very much except her husband, Frank O'Connor, to whom \"The Fountainhead\" is dedicated. The book was later made into a film starring Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal.\n\nShe came to the United States in the 1920s after graduating from college in the Soviet Union. Although college educated, she said, she was never trained in literature or writing, and \"whatever I learned I had to learn by myself and in my own way.\"\n\nShe said she did not attempt to write professionally until she felt sure of herself, then sold the first film story, the first stage play and the first novel she ever wrote. The film story was bought by Universal Pictures. The play was produced on Broadway in the 1935-36 season as \"The Night of January 16th\" and the novel was \"We, The Living\" (1936).\n\nIn calling for a return to the principles of the Founding Fathers, Miss Rand asserted that man's right to his own life, liberty and pursuit of happiness meant his \"right to exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself . . . \""}]}
