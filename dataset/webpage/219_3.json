Ever since he was a kid, he followed the belief that humans are supposed to live the way they used to live thousands of years ago, in their primitive state, but as he grew up, most of his beliefs faded.\n\nAndy Hurley was born Andrew John Hurley in Wisconsin on 31st May 1980 and lost his father when he was just 5. His mother took care of him for the rest of his childhood and teenage. Andy had saxophone as his very first musical instrument that he learned playing well and along with that, he also played percussion in his school\u2019s marching band.\n\nRecommended Lists:\n\nCareer\n\nAndy\u2019s introduction to professional music happened back when he was in the high school and was slowly gaining interest in playing drums. The year was 1996 and Andy was searching for opportunities to play with some big bands and in the pursuit of his dreams, he became part of several hardcore punk and heavy metal bands such as Killtheslavemaster, Racetraitor, Project Rocket and The Kill Pill. He was unable to find his true calling and kept trying different bands during this time.\n\nThe hardcore metal was getting popular in the late 90s and Andy\u2019s drumming skills got him gigs here and there but nothing concrete was coming across his way. However, things changed for the best in the year 2003, when one of his best high school friends Pete Wentz invited Andy to be a part of their band which was called the Fall Out Boy as they were in dire need of an additional drummer due to some troubles with their previous one, and it didn\u2019t take Andy much time to become a regular with Fall Out Boy.\n\nHis association with the band was extremely successful and despite the fact that this was the fourth band Andy was in, he got the fame in such a short time which he wasn\u2019t able to achieve through his previous stints in more than 5 years. Andy recorded the album \u2018Take This To Your Grave\u2019 with the band Fall Out Boy in 2003 to a mega universal success which helped Andy to become one of the hottest drummers around.\n\nIt was the first album by the band which was considered to be an actual hit and the band was reported by the media outlets to be the next big thing. The success continued with their next album titled \u2018From Under the Cork Tree\u2019, which climbed at the 9th spot in the Billboard 200 chart and the band spent the year 2005 touring around with their new found success. The album later went on to earn a Grammy nomination for the best New Artist.\n\nThe next two studio albums by the band titled \u2018Infinity on High\u2019 and \u2018Folie a Deux\u2019 also went on to achieve mega success in their concerts and digital downloads. However, Wentz faced severe emotional trouble during that time which also included a failed suicide attempt. It was being said that he is unable to handle the new found success the band was having and that, among several other things, led the band to take a break for some time in 2009.\n\nAndy got himself busy with several other projects and played for different bands such as a heavy metal band The Damned Things. The band was mostly a collaborative effort and featured members from Fall Out Boy, Anthrax and Every Time I Die and released their very first album titled \u2018Ironiclast\u2019. Enabler, another hard core band, hired Andy and in summer 2012, Enabler released their first album with Andy as a drummer titled \u2018All Hail the Void\u2019.\n\nLater in 2012, Andy joined a straight edge hard rock band named FocusedXminds, and during that time, media speculations were ripe about Fall Out Boy making a comeback and it was said that Andy will leave FocusedXminds when that happens. Fall Out Boy made a reappearance onto the musical sky in 2013, but Andy continued his association with FocusedXminds."}, {"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/andrew-hurley-mn0003612703/biography", "page_content": "Biography Andrew Hurley Follow Artist +\n\nDrummer Andy Hurley was born on May 31, 1980, in Milwaukee, WI, and, after his father passed away at age five, was brought up in the Midwest by his nurse mother.

The album was a pop-punk masterpiece that established Hurley as a force to be reckoned with behind the kit - equal parts Travis Barker and Dave Lombardo.\n\nThe band went on to achieve monumental success with follow-up album From Under The Cork Tree, which spawned mega hit Sugar We\u2019re Goin Down, followed by Infinity On High and Folie \u00e0 Deux. While shy guy Andy wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the ever-increasing limelight, he let his memorable drum parts do the talking. By 2010 Fall Out Boy were burned out and a three-year hiatus was quickly announced.\n\nAndy fed his passion for heavy metal and hardcore punk, recording and touring with bands including Enabler and Earth Crisis, and forming heavy rock band The Damned Things with Trohman. Andy still uses downtime from Fall Out Boy to play with hardcore band, Sect. Fall Out Boy returned refreshed and fighting fit in 2012, releasing three chart-topping albums in a row, culminating in this year\u2019s Mania.\n\nWhile the band\u2019s sound has evolved through the years, their core DNA remains, and Fall Out Boy continue to sell out arenas around the world. We hooked up with Andy Hurley during the recent UK tour to learn more about the band\u2019s incredible journey.\n\nYou joined Fall Out Boy around 2003. What were the circumstances surrounding that?\n\n\u201cI was in hardcore bands with Pete [Wentz] for years. At the time I was going to college and playing in three bands. That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t ask me to join when they first started, but they needed someone to fill in for a tour and then they were recording some demos.\n\n\"The guy producing it, Sean O\u2019Keefe who also produced Take This To Your Grave, asked if I could play on them. I loved the music they were making. The music being written for the demos, which became Take This To Your Grave, was the best stuff I had ever been a part of.\u201d\n\nHow would you describe your drumming at the time?\n\n\u201cI think I reached my peak back then and I\u2019ve been coasting on that for 15 years! Not really. I think that\u2019s probably when I started coming into my own as a drummer, being in bands and figuring out how to play with a band. Joining Fall Out Boy was the best education for that.\u201d\n\nDid you have much recording experience before Take This To Your Grave?\n\n\u201cI\u2019d recorded with a few projects, but never anything like that. We recorded a lot of it in Madison, at Butch Vig\u2019s studio [Smart Studios]. It was the biggest studio and the biggest thing we\u2019d done. There was a microphone that Kurt Cobain used in that studio! Everything I\u2019d done [before that] was with friends, or in much smaller studios.\u201d\n\nWhat did you learn from the experience?\n\n\u201cConfidence. For a long time, even on From Under The Cork Tree and Infinity On High, I had doubts that I could play anymore. From Under The Cork Tree was the first major label record we did, so that was an even bigger thing than Take This To Your Grave. I guess Take This To Your Grave was the beginning of finding comfort - of knowing what I\u2019m doing and not over thinking it.\u201d\n\nFrom collaborating so much I\u2019m better at hearing what the core DNA rhythm is in a song\n\nBetween Take This To Your Grave and Mania, Fall Out Boy\u2019s sound has evolved. Would you say your drumming has developed in tandem with that?\n\n\u201cMaybe a little. After the hiatus there was a bigger tweak. I think it follows with being in a band with songwriters who have specific ideas. Both Joe [Trohman] and Patrick [Stump] have certain things they want accented on the drums, so every aspect of every song is a collaborative thing.\n\n\"I might have an idea for a kick pattern and it totally goes against the vocal pattern. I think the evolution is just being more subservient to what the song requires. On Mania, it\u2019s the most real drums you\u2019ll hear on songs in the modern Fall Out Boy era. On the last couple of records there\u2019s drums for the whole thing, but a lot of times they\u2019re mixed with drum loops or cut up.\u201d\n\nFrom Under The Cork Tree and Infinity On High are the band\u2019s biggest-selling albums. What do you remember about the writing and recording and did you have an inkling they were going to be hits?\n\n\u201cI think we knew that we\u2019d written some great songs and a great album, but I don\u2019t think we had any idea it would be as big as it was. I think it was just a belief that this is the best work we\u2019ve done to this point. You can rally behind that.\n\n\u201cThere was a moment in the recording of Sugar We\u2019re Goin Down where Patrick did a take of a harmony or something and there was just a look when he came into the booth where we were like, \u2018This is a hit!\u2019 He\u2019s got an amazing voice and I think that is a big reason for our success. He\u2019s just so talented. Obviously, that\u2019s all bluster and jokes in the studio; you have no idea if anyone will care.\u201d\n\nDid those two albums come together fairly easily?\n\n\u201cCork Tree... and Infinity... took work. Sugar\u2026 went through a lot of different iterations before it became the song that it was. The original verse I remember I hated. The idea for what the verse became happened last minute, right before recording. That saved it for me.\n\n\"There was a lot of stuff that we had to hash out in the rehearsal space for both albums. I don\u2019t really hear the songs until I\u2019m in the studio now. It\u2019s become much more on the fly, which I really love. I think different ideas come to me more than if I had the time to do what I\u2019d normally feel like doing. It\u2019s more instinctive.\u201d\n\nThe drum parts are a key element of Fall Out Boy\u2019s sound. How much input comes from the other guys?\n\n\u201cPatrick is a drummer and so he\u2019s big on specific rhythms and patterns. And Joe, with The Damned Things stuff - there were a lot of specific things he wanted. Other bands I\u2019ve played in recently have had people who were either drummers or really adept at writing drum parts in their demoing.\n\n\"I really like when there\u2019s a specific thing that someone wants to hear. I think that from collaborating so much I\u2019m better at hearing what the core DNA rhythm is in a song to begin with.\u201d\n\nDo you remember a point at which things were getting noticeably bigger for Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cI guess it was the Warped Tour in 2005, the year From Under The Cork Tree came out. That was us and My Chem. It was the year where it was getting pretty crazy. Even the year before, we had a show on some really small stage, I think it was in Detroit, and the crowd was too big and they knocked the fence down.\n\n\"There were a few shows like that here and there, but that year of Warped Tour was where every show felt like that.\u201d\n\nThen things went stratospheric! You seem a fairly private guy. How comfortable did you feel with the limelight?\n\n\u201cIt was something you get used to. I definitely don\u2019t like photoshoots, but I\u2019m pretty comfortable with it now. For stuff like [drum magazines] it\u2019s just me, but with the full band it\u2019s a little easier because I can be the fourth person in the group and don\u2019t necessarily have to carry it. That\u2019s usually Pete. He\u2019s really photogenic and good at that stuff.\u201d\n\nThe size of gigs changed dramatically too...\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing Sect shows during any off-time from Fall Out Boy. The weekend before we came out here I was in the midwest for three shows. We played a VFW [Veterans of Foreigh Wars] hall, a basement and a small club.\n\n\"To be honest, that actually makes me more nervous than playing an arena. I\u2019m used to [big shows]. I can\u2019t focus on any one person. A basement show, where there\u2019s going to be at most 50 people, I can see everyone and any mistakes are bigger because I\u2019m right in front of them.\n\n\"I\u2019m more comfortable because I feel more plugged into something at a smaller show, but I also feel like I have to play better. Actually, I don\u2019t have to worry about a lot of stuff at a show this size, whereas I worry a lot about the Sect shows because I have to make sure I have a kit, bring a snare and cymbals. I\u2019ll confess, I\u2019ve forgotten sticks once before! That\u2019s all coming from a situation where I don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d\n\nWhich drum parts would you say define your playing in Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cTake This To Your Grave is the one where I was trying to emulate Travis Barker and guys like that the most. I was playing more beats that go around the kit.\n\n\"I think there\u2019s stuff on Mania in terms of fills or just a stripped-down beat that I\u2019m most proud of. Last year my big inspiration in terms of drumming was Danzig\u2019s Chuck Biscuits. I think he\u2019s just one of the best drummers because he\u2019s so hard hitting. He\u2019s playing exactly what\u2019s needed.\n\n\"His fills, while simple, are better than a fill I would choose to do. I was a Dave Lombardo-influenced drummer growing up, so I tried to call Chuck\u2019s spirit into my playing more on Mania.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve played on plenty of hardcore and metal albums too. What do you consider to be your drumming highlights outside of Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cI think the Enabler record has a lot of stuff I\u2019m really proud of. Sect is probably the highlight of my musical career. The last record we did, which came out last year, is called No Cure For Death. Stylistically, what\u2019s being played is really fun, it\u2019s fast and fill-y and double bass-y and blast beat-y. But it\u2019s also about the people in it.\n\n\"There\u2019s a guy from Earth Crisis, who were one of my favourite bands growing up. The singer was in Cursed, which is my favourite hardcore band. They\u2019re also a vegan straight-edge band, which is important to me.\u201d\n\nFall Out Boy took a break between 2010 and 2012, during which time you stayed busy with a number of different music projects. Was it important to do things that were completely removed from FoB?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the impetus was that it needed be different, I think it was just about doing stuff. The hiatus was really difficult because you become so institutionalised to having a schedule laid out for a year and a half to two years. When you don\u2019t have anything, at that time it was really difficult for me. It was depressing.\n\n\"You spend all this time on tour being like, \u2018I just wish I was home and had nothing to do.\u2019 Then you have nothing to do for two weeks and you\u2019re like, \u2018I have no idea what to do with my life.\u2019\n\n\u201cA lot of cool opportunities came. That\u2019s where I met Earth Crisis through a mutual friend who was managing them and I filled in on a tour. Then I did the Enabler record and some tours with that. The Damned Things was the big one. That was awesome. I think that more just speaks to the fact that heavy metal and hardcore is the kind of music I grew up with.\u201d\n\nDid you take time to work on your playing during that period?\n\n\u201cNo. I met Tomas Haake from Meshuggah and asked him what he does to warm up or practise at home. He said, \u2018Nothing\u2019. When he\u2019s off he goes fishing. He doesn\u2019t touch drums. That\u2019s the case for me.\n\n\"On the hiatus I was playing a lot more with friends\u2019 bands and staying busy with that. Tomas said that he got to a place where he could play what he wants to play and then coasted, I guess.\n\n\"I can play all the kinds of music I want to play and that\u2019s what I love about music. I\u2019ve never been a dude who\u2019s practising every day to play crazier stuff.\n\n\u201cMy drum tech, Brandon, plays in this band Misery Signals. He\u2019s the best drummer I know. He\u2019s so technically proficient. He practises every day for two hours. He\u2019s always pushing himself to be better. I\u2019ve just never had that drive. But that\u2019s not to say that when there\u2019s something I want to play in a band and I\u2019m not able to nail it I won\u2019t practise and really work on things.\u201d\n\nDid you return to Fall Out Boy with renewed vigour?\n\n\u201cTotally. We couldn\u2019t come back putting out the same records and we wouldn\u2019t want to. That challenge to evolve with the times is fun and it keeps things interesting. I definitely think the break cleared my palette so I could plug in to the new form that Fall Out Boy existed in easier than if I wasn\u2019t doing these projects that let me loose.\n\n\u201cOn the Sect and Enabler records I\u2019d do takes of just fills - just filling through a whole song and figuring out what works best. It\u2019s interesting because coming back from hiatus, that\u2019s what I did for Fall Out Boy. I\u2019d do takes of just the beat that\u2019s going to be mixed with a loop or whatever and then we\u2019d do takes of fills, just to see if something comes out of it.\u201d\n\nA lot of bands that came up at the same time as Fall Out Boy are no longer about. You guys are still releasing Number 1 albums and selling out big venues. What do you think it is that keeps people coming back for more?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really thankful for the opportunity and the fact that people still care. I don\u2019t really fully understand why. We try to evolve and push our boundaries, because we want to and because it\u2019s a challenge to us to do something different every time while maintaining the DNA that makes us who we are. Maybe that\u2019s something that speaks to people, the fact that we\u2019re still inspired to make music that we love.\u201d\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t joined Fall Out Boy, what would you be doing today?\n\n\u201cI just watched an interview with [Star Wars actor] John Boyega on Desus and Mero\u2019s podcast. It\u2019s called Bodega Boys. They just talk about pop culture stuff. They asked John Boyega what he\u2019d be doing if he wasn\u2019t acting and he said, \u2018This is what I\u2019d be doing\u2019. This was his one option, there was no plan B. I feel the same way. If I\u2019m not doing this I\u2019ll be dead. If I wasn\u2019t in this band I\u2019d be in another band, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.altpress.com/10-artists-who-contributed-to-their-band-before-officially-joining/", "page_content": "While some bands have miraculously played for decades without a lineup change, most have had to replace a member or two throughout their tenure.\n\nWe see it all the time, though it's not always as staggering as, say, Matt Skiba stepping into a Tom DeLonge-shaped void.

At The Disco)\n\nBefore Dallon Weekes was making indie-pop waves with iDKHOW, he'd spent part of the 2010s as a full-time member of Panic! At The Disco. Prior to officially taking over for Jon Walker in a medley of different roles, however, he'd served as a touring musician behind Brendon Urie and Spencer Smith. He became an official member in 2010, contributing to Too Weird To Live, Too Rare To Die! before reverting back to a touring member in 2015 and departing in 2017.\n\nTaylor York (Paramore)\n\nAt this point, it's nearly impossible to imagine Paramore without Taylor York. Believe it or not, though, the legendary guitarist didn't officially join the band until the Brand New Eyes era. But don't think that makes him anything less than foundational. York actually co-wrote with Hayley Williams on her first song with the band, \"O Star.\" He's also credited as a composer on \"Conspiracy.\"\n\nMarshal Dutton (Hinder)\n\nVocalist Marshal Dutton notably stepped into Hinder in 2015\u2014nearly 15 years after their inception. But did you know that he'd been contributing to the outfit since 2010? Dutton co-produced the two albums preceding his addition, 2010's All American Nightmare and 2012's Welcome To The Freakshow. He also provided backing guitar, percussion, keyboards and vocals on the former.\n\nRead more: 10 bands that ultimately morphed into the ones we know today\n\n\n\nTr\u00e9 Cool (Green Day)\n\nWould you believe that Tr\u00e9 Cool was ever anything less than a Green Day staple? Yeah, we were shocked, too. As it turns out, though, the iconic drummer had originally been hired on as a temporary fill-in following their debut. At the time, he'd also been playing in a punk band called the Lookouts. By the time they released their sophomore studio album, Kerplunk!, though, he'd become a permanent fixture.\n\nJohn Collura (The Ataris)\n\nThe Ataris have had enough guitarists to fill out two full bands and then some. That said, John Collura had the longest run by a mile, spanning most of the 2000s. Prior to stepping in to replace Marco Pe\u00f1a, however, Collura had spent considerable time with the band as a guitar tech.\n\nSeb Barlow (Neck Deep)\n\nWas anyone surprised when Seb Barlow formally joined Neck Deep last year? We can't imagine so. The brother of vocalist Ben Barlow, the now-bassist had been involved with the group ever since he put the founding members in contact. He's worn a number of hats over the years but notably produced their 2013 EP, A History Of Bad Decisions. He also holds writing and production credits for their debut album, Wishful Thinking, on top of providing guest vocals.\n\nRead more: 10 bands who actually started their career covering other artists\n\nTodd Morse (The Offspring)\n\nTodd Morse only officially joined the Offspring lineup as their bassist in 2019.

The multi-instrumentalist is also credited as a backing vocalist on the band's 2012 record, Days Go By.\n\nRob Felicetti (Bowling For Soup)\n\nIf you haven't gotten the idea by now, joining a band as a touring musician seems to be a gateway for success. Rob Felicetti further demonstrated the trend when he signed on with Bowling For Soup to replace Erik Chandler as their permanent bassist in 2019. The long-standing Patent Pending guitarist had been providing a variety of stage roles for BFS since the year prior.\n\nJade Puget (AFI)\n\nJade Puget gets well-deserved credit for transforming AFI when he joined in 1998. However, while Sing The Sorrow debuted his writing and production with the band, it wasn't his first contribution. The iconic guitarist had actually provided backing vocals on two of their early albums, Shut Your Mouth And Open Your Eyes and Very Proud Of Ya.\n\nRead more: 10 lyrics from the 2000s that you definitely used for a Facebook status\n\n\n\nAndy Hurley (Fall Out Boy)\n\nSeasoned Fall Out Boy member Andy Hurley may have only joined the band prior to Take This To Your Grave, but his history with the outfit goes back even further. The drummer had previously performed with Wentz under their hardcore outfit Racetraitor in the '90s. However, in the early 2000s, he'd gone on to join another band, Project Rocket.

No other band, however, could provide him with the same kind of notoriety as Fall Out Boy. Andy was a full-time member of the band until its hiatus in 2009. Andy has formerly been a member of the hardcore punk rock bands Race traitor, Kill the slave master, Project Rocket, and The Kill Pill. Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy has been a long-time buddy of Andy\u2019s, and their musical friendship dates back to their adolescent years. They\u2019ve both been in four different rock bands throughout the years. Following the breakup of Fall Out Boy in 2009, Andy joined \u2018The Damned Thing,\u2019 played briefly for another band, \u2018Enabler,\u2019 and was a member of a number of other big and small bands, producing numerous albums and singles. Fall Out Boy resurfaced in the music world in 2013 with the release of their album \u2018Save Rock and Roll.\u2019 The band went on tour and went on to achieve great success with their subsequent releases, and the band has been continuing strong ever since.\n\nChildhood and Adolescence\n\nAndy Hurley was born Andrew John Hurley on May 31, 1980, in Wisconsin, and lost his father when he was just five years old. His mother raised him throughout his youth and adolescence.\n\nAndy\u2019s first musical instrument was the saxophone, which he learned to play well, and he also played percussion in his school\u2019s marching band.\n\nIn college, he studied anthropology and history because pursuing a professional career in music was not on his agenda. He had believed since he was a child that humans should live as they did thousands of years ago, in their most primitive state, but as he grew older, most of his views disappeared.\n\nAndy\u2019s first exposure to professional music was when he was in high school, and he was gradually developing an interest in playing the drums.\n\nIn 1996, Andy was looking for possibilities to play with large bands, so he joined numerous hardcore punk and heavy metal bands, including Killtheslavemaster, Racetraitor, Project Rocket, and The Kill Pill, to pursue his aspirations. During this time, he was unable to discover his true calling and continued to experiment with other bands.\n\nIn the late 1990s, hardcore metal was becoming popular, and Andy\u2019s drumming skills landed him a few gigs here and there, but nothing substantial.\n\nHowever, things changed for the better in 2003, when one of Andy\u2019s best high school friends, Pete Wentz, offered him to join his band, Fall Out Boy, as they were in desperate need of an additional drummer owing to problems with their previous one, and Andy quickly became a regular with Fall Out Boy.\n\nDespite the fact that this was Andy\u2019s fourth band, he was able to attain a level of fame in such a short period of time that he had not been able to achieve in his prior tenure of more than five years.\n\nAndy released the album \u2018Take This To Your Grave\u2019 with the band Fall Out Boy in 2003, which became a worldwide smash hit, propelling Andy to the top of the drumming world.\n\nIt was the band\u2019s first album to be regarded as a true hit, and the band was dubbed \u201cthe next big thing\u201d by the media.\n\nThe band\u2019s popularity continued with their following album, \u2018From Under the Cork Tree,\u2019 which reached number 9 on the Billboard 200 chart, and they spent the year 2005 touring with their newfound fame. The CD was later nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist.\n\nThe band\u2019s following two studio albums, \u2018Infinity on High\u2019 and \u2018Folie a Deux,\u2019 both achieved massive success in concert and as digital downloads. Wentz, on the other hand, was going through a lot of emotional turmoil at the time, which included a failed suicide attempt.\n\nIt was claimed that he was unable to handle the band\u2019s newfound success, which, among other factors, caused the band to take a break for a period of time in 2009.\n\nAndy became involved in a number of other projects and performed with many bands, including the heavy metal outfit The Damned Things. The band was largely a collaboration, including members from Fall Out Boy, Anthrax, and Every Time I Die, and they published their debut album, \u201cIroniclast.\u201d\n\nEnabler, another hardcore band, hired Andy, and in the summer of 2012, Enabler released \u2018All Hail the Void,\u2019 their debut album with Andy as a drummer.\n\nLater in 2012, Andy joined FocusedXminds, a straight edge hard rock band. At the time, media speculation about Fall Out Boy making a comeback was rife, and it was speculated that Andy would depart FocusedXminds if that happened. In 2013, Fall Out Boy returned to the music scene, but Andy remained with FocusedXminds.\n\nFall Out Boy\u2019s next studio album, \u2018Save Rock and Roll,\u2019 was released in 2013, and it was followed by \u2018American Beauty/American Psycho,\u2019 which reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart. The band went on a global tour to promote the records and continued their winning trend.\n\nAndy\u2019s Personal Experiences\n\nAndy Hurley has been a devout vegan since the age of 16 and has always maintained the conviction that humans have damaged the planet and that we will one day live as our ancestors did 10,000 years ago.\n\nWhen asked why he doesn\u2019t live like a primitive human, he responded he has to make a livelihood one way or another.\n\nHe now has a home in Oregon, where he has kept his original drum set safe.\n\nEstimated Net worth\n\nAndy Hurley is a $14 million dollar musician and drummer from the United States.

Whatever the case may be, they are called side projects mainly because that's what they are supposed to be - a side project - instead of their main projects.\n\nThere are cases when these supposed experiments or passion projects turn into something big. Here are five big acts that started out at someone else's side project.\n\n1. Fall Out Boy\n\nPete Wentz was already a \"visible fixture\" of Chicago's local hardcore punk scene, performing in bands Birthright, Extinction, First Born. Wentz played on Racetraitor with Andy Hurley as the drummer. Wentz also played with FOB lead guitarist Joe Trohman on the metalcore act Arma Angelus. Patrick Stump played drums for local hardcore punk bands.\n\n(Photo : Fall Out Boy's YouTube Channel)\n\n\n\nWhat became Fall Out Boy actually started as an easy and escapist project for Wentz and Trohman, playing pop-punk instead of their forte hardcore punk. They later got Stump and Hurley to join, although Hurley was both busy and uninterested. Despite limited opportunities and having Wentz and Stump argue from the band's name to the songwriting, Fall Out Boy was born and the rest is history.
