In 2017, he ran with the Liberal Party of Canada and was elected as the MP for South Surrey-White Rock. He ran again in 2019 and 2021, both times losing to Conservative Kerry-Lynne Findlay.\n\nLinda Annis, the only city councillor currently representing the party founded by former mayor Dianne Watts, introduced Hogg at the launch event and in an accompanying statement. She touted his roots in the community and described him as a person of honesty and integrity, something she said would be a \"refreshing change\" at city hall.\n\nHogg took more direct shots at current Mayor Doug McCallum.\n\n\"When it comes to the election in October, the question for Surrey voters is clear: have you had enough yet, and do you believe we can do better, together?\u201d Hogg write in a statement.\n\n\"Over the past four years Surrey residents have had a tough go of it as they witnessed one man\u2019s destructive my-way-or-the-highway approach to governing.\"\n\nThe current mayor and his slate of councilors with the Safe Surrey Coalition have made a number of moves that have been slammed by critics \u2013 Annis among them \u2013 as undemocratic. Those have included a controversial bylaw on signs, abrupt ends to meetings and shutting down debate, and an attempt to suspend all new ethics complaints until after the 2022 election.\n\nBut the move to prohibit seven citizens from attending meetings was by far the most inflammatory. McCallum reversed the ban after it was challenged in court.\n\n\"When Surrey residents were banned from city hall by the mayor it made news right across the country, because that\u2019s what you expect from politicians who have given up on democracy. We cannot let that ever happen again,\u201d Hogg said, adding that part of his platform is \"giving city hall back to the people.\"\n\nMcCallum is also facing a criminal charge of public mischief, something Hogg reminds prospective voters on in his announcement.\n\nMany of these controversies can be traced back to disagreement over the move to replace the RCMP with a municipal police force.\n\nHogg describes the transition as \"divisive,\" over-budget, and behind schedule \u2013 pledging to hold a referendum on the well-underway establishment of the Surrey Police Service.\n\n\u201cWe will give people all the facts about costs so far and what it will cost to carry on, then let Surrey residents decide who will police their city,\" Hogg writes.\n\nIn addition to Annis, Hogg announced two other candidates running for council on the slate -- Bilal Cheema and Mary-Em Waddington. Hogg's statement says more candidates will be announced in the coming weeks."}, {"url": "https://www.leg.bc.ca/content/legacy/web/mla/38thparl/hogg.htm", "page_content": "38th Parliament Members\n\nat dissolution on April 14, 2009\n\nMLA: Hon.
