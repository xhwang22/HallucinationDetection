{"Zhuang of Chu was a wise and capable ruler.": [{"url": "http://chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/rulers-chu.html", "page_content": "Nov 1, 2018 \u00a9 Ulrich Theobald\n\nDon't confound his regional state of the Zhou period with the empire of Chu \u695a (926-951), one of the Ten Kingdoms \u5341\u570b (902-979) of the Five Dynasties period \u4e94\u4ee3 (907-960).\n\nThe state of Chu \u695a was a regional state of the Zhou period \u5468 (11th cent.-221 BCE). It belonged to the larger polities that were able to survive until the end of the Warring States period \u6230\u570b (5th cent.-221 BCE). Chu is known for its culture that was significantly different from that of the states of the Central Plain. Chu was not among the states that were distributed as a regional states at the beginning of the Western Zhou period \u897f\u5468 (11th cent.-770 BCE). Its ruling dynasty was of a different origin than most of the regional dynasties of the Zhou empire. Another name of Chu is Jing \u834a. Chu was first located in the valley of the River Han \u6f22 and then moved southeast into the Yangtze Valley. During the Spring and Autumn period \u6625\u79cb (770 - 5th cent. BCE) it gradually expanded towards the north and east.\n\nMap 1. The regional state of Chu \u695a (11th cent. - 223 BCE) Map according to Tan Qixiang \u8c2d\u5176\u9aa7 (1987), Zhongguo lishi ditu ji \u4e2d\u56fd\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u56fe\u96c6. Chu was located in the middle course of the Yangtze River and gradually expanded to the east and northeast. It played the role of temporary ally for the states of Qi and Qin, before the latter dominated over all regional states and founded the empire of Qin. Click to enlarge.\n\nThe semi-barbarian state of Chu becomes part of the middle kingdom\n\nThe ruling house of Chu derived its descendancy from the mythical Emperor Zhuan Xu \u9853\u980a, himself being a grandson of the Yellow Emperor \u9ec3\u5e1d. Zhuan Xu's great-grandson Zhong Li \u91cd\u9ece was the minister for fire (huo zheng \u706b\u6b63) of the mythical Emperor Di Ku \u5e1d\u56b3. For his merits earned in office, Zhong Li was bestowed the name of Zhu Rong \u795d\u878d. He was sent out to punish the rebellious lord of the waters, Gong Gong \u5171\u5de5, but Zhu Rong/Zhong Li was unable to kill Gong Gong. Enraged about this failure, Emperor Di Ku executed Zhong Li and had his brother Wu Hui \u5433\u56de take over the duties as minister of fire. Wu Hui had six grandsons that were called Kun Wu \u6606\u543e, Shen Hu \u53c3\u80e1, Peng Zu \u5f6d\u7956, Hui Ren \u6703\u4eba, Ji Lian \u5b63\u9023 and an unnamed son that was given the family name of Cao \u66f9. Five branches of the family fell into oblivion, except the descendants of Ji Lian who adopted the family name of Xiong \u718a or Mi \u7f8b (originally written \u5b2d).\n\nExcavated objects from the late Warring States period prove that the reigning dynasty of Chu also bore the family name Yan \u9153. Mi Xiong allegedly took part in King Wu's \u5468\u6b66\u738b conquest of the Shang empire \u5546 (17th-11th cent. BCE).\n\nIn the early decades of the Zhou period, King Cheng of Zhou \u5468\u6210\u738b (r. 1116-1079 BCE) made the family Mi regional rulers over the country of Chu in the middle Yangtze valley. From that time on they adopted the family name Mi, yet the rulers retained the surname Xiong. Xiong might also be a prefix of the personal name worn by all members of the family. In the late 11th century King Zhao of Zhou \u5468\u662d\u738b undertook several military campaigns against Chu during one of which he died, while his own army drowned in the River Han. The rulers of Chu called themselves \"king\" (wang \u738b) and therefore demonstrated that they were actually not part of the system of regional states of the Zhou empire.\n\nYu Xiong's great-grandson Xiong Yi \u718a\u7e79 settled near Mt. Jingshan \u834a\u5c71 (modern Nanzhang \u5357\u6f33, Hubei) and, after being appointed regional ruler (zhuhou \u8af8\u4faf) by King Cheng of Zhou, moved to Danyang \u4e39\u967d (modern Zigui \u79ed\u6b78, Hubei).\n\nViscount (zi \u5b50) Xiong Qu \u718a\u6e20 became aware that the house of Zhou was weakening and expanded his rule along the middle Yangtze valley up into the valley of River Han. He conquered the statelets of Yong \u5eb8 and Yangyue \u63da\u7cb5. He made his oldest song Wukang \u6bcb\u5eb7 king of Goutan \u53e5\u4eb6, his second son Zhihong \u646f\u7d05 king of E \u9102, and his youngest son Zhici \u57f7\u75b5 king of Yuezhang \u8d8a\u7ae0. Later on he feared that the king of Zhou would attack him because of the usurpation of the title of king and stripped his sons off their ranks as kings.\n\nAfter the death of Viscount Xiong Shuang \u718a\u971c his three sons indeed contended for the throne of Chu. The youngest son, Jixun \u5b63\u5f87 (Xiong Xun \u718a\u5f87), was finally able to occupy the throne. When Fen Mao \u86a1\u5192 (r. 758-741), also called Xiong Xun \u718a\u7734, died, his younger brother Xiong Tong \u718a\u901a assassinated the heir apparent and usurped the throne. He is posthumously called King Wu of Chu \u695a\u6b66\u738b (r. 741-690) because he carried out numerous military campaigns, like that against the statelet of Sui \u96a8, whose marquis, hoping to escape defeat, offered to Xiong Tong to travel to the court of the King of Zhou to reconfirm Xiong Tong in his royal position, but the King of Zhou declined. Enraged about the King of Zhou's refusal, Xiong Tong decided to adopt the title of king without the permission by the Son of Heaven, concluded an alliance with the marquis of Sui and occupied the territory of the hundred Pu tribes \u767e\u6fee south of the Yangtze River. Xiong Tong later suspected the marquis of Sui of treason and planned to occupy his territory, but he died en route to the battlefield.\n\nHis son Xiong Zi \u718a\u8cb2 mounted the throne. Zi is posthumously known as King Wen \u695a\u6587\u738b (r. 690-677). He was the first ruler of Chu who took residence in Ying \u90e2 (near modern Shashi \u6c99\u5e02, Hubei) instead of Danyang. Xiong Zi conquered several small states, like Xi \u606f (modern Xixian \u606f\u7e23\uff0c Henan), Shen \u7533 (modern Nanyang \u5357\u967d, Henan) and Deng \u9127 (modern Xiangfan \u8944\u6a0a, Hubei). His son Zhuang'ao \u838a\u6556 (ao was a kind of temple name, like the Chinese zong \u5b97), known as Xiong Jian \u718a\u56cf (also written \u718a\u8271), planned to kill his brother Xiong Yun \u718a\u60f2 (also written \u718a\u9835), but the latter escaped to Sui and gained sufficient support to usurp the throne of his brother. Xiong Yun is posthumously known as King Cheng \u695a\u6210\u738b (r. 672-626). Unlike his predecessors, King Cheng was a peaceful ruler who sent appropriate tributes to the court of the king of Zhou, so that he was ordered to appease the barbarian tribes of the south instead of harassing the states in the Yellow River plain.\n\nIn 656 the hegemonial lord (ba \u9738) Duke Huan of Qi \u9f4a\u6853\u516c (r. 685-643) attacked Chu, but King Cheng was able to urge his troops to stop and concluded a peace alliance (meng \u76df) in the conference of Zhaoling \u53ec\u9675 (modern Yancheng \u90fe\u57ce, Henan). In his later years King Cheng waged war against the statelets of Xu \u8a31, Xian \u5f26 (near modern Xixian, Henan), Huang \u9ec3 (modern Huanchuan \u6f62\u5ddd, Henan) and Ying \u82f1. Duke Xiang of Song \u5b8b\u8944\u516c (r. 650-637), the new hegemonial lord, dispatched an envoy to Chu to offer a peaceful alliance, but the king refused and soon attacked Song \u5b8b and defeated the duke in the battle of Hong \u6cd3 (modern Zhecheng \u67d8\u57ce, Henan) and also the state of Zheng \u912d. Duke Xiang died from a wound received during the battle.\n\nIn 634 Duke Xi of Lu \u9b6f\u50d6\u516c (r. 659-627) arrived at the court of Chu and requested an army to punish the Duke of Qi \u9f4a. King Cheng sent out the Marquis of Shen \u7533 who conquered the territory of Gu \u7a40, where Duke Huan's son Yong \u96cd was instated as the local governor. The other sons of the Duke of Qi fled to Chu and were all made nobles in Chu. The statelet of Kui \u5914 was conquered, and then King Cheng attacked the state of Song. The Duke of Song requested support by the army of Jin \u6649. King Cheng thereupon withdrew because Duke Wen of Jin \u6649\u6587\u516c (r. 636-628), had been his exiled guest for a long time, and sent only out Ziyu \u5b50\u7389 with a small contingent that was defeated.\n\nAgainst the advice of Prime Minister (lingyin \u4ee4\u5c39) Zishang \u5b50\u4e0a, King Chen nominated his beloved son Shangchen \u5546\u81e3 heir apparent. Later on he deposed Shangchen in favour to Zhi \u8077. Shangchen thereupon arrested King Cheng and forced him to commit suicide. He mounted the throne, posthumously called King Mu \u695a\u7a46\u738b (r. 626-614). His chief counsellor was Pan Chong \u6f58\u5d07. King Mu conquered the statelets of Jiang \u6c5f (modern Xixian, Henan) and Lu \u516d (a special reading, modern Lu'an \u516d\u5b89, Anhui) and attacked the state of Chen \u9673.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son L\u00fc \u4fb6, who is posthumously known as King Zhuang \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 614-591). King Zhuang did not attend the court, indulged in pleasures and even ordered to execute those who dared remonstrating against him. Wu Ju \u4f0d\u8209 thereupon used a riddle to admonish him, but without success. Only Su Cong \u8607\u5f9e was able to open the king's eyes so that he started caring for political matters again. During his campaign against the Rong barbarians \u620e of Luhun \u9678\u6e3e, King Zhuang visited the capital of the kings of Zhou in Luoyang \u6d1b\u967d (modern Luoyang, Henan) and was received by royal grandson Man \u738b\u5b6b\u6eff. The latter convinced him that the Heavenly Mandate (tianming \u5929\u547d) of the Zhou dynasty had not yet ended, in spite of the obvious weakness of the royal house.\n\nIn 597 Chu defeated the army of Jin near Bi \u90b2 (near modern Zhengzhou \u912d\u5dde, Henan). In 594 Chu besieged the capital of Song for five months and conquered the statelet of Yong \u5eb8 (near modern Zhushan \u7af9\u5c71, Hubei), later Shu-Liao \u8212\u84fc (modern Shucheng \u8212\u57ce, Anhui) and Xiao \u856d (near modern Xuzhou \u5f90\u5dde, Jiangsu).\n\nAfter the conquest of Chen, King Zhuang wanted to transform it into a district of Chu, but Shen Shu \u7533\u53d4 of Qi criticized the king, so that he reinstated the house of Chen. Yet his next step was to conquer the state of Zheng. After the lord of Zheng had begged for mercy, King Zhuang released him and created an alliance of peace. In 575 the army of Chu defeated the relieve army from Jin in the battle of Yanling \u9122\u9675 (modern Yanling, Henan). The rule of King Zhuang is seen as the apogee of the power of the state of Chu among the regional states of the Zhou period. He was accepted as hegemonial lord (ba \u9738).\n\nKing Zhuang was succeeded by his son Shen \u5be9, posthumously known as King Gong \u695a\u5171\u738b (r. 591-560). During his reign the army of Chu was defeated by Jin. The next ruler was King Gong's son Zhao \u62db, posthumously known as King Kang \u695a\u5eb7\u738b (r. 560-545). The latter was succeeded by his son Yuan \u54e1, who is also known as Jia'ao \u90df\u6556 (r. 545-541). King Kang had four younger brothers called Wei \u570d, Zibi \u5b50\u6bd4, Zixi \u5b50\u6673 and Qiji \u5f03\u75be. Wei was made Prime Minister and commander of the army. When Jia'ao fell ill, Wei entered the palace, strangulated the king and killed his sons Mo \u83ab and Pingxia \u5e73\u590f. Zibi fled to Jin, while Wei mounted the throne. He is posthumously known as King Ling \u695a\u9748\u738b (r. 541-529).\n\nChu as a major power of the Warring States\n\nKing Ling was able to assemble the regional rulers and to take over the lead as a factual hegemon of the regional states. Minister Wu Ju warned the king to become over-confident in his superior role, yet King Ling commanded the regional states in a campaign against the state of Wu \u5433. Qing Feng \u6176\u5c01, the commander of the troops of Wu, was kept prisoner, but dared criticizing King Ling for the way his fathers had come to the throne of Chu, and was therefore immediately executed by the king. He had the Zhanghua Terrace \u7ae0\u83ef\u81fa built where he received noble refugees from other states. Prince Qiji was ordered to attack the state of Chen, and King Ling invited the marquis of Cai \u8521 in order to poison him. Prince Qiji conquered the headless state of Cai and usurped the throne of the small marquisate.\n\nIn 530 BCE, King Ling attacked the small state of Xu \u5f90, located northwest of the state of Wu, and Lai \u8cf4 (modern Suizhou \u96a8\u5dde, Hubei). Chen was heavily deafeated and its dynasty brought to an end. At that moment, King Ling deliberated with his nobles whether he was strong enough to claim the same rights as the other regional rulers. Grand master (dafu \u5927\u592b) Xi Fu \u6790\u7236 answered that in old times, the state of Chu had been a very remote and less developed country, but now the King of Zhou would not refuse to bestow to the King of Chu bronze tripods as a symbol of royal power, and none of the other states would refuse to exchange gifts with the state of Chu.\n\nWhen King Ling was on campaign against Wu in the camp of Ganxi \u4e7e\u6eaa, the king of Wu was advised by Guan Cong \u89c0\u5f9e, a son of a noble of Cai whom King Ling had killed. The King of Wu joined a secret alliance with the state of Yue \u8d8a, whose nobleman Chang Shouguo \u5e38\u58fd\u904e had also been insulted by the king of Chu. Wu and Yue attacked Cai and won over Qiji, who was able to kill the heir apparent of Chu, Prince Lu \u797f. Zibi was enthroned as king of Chu, Zixi was made Prime Minister, and Qiji Minister of War (sima \u53f8\u99ac). Guan Cong thereupon travelled to the camp of King Ling and presented him with the facts of the rebellion at home. The army of Chu dispersed and left the king alone. King Ling wandered around in the wilderness and finally died of hunger because the new ruler had forbidden giving him anything to eat.\n\nThe new king, Zibi, was for a long time in an unclear state about the whereabouts of King Ling, and finally committed suicide, together with Zixi. Qiji renamed himself Xiong Ju \u718a\u5c45 and proclaimed himself king of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Ping \u695a\u5e73\u738b (r. 527-516).\n\nIn fear of revenge, King Ping demonstrated a benevolent government towards the common people and restored the territories of the states of Chen and Cai, enthroning members of the former ruling houses. The eastern parts of Chu were plundered by the armies of Wu during this interlude of internal war in Chu.\n\nKing Ping decided to marry his son, Crown Prince Jian \u5efa, with a princess from Qin \u79e6. Yet the girl was so beautiful that the king decided to take her for himself, and she gave birth to Prince Zhen \u8eeb. Grand Tutor (taifu \u592a\u5085) Wu She \u4f0d\u5962 and Junior Tutor (shaofu \u5c11\u5085) Fei Wuji \u8cbb\u7121\u5fcc intrigued against each other and instigated in the king the fear that the crown prince might prematurely usurp the throne. Prince Jian thereupon fled to the court of Song. Wu She's son Wu Zixu \u4f0d\u5b50\u80e5, who was an excellent strategist, was able to escape to the state of Wu, the arch-enemy of Chu.\n\nThe mother of Prince Jian was captured by the army of Wu when Prince Guang \u5149 of Wu was campaigning against Chen and Cai. A small border clash in Beiliang \u5351\u6881 lead to an armed conflict between Chu and Wu, in which Wu conquered the territories of Zhongli \u9418\u96e2 and Juchao \u5c45\u5de2. King Ping was so threatened that he began fortifying the capital city Ying. When King Ping died, the nobles wanted to enthrone his younger brother Prince Zixi \u5b50\u897f, but he refused, so that the under-age prince Zhen was enthroned as ruler of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Zhao \u695a\u662d\u738b (r. 516-489).\n\nAt the beginning of his reign, Prime Minister Zichang \u5b50\u5e38 took revenge for Prince Jian and Wu She and killed the intriguer Fei Wuji. The reason for this was that a many nobles had fled to Wu, where they supported the troops of Chu against the own dynasty in Chu. Yet there were also some princes of Wu escaping trouble in the own country at the court of Chu.\n\nIn 509 BCE the army of Chu, commanded by Prince Zichang, was heavily defeated by Wu in the battle of Baiju \u67cf\u8209 (modern Macheng \u9ebb\u57ce, Hubei). Wu Zixu as one of the competent military leaders of Wu even managed to conquer the capital of Chu in 506. As a revenge for the execution of his father, Wu Zixu had the tomb of King Ping desecrated. Commander Prince Zichang fled to the state of Zheng. King Zhao himself escaped to Yunmeng \u96f2\u5922 and then on to the former state of Sui, where he was hidden by his loyal courtiers and the population from the army of Wu.\n\nIn the meantime, minister Shen Baoxu \u7533\u9b91\u80e5 was sent to the state of Qin to ask for relief troops, which were indeed able to defeat the troops of Wu that had advanced far into the country of the enemy until they reached Ji \u7a37 (modern Tongbai \u6850\u67cf, Henan). Prince Fugai \u592b\u6982, brother of the king of Wu, usurped the throne on this occasion but was driven out by the righteous king and fled to the court of Chu.\n\nStill on his way back to the capital, King Zhao of Chu swallowed the state of Tang \u5510 (near modern Suizhou, Hubei), then Dun \u9813 (modern Shangshui \u5546\u6c34, Henan) and Hu \u80e1 (modern Fuyang \u961c\u967d, Anhui). There was another occasion in 504 when the army of Wu again invaded the state of Chu. Only with the death of King Hel\u00fc \u95d4\u95ad of Wu (r. 514-496) the attention of Wu was directed against the state of Yue, and the danger from the east was gone.\n\nOn his sickbed, King Zhao wanted to cede the throne to his younger brother, yet all nobles refused, before Prince Zil\u00fc \u5b50\u95ad conceded to become the successor of his brother. Yet when the King died on a campaign, the brothers decided to enthrone the king's son, Prince Zhang \u7ae0. He is posthumously known as King Hui \u695a\u60e0\u738b (r. 489-432). In 488 Prince Zixi invited the former Prince Jian's son Prince Sheng \u52dd to come back to Chu. He was granted the title of Duke Bai \u767d\u516c. Duke Bai planned to revenge his father's death, who had been killed in exile in Zheng.\n\nIn 481 BCE, the army of Jin attacked Zheng, and Zheng asked Chu for help. Instead of annihilating Zheng, commander Zixi left Zheng untouched. Duke Bai thereupon killed Zixi, Prince Ziqi \u5b50\u7da6 and Prime Minister Sima Ziqi \u53f8\u99ac\u5b50\u671f at the court and tried to kidnap King Hui. Yet the king was protected by his retainers and took refuge in the palace of the Queen Dowager of King Zhao.\n\nDuke Bai thereupon proclaimed himself king, but was assassinated by Prince Zigao \u5b50\u9ad8, called Duke Ye \u8449\u516c. In this year, Chu finally destroyed the state of Chen, in 447 the state of Cai, and in 445 the state of Qi \u675e.\n\nIn 473, the armies of Yue had finally destroyed the state of Wu. In the northern parts of Wu, along the plain of the River Huai \u6dee, Chu began to expand its territory. King Hui was succeeded by his son Prince Zhong \u4e2d, who is posthumously known was King Jian \u695a\u7c21\u738b (r. 432-408). Under his reign, Chu conquered the statelet of Ju \u8392 (modern Juxian \u8392\u7e23, Shandong) that had belonged to the territory of Qi. King Jian employed the famous military advisor Wu Qi \u5433\u8d77, who reformed the army, so that Chu was able to conquer the southern regions inhabited by the non-Chinese peoples of the Yangyue \u63da\u7cb5, namely the Dongting \u6d1e\u5ead (Hunan) and Cangwu \u84bc\u68a7 (Guizhou) regions.\n\nKing Jian was succeeded by his son Prince Dang \u7576, posthumously known as King Sheng \u695a\u8072\u738b (r. 408-402). King Sheng was killed by \"robbers\" (presumably nobles or family members) and was succeeded by his son Prince Yi \u7591, posthumously known as King Dao \u695a\u60bc\u738b (r. 402-381). Under his reign, Chu contended with the troops of the new states of Han \u97d3, Zhao \u8d99 and Wei \u9b4f, the successor states of Jin. King Dao was succeeded by his son Prince Zang \u81e7, posthumously known as King Su \u695a\u8085\u738b (r. 381-370). Because King Su had no sons, he left the throne to his younger brother Prince Liangfu \u826f\u592b, who is posthumously known as King Xuan \u695a\u5ba3\u738b (r. 370-340). At the end of the latter's reign, the armies of Qin attacked Chu. At that time, Qin was governed by counsellor Shang Yang \u5546\u9785.\n\nKing Xuan's son Prince Shang \u5546 succeeded to the throne in Chu, posthumously known as King Wei \u695a\u5a01\u738b (r. 340-329). He was able to defeat the armies of the state of Qi, which was at that time disturbed by inner quarrels. King Wei also defeated the armies of the kingdom of Yue and occupied a large part of its territory, so that Chu was now the sole state in the southern parts of China. In 306, Yue was destroyed by Chu.\n\nChu as a large but weak state between Qin and Qi\n\nWhen King Wei died, the state of Wei used this opportunity and conquered part of its northern territory. King Wei's successor was his son Prince Guai \u69d0, posthumously known as King Huai \u695a\u61f7\u738b (r. 329-299). In 323 BCE he took revenge and attacked the territory of Wei, seizing eight counties. The next military target was the state of Qi, yet at that time the military adviser Chen Zhen \u9673\u8eeb dwelled at the court of Qi and was dispatched to the camp of counsellor Zhao Yang \u662d\u967d, highest commander of the army of Chu. Chen Zhen persuaded Zhao Yang with the parable of drawing feet to a snake that he would have no advantage in defeating the army of Qi, so that Zhao Yang withdrew. At least, Chu was able to conclude an alliance with the states of Qin, Wei and Qi that was initiated by the famous diplomatist Zhang Yi \u5f35\u5100.\n\nThis alliance became important in 318 BCE, when an alliance, concluded with the help of Su Qin \u8607\u79e6, attacked the state of Qin. King Huai took over the lead of the allies and penetrated into the Hangu Pass \u51fd\u8c37\u95dc, yet the allies withdrew without forcing Qin to battle.\n\nIn 313, things had changed and Chu was in alliance with Qi. The king of Qin decided to send Zhang Yi to Chu in order to persuade King Huai to change side again and, in the end, to isolate Chu. Chen Zhen was well aware of this and warned King Huai, but he refused to accept the warning. In the end, the enraged king of Qi concluded an alliance with Qin. King Huai, on his side, made ready the troops for a campaign against Qin. Again, Chen Zhen warned the king and suggested offering Qin a city to restore the former alliance. King Huai ignored the warning, and so the army of Qin destroyed that of Chu at Danyang \u4e39\u967d in 312, captured a huge humber of troops and officers, and occupied the region of Hanzhong \u6f22\u4e2d. At Lantian \u85cd\u7530, the armies battled a second time, and the fresh defeat of Chu instigated Han and Wei to seize some more territory from Chu.\n\nA year later, Qin suggested concluding peace and sent Zhang Yi to the court of Chu. King Huai immediately arrested Zhang Yi and planned to kill him, but Zhang established contact with Jin Shang \u9773\u5c1a, who explained to King Huai that Qin would attack Chu again. He also spoke with the King's favourite, Lady Zheng Xiu \u912d\u8896, and threatened her that the king of Qin would try to purchase peace by sending beautiful girls to King Huai. The Lady then managed the release of Zhang Yi, and peace was made with Qin. Shortly after, the Chu embassador to Qi returned, Qu Yuan \u5c48\u539f, and reproached the king for not having executed Zhang Yi.\n\nIn 310 BCE, the King Min of Qi \u9f4a\u6e63\u738b (r. 324-284) sent an envoy to the court of Chu and explained that, after the death of King Hui in Qin, the situation had changed thoroughly, and suggested to conclude a common alliance with Han, Wei, Zhao and Yan \u71d5 against Qin. Zhao Ju \u662d\u96ce convinced King Huai that it was better to be part of the alliance around Qi and to win back the territory once lost to Qin. Yet in 307, King Huai decided that he could also win territory by concluding a peaceful alliance with Qin. Two years later Qin, Han and Wei attacked Chu for its betrayal of the alliance. King Huai sent his crown prince as a hostage to Qin and requested military support against the three states.\n\nIn 304, the crown prince of Chu had a private quarrel with some nobles of Qin. When he accidentally killed one of them, he fled and returned to Chu. In order to take revenge for the murder, Qin attacked Chu, supported by troops of Qi, Han and Wei, and defeated Chu at Chuisha \u5782\u6c99. A year later, Qin undertook a second campaign against Chu and heavily defeated the army of Chu. King Huai thereupon sent his crown prince as a hostage to Qi, an ally of Qin, and requested peace.\n\nOnly after a further campaign and after King Zhao of Qin had sent an urgent letter, King Huai of Chu consented to a meeting with the king of Qin at the Wuguan Pass \u6b66\u95dc. Yet King Huai did not trust Qin and feared that he might be caught in a trap. Zhao Ju suggested not to meet the king of Qin, but the King's younger son urged him to go. In the end, King Huai was escorted to Xianyang \u54b8\u967d, the capital of Qin, and was threatened to cease territory before concluding an alliance. He refused and was arrested and detained.\n\nAt home, the situation was precarious. Both the king and the crown prince were held hostages in Qin, and Zhao Ju argued that it was against etiquette to enthrone a younger son as long as the ruler was living. This meant that there was no head of government as long as King Huai was in Qin. The court brooded over the issue and finally invited Prince Heng \u6a6b to come to the capital Ying. He was enthroned as king of Ch, posthumously known as King Qingxiang \u695a\u9803\u8944\u738b (r. 299-263).\n\nThe king of Qin thereupon continued his campaigning against Chu, defeated its army, and seized territory in the north. A year later, King Huai managed to escape, but because the roads to Chu were blocked by Qin, he fled to the state of Zhao, but fearing the anger of Qin, King Huiwen of Zhao \u8d99\u60e0\u6587\u738b (r. 299-266) refused to offer protection. King Huai was finally captured by the bloodhounds of Qin and brought back to Xianyang, where he died a year later. At least, his corpse was allowed to be transferred back to his native state, where he was buried with greatest honours.\n\nIn 293 BCE, general Bai Qi \u767d\u8d77 massacred the army of Han. Threatened by this cruel way of warfare, King Qingxiang agreed to conclude a marriage of peace with Qin. This new alliance led to a campaign in 284, carried out by Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, Zhao and Yan and targeted against the state of Qi in the east. Chu so regained the region of Huaibei \u6dee\u5317. In 281, King Qingxiang was persuaded to resume war against Qin, in order to gain more territory. He first concluded an alliance with Qin and Han and planned to use this opportunity to conquer some territory of the patriarchal kings of Zhou around Luoyang. King Nan of Zhou \u5468\u738b\u8d67 (r. 315-256) thereupon sent his relative, Duke Wu \u6b66\u516c, to Zhaozi \u662d\u5b50, the counsellor of Chu. Duke Wu explained to Zhaozi that the destruction of the house of Zhou meant a thorough dissolution of the world order and would bring only chaos to the state of Chu. King Qingxiang thereupon abandoned this plan.\n\nThe campaigns against Qin continued, but in 278 BCE, general Bai Qi advanced to the capital of Chu and defiled the tombs of the kings of Chu. The capital of Chu was moved to the ancient site of Chen (modern Huaiyang \u6dee\u967d, Henan) It was only in 276 that the army of Chu was able to recover some of its core territory. Chu was even able to supporte Han, Zhao and Wei in a campaign against Yan. This was only possible because of an armistice bargained with Qin, covered by the crown prince as a hostage dwelling in Qin.\n\nWhen King Qingxiang fell ill, his son Prince Xiong Yuan \u718a\u5143 (or Wan \u5b8c) managed to escape from Qin and was enthroned as the new king of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Kaolie \u695a\u8003\u70c8\u738b (r. 263-238). The new king immediately appointed his trusted Counsellor-to-the-Left (zuoxi \u5de6\u5f92), Lord Chunshen \u6625\u7533\u541b, as Prime Minister. Under the Lord's administration, the state of Chu was able to recover for a while. The capital was first shifted to Juyang \u5de8\u967d (modern Taihe \u592a\u548c, Anhui), later to to Shouchun \u58fd\u6625 (modern Shouxian \u58fd\u7e23, Anhui) further to the east. Lord Chunshen met with Lord Xinling \u4fe1\u9675\u541b of Wei and forged an alliance that was able to defeat Qin in 257. A year later, Chu conquered the state of Lu.\n\nKing Kaolie was succeeded by his son Prince Dao \u608d (or Yu \u715c), who is posthumously known as King You \u695a\u5e7d\u738b (r. 238-228). Li Yuan \u674e\u5712, a powerful noble, used this personal change to assassinate Lord Chunshen. King You was succeeded by his younger half-brother You \u7336 (or Hao \u90dd), who is posthumously known as King Ai \u695a\u54c0\u738b (r. 228). He only ruled for two months before he was overthrown and killed by his older half-brother Fuchu \u8ca0\u82bb (r. 228-223).\n\nThe rule of the last kings of Chu was overshadowed by a growing military success of the state of Qin that succeedingly conquered the states of Han, Zhao and Wei. In 224, the Qin general Wang Jian \u738b\u7fe6 defeated the army of Chu and killed general Xiang Yan \u9805\u71d5, a great uncle of Xiang Yu \u9805\u7fbd, the eventual hegemonial king (bawang \u9738\u738b) of West Chu \u897f\u695a. A year later, Wang Jian and Meng Wu \u8499\u6b66 seized the capital of Chu, captured King Fuchu and transformed the state of Chu into a commandery of the state of Qin.\n\nThe name of Chu was often used as a name for imperial princedoms, and was one of the Ten States (Shiguo \u5341\u570b) in the 10th century.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

E.[5] Her last name was Ji, and her family came from the Fan region.[6] She married King Zhuang of Chu and became his queen in 611 B.C.E.[7] Throughout her reign as queen, her husband had many concubines. However, Queen Fanji never became jealous of his concubines and always behaved in the proper manner befitting a virtuous wife.[8] She even sought additional concubines for her husband.[9] Under her guidance, the palace remained peaceful.[10]\n\nIn the early years of King Zhuang\u2019s reign, he neglected his official duties for leisure activities such as hunting and travelling.[11] Queen Fanji constantly urged him to focus on his kingdom and to govern more efficiently.[12] However, King Zhuang appointed the inefficient Yu Qiuzi to be his prime minister.[13] Queen Fanji urged her husband to replace Yu Qiuzi with a more capable minister.[14] After much persuasion, King Zhuang replaced him with Shu Aosun.[15] Shu Aosun was known for his \u201cmorality and ability\u201d.[16] He helped Chu become a flourishing and prominent kingdom.[17]\n\nIn 601 B.C.E., King Zhuang died. The next king was Fanji\u2019s son, Xiong Shen. Facts about her later life are unknown.[18] Her tomb resides in Jiangling county. Queen Fanji was known to have been a wise advisor to the king. Through her guidance, she allowed Chu to become one of the top powers in the Spring and Autumn period.[19] Official Chu historians wrote that \u201cZhuang was able to lord it over others because Fanji made all the effort.\u201d[20] Since then, Fanji has been featured prominently in Chinese literature. Tang prime minister, Zhang Shen, wrote a poem \u201cTo Fanji\u2019s Tomb on Climbing Jin Li Tai\u201d.[21] His famous line from the poem alludes to her: \u201cChu became the lord, Fanji did the work\u201d.[22] Yu Jinfeng, a Qing administrator, wrote on her tomb that the queen was \u201cA Virtuous Lady of Ability.\u201d[23]\n\nReferences:\n\nEno, R.

His personal name was Xiong L\u00fc (Chinese: \u718a\u65c5; pinyin: Xi\u00f3ng L\u01da), his ancestral name was Mi (Chinese: \u8288; pinyin: M\u01d0), and his posthumous title was King Zhuang. He was one of the five rulers dubbed the Five Hegemons by Xunzi and attempted to wrest control of China from King Ding of Zhou.[1]\n\nThe son of King Mu of Chu, Zhuang ascended the throne in 613 BC. According to a legend in the Records of the Grand Historian, for the first three years of his reign Zhuang wasted time in pleasure seeking, but, when challenged by two courtiers, reformed his ways.[2]\n\nThe king made Sunshu Ao his chancellor. Sunshu Ao began a series of major dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir in modern-day northern Anhui province.\n\nAfter some military successes, King Zhuang attempted to usurp King Ding of Zhou. According to a well-known story, probably an invention of the Warring States period, he asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the legendary Nine Tripod Cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China, but was rebuffed. This incident gave rise to the chengyu \"to enquire about ding in the central plains\", i.e. to have great ambitions (simplified Chinese: \u95ee\u9f0e\u4e2d\u539f; traditional Chinese: \u554f\u9f0e\u4e2d\u539f; pinyin: w\u00e8n d\u01d0ng zh\u014dngyu\u00e1n).[2]\n\nIn the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the State of Jin.

BCE) is the first part of the so-called Eastern Zhou period (Dongzhou \u6771\u5468, 770-221 BCE). It is characterized by a significant decrease of political power of the kings of Zhou which had to flee to the eastern capital Chengzhou \u6210\u5468 (or Luoyi \u96d2\u9091, modern Luoyang \u6d1b\u967d, Henan) after their western and main capital Zongzhou \u5b97\u5468 (of Feng \u8c50, near modern Xi'an \u897f\u5b89, Shaanxi) had been attacked by the nomad tribes of the Quanrong \u72ac\u620e.\n\nPeriodization\n\nThe name of the historical period is derived from the chronicle of the regional state of Lu \u9b6f called Chunqiu \u6625\u79cb \"Spring and Autumn Annals\" because the seasons are always mentioned in the entries. The Annals cover the time from 722 to 481 BCE, yet the historical period is traditionally counted from the reign of King Ping of Zhou \u5468\u5e73\u738b (r. 770-720 BCE), who restored the Zhou dynasty in Luoyang, down to the division of the state of Jin \u6649 by the regional rulers (zhuhou \u8af8\u4faf) of Han \u97d3, Wei \u9b4f and Zhao \u8d99 in 376. Alternatively, the end of the Spring and Autumn period can be seen as 453, when the three viscounts (zi \u5b50) of Han, Wei and Zhao extinguished all other lateral lines to the house of Jin, or 403, when King Weilie of Zhou \u5468\u5a01\u70c8\u738b (r. 426-402) bestowed upon the viscounts of Han, Wei and Zhao the title of marquis (hou \u4faf).\n\nThe second great historiographical writing of the Spring and Autumn period is the collection Guoyu \u570b\u8a9e \"Discourses of the states\" that includes anecdotes of the states of Zhou \u5468, Lu \u9b6f, Qi \u9f4a, Jin \u6649, Zheng \u912d, Chu \u695a, Wu \u5433 and Yue \u8d8a. Said to be a composition of Zuo Qiuming \u5de6\u4e18\u660e, its oldest parts must have been compiled at the end of the 5th century BCE.\n\nConfucius\n\nThe most important intellectual person of this historical period was the philosopher Confucius (Kongzi \u5b54\u5b50; ca. 551-479) who tried to revive the ideal of the human and righteous rulers of old. Although his ideas seemed lost in a time of political realism his thoughts about state and society (\"Confucianism\") were to become the fundamental doctrine of imperial China.\n\nThe Early Decades of the Eastern Zhou and the Duke of Zheng\n\nThe eastern capital Chengzhou (Luoyang) did not provide the kings of Zhou with sufficient power. They were therefore dependent on the powerful regional rulers, especially those of Qin \u79e6, Jin, Qi and Chu. These are called the \"local rulers\" (fang bo \u65b9\u4f2f) because they practically ruled independently from the king of Zhou, and not any more as his vassals. It became common that the regional states acted on their own behalf regarding territory and military feuds, without asking the king of Zhou for formal permission. Duke Zhuang of Zheng \u912d\u838a\u516c (r. 743-701) even dared attacking King Huan \u5468\u6853\u738b (r. 720-697 BCE) who had not treated him properly according to the ritual regulations. Heijian \u9ed1\u80a9, the Duke of Zhou \u5468\u516c, even planned to kill King Huan's successor, King Zhuang \u5468\u838a\u738b (r. 697-682), and to replace him with Prince Ke \u514b. Yet Xin Bo \u8f9b\u4f2f warned the king and saved his life.\n\nDuke Zhuang of Zheng defeated intruding Rong \u620e tribes and swallowed the neighbouring state of Xu \u8a31. In 707 King Huan of Zhou \u5468\u6853\u738b (r. 719-697) started a punitive expedition against the Duke, but the king was defeated. From then on, the kings of Zhou never again tried to intervene into the politics of their own regional rulers. They stayed in their small royal domain around Luoyang and had to be content with the tributes of the regional rulers that were presented less and less regularly. Besides Zheng, the states of Song \u5b8b and Lu \u9b6f demonstrated their military and political power in the Central Plain.\n\nThe Rise of Duke Huan of Qi\n\nKing Li \u5468\u91d0\u738b (r. 682-677) was so helpless against the new threats endangering the empire that he allowed Duke Huan of Qi \u9f4a\u6853\u516c (r. 685-643) to adopt the title of hegemonial lord (ba \u9738, or bo \u4f2f). In this function the Duke defended the regional states against raids of barbarian tribes and cared for law and order among the states of the Middle Kingdom, with the motto \"support the king and ward off the barbarians\" (zun wang rang yi \u5c0a\u738b\u6518\u5937).\n\nIn the east, the state of Qi had rich natural ressources and became one of the mightiest regional states of the Eastern Zhou period.\n\nDuke Huan of Qi employed the legalist statesman Guan Zhong \u7ba1\u4ef2 as his adviser who reorganized administration and the military and financial systems. Through these reforms Qi was able to subdue Song and Lu and even the hegemonial state of Zheng. At that time, the non-Chinese nomad tribes of the Rong and Di \u72c4 undertook raids on the soil of Chinese states and devastated the states of Xing \u90a2 and Wei \u885b (modern Shanxi and Hebei). Duke Huan of Qi rescued the dynastic houses of these states and settled them down more to the south. The system of the hegemon thus developed to a kind of lord protector of a strong state over weaker ones, and Qi promised to protect the states in the Central Plain against further intrusions of the northern nomad warriors.\n\nThe Semi-Barbarian Kingdom of Chu\n\nIn the south, the state of Chu on the middle Yangtze River had become politically stronger than before. King Cheng of Chu \u695a\u6210\u738b (r. 671-626) started to challenge the hegemony of Qi and swallowed smaller states in his neighbourhood. Nonetheless, subservient states like Jiang \u6c5f and Huang \u9ec3 changed side and declared their alliance with Qi. Chu thereupon attacked Zheng. Duke Huan assembled the regional rulers and created an alliance with Lu, Song, Chen and Wei to punish Chu in 656 by devastating the state of Cai \u8521, an ally of Chu. Chu gave in, and the ambassadors of the two mighty states met at Shaoling \u53ec\u9675 (modern Yancheng \u90fe\u57ce, Henan) to conclude a peaceful alliance (meng \u76df).\n\nThe System of Hegemonial Lordship\n\nIn 651 Qi organized a meeting at Kuiqiu \u8475\u4e18 (modern Lankao \u862d\u8003, Henan) whith the representatives of Lu, Song, Zheng and Wei, and in presence of a royal diplomat from Zhou. The members of the meeting decided that states creating a friendly alliance should never attack each other, and that they had to assist each other in case that one partner was attacked. The Duke of Qi thus became the overlord over the weaker states of Zhou China and replaced the king of Zhou as the highest judicial person.\n\nSuccession Crises at the Zhou Court\n\nWhen King Li died a succession crisis endangered the house of Zhou. His righteous heir was Prince Kan \u95ac, who is known as King Hui \u5468\u60e0\u738b (r. 677-652), but his late grandfather, King Zhuang, had had a favourite son called Prince Tui \u7a68. King Hui was not a very intelligent ruler. He offended many of his highest ministers and caused a rebellion that forced him to flee to Wen \u6eab (modern Wenxian \u6eab\u7e23, Henan) and then to Li \u6adf, a town in the state of Zheng. His uncle Prince Tui was made King of Zhou, but he did not prove a better ruler. He was therefore attacked and killed by the lords of Zheng and Guo \u8662. King Hui returned to the throne.\n\nWhen King Hui died he was succeeded by his son Prince Zheng \u912d, who is known as King Xiang \u5468\u8944\u738b (r. 652-619). King Xiang had a half-brother called Shudai \u53d4\u5e36 (or Dai \u5e36), who had been the favourite son of King Hui. Prince Shudai planned to usurp the throne and joined forces with the Rong and Di \u7fdf tribes. The plot failed and Prince Shudai fled to Qi. It was a high minister of Qi, the reformer Guan Zhong, who mediated the peace treaty between the house of Zhou and the Rong tribes. A decade later the king of Zhou even allowed Prince Shudai to return.\n\nWhen the state of Zheng attacked in 639 the statelet of Hua \u6ed1, whose lords were relatives to the house of Zhou, King Xiang sent You Sun \u6e38\u5b6b and Bo Fu \u4f2f\u670d as diplomats to negotiate peace. Yet the Duke of Zheng arrested the diplomats. The King thereupon ordered the Di tribes to attack Zheng, inspite of the remonstances of minister Fu Chen \u5bcc\u8fb0. Fu Chen was also not content with the King's will to marry a Di princess in order to reward the Di chieftain for his support. His critics were justified because only a few years later King Xiang discarded the \"barbarian\" queen, which caused an attack of the Di on the royal capital, during which the Earl of Tan \u8b5a (or the earls of Yuan \u539f and Mao \u6bdb) was/were killed. Fu Chen thereupon threw himself into battle against the intruders and died. King Xiang fled to Zheng and was received by the duke of Zheng, in spite of all former discrepancies.\n\nIn the meantime Prince Dai was enthroned as King of Zhou, yet he took residence in Wen, not in Luoyang. He invited the Di queen to return to the royal domain. Two years later King Xiang asked the duke of Jin for help, who willingly attacked the usurper and executed him. King Xiang, returning to the throne, rewarded Duke Wen of Jin \u6649\u6587\u516c (r. 636-628) with the title of hegemonial lord and presented him with some territory. Duke Wen was thereafter the most powerful political leader of the Middle Kingdom and assembled the regional rulers, including his formal superior, the King of Zhou, at Heyang \u6cb3\u967d and Jiantu \u8e10\u571f. The kings of Zhou were now wholly dependent from support by other political actors. Histories nevertheless concealed this shameful situation with terms like \"royal hunt at Heyang\".\n\nThe Rise of the Regional State of Jin\n\nAfter the death of Duke Huan of Qi several regional rulers strove for overlordship. Duke Xiang of Song \u5b8b\u8944\u516c (r. 650-637) was defeated by Chu, and the state of Song lost its last chance to rise to political and military significance. Instead, the state of Jin rose to supremacy in old China: Duke Xian of Jin \u6649\u737b\u516c (r. 676-651) had already extended the power of his state by swallowing the statelets of Geng \u803f, Huo \u970d, Wei \u9b4f (a state that was later one of the three destructors of Jin), Guo \u8662 and Yu \u865e. After a decade of inner struggles, the state of Qin supported Duke Wen of Jin in his ascension to the throne of Jin.\n\nJust as Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin employed political advisors, Zhao Shuai \u8d99\u8870 (Zhao Chengzi \u8d99\u6210\u5b50) and Hu Yan \u72d0\u5043, who strengthened the \"national\" economy and so the military power of the state. In 635 the King Xiang of Zhou escaped from inner disturbances to the state of Zheng. Duke Wen of Jin saw his chance, rescued the king and accompanied him back to the royal domain, for which support he was highly rewarded by the King.\n\nThe next step for the Duke was to challenge the power of the southern, semi-Chinese state of Chu that had dominated the Central Plain since the death of Duke Huan of Qi. In 632 the two states clashed at the battle of Chengpu \u57ce\u6fee (modern Zhencheng \u7504\u57ce, Shandong), and Chu was defeated. Duke Wen of Jin established a new friendly alliance during the meeting at Jiantu \u8e10\u571f (modern Yingze \u6ece\u6fa4, Henan) with the seven most important states. In the same year, at Wen, the King of Zhou sanctified the hegemony by Jin. Duke Wen's successor Duke Xiang \u6649\u8944\u516c (r. 627-621) was able to prolong the hegemonial prevalence of the state of Jin.\n\nConflict Between Qin and Jin\n\nDuring the reign of Duke Xiang of Jin, Duke Mu of Qin \u79e6\u7a46\u516c (r. 659-621) opened a long period of military confrontation between Jin and Qin, but Qin seldomly won any battle. The powerful state of Jin blocked the gate to the Central Plain, and Qin could not but expand its territory to the west into the territory of the Western Rong tribes \u897f\u620e and establish good relations with Chu in the south. Chu meanwhile further expanded its territory by conquering the statelets of Jiang \u6c5f, Lu \u516d (a special reading!), and Liao \u84fc. After the death of Duke Xiang of Jin, the noble Zhao Dun \u8d99\u76fe (Zhao Xuanzi \u8d99\u5ba3\u5b50) dominated the throne succession of Jin, murdered Duke Ling \u6649\u9748\u516c (r. 620-607) and enthroned Duke Cheng \u6649\u6210\u516c (r. 606-600). During this period Jin lost its initiative in \"foreign\" politics. The political advisor Fan Shan \u8303\u5c71 proposed to King Mu of Chu \u695a\u7a46\u738b (r. 625-614) to take the chance and to advance against the north.\n\nThe Rise of the State of Chu\n\nKing Zhuang of Chu \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 613-591) had to resolve internal quarrels and uprisings of aboriginal tribes before he was able to reform economic and military administration and to resume this expansion politics. In 606 the southern king sent out an envoy to the court of King Ding of Zhou \u5468\u5b9a\u738b (r. 606-586) to express his will to swallow the royal domain of Zhou. In 598 King Zhuang of Chu crushed the small state of Chen \u9673, one year later the state of Zheng. At the battle of Bi \u90b2 (near modern Zhengzhou \u912d\u5dde, Henan) the army of the hegemonial state of Jin was defeated.\n\nA few years later, Chu defeated the state of Song and finally obtained the overlordship over the Central Plain. The protecting task of the overlord had gradually lost its original intention and became a system of hegemony of one major state over weak satellites of Chinese and \"barbarian\" origin. The attitude to help small states during internal quarrels and against \"barbarian\" invaders changed to a regular intervention into political affairs to the advantage of the great states.\n\nInternal Quarrels in Jin\n\nThe state of Qi observed the growing power of Chu, declared a friendly relationship with the southern king of Chu, who was the only regional ruler who called himself king, except, of course, the King of Zhou. Qi repeatedly attacked the smaller states of Lu and Wei which therefore asked for support the former hegemonial state of Jin. In 589, the army of Jin fought with Qi in the battle of An \u978d (modern Jinan \u6fdf\u5357, Shandong) and once again demonstrated its superior military power. Chu instantly declared war to Jin, but neither Chu nor Jin dared to initiate a concrete campaign.\n\nAfter long years of hesitation and negotiations (under the stipulation of Jin's political advisor Song Huayuan \u5b8b\u83ef\u5143) Chu attacked Zheng and Wei in 576. One year later the armies of the two hegemonial states fought in the famous battle of Yanling \u9122\u9675 (modern Yanling, Henan) in which Jin prevailed by a narrow margin. Duke Li of Jin \u6649\u53b2\u516c (r. 580-573) saw his chance to resume hegemony, murdered his mightiest noblemen Xi Zhi \u90e4\u81f3, Xi Qi \u90e4\u9321 and Xi Chou \u90e4\u72a8 (the \"Three Xi\" \u4e09\u90e4). Yet instead of having strengthened his own position, Duke Li faced serious opposition by the Jin aristocracy like Luan Shu \u6b12\u66f8 and Xun Yan \u8340\u5043 who eventually killed their lord.\n\nUnder the next ruler, Duke Dao \u6649\u60bc\u516c (r. 572-558), the internal situation calmed down, and the duke was able to strengthen the position of the state of Jin. His political advisor Wei Jiang \u9b4f\u7d73 proposed to appease the nomad warriors of the Rong with financial tributes instead of fighting them. In 571 Jin erected a fortification wall at Hulao \u864e\u7262 (modern Fanshui \u6c3e\u6c34, Henan) against the state of Zheng that was backed by Chu.\n\nAfter more than two decades of relative peace the political advisor Song Xiangxu \u5b8b\u5411\u620c proposed to organize a peace conference to end military conflict. It was held in the capital of Jin in 546 and the participating fourteeen states decided to accept the overlordship of the two states of Jin and Chu. Their adherents had to declare their subjection under the respective overlordship and to present tributes to the two hegemons. Among the participating states, there would be ten years of peace, and for more than fourty years, Jin and Chu would not meet at the battle field again.\n\nOnly two of the larger states did not participate in the general peace: Qi, and Qin.\n\nThe old kingdom of Zhou had totally lost its political role. The tributes once paid to the kings of Zhou were now offered to the dukes of Jin and the kings of Chu. If a small state did not pay tribute it had to expect military sanctions. Especially precarious was the role of the state of Lu that had to maintain good relationships to the three states of Jin, Chu and Qi, if it did not want to be swallowed by one of them. Very similar was the role of Zheng that was directly in the line of fire between Jin and Chu. But states like Lu also imitated the overlordship of their own masters and demanded tributes from yet smaller states like Teng \u6ed5, Qi \u675e or Zeng \u912b.\n\nThe Rise of the Semi-Barbarian States of Wu and Yue\n\nDuring the relatively peaceful sixth century, the two southern non-Chinese coastal states of Wu \u5433 and Yue \u8d8a emerged as new powers. Jin saw its chance to open a second flank against Chu, and in 583 Duke Wuchen of Shen \u7533\u516c\u5deb\u81e3 was sent to Wu in order to seek a military alliance. The semi-barbarian state of Wu was equipped with military tools and Wu soldiers were trained to attack Chu. But it was only more than half a century later that Wu became a serious threat to Chu after swallowing the statelet of Xu \u5f90.\n\nUnder King Hel\u00fc \u95d4\u95ad (r. 514-496) the political advisor Wu Yuan \u4f0d\u54e1 proposed to raise three armies that clockwise were to skirmish at the borders of Chu to weaken this state. In 506 the whole army of Wu finally attacked Chu and defeated this state at Baiju or Boju \u67cf\u8209 (modern Macheng \u9ebb\u57ce, Hubei). In pursuit of the escaping enemy, the army of Wu advanced to the capital of Chu, Yingdu \u90e2\u90fd (modern Jiangling \u6c5f\u9675, Hebei). King Zhao of Chu \u695a\u662d\u738b (r. 516-489) had to take his flight and sought for help in Qin. This western state sent out chariots that expelled the invaders from Wu.\n\nWu's neighbour Yue took the advantage of the prolonged campaigns against Chu to invade Wu. In 496, Wu set its troops into march to carry out a punitive expedition against Yue, but King Hel\u00fc died in the battle of Zuili \u6a87\u674e (modern Jiaxing \u5609\u8208, Zhejiang). Two years later, King Fucha \u592b\u5dee of Wu (r. 495-473) defeated Yue during the revenge battle of Fujiao \u592b\u6912 (modern Suzhou \u8607\u5dde, Jiangsu). Goujian \u53e5\u8e10, king of Yue (r. 496-465), fled to Mount Guiji \u6703\u7a3d\u5c71 (south of modern Shaoxing \u7d39\u8208, Zhejiang).\n\nAlthough Fucha's advisor Wu Yuan proposed to destroy the state of Yue, the king of Wu was content with his success in battle and the destruction of the capital of Yue. After the defeat of Chu and Yue, King Fucha turned his attention to the north. He had a fortification wall built at Han \u9097 (near modern Yangzhou \u63da\u5dde, Jiangsu) and dug out canals (see Grand Canal) that connected the Yangtze River with the Huai River \u6dee\u6c34 valley, creating a traffic line to the north and the possibility to move troops faster. The small states of Lu and Zhu \u90be declared themselves subjects to Wu. In the years 485 and 484 Wu attacked several times the state of Qi by land and by river and finally defeated Qi in the battle of Ailing \u827e\u9675 (modern Laiwu \u840a\u856a, Shandong). Wu assembled the states of the Central Plain to a meeting at Huangchi \u9ec3\u6c60 (modern Fengqiu \u5c01\u4e18, Henan), with the intention to declare its hegemony. Jin, weakened by internal struggles, did not dare to challenge the new powerful state of Wu, and King Fucha became the new hegemon.\n\nJust during the conference of Huangchi, King Goujian of Yue took the chance and invaded the capital of Wu. The overstretched military power of the state of Wu was unable to withstand the southern opponent who had rebuilt its strength after the defeat of Guiji. In 473, Yue destroyed the state of Wu and replaced it as the dominating power of the southeast. King Goujian of Yue was the last of the so-called Five Hegemons (Wuba \u4e94\u9738).\n\nThe Five Hegemons are also called the \"Five Earls\" (Wubo \u4e94\u4f2f). Different literary sources and commentaries identify them with different persons. The traditional definition by Zhao Qi \u8d99\u5c90 defines them as Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin, Duke Mu of Qin, Duke Xiang of Song, and King Zhuang of Chu. The book Xunzi \u8340\u5b50 identifies them with Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin, King Zhuang of Chu, King Hel\u00fc of Wu and King Goujian of Yue.\n\nThe Disintegration of the Old Order of Regional States\n\nIn the mid-5th century BCE there were four states that dominated old China: Chu in the south, Yue in the southwest, Jin in the north, and Qi in the east. Yet things were to change soon: Inner conflicts toppled two of the reigning houses (Jin and Qi), new powers emerged (Wei \u9b4f, Zhao \u8d99 and Han \u97d3), and reforms in the administration of several states created a new type of \"modernized\" regional state: the centralized state with a strengthened \"national\" economy and a professional army. The administration of the state by nobles related to the ruling house was replaced by a bureaucratic officialdom.\n\nThe state Lu was the first that felt the power of noble families which challenged the ducal house, in this case the Three Huan (Sanhuan \u4e09\u6853, descendants of Duke Huan \u9b6f\u6853\u516c) the Jisun \u5b63\u5b6b, Mengsun \u5b5f\u5b6b (Zhongsun \u4ef2\u5b6b) and Shusun \u53d4\u5b6b. From the time of Duke Xi \u9b6f\u50d6\u516c (r. 659-627) on these three noble families dominated the state of Lu. Duke Zhao \u9b6f\u662d\u516c (r. 541-510) even had to escape from their intrigues and died abroad. At the beginning of the fifth century minor nobles like Nan Kuai \u5357\u84af, Yang Hu \u967d\u864e and Hou Fan \u4faf\u72af rebelled against the mighty families and took over the rule of Lu.\n\nDescendants of the dukes of Song fought for the domination within the small state: the families Hua \u83ef, Yue \u6a02, Lao \u8001, Huang \u7687 (descendants of Duke Dai \u5b8b\u6234\u516c, r. 799-766), Yu \u9b5a, Dang \u8569, Lin \u9c57 and Xiang \u5411 (descendants of Duke Huan \u5b8b\u6853\u516c, r. 681-651). In the permanent power struggles only the families Yue and Huang survived the Spring and Autumn period.\n\nThe seven descendant lineages of Duke Mu of Zheng \u912d\u7a46\u516c (r. 627-606) also gradually lost their power in the course of the Spring and Autum period.\n\nIn the state of Qi, the government was led by the lineages of Guo \u570b, Gao \u9ad8, Cui \u5d14 and Qing \u6176. In this state it was a family not related to the ducal house that took over power in Qi: the family Tian \u7530, descendants of a prince from Chen, Tian Jingzhong \u7530\u656c\u4ef2, who had come to Qi in 672 while escaping internal disturbances in Chen. Under Duke Jing \u9f4a\u666f\u516c (r. 547-490), Jingzhong's descendant Tian Qi \u7530\u4e5e was ennobled and from this position collected wealth and power enough to annihilate the families Guo and Gao. His son Tian Chang \u7530\u5e38 was already wealthier than the Duke himself and sent his ambassadors to the neighbouring states. His descendants would eventually replace the reigning house in Qi.\n\nThe most tremendous power challenge from within took place in the state of Jin where descendants of the ducal line were not invested as regional governors (dafu \u5927\u592b). But this measure did not prevent other noble families from trying to dominate the court of Jin: Hu \u72d0, Zhao \u8d99, Xian \u5148, Xi \u90e4 and Xu \u80e5 were the dominating noble clans of the middle Spring and Autumn period, and were later replaced by the families Han \u97d3, Wei \u9b4f, Luan \u6b12, Fan \u8303 and Xun \u8340. At the beginning of the 5th century the noble families of Zhao, Wei, Han, Fan, Zhonghang \u4e2d\u884c and Zhi \u667a survived the internal struggle. The three first could destroy the last three and dissolved the dukedom of Jin, dividing its territory among themselves.\n\nDuring the reign of King Ding of Zhou \u5468\u5b9a\u738b (r. 607-586), the southern ruler King Zhuang of Chu \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 613-591) advanced his armies as far as the valley of River Luo in the pursuit of the Rong tribes of Luhun \u9678\u6e3e. The king of Chu used this situation pay the king of Zhou a visit, but King Ding only sent Prince Man \u6eff (\"Royal Grandson Man\" \u738b\u5b6b\u6eff) to confer with the semi-barbarian king of Chu. They talked about the so-called \"nine tripods\" (jiuding \u4e5d\u9f0e) erected in the capital that symbolized the nine regions of the kingdom of Zhou.\n\nAfter the death of King Ling of Zhou \u5468\u9748\u738b (r. 572-545) and during the reign of King Jing \u5468\u666f\u738b (r. 545-521) a succession crisis beset the house of Zhou. The heir apparent, Prince Sheng \u8056, had died prematurely. King Jing preferred his oldest son Prince Chao \u671d, yet when the king died, Prince Gai \u4e10 was supported by a strong party among the courtiers. The highest ministers enthroned Prince Meng \u731b, who was immediately attacked and killed by the adherents of Prince Chao. Prince Meng is posthumously known as King Dao \u5468\u60bc\u738b (r. 521-520). Prince Chao proclaimed himself king of Zhou, yet Prince Gai on his side asked for support by the duke of Jin and finally made it to the throne. He is known as King Jing \u5468\u656c\u738b (r. 520-476). Prince Chao, who had reigned for four years, fled to Chu. In 504, when he had assembled a sufficient number of supporters, he attacked King Jing and forced him to flee to Jin. A year later Duke Ding of Jin \u6649\u5b9a\u516c (r. 512-475) helped King Jing back on the throne."}, {"url": "https://everything.explained.today/%5C/King_Zhuang_of_Chu/", "page_content": "King Zhuang of Chu explained\n\nKing Zhuang of Chu (reigned 613-591 BC) was a monarch of the Zhou dynasty State of Chu during the Spring and Autumn period in ancient China. His personal name was Xiong L\u00fc, his ancestral name was Mi, and his posthumous title was King Zhuang. He was one of the five rulers dubbed the Five Hegemons by Xunzi and attempted to wrest control of China from King Ding of Zhou.[1]\n\nThe son of King Mu of Chu, Zhuang ascended the throne in 613 BC. According to a legend in the Records of the Grand Historian, for the first three years of his reign Zhuang wasted time in pleasure seeking, but, when challenged by two courtiers, reformed his ways.[2]\n\nThe king made Sunshu Ao his chancellor. Sunshu Ao began a series of major dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir in modern-day northern Anhui province.\n\nAfter some military successes, King Zhuang attempted to usurp King Ding of Zhou. According to a well-known story, probably an invention of the Warring States period, he asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the legendary Nine Tripod Cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China, but was rebuffed. This incident gave rise to the chengyu \"to enquire about ding in the central plains\", i.e. to have great ambitions .[2]\n\nIn the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the State of Jin. His progress from lazy regent to hegemon gave rise to the Chinese chengyu \"amaze [others] with one cry\" .\n\nNotes and References"}, {"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zhuangzi/", "page_content": "First published Wed Dec 17, 2014\n\nThis linguistic analysis emphasized indexical contexts especially for the evaluative terms of choices of natural paths of behavior (d\u00e0os). Zhuangzi\u2019s foils were mainly credulous and dogmatic Confucian humanists, particularly the innate intuitionist absolutism of a type familiar from the Mencius. He also took his linguistic insights to undermine Mozi\u2019s pragmatic utilitarian alternative to Confucianism. He engaged seriously with later Mohist, realist, linguistic theories, both acknowledging their challenge to primitive quietism (the anti-language view familiar in The Laozi) and yet remaining skeptical of the realist conclusion. His most frequent co-discussant in the text was Hui Shi, a rival linguistic relativist.\n\nPhilosophically, Zhuangzi strikes us as more the Hume of his tradition than a system builder like Plato, Aristotle or Kant. He drew skeptical and relativist implications from a naturalist approach to normative guidance. His treatment of natural d\u00e0os focused on the norms governing correct use of language. His ethical relativism grew out of an indexical model of how natural conditions shape the norms governing the use of terms.\n\nThis wide range of views of Zhuangzi stem from the style of the text. Zhuangzi\u2019s prose style is its own distinctive literary treasure. The central feature is the parable, typified as a discussion between imaginary or real interlocutors. Typically short, pithy, and amusing, his tales are both accessible and philosophically seductive\u2014they both entertain and make you think. A respite from the dry moralizing of Confucians, the text was always a favorite of the Chinese intellectual, literati class. The Zhuangzi also attracts modern Western readers with its thoroughgoing naturalism, philosophical subtlety, and sophisticated humor, all set in a strikingly different conceptual scheme and its distant, exotic context.\n\nSix centuries later, elements of Zhuangzi\u2019s naturalism, along with themes found in the text attributed to Laozi helped shape Chan Buddhism (Japanese Zen)\u2014a distinctively Chinese, naturalist blend of Daoism and Buddhism with its emphasis on focused engagement in our everyday ways of life.\n\nZhuangzi (Chuang-tzu \u838a\u5b50 \u201cMaster Zhuang\u201d late 4th century BC ) is the pivotal figure in Classical Philosophical Daoism. The Zhuangzi is a compilation of his and others\u2019 writings at the pinnacle of the philosophically subtle Classical period in China (5th\u20133rd century BC ). The period was marked by humanist and naturalist reflections on normativity shaped by the metaphor of a d\u00e0o\u2014a social or a natural path. Traditional orthodoxy understood Zhuangzi as an anti-rational, credulous follower of a mystical Laozi. That traditional view dominated mainstream readings of the text. Recent archeological discoveries have largely laid that ancient orthodoxy to rest.\n\nZhuangzi flourished through the latter half of the 4th century BC roughly contemporary with Mencius, and the movement known as the School of Names (\u540d\u5bb6 ming-jia name school). Zhuangzi shows familiarity with Classical Chinese theories of pragmatic-semantics and makes his own theoretical contributions to it. The traditionally recognized figures in this school included Gongsun Long and Hui Shi\u2014Zhuangzi\u2019s close friend and most frequent direct philosophical discussant. With the recovery of the Later Mohist dialectical work detailing their theory of language, we find compelling evidence that the linguistic turn in Classical thinking was a widespread feature of this mature phase of the Classical period. The later Confucian thinker, Xunzi, follows Zhuangzi in reacting to and incorporating this linguistic turn in his thinking.\n\nMost of what we infer about Zhuangzi\u2019s life, we draw from evidence within the Zhuangzi, although the Han biographers did speculate about his place of origin (the state of Meng) his personal name (Zhou), and the official posts he held (minor in Qiyuan in his home state) and period he lived (during Prince Wei reign over Chu\u2014which ended about 327 BC ). Scholars have found it hard to confirm any details of his life from outside this text and from his being discussed by later thinkers. The text itself contains scattered stories about Zhuangzi, but given its frequent use of fantasy, even these we must season with the salt of textual skepticism. We attribute a large chunk of the extant text of the Zhuangzi to \u201cstudents of Zhuangzi\u201d but we have little hint of who his students were or if he even had students in any formal sense.\n\nA scholar working around 600 years later after the fall of the Han, Guo Xiang (d. 312), edited and reduced what he saw as a haphazardly accumulated cluster of apocryphal and possibly authentic texts. He concluded that many were added after the time Zhuangzi lived. Guo reports compressing that prior collection of writings from fifty-two chapters to thirty-three. This is the extant text on which our knowledge is based. Guo divided the chapters he had chosen into three sections: the \u201cInner Chapters\u201d (1\u20137), the \u201cOuter Chapters\u201d (8\u201322) and the \u201cMiscellaneous Chapters\u201d (23\u201333). He attributed only the first section to the period dating from Zhuangzi\u2019s lifetime\u2014hence possibly originating from Zhuangzi himself. The second grouping may have included writings of a \u201cSchool of Zhuangzi.\u201d Modern scholarship assigns various sources of other influences found in both the second \u201couter\u201d and final \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d chapters. Graham drawing on work of the Chinese theorist, Kuan Feng and followed with some variation by Liu Xiaogan and Harold Roth, divides these influences into roughly four variously named groups:\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s students or the School of Zhuangzi credited with those later writings committed most closely to the views expressed in the \u201cinner chapters.\u201d\n\nAuthors with egoist views associated with Yang Zhu (4th century BC ). The Mencius presented Yang\u2019s thought as a version of an ethical egoism that rejected conventional altruistic social d\u00e0os.\n\n). The Mencius presented Yang\u2019s thought as a version of an ethical egoism that rejected conventional altruistic social d\u00e0os. The third group Graham dubbed the \u2018primitivists\u2019. Primitivists share Yang Zhu\u2019s antipathy to social, historical or conventional d\u00e0os\u2014typically those supporting social norms extending beyond agricultural village life\u2014in favor of more natural ways. This group shares attitudes with the text of the Laozi (D\u00e0od\u00e9 Jing) mixed with Yangist themes.\n\nThe final group, dominated the \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d sections, Graham called them syncretists (eclectics) who seemingly attempted comprehensiveness by combining all points of view into a single complete d\u00e0o.\n\nHowever widely assumed, Zhuangzi\u2019s authorship of any of the \u201cinner\u201d chapters remains a speculative hypothesis. Guo\u2019s original assessment that Zhuangzi did not author any of the remaining sections remains conventional scholarly wisdom, but religious Daoists treat the entire book as a Canon\u2014The N\u00e1nh\u00faa Zhen-Jing.\n\nCombining all these elements into a single volume reflects a familiar Classical pattern of embellishing the teachings of a master, adapting the additions to the namesake\u2019s writing style and expanding on his themes and insights in distinctive ways. The four schools contributing to the extant text shared an emphasis on natural \u2013usually as opposed to social-cultural, d\u00e0os. Yangism or egoism largely rejected social or moral d\u00e0os on the apparent assumption that natural guiding d\u00e0os essentially recommend self-preserving behavior. Its paradigm is the anti-social hermit. Motivation by self-interest was normatively prior to any conventional d\u00e0o. They preserved their natural purity from social corruption by rejecting society\u2019s mores.\n\nPrimitivism similarly rejected social and conventionally moral d\u00e0os (mores), but has its own conception of a natural, pre-social, typically intuitive, way of life that supports rustic, agricultural, village life. It supports populist and anarchist political tendencies.\n\nSyncretism does not reject social d\u00e0os per se, but does reject any particular d\u00e0o as biased and narrow in contrast to a more, \u201crounded,\u201d idealized, or comprehensive d\u00e0o. This is often expressed in an ideal observer form (the sage, perfect human, or \u5929 tiannature:sky\u2019s d\u00e0o). These views tend toward epistemic supernaturalism\u2014claims to superlative cognitive or religious access to some transcendently correct d\u00e0o. Both tend to deny that their correct d\u00e0os can be expressed and transmitted in language or words.\n\nThe discussions in the \u201cInner Chapters,\u201d particularly in the 2nd chapter, by contrast, treat language as also natural and social-conventional d\u00e0os as themselves natural d\u00e0os. It undermines the otherwise presupposed contrast of natural vs. conventional d\u00e0os. Humans are naturally social animals and execute natural causal processes when their walking, speaking, writing, and other practices leave marks in nature, (like a trail or a text) which become physically accessible to later walkers as history (stored in memory, legend, writings, or footprints etc.).\n\nThe pivotal 2nd chapter draws relativist and skeptical conclusions from its normative naturalism. It rejects the religious traditionalism of Confucianism and the Gaia-hypothesis implicit in the Mohist attempt at utilitarian naturalism. Nature provides us with many ways to go, but does not favor or command our making any choices among them. Sh\u00ec-f\u0113i \u662f\u975e (This way not that) judgments are made by living creatures in nature, not by \u5929 ti\u0101nnature:sky itself. We can find guiding structures, d\u00e0os, in nature but not a favored or dictated d\u00e0o of nature.\n\nLike the later syncretist chapters, the \u201cInner Chapter\u201d Zhuangists accept that social d\u00e0os are continuous with natural ones, but they do not endorse any imagined or alleged, comprehensive judgments from everywhere, from all natural points of view. The cosmic judgement from nowhere is a non-judgment. Zhuangists are not committed to Laozi\u2019s conception of an exclusive choice of natural (\u5929 ti\u0101nsky:nature) over social (\u4eba renhuman) d\u00e0os. They are skeptical of any claim of special access to contextless guiding knowledge by alleged or self-styled sages, \u201cideal observers\u201d or perfect exemplars of epistemic virtues. They accept language but also accept our natural capacity and inclination to toy with it, alter it, and mould it to our use in various situations of practical choice.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s exemplars are butchers, musicians, cicada catchers, wheelmakers\u2014exemplars of mundane and focused action guidance. Each is an exemplar of one of the many ways of life (d\u00e0os) who execute their particular specialties in a highly cultivated, precise, smooth, and seemingly easily executed way. The imagined eclectic synthesis of all the various ways of life into some total-comprehensive d\u00e0o is no more than de-facto restatement of their co-existence in a single natural world as optional ways of life. The cosmos makes no judgment that they should exist\u2014though it combines them into a cosmic d\u00e0o that is the history of everything. That the cosmos has this outcome does not mean it makes a human-like choice which humans could or should execute. We are ill advised to strive for skill in everything.\n\nThe eclectics were probably the last community working with the text, adding to it and carrying it into later periods. The Laozi had become enmeshed with a ruler cult worship of The Yellow Emperor. Laozi became the far more influential figure during the entire Confucian orthodoxy of the Han (206\u2013220 BC ).\n\nThe wide range of views of Zhuangzi stem from the style of the text and the ways it has figured in China\u2019s intellectual history as well as the ways it was caught up in the modern interaction between China and the modern, scientific West.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s style is the philosophical parable, typically a brief discussion or exchange between two points of view. There is slight plurality of humans among the discussants joined by natural and imaginary creatures. Its fictional characters are usually cleverly named, some are Confucian icons (Confucius or his alleged teacher, Lao Dan). Some discussants are animals (real and fictional fish, birds, snakes), a talking skull, the wind, musicians, debaters, tigers, trainers, butchers, butterflies, burglars and the myriad \u201cpipes of nature.\u201d Expressive brevity and subtlety of detail enhances the impact of the often complex and elusive point of the parables\u2014they seldom explicitly formulate the moral or point explicitly. Most commonly, the author(s) end discussions in a doubting tone, a double rhetorical question or some pithy enigmatic parting shot. They may make their point by having the two parties walking away shaking their heads, agreeing only to disagree; both appreciating that they barely understand one another, and yet feeling that something has been learned from the exchange.\n\nTranslation into Western languages invites biases that are hard to avoid. The main effect is loss of the conceptual cohesion of the original, but the parables still engage our Western philosophical curiosity. We get the exhilaration of immersion in an independent philosophical tradition of comparable antiquity and richness. Readers in and out of China invariably suspect that the Zhuangzi\u2019s appealing style is infused with philosophical genius, even as they disagree about its philosophical upshot. Indeed, much of the Zhuangzi\u2019s philosophical appeal may stem from its seemingly deliberate open-ended texture, the interpretive malleability of its dialogues which invites, even perhaps requires, us to join the author(s) in their philosophical reflection.\n\nThis appeal stems only partly from the quality and sophistication of his episodes; each illuminated a patch of philosophical territory ending with a question for further pondering\u2014rather like Nietzsche or the Later Wittgenstein. Each exchange presents or illustrates shards of insight with open-textured conclusions\u2014all laced with Zhuangzi\u2019s obvious joy in exploring paradox\u2014particularly linguistic ones of the sort that appeal to analytic Western thinkers. Each is an expression of some natural, but perhaps inaccessible, alternative way of life. The frequent enigmatic conclusions \u201cthe answer is X\u201d leaves interpreters arguing centuries later, Fermat-like, how X can be an answer\u2014or what X is (e.g., \u201cfree and easy wandering,\u201d \u201cwalking two paths,\u201d \u201cgoblet words,\u201d \u201cclarity,\u201d and so forth). Each seems easily to fit into a range of puzzles familiar to thinkers in both traditions. One suspects that we find the correct interpretation by finding our way, like Wittgenstein\u2019s fly, out of some philosophical bottle. The correct philosophy coincides with the correct interpretation of Zhuangzi.\n\nThe traditional religious Zhuangzi narratives placed him as the disciple of Laozi, whom they regard as a quasi-divine founder of a mystical religion worshipping a mysterious entity translators tended to render as a definite descriptive term, but capitalized it as if it were a singular name, \u201cThe D\u00e0o.\u201d Compatible philosophical treatments were versions of metaphysical monism, epistemic intuitionism (often explicitly anti-rationalist), political anarchism and a vague normative absolutism\u2014follow The D\u00e0o. The bulk of popular and religious treatments still follow this interpretive line, treating Laozi as the earliest layer of \u201cDaoist mystical thought\u201d or \u201cLao-Zhuang\u201d thought and situating Zhuangzi as his \u201cfollower.\u201d\n\nThe story of the religious view of Zhuangzi starts a century after Zhuangzi lived (4th century BC ). Philosophical schools were closed, books burned and thought repressed during the superstitious Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC ) which followed the classical period. This initiated China\u2019s philosophical \u201cDark Age.\u201d The more orthodox Confucian Han Dynasty (206 BC to 220) followed. Over two decades (109\u201391 BC ) the Han emperor\u2019s hereditary Grand Historians, Sima Tan and Sima Qian (a father and son team), wrote an official history from the mythical Yellow Emperor (c. 3rd Millennium BC ) to the Han. It is in this account that the classification of thinkers into three concept schools, Daoist, Legalist, and School of Names first occurs. Graham speculates that the assumption of an affiliation of Zhuangzi to Laozi may have originated from the Outer Chapters. There Zhuangzi\u2019s students used the mythical teacher of Confucius, Lao Dan or Laozi, to ridicule Confucius in a cycle of dialogues.\n\nA cult of Huang-Lao, worshipping the Yellow emperor and Laozi as divinities, had grown up in the Qin. The father and son historians were students of Huang-Lao masters. At the fall of the Han the narrative of Zhuangzi as a follower/elaborator of a semi-divine Laozi was well entrenched. The post-Han resurgence, known as Neo-Daoism, began with the editing of the received edition of, first, the Laozi (Wang Bi 226\u2013249) then the Zhuangzi (Guo Xiang d. 312 see above). Neo-Daoist discussion practices and ideas were influential in bringing Buddhist and Chinese thought into interaction and Daoism became enmeshed with Buddhism in the popular view (especially with Chinese Chan Buddhism). A Daoist \u201creligion\u201d, borrowing models of religious institutions from Buddhism (monasteries, monks and nuns) influenced discourse about Daoism throughout the period of Buddhist domination of the Chinese intellectual world (achieved gradually during the Six Dynasties period 220\u2013589 and extending through the Tang 618\u2013907). Neo-Confucians from the medieval period on treated Buddhism and Daoism as essentially similar religions.\n\nModern text theory concerning the Zhuangzi grows from two recent discoveries.\n\nThe reconstruction of the Later Mohist dialectical works and Archeological reconstructions of the text of the Daode Jing.\n\nThe following section discusses their twin impact on our view of Zhuangzi.\n\nDevelopments at the end of the 19th and early 20th century in China led Chinese intellectuals to adopt the European concept of philosophy (\u54f2\u5b78) with its implicit distinction from religion. This distinction was seen as pivoting on logic\u2014the theory of proof or argument. They started to segregate their own writings which seemed most like argument, inference and logic from those sustained mainly by credulity and tradition. They began to sort out the philosophical aspects of their traditional thought from its more religious and superstitious elements. Sun Yirang\u2019s (1848\u20131908) 1897 reconstruction of the Mohist Canon provided convincing evidence that analytically inspired and rigorous thinking had grown up in Classical China. This example encouraged 19th century intellectuals like Yan Fu (1854\u20131921) and Liang Qichao (1873\u20131929). They started to emphasize the ancient schools that more clearly related to the logical paradigms of Western philosophy and Mohist analytics. Hu Shih (1891\u20131962) continued this tradition of reconceiving and re-centering Chinese thought away from the Confucian scholasticism that had dominated since the decline of Buddhism.\n\nThe early 20th century logic-inspired reformation recently began to influence the interpretation of the Zhuangzi and the Xunzi in the west, largely inspired by Angus Graham who had observed that both ancient texts demonstrated a mastery of the technical vocabulary of Mohist linguistic theory.\n\nModern philosophical appreciation of the Zhuangzi, probably stems from Graham\u2019s 1969 \u201c[Zhuangzi]\u2019s Essay on Seeing Things as Equal\u201d (Graham 1969, predating his work on Mohism). Wryly replying to Wang Fuzhi\u2019s speculation that Shen Dao, not Zhuangzi had authored the beloved chapter, Graham averred that whoever wrote that philosophically rich text is the person we would want to think of as Zhuangzi. Graham proposed looking at the text\u2019s seemingly conflicting thoughts as analogous to the \u201cinner dialogue\u201d of a reflective thinker who formulates a view, considers then rejects it. Graham also noted the writer\u2019s deep involvement and apparent fluency in the technical language and obscure issues arising in Classical Chinese theories of language which he then only beginning to study.\n\nGraham\u2019s outlook conflicted overtly with a traditional Chinese narrative of a disciple Zhuangzi following a semi-divine Laozi in worship of The Mystical Dao. Zhuangzi, Graham quipped, didn\u2019t know he was a Daoist. Graham later argued that the internal evidence suggested Zhuangzi had never seen the text of the Laozi (The D\u00e0o D\u00e9 Jing) and probably thought of Lao Dan as a Confucian. Most interpretive disputes are, to a greater or lesser degree, a result of the tension between Graham\u2019s textual arguments and the traditional Historian\u2019s picture of Zhuangzi as a religious mystical Daoist follower of the semi-divine Laozi, similarly worshipping \u201cThe D\u00e0o.\u201d\n\nGraham\u2019s textual arguments were indirectly supported by archeological discoveries of different Laozi texts. The discoveries in the early 1970s and 1990s together implied a relatively late date for the emergence of the Laozi text\u2014probably some years after Zhuangzi had lived and perhaps overlapping the composition of a series of dialogues between Laozi and Confucius in the \u201cOuter Chapters\u201d section. Graham speculated that Zhuangzi\u2019s students, who were writing the cycle of Laozi-Confucius dialogues, may have rhetorically chosen to use the legendary Lao Dan (mythical teacher of Confucius) to give him authority to lecture and ridicule the revered master.\n\nWhen we abandon the traditional identification of Zhuangzi as a Laozi follower, it opens the door for speculation about his relation to the relativist, linguistic theorist, Hui Shi, traditionally treated as belonging to the School of Names. Christoph Harbesmeier speculated he may have been either Zhuangzi\u2019s teacher, mentor or fellow student. If he was a teacher, he came to accept his student as an equal or even superior. Zhuangzi portrays him as playing a role in Zhuangzi\u2019s philosophical skill development as an intimate philosophical interlocutor and eventually as a foil for sharpening his analysis. Among those texts that concentrate on \u540d m\u00edngnames, Hui Shi\u2019s ten theses mark him as a relativist response to Mohist realism on the relation of names and \u201cstuff\u201d\u2014focusing especially on comparative and indexical terms.\n\nWe can read Zhuangzi\u2019s relativism, accordingly as an alternative, arguably more reflectively subtle, indexical relativism about \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments regarding choices of paths (d\u00e0os) of correct use of names/words/concepts as guideposts to our \u884c x\u00edngwalking:behavior. This can both explain Zhuangzi\u2019s relativist direction of analysis and his recognition of sound Mohist/realist responses to Hui Shi\u2019s version of that relativist direction of thought. This article develops and expands on Graham\u2019s philosophical interpretation and emphasizes this relation to Hui Shi rather than to Laozi.\n\nBetween the traditional, piously mystical Daoist religious interpretation and that view\u2019s nearest philosophical neighbors, lies the bulk of the interpretive historical and religious literature. Given the philosophically oriented venue of this article, what follows should not be treated as ecumenical.\n\nConfucian d\u00e0os were broadly humanist. The earliest version (Confucius 551\u2013479 BC ) traced normativity to earlier human invention. Metaphorical trails are left by past human walkings, i.e. social practices. Language was an example of such an invented social practice which intertwined with routine activities (rituals) to yield the correct, sage-king inspired way of life\u2014the social \u9053 d\u00e0opath. A later version (Mencius 372\u2013239 BC ) focused on natural human psychology. The correct path is that to which our natural moral psychology inclines us. Humans have a \u5fc3 x\u012bnheart-mind that is naturally shangood-at normative choice and practice.\n\nMencius may have been reacting to Mohism. Mozi (470\u2013391 BC ) had earlier initiated a shift in focus to more natural and objective, less culturally relative way of grounding normative judgment. His claim that \u5929 ti\u0101nnature:sky exhibited a tendency to a course leading to human utility or well-being. So humans should use that natural norm, the \u8faf bi\u00e0ndistinction between \u5229\u5bb3 l\u00ec-h\u00e0i benefit-harm in constructing our social d\u00e0o, including the norms of language.\n\nCorrectly using terms is using them to mark the path of cooperative behaviors that lead to general human benefit\u2014a social \u9053 d\u00e0opath utilitarianism, rather than a law or rule version. Nature intends us to follow its natural structures in ways that lead to universal human \u5229 l\u00ecbenefit. Ethical questions thus have a single correct answer in an ideally engineered and shared normative linguistic practice. Mohist utilitarian metaethics pointed to natural realism.\n\nDaoist primitivism (symbolized by the mythical Laozi and the anonymous text known as the D\u00e0od\u00e9 Jing) was, as noted above, a further trend toward a broader ethical naturalism with anti-language absolutist implications. We should forget or ignore all social norms and practices, including linguistic ones. Utility (perhaps egoistic utility) does motivate our behavior as naturally as water follows the paths created by natural contours of earth. Language should not interfere in any way with this natural guiding interaction between us and the course(es) of nature.\n\nUnderstanding the Zhuangzi is made more difficult by the huge differences not only in the philosophical context, but in the pervasive metaphors that structure and focus discussions of norms of behavior in the Chinese vs Indo-European classical traditions. His positions invite comparisons with modern metaethical naturalism but he does not focus them with concepts linked to grammatical sentences such as \u201claws\u201d or \u201crules\u201d (sentences in all form) or \u201cfacts\u201d (sentence-sized chunks of reality) or \u201cproperties (realities corresponding to sentence predicates).\u201d Zhuangzi used the traditional \u9053 d\u00e0opath metaphor together with the technical terminology developed in Mohism of sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that, bi\u00e0ndistinction and k\u011bpermissible.\n\nThe metaphor shaping most Chinese discussions of pragmatic knowing, choice and behavior was d\u00e0o\u2014a path or trail. Questions we would phrase in terms of moral propositions, laws, or principles are questions about finding, choosing and following d\u00e0os, paths or ways. D\u00e0os can be social or natural structures that guide us in answering practical questions: what to do or how to do it. As the focus of warring Chinese conceptions of guidance, d\u00e0o guidance has three phases. We must find or notice them, choose one from among those we notice, and then follow or interpret the selected d\u00e0o in \u884c x\u00edngwalking:behavior. We \u8faf bi\u00e0ndistinguish, discover and recognize them; choose or approve (sh\u00ecthis:right) them or reject (f\u0113inot-that:wrong ) them, and treat them as k\u011bpermissible or not. Our capacity to engage in these three processes governing natural guiding structures, d\u00e0os, is an internal d\u00e0o\u2014our \u5fb7 d\u00e9virtuosity. Our \u5fb7 d\u00e9virtuosity at interacting with the web of d\u00e0os reads and interprets the path-marks thus generating our \u884c x\u00edngwalking:behavior.\n\nThe d\u00e0o metaphor corresponds closely with the Western translation metaphor of \u2018a way\u2019 which, while ubiquitous in philosophical discourse, is rarely a central focus of philosophical analysis of normativity. The salient differences between the two traditions accounts of behavior are that the Chinese does not focus on sentential items (actions, events, beliefs) particularly as conclusions of belief plus desire mental arguments. Instead, it focuses on the interplay of natural processes grounded in the temporally shifting distributions of \u6c23 qiphysical stuff that yields path-like guidance structures for living things.\n\nConfucians and Mohists had their own theories of the both the right d\u00e0os and the right \u5fb7 d\u00e9virtuosity to use together in guiding behavior. Confucian d\u00e0os tended to be those enshrined in past practice and their version of \u5fb7 d\u00e9virtuosity tended toward the intuitive, typically appealing to \u4ec1 r\u00e9nhumanity.\n\nMohists advocated guiding reform of conventional social d\u00e0os using a natural normative \u8faf bi\u00e0ndistinction of \u5229\u5bb3 l\u00ec-h\u00e0ibenefit-harm. For Mohists, \u5229\u5bb3 l\u00ec-h\u00e0ibenefit-harm was a \u5929 ti\u0101nnatural way of finding, choosing, reforming and interpreting social d\u00e0os. In contrast to Confucians, Mohists sought to elaborate their natural ways of selecting d\u00e0o-like social practices as operational, objective, measurement-like processes accessible to ordinary people and not subject to training and indoctrination.\n\nChinese linguistic analysis folded naturally into similar language\u2014it concerns ways of using words\u2014d\u00e0os (norms) of linguistic behavior focused on word use. The more philosophically inclined schools began to see such norms of the use of words as underlying the explicit disagreements among schools about which norms or d\u00e0os to follow and how to follow them.\n\nThe discussion of norms of use are typically couched in behavioral formulations such as \u53d6 q\u01d4choose, \u8209 j\u01d4 pick-out \u53ef k\u011bassertible:admissible \u8faf bi\u00e0ndistinction \u6307 zh\u01d0point and h\u00e9combine. The core psychological attitude is \u70ba w\u00e9ideem:do which may be expressed as a tendency (in speech, both inner and expressed) to express a \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgment regarding the use of a word. A phonetically and semantically related tendency is \u8b02 w\u00e8icalling it by the term. Behaviorally, it amounts to dealing with it under that word-concept. Conversely we can sh\u00ec or f\u0113i the use of a name of some contextual object\u2014w\u00e8icall it or w\u00e9ideem it properly associated with that \u540d m\u00edngname.\n\nTo \u70ba w\u00e9ideem:do can be either to express the category assignment in one\u2019s behavior\u2014either speech-behavior or behaving toward the object as people would be expected to, given that they assigned the object to that category. The behavior for the category would be found in the social or natural d\u00e0opath they follow. A \u70ba w\u00e9ideem:do state is less a mental picture of a fact (a belief) than a disposition to treat or identify some object as deserving the term in question. Instead of the western reality vs. appearance dialectic, Chinese discussion revolves around the contrast of natural (\u5929 ti\u0101nnature:sky) d\u00e0os and human (\u4eba r\u00e9nhuman) or socially constructed, d\u00e0os. The human d\u00e0os are constructed with the help of \u540d m\u00edngnames strung together into \u8a00 y\u00e1nlanguage.\n\nMozi, as we noted above, appealed to what he regarded as a natural utility standard to judge the acceptability of y\u00e1nlanguage use and Confucius relied more on past usage ranging back to the mythical sage kings. Problems of justifying approvals and disapprovals of word usage led such later Confucians as Mencius, to rely more on cultivating an intuition. Since the account of cultivation typically presupposed practice in conformity with the social practice requiring justification, the threat of circularity pushed traditionalists eventually to teach about and appeal to an allegedly innate or pre-social human psychology.\n\nBy contrast, the craft\u2013inspired Mohists went on to emphasize the use of measurement tools and operations as the standards guiding term use. They argued that such operational standards would be more accessible to ordinary people who could rely only on their \u201ceyes and ears.\u201d The Confucians, by contrast, were forced to flip between appealing to some cultivated authority and attributing an innate moral inclination to the existing conventional language d\u00e0o to such ordinary people.\n\n\u662f\u975e Sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments can concern choice of a d\u00e0o or the interpretive performances of a chosen d\u00e0o. Chinese writers similarly focused on \u53ef k\u011bassertible:permissible which may be said of a d\u00e0o, or of a permissible walking of some d\u00e0o\u2014including those of language use. Disagreement could be at the level of d\u00e0os, or at the interpretive level\u2014endorsing or rejecting a \u70ba w\u00e9ideem:do. The endorsing-rejecting \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that and \u53ef k\u011bpermissible behaviors themselves involve either choosing or interpreting d\u00e0os. Each time we make any of these judgments we contribute to further constructing our socially shared d\u00e0o with its implied practices of \u540d m\u00edngnames use.\n\nZhuangzi conforms to the general pre-Han model, using a path metaphor to discuss normativity in general. This fuels the traditional view of him as a Daoist. Most of his discussion, moreover, further conforms to the practice of focusing on social d\u00e0os\u2014undermining treatment as religious disciple of Laozi\u2019s insistence we follow only \u5929 ti\u0101nnatural d\u00e0os. What links him to a naturalist theme is his reluctance to draw the usual contrast between natural and social d\u00e0os. (Is it nature? Is it man?). Human social d\u00e0os are natural behaviors of natural animals. This grounds Zhuangzi\u2019s pattern of talking about and with other equally natural creatures.\n\nHumans are as natural as monkeys, birds, and fish. \u201cHow can d\u00e0os be hidden such that there are authentic and artificial?\u201d he asks rhetorically? (Harvard Yenching Zhuangzi Yinde hereafter HY 4/2/24\u20135) All the different social traditions expand the number and kinds of naturally existing d\u00e0os. Other animals\u2019 walking patterns also construct natural d\u00e0os which, similarly, become available for human finding, choosing and walking.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s discussion, particularly in the philosophically most sophisticated second chapter, is mainly about the plurality and relativity of second-level d\u00e0os, our naturally endowed, internal d\u00e0osways of finding, choosing and following one of many natural ways of life in the maze or network presented by nature. This stance makes the complexity of the natural network only the first level of variety and possibility. Recursion of d\u00e0os explodes the complexity. A tripartite recursion follows because there are many d\u00e0os of finding, of choosing, and of translating the first level plethora. The many layered complexity of d\u00e0os of d\u00e0os yields the human sphere of life. \u201cFish interact in water; humans interact in d\u00e0os\u201d (Ibid., HY 18/6/72)\n\nHe naturalizes d\u00e0os less by attending to natural physical guiding structures (e.g. d\u00e0os of water) than to the variety of human d\u00e0os presented by analogy to the variety of creatures with different d\u00e0os. Alternately, he encourages us not to assume we have found all the available ways to behave or he reflects on the variety of sources of d\u00e0os of choice or of different capacities to catch on and follow within us\u2014our different natural organs and the range of different ways we may train or habituate them. This complexity of d\u00e0o structures fuels, in turn, both his skepticism of absolutes, of authority, of ideal observers, of social dogmas and his qualified advice to leave the finding, choice and interpretation to a working out from the variety of perspectives that make up the behaving units in the particular circumstance. D\u00e0o choices are best made from the perspective of walkers.(Ibid., HY 4/2/33)\n\nThe other distinctive feature of Zhuangzi\u2019s approach lies in the sophistication of his handling the issues of language in explicating this natural complexity of d\u00e0os. Graham interpreted a famous Zhuangzi trope (the pipes of \u5929 ti\u0101nnature:sky) as Zhuangzi\u2019s way of positioning language as ti\u0101n (natural) sound.\n\nThe pipes of earth, these are the hollows everywhere; the pipes of men, these are rows of tubes. Tell me about the pipes of Heaven.\u2019 Who is it that blows the ten thousand disputing voices, who when of themselves they stop their talk has sealed them, and puffs out of them the opinions that they choose for themselves?\u2019 HY 3/2/4\u20139\n\nGraham elaborates:\n\nThese are apparently the holes in the heart through which thought courses and the mouths which utter it, so that the breath blown by heaven through the inner formations of different men issues in contradictory utterances. (Graham 1969:149)\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s Daoism, thus, starts by removing ti\u0101nconstant nature from its role as ultimate normative authority\u2014the role it played in virtually all the rival accounts of which d\u00e0o we should follow. All d\u00e0os that are practically available at the point of choice for walking (actually existing d\u00e0os) are similarly ti\u0101n. Ti\u0101n (nature) generates d\u00e0os as it generates the \u7269 w\u00f9thing-kinds (humans and other animals) that find and follow them. Neither it nor the cosmos can play the role of an authority, far less of an anthropomorphic authority commanding or dictating our choice among the network of naturally existing d\u00e0os. D\u00e0os are chosen from those found in nature, but none represents nature\u2019s choice for us\u2014none of the d\u00e0os in nature is the d\u00e0o of nature.\n\nDialectically, Zhuangzi\u2019s replacement for ti\u0101n\u2019s role as source of normative guidance would be the entire complex network of d\u00e0o structures that permeate the natural world. He situates us at indexed points in this network seeking paths forward from here and now, choosing from among the plethora of those accessible which, if any, to follow.\n\nThe philosophical advantage of Zhuangzi\u2019s way of discussing d\u00e0os, thus, does not leave him suggesting that what is natural is moral (analogous to implying \u201cought\u201d from \u201cis\u201d). Nature gives us a complex network of iterative guiding structures among which we are about to swim. In our waking hours, we continue constructing systems of contending, resolving and agreeing on \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments\u2014the rejected ones buried in rubble of ongoing construction of normative language marking behavioral paths. (HY 3/2/11\u201313)\n\nWe recognize greater and lesser models of both\u2014the more reflective and engaging vs. a lazier, more wordy type. As we walk through a day, we encounter attitudinal states\u2014joy, sorrow, surprise, ennui etc. We don\u2019t know what role these play but they seem central to our choosing activity\u2014indeed to our having a perspective, an \u2018I\u2019. (HY 3/2/11\u201314)\n\nWhen we describe that entire structure, e.g. as resembling a natural network of links (d\u00e0os) between temporally and spatially indexed points we can see how it might generate talk of a single cosmic dao. All guidance is at a point in the network and available to and for some emergent object\u2014physical, living, animal or human. The inner processes of seeking, choosing, and following d\u00e0os from node to node are themselves part of the natural network. We are not sure what the normative point of our natural reactions in walking through the nature\u2019s maze. Each step or utterance adds a \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that to the edifice of guiding discourse marking paths for ourselves and for others. It\u2019s as if there is some natural authority guiding the construction process, though we can\u2019t see marks of its authority. We can reliably walk paths or d\u00e0os but can't see the shape of the authority. We light on paths and react with heart-mind responses. That\u2019s it. (Ibid., HY 4/2/14\u201316)\n\nHuman d\u00e0os of finding, choosing and following are capacities normally attributed to the \u5fc3 x\u012bnheart-mind. Zhuangzi recognizes its involvement in the construction process, but is skeptical of making it a kind of natural authority. It is, after all, only one of the natural organs involved\u2014our daily reactions include being directed by our stomachs, our eyes, etc. Why, Zhuangzi wonders, should we think they need a single authority? (HY 4/2/14\u201316)\n\nEven, then, if we take the \u5fc3 x\u012bnheart-mind as an authority, it\u2019s not clear how it can help us deal with the role of judgments of greater and lesser wisdom and different ways of using \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that. Aren\u2019t all the hearts involved in the evolving construction equally natural\u2014the sages and the fools? (HY 4/2/21\u201322)\n\nAny output from our \u5fc3 x\u012bnheart-mind into this construction of a d\u00e0o to follow from here is itself a product of our having walked one of a range of possible d\u00e0os to this point. (HY 4/2/20)\n\n\u201cTo get a \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that from the \u5fc3 x\u012bnheart-mind without it\u2019s having been constructed there is like going to Yue today and arriving yesterday, like getting something from nothing.\u201d Even the wisest of mythical sages (Yao) can\u2019t know how to do that! (Ibid., HY 4/2/22\u201323)\n\nThere are many natural ways of finding and choosing ways. Humans naturally exhibit variety in how they find or choose a course of behavior. This recursive complex of d\u00e0os of choosing is part of nature. No single one need be considered the d\u00e0o of nature to the exclusion of others. They may be capacities of individuals or of social groups, embodied in their social practices. The gestalt set of past commitments and acquired inclinations to choose and interpret paths is another component of our situation or location in a complex web of d\u00e0os. The given d\u00e0os of choice are what Zhuangzi treats as \u6210 ch\u00e9ngconstructed/mature within our body as we traverse the nodes of the network of d\u00e0os. Our heart-minds reach an indexed point with a given momentum vector\u2014a speed on an existing trajectory\u2014this is our a point of view or perspective, complete with prior commitments to d\u00e0osways of appreciating and selecting among available paths.\n\nThese second-level d\u00e0os can also be chosen and walked correctly or incorrectly. Choosing an epistemic d\u00e0o, in turn, depends on other a practically available d\u00e0os for guiding that meta-choice\u2026 and so on. Zhuangzi does not view it as a rational or logical construction, but a complicated, multi-layered natural one. He speaks of \u201ceight \u5fb7 d\u00e9virtuosities\u201d involved in constructing d\u00e0os and guiding expressions, starting with the indexical locatives, left and right, then human relations, then mores, divisions (categories?), distinctions (disputes), competition and then strife. (HY 5/2/55\u20136)\n\nA similar recursion concerns d\u00e0os of finding and interpreting d\u00e0os. This network of recursive natural guidance structures constitutes the complex network of natural d\u00e0o. We rely on meta-d\u00e0os, practically available links in this network, in choosing and in interpreting practically available ground-level d\u00e0os. Humans navigate in a sea of d\u00e0os.\n\nThen who or what does the choosing? Zhuangzi\u2019s theory here is similarly detached and natural. He focuses less on the consciousness or subjectivity of some mental substance or cognitive self or agent, but on a grammatical locus of judgment, a \u6211 w\u01d2I:me within the linguistic d\u00e0o structure\u2014the grammatical indexical marks a choosing point in the conceptual and space-time structure. Like Hume\u2019s self, without the naturally occurring grab-bag of attitudes, it would not be there to play its choosing role. The \u6211 w\u01d2I:me is situated in a frame of reference with its own complicated \u6210 ch\u00e9ngcommitment trajectory in the iterative d\u00e0os of choice. The w\u01d2I:me that knows-how is situated in existing commitments embedded in an indexed here-now in the network of ways it will assign to sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that. Each sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that it \u201cshoots out\u201d further commits it to a path. (The narrator had introduced the above \u201cpipes of heaven\u201d metaphor to describe a gestalt he describes as having \u201csaid farewell to my w\u01d2I:me.\u201d)\n\n\u201cIts eruptions are like a repeating crossbow\u201d expresses how it manages \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments. \u201cIts resting on them like an oath or treaty\u201d expresses how it clings to past winners, \u201cits death is like autumn and winter\u201d expresses how it daily declines, a weakening brought about by this (the weight of accumulated commitments?) and it cannot start the process over. \u201cIts rejections are like tightening bonds\u201d puts into language these aging channels. As the x\u012bnheart-mind nears death, nothing can restore its dynamism. (HY 3/2/11\u201313) Joy, anger, sadness, pleasure, worrying, sighing, resisting, clinging, being drawn to, eschewing, launching, and committing, like music from empty holes, dampness generating mushrooms, these day and night replace each other before us and yet none can know from what they emerge. Let it be! Let it be! They come from where they emerge\u2014without these, there would be no \u6211 w\u01d2I:me and without a w\u01d2I:me there would be no choosing. (HY 3/2/13\u201314)\n\nFor Zhuangzi, the issue is not mind or consciousness, but the behavioral inclinations and the normative authority of these roving indexical perspectives scattered within the natural d\u00e0o network. Their choices of which d\u00e0os to walk furthers the construction ( \u6210 ch\u00e9ngfixing) of our perspective for the next choice.\n\nIt seems as if there is a natural authority, but we cannot find its authoritative source. There is sufficient reliability that this is walkable, but we don\u2019t see it\u2019s [authorizing?] shape\u2014it has natural reality but no visible shape. (HY4/2/15\u201316)\n\nThe first level paths have a shape, but the d\u00e0os of correct choice and performance are inside the performer and not plainly visible.\n\nThe trend from social construction humanism toward naturalism had been gradual. Mozi\u2019s argument for basing such constructions on a natural distinction of benefit and harm was an early step. Graham had separately theorized that Mencius developed both his response to Mozi and his account of the role of \u4ec1 r\u00e9nhumanity as arguments that Confucian ritual behavior had evolved from ti\u0101nnatural intuitive response patterns in the \u5fc3 x\u012bnheart-mind. This implicitly endorsed Mozi\u2019s reliance on a ti\u0101nnatural ground for the social construction of morality.\n\nGraham\u2019s Zhuangzi then addressed this Mencian response in a passage that extends the Hume-like skepticism about any identifiable \u201cinner self\u201d. That should be what guides the naturally occurring emotive reactions that are necessary for a w\u01d2I:me that chooses. It seems, he says, there must be one, but we find no evidence of it. We approve of behaviors and place our trust in its reactions but find no sign of what is authorizing or making them.\n\nHundreds of parts, nine openings and six viscera included and completed (\u6210 ch\u00e9ngfixed) in place in us, with which should I feel most akin? Should I be pleased with them all? Is there a w\u01d2I:me among them? Among them, should we deem some as rulers and as servants? Are the rulers and servants incapable of governing each other? Are they not capable of taking turns as ruler and servants? Is there a genuine ruler among them? It\u2019s as if trying and failing to grasp its real character has no bearing on whether it is genuine. (Ibid., HY 4/2/16\u201318)\n\nMozi had worried that it would be circular to appeal to intuitions about the word use in a social d\u00e0o to authorize that very practice, for example Confucian ritual. Being a product of ritual training. acquired intuitions could not be a sufficiently neutral way of justifying our choosing ritual as our social guide. Nor could one trained practitioner have authority over another in resolving interpretive disputes about how to execute the ritual, e.g., about how to apply the terms found in ritual texts to concrete real-time behaviors. He insisted we need a neutral, non-cultural or natural basis for such meta-choices of social practices of choosing and interpreting practices.\n\nThe narrative history of Classical thought found near the end of the Zhuangzi (Ibid., HY 90/33/1) takes off from this dispute between Confucians and Mohists. It welcomes Mozi\u2019s implicit search for neutrality, universality, and greater objectivity. However, the school viewed the familiar debate between a utilitarian and traditional morality as interminable because Mozi\u2019s d\u00e0oguide, like Confucius\u2019s, starts from different standards, different \u6210 ch\u00e9ngconstructed commitments to linguistic practices. Each relies on their past practice of judging how to use the key moral \u540d m\u00edngnames. Confucians would reject Mozi\u2019s standards because they led to what Confucians view as the wrong conclusions (e.g., implied Confucians should abandon \u7fa9 y\u00ec moral rituals such as burial). The Mohists reject burial rituals because they use \u7fa9 y\u00ec morality of the social mores reformed according to their standard of general utility. The pivotal statement of Zhuangzi\u2019s position is expressed as a riff on the relativity or dependence of \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments about language use on natural circumstances, naturally existing past practice, commitments and attitudinal gestalt shifts.\n\nWhere can \u9053 d\u00e0oguides hide such that there are genuine and artificial? Where can \u8a00 y\u00e1nlanguage hide such that there is \u662f \u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that. Where can d\u00e0os hide such that they do not exist? How can a \u8a00 y\u00e1nlanguage exist and not be \u53ef k\u011bassertible? D\u00e0os hide behind small achievements and language hides behind rhetorical flourishes and elaboration. So you have the \u201cthis is right-that is wrong\u201d of the Confucians and Mohists. Of what one says \u201cthis is right\u201d the other says \u201cthat is wrong\u201d and of what they say \u201cthat is wrong\u201d says \u201cthis is right.\u201d If you want to \u201cwrong\u201d what the other \u201crights\u201d and \u201cright\u201d what the other \u2018wrong\u2019s, nothing matches \u660e m\u00edngdiscerning. (Ibid., HY4/2/24\u20137)\n\nThough balanced in judging this impasse, the Zhuangzi\u2019s interesting target is the Mohist aspiration to objectivity. Many stories in the text target the notion that utility is a naturally constant value\u2014particularly the human utility that Mozi champions. Among this series of parables, the most famous, the useless tree, illustrates the relativity of usefulness to Hui Shi. (Ibid., HY 3/1/46\u20137)\n\nNot only are we implicitly appealing to a d\u00e0o in choosing to adopt a benefit/harm standard, we are also going to appeal to interpretive d\u00e0o to judge whether we have followed it correctly or not. Mozi had treated moral disputes as disagreements about how to \u8faf bi\u00e0ndistinguish in applying terms like \u7fa9 y\u00ecmorality and \u5584 sh\u00e0ngood-at. He had also objected to Confucian reliance on acquired intuition since it made access to such judgments esoteric. He argued that standards governing such evaluative word use should be made by \u6cd5 f\u01cemeasurement standards that are accessible to the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of ordinary people. His utility standard, Zhuangzi is suggesting, is still relative to the way of translating it to behavior.\n\nOthers in the ethical debate, notably Yang Zhu and related Primitivists, also appealed to ti\u0101n (natural constancy) as a normative arbiter. The growing awareness that norms of behavior are intertwined with norms of language use, produced another feature of this strand of thought bringing the natural world into our guidance. Primitivists came to advocate silence\u2014letting the natural paths of the world take over completely.\n\nFor most of history, the Laozi has exemplified this rejection of language. It treated all social \u9053 d\u00e0ospaths as implicit rejections of the natural \u9053 d\u00e0opath. Graham has argued that echoes of this line of thinking lay in the background of Mencius\u2019s thought. That concern led him to attempt to substitute natural moral psychology (a natural moral disposition in human \u5fc3 x\u012bnheart-mind) for positive social mores.\n\nA paradigm of this anti-language, silence trend (cited in the Zhuangzi\u2019s internal history just before discussing the Laozi group ) was Shen Dao. Shen Dao postulated a \u201cGreat D\u00e0o\u201d (essentially the actual course of cosmic history from past to future) which \u201ceven a clod of earth\u201d will follow. We all will follow Great D\u00e0o. We can (and should) therefore abandon knowledge of how to make linguistic distinctions (\u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments) to follow Great D\u00e0o. Shen Dao, based on his version of logical determinism (i.e., There being an actual complete history of space-time entails your behavior tomorrow is included) draws an anti-normative, quietist and stoic conclusion.\n\nLater Mohist writings contain several acute critiques of such a trending pro-silence posture. Deeming all \u8a00 y\u00e1nlanguage as not-\u53ef k\u011bassertible is not \u53ef k\u011bassertible. The explanation, later Mohists noted, lies in the asserter\u2019s own use of \u8a00 y\u00e1nlanguage. Rejecting (f\u0113i-ing) all sh\u00ec-f\u0113i judgments is f\u0113i (wrong, to be rejected). Similarly self-defeating is \u201cteaching not to teach.\u201d\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s \u201cpipes of nature\u201d metaphor signals his departure from these defective Laozi-like or Primitivist anti-language positions. Language is natural and arguments for silence are self-condemning. So the point of Zhuangzi\u2019s own reflections on the absence of natural normative endorsement of our sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that decisions should not guide us to stop making them. Making them is what we naturally do when we find our d\u00e0os in nature. It is natural for us to make a judgment, but not nature making it. Normativity arises from within nature, but nature only makes all its normative, behavior-guiding paths for us naturally available.\n\nThe Zhuangzi emphasizes the plurality of natural stances or points of view from which one may see paths of possible behavior as \u201cnatural.\u201d For one of the paths to be available for me will be dependent on where I am and my given trajectory in the network. All the appeals to ti\u0101nnature as an authority are right in insisting their d\u00e0os are natural, but mistaken in using that as a reason to deny a similar status to the d\u00e0os of rival normative thinkers. Ti\u0101n cannot serve as an arbiter of which rival norm is correct since it equally \u201cpuffs\u201d all of them out. This allows each to claim their choices are of ti\u0101nnatural d\u00e0os but does not allow them the corollary that their rival\u2019s choices violate ti\u0101n. They, like us, conform with ti\u0101n\u2019s constancies in being committed to their d\u00e0os.\n\nAny sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis:right judgment concerning a d\u00e0o may be either a \u56e0 y\u012bndependent sh\u00ec, based on prior or enacted commitments, gestalts orientations, and inner processes or it may be an arbitrary posited (\u70ba w\u00e8ido:deem) sh\u00ec. Dependency arises from past (ch\u00e9ngfixed) commitments to the d\u00e0o structures through which we worked our way to our here-now. We always encounter such choices as we are already engaged in walking along some d\u00e0o. Those past d\u00e0o commitments bring us to a normative stance from which successive judgments of sh\u00ec-f\u0113i and \u53ef k\u011bpermissible vs. not k\u011b arise. Zhuangzi\u2019s pivotal illustration pairs \u662f sh\u00ecthis with \u5f7c b\u01d0that as near and far indexicals. His use of another indexical here signals his view that \u662f sh\u00ecthis:right used normatively as opposite to \u975e f\u0113inot-that:wrong is relative to a commitment index.\n\nLocal justifications for having sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that or k\u011bassertible are delivered in accordance our ch\u00e9ngfixed commitment momentum along the d\u00e0os that guided us to this point. This relativity of normative dependence underpins Zhuangzi\u2019s mildly ironic, skepticism of special or extraordinary normative statuses we give to, e.g., sages. The skepticism must apply even to the quietist posture that sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments are \u201cbad\u201d or unnatural. We should doubt any transcendent or allegedly perfect, totalistic epistemic access to nature\u2019s inexpressible normative know-how. There are no naturally ideal observers.\n\nWill the eventual result be there is both \u662f sh\u00ecthis:right and \u5f7c b\u01d0that? Will the eventual result be there is neither sh\u00ec nor b\u01d0? We can call the situation of neither sh\u00ec nor f\u0113i finding its opposite the \u201cpivot of \u9053 d\u00e0oguides.\u201d The pivot sets the start of the center of a sphere from which there are inexhaustible responses\u2014inexhaustible sh\u00ec and inexhaustible f\u0113i. Hence the saying \u201cnothing matches \u660e m\u00edngdiscernment.\u201d (Ibid., HY 4/2/30\u201331)\n\nThis cautious skepticism undergirds Zhuangzi\u2019s departure from the primitivists\u2019. He neither thinks we should conclude that we must not issue sh\u00ec-f\u0113i judgments nor that we must reject or deny our natural, situational inclinations to sh\u00ec-f\u0113i. We should, however, adopt an attitude of epistemic modesty in making our perspective based choices and recommending our interpretations to others. That modesty arises from m\u00edngdiscerning that their perspectives, like ours, arise from within a immensely complex and complicated natural d\u00e0o structure. Epistemic modesty also undergirds Zhuangzi\u2019s openness and willingness to interact with others. If nature has a point of view, it is that one in which all actual d\u00e0os of sh\u00ec-f\u0113i-ing in nature are available as natural guiding structures. Hence nature makes no choice that implies a more absolute, or superior normative status on either perspective. Nature makes them possible candidate guiding d\u00e0os for us to choose and walk.\n\nA question implicitly and repeatedly left to the reader is what Zhuangzi means by \u660e m\u00edngdiscerning. Does it amount to taking the view of nature but of nowhere in particular or is it a naturally occurring, perspective on perspectives, a recognition of the plurality of natural perspectives? He usually recommends to our attention insights gained from realizing that our choice is one among a wide range of naturally available d\u00e0os. He provokes us to realize that we may make progress and improve our guiding perspective by simulating the guiding perspectives of others. Some tales, by contrast, warn us not to expect the d\u00e0os of others to mesh with our capacities and character\u2014as with the boy from Shouling who goes to learn the Handan way of walking, which \u201ccripples\u201d his original ability. Still a third outcome of the interaction, as with violent gangsters, reminds us simply to keep our distance.\n\nHowever, in the standard cases, we learn from simulating others\u2019 perspectives, choices and interpretations of the natural d\u00e0o-structures either from projecting or communicating\u2014sharing methods and techniques we did not grasp before (new ways to use gourds or hand-salve or find ways to accommodate and interact while \u201cwalking two ways\u201d). New accumulated insights about natural structures may improve our range of options, from our own point of view. Learning can also help us see how to walk in the natural paths together without getting in the other\u2019s way.\n\nIn understanding other\u2019s trajectories along their d\u00e0os, we may judge them as correct or incorrect. First, we do this from our own present perspective. We neither judge all to be right nor all to be wrong\u2014nor even that all are equal. Certainly, not all are equally worthy of our choice. We need not judge that all are good choices for those following them\u2014only that the grounds of their choice may be different from ours. They might still be dogmatic, careless, or unwarranted even given the situational grounds of their choice. Nothing about the naturalness of such choices arising makes them right. All this is compatible with recognizing others as natural creatures guided by natural inner processes along natural guiding d\u00e0os.\n\nWe neither seek to follow all at once or each equally\u2014as Hui Shi seems to suggest. Nor do we resolve to follow none\u2014as Shen Dao suggests. We do judge that we might gain from being aware of and engaging in open exchanges\u2014as in Zhuangzi\u2019s dialogues. We are more inclined to follow a path, and given our similarities, think we might pursue it with benefit when we know some natural being like us found and followed it. And Zhuangzi clearly does ridicule the social moralists (Confucians and Mohists) as well as Hui Shi for the narrowness of their range of choices\u2014their failure to appreciate the richness and complexity of alternative ways of life.\n\nOur tendency to appreciate and share others\u2019 values, to mirror their behavior cooperatively, together with our awareness of the wide variety of perspectives, many of which we judge to be worthless, mistaken, or dangerous, makes it hard to treat any projected transcendental, comprehensive viewpoint as the single answer. Zhuangzi\u2019s \u201cpivot of d\u00e0os,\u201d his \u201cview from nowhere,\u201d is not a final sh\u00ec-f\u0113i judgment. It is the point prior to any sh\u00ec-f\u0113i and from which all diverge. Each commitment propels us down a different path at a ch\u00e9ngfixed momentum. We rely on ch\u00e9ngfixed commitments to prior sh\u00ec-f\u0113i in all sh\u00ec-f\u0113i judgment. All sh\u00ec-f\u0113i are indexed within the network. The judgment from no-where-when is no-judgment.\n\nWe learn from openness and exchange because we acquire commitments from simulating others\u2019 path following behavior. That we progress in such exchanges is something we ourselves judge, not the cosmos. No judgment comes from some point outside of or everywhere in the network of d\u00e0os. We are naturally influenced by others\u2019 evaluations, their judgments of our choices and their behavioral virtuosity\u2014especially when the others are our parents, perceived superiors and respected models. These, again, are the \u56e0 y\u012bndependencies on which present judgments depend.\n\nThis gives Zhuangzi\u2019s indexical relativism a different contour from Hui Shi\u2019s. The latter structures his analysis mainly on comparatives. This leads him to a version of normative \u2018error theory\u2019 \u2013the conclusion that we should abandon normative semantic distinctions as all wrong. Since the \u8faf bi\u00e0ndistinctions on which they are based are relative, they are unreal. Ergo, there are no real distinctions and the world is actually one. Any distinction making judgment, any sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that, unnaturally divides what is naturally one. Hui Shih\u2019s Tenth Thesis is:\n\nFlood concern on all the 10,000 thing-kinds; The cosmos is one \u9ad4 t\u00edunit. (HY 93/33/74)\n\nGraham, relying on his hypothesis that Zhuangzi frequently considers positions which he later rejects, had already targeted the stereotype view of Zhuangzi as agreeing with Hui Shi\u2019s monism. Graham\u2019s translation reveals the reductio that puts monism in a \u201cconsidered and rejected\u201d category. It amounts to the self-rebutting anti-language stance targeted by the Later Mohists\u2014the error Zhuangzi\u2019s naturalism of all perspectives (the \u201cpipes of heaven\u201d) was intended to avoid.\n\n\u201c[H]eaven and earth were born together with me and the myriad things and I are one.\u201d Now that we are one, can I still say anything? Now that I have called us one, did I succeed in not saying something? One and the saying make two, two and one make three. Proceeding from here even an expert calculator cannot get to the end of it, much less a plain man. (HY5/2/52\u201354)\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s relativism expresses choice, commitment, and interpretive performance on analogy to natural processes involved in following a path. Commitment is setting off along a path. We have momentum and a trajectory. The shape of the path combines with these and commits us to walk on or continue in a way that depends on the discernible shape of the path. Walking a path involves staying mostly within its physical boundaries.\n\nThis account allows us to capture the flavor of Zhuangzi\u2019s discussion which does not employ the familiar Western sentence-based metaphors of laws, rules, principles with norms of obedience, belief or propositional desire. Using the Western idiom, along with the associated practical syllogism of belief-desire explanation would give Zhuangzi the basis for a distinction between a cause and a reason\u2014a distinction he seems not to draw in his talk of \u56e0 y\u012bndependence. There is a kind of inference from d\u00e0os of choice, interpretation etc. of a path and an internal feedback d\u00e0o (our \u5fb7 d\u00e9 virtuosity at) \u201creading\u201d external paths to guide behavior.\n\nZhuangzi would not make that point in terms of deduction from a normative premise or principle. The internal and external paths themselves have a causal and normative relation to our walking behavior. A more sentential focus would similarly mean describing the outcome as an action rather than an extended course of walking/following behavior. A sentence would state the action or the intent\u2014rather like the conclusion of a practical syllogism rather than, as as fits in this metaphorical space, as performing a role in a play or or part in a symphony.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s use of the path metaphor did extend to the understanding of language but, again, not with a focus on sententials. Rather than constructing d\u00e0os in sentential form, Zhuangzi construes language in d\u00e0o form. The focus of ancient Chinese theory was on names on the analogy of path markers: \u201cgo past the tree, turn right and then down to the water.\u201d Names take on importance as sign-posts along physical structures. Confucian social versions emphasized the names of social roles and statuses more than of natural kinds. Primitivist opposition to social d\u00e0os led them into the sweeping anti-naming postures that Later Mohists showed to be self-condemning.\n\nGraham\u2019s interpretation of Zhuangzi\u2019s pipes of nature gave him a way to evade this anti-language abyss. Human language is a natural sound. Hui Shi\u2019s using relativist premises about names to derive an absolutist monism which threatened to collapse to the primitivist anti-distinction, anti-naming quietism. Making everything one is equivalent to denying \u8faf bi\u00e0ndistinctions thereby denying any real basis for the sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis way-not that statuses implicit in all \u540d m\u00edngnames and y\u00e1nwords:language.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s naturalism is anti-dogmatic, it neither denies nor asserts any particular set of distinctions as authentic. Distinctions arise from indexed here-now points in the actual network of d\u00e0o perspectives\u2014by travelers on a trajectory along one of the d\u00e0os choosing \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113i this-not that from among multiple possible courses of behavior afforded by the cosmos. The cosmos does not select which way to make the choice.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s analogy of language and wind, however, had its own problems. Graham had noted that Zhuangzi returns to the metaphor nearer the middle of the dialogue, noting that here Zhuangzi seems to be taking back some of its implications. Having disposed of Mencius\u2019s appeal to intuition and Hui Shi\u2019s attempt to make everything normatively equal, he here addresses a more challenging position. The Later Mohists advocated a version of pragmatic-semantic realism. The Later Mohists had also argued that when a \u8faf bi\u00e0ndistinction was formulated as a sh\u00ec-f\u0113i, e.g., one of the disputants calls it \u201cox\u201d and the other \u201cnot-ox\u201d, one of them must \u52dd sh\u00e8ngwin i.e., \u7576 d\u0101nghit on it.\n\nThe Later Mohists\u2019 version of common-sense realism incorporated social conventions. Conventions set out what \u7269 w\u00f9natural-kind each term \u201cselects out\u201d or bi\u00e0ndistinguishes from the rest. We then extend that distinction to pick out new objects based on their objective similarity or difference (those accessible to \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of ordinary people). This is the basis of a social standard of correct word use enshrined in past practice.\n\nHui Shi, however, had undermined that simple version of realism with his observation that between any two \u7269 w\u00f9natural-kinds we can find some similarity and some difference. The world, in effect, gives us many ways of establishing conventional distinctions and assigning names. The Later Mohists had failed to find an adequate account of what similarities would and would not lead to what they called \u72c2\u8209 ku\u0101ngj\u01d4wild picking out . Zhuangzi\u2019s analogy of language to the noises made by wind had seemed to echo Hui Shi\u2019s normlessness about language. In this later passage, however, he revisits the wind analogy, and retreats, accepting the Mohist insight that language is more than a \u201cnatural sound.\u201d\n\nLanguage is not blowing; those who use language, have language. (Graham translates: \u201cSaying is not blowing breath, saying says something.) That which it languages is decidedly not yet fixed. Is the eventual result that they have (there is) language? Or there has never been language? Deeming it as different from bird calls: does that mark a distinction? Or is there no distinction?\u201d (HY4/2/23\u20134) (This passage is followed by the passage cited in the \u201cIntuition\u201d sub-section above)\n\nThis frustrating vagueness and signature indecision in the text leaves interpreters to philosophize about what Zhuangzi\u2019s implicit answer (\u660e m\u00edngdiscern:clear) might be. However, the analogy with bird calls is a fortuitous suggestion. We arrange, adapt and modulate the elements of our language to fit our environment, abilities, and opportunities (e.g., mating). Would Zhuangzi have guessed the same about birds?\n\nThe claim following that concurs that the \u201caboutness\u201d of a language exists but aboutness is not fixed. This can be explicated with the above discussion of the indexicals \u662f sh\u00ecthis:right and \u5f7c b\u01d0that. Zhuangzi carries the diectic character over to his treatment of the ubiquitous sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that that undergird the norms guiding how to use names (words). We endorse and recommend (sh\u00ec this:right) our guiding terms, language and linked behavior. We may base that on our correctly following prior commitments to d\u00e0os of word use\u2014relying on a Confucian traditional standard, the past and existing practices of our linguistic community.\n\nIn one passage, Zhuangzi allows this appeal to past or existing common practice but does not endorse it as right\u2014merely as useful. Conventions are useful because they facilitate communication. He he adds a tone of \u201cthat is all\u201d hinting we need not regard them as plausible candidates for being absolutely right\u2014a single transcendent standard of use.\n\nOnly those who \u201cbreak through\u201d know how to communicate with it as a \u201cone.\u201d Because of this, we don\u2019t use that strategy and instead locate things in the conventional realm. The conventional is useful; the useful, communicable, and the communicable achievable. If you hit on the achievable, you are almost there and dependent sh\u00ecs end. (Ibid., HY 4/2/36\u201337)\n\nZhuangzi describes our past sh\u00ecs of this kind as \u201clike an oath or treaty.\u201d (Ibid., HY 3/2/11) They have \u201cenactment force\u201d committing us to a d\u00e0o governing their later use. We may conform to (correctly follow) and further construct our transmitted linguistic d\u00e0o in expressing or performing (\u70ba w\u00e9ideeming) other things as sh\u00ec-f\u0113i. Our trajectory along our paths incorporates these accumulated commitments to prior practices of language use. As our d\u00e0os now bring us to new situations, how do we know to project the correct indexed choice from the prior history of differently-indexed behavior? That actual language behavior commits us to a linguistic d\u00e0o-type, but it\u2019s not clear what the commitment entails at this choice point. The Mohists and Confucians are both claiming, from their different directional perspectives, to be following similar commitments to existing d\u00e0os of practice.\n\nMozi\u2019s recommending naturally or empirically available d\u00e0os for reforming shared linguistic practice was itself, Mozi thought, following existing natural practice. He even noticed that our ongoing linguistic practice rejects treating something\u2019s merely being a shared past practice as automatically making it right. Our existing evaluation practices remind us that shared and unquestioned past practices can be wrong.\n\nMozi appealed to what he would also have regarded as a purely natural practice. Practical efficiency (l\u00ec benefit) is a standard accessible to all ordinary people\u2019s \u201ceyes and ears.\u201d Each time we apply some natural, empirically guided interpretation in practice, we participate in shaping evolving normative practices (both linguistic and behavioral practices). Each such decision commits us and others to a d\u00e0o of interpreting our social d\u00e0o. We understand our commitment to that d\u00e0o as a commitment to practice and transmit it correctly\u2014where the standard of \u2018correct\u2019 is itself either enshrined in a past practice or in natural utility. This is the basis for Zhuangzi\u2019s claim that social d\u00e0os, including linguistic d\u00e0os, are natural d\u00e0os\u2014and there are many of them. Further, as the Laozi would later famously observe, d\u00e0os can be interpretively guided. They are changeable d\u00e0os.\n\nHumans, in finding ways to walk and walking them, initiate the construction of social paths, naturally and perhaps unintentionally, by leaving prints in the natural world. Zhuangzi links the path metaphor to a society\u2019s linguistic practice thus:\n\nThat which we treat as \u53ef k\u011bassertible is \u53ef k\u011bassertible; that which we treat as not assertible is not assertible. D\u00e0os are made by walking them; thing-kinds are made \u7136 r\u00e1nso so by being called \u2018so\u2019. (Ibid., HY 4/2/33)\n\nThis sense of the immense complexity and the fluid nature of normative commitments to a d\u00e0opath underlie Zhuangzi\u2019s skeptical themes. \u660e M\u00edngclear:discerning seems linked to the gestalt in which we accept ourselves as embedded, along with others similarly situated, in nature\u2019s endlessly complex evolution of guiding structures. How do we know either that our past practice was correct or that we are correctly following them in this new situation, here and now, based solely on our eyes and ears?\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s stance toward Mohist formal realism (if we disagree on a sh\u00ec-f\u0113i, one party must \u52dd sh\u00e8ngwin) becomes clearer now. The Mohists did not specify any objective mechanism of \u201cwinning\u201d beyond some vague suggestion of tipping a balance. However Zhuangzi\u2019s point in response appears to track the warning function of a norm of truth (even when justified by our best available judging standards, we may still be wrong). Zhuangzi takes sh\u00e8ngwinning as a vague primitive in arguing that we cannot finally settle skeptical doubts by appeal to winning disputes. The main mechanism Zhuangzi discusses is appeal to a judge or authority. We appreciate that all judges will also use terms like sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that indexed by their acquired commitment momentum. Their judgments, like ours, express their momentum along a d\u00e0o of using these words here, now and projecting the usage to that, there, then.\n\nGiven that you and I have been brought to \u8faf bi\u00e0ndispute and you win me over and I don\u2019t win you over, in such a case is your distinction substantively \u662f Sh\u00ecthis:right? Mine substantively \u975e f\u0113i? If I win you over and you don\u2019t win me over; is mine substantively right? And yours?; substantively wrong? Are they partly right and partly wrong? Or jointly right and jointly wrong? You and I cannot know between ourselves, so another human inherently inherits our obscurity and doubt. To whom can we go to correct us? Employing someone who agrees with you, given that they are like you, how can they correct the situation? Employing someone who agrees with me, given that they are like me, how can they correct it? Employ someone different from both me and you to correct it, given that they are different from us both, how can they correct it? Employ someone who is like both of us to correct it, given that they are like us both, how can they correct it? So you and I and others cannot know, and in these condition on what other can we rely? The changing sounds\u2019 mutual dependence is like their conjoint autonomy. Harmonize them with glances at nature and make them dependent on eventual consensus and with that exhaust the years. (Ibid., HY 7/2/84\u201392)\n\nIt is not clear if the conclusion is supposed to be a solution to the skeptical problem posed or merely a way to cope constructively with complexity and uncertainty. The passage rules out any appeal to a special authority of any other point of view\u2014while giving equal authority in the construction to all. Even where we all share some \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d it does not have special authority\u2014say over other creatures. This, was implicit in Mozi\u2019s rejection of socially agreed d\u00e0os. Zhuangzi\u2019s notorious toying with the perspectives of animals expanded it (for naturalists). .\n\nGap-tooth asked Kingsley, \u201cDo you know that which all natural kinds agree in sh\u00ecendorse-ing?\u201d\n\nHe answers \u201cHow would I know that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, do you know of what you don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how could I know that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, does no natural kind know anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how would I know that? Nonetheless, let me try to put it in language. How would I know that what I call \u2018knowing\u2019 is not not-knowing? And what I call \u2018not-knowing\u2019, is knowing.\u201d And let me try a question on you. If people sleep in the damp, they get pains and paralysis; would eels? If in a tree, they tremble in fear; would monkeys? Of the three, does any know the correct place to live? \u2026 From where I see it, the origins of goodness and morality, painting things as \u2018this/right\u2019 or \u2018not-that/wrong\u2019 are, as boundaries, both confused and complicated; how could I know how to distinguish them? (Ibid., HY 6/2/64\u201370)\n\nThis passage reinforces the conclusion that norms of correct word use is Zhuangzi\u2019s core skeptical target. So we may indeed know how to act, according to some norms of using \u2018know how\u2019 and not if judged by some other d\u00e0o of correct usage of the knowing/ignorant distinction. Linguistic skepticism easily metastasizes to virtually any commitment. According to which d\u00e0o of projecting past practice should we judge this linguistic behavior as conforming to our commitment or not. Normative skepticism, in a use-theory is hard to contain\u2014especially when the model of all judgments is as some indexed \u662f \u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that assignment. It sweeps in metaphysics, epistemics, and semantics.\n\nA consequence is that Zhuangzi\u2019s skepticism is broad but weak. Broad because it infects so many judgments, but weak not merely in the usual sense of denying absolute certainty, but in failing to imply that we should stop or refuse to make the judgment. It does not rest on any theory of the probability of an error, but that the concept of an error is subject to the same concerns as the original judgment. It neither undermines nor give us reason to withdraw our judgments. Appreciating that others reach their views as naturally as we do only removes our status to claim that our judgment is authentically and uniquely correct.\n\nTemporally, Zhuangzi\u2019s skepticism is buttressed by reminding us of our own past experiences of learning, of acquiring new gestalts, of realizing that what we had considered the way, was subject to reconsideration and improvement. The skepticism does not target any specific failure in my epistemic process. It does not advise me to abandon my present course. It reminds me only to remain open to the further possibility of learning more\u2014about what? About the world? We can do that by learning more about other natural ways of processing and how they work in the world\u2014other d\u00e0os.\n\nIt counts as skepticism because it reminds us that we normally err on the side of overestimating than underestimating our epistemic security. We think we know and do not more often than we think we don\u2019t know and we do. And that is because we underestimate the range of possible alternative d\u00e0os. Hence the pragmatic upshot of his skepticism is to remind us to engage with more other points of view.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s skepticism is weak because it acknowledges that we may apply different concepts of \u2018knowing\u2019 in different situations. Implicitly, it does not deny that we could meet some particular standard of knowing, but that we could know for every situation which standard is the right one. What standard is the right one to use for acknowledging or denying someone knows well enough to satisfy, for example, the correct d\u00e0o of assertion?\n\nThis feature of Zhuangzi\u2019s skepticism lies at the heart of the famous debate between Zhuangzi and Hui Shi about the fish-pleasure in which Zhuangzi defends a claim to know against Hui Shi\u2019s challenge. Zhuangzi makes an assertion and Hui Shi initiates the skeptical challenge. His challenge implies that there is a favored or correct standard of knowing that turns out to be impossibly strict. All knowledge must come from inside. It\u2019s impossibly strict because it doesn\u2019t allow Hui Shi to issue the challenge in this conversation.\n\nZhuangzi and Hui Shi wandered over the Hao River bridge. Zhuangzi said, \u201cthose mini-fish coming from there and cruising around, relaxed and unhurried, are fish at leisure.\u201d Hui Shi said \u201cYou are not a fish; from whence do you know the leisure of fish?\u201d Zhuangzi retorted, \u201cYou are not me, from what perspective do you know my not knowing fish at leisure?\u201d Hui Shi responds, \u201cI\u2019m not you, of course I don\u2019t know about you; You are not a fish and that\u2019s enough to count as you\u2019re not knowing fish\u2019s leisure.\u201d Zhuangzi concludes, \u201cLet\u2019s return to where we started. When you said \u2018from what perspective do you know fish at leisure\u2019, you clearly knew my knowing it as you asked me. I knew it here above the Hao.\u201d (Ibid., HY 45/17/87\u201391)\n\nGraham drew our attention to the role of perspective in this passage, noting that Hui Shi\u2019s challenge to Zhuangzi\u2019s assertion does not use the normal question form, (\u4f55 h\u00e9how do you know?) but a locative question word (\u5b89 \u0101nwhence?). This brings the debate into alignment with Zhuangzi\u2019s concern about the various perspectives from which to deploy a d\u00e0o of word use. Here, as above, the word is \u77e5 zh\u012bknow. The norm of asserting, as in English, involves answering the challenge \u201chow do you know?\u201d What normative conditions allow me, here and now, correctly to use the term zh\u012bknow\u2014hence to make the assertion about these fish below me? Hui Shi both knew Zhuangzi was relying on a d\u00e0o of using \u2018know\u2019 \u201cfrom zhuangzi\u2018s here\u201d and Hui Shi knew Zhuangzi\u2019s situation from his own relevantly similar \u201chere-now\u201d and relying on the same \u9053 d\u00e0onorm of claiming to know from a distinct perspective. Hui Shi cannot consistently insist that a speaker can only use \u77e5 zh\u012bknow when he occupies the perspective of the thing known.\n\nNotice, the argument about the fish implies we have a perspective on the perspectives of others. So skepticism grounded in dependence or relativity of perspective need not be predominantly negative. Zhuangzi, here, uses it to justify a way of claiming to knowing. In many other parables, he addresses the kind of knowing that comes with a gestalt shift, especially when we see our own and others\u2019 points of view as similar\u2014see ourselves as others see us. This is the more comprehensive perspective Zhuangzi urges on us. We experience such gestalt shifts especially when we come appreciate we had been wrong before and now view things differently. We are confident from our own \u201cnow\u201d that we have made epistemic progress\u2014our new awareness seems \u201crelatively\u201d improved to us now. We reach a state where we judge our former perspective to be inferior to our present one. It includes insight into our relative situations. Evidently, this awareness of one\u2019s own perspective as one of many, equally natural points of view motivates us to wonder if we have made the final correction. This enhanced awareness of ourselves as one of many perspectives is an intelligible candidate reading of Zhuangzi\u2019s \u660e m\u00edngclarity. It is harder to construct a coherent narrative for mystical and/or dogmatic readings\u2014those that jump from an improved perspective to a perfect one.\n\nThis kind of gestalt shift leads us to reflect on how narrow our past perspective had been. It features prominently in the \u201cAutumn Floods\u201d Chapter 17. The Earl of the Yellow River, having thought himself as the ultimate, discovers the North Sea and announces his former error and newfound awareness of his lesser significance in \u201cthe greater path.\u201d The North Sea Overlord tells him that he too sees himself as situated in a modest status in a still greater scheme and rejects the River Earl\u2019s attempts to identify the North Sea\u2019s as ultimate. He casts doubt on there being a final, ultimately small or large.\n\nThe lord of He river said, \u201cSo can I consider cosmos \u2018large\u2019 and the tip of a hair as \u2018small\u2019?\u201d North Sea Ruo replied, \u201cNo! Thing kinds have unlimited measurement (ways of measuring); Time has no end; distinctions have no constancy, beginning and ending no inherent cause. Because of this great knowing is viewed within a range of distant and close. \u2026We calculate that what humans know is never as great as what they do not know, their temporal extent of life is not as great as not as much as the time before life, and from the very small to try to take in the scope of the very large, is an invitation to confusion and disorder and not that from which we can gain. (Ibid., HY 42/17/14\u201320)\n\nCan we describe Zhuangzi\u2019s m\u00edng as \u201chaving a sense of our limited perspective?\u201d Credulous, dogmatic and imperious absolutists do not appreciate themselves as being in one of a variety of natural perspectives. Broad open-mindedness and mild skepticism come together in the m\u00edngclarity Zhuangzi encourages in us. It has a dual nature\u2014an epistemically modest perspective on ourselves that arises from improving our epistemic status and encourages us to continue. It helps us appreciate that we are still as naturally situated and others with whom we may disagree and still grow. Further improvement can come from further exchange of perspectives.\n\nThe na\u00efve Confucian-Mohist advocates of imposing a single social d\u00e0o thus disrupt the natural process by which social d\u00e0os evolve in real time as we seek a harmony guided by \u201cglances at nature.\u201d Seeing things from another\u2019s perspective both alerts us to how we could be wrong and makes us feel that we now understand things better than with our former, narrower perspective. Yet, the Zhuangzi repeatedly reminds us not to abandon epistemic modesty when we make epistemic progress. That we now see things from a perspective in common with another does not make us both right. Yet, the more comprehensive our perspective, the \u201cclearer\u201d the new gestalt should seem.\n\nThe search for this kind of perspective on ourselves and others seems to motivate Zhuangzi\u2019s willingness to engage and interact with others, seeking to understand their perspective as having a natural status and role for them as ours does for us. This is partly illustrated by common sense examples of our judging from our own current perspective that theirs \u201cadds something\u201d enriching our own perspective by our own lights. Sometimes it\u2019s dangerous to try to mix others\u2019 perspectives with your own.\n\nAnd have you alone not heard tell of those from Shou-ling who studied walking with those in Handan? They never mastered the country\u2019s skill and lost their original way of walking, and stumbled and crawled back. (Ibid., HY45/17/79\u201380)\n\nAside from its frequent usefulness from our point of view, the main benefit from the self-recognition as a natural creature embedded as are others at a perspective-point within a natural network structure is to encourage being open-minded. Part of the value is the humbling of our epistemic pride, mildly disrupting our judgment equilibrium. Without such an occasional perspective on ourselves, we too easily fall into exaggerating our epistemic exceptionalism. The reminder that we are intermingled with others in a web of natural perspectives gives us an appropriate, realistic correction. A Zhuangzi story illustrates such a moment.\n\nZhuangzi was wandering in Diaoling fields when he glimpsed a weird magpie-like-thing flying in from the south. It had a wingspan of over seven-feet and passed so close his forehead, he could feel it. Then it gathered its wings and settled in a chestnut grove. Zhuangzi thought \u201cwhat bird is that? Massive wings of such power and eyes so large it couldn\u2019t see me.\u201d He hiked up his robe and hurriedly tiptoed closer holding his cross-bow at the ready. Then he spotted a cicada settling in the shaded shelter without a worry for itself, but a preying mantis opened its pincers about to grab it, also focused on its gain and ignoring its own bodily danger. The strange magpie burst out and harvested them both\u2014similarly unaware of the natural dangers he faced. But Zhuangzi was suddenly seized with this thought, \u201cWe natural kinds are all interconnected! We two different species are mutually seeing things in our own ways.\u201d He dismantled his crossbow and fled, himself now himself pursued by the game warden shouting out his crimes. (Ibid., HY 54/20/61\u20135)\n\nOverall, Zhuangzi clearly recommends open-minded flexibility as when he scolds Hui Shi for being tied to conventional thinking about how to use giant gourds. He illustrates it again with his story about different uses of a salve that prevents chapping. He models such openness in his conversations with cripples (righteously shunned by Confucians), freaks, thieves, strange creatures, the wind, a shadow and a skull. He imagines many other conversations illustrating the differences of perspectives, capacities and needs.\n\nWhile we cannot help making our own judgments and commitments, he seems to see tolerance and accommodation as values that follow from appreciating other natural perspectives:\n\nA monkey keeper says (to the monkeys) \u201cI\u2019ll give you three [rations] in the morning and four in the evening.\u201d The monkeys seemed angry. \u201cOk, I\u2019ll give you four in the morning and three in the evening.\u201d The monkeys were happy. So with no substantive loss, he could change their anger to happiness. This is an example of a sh\u00ec judgment being dependent on circumstances. So the sage uses sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments to harmonize and rests in the natural balance. And we can call this walking as pairs. (Ibid., HY 5/2/38\u201340)\n\nWe are, as it happens, capable of understanding the perspectives of others well enough to accommodate and cooperate with them, to borrow insights and to reach agreements. However, the Zhuangzi seems skeptical that we can extrapolate from this ordinary capacity to broaden our perspective to having some absolute or comprehensive insight\u2014as it were from all points of view. Nor, as we saw above, can we assume that because the two disputants come to a resolution or agreement, it constitutes knowing from a cosmically or absolutely higher perspective. Hui Shi\u2019s relativism, recall, does point to such an infinite expansion ending in a single universal point of view. Here, however, we are reminded that while we experience a gestalt broadening of perspective as revealing something real and significant (like waking from a dream), we cannot extrapolate from that to the claim to be able to know the final result of such gestalt leaps to broader perspectives.\n\nEven though North Sea Lord denies there is any final or ultimately broad perspective from which we can make sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments, the parable suggests a progressive path toward broader perspectives with those further along having the epistemic status to guide those with less comprehensive perspectives. However, arguments in Chapter 2 suggest that progress must always be judged from a moving frame of reference along a d\u00e0o that is already ch\u00e9ngfixed in our x\u012bnheart-mind that shoots-out the sh\u00ec-f\u0113i.\n\nOur location and trajectory makes us receptive to some and not other avenues of learning. The boy was unable to master the Handan way of walking because of the way he had already learned to walk. The monkey keeper could accommodate the monkeys, but still disagreed with them about the importance of the breakfast-dinner choice. That someone understands and agrees with both of us does not make his judgment correct. The final skepticism concerns whether these paths of progress of perspectives must or will converge on a single outcome.\n\nThe epistemic modesty implicit in Zhuangzi\u2019s skepticism targets mainly the paternalistic, superior attitude toward other points of view exemplified by Confucian and Mohist moralistic posture. When we have an accommodation (you and I come to a common agreement) you and I may both rate it as progress. However, it does not imply we have moved to a higher state of overall insight along an absolute scale\u2014or from any arbitrary third point of view. Exchange of points of view can be valuable to each (perhaps in different ways) and broadening perspective in this way can make us wiser\u2014but always as judged from our already operative \u6210 ch\u00e9ngfixed d\u00e0os . We can advise and recommend our normative perspective on others, but their being able to appreciate and use it depends on their capacities, options and situation.\n\nAt this point, Zhuangzi starts to draw an analogy of dreaming and waking up to the shift in gestalt that comes when we leap to a more comprehensive perspective. At awakening, we immediately appreciate the unreality of the dream, yet within the dream, we can have a similar gestalt shift and dream of having dreamed and interpreted that deeper dream.\n\nHow do I know that loving life is not a form of ignorance? How do I know disliking death is not a weak farewell of the sort when we don\u2019t know about the return? Miss Li Zhi cries when she is betrothed to someone\u2019s son, and when she first goes off to the Jin state soaks her clothing with her tears; but then she arrives at the kings abode, sleeps with the king in his bed, eats fattened livestock and then starts to regret her tears. How do I know the dead do not regret their former clinging to life, We dream of eating and drinking and on awaking cry bitterly, we dream of weeping and wailing and awake in a good mood to go off hunting. When we dream, we don\u2019t know it as a dream, and in our dreams, judge something else as a dream. On awakening, we know it was a dream, and there could be another greater awakening in which we know a greater dream, and under these the conditions the ignorant think they are as enlightened as if they had learned it by an investigation. Gentlemen to shepherds inherently do this! (Ibid., HY 6/2/78\u201383)\n\nSo, is there an ultimate or final possible such shift in gestalt\u2014some final state of knowing what to do? Zhuangzi\u2019s relativism is mildly skeptical because he cannot know either that there is not nor that there is a final or ultimate \u201cawakening\u201d\n\nThe dream theme is memorably carried over to the story of Zhuangzi dreaming a butterfly and/or vice versa. It seems to suggest that the gestalt sense of liberation from error may even be reciprocal. Perhaps our subsequent perspective is one from which most would move to our former perspective. Adolescent conversion can be to or from a religion.\n\nOnce before, Zhuangzi dreamt of being a butterfly, gaily butterflying and himself embodied in this sense of purpose! He knew nothing of Zhuangzi. Suddenly awakening, he then is rooted in Zhuangzi. He doesn\u2019t know if Zhuangzi dreamt being a butterfly or a butterfly is dreaming being Zhuangzi\u2014though there must be a difference. This is called \u201cthings change.\u201d (Ibid., HY7/2/94)\n\nElaborating the complexity this way makes Zhuangzi\u2019s proposals seem disappointing as solutions. They amount to mildly suggesting that we allow the exchange of views to go on without the domination of any dogma and with some vague \u201cglances at natural constancies\u201d and see what comes out \u201cin the long run.\u201d\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s conception of d\u00e0os in nature, from a here-now to a there-then, differs from a Mohist (broadly utilitarian) naturalism. Utilitarianism is a natural constraint, an allegedly single naturally correct way for all of us to choose our course. In effect, Zhuangzi is more of a natural pluralist, with the natural outcome of morality the product of ongoing individual and social construction.\n\nD\u00e0os are in nature but not choices of nature for us. So the discussion, competition, and even strife between d\u00e0os and their advocates are factors in an ongoing natural \u9053 d\u00e0oguiding process. We and our circumstances change as we each find, choose and walk different naturally evolving paths.\n\nThis does not entail we should not advocate our own way. Such exchanges are part of the natural process of construction of \u9053 d\u00e0ospaths and making them available to others. Such a dialogue of competing d\u00e0os constitutes the natural evolutional d\u00e0o of guidance. Realizing this, we should not flatter ourselves, posing as the Confucian father shaping his child\u2019s character, but as a contributor in this competition among similarly natural ways. We express perspectives located in a real world of indexed points from which we choose behavioral paths.\n\nSome characters in Zhuangzi\u2019s dialogues wonder about exceptional figures who allegedly have abilities that justify that paternal posture\u2014the capacity to transcend our location in points of view and to lecture all of us from a privileged perspective. The Zhuangzi\u2019s response typically remind them that such idealized points of view are neither intelligible to us nor relevant to what we should do. Either these exceptional observers have their own naturally ch\u00e9ngfixed frames of reference in the natural world, or they are outside of the natural world in some unrealistically free realm. If the latter, then their views are both unintelligible and irrelevant to us. What they would do in our situation does not constitute helpful advice to us. To advocate following the advice of these ideal observers is to speak practical nonsense to non-ideal, actual actors.\n\nGap Tooth, following Kingsley\u2019s skeptical formulation above says:\n\nSo you don\u2019t know what is beneficial or harmful, does the \u201cfully arrived human\u201d necessarily not know them? Kingsley replied, \u201cthe fully arrived person becomes pure sapience, he could be in a blazing forest and not be able to feel any heat, the rivers of our civilization could freeze and he couldn\u2019t feel any chill, devastating lighting could pulverize mountains and the wind raise a tidal wave and he could not experience surprise. Someone like that could ride on clouds and air, straddle the sun and moon, and wander beyond the four oceans. Death and life are not different for him, much less the inclinations of benefit and harm.\u201d Master Ju Que asked master Zhang Wu, \u201cI\u2019ve heard from my teacher that a sagely man does not find social dealings worth engaging, doesn\u2019t pursue utility, doesn\u2019t avoid harm, doesn\u2019t take delight in striving, doesn\u2019t follow d\u00e0os, in silence says things, and in saying things is silent, and roams outside the nitty-gritty of the actual world. Master regarded this as romantic fantasy but I deem it the execution of a mysterious d\u00e0o. My kind sir what do you say of this?\u201d Zhang Wu replied, \u201cThis is something that, were the yellow emperor to hear, it would be like buzzing, and so how could the likes of Confucius come to know it? Furthermore, you have jumped to conclusions\u2026 . I\u2019ll give you some absurd talk and you absurdly listen.\u201d (Ibid., HY 6/2/71\u20137)\n\nHowever, in later chapters, Zhuangzi himself seems to recommend to us examples of such spectacular capacities\u2014the most beautifully and elaborately expressed of which is the passage celebrating Butcher Ding.\n\nButcher Ding carved an ox for Lord Wen Hui; his point of contact, the way he inclined his torso, his foot position, the angle of his knee \u2026 gliding, flowing! The knife sang \u201cwhuaa\u201d with nothing out of tune. It was as if he were dancing the Faun Ballet or directing an opera. Lord Wen Hui exclaimed \u201cOle! Splendidly done! Can talent extend even to this?. Butcher Ding gestured with his knife, explaining, \u201cWhat your servant pursues is d\u00e0o; which is what skill aims at. When I began to carve oxen, what I saw was nothing but the oxen. After three years, I had ceased seeing them as wholes, and now my sapience mingles so that I don\u2019t see with my eyes, Sensory know-how ends and my sapient desires take over my performance. I rely on natural guiding structures, separate out the great chunks and steer through empty gaps depending on the anatomy. I evade places where cords and filaments intertwine, much less the large bones. A good cook gets a new knife every year; he chops! Mediocre cooks change knives monthly; they hack. My knife now has 19 years on it; it\u2019s carved several thousand oxen and the edge is as if I had just taken it from the sharpener. Those joints have gaps, and the knife\u2019s edge no thickness, to put something infinitesimally thin in an empty space?! Effortless! It even allows the edge wander in with ample room to play. That is why, with 19 years on it, this knife\u2019s edge is grindstone fresh.\u201d (Ibid., 7/3/2\u20138)\n\nThe Zhuangzi plays several variations on this theme. Sometimes the virtuoso performer catches cicadas on a sticky rod, another crafts chariot wheels, there are musicians, debaters, and thieves. The theme extends to animals, millipedes with their expertise in coordinating their limbs while maintaining a smooth flow, snakes flashing by while slithering on their stomachs, One implicit example is Zhuangzi\u2019s own relation with his relativist rival and buddy, Hui Shi. Bemoaning his loss while visiting his sidekick\u2019s grave, Zhuangzi spins a tale of a virtuoso ax-thrower who sliced specks off the nose of his crony, but lost his \u201cknack\u201d when his co-performer passed away. (Ibid., HY 66/24/48\u201351)\n\nThe tales often highlight the tranquil state that accompanies behavior that skillfully follows a natural path. The performances look and feel effortless. The spontaneity of the flow along a natural path gives performers the sense that their behavior is \u201cworld-guided\u201d rather than internally controlled. These behaviors become second-nature. We move beyond anything like sub-vocalizing instructions, deliberating or reflecting\u2014and yet we are concentrating intently on the behavior. The range of his examples reminds us that such satisfying states of performance can be experienced in even the most low caste and mundane of activities, including butchering, criminal skills, as well as in the finest of arts, "}, {"url": "https://wiki.alquds.edu/?query=King_Zhuang_of_Chu", "page_content": "King of Chu\n\n\"Wangzi Wu\" Bronze Ding. The inscription inside the Ding documents that Prince Wu worshipped his ancestors and prayed for his offspring.

His personal name was Xiong L\u00fc (Chinese: \u718a\u65c5; pinyin: Xi\u00f3ng L\u01da), his ancestral name was Mi (Chinese: \u8288; pinyin: M\u01d0), and his posthumous title was King Zhuang. He was one of the five rulers dubbed the Five Hegemons by Xunzi and attempted to wrest control of China from King Ding of Zhou.[1]\n\nThe son of King Mu of Chu, Zhuang ascended the throne in 613 BC. According to a legend in the Records of the Grand Historian, for the first three years of his reign Zhuang wasted time in pleasure seeking, but, when challenged by two courtiers, reformed his ways.[2]\n\nThe king made Sunshu Ao his chancellor. Sunshu Ao began a series of major dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir in modern-day northern Anhui province.\n\nAfter some military successes, King Zhuang attempted to usurp King Ding of Zhou. According to a well-known story, probably an invention of the Warring States period, he asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the legendary Nine Tripod Cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China, but was rebuffed.

Intuitionism. Skepticism v. Dogmatic Monism. Interpretive Issues. Practical Implications. Chuang Tzu (Chuang Chou, ca, 360 BC), along with Lao Tzu, is a defining figure in Chinese Taoism. Chuang Tzu probably authored only parts of the first 7 chapters of the present text, the so-called Inner Chapters. The others were written either by followers of thinkers of related but different theoretical orientations. They often expand on themes in the \"inner\" chapters. See SCHOOL OF CHUANG TZU for a more complete discussion of the \"outer\" chapters. The relation between the two founding figures of Taoism is a growing puzzle. Tradition treats Chuang Tzu as following Lao Tzu. We know of Chuang Tzu's life only what we can surmise from the text, which hardly confirms that traditional story. On the contrary, along with recent archeological discoveries, the text makes it as plausible that Chuang Tzu was the original Daoist. Graham speculates that Chuang Tzu may have been responsible for Lao Tzu's being regarded as a Taoist by using him as a fictional figure in his dialogues. Chuang Tzu used Lao Tzu's voice because he could \"talk down\" to Confucius. The message Chuang Tzu placed in Lao Tzu's mouth shared enough with the popular but anonymous text that people subsequently came to identify it as The Lao Tzu. This article will treat the Chuang Tzu without assuming he \"followed\" or inherited Taosim from Lao Tzu. This is only partly because of the textual issues complicating the traditional story. Using that story also complicates the interpretive task in requiring settling all the interpretive questions surrounding Lao Tzu's text. These are at least as stubborn as those in the Chuang Tzu. This article will simply treat Chuang Tzu as a philosophical discussant dealing with the central philosophical issues in his context. He shares both terminology and background assumptions with the other major philosophical figures. In particular, we will not presuppose that Taoists change the meaning of tao from its usual ethical sense to a, distinctively Taoist, metaphysical sense. Any metaphysical properties of a tao will, I assume, be those plausible to attribute to a guide to behavior. Chuang Tzu's familiarity with and confident handling of the technical language of ancient Chinese semantics make it probable that he had the ancient Chinese equivalent of analytic philosophical training. It is, thus, no accident that even philosophers skeptical of the general philosophical quality of Chinese thought hold him in the highest regard. The more likely candidate as Chuang Tzu's mentor (or philosophical colleague and friend) may be the monistically inclined dialectician Hui Shih (370-319 BC). Chuang Tzu mourns Hui Shih's death as depriving him of the person on whom he sharpened his wits. Chuang Tzu's key strategy for combating the ancient Chinese version of realism seems to come from Hui Shih. This article will therefore start with Hui Shih's theses (which are not included in THE LATER MOHISTS). In any case, our only source of information about them is The Chuang Tzu. Hui Shih's theory, furthermore, is crucial to understanding Chuang Tzu's philosophical position especially in relation to the Later Mohists. Chuang Tzu, despite his obvious affection, is ultimately critical of Hui Shih's monism and his optimism that debate and analysis would resolve philosophical issues. Traditional accounts have reckoned this as the mystic Chuang Tzu's haughty disdain for logic. However, Hui Shih's doctrines deal with philosophy of language more than with logic. So if we resist reading Chuang Tzu as following Lao Tzu, a strikingly different view of their dynamic emerges. Hui Shih (probably the more politically active) emerges as an erudite, enthusiastic, loquacious but somewhat confused, rather mystical, semantic dilettante. Chuang Tzu, in contrast, appears as a language theorist par excellence. Chuang Tzu reports enjoying debating with Hui Shih precisely because he was one of few with enough learning to be worth refuting. Still, he was ultimately a soft target for a dialectician of Chuang Tzu's caliber. Hui Shih's Teaching The \"Empire\" chapter of the Chuang Tzu contains an account of Hui Shih's doctrines. It comprises part of the first \"history of Philosophy\" in China--tracing the progression of different tao (doctrines) leading up to Chuang Tzu. We can understand Hui Shih's motivation best by viewing these passages against the background of the realist theory of language given by the LATER MOHISTS. These realists motivated their doctrine using the idea that real-world similarities and differences provide the basis for the conventional \"carving\" or \"picking out\" that divides thing kinds. They used a mereological version of a rudimentary natural kinds theory to explain how words and language work in guiding action in real situations. Hui Shih, we theorize, tried to undermine the Mohist semantic/metaphysical proposal by looking at comparative terms. They also mark distinctions in things, but it is less plausible that the distinctions are in the world. Where we draw the distinction depends on the context of the comparison. Whether this ant is large or small depends on varies when we are implicitly comparing it with other ants or with animals. Hui Shih focuses on such distinctions as large/small, thick/thin, high/low, south/north, and today/yesterday. Their common feature is that from different points of view we can assign either member of the term-pair to the same object. His typical paradox makes sense as a comment about how we might redescribe familiar paradigms from a distant perspective. Heaven is as low as the earth; Mountains are level with marshes.\n\nThe sun from one perspective is in the middle from another declining.\n\nNatural kinds are from one perspective living and from one dying.\n\nI go to Yue today and arrive yesterday. The most important result for theory of language strikes at the Achilles heel of Mohist realism--the construction of similarity classes. The ten-thousand thing-kinds are ultimately alike and ultimately different. This is called the great similarity-difference. As the Chuang Tzu develops this insight, it amounts to the claim that we can find a difference between any two things no matter how alike they are and we can find a similarity between any two things no matter how different. So even if there are objective similarities and differences, they do not justify any particular way of distinguishing between thing kinds. For every category and name we use, we could have had conventions that as consistently and with equal 'world-guidedness' divide stuff up differently. The list of Hui Shih's sayings, however, begins and ends with claims about ultimate reality. He presupposes an ultimate perspective and an \"everything\" concept. Since distinctions are not in things, reality must be \"one.\" His formulation invites the view (usually attributed to Taoists) that reality is a single, indivisible totality. The ultimately great, which has nothing outside it, call it the Great One!\n\nThe ultimately small, which has nothing inside it, call it the Small One!\n\nUniversally love the ten-thousand thing-kinds; the cosmos is one t'i (substantive part). The concluding statement echoes the Mohists' ethical doctrine of universal love and employs their technical term t'i. The Chuang Tzu account does not give us Hui Shih's reasoning, so we cannot be sure of his reasoning and intended implications of these formulae. However, it is tempting to read the conclusion as the familiar fallacy of inferring absolute claims from relative premises. Most interpreters follow Hui Shih in supposing that it is rational to conclude that all distinctions distort reality. However, if all distinctions are relative to some perspective, then, we have no basis to conclude anything about absolute reality. We have no rational access to a perspective from which it has no distinctions. Since interpreters commonly treat all Taoists as taking this view, we should start out by noting that the Chuang Tzu presentation of Hui Shih's views concludes: \"He had many perspectives and his library would fill five carts, but his doctrine was self-contradictory and his language did not hit the target: the intent to make sense of things.\" Chuang Tzu, we may presume, understood the Later Mohist proof of the incoherence of denying all distinctions. Consider also Graham's speculation about Gongsun Long's \"Pointing and Things\" (see LATER MOHISM) and the argument that we can't point to an ultimate one. Whether or not Gongsun Long rejected the inference to an \"everything\" concept, Chuang Tzu clearly did. Chuang Tzu almost paraphrases Hui Shih in his rebuttal: 'The cosmos and I were born together, the ten-thousand things and I are one.' Now, having already constructed a 'one' is it possible to say something about it? Having already called it a 'one' can we fail to say something about it? 'One' and saying it make two. Two and one make three and going from here, even a skilled calculator can't keep up with us, let alone an ordinary man. Chuang Tzu: Skeptical Perspectivalism. Chuang Tzu had a unique philosophical style that contributes to the tendency to treat him as an irrationalist. He wrote philosophical fantasy rather than direct argument. Western readers interpret this style as signaling a romantic rejecting reason and analysis. The dichotomy, however, is hard to motivate in the Chinese philosophical context. We find no counterpart of the human faculty of reason (or its logical correlate) still less of the contrast of reason and emotion. Chuang Tzu's highleted the term, ch'ing which Buddhist's eventually co-opted to translate 'passion' or 'emotion'. However, it makes most sense in the Chuang Tzu it as 'reality', or 'the facts'. A more plausible hypothesis is that he presents his positions in fantasy dialogues to illustrate and conform to his perspectivalism. He puts positions up for consideration as if endorsing them, then reflectively abandons them. He does this either in the form of a fanciful conversation carried on among fantastic creatures (rebellious thieves, distorted freaks, or converted Confucians) or as an internal monologue. In his fantasy dialogues, Chuang Tzu seems to challenge us to guess which voice is really his. Even his monologues typically end a double rhetorical question in place of a conclusion.\"Then is there really any X? Or is there no X?\" One key to Chuang Tzu's use of Hui Shih's relativism is his application to the concept of \"use.\" Everything is useful from some position or other and there are some positions from which even the most useful thing is useless. Chuang Tzu illustrates this theme with his famous parables of the huge \"useless\" tree that, consequently, never got chopped down and the huge gourd that was useless to eat, but might make a good boat. Thus pragmatic arguments (like those of MO TZU) will always be relative to some controversial values. This observation does not justify our abandoning pragmatic arguments (which as we will see below, Chuang Tzu still uses). It only prompts us to be sensitive to how controversial our assumptions about \"success\" might be. Chuang Tzu develops perspectivalism in a more consistent direction than did Hui Shih. Possibly because of his knowledge of the Mohist refutation, he does not fall into the trap of rejecting language (as arguably Lao Tzu did). Being natural does not require abandoning language. Human language, from the empty greetings and small talk to the disputes of philosophers, is as natural a 'noise' is are bird songs. Disputing philosophers are 'pipes of nature'. Chuang Tzu's use of this metaphor signals that nothing he is going to say entails that disputation should stop any more than it does that brooks should stop babbling. Then he considers an objection to his opening metaphor: Language is not blowing breath; language users have language. That which it languages, however, is never fixed. He develops this critique (perhaps initiated by Hui Shih's relativism) with his own analysis of the indexicality of all distinctions. His argument relies heavily on the core terms of Chinese philosophical analysis, shih (is this: right) and fei (not this: wrong). (For details, especially in why reflections about shih-fei extend to language in general see SHI-FEI.) He starts by highlighting the indexical content of shih by contrasting it with pi (that). Chuang Tzu asks if anything is inherently 'this' or 'that'? Is there anything that cannot be 'this' or 'that'? These key terms in language illustrate the claim that it does not have any rigid, naming relation to an external reality. Language traces our changing position relative to reality. This perspectival pluralism differs from Western subjectivity in that Chuang Tzu does not highlight the perspectives of individual consciousness or internal representations--subjectivity. Arguably Chinese thinkers did not generate anything comparable to Western folk psychology. (See PHILOSOPHY OF MIND.) In fact, Chuang Tzu seems as fascinated with the shifting perspectives of even the same person at different times and in different moods as he is in the difference of perspective between different individuals. His main theoretical focus, however, is on the kinds of perspective arising from using language differently, i.e., being influenced by a different moral discourse. Chuang Tzu does reflect briefly on the perspective of \"self.\" Recalling Laozi's emphasis on contrasts, he sees it as arising as a contrast or distinction with \"other.\" He suggests the deeper source of the distinction is our inability to identify the source of \"pleasure, anger, sadness, joy, forthought, regret, change, and immobility\". They \"alternate day and night\" and not knowing where they come from we give up and merely accept that they come. Without them there would be no \"self\" and without \"self,\" no \"choosing of one thing over another.\" He notes the inevitability of our assumption that there is some \"true ruler\" harmonizing and oganizing the self, then adds, skeptically, that we never find any sign of it. Intuitionism Confucians, particularly idealistic Confucians (See MENCIUS) do identify a \"natural ruler'--the moral heart. Chuang Tzu wonders how the heart can be any more natural than the other \"hundred joints, nine openings and six viscera.\" Does there need to be a ruler? Can't each rule itself? Or take turns. The identification of one organ as supreme seems to conflict with the implicit intention to offer a natural basis for morality. (Mencius deals with this problem in connection with the distinction between nature and fate--see MENCIUS.) Chuang Tzu implies that all of the organs of the body grow together in encountering and adapting to life. As it does it is ch'eng (completed)--a term that Chuang Tzu uses somewhat ironically as suggesting that any completion leaves in its wake some defect. Translators frequently render it as \"biased.\" That works well for understanding this criticism of idealistic Confucianism, for Mencius seems indeed to suggest that the heart does acquire a shih-fei direction from its upbringing. The translation, however, abandons the implicit irony--ch'eng is 'success', 'accomplishment' something we all aim for. Chuang Tzu's use suggests that our natural and common goal is not possible without some kind of skewing and loss. Thus all hearts equally achieve ch'eng. They grow up just as the rest of the body does. For the heart, this amounts to acquiring a pattern of tendencies to shih-fei judgment. (See MENCIUS) Every person's heart acquires some pattern or other. So if it is this heart, the one that grows with the body, that is the authority, then we all equally have one. Confucian innatists make a question-begging assumption about which pattern of ch'eng (completion) is really right. They advocate a program of cultivation so the hsin (heart-mind) will give the correct shih-fei judgments. Without it, they imply, the heart's natural potential will be lost. The sage's heart-mind is the ultimate Mencian standard for rightness of judgment. He is one who has allegedly fully cultivated his natural moral potential. Chuang Tzu wonders, from what perspective can we distinguish sage's heart-mind from a fool's? Both have a heart-mind and make shih-fei judgments. If we use A's judgments as a guide, A will look like a sage and B the fool and vice versa. There appears to be no way to identify the proper way to cultivate common to all existing heart-minds. The intuitionists beg another question in favor of their acquired perspective when they advocate cultivation. The appeal to the judgment of a \"natural ruler\" would leave everyone acting however they do act. Chuang Tzu's analysis of the ch'eng hsin (completed heart-mind) echoes Lao Tzu's analysis of knowledge as unconsciously acquired in the very process of learning language. Attitudes that seem natural and spontaneous may simply reflect early upbringing and experiential attitudes that have become \"second nature.\" No innate or spontaneous dispositions survive without ch'eng influences. Chuang Tzu says that for there to be a shih-fei in the heart without its being put there in the process of ch'eng is \"like going to y\ufffdeh today and arriving yesterday!\" Skepticism v. Dogmatic Monism The linguistic nature of perspectives comes more to the fore when Chuang Tzu responds to the Later Mohists. He notes that the Mohists' term of analysis, ke (assertable), is obviously relative to conventional, linguistic perspective. Different and changing conventions of usage and principles still constitute conventions and generate a language and a perspective. Single schools of thought may split and disputing factions may combine again. Any language that actually is spoken is assertable. Any moral language for which there is a rival is (from its point of view) not assertable. Chuang Tzu hints that the confidence we get in the appearance of right and wrong in our language is a function of how fully we can elaborate and embellish--how effectively we can continue on with our way of speaking. We argue for a point of view mainly by spelling it out in greater detail. The seemingly endless disputes between Mohists and Confucians arise from their respectively elaborated ways of assigning 'is this' and 'not this'. As we saw, each can build elaborate hierarchies of standards that seem to guide their different choices and considers the errors of their opponents to be \"obvious.\" Chuang Tzu, wary of Hui Shih's error, generally avoided contrasting our limited perspectives to any cosmic or total one. He contrasted them mainly with each other. His 'perspective' on the relativity of language Chuang Tzu calls ming (clarity). It is tempting and common to suppose ming is some absolute standpoint. Chuang Tzu extrapolates in imagination what would happen if we reversed our course back to the 'axis' from which all guiding discourse begins. From that 'axis,' he says, no limit can be drawn on what could be treated as 'is this' or 'is not this'. All shih-fei patterns are possible, none actual. From that axis, therefore, we make no judgments. It is not a relevant alternative to the disputing perspectives. If we succumb to the interpretive temptation, we fall back into the anti-language abyss. The absolute viewpoint cannot advocate or forbid any dao. From the perspective of ming, it is not even a point of view. Any practical guide is an actual path of judgment making that takes one from that axis down one particular (indefinitely elaboratable) way of making distinctions. Even if thing-kinds are made 'so' by our classifications, we can't conclude they are 'not-this'. Chuang Tzu emphasizes the infinite possibility of these standpoints. Occasionally, however, he presents it as almost a tragic inevitability. Once we have started on a tao, we seem doomed to elaborate and develop it in a kind of race to death. Youth is the state of being comparatively open to almost any possibility and as we grow and gain knowledge, we close-off the possibilities in a rush toward old-age and death. The inflexibility of intellectual commitment to a conceptual perspecive that is so rigid that any thing we encounter already has a classification. Nothing can free us from the headlong rush to complete our initial committments to shih and fei as if they were oaths or treaties. We rush through life clining to the alternative we judge as winning. \"Is life really as stupid as this? Or is it that I am the only stupid one and there are others not so stupid.\" Lacking any theoretical limit on possible perspectives, guiding systems of naming, we lack any limit on schemes of practical knowledge. No matter how much we advance and promote a practical guide, a way of dealing with things, there are things we will be deficient at. To have any developed viewpoint is to leave something out. This, however, is not a reason to avoid language and a perspective; it is the simple result of the limitless knowledge and limited lives. So-called 'sages' project their point of view and prejudices on nature, which they then treat as an authority. 'Those who have arrived' allegedly know to deem everything as one. Chuang Tzu does not recommend we emulate that attitude. Instead of trying to transcend and abandon our usual or conventional ways of speaking, Chuang Tzu recommends that we learn to treat them as pragmatically useful. They enable us to communicate and get things done. That is all it is sensible to ask of them. Beyond what is implied in the fact that our language is useful (from the standards of our perspective), we don't know the way things are in themselves. We signal our lack of that pure metaphysical knowledge by calling reality 'tao'. Treating metaphysical ultimate as 'one' differs from saying nothing about it only in attitudinal ways. In the end, neither skepticism nor monistic mysticism says anything about ultimate reality. They are characterized by the different attitudes one takes in saying (essentially) nothing. Chuang Tzu's balance between skepticism and monism surfaces in a number of places. In one he traces the \"devolution\" of the knowledge of old from knowing \"nothing exists\" to knowing \"one\" to knowing things but no distinctions or boundaries and finally to knowing shih-fei. In another notoriously obscure passage, Chuang Tzu is skeptical about skepticism. However, he does not appeal to our familiar sentential grounds. (He does not ask how he knows that he doesn't know. He does ask how he can know what he does not know.) His question centers on distinction grounds. (He wonders if he knows how to distinguish between knowing and ignorance). Chuang Tzu's philosophical writings highlight his different approach to skepticism by their treatment of dreams. He does not use dreaming to motivate skepticism. He takes it as already motivated on semantic grounds. (Is there any real relation between our words and things?) Dreaming then becomes a further illustration of a skepticism rooted in worries about whether there is a right way to distinguish with or \"pick out\" using a word. The dreaming-waking distinction is one we use to organize \"what happens\" (in the broadest sense). We have learned to use that distinction to bring greater unity or coherence to our experience. In a dream we can still make the distinction between dreaming and waking. Ultimately we can wonder about other ways (the pragmatic advantages) of making that distinction. Chuang Tzu fulfills his heart's desire in dreaming the butterfly. He doesn't know how to distinguish Chuang Tzu's dreaming a butterfly from a butterfly's dreaming Chuang Tzu. (Translations convert the distinction-point into a propostional one.) Interpretive Issues Because Chuang Tzu puts his positions in fantasy and parable, interpretions of his point are inherently subject to dispute. (Perhaps Chuang Tzu intended this outcome.) We can either attribute to him what actually follows from perspectival pluralism or attribute some familiar but invalid conclusion. Some interpreters read it as monism (entailing dogmatic skepticism--everyone is wrong), others as classic relativism (everyone is right!). Neither of these, however, follow from perspectivalism. For each, one may cite passages where the position is forumulated, but it is always left unclear whether the passages express Chuang Tzu's considered point of view or is merely one on which he is critically reflecting. Some of Chuang Tzu's most memorable images and parables illustrate the interpretive impasse. Chuang Tzu tells us of an encounter between a Giant Sea Turtle and a frog in a well. It is natural to suggest the Sea Turtle represents some ultimate truth not accessible to the frog (as does the Chinese parable based on the story). However, in Chuang Tzu's account, the sea turtle cannot even get one flipper into the frog's well. He is as incapable of appreciating the frog's perspective as the frog is his. Similar analysis applies to the Great Bird and the small chicadee, the great fish etc. Chuang Tzu is the least likely thinker to take \"great\" and \"small\" as signs of absolute value. The dogmatic monistic reading relies on the epistemology of mysticism. Chuang Tzu must have some unexplained route to meta-knowledge that everyone else lacks. The burden of this interpretation is showing that Chuang Tzu's arguments do not undermine the conception of knowledge proposed by the interpreter. The above refutation of Mencius seems to apply mutatis mutandis to any view of a special transcendent insight or intuition. It is not clear how he could be astute enough to see the fallacy in Mencius' view and naive enought to turn around and adopt what is effectively the same view except for its talk of a natural organ. The relativistic interpretation is plausible to the extent that Chuang Tzu clearly views all existing points of view as natural points of view. Saying they are natural (smoothing them on the whetstone of nature) is neither to approve nor to judge them equal. Nature's standpoint is the one from which Chuang Tzu removes the traditional authority. Other schools (with the exception of the LATER MOHISTS) thought identifying a tao (guide) as t'ian (natural or heavenly) was the goal. For Chuang Tzu, the goal is too easily reached to be of any prescriptive help. All we can say is \"it is\"--equally true of all perspectives we encounter--including those of other animals. Chuang Tzu implies that judgments about perspecives--particularly judgments about value--presuppose some perspective--a tao. He substitutes the authority of tao for the authority of t'ien. Any evaluative judgment that different tao are equal must be a result of a) taking some perspective for granted or b) concluding that we should not make any judgment. Getting an absolute conclusion from Chuang Tzu's perspectivalism encourages the reading according to which tao has become The Tao. What is the alternative? Chuang Tzu thinks we must stand on a point and his standpoint is his perspective on perspectives--ming (discrimination). It is not The viewpoint but Chuang Tzu is implicitly promoting it. That perspective, however, countenances all kinds of judgments about a number of other perspectives--approving some more than others. The problem with (b) is that, given Chuang Tzu's view of the relation of language and judgment, it amounts to saying that we should stop speaking--which we concluded above, we should avoid attributing to Chuang Tzu. The safest solution is to assume he does make judgments from his perspective on perspectives. He does not, in doing so, presume it is an absolute, total or cosmic perspective. It is, as he admits, \"of a type with the others\" still he can only make judgments from the perspective and gives no reason to stop making judgments in adopting it. Saying it is a perepecive is not a condemnation. It requires only the realization that there are other perspectives. We do not need to presuppose some absolute or total view to recognize that our views are partial. Nor need it imply that the perspectives are mistaken about something. Chuang Tzu's emphasis is epistemological not metaphysical. His frequent suggestions that there could be a fantastically adept and successful tao (e.g., that one might reach the point of being able to endure fire, cold, lightning and wind, to harnass natural powers, to travel immense distances) require two things. One is that there is some actual world with real properties which some tao reflect and other do not. The other is that we use our present standards of success (desires, fantasies, goals, delights etc.) to evaluate the practical success of alternative perspectives. Practical Implications Chuang Tzu's perspectivalism is offered in a philosophical context in which it is expected that a philosophy will have some practical point. No practical moral seems to follow from absolute skepticism, monism nor from relativism. In any case, we seem to have to take Chuang Tzu to be reflectively aware that any advice that he offers is advice from a perspective--the ming perspective on perspectives. What advice does follow from that insight into the nature of knowledge. We have already hinted at a couple of the practical points--both of which have to be carefully circumscribed for coherence. First, Chuang Tzu mildly recommends a kind of perspective flexibility. The recommendation is like the recommendation to be young. To be young is to be open to new ways to think and conceptualize things. The more committed you get to a scheme, as we saw, the \"older\" you become intellectually until you are dead from the very act of learning. This first practical line is paradoxical on several grounds. First, any reason we may have for being flexible in adopting or tolerant to other points of view has to be a reason that motivates us from our present point of view. We have to be able now to envision that the altrnative way of thinking will help us achieve things that we presently value better than our present scheme does. Not any other point of view will be a candidate for this kind of openness. So this would not be an abstract argument for any kind of openness. Thus Chuang Tzu is not, as some have argued, required to be tolerant of Nazism, say. Remember that Chuang Tzu's ming is still rooted in our present point of view--it is not some cosmic kind of tolerance that says anything goes. Judgment is not only still possible, it is still inescapable. Second, the motivation for being open to a point of view is because of the potential of acquiring it (thus closing off the possibilities of its rivals). The naivete of youth is valuable only because it represents the possibility of mature sophistication. If we were to take the invitation to openness as an abstract good, then his perspectivalism would give us no reason to value it. The second practical point is a negative one. We suppose that one of the reactions to the difficulties of defending moral conventions where these are controversial (say in advocating moral reform in the sense that one advocates that the culture or society alter its moral attitudes) is to reject all conventions. As we have noted, the LATER MOHISTS showed that this posture as applied to language is incoherent. And Chuang Tzu seems to say only that we don't have to--not that we should or shouldn't. However, he does add that the usual is useful and thus interchangeable and that is all we can ask of it. So the second bit of \"advice\" is simply not to waste conventions that are useful. Clearly, again, this must be useful from one's present point of view, values and standards. The third possible item of practical advice forms a long and controversial section in which Chuang Tzu draws a more favorable portrait of specialization. His example is consistent with Aristotle's observation that human life offers no more fulfilling activity than the exercise of some acquired skill. Highly honed skills invite paradoxical, almost mystical, description. In performance we seem to experience a unity of actor and action. Such practice is a way of losing oneself as one might in contemplation or in a trance. The accuracy of our own actions sometimes mystify us. We do not understand how we did it--we certainly cannot explain it to others. Here is Chuang Tzu's account: Cook Ting was slicing up an oxen for Lord Wenhui. At every push of his hand, every angle of his shoulder, every step with his feet, every bend of his kneezip! zoop! he slithered the knife along with a zing, and all was in perfect rhythm, as though he were dancing to Mulberry Grove or keeping time as in Qingshou music. \"Ah, this is marvelous!\" said Lord Wenhui. \"Imagine skill reaching such heights!\" Cook Ting laid down his knife and replied, \"What I care about is a tao which advances my skill. When first I began cutting up oxen, I could see nothing that was not ox. After three years, I never saw a whole ox. And nownow I go at it by spirit and do not look with my eyes. Controlling knowledge has stopped and my spirit wills the performance. I depend on the natural makeup, cut through the creases, guide through fissures. I depend on things as they are. So I never touch the smallest ligament or tendon, much less bone.\" \"A good cook changes his knife once a yearbecause he cuts. A mediocre cook changes his knife once a monthbecause he hacks. I have had this knife of mine for nineteen years and I've cut up thousands of oxen with it. Yet the blade is as good as if it had just come from the grindstone. . . . \" \"Despite that, I regularly come to the end of what I am used to. I see its being hard to carry on. I become alert; my gaze comes to rest. I slow down my performance and move the blade with delicacy. Then zhrup! it cuts through and falls to the ground. I stand with the knife erect, look all around, deem it wonderfully fulfilling, strop the knife and put it away.\" Traditional interpreters stress the mystical flavor, the reference to tao. One way to read the claim that tao advances skill is as the claim that it surpasses skill. This traditional commitment to a mystical, monistic tao requires that accomplishment not be related in ordinary ways to practice and skill. It must come from some sudden and inexplicable insight, mystical experience or attitude. This interpretation coincides with a familiar Zen view. The absolutist monistic interpretation should resist the suggestion that Ting knows his tao and still can improve. How can you have some of a tao that has no parts? When you have it you suspend entirely all thought and sensation. Cook Ting's story clashes slightly with this religious or mystical view of Chuang Tzu's advice. His description implies that Ting has a hold on a particular way of doing one thing. Ting's way is developing. He continues to progress in pursuing his skill by tracing his tao to points beyond his previous training. When he comes to a hard part, he has to pay attention, make distinctions, try them out and then move on. This supports the view that developing skill eventually goes beyond what we can explain with concepts, distinctions, or language. The focus required for a superb performance may not be compatible with a deliberating self-consciousness. The Butcher does not say that he began at that level of skill. He does not report any sudden conversion where some mystical insight flowed into him. He does not say that he could just get in tune with the absolute Tao and become a master butcher automatically. And he does not hint that by being a master butcher, he is in command of all the skills of life. He could not use his level of awareness at will to become a master jet pilot or a seamstress. His is not an account of some absolute, single, prior tao but of the effect of mastering some particular tao. We all recognize the sense of responsive awareness which seems to suspend self-other consciousness. It is natural to express this ideal of skill mastery in the language which suggests mystical awareness. It does normally involve suspension of selfconsciousness, ratiocination and seems like surrender to an external force. That language should not confuse us, however. Chuang Tzu's mingillumination should help us see that the full experience is compatible with having his perspective on perspectives. Cook Ting can be aware that others may have different ways to dissect an ox. He simply cannot exercise his skill while he is trying to choose among them. We lose nothing in appreciating the multiple possibilities of ways to do things. In realizing a tao of some activity in us, we make it real in us. It is neither a mere, inert, cognition of some external force nor a surrender to a structure already innate in us. Note, further, that Cook Ting's activity is cutting--dividing something into parts. When he is mastering his guiding tao, he perceives a world in which the ox is already cut up. He comes to see the holes and fissures and spaces as inherent in nature. That seems a perfect metaphor for our coming to see the world as divided into the natural kinds that correspond to our mastery of terms. When we master a tao we must be able to execute it in a real situation. It requires finding the distinctions (concepts) used in instruction as mapping on nature. We don't have time, anymore, to read the map, we begin to see ourselves as reading the world. Mastering any tao thus yields this sense of harmony with the world. It is as if the world, not the instructions, guides us. This feature of tao mastery explains the temptation to read Taoist use as having become metaphysical. Guidance may, in the first instance, be broadly linguistic--telling, pointing, modeling. The choice of a butcher for this parable seems significant too. Butchering is seldom held as a noble profession. Even the \"Ting\" may be significant--it may not be the cook's name but a sign of relatively low rank--something like an also-ran. Other popular examples of the theme include the cicada catcher and wheelwright. Chuang Tzu probably intends to signal that this level of expertise is available within any activity. Common interpretations, however, suggest that some activities are ruled out. The examples above, together with Chuang Tzu's obvious delight in parable, fantasy, and poetry invite the common hypothesis that, in the West, he would be a romantic--suspicious of direct, reasoned, logical discourse in favor of the more \"emotional\" arts. At least, one should eschew \"intellectual\" activities. That he is critical of Hui Shih, the alleged logician, supports this reading. The problem is that Chuang Tzu's parallels his comments about Hui Shih with similar comments about a lute player. Furthermore, the criticism does not seem to be the activity, but the search for absolute know-how. Chuang Tzu's \"criticism\" is that in being good at X, these paradigms of skill are miserably inept at Y. This is another example of ch'eng (completion) which Chuang Tzu argues is always accompanied by hui (defect). We may achieve this absorption in performance by achieving skill at any tao--dancing, skating, playing music, butchering, chopping logic, lovemaking, skiing, using language, programming computers, throwing pottery, or cooking. At the highest levels of skill, we reach a point where we seem to transcend our own selfconsciousness. What once felt like a skill developing inside us, begins to feel like control from the natural structure of things. Our normal ability to respond to complex feedback bypasses conscious processing. In our skilled actions, we have internalized a heightened sensitivity to the context. These reflections lead us to a problem with \"achieve tao mastery\" as a prescription. I shall argue that the problems are both textual and theoretical. On other places, (as we noted above) Chuang Tzu is more equivocal about the value of mastery. Any mastery, Chuang Tzu notes, must leave something out. Most particularly, to master any skill is to ignore others. Chuang Tzu remarks that masters are frequently not good teachers. They fail to transmit their mastery to their sons or disciples. Chuang Tzu directs our attention to this problem with the glorification of total skill dedication and mastery. We trade any accomplishment at one skill for ineptitude at some other thing. The absent minded professor is our own favorite parody. If the renowned practitioners have reached completion, he says, then so has everyone. If they have not, then no one can. From the hinge of ways perspective, we no more value the world's top chess player than the world's finest jack of all trades. We need not read Chuang Tzu as advocating specialization per se. Thus the three parts in Chuang Tzu's dao pull in separate directions and we must treat each as tentative and conditional. The flexibilty advice seems hard to follow if we also accept convention and work for single-minded mastery. That, in the end, may the message of perspectivalism. We have limits, but we might as well get on with it."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Qin-Shi-Huang", "page_content": "Shihuangdi was buried in a 20-square-mile (50-square-km) funerary compound now known as the Qin tomb , near Xi\u2019an , China . It contains some 8,000 life-sized terra-cotta soldiers and horse figures that formed an army to defend Shihuangdi\u2019s tomb.\n\nShihuangdi was emperor of the Qin dynasty (221\u2013210 BCE) and the creator of the first unified Chinese empire. He is also known for his interest in immortality, his huge funerary compound that contains some 8,000 life-sized terra-cotta soldiers, and for his contribution to the Great Wall of China .\n\nQin Shi Huang , also called Shihuangdi , Wade-Giles romanization Shih-huang-ti , personal name (xingming) Zhao Zheng or Ying Zheng , (born c. 259 bce, Qin state, northwestern China\u2014died 210 bce, Hebei), emperor (reigned 221\u2013210 bce) of the Qin dynasty (221\u2013207 bce) and creator of the first unified Chinese empire (which collapsed, however, less than four years after his death).\n\nUntil Zheng was officially declared of age in 238, his government was headed by L\u00fc Buwei. Zheng\u2019s first act as king was to execute his mother\u2019s lover, who had joined the opposition, and to exile L\u00fc, who had been involved in the affair. A decree ordering the expulsion of all aliens, which would have deprived the king of his most competent advisers, was annulled at the urging of Li Si , later grand councillor. By 221, with the help of espionage, extensive bribery, and the ruthlessly effective leadership of gifted generals, Zheng had eliminated one by one the remaining six rival states that constituted China at that time, and the annexation of the last enemy state, Qi , in 221 marked his final triumph: for the first time China was united, under the supreme rule of the Qin.\n\nWhen Zheng, at age 13, formally ascended the throne in 246 bce, Qin already was the most powerful state and was likely to unite the rest of China under its rule. The central states had considered Qin to be a barbarous country , but by that time its strong position on the mountainous western periphery (with its centre in the modern province of Shaanxi) enabled Qin to develop a strong bureaucratic government and military organization as the basis of the totalitarian state philosophy known as legalism .\n\nZhao Zheng was born the son of Zhuangxiang (who later became king of the state of Qin in northwestern China) while his father was held hostage in the state of Zhao. His mother was a former concubine of a rich merchant, L\u00fc Buwei , who, guided by financial interests, managed to install Zhuangxiang on the throne, even though he had not originally been designated as successor. The tradition, once widely accepted, that Zheng was actually L\u00fc Buwei\u2019s natural son is probably a slanderous invention.\n\nEmperor of China\n\nTo herald his achievement, Zheng assumed the sacred titles of legendary rulers and proclaimed himself Qin Shi Huang (\u201cFirst Sovereign Emperor\u201d). With unbounded confidence, he claimed that his dynasty would last \u201c10,000 generations.\u201d\n\nAs emperor he initiated a series of reforms aimed at establishing a fully centralized administration, thus avoiding the rise of independent satrapies. Following the example of Qin and at the suggestion of Li Si, he abolished territorial feudal power in the empire, forced the wealthy aristocratic families to live in the capital, Xianyang, and divided the country into 36 military districts, each with its own military and civil administrator. He also issued orders for almost universal standardization\u2014from weights, measures, and the axle lengths of carts to the written language and the laws. Construction of a network of roads and canals was begun, and fortresses erected for defense against barbarian invasions from the north were linked to form the Great Wall.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

While supervising the consolidation and organization of the empire, he did not neglect to perform sacrifices in various sacred places, announcing to the gods that he had finally united the empire, and he erected stone tablets with ritual inscriptions to extol his achievements.\n\nAnother motive for Qin Shi Huang\u2019s travels was his interest in magic and alchemy and his search for masters in these arts who could provide him with the elixir of immortality. After the failure of such an expedition to the islands in the Eastern Sea\u2014possibly Japan\u2014in 219, the emperor repeatedly summoned magicians to his court. Confucian scholars strongly condemned the step as charlatanry, and it is said that 460 of them were executed for their opposition. The continuous controversy between the emperor and Confucian scholars who advocated a return to the old feudal order culminated in the famous burning of the books of 213, when, at Li Si\u2019s suggestion, all books not dealing with agriculture, medicine, or prognostication were burned, except historical records of Qin and books in the imperial library.\n\nThe last years of Qin Shi Huang\u2019s life were dominated by an ever-growing distrust of his entourage\u2014at least three assassination attempts nearly succeeded\u2014and his increasing isolation from the common people. Almost inaccessible in his huge palaces, the emperor led the life of a semidivine being. In 210 Qin Shi Huang died during an inspection tour. He was buried in a gigantic funerary compound hewn out of a mountain and shaped in conformity with the symbolic patterns of the cosmos. (Excavation of this enormous complex of some 20 square miles [50 square km]\u2014now known as the Qin tomb\u2014began in 1974, and the complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987. Among the findings at the site were some 8,000 life-sized terra-cotta soldier and horse figures forming an \u201carmy\u201d for the dead king.) The disappearance of Qin Shi Huang\u2019s forceful personality immediately led to the outbreak of fighting among supporters of the old feudal factions that ended in the collapse of the Qin dynasty and the extermination of the entire imperial clan by 206.\n\nMost of the information about Qin Shi Huang\u2019s life derives from the successor Han dynasty, which prized Confucian scholarship and thus had an interest in disparaging the Qin period. The report that Qin Shi Huang was an illegitimate son of L\u00fc Buwei is possibly an invention of that epoch. Further, stories describing his excessive cruelty and the general defamation of his character must be viewed in the light of the distaste felt by the ultimately victorious Confucians for legalist philosophy in general.\n\nQin Shi Huang certainly had an imposing personality and showed an unbending will in pursuing his aim of uniting and strengthening the empire. His despotic rule and the draconian punishments he meted out were dictated largely by his belief in legalist ideas. With few exceptions, the traditional historiography of imperial China has regarded him as the villain par excellence, inhuman, uncultivated, and superstitious. Modern historians, however, generally stress the endurance of the bureaucratic and administrative structure institutionalized by Qin Shi Huang, which, despite its official denial, remained the basis of all subsequent dynasties in China."}, {"url": "https://iep.utm.edu/zhuangzi-chuang-tzu-chinese-philosopher/", "page_content": "Zhuangzi (Chuang-Tzu, 369\u2014298 B.C.E.)\n\nThe Zhuangzi (also known in Wade-Giles romanization romanization as Chuang-tzu), named after \u201cMaster Zhuang\u201d was, along with the Laozi, one of the earliest texts to contribute to the philosophy that has come to be known as Daojia, or school of the Way. According to traditional dating, Master Zhuang, to whom the first seven chapters of the text have traditionally been attributed, was an almost exact contemporary of the Confucian thinker Mencius, but we have no record of direct philosophical dialogue between them. The text is ranked among the greatest of literary and philosophical masterpieces that China has produced. Its style is complex\u2014mythical, poetic, narrative, humorous, indirect, and polysemic.\n\nMuch of the text espouses a holistic philosophy of life, encouraging disengagement from the artificialities of socialization, and cultivation of our natural \u201cancestral\u201d potencies and skills, in order to live a simple and natural, but full and flourishing life. It is critical of our ordinary categorizations and evaluations, noting the multiplicity of different modes of understanding between different creatures, cultures, and philosophical schools, and the lack of an independent means of making a comparative evaluation. It advocates a mode of understanding that is not committed to a fixed system, but is fluid and flexible, and that maintains a provisional, pragmatic attitude towards the applicability of these categories and evaluations.\n\nThe Zhuangzi text is an anthology, in which several distinctive strands of Daoist thought can be recognized. The Jin dynasty thinker and commentator, Guo Xiang (Kuo Hsiang, d. 312 CE), edited and arranged an early collection, and reduced what had been a work in fifty-two chapters down to thirty-three chapters, excising material that he considered to be repetitious or spurious. The versions of Daoist philosophy expressed in this text were highly influential in the reception, interpretation, and transformation of Buddhist philosophies in China.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Historical Background\n\nAccording to the Han dynasty historian, Sima Qian, Zhuangzi was born during the Warring States (403-221 BCE), more than a century after the death of Confucius. During this time, the ostensibly ruling house of Zhou had lost its authority, and there was increasing violence between states contending for imperial power. This situation gave birth to the phenomenon known as the baijia, the hundred schools: the flourishing of many schools of thought, each articulating its own conception of a return to a state of harmony. The first and most significant of these schools was that of Confucius, who became the chief representative of the Ruists (Confucians), the scholars and propagators of the wisdom and culture of the tradition. Their great rivals were the Mohists, the followers of Mozi (\u201cMaster Mo\u201d), who were critical of what they perceived to be the elitism and extravagance of the traditional culture. The archaeological discovery at Guo Dian in 1993 of an early Laozi manuscript suggests that the philosophical movement associated with the text also began to emerge during this period. The strands of Daoist philosophy expressed in the earliest strata of the Zhuangzi developed within a context infused with the ideas of these three schools. Master Zhuang is usually taken to be the author of the first seven chapters, but in recent years a few scholars have found reason to be skeptical not just of his authorship of any of the text, but also of his very existence.\n\nAccording to early evidence compiled by Sima Qian, Zhuangzi was born in a village called Meng, in the state of Song; according to Lu Deming, the Sui-Tang dynasty scholar, the Pu River in which Zhuangzi was said to have fished was in the state of Chen which, as Wang Guowei points out, had become a territory of the southern state of Chu. We might say that Zhuangzi was situated in the borderlands between Chu, centered around the Yangzi River, and the central plains\u2014which centered around the Yellow River and which were the home of the Shang and Zhou cultures. Some scholars, especially in China, maintain that there is a connection between the philosophies of the Daoist texts and the culture of Chu. The diversity of regions and cultures in early China has increasingly been acknowledged, and most interest has been directed to the state of Chu, in large part because of the wealth of archaeological evidence that is being unearthed there. As one develops a sensitivity for the culture of Chu, one senses deep resonances with the aesthetic sensibility of the Daoists, and with Zhuangzi\u2019s style in particular. The silks and bronzes of Chu, for example, are rich and vibrant; the patterns and images on fabrics and pottery are fanciful and naturalistic. However, while the evidence is persuasive, it is far from decisive.\n\nIf the traditional dating is reliable, then Zhuangzi would have been an almost exact contemporary of the Ruist thinker Mencius, though there is no clear evidence of communication between them. There are a few remarks in the Zhuangzi that could possibly be alluding to Mencius\u2019 philosophy, but there is nothing in the Mencius that shows any interest in Zhuangzi. The philosopher and statesman Hui Shi, or Huizi (\u201cMaster Hui,\u201d 380-305 BCE), is represented as a close friend of Zhuangzi, though decidedly unconvinced by his philosophical musings. There appears to have been a friendly rivalry between the broad and mythic-minded Zhuangzi and the politically motivated Huizi, who is critiqued in the text as a shortsighted paradox-monger. Despite their very deep philosophical distance, and Huizi\u2019s perceived limitations, Zhuangzi expresses great appreciation both for his linguistic abilities and for his friendship. The other \u201clogician,\u201d Gongsun Longzi, would also have been a contemporary of Zhuangzi, and although Zhuangzi does not, unfortunately, engage in any direct philosophical discussion with him, one does find what appears to be an occasional wink in his direction.\n\n2. The Zhuangzi Text\n\nThe currently extant text known as the Zhuangzi is the result of the editing and arrangement of the Jin dynasty thinker and commentator Guo Xiang (Kuo Hsiang, d. 312 CE). He reduced what was then a work in fifty-two chapters to the current edition of thirty-three chapters, excising material that he considered to be spurious. His commentary on the text provides an interpretation that has been one of the most influential over the subsequent centuries.\n\nGuo Xiang\u2019s thirty-three chapter edition of the text is divided into three collections, known as the Inner Chapters (Neipian), the Outer Chapters (Waipian), and the Miscellaneous Chapters (Zapian). The Inner Chapters are the first seven chapters and are generally considered to be the work of Zhuangzi himself. Because the evidence for this attribution is sparse and because of the miscellaneous nature of the editing, some scholars (McCraw, Klein) express skepticism that we can be sure which were the earliest passages or who they were written by. The Outer Chapters are chapters 8 to 22, and the Miscellaneous Chapters are chapters 23 to 33. The Outer and Miscellaneous Chapters can be further subdivided into different strands of Daoist thought. Much modern research has been devoted to a sub-classification of these chapters according to philosophical school. Kuan Feng made some scholarly breakthroughs early in the twentieth century; A. C. Graham continued his classification in the tradition of Kuan Feng. Harold Roth has also taken up a consideration of this issue and come up with some very interesting results. What follows is a simplified version of the results of the research of Liu Xiaogan.\n\nAccording to Liu, chapters 17 to 27 and 32 can be considered to be the work of a school of Zhuangzi\u2019s followers, what he calls the Shu Zhuang Pai, or the \u201cTransmitter\u201d school. Graham, following Kuan Feng, considers chapters 22 to 27 and 32 not to be coherent chapters, but merely random \u201cragbag\u201d collections of fragments. In fact, this miscellaneous character is characteristic of many, if not most, of the rest of the chapters, and complicates any simplistic classification of chapters as a whole. Liu considers chapters 8 to 10, chapters 28 to 31, and the first part of chapter 11 to be from a school of Anarchists whose philosophy is closely related to that of Laozi. Graham, again following Kuan Feng, sees these as two separate but related schools: the first he attributes to a writer he calls the \u201cPrimitivist,\u201d the second he considers to be a school of followers of Yang Zhu. Liu classifies chapters 12 to 16, chapter 33, and the first part of chapter 11 as belonging to the Han dynasty school known as Huang-Lao. Graham refers to them as the Syncretist chapters. Graham finds the classification of chapter 16 to be problematic. Chapter 30 does not seem to have any distinctively Daoist content at all. Though Graham thinks that it is consistent with the Yangist emphasis on preserving life, it is also consistent with Confucian and Mohist critiques of aggression.\n\nIn the following chart the further to the right the chapters are listed, the further away they are from the central ideas of the Zhuangzian philosophy of the Inner Chapters:\n\nThe Inner Chapters School of Zhuang Anarchist Utopianism Huang-Lao Syncretism 1.

Central Concepts in the \u201cInner Chapters\u201d\n\nThe following is an account of the central ideas of Zhuangzian philosophy, going successively through each of the seven Inner Chapters. This discussion is not confined to the content of the particular chapters, but rather represents a fuller articulation of the inter-relationships of the ideas between the Inner Chapters, and also between these ideas and those expressed in the Outer and Miscellaneous Chapters, where these appear to be related. References to \u201cZhuangzi\u201d below should not be taken as referring to a historical person, but rather as shorthand for the overall philosophy as articulated in the text of the Inner Chapters and related passages.\n\na. Chapter 1: Xiao Yao You (Wandering Beyond)\n\nThe title of the first chapter of the Zhuangzi has also been translated as \u201cFree and Easy Wandering\u201d and \u201cGoing Rambling Without a Destination.\u201d Both of these reflect the sense of the Daoist who is in spontaneous accord with the natural world, and who has retreated from the anxieties and dangers of social life, in order to live a healthy and peaceful natural life. In modern Mandarin, the word xiaoyao has thus come to mean \u201cfree, at ease, leisurely, spontaneous.\u201d It conveys the impression of people who have given up the hustle and bustle of worldly existence and have retired to live a leisurely life outside the city, perhaps in the natural setting of the mountains.\n\nBut this everyday expression is lacking a deeper significance that is expressed in the classical Chinese phrase: the sense of distance, or going beyond. As with all Zhuangzi\u2019s images, this is to be understood metaphorically. The second word, \u2018yao,\u2019 means \u2018distance\u2019 or \u2018beyond,\u2019 and here implies going beyond the boundaries of familiarity. We ordinarily confine ourselves within our social roles, expectations, and values, and with our everyday understandings of things. But this, according to Zhuangzi, is inadequate for a deeper appreciation of the natures of things, and for a more successful mode of interacting with them. We need at the very least to undo preconceptions that prevent us from seeing things and events in new ways; we need to see how we can structure and restructure the boundaries of things. But we can only do so when we ourselves have \u2018wandered beyond\u2019 the boundaries of the familiar. It is only by freeing our imaginations to reconceive ourselves, and our worlds, and the things with which we interact, that we may begin to understand the deeper tendencies of the natural transformations by which we are all affected, and of which we are all constituted. By loosening the bonds of our fixed preconceptions, we bring ourselves closer to an attunement to the potent and productive natural way (dao) of things.\n\nPaying close attention to the textual associations, we see that wandering is associated with the word wu, ordinarily translated \u2018nothing,\u2019 or \u2018without.\u2019 Related associations include: wuyou (no \u2018something\u2019) and wuwei (no interference). Roger Ames and David Hall have commented extensively on these wu expressions. Most importantly, they are not to be understood as simple negations, but have a much more complex function. The significance of all of these expressions must be traced back to the wu of Laozi: a type of negation that does not simply negate, but places us in a new kind of relation to \u2018things\u2019\u2014a phenomenological waiting that allows them to manifest, one that acknowledges the space that is the possibility of their coming to presence, one that appreciates the emptiness that is the condition of the possibility of their capacity to function, to be useful (as the hollow inside a house makes it useful for living). The behavior of one who wanders beyond becomes wuwei: sensitive and responsive without fixed preconceptions, without artifice, responding spontaneously in accordance with the unfolding of the inter-developing factors of the environment of which one is an inseparable part.\n\nBut it is not just the crossing of horizontal boundaries that is at stake. There is also the vertical distance that is important: one rises to a height from which formerly important distinctions lose what appeared to be their crucial significance. Thus arises the distinction between the great and the small, or the Vast (da) and the petty (xiao). Of this distinction Zhuangzi says that the petty cannot come up to the Vast: petty understanding that remains confined and defined by its limitations cannot match Vast understanding, the expansive understanding that wanders beyond. Now, while it is true that the Vast loses sight of distinctions noticed by the petty, it does not follow that they are thereby equalized, as Guo Xiang suggests. For the Vast still embraces the petty in virtue of its very vastness. The petty, precisely in virtue of its smallness, is not able to reciprocate.\n\nNow, the Vast that goes beyond our everyday distinctions also thereby appears to be useless. A soaring imagination may be wild and wonderful, but it is extremely impractical and often altogether useless. Indeed, Huizi, Zhuangzi\u2019s friend and philosophical foil, chides him for this very reason. But Zhuangzi expresses disappointment in him: for his inability to sense the use of this kind of uselessness is a kind of blindness of the spirit. The useless has use, only not as seen on the ordinary level of practical affairs. It has a use in the cultivation and nurturing of the \u2018shen\u2018 (spirit), in protecting the ancestral and preserving one\u2019s life, so that one can last out one\u2019s natural years and live a flourishing life. Now, this notion of a flourishing life is not to be confused with a \u2018successful\u2019 life: Zhuangzi is not impressed by worldly success. A flourishing life may indeed look quite unappealing from a traditional point of view. One may give up social ambition and retire in relative poverty to tend to one\u2019s shen and cultivate one\u2019s xing (nature, or life potency).\n\nTo summarize: When we wander beyond, we leave behind everything we find familiar, and explore the world in all its unfamiliarity. We drop the tools that we have been taught to use to tame the environment, and we allow it to teach us without words. We imitate its spontaneous behavior and we learn to respond immediately without fixed articulations.\n\nb. Chapter 2: Qi Wu Lun (Discussion on Smoothing Things Out)\n\nIf the Inner Chapters form the core of the Zhuangzi collection, then the Qi Wu Lun may be thought of as forming the core of the Inner Chapters. It is, at any rate, the most complex and intricate of the chapters of the Zhuangzi, with allusions and allegories, highly condensed arguments, and baffling metaphors juxtaposed without explanation. It appears to be concerned with the deepest and most \u2018abstract\u2019 understanding of ourselves, our lives, our world, our language, and indeed of our understanding itself. The most perplexing sections concern language and judgment, and are filled with paradox, sometimes even contradiction. But the contradictions are not easy to dismiss: their context indicates that they have a deep significance. In part, they appear to attempt to express an understanding about the limits of understanding itself, about the limits of language and thought.\n\nThis creates a problem for the interpreter, and especially for the translator. How do we deal with the contradictions? The most common solution is to paraphrase them so as to remove the direct contradictoriness, under the presupposition that no sense can be made of a contradiction. The most common way to remove the contradictions is to insert references to points of view. Those translators, such as A. C. Graham, who do this are following the interpretation of the Jin dynasty commentator Guo Xiang, who presents the philosophy as a form of relativism: apparently opposing judgments can harmonized when it is recognized that they are made from different perspectives.\n\nAccording to Guo Xiang\u2019s interpretation, each thing has its own place, its own nature (ziran); and each thing has its own value that follows from its own nature. If so, then nothing should be judged by values appropriate to the natures of other things. According to Guo Xiang, the vast and the small are equal in significance: this is his interpretation of the word \u201cqi\u201d in the title, \u201cequalization of all viewpoints\u201d. Now, such a radical relativism may have the goal of issuing a fundamental challenge to the status quo, arguing that the established values have no more validity than any of the minority values, no matter how shocking they may seem to us. In this way, its effect would be one of destabilization of the social structure. Here, however, we see another of the possible consequences of such a position: its inherent conservativeness. Guo Xiang\u2019s purpose in asserting this radical uniqueness and necessity of each position is conservative in this way. Indeed, it appears to be articulated precisely in response to those who oppose the traditional Ruist values of humanity and rightness (ren and yi) by claiming to have a superior mystical ground from which to judge them to be lacking. Guo Xiang\u2019s aim in asserting the equality of every thing, every position, and every function, is to encourage each thing, and each person, to accept its own place in the hierarchical system, to acknowledge its value in the functioning of the whole. In this way, radical relativism actually forestalls the possibility of radical critique altogether!\n\nAccording to this reading, the Vast perspective of the giant Peng bird is no better than the petty perspectives of the little birds who laugh at it. And indeed, Guo Xiang, draws precisely this conclusion. But there is a problem with taking this reading too seriously, and it is the kind of problem that plagues all forms of radical relativism when one attempts to follow them through consistently. Simply put, Zhuangzi would have to acknowledge that his own position is no better than those he appears to critique. He would have to acknowledge that his Daoist philosophy, indeed even this articulation of relativism, is no improvement over Confucianism after all, and that it is no less short-sighted than the logic-chopping of the Mohists. This, however, is a consequence that Zhuangzi does not recognize. This is surely an indication that the radical relativistic interpretation is clearly a misreading.\n\nRecently, some western interpreters (Lisa Raphals and Paul Kjellberg, for example) have focused their attention on aspects of the text that express affinities with the Hellenistic philosophy of Skepticism. Now, it is important not to confuse this with what in modern philosophy is thought of as a doctrine of skepticism, the most common form of which is the claim that we cannot ever claim to know anything, for at least the reason that we might always be wrong about anything we claim to know\u2014that is, because we can never know anything with absolute certainty. This is not quite the claim of the ancient Skeptics. Arguing from a position of fallibilism, these latter feel that we ought never to make any final judgments that go beyond the immediate evidence, or the immediate appearances. We should simply accept what appears at face value and have no further beliefs about its ultimate consequences, or its ultimate value. In particular, we should refrain from making judgments about whether it is good or bad for us. We bracket (epoche) these ultimate judgments. When we see that such things are beyond our ability to know with certainty, we will learn to let go of our anxieties and accept the things that happen to us with equanimity. Such a state of emotional tranquility they call \u2018ataraxia.\u2019\n\nNow, the resonances with Zhuangzi\u2019s philosophy are clear. Zhuangzi also accepts a form of fallibilism. While he does not refrain from making judgments, he nevertheless acknowledges that we cannot be certain that what we think of as good for us may not ultimately be bad for us, or that what we now think of as something terrible to be feared (death, for example) might not be an extraordinarily blissful awakening and a release from the toils and miseries of worldly life. When we accept this, we refrain from dividing things into the acceptable and the unacceptable; we learn to accept the changes of things in all their aspects with equanimity. In the Skeptical reading, the textual contradictions are also resolved by appealing to different perspectives from which different judgments appear to be true. Once one has learnt how to shift easily between the perspectives from which such different judgments can be made, then one can see how such apparently contradictory things can be true at the same time\u2014and one no longer feels compelled to choose between them.\n\nThere is, however, another way to resolve these contradictions, one that involves recognizing the importance of continuous transformation between contrasting phenomena and even between opposites. In the tradition of Laozi\u2019s cosmology, Zhuangzi\u2019s worldview is also one of seasonal transformations of opposites. The world is seen as a giant clod (da kuai) around which the heavens (tian) revolve about a polar axis (daoshu). All transformations have such an axis, and the aim of the sage is to settle into this axis, so that one may observe the changes without being buffeted around by them.\n\nNow, the theme of opposites is taken up by the Mohists, in their later Mohist Canon, but with a very different understanding. The later Mohists present a detailed analysis of judgments as requiring bivalence: that is judgments may be acceptable (ke) (also, \u2018affirmed\u2019 shi) or unacceptable (buke) (also \u2018rejected\u2019fei); they must be one or the other and they cannot be both. There must always be a clear distinction between the two. It is to this claim, I believe, that Zhuangzi is directly responding. Rejecting also the Mohist style of discussion, he appeals to an allusive, aphoristic, mythological style of poetic writing to upset the distinctions and blur the boundaries that the Mohists insist must be held apart. The Mohists believe that social harmony can only be achieved when we have clarity of distinctions, especially of evaluative distinctions: true/false, good/bad, beneficial/harmful. Zhuangzi\u2019s position is that this kind of sharp and rigid thinking can result ultimately only in harming our natural tendencies (xing), which are themselves neither sharp nor rigid. If we, on the contrary, learn to nurture those aspects of our heart-minds (xin), our natural tendencies (xing), that are in tune with the natural (tian) and ancestral (zong) within us, then we will eventually find our place at the axis of the way (daoshu) and will be able to ride the transformations of the cosmos free from harm. That is, we will be able to sense and respond to what can only be vaguely expressed without forcing it into gross and unwieldy verbal expressions. We are then able to recognize the paradoxes of vagueness and indeterminacy that arise from infinitesimal processes of transformation.\n\nPut another way, our knowledge and understanding (zhi, tong, da) are not just what we can explicitly see before us and verbalize: in modern terms, they are not just what is \u2018consciously,\u2019 \u2018conceptually,\u2019 or \u2018linguistically\u2019 available to us. Zhuangzi also insists on a level of understanding that goes beyond such relatively crude modes of dividing up our world and experiences. There are hidden modes of knowing, not evident or obviously present, modes that allow us to live, breathe, move, understand, connect with others without words, read our environments through subtle signs; these modes of knowing also give us tremendous skill in coping with others and with our environments. These modes of knowing Zhuangzi calls \u201cwuzhi\u201d, literally \u2018without knowing,\u2019 or \u2018unknowing\u2019. What is known by such modes of knowing, when we attempt to express it in words, becomes paradoxical and appears contradictory. It seems that bivalent distinctions leave out too much on either side of the divide: they are too crude a tool to cope with the subtlety and complexity of our non-conceptual modes of knowing. Zhuangzi, following a traditional folk psychology of his time, calls this capacity shenming: \u201cspirit insight.\u201d\n\nWhen we nurture that deepest and most natural, most ancestral part of our pysches, through psycho-physical meditative practices, we at the same time nurture these non-cognitive modes of understanding, embodied wisdoms, that enable us to deal successfully with our circumstances. It is then that we are able to cope directly with what from the limited perspective of our \u2018socialized\u2019 and \u2018linguistic\u2019 understanding seems to be too vague, too open, too paradoxical.\n\nc. Chapter 3: Yang Sheng Zhu (The Principle of Nurturing Life)\n\nThis chapter, like the Anarchist Utopian chapters, deals with the way to nurture and cultivate one\u2019s \u2018life tendencies\u2019 (sheng, xing) so as to enable one to live skillfully and last out one\u2019s natural years (zhong qi tian nian). There is a \u2018potency\u2019 within oneself that is a source of longevity, an ancestral place from which the phenomena of one\u2019s life continue to arise. This place is to be protected (bao), kept whole (quan), nurtured and cultivated (yang). The result is a sagely and skillful life. We must be careful how we understand this word, \u2018skill.\u2019 Zhuangzi takes pains to point out that it is no mere technique. A technique is a procedure that may be mastered, but the skill of the sage goes beyond this. One might say that it has become an \u2018art,\u2019 a dao. With Zhuangzi\u2019s conception, any physical activity, whether butchering a carcass, making wooden wheels, or carving beautiful ceremonial bell stands, becomes a dao when it is performed in a spiritual state of heightened awareness (\u2018attenuation\u2019 xu).\n\nZhuangzi sees civic involvement as particularly inimical to the preservation and cultivation of one\u2019s natural life. In order to cultivate one\u2019s natural potencies, one must retreat from social life, or at least one must retreat from the highly complex and artificially structured social life of the city. One undergoes a psycho-physical training in which one\u2019s sensory and physical capacities become honed to an extraordinary degree, indicating one\u2019s attunement with the transformations of nature, and thus highly responsive to the tendencies (xing) of all things, people, and processes. The mastery achieved is demonstrated (both metaphorically, and literally) by practical embodied skill. That is, practical embodied skill is also a metaphor representing the mastery of the life of the sage, and so it is also a sign of sagehood (though not all those who are skillful are to be reckoned as sages). Thus, we see many examples of individuals who have achieved extraordinary levels of excellence in their achievements\u2014practical, aesthetic, and spiritual. Butcher Ding provides an example of a practical, and very lowly skill; Liezi\u2019s teacher, Huzi, in chapter 7, provides an example of skill in controlling the very forces responsible for life themselves. Chapter 19, Mastering Life, is replete with examples: a cicada catcher, a ferryman, a carpenter, a swimmer, and Woodcarver Qing, whose aesthetic skill reaches \u2018magical\u2019 heights.\n\nd. Chapter 4: Ren Jian Shi (The Realm of Human Interactions)\n\nIn this chapter, Zhuangzi continues the theme broached in the last chapter, but now takes on the problem of how to maintain and preserve one\u2019s life and last out one\u2019s years while living in the social realm, especially in circumstances of great danger: a life of civic engagement in a time of social corruption.\n\nThe Daoists, especially the authors of the anarchistic utopian chapters, are highly critical of the artificiality required to create and sustain complex social structures. The Daoists are skeptical of the ability of deliberate planning to deal with the complexities of the world within which our social structures have their place. Even the developments of the social world when left to themselves are \u2018natural\u2019 developments, and as such escape the confines of planned, structured thinking. The more we try to control and curtail these natural meanderings, the more complicated and unwieldy the social structures become. According to the Daoists, no matter how complex we make our structures, they will never be fully able to cope with the fluid flexibility of natural changes. The Daoists perceive the unfolding of the transformations of nature as exhibiting a kind of natural intelligence, a wisdom that cannot be matched by deliberate artificial thinking, thinking that can be articulated in words. The result is that phenomena guided by such artificial structures quickly lose their course, and have to be constantly regulated, re-calibrated. This need gives rise to the development and articulation of the artificial concepts of ren and yi for the Ruists, and shi and fei for the Mohists.\n\nThe Ruists emphasize the importance of cultivating the values of ren \u2018humanity\u2019 and yi \u2018appropriateness/rightness.\u2019 The Mohists identify a bivalent structure of preference and evaluation, shifei. Our judgments can be positive or negative, and these arise out of our acceptance and rejection of things or of judgments, and these in turn arise out of our emotional responses to the phenomena of benefit and harm, that is, pleasure and pain. Thus, we set up one of two types of systems: the intuitive renyi morality of the Ruists, or the articulated structured shifei of the Mohists.\n\nZhuangzi sees both of these as dangerous. Neither can keep up with the complex transformations of things and so both will result in harm to our shen and xing. They lead to the desire of rulers to increase their personal profit, their pleasure, and their power, and to do so at the expense of others. The best thing is to steer clear of such situations. But there are times when one cannot do so: there is nothing one can do to avoid involvement in a social undertaking. There are also times\u2014if one has a Ruist sensibility\u2014when one will be moved to do what one can and must in order to improve the social situation. Zhuangzi makes up a story about Confucius\u2019 most beloved and most virtuous follower, Yen Hui, who feels called to help \u2018rectify\u2019 the King of a state known for his selfishness and brutality.\n\nZhuangzi thinks that such a motivation, while admirable, is ultimately misguided. There is little to nothing one can do to change things in a corrupt world. But if you really have to try, then you should be aware of the dangers, be aware of the natures of things, and of how they transform and develop. Be on the lookout for the \u2018triggers\u2019: the critical junctures at which a situation can explode out of hand. In the presence of danger, do not confront it: always dance to one side, redirect it through skilled and subtle manipulations, that do not take control, but by adding their own weight appropriately, redirect the momentum of the situation. One must treat all dangerous social undertakings as a Daoist adept: one must perform xinzhai, fasting of the heart-mind. This is a psycho-physical discipline of attenuation, in which one nurtures one\u2019s inner potencies by thinning out one\u2019s personal preferences and keeping one\u2019s emotions in check, so that one may achieve a heightened sensitivity to the tendencies of things. One then responds with the skill of a sage to the dangerous moods and intentions of one\u2019s worldly ruler.\n\ne. Chapter 5: De Chong Fu (Signs of the Flourishing of Potency)\n\nThis chapter is populated with a collection of characters with bodily eccentricities: criminals with amputated feet, people born with \u2018ugly\u2019 deformities, hunchbacks with no lips. Perhaps some of these are moralistic advisors, like those of chapter 4, who were unsuccessful in bringing virtue and harmony to a corrupt state, and instead received the harsh punishment of their offended ruler. But it is also possible that some were born with these physical \u2018deformities.\u2019 As the Commander of the Right says in chapter 3, \u201cWhen tian (nature) gave me life, it saw to it that I would be one footed.\u201d These then are people whose natural capacity (de) has been twisted somehow, redirected, so that it gives them a potency (de) that is beyond the normal human range. At any rate, this out of the ordinary appearance, this extraordinary physical form, is a sign of something deeper: a potency and a power (de) that connects them more closely to the ancestral source. These are the sages that Zhuangzi admires: those whose virtue (de) is beyond the ordinary, and whose signs of virtue indicate that they have gone beyond.\n\nBut what goes beyond is also the source of life. To hold fast to that which is beyond both living and dying, is perhaps also to hold fast to something more primordial that is beyond human and inhuman. To identify with and nurture this source is to nurture that which is at the root of our humanity. If so, then one does not necessarily become inhuman. Indeed, one might argue that this creates the possibility of deepening one\u2019s most genuine humanity, insofar as this is a deeper nature still.\n\nf. Chapter 6: Da Zong Shi (The Vast Ancestral Teacher)\n\nThe first part of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of the zhenren: the \u201cgenuine person,\u201d or \u201cgenuine humanity,\u201d (or in older translations, \u201cTrue Man\u201d). It begins by asking about the relation between tian and ren, the natural/heaven and the human, and suggests that the greatest wisdom lies in the ability to understand both. Thus, to be forced to choose between being natural or being human is a mistake. A genuinely flourishing human life cannot be separated from the natural, but nor can it on that account deny its own humanity. Genuine humanity is natural humanity.\n\nThere are several sections devoted to explicating this genuine humanity. We find that the genuinely human person, the zhen ren, is in tune with the cycles of nature, and is not upset by the vicissitudes of life. The zhenren like Laozi\u2019s sage is somehow simultaneously unified with things, and yet not tied down by them. The zhenren is in tune with the cycles of nature, and with the cycles of yin yang, and is not disturbed or harmed by them. In fact, the zhenren is not harmed by them either in what appears to us to be their negative phases, nor are their most extreme phases able to upset the balance of the zhenren. This is sometimes expressed with what I take to be the hyperbole that the sage or zhenren can never be drowned by the ocean, nor burned by fire.\n\nIn the second part of the chapter, Zhuangzi hints at the process by which we are to cultivate our genuine and natural humanity. These are meditative practices and psycho-physical disciplines\u2014\u201dyogas\u201d perhaps\u2014by which we learn how to nourish the ancestral root of life that is within us. We learn how to identify with that center which functions as an axis of stability around which the cycles of emotional turbulence flow. By maintaining ourselves as a shifting and responding center of gravity we are able to maintain an equanimity without giving up our feelings altogether. We enjoy riding the dragon without being thrown around by it. Ordinarily, we are buffeted around like flotsam in a storm, and yet, by holding fast to our ancestral nature, and by following the nature of the environment\u2014by \u201cmatching nature with nature\u201d\u2014we free ourselves from the mercy of random circumstances.\n\nIn this chapter we see a mature development of the ideas of life and death broached in the first three chapters. Zhuangzi continues musing on the significance of our existential predicament as being inextricably tied into interweaving cycles of darkness and light, sadness and joy, living and dying. In chapter two, it was the predicament itself that Zhuangzi described, and he tried to focus on the inseparability and indistinguishability of the two aspects of this single process of transformation. In this chapter, Zhuangzi tries to delve deeper to reach the center of balance, the \u2018axis of the way,\u2019 that allows one to undergo these changes with tranquility, and even to accept them with a kind of \u2018joy.\u2019 Not an ecstatic affirmation, to be sure, but a tranquil appreciation of the richness, beauty, and \u201cinevitability\u201d of whatever experiences we eventually will undergo. Again, not that we must experience whatever is \u2018fated\u2019 for us, or that we ought not to minimize harm and suffering where we can do so, but only that we should acknowledge and accept our situatedness, our thrownness into our situation, as the \u2018raw materials\u2019 that we have to deal with.\n\nThere are mystical practices hinted at that enable the sage to identify with the datong, the greater flow, not with the particular arisings of these particular emotions, or this particular body, but with what lies within (and below and above) as their ancestral root. These meditative and yogic practices are hinted at in this chapter, and also in chapter 7, but nothing in the text reveals what they are. It is not unreasonable to believe that similar techniques have been handed down by the practitioners of religious Daoism. It is clear, nonetheless, that part of the change is a change in self-understanding, self-identification. We somehow learn to expand, to wander beyond, our boundaries until they include the entire cosmic process. This entire process is seen as like a potter\u2019s wheel, and simultaneously as a whetstone and as a grindstone, on which things are formed, and arise, sharpened, and are ground back down only to be made into new forms. With each \u2018birth\u2019 (sheng) some \u2018thing\u2019 (wu) new arises, flourishes, develops through its natural (tian) tendencies (xing), and then still following its natural tendencies, responding to those of its natural environment, it winds down: enters (ru) back into the undifferentiated (wu) from which it emerged (chu). The truest friendship arises when members of a community identify with this unknown undifferentiated process in which they are embedded, \u201cforgotten\u201d differences between self and other, and spontaneously follows the natural developments of which they are inseparable \u201cparts.\u201d\n\ng. Chapter 7: Ying Di Wang (Responding to Emperors and Kings)\n\nThe last of the Inner Chapters does not introduce anything new, but closes by returning to a recurring theme from chapters 1, 3, 5, and 6: that of withdrawing from society. This \u2018withdrawal\u2019 has two functions: the first is to preserve one\u2019s \u2018life\u2019; the second is to allow society to function naturally, and thus to bring itself to a harmonious completion. Rather than interfering with social interactions, one should allow them to follow their natural course, which, Zhuangzi believes, will be both imaginative and harmonious.\n\nThese themes resonate with those of the Anarchist chapters in the Outer (and Miscellaneous) chapters: 8 to 11a and 28 to 32. These encourage a life closer to nature in which one lets go of deliberate control and instead learns how to sense the tendencies of things, allowing them to manifest and flourish, while also adding one\u2019s weight to redirect their momentum away from harm and danger. Or, if harm and danger are unavoidable, then one learns how to minimize them, and how to accept whatever one does have to suffer with equanimity.\n\n4. Key Interpreters of Zhuangzi\n\nThe earliest of the interpreters of Zhuangzi\u2019s philosophy are of course his followers, whose commentaries and interpretations have been preserved in the text itself, in the chapters that Liu Xiaogan ascribes to the \u201cShu Zhuang Pai,\u201d chapters 17 to 27. Most of these chapters constitute holistic developments of the ideas of the Inner Chapters, but some of them concentrate on particular issues raised in particular chapters. For example, the author of Chapter 17, the Autumn Floods, elaborates on the philosophy of perspective and overcoming boundaries that is discussed in the first chapter, Xiao Yao You. This chapter develops the ideas in several divergent directions: relativism, skepticism, pragmatism, and even a kind of absolutism. Which of these, if any, is the overall philosophical perspective is not easy to discern. The author of chapter 19, Da Sheng, Mastering Life, takes up the theme of the cultivation of the wisdom of embodied skill that is introduced in chapter 3, Yang Sheng Zhu, The Principle of Nurturing Life. The author of chapter 18, Zhi Le, Utmost Happiness, and chapter 22, Zhi Bei You, Knowledge Wanders North, continues the meditations on life and death, and the cultivation of meditative practice, that are explored in chapter 6, Da Zong Shi, The Vast Ancestral Teacher.\n\nThe next group of interpreters have also become incorporated into the extant version of the text. They are the school of philosophers inclined towards anarchist utopias, that Graham identifies as a \u201cPrimitivist\u201d and a school of \u201cYangists,\u201d chapters 8 to 11, and 28 to 31. These thinkers appear to have been profoundly influenced by the Laozi, and also by the thought of the first and last of the Inner Chapters: \u201cWandering Beyond,\u201d and \u201cResponding to Emperors and Kings.\u201d There are also possible signs of influence from Yang Zhu, whose concern was to protect and cultivate one\u2019s inner life-source. These chapters combine the anarchistic ideals of a simple life close to nature that can be found in the Laozi with the practices that lead to the cultivation and nurturing of life. The practice of the nurturing of life in chapter 3, that leads to the \u201clasting out of one\u2019s natural years,\u201d becomes an emphasis on maintaining and protecting xing ming zhi qing \u201cthe essentials of nature and life\u2019s command\u201d in these later chapters.\n\nThe third main group, whose interpretation has been preserved in the text itself, is the Syncretist school, an eclectic school whose aim to is promote an ideal of mystical rulership, influenced by the major philosophical schools of the time, especially those that recommend a cultivation of inner potency. They may or may not be exemplary of the so-called \u2018Huang-Lao\u2019 school. They scoured the earlier philosophers in order to extract what was valuable in their philosophies, the element of the dao that is to be found in each philosophical claim. In particular, they sought to combine the more \u2018mystically\u2019 inclined philosophies with the more practical ones to create a more complete dao. The last chapter, Tian Xia, The World, considers several philosophical schools, and comments on what is worthwhile in each of them. Zhuangzi\u2019s philosophy is here characterized as \u201cvast,\u201d \u201cvague,\u201d \u201coutrageous,\u201d \u201cextravagant,\u201d and \u201creckless\u201d; he is also recognized for his encompassing modes of thought, his lack of partisanship, and his recklessness is acknowledged to be harmless. Nevertheless, it is stated that he did not succeed in getting it all.\n\nPerhaps the most important of the pre-Qin thinkers to comment on Zhuangzi is Xunzi. In his \u201cDispelling Obsessions\u201d chapter, anticipating the eclecticism of the Huang-Lao commentators of chapter 33, he considers several philosophical schools, mentions the corner of \u2018truth\u2019 that each has recognized, and then goes on to criticize them for failing to understand the larger picture. Xunzi mentions Zhuangzi by name, describes him as a philosopher who recognizes the value of nature and of following the tendencies of nature, but who thereby fails to recognize the value of the human \u2018ren\u2019. Indeed, Zhuangzi seems to be aware of this kind of objection, and even delights in it. He revels in knowing that he is one who wanders off into the distance, far from human concerns, one who is not bound by the guidelines. Perhaps in doing so he corroborates Xunzi\u2019s fears.\n\nAnother text that reveals what might be a development of Zhuangzi\u2019s philosophy is the Liezi. This is a philosophical treatise that clearly stands in the same tradition as the Zhuangzi, dealing with many of the same issues, and on occasion with almost identical stories and discussions. Although the Daoist adept, Liezi, to whom the text is attributed is said to have lived before Zhuangzi, the text clearly dates from a later period, perhaps compiled as late as the Eastern Han, though in terms of linguistic style the material appears to date from around the same period as Zhuangzi. The Liezi continues the line of philosophical thinking of the Xiao Yao You, and the Qiu Shui, taking up the themes of transcending boundaries, and even cosmic realms, by spirit journeying. The leaving behind and overturning of human values is a theme that is repeated in this text, though again not without a certain paradoxical tension: after all, the purpose of such journeying and overturning of values is ultimately to enable us in some sense to live \u2018better\u2019 lives. While Zhuangzi\u2019s own philosophy exerted a significant influence on the interpretation of Buddhism in China, theLiezi appears to provide a possible converse case of Mahayana Buddhist influence on the development of the ideas of Zhuangzi.\n\nThe Jin dynasty scholar, Guo Xiang, is one of the most influential of the early interpreters. His \u201crelativistic\u201d reading of the text has become the received interpretation, and his own distinctive style of philosophical thinking has in this way become almost inseparable from that of Zhuangzi. The task of interpreting Zhuangzi independently of Guo Xiang\u2019s reading is not easy to accomplish. His contribution and interpretation have already been discussed in the body of the entry (See sections above: The Zhuangzitext, and Chapter 2: Qi Wu Lun (Discussion on Smoothing Things Out) ). The Sui dynasty scholar, Lu Deming, produced an invaluable glossary and philological commentary on the text, enabling later generations to benefit from his vast linguistic expertise. The Ming dynasty Buddhist poet and scholar, Han Shan, wrote a commentary on the Zhuangzi from a Chan Buddhist perspective. In a similar vein, the Qing dynasty scholar, Zhang Taiyan, constructed a masterful interpretation of the Zhuangzi in the light of Chinese Buddhist Idealism, or Weishilun. Guo Qingfan, a late Qing, early twentieth century scholar, collected and synthesized the work of previous generations of commentators. The scholarly work of Takeushi Yoshio in Japan has also been of considerable influence. Qian Mu is a twentieth century scholar who has exerted considerable efforts with regard to historical scholarship. Currently, in Taiwan, Chen Guying is the leading scholar and interpreter of Zhuangzi, and he uses his knowledge of western philosophy, particularly western epistemology, cosmology, and metaphysics, to throw new light on this ancient text.\n\nIn the west, probably the most important and influential scholar was A. C. Graham, whose pioneering work on this text, and on the later Mohist Canon, has laid the groundwork and set an extraordinarily high standard for future western philosophical scholarship. Graham, following the reading of Guo Xiang, develops a relativistic reading based on a theory of the conventional nature of language. Chad Hansen is a current interpreter who sees the Daoists as largely theorists of language, and he interprets Zhuangzi\u2019s own contribution as a form of \u201clinguistic skepticism.\u201d Recently, there has been a growth of interest in the aspects of Zhuangzi\u2019s philosophy that resonate with the Hellenistic school of Skepticism. This was proposed by Paul Kjellberg, and has been pursued by other scholars such as Lisa Raphals.\n\n5. References and Further Reading\n\nAmes, Roger, ed. Wandering at Ease in the Zhuangzi.

Both textual and material evidence can be interpreted in different ways: hence, whereas some scholars insist that Chu was the cultural Other of the Zhou \u5468 world, other consider it an intrinsic part of the Zhou civilization. To complicate matters more, most of the Chu-related narratives in the transmitted texts were created in the northern part of the Zhou world, and are suspected to reflect \u201cnorthern biases,\u201dFootnote 1 which means that their reliability with regard to the self-image of Chu elites is doubtful.\n\nIt is on this backdrop that we can appreciate the importance of historical and quasi-historical manuscripts recently excavated (or looted) from the Chu tombs. By offering a Chu perspective of its history, they allow us to think anew about Chu's cultural trajectory. In what follows, after a brief outline of the debates over Chu's cultural belonging, I shall survey the newly discovered manuscripts and evaluate their impact on the ongoing research concerning Chu identity.\n\nPREFACE: THE QUESTION OF CHU'S OTHERNESS Traditional scholars were overwhelmingly inclined to view Chu as the cultural Other of the Zhou world. The reasons for this verdict are not difficult to find. Already some of the Western Zhou \u897f\u5468 (ca. 1046\u2013771 BCE) sources indicate considerable enmity between the Zhou realm and the state of Chu. The most notable manifestation of this enmity were campaigns of King Zhao of Zhou \u5468\u662d\u738b (r. 975\u2013957 BCE) against Chu in ca. 960\u2013957 BCE. The latter of these campaigns ended in the disastrous loss of royal armies; and the king himself perished. The memory of this humiliation lived for centuries.Footnote 2 Tensions between Zhou and Chu continued into the reign of King Xuan of Zhou \u5468\u5ba3\u738b (r. 828\u2013781 BCE). The ode \u201cPlucking White Millet\u201d (Cai qi \u91c7\u8291) in the Canon of Poems (Shijing \u8a69\u7d93) hails a minister of King Xuan who allegedly invaded and overawed the \u201cSavage Jing\u201d (man Jing \u883b\u834a). Whether or not this term refers to the state of Chu (which often appears under the name Jing or Jing-Chu in early sources) or to other tribesmen of the Han \u6f22 and middle Yangzi basin is debatable,Footnote 3 but elsewhere the Canon of Poems seems to unmistakably signify the state of Chu as a major enemy. Two of the Lu \u9b6f and Shang \u5546 (probably Song \u5b8b) hymns contain references to battles with the Jing-Chu, which, in a Lu hymn, is placed unequivocally aside the alien tribesmen Rong and Di \u620e\u72c4.Footnote 4 These hymns probably date from the Springs-and-Autumns period (Chunqiu \u6625\u79cb, 770-453 BCE), yet they do indicate that the tradition of political cum cultural enmity toward Chu that started in the Western Zhou period continued and perhaps strengthened thereafter. Zuo zhuan \u5de6\u50b3 (Zuo Tradition), our major source for the history of the Springs-and-Autumns period, records the rise of Chu and its epic struggle for supremacy in the Zhou world against the northern coalitions, led first by Qi \u9f4a and then by Jin \u6649. A superficial reading of Zuo zhuan will lend support to identification of Chu as a culturally distinct entity. A Lu minister's saying, \u201cThey are not of our kin, their heart must be different\u201d (\u975e\u6211\u65cf\u985e\uff0c\u5176\u5fc3\u5fc5\u7570), is commonly\u2014albeit erroneously\u2014interpreted as pertaining to Chu's \u201cracial\u201d otherness.Footnote 5 This interpretation is wrong, but Zuo zhuan does contain many other negative comments on Chu, which is perceived as a rival of the Xia \u590f entity centered around the Zhou royal clan. Thus, a Jin commander accuses Chu of eliminating many polities established by the Zhou royal clansmen (the Ji \u59ec clan);Footnote 6 and many of Chu leaders, from its prime-minister (lingyin \u4ee4\u5c39) Ziyu \u5b50\u7389 (d. 632 BCE) to infamous King Ling \u695a\u9748\u738b (r. 540\u2013529 BCE) are singled out as arrogant and aggressive statesmen eager to violate rules of ritual and propriety. All this often leaves an impression of the text's overall enmity toward Chu. A careful reading of Zuo zhuan shows that the picture is more complex. Chu is never treated in the text as the cultural Other: in distinction from other southern powers, such as Wu \u5433 and Yue \u8d8a, Chu are never called manyi \u883b\u5937 (\u201csavages\u201d). Some Chu leaders are denigrated indeed, but others\u2014most notably King Zhuang \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 613\u2013591 BCE)\u2014are given high respect. Moreover, some of the pejorative remarks about Chu in Zuo zhuan should be read cum grano salis. After all, the very state of Lu, whose statesman opposed relying on Chu who \u201care not of our kin,\u201d was at times closely allied with Chu, seeking its military assistance against the neighboring power of Qi. And the elimination of Zhou clansmen's polities was performed not just by Chu but also by the self-proclaimed defender of the Zhou, the state of Jin.Footnote 7 Actually, some of the imperial readers considered Zuo zhuan too biased in favor of Chu; and some of the exegetes\u2014most notably Zhu Xi \u6731\u71b9 (1130\u20131200)\u2014opined that Zuo zhuan itself was a product of Chu historiography.Footnote 8 Going further in history, in many of the Warring States\u2013period (Zhanguo \u6230\u570b, 453\u2013221 BCE) texts we encounter ever more pronounced enmity toward Chu. In particular, its association with \u201cbarbarians\u201d becomes a commonplace. This association is reiterated throughout the Discourses of the States (Guoyu \u570b\u8a9e),Footnote 9 even though the overall view of Chu in this text is far from negative, and parts of it contain laudatory comments on Chu (see below). A pejorative view of Chu is more explicit in Gongyang zhuan \u516c\u7f8a\u50b3, a rival (to Zuo zhuan) commentary on the Springs-and-Autumns Annals (Chunqiu \u6625\u79cb). Chu is consistently identified in the text as a \u201cbarbarian\u201d (yi \u5937 or yidi \u5937\u72c4) state; it is oddly claimed to have no ranked nobles (which is patently wrong, judging from the Annals\u2019 text itself), and it is frequently treated with undisguised enmity.Footnote 10 One of the Gongyang zhuan statements is particularly important because of its lasting influence on subsequent views of Chu: Chu is the last to submit when there is a True Monarch, and the first to rebel when there is none. They are barbarians (yidi) and immensely hate the Central States. When southern savages and northern barbarians established ties, the Central States were like a thread due to be cut. \u695a\u6709\u738b\u8005\u5247\u5f8c\u670d\uff0c\u7121\u738b\u8005\u5247\u5148\u53db\u3002\u5937\u72c4\u4e5f\uff0c\u800c\u4e9f\u75c5\u4e2d\u570b\uff0c\u5357\u5937\u8207\u5317\u72c4\u4ea4\u3002\u4e2d\u570b\u4e0d\u7d55\u82e5\u7dda\u3002.Footnote 11 This statement\u2014coming from amid one of the most famous passages in the entire Gongyang zhuan\u2014set the framework for discussions of Chu political and cultural position within the Zhou world for millennia to come. It marked Chu as the epitome of the cultural Other, the malevolent polity which can be subjugated only under the reign of the True Monarch, and even then will forever remain prone to rebel. Coupled with a few other pejorative statements toward Chu, e.g., in Mengzi \u5b5f\u5b50 and the Records of the Historian (Shiji \u53f2\u8a18),Footnote 12 the Gongyang zhuan denigration of Chu attained the position of an orthodox view in traditional Chinese scholarship. The traditional view of Chu as a distinct cultural entity was reinforced in the last quarter of the twentieth century, as many discoveries from the Chu tombs brought to light the peculiar, \u201cflamboyant\u201dFootnote 13 style of its mortuary objects. Lothar von Falkenhausen observed: \u201cDazzled by these unique archeological treasures, many scholars and impressionable laypersons had been clinging to the romantic notion that Chu was a separate southern civilization, an elegant and exuberant other to the dour, disciplined Zhou in the north.\u201dFootnote 14 Yet this view of Chu as an \u201calternative civilization\u201d was questioned later in view of subsequent archeological discoveries. The new understanding, summarized by Xu Shaohua in the seminal volume by Constance A. Cook and John S. Major is that \u201cthere is little archeological evidence of a distinctive Chu culture during the Western Zhou times.\u201dFootnote 15 It was only from the Springs-and-Autumns period on that a divergent cultural pattern associated with Chu began emerging, and even then Chu's elite culture remained strongly conformant with the Zhou ritual practices.Footnote 16 This suggests an entirely different cultural trajectory: Chu was not a \u201cbarbarian entity\u201d attracted by the glory of the Zhou culture as hinted in the Mengzi,Footnote 17 but a normative Zhou polity that developed cultural assertiveness in tandem with the increase in its political power.Footnote 18 The difficulty of analyzing Chu's identity derives not only from the complexity of its cultural trajectory but also from the nature of our textual sources. The overwhelming majority of Chu-related accounts in transmitted texts come from the histories produced outside the state of Chu. The Springs-and-Autumns Annals and their commentaries were composed in the states of Lu and Qi; most of the Discourses of the States come from the Zhou royal domain, Lu, and Jin; and so is the case of most of historical anecdotes scattered throughout the Warring States\u2013period texts. While the Chu sections of the Discourses of the States and of Stratagems of Warring States (Zhanguo ce \u6230\u570b\u7b56), as well as segments of Zuo zhuan, may well have incorporated original Chu materials, we have no idea about the degree of editorial intervention by northern compilers in these materials. Look for instance at the Records of the Historian, our major source for pre-imperial history. Even those who do not subscribe to the accusation of Sima Qian \u53f8\u99ac\u9077 (ca. 145\u2013ca. 90 BCE) as the one who \u201cdescribes Chu in the imperialist terms of a northerner,\u201dFootnote 19 would not deny the obvious northern bias in his\u2014and other historical\u2014writings. This consideration should dictate utmost caution in reading these texts. To accept, for instance, the self-identification of Chu as a \u201cbarbarian\u201d polity on the basis of citations in the Discourses of the States and Records of the Historian,Footnote 20 strikes me as a haphazard conclusion. It is on this backdrop that we can appreciate the import of the newly unearthed historical and quasi-historical manuscripts from the state of Chu. These materials comprise several dozen historical anecdotes, a semi-legendary history (Rongchengshi \u5bb9\u6210\u6c0f), a sketchy history of Chu's capitals and royal palaces (Chuju \u695a\u5c45), and a more detailed Chu-focused history of inter-state relations from the eleventh to the early fourth century BCE (Xinian \u7e6b\u5e74). An integrative view of these materials may yield a novel perspective of Chu's self-image. That history writing was\u2014and is\u2014commonly utilized to articulate, strengthen, or shape the collective identity of a cultural, ethnic, or political entity is almost a truism. To be sure, this is just one of a means of strengthening or constructing a separate cultural or political identity, and not necessarily the major one. Yet, the importance of history writing with this regard, especially insofar as the educated segments of the population are concerned, is undeniable.Footnote 21 Paul R. Goldin noted that the emergence of local histories in the Eastern Zhou \u6771\u5468 (770\u2013256 BCE) period may be related to the nascent sense of regional identity.Footnote 22 In what follows I shall check whether or not this observation is valid for the state of Chu. How much do Chu historical texts reflect its separate cultural identity or contribute toward its formation? Do they polemicize with the denigration of Chu's culture in the northern texts? Do they bolster the Chu kings\u2019 legitimacy as potential leaders of All-under-Heaven? Do they present a different picture of Chu's relations with the Zhou polities from the one we have in the received texts? Do they use such common means of strengthening collective identity as focusing on Chu's wars with its rivals, glorifying its victories and lamenting its defeats? By answering these questions I hope to advance toward better understanding both of the issues related to the formation of Chu's identity and of the role of history-writing in the cultural processes during the Zhou era.\n\nCHU HISTORICAL ANECDOTES Didactic anecdotes\u2014short vignettes valued for their edifying messages\u2014are ubiquitous in pre-imperial writings. They permeate most texts later classified as either \u201chistories\u201d (like Discourses of the States and Stratagems of the Warring States), or \u201cphilosophies\u201d (e.g., Han Feizi \u97d3\u975e\u5b50, or L\u00fcshi chunqiu \u5442\u6c0f\u6625\u79cb), and even some of the \u201cclassics\u201d (e.g., Zuo zhuan).Footnote 23 The anecdotes figure prominently in the Shanghai Museum collection of Chu manuscripts, of which they constitute more than a half of the heretofore published titles; they are present, albeit less prominently, among the Chu manuscripts possessed by Qinghua (Tsinghua) University; and a few of them appear in other collections of Chu materials.Footnote 24 It is therefore appropriate to start our discussion of Chu historiography with the survey of these anecdotes. Since the lion's share of the anecdotes comes from the Shanghai Museum collection, I shall focus in what follows on this collection only.Footnote 25 One striking feature of the anecdotes from the Shanghai Museum collection is what Sarah Allan called their \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d content.Footnote 26 According to Allan's count, of twenty-four vignettes, thirteen come from Chu while the rest are spread throughout most of the Zhou world, coming from Lu (four), Qi (four), and one each from Jin, Zheng \u912d, and Wu \u5433. My own count differs slightly from Allan's, primarily because I count two anecdotes embedded in the same manuscript separately, and also because I follow rearrangements of slips into a different sequence of manuscripts as proposed by a few later redactors.Footnote 27 Yet the differences are minuscule. Putting aside multiple anecdotes related to Confucius and his disciples, we may summarize that Chu vignettes constitute just slightly over 60 percent of the anecdotes in the Shanghai Museum collection and the percentage will further decrease should we add anecdotes from another sites and collections, which are overwhelmingly non-Chu in their focus.Footnote 28 This allows an immediate observation: members of the Chu educated elite who took anecdotes with them to the final journey to the netherworld appear to be interested in the affairs of the entire Zhou realm rather than being narrowly focused on their own country. The next question will be: to what extent the Chu-related anecdotes from the Shanghai Museum collection represent aspects of Chu political or cultural identity? To facilitate the discussion of this question I have briefly summarized the content of the anecdotes in Table 1 below. Fifteen Chu anecdotes from the Shanghai Museum collection cover almost two centuries of Chu history: the earliest (#12) is related to the events of 633 BCE (on the eve of the Chengpu \u57ce\u6fee battle), while the latest (#3) dates from the time of King Jian of Chu \u695a\u7c21\u738b (r. ca. 431-405 BCE).Footnote 29 These eventful centuries witnessed the rise of Chu hegemony and a few severe setbacks, glorious victories and disastrous defeats, periods of domestic stability and of woeful turmoil. One may expect that these events will be at the focus of Chu historians\u2019 interest, but this is not the case. Of major battles, for instance, only two are mentioned in the anecdotes, and even they are given a marginal place in the narrative. The Chengpu battle of 632 BCE in which Chu lost its hegemony to the newly rising power of Jin is the backdrop of anecdote #12; yet rather than focusing on the battle, the anecdote just tells a story of military incompetence of Chu's Prime Minster (lingyin) Ziyu \u5b50\u7389. The story closely parallels the Zuo zhuan narrativeFootnote 30 and the picture of Ziyu's inadequacy presented in it mirrors that in Zuo zhuan. That the Chengpu setback is all but glossed over is understandable; yet Chu's successes also generally do not attract the authors\u2019 attention. An exception is the Bi \u90b2 battle of 597 BCE in which King Zhuang of Chu \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 613\u2013591 BCE) defeated the Jin armies and solidified his hegemony over the Zhou world. This battle\u2014or, more precisely, the events that led to it\u2014are at the center of anecdote #8. The narrative partly parallels Zuo zhuan but also departs from it in a few important details. Most notably, Chu's assault on Zheng which led to the Bi battle is presented as a punitive expedition against Prince Guisheng \u516c\u5b50\u6b78\u751f (aka Zijia \u5b50\u5bb6) of Zheng who assassinated his ruler, Lord Ling \u912d\u9748\u516c, in 605 BCE. This presentation is obviously biased in favor of Chu. As is clear from the very detailed depiction of these events in Zuo zhuan and elsewhere, King Zhuang's assault on Zheng in 597 BCE had nothing to do with penalizing Zijia, who was already dead by then and who in any case was posthumously chastened by Zheng leaders. The real reason for King Zhuang's assault on Zheng was to punish the perfidy of Zheng's rulers, who repeatedly switched allegiance from Chu to Jin and back to Chu. By replacing power consideration with the noble goal of punishing Zijia, the authors of the anecdote legitimate King Zhuang's assault on Zheng. The anecdote further implies that it is due to the king's morality and ritual correctness that he had subjugated Zheng and defeated the Jin army. So is it pure pro-Chu propaganda? Possibly yes, but not necessarily so. As Wei Cide noticed, the anecdote is less concerned with defending King Zhuang's actions, but, rather with the didactic conclusion: only morally justified military campaigns will meet with success.Footnote 31 Hence this anecdote cannot be considered a decisive manifestation of pro-Chu sentiments. Among other anecdotes, only one (#14) mentions military affairs of Chu, but this is done very briefly in the context of discussing correct military training; the list of successful campaigns of the past is not invoked to enhance the country's prestige. At times Chu's military successes are hinted at\u2014e.g., in anecdote #4\u2014but only as a backdrop for discussing the imminent danger of Chu's decline. In general, the anecdotes\u2019 authors are not much interested in Chu's past attainments and display no pride in the country's successes. When another expansionist ruler, King Ling \u695a\u9748\u738b (r. 540\u2013529 BCE) is mentioned, this is done to reiterate his negative image as an arrogant and intemperate leader rather than to hail his achievements (anecdotes ##5 and 13). The major goal of the Chu-related anecdotes from the Shanghai Museum collection is not to glorify the militarily prominent Chu kings but rather to extol those monarchs who were able to heed remonstrance and mend their ways. Most of the remonstrance-focused anecdotes revolve around two of the least powerful Chu kings, King Ping \u695a\u5e73\u738b (r. 528\u2013516 BCE) and his son, King Zhao \u695a\u662d\u738b (r. 515\u2013489 BCE). The first of these rose to power in a fratricidal struggle which not only put an end to the reign of King Ling, but also caused a considerable decrease in Chu's international prestige, and the country's territorial contraction. King Zhao encountered an even greater disaster: an assault by Wu armies in 506 BCE caused him to flee the capital and put the entire country on the verge of collapse. As the weakest ruler on the throne of Chu during the period under discussion, King Zhao appears to be more prone than his predecessors or successors to heed remonstrance, mend his behavior, and tolerate criticism. These qualities are hailed in several anecdotes (##1, 2, 9). One's impression is that the authors of the anecdotes prefer weak and compliant kings to those who display extraordinary martial prowess but are also less tolerant of critical-minded aides. To summarize, Chu vignettes from the Shanghai Museum\u2014with the possible exception of anecdote #8\u2014appear to be unconcerned with the country's separate identity, its pride, its glorious past, and the like. Most of these anecdotes lack an identifiable Chu flavor: they could be placed in a different setting and with a different list of protagonists without altering their meaning.Footnote 32 In a few other cases\u2014such as anecdotes ##4 and 5 (which, to repeat, are part of the same manuscript)\u2014there is no doubt that the authors targeted exclusively a Chu audience, because both anecdotes presuppose a high level of knowledge of Chu history, without which they would remain barely comprehensible.Footnote 33 However, these anecdotes, much like the rest surveyed above, are devoid of any visible emphasis on Chu's cultural or political specifics. It may be justifiable to speak of them, and of the heretofore published Chu anecdotes in general, as \u201cidentity-neutral.\u201d This impression strengthens when we take into account non-Chu anecdotes from the Shanghai Museum collection and other materials from Chu tombs. Take for instance a manuscript named Wu ming \u5433\u547d, which revolves around a speech apparently delivered by the messenger of King Fuchai of Wu \u5433\u738b\u592b\u5dee (r. 495\u2013473 BCE) to the Zhou Son of Heaven.Footnote 34 The speech justifies Wu's ongoing war with Chu as defense of the Zhou house; Chu is accused of \u201cacting not in accordance with the Way\u201d (Jing [or Chu ren] wei bu Dao \u834a [or \u695a\u4eba] \u70ba\u4e0d\u9053, slips 4 and 9).Footnote 35 That this accusation appears in a speech attributed to one of Chu's staunchest foes is expectable; but that it is not qualified at all in an anecdote that circulated in the state of Chu, was transcribed into a Chu script, and was buried in a Chu tomb is surprising. The surprise becomes even greater when we notice the Chu manuscripts\u2019 attitudes to the figure of Wu Zixu \u4f0d\u5b50\u80e5 (d. 484 BCE). Wu Zixu, a son of a high minister of Chu who fell victim to slanderers and was executed by King Ping, vowed to avenge his father's death. He fled to the state of Wu and led its assault against Chu, bringing about Wu's occupation of Chu's capital, Ying, in 506. The occupation was a deeply humiliating and traumatic event; according to the Guliang Commentary (Guliang zhuan \u7a40\u6881\u50b3) on the Springs-and-Autumns Annals, it involved among other things desecration of King Ping's tomb and flogging his corpse.Footnote 36 Wu Zixu made a brilliant career in Wu, but later King Fuchai rejected his advice and ordered him to commit suicide. In due time, Wu Zixu became a paragon of loyalty entering the pantheon of righteous ministers who met an inglorious end.Footnote 37 This perspective, however, is decidedly non-Chu: after all, from the Chu point of view, Wu Zixu should be considered a major enemy, a murderous turncoat. Yet in two of the Chu manuscripts\u2014Poverty and Success are a Matter of Timing (Qiong da yi shi \u7aae\u9054\u4ee5\u6642) from the Guodian collection and Good Ministers (Liang chen \u826f\u81e3) from the Qinghua collection, Wu Zixu is hailed as a model minister without any mention of his anti-Chu deeds.Footnote 38 This latter example further strengthens my tentative conclusion: Chu historical anecdotes, as well as other historical and philosophical texts, lack any visible interest in Chu identity. Their Chu affiliation is marginal to their content. Their focus is decisively supra-regional: they concern the affairs of \u201cAll-under-Heaven\u201d and could be produced in any of the competing states.\n\nCHU JU Aside from multiple anecdotes, recent discoveries of Chu-related histories yielded a few lengthier texts, to which I shall turn now. One of these, Chu Residences (Chu ju \u695a\u5c45), from the first volume of the Qinghua collection, is the first known example of a pure Chu history. This brief text, transcribed on 14 slips, records Chu's history from the semi-legendary progenitor of the Chu royal lineage, Jilian \u5b63\u9023, down to King Dao of Chu \u695a\u60bc\u738b (r. ca. 401\u2013381 BCE). It provides a few important details on the early history of Chu,Footnote 39 including, significantly, about the formation of its major aristocratic lineages.Footnote 40 However, as we enter the better known historical period (primarily the eighth century BCE and later), the narrative becomes very sketchy. Its only focus is on the changing location of the country's capitals, or, more precisely, of the ruler's palaces.Footnote 41 Almost no additional information is given: battles, domestic struggles, victories and defeats are all but absent, except in a few cases when they directly influenced the capital's location (for instance, the Ruoao \u82e5\u6556 lineage's revolt of 605 BCE, the Wu occupation of Chu's capital in 506 BCE, and the revolt of Duke of Bai \u767d\u516c in 479 BCE). Sensitive information is not necessarily concealed (as is the case with Xinian, discussed below); it is simply not considered essential. Chu ju is a puzzling text. Who were its audience? One may well read this sketchy, even if informative, text as an early version of a gaokao \u9ad8\u8003 material: a draft reply for an exam on Chu's historical geography. Speaking more seriously, I may speculate that this short survey of Chu's royal residences could be prepared specifically for foreigners in the service of Chu kings. Perhaps dwellings of former rulers possessed a certain ritual or cultic importance that should be clarified to a newcomer to the state of Chu. Maybe this was a kind of sensitive domestic information akin to local taboos and prohibitions which the foreigner should learn upon arrival?Footnote 42 Needless to say this assertion is currently impossible to verify. Chu ju is a useful source of information for those seeking to augment sketchy data in the received sources about early ancestors of the Chu royal lineage, and it contains seeds of heretofore unknown early dynastic legends, but these are less relevant to my discussion.Footnote 43 Here I want to focus on the opening lines of Chu ju, which narrate the story of the primeval ancestor of Chu, Jilian. The story tells: Jilian first descended at Mt. Wei, then arrived at Qiong Cave; advanced to depart from Mt. Qiao, making his dwelling at the Yuan Slope. He moved up the stream of the Chuan River, where he met the son of Pangeng, who lived at Mt. Fang. His (Pangeng's son's) daughter was named Ancestress Zhui. She was the utmost beauty, outshining everybody within the four quarters. Jilian heard of her betrothal and pursued her, reaching her at the waterside. There she gave birth to the elder son Cheng and the second-born Yuan. \u5b63\u9023\u521d\u964d\u4e8e\u9a29\u5c71\uff0c\u62b5\u4e8e\u7a74\u7aae\u3002\u524d\u51fa\u4e8e\u9a55\u5c71\uff0c\u5b85\u8655\u7230\u6ce2\uff08\u5761\uff09\u3002\u9006\u4e0a\u6c4c\u6c34\uff0c\u898b\u76e4\u5e9a\u4e4b\u5b50\uff0c\u8655\u65bc\u65b9\u5c71\u3002\u5973\u66f0\u6bd4\u96b9\uff0c\u79c9\u8332\u7387\u3010\u4e00\u3011\u76f8\uff0c\u8a48 \uff08\u80c4\uff09\u56db\u65b9\u3002\u5b63\u9023\u805e\u5176\u6709\u8058\uff0c\u5f9e\uff0c\u53ca\u4e4b\u76e4\uff0c\u7230\u751f \u4f2f\u3001\u9060\u4ef2\u3002\u3010\u4e8c\u3011Footnote 44 Limitations of space prevent me from adequately dealing with the rich geographical and mythological information in this section; I shall focus on its political aspects only. Jilian\u2014whose \u201cdescending\u201d (jiang \u964d) apparently implies divine birthFootnote 45 \u2014is considered the forefather of the Mi \u7f8b clan, i.e. the royal clan of Chu. Normally he is not identified as the earliest of Chu ancestors. According to the \u201cHereditary house of Chu\u201d chapter in the Records of the Historian, Jilian was preceded by several primordial ancestors, most notably the primeval Thearch Zhuanxu \u9853\u980a and the Rectifier of Fire (huozheng \u706b\u6b63) Zhurong \u795d\u878d.Footnote 46 Chu sacrificial materials from Tomb 2, Baoshan, Jingmen \u834a\u9580\u5305\u5c71 (Hubei), from Tomb 1, Wangshan, Jiangling \u6c5f\u9675\u671b\u5c71 (Hubei), and from Tomb 1 at Geling, Xincai \u65b0\u8521\u845b\u9675 (Henan), all record sacrifices to Zhurong and to his ancestor Laotong \u8001\u50ee, who were apparently considered more worthy of sacrifice than Jilian.Footnote 47 Yet these primeval ancestors are not mentioned at all in Chu ju. Instead the focus is on Jilian and on his relations with the son of the Shang \u5546 king, Pangeng \u76e4\u5e9a, whose daughter Jilian married.Footnote 48 This emphasis on the relations with the Shang ruling lineage suggests that the Shang connection was highly important for the narrators. Evidently, marrying Pangeng's granddaughter was a source of pride for the ancestor of the Chu ruling house, possibly an important asset for bolstering the house's legitimacy and prestige.Footnote 49 The emphasis on Jilian at the expense of his illustrious ancestors and some of his meritorious descendants is significant in the context of my discussion. It shows surprising modesty of the Chu historians who composed the Chu ju. To demonstrate the degree of this modesty it may be useful to compare Chu ju with a rarely noticed piece of pro-Chu propaganda in a transmitted text, namely the Zheng section of the Discourses of the States. The \u201cZheng yu\u201d \u912d\u8a9e narrates an advice given by the Zhou Scribe Bo \u53f2\u4f2f to Lord Huan of Zheng \u912d\u6853\u516c (r. 806\u2013770 BCE) on the eve of the collapse of the Western Zhou. The dating of the text is debatable, but it is likely that it is anterior to Chu ju.Footnote 50 One of the most interesting parts of this text is the section in which Scribe Bo predicts the unstoppable rise of Chu. According to his analysis, Chu's good fortunes derive from the merits of its leaders, past and present: Viscount Xiong Yan of Jing [= Chu] had four sons: [the elder] Boshuang, [the second] Zhongxue, [the third] Shuxiong, and [the youngest] Jixun.Footnote 51 Shuxiong avoided troubles by fleeing to Pu, where he became a savage; hence Jixun was established.Footnote 52 The Wei lineage planned to establish [Shuxiong] but failed to overcome troubles. This means that Heaven opened the path for him [Jixun].Footnote 53 Moreover, he is perspicacious and clear minded, harmonious and amicable; [his merits] exceed those of the former kings. I have heard: one for whom Heaven opens the path cannot be replaced for ten generations. His descendants will surely greatly expand their territory: they cannot be pressed.

Surely this line of argumentation in bolstering Chu's prestige was known to Chu statesmen and historians of the early Warring States period (which is the approximate time of Chu ju compilation).Footnote 59 That they opted to ignore it and to emphasize instead relations of the Mi clan to the Shang king Pangeng cannot be accidental. For whatever reasons, the composers of Chu ju may have considered intermarriage with the Shang royal clan as a more significant factor in supporting the Chu royalty than deeds of meritorious ancestors. Once again, a Chu historical text appears much less concerned with pro-Chu propaganda than could have been expected.\n\nXINIAN Xinian \u7e6b\u5e74 is another bamboo manuscript from the collection of Qinghua University. It is the lengthiest and most detailed historical text unearthed in recent decades. The text is divided into 23 sections that narrate major events from the history of the state of Chu, its rivals, and its allies from the beginning of the Western Zhou period to the early fourth century BCE. As I have discussed its structure, its dating, its potential audience, and the question of its authenticity elsewhere,Footnote 60 I shall focus here on the following topics: the text's relation to the state of Chu, its relevance to our search for traits of separate Chu identity, and the relation between its narration of Chu history and that in Zuo zhuan. Xinian is a composite text that incorporates materials from several Zhou polities; judging from the chronology it applies, these are the Western Zhou royal domain, and the states of Jin and Chu from the Eastern Zhou period. Yet despite the heterogeneity of the source materials, there are clear indications that Xinian was composed and probably edited in the state of Chu. First, each section of the text, except for the first, which narrates exclusively Western Zhou affairs, deals with the state of Chu either directly or through discussing its primary rivals or allies, such as the state of Jin. Second, the geographical perspective of Xinian is obviously biased toward the western part of the Zhou world. For instance, the state of Qin\u2014an important ally of Chu during much of the period under discussion\u2014is covered much more expansively than in other contemporaneous texts,Footnote 61 while eastern states, such as Qi and Lu which played a lesser role in Chu history, are less prominent; thus, the exploits of Lord Huan of Qi \u9f4a\u6853\u516c (r. 685\u2013643 BCE), which occupy pride of place in Zuo zhuan, are given only marginal attention. Third, the Chu affiliation becomes more pronounced in the last sections of the text, which\u2014uncharacteristically for the rest of Xinian\u2014adopt the Chu chronology even when the narrative deals with Jin. Fourth, there are ritual indications of the text's respect toward the Chu kings: their deaths are invariably recorded as solemnly \u201cpassing away\u201d (jishi \u5373\u4e16), while this courtesy is not uniformly observed with regard to other regional lords.Footnote 62 All this suggests that the text was produced in Chu, although it clearly incorporated non-Chu materials. In marked distinction from Chu ju that focuses on internal history of Chu (or, more precisely, on a single aspect of it, namely the location of royal capitals and palaces), Xinian is preoccupied with Chu's foreign relations. Domestic affairs of Chu are rarely mentioned, and major instances of internal turmoil, such as the coups that first catapulted King Ling into power and then caused his fall, are glossed over. This concealment reminds one of the Springs-and-Autumns Annals, which never report directly about major domestic troubles in the state of Lu.Footnote 63 Yet Xinian does not conceal cases of Chu's military defeats, nor even tries to soften their impact. Let us look at section 21, which deals with the late fifth-century BCE struggle between Jin and Chu: At the seventh year of King Jianda of Chu [i.e., King Jian, r. ca. 431\u2013405 BCE], Lord Dao of Song attended the court audience in Chu, reporting that Pi, Minister of Public Works, acts to weaken the lord's house. The king ordered mo'ao Yang Wei to lead an army to stabilize the lord's house [of Song]. [This army] walled Huangchi and walled Yongqiu.Footnote 64 The Jin [leaders] Wei Si, Zhao Wan, and Han Qizhang led an army laying a siege on Huangchi; they assaulted it and then returned it to Chu.Footnote 65 After two years, the king ordered mo'ao Yang Wei to lead an army to invade Jin. He seized Yiyang and laid a siege to Chiyan so as to retaliate for the Huangchi campaign.Footnote 66 The Jin [leaders] Wei Si, Zhao Wan, and Han Qizhang led an army to assist Chiyan. The Chu army gave up the siege and retreated, and it fought the Jin army near the Long Wall.Footnote 67 The Chu army achieved nothing. They threw away their banners and tents and fled by night. Therefore Chu harbored strong resentment against Jin. \u695a\u7c21\u5927\u738b\u7acb\u4e03\u5e74\uff0c\u5b8b\u60bc\u516c\u671d\u4e8e\u695a\uff0c\u544a\u4ee5\u5b8b\u53f8\u57ce \u4e4b\u7d04\uff08\u5f31\uff1f\uff09\u516c\u5ba4\u3002\u738b\u547d\u83ab\u6556\u967d\u7232\u7387 \u3010114\u3011\u5e2b\u4ee5\u5b9a\u516c\u5ba4\uff0c\u57ce\u9ec3\u6c60\uff0c\u57ce\u96cd\u4e18\u3002\u6649\u9b4f\u65af\u3001\u8d99\u6d63\u3001\u97d3\u5553\u7ae0\u7387\u5e2b\u570d\u9ec3\u6c60\uff0c \u8ff5\u800c\u6b78\u4e4b\u3010115\u3011\u65bc\u695a\u3002\u4e8c\u5e74\uff0c\u738b\u547d\u83ab\u6556\u967d\u7232\u7387\u5e2b\u4fb5\u6649\uff0c\u62d5\uff08\u596a\uff09\u5b9c\u967d\uff0c\u570d\u8d64\u5cb8\uff0c\u4ee5\u5fa9\u9ec3\u6c60\u4e4b\u5e2b\u3002\u9b4f\u65af\u3001\u8d99\u6d63\u3001\u97d3\u5553\u3010116\u3011\u7ae0\u7387\u5e2b\u6551\u8d64\u5cb8\uff0c\u695a\u4eba\u820d\u570d\u800c\u9084\uff0c\u8207\u6649\u5e2b\u6230\u65bc\u9577\u57ce\u3002\u695a\u5e2b\u7121\u529f\uff0c\u591a\u68c4\u65c3\u5e55\uff0c\u5bb5\u9041\u3002\u695a\u4ee5\u3010117\u3011\u8207\u6649\u56fa\u7232\u6028\u3002\u3010118\u3011Footnote 68 The story of a continuous tit-for-tat struggle between Jin and Chu is depicted in such a neutral fashion that save from the Chu chronology nothing indicates its Chu origin. The text narrates in detail the humiliating defeat of the Chu armies: first, they abandoned the siege of Jin's Chiyan, retreating to Chu's Long Wall at Fangcheng \u65b9\u57ce; then they were battered there, throwing away \u201cbanners and tents\u201d and fleeing by night. The text which does it best to conceal domestic troubles at Chu, narrates quite candidly how ingloriously its armies fought. This candor becomes even more pronounced in the last section, which depicts a series of Chu-Jin campaigns ca. 400\u2013396 BCE. That section ends with the following passage: After two years (396 BCE?),Footnote 69 Han Qu and Wei Ji led an army and laid siege to Wuyang, to repay the incursion of Gao (of 398 BCE).Footnote 70 The Lord of Luyang led an army to help Wuyang, and fought the Jin army below the Wuyang walls. The Chu army was greatly defeated. Three lords-possessors of the gui tablet, the Duke of Luyang, Duke Daowu of Pingye, and Duke Huanding of Yangcheng, as well as youyin Si of Zhao (Zhao Si), died in that battle;Footnote 71 the Chu forces threw away their banners, tents, chariots and weapons, and returned, running like fleeing dogs. The Chen people thereupon rebelled and let Prince Ding back into Chen.Footnote 72 Thus the state of Chu lost a lot of walled cities. \u53ad\uff08\u85a6\uff1f\uff09\u5e74\uff0c\u97d3\u3010133\u3011\u53d6\u3001\u9b4f\u64ca\u7387\u5e2b\u570d\u6b66\u967d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5fa9\u90dc\u4e4b\u5e2b\u3002\u9b6f\u967d\u516c\u7387\u5e2b\u6551\u6b66\u967d\uff0c\u8207\u6649\u5e2b\u6230\u65bc\u6b66\u967d\u4e4b\u57ce\u3010134\u3011\u4e0b\uff0c\u695a\u5e2b\u5927\u6557\uff0c\u9b6f\u967d\u516c\u3001\u5e73\u591c\u60bc\u6b66\u541b\u3001\u967d\u57ce\u6853\u5b9a\u541b\uff0c\u4e09\u57f7\u73ea\u4e4b\u541b\u8207\u53f3\u5c39\u662d\u4e4b\u7ae2\u6b7b\u7109\uff0c\u695a\u4eba\u76e1\u68c4\u5176\u3010135\u3011\u65c3\u5e55\u8eca\u5175\uff0c\u72ac\u9038\u800c\u9084\u3002\u9673\u4eba\u7109\u53cd\u800c\u5165\u738b\u5b50\u5b9a\u65bc\u9673\u3002\u695a\u90a6\u4ee5\u591a\u4ea1\u57ce\u3002Footnote 73 Putting precise details of these campaigns aside we can immediately notice the highly unflattering depiction of Chu military performance in the text. The text not only frankly admits the magnitude of Chu's defeat but even buttresses it through a humiliating comparison of Chu's fleeing armies to running dogs. Clearly, the idea of strengthening the Chu identity and its pride in a or its glorious past was not the concern of Xinian composers. Two above examples suffice to show how candid the Xinian authors are in depicting Chu's military defeats. Nor do they hail the victories too much. The beginning of Chu's territorial expansion is briefly mentioned in sections 2 and 5, but it is not eulogized nor is it connected to any merits of Chu kings. Rather it is presented as coincidental: favorable inter-state circumstances allowed Chu to advance into the Han \u6f22 River valley and beyond. Great victories of Chu under King Zhuang, the singularly successful Chu leader, are noticed but do not merit detailed discussion. Oddly, King Zhuang's exploits are highlighted in Xinian much less than in Zuo zhuan. Nor does the text single out any other Chu leader for exceptional praise. That Xinian is not concerned with Chu's local pride does not require further illustrations. Yet its discovery may allow us to pose another question: How does its presentation of Zhou history differ from that in transmitted sources, especially Zuo zhuan? Since the bulk of Xinian (sections 4\u201319) largely parallels the Zuo zhuan narrative, this allows a meaningful comparison between the two. Elsewhere I have undertaken this comparison and have demonstrated the considerable similarities between the two narratives.Footnote 74 The two texts do differ with regard to certain details, but generally the differences are minor. In a few cases, however, different narration of the same chain of events in Xinian may reflect its authors\u2019 pro-Chu stance. For our discussion the most interesting case is section 16 of Xinian, which differs from Zuo zhuan in a few important details. Let us focus on its account: In the seventh year of King Gong of Chu (r. 590\u2013560 BCE, i.e. in 584 BCE), Prime Minister Zizhong invaded Zheng, initiating the Fan campaign.Footnote 75 Lord Jing of Jin (r. 599\u2013581 BCE) assembled the regional lords to rescue Zheng. The people of Zheng captured [a Chu officer,] Yi, the lord of Yun, and presented him to Lord Jing. Lord Jing returned [to Jin] taking [Yi] with him. [After?] one year (582 BCE?),Footnote 76 Lord Jing wanted to establish amicable relations with Chu; hence, he released the Lord of Yun, and let him go back and seek peace. King Gong of Chu dispatched the Lord of Yun for an official visit to Jin and approved the peace. Lord Jing dispatched Fa of Ji (Ji Fa) for an official visit to Chu, renewing the peace. Before [Ji Fa] returned, [Lord Jing of Jin] died, and Lord Li (r. 580\u2013574 BCE) was established. King Gong dispatched Royal Scion Chen for an official visit to Jin and also renewed the peace. The king also sent the Song Commander-of-the-Right, Huasun Yuan [Hua Yuan] to arrange peaceful relations between Jin and Chu. The next year (579 BCE), Royal Scion Ba of Chu met Wenzi Xie (i.e., Shi Xie \u58eb\u71ee, a.k.a. Shi Wenzi \u58eb\u6587\u5b50) of Jin and nobles of regional lords, and made a covenant at Song, saying: \u201cPut to rest armor and weapons of All-under-Heaven.\u201d The next year (578 BCE), Lord Li [of Jin] was the first to raise an army and lead the regional lords to invade Qin, reaching the Jing River. King Gong also led an army, laying siege at Zheng. Lord Li came to rescue Zheng and defeated the Chu army at Yan.Footnote 77 Lord Li also encountered misfortune, and died leaving no posterity.Footnote 78 \u695a\u5171\u738b\u7acb\u4e03\u5e74\uff0c\u4ee4\u5c39\u5b50\u91cd\u4f10\u912d\uff0c\u7232\uff1f\uff08\u6c3e\uff1f\uff09\u4e4b\u5e2b\u3002\u6649\u666f\u516c\u6703\u8af8\u4faf\u4ee5\u6551\u912d\uff0c\u912d\u4eba\u6b62\u9116\u516c\u5100\uff0c\u737b\u301085\u3011\u8af8\u666f\u516c\uff0c\u666f\u516c\u4ee5\u6b78\u3002\u4e00\u5e74\uff0c\u666f\u516c\u6b32\u8207\u695a\u4eba\u7232\u597d\uff0c\u4e43\u812b\u9116\u516c\uff0c\u4f7f\u6b78\u6c42\u6210\uff0c\u5171\u738b\u4f7f\u9116\u516c\u8058\u65bc\u301086\u3011\u6649\uff0c\u4e14\u8a31\u6210\u3002\u666f\u516c\u4f7f\u7cf4\u4e4b\u8337\u8058\u65bc\u695a\uff0c\u4e14\u4fee\u6210\uff0c\u672a\u9084\uff0c\u666f\u516c\u5352\uff0c\u53b2\u516c\u5373\u4f4d\u3002\u5171\u738b\u4f7f\u738b\u301087\u3011\u5b50\u8fb0\u8058\u65bc\u6649\uff0c\u53c8\u4fee\u6210\uff0c\u738b\u53c8\u4f7f\u5b8b\u53f3\u5e2b\u83ef\u5b6b\u5143\u884c\u6649\u695a\u4e4b\u6210\u3002\u660e\u6b72\uff0c\u695a\u738b\u5b50\u7f77\u6703\u6649\u6587\u301088\u3011\u5b50\u71ee\u53ca\u8af8\u4faf\u4e4b\u5927\u592b\uff0c\u76df\u65bc\u5b8b\uff0c\u66f0\uff1a\u201c\u723e\uff08\u5f2d\uff09\u5929\u4e0b\u4e4b\u7532\u5175\u3002\u201d \u660e\u6b72\uff0c\u53b2\u516c\u5148\u8d77\u5175\uff0c\u7387\u5e2b\u6703\u8af8\u4faf\u4ee5\u4f10\u301089\u3011\u79e6\uff0c\u81f3\u4e8e\u6d87\u3002\u5171\u738b\u4ea6\u7387\u5e2b\u570d\u912d\uff0c\u53b2\u516c\u6551\u912d\uff0c\u6557\u695a\u5e2b\u65bc\u9122\u3002\u53b2\u516c\u4ea6\u898b\u798d\u4ee5\u6b7b\uff0c\u4ea1\uff08\u7121\uff09\u5f8c\u3002\u301090\u3011Footnote 79 This narrative focuses on the first attempt to establish a lasting peace between Chu and Jin\u2014the peace conference in the state of Song in 579 BCE\u2014and the rapid breakup of amicable relations between the two parties thereafter. I shall not focus here on the very minor discrepancies between the Xinian and Zuo zhuan narratives. What matters for me is the core of the story: Who was responsible for the breakup of the first attempt to reconcile two rival powers? The events depicted in Xinian are narrated in great detail in Zuo zhuan, and the two sources agree on the basic facts. What differs, though, is the nature of the peace conference in 579 BCE, and the reasons for its failure. In Zuo zhuan, the conference was attended by just two parties, Jin and Chu; and the covenant (the content of which is cited) focused on establishing amicable relations between the two parties only. In Xinian, in distinction, the meeting was attended also by the \u201cnobles of regional lords\u201d (i.e., was multilateral), and the covenant's goal was attaining peace in \u201cAll-under-Heaven,\u201d similar to the later multilateral peace conferences of 546 BCE and 541 BCE.Footnote 80 On this point, Zuo zhuan appears more reliable: should a 579 BCE peace conference have been attended by more parties, it is likely that this would be reflected in the Springs-and-Autumns Annals as well, which is not the case. It is more plausible that the Xinian authors (or the authors of their source) conflated the agreements of 546 BCE and 541 BCE with that of 579 BCE. What happened after the agreement? Zuo zhuan insists that Chu was perfidious: soon after the covenant was sealed, the Chu lingyin \u4ee4\u5c39 (Prime Minister) warned his visiting Jin colleague that the two rulers, if they ever met, would only exchange arrows and not ceremonial greetings.Footnote 81 The subsequent Jin assault on Qin in 578 BCE is presented as unrelated to the Jin-Chu peace agreement and as fully justifiable in light of Qin's anti-Jin machinations. It is Chu's attack on Zheng in 576 BCE that violates the covenant with Jin; Zuo zhuan repeatedly cites pronouncements of Chu and Jin dignitaries, who blame the Chu leadership for violating the peace and leading to the disastrous (for Chu) battle of Yanling \u9122\u9675 in 575 BCE. Only at the depiction of the battle itself does the Zuo zhuan narration shift toward a more critical stance toward Jin: its success is presented as a Pyrrhic victory, leading soon to domestic turmoil. Xinian\u2019s interpretation of these events differs radically. The Jin assault against Qin is viewed as a violation of an agreement to establish \u201cuniversal\u201d peace; Chu's assault on Zheng appears as a retaliatory measure. Moreover, the Xinian authors are manipulative in their account: by dispelling with precise chronology after 578 BCE, they present all the events that spanned five years (Chu's attack on Zheng, Jin's retaliation, the Yanling battle, and the coup against Lord Li of Jin) as happening immediately one after another in the direct aftermath of Jin's anti-Qin aggression. The blame for the collapse of peace is placed squarely on Lord Li of Jin, whose violent death a year after the Yanling battle may be seen as divine retaliation for his perfidy. Chu was the victim; and while it was defeated militarily, the perpetrator, Lord Li, was punished by a humiliating death. There is no doubt that we have here two radically different interpretations of the same chain of events: the predominantly pro-Jin narrative of Zuo zhuan versus the unequivocally pro-Chu version of Xinian. Yet we should notice immediately that in terms of facts both narratives do not differ substantially (except for the precise content of the 579 covenant). And while each of the accounts is manipulative, neither appears to abandon the basic factual framework. This supports my earlier observation that the historical accounts of both Xinian and Zuo zhuan are fundamentally reliable\u2014minor embellishments, mistakes, and manipulations notwithstanding.Footnote 82 For the current discussion, suffice it to notice that while there are traits of pro-Chu sentiments in Xinian, in general this text contributes very little\u2014if at all\u2014to strengthening the Chu identity. Much like the anecdotes and Chu ju, Xinian remains overwhelmingly neutral in its depiction of Chu's past.\n\nRONGCHENGSHI The final text that I want to consider here is Rongchengshi \u5bb9\u6210\u6c0f, from the collection of Shanghai Museum. This relatively lengthy text of slightly over 2,000 characters presents the history of the Chinese world from the time of legendary thearchs down to the founding of the Zhou dynasty. The goal of this presentation is not purely historical: the narrative is built so as to convince the reader of the advantages of non-hereditary power transfer (ideally through the ruler's abdication in favor of a worthier candidate). Since the text had been translated and discussed twice,Footnote 83 I shall not address its complexity here but focus only on its Chu-related aspects. The Chu affiliation of Rongchengshi is not self-evident. While the manuscript was produced by a Chu scribe using Chu orthography, and was in all likelihood interred in the tomb of a Chu elite member, almost nothing in its content relates it to Chu. The only possible Chu trait is in the final phrase of the narrative about the creation of the Nine Provinces by Thearch Yu \u79b9 in the aftermath of the great flood. The narrative itself has no observable Chu connection, and the map of the Nine Provinces in Rongchengshi is markedly shifted to the north in comparison with its variants scattered through other texts, leaving Chu on the southern margins of the habitable world.Footnote 84 Yet the ending lines say: \u201cYu then created five hundred famous valleys to the south of the Han River and five hundred famous valleys to the north of the Han River\u201d.Footnote 85 This centrality of the Han River strongly suggests a Chu affiliation of the text's authors. However, as noted by Vera Dorofeeva-Lichtmann, it is also possible that the line was added by a Chu transmitter who wanted to make the text\u2014originally produced elsewhere\u2014more relevant to Chu.Footnote 86 Aside from this single line, no other aspect of Rongchengshi connects it with the state of Chu. I remain undecided regarding the origin of Rongchengshi: perhaps we should not consider it at all as a product of Chu historiography. However, insofar as the manuscript was looted from a Chu tomb, and insofar as it can be assumed that the text circulated in the state of Chu (and might have enjoyed sufficient prestige to merit interment in a tomb) it is justifiable to consider it in the framework of the present discussion. Two points should be raised here. First is the marked absence of identifiable Chu royal ancestors\u2014such as Zhuanxu, Zhurong, and the like\u2014from the lengthy list of legendary heroes discussed in the text. Second, the Rongchengshi narrative is markedly \u201ccenter-oriented,\u201d as it focuses exclusively on the monarchs who ruled the entire subcelestial realm. Regional lords, be they the kings of Chu or leaders of other polities, are simply ignored. The norm, as the authors repeatedly emphasize, is universal rule, attaining which represents the apex of the monarch's achievements. Thus, the text hails a primordial thearch whose reign preceded that of Thearch Yao \u582f: Superiors and inferiors, noble and mean\u2014each attained their [predestined] years. [The people] from beyond the four seas arrived as guests, and those from within the four seas were corrected. Birds and beasts came to court; fish and turtles submitted [tribute]; there was [smooth] communication between [localities with] abundant and deficient [resources]. \u4e0a\u4e0b\u8cb4\u8ce4\uff0c\u5404\u5f97\u5176\u4e16\u3002\u56db\u6d77\u4e4b\u5916\u8cd3\uff0c\u56db\u6d77\u4e4b\u5167\u8c9e\u3002\u79bd\u7378\u671d\uff0c\u9b5a\u9f08\u737b\uff0c\u6709\u7121\u901a\u3002Footnote 87 Elsewhere, the text hails the rule of Thearch Yu: He understood the distant from [inspecting] the near, eradicated quibbling and pursued simplicity; he relied on the people's desires, brought together the beneficent [matters of] Heaven and Earth, so that the near rejoiced in the orderly rule while the distant came on their own initiative. Everybody within and outside the four seas requested to submit tribute. \u4e43\u56e0\u8fe9\u4ee5\u77e5\u9060\uff0c\u53bb\u82db\u800c\u884c\u7c21\uff0c\u56e0\u6c11\u4e4b\u6b32\uff0c\u6703\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u5229\uff0c\u592b\u662f\u4ee5\u8fd1\u8005\u6085\u6cbb\uff0c\u800c\u9060\u8005\u81ea\u81f3\u3002\u56db\u6d77\u4e4b\u5167\u53ca\uff0c\u56db\u6d77\u4e4b\u5916\u7686\u8acb\u8ca2\u3002Footnote 88 Both passages emphasize the universality of the thearch's rule. In the first case the encompassing power of an unnamed thearch transcends the boundaries of humankind, reaching down to birds, beasts, fish, and turtles: all those strive to become the thearch's subjects.Footnote 89 In the second case unity remains confined to the realm of humans, but it is still comprehensive: all those from \u201cwithin and outside the four seas\u201d duly request to submit tribute. In both cases the entire subcelestial realm\u2014\u201cnear\u201d and \u201cdistant\u201d alike\u2014remains under the unified control. Regional polities appear in the text only when we enter the calamitous age of the last Shang tyrant, Zhouxin \u7d02\u8f9b (d. ca. 1046 BCE). Then, rebellions by regional lords and the danger of political disintegration appear as important symptoms of the overall deterioration that eventually justified the overthrow of the Shang. The Rongchengshi insistence that a politically unified world is the only normative situation may explain why Chu remains outside the narrative. In the unified universal realm independent or semi-independent regional lords (such as the king of Chu) are just an aberration. Accordingly, the multi-state system that stands at the center of Xinian and which was the norm for centuries prior to the composition of Rongchengshi is glossed over altogether. Under the rule of sage kings, regional states play no role, nor is there any meaning for regional identities. In the political vision of Rongchengshi there is simply no place for the state of Chu."}, {"url": "http://zh.worldheritage.org/articles/King_Zhuang_of_Chu", "page_content": "World Heritage Encyclopedia\n\nThe World Heritage Encyclopedia is the largest and most comprehensive Encyclopedia ever compiled.

BCE) and was one of the so-called five hegemons (wuba \u4e94\u9738). His personal name was Mi Xiongl\u00fc \u8288\u718a\u4fb6 (also written \u718a\u5442 or \u718a\u65c5). The state of Chu is sometimes called Jing \u834a, and Xiongl\u00fc's posthumous title is also King Yan \u56b4\u738b.\n\nHe succeeded to the throne as son of King Mu \u695a\u7a46\u738b (r. 625-614). King Zhuang started his reign in a style of laissez-faire politics without much caring for the government. His advisors Wu Ju \u4f0d\u8209 and Su Cong \u8607\u5f9e opened him his eyes, so that he started restructuring the administration and strengthening the royal power with the support of Sunshu Ao \u5b6b\u53d4\u6556. The state took over the care for hydraulic works, dykes and dams, he built up a strong army and quelled the internal rebellion of a certain Ruo Ao \u82e5\u6556 (not King Ruo Ao, r. 791-764). His armies marched to the north, defeated the state of Song \u5b8b and the Rong \u620e barbarians of Luhun \u9678\u6e3e, and lined up before the domain of the king of Zhou \u5468.\n\nWith the awareness of his power King Zhuang of Chu menaced the King of Zhou and threatened him that Chu would be able to replace the house of Zhou. The armies of Chu then conquered a handfull of smaller states like Yong \u5eb8, Shu \u8212 and Chen \u9673, and in 602, King Zhuang was able to destroy the army of Jin \u6649 at Bi \u90b2 (modern Xingyang \u6ece\u967d, Henan).

King Zhuang had his concubine Xu Ji toast the ministers. In the evening, he ordered the court to light candles, and the singing and dancing continued.\n\nSuddenly a gust of wind blew out the candles. In the darkness, one of the drunken courtiers pulled on Xu Ji\u2019s clothing. In those days, no men were allowed in the palace unless they were castrated. Assaulting a concubine in this way was a serious offence. She pulled the tassel off of the courtier\u2019s hat and asked King Zhuang to deal with him. King Zhuang not only did not do anything about it but also said loudly that everyone should take their tassels off, relax and enjoy. After all the ministers had taken off their tassels, King Zhuang ordered the candles to be relit.\n\nXu Ji was both surprised and angry. When the banquet was over, she complained to the king. He replied, \u201cIt is excusable to be careless after drinking. If I were to condemn a minister to death over something like this, it would chill the hearts of other ministers, and they would not be able to do their best to defend the country.\u201d Nodding, Xu Ji listened, and agreed.\n\nThe minister was undoubtedly at fault for his drunken demeanor, but King Zhuang showed breadth of mind in the way he handled the incident. In time, he was repaid for his kindness.\n\nWhen King Zhuang was leading his troops to attack the state of Zheng, he was ambushed, and in a critical situation. Tang Cui, the vice general of the Chu army, single-handedly rushed into the enemy lines and rescued King Zhuang from the chaos. The King of Chu was very grateful and wanted to reward him.

His personal name was Xiong L\u00fc, ancestral name Mi (\u8288), and King Zhuang was his posthumous title. He became one of the Five Hegemons and attempted to wrest control of China from the king of Zhou.\n\nKing Zhuang ascended the throne in 613 BC at a time when the Kingdom of Chu was in disarray. For the first three years of his reign, Zhuang wasted time on excessive hunting and lavish partying. Several courtiers were anxious about the king but none dared speak up as he had given orders that anyone who challenged his authority would be killed. When a particularly senior minister challenged him through a riddle, the king responded that he had been waiting for three years for someone from his court to show some nationalistic pride.\n\nThe king made Sunshu Ao Chancellor and began a series of reforms. Chu's agricultural output improved significantly during his reign, aided by Sunshu Ao's comprehensive dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir created in modern-day northern Anhui province. In 611 BC he annexed the State of Yong (\u5eb8\u56fd), a move which made Chu much stronger.\n\nAfter some overwhelming victories at the head of his army, King Zhuang attempted to take the place of King Ding of Zhou. He asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the Nine Tripod Cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China at the time but was rebuffed.\n\nIn the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the State of Jin, another strong state at that time.

BCE) is the first part of the so-called Eastern Zhou period (Dongzhou \u6771\u5468, 770-221 BCE). It is characterized by a significant decrease of political power of the kings of Zhou which had to flee to the eastern capital Chengzhou \u6210\u5468 (or Luoyi \u96d2\u9091, modern Luoyang \u6d1b\u967d, Henan) after their western and main capital Zongzhou \u5b97\u5468 (of Feng \u8c50, near modern Xi'an \u897f\u5b89, Shaanxi) had been attacked by the nomad tribes of the Quanrong \u72ac\u620e.\n\nPeriodization\n\nThe name of the historical period is derived from the chronicle of the regional state of Lu \u9b6f called Chunqiu \u6625\u79cb \"Spring and Autumn Annals\" because the seasons are always mentioned in the entries. The Annals cover the time from 722 to 481 BCE, yet the historical period is traditionally counted from the reign of King Ping of Zhou \u5468\u5e73\u738b (r. 770-720 BCE), who restored the Zhou dynasty in Luoyang, down to the division of the state of Jin \u6649 by the regional rulers (zhuhou \u8af8\u4faf) of Han \u97d3, Wei \u9b4f and Zhao \u8d99 in 376. Alternatively, the end of the Spring and Autumn period can be seen as 453, when the three viscounts (zi \u5b50) of Han, Wei and Zhao extinguished all other lateral lines to the house of Jin, or 403, when King Weilie of Zhou \u5468\u5a01\u70c8\u738b (r. 426-402) bestowed upon the viscounts of Han, Wei and Zhao the title of marquis (hou \u4faf).\n\nThe second great historiographical writing of the Spring and Autumn period is the collection Guoyu \u570b\u8a9e \"Discourses of the states\" that includes anecdotes of the states of Zhou \u5468, Lu \u9b6f, Qi \u9f4a, Jin \u6649, Zheng \u912d, Chu \u695a, Wu \u5433 and Yue \u8d8a. Said to be a composition of Zuo Qiuming \u5de6\u4e18\u660e, its oldest parts must have been compiled at the end of the 5th century BCE.\n\nConfucius\n\nThe most important intellectual person of this historical period was the philosopher Confucius (Kongzi \u5b54\u5b50; ca. 551-479) who tried to revive the ideal of the human and righteous rulers of old. Although his ideas seemed lost in a time of political realism his thoughts about state and society (\"Confucianism\") were to become the fundamental doctrine of imperial China.\n\nThe Early Decades of the Eastern Zhou and the Duke of Zheng\n\nThe eastern capital Chengzhou (Luoyang) did not provide the kings of Zhou with sufficient power. They were therefore dependent on the powerful regional rulers, especially those of Qin \u79e6, Jin, Qi and Chu. These are called the \"local rulers\" (fang bo \u65b9\u4f2f) because they practically ruled independently from the king of Zhou, and not any more as his vassals. It became common that the regional states acted on their own behalf regarding territory and military feuds, without asking the king of Zhou for formal permission. Duke Zhuang of Zheng \u912d\u838a\u516c (r. 743-701) even dared attacking King Huan \u5468\u6853\u738b (r. 720-697 BCE) who had not treated him properly according to the ritual regulations. Heijian \u9ed1\u80a9, the Duke of Zhou \u5468\u516c, even planned to kill King Huan's successor, King Zhuang \u5468\u838a\u738b (r. 697-682), and to replace him with Prince Ke \u514b. Yet Xin Bo \u8f9b\u4f2f warned the king and saved his life.\n\nDuke Zhuang of Zheng defeated intruding Rong \u620e tribes and swallowed the neighbouring state of Xu \u8a31. In 707 King Huan of Zhou \u5468\u6853\u738b (r. 719-697) started a punitive expedition against the Duke, but the king was defeated. From then on, the kings of Zhou never again tried to intervene into the politics of their own regional rulers. They stayed in their small royal domain around Luoyang and had to be content with the tributes of the regional rulers that were presented less and less regularly. Besides Zheng, the states of Song \u5b8b and Lu \u9b6f demonstrated their military and political power in the Central Plain.\n\nThe Rise of Duke Huan of Qi\n\nKing Li \u5468\u91d0\u738b (r. 682-677) was so helpless against the new threats endangering the empire that he allowed Duke Huan of Qi \u9f4a\u6853\u516c (r. 685-643) to adopt the title of hegemonial lord (ba \u9738, or bo \u4f2f). In this function the Duke defended the regional states against raids of barbarian tribes and cared for law and order among the states of the Middle Kingdom, with the motto \"support the king and ward off the barbarians\" (zun wang rang yi \u5c0a\u738b\u6518\u5937).\n\nIn the east, the state of Qi had rich natural ressources and became one of the mightiest regional states of the Eastern Zhou period.\n\nDuke Huan of Qi employed the legalist statesman Guan Zhong \u7ba1\u4ef2 as his adviser who reorganized administration and the military and financial systems. Through these reforms Qi was able to subdue Song and Lu and even the hegemonial state of Zheng. At that time, the non-Chinese nomad tribes of the Rong and Di \u72c4 undertook raids on the soil of Chinese states and devastated the states of Xing \u90a2 and Wei \u885b (modern Shanxi and Hebei). Duke Huan of Qi rescued the dynastic houses of these states and settled them down more to the south. The system of the hegemon thus developed to a kind of lord protector of a strong state over weaker ones, and Qi promised to protect the states in the Central Plain against further intrusions of the northern nomad warriors.\n\nThe Semi-Barbarian Kingdom of Chu\n\nIn the south, the state of Chu on the middle Yangtze River had become politically stronger than before. King Cheng of Chu \u695a\u6210\u738b (r. 671-626) started to challenge the hegemony of Qi and swallowed smaller states in his neighbourhood. Nonetheless, subservient states like Jiang \u6c5f and Huang \u9ec3 changed side and declared their alliance with Qi. Chu thereupon attacked Zheng. Duke Huan assembled the regional rulers and created an alliance with Lu, Song, Chen and Wei to punish Chu in 656 by devastating the state of Cai \u8521, an ally of Chu. Chu gave in, and the ambassadors of the two mighty states met at Shaoling \u53ec\u9675 (modern Yancheng \u90fe\u57ce, Henan) to conclude a peaceful alliance (meng \u76df).\n\nThe System of Hegemonial Lordship\n\nIn 651 Qi organized a meeting at Kuiqiu \u8475\u4e18 (modern Lankao \u862d\u8003, Henan) whith the representatives of Lu, Song, Zheng and Wei, and in presence of a royal diplomat from Zhou. The members of the meeting decided that states creating a friendly alliance should never attack each other, and that they had to assist each other in case that one partner was attacked. The Duke of Qi thus became the overlord over the weaker states of Zhou China and replaced the king of Zhou as the highest judicial person.\n\nSuccession Crises at the Zhou Court\n\nWhen King Li died a succession crisis endangered the house of Zhou. His righteous heir was Prince Kan \u95ac, who is known as King Hui \u5468\u60e0\u738b (r. 677-652), but his late grandfather, King Zhuang, had had a favourite son called Prince Tui \u7a68. King Hui was not a very intelligent ruler. He offended many of his highest ministers and caused a rebellion that forced him to flee to Wen \u6eab (modern Wenxian \u6eab\u7e23, Henan) and then to Li \u6adf, a town in the state of Zheng. His uncle Prince Tui was made King of Zhou, but he did not prove a better ruler. He was therefore attacked and killed by the lords of Zheng and Guo \u8662. King Hui returned to the throne.\n\nWhen King Hui died he was succeeded by his son Prince Zheng \u912d, who is known as King Xiang \u5468\u8944\u738b (r. 652-619). King Xiang had a half-brother called Shudai \u53d4\u5e36 (or Dai \u5e36), who had been the favourite son of King Hui. Prince Shudai planned to usurp the throne and joined forces with the Rong and Di \u7fdf tribes. The plot failed and Prince Shudai fled to Qi. It was a high minister of Qi, the reformer Guan Zhong, who mediated the peace treaty between the house of Zhou and the Rong tribes. A decade later the king of Zhou even allowed Prince Shudai to return.\n\nWhen the state of Zheng attacked in 639 the statelet of Hua \u6ed1, whose lords were relatives to the house of Zhou, King Xiang sent You Sun \u6e38\u5b6b and Bo Fu \u4f2f\u670d as diplomats to negotiate peace. Yet the Duke of Zheng arrested the diplomats. The King thereupon ordered the Di tribes to attack Zheng, inspite of the remonstances of minister Fu Chen \u5bcc\u8fb0. Fu Chen was also not content with the King's will to marry a Di princess in order to reward the Di chieftain for his support. His critics were justified because only a few years later King Xiang discarded the \"barbarian\" queen, which caused an attack of the Di on the royal capital, during which the Earl of Tan \u8b5a (or the earls of Yuan \u539f and Mao \u6bdb) was/were killed. Fu Chen thereupon threw himself into battle against the intruders and died. King Xiang fled to Zheng and was received by the duke of Zheng, in spite of all former discrepancies.\n\nIn the meantime Prince Dai was enthroned as King of Zhou, yet he took residence in Wen, not in Luoyang. He invited the Di queen to return to the royal domain. Two years later King Xiang asked the duke of Jin for help, who willingly attacked the usurper and executed him. King Xiang, returning to the throne, rewarded Duke Wen of Jin \u6649\u6587\u516c (r. 636-628) with the title of hegemonial lord and presented him with some territory. Duke Wen was thereafter the most powerful political leader of the Middle Kingdom and assembled the regional rulers, including his formal superior, the King of Zhou, at Heyang \u6cb3\u967d and Jiantu \u8e10\u571f. The kings of Zhou were now wholly dependent from support by other political actors. Histories nevertheless concealed this shameful situation with terms like \"royal hunt at Heyang\".\n\nThe Rise of the Regional State of Jin\n\nAfter the death of Duke Huan of Qi several regional rulers strove for overlordship. Duke Xiang of Song \u5b8b\u8944\u516c (r. 650-637) was defeated by Chu, and the state of Song lost its last chance to rise to political and military significance. Instead, the state of Jin rose to supremacy in old China: Duke Xian of Jin \u6649\u737b\u516c (r. 676-651) had already extended the power of his state by swallowing the statelets of Geng \u803f, Huo \u970d, Wei \u9b4f (a state that was later one of the three destructors of Jin), Guo \u8662 and Yu \u865e. After a decade of inner struggles, the state of Qin supported Duke Wen of Jin in his ascension to the throne of Jin.\n\nJust as Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin employed political advisors, Zhao Shuai \u8d99\u8870 (Zhao Chengzi \u8d99\u6210\u5b50) and Hu Yan \u72d0\u5043, who strengthened the \"national\" economy and so the military power of the state. In 635 the King Xiang of Zhou escaped from inner disturbances to the state of Zheng. Duke Wen of Jin saw his chance, rescued the king and accompanied him back to the royal domain, for which support he was highly rewarded by the King.\n\nThe next step for the Duke was to challenge the power of the southern, semi-Chinese state of Chu that had dominated the Central Plain since the death of Duke Huan of Qi. In 632 the two states clashed at the battle of Chengpu \u57ce\u6fee (modern Zhencheng \u7504\u57ce, Shandong), and Chu was defeated. Duke Wen of Jin established a new friendly alliance during the meeting at Jiantu \u8e10\u571f (modern Yingze \u6ece\u6fa4, Henan) with the seven most important states. In the same year, at Wen, the King of Zhou sanctified the hegemony by Jin. Duke Wen's successor Duke Xiang \u6649\u8944\u516c (r. 627-621) was able to prolong the hegemonial prevalence of the state of Jin.\n\nConflict Between Qin and Jin\n\nDuring the reign of Duke Xiang of Jin, Duke Mu of Qin \u79e6\u7a46\u516c (r. 659-621) opened a long period of military confrontation between Jin and Qin, but Qin seldomly won any battle. The powerful state of Jin blocked the gate to the Central Plain, and Qin could not but expand its territory to the west into the territory of the Western Rong tribes \u897f\u620e and establish good relations with Chu in the south. Chu meanwhile further expanded its territory by conquering the statelets of Jiang \u6c5f, Lu \u516d (a special reading!), and Liao \u84fc. After the death of Duke Xiang of Jin, the noble Zhao Dun \u8d99\u76fe (Zhao Xuanzi \u8d99\u5ba3\u5b50) dominated the throne succession of Jin, murdered Duke Ling \u6649\u9748\u516c (r. 620-607) and enthroned Duke Cheng \u6649\u6210\u516c (r. 606-600). During this period Jin lost its initiative in \"foreign\" politics. The political advisor Fan Shan \u8303\u5c71 proposed to King Mu of Chu \u695a\u7a46\u738b (r. 625-614) to take the chance and to advance against the north.\n\nThe Rise of the State of Chu\n\nKing Zhuang of Chu \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 613-591) had to resolve internal quarrels and uprisings of aboriginal tribes before he was able to reform economic and military administration and to resume this expansion politics. In 606 the southern king sent out an envoy to the court of King Ding of Zhou \u5468\u5b9a\u738b (r. 606-586) to express his will to swallow the royal domain of Zhou. In 598 King Zhuang of Chu crushed the small state of Chen \u9673, one year later the state of Zheng. At the battle of Bi \u90b2 (near modern Zhengzhou \u912d\u5dde, Henan) the army of the hegemonial state of Jin was defeated.\n\nA few years later, Chu defeated the state of Song and finally obtained the overlordship over the Central Plain. The protecting task of the overlord had gradually lost its original intention and became a system of hegemony of one major state over weak satellites of Chinese and \"barbarian\" origin. The attitude to help small states during internal quarrels and against \"barbarian\" invaders changed to a regular intervention into political affairs to the advantage of the great states.\n\nInternal Quarrels in Jin\n\nThe state of Qi observed the growing power of Chu, declared a friendly relationship with the southern king of Chu, who was the only regional ruler who called himself king, except, of course, the King of Zhou. Qi repeatedly attacked the smaller states of Lu and Wei which therefore asked for support the former hegemonial state of Jin. In 589, the army of Jin fought with Qi in the battle of An \u978d (modern Jinan \u6fdf\u5357, Shandong) and once again demonstrated its superior military power. Chu instantly declared war to Jin, but neither Chu nor Jin dared to initiate a concrete campaign.\n\nAfter long years of hesitation and negotiations (under the stipulation of Jin's political advisor Song Huayuan \u5b8b\u83ef\u5143) Chu attacked Zheng and Wei in 576. One year later the armies of the two hegemonial states fought in the famous battle of Yanling \u9122\u9675 (modern Yanling, Henan) in which Jin prevailed by a narrow margin. Duke Li of Jin \u6649\u53b2\u516c (r. 580-573) saw his chance to resume hegemony, murdered his mightiest noblemen Xi Zhi \u90e4\u81f3, Xi Qi \u90e4\u9321 and Xi Chou \u90e4\u72a8 (the \"Three Xi\" \u4e09\u90e4). Yet instead of having strengthened his own position, Duke Li faced serious opposition by the Jin aristocracy like Luan Shu \u6b12\u66f8 and Xun Yan \u8340\u5043 who eventually killed their lord.\n\nUnder the next ruler, Duke Dao \u6649\u60bc\u516c (r. 572-558), the internal situation calmed down, and the duke was able to strengthen the position of the state of Jin. His political advisor Wei Jiang \u9b4f\u7d73 proposed to appease the nomad warriors of the Rong with financial tributes instead of fighting them. In 571 Jin erected a fortification wall at Hulao \u864e\u7262 (modern Fanshui \u6c3e\u6c34, Henan) against the state of Zheng that was backed by Chu.\n\nAfter more than two decades of relative peace the political advisor Song Xiangxu \u5b8b\u5411\u620c proposed to organize a peace conference to end military conflict. It was held in the capital of Jin in 546 and the participating fourteeen states decided to accept the overlordship of the two states of Jin and Chu. Their adherents had to declare their subjection under the respective overlordship and to present tributes to the two hegemons. Among the participating states, there would be ten years of peace, and for more than fourty years, Jin and Chu would not meet at the battle field again.\n\nOnly two of the larger states did not participate in the general peace: Qi, and Qin.\n\nThe old kingdom of Zhou had totally lost its political role. The tributes once paid to the kings of Zhou were now offered to the dukes of Jin and the kings of Chu. If a small state did not pay tribute it had to expect military sanctions. Especially precarious was the role of the state of Lu that had to maintain good relationships to the three states of Jin, Chu and Qi, if it did not want to be swallowed by one of them. Very similar was the role of Zheng that was directly in the line of fire between Jin and Chu. But states like Lu also imitated the overlordship of their own masters and demanded tributes from yet smaller states like Teng \u6ed5, Qi \u675e or Zeng \u912b.\n\nThe Rise of the Semi-Barbarian States of Wu and Yue\n\nDuring the relatively peaceful sixth century, the two southern non-Chinese coastal states of Wu \u5433 and Yue \u8d8a emerged as new powers. Jin saw its chance to open a second flank against Chu, and in 583 Duke Wuchen of Shen \u7533\u516c\u5deb\u81e3 was sent to Wu in order to seek a military alliance. The semi-barbarian state of Wu was equipped with military tools and Wu soldiers were trained to attack Chu. But it was only more than half a century later that Wu became a serious threat to Chu after swallowing the statelet of Xu \u5f90.\n\nUnder King Hel\u00fc \u95d4\u95ad (r. 514-496) the political advisor Wu Yuan \u4f0d\u54e1 proposed to raise three armies that clockwise were to skirmish at the borders of Chu to weaken this state. In 506 the whole army of Wu finally attacked Chu and defeated this state at Baiju or Boju \u67cf\u8209 (modern Macheng \u9ebb\u57ce, Hubei). In pursuit of the escaping enemy, the army of Wu advanced to the capital of Chu, Yingdu \u90e2\u90fd (modern Jiangling \u6c5f\u9675, Hebei). King Zhao of Chu \u695a\u662d\u738b (r. 516-489) had to take his flight and sought for help in Qin. This western state sent out chariots that expelled the invaders from Wu.\n\nWu's neighbour Yue took the advantage of the prolonged campaigns against Chu to invade Wu. In 496, Wu set its troops into march to carry out a punitive expedition against Yue, but King Hel\u00fc died in the battle of Zuili \u6a87\u674e (modern Jiaxing \u5609\u8208, Zhejiang). Two years later, King Fucha \u592b\u5dee of Wu (r. 495-473) defeated Yue during the revenge battle of Fujiao \u592b\u6912 (modern Suzhou \u8607\u5dde, Jiangsu). Goujian \u53e5\u8e10, king of Yue (r. 496-465), fled to Mount Guiji \u6703\u7a3d\u5c71 (south of modern Shaoxing \u7d39\u8208, Zhejiang).\n\nAlthough Fucha's advisor Wu Yuan proposed to destroy the state of Yue, the king of Wu was content with his success in battle and the destruction of the capital of Yue. After the defeat of Chu and Yue, King Fucha turned his attention to the north. He had a fortification wall built at Han \u9097 (near modern Yangzhou \u63da\u5dde, Jiangsu) and dug out canals (see Grand Canal) that connected the Yangtze River with the Huai River \u6dee\u6c34 valley, creating a traffic line to the north and the possibility to move troops faster. The small states of Lu and Zhu \u90be declared themselves subjects to Wu. In the years 485 and 484 Wu attacked several times the state of Qi by land and by river and finally defeated Qi in the battle of Ailing \u827e\u9675 (modern Laiwu \u840a\u856a, Shandong). Wu assembled the states of the Central Plain to a meeting at Huangchi \u9ec3\u6c60 (modern Fengqiu \u5c01\u4e18, Henan), with the intention to declare its hegemony. Jin, weakened by internal struggles, did not dare to challenge the new powerful state of Wu, and King Fucha became the new hegemon.\n\nJust during the conference of Huangchi, King Goujian of Yue took the chance and invaded the capital of Wu. The overstretched military power of the state of Wu was unable to withstand the southern opponent who had rebuilt its strength after the defeat of Guiji. In 473, Yue destroyed the state of Wu and replaced it as the dominating power of the southeast. King Goujian of Yue was the last of the so-called Five Hegemons (Wuba \u4e94\u9738).\n\nThe Five Hegemons are also called the \"Five Earls\" (Wubo \u4e94\u4f2f). Different literary sources and commentaries identify them with different persons. The traditional definition by Zhao Qi \u8d99\u5c90 defines them as Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin, Duke Mu of Qin, Duke Xiang of Song, and King Zhuang of Chu. The book Xunzi \u8340\u5b50 identifies them with Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin, King Zhuang of Chu, King Hel\u00fc of Wu and King Goujian of Yue.\n\nThe Disintegration of the Old Order of Regional States\n\nIn the mid-5th century BCE there were four states that dominated old China: Chu in the south, Yue in the southwest, Jin in the north, and Qi in the east. Yet things were to change soon: Inner conflicts toppled two of the reigning houses (Jin and Qi), new powers emerged (Wei \u9b4f, Zhao \u8d99 and Han \u97d3), and reforms in the administration of several states created a new type of \"modernized\" regional state: the centralized state with a strengthened \"national\" economy and a professional army. The administration of the state by nobles related to the ruling house was replaced by a bureaucratic officialdom.\n\nThe state Lu was the first that felt the power of noble families which challenged the ducal house, in this case the Three Huan (Sanhuan \u4e09\u6853, descendants of Duke Huan \u9b6f\u6853\u516c) the Jisun \u5b63\u5b6b, Mengsun \u5b5f\u5b6b (Zhongsun \u4ef2\u5b6b) and Shusun \u53d4\u5b6b. From the time of Duke Xi \u9b6f\u50d6\u516c (r. 659-627) on these three noble families dominated the state of Lu. Duke Zhao \u9b6f\u662d\u516c (r. 541-510) even had to escape from their intrigues and died abroad. At the beginning of the fifth century minor nobles like Nan Kuai \u5357\u84af, Yang Hu \u967d\u864e and Hou Fan \u4faf\u72af rebelled against the mighty families and took over the rule of Lu.\n\nDescendants of the dukes of Song fought for the domination within the small state: the families Hua \u83ef, Yue \u6a02, Lao \u8001, Huang \u7687 (descendants of Duke Dai \u5b8b\u6234\u516c, r. 799-766), Yu \u9b5a, Dang \u8569, Lin \u9c57 and Xiang \u5411 (descendants of Duke Huan \u5b8b\u6853\u516c, r. 681-651). In the permanent power struggles only the families Yue and Huang survived the Spring and Autumn period.\n\nThe seven descendant lineages of Duke Mu of Zheng \u912d\u7a46\u516c (r. 627-606) also gradually lost their power in the course of the Spring and Autum period.\n\nIn the state of Qi, the government was led by the lineages of Guo \u570b, Gao \u9ad8, Cui \u5d14 and Qing \u6176. In this state it was a family not related to the ducal house that took over power in Qi: the family Tian \u7530, descendants of a prince from Chen, Tian Jingzhong \u7530\u656c\u4ef2, who had come to Qi in 672 while escaping internal disturbances in Chen. Under Duke Jing \u9f4a\u666f\u516c (r. 547-490), Jingzhong's descendant Tian Qi \u7530\u4e5e was ennobled and from this position collected wealth and power enough to annihilate the families Guo and Gao. His son Tian Chang \u7530\u5e38 was already wealthier than the Duke himself and sent his ambassadors to the neighbouring states. His descendants would eventually replace the reigning house in Qi.\n\nThe most tremendous power challenge from within took place in the state of Jin where descendants of the ducal line were not invested as regional governors (dafu \u5927\u592b). But this measure did not prevent other noble families from trying to dominate the court of Jin: Hu \u72d0, Zhao \u8d99, Xian \u5148, Xi \u90e4 and Xu \u80e5 were the dominating noble clans of the middle Spring and Autumn period, and were later replaced by the families Han \u97d3, Wei \u9b4f, Luan \u6b12, Fan \u8303 and Xun \u8340. At the beginning of the 5th century the noble families of Zhao, Wei, Han, Fan, Zhonghang \u4e2d\u884c and Zhi \u667a survived the internal struggle. The three first could destroy the last three and dissolved the dukedom of Jin, dividing its territory among themselves.\n\nDuring the reign of King Ding of Zhou \u5468\u5b9a\u738b (r. 607-586), the southern ruler King Zhuang of Chu \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 613-591) advanced his armies as far as the valley of River Luo in the pursuit of the Rong tribes of Luhun \u9678\u6e3e. The king of Chu used this situation pay the king of Zhou a visit, but King Ding only sent Prince Man \u6eff (\"Royal Grandson Man\" \u738b\u5b6b\u6eff) to confer with the semi-barbarian king of Chu. They talked about the so-called \"nine tripods\" (jiuding \u4e5d\u9f0e) erected in the capital that symbolized the nine regions of the kingdom of Zhou.\n\nAfter the death of King Ling of Zhou \u5468\u9748\u738b (r. 572-545) and during the reign of King Jing \u5468\u666f\u738b (r. 545-521) a succession crisis beset the house of Zhou. The heir apparent, Prince Sheng \u8056, had died prematurely. King Jing preferred his oldest son Prince Chao \u671d, yet when the king died, Prince Gai \u4e10 was supported by a strong party among the courtiers. The highest ministers enthroned Prince Meng \u731b, who was immediately attacked and killed by the adherents of Prince Chao. Prince Meng is posthumously known as King Dao \u5468\u60bc\u738b (r. 521-520). Prince Chao proclaimed himself king of Zhou, yet Prince Gai on his side asked for support by the duke of Jin and finally made it to the throne. He is known as King Jing \u5468\u656c\u738b (r. 520-476). Prince Chao, who had reigned for four years, fled to Chu. In 504, when he had assembled a sufficient number of supporters, he attacked King Jing and forced him to flee to Jin. A year later Duke Ding of Jin \u6649\u5b9a\u516c (r. 512-475) helped King Jing back on the throne."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/zhuangzi-chuang-tzu", "page_content": "ZHUANGZI (CHUANG TZU)\n\nChinese philosopher, contemporary of mengzi (Mencius); b. c. 370; d. c. 285 b.c.

Zhuangzi declined the invitation, preferring to live simply in a small village and discuss philosophy with his disciples and friends. The Book of Zhuangzi, written by his disciples, had 52 chapters, but only 33 are extant. His teachings on cosmology, ethics, and politics are similar to those of laozi (Lao Tz\u016d). He taught that all values are relative and that all extremes will eventually meet because they are really different aspects of the same unique reality.

According to traditional dating, Master Zhuang, to whom the first seven chapters of the text have traditionally been attributed, was an almost exact contemporary of the Confucian thinker Mencius, but we have no record of direct philosophical dialogue between them. The text is ranked among the greatest of literary and philosophical masterpieces that China has produced. Its style is complex\u2014mythical, poetic, narrative, humorous, indirect, and polysemic.\n\nMuch of the text espouses a holistic philosophy of life, encouraging disengagement from the artificialities of socialization, and cultivation of our natural \u201cancestral\u201d potencies and skills, in order to live a simple and natural, but full and flourishing life. It is critical of our ordinary categorizations and evaluations, noting the multiplicity of different modes of understanding between different creatures, cultures, and philosophical schools, and the lack of an independent means of making a comparative evaluation. It advocates a mode of understanding that is not committed to a fixed system, but is fluid and flexible, and that maintains a provisional, pragmatic attitude towards the applicability of these categories and evaluations.\n\nThe Zhuangzi text is an anthology, in which several distinctive strands of Daoist thought can be recognized. The Jin dynasty thinker and commentator, Guo Xiang (Kuo Hsiang, d. 312 CE), edited and arranged an early collection, and reduced what had been a work in fifty-two chapters down to thirty-three chapters, excising material that he considered to be repetitious or spurious. The versions of Daoist philosophy expressed in this text were highly influential in the reception, interpretation, and transformation of Buddhist philosophies in China.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Historical Background\n\nAccording to the Han dynasty historian, Sima Qian, Zhuangzi was born during the Warring States (403-221 BCE), more than a century after the death of Confucius. During this time, the ostensibly ruling house of Zhou had lost its authority, and there was increasing violence between states contending for imperial power. This situation gave birth to the phenomenon known as the baijia, the hundred schools: the flourishing of many schools of thought, each articulating its own conception of a return to a state of harmony. The first and most significant of these schools was that of Confucius, who became the chief representative of the Ruists (Confucians), the scholars and propagators of the wisdom and culture of the tradition. Their great rivals were the Mohists, the followers of Mozi (\u201cMaster Mo\u201d), who were critical of what they perceived to be the elitism and extravagance of the traditional culture. The archaeological discovery at Guo Dian in 1993 of an early Laozi manuscript suggests that the philosophical movement associated with the text also began to emerge during this period. The strands of Daoist philosophy expressed in the earliest strata of the Zhuangzi developed within a context infused with the ideas of these three schools. Master Zhuang is usually taken to be the author of the first seven chapters, but in recent years a few scholars have found reason to be skeptical not just of his authorship of any of the text, but also of his very existence.\n\nAccording to early evidence compiled by Sima Qian, Zhuangzi was born in a village called Meng, in the state of Song; according to Lu Deming, the Sui-Tang dynasty scholar, the Pu River in which Zhuangzi was said to have fished was in the state of Chen which, as Wang Guowei points out, had become a territory of the southern state of Chu. We might say that Zhuangzi was situated in the borderlands between Chu, centered around the Yangzi River, and the central plains\u2014which centered around the Yellow River and which were the home of the Shang and Zhou cultures. Some scholars, especially in China, maintain that there is a connection between the philosophies of the Daoist texts and the culture of Chu. The diversity of regions and cultures in early China has increasingly been acknowledged, and most interest has been directed to the state of Chu, in large part because of the wealth of archaeological evidence that is being unearthed there. As one develops a sensitivity for the culture of Chu, one senses deep resonances with the aesthetic sensibility of the Daoists, and with Zhuangzi\u2019s style in particular. The silks and bronzes of Chu, for example, are rich and vibrant; the patterns and images on fabrics and pottery are fanciful and naturalistic. However, while the evidence is persuasive, it is far from decisive.\n\nIf the traditional dating is reliable, then Zhuangzi would have been an almost exact contemporary of the Ruist thinker Mencius, though there is no clear evidence of communication between them. There are a few remarks in the Zhuangzi that could possibly be alluding to Mencius\u2019 philosophy, but there is nothing in the Mencius that shows any interest in Zhuangzi. The philosopher and statesman Hui Shi, or Huizi (\u201cMaster Hui,\u201d 380-305 BCE), is represented as a close friend of Zhuangzi, though decidedly unconvinced by his philosophical musings. There appears to have been a friendly rivalry between the broad and mythic-minded Zhuangzi and the politically motivated Huizi, who is critiqued in the text as a shortsighted paradox-monger. Despite their very deep philosophical distance, and Huizi\u2019s perceived limitations, Zhuangzi expresses great appreciation both for his linguistic abilities and for his friendship. The other \u201clogician,\u201d Gongsun Longzi, would also have been a contemporary of Zhuangzi, and although Zhuangzi does not, unfortunately, engage in any direct philosophical discussion with him, one does find what appears to be an occasional wink in his direction.\n\n2. The Zhuangzi Text\n\nThe currently extant text known as the Zhuangzi is the result of the editing and arrangement of the Jin dynasty thinker and commentator Guo Xiang (Kuo Hsiang, d. 312 CE). He reduced what was then a work in fifty-two chapters to the current edition of thirty-three chapters, excising material that he considered to be spurious. His commentary on the text provides an interpretation that has been one of the most influential over the subsequent centuries.\n\nGuo Xiang\u2019s thirty-three chapter edition of the text is divided into three collections, known as the Inner Chapters (Neipian), the Outer Chapters (Waipian), and the Miscellaneous Chapters (Zapian). The Inner Chapters are the first seven chapters and are generally considered to be the work of Zhuangzi himself. Because the evidence for this attribution is sparse and because of the miscellaneous nature of the editing, some scholars (McCraw, Klein) express skepticism that we can be sure which were the earliest passages or who they were written by. The Outer Chapters are chapters 8 to 22, and the Miscellaneous Chapters are chapters 23 to 33. The Outer and Miscellaneous Chapters can be further subdivided into different strands of Daoist thought. Much modern research has been devoted to a sub-classification of these chapters according to philosophical school. Kuan Feng made some scholarly breakthroughs early in the twentieth century; A. C. Graham continued his classification in the tradition of Kuan Feng. Harold Roth has also taken up a consideration of this issue and come up with some very interesting results. What follows is a simplified version of the results of the research of Liu Xiaogan.\n\nAccording to Liu, chapters 17 to 27 and 32 can be considered to be the work of a school of Zhuangzi\u2019s followers, what he calls the Shu Zhuang Pai, or the \u201cTransmitter\u201d school. Graham, following Kuan Feng, considers chapters 22 to 27 and 32 not to be coherent chapters, but merely random \u201cragbag\u201d collections of fragments. In fact, this miscellaneous character is characteristic of many, if not most, of the rest of the chapters, and complicates any simplistic classification of chapters as a whole. Liu considers chapters 8 to 10, chapters 28 to 31, and the first part of chapter 11 to be from a school of Anarchists whose philosophy is closely related to that of Laozi. Graham, again following Kuan Feng, sees these as two separate but related schools: the first he attributes to a writer he calls the \u201cPrimitivist,\u201d the second he considers to be a school of followers of Yang Zhu. Liu classifies chapters 12 to 16, chapter 33, and the first part of chapter 11 as belonging to the Han dynasty school known as Huang-Lao. Graham refers to them as the Syncretist chapters. Graham finds the classification of chapter 16 to be problematic. Chapter 30 does not seem to have any distinctively Daoist content at all. Though Graham thinks that it is consistent with the Yangist emphasis on preserving life, it is also consistent with Confucian and Mohist critiques of aggression.\n\nIn the following chart the further to the right the chapters are listed, the further away they are from the central ideas of the Zhuangzian philosophy of the Inner Chapters:\n\nThe Inner Chapters School of Zhuang Anarchist Utopianism Huang-Lao Syncretism 1.

Central Concepts in the \u201cInner Chapters\u201d\n\nThe following is an account of the central ideas of Zhuangzian philosophy, going successively through each of the seven Inner Chapters. This discussion is not confined to the content of the particular chapters, but rather represents a fuller articulation of the inter-relationships of the ideas between the Inner Chapters, and also between these ideas and those expressed in the Outer and Miscellaneous Chapters, where these appear to be related. References to \u201cZhuangzi\u201d below should not be taken as referring to a historical person, but rather as shorthand for the overall philosophy as articulated in the text of the Inner Chapters and related passages.\n\na. Chapter 1: Xiao Yao You (Wandering Beyond)\n\nThe title of the first chapter of the Zhuangzi has also been translated as \u201cFree and Easy Wandering\u201d and \u201cGoing Rambling Without a Destination.\u201d Both of these reflect the sense of the Daoist who is in spontaneous accord with the natural world, and who has retreated from the anxieties and dangers of social life, in order to live a healthy and peaceful natural life. In modern Mandarin, the word xiaoyao has thus come to mean \u201cfree, at ease, leisurely, spontaneous.\u201d It conveys the impression of people who have given up the hustle and bustle of worldly existence and have retired to live a leisurely life outside the city, perhaps in the natural setting of the mountains.\n\nBut this everyday expression is lacking a deeper significance that is expressed in the classical Chinese phrase: the sense of distance, or going beyond. As with all Zhuangzi\u2019s images, this is to be understood metaphorically. The second word, \u2018yao,\u2019 means \u2018distance\u2019 or \u2018beyond,\u2019 and here implies going beyond the boundaries of familiarity. We ordinarily confine ourselves within our social roles, expectations, and values, and with our everyday understandings of things. But this, according to Zhuangzi, is inadequate for a deeper appreciation of the natures of things, and for a more successful mode of interacting with them. We need at the very least to undo preconceptions that prevent us from seeing things and events in new ways; we need to see how we can structure and restructure the boundaries of things. But we can only do so when we ourselves have \u2018wandered beyond\u2019 the boundaries of the familiar. It is only by freeing our imaginations to reconceive ourselves, and our worlds, and the things with which we interact, that we may begin to understand the deeper tendencies of the natural transformations by which we are all affected, and of which we are all constituted. By loosening the bonds of our fixed preconceptions, we bring ourselves closer to an attunement to the potent and productive natural way (dao) of things.\n\nPaying close attention to the textual associations, we see that wandering is associated with the word wu, ordinarily translated \u2018nothing,\u2019 or \u2018without.\u2019 Related associations include: wuyou (no \u2018something\u2019) and wuwei (no interference). Roger Ames and David Hall have commented extensively on these wu expressions. Most importantly, they are not to be understood as simple negations, but have a much more complex function. The significance of all of these expressions must be traced back to the wu of Laozi: a type of negation that does not simply negate, but places us in a new kind of relation to \u2018things\u2019\u2014a phenomenological waiting that allows them to manifest, one that acknowledges the space that is the possibility of their coming to presence, one that appreciates the emptiness that is the condition of the possibility of their capacity to function, to be useful (as the hollow inside a house makes it useful for living). The behavior of one who wanders beyond becomes wuwei: sensitive and responsive without fixed preconceptions, without artifice, responding spontaneously in accordance with the unfolding of the inter-developing factors of the environment of which one is an inseparable part.\n\nBut it is not just the crossing of horizontal boundaries that is at stake. There is also the vertical distance that is important: one rises to a height from which formerly important distinctions lose what appeared to be their crucial significance. Thus arises the distinction between the great and the small, or the Vast (da) and the petty (xiao). Of this distinction Zhuangzi says that the petty cannot come up to the Vast: petty understanding that remains confined and defined by its limitations cannot match Vast understanding, the expansive understanding that wanders beyond. Now, while it is true that the Vast loses sight of distinctions noticed by the petty, it does not follow that they are thereby equalized, as Guo Xiang suggests. For the Vast still embraces the petty in virtue of its very vastness. The petty, precisely in virtue of its smallness, is not able to reciprocate.\n\nNow, the Vast that goes beyond our everyday distinctions also thereby appears to be useless. A soaring imagination may be wild and wonderful, but it is extremely impractical and often altogether useless. Indeed, Huizi, Zhuangzi\u2019s friend and philosophical foil, chides him for this very reason. But Zhuangzi expresses disappointment in him: for his inability to sense the use of this kind of uselessness is a kind of blindness of the spirit. The useless has use, only not as seen on the ordinary level of practical affairs. It has a use in the cultivation and nurturing of the \u2018shen\u2018 (spirit), in protecting the ancestral and preserving one\u2019s life, so that one can last out one\u2019s natural years and live a flourishing life. Now, this notion of a flourishing life is not to be confused with a \u2018successful\u2019 life: Zhuangzi is not impressed by worldly success. A flourishing life may indeed look quite unappealing from a traditional point of view. One may give up social ambition and retire in relative poverty to tend to one\u2019s shen and cultivate one\u2019s xing (nature, or life potency).\n\nTo summarize: When we wander beyond, we leave behind everything we find familiar, and explore the world in all its unfamiliarity. We drop the tools that we have been taught to use to tame the environment, and we allow it to teach us without words. We imitate its spontaneous behavior and we learn to respond immediately without fixed articulations.\n\nb. Chapter 2: Qi Wu Lun (Discussion on Smoothing Things Out)\n\nIf the Inner Chapters form the core of the Zhuangzi collection, then the Qi Wu Lun may be thought of as forming the core of the Inner Chapters. It is, at any rate, the most complex and intricate of the chapters of the Zhuangzi, with allusions and allegories, highly condensed arguments, and baffling metaphors juxtaposed without explanation. It appears to be concerned with the deepest and most \u2018abstract\u2019 understanding of ourselves, our lives, our world, our language, and indeed of our understanding itself. The most perplexing sections concern language and judgment, and are filled with paradox, sometimes even contradiction. But the contradictions are not easy to dismiss: their context indicates that they have a deep significance. In part, they appear to attempt to express an understanding about the limits of understanding itself, about the limits of language and thought.\n\nThis creates a problem for the interpreter, and especially for the translator. How do we deal with the contradictions? The most common solution is to paraphrase them so as to remove the direct contradictoriness, under the presupposition that no sense can be made of a contradiction. The most common way to remove the contradictions is to insert references to points of view. Those translators, such as A. C. Graham, who do this are following the interpretation of the Jin dynasty commentator Guo Xiang, who presents the philosophy as a form of relativism: apparently opposing judgments can harmonized when it is recognized that they are made from different perspectives.\n\nAccording to Guo Xiang\u2019s interpretation, each thing has its own place, its own nature (ziran); and each thing has its own value that follows from its own nature. If so, then nothing should be judged by values appropriate to the natures of other things. According to Guo Xiang, the vast and the small are equal in significance: this is his interpretation of the word \u201cqi\u201d in the title, \u201cequalization of all viewpoints\u201d. Now, such a radical relativism may have the goal of issuing a fundamental challenge to the status quo, arguing that the established values have no more validity than any of the minority values, no matter how shocking they may seem to us. In this way, its effect would be one of destabilization of the social structure. Here, however, we see another of the possible consequences of such a position: its inherent conservativeness. Guo Xiang\u2019s purpose in asserting this radical uniqueness and necessity of each position is conservative in this way. Indeed, it appears to be articulated precisely in response to those who oppose the traditional Ruist values of humanity and rightness (ren and yi) by claiming to have a superior mystical ground from which to judge them to be lacking. Guo Xiang\u2019s aim in asserting the equality of every thing, every position, and every function, is to encourage each thing, and each person, to accept its own place in the hierarchical system, to acknowledge its value in the functioning of the whole. In this way, radical relativism actually forestalls the possibility of radical critique altogether!\n\nAccording to this reading, the Vast perspective of the giant Peng bird is no better than the petty perspectives of the little birds who laugh at it. And indeed, Guo Xiang, draws precisely this conclusion. But there is a problem with taking this reading too seriously, and it is the kind of problem that plagues all forms of radical relativism when one attempts to follow them through consistently. Simply put, Zhuangzi would have to acknowledge that his own position is no better than those he appears to critique. He would have to acknowledge that his Daoist philosophy, indeed even this articulation of relativism, is no improvement over Confucianism after all, and that it is no less short-sighted than the logic-chopping of the Mohists. This, however, is a consequence that Zhuangzi does not recognize. This is surely an indication that the radical relativistic interpretation is clearly a misreading.\n\nRecently, some western interpreters (Lisa Raphals and Paul Kjellberg, for example) have focused their attention on aspects of the text that express affinities with the Hellenistic philosophy of Skepticism. Now, it is important not to confuse this with what in modern philosophy is thought of as a doctrine of skepticism, the most common form of which is the claim that we cannot ever claim to know anything, for at least the reason that we might always be wrong about anything we claim to know\u2014that is, because we can never know anything with absolute certainty. This is not quite the claim of the ancient Skeptics. Arguing from a position of fallibilism, these latter feel that we ought never to make any final judgments that go beyond the immediate evidence, or the immediate appearances. We should simply accept what appears at face value and have no further beliefs about its ultimate consequences, or its ultimate value. In particular, we should refrain from making judgments about whether it is good or bad for us. We bracket (epoche) these ultimate judgments. When we see that such things are beyond our ability to know with certainty, we will learn to let go of our anxieties and accept the things that happen to us with equanimity. Such a state of emotional tranquility they call \u2018ataraxia.\u2019\n\nNow, the resonances with Zhuangzi\u2019s philosophy are clear. Zhuangzi also accepts a form of fallibilism. While he does not refrain from making judgments, he nevertheless acknowledges that we cannot be certain that what we think of as good for us may not ultimately be bad for us, or that what we now think of as something terrible to be feared (death, for example) might not be an extraordinarily blissful awakening and a release from the toils and miseries of worldly life. When we accept this, we refrain from dividing things into the acceptable and the unacceptable; we learn to accept the changes of things in all their aspects with equanimity. In the Skeptical reading, the textual contradictions are also resolved by appealing to different perspectives from which different judgments appear to be true. Once one has learnt how to shift easily between the perspectives from which such different judgments can be made, then one can see how such apparently contradictory things can be true at the same time\u2014and one no longer feels compelled to choose between them.\n\nThere is, however, another way to resolve these contradictions, one that involves recognizing the importance of continuous transformation between contrasting phenomena and even between opposites. In the tradition of Laozi\u2019s cosmology, Zhuangzi\u2019s worldview is also one of seasonal transformations of opposites. The world is seen as a giant clod (da kuai) around which the heavens (tian) revolve about a polar axis (daoshu). All transformations have such an axis, and the aim of the sage is to settle into this axis, so that one may observe the changes without being buffeted around by them.\n\nNow, the theme of opposites is taken up by the Mohists, in their later Mohist Canon, but with a very different understanding. The later Mohists present a detailed analysis of judgments as requiring bivalence: that is judgments may be acceptable (ke) (also, \u2018affirmed\u2019 shi) or unacceptable (buke) (also \u2018rejected\u2019fei); they must be one or the other and they cannot be both. There must always be a clear distinction between the two. It is to this claim, I believe, that Zhuangzi is directly responding. Rejecting also the Mohist style of discussion, he appeals to an allusive, aphoristic, mythological style of poetic writing to upset the distinctions and blur the boundaries that the Mohists insist must be held apart. The Mohists believe that social harmony can only be achieved when we have clarity of distinctions, especially of evaluative distinctions: true/false, good/bad, beneficial/harmful. Zhuangzi\u2019s position is that this kind of sharp and rigid thinking can result ultimately only in harming our natural tendencies (xing), which are themselves neither sharp nor rigid. If we, on the contrary, learn to nurture those aspects of our heart-minds (xin), our natural tendencies (xing), that are in tune with the natural (tian) and ancestral (zong) within us, then we will eventually find our place at the axis of the way (daoshu) and will be able to ride the transformations of the cosmos free from harm. That is, we will be able to sense and respond to what can only be vaguely expressed without forcing it into gross and unwieldy verbal expressions. We are then able to recognize the paradoxes of vagueness and indeterminacy that arise from infinitesimal processes of transformation.\n\nPut another way, our knowledge and understanding (zhi, tong, da) are not just what we can explicitly see before us and verbalize: in modern terms, they are not just what is \u2018consciously,\u2019 \u2018conceptually,\u2019 or \u2018linguistically\u2019 available to us. Zhuangzi also insists on a level of understanding that goes beyond such relatively crude modes of dividing up our world and experiences. There are hidden modes of knowing, not evident or obviously present, modes that allow us to live, breathe, move, understand, connect with others without words, read our environments through subtle signs; these modes of knowing also give us tremendous skill in coping with others and with our environments. These modes of knowing Zhuangzi calls \u201cwuzhi\u201d, literally \u2018without knowing,\u2019 or \u2018unknowing\u2019. What is known by such modes of knowing, when we attempt to express it in words, becomes paradoxical and appears contradictory. It seems that bivalent distinctions leave out too much on either side of the divide: they are too crude a tool to cope with the subtlety and complexity of our non-conceptual modes of knowing. Zhuangzi, following a traditional folk psychology of his time, calls this capacity shenming: \u201cspirit insight.\u201d\n\nWhen we nurture that deepest and most natural, most ancestral part of our pysches, through psycho-physical meditative practices, we at the same time nurture these non-cognitive modes of understanding, embodied wisdoms, that enable us to deal successfully with our circumstances. It is then that we are able to cope directly with what from the limited perspective of our \u2018socialized\u2019 and \u2018linguistic\u2019 understanding seems to be too vague, too open, too paradoxical.\n\nc. Chapter 3: Yang Sheng Zhu (The Principle of Nurturing Life)\n\nThis chapter, like the Anarchist Utopian chapters, deals with the way to nurture and cultivate one\u2019s \u2018life tendencies\u2019 (sheng, xing) so as to enable one to live skillfully and last out one\u2019s natural years (zhong qi tian nian). There is a \u2018potency\u2019 within oneself that is a source of longevity, an ancestral place from which the phenomena of one\u2019s life continue to arise. This place is to be protected (bao), kept whole (quan), nurtured and cultivated (yang). The result is a sagely and skillful life. We must be careful how we understand this word, \u2018skill.\u2019 Zhuangzi takes pains to point out that it is no mere technique. A technique is a procedure that may be mastered, but the skill of the sage goes beyond this. One might say that it has become an \u2018art,\u2019 a dao. With Zhuangzi\u2019s conception, any physical activity, whether butchering a carcass, making wooden wheels, or carving beautiful ceremonial bell stands, becomes a dao when it is performed in a spiritual state of heightened awareness (\u2018attenuation\u2019 xu).\n\nZhuangzi sees civic involvement as particularly inimical to the preservation and cultivation of one\u2019s natural life. In order to cultivate one\u2019s natural potencies, one must retreat from social life, or at least one must retreat from the highly complex and artificially structured social life of the city. One undergoes a psycho-physical training in which one\u2019s sensory and physical capacities become honed to an extraordinary degree, indicating one\u2019s attunement with the transformations of nature, and thus highly responsive to the tendencies (xing) of all things, people, and processes. The mastery achieved is demonstrated (both metaphorically, and literally) by practical embodied skill. That is, practical embodied skill is also a metaphor representing the mastery of the life of the sage, and so it is also a sign of sagehood (though not all those who are skillful are to be reckoned as sages). Thus, we see many examples of individuals who have achieved extraordinary levels of excellence in their achievements\u2014practical, aesthetic, and spiritual. Butcher Ding provides an example of a practical, and very lowly skill; Liezi\u2019s teacher, Huzi, in chapter 7, provides an example of skill in controlling the very forces responsible for life themselves. Chapter 19, Mastering Life, is replete with examples: a cicada catcher, a ferryman, a carpenter, a swimmer, and Woodcarver Qing, whose aesthetic skill reaches \u2018magical\u2019 heights.\n\nd. Chapter 4: Ren Jian Shi (The Realm of Human Interactions)\n\nIn this chapter, Zhuangzi continues the theme broached in the last chapter, but now takes on the problem of how to maintain and preserve one\u2019s life and last out one\u2019s years while living in the social realm, especially in circumstances of great danger: a life of civic engagement in a time of social corruption.\n\nThe Daoists, especially the authors of the anarchistic utopian chapters, are highly critical of the artificiality required to create and sustain complex social structures. The Daoists are skeptical of the ability of deliberate planning to deal with the complexities of the world within which our social structures have their place. Even the developments of the social world when left to themselves are \u2018natural\u2019 developments, and as such escape the confines of planned, structured thinking. The more we try to control and curtail these natural meanderings, the more complicated and unwieldy the social structures become. According to the Daoists, no matter how complex we make our structures, they will never be fully able to cope with the fluid flexibility of natural changes. The Daoists perceive the unfolding of the transformations of nature as exhibiting a kind of natural intelligence, a wisdom that cannot be matched by deliberate artificial thinking, thinking that can be articulated in words. The result is that phenomena guided by such artificial structures quickly lose their course, and have to be constantly regulated, re-calibrated. This need gives rise to the development and articulation of the artificial concepts of ren and yi for the Ruists, and shi and fei for the Mohists.\n\nThe Ruists emphasize the importance of cultivating the values of ren \u2018humanity\u2019 and yi \u2018appropriateness/rightness.\u2019 The Mohists identify a bivalent structure of preference and evaluation, shifei. Our judgments can be positive or negative, and these arise out of our acceptance and rejection of things or of judgments, and these in turn arise out of our emotional responses to the phenomena of benefit and harm, that is, pleasure and pain. Thus, we set up one of two types of systems: the intuitive renyi morality of the Ruists, or the articulated structured shifei of the Mohists.\n\nZhuangzi sees both of these as dangerous. Neither can keep up with the complex transformations of things and so both will result in harm to our shen and xing. They lead to the desire of rulers to increase their personal profit, their pleasure, and their power, and to do so at the expense of others. The best thing is to steer clear of such situations. But there are times when one cannot do so: there is nothing one can do to avoid involvement in a social undertaking. There are also times\u2014if one has a Ruist sensibility\u2014when one will be moved to do what one can and must in order to improve the social situation. Zhuangzi makes up a story about Confucius\u2019 most beloved and most virtuous follower, Yen Hui, who feels called to help \u2018rectify\u2019 the King of a state known for his selfishness and brutality.\n\nZhuangzi thinks that such a motivation, while admirable, is ultimately misguided. There is little to nothing one can do to change things in a corrupt world. But if you really have to try, then you should be aware of the dangers, be aware of the natures of things, and of how they transform and develop. Be on the lookout for the \u2018triggers\u2019: the critical junctures at which a situation can explode out of hand. In the presence of danger, do not confront it: always dance to one side, redirect it through skilled and subtle manipulations, that do not take control, but by adding their own weight appropriately, redirect the momentum of the situation. One must treat all dangerous social undertakings as a Daoist adept: one must perform xinzhai, fasting of the heart-mind. This is a psycho-physical discipline of attenuation, in which one nurtures one\u2019s inner potencies by thinning out one\u2019s personal preferences and keeping one\u2019s emotions in check, so that one may achieve a heightened sensitivity to the tendencies of things. One then responds with the skill of a sage to the dangerous moods and intentions of one\u2019s worldly ruler.\n\ne. Chapter 5: De Chong Fu (Signs of the Flourishing of Potency)\n\nThis chapter is populated with a collection of characters with bodily eccentricities: criminals with amputated feet, people born with \u2018ugly\u2019 deformities, hunchbacks with no lips. Perhaps some of these are moralistic advisors, like those of chapter 4, who were unsuccessful in bringing virtue and harmony to a corrupt state, and instead received the harsh punishment of their offended ruler. But it is also possible that some were born with these physical \u2018deformities.\u2019 As the Commander of the Right says in chapter 3, \u201cWhen tian (nature) gave me life, it saw to it that I would be one footed.\u201d These then are people whose natural capacity (de) has been twisted somehow, redirected, so that it gives them a potency (de) that is beyond the normal human range. At any rate, this out of the ordinary appearance, this extraordinary physical form, is a sign of something deeper: a potency and a power (de) that connects them more closely to the ancestral source. These are the sages that Zhuangzi admires: those whose virtue (de) is beyond the ordinary, and whose signs of virtue indicate that they have gone beyond.\n\nBut what goes beyond is also the source of life. To hold fast to that which is beyond both living and dying, is perhaps also to hold fast to something more primordial that is beyond human and inhuman. To identify with and nurture this source is to nurture that which is at the root of our humanity. If so, then one does not necessarily become inhuman. Indeed, one might argue that this creates the possibility of deepening one\u2019s most genuine humanity, insofar as this is a deeper nature still.\n\nf. Chapter 6: Da Zong Shi (The Vast Ancestral Teacher)\n\nThe first part of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of the zhenren: the \u201cgenuine person,\u201d or \u201cgenuine humanity,\u201d (or in older translations, \u201cTrue Man\u201d). It begins by asking about the relation between tian and ren, the natural/heaven and the human, and suggests that the greatest wisdom lies in the ability to understand both. Thus, to be forced to choose between being natural or being human is a mistake. A genuinely flourishing human life cannot be separated from the natural, but nor can it on that account deny its own humanity. Genuine humanity is natural humanity.\n\nThere are several sections devoted to explicating this genuine humanity. We find that the genuinely human person, the zhen ren, is in tune with the cycles of nature, and is not upset by the vicissitudes of life. The zhenren like Laozi\u2019s sage is somehow simultaneously unified with things, and yet not tied down by them. The zhenren is in tune with the cycles of nature, and with the cycles of yin yang, and is not disturbed or harmed by them. In fact, the zhenren is not harmed by them either in what appears to us to be their negative phases, nor are their most extreme phases able to upset the balance of the zhenren. This is sometimes expressed with what I take to be the hyperbole that the sage or zhenren can never be drowned by the ocean, nor burned by fire.\n\nIn the second part of the chapter, Zhuangzi hints at the process by which we are to cultivate our genuine and natural humanity. These are meditative practices and psycho-physical disciplines\u2014\u201dyogas\u201d perhaps\u2014by which we learn how to nourish the ancestral root of life that is within us. We learn how to identify with that center which functions as an axis of stability around which the cycles of emotional turbulence flow. By maintaining ourselves as a shifting and responding center of gravity we are able to maintain an equanimity without giving up our feelings altogether. We enjoy riding the dragon without being thrown around by it. Ordinarily, we are buffeted around like flotsam in a storm, and yet, by holding fast to our ancestral nature, and by following the nature of the environment\u2014by \u201cmatching nature with nature\u201d\u2014we free ourselves from the mercy of random circumstances.\n\nIn this chapter we see a mature development of the ideas of life and death broached in the first three chapters. Zhuangzi continues musing on the significance of our existential predicament as being inextricably tied into interweaving cycles of darkness and light, sadness and joy, living and dying. In chapter two, it was the predicament itself that Zhuangzi described, and he tried to focus on the inseparability and indistinguishability of the two aspects of this single process of transformation. In this chapter, Zhuangzi tries to delve deeper to reach the center of balance, the \u2018axis of the way,\u2019 that allows one to undergo these changes with tranquility, and even to accept them with a kind of \u2018joy.\u2019 Not an ecstatic affirmation, to be sure, but a tranquil appreciation of the richness, beauty, and \u201cinevitability\u201d of whatever experiences we eventually will undergo. Again, not that we must experience whatever is \u2018fated\u2019 for us, or that we ought not to minimize harm and suffering where we can do so, but only that we should acknowledge and accept our situatedness, our thrownness into our situation, as the \u2018raw materials\u2019 that we have to deal with.\n\nThere are mystical practices hinted at that enable the sage to identify with the datong, the greater flow, not with the particular arisings of these particular emotions, or this particular body, but with what lies within (and below and above) as their ancestral root. These meditative and yogic practices are hinted at in this chapter, and also in chapter 7, but nothing in the text reveals what they are. It is not unreasonable to believe that similar techniques have been handed down by the practitioners of religious Daoism. It is clear, nonetheless, that part of the change is a change in self-understanding, self-identification. We somehow learn to expand, to wander beyond, our boundaries until they include the entire cosmic process. This entire process is seen as like a potter\u2019s wheel, and simultaneously as a whetstone and as a grindstone, on which things are formed, and arise, sharpened, and are ground back down only to be made into new forms. With each \u2018birth\u2019 (sheng) some \u2018thing\u2019 (wu) new arises, flourishes, develops through its natural (tian) tendencies (xing), and then still following its natural tendencies, responding to those of its natural environment, it winds down: enters (ru) back into the undifferentiated (wu) from which it emerged (chu). The truest friendship arises when members of a community identify with this unknown undifferentiated process in which they are embedded, \u201cforgotten\u201d differences between self and other, and spontaneously follows the natural developments of which they are inseparable \u201cparts.\u201d\n\ng. Chapter 7: Ying Di Wang (Responding to Emperors and Kings)\n\nThe last of the Inner Chapters does not introduce anything new, but closes by returning to a recurring theme from chapters 1, 3, 5, and 6: that of withdrawing from society. This \u2018withdrawal\u2019 has two functions: the first is to preserve one\u2019s \u2018life\u2019; the second is to allow society to function naturally, and thus to bring itself to a harmonious completion. Rather than interfering with social interactions, one should allow them to follow their natural course, which, Zhuangzi believes, will be both imaginative and harmonious.\n\nThese themes resonate with those of the Anarchist chapters in the Outer (and Miscellaneous) chapters: 8 to 11a and 28 to 32. These encourage a life closer to nature in which one lets go of deliberate control and instead learns how to sense the tendencies of things, allowing them to manifest and flourish, while also adding one\u2019s weight to redirect their momentum away from harm and danger. Or, if harm and danger are unavoidable, then one learns how to minimize them, and how to accept whatever one does have to suffer with equanimity.\n\n4. Key Interpreters of Zhuangzi\n\nThe earliest of the interpreters of Zhuangzi\u2019s philosophy are of course his followers, whose commentaries and interpretations have been preserved in the text itself, in the chapters that Liu Xiaogan ascribes to the \u201cShu Zhuang Pai,\u201d chapters 17 to 27. Most of these chapters constitute holistic developments of the ideas of the Inner Chapters, but some of them concentrate on particular issues raised in particular chapters. For example, the author of Chapter 17, the Autumn Floods, elaborates on the philosophy of perspective and overcoming boundaries that is discussed in the first chapter, Xiao Yao You. This chapter develops the ideas in several divergent directions: relativism, skepticism, pragmatism, and even a kind of absolutism. Which of these, if any, is the overall philosophical perspective is not easy to discern. The author of chapter 19, Da Sheng, Mastering Life, takes up the theme of the cultivation of the wisdom of embodied skill that is introduced in chapter 3, Yang Sheng Zhu, The Principle of Nurturing Life. The author of chapter 18, Zhi Le, Utmost Happiness, and chapter 22, Zhi Bei You, Knowledge Wanders North, continues the meditations on life and death, and the cultivation of meditative practice, that are explored in chapter 6, Da Zong Shi, The Vast Ancestral Teacher.\n\nThe next group of interpreters have also become incorporated into the extant version of the text. They are the school of philosophers inclined towards anarchist utopias, that Graham identifies as a \u201cPrimitivist\u201d and a school of \u201cYangists,\u201d chapters 8 to 11, and 28 to 31. These thinkers appear to have been profoundly influenced by the Laozi, and also by the thought of the first and last of the Inner Chapters: \u201cWandering Beyond,\u201d and \u201cResponding to Emperors and Kings.\u201d There are also possible signs of influence from Yang Zhu, whose concern was to protect and cultivate one\u2019s inner life-source. These chapters combine the anarchistic ideals of a simple life close to nature that can be found in the Laozi with the practices that lead to the cultivation and nurturing of life. The practice of the nurturing of life in chapter 3, that leads to the \u201clasting out of one\u2019s natural years,\u201d becomes an emphasis on maintaining and protecting xing ming zhi qing \u201cthe essentials of nature and life\u2019s command\u201d in these later chapters.\n\nThe third main group, whose interpretation has been preserved in the text itself, is the Syncretist school, an eclectic school whose aim to is promote an ideal of mystical rulership, influenced by the major philosophical schools of the time, especially those that recommend a cultivation of inner potency. They may or may not be exemplary of the so-called \u2018Huang-Lao\u2019 school. They scoured the earlier philosophers in order to extract what was valuable in their philosophies, the element of the dao that is to be found in each philosophical claim. In particular, they sought to combine the more \u2018mystically\u2019 inclined philosophies with the more practical ones to create a more complete dao. The last chapter, Tian Xia, The World, considers several philosophical schools, and comments on what is worthwhile in each of them. Zhuangzi\u2019s philosophy is here characterized as \u201cvast,\u201d \u201cvague,\u201d \u201coutrageous,\u201d \u201cextravagant,\u201d and \u201creckless\u201d; he is also recognized for his encompassing modes of thought, his lack of partisanship, and his recklessness is acknowledged to be harmless. Nevertheless, it is stated that he did not succeed in getting it all.\n\nPerhaps the most important of the pre-Qin thinkers to comment on Zhuangzi is Xunzi. In his \u201cDispelling Obsessions\u201d chapter, anticipating the eclecticism of the Huang-Lao commentators of chapter 33, he considers several philosophical schools, mentions the corner of \u2018truth\u2019 that each has recognized, and then goes on to criticize them for failing to understand the larger picture. Xunzi mentions Zhuangzi by name, describes him as a philosopher who recognizes the value of nature and of following the tendencies of nature, but who thereby fails to recognize the value of the human \u2018ren\u2019. Indeed, Zhuangzi seems to be aware of this kind of objection, and even delights in it. He revels in knowing that he is one who wanders off into the distance, far from human concerns, one who is not bound by the guidelines. Perhaps in doing so he corroborates Xunzi\u2019s fears.\n\nAnother text that reveals what might be a development of Zhuangzi\u2019s philosophy is the Liezi. This is a philosophical treatise that clearly stands in the same tradition as the Zhuangzi, dealing with many of the same issues, and on occasion with almost identical stories and discussions. Although the Daoist adept, Liezi, to whom the text is attributed is said to have lived before Zhuangzi, the text clearly dates from a later period, perhaps compiled as late as the Eastern Han, though in terms of linguistic style the material appears to date from around the same period as Zhuangzi. The Liezi continues the line of philosophical thinking of the Xiao Yao You, and the Qiu Shui, taking up the themes of transcending boundaries, and even cosmic realms, by spirit journeying. The leaving behind and overturning of human values is a theme that is repeated in this text, though again not without a certain paradoxical tension: after all, the purpose of such journeying and overturning of values is ultimately to enable us in some sense to live \u2018better\u2019 lives. While Zhuangzi\u2019s own philosophy exerted a significant influence on the interpretation of Buddhism in China, theLiezi appears to provide a possible converse case of Mahayana Buddhist influence on the development of the ideas of Zhuangzi.\n\nThe Jin dynasty scholar, Guo Xiang, is one of the most influential of the early interpreters. His \u201crelativistic\u201d reading of the text has become the received interpretation, and his own distinctive style of philosophical thinking has in this way become almost inseparable from that of Zhuangzi. The task of interpreting Zhuangzi independently of Guo Xiang\u2019s reading is not easy to accomplish. His contribution and interpretation have already been discussed in the body of the entry (See sections above: The Zhuangzitext, and Chapter 2: Qi Wu Lun (Discussion on Smoothing Things Out) ). The Sui dynasty scholar, Lu Deming, produced an invaluable glossary and philological commentary on the text, enabling later generations to benefit from his vast linguistic expertise. The Ming dynasty Buddhist poet and scholar, Han Shan, wrote a commentary on the Zhuangzi from a Chan Buddhist perspective. In a similar vein, the Qing dynasty scholar, Zhang Taiyan, constructed a masterful interpretation of the Zhuangzi in the light of Chinese Buddhist Idealism, or Weishilun. Guo Qingfan, a late Qing, early twentieth century scholar, collected and synthesized the work of previous generations of commentators. The scholarly work of Takeushi Yoshio in Japan has also been of considerable influence. Qian Mu is a twentieth century scholar who has exerted considerable efforts with regard to historical scholarship. Currently, in Taiwan, Chen Guying is the leading scholar and interpreter of Zhuangzi, and he uses his knowledge of western philosophy, particularly western epistemology, cosmology, and metaphysics, to throw new light on this ancient text.\n\nIn the west, probably the most important and influential scholar was A. C. Graham, whose pioneering work on this text, and on the later Mohist Canon, has laid the groundwork and set an extraordinarily high standard for future western philosophical scholarship. Graham, following the reading of Guo Xiang, develops a relativistic reading based on a theory of the conventional nature of language. Chad Hansen is a current interpreter who sees the Daoists as largely theorists of language, and he interprets Zhuangzi\u2019s own contribution as a form of \u201clinguistic skepticism.\u201d Recently, there has been a growth of interest in the aspects of Zhuangzi\u2019s philosophy that resonate with the Hellenistic school of Skepticism. This was proposed by Paul Kjellberg, and has been pursued by other scholars such as Lisa Raphals.\n\n5. References and Further Reading\n\nAmes, Roger, ed. Wandering at Ease in the Zhuangzi.
