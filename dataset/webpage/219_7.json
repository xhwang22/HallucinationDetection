The band was formed in 2001 by Pete Wentz, who supplies bass and lyrics to the band, and guitarist Joe Trohman, who both used to be part of metalcore band Arma Angelus. Trohman later recruited vocalist Patrick Stump, who initially tried out as the band\u2019s drummer, after meeting him in a bookstore. After the release of Project Rocket/Fall Out Boy, a split EP with Project Rocket. It was recorded without current drummer Andy Hurley due to him being disinterested in the project; Hurley later joined in 2003 as a replacement touring drummer.\n\nFueled By Ramen, who were a small independent label at the time, personally called Fall Out Boy to ask them to record a full-length record after hearing one of their demos online. This album became their 2003 debut, Take This To Your Grave, and was a tipping point between the band\u2019s underground success to success in the mainstream. It was the band\u2019s last album to feature Stump as the lead lyricist.\n\nThe band\u2019s 2004 acoustic EP, My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue, became their first charting release and gave fans a taste of what to expect on their sophomore album From Under The Cork Tree. The album creation was set back in February 2005 after Wentz\u2019s suicide attempt, which influenced songs such as \u201c7 Minutes In Heaven (Atavan Halen).\u201d The album was released in May 2005 through Island Records, featuring guest vocals from William Beckett of The Academy Is\u2026 and Brendon Urie of Panic! At The Disco.\n\n2007\u2019s Infinity On High saw the band subtly separate themselves from the pop-punk sound they were known for, featuring unexpected guests like rapper Jay-Z. The album was a huge mainstream success, being certified platinum in six countries and cementing Fall Out Boy as one of the biggest pop-punk bands of the time.\n\nThe band continued on their experimental tangent for their 2008 LP Folie \u00e0 Deux, breaking away almost entirely from their pop-punk sound. The group had a lengthy promotion process, which included the release of mixtape CitizensFOB: Welcome To The New Administration. Lyrically focusing mainly on themes like decaying relationships and fame, the album received a mixed response from fans and critics.\n\nIn 2009, the band announced a hiatus to allow the members to focus on their own projects. Among other things, this break spawned Stump\u2019s solo album Soul Punk, Wentz\u2019s EDM project Black Cards, and Trohman and Hurley\u2019s band The Damned Things.\n\n2013\u2019s Save Rock & Roll was recorded entirely in secret, and the group\u2019s reformation only became apparent after the release of their lead single \u201cMy Song\u2019s Know What You Did In The Dark (Light Em Up).\u201d The record generally received positive reviews, and featured several all-star guests, including Elton John and Courtney Love. 2013 also saw the release of PAX AM Days, a punk-influenced EP that is described as the antithesis of Save Rock & Roll.\n\nThe 2015 release of American Beauty/American Psycho saw the band continue to push for a radio-friendly sound, while also experimenting with samples on many tracks. The single \u201cImmortals\u201d, appeared on the soundtrack of Disney\u2019s Big Hero 6. The band later released Make America Psycho Again,, a rap remix album of American Beauty/American Psycho that disappointed both fans and critics.\n\nThe band\u2019s seventh studio album, M A N I A, was first teased in early 2017. It was initially slated for a September 2017 release, and early singles such as \u201cYoung and Menace\u201d demonstrated an almost complete pull-away from their previous rock-influenced music for a more EDM inspired sound. The release date was subsequently pushed back to January after almost-completely scrapping of the material for the album. The album was shortly followed up with a limited demo EP titled LLAMANIA, which has been teased in the music video for \u201cWilson (Expensive Mistakes)\u201d. The EP consisted of demo tracks that were scrapped from M A N I A.\n\nBefore the band\u2019s major project, \u201cThe MANIA Experience,\u201d had taken into effect, Pete announced that a three-tracked EP would be released. This would include a studio version of the 2008 mixtape demo from \u201cWelcome to the New Administration,\u201d Lake Effect Kid, a semi-new song and a really new song. On August 22, a surprise proclamation had appeared in the band\u2019s social media, stating that the Lake Effect Kid EP was going to be released at midnight. In its release, every song was heavily influenced by Chicago, the band\u2019s hometown."}, {"url": "https://genius.com/artists/Project-rocket", "page_content": "About Project Rocket\n\nFormed in 2002, Project Rocket was a pop-punk/emo band from Chicago, USA.\n\nThe band was very short-lived, and managed to release only two albums before their breakup the following year, one of which was the Split EP with Fall Out Boy, who at the time were not the big-name rock band they are today.

His mother took care of him for the rest of his childhood and teenage. Andy had saxophone as his very first musical instrument that he learned playing well and along with that, he also played percussion in his school\u2019s marching band.\n\nRecommended Lists:\n\nCareer\n\nAndy\u2019s introduction to professional music happened back when he was in the high school and was slowly gaining interest in playing drums. The year was 1996 and Andy was searching for opportunities to play with some big bands and in the pursuit of his dreams, he became part of several hardcore punk and heavy metal bands such as Killtheslavemaster, Racetraitor, Project Rocket and The Kill Pill. He was unable to find his true calling and kept trying different bands during this time.\n\nThe hardcore metal was getting popular in the late 90s and Andy\u2019s drumming skills got him gigs here and there but nothing concrete was coming across his way. However, things changed for the best in the year 2003, when one of his best high school friends Pete Wentz invited Andy to be a part of their band which was called the Fall Out Boy as they were in dire need of an additional drummer due to some troubles with their previous one, and it didn\u2019t take Andy much time to become a regular with Fall Out Boy.\n\nHis association with the band was extremely successful and despite the fact that this was the fourth band Andy was in, he got the fame in such a short time which he wasn\u2019t able to achieve through his previous stints in more than 5 years. Andy recorded the album \u2018Take This To Your Grave\u2019 with the band Fall Out Boy in 2003 to a mega universal success which helped Andy to become one of the hottest drummers around.\n\nIt was the first album by the band which was considered to be an actual hit and the band was reported by the media outlets to be the next big thing.

However, Wentz faced severe emotional trouble during that time which also included a failed suicide attempt. It was being said that he is unable to handle the new found success the band was having and that, among several other things, led the band to take a break for some time in 2009.\n\nAndy got himself busy with several other projects and played for different bands such as a heavy metal band The Damned Things. The band was mostly a collaborative effort and featured members from Fall Out Boy, Anthrax and Every Time I Die and released their very first album titled \u2018Ironiclast\u2019. Enabler, another hard core band, hired Andy and in summer 2012, Enabler released their first album with Andy as a drummer titled \u2018All Hail the Void\u2019.\n\nLater in 2012, Andy joined a straight edge hard rock band named FocusedXminds, and during that time, media speculations were ripe about Fall Out Boy making a comeback and it was said that Andy will leave FocusedXminds when that happens.
