{"John Reed Jr. was arrested in 1923 for his involvement in the Communist Party.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Reed", "page_content": "John Reed, (born Oct. 22, 1887, Portland, Ore., U.S.\u2014died Oct. 19, 1920, Moscow), U.S. poet-adventurer whose short life as a revolutionary writer and activist made him the hero of a generation of radical intellectuals.\n\nReed, a member of a wealthy Portland family, was graduated from Harvard in 1910 and began writing for a Socialist newspaper, The Masses, in 1913. In 1914 he covered the revolutionary fighting in Mexico and recorded his impressions in Insurgent Mexico (1914). Frequently arrested for organizing and defending strikes, he rapidly became established as a radical leader and helped form the Communist Party in the United States.\n\nHe covered World War I for Metropolitan magazine; out of this experience came The War in Eastern Europe (1916). He became a close friend of Lenin and was an eyewitness to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, recording this event in his best known book, Ten Days That Shook the World (1919).\n\nWhen the U.S. Communist Party and the Communist Labor Party split in 1919, Reed became the leader of the latter. Indicted for treason, he escaped to the Soviet Union and died of typhus; he was subsequently buried with other Bolshevik heroes beside the Kremlin wall. Following his death the Communist Party formed many John Reed clubs, associations of writers and artists, in U.S. cities."}, {"url": "http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/ctenglish/2018/commentaries/202106/t20210616_800249633.html", "page_content": "July 1st is a red-letter date in China and the world\u2019s calendar marking the centenary of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Back then China 100 years ago, wallowing in its Century of Humiliation, was mostly a collection of fiefdoms run by contentious self-serving warlords, rather than a country. It was a mere shadow of the previous economically and technologically powerful centrally-governed country that had led the world for several thousand years. How times have changed from dark night, back to bright light, led by the CPC, whose founders could hardly have imagined the \u201cback to the future\u201d change they initiated, nurtured and achieved.\n\nIn America, this incontrovertible success, however, has been currently lost in translation. It would be news to virtually every American, especially these recent five years. Our leaders have increasingly demonized and blamed China at every turn for what are primarily our own homegrown mistakes, missteps and myopia, even predating Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s also a perfect storm of hate in stereo. We\u2019ve long been conditioned to abhor communism, no differently than Pavlov\u2019s dogs were conditioned to respond to stimuli. Red-baiting didn\u2019t start or end with Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy with his ruthless mid-century witch-hunts and they continue to this day with Republican party attacks on all things socialist. And pointing the finger at the Chinese is only the latest in the racist blame-game of \u201cyellow peril\u201d hysteria that began in mid-19th century America which still continues apace.\n\nIn answer to McCarthy\u2019s frequently repeated question during hearings where he falsely soiled the reputations of numerous people, \u201cHave you now or ever been a member of the Communist Party?\u201d My answer is \u201cno\u201d and in fact as our great American humorist, Will Rogers, said almost a century ago \u201cI don\u2019t belong to any organized political party, I\u2019m a Democrat.\u201d I\u2019ve worked in the bowels of the American government, been a vice-president of a premier media company and lived most of this century in China. I try to be objective since, like the lyrics of a famous song of my youth by Joni Mitchell, \u201cI\u2019ve seen both sides now.\u201d\n\nMy conclusion is that in the real world, no political system is flawless. All have imperfections because human beings are imperfect. As Shakespeare wrote in Julius Caesar, \u201cThe fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.\u201d So the question is which model is the best?\n\nThe question, however, is incomplete since just as one size doesn\u2019t fit all, one model doesn\u2019t fit all. The answer depends on many variables, including cultural and historical background, so the true query is \u201cwhich model is the best fit for a given country?\u201d.\n\nTourists enjoy their time in Shanghai, on Oct. 6, 2020, the sixth day of National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holiday.\n\nUnlike the former Soviet Union or today\u2019s America, China doesn\u2019t force or push its model on any other country. While the Chinese model might not be suitable for our 330 million Americans, it does suit the vast majority of China\u2019s 1.4 billion citizens as evidenced by independent public opinion polling, both long term and focused on the global pandemic still ongoing in much of the rest of the world.\n\nA long-term study released last year examined the relationship between Chinese citizens and the CPC from 2003 to 2016. The study found a near-universal rise in average satisfaction toward all four levels of the Chinese government \u2013 township, county, province, and central levels \u2013 in this period based on more than 31,000 interviews in both urban and rural areas.\n\nFor example, in 2016, the last year the survey was conducted, 93.1 percent of respondents were either \u201crelatively satisfied\u201d or \u201chighly satisfied\u201d with the central government\u2019s performance, representing an increase of 7 percent from 2003. In the same period, township governments, the lowest level examined, received the approval of 44 percent of respondents in 2003, but jumped to 70 percent in 2016, a 26 percent rise.\n\nFake news? Too good to be true? Communist propaganda? Well, consider the source: the Harvard University Kennedy School of Government\u2019s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, and the report\u2019s lead author is its China Programs Director, Professor Edward Cunningham.\n\nThe study has the distinction of being the longest academic study of Chinese public opinion ever conducted by a research institution based outside China. According to Harvard, it used \u201cthe most objective and quantitative methods\u201d currently available.\n\nAnd regarding the Covid-19 crisis, the Chinese public\u2019s approval of its government is similar. In an anonymous survey about how the government dealt with the coronavirus, of nearly 20,000 Chinese citizens across 31 Chinese provinces conducted in April, 2020 as the virus was winding down in China but exploding elsewhere, more than 90 percent of respondents said that they were satisfied with how China\u2019s national leaders managed the outbreak. In fact, nearly half reported increased trust of the central government. According to sociology Professor Cary Wu of Canada\u2019s York University, an expert in public opinion who led the massive effort: \u201cSurprisingly, [the epidemic] actually increased people\u2019s satisfaction and support for their government.\u201d\n\nThis study was corroborated by one done a month later by the China Data Lab at the University of California at San Diego that showed an increase in the Chinese public\u2019s trust of its leaders. The average levels of trust in both the central and local governments steadily increased during the previous year. For instance, on a 10-point scale, the already high average trust level for the central government rose from 8.23 in June 2019, to 8.65 the following February, and to 8.87 three months later. There was a similar upward trend for municipal governments.\n\nIs there any secret sauce in China\u2019s recipe for success among its people? My experience in China suggests two important ingredients: leadership practical experiences and systemic planning.\n\nI hate to bring up Harvard again, but hey, I went there. In Harvard Business School, MBA candidates, many of whom go on to C-suites of commerce in the US and abroad, study diverse business cases of success, failure and everything in between. The intent is that by the time they finish, they will never be confronted by a real world situation that they haven\u2019t studied and analyzed. The CPC\u2019s model actually goes Harvard one better. A CPC cadre who rises to the top doesn\u2019t do so according to the Peter principle, often found elsewhere, of going with the flow allowing incompetence to rise to the top, but increasingly gives actual real world leadership challenges to cadres, starting at the village level on up to in both government and state owned enterprises so senior leaders must have proven themselves as serving the people to have climbed further up the ladder. In this case, the cream rises to the top!\n\nAn aerial photo shows new residential buildings in Bamou village, Baise, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. (Photo/China Daily)\n\nThe second element is China\u2019s five-year plan model (FYP) which systemically solicits input from all stakeholders, whether experts or citizens, over a period of years in person and online. FYPs work and the statistics speak for themselves.\n\nWhen I was growing up in then-prosperous Detroit in the 1950s, parents told us to eat all our food because children in China were poor and hungry. And in 1953, the first year of China\u2019s inaugural FYP (1953 \u2013 1957), poverty and economic suffering were indeed the norm. That year, China\u2019s population was 583 million with its per capita GDP of $54. Today under the leadership of the CPC that figure is $10,400 with a population of 1.4 billion. During the past 70 years, an astounding 850 million people have been lifted out of poverty.\n\nBut the CPC doesn\u2019t rest on its laurels. Despite COVID-19, China has met its first centennial goal of building a moderately prosperous socialist society in all respects.\n\nChina\u2019s current 14th FYP (2021-2025) is already mapping China\u2019s future on the path to achieving the second centennial goal of becoming a great, modern, socialist country by 2049, with an intermediate goal for China to achieve its basic socialist modernization by 2035. If past is prologue, there\u2019s every reason to believe that they will succeed.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "http://chinaplus.cri.cn/news/politics/11/20170702/7602.html", "page_content": "Communism was called a haunting ghost more than a century and a half ago, and few believed the Communist Party of China (CPC) could survive when it was founded in 1921. Now, the world is watching the largest ruling party in the world march toward its first centenary goal.\n\nThe CPC is celebrating its 96th anniversary on Saturday and the 19th National Congress will be held in the latter half of this year. The congress will elect the leadership for another five-year term, the critical period for a goal of completing building a well-off nation by the Party's 100th anniversary.\n\nOnce the goal is realized, nearly one fifth of the world's population will live in a \"moderately prosperous society in all respects,\" or \"xiaokang\" in Chinese.\n\nThe CPC is confident and determined in achieving that.\n\nSince its founding, the Party has been faced with doubts, misunderstanding and even hostility. Yet, the CPC has emerged as one of the world's most successful and exciting stories.\n\nChina was a poor nation scarred by foreign aggression and civil war. It is now the world's second-largest economy and a major international player.\n\nThe CPC has evolved from a small group of around 50 members to a 89-million member strong party, more than the population of Germany, with 4.5 million Party grassroots organizations.\n\n\"Political legitimacy comes from competence and prosperity,\" said Zhang Weiwei, director of the Institute of China Studies under Fudan University. \"The CPC experience shows that the ultimate test of a good system is how well it ensures good governance as judged by the people of that country.\"\n\nChina is in better shape than at any time in living memory. There is every reason to believe the CPC is leading China back to the center of the world stage, Zhang said.\n\nTHE CORE\n\nLast year, Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, was endorsed as the \"core\" at the sixth plenary session of the 18th CPC Central Committee. Analysts said the position is key for the Party and the country to keep on the right track of development.\n\nThe Chinese need to unify around a core figure, a central leader, as their influence can unite the people and collect wisdom to formulate and implement suitable policies, said Professor Liu Dongchao with the Chinese Academy of Governance.\n\nFor the first 14 years of the CPC, the Party was without a strong, core leader, which resulted in repeated setbacks of the revolutionary cause. The Party was almost on the verge of dissolution.\n\nIn 1935, leader Mao Zedong established his authority within the CPC Central Committee and the military. Since then, the CPC leadership has been integral to the Party in overcoming difficulties.\n\nNow, Xi is determined to lead China toward the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation, having drawn up a plan to promote all-round socialist economic, political, cultural, social and ecological development.\n\nHe has proposed the strategic layout of the \"Four Comprehensives\" and the philosophy of innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development at a time when sustaining fast growth is becoming increasingly difficult.\n\nMarxism is and must remain the fundamental, guiding principle of the Party. Xi's thoughts on state governance are often called Marxism in modern China, said professor Xin Ming with the Party School of the CPC Central Committee.\n\nCHINA PATH\n\nThe CPC created China's recipe for success, officially called \"socialism with Chinese characteristics.\"\n\nIt is through this model that the CPC represents the interests of the overwhelming majority of the people and puts the people first.\n\nReform is pushed forward thanks to decisions that reflect the broad consensus of Chinese society. Social stability is maintained. The market-government relationship, where the market plays a decisive role in resource allocation and the government better serves its duty, is capable of steering the country out of the harm of the current global economic downturn.\n\nThis path has gained wide support from the public, thanks largely to the fact that most people have found their living standards significantly improved over the past decades, said Liu Dongchao.\n\nLiu was echoed by professor Xin who said Xi's vision of the Chinese dream has united the majority of people in China.\n\n\"The Party has inspired a spirit of striving for a better future,\" Xin said.\n\nAs an evidence of the success of the China path, more than 700 million people have been lifted out of poverty in the decades. In the past more than four years alone, the country has seen over 55 million shake off poverty. The Party has its eyes on the remaining 40 million people still in poverty.\n\nBy 2020, people in rural areas should no longer worry about food and clothing, they should be guaranteed with education, basic medical care and housing. Every rural resident will be elevated above the current poverty line.\n\n\"As long as we pay attention, think correctly, take effective measures and work in a down to earth way, abject poverty is absolutely conquerable,\" Xi said during a June tour of north China's Shanxi Province focusing on poverty.\n\nConfident in its own path, China has no intention of promoting its model as an alternative for other peoples or countries.\n\nSELF-IMPROVEMENT\n\nThe key to doing things well in China lies in the CPC.\n\nThe leadership has repeatedly warned that the biggest threat to the Party is corruption and the CPC must keep improving if it is to remain in power.\n\nSince Xi Jinping took the helm as Party leader, an anti-corruption campaign has swept across the country, exposing many officials charged with abuse of power and misusing public funds. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, at least 240 senior officials and more than 1 million lower-level officials have been investigated.\n\nEarlier this month, for the first time in history, the CPC completed inspections within a five-year administrative term, covering CPC organizations in provincial-level regions, central CPC and government organs, major state-owned enterprises, central financial institutions and universities.\n\nInternal evaluations have proven effective in exposing problems. More than 50 percent of investigations into centrally-administered officials were as a result of information found by discipline inspectors, according to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.\n\nThe CPC also launched a series of campaigns in recent years, including the \"mass-line,\" an effort to build a closer official-people relationship, and \"three stricts and three earnests,\" a political campaign that urges officials to be strict in morals, power and disciplining oneself; and be honest in decisions, business and behavior.\n\nThe CPC has never been afraid of breaking the shelters of vested interests and sweeping out obstacles hampering development, professor Zhang said.\n\nUncertainties ripple through the world today, calling into question the definition of governance legitimacy. In this context, the CPC century-old wisdom and practices may be increasingly relevant, he said."}, {"url": "http://en.youth.cn/RightNow/202106/t20210622_13041925.htm", "page_content": "Photo taken on June 22, 2021 shows an exterior view of the Museum of the Communist Party of China in Beijing, capital of China.

It is this significant influence that has allowed the party to assume prominence and increase in follower-ship to be one of the world\u2019s political parties with the largest follower-ship. It has about 97 million members today.\n\nJust like the political bandwagon that produced the African National Congress (ANC) in January 1912 by John Langalibalele and Isaka Seme Sol Plaatje, the Communist Party of China, born in 1921, was founded by a group of Chinese revolutionaries including Li Dazhao, Chen Duxiu and Mao Zedong who fought against the imperialist subjugation and for the liberation of the Chinese people.\n\nIt is axiomatic and unequivocal that leadership and governance are pillars of political utility and democratic rule should serve the people. The birth of the Communist Party was directed towards serving the people and the establishment of the People\u2019s Republic, People\u2019s Liberation Army, People\u2019s Bank and so many other things in China signifying everything belonging to the people.\n\nThe CPC leaders adopted the best development model, the most rapid, fast and efficient one in changing the Chinese socioeconomic conditions. This was not unconnected with the dynamics of Deng Xiaoping who adopted the policy of reform and opening up in 1978. With such reforms, China was able to quickly move from an agrarian society to an industrial society, allowing foreign investors to domicile portfolios in the mainland. Deng Xiaoping\u2019s legacy was upheld and continued by Jiang Zemin who opened up another developmental process under the leadership of the Communist Party to drive the country to an enviable position within the world stage.\n\nPhoto taken on May 21, 2021 shows the building at 76 Xingye Road in east China\u2019s Shanghai, which is the site of the first national congress of the Communist Party of China. (Photo/Xinhua)\n\nThe political theory of Three Represents, formulated by Jiang Zemin, was ratified by the CPC in 2002 as a \u201cguiding ideology\u201d to encourage the Party to represent \u201cthe developmental demands of China\u2019s advanced productive forces, the orientation for China\u2019s advanced culture, and the fundamental interests of the greatest possible majority of the Chinese people.\u201d\n\nHu Jintao, Jiang Zemin\u2019s successor as general secretary, took office in 2002. Hu introduced two main ideological concepts: the Scientific Outlook on Development and Harmonious Socialist Society.\n\nEvery societal purpose is development. As Dudley Seers believes that development takes place when a country experiences a reduction or elimination of poverty, inequality and unemployment. The CPC has been focusing on fighting unemployment, raising standards of living and workers\u2019 wages. It is in line with the above that looking at the trajectories of unemployment statistics in 2021 in advanced societies, for example the United States having 6.2 percent, United Kingdom with 7.5 percent, France having 7.9 percent and only China with the least unemployment record despite its huge population just at 5.1 percent. This shows that the Communist Party of China should be given some accolades in its relentless efforts in dealing with unemployment in China, which shows that the country is progressing.\n\nThe development of a country is also considered from the level of income inequality among the citizenry. Considering the Gini Coefficients of income inequality, the United States has 41.4 percent records of inequality while China has 38.5 percent. This shows that there is perfect equality in China and perfect inequality in the U.S. based on the Gini Coefficients.\n\nOn poverty reduction, over the four decades, China has lifted more than 800 million people out of poverty, contributing more than 70 percent of global poverty reduction. By the end of 2020, nearly 100 million impoverished rural dwellers have escaped poverty since the 18th National Congress of the CPC in 2012, and all 832 national level poverty-stricken countries had shaken off poverty. Despite the COVID-19 impacts in 2020, China succeeded in removing the remaining 52 countries in southwestern and western regions from poverty list as scheduled.\n\nSince Xi Jinping was elected general secretary of the CPC in 2012, many reforms have taken place and China has been promised prosperity. Xi upheld the principles of reform in his \u201cFour-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy\u201d (SI GE QUAN MAIN): making China a moderately prosperous society, deepening reform, strengthening party discipline and rule of law. These principles are foundations upon which all civilized societies should consider in building a prosperous society. With the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020), China primarily realized the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, which is the first of the two centenary goals laid down to mark the centenary of the CPC.\n\nAerial photo taken on Aug. 26, 2021 shows a view of Xincang Village of Haining City in Jiaxing, east China\u2019s Zhejiang Province. (Photo/Xinhua)\n\nAs the core of the Communist Party, President Xi Jinping has pioneered the modern Silk Road from which the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) emerged. This has become a great effort of the Communist Party to ensure shared future for mankind through economic inclusiveness, massive investment in infrastructure and cooperation among nations. In the whole idea of the BRI, Africa stands the most desirable place for such huge investment in infrastructure due to its deficit on the continent. Africa needs to modernize, transform and develop to stand the test of time and this can be conduced by the Belt and Road.\n\nIt is pertinent to have an eagle view of the structures of the initiative in Africa and how they may pave a way for development as induced by the level of investment on the continent. It has been estimated that about 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa have no access to electricity; a third of African people living in rural areas have no access to roads. African Development Bank has also estimated that Africa\u2019s infrastructure needs $130-170 billion per year with financing gap within the range of $68-$108 billion. Consequently, about 52 out of the 55 African countries have signed memorandum of agreement on the BRI and in some of these countries, BRI projects have already contributed to physical-structural and human development. It is unequivocal that the Kuruma and Isimba hydropower stations and several industrial parks in Uganda and ultimately the Kampala-Entebe Expressway which connects the capital city with the country\u2019s main airport have contributed to modern transportation system, power generation and generated employment opportunities to the people of Uganda.\n\nThe promotion of international trade and economic relations as envisaged by BRI is an area of regional, continental and inter-regional economic development through regional linkages due to effective transportation system. The standard Gauge Railway linking the port of Mombasa through Nairobi to Uganda and extending to other regions of Africa is an epitome of regional economic integration that guarantees economic development. In addition to this, there is also a Trans-African Highway Network of more than 56,000 kilometers involved in this trend.\n\nThe benefits of the BRI to Africa cannot be quantified as it is wide-ranged and cuts across the continent. It covers Africa\u2019s roads construction, railways, ports and power plants among others. Notable of such projects are 2,600 MW hydro-power scheme in Nigeria, $3 billion in Telecom equipment to Ethiopia, Sudan, Ghana and major railway projects in Nigeria, Gabon and Mauritania. A field survey conducted between November 2016 and March 2017 across eight African countries revealed that Chinese companies in Africa employed locals in very large numbers (89 percent of the total workforce) across different business sectors. For instance, employees in the manufacturing, and construction and real estate industries were composed of 95 percent and 85 percent Africans, respectively. Overall, according to the source, more than 10,000 Chinese businesses might have been operating in the whole African continent as of the same period, with manufacturing taking up 95 percent, construction and real estate 85 percent, services 85 percent, and trade 82 percent.\n\nA Chinese instructor shows local trainees how to operate a machine at the China-funded Uganda Industrial Research Institute at Namanve Industrial Park in Mukono district, Uganda, Nov. 9, 2021. (Photo/Xinhua)\n\nDevelopment is achievable through international cooperation and the Chinese initiatives of peaceful diplomacy, respect to the sovereignty of states and noninterference in the domestic affairs of states has uniquely distinguished China in the history of international relations and has guaranteed the maintenance of soft power on the world stage. The African dream of industrialization and development can be achieved especially with the contributions of China. The partnership with China especially promotes to fully achieve the primary objectives of the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AFCFTA). Africa is also happy with the first phase of this development starting with the BRI projects which essentially laid a titanic foundation for what can be termed infrastructure-driven development for Africa.\n\nEach and every African country is naturally endowed with resources. To harness greatness there is the need to unconditionally establish industries that will aid in the exploration of such resources and get them channeled through secondary production that will enable Africa to export manufactured or industrial goods. What\u2019s more, there will be massive market for Africa looking at the population level of the continent and the ability to sell to Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. This is how important China is to Africa and the governments in Africa should grasp this opportunity and not to abuse it. It is based on this experience sharing and mutual learning that Africa can exit the clutches of poverty, underdevelopment and backwardness.\n\nOne major area of concern is that China should maintain such mutual interest with Africa as the world system is becoming fully uncertain with challenges of competition, geopolitical rivalry, security issues. China should have a way of dealing with conflicts, terrorism and insurgency in Africa either engendered due to push and pull syndrome or in the parlance internally or externally induced. This will bring back peace in Africa and allow more areas of engagement, inflows and outflows of foreign direct investment (FDI).\n\nIt is also pertinent to discern that the destabilization of Africa caused by locals or foreign mercenaries is a threat to Africa and China-Africa relations. China is also not devoid of international conspiracies due to its enviable global economic influence and progress it has recorded. The future is Africa, and the Communist Party of China is an engine for Africa\u2019s development. A synergy between them is mutually beneficial with a shared future for mankind.\n\nThe author is a professor at Department of Political Science and International Relations, University of Abuja, Nigeria.

This report is important as it can help clear the misunderstanding and rebut unfounded accusations overseas about the CPC, one of the largest political parties in the world. After a century of struggle, the CPC has gone from victory to victory in its relentless quest for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\n\nEstablished by few dedicated people in a small house and then on a small boat with a dream a century ago, the party set out its journey towards national rejuvenation despite difficulties and tribulations. These 100 years were not easy but brave members of the CPC guided by the ideals of Marxism, by virtue of their innovative spirit and firm belief, vowed to march for prosperity. There were risks on the way, however, the CPC has demonstrated its prowess to deal with all the internal and external enemies and challenges since its inception. This was a defining trait of the CPC. The Chinese people envisioned their rejuvenation long ago and today the CPC has made remarkable strides in meeting that lofty goal.\n\nThe CPC puts the Chinese people at the center of its policies and reforms and thus makes them the ultimate beneficiaries of the nation\u2019s growth. One can tell their commitment to people\u2019s wellbeing from the determination of the Chinese leadership to move the country forward. In retrospect, it was the CPC\u2019s major focus on people\u2019s well-being that drove the party to initiate the reforms starting from 1978 which brought forth China\u2019s economic takeoff. Since then, China has managed to lift 800 million people out of poverty, which is certainly unparalleled in world history. This feat is well explained in the report of \u201cThe CPC: Its Mission and Contributions\u201d. And the recent vision of building a community with a shared future has allowed all Chinese people to benefit from the gains of reform and development. On top of that, through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China has reached millions of people\u2019s hearts globally.\n\nAerial photo taken on Aug. 26, 2021 shows a view of Xincang Village of Haining City in Jiaxing, east China\u2019s Zhejiang Province. (Photo/Xinhua)\n\nThere are two major elements mentioned in the report that are worth discussing. The first is the socialism with Chinese characteristics and the second is the CPC leadership\u2019s strong conviction about their core beliefs and ideals. This publication illustrates how taking socialism with Chinese characteristics as core ideology has helped the nation rise to modern challenges. This ideology has instilled in the CPC vigor and vitality to reform and evolve itself. The report also identifies self-discipline, self-righteousness, and self-reliance of accountability as primary competences of the CPC.\n\nThe primary goal of the CPC is to put people\u2019s wellbeing at the center of making policies and keep their actions in line with transparency, fairness, justice, peace, democracy and fundamental freedoms. It is true not only in the CPC\u2019s history but also in its struggle to make China great today. The report acknowledges the contributions of its predecessors and expects the incumbent leadership to steer China towards national rejuvenation.\n\nThe CPC also plays the leading role in governance and administrative functions of the country. In a centralized government system, the CPC acts as a pivot to guide and lead statecraft in domestic and foreign policy. It actively engages in policy-making and implementation as the source of guiding fountain for the whole governance system. Since its founding, the CPC has played a crucial role in unifying all Chinese people, creating People\u2019s Republic in 1949, and made the society cohesive. China has its own way of democracy which is different from the western way. It is amazing to see how this system has been proved successful for the people of the country. This system has not only helped the socio-economic progress of China but also unlocked the potential for better living in the future."}, {"url": "https://english.dbw.cn/system/2012/11/08/000587898.shtml", "page_content": "1.History\n\n\n\nThe Communist Party of China (CPC) was founded in July 1921.\n\n\n\nFrom 1921 to 1949, the CPC led the Chinese people in their arduous armed struggle and finally succeeded in overthrowing the rule of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism and establishing the People's Republic of China (PRC). After the founding of the PRC, the CPC led the Chinese people of all ethnic groups in defending the independence and security of the country, successfully completing the transition from new democratic revolution to socialist revolution, carrying out systematic large-scale socialist construction, and achieving economic and cultural progress unparalleled in Chinese history.\n\n\n\nAfter the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Party Central Committee at the end of 1978, the country embarked on the biggest change in the history of New China. From 1979, the CPC began to carry out the reform and opening-up policy initiated by Deng Xiaoping. In more than two decades since the initiation of the reform and opening-up, China's economic and social development has been crowned with remarkable success and the country has taken on a new look. This has been the best period since the founding of the PRC in which the Chinese people have reaped the most material benefits.\n\n\n\nThe CPC today has more than 66 million members and over 3.5 million primary organizations.\n\n\n\nHu Jintao is the current General Secretary of the Communist Party of China.\n\n\n\n2. Nature\n\n\n\nThe Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the Chinese working class as well as the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. It is the core of leadership for the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The Party represents the development trend of China's advanced productive forces, the orientation of China's advanced culture and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people (the Three Represents).\n\n\n\nThe Communist Party of China takes Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of Three Represents as its guide to action.\n\n\n\nThe basic line of the Communist Party of China at the primary stage of socialism is to lead the people of all ethnic groups in a concerted, self-reliant and pioneering effort to turn China into a prosperous, strong, democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country by making economic development our central task while adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and persevering in the reform and opening up.\n\n\n\n3. The Principle of Democratic Centralism\n\n\n\nIndividual Party members are subordinate to the Party organization, the minority is subordinate to the majority, the lower Party organizations are subordinate to the higher Party organizations, and all the constituent organizations and members of the Party are subordinate to the National Congress and the Central Committee of the Party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Party's leading bodies at all levels are elected except for the representative organs dispatched by them and the leading Party members' groups in non-Party organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe highest leading body of the Party is the National Congress and the Central Committee elected by it. The leading bodies of local Party organizations are the Party congresses at their respective levels and the Party committees elected by them. Party committees are responsible, and report their work, to the Party congresses at their respective levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigher Party organizations shall pay constant attention to the views of lower organizations and the rank-and-file Party members, and solve in good time the problems they raise. Lower Party organizations shall report their work to, and request instructions from, higher Party organizations; at the same time, they shall handle, independently and in a responsible manner, matters within their jurisdiction. Higher and lower Party organizations should exchange information and support and supervise each other. Party organizations at all levels should enable Party members to keep well informed of inner-Party affairs and to have as many opportunities as possible to involve themselves in them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParty committees at all levels function on the principle of combining collective leadership with individual responsibility based on division of labor. All major issues shall be decided upon by the Party committees after discussion in accordance with the principle of collective leadership, democratic centralism, individual consultations and decision-making through formal meetings. Members of the Party committees should earnestly perform their duties in accordance with the collective decisions taken and division of labor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Party forbids all forms of personality cult. It is necessary to ensure that the activities of the Party leaders are subject to the supervision of the Party and the people, and at the same time to uphold the prestige of all the leaders who represent the interests of the Party and the people.\n\n\n\n4.

While there he introduced his research on the relationship between the philosophical thinking of Mao Zedong and the policies of China\u2019s reform and opening-up.\n\nDuring the tea break, a Belgian philosopher approached him and told him that she believed Mao\u2019s thinking to be profound, and that her favorite point of view was \u201cThe more knowledge you have, the more counter-revolutionary you are.\u201d Astonished, Li explained that this concept didn\u2019t come from Mao, and asked her why she had picked it out in particular. \u201cKnowledge is just like paint,\u201d the philosopher said. \u201cThose who receive a red education are painted red, and those who receive a white education are painted white. People have no ideological differences when they are born; the differences come from the education they receive later.\u201d\n\nThese words brought home to Li the fact that many people hold a biased view of China and the CPC due to different cultural backgrounds and ideologies. He realized that it is important for all people, especially those with different world outlooks, to communicate with each other in order to reach the truth.\n\nThis book, published in the run-up to the 18th National Congress of the CPC and leadership transition, is Li\u2019s attempt to introduce those outside of China to the CPC\u2019s theories, guidelines, and principles and help bring them closer to that truth.\n\nIt begins by introducing the members of the Party to the reader, giving an idea of the nature and variety of people who make up its membership and explaining the process of joining. Li goes on to outline the nature of the ideology of today\u2019s CPC \u2013 that of scientific socialism with Chinese characteristics \u2013 and provides historical information on its former incarnations. He puts particular emphasis on the fact that this ideology is neither the socialism of the Soviet Union nor capitalism, but a new incarnation of socialism adapted to China\u2019s unique environment.\n\nMost of the remainder of the book is concerned with more technical aspects of the CPC, describing its practical organization, operating mechanisms, role in the state, and culminating in an explanation of its goal of peaceful development. Though it is difficult to give a panoramic view of the CPC in a book of only 253 pages, it has been acknowledged on several fronts that it is a useful introduction to those who wish to understand one of the most influential features of Chinese society.\n\n\u201cOne distinctive feature of this book is that it directly targets the international community\u2019s common concerns surrounding the CPC, and explains to its readers the Party\u2019s operational mechanisms and governance style in a conversational tone, providing vivid examples and extensive information, dispelling confusion, and in doing so presenting the Party\u2019s true nature,\u201d said Li Zhongjie, deputy director of the Party History Research Center under the Central Committee of the CPC. \u201cThis is the kind of information that is required by those who have a genuine interest in China and the CPC.\u201d\n\nDavid Shambaugh, a professor of political science and international affairs, with particular expertise on China, at George Washington University, commented on this book from a different angle. \u201cRead this book if you want to know how the CPC thinks about itself, its organization and management, its ideology and theories of political reforms, its links to society and the economy, and its role in the world.\u201d He highlights the particular value it has in introducing the CPC to international audiences, saying, \u201cIt will help readers understand the CPC from a Chinese point of view.\u201d"}, {"url": "http://chinaplus.cri.cn/news/politics/11/20190701/310860.html", "page_content": "Today marks the 98th birthday of the Communist Party of China.

With a history of more than 5,000 years, China has made indelible contributions to the progress of human civilization. After the Opium War of 1840, however, China was gradually reduced to a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society and suffered greater ravages than ever before. The country endured intense humiliation, the people were subjected to great pain, and the Chinese civilization was plunged into darkness. Since that time, national rejuvenation has been the greatest dream of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. \u4e3a\u4e86\u62ef\u6551\u6c11\u65cf\u5371\u4ea1\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u594b\u8d77\u53cd\u6297\uff0c\u4ec1\u4eba\u5fd7\u58eb\u5954\u8d70\u5450\u558a\uff0c\u592a\u5e73\u5929\u56fd\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u620a\u620c\u53d8\u6cd5\u3001\u4e49\u548c\u56e2\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u8f9b\u4ea5\u9769\u547d\u63a5\u8fde\u800c\u8d77\uff0c\u5404\u79cd\u6551\u56fd\u65b9\u6848\u8f6e\u756a\u51fa\u53f0\uff0c\u4f46\u90fd\u4ee5\u5931\u8d25\u800c\u544a\u7ec8\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u60f3\u5f15\u9886\u6551\u4ea1\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u51dd\u805a\u9769\u547d\u529b\u91cf\u3002 To save the nation from peril, the Chinese people put up a courageous fight. As noble-minded patriots sought to pull the nation together, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement, the Reform Movement of 1898, the Yihetuan Movement, and the Revolution of 1911 rose one after the other, and a variety of plans were devised to ensure national survival, but all of these ended in failure.

The founding of a communist party in China was an epoch-making event, which profoundly changed the course of Chinese history in modern times, transformed the future of the Chinese people and nation, and altered the landscape of world development. \u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u4e00\u7ecf\u8bde\u751f\uff0c\u5c31\u628a\u4e3a\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u8c0b\u5e78\u798f\u3001\u4e3a\u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf\u8c0b\u590d\u5174\u786e\u7acb\u4e3a\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u521d\u5fc3\u4f7f\u547d\u3002\u4e00\u767e\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u56e2\u7ed3\u5e26\u9886\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u4e00\u5207\u594b\u6597\u3001\u4e00\u5207\u727a\u7272\u3001\u4e00\u5207\u521b\u9020\uff0c\u5f52\u7ed3\u8d77\u6765\u5c31\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u9898\uff1a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf\u4f1f\u5927\u590d\u5174\u3002 Since the very day of its founding, the Party has made seeking happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation its aspiration and mission.

Through the Northern Expedition, the Agrarian Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, and the War of Liberation, we fought armed counter-revolution with armed revolution, toppling the three mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism and establishing the People's Republic of China, which made the people masters of the country. We thus secured our nation's independence and liberated our people. The victory of the new-democratic revolution put an end to China's history as a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society, to the state of total disunity that existed in old China, and to all the unequal treaties imposed on our country by foreign powers and all the privileges that imperialist powers enjoyed in China. It created the fundamental social conditions for realizing national rejuvenation. Through tenacious struggle, the Party and the Chinese people showed the world that the Chinese people had stood up, and that the time in which the Chinese nation could be bullied and abused by others was gone forever. \u2014\u2014\u4e3a\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf\u4f1f\u5927\u590d\u5174\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u56e2\u7ed3\u5e26\u9886\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\uff0c\u81ea\u529b\u66f4\u751f\u3001\u53d1\u6124\u56fe\u5f3a\uff0c\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49\u9769\u547d\u548c\u5efa\u8bbe\u7684\u4f1f\u5927\u6210\u5c31\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fdb\u884c\u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49\u9769\u547d\uff0c\u6d88\u706d\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u5ef6\u7eed\u51e0\u5343\u5e74\u7684\u5c01\u5efa\u5265\u524a\u538b\u8feb\u5236\u5ea6\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49\u57fa\u672c\u5236\u5ea6\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49\u5efa\u8bbe\uff0c\u6218\u80dc\u5e1d\u56fd\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u9738\u6743\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u98a0\u8986\u7834\u574f\u548c\u6b66\u88c5\u6311\u8845\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf\u6709\u53f2\u4ee5\u6765\u6700\u4e3a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u800c\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u53d8\u9769\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u7a77\u4e8c\u767d\u3001\u4eba\u53e3\u4f17\u591a\u7684\u4e1c\u65b9\u5927\u56fd\u5927\u6b65\u8fc8\u8fdb\u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49\u793e\u4f1a\u7684\u4f1f\u5927\u98de\u8dc3\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf\u4f1f\u5927\u590d\u5174\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u6839\u672c\u653f\u6cbb\u524d\u63d0\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u548c\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u4ee5\u82f1\u52c7\u987d\u5f3a\u7684\u594b\u6597\u5411\u4e16\u754c\u5e84\u4e25\u5ba3\u544a\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u4e0d\u4f46\u5584\u4e8e\u7834\u574f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e7\u4e16\u754c\u3001\u4e5f\u5584\u4e8e\u5efa\u8bbe\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u4e16\u754c\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49\u624d\u80fd\u6551\u4e2d\u56fd\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49\u624d\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\uff01 To realize national rejuvenation, the Party united and led the Chinese people in endeavoring to build a stronger China with a spirit of self-reliance, achieving great success in socialist revolution and construction. By carrying out socialist revolution, we eliminated the exploitative and repressive feudal system that had persisted in China for thousands of years, and established socialism as our basic system. In the process of socialist construction, we overcame subversion, sabotage, and armed provocation by imperialist and hegemonic powers, and brought about the most extensive and profound social changes in the history of the Chinese nation. This great transformation of China from a poor and backward country in the East with a large population into a socialist country laid down the fundamental political conditions and the institutional foundations necessary for realizing national rejuvenation.

We established the Party's basic line for the primary stage of socialism, resolutely advanced reform and opening up, overcame risks and challenges from every direction, and founded, upheld, safeguarded, and developed socialism with Chinese characteristics, thus bringing about a major turn with far-reaching significance in the history of the Party since the founding of the People's Republic of China. This enabled China to transform itself from a highly centralized planned economy to a socialist market economy brimming with vitality, and from a country that was largely isolated to one that is open to the outside world across the board. It also enabled China to achieve the historic leap from a country with relatively backward productive forces to the world's second largest economy, and to make the historic transformation of raising the living standards of its people from bare subsistence to an overall level of moderate prosperity, and then ultimately to moderate prosperity in all respects. These achievements fueled the push toward national rejuvenation by providing institutional guarantees imbued with new energy as well as the material conditions for rapid development. Through tenacious struggle, the Party and the Chinese people showed the world that by pursuing reform and opening up, a crucial move in making China what it is today, China had caught up with the times in great strides. \u2014\u2014\u4e3a\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf\u4f1f\u5927\u590d\u5174\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u56e2\u7ed3\u5e26\u9886\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\uff0c\u81ea\u4fe1\u81ea\u5f3a\u3001\u5b88\u6b63\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u7edf\u63fd\u4f1f\u5927\u6597\u4e89\u3001\u4f1f\u5927\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u4f1f\u5927\u4e8b\u4e1a\u3001\u4f1f\u5927\u68a6\u60f3\uff0c\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u65b0\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e2d\u56fd\u7279\u8272\u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u4f1f\u5927\u6210\u5c31\u3002\u515a\u7684\u5341\u516b\u5927\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u7279\u8272\u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49\u8fdb\u5165\u65b0\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u575a\u6301\u548c\u52a0\u5f3a\u515a\u7684\u5168\u9762\u9886\u5bfc\uff0c\u7edf\u7b79\u63a8\u8fdb\u201c\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e00\u4f53\u201d\u603b\u4f53\u5e03\u5c40\u3001\u534f\u8c03\u63a8\u8fdb\u201c\u56db\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u201d\u6218\u7565\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u575a\u6301\u548c\u5b8c\u5584\u4e2d\u56fd\u7279\u8272\u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49\u5236\u5ea6\u3001\u63a8\u8fdb\u56fd\u5bb6\u6cbb\u7406\u4f53\u7cfb\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\uff0c\u575a\u6301\u4f9d\u89c4\u6cbb\u515a\u3001\u5f62\u6210\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b8c\u5584\u7684\u515a\u5185\u6cd5\u89c4\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u6218\u80dc\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u91cd\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u767e\u5e74\u594b\u6597\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u767e\u5e74\u594b\u6597\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6218\u7565\u5b89\u6392\uff0c\u515a\u548c\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e8b\u4e1a\u53d6\u5f97\u5386\u53f2\u6027\u6210\u5c31\u3001\u53d1\u751f\u5386\u53f2\u6027\u53d8\u9769\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf\u4f1f\u5927\u590d\u5174\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e3a\u5b8c\u5584\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u66f4\u4e3a\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7269\u8d28\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u66f4\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\u529b\u91cf\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u548c\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u4ee5\u82f1\u52c7\u987d\u5f3a\u7684\u594b\u6597\u5411\u4e16\u754c\u5e84\u4e25\u5ba3\u544a\uff0c\u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf\u8fce\u6765\u4e86\u4ece\u7ad9\u8d77\u6765\u3001\u5bcc\u8d77\u6765\u5230\u5f3a\u8d77\u6765\u7684\u4f1f\u5927\u98de\u8dc3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf\u4f1f\u5927\u590d\u5174\u8fdb\u5165\u4e86\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u8f6c\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u8fdb\u7a0b\uff01 To realize national rejuvenation, the Party has united and led the Chinese people in pursuing a great struggle, a great project, a great cause, and a great dream through a spirit of self-confidence, self-reliance, and innovation, achieving great success for socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. Following the Party's 18th National Congress, socialism with Chinese characteristics entered a new era. In this new era, we have upheld and strengthened the Party's overall leadership, ensured coordinated implementation of the Five-Sphere Integrated Plan and the Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy, upheld and improved the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, modernized China's system and capacity for governance, remained committed to exercising rule-based governance over the Party, and developed a sound system of intraparty regulations. We have overcome a long list of major risks and challenges, fulfilled the first centenary goal, and set out strategic steps for achieving the second centenary goal. All the historic achievements and changes in the cause of the Party and the country have provided the cause of national rejuvenation with more robust institutions, stronger material foundations, and a source of inspiration for taking greater initiative. Through tenacious struggle, the Party and the Chinese people have shown the world that the Chinese nation has achieved the tremendous transformation from standing up and growing prosperous to becoming strong, and that China's national rejuvenation has become a historical inevitability. \u4e00\u767e\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u56e2\u7ed3\u5e26\u9886\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\uff0c\u4ee5\u201c\u4e3a\u6709\u727a\u7272\u591a\u58ee\u5fd7\uff0c\u6562\u6559\u65e5\u6708\u6362\u65b0\u5929\u201d\u7684\u5927\u65e0\u754f\u6c14\u6982\uff0c\u4e66\u5199\u4e86\u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf\u51e0\u5343\u5e74\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u6700\u6062\u5b8f\u7684\u53f2\u8bd7\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u767e\u5e74\u6765\u5f00\u8f9f\u7684\u4f1f\u5927\u9053\u8def\u3001\u521b\u9020\u7684\u4f1f\u5927\u4e8b\u4e1a\u3001\u53d6\u5f97\u7684\u4f1f\u5927\u6210\u5c31\uff0c\u5fc5\u5c06\u8f7d\u5165\u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf\u53d1\u5c55\u53f2\u518c\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u660e\u53d1\u5c55\u53f2\u518c\uff01 Over the past hundred years, the Party has united and led the Chinese people in writing the most magnificent chapter in the millennia-long history of the Chinese nation, embodying the dauntless spirit that Mao Zedong expressed when he wrote, \u201cOur minds grow stronger for the martyrs' sacrifice, daring to make the sun and the moon shine in the new sky.\u201d The great path we have pioneered, the great cause we have undertaken, and the great achievements we have made over the past century will go down in the annals of the development of the Chinese nation and of human civilization.\n\n\n\n\u4e0b\u4e00\u9875 \u7b2c [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] \u9875 (\u652f\u6301\u201c\u2190\u3001\u2192\u201d\u952e\u7ffb\u9875)"}], "John Reed Jr. served a year in prison.": [{"url": "https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/goldman-john-reed-1887-1920/", "page_content": "John Reed, 1910. Library of Congress\n\n\"Even as an undergraduate he betrayed what many people believe to be the central passion of his life, an inordinate desire to be arrested.\" \u2014 Walter Lippman, 1914\n\nJohn Reed \u2014 writer, reporter, activist and playboy \u2014 was a legend even to his contemporaries. Born to a well-to-do Oregon family, a graduate of Harvard, and a steadfast socialist, Reed lived what many would call a terrifying life of his own making and desire.\n\nAdventurer\n\nIn the innocent, hopeful years before World War I, and scarcely out of Harvard, Reed embarked on a rebellious course that led him to befriend the Wobblies (Industrial Workers of the World), to write for Max Eastman's The Masses, to ride with the guerrilla forces of Pancho Villa, and to rush into the maw of the Russian Revolution just as the Bolsheviks brought an end to Czarist rule.\n\nBohemian Figure\n\nHe was a knight of American Bohemia, and a habitu\u00e9 of its capital, New York City's Greenwich Village. There he communed with an eclectic array of intellectuals, writers, and artists -- including Emma Goldman. His acquaintances advocated free speech and free love, and were committed to the cause of anarchism. One of them, the journalist Louise Bryant, became his wife and followed him to Russia twice -- once to write about the revolution as it continued to unfold, and once more to join her husband after his arrest and imprisonment. Reed and Bryant were determined \"to smash through the hull of custom and tradition,\" the editor Max Eastman observed, \"and touch at all times and over the earth the raw current of life.\"\n\nWar Protester\n\nWhen World War I broke out in Europe, it cast a pall over the generally pacifist \"lyrical Left.\" Reed wrote an article for The Masses entitled \"The Trader's War,\" criticizing the hypocritical mincing-machine of a war whose aim was profits through the sale of armaments. Three years later, at Emma Goldman's trial in June 1917 for obstructing the draft, Reed said the war was an \"overture to the blackest month for free men our generation has known. With hideous apathy the country has acquiesced in a regime of judicial tyranny, bureaucratic suppression and industrial barbarism. In America, law is merely the instrument for good or evil of the most powerful interest, and there are no Constitutional safeguards worth the powder to blow them to hell.\"\n\nWitness to Revolution\n\nReed's reporting of the Russian Revolution in 1917 brought him lasting fame. He arrived in Petrograd in time to witness the Bolshevik seizure of power in October. His now famous book, Ten Days That Shook the World was the first major account of the revolution to appear in America. \"From his typewriter,\" the historian Robert Rosenstone wrote, \"would flow hundreds of thousands of words about the origins and workings of Soviets, Kerensky and the Provisional Government, workers' control of factories, the state of the army, the character of the Russian people, Bolshevism, the personalities of Lenin, Trotsky, Lunacharsky and other leaders, the tangled web of foreign affairs, the meaning of counterrevolution, the implications of the revolution for the rest of the world.\" Reed's politics had always been passionately left-wing. They were now socialist in spirit, and communist in practice, meaning that his socialism responded to the Kremlin's dictates. From 1917 on, Reed's positions -- and those of other American left-wingers -- were always formed in dialogue, either for or against, with Moscow's Comintern (Communist International).\n\nTheory and Practice\n\nIn the fall of 1919, Reed made his last trip to Russia. After several months of observing how unstable Russia had become -- the government was now suppressing its citizens with summary executions -- Reed made plans to leave. The first leg of Reed's long journey home took him to the Astoria Hotel in Petrograd. Learning that Emma Goldman had just arrived in Russia after her deportation from the U.S., wrote Rosenstone, \"Jack burst into her room 'like a sudden ray of light.' Over a steaming cup of coffee, they celebrated a reunion.\" Almost immediately, Goldman brought up the uncomfortable topic of state power and demanded to know about the Cheka (the Bolshevik secret police). \"Reminded of all the old Russian revolutionists who had broken with the Bolsheviks, Jack blurted, 'You are a little confused by the Revolution in action because you have dealt with it only in theory.'\"\n\nUp Against the Revolution\n\nReed's causes often put him at mortal risk. Such was the case in Russia in 1919, as he passed through regions torn by civil war as he traveled home. He was arrested and imprisoned in Finland, just before the ship on which he stowed away was to sail to America. After his release, Reed returned to Petrograd to recover. In July 1919, he attended Comintern's Second Congress in Moscow. His militancy on the question of trade unionism alienated him from Russian leaders who had in mind consolidating their power over a populace that had to learn \"compromise\" and subjugation of individualist concerns.\n\nHero in Russia\n\nIn September 1919, at Reed's request, Louise Bryant traveled to Moscow to join her husband. She found him \"older and sadder.\" Their reunion was short-lived. Weak from prison and suffering from a long battle with kidney disease, Reed succumbed to typhus. He died on October 17, 1920, in a Moscow hospital with his Bryant by his side. He was thirty-three years old. John Reed was buried at the base of the Kremlin Wall, a Hero of the Revolution.\n\nImmortalized On Film\n\nIn 1981 actor and director Warren Beatty made a three-and-a-half-hour film based on Ten Days That Shook the World, using documentary interviews with Reed's surviving contemporaries as interludes in the film. Beatty himself played the character of John Reed, and Diane Keaton played Louise Bryant. Maureen Stapleton played Emma Goldman, winning an Oscar for her performance."}, {"url": "https://www.novembercoalition.org/thewall/cases/reed-j/reed-j.html", "page_content": "My name is John R.

All the co-defendants received no more than a 6-year sentence.\n\nThe police claimed to have found residue in my house and a little less than a gram of cocaine in my car; they found a roach at my dad's house.

In 1914 he covered the revolutionary fighting in Mexico and recorded his impressions in Insurgent Mexico (1914). Frequently arrested for organizing and defending strikes, he rapidly became established as a radical leader and helped form the Communist Party in the United States.\n\nHe covered World War I for Metropolitan magazine; out of this experience came The War in Eastern Europe (1916). He became a close friend of Lenin and was an eyewitness to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, recording this event in his best known book, Ten Days That Shook the World (1919).\n\nWhen the U.S. Communist Party and the Communist Labor Party split in 1919, Reed became the leader of the latter.

Reed, class of 1910, was in it for the money.\n\n\u201cI recall his telling me that he had two ambitions when he came to college,\u201d a classmate of Reed\u2019s said in the Academy Award-winning 1981 biopic \u201cReds.\u201d \u201cOne was to be elected president of his class. He didn\u2019t know anyone in his class. No one knew him. The other was to make a million dollars by the time he was 25.\u201d\n\nThat would change. By Reed\u2019s senior year of college, he would reject the narrow-minded Harvard aristocracy. He would take over club meetings and ruin dinner parties, overflowing with passionate rants about equality and the worker. Consumed with radicalism, he would dedicate his college career to sparking \u201can influx of discontent, of revolutionary ideas, of criticism and revolt.\u201d\n\nLess than 10 years after that, Reed would become one of the most prominent American communist leaders and writers of the early 20th century. In fact, he spent the decade after college in a propaganda-writing, labor-organizing, revolution-inciting frenzy. In 1913, he rode with Pancho Villa\u2019s army, reporting on the Mexican Revolution. In 1917 he travelled to the USSR as an independent journalist, joining Lenin in the October Revolution. In 1919 he helped form the Communist Labor Party of America, serving as its international delegate.\n\nBy that time, John Reed had become a household name. His account of the Russian Revolution, \u201cTen Days that Shook the World\u201d, was being taught in schools across the USSR. Those who had known him praised him as \u201cthe pulse of the young lion,\u201d mourned him as \u201ca Soviet Russian hero,\u201d and pitied him as a victim of \u201cthe damned Bolsheviki.\u201d When he died of typhus on Oct. 17, 1920, his body was buried in the Kremlin.\n\nReed wasn\u2019t born a socialist, though. In fact, he was born into a typical upper middle-class family in Portland, Oregon on Oct. 22, 1887. Though he would eventually grow into a tall, broad-shouldered athlete\u2014hazel eyes intense even in laughter\u2014as a child he was sickly and bullied by his peers.\n\nJohn Reed posing as a child.

They felt it too, and had a sort of good-natured contempt,\u201d Reed recalled in his memoir, \u201cAlmost Thirty.\u201d \u201cOne time, when I was on the editorial board of the school paper, a boy I was afraid of warned me not to publish a joking paragraph I had written about him\u2014and I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d From a young age, Reed wanted nothing more than acceptance. Before Reed was a fearless revolutionary, he was a lonely Harvard student. Before he wrote satire for \u201cThe Masses,\u201d he wrote plays for the Hasty Pudding. Before he aspired to the Executive Committee of the Comintern, he tried to get punched by the Porcellian. Before Reed denounced the aristocracy, he desperately wanted to join it. Advertisement Rich Men's Sons John Reed was not born into the proletariat. He spent his earliest years mixing with Portland high society in his wealthy grandmother\u2019s home, which he later described as \u201c... a lordly grey mansion modelled on a French chateau, with its immense park, its formal gardens, lawns, stables, green-houses and glass grape-arbor, the tame deer among the trees\u2026\u201d His grandfather, Henry D. Green, had founded the Portland Gas-light Company, and purchased the estate in 1873 for $28,000 (equivalent to about half a million dollars today). That prosperity was short-lived: Reed\u2019s grandmother had expensive taste and a love of travel, and after her husband\u2019s death she quickly spent the majority of the family fortune. Reed\u2019s financial situation became even more precarious after a severe economic depression shook the United States in 1893. When Reed was only nine years old, his parents moved from the Green mansion to an apartment downtown. A few years later, Reed\u2019s father became embroiled in a political scandal that provoked the ire of the Portland aristocracy\u2014the final nail in the Reed family\u2019s social coffin. John Reed poses as a young child. John Reed Additional Papers, 1887-1976 (MS Am 1091.3). Houghton Library, Harvard University. By Courtesy of John Reed Additional Papers, 1887-1976 (MS Am 1091.3). Houghton Library, Harvard University. Still, Reed attended some of the most expensive schools on the East Coast. At 16, he left Portland for a New Jersey boarding school, and in the fall of 1906 he enrolled at Harvard College. A few years later, his brother, Harry, followed. This prestigious education came at both a financial and an emotional cost: as Reed reminisced a decade later, \u201cWe never knew until later how much our mother and father denied themselves that we might go, and how [my father] poured out his life that we might live like rich men\u2019s sons.\u201d Reed might have been able to afford the cost of tuition, but he could not hide his Western, middle-class roots: Harvard had an excellent nose for those masquerading as \u201crich men\u2019s sons.\u201d William James described students like Reed in his 1903 essay \u201cThe True Harvard.\u201d Those who arrived \u201cfrom the remotest outskirts of our country, without introductions, without school affiliations,\u201d had no place in Harvard\u2019s social spaces, he said. \u201cThey seldom or never darken the doors of the Pudding or the Porcellian.\u201d As John M. Brown \u201923 wrote in the Harvard Alumni Bulletin, the Harvard of 1906 was a place of \u201cpoor boys and rich boys; those favored because they were Brahmin-born and others penalized because they were not.\u201d Most of Reed\u2019s new peers had attended elite East Coast prep schools, and considered \u201cnew money\u201d\u2014or, worse, no money\u2014beneath them. A boisterous nobody from Portland hardly stood a chance. This never deterred Reed. A childhood on the (relative) social margins had conditioned him to value popularity, and a natural competitive instinct drove him to compete for it. He developed a fascination with Harvard\u2019s aristocracy, and when he arrived on campus in the fall of 1906 he sought to join it. \u201cA furious energy drove me to all kinds of bodily and mental exercise, without any particular direction,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. \u201cI was increasingly active and restless, more ambitious of place and power, less exalted, scattering myself in a hundred different directions\u2026\u201d He wanted to be a poet. He wanted to be a novelist. He wanted to be a lover, and a fighter, and a rebel. More than anything else, he wanted to be accepted. \u201cDuring my freshman year I used to pray to be liked, to have friends, to be popular with the crowd,\u201d Reed wrote. Advertisement The Waiting Game To a lonely Harvard freshman at the turn of the twentieth century, popularity meant joining a Final Club. The punch process began with admission to the Institute of 1770, an exclusive social organization which selected 100 men from the sophomore class each year and named them \u201cthe socially elect.\u201d Becoming a member of the Institute meant prestige; it meant status; most of all, it meant eligibility for the next tier of exclusive social organizations, the Waiting Clubs. After election to a Waiting Club, juniors and seniors were eligible for an invitation to a Final Club\u2014the apex of the whole system, and the playground of Harvard\u2019s elite. \u201cTo the ordinary freshman before whose eyes the plum of the Institute is dangled,\u201d Reed wrote, \u201ca Final Club seems the end of earthly ambitions.\u201d John Reed poses as a teenager. By Courtesy of John Reed Additional Papers, 1887-1976 (MS Am 1091.3). Houghton Library, Harvard University. It all hinged on the Institute. For Reed, though, getting in was easier said than done. When the Class of 1910 entered Harvard, it had nearly 700 members. The Institute would select only 100. Reed\u2019s odds were bad from the start. In search of a niche, Reed tried to join the freshman crew team. He committed a significant portion of his freshman year to the task, even staying on campus during holidays to row by himself, but he was the last rower eliminated before the end-of-year Harvard-Yale crew regatta and never technically made the team. Reed\u2019s initial forays into the arts community ended similarly fruitlessly. Though he\u2019d later write books and articles hailed by nations, by the end of his freshman year he hadn\u2019t been granted entry to a single campus publication. \u201cI got to know many fellows to nod to, and a very few intimately; but most of my friends were whirled off and up into prominence, and came to see me no more,\u201d he reminisced in \u201cAlmost Thirty,\u201d \u201cAthletes and musicians and writers and statesmen were emerging from the ranks of the class. The Freshman clubs were forming. And I was out of it all.\u201d Reed was never invited to join the Institute of 1770. He never joined a Waiting Club, he never joined a Final Club, and he never really reached the upper echelons he\u2019d aspired to as a freshman. This exclusion was partially the product of class. Reed hadn\u2019t been born into the eastern elite, and the eastern elite knew it. Advertisement Reed knew it, too. When he was rejected sophomore year for two posts for which he felt he \u201cqualified easily\u201d\u2014an editorial position at The Harvard Crimson and the assistant managership of the Varsity Crew team\u2014he chalked it up to snobbery and walked away bitter. It wasn\u2019t only Reed\u2019s class, though: When Reed\u2019s brother arrived to Harvard two years later, he was invited to join the same organizations that had overlooked his older sibling. The snub was also personal. \u201cThere is a clue to his lack of acceptance, his lack of the quality the British call \u2018clubable,\u2019\u201d wrote his classmate, Edward E. Hunt, class of 1910. \u201cThrough everything he did there ran a strand of the grotesque which turned the most serious event into laughter.\u201d Regardless of its cause, Reed took rejection hard. \u201cThe thought that he could be considered inferior, unworthy of their attention no matter what he did, came as a numbing shock to him,\u201d wrote Richard O\u2019Connor in his biography of Reed, \u201cThe Lost Revolutionary.\u201d The Athlete, the Scholar, and the Activities Man By sophomore year, Reed recalibrated. Rejected by the elites and no longer willing to measure personal success by class or wealth, he found a new strategy for social acceptance: joining as many extracurricular activities as possible. As he saw it, the class was divided into three neat groups: the athlete, the scholar, and the \u201cactivities man.\u201d Reed knew which he wanted to join. Reed speaks to several supporters. In \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs.\" By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library In Reed\u2019s model, athletes represented the pinnacle of the social hierarchy. \u201cThe average undergraduate would rather win his \u201cH\u201d than get Phi Beta Kappa,\u201d he wrote in an essay. He wasn\u2019t wrong: by 1907-08, Reed\u2019s sophomore year, campus athletics had become such a dominant social force that President Eliot became concerned that sports were exhausting players, keeping fans from their studies, and encouraging \u201cthe betting evil.\u201d Despite his initial setbacks on the river, Reed enjoyed moderate athletic success on the field and in the pool. He was a member of the swimming team, captain of the water polo team, and song-leader of the cheerleading squad. A former classmate, the Pulitzer prize-winning left-wing journalist Walter Lippmann, class of 1910, remembered Reed as the star of the cheerleading squad. \u201cHe would stand up alone before a few thousand undergraduates and demonstrate without a quiver of self-consciousness just how a cheer should be given,\u201d Lippmann wrote in the New Republic in 1914. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t like the way his instructions were followed he cursed at the crowd, bullied it, sneered at it. It was a sensational triumph for [John] Reed but wasn\u2019t altogether good form at college.\u201d In the Russian Revolution, the ability to rouse a crowd would serve him well. Advertisement Still, Reed saw the athlete\u2019s position in the campus hierarchy as that of an empty figurehead with no real power. He thought that the student that embodied Harvard\u2019s most traditional values was really \u201cthe scholar:\u201d \u201cHe is studying what the great Harvard men of the past have studied\u2014he is really seeking what Harvard has stood for for three hundred years\u2014Veritas.\u201d Reed himself barely scraped past Harvard\u2019s entrance exams, and he left an undergraduate record dotted with C\u2019s, D\u2019s, and E\u2019s (modern F\u2019s). A self-confessed \u201cindifferent student,\u201d he found the classroom dry and lifeless. \u201cWhy should I have been interested in the stupid education of our time?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe take young soaring imaginations, consumed with curiosity about the life they see all around, and feed them with dead technique.\u201d He wrote a number of his essays on club or scrap stationary, perhaps as a deliberate snub. Though Reed respected Harvard\u2019s undergraduate scholars, he never wanted to befriend or become one. \u201cLong lack of comradeship with any but those of his kind have made him intolerant of frivolity, have dried in him the natural desires and exaltations of youth, and therefore he is misunderstood and despised,\u201d he wrote. That left the \u201cactivities man.\u201d Students active in extracurriculars had the social clout lacked by athletes and the social graces lacked by scholars. They embodied all the virtues a turn-of-the-20th-century \u2018Harvard Man.\u2019 \u201cThey are a community of enthusiasts, men of all trades,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey are dreamers and often poets. Their grades are often very poor mediocre and they subordinate college work to their \u201cactivities\u201d.... They talk a great deal among themselves, exchanging ideas and thoughts, strengthening friendships and learning what real standards there are by which to judge a man.\u201d The activities man was busy, plugged in, a member of all the clubs, an insider. By the time of his graduation, Reed had joined so many extracurriculars that his class bio was longer than his (nonexistent) senior thesis. He managed the Glee Club; he joined the Debating Club; he was a member of such mysteriously named organizations as the Memorial Society, the Round Table, the Symposium, and the Oracle. At various points, Reed was a member of some 16 organizations and teams\u2014an impressive number even by Harvard\u2019s contemporary standard. The Harvard Swimming team's group photo.

A Seat at the Table Amongst these many organizations were a few campus publications. Despite his failed start at the Crimson, Reed became an editor at the Harvard Monthly, a literary magazine where his poems and stories, \u201cjuvenile and imitative though they were, won respect and praise and inspired enthusiastic prophecies,\u201d according to Granville Hicks \u201923. He was also a writer and \u201cIbis\u201d\u2014second-in-command\u2014at the Lampoon. John Reed is seized by policemen. \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs. Lithographs by Lynd Ward\" published by Equinox Press Inc., Pusey Library, Harvard University. By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library Reed was a leader as well as a writer. He had a gift for organizing people and executing visions\u2014and he had no shortage of ideas. Still struggling to reconcile his Portland upbringing with his Cambridge education, he became president of the Western Club. A casual eating club created to defy Harvard\u2019s puritanical social norms, the organization became known for mischief and outrageous practical jokes. As President, Reed sat at the head of every table and introduced diners in increasingly ludicrous ways. Advertisement \u201cGentlemen, the future President of the United States!\u201d he cried when Lippmann joined him one evening. \u201cWhere have you bean?\u201d he shouted at another friend, throwing a handful of beans. Reed didn\u2019t confine his antics to the Western Club. As Hicks reported, over the spring break of his junior year, a debacle involving a series of bars, \u201ca resort of dubious reputation,\u201d and a spontaneous trip to Bermuda resulted in Reed\u2019s \u201crustication\u201d\u2014an archaic punishment based on exile to Concord, Mass. Reed spent the rest of the semester in time-out. When not in Concord, Reed served as President of the Cosmopolitan Club. Founded by Reed on Feb. 12, 1908, the club united Harvard\u2019s international students, entertained foreign dignitaries, and discussed world affairs. It was wildly successful: 53 students joined at its inception, and by Reed\u2019s graduation in the spring of 1910 that number had grown to roughly 200. Reed called it \u201cone of the most important organizations ever formed among the students at Harvard.\u201d Then again, Reed had a taste for hyperbole. It showed up in his rhetoric, marked his prose, and, in the fall of his junior year, inspired the creation of the Dramatic Club. The club provided Harvard\u2019s budding playwrights with a stage. The school offered few opportunities to produce original student theater, and students taking playwriting courses\u2014including Reed and his two co-founders, Edward Sheldon and Hans V. Kaltenborn\u2014chafed at the limitation. Rather than trying to convince an existing troupe to produce student work, they decided to make their own. The Dramatic Club was novel for another reason: it became the first theater group on campus to admit women to its ranks. The decision provoked controversy. Members felt that \u201cif we expected to achieve any social distinction at Harvard with our newly organized club, we simply could not permit the participation of Radcliffe girls,\u201d Kaltenborn recalled in his memoir, \u201cFifty Fabulous Years.\u201d Eventually, these protests were eventually overlooked \u201cin the interest of better drama,\u201d and the Dramatic Club (antecedent of the contemporary Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club) went co-ed. It\u2019s easy to see traces of Reed\u2019s later persona in his early college activities. By junior year, Reed was already an iconoclast, defying social mores and laughing at Harvard authority. He was an idealist, uniting his peers and planning to bring labor justice to the world. He was a leader, screaming at crowds in stadiums and theaters and pitting himself against the status quo. But while he\u2019d turned his eyes from the elites and become the \u201cactivities man\u201d he\u2019d always wanted to be, he was still searching for his cause. \u201cJohn Reed was not a fiery left-winger in those days,\u201d wrote Kaltenborn. \u201cHe was a nonconformist.\u201d Advertisement Senior year, that changed. Infiltrating the Ranks In his final year of college, Reed discovered the Harvard Socialist Club. Founded by two freshmen in 1908, the club\u2019s stated goal was to use the study and spread of socialism to correct the \u201cfundamentally imperfect\u201d state of society. At inception, it had nine members. John Reed speaks to a crowd. In \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs. Lithographs by Lynd Ward\" published by Equinox Press Inc., Pusey Library, Harvard University. By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library Despite its modest size, the Club pledged to permeate the college. As Reed put it, \u201cThey sat not in lofty contempt above the ignorant student body, but mingled with it, learning its sympathies and weakness, used its machinery...\u201d While club members held frequent discussions of their own, often continuing hours after midnight, they attempted to recruit and effect change by infiltrating other campus organizations. This turned out to be an effective strategy. After less than five years, the Socialist Club had between 30 and 50 members. Two years after Reed\u2019s graduation, a senior named Gerard C. Henderson, class of 1912, told the Harvard Graduates\u2019 Magazine that the club\u2019s \u201c...fringes merge imperceptibly into a half-dozen political clubs, some adherents of such leaders as Wilson and La Follette, and others more vaguely representative of insurgency and progressivism.\u201d Reed was never officially a member, but the club still radicalized him. \u201cIt made me, and many others, realize that there was something going on in the dull outside world more thrilling than college activities,\u201d he wrote. Reed\u2019s newfound politics were first evident in his writing. Reed had been writing for the Lampoon for a few years already, but during his senior year his sketches gained a biting political edge they\u2019d lacked before. In one Lampoon editorial, Reed mocked Harvard\u2019s old money and gave advice to young men seeking to boost their pedigrees. \u201cHyphens are of immense value\u2014remember that anyone will always be glad to lend money to an Endicott-Sears-Cabot, a Wendell-Wendell, or a Trumbull-Peabody,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf a child is too late to corral a Back Bay Brahman for a progenitor, let him seize upon a self-made man who has made a good job of it. Money will finally land anyone among the Captains of Society.\u201d Though Reed mocked them, the elite were beginning to notice him. In the spring of Reed\u2019s senior year, he was offered membership in the Hasty Pudding. The Pudding was one of the most exclusive social organizations on campus, made up almost entirely of members of Waiting and Final Clubs, and to Reed the invitation must have seemed like a baffling reversal on the part of the aristocracy. Certainly, he had distinguished himself in the years since he\u2019d first been overlooked, but he was still the same brash Westerner he\u2019d always been. Advertisement In truth, the Hasty Pudding didn\u2019t have much of an option. It was nearly time for the club\u2019s annual musical, and none of its existing members\u2014who had been selected on the basis of social status\u2014felt capable of writing lyrics. Reed was a necessary outside hire, and he knew it. The Hasty Pudding put on an uncharacteristically subversive show that year. \u201cJust insist that your aunt was a Cabot, And your grandmother\u2019s real name was Weld. Try hard to make rudeness a habit, And be careful with whom you\u2019re beheld.\u201d Revolution in the Yard Suddenly, Reed was a \u201cclub man.\u201d A critical one, certainly, but a club man all the same. And as much as he tried to suppress it, he found satisfaction in the title. That satisfaction became evident at the end of his senior year. John Reed sits in a prison cell. In \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs. Lithographs by Lynd Ward\" published by Equinox Press Inc., Pusey Library, Harvard University. By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library In 1910, Harvard\u2019s rich lived in glamorous private apartments on Mt. Auburn Street; the poor lived in dorms in Harvard Yard. This dichotomy influenced more than sleeping arrangements: Residents of the Street controlled most aspects of undergraduate life, and overwhelmingly filled class offices at graduation. That year, Reed was their nominee for Ivy Orator. Then, the Yard revolted. In an explosion of resentment that had been brewing since freshman fall, the Yard refused to accept the Street\u2019s nominations for class office. Residents of the Yard circulated petitions and submitted their own nominees instead. Advertisement Reed was stuck. He already considered himself a man of the people, but aligning himself with the Yard would undo all of his recent social progress. So he ran on behalf of the Street, and like almost every other Street candidate, he lost. There had been a revolution, and he was on the wrong side. Reed realized his mistake once it was already too late. Shortly after his graduation, he wrote a sweeping 73-page tract called \u201cThe Harvard Renaissance,\u201d in which he describes the rise of socialism at the college. In that text, he calls the victory of the Yard \u201ca vote of the unrepresented majority against its traditional leaders.\u201d It is the story of the Marxist struggle in all but name. College was Reed\u2019s first introduction to the vapid nature of the privileged class. \u201cThe more I met the college aristocrats, the more their cold cruel stupidity repelled me,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. \u201cI began to pity them for their lack of imagination, and the narrowness of their glittering lives\u2014clubs, athletics, society. \u201cCollege is like the world; outside there is the same class of people, dull and sated and blind.\u201d Three years later, Reed spoke on behalf of silk workers in Paterson, N.J., earning himself his first jail term and a reputation as a radical communist. Frustrated but not deterred, he allied himself with the trade union International Workers of the World and organized thousands of workers into a strike benefit in Madison Square Garden. By the late 1910s, the American government feared him. The USSR hailed him as a genius and taught his name in schools. Richard M. Nixon didn\u2019t call Harvard \u201cthe Kremlin on the Charles\u201d for nothing. John Reed might have practiced socialism in New York City and St. Petersburg, but he learned it in the Yard. Club Man at Last Reed\u2019s life was prime martyr material, and Harvard\u2019s later left-wingers ate it up\u2014\u201cJohn Reed Clubs\u201d began popping up across the United States only shortly after the man\u2019s death. Harvard had a branch, too. Calling itself a Marxist study and action group, the Harvard John Reed Society was founded in 1932 by \u201ca group of undergraduates attracted by the personality of John Reed and interested in studying sciettific [sic] socialism, the cause for which he gave his life.\u201d Though it was never widely popular, the club lingered for years. In 1943, it even published several issues of a magazine, The Harvard Vanguard. John Reed speaks to supporters. In \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs. Lithographs by Lynd Ward\" published by Equinox Press Inc., Pusey Library, Harvard University. By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library Advertisement Reed\u2019s mother did not approve. Charlotte J. Reed was always upset by John Reed Clubs\u2014she found them exploitative. Reed might have felt the same way. \u201cIn view of what has happened in Russia since the Revolution, I am certain that he would not have tolerated the use of his name as a means of ensnaring idealistic American youth into the Communist party,\u201d Reed\u2019s old friend and Dramatic Club co-founder Hans V. Kaltenborn, class of 1909, reflected in \u201cFifty Fabulous Years.\u201d \u201cThat is what is being done at Harvard today. The John Reed Society has been little more than a cover for Communist party activities at Harvard since its inception.\u201d It wasn\u2019t safe to join a club with such a reputation in McCarthy-era America. In 1950, the John Reed Society went underground. According to The Boston Herald, the club had applied for a meeting room in the spring of 1950, and the administration had accepted. But when Dean Robert A. Watson reached out the following fall, he got crickets. No one would come forward to take the key. \u201cLast year\u2019s president, Donald M. Long of New York, is no longer at Harvard, for academic reasons,\u201d wrote the Herald. \u201cLast year\u2019s vice-president, Philip H. Ennis, said he is no longer associated with the club. Nobody else admits association.\u201d Harvard assured the public that it had not shut down the club, but students were suspicious. Arthur J. Sockol \u201951, a senior who \u201cidentified himself as spokesman for the group,\u201d wrote to The Boston Traveler. Though the university had allowed the club to continue functioning, he said, students feared retaliation. The club was dead. And despite a smattering of radical left-leaning organizations that popped up throughout the \u201960s and later\u2014the Young Socialist Alliance, the Young People\u2019s Socialist League, the Democratic Socialists of America\u2014it stayed dead. Signs of Life In 2016, the radical left has re-entered the conversation. Bernie Sanders, a presidential nominee who calls himself a \u201cdemocratic socialist,\u201d is experiencing widespread success, particularly among young voters. In the Iowa primary, 84 percent of Democratic voters aged 17-29 supported Sanders. In the New Hampshire primary, that number was 83 percent. In a recent Chegg study of 1,363 college students, 6 percent self-identified as socialists. Is John Reed\u2019s crusade experiencing a revival? In \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs. Lithographs by Lynd Ward\" published by Equinox Press Inc., Pusey Library, Harvard University. By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library Advertisement He Li \u201916, president of Harvard Students for Bernie, considers it a question of semantics. \u201cObviously Bernie calls himself a democratic socialist, [but] what\u2019s more important to everybody I\u2019ve talked to are his specific policies and what he stands for,\u201d Li said. \u201cThe label of socialist, that comes second.\u201d Others feel differently. \u201cOne of the long-lasting impacts of Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign is the way that\u2026 he\u2019s been able to change the conversation around \u201cthe s-word,\u201d Tyrik LaCruise \u201917, an avid Sanders supporter, said. \u201cRunning as a democratic socialist, people are like \u2018Whoa, wait a second. It\u2019s not as dirty as I thought. The post office is socialism. Public schools? Socialism. We have roads. That\u2019s socialism.\u2019\u201d Paul Adler, a lecturer in Harvard\u2019s History and Literature concentration, is intrigued by that reclamation. \u201cThe Sanders phenomenon is blowing my mind.... He calls himself a socialist. According to the polls of Democratic party voters, a lot of people are OK calling themselves socialists,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s been enough time since the Cold War that there can be a renewed attempt at all this.\u201d If the Cold War and the Red Scare really are beginning to fade from cultural memory, then contemporary students might find themselves facing a form of socialism in some ways analogous to the one that faced Reed. After all, Reed grew up in a pre-Soviet world. As Adler pointed out, \u201cPeople were scared of socialism and said negative things about it, but it had more a connotation of scary anarchy than totalitarianism.\u201d The same could be said today. In that case, perhaps we should take a close look at John Reed. His life reads like a short novel, gripping in its intensity and poignant in its brevity. He believed in an ideal, and it drove him through college, across Europe, and into the ground before he turned 33. Adler suggests that we view the revolutionary as simultaneous warning and inspiration. \u201cI think the most truthful interpretation is that [Reed] encompasses both,\u201d said Adler. \u201cHe\u2019s a warning about the dangers of political idealism, about having a philosophy that the ends justify the means. But he\u2019s also an inspiration about getting down in the muck and trying to create some sort of better society.\u201d Tags CollegeScrutinyPoliticsFront Feature Advertisement Advertisement The Harvard Crimson The University Daily, Est. 1873\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 The Harvard Crimson, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t much good at the things other boys were, and their codes of honor and conduct didn\u2019t hold me. They felt it too, and had a sort of good-natured contempt,\u201d Reed recalled in his memoir, \u201cAlmost Thirty.\u201d \u201cOne time, when I was on the editorial board of the school paper, a boy I was afraid of warned me not to publish a joking paragraph I had written about him\u2014and I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d From a young age, Reed wanted nothing more than acceptance.\n\nBefore Reed was a fearless revolutionary, he was a lonely Harvard student.

Before he aspired to the Executive Committee of the Comintern, he tried to get punched by the Porcellian.\n\nBefore Reed denounced the aristocracy, he desperately wanted to join it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRich Men's Sons\n\nJohn Reed was not born into the proletariat. He spent his earliest years mixing with Portland high society in his wealthy grandmother\u2019s home, which he later described as \u201c... a lordly grey mansion modelled on a French chateau, with its immense park, its formal gardens, lawns, stables, green-houses and glass grape-arbor, the tame deer among the trees\u2026\u201d His grandfather, Henry D. Green, had founded the Portland Gas-light Company, and purchased the estate in 1873 for $28,000 (equivalent to about half a million dollars today).\n\nThat prosperity was short-lived: Reed\u2019s grandmother had expensive taste and a love of travel, and after her husband\u2019s death she quickly spent the majority of the family fortune. Reed\u2019s financial situation became even more precarious after a severe economic depression shook the United States in 1893. When Reed was only nine years old, his parents moved from the Green mansion to an apartment downtown. A few years later, Reed\u2019s father became embroiled in a political scandal that provoked the ire of the Portland aristocracy\u2014the final nail in the Reed family\u2019s social coffin.\n\nJohn Reed poses as a young child.

Houghton Library, Harvard University. Still, Reed attended some of the most expensive schools on the East Coast. At 16, he left Portland for a New Jersey boarding school, and in the fall of 1906 he enrolled at Harvard College. A few years later, his brother, Harry, followed. This prestigious education came at both a financial and an emotional cost: as Reed reminisced a decade later, \u201cWe never knew until later how much our mother and father denied themselves that we might go, and how [my father] poured out his life that we might live like rich men\u2019s sons.\u201d Reed might have been able to afford the cost of tuition, but he could not hide his Western, middle-class roots: Harvard had an excellent nose for those masquerading as \u201crich men\u2019s sons.\u201d William James described students like Reed in his 1903 essay \u201cThe True Harvard.\u201d Those who arrived \u201cfrom the remotest outskirts of our country, without introductions, without school affiliations,\u201d had no place in Harvard\u2019s social spaces, he said. \u201cThey seldom or never darken the doors of the Pudding or the Porcellian.\u201d As John M. Brown \u201923 wrote in the Harvard Alumni Bulletin, the Harvard of 1906 was a place of \u201cpoor boys and rich boys; those favored because they were Brahmin-born and others penalized because they were not.\u201d Most of Reed\u2019s new peers had attended elite East Coast prep schools, and considered \u201cnew money\u201d\u2014or, worse, no money\u2014beneath them. A boisterous nobody from Portland hardly stood a chance. This never deterred Reed. A childhood on the (relative) social margins had conditioned him to value popularity, and a natural competitive instinct drove him to compete for it. He developed a fascination with Harvard\u2019s aristocracy, and when he arrived on campus in the fall of 1906 he sought to join it. \u201cA furious energy drove me to all kinds of bodily and mental exercise, without any particular direction,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. \u201cI was increasingly active and restless, more ambitious of place and power, less exalted, scattering myself in a hundred different directions\u2026\u201d He wanted to be a poet. He wanted to be a novelist. He wanted to be a lover, and a fighter, and a rebel. More than anything else, he wanted to be accepted. \u201cDuring my freshman year I used to pray to be liked, to have friends, to be popular with the crowd,\u201d Reed wrote. Advertisement The Waiting Game To a lonely Harvard freshman at the turn of the twentieth century, popularity meant joining a Final Club. The punch process began with admission to the Institute of 1770, an exclusive social organization which selected 100 men from the sophomore class each year and named them \u201cthe socially elect.\u201d Becoming a member of the Institute meant prestige; it meant status; most of all, it meant eligibility for the next tier of exclusive social organizations, the Waiting Clubs. After election to a Waiting Club, juniors and seniors were eligible for an invitation to a Final Club\u2014the apex of the whole system, and the playground of Harvard\u2019s elite. \u201cTo the ordinary freshman before whose eyes the plum of the Institute is dangled,\u201d Reed wrote, \u201ca Final Club seems the end of earthly ambitions.\u201d John Reed poses as a teenager. By Courtesy of John Reed Additional Papers, 1887-1976 (MS Am 1091.3). Houghton Library, Harvard University. It all hinged on the Institute. For Reed, though, getting in was easier said than done. When the Class of 1910 entered Harvard, it had nearly 700 members. The Institute would select only 100. Reed\u2019s odds were bad from the start. In search of a niche, Reed tried to join the freshman crew team. He committed a significant portion of his freshman year to the task, even staying on campus during holidays to row by himself, but he was the last rower eliminated before the end-of-year Harvard-Yale crew regatta and never technically made the team. Reed\u2019s initial forays into the arts community ended similarly fruitlessly. Though he\u2019d later write books and articles hailed by nations, by the end of his freshman year he hadn\u2019t been granted entry to a single campus publication. \u201cI got to know many fellows to nod to, and a very few intimately; but most of my friends were whirled off and up into prominence, and came to see me no more,\u201d he reminisced in \u201cAlmost Thirty,\u201d \u201cAthletes and musicians and writers and statesmen were emerging from the ranks of the class. The Freshman clubs were forming. And I was out of it all.\u201d Reed was never invited to join the Institute of 1770. He never joined a Waiting Club, he never joined a Final Club, and he never really reached the upper echelons he\u2019d aspired to as a freshman. This exclusion was partially the product of class. Reed hadn\u2019t been born into the eastern elite, and the eastern elite knew it. Advertisement Reed knew it, too. When he was rejected sophomore year for two posts for which he felt he \u201cqualified easily\u201d\u2014an editorial position at The Harvard Crimson and the assistant managership of the Varsity Crew team\u2014he chalked it up to snobbery and walked away bitter. It wasn\u2019t only Reed\u2019s class, though: When Reed\u2019s brother arrived to Harvard two years later, he was invited to join the same organizations that had overlooked his older sibling. The snub was also personal. \u201cThere is a clue to his lack of acceptance, his lack of the quality the British call \u2018clubable,\u2019\u201d wrote his classmate, Edward E. Hunt, class of 1910. \u201cThrough everything he did there ran a strand of the grotesque which turned the most serious event into laughter.\u201d Regardless of its cause, Reed took rejection hard. \u201cThe thought that he could be considered inferior, unworthy of their attention no matter what he did, came as a numbing shock to him,\u201d wrote Richard O\u2019Connor in his biography of Reed, \u201cThe Lost Revolutionary.\u201d The Athlete, the Scholar, and the Activities Man By sophomore year, Reed recalibrated. Rejected by the elites and no longer willing to measure personal success by class or wealth, he found a new strategy for social acceptance: joining as many extracurricular activities as possible. As he saw it, the class was divided into three neat groups: the athlete, the scholar, and the \u201cactivities man.\u201d Reed knew which he wanted to join. Reed speaks to several supporters. In \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs.\" By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library In Reed\u2019s model, athletes represented the pinnacle of the social hierarchy. \u201cThe average undergraduate would rather win his \u201cH\u201d than get Phi Beta Kappa,\u201d he wrote in an essay. He wasn\u2019t wrong: by 1907-08, Reed\u2019s sophomore year, campus athletics had become such a dominant social force that President Eliot became concerned that sports were exhausting players, keeping fans from their studies, and encouraging \u201cthe betting evil.\u201d Despite his initial setbacks on the river, Reed enjoyed moderate athletic success on the field and in the pool. He was a member of the swimming team, captain of the water polo team, and song-leader of the cheerleading squad. A former classmate, the Pulitzer prize-winning left-wing journalist Walter Lippmann, class of 1910, remembered Reed as the star of the cheerleading squad. \u201cHe would stand up alone before a few thousand undergraduates and demonstrate without a quiver of self-consciousness just how a cheer should be given,\u201d Lippmann wrote in the New Republic in 1914. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t like the way his instructions were followed he cursed at the crowd, bullied it, sneered at it. It was a sensational triumph for [John] Reed but wasn\u2019t altogether good form at college.\u201d In the Russian Revolution, the ability to rouse a crowd would serve him well. Advertisement Still, Reed saw the athlete\u2019s position in the campus hierarchy as that of an empty figurehead with no real power. He thought that the student that embodied Harvard\u2019s most traditional values was really \u201cthe scholar:\u201d \u201cHe is studying what the great Harvard men of the past have studied\u2014he is really seeking what Harvard has stood for for three hundred years\u2014Veritas.\u201d Reed himself barely scraped past Harvard\u2019s entrance exams, and he left an undergraduate record dotted with C\u2019s, D\u2019s, and E\u2019s (modern F\u2019s). A self-confessed \u201cindifferent student,\u201d he found the classroom dry and lifeless. \u201cWhy should I have been interested in the stupid education of our time?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe take young soaring imaginations, consumed with curiosity about the life they see all around, and feed them with dead technique.\u201d He wrote a number of his essays on club or scrap stationary, perhaps as a deliberate snub. Though Reed respected Harvard\u2019s undergraduate scholars, he never wanted to befriend or become one. \u201cLong lack of comradeship with any but those of his kind have made him intolerant of frivolity, have dried in him the natural desires and exaltations of youth, and therefore he is misunderstood and despised,\u201d he wrote. That left the \u201cactivities man.\u201d Students active in extracurriculars had the social clout lacked by athletes and the social graces lacked by scholars. They embodied all the virtues a turn-of-the-20th-century \u2018Harvard Man.\u2019 \u201cThey are a community of enthusiasts, men of all trades,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey are dreamers and often poets. Their grades are often very poor mediocre and they subordinate college work to their \u201cactivities\u201d.... They talk a great deal among themselves, exchanging ideas and thoughts, strengthening friendships and learning what real standards there are by which to judge a man.\u201d The activities man was busy, plugged in, a member of all the clubs, an insider. By the time of his graduation, Reed had joined so many extracurriculars that his class bio was longer than his (nonexistent) senior thesis. He managed the Glee Club; he joined the Debating Club; he was a member of such mysteriously named organizations as the Memorial Society, the Round Table, the Symposium, and the Oracle. At various points, Reed was a member of some 16 organizations and teams\u2014an impressive number even by Harvard\u2019s contemporary standard. The Harvard Swimming team's group photo.

A Seat at the Table Amongst these many organizations were a few campus publications. Despite his failed start at the Crimson, Reed became an editor at the Harvard Monthly, a literary magazine where his poems and stories, \u201cjuvenile and imitative though they were, won respect and praise and inspired enthusiastic prophecies,\u201d according to Granville Hicks \u201923. He was also a writer and \u201cIbis\u201d\u2014second-in-command\u2014at the Lampoon. John Reed is seized by policemen. \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs. Lithographs by Lynd Ward\" published by Equinox Press Inc., Pusey Library, Harvard University. By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library Reed was a leader as well as a writer. He had a gift for organizing people and executing visions\u2014and he had no shortage of ideas. Still struggling to reconcile his Portland upbringing with his Cambridge education, he became president of the Western Club. A casual eating club created to defy Harvard\u2019s puritanical social norms, the organization became known for mischief and outrageous practical jokes. As President, Reed sat at the head of every table and introduced diners in increasingly ludicrous ways. Advertisement \u201cGentlemen, the future President of the United States!\u201d he cried when Lippmann joined him one evening. \u201cWhere have you bean?\u201d he shouted at another friend, throwing a handful of beans. Reed didn\u2019t confine his antics to the Western Club. As Hicks reported, over the spring break of his junior year, a debacle involving a series of bars, \u201ca resort of dubious reputation,\u201d and a spontaneous trip to Bermuda resulted in Reed\u2019s \u201crustication\u201d\u2014an archaic punishment based on exile to Concord, Mass. Reed spent the rest of the semester in time-out. When not in Concord, Reed served as President of the Cosmopolitan Club. Founded by Reed on Feb. 12, 1908, the club united Harvard\u2019s international students, entertained foreign dignitaries, and discussed world affairs. It was wildly successful: 53 students joined at its inception, and by Reed\u2019s graduation in the spring of 1910 that number had grown to roughly 200. Reed called it \u201cone of the most important organizations ever formed among the students at Harvard.\u201d Then again, Reed had a taste for hyperbole. It showed up in his rhetoric, marked his prose, and, in the fall of his junior year, inspired the creation of the Dramatic Club. The club provided Harvard\u2019s budding playwrights with a stage. The school offered few opportunities to produce original student theater, and students taking playwriting courses\u2014including Reed and his two co-founders, Edward Sheldon and Hans V. Kaltenborn\u2014chafed at the limitation. Rather than trying to convince an existing troupe to produce student work, they decided to make their own. The Dramatic Club was novel for another reason: it became the first theater group on campus to admit women to its ranks. The decision provoked controversy. Members felt that \u201cif we expected to achieve any social distinction at Harvard with our newly organized club, we simply could not permit the participation of Radcliffe girls,\u201d Kaltenborn recalled in his memoir, \u201cFifty Fabulous Years.\u201d Eventually, these protests were eventually overlooked \u201cin the interest of better drama,\u201d and the Dramatic Club (antecedent of the contemporary Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club) went co-ed. It\u2019s easy to see traces of Reed\u2019s later persona in his early college activities. By junior year, Reed was already an iconoclast, defying social mores and laughing at Harvard authority. He was an idealist, uniting his peers and planning to bring labor justice to the world. He was a leader, screaming at crowds in stadiums and theaters and pitting himself against the status quo. But while he\u2019d turned his eyes from the elites and become the \u201cactivities man\u201d he\u2019d always wanted to be, he was still searching for his cause. \u201cJohn Reed was not a fiery left-winger in those days,\u201d wrote Kaltenborn. \u201cHe was a nonconformist.\u201d Advertisement Senior year, that changed. Infiltrating the Ranks In his final year of college, Reed discovered the Harvard Socialist Club. Founded by two freshmen in 1908, the club\u2019s stated goal was to use the study and spread of socialism to correct the \u201cfundamentally imperfect\u201d state of society. At inception, it had nine members. John Reed speaks to a crowd. In \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs. Lithographs by Lynd Ward\" published by Equinox Press Inc., Pusey Library, Harvard University. By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library Despite its modest size, the Club pledged to permeate the college. As Reed put it, \u201cThey sat not in lofty contempt above the ignorant student body, but mingled with it, learning its sympathies and weakness, used its machinery...\u201d While club members held frequent discussions of their own, often continuing hours after midnight, they attempted to recruit and effect change by infiltrating other campus organizations. This turned out to be an effective strategy. After less than five years, the Socialist Club had between 30 and 50 members. Two years after Reed\u2019s graduation, a senior named Gerard C. Henderson, class of 1912, told the Harvard Graduates\u2019 Magazine that the club\u2019s \u201c...fringes merge imperceptibly into a half-dozen political clubs, some adherents of such leaders as Wilson and La Follette, and others more vaguely representative of insurgency and progressivism.\u201d Reed was never officially a member, but the club still radicalized him. \u201cIt made me, and many others, realize that there was something going on in the dull outside world more thrilling than college activities,\u201d he wrote. Reed\u2019s newfound politics were first evident in his writing. Reed had been writing for the Lampoon for a few years already, but during his senior year his sketches gained a biting political edge they\u2019d lacked before. In one Lampoon editorial, Reed mocked Harvard\u2019s old money and gave advice to young men seeking to boost their pedigrees. \u201cHyphens are of immense value\u2014remember that anyone will always be glad to lend money to an Endicott-Sears-Cabot, a Wendell-Wendell, or a Trumbull-Peabody,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf a child is too late to corral a Back Bay Brahman for a progenitor, let him seize upon a self-made man who has made a good job of it. Money will finally land anyone among the Captains of Society.\u201d Though Reed mocked them, the elite were beginning to notice him. In the spring of Reed\u2019s senior year, he was offered membership in the Hasty Pudding. The Pudding was one of the most exclusive social organizations on campus, made up almost entirely of members of Waiting and Final Clubs, and to Reed the invitation must have seemed like a baffling reversal on the part of the aristocracy. Certainly, he had distinguished himself in the years since he\u2019d first been overlooked, but he was still the same brash Westerner he\u2019d always been. Advertisement In truth, the Hasty Pudding didn\u2019t have much of an option. It was nearly time for the club\u2019s annual musical, and none of its existing members\u2014who had been selected on the basis of social status\u2014felt capable of writing lyrics. Reed was a necessary outside hire, and he knew it. The Hasty Pudding put on an uncharacteristically subversive show that year. \u201cJust insist that your aunt was a Cabot, And your grandmother\u2019s real name was Weld. Try hard to make rudeness a habit, And be careful with whom you\u2019re beheld.\u201d Revolution in the Yard Suddenly, Reed was a \u201cclub man.\u201d A critical one, certainly, but a club man all the same. And as much as he tried to suppress it, he found satisfaction in the title. That satisfaction became evident at the end of his senior year. John Reed sits in a prison cell. In \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs. Lithographs by Lynd Ward\" published by Equinox Press Inc., Pusey Library, Harvard University. By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library In 1910, Harvard\u2019s rich lived in glamorous private apartments on Mt. Auburn Street; the poor lived in dorms in Harvard Yard. This dichotomy influenced more than sleeping arrangements: Residents of the Street controlled most aspects of undergraduate life, and overwhelmingly filled class offices at graduation. That year, Reed was their nominee for Ivy Orator. Then, the Yard revolted. In an explosion of resentment that had been brewing since freshman fall, the Yard refused to accept the Street\u2019s nominations for class office. Residents of the Yard circulated petitions and submitted their own nominees instead. Advertisement Reed was stuck. He already considered himself a man of the people, but aligning himself with the Yard would undo all of his recent social progress. So he ran on behalf of the Street, and like almost every other Street candidate, he lost. There had been a revolution, and he was on the wrong side. Reed realized his mistake once it was already too late. Shortly after his graduation, he wrote a sweeping 73-page tract called \u201cThe Harvard Renaissance,\u201d in which he describes the rise of socialism at the college. In that text, he calls the victory of the Yard \u201ca vote of the unrepresented majority against its traditional leaders.\u201d It is the story of the Marxist struggle in all but name. College was Reed\u2019s first introduction to the vapid nature of the privileged class. \u201cThe more I met the college aristocrats, the more their cold cruel stupidity repelled me,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. \u201cI began to pity them for their lack of imagination, and the narrowness of their glittering lives\u2014clubs, athletics, society. \u201cCollege is like the world; outside there is the same class of people, dull and sated and blind.\u201d Three years later, Reed spoke on behalf of silk workers in Paterson, N.J., earning himself his first jail term and a reputation as a radical communist. Frustrated but not deterred, he allied himself with the trade union International Workers of the World and organized thousands of workers into a strike benefit in Madison Square Garden. By the late 1910s, the American government feared him. The USSR hailed him as a genius and taught his name in schools. Richard M. Nixon didn\u2019t call Harvard \u201cthe Kremlin on the Charles\u201d for nothing. John Reed might have practiced socialism in New York City and St. Petersburg, but he learned it in the Yard. Club Man at Last Reed\u2019s life was prime martyr material, and Harvard\u2019s later left-wingers ate it up\u2014\u201cJohn Reed Clubs\u201d began popping up across the United States only shortly after the man\u2019s death. Harvard had a branch, too. Calling itself a Marxist study and action group, the Harvard John Reed Society was founded in 1932 by \u201ca group of undergraduates attracted by the personality of John Reed and interested in studying sciettific [sic] socialism, the cause for which he gave his life.\u201d Though it was never widely popular, the club lingered for years. In 1943, it even published several issues of a magazine, The Harvard Vanguard. John Reed speaks to supporters. In \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs. Lithographs by Lynd Ward\" published by Equinox Press Inc., Pusey Library, Harvard University. By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library Advertisement Reed\u2019s mother did not approve. Charlotte J. Reed was always upset by John Reed Clubs\u2014she found them exploitative. Reed might have felt the same way. \u201cIn view of what has happened in Russia since the Revolution, I am certain that he would not have tolerated the use of his name as a means of ensnaring idealistic American youth into the Communist party,\u201d Reed\u2019s old friend and Dramatic Club co-founder Hans V. Kaltenborn, class of 1909, reflected in \u201cFifty Fabulous Years.\u201d \u201cThat is what is being done at Harvard today. The John Reed Society has been little more than a cover for Communist party activities at Harvard since its inception.\u201d It wasn\u2019t safe to join a club with such a reputation in McCarthy-era America. In 1950, the John Reed Society went underground. According to The Boston Herald, the club had applied for a meeting room in the spring of 1950, and the administration had accepted. But when Dean Robert A. Watson reached out the following fall, he got crickets. No one would come forward to take the key. \u201cLast year\u2019s president, Donald M. Long of New York, is no longer at Harvard, for academic reasons,\u201d wrote the Herald. \u201cLast year\u2019s vice-president, Philip H. Ennis, said he is no longer associated with the club.

Sockol \u201951, a senior who \u201cidentified himself as spokesman for the group,\u201d wrote to The Boston Traveler. Though the university had allowed the club to continue functioning, he said, students feared retaliation. The club was dead. And despite a smattering of radical left-leaning organizations that popped up throughout the \u201960s and later\u2014the Young Socialist Alliance, the Young People\u2019s Socialist League, the Democratic Socialists of America\u2014it stayed dead. Signs of Life In 2016, the radical left has re-entered the conversation. Bernie Sanders, a presidential nominee who calls himself a \u201cdemocratic socialist,\u201d is experiencing widespread success, particularly among young voters. In the Iowa primary, 84 percent of Democratic voters aged 17-29 supported Sanders. In the New Hampshire primary, that number was 83 percent. In a recent Chegg study of 1,363 college students, 6 percent self-identified as socialists. Is John Reed\u2019s crusade experiencing a revival? In \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs. Lithographs by Lynd Ward\" published by Equinox Press Inc., Pusey Library, Harvard University. By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library Advertisement He Li \u201916, president of Harvard Students for Bernie, considers it a question of semantics. \u201cObviously Bernie calls himself a democratic socialist, [but] what\u2019s more important to everybody I\u2019ve talked to are his specific policies and what he stands for,\u201d Li said. \u201cThe label of socialist, that comes second.\u201d Others feel differently. \u201cOne of the long-lasting impacts of Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign is the way that\u2026 he\u2019s been able to change the conversation around \u201cthe s-word,\u201d Tyrik LaCruise \u201917, an avid Sanders supporter, said. \u201cRunning as a democratic socialist, people are like \u2018Whoa, wait a second. It\u2019s not as dirty as I thought. The post office is socialism. Public schools? Socialism. We have roads. That\u2019s socialism.\u2019\u201d Paul Adler, a lecturer in Harvard\u2019s History and Literature concentration, is intrigued by that reclamation. \u201cThe Sanders phenomenon is blowing my mind.... He calls himself a socialist. According to the polls of Democratic party voters, a lot of people are OK calling themselves socialists,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s been enough time since the Cold War that there can be a renewed attempt at all this.\u201d If the Cold War and the Red Scare really are beginning to fade from cultural memory, then contemporary students might find themselves facing a form of socialism in some ways analogous to the one that faced Reed. After all, Reed grew up in a pre-Soviet world. As Adler pointed out, \u201cPeople were scared of socialism and said negative things about it, but it had more a connotation of scary anarchy than totalitarianism.\u201d The same could be said today. In that case, perhaps we should take a close look at John Reed. His life reads like a short novel, gripping in its intensity and poignant in its brevity. He believed in an ideal, and it drove him through college, across Europe, and into the ground before he turned 33. Adler suggests that we view the revolutionary as simultaneous warning and inspiration. \u201cI think the most truthful interpretation is that [Reed] encompasses both,\u201d said Adler. \u201cHe\u2019s a warning about the dangers of political idealism, about having a philosophy that the ends justify the means. But he\u2019s also an inspiration about getting down in the muck and trying to create some sort of better society.\u201d Tags CollegeScrutinyPoliticsFront Feature Advertisement Advertisement The Harvard Crimson The University Daily, Est. 1873\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 The Harvard Crimson, Inc.\n\nStill, Reed attended some of the most expensive schools on the East Coast. At 16, he left Portland for a New Jersey boarding school, and in the fall of 1906 he enrolled at Harvard College. A few years later, his brother, Harry, followed. This prestigious education came at both a financial and an emotional cost: as Reed reminisced a decade later, \u201cWe never knew until later how much our mother and father denied themselves that we might go, and how [my father] poured out his life that we might live like rich men\u2019s sons.\u201d\n\nReed might have been able to afford the cost of tuition, but he could not hide his Western, middle-class roots: Harvard had an excellent nose for those masquerading as \u201crich men\u2019s sons.\u201d\n\nWilliam James described students like Reed in his 1903 essay \u201cThe True Harvard.\u201d Those who arrived \u201cfrom the remotest outskirts of our country, without introductions, without school affiliations,\u201d had no place in Harvard\u2019s social spaces, he said. \u201cThey seldom or never darken the doors of the Pudding or the Porcellian.\u201d\n\nAs John M. Brown \u201923 wrote in the Harvard Alumni Bulletin, the Harvard of 1906 was a place of \u201cpoor boys and rich boys; those favored because they were Brahmin-born and others penalized because they were not.\u201d Most of Reed\u2019s new peers had attended elite East Coast prep schools, and considered \u201cnew money\u201d\u2014or, worse, no money\u2014beneath them. A boisterous nobody from Portland hardly stood a chance.\n\nThis never deterred Reed. A childhood on the (relative) social margins had conditioned him to value popularity, and a natural competitive instinct drove him to compete for it. He developed a fascination with Harvard\u2019s aristocracy, and when he arrived on campus in the fall of 1906 he sought to join it.\n\n\u201cA furious energy drove me to all kinds of bodily and mental exercise, without any particular direction,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. \u201cI was increasingly active and restless, more ambitious of place and power, less exalted, scattering myself in a hundred different directions\u2026\u201d He wanted to be a poet. He wanted to be a novelist. He wanted to be a lover, and a fighter, and a rebel. More than anything else, he wanted to be accepted.\n\n\u201cDuring my freshman year I used to pray to be liked, to have friends, to be popular with the crowd,\u201d Reed wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Waiting Game\n\nTo a lonely Harvard freshman at the turn of the twentieth century, popularity meant joining a Final Club.\n\nThe punch process began with admission to the Institute of 1770, an exclusive social organization which selected 100 men from the sophomore class each year and named them \u201cthe socially elect.\u201d Becoming a member of the Institute meant prestige; it meant status; most of all, it meant eligibility for the next tier of exclusive social organizations, the Waiting Clubs. After election to a Waiting Club, juniors and seniors were eligible for an invitation to a Final Club\u2014the apex of the whole system, and the playground of Harvard\u2019s elite.\n\n\u201cTo the ordinary freshman before whose eyes the plum of the Institute is dangled,\u201d Reed wrote, \u201ca Final Club seems the end of earthly ambitions.\u201d\n\nJohn Reed poses as a teenager. By Courtesy of John Reed Additional Papers, 1887-1976 (MS Am 1091.3). Houghton Library, Harvard University. It all hinged on the Institute. For Reed, though, getting in was easier said than done. When the Class of 1910 entered Harvard, it had nearly 700 members. The Institute would select only 100. Reed\u2019s odds were bad from the start. In search of a niche, Reed tried to join the freshman crew team. He committed a significant portion of his freshman year to the task, even staying on campus during holidays to row by himself, but he was the last rower eliminated before the end-of-year Harvard-Yale crew regatta and never technically made the team. Reed\u2019s initial forays into the arts community ended similarly fruitlessly. Though he\u2019d later write books and articles hailed by nations, by the end of his freshman year he hadn\u2019t been granted entry to a single campus publication. \u201cI got to know many fellows to nod to, and a very few intimately; but most of my friends were whirled off and up into prominence, and came to see me no more,\u201d he reminisced in \u201cAlmost Thirty,\u201d \u201cAthletes and musicians and writers and statesmen were emerging from the ranks of the class. The Freshman clubs were forming. And I was out of it all.\u201d Reed was never invited to join the Institute of 1770. He never joined a Waiting Club, he never joined a Final Club, and he never really reached the upper echelons he\u2019d aspired to as a freshman. This exclusion was partially the product of class. Reed hadn\u2019t been born into the eastern elite, and the eastern elite knew it. Advertisement Reed knew it, too. When he was rejected sophomore year for two posts for which he felt he \u201cqualified easily\u201d\u2014an editorial position at The Harvard Crimson and the assistant managership of the Varsity Crew team\u2014he chalked it up to snobbery and walked away bitter. It wasn\u2019t only Reed\u2019s class, though: When Reed\u2019s brother arrived to Harvard two years later, he was invited to join the same organizations that had overlooked his older sibling. The snub was also personal. \u201cThere is a clue to his lack of acceptance, his lack of the quality the British call \u2018clubable,\u2019\u201d wrote his classmate, Edward E. Hunt, class of 1910. \u201cThrough everything he did there ran a strand of the grotesque which turned the most serious event into laughter.\u201d Regardless of its cause, Reed took rejection hard. \u201cThe thought that he could be considered inferior, unworthy of their attention no matter what he did, came as a numbing shock to him,\u201d wrote Richard O\u2019Connor in his biography of Reed, \u201cThe Lost Revolutionary.\u201d The Athlete, the Scholar, and the Activities Man By sophomore year, Reed recalibrated. Rejected by the elites and no longer willing to measure personal success by class or wealth, he found a new strategy for social acceptance: joining as many extracurricular activities as possible. As he saw it, the class was divided into three neat groups: the athlete, the scholar, and the \u201cactivities man.\u201d Reed knew which he wanted to join. Reed speaks to several supporters. In \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs.\" By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library In Reed\u2019s model, athletes represented the pinnacle of the social hierarchy. \u201cThe average undergraduate would rather win his \u201cH\u201d than get Phi Beta Kappa,\u201d he wrote in an essay. He wasn\u2019t wrong: by 1907-08, Reed\u2019s sophomore year, campus athletics had become such a dominant social force that President Eliot became concerned that sports were exhausting players, keeping fans from their studies, and encouraging \u201cthe betting evil.\u201d Despite his initial setbacks on the river, Reed enjoyed moderate athletic success on the field and in the pool. He was a member of the swimming team, captain of the water polo team, and song-leader of the cheerleading squad. A former classmate, the Pulitzer prize-winning left-wing journalist Walter Lippmann, class of 1910, remembered Reed as the star of the cheerleading squad. \u201cHe would stand up alone before a few thousand undergraduates and demonstrate without a quiver of self-consciousness just how a cheer should be given,\u201d Lippmann wrote in the New Republic in 1914. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t like the way his instructions were followed he cursed at the crowd, bullied it, sneered at it. It was a sensational triumph for [John] Reed but wasn\u2019t altogether good form at college.\u201d In the Russian Revolution, the ability to rouse a crowd would serve him well. Advertisement Still, Reed saw the athlete\u2019s position in the campus hierarchy as that of an empty figurehead with no real power. He thought that the student that embodied Harvard\u2019s most traditional values was really \u201cthe scholar:\u201d \u201cHe is studying what the great Harvard men of the past have studied\u2014he is really seeking what Harvard has stood for for three hundred years\u2014Veritas.\u201d Reed himself barely scraped past Harvard\u2019s entrance exams, and he left an undergraduate record dotted with C\u2019s, D\u2019s, and E\u2019s (modern F\u2019s). A self-confessed \u201cindifferent student,\u201d he found the classroom dry and lifeless. \u201cWhy should I have been interested in the stupid education of our time?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe take young soaring imaginations, consumed with curiosity about the life they see all around, and feed them with dead technique.\u201d He wrote a number of his essays on club or scrap stationary, perhaps as a deliberate snub. Though Reed respected Harvard\u2019s undergraduate scholars, he never wanted to befriend or become one. \u201cLong lack of comradeship with any but those of his kind have made him intolerant of frivolity, have dried in him the natural desires and exaltations of youth, and therefore he is misunderstood and despised,\u201d he wrote. That left the \u201cactivities man.\u201d Students active in extracurriculars had the social clout lacked by athletes and the social graces lacked by scholars. They embodied all the virtues a turn-of-the-20th-century \u2018Harvard Man.\u2019 \u201cThey are a community of enthusiasts, men of all trades,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey are dreamers and often poets. Their grades are often very poor mediocre and they subordinate college work to their \u201cactivities\u201d.... They talk a great deal among themselves, exchanging ideas and thoughts, strengthening friendships and learning what real standards there are by which to judge a man.\u201d The activities man was busy, plugged in, a member of all the clubs, an insider. By the time of his graduation, Reed had joined so many extracurriculars that his class bio was longer than his (nonexistent) senior thesis. He managed the Glee Club; he joined the Debating Club; he was a member of such mysteriously named organizations as the Memorial Society, the Round Table, the Symposium, and the Oracle. At various points, Reed was a member of some 16 organizations and teams\u2014an impressive number even by Harvard\u2019s contemporary standard. The Harvard Swimming team's group photo. Reed is in the back row, standing fifth from the left. By Courtesy of John Reed Additional Papers, 1887-1976 (MS Am 1091.3). Houghton Library, Harvard University. Reed was the activities man. A Seat at the Table Amongst these many organizations were a few campus publications. Despite his failed start at the Crimson, Reed became an editor at the Harvard Monthly, a literary magazine where his poems and stories, \u201cjuvenile and imitative though they were, won respect and praise and inspired enthusiastic prophecies,\u201d according to Granville Hicks \u201923. He was also a writer and \u201cIbis\u201d\u2014second-in-command\u2014at the Lampoon. John Reed is seized by policemen. \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs. Lithographs by Lynd Ward\" published by Equinox Press Inc., Pusey Library, Harvard University. By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library Reed was a leader as well as a writer. He had a gift for organizing people and executing visions\u2014and he had no shortage of ideas. Still struggling to reconcile his Portland upbringing with his Cambridge education, he became president of the Western Club. A casual eating club created to defy Harvard\u2019s puritanical social norms, the organization became known for mischief and outrageous practical jokes. As President, Reed sat at the head of every table and introduced diners in increasingly ludicrous ways. Advertisement \u201cGentlemen, the future President of the United States!\u201d he cried when Lippmann joined him one evening. \u201cWhere have you bean?\u201d he shouted at another friend, throwing a handful of beans. Reed didn\u2019t confine his antics to the Western Club. As Hicks reported, over the spring break of his junior year, a debacle involving a series of bars, \u201ca resort of dubious reputation,\u201d and a spontaneous trip to Bermuda resulted in Reed\u2019s \u201crustication\u201d\u2014an archaic punishment based on exile to Concord, Mass. Reed spent the rest of the semester in time-out. When not in Concord, Reed served as President of the Cosmopolitan Club. Founded by Reed on Feb. 12, 1908, the club united Harvard\u2019s international students, entertained foreign dignitaries, and discussed world affairs. It was wildly successful: 53 students joined at its inception, and by Reed\u2019s graduation in the spring of 1910 that number had grown to roughly 200. Reed called it \u201cone of the most important organizations ever formed among the students at Harvard.\u201d Then again, Reed had a taste for hyperbole. It showed up in his rhetoric, marked his prose, and, in the fall of his junior year, inspired the creation of the Dramatic Club. The club provided Harvard\u2019s budding playwrights with a stage. The school offered few opportunities to produce original student theater, and students taking playwriting courses\u2014including Reed and his two co-founders, Edward Sheldon and Hans V. Kaltenborn\u2014chafed at the limitation. Rather than trying to convince an existing troupe to produce student work, they decided to make their own. The Dramatic Club was novel for another reason: it became the first theater group on campus to admit women to its ranks. The decision provoked controversy. Members felt that \u201cif we expected to achieve any social distinction at Harvard with our newly organized club, we simply could not permit the participation of Radcliffe girls,\u201d Kaltenborn recalled in his memoir, \u201cFifty Fabulous Years.\u201d Eventually, these protests were eventually overlooked \u201cin the interest of better drama,\u201d and the Dramatic Club (antecedent of the contemporary Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club) went co-ed. It\u2019s easy to see traces of Reed\u2019s later persona in his early college activities. By junior year, Reed was already an iconoclast, defying social mores and laughing at Harvard authority. He was an idealist, uniting his peers and planning to bring labor justice to the world. He was a leader, screaming at crowds in stadiums and theaters and pitting himself against the status quo. But while he\u2019d turned his eyes from the elites and become the \u201cactivities man\u201d he\u2019d always wanted to be, he was still searching for his cause. \u201cJohn Reed was not a fiery left-winger in those days,\u201d wrote Kaltenborn. \u201cHe was a nonconformist.\u201d Advertisement Senior year, that changed. Infiltrating the Ranks In his final year of college, Reed discovered the Harvard Socialist Club. Founded by two freshmen in 1908, the club\u2019s stated goal was to use the study and spread of socialism to correct the \u201cfundamentally imperfect\u201d state of society. At inception, it had nine members. John Reed speaks to a crowd. In \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs. Lithographs by Lynd Ward\" published by Equinox Press Inc., Pusey Library, Harvard University. By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library Despite its modest size, the Club pledged to permeate the college. As Reed put it, \u201cThey sat not in lofty contempt above the ignorant student body, but mingled with it, learning its sympathies and weakness, used its machinery...\u201d While club members held frequent discussions of their own, often continuing hours after midnight, they attempted to recruit and effect change by infiltrating other campus organizations. This turned out to be an effective strategy. After less than five years, the Socialist Club had between 30 and 50 members. Two years after Reed\u2019s graduation, a senior named Gerard C. Henderson, class of 1912, told the Harvard Graduates\u2019 Magazine that the club\u2019s \u201c...fringes merge imperceptibly into a half-dozen political clubs, some adherents of such leaders as Wilson and La Follette, and others more vaguely representative of insurgency and progressivism.\u201d Reed was never officially a member, but the club still radicalized him. \u201cIt made me, and many others, realize that there was something going on in the dull outside world more thrilling than college activities,\u201d he wrote. Reed\u2019s newfound politics were first evident in his writing. Reed had been writing for the Lampoon for a few years already, but during his senior year his sketches gained a biting political edge they\u2019d lacked before. In one Lampoon editorial, Reed mocked Harvard\u2019s old money and gave advice to young men seeking to boost their pedigrees. \u201cHyphens are of immense value\u2014remember that anyone will always be glad to lend money to an Endicott-Sears-Cabot, a Wendell-Wendell, or a Trumbull-Peabody,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf a child is too late to corral a Back Bay Brahman for a progenitor, let him seize upon a self-made man who has made a good job of it. Money will finally land anyone among the Captains of Society.\u201d Though Reed mocked them, the elite were beginning to notice him. In the spring of Reed\u2019s senior year, he was offered membership in the Hasty Pudding. The Pudding was one of the most exclusive social organizations on campus, made up almost entirely of members of Waiting and Final Clubs, and to Reed the invitation must have seemed like a baffling reversal on the part of the aristocracy. Certainly, he had distinguished himself in the years since he\u2019d first been overlooked, but he was still the same brash Westerner he\u2019d always been. Advertisement In truth, the Hasty Pudding didn\u2019t have much of an option. It was nearly time for the club\u2019s annual musical, and none of its existing members\u2014who had been selected on the basis of social status\u2014felt capable of writing lyrics. Reed was a necessary outside hire, and he knew it. The Hasty Pudding put on an uncharacteristically subversive show that year. \u201cJust insist that your aunt was a Cabot, And your grandmother\u2019s real name was Weld. Try hard to make rudeness a habit, And be careful with whom you\u2019re beheld.\u201d Revolution in the Yard Suddenly, Reed was a \u201cclub man.\u201d A critical one, certainly, but a club man all the same. And as much as he tried to suppress it, he found satisfaction in the title. That satisfaction became evident at the end of his senior year. John Reed sits in a prison cell. In \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs. Lithographs by Lynd Ward\" published by Equinox Press Inc., Pusey Library, Harvard University. By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library In 1910, Harvard\u2019s rich lived in glamorous private apartments on Mt. Auburn Street; the poor lived in dorms in Harvard Yard. This dichotomy influenced more than sleeping arrangements: Residents of the Street controlled most aspects of undergraduate life, and overwhelmingly filled class offices at graduation. That year, Reed was their nominee for Ivy Orator. Then, the Yard revolted. In an explosion of resentment that had been brewing since freshman fall, the Yard refused to accept the Street\u2019s nominations for class office. Residents of the Yard circulated petitions and submitted their own nominees instead. Advertisement Reed was stuck. He already considered himself a man of the people, but aligning himself with the Yard would undo all of his recent social progress. So he ran on behalf of the Street, and like almost every other Street candidate, he lost. There had been a revolution, and he was on the wrong side. Reed realized his mistake once it was already too late. Shortly after his graduation, he wrote a sweeping 73-page tract called \u201cThe Harvard Renaissance,\u201d in which he describes the rise of socialism at the college. In that text, he calls the victory of the Yard \u201ca vote of the unrepresented majority against its traditional leaders.\u201d It is the story of the Marxist struggle in all but name. College was Reed\u2019s first introduction to the vapid nature of the privileged class. \u201cThe more I met the college aristocrats, the more their cold cruel stupidity repelled me,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. \u201cI began to pity them for their lack of imagination, and the narrowness of their glittering lives\u2014clubs, athletics, society. \u201cCollege is like the world; outside there is the same class of people, dull and sated and blind.\u201d Three years later, Reed spoke on behalf of silk workers in Paterson, N.J., earning himself his first jail term and a reputation as a radical communist. Frustrated but not deterred, he allied himself with the trade union International Workers of the World and organized thousands of workers into a strike benefit in Madison Square Garden. By the late 1910s, the American government feared him. The USSR hailed him as a genius and taught his name in schools. Richard M. Nixon didn\u2019t call Harvard \u201cthe Kremlin on the Charles\u201d for nothing. John Reed might have practiced socialism in New York City and St. Petersburg, but he learned it in the Yard. Club Man at Last Reed\u2019s life was prime martyr material, and Harvard\u2019s later left-wingers ate it up\u2014\u201cJohn Reed Clubs\u201d began popping up across the United States only shortly after the man\u2019s death. Harvard had a branch, too. Calling itself a Marxist study and action group, the Harvard John Reed Society was founded in 1932 by \u201ca group of undergraduates attracted by the personality of John Reed and interested in studying sciettific [sic] socialism, the cause for which he gave his life.\u201d Though it was never widely popular, the club lingered for years. In 1943, it even published several issues of a magazine, The Harvard Vanguard. John Reed speaks to supporters. In \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs. Lithographs by Lynd Ward\" published by Equinox Press Inc., Pusey Library, Harvard University. By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library Advertisement Reed\u2019s mother did not approve. Charlotte J. Reed was always upset by John Reed Clubs\u2014she found them exploitative. Reed might have felt the same way. \u201cIn view of what has happened in Russia since the Revolution, I am certain that he would not have tolerated the use of his name as a means of ensnaring idealistic American youth into the Communist party,\u201d Reed\u2019s old friend and Dramatic Club co-founder Hans V. Kaltenborn, class of 1909, reflected in \u201cFifty Fabulous Years.\u201d \u201cThat is what is being done at Harvard today. The John Reed Society has been little more than a cover for Communist party activities at Harvard since its inception.\u201d It wasn\u2019t safe to join a club with such a reputation in McCarthy-era America. In 1950, the John Reed Society went underground. According to The Boston Herald, the club had applied for a meeting room in the spring of 1950, and the administration had accepted. But when Dean Robert A. Watson reached out the following fall, he got crickets. No one would come forward to take the key. \u201cLast year\u2019s president, Donald M. Long of New York, is no longer at Harvard, for academic reasons,\u201d wrote the Herald. \u201cLast year\u2019s vice-president, Philip H. Ennis, said he is no longer associated with the club. Nobody else admits association.\u201d Harvard assured the public that it had not shut down the club, but students were suspicious. Arthur J. Sockol \u201951, a senior who \u201cidentified himself as spokesman for the group,\u201d wrote to The Boston Traveler. Though the university had allowed the club to continue functioning, he said, students feared retaliation. The club was dead. And despite a smattering of radical left-leaning organizations that popped up throughout the \u201960s and later\u2014the Young Socialist Alliance, the Young People\u2019s Socialist League, the Democratic Socialists of America\u2014it stayed dead. Signs of Life In 2016, the radical left has re-entered the conversation. Bernie Sanders, a presidential nominee who calls himself a \u201cdemocratic socialist,\u201d is experiencing widespread success, particularly among young voters. In the Iowa primary, 84 percent of Democratic voters aged 17-29 supported Sanders. In the New Hampshire primary, that number was 83 percent. In a recent Chegg study of 1,363 college students, 6 percent self-identified as socialists. Is John Reed\u2019s crusade experiencing a revival? In \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs. Lithographs by Lynd Ward\" published by Equinox Press Inc., Pusey Library, Harvard University.

According to the polls of Democratic party voters, a lot of people are OK calling themselves socialists,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s been enough time since the Cold War that there can be a renewed attempt at all this.\u201d If the Cold War and the Red Scare really are beginning to fade from cultural memory, then contemporary students might find themselves facing a form of socialism in some ways analogous to the one that faced Reed. After all, Reed grew up in a pre-Soviet world. As Adler pointed out, \u201cPeople were scared of socialism and said negative things about it, but it had more a connotation of scary anarchy than totalitarianism.\u201d The same could be said today. In that case, perhaps we should take a close look at John Reed. His life reads like a short novel, gripping in its intensity and poignant in its brevity. He believed in an ideal, and it drove him through college, across Europe, and into the ground before he turned 33. Adler suggests that we view the revolutionary as simultaneous warning and inspiration. \u201cI think the most truthful interpretation is that [Reed] encompasses both,\u201d said Adler. \u201cHe\u2019s a warning about the dangers of political idealism, about having a philosophy that the ends justify the means. But he\u2019s also an inspiration about getting down in the muck and trying to create some sort of better society.\u201d Tags CollegeScrutinyPoliticsFront Feature Advertisement Advertisement The Harvard Crimson The University Daily, Est. 1873\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 The Harvard Crimson, Inc.\n\nIt all hinged on the Institute. For Reed, though, getting in was easier said than done. When the Class of 1910 entered Harvard, it had nearly 700 members. The Institute would select only 100. Reed\u2019s odds were bad from the start.\n\nIn search of a niche, Reed tried to join the freshman crew team. He committed a significant portion of his freshman year to the task, even staying on campus during holidays to row by himself, but he was the last rower eliminated before the end-of-year Harvard-Yale crew regatta and never technically made the team.\n\nReed\u2019s initial forays into the arts community ended similarly fruitlessly. Though he\u2019d later write books and articles hailed by nations, by the end of his freshman year he hadn\u2019t been granted entry to a single campus publication.\n\n\u201cI got to know many fellows to nod to, and a very few intimately; but most of my friends were whirled off and up into prominence, and came to see me no more,\u201d he reminisced in \u201cAlmost Thirty,\u201d \u201cAthletes and musicians and writers and statesmen were emerging from the ranks of the class. The Freshman clubs were forming. And I was out of it all.\u201d\n\nReed was never invited to join the Institute of 1770. He never joined a Waiting Club, he never joined a Final Club, and he never really reached the upper echelons he\u2019d aspired to as a freshman.\n\nThis exclusion was partially the product of class. Reed hadn\u2019t been born into the eastern elite, and the eastern elite knew it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReed knew it, too. When he was rejected sophomore year for two posts for which he felt he \u201cqualified easily\u201d\u2014an editorial position at The Harvard Crimson and the assistant managership of the Varsity Crew team\u2014he chalked it up to snobbery and walked away bitter.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only Reed\u2019s class, though: When Reed\u2019s brother arrived to Harvard two years later, he was invited to join the same organizations that had overlooked his older sibling. The snub was also personal.\n\n\u201cThere is a clue to his lack of acceptance, his lack of the quality the British call \u2018clubable,\u2019\u201d wrote his classmate, Edward E. Hunt, class of 1910. \u201cThrough everything he did there ran a strand of the grotesque which turned the most serious event into laughter.\u201d\n\nRegardless of its cause, Reed took rejection hard. \u201cThe thought that he could be considered inferior, unworthy of their attention no matter what he did, came as a numbing shock to him,\u201d wrote Richard O\u2019Connor in his biography of Reed, \u201cThe Lost Revolutionary.\u201d\n\nThe Athlete, the Scholar, and the Activities Man\n\nBy sophomore year, Reed recalibrated. Rejected by the elites and no longer willing to measure personal success by class or wealth, he found a new strategy for social acceptance: joining as many extracurricular activities as possible. As he saw it, the class was divided into three neat groups: the athlete, the scholar, and the \u201cactivities man.\u201d Reed knew which he wanted to join.\n\nReed speaks to several supporters. In \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs.\" By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library In Reed\u2019s model, athletes represented the pinnacle of the social hierarchy. \u201cThe average undergraduate would rather win his \u201cH\u201d than get Phi Beta Kappa,\u201d he wrote in an essay. He wasn\u2019t wrong: by 1907-08, Reed\u2019s sophomore year, campus athletics had become such a dominant social force that President Eliot became concerned that sports were exhausting players, keeping fans from their studies, and encouraging \u201cthe betting evil.\u201d Despite his initial setbacks on the river, Reed enjoyed moderate athletic success on the field and in the pool. He was a member of the swimming team, captain of the water polo team, and song-leader of the cheerleading squad. A former classmate, the Pulitzer prize-winning left-wing journalist Walter Lippmann, class of 1910, remembered Reed as the star of the cheerleading squad. \u201cHe would stand up alone before a few thousand undergraduates and demonstrate without a quiver of self-consciousness just how a cheer should be given,\u201d Lippmann wrote in the New Republic in 1914. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t like the way his instructions were followed he cursed at the crowd, bullied it, sneered at it. It was a sensational triumph for [John] Reed but wasn\u2019t altogether good form at college.\u201d In the Russian Revolution, the ability to rouse a crowd would serve him well. Advertisement Still, Reed saw the athlete\u2019s position in the campus hierarchy as that of an empty figurehead with no real power. He thought that the student that embodied Harvard\u2019s most traditional values was really \u201cthe scholar:\u201d \u201cHe is studying what the great Harvard men of the past have studied\u2014he is really seeking what Harvard has stood for for three hundred years\u2014Veritas.\u201d Reed himself barely scraped past Harvard\u2019s entrance exams, and he left an undergraduate record dotted with C\u2019s, D\u2019s, and E\u2019s (modern F\u2019s). A self-confessed \u201cindifferent student,\u201d he found the classroom dry and lifeless. \u201cWhy should I have been interested in the stupid education of our time?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe take young soaring imaginations, consumed with curiosity about the life they see all around, and feed them with dead technique.\u201d He wrote a number of his essays on club or scrap stationary, perhaps as a deliberate snub. Though Reed respected Harvard\u2019s undergraduate scholars, he never wanted to befriend or become one. \u201cLong lack of comradeship with any but those of his kind have made him intolerant of frivolity, have dried in him the natural desires and exaltations of youth, and therefore he is misunderstood and despised,\u201d he wrote. That left the \u201cactivities man.\u201d Students active in extracurriculars had the social clout lacked by athletes and the social graces lacked by scholars. They embodied all the virtues a turn-of-the-20th-century \u2018Harvard Man.\u2019 \u201cThey are a community of enthusiasts, men of all trades,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey are dreamers and often poets. Their grades are often very poor mediocre and they subordinate college work to their \u201cactivities\u201d.... They talk a great deal among themselves, exchanging ideas and thoughts, strengthening friendships and learning what real standards there are by which to judge a man.\u201d The activities man was busy, plugged in, a member of all the clubs, an insider. By the time of his graduation, Reed had joined so many extracurriculars that his class bio was longer than his (nonexistent) senior thesis. He managed the Glee Club; he joined the Debating Club; he was a member of such mysteriously named organizations as the Memorial Society, the Round Table, the Symposium, and the Oracle. At various points, Reed was a member of some 16 organizations and teams\u2014an impressive number even by Harvard\u2019s contemporary standard. The Harvard Swimming team's group photo.

A Seat at the Table Amongst these many organizations were a few campus publications. Despite his failed start at the Crimson, Reed became an editor at the Harvard Monthly, a literary magazine where his poems and stories, \u201cjuvenile and imitative though they were, won respect and praise and inspired enthusiastic prophecies,\u201d according to Granville Hicks \u201923. He was also a writer and \u201cIbis\u201d\u2014second-in-command\u2014at the Lampoon. John Reed is seized by policemen. \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs. Lithographs by Lynd Ward\" published by Equinox Press Inc., Pusey Library, Harvard University. By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library Reed was a leader as well as a writer. He had a gift for organizing people and executing visions\u2014and he had no shortage of ideas. Still struggling to reconcile his Portland upbringing with his Cambridge education, he became president of the Western Club. A casual eating club created to defy Harvard\u2019s puritanical social norms, the organization became known for mischief and outrageous practical jokes. As President, Reed sat at the head of every table and introduced diners in increasingly ludicrous ways. Advertisement \u201cGentlemen, the future President of the United States!\u201d he cried when Lippmann joined him one evening. \u201cWhere have you bean?\u201d he shouted at another friend, throwing a handful of beans. Reed didn\u2019t confine his antics to the Western Club. As Hicks reported, over the spring break of his junior year, a debacle involving a series of bars, \u201ca resort of dubious reputation,\u201d and a spontaneous trip to Bermuda resulted in Reed\u2019s \u201crustication\u201d\u2014an archaic punishment based on exile to Concord, Mass. Reed spent the rest of the semester in time-out. When not in Concord, Reed served as President of the Cosmopolitan Club. Founded by Reed on Feb. 12, 1908, the club united Harvard\u2019s international students, entertained foreign dignitaries, and discussed world affairs. It was wildly successful: 53 students joined at its inception, and by Reed\u2019s graduation in the spring of 1910 that number had grown to roughly 200. Reed called it \u201cone of the most important organizations ever formed among the students at Harvard.\u201d Then again, Reed had a taste for hyperbole. It showed up in his rhetoric, marked his prose, and, in the fall of his junior year, inspired the creation of the Dramatic Club. The club provided Harvard\u2019s budding playwrights with a stage. The school offered few opportunities to produce original student theater, and students taking playwriting courses\u2014including Reed and his two co-founders, Edward Sheldon and Hans V. Kaltenborn\u2014chafed at the limitation. Rather than trying to convince an existing troupe to produce student work, they decided to make their own. The Dramatic Club was novel for another reason: it became the first theater group on campus to admit women to its ranks. The decision provoked controversy. Members felt that \u201cif we expected to achieve any social distinction at Harvard with our newly organized club, we simply could not permit the participation of Radcliffe girls,\u201d Kaltenborn recalled in his memoir, \u201cFifty Fabulous Years.\u201d Eventually, these protests were eventually overlooked \u201cin the interest of better drama,\u201d and the Dramatic Club (antecedent of the contemporary Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club) went co-ed. It\u2019s easy to see traces of Reed\u2019s later persona in his early college activities. By junior year, Reed was already an iconoclast, defying social mores and laughing at Harvard authority. He was an idealist, uniting his peers and planning to bring labor justice to the world. He was a leader, screaming at crowds in stadiums and theaters and pitting himself against the status quo. But while he\u2019d turned his eyes from the elites and become the \u201cactivities man\u201d he\u2019d always wanted to be, he was still searching for his cause. \u201cJohn Reed was not a fiery left-winger in those days,\u201d wrote Kaltenborn. \u201cHe was a nonconformist.\u201d Advertisement Senior year, that changed. Infiltrating the Ranks In his final year of college, Reed discovered the Harvard Socialist Club. Founded by two freshmen in 1908, the club\u2019s stated goal was to use the study and spread of socialism to correct the \u201cfundamentally imperfect\u201d state of society. At inception, it had nine members. John Reed speaks to a crowd. In \"One of Us: The Story of John Reed in Lithographs. Lithographs by Lynd Ward\" published by Equinox Press Inc., Pusey Library, Harvard University. By Courtesy of the Harvard Archives at Pusey Library Despite its modest size, the Club pledged to permeate the college. As Reed put it, \u201cThey sat not in lofty contempt above the ignorant student body, but mingled with it, learning its sympathies and weakness, used its machinery...\u201d While club members held frequent discussions of their own, often continuing hours after midnight, they attempted to recruit and effect change by infiltrating other campus organizations. This turned out to be an effective strategy. After less than five years, the Socialist Club had between 30 and 50 members. Two years after Reed\u2019s graduation, a senior named Gerard C. Henderson, class of 1912, told the Harvard Graduates\u2019 Magazine that the club\u2019s \u201c...fringes merge imperceptibly into a half-dozen political clubs, some adherents of such leaders as Wilson and La Follette, and others more vaguely representative of insurgency and progressivism.\u201d Reed was never officially a member, but the club still radicalized him. \u201cIt made me, and many others, realize that there was something going on in the dull outside world more thrilling than college activities,\u201d he wrote. Reed\u2019s newfound politics were first evident in his writing. Reed had been writing for the Lampoon for a few years already, but during his senior year his sketches gained a biting political edge they\u2019d lacked before. In one Lampoon editorial, Reed mocked Harvard\u2019s old money and gave advice to young men seeking to boost their pedigrees. \u201cHyphens are of immense value\u2014remember that anyone will always be glad to lend money to an Endicott-Sears-Cabot, a Wendell-Wendell, or a Trumbull-Peabody,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf a child is too late to corral a Back Bay Brahman for a progenitor, let him seize upon a self-made man who has made a good job of it. Money will finally land anyone among the Captains of Society.\u201d Though Reed mocked them, the elite were beginning to notice him. In the spring of Reed\u2019s senior year, he was offered membership in the Hasty Pudding. The Pudding was one of the most exclusive social organizations on campus, made up almost entirely of members of Waiting and Final Clubs, and to Reed the invitation must have seemed like a baffling reversal on the part of the aristocracy. Certainly, he had distinguished himself in the years since he\u2019d first been overlooked, but he was still the same brash Westerner he\u2019d always been. Advertisement In truth, the Hasty Pudding didn\u2019t have much of an option. It was nearly time for the club\u2019s annual musical, and none of its existing members\u2014who had been selected on the basis of social status\u2014felt capable of writing lyrics. Reed was a necessary outside hire, and he knew it. The Hasty Pudding put on an uncharacteristically subversive show that year. \u201cJust insist that your aunt was a Cabot, And your grandmother\u2019s real name was Weld. Try hard to make rudeness a habit, And be careful with whom you\u2019re beheld.\u201d Revolution in the Yard Suddenly, Reed was a \u201cclub man.\u201d A critical one, certainly, but a club man all the same. And as much as he tried to suppress it, he found satisfaction in the title. That satisfaction became evident at the end of his senior year. John Reed sits in a prison cell.

Investigation Discovery\u2019s \u2018Six Degrees of Murder: Dear Dad\u2019 takes a look at the grisly murder plot carried out by someone Jack worked for at one point. So, let\u2019s find out more about this case then, shall we?\n\nHow Did Jack Reid Die?\n\nJack Reid was a native of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and eventually settled in Derry, New Hampshire. After working in the oil industry for years, Jack started his own trucking company in 1996. Jack was well-respected in his community and had a tremendous work ethic. He also served in the army in the 1960s. At the time of the incident, Jack was working towards retiring in a year or so and moving to Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nBut Jack\u2019s family started worrying when he didn\u2019t show up to one of his jobs on June 29, 2005. Jack didn\u2019t answer his phone either, so the family reported him missing. Over a week later, Jack\u2019s truck was found abandoned in a parking lot in Saugus, Massachusetts, about 40 miles from his home. His body was found rolled up in plastic and under a tarp in his car. He suffered blunt force trauma to the head and was only able to be identified through dental records. A three-pound sledgehammer was also recovered. It was evident that Jack was a victim of a homicide.\n\nWho Killed Jack Reid?\n\nInvestigators looked at the surveillance footage from the parking lot and saw that Jack\u2019s truck came in on June 27 at around 5:30 PM and was followed by another minivan. Two men got out of Jack\u2019s truck after parking it and then got into the minivan, which then drove off. Jack\u2019s phone records showed calls from a prepaid cellphone whose activity ceased after that particular phone call to Jack. When the police checked records of that phone, it was registered to Charlie Was and had an incoming call from John \u201cJay\u201d Brooks\u2019 home in Derry.\n\nJay was a successful businessman and a millionaire who had hired Jack earlier for a moving job from New Hampshire to Las Vegas. The authorities learned that Charlie Was was a fake name used by Robin Knight. When the police approached Robin, the complicated story involving multiple people started to become clearer. When Jay hired Jack to move his belongings to Las Vegas in 2003, some of his things turned up missing. Back then, Jay thought that Jack was the one who stole his motorcycles, jewelry, and a few other things. But there was no evidence pointing towards Jack being responsible for it.\n\nNevertheless, Jay came up with a plan to kill Jack. So, Jay and his son Jesse were involved in recruiting Robin Knight, Michael Benton (Jesse\u2019s childhood friend), and Joseph Vrooman to help carry out the murder. Michael and Joseph cut deals with the prosecution and agreed to testify against Jay. Joseph stated that he was approached by Jay while in a bar in Las Vegas. He was offered $10,000 to kill Jack in New Hampshire. According to Joseph, Jesse told him, \u201cMake sure you have a gun because Mr. Reid always has guns. Make sure you wear your bulletproof vest.\u201d Joseph added that Jay told him of Jack following Jay\u2019s wife and that the victim had shot at Jesse.\n\nSo, Robin called Jack using the prepaid phone and asked him to come to a horse farm in Deerfield, New Hampshire, under the pretext of a job. Once Jack got there, he was lured into a barn and murdered. Michael testified that he hid in a closet, and when Jack was pushed in, he attacked him with a sledgehammer. Joseph also stated that he saw Jay hit Jack with the hammer. He testified, \u201cWhen he (Brooks) picked up the hammer, he said, \u2018Stop the heart, stop the bleeding,\u2019 and he struck (him) twice in the chest area, once was a solid blow, the second one was a glancing blow.\u201d\n\nMichael and Joseph further stated that Jesse helped recruit them and that he was present during the discussions at Jay\u2019s home in Las Vegas regarding the murder. Joseph also said that Jay\u2019s wife, Lorraine, made their flight reservations to New Hampshire. After being offered immunity, Lorraine testified that she flew down to New Hampshire to get rid of a gun from one of their homes in New Castle. In the end, Joseph was convicted of conspiracy to commit capital murder and hindering apprehension. Michael was convicted of second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit capital murder. Robin was found guilty of accomplice to first-degree murder, accomplice to second-degree murder, and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nWhere Are John \u201cJay\u201d Brooks and Jesse Brooks Now?\n\nIn October 2008, Jay, then 56 years old, was convicted of 2 counts of capital murder, first-degree murder, and conspiracy to commit murder. He was spared the death penalty and ordered to serve two life sentences without the possibility of parole. As per prison records, he remains incarcerated at New Hampshire State Prison for Men in Concord, Merrimack County.\n\nIn November 2009, Jesse Brooks was convicted of conspiring to kill Jack Reid. He was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison for his part in the crime. Jesse\u2019s defense tried to argue for a lesser sentence and claimed that his role in the plot was minor. In 2016, his attorney argued to reduce his sentence and consider that his opioid dependence affected his behavior before the murder. In 2021, he unsuccessfully argued yet again to be let out early. His defense stated that he had been a model prisoner. He also claimed that he was not given adequate treatment for his back pain and cited COVID-19 as a risk. Jesse seems to be serving his sentence out at a correctional facility in Arizona. He will be eligible for parole in May 2024.\n\nRead More: Where Are Jack Reid\u2019s Kids Now?"}, {"url": "https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/john-reed", "page_content": "Excerpt\n\nWe intend to be arrogant, impertinent, in bad taste, but not vulgar...to attack old systems, old morals, old prejudices...to set up new ones in their places....Bound by no creed or theory of social reform, we will express them all, providing they be radical.\n\n\u2014The Masses, John Reed, 1913\n\nWhich of John Reed's Works were Burned?\n\nTen Days that Shook the World (10 Tage, die die Welt ersch\u00fctterten)\n\nWho was John Reed?\n\nJohn Reed (1887-1920) was born to a wealthy family in Oregon in 1887. He attended Harvard University, where he began his writing career by serving on the editorial boards of Lampoon and Harvard Monthly. Reed joined the staff of the leftist periodical The Masses in New York City in 1913. The following year he participated in the uprising of Pancho Villa in Mexico. In 1917, Reed, a Leninist sympathizer, interviewed the leaders of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. The resulting work, Ten Days that Shook the World, was his most well known.\n\nAfter his return to the United States, Reed helped found the Communist US Labor Party in 1919 and served as its first chairman. Reed, who had been charged with sedition in the United States for articles written for The Masses, was indicted as a Communist leader during the post-World War I \"Red Scare.\" He returned to Russia, where he died from typhus in 1920. Reed was honored as a Soviet hero and buried under the Kremlin wall. Some 13 years later, the Nazis burned his account of the Bolshevik Revolution for its Communist sympathies."}, {"url": "https://thecrimereport.org/2019/10/16/albert-reeds-road-to-redemption/", "page_content": "As he shuffled from one maximum-security facility to the next, Albert Reed Jr.\u2019s quarter-century-long journey through America\u2019s prison system provided him with a window into the system\u2019s failures: violence, substance abuse, the lack of opportunities for rehabilitation.\n\nAnd he came away with a bracing message.\n\n\u201cWe have to get to the roots, to uplift the people inside who are serving these sentences,\u201d says Reed, who was among the 2,200 inmates released from prison following the December, 2018 signing of the First Step Act.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people in there who do want to come out and be productive, who realize the error of their ways. I can honestly say that.\u201d\n\nHe told his story in an extended interview with The Crime Report.\n\nLike many who end up in the criminal justice system, Reed was faced with tragedy early in life.\n\nHe grew up in a middle-class family in Greenburgh, N.Y., but things took a turn for the worse when Reed\u2019s family moved to White Plains, an adjacent town in New York\u2019s Westchester County. Reed\u2019s father died of cancer in 1976 when he was seven years old. The loss of income forced his family to move into a nearby housing project.\n\nReed\u2019s mother, who struggled to raise three kids on her own, turned to drugs. She would eventually pass away 10 years later.\n\nWith no one else to rely on, Reed began selling drugs to provide for his two sisters.\n\n\u2018The Walls Were Closing In\u2019\n\n\u201cI felt like I had no options,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe walls were closing in.\u201d\n\nAt the age of 19, he was charged with his first offense in 1989, for selling $20 dollars\u2019 worth of cocaine to an undercover cop.\n\nHis second offense came in 1991 for cocaine possession, while he was attending Denmark Technical College in South Carolina. Reed would actually win class president during his time there, but dropped out after he received his second charge and was put on probation.\n\nReed\u2019s third strike came in 1994. He was now 24, and was caught in possession of 193 grams of crack cocaine and two Ziploc bags of marijuana.\n\nThat year, the same year as the birth of Reed\u2019s daughter, the Three Strikes Law came into effect as part of President Bill Clinton\u2019s Violent Crime Control and Prevention Act. The provision was one of several controversial aspects of the bill, which mandated life sentences for a third serious violent or drug trafficking offense.\n\nInstead of taking the plea deal, Reed went to trial.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to take a plea deal and get 30 years,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAt that point, it seemed like a lifetime to me. \u201c\n\nReed lost the trial, and received a life sentence.\n\nReed says he\u2019ll never forget what the judge told him after the trial.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Work on your case while you\u2019re in there, and they may change the laws one day.\u2019 I thought he was joking,\u201d says Reed. \u201cThis guy just gave me a life sentence!\u201d\n\nAfter arriving in prison, however, Reed quickly realized that the judge\u2019s advice may have been his only hope for survival.\n\nReed was sent to the U.S. Penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pa. He was shocked as the reality set in that he would be there for the rest of his life. Once he reached the general population after about a month of an arduous screening process, he immediately took to the law library.\n\nReed says it was a painstaking process, going through legal texts regarding topics like possession and illegal searches and seizures.\n\nAfter a few months at Lewisburg, Reed says he witnessed a stabbing, in which the officer in charge did little to interfere except tell the inmate to stop.\n\n\u201cIt was gruesome\u2026It was an eye-opening experience. It made it that much more prescient for me to get up out of there,\u201d says Reed.\n\nPoor Conditions, Unsafe Environments\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to get accurate data on U.S. prison violence because of the lack of a unified national database. But recent reports have indicated poor conditions like overcrowding and understaffing at certain facilities are creating unsafe and even violent environments, including incidents of guards failing to help inmates under attack.\n\nAfter a month of being separated from the general population without being told why, he was charged in a prison setting with a murder he said he didn\u2019t commit.\n\nHe was then transferred to the ADX maximum security facility in Colorado, where he would spend the next six years.\n\n\u201cI had this thing follow me the rest of my time in my prison bid, where I\u2019m looked at as a killer. It affected my ability to seek educational opportunities,\u201d says Reed.\n\nEven if Reed hadn\u2019t received this alleged erroneous charge, the 1994 Crime Bill effectively eliminated funding for Pell Grants for inmates in both Federal and State prisons.\n\nThroughout his incarceration, Reed\u2019s requests to be transferred to lower security facilities, which had better educational opportunities, were denied multiple times.\n\nUndeterred, however, Reed tried to make the best of his time. He was a frequent visitor to the prison law library, and as he read books his family sent him, he gave himself an education, expanding on the GED and limited college education he obtained before being incarcerated.\n\n\u201cLearning about all these topics, philosophy, history, political science, when you\u2019re faced with nonsense at every turn, that\u2019s what kept me sane,\u201d says Reed.\n\nParticipating in whatever meager educational opportunities the prisons had, Reed saw the transformative effects education can have. It showed him the will that people have to better themselves, which he describes as life-altering experiences.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen guys who can\u2019t read, who didn\u2019t know their ABC\u2019s, struggle and actually accomplish something by becoming literate, or getting their GED, things we take for granted.\u201d\n\nWhen the prison had no budget, the inmates would set up their own classes, and pull the lessons from online, and get the curriculum approved by the prison\u2019s Education Department. Reed taught GED classes himself, covering topics like budgeting, banking and checking.\n\nDespite these workarounds, educational facilities were often hard to access because of prison lockdowns. Reed recalls that at the last facility where he was confined\u2014the U.S. Penitentiary in Pollock, La.,\u2014the prison never stayed open for more than ten days at a time. The prison\u2019s Education Department was only open for about a month of his five-month stay.\n\nThe chance to self-educate helped Reed survive the grim realities of life \u201cinside.\u201d Gang culture, drug abuse and horrific living conditions made daily existence a struggle.\n\nK2 was the drug most widely used by the inmates, according to Reed. Reed, who never used drugs himself, says when he was in the United States Penitentiary at Big Sandy, Ky., \u201cEvery day was lockdown. Guys would smoke and trip out. The prison had to shut down just to stop guys from having to go to the infirmary or put in restraints.\u201d\n\nTo Reed, it felt like living in a mental hospital\u2014but one with few facilities to deal with inmates\u2019 troubled mental health. Despite a 2014 initiative by the Federal Bureau of Prisons to expand mental health programs, quality of care remains grossly insufficient, according to a recent report by The Marshall Project.\n\nA Letter Opens the Door\n\nReed\u2019s luck would finally change 23 years into his sentence, when he received a letter from the Buried Alive Project, a criminal justice reform organization working together with The Decarceration Collective to lobby against harsh sentencing legislation such as Three Strikes Laws.\n\nThe letter promised to use the just-enacted federal First Step Act to secure his release, and requested all Reed\u2019s documents. Reed was finally able to make contact with attorney MiAngel Cody, who founded The Decarceration Collective. She filed a motion for his release in March.\n\nLater that month, an officer came to his cell telling him he was going home.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018You ready?\u2019 I said \u2018yeah I\u2019m ready!\u2019 Other inmates were banging on the doors in their units, yelling \u2018Al\u2019s going home!\u2019\u201d\n\nHis first night out of prison in a quarter of a century was memorable. Reed was picked up by his older sister, and they went to see his younger sister, who was shocked and brought to tears when she first saw him later that night.\n\nReed was able to attend his daughter\u2019s baby shower, and he became a grandfather a month after his release.\n\nReed, who recently turned 50, lives with his older sister in a house in Gaithersburg, Md., and has reestablished a former relationship he had with someone before he was sent to prison in 1994. After working as a basketball camp counsellor this summer, where he was able to share his story with the kids and parents there, he realized a new mission: counseling at-risk youth who are buffeted by the same forces that led him astray when he was growing up.\n\nReed directs most of his energy, however, at getting his consulting firm off the ground. He wants to help former inmates and others pursue their dreams by providing connections to future employment before they are released from prison.\n\nSuch connections increase the odds that the often bumpy path towards integration into society will be successful\u2014odds that are usually against most individuals in the U.S. prison system, Reed says.\n\nBut before launching his new life he had a more solemn duty to perform. Returning to White Plains for an aunt\u2019s funeral, Reed visited the cemetery where his mother was buried\u2014and put flowers on her grave.\n\n\u201cI finally felt,\u201d he says, \u201clike I made it home.\u201d\n\nDane Stallone is a contributing writer to The Crime Report.
