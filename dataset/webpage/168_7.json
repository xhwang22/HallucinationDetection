I asked Sonenshein, who also served as the executive director of a Los Angeles city commission that helped reshape the powers of the mayor\u2019s office in 1999, about the differences. Here\u2019s our conversation, edited for length and clarity:\n\nTell me about your initial reaction to the news that Garcetti finally got the nod.\n\nI had been more optimistic than most that he was going to get the job, but it was clearly not a done deal. I\u2019m pretty pleased about it.\n\nWhy?\n\nI think it\u2019s a good step for him, and it\u2019s a good step for Los Angeles in some important ways.\n\nNo L.A. mayor in my recollection has gone from mayor to a national- or international-level post. The mayors of the three biggest cities never seem to go anywhere \u2014 you get very ambitious people, and their ambition is always frustrated.\n\nIt also has to do with L.A. getting more recognition in the national Democratic Party. National Democrats used to say, you go to the Bay Area for talent and you go to L.A. for money.\n\nSo what power does the mayor of Los Angeles actually have? And how does that compare with other big cities?\n\nNew York is kind of by itself, but also typical of East Coast and Midwestern cities in having a strong mayor system. It\u2019s just that New York is extraordinarily strong."}, {"url": "https://www.metro.net/about/l-a-metro-welcomes-new-members-to-the-board-of-directors/", "page_content": "The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) is welcoming two new members to its Board of Directors.\n\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Holly J. Mitchell and Pomona Mayor Tim Sandoval will take their seats on Metro\u2019s Board of Directors at its first regular meeting of 2021 on Thursday, Jan. 28. The 14-member Board oversees the agency.\n\nMitchell replaces former Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas who was elected to the L.A. City Council in November. Sandoval replaces Duarte Councilmember John Fasana, who retired at the end of 2020.\n\n\u201cMetro provides more than just a way to move around our city \u2014 it\u2019s a tool for opportunity, a lifeline during our most difficult days, and a vehicle for a better quality of life,\u201d said Metro Board Chair and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. \u201cDirectors Fasana and Ridley-Thomas have been instrumental in helping Metro deliver equity, possibility, connection, and prosperity to our residents, and I know that incoming Directors Mitchell and Sandoval will drive us to realize our promises of lower emissions, less congestion, and a more sustainable future for our region.\u201d\n\nThe two new member join Garcetti and current Board Members: Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger, Los Angeles City Councilmember Mike Bonin, Inglewood Mayor James Butts, Los Angeles Mayor-appointee Jacquelyn Dupont-Walker, Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia, Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn, Los Angeles City Councilmember Paul Krekorian, Los Angeles County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl, Glendale City Councilmember Ara Najarian, Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis and Caltrans District 7 Director Tony Tavares.\n\nEach member serves a four-year term and oversees a budget of more than $6 billion at LA Metro.\n\nBoard Welcomes Two New Members\n\nCounty Supervisor Holly J. Mitchell steps in as a County Board of Supervisors representative after former County Supervisor Ridley-Thomas was elected to the Los Angeles City Council. Mitchell served in the California State Assembly from 2010 until 2013, when she was elected to the California State Senate, where she became the first African American to serve as Chair of the Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Committee. There, she helped to lead the passage of state budgets totaling more than $200 billion.\n\nPomona Mayor Tim Sandoval steps in to represent the San Gabriel Valley after John Fasana retired. Sandoval is a longtime Pomona resident who has served on numerous city committees since the 1990s. He was elected mayor of Pomona in 2016 and was recently reelected. He has been active in promoting public transit and currently chairs the Foothill Gold Line Extension Construction Authority Board of Directors.\n\nBoard Bids Farewell to Two Dedicated Members\n\nFormer Duarte Councilmember John Fasana steps down as Metro\u2019s longest-serving member of the Board of Directors. Fasana is a founding member of Metro\u2019s Board of Directors, having served since Metro was formed in 1993. His work in transportation predates Metro, with his participation in numerous bodies such as the San Gabriel Valley Transportation Coalition. He has served as a member of the Duarte City Council since 1987 \u2013 six times as mayor \u2013 until he decided to not seek reelection in 2020. Fasana was a driving force behind getting the L Line (Gold) built to Pasadena in 2003 and then extended to Azusa in 2016. A second extension to Pomona \u2014 advocated strongly for by Fasana \u2014 is currently under construction.\n\nLos Angeles City Councilmember Mark Ridley-Thomas is also a founding member of Metro\u2019s Board of Directors. He has been active in public service since the 1980s and was first elected to the Los Angeles City Council in 1991, where he served until 2002. He served as a California State Assemblyman from 2002 until 2006 and was a California State Senator from 2006 to 2008. In 2008, he was elected to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors where he rejoined Metro\u2019s Board of Directors. Ridley-Thomas has been a fierce champion for ensuring the Crenshaw/LAX Line was built as a rail line \u2014 it was originally envisioned as a bus rapid transit line. He also helped spearhead Metro\u2019s SEED School of Los Angeles County, which will be the state\u2019s first public boarding high school.\n\n\u201c2020 was a tumultuous year in the history of Metro and the world. I am grateful for the steady leadership, collaboration, and dedication of Directors Fasana and Ridley-Thomas. Their contributions helped Metro weather the storm and put us on a solid path to recovery,\u201d said Metro CEO Phillip A. Washington. \u201cMetro has big challenges ahead, as well as tremendous opportunities, and I am looking forward to harnessing the talent and vision of our newest Directors to advance and enhance mobility in LA County.\u201d\n\nFor more information about the Metro Board of Directors, visit https://www.metro.net/about/board-administration/.\n\nAbout Metro\n\nThe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) is currently providing lifeline service for essential trips and frontline workers.

Solis has become the new Chair of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) Board of Directors effective July 1. She succeeds outgoing Board Chair and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, whose term ended June 30.\n\nChair Solis, who proudly represents the County\u2019s First Supervisorial District that extends from Westlake to Pomona and from Eagle Rock to South Gate, said she intends to focus her attention as chair on three priorities in the coming year: supporting Metro\u2019s transit riders, driving an equitable recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic, and reimagining the agency\u2019s highway investments.\n\nChair Solis said in her efforts to support transit riders, she will advocate for the region\u2019s most disadvantaged communities.\n\n\u201cAs congestion worsens and more people gain access to cars, bus riders, particularly among Black and Latinx communities, suffer the most,\u201d said Chair Solis. \u201cBus riders \u2014 who have median annual incomes of less than $18,000 \u2014 comprise some of the most disadvantaged communities in LA County that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Transit riders need better service, and they need it now. To provide better service, Metro needs to invest more funding in operations, homelessness outreach, and alternatives to law enforcement.\u201d\n\nChair Solis reported that over the last three decades Southern California has seen a surge in vehicle ownership, with figures increasing from 0.25 vehicles per new resident between 1990 and 2000 to almost 1.0 vehicle per new resident at the end of 2015.\n\n\u201cWhen buses are stuck in traffic, travel times increase, and reliability worsens. It\u2019s not surprising that Metro\u2019s bus ridership has declined year over year,\u201d she said.\n\nChair Solis also expressed a need for more affordable housing to serve transit riders and to prevent further displacement among low-income and vulnerable communities.\n\n\u201cWith a housing crisis that makes it challenging to live in Los Angeles County, transportation serves as a critical tool in helping residents get around. And as housing becomes more expensive, commutes are becoming longer and more arduous. Metro must use the land that it will acquire as part of upcoming capital projects to quickly build more affordable housing to help prevent future displacement and to better serve our most vulnerable transit riders,\u201d she said.\n\nIn promoting an equitable recovery, Chair Solis said she is committed to driving solutions that will help low-income communities and small businesses spring back from the pandemic. She said more than 15,000 small businesses throughout the County have closed, and hard-hit industries like hospitality and retail, which employ hundreds of thousands of Black and Latinx workers, will be particularly challenged to rebound easily from the pandemic.\n\n\u201cLow-income communities and small businesses have taken the brunt of the economic impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d Chair Solis said. \u201cWith an $8 billion annual budget, Metro has the resources to revive the economy with a focus on equity-based solutions. Metro can advance an equitable recovery for LA County by creating well-paying jobs targeted toward under-served communities, developing new pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship programs, engaging more women in construction trades, expanding programs to support small businesses near Metro transit lines, and leveraging the return of the federal local hire pilot program.\u201d\n\nIn reimagining Metro\u2019s Highway Program, Chair Solis said traditional highway widening projects often bring displacement and pollution to neighborhoods that are already overburdened with housing insecurity and health disparities.\n\n\u201cFor decades, Metro and other agencies across the United States have built freeway projects at the expense of communities of color. We cannot continue repeating mistakes of the past and worsening structural inequities. Metro must begin exploring the impacts of its highway investments and partner with communities to identify mobility solutions that work for everyone whether they walk, bike, roll, drive, or take transit.\u201d\n\nChair Solis\u2019 leadership on the Metro Board coincides with the recent appointment of Stephanie Wiggins as Metro\u2019s new CEO, marking the first time in Metro\u2019s 28-year history that both the Board Chair and CEO are simultaneously led by women, a new agency milestone.\n\nThe 13-member Metro Board of Directors is comprised of the five Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, four members appointed by the Los Angeles County City Selection Committee, the Mayor of Los Angeles and three members appointed by the Mayor. The position of Board Chair rotates between the three groups. Chair Solis\u2019s term will run from July 1, 2021, through June 30, 2022.\n\n\u201cSupervisor Solis has been a champion of public transportation, equity, and inclusion throughout her career,\u201d said Metro CEO Stephanie Wiggins. \u201cShe is a trailblazer on the forefront of LA County\u2019s efforts to advance equity and diversity initiatives across the region. I am thrilled to work with her in the coming year as we spearhead innovative ways to support Metro\u2019s transit riders and advance an equitable recovery for LA County.\u201d\n\nFor more information about Metro\u2019s Board of Directors, please visit https://www.metro.net/about/board-administration/.\n\nAdditional quotes:\n\n\u201cI have worked closely with Supervisor Solis on both the Metro and Metrolink Boards for years. She has been a pleasure to work with in our collective efforts to provide greater transportation options for both Los Angeles County and the greater Southern California region,\u201d said Ara Najarian, Glendale City Council Member and First Vice Chair of the Metro Board. \u201cHilda is especially dedicated to protecting the environment and improving the lives of working families. I know that experience will serve her well as she leads Metro out of the pandemic and toward implementing Metro\u2019s immediate goals for improving the transit experience for its customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs new Board Chair, Hilda Solis will provide Metro with the important leadership it needs at this critical juncture where equity, justice and economic vibrancy are so critical to our future,\u201d said Metro Second Vice Chair Jacquelyn Dupont-Walker. \u201cHer equity-based priorities and unique ability to open doors for those who have been shut out will enable Metro to leap forward in its goal to help return opportunity to our region. She clearly has a passion to represent people equally, and it has benefitted not only her constituents, but all the residents of Los Angeles County.\u201d\n\nAbout Metro\n\nThe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) is currently providing lifeline service for essential trips and frontline workers.

Private companies often choose to have a board of directors for the expertise the individual members bring, particularly when it comes to strategic guidance and additional oversight. Whether or not your company is required to have a board of directors, it's a good idea to become familiar with the role a board can play and the duties and responsibilities it might undertake.\n\nRole of the board of directors\n\nUnlike your upper management, your company's board of directors is not there to oversee the day-to-day operations of your company. Instead, your board's role is to make decisions about the bigger, broader issues that are critical to your company's success. For example, a board of directors often makes decisions related to strategic planning, such as the company's future direction or the hiring of key personnel. Your board of directors should also help provide company oversight, or governance, such as ensuring that the actions of the company are not in conflict with the interests of various stakeholders, including shareholders or members.\n\nIn keeping with its role in providing the company with strategic guidance and oversight, a board of directors has several specific duties and responsibilities, the exact nature of which varies depending on your company's mission, its goals, and the industry in which it operates. Each specific duty and responsibility should be set out in a formal company document such as your company's operating agreement, articles of incorporation, or bylaws.\n\nFiduciary duties of the board of directors\n\nAn important point to note is that a board of directors owes its primary responsibility to your company and its shareholders. In legal terms, this duty is known as a fiduciary duty. Fulfilling a fiduciary duty typically requires more than would be required to meet a normal duty under the law.\n\nFiduciaries are required to protect the best interests of the entity or entities to whom they owe their duties. This generally means that a board of directors' fiduciary duties must focus on the best interests of the company and its shareholders. To this end, board decisions need to be made with care and diligence, in good faith, and always with the goal of protecting the company's best interests. Additionally, individual directors must avoid any situations that place them in a conflict of interest with the company's interests.\n\nBoard of directors meetings\n\nYour board of directors must have regular meetings in order to fulfill its role of making decisions concerning the important and often critical issues facing your company. While it's generally important for all directors to attend board meetings, company bylaws often provide for directors to attend either in person or through electronic means. The following are important concepts to understand when it comes to holding your meetings:\n\nQuorum. Your bylaws should outline how many directors must be present in order for a decision to be valid. In legal terms, this is known as a quorum. If a company's bylaws do not address this, in most cases a majority of the directors present must approve of a decision for it to be valid.\n\nYour bylaws should outline how many directors must be present in order for a decision to be valid. In legal terms, this is known as a quorum. If a company's bylaws do not address this, in most cases a majority of the directors present must approve of a decision for it to be valid. Resolution. Once a decision has been made in a meeting, a resolution is often drawn up to document the decision. A typical board resolution outlines the decision and the actions authorized by the board to implement that decision.\n\nOnce a decision has been made in a meeting, a resolution is often drawn up to document the decision. A typical board resolution outlines the decision and the actions authorized by the board to implement that decision. Meeting minutes. It's important to properly document a board meeting with meeting minutes, which describe the issues discussed as well as the decisions made by the board, any actions the board may have been authorized, and any resolutions that may have been passed.\n\nUnderstanding who elects the board of directors\n\nWithin a public corporation, directors are elected by the shareholders at a shareholders' meeting. However, aside from having to adhere to any state regulations regarding company boards, private companies can address the formation of a board of directors in whatever way it chooses. For example, a company with members might choose to have only certain members elect board directors, or it might require the company founder to always sit as a board director.\n\nThese rules regarding how the board of directors should be formed are then set out in the documents that create the company, such as its articles of incorporation or operating agreement, or in the company's bylaws.\n\nWhen a director resigns, another director needs to be appointed. The rules set out in the company's documents should therefore provide for what happens if a director submits a resignation letter.\n\nHow to get on a board of directors\n\nIt is often quite difficult to get seated on the boards of large, publicly traded companies. If becoming a director is something that appeals to you, it's far more feasible to start at a small, local company or nonprofit. Even though such organizations often do not provide direct compensation, you might receive some indirect benefits. such as networking opportunities and the ability to build credentials within your chosen industry.\n\nIf you've decided that a board of directors is a smart tool for your new business, it's important to include an outline of your new board's role, duties, and responsibilities in your business formation documents. By carefully considering the kind of advice or guidance you want your board to provide, you can set the stage for your board of directors to become a crucial component of your business success."}, {"url": "https://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/garoll.htm", "page_content": "SOUTHERN PINES, North Carolina \u2014 Retired U.S. Marine Corps Brigadier General George A.
