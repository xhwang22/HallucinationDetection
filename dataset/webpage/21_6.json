The number rose following the ratification of the Constitution by North Carolina and Rhode Island in 1790; the first Congress (1789\u201391) adjourned with 65 representatives. By 1912 membership had reached 435. Two additional representatives were added temporarily after the admission of Alaska and Hawaii as states in 1959, but at the next legislative apportionment , membership returned to 435, the number authorized by a law enacted in 1941.\n\nEach state is guaranteed at least one member of the House of Representatives. The allocation of seats is based on the population within the states, and membership is reapportioned every 10 years, following the decennial census . House members are elected for two-year terms from single-member districts of approximately equal population. The constitutional requirements for eligibility for membership of the House of Representatives are a minimum age of 25 years, U.S. citizenship for at least seven years, and residency of the state from which the member is elected, though he need not reside in the constituency that he represents.\n\nThe House of Representatives shares equal responsibility for lawmaking with the U.S. Senate . As conceived by the framers of the Constitution, the House was to represent the popular will, and its members were to be directly elected by the people. In contrast, members of the Senate were appointed by the states until the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment (1913), which mandated the direct election of senators.\n\nPowers\n\nThe Constitution vests certain exclusive powers in the House of Representatives, including the right to initiate impeachment proceedings and to originate revenue bills. The organization and character of the House of Representatives have evolved under the influence of political parties, which provide a means of controlling proceedings and mobilizing the necessary majorities. Party leaders, such as the speaker of the House and the majority and minority leaders, play a central role in the operations of the institution. However, party discipline (i.e., the tendency of all members of a political party to vote in the same way) has not always been strong, owing to the fact that members, who must face reelection every two years, often vote the interests of their districts rather than their political party when the two diverge.\n\nA further dominating element of House organization is the committee system, under which the membership is divided into specialized groups for purposes such as holding hearings, preparing bills for the consideration of the entire House, and regulating House procedure. Each committee is chaired by a member of the majority party. Almost all bills are first referred to a committee, and ordinarily the full House cannot act on a bill until the committee has \u201creported\u201d it for floor action. There are approximately 20 standing (permanent) committees, organized mainly around major policy areas, each having staffs, budgets, and subcommittees. They may hold hearings on questions of public interest, propose legislation that has not been formally introduced as a bill or resolution, and conduct investigations. Among important standing committees are those on appropriations, on ways and means (which handles matters related to finance), and on rules. There are also select and special committees, which are usually appointed for a specific project and for a limited period.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Cabinet officers and other officials are frequently summoned before the committees to explain policy. The Constitution (Article I, section 6) prohibits members of Congress from holding offices in the executive branch of government\u2014a chief distinction between parliamentary and congressional forms of government.\n\nAfter the census of 1920, Northeastern and Midwestern states held 270 House seats and the South and West held 169. Thereafter, the balance between the two regions gradually shifted: following the 2010 census, the Northeast and Midwest accounted for only 172 seats, compared with the South and West\u2019s 263. Most notably, the number of representatives from New York declined from 45 in the 1930s to only 27 in 2012, while the number from California increased from 11 to 53."}, {"url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11595929/In-1923-Speaker-House-election-took-9-rounds-1856-Congress-shut-2-months.html", "page_content": "The last speaker election to go beyond the first ballot was a century ago, when members took nine tries to vote for Frederick Gillett (R-Mass.) to the position\n\nCurrently, McCarthy doesn't have enough votes and the House can't organize until a leader has been selected\n\nAfter Biden and Harris, the Speaker is next in line to become president\n\nIt didn't go according to plan, at least for GOP leader Kevin McCarthy who became the first majority nominee for speaker in 100 years to fail to win an initial vote for the gavel after not getting 218 votes but rather losing 19 GOP hardliners.

The all-time record for duration of a speaker vote was in the mid-1850s \u2014 when lawmakers took almost two months and 133 ballots before picking Nathaniel Banks, also of Massachusetts.\n\nIn the House\u2019s 234-year history, 14 speaker votes have required multiple ballots according to the Washington Post. With the rise of the two-party system, only two have come after 1856.\n\nThe House can change the election rules allowing a simple majority of votes to become the speaker, but this could backfire for the Republicans since Jeffries, in theory, could win a majority vote meaning the House and the Senate would both be under Democratic control - a highly unlikely scenario.\n\nFrederick H Gillett of Massachusetts, was re-elected Speaker of the House of Representatives on 5th December, when the Republican insurgents voted for him for the first time after a deadlock two days previously on December 14, 1923\n\nThe last speaker election to go beyond the first ballot was in 1923, when members took nine tries to name Frederick Gillett (R-Mass.)\n\nSince the House leadership election outcome is not a done deal, a speaker could be elected after multiple attempts, delayed for day or weeks, or Congress could change the rules in order to get a simple majority.\n\nUntil a speaker is elected, Cheryl Lynn Johnson, the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives and Pelosi appointee, will preside over the lower chamber.\n\nThe outgoing speaker will usually join the successor at the speaker's chair, where they will pass the gavel as a nod to the peaceful transition of power from one party leader to another.

Stan McClain, 59, on Nov. 3. McClain is seeking reelection for his third term in the State House. Both candidates are separated by age, gender, party and experience.\n\nBut one thing they do share is a love of their community.\n\nDela Rosa, 24, is a fresh face on the political scene. A recent University of Florida graduate, she currently works as a registered behavioral technician with children on the autism spectrum. But she\u2019s leaving behind her degree in neuroscience and goals of becoming a doctor to pursue a life of public service.\n\n\u201cI realized there are a lot of good doctors out there, but we need a lot more good politicians,\u201d Dela Rosa said.\n\nDela Rosa, though enthusiastic, faces a myriad of challenges this election. The first-time candidate is running on a progressive platform in a district that is and has been strongly Republican.\n\nAbout 48% of registered voters in the district are Republican. About 30% are Democrat. And in 2016, over 84% of the vote went to Trump.\n\nBecause of the Republican stronghold in Marion County, Rep. McClain, who according to a social media ad is a \u201cpro-Trump, pro-liberty\u201d candidate, easily won his bid for reelection to the house in 2018.\n\nBut this hasn\u2019t deterred Dela Rosa, who remains cautiously optimistic and on the offense. Her campaign strategy has consisted of strong community involvement.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s been very effective for us, especially in the early days of the campaign, has been sitting down and talking to future constituents. We\u2019ve been knocking on doors for the past few months and I think it has let people know that we\u2019re trying to see past party lines to put people first,\u201d she said.\n\nThis work paid off in the lead up to the primary election. She gained 75.72% of the district\u2019s Democratic votes, beating out opponent Richard Allen Rowe and securing her spot on the general election ballot.\n\nDela Rosa has centered her platform, known as The New Direction, on the local issues most pressing to her community. It consists of six main pillars: senior care, the Ocala National Forest, veterans, small businesses, West Ocala and healthcare.\n\nThese issues are central to Marion County, which Dela Rosa sees as a place with small town feelings but big city opportunities. An Ocala native, she hopes to use her campaign to amplify those in the community who feel that their concerns have been overlooked.\n\nThe topic of healthcare is critical to Dela Rosa, who says expanding access to Medicaid is one of her top priorities. Dela Rosa also supports greater funding of the public education system, a $15 minimum wage, police reform in the form of demilitarization and de-escalation training and a woman\u2019s right to choose.\n\nTo her, accessibility is what makes a good representative.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about a willingness to listen. As a representative, I wouldn\u2019t know how to represent you if I don\u2019t talk to you,\u201d she said.\n\nShe questions Rep. McClain\u2019s accessibility to his community, claiming that he has declined invitations to past potential candidate forums. McClain\u2019s absence on the campaign field, Dela Rosa says, has disappointed her not only as a candidate but also as his current constituent.\n\nSave for a few mailers sent to Republicans in the district, Rep. McClain does not seem to be campaigning on the ground as actively as his opponent. He has, however, taken to social media to share information about the election and connect with his supporters.\n\nBut in a district so strongly red, McClain\u2019s lack of an on-the-ground campaign may not be such an issue. He faced no challenger in the primaries, and the majority of voters align themselves with the conservative values that he promotes.\n\nHis platform, the only information on his website, focuses on six main concepts: job creation in a free-market environment, water conservation in the area\u2019s springs, low taxation, school choice, faith and family, and preservation of the Second Amendment.\n\nHis daughter, Mandy McClain, says he\u2019s guided by his family values, respect for small business owners and belief in the American dream.\n\n\u201cMy dad is the most honest and ethical person that I know. Everything he works hard for is something he believes in,\u201d she said, and added that he\u2019s not above speaking with and listening to those in the community about how he can be a better leader.\n\nMcClain was first elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2016. Before that, he spent 12 years as a member of the Marion County board of county commissioners. So locals have had time to become acquainted with who Stan McClain is.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have to demand visibility in the way that Dela Rosa does.\n\nDuring the 2020 legislative session, he supported the passage of a Senate bill requiring minors to get parental consent before having an abortion, a house bill that raised the minimum salary for teachers, and the Clean Waterways Act.\n\nDespite his lack of campaigning in the community, McClain\u2019s fundraising efforts have surpassed Dela Rosa\u2019s. So far, McClain has raised $74,182, of which he has spent $15,779.\n\nDirect donations to Florida legislature candidate campaigns are limited to $1,000, but that hasn\u2019t stopped certain companies from donating multiple times to McClain\u2019s campaign. The majority of his contributions come from political action committees and organizations centered around agriculture, construction, housing and land management, and health care. Outside of politics, McClain is a state-certified residential contractor.\n\nFrequent contributors include Rep. Paul Renner\u2019s (District 24) Conservatives for Principled Leadership PAC as well as HCA Florida\u2019s Good Government Group, part of one of the largest private health systems in the state. Other notable contributors are the Duke Energy Corporation\u2019s Florida PAC, Comcast and the Florida Bankers Association.\n\nSince making the decision to run in June 2019, Dela Rosa has raised $11,800 and spent $8,852 of it. Most of her spending has been for social media, which has been a go-to source of activity since the COVID-19 pandemic started.\n\nHer campaign manager Patrick Miller has helped her run a 100% grassroots campaign built on locally sourced small-dollar donations.\n\n\u201cThese are people within our community. Our neighbors. These are the people that we talk to every day,\u201d Miller said.\n\n\u201cMoney in politics, for better or for worse, is a dominant force, and it just so happens that politicians and people in government usually do their jobs on behalf of their donors. And so when you have grassroots movements like ours who get their money from members of that community, that\u2019s who we\u2019re there to serve.\u201d\n\nMiller and Dela Rosa also emphasized the size of their volunteer force. At the start of her campaign, Dela Rosa had around three or four volunteers.\n\nThat number has grown to about 40 people over the last couple of months.\n\nAs for the remainder of the campaign, Dela Rosa plans to keep knocking on doors and making phone calls in an effort to encourage voter turnout. Florida has shattered previous early voting records in the days since the early voting period began on Oct. 19.\n\nDela Rosa hopes to keep the momentum going until Election Day.\n\nRead more of WUFT\u2019s coverage of Florida Votes 2020"}, {"url": "https://floridahousegop.com/officials/stan-mcclain/", "page_content": "I have lived in Marion County for over 30 years.

After earning a bachelor's degree from the University of Florida in 1993, he went to the University of Miami for his law degree. Rubio's political career began with his election to the West Miami City Commission in 1998. He was elected in the Florida House of Representatives the following year. In 2009, Rubio won his campaign for the U.S. Senate. In 2015, Rubio announced his plans to run for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. However, his campaign never picked up the momentum he had hoped for and he dropped out of the race after a disappointing defeat in his home state of Florida. He re-entered the race for his previous Senate seat and was re-elected in 2016.\n\nEarly Life\n\nRubio was born in Miami, Florida, on May 28, 1971. He is one of four children born to Cuban immigrants. Both of his parents worked hard to support the family. His father spent many years as a bartender and his mother held a number of service industry and retail jobs. In 1975, his parents became naturalized U.S. citizens. For Rubio, he became interested in public service early on. He has told the press, \"I gained an interest in politics and history from my uncle, who would read books and newspapers out loud to us.\"\n\nRubio spent part of his childhood in Las Vegas, Nevada, but he returned to Florida in the 1980s with his family. A stellar athlete, Rubio was a top football player at South Miami High School. He graduated in 1989 and earned a football scholarship to Tarkio College in Missouri. Rubio left the school after a year and eventually enrolled at the University of Florida. After completing his bachelor's degree there in 1993, he earned a law degree from the University of Miami in 1996.\n\nPolitical Career\n\nRubio began his life in public service in 1998 by winning a seat on the West Miami City Commission. Before long, he made his ascent into state politics. Rubio was victorious in his bid for the Florida House of Representatives in 1999. He quickly established himself as a political force with the legislature, becoming the majority leader in 2003 and then speaker of the House three years later.\n\nAs the speaker, Rubio launched an ambitious campaign to generate ways to improve and reform the state government. He held a series of gatherings around the state to hear and collect ideas from Florida residents. Culling from these suggestions, Rubio put together a proposal called \"100 Innovative Ideas for Florida's Future.\" He presented the proposal to the legislature and more than half of these ideas became laws. One of these reforms, however, didn't survive the political process. The fiscally conservative Rubio had lobbied for property tax reforms and for instituting a sales tax increase.\n\nIn 2009, Rubio surprised many in Florida politics by taking on former Florida governor and Republican Charlie Crist for the Senate seat vacated by Mel Martinez. Analysts initially viewed Rubio as the underdog, and he trailed the better-known Crist in the polls at first. But the well-spoken young politician hammered at Crist for his ties to President Barack Obama and emphasized the state's dire need for economic change. \"I'm in this race to win. Many of the things that make America unique are threatened by politicians in Washington, D.C. We're going to make irreversible decisions over the next four to six years. I want to be a part of correcting the course,\" he said during his campaign.\n\nLate in the campaign, Rubio found himself retracting some of his statements about his family background. He had initially stated that his parents fled Cuba during the revolution. However, they had actually left before Fidel Castro took power. This information had little impact on his campaign. Voters seemed more taken with his pledges to curb federal spending.\n\nWith the help of Tea Party supporters, the reform-minded Rubio managed to win an impressive victory in November 2010. He defeated both Crist, who ran as an independent, and Democratic opponent Kendrick Meek. Since taking office in 2011, Rubio has become a member of several legislative committees, including the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation; and the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nLess than a year after taking office, Rubio became the subject of intense political speculation. His name was bandied about as a possible running mate for Mitt Romney in his 2012 bid for the presidency. Though Rubio denied that he had any interest in the vice-presidential nomination, political analysts and members of the Republican Party thought he would have a good choice for the vice-presidential spot due to his representation of an important state in the national election and likely support from the Latino community.\n\nInstead of joining the Romney campaign, Rubio focused on his work in the Senate. In 2013, he was part of the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d, a bi-partisan group of eight U.S. Senators who crafted a comprehensive immigration bill known as the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013. The bill provided a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and made the border more secure. The bill passed the Senate 62-32 but faced stiff resistance in the House. Eventually, Rubio withdrew his support for the bill citing more pressing priorities like repealing Obamacare. The House never took up the bill and it died in committee. Rubio\u2019s participation in the formation of the immigration bill became a major issue during the 2016 Republican Presidential debates.\n\nIn 2014, in an effort to derail the Affordable Care Act, Rubio supported a provision to prevent the Department of Health and Human Services from tapping into other accounts to fund the risk corridors program. The result was several small insurers went out of business and others pulled out of the health care exchanges altogether.\n\nRubio has also been an outspoken pro-life advocate. He introduced legislation in January 2015 to allow states to \"enforce their parental notification and consent laws\" when a minor travels to another state for an abortion, according to Rubio's official website.\n\nPresidential Campaign\n\nIn April 2015, Rubio announced his plans to run for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. In a speech delivered in Miami, he explained why he decided to seek the country's highest office. \"We've reached a moment now, not just in my career, but the history of our country, where I believe that it needs a Republican Party that is new and vibrant, that understands the future, has an agenda for that future,\" Rubio said. \"And I feel uniquely qualified to offer that.\"\n\nIn his bid for the Republican nomination, Rubio faced competition from fellow senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, both of whom had already announced their candidacies. He also had to battle his one-time mentor Jeb Bush. While he was brought into office with Tea Party support, Rubio shifted to a more moderate conservative position.\n\nAs his presidential campaign advanced, Rubio found himself up against real estate magnate and reality TV star Donald Trump, who had emerged as a leading candidate along with Cruz. He did fare better than many of his other Republican opponents in the first contest for delegates: the Iowa Caucus. In February 2016, Cruz won the most votes and 8 delegates, but Rubio managed to come in third. He was nearly tied with Trump, winning 23.1% of the votes to Trump's 24.3%. Both Rubio and Trump won 7 delegates each. Later that month, he received only 24.0% of the vote in Nevada caucuses, where he'd spent much of his childhood years. The next month, Rubio dropped out of the race after a crushing defeat in his home state by Trump, who won every county except for Miami-Dade.\n\nReturn to the Senate\n\nAfter his defeat by Trump, Rubio had asserted that he would not seek re-election for his Senate seat and would be taking a break from politics. In June 2016, however, Rubio announced that he would run for a second Senate term. In November 2016, Rubio defeated his Democratic opponent, Representative Patrick Murphy, and won re-election in the Senate race.\n\nRubio's return to the Senate was aided by veteran Republican operative Clint Reed, who managed the senator's campaign before taking over as his chief of staff in January 2017. However, the following January, Rubio announced he had abruptly fired Reed, following accusations of improper conduct with employees in the senator's office.\n\nIn February 2018, Politico reported that Rubio was collaborating with first daughter Ivanka Trump on ideas for creating maternity-leave coverage that would appeal to Republican supporters. Among the ideas the Florida senator was said to be considering was a program in which parents could draw from Social Security benefits to pay for their time away from the workplace.\n\nLater that month, following the horrific shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead, Rubio agreed to participate in a town hall discussion on the subject that aired live on CNN. Facing tough questions and blistering comments from surviving students and parents who lost loved ones, Rubio endorsed raising the age requirement for buying a rifle and said he was reconsidering his opposition to placing limits on high-capacity magazines. He declined to say whether he would continue receiving donations from the NRA.\n\nMeanwhile, the Florida senator was seeking to push through his Second Amendment Enforcement Act, designed, in part, to curb the assault weapons ban in Washington, D.C. When city Mayor Muriel Bowser asked Rubio to withdraw his bill, he replied with a letter that said they \"share a common goal,\" insisting his legislation was simply meant to ensure that D.C. law was \"in line with federal law.\"\n\nWhen the coronavirus pandemic shut down communities and threatened to torpedo the economy in the early months of 2020, Rubio spearheaded the creation of the Paycheck Protection Program as chairman of the Small Business Committee. In May, he took over as interim chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee when the incumbent head, Richard Burr, stepped aside during an FBI investigation into his stock trading.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nMarried since 1998, Rubio and his wife, Jeanette, have four children: Amanda, Daniella, Anthony and Dominic. Outside of politics, Rubio is known for his passion for football. He is a die-hard Miami Dolphins fan and his wife was once a cheerleader for the team.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Marco Antonio Rubio\n\nBirth Year: 1971\n\nBirth date: May 28, 1971\n\nBirth State: Florida\n\nBirth City: Miami\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Marco Rubio was elected to the U.S. Senate representing Florida in 2010.

He was 84.\n\nLale Morrison, his chief of staff, confirmed the death. She provided no other details.\n\nMr. Hastings, a Democrat, had announced in early 2019 that he had pancreatic cancer. He continued to make public appearances for a time but was unable to travel to Washington in January to take the oath of office.\n\nHis death reduces his party\u2019s already slim majority in the House of Representatives, which is now 218 to 211, until a special election can be held to fill his seat.
