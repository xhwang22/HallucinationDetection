{"After retiring from playing, Steve Cooper moved into coaching.": [{"url": "https://theathletic.com/3194871/2022/03/19/steve-cooper-the-liverpool-years-only-now-do-i-fully-appreciate-what-a-brilliant-coach-he-was/", "page_content": "Steve Cooper is the kind of character who prefers to look forward rather than back. He often needs a little encouragement to even talk about the past.\n\nAnd when he does, he nearly always has a knack of finding a way to bring the conversation back around to the future.\n\nGiven that he is still only 42 \u2014 young for a football manager \u2014 it is hard to conceive the thought that a key step on his journey to becoming Nottingham Forest manager began more than 13 years ago, when he was appointed as an academy coach at Premier League Liverpool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHanded the role of coaching the under-12 side in 2008, within three years he was head coach of the academy. Some might have seen his rise coming on the horizon given that at the age of 27 \u2014 while coaching in the academy at Wrexham \u2014 he had become one of the youngest people to complete a UEFA Pro Licence.\n\nCooper\u2019s journey into management in Championship football, with Swansea, saw him climb the ladder steadily, with his appointment in 2019 following positive spells coaching the England Under-16 and Under-17 sides, winning the World Cup with the older age group.\n\nBut it was during those five years at Liverpool that Cooper\u2019s reputation really blossomed as he played a part in the development of players like Raheem Sterling, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ben Woodburn.\n\nThis weekend, Cooper\u2019s Forest will face his former club in a FA Cup quarter-final at the City Ground that feels decidedly like a blast from the past, largely because of the shared history of the two clubs.\n\nAnd Cooper acknowledges the role his time on Merseyside played in his personal development as he looks to further enhance his reputation by attempting to mastermind a win that would propel Forest into their first FA Cup semi-final since 1991 \u2014 in the year they lost in the final to Tottenham, when he was just 11.\n\n\u201cI think all of your experiences shape you, whether they are good, bad or indifferent. I had a long time at Wrexham and they were important days,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cThen Liverpool, the FA, Swansea\u2026 you take something out of everything in life. Life is all about experiences and learning from them.\n\n\u201cI had the best part of five years at Liverpool and, when I look back on that now, for me personally it was a really important time. You always do your best for the organisation you work for. It is about the job you do, rather than what you get out of it as an individual. But I was definitely a better coach when I stepped away from there than I was when I first went in there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat is what I try to achieve in every job I go into \u2014 I try to come out of it as a better coach. It is what I am trying to do here as well, at Nottingham Forest. Every step for me so far has been a beneficial one. I am still a relatively young coach, if I am allowed to say that. I am looking to always improve.\u201d\n\nDuring his five years at Liverpool, Cooper went from being an under-12 coach, to being the senior coach at the academy.\n\n\u201cAcademies are all about the players. That is all that matters. You work long hours, you run long sessions, you work with a lot of players and a lot of different teams,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cThe challenge is to help as many players as you can, as much as you can. That applies wherever you are and regardless of who you are working for and whether it is a young nine or 10 year-old or a player in the latter part of his development.\n\n\u201cI managed to work with a lot of very talented young players. Academies are all about the players; it is only ever about their development.\u201d\n\nCooper\u2019s enthusiasm for reflecting on the past is revived noticeably when the subject of who his biggest influences were at Liverpool arises.\n\n\u201cI met a really important person there, a guy called Pep Segura. He had a massive influence on me. He influenced me when it came to game understanding and the methodology of things,\u201d says Cooper.\n\nCooper with Segura (Photo: Joe Giddens \u2013 PA Images via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI was lucky enough as well that Sir Kenny (Dalglish) was still working there before he went back to being with the first team. It was brilliant to spend some time around such an iconic guy like him. They were important times for me, in terms of learning and developing as a coach.\u201d\n\nIt was Segura, who had previously managed Olympiakos and Barcelona B \u2014 where he helped develop talents such as Andres Iniesta, Gerard Pique and Cesc Fabregas \u2014 that Cooper quickly formed a close relationship with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPep was and is a major influence because I still speak to him now. He helped me understand how the game can be played and what it takes to play that way. Not so much just playing \u2014 it was about how you train as well; how you prepare players to do things in the way that you want. He taught me about the methodology behind things as well as how to do things.\n\n\u201cThe biggest message that Pep gave me was that you\u2019ve got to know what you want your team to look like. That\u2019s what I pride myself on now \u2014 having a clear view of when the team is getting it right and where I want them to go, but also how to get there. Pep put me on a different track, really.\n\n\u201cWhat is important in coaching is that you find your own way. You find what you really believe in as a coach. Because, in the end, you want your team to be a reflection of what you believe in. Pep was important to me. What I have learnt, most of all, is that what you think yourself is most important of all. I am still on that journey.\u201d\n\nCooper will not come up against Alexander-Arnold, who has developed into an integral figure at Liverpool and, arguably, one of the best right-backs in the world. The defender will be missing at the City Ground through injury. But Cooper plays down the thought of missing out on a reunion with his former player \u2014 and on any notion of him deserving any credit for the progress of players like him.\n\n\u201cCoaches don\u2019t produce players \u2014 players produce themselves. That is always something I have thought. I never think about any coach being part of a player\u2019s evolution. We are there, along the way,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cPlayers are the ones who deserve the credit for what they achieve. If they do well, they are the ones who deserve the praise for it, because it is their hard work that has got them there.\n\n\u201cWhether they turn into footballers or just good young men, that is what development is all about. It is the same here now. We have a host of young players who are working to get established. It is an ongoing daily journey.\n\n\u201cBut with Trent, I don\u2019t see it as missing out on a reunion, exactly. There are not many games where we do not come up against somebody I have worked with. Chris Willock and Andre Dozzell played with QPR. Before that, against Reading, they had Tom Dele-Bashiru in their squad. There are always players you come up against who you have a past relationship with.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForest have already beaten Arsenal and Leicester on their way to the quarter-final. It feels like their biggest test yet against Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side.\n\nIf they are to pull off another upset, much will depend on the talented younger players within Forest\u2019s own squad. Brennan Johnson and Djed Spence have formed a dangerous partnership down the right flank, James Garner and Ryan Yates have a dynamic midfield partnership and Keinan Davis has been almost unstoppable up front in recent weeks.\n\nSpence celebrates his goal against QPR this week with Johnson (left) and Worrall (right) (Photo: Jon Hobley/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that young players need these experiences. Players are shaped by all experiences, be they good, bad or indifferent. But it is often the latter two that are the most important,\u201d says Cooper, who will also hope to guide Forest into the play-offs in the remaining 10 games of the Championship season. \u201cThat is where you learn the most from. It is about the difficult situations and how you respond to them. That is what defines you. It is how you respond to setbacks that shapes you.\n\n\u201cI am a big believer in self-worth in people; a big believer in positivity and what you can do. We definitely like to have positivity around our daily routines, in the terminology we use and the intent of our days. We always try to focus on ourselves, on our environment and trying to achieve \u2014 to be successful. We attack challenges, we attack big games and embrace them rather than fear them. That is our mentality and if that is building belief and building confidence, then great.\n\n\u201cEvery day I ask the players to be the best version of themselves, to be winners and to give their best; to train and play in a way that we want to do things \u2014 to behave the way we want to behave. But we have not turned things around here. Not yet. We have made some good steps. We have work still to do.\u201d\n\nPaul Taylor\n\n\u201cCoops is destined to manage in the Premier League, I\u2019m sure of it,\u201d Morecambe\u2019s Northern Irish full-back Ryan McLaughlin tells The Athletic.\n\n\u201cEven all those years ago at Liverpool it was clear that he had everything you need to make the leap from youth coaching to a senior environment. I don\u2019t think any of us have been surprised by how well he has done.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcLaughlin played for Liverpool Under-18s under Cooper a decade ago. They reached the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup where they were beaten 4-1 on aggregate by a Chelsea side including Nathan Ake and Ruben Loftus-Cheek.\n\nCooper during the FA Youth Cup semi-final first leg against Chelsea at Anfield on April 12, 2013 (Photo: Paul Thomas \u2013 The FA/The FA via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIt was Coops\u2019 attention to detail that really stood out for me. He was very good at seeing things in your game that needed to be worked on. Then he would be relentless in terms of pummelling that into you every day on the training field,\u201d he recalls.\n\n\u201cBefore we played Chelsea he talked to me about what I\u2019d be up against in their winger Jeremie Boga. He knew him inside out. He got the balance spot on between giving you good info about what to expect but not freaking you out. He sold it to you as a brilliant challenge. He never over-complicated things. He was a really good communicator. I remember how enjoyable it was playing for him.\u201d\n\nCooper initially joined Liverpool from Wrexham in 2008. In the summer of 2011 he was promoted to academy manager by Dalglish to work closely with academy director Frank McParland, who also had a spell working at Forest during Mark Warburton\u2019s tenure.\n\nThe previous season Cooper had enhanced his reputation after stepping up to assist the academy\u2019s technical director Segura with the reserves following the departure of coach John McMahon.\n\n\u201cCoops and Pep had a great relationship,\u201d says McLaughlin. \u201cI know Coops took a lot from working with Pep. The Barcelona way is Coops\u2019 way. He always wanted to be expansive with the full-backs high and wide. He always wanted us to be brave in possession.\u201d\n\nThe appointment of Brendan Rodgers as Liverpool manager in 2012 sparked another reshuffle at Kirkby. With under-18s coach Mike Marsh added to Rodgers\u2019 senior staff at Melwood, Cooper took charge of the under-18s for the 2012-13 season. His squad included the likes of Jordan Rossiter, Jon Flanagan, Ryan Kent, Jerome Sinclair, Sheyi Ojo, Harry Wilson, Jordon Ibe, Tom Brewitt, Cameron Brannagan and Jordan Williams.\n\nMcLaughlin was coached by Cooper at Liverpool (Photo: Sebastian Frej/MB Media/Getty Images)\n\nWilliams, who currently plays for Bolton Wanderers in League One, was one of Cooper\u2019s youngsters who broke into Rodgers\u2019 first-team set-up, making his senior debut in a League Cup tie against Middlesbrough at Anfield in 2014.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Coops since I was nine years old and he was coaching at Wrexham. I\u2019ve always had a good relationship with him and we\u2019re still in contact a few times a month with messages going back and forth,\u201d Williams tells The Athletic. \u201cHe moved on to Liverpool when I was in the under-13s at Wrexham and then when I made the same move he was my under-16s coach at Kirkby. We had a great team. I think we only lost two games under him all season.\n\n\u201cCoops could be quite hard on us but not in a bad way. He set standards every day and he didn\u2019t like anyone falling below them. He knew what each player needed to get them going and would personalise it.\n\n\u201cI always remember striker Jerome Sinclair (who later signed for Watford) had his best season under Coops. He used to work so hard with Jerome on the training pitch. He knew he needed an arm around the shoulder, while he knew that I needed more of a kick up the ass. You can tell if someone is more suited to being a coach than a manager. Coops always had both sides. His training sessions were good and he knew how to set a team up tactically. But he also knew how to handle egos off the pitch, which is important.\u201d\n\nCentre-back Brewitt had only just turned 16 when Cooper gave him his FA Youth Cup debut in a fifth round victory over Leeds United.\n\n\u201cCoops was great for me,\u201d says Brewitt, who currently plays for Connecticut-based Hartford Athletic in the USL Championship.\n\n\u201cI was one of the youngest in the squad but he always knew how to fill me with confidence while also ensuring I was on edge to get the best out of me. He had a way of taking you out of your comfort zone. Not to a point where you couldn\u2019t perform, but to help you grow as a player.\n\n\u201cShortly before I made my FA Youth Cup debut he told me \u2018You\u2019re not in the team because of the injuries, you\u2019re in it because I picked you and I believe in you\u2019. We won 3-1 and I cleared one off the line. I felt like I had his trust and I was desperate to impress him.\n\n\u201cThere was always a feeling between us as players that Coops would go on to manage in first-team football. It was the way he went about things. He was less of a pure talent developer and more of a manager in terms of his tactics and getting the best out of players.\n\n\u201cThere was definitely an edge to him. He wasn\u2019t shy in terms of giving out a bollocking. But any criticism was always constructive. He made players better from working with them but he also made it clear that we were there to win and we needed to win in a certain way.\u201d\n\nRodgers rejigged the academy structure when at Liverpool (Photo: Clint Hughes/Getty Images)\n\nWilliams was sidelined by a knee injury for most of the 2012-13 season when Cooper was in charge of the under-18s.\n\n\u201cSometimes when you\u2019re injured managers forget all about you, but Coops cared and always went out of his way to help during a tough period,\u201d he recalls. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the nicest people I\u2019ve ever met off the pitch. He cares about what\u2019s going on in your life away from football.\n\n\u201cWhen I got promoted with Bolton, he was in touch with me straight away. When my dad passed away, Coops was the first person to come around the house. That says a lot about him.\u201d\n\nWhen Cooper left Liverpool in the summer of 2013, it was a shock for his players. His contract wasn\u2019t renewed as Rodgers\u2019 overhaul of the academy gathered pace.\n\nIt was a period of significant change at Kirkby as Rodgers sought to exert his authority. Segura had stepped down in 2012 citing a desire to return home to Spain. However, his decision was also influenced by the fact he missed out on a more senior role after the owners ditched plans to appoint a technical director and a sporting director to work with Rodgers, who had demanded sole control.\n\nAlex Inglethorpe, the current academy director, was brought in from Tottenham initially as under-21s coach and Michael Beale, currently No 2 to Steven Gerrard at Aston Villa, was recruited from Chelsea. Cooper\u2019s exit was swiftly followed by the sackings of academy head coach Rodolfo Borrell, now Pep Guardiola\u2019s assistant at Manchester City, and academy director McParland. Neil Critchley, now manager of Blackpool, had arrived from Crewe to take over from Cooper after being headhunted by Rodgers.\n\n\u201cIt was a big surprise when Coops left and I\u2019m not sure what went on,\u201d says McLaughlin. \u201cWe were never told the finer details, but obviously Brendan had come in as manager and was putting his own stamp on things.\n\n\u201cCoops was similar to Michael Beale and Alex Inglethorpe in terms of his approach to the game \u2014 young and very driven. Whenever I went back home to Northern Ireland people would ask me what the coaches were like at Liverpool and I\u2019d always say how lucky I was. As well as Coops, I worked with Mick Beale, Mike Marsh, Rodolfo Borrell and Alex Inglethorpe. They have all done well for themselves.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about the academy at Liverpool is that they develop coaches as well as players. Just look at the job Mick is doing at Villa and Critch at Blackpool. I enjoyed working with Coops, but I think it\u2019s only now that I fully appreciate what a brilliant coach he was.\u201d\n\nWilliams adds: \u201cWe were gutted about Coops going because we all loved playing for him. We just turned up one day and he had been replaced.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it has ever affected what Coops thinks about Liverpool. He still speaks highly of the club. He became a fan. He moved on and put everything into his new challenges.\u201d\n\nCooper twice led Swansea into the play-offs before being recruited by Forest, following the departure of Chris Hughton.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a smart move by Forest,\u201d says McLaughlin. \u201cThe impact he\u2019s had has been amazing. They\u2019re great to watch and they\u2019re winning. He has turned them into promotion contenders. He had a great education at Liverpool and as players we all benefited from that time we spent with him.\u201d\n\nWilliams agrees, saying: \u201cEverywhere Coops has been he has improved the teams he\u2019s had.\n\n\u201cI know Yan Dhanda and he really enjoyed playing for him at Swansea. Now he\u2019s got Forest flying. I\u2019m made up for him. Great coach, great person.\u201d\n\nJames Pearce\n\n(Photos: Getty Images; graphic: Tom Slator)"}, {"url": "https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/steve-cooper-liverpool-former-academy-coach-masterminded-nottingham-forest-play-off-charge-1527129", "page_content": "Pep Guardiola recognises the moment that gave England the impetus they needed to push on with their demand to step out of international football\u2019s shadows and compete again as a contender. In October 2017, in India, England won a World Cup at any age group for the first time since 1966 when their Under-17 team beat Spain 5-2 in the final.\n\n\u201cBig congratulations to the manager,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cIt is the step England needed. It happened in Spain. Spain was always in the last-16, quarter-finals. Then they arrived one moment in the semi-finals and since then they have won every time. That\u2019s why it is so important. To finally win.\u201d\n\nThe stars of that England team were its young attackers, a group of teenagers who finally had overwhelming evidence to push for regular league minutes. From the 2015 Under-17 World Cup squad, only one has made a senior international appearance. Five years on from 2017, five of that squad already have: Phil Foden, Jadon Sancho, Conor Gallagher, Emile Smith-Rowe and Callum Hudson-Odoi. Marc Guehi could become the sixth after receiving his first call-up last week.\n\nIt was also a masterclass of the coaching system, the strategy through which the Football Association really did hope to shift the preconceptions of English football. The Under-17s took separate in-possession and out-of-possession coaches, a goalkeeper coach, two fitness coaches, two analysts, two physios, a doctor, a chef, an education officer and a psychologist.\n\nSteve Cooper, the head coach of that World Cup-winning team, has since enjoyed a rapid progression of his own. Leaving his role in 2019 to join Swansea, he led them to two successive Championship playoff campaigns before departing at the end of his second season (Swansea are now 16th). When Chris Hughton was sacked in September, Nottingham Forest had taken one point from seven league games. Since then, only leaders Fulham have taken more Championship points. Cooper is masterminding another remarkable rise.\n\nOn Sunday, Forest play in the last eight of any competition for the first time since Bayern Munich in the Uefa Cup in 1996. This club has undergone several mini-eras since, few of them pleasant: play-off heartache, League One relegation, the chaos of Fawaz Al-Hasawi\u2019s ownership, the managerial merry-go-round, Greeks bearing gifts. Supporters have seen enough false dawns to fill a calendar, but few managers have got under their skin quite like Cooper.\n\nSunday\u2019s tie offers a fine chance to reflect on Cooper\u2019s coaching career, now almost 25 years in length despite him still being the ninth youngest manager in the top two tiers of English football. A steady but unspectacular player \u2013 by his own admission \u2013 he began coaching young age groups at Wrexham at the age of 19. Budgets were tight; Cooper became a minibus driver, a manager, a mentor and a fixture secretary all at once. He immediately fell in love with coaching. This was his vocation.\n\nIn 2008, having already become one of the youngest coaches in Europe to earn their UEFA Pro Licence, Cooper was headhunted by Forest\u2019s Sunday opponents Liverpool. Initially overseeing the development of academy players aged between 12 and 16, in the space of five years, he was promoted to academy manager and then Under-18s coach, working with Trent Alexander-Arnold, Raheem Sterling and Conor Coady, amongst others. More importantly, he worked under Jose Segura, a Spanish coach who would go on to be Barcelona\u2019s head of academy and then general manager.\n\nIt was through Segura that Cooper defined his preferred playing style: possession-based, aggressive pressing when the ball is lost and a coach who demands that his players are courageous with their forward passing. At Swansea, that occasionally became quite defensive without enough flair players to shift through the gears. At Forest, Cooper appears to have got the balance right.\n\nCooper won the World Cup with England\u2019s U17s in 2017 (Photo: Getty)\n\nThat long history in academy football and with England\u2019s age-group teams provides Cooper with a distinct advantage. The breakout stars of the Forest team that will take on Liverpool are Middlesbrough loanee Djed Spence and academy graduate Brennan Johnson, aged 21 and 20 respectively. Keinan Davis, 24 but with only 22 career league starts before this season, has been a revelation since Lewis Grabban got injured. James Garner, on loan from Manchester United, has kicked on again under Cooper. Ryan Yates has become an excellent all-action midfielder who reinforces the connection with the local community.\n\n\u201cSteve is prepared to place trust in young players,\u201d says Ian Foster. Foster was one of Cooper\u2019s coaches with the Under-17s who is now the England Under-19s head coach. \u201cWe have seen that throughout his career, from his player development at Liverpool, Wrexham and England and then how he has operated at Swansea and now at Forest. He creates pathways for players. And his history of developing talent means that more senior players will always be on board with it. Some of them become part of his leadership, so everyone is working on the same page.\u201d\n\nThat community has a power that Cooper has understood wherever he has coached. \u201cYou just have to make time for people, particularly if they show a bit of interest in you,\u201d he said the week after his appointment at the City Ground. \u201cWe want to be decent people, we want to represent the traditions and the values of the club to the level that they deserve.\u201d After each victory, Cooper raises his fist three times to each stand and hears them cheer thrice in return. It has become an emblem of their Championship progress.\n\nOne of the integral elements of Cooper\u2019s style is collaboration, a deliberate destruction of ego and the traditional manager-player relationship. At the Under-17 World Cup, he would work with the players on game approach and opposition analysis, asking them to problem solve between each other. At Forest, Grabban has worked with Davis, Steve Cook with the younger centre-backs. What\u2019s the point in telling them what to do when they are more likely to do it if it\u2019s their own solution?\n\n\u201cThe great shift that has taken place is a realisation that these young players can handle it,\u201d says Foster. \u201cThey have the technique, the tactical awareness, the physical prowess. All they needed was regular minutes, a chance to show what they can do. Steve is prepared to provide that opportunity, but he\u2019s also prepared to challenge them and support them to find solutions. That\u2019s how we develop rounded players.\u201d\n\nThere are no guarantees at Nottingham Forest; this club has repeatedly promised and not delivered, delivered but fallen short. They are emphatic second favourites against Liverpool and still outsiders for promotion after their dismal start to the season.\n\nBut, for now, none of that really matters. More important than playing in the Premier League is having a club that, finally, seems on a firm footing. If that\u2019s not only down to one man, supporters know that one man has made a bigger difference than most. On Sunday Steve Cooper revisits his own history. He\u2019s more interested in the relentless pursuit of his, and Nottingham Forest\u2019s, future."}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/2830390/2021/09/21/why-did-forest-want-steve-cooper-what-can-fans-expect-from-the-new-head-coach/", "page_content": "Football is regularly peppered with \u201cnearly\u201d moments.\n\nAs Sabri Lamouchi\u2019s tenure at Nottingham Forest stuttered to an ill-fitting end this time last year, several managers were linked with the job.\n\nAmong those names, one was slightly surprising, as Forest were made aware that then-Swansea City manager Steve Cooper would be interested in the role, if and when it became available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end, the impressive CV of Chris Hughton, who had won Premier League promotion with Newcastle and Brighton, persuaded the Championship club to appoint him. But fast forward just shy of 12 months and, as Forest drew up a list of potential replacements for Hughton, one name stood out.\n\nCooper, now clubless after leaving Swansea in July, ticked almost all of their required boxes.\n\nDane Murphy was in America for his wedding last Friday but Forest\u2019s recently appointed chief executive has still been front and centre in the process over the last few weeks, as the club hierarchy decided who they wanted in the dugout.\n\nThe tide actually turned for Hughton after the 2-1 defeat to Blackburn Rovers in the third league game of the new season, making it three defeats out of three, almost exactly a month ago. It was at that point the Forest top brass began to seriously consider their options.\n\nA shortlist started to be drawn up, featuring at least two names from overseas, as results continued to deteriorate in the following weeks. Some of the candidates were employed, which presented an immediate problem for a club looking to make a quick appointment.\n\nChris Wilder and John Terry were never on the list, contrary to reports elsewhere. Cooper\u2019s name always featured prominently.\n\nFor Murphy and Forest, three things made the 41-year-old stand out as they looked to make an appointment that would fit into their philosophy of wanting to build a team around young players with ambition and potential.\n\nThe first quality that pointed them towards the Welshman was his track record of what they see as overachievement.\n\nForest\u2019s analytical approach led them to regard Cooper as someone who led a Swansea squad not too different in quality to the one that struggled last term under Lamouchi and Hughton to the Championship play-offs in both his seasons in charge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Forest never climbed out of the bottom half of the table, a Swansea side who had painfully pipped them to sixth place on the final day of the 2019-20 regular season, were in the play-offs race again for much of the campaign, came fourth, then got past Barnsley over two legs before losing the final to Brentford.\n\nThe second box was ticked by Cooper\u2019s experience working with young players.\n\nA former head of the academies at both Wrexham and Liverpool, he went on to coach England\u2019s under-16 and then under-17 sides. In the space of five months in 2017, his England team lost to Spain on penalties in the Under-17 European Championship final then got revenge by beating the same opposition 5-2 to win that age group\u2019s World Cup final. Players he coached at that time included Phil Foden, Jadon Sancho and Callum Hudson-Odoi.\n\nLastly, after succeeding now-Brighton manager Graham Potter at Swansea in 2019, Cooper found a way to get the best out of a group of players who had previously been on a downward trajectory, following relegation from the Premier League a year before. Utilising contacts he had built in his previous role with the FA, Swansea secured the loan signings of players including Rhian Brewster, Marc Guehi and Conor Gallagher, who all played under him in those England age-group sides.\n\nSome Swansea fans complained about the style of play, but it was effective, successful football; Cooper proved to be good at utilising the players at his disposal.\n\nAs Forest look to pull themselves clear of relegation trouble with a youthful squad, they believe these qualities could be vital.\n\nWhat is he like as a person and manager?\n\nIt is a complicated challenge trying to sum up the legacy Cooper left at Swansea.\n\nThe headline is that he finished sixth and fourth in the Championship in his two seasons in charge, reaching one play-off final. But there is far more nuance to it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe took over Swansea at a difficult time. Forward Oli McBurnie was sold to Sheffield United just after his appointment and winger Daniel James had left for Manchester United in the weeks before, depriving him of the team\u2019s best two attacking players.\n\nCooper also inherited an awkward situation with Andre Ayew, who had been loaned to Turkish side Fenerbahce for the season following relegation and was now expected to be sold permanently.\n\nThere were question marks over what Ayew\u2019s attitude would be like if he was not moved on but Cooper worked hard to get him onside; to persuade him to play at second-division level. He duly scored 16 Championship and play-offs goals in 2019-20, then another 17 last season and paid tribute to Cooper\u2019s influence as they both left the Welsh club this summer.\n\nCooper also used his contacts to persuade England manager Gareth Southgate to have a Zoom meeting with his Swansea captain Matt Grimes, as he felt the midfielder would benefit from an in-depth discussion about the nature of leadership.\n\n\u201cIt was just me and him, like this, on a call for an hour and a half, talking about all the things it takes to be a leader and to get the best out of the people around you,\u201d Grimes told The Athletic at the time.\n\nCooper embraced Swansea as a place, getting himself a flat in the city and representing the club in the community, even if much of his tenure saw their games played behind closed doors because of the pandemic.\n\nHe is not a character who likes the limelight, who seeks praise for his work. He is humble, but also fiercely ambitious. He wants to get to the highest level possible in management; there is a drive within him.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Cooper \u201cmanages up\u201d at Forest. Having had a very positive, close relationship with Trevor Birch, the CEO who appointed him, he did not form the same bond with Julian Winter, Birch\u2019s successor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCooper\u2019s relationship with the Swansea hierarchy deteriorated in the second half of last season, which led to his departure.\n\nThere was a feeling he was disappointed the club did not sign a striker in January, which meant having to use Ayew as a No 9, which was not his natural position, as well as converting winger Jamal Lowe into a centre-forward.\n\nWith more key players having left over the summer after another promotion near-miss, Cooper decided the time was right to step away from Swansea, as he perhaps sensed the struggle that was to come. (Their new manager Russell Martin has six points after seven games, half of them from goalless draws in three of their four home matches.)\n\nBut he has joined Forest because he believes he can change the fortunes of another club.\n\nWhat is Cooper\u2019s tactical approach?\n\nAt Swansea, the approach was not obviously direct and it was not particularly possession-based.\n\nLooking at \u201cdirect speed\u201d shows how fast a team typically advance the ball towards goal (in metres per second), with a higher number showing a team that is more willing to get the ball forward quickly. Last season, Swansea were about average in the speed in which they advanced the ball \u2014 1.6 metres per second on average.\n\nA speed of attack can be considered in alongside a more possession-based style, where a team with a high volume of \u201cpasses per sequence\u201d suggests a considered build-up in making many passes rather than a single ball hoofed upfield. Again, Swansea hovered close to average here, with 2.8 passes per sequence in which they had the ball last season.\n\nBut it was effective and efficient.\n\nSwansea were difficult to break down. They did not concede many too many shots last season (11.1 per 90), and on average, the quality of those shots were low (0.1 xG per shot conceded). Swansea\u2019s defensive record was poor before his arrival, but Cooper brought organisation, improved them at set pieces and generally made them more solid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefensive solidity was preferred to swashbuckling play out of possession, as shown by Swansea\u2019s passes per defensive action (PPDA) last season. That is, they allowed 13.2 opposition passes before making a defensive action, which was fairly passive relative to the rest of the league. It shows that Cooper preferred good organisation and structure than high energy, pressing play.\n\nTerritorially, Swansea\u2019s possession was not exactly camped in the opponent\u2019s box last season. Their field tilt \u2014 which measures the share of possession a team has in a game only using passes in the attacking third \u2014 was about average, with a 52 per cent share of touches in the attacking third compared with their opponent\u2019s touches in their respective final third.\n\nAt a time when Forest want to stop the rot, that will not be a bad starting point.\n\nCooper\u2019s philosophy is perhaps different to what was sometimes evident from his Swansea teams. Those close to him say he does carry a desire to play possession-based, expansive football.\n\nForest have assembled a squad with a plan to play 3-4-1-2 this season, making 10 additions during the summer transfer window.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Cooper retains the more structured, disciplined approach that brought success at Swansea, where they found a way to win with a very specific group of players, or whether he will have a different mentality with this different squad.\n\nThere are stats to support the notion that he was also a little bit misunderstood in west Wales.\n\nOver the course of Cooper\u2019s two seasons in charge, Swansea kept a Championship-best 35 clean sheets and conceded the fewest goals (15) from set pieces. They played the second-least long balls in the division under him, while registering the second-highest pass total overall.\n\nThey also played the second-most passes into the final third of the pitch and scored the fifth-most goals (120).\n\nWhat is certain is that Swansea overachieved to get themselves to last season\u2019s play-off final with the tools at Cooper\u2019s disposal.\n\nSwansea fans will remember a dismal performance once they reached Wembley, losing 2-0 to Brentford without registering a shot on target. But propping up the Championship table as they are, Forest\u2019s need for points, for substance, is the most immediate priority.\n\nStyle is something that can be worked on later.\n\nWhat situation is Cooper coming into?\n\nCooper\u2019s job title at Forest won\u2019t be \u201cmanager\u201d. He will be the head coach.\n\nWhen Murphy was appointed as CEO, there were questions raised about how Hughton would fit into the new set-up as an old-school manager.\n\nIn the end, it was results, more than anything else, that prompted a change. But Cooper will sit more comfortably into the club\u2019s philosophy and structure all-round than Hughton.\n\nHe is still expected to have a say on transfers \u2014 possibly even the final say \u2014 but the recruitment team will generally oversee exactly that, while working alongside the head coach.\n\nGeorge Syrianos is head of data and analytic recruitment after arriving this summer from Bundesliga side Stuttgart. Chris Brass\u2019s title has been revealed as director of scouting/head of academy recruitment, while Taymour Roushdi, who worked with Murphy at Barnsley, is now head of football administration.\n\nThere is a structure in place and that will be further bolstered by the appointment of Steve Rands \u2014 who worked with Roberto Mancini and Pep Guardiola at Manchester City before working alongside Cooper at Swansea over the last two seasons \u2014 as head of performance analysis, as well as Alan Tate to the backroom staff.\n\nMartyn Margetson \u2014 who was goalkeeper coach under Cooper at Swansea \u2014 will not be joining Forest, however. He is understood to have taken an increased role with the FA in the England set-up \u2014 a role he performed alongside his duties at the Welsh club. Steven Reid, who took charge of Forest\u2019s 2-0 victory over Huddersfield at the weekend, is also expected to be part of Cooper\u2019s team.\n\nCrucially, Cooper is understood to be excited about what this new-look staff can achieve together, having held extensive discussions with Murphy in particular about the way forward.\n\nHaving finally started his relationship with Forest, he will hope that more success soon follows.\n\n(Photo: Nottingham Forest)"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/57918658", "page_content": "Steve Cooper took charge of Swansea's friendly win at Plymouth on Tuesday night\n\nSteve Cooper has left his position as Swansea City's head coach.\n\nCooper, 41, had been in charge at the Championship club since June 2019 and had a year remaining on his contract.\n\nHe led Swansea to the play-offs in each of his two seasons in charge.\n\n\"I am very proud of what we have achieved over the past two seasons, especially getting to the play-off final, but it feels like a good time for all parties to make a change,\" Cooper told Swansea City's website.\n\n\"It is a fantastic club, with incredible supporters and I am very grateful to them, to the players and all the staff for making me so welcome here. I wish the team every success for the future.\"\n\nThere had been continued speculation Cooper could depart after defeat to Brentford at Wembley in May in the Championship play-off final.\n\nSwansea say they made \"efforts\" to discuss the idea of a new contract with Cooper, but that it was \"subsequently agreed by both parties to mutually part ways\".\n\n\"We feel this conclusion is in the best interests of the club with a new season just over two weeks away,\" said Swansea chief executive Julian Winter.\n\n\"This decision was reached amicably two weeks ago, and I would like to place on record my thanks to Steve for taking pre-season and for his professionalism while this process has been resolved.\n\n\"During his two years in charge, Steve has immersed himself in the club and continually improved our league position as well as giving young players a first-team opportunity.\n\n\"It has been well-documented that since the club dropped out of the Premier League, the financial position was one that meant the club had to be far more sustainable and we are pleased that so many young players have come here and been afforded that opportunity by Steve and his coaching staff.\n\n\"Just like the playing squad, when a manager has 12 months left on a contract, there has to be a coherent plan that allows the club to continue to build both on and off the pitch, and that involves dialogue around contracts.\n\n\"We felt as a club that the situation needed clarity and with a new season edging closer, the mutual nature of this decision allows both parties a chance to look forward.\n\n\"I would like to take this opportunity to wish Steve the best of luck for the future and thank him for the work he has done during his two years with the football club.\"\n\nFormer England Under-17 coach Cooper was in the dugout for Swansea's pre-season friendly win at Plymouth Argyle on Tuesday night, but leaves the Liberty Stadium with the new Championship season a little over two weeks away.\n\nCooper is known to have had concerns about the strength of his playing squad following the summer departure of Andre Ayew as well as the exits of players like Freddie Woodman and Marc Guehi, who had impressed during loan spells.\n\nSwansea are hopeful of making a swift appointment as they seek Cooper's replacement, with potential candidates already being considered by the club's hierarchy.\n\nCooper's exit is not a shock given the long-standing question marks surrounding his position.\n\nHe was a contender to take over at Crystal Palace before Patrick Vieira landed that job, while he was also heavily linked with Fulham until they opted for Marco Silva.\n\nCooper impressed in his two seasons at Swansea, finishing sixth and then fourth in the second tier despite working on a limited budget.\n\nHe made a number of shrewd signings and produced a team who played attractive football at times, although Cooper's Swansea often ground out results, particularly in the 2020-21 campaign.\n\nThey showed their resilient side to beat Barnsley in last season's play-off semi-finals, but were beaten by Brentford - who had also been Swansea's conquerors in the previous year's play-offs - after a lacklustre display in the final.\n\nCooper has been at the helm for Swansea's pre-season campaign, and spoke to the media for the first time since missing out on a return to the Premier League following their 2-1 friendly win at Plymouth."}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/3668593/2022/10/08/steve-cooper-new-contract-at-forest/", "page_content": "On Monday night at Leicester, Steve Cooper wore the look of a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders during his post-match press conference.\n\nFour days later, as he sat in front of the media again, he cut a very different figure. Smiling, confident, relaxed \u2014 and able to focus on the future with at least a small degree of certainty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNottingham Forest have long been a club with an ability to surprise \u2014 since well before Evangelos Marinakis\u2019s tenure began. But, even by those standards, the scale of change over the last few days has been remarkable.\n\nOn Thursday, Steve Cooper and his Nottingham Forest coaching staff held a routine meeting with the players at the training ground to assess where things had gone wrong against Leicester City.\n\nCooper, in typically honest fashion, refused to blame the players for the result. Instead he is understood to have conceded that Forest\u2019s team selection and tactics were the reason for the 4-0 defeat, which looked like a farewell of sorts when the Welshman went over to acknowledge the travelling fans.\n\nSteve Cooper applauds fans after the 4-0 loss to Leicester (Photo: Joh Hobley/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nA discussion followed about how they could improve when Aston Villa visit the City Ground on Monday. The tone of the conversation is understood to have suggested the fixture could hold particular significance, if a sixth consecutive defeat was to follow.\n\nBut any sense among the players that their manager might be on dodgy ground will have been appeased a day later when the club announced that Cooper had put pen to paper on a new contract, which will run until 2025.\n\nIt was welcome news in the dressing room, where Cooper remains a popular figure among the squad, some of whom were part of the team he guided to promotion from the Championship last season, and some of whom were only persuaded to sign for Forest by the head coach in the last few months.\n\nIt is also a wise move from the club, as they look to quell the mood of uncertainty that had grown in recent weeks. Although there is also a case to be made that they had been a catalyst for much of that themselves.\n\nOn Tuesday, there was a sense around the club that Cooper\u2019s days were numbered: that defeat to previously bottom-of-the-table Leicester would be the final straw. Not least because alternative options had not only been discussed but, in some cases, had been contacted, via intermediaries, to assess their interest in joining Forest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is an age where fan power has an influence and the largely negative response to Forest\u2019s shortlist of targets \u2014 which was understood to have included Rafa Benitez, Sean Dyche, Nuno Espirito Santo and Bruno Lage \u2014 was noted by the Forest hierarchy. As was the fact that Cooper remains hugely popular among fans, demonstrated by supporters chanting his name noisily and extensively, even when defeat was certain in Leicester.\n\nForest\u2019s modus operandi, once they decide to make a change, has always been to work to get the new man in place before the trigger is pulled. In this case, the club found themselves in a position where viable alternatives were beginning to look as though they would not be a massive upgrade. The fact that Cooper has been on the radar of Southampton and Wolves was another factor, as Forest pondered whether it would be too hasty to get rid of a man who was being looked at by two of their Premier League rivals.\n\nThere was a meeting of the Forest hierarchy on Wednesday when it was decided that Cooper would be given more time. But even following that, there was a feeling that \u2018more time\u2019 could only be one more game.\n\nEven after signing a new deal, Cooper will still be judged on results; a failure to inspire a turnaround in fortunes will still ultimately have consequences for the former Swansea manager. But now, the man who inspired a sense of unity, togetherness and team spirit among the squad he inherited just over a year ago, will have the opportunity to do so again, amid a group of players that has been vastly transformed by the addition of 22 new signings during an ambitious \u00a3150million recruitment drive.\n\nCooper is understood to have met owner Evangelos Marinakis for talks last weekend, with the Greek shipping magnate keen to understand what his head coach felt the problems were. And further conversations were held yesterday between Cooper and the club hierarchy, although he described them as being \u201cnormal\u201d discussions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened this week,\u201d said Cooper, when asked if he had held talks over his future in the last few days. \u201cWe spoke after the game, as usual. I have to say the conversations I have with the ownership and with Dane (Murphy)\u2026 they have always been a discussion, rather than one person talking.\n\n\u201cThis is just normal. We were all really disappointed after Monday. Me first of all. But so were they. We talk about what went wrong in the game, what went right. I am always the first one to say, \u2018We should have done that better\u2019. But don\u2019t think that it has been along the lines of, \u2018Let\u2019s start the process now of negotiating a contract\u2019 on Tuesday morning. It has been something that has happened over a long while.\n\n\u201cI have had conversations with the hierarchy in the last few days. But they were just normal conversations.\u201d\n\nAnother significant change has seen Filippo Giraldi, who previously oversaw recruitment at Watford, appointed as sporting director. The list of players signed during his tenure there is impressive and includes Abdoulaye Doucoure, Etienne Capoue, Joao Pedro and Richarlison. He also played a part in building a structure to support the first team at Watford. Forest have handed him similar responsibilities. Giraldi met Cooper and the other senior figures at the Nigel Doughty Academy on Thursday.\n\nForest\u2019s new sporting director Filippo Giraldi, pictured in 2020 (Photo: Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cFilippo has come in and we have talked about that,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed my relationship so far with people above. I hope, and I\u2019m sure, that will continue now with people coming in. I\u2019m looking forward to working with him. I only met him for the first time in the last few days. Hopefully we\u2019ve started as we mean to go on. It\u2019s very modern now to have a technical director, sporting director, and working collaboratively. I\u2019m all for that.\n\n\u201cIf the club thinks the appointment will help us improve and take us forward, then they\u2019ve completely got my support. I\u2019m looking forward to being involved in that.\u201d\n\nCooper admits he is happy about one more thing: the fact that the weekly questions he faced about when he was going to sign his new deal can now be put to bed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe contract is great, because it brings an end to the questioning. But it does not change me. I could not work any harder. I could not love this club any more or want to fight any more, particularly in the moment we are in now,\u201d he says. \u201cWhether I had a very short-term contract or a very long-term one, it would not change that.\n\n\u201cI have not been thinking about it as much as others might have been. I have always said that when I was asked questions about it, and it was not just me swerving those questions. Talks have been ongoing, things have been progressing, and if we feel now is a good time to renew that is fine by me. But the main thing is that we just go and win on Monday.\n\n\u201cWith any sort of contract, it is always good to have clarity on which way a club is thinking about going. If at the moment it is a commitment to me, then of course that is mutual.\n\n\u201cIf there were any questions in some players minds \u2014 and they might have been thinking change was a good thing! \u2014 that is normal. I don\u2019t know how close that might have been. That is a club\u2019s prerogative with any manager, not just me.\n\n\u201cI alway said to myself, coming into first-team football, even before Swansea, that you know what you\u2019re coming into. I tried to promised myself then, and I\u2019ve stuck to that promise, that through the real highs and real lows, and you do go through those as a manager, I wanted to stick to what I believe in and stick to who I am.\n\n\u201cThrough good and bad times, you want to stick to what you believe in.\u201d\n\nWhen he led Forest to promotion at Wembley back in May, Cooper was an emotional figure afterwards, struggling to hold back his tears. He was not holding his emotions back to the same level at the Nigel Doughty Academy, but it was clear that the relationship he has forged with the club and its supporters is hugely important to him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery time somebody may have said something positively to me in the past, my natural feeling has just been to want to do well even more. If I bump into someone and they say they like the team or that the job I\u2019m doing is OK, I don\u2019t get in my car and go \u2018Happy days\u2019. I think I\u2019ve got to work even harder so that person can think even better of the team.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just how I am. Normally I get loads of stick from the kit man because I give something away. It\u2019s just how I am. This club is greater than any one person, one player, one whatever \u2014 maybe one manager, we stand on his shoulders and always will. But this club is unique and it\u2019s about being together. I have never been more determined to get things right.\u201d\n\n(Top photo: Michael Regan via Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/who-former-liverpool-coach-steve-16414096", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nAfter a three-week search, Swansea City are closing in on their man.\n\nSteve Cooper will be named as Graham Potter's successor in the next few days.\n\nYou can read all about him here.\n\nSet to follow him to South Wales is his colleague Mike Marsh; what are his credentials, what is his background and what can we expect from the incoming No.2?\n\nHere we profile the former Liverpool man who appears to be Swansea\u2019s assistant manager in waiting.\n\nWho is he?\n\nIn his playing days Marsh was primarily a midfielder but could also play at full-back.\n\nWhile playing for his local side Kirkby Town, 49-year-old Marsh was spotted by Liverpool defender Phil Thompson who advised then-Reds manager Kenny Dalglish to sign him. Marsh duly signed for the club in 1987 and was a first-team regular from 1991 to 1993 before he joined West Ham as part of the deal that saw Julian Dicks move in the opposite direction.\n\nLiverpool-born Marsh also featured for Coventry City, Galatasaray and Southend United as well as a number of non-league teams towards the end of his playing days.\n\nWhere has he worked?\n\nHe embarked upon his coaching career from humble beginnings at non-league Northwich Victoria and a stint as assistant manager and then caretaker manager of Bradford Park Avenue.\n\nHe then became Liverpool Academy under-16s coach before moving up to coach the under-18s side in 2011. From there he went on to the senior team, working under former Swansea City manager Brendan Rodgers who saw him as a vital part of young players\u2019 development.\n\nRodgers said of him: \"He will help build the bridge between the first team and the academy, because it's important for me that the bridge is smooth.\u201d\n\nHis contract at Liverpool was not renewed however after Rodgers felt that a change in his backroom staff was necessary and Marsh moved onto Huddersfield Town in 2015 where he worked under David Wagner, who also spoke glowingly of Marsh.\n\n\u201cMike is a very big help to us,\" the German said.\n\n\"He helps us understand the English culture and stops us making mistakes because of unknowns. Mike already has a very good relationship with the players and he knows a lot about our opponents.\u201d\n\nAnother move materialised a year later as he gained a coaching role with the England Under-17s national team \u2013 a position that he will relinquish should he be appointed by Swansea.\n\nHis role with the FA enables him to help develop the best players in England at age-grade level and also to work with Gareth Southgate who is heavily involved with the youth system.\n\nHe also currently holds the position of head academy coach at Accrington and Rossendale College in East Lancashire, which was attended by Gary and Phil Neville, which he balances with his primary role in the England youth system.\n\nHow does he know Cooper?\n\nBoth have links to Liverpool: Cooper having been involved with the academy during his days as a youth player and Marsh as a senior player in the early 90s, however it was for the England youth set-up that they worked together for the first time when Marsh joined in 2016.\n\nBoth were on the coaching team of the hugely successful England Under-17s side (featuring players such as Phil Foden, Jadon Sancho and Callum Hudson-Odoi) who won their respective age-grade World Cup in 2017. Swansea fans will hope that their collaboration, which has thus far proved to be such a success, will continue.\n\nWhat skills does he possess?\n\nHaving worked with a such a successful England youth team, it is clear to see that Marsh is capable of identifying potential in young players and has the ability to develop and nurture it.\n\nThe FA\u2019s head of development team coaching Matt Crocker said of the role that Marsh took on at youth level: \"These coaching roles have been designed to help us maximise the time on the pitch we have with the players for the international stage. It will really enable us to focus on particular areas of preparation and ensure we are developing the style of play we want to see from our development teams, as part of the England DNA.\u201d\n\nMarsh\u2019s ability to implement a strong sense of identity in a team\u2019s style of play is a key aspect of his imminent appointment at the Swans \u2013 it is a vital component in the improvement and progression of a young, developing team: a description befitting of Swansea at this time.\n\nSwansea chairman Trevor Birch has recognised the importance of this aspect of both Marsh and Cooper\u2019s expertise and suitability for their roles at the Liberty: \"One key criteria in identifying the new manager will be that he can work with these young players and help them to improve. That is crucial.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/steve-cooper-nottingham-forest-swansea-5926058", "page_content": "Nottingham Forest have appointed Steve Cooper as their new head coach following the departure of Chris Hughton.\n\nThe Reds had been without a manager since early on Thursday (September 16) as the Forest hierarchy parted company with Hughton at the City Ground.\n\nUnder Hughton the Reds had suffered their sixth Championship defeat in seven matches following a 2-0 home defeat to Middlesbrough.\n\nThe defeat continued Forest's woes in the league, extending a run which is their worst start to a season for more than 100 years, though they did break their duck with a 2-0 win at Huddersfield over the weekend.\n\nFormer Swansea City boss Cooper arrives at the City Ground with the priority being to lift the Reds from the bottom of the Championship and reignite Forest's season.\n\nNottinghamshireLive has taken a look at what Cooper will bring to Forest and how suitable an appointment it is...\n\nManagerial CV\n\nCooper enjoyed a relatively quiet playing career and made just a handful of appearances during a career which spanned five years between 1998 and 2003.\n\nFollowing a move to Wrexham in the late 1990s, Cooper was encouraged by then-manager Brian Flynn to step into coaching rather than pursue a playing career.\n\nAfter brief spells with The New Saints, Rhyl, Bangor City and Porthmadog, Cooper acted on the advice given to him by returning to Wrexham as a youth coach.\n\nAt the age of 27, he became one of the youngest coaches to obtain their UEFA Pro Licence.\n\nCooper progressed through the ranks at Wrexham, becoming the club's head of youth development, before moving to Liverpool in 2008 to initially coach the under-12s.\n\nFast forward three years and he was named Liverpool's academy manager. During this time he coached the Reds' under-18s for the 2012-13 season and took Liverpool to the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup.\n\nIn October 2014 Cooper linked up with the England set-up as manager of the under-16 team. A year later he led the under-17s.\n\nHaving achieved international success with the young Three Lions, Cooper took his first step into senior football management with Swansea City in June 2019.\n\nThe Swans were three points adrift of the play-offs when coronavirus paused football in March 2020 but, when the season resumed, they took advantage of Forest's capitulation to finish sixth.\n\nCooper's side lost 3-2 on aggregate to Brentford in the play-off semi-finals.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will auto-play soon 8 Cancel Play now\n\nHe led Swansea to the play-offs yet again the following year, but was unable to take the Welsh side across the final hurdle as they lost to Brentford again but in the final at Wembley Stadium.\n\nCooper departed Swansea City in July 2021 with mutual consent and has been on the search for a new job ever since.\n\nStyle of play\n\nUnder Cooper's guidance, Swansea City were a team difficult to break down and hard to defeat.\n\nIn his first season leading them, just nine of Swansea's 21 wins from the 2019/20 campaign by margins larger than just one goal.\n\nThat increased to 14 from 26 matches last season, including big wins over Millwall (3-0) and Nottingham Forest (5-1, FA Cup).\n\nSpeaking to NottinghamshireLive, WalesOnline's Swansea City reporter Ian Mitchelmore said: \"Swansea produced some dominant displays against the likes of Cardiff City and Millwall last season, but, more often than not, they were a side that would grind out results rather than outplaying their opponents.\n\n\"They gained a lot of points when being second best, which of course has its positives, although it isn't sustainable in the long-term.\n\n\"First and foremost, Cooper will want his side to be well drilled at the back and tough to beat. That quality alone would go a long way to helping Forest climb out of trouble.\"\n\nOne major positive, however, is Cooper's ability to keep clean sheets. Swansea City kept 23 across all competitions in 2020/21 before he left in the summer.\n\nMitchelmore explained: \"Swansea were incredibly strong defensively under Cooper and his fellow coaching staff.\n\n\"They boasted the worst defensive record in the 2018/19 Championship campaign under Graham Potter but posted the best record in the division in the same category under Cooper which represents a remarkable turnaround.\"\n\nHistory of youth development\n\nCooper's managerial career stems from having a vast amount of experience in youth football with Wrexham, Liverpool and England.\n\nWhilst Cooper was academy manager at Liverpool, he coached the Reds' under-18s for the 2012-13 season to the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup.\n\nPlayers such as Raheem Sterling, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ben Woodburn have all been developed under the watchful eye of Cooper at Liverpool.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nWith his role in the England camp, it was Cooper's squad which reached the final of the 2017 U17 European Championship and semi-finals of the same competition a year later.\n\nHe also led them to success in the 2017 U17 World Cup, beating Brazil 3-1 in the semis and Spain 5-2 in the final.\n\nThe likes of Jadon Sancho, Phil Foden and Callum Hudson-Odoi all benefited from his advice and coaching.\n\nWhen at Swansea City, Cooper utilised his contacts in youth football by organising loan deals to bring Rhian Brewster, Marc Guehi and Conor Gallagher (all of whom he had coached in the England set-up) to the Liberty Stadium.\n\nDoes it match Forest's newly found philosophy?\n\nForest CEO Dane Murphy recently said there were three objectives going into the summer transfer window: reduce costs, reduce squad size, and reduce the average age of the squad.\n\nGaribaldi Red podcast - listen and subscribe The Garibaldi Red podcast is our weekly Nottingham Forest podcast featuring fans, ex-players and managers or Forest supporting journalists, such as Darren Fletcher, Daniel Storey and Gregor Robertson.

He is the current head coach of Nottingham Forest having previously managed Swansea City and the England under-16 and under-17 set-ups.\n\nWith a relatively unimpressive playing career, highlighted by a two-year stint at Bangor City, Cooper's prowess comes via his coaching skills which have made him a highly sought after manager.\n\nHis notable work with the England youth teams included leading the under-17s to the final of the European Championship and victory in the World Cup. This success encouraged Swansea City to offer Cooper his first managerial role at club level in 2019.\n\nIn Cooper's two seasons at the South Wales outfit, he twice took the Swans to the play-offs. In his first season they lost out in the semi-finals to Brentford, who would again beat Cooper's side the next year, this time in the final. He left Swansea by mutual consent in the summer of 2021.\n\nIn September 2021 he was appointed head coach of Nottingham Forest, taking the club from the relegation zone to the play-offs, where they beat Huddersfield at Wembley. Forest had spent 20 seasons in the second tier prior to his arrival.\n\nSteve Cooper's early coaching career\n\nWhile still playing for Wrexham, Cooper trained to earn his UEFA pro license which he attained at 27, making him one of the youngest ever coaches to do so.\n\nHe went on to take up a position at Wrexham's academy as head of youth development and later moved to Liverpool in 2008 to work as a coach.\n\nAfter three years, Cooper was promoted to academy manager. He left in 2014 when the opportunity to manage England's under-17s arose.\n\nIn 2017, he coached his under-17s to the final of the UEFA European U17 Championship, losing out to Spain on penalties. Redemption came at the U17 World Cup, where again his team reached the final, this time hammering Spain 5-2.\n\nSteve Cooper's club career\n\nAfter five years managing the England youth set-up, Cooper was enticed by a job at Championship side Swansea City at the end of the 2018/19 season.\n\nIn his two seasons at the club, his knowledge of England's talented youth set-up allowed him to sign players such as Conor Gallagher and Marc Guehi, both of whom have gone on to represent the England first team.\n\nIn a dramatic end to his first season at the club, Swansea reached the play-offs on the final matchday of the season. A 91st-minute goal from Wayne Routledge secured a 4-1 victory over Reading but more crucially gave his side a superior goal difference to Nottingham Forest to pip the East Midlands club to sixth place.\n\nHowever despite a 1-0 win over Brentford in the first leg of the semi-finals, the Swans were defeated 3-1 at Griffin Park and missed out on the final.\n\nWell done Steve Cooper and all the players of @SwansOfficial getting to the play off final in Wembley\n\n\n\nCracking goal @Matt_Grimes8 pic.twitter.com/8t7zH7MSGv \u2014 \u00f0\u0178\u00b4\u00f3 \u00a7\u00f3 \u00a2\u00f3 \u00b7\u00f3 \u00ac\u00f3 \u00b3\u00f3 \u00bf \u00f0\u0178\u00a6\u00a2N D L \u00f0\u0178\u00a6\u00a2\u00f0\u0178\u00b4\u00f3 \u00a7\u00f3 \u00a2\u00f3 \u00b7\u00f3 \u00ac\u00f3 \u00b3\u00f3 \u00bf (@NDLane1) May 22, 2021\n\nIn his second season, Cooper again guided his team into the play-offs with a much more comfortable fourth-placed finish.\n\nA 2-1 aggregate win over |Barnsley saw them into the final. However, once again, Cooper couldn't get the better of Thomas Frank's Brentford as they were beaten 2-0 at Wembley.\n\nA little over a month after the defeat, Swansea announced that Cooper would not be renewing his contract and would be leaving the club.\n\nTransforming Nottingham Forest\n\nIn September 2021, Chris Hughton was fired from his role as Nottingham Forest manager, with the club enduring their worst start to a season in over a century.\n\nForest were bottom of the table having taken only one point from their opening seven games. On September 21, Steve Cooper was named as Hughton's successor.\n\nAlmost immediately, Cooper transformed Forest and they began to rise up the table.\n\nHis expertise once again came into play during the January transfer window, signing young talented forwards Sam Surridge and Keinan Davis, as well as experienced centre-half Steve Cook - additions which would ultimately propel the club to the top end of the table.\n\nIn the 35 matches following his appointment, Forest picked up a remarkable 72 points.\n\nWith two games remaining, Forest were just three points off the automatic promotion spots. However, defeat at Bournemouth meant Cooper would once again have to go down the play-off route.\n\nNottingham Forest win the Championship play-off final to secure promotion to the Premier League \u00f0\u0178\u2018\n\n\n\nThey were bottom of the table when manager Steve Cooper took over in September \u00f0\u0178\u00a4\u00af pic.twitter.com/fMA8SxZ3xz \u2014 GOAL News (@GoalNews) May 29, 2022\n\nForest earned a 2-1 at Bramall Lane in the first leg of their semi-final against Sheffield United.\n\nHowever, Cooper's play-off curse seemed to be in full effect as a second-half comeback from the Blades saw the tie finish 3-3. Extra-time couldn't split the sides and it went down to a penalty shootout, in which Forest keeper Brice Samba's heroics sent his side to Wembley for the first time since 1992.\n\nForest defeated Huddersfield Town 1-0 in the final, meaning a first Premier League this century, with Cooper achieving something Forest managers before him had failed to do."}, {"url": "https://www.vavel.com/en/football/2022/03/12/championship/1104854-the-key-quotes-from-steve-coopers-post-reading-press-conference.html", "page_content": "Nottingham Forest manager Steve Cooper was impressed with how his side upped their performance levels in the second half to thrash Reading 4-0 at the City Ground.\n\nThe Reds moved to within two points of the play-off places in the Championship and extended their unbeaten run in the league to six games, thanks to a scintillating second-half display.\n\nThe Forest boss also discussed the impressive display from loanee forward Keinan Davis, who came up with two vital goals in the victory.\n\nOn the overall performance\n\nThe home side went into the break a goal to the good, but that was not without a few scares late in the half, with Reading having a handful of clear-cut opportunities to equalise.\n\nCooper was quick to highlight his disappointment at the first-half display but was encouraged by how his players picked themselves up to put Reading to the sword in the second period.\n\nCooper opened with: \u201cWe fell short for the rest of the first half in terms of performance levels, and we needed half-time, and I was ready to gee the lads up.\n\n\u201cI could see the way they were talking to each other in the dressing room, and they did it themselves, so they knew that they fell short towards the end of the first half.\n\n\u201cIn the second half, we were a lot better, we were brave, and we moved the ball a lot quicker, and I always thought that the second goal would come.\n\n\u201cThe first half was a good reminder of what we don\u2019t want to do and the team we don\u2019t want to be, whereas the second half was exactly what we want to be.\u201d\n\nOn Keinan Davis\n\nThe Forest boss also expressed his delight over the performance of Davis, whose two goals showed clear areas in which the 24-year-old has already improved since making the loan switch from Aston Villa.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nCooper continued: \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of work with him [Keinan Davis], and Grabs [Lewis Grabban] has been doing a lot of work with him surrounding his finishing in the box.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s getting stronger; he played the full 90 minutes against Sheffield United, which was a significant milestone for him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of potential, and this loan is going to be vital for him because he is playing games and for a massive club while wearing the number nine, so there is some pressure on him.\n\n\u201cAside from the goals, I don\u2019t think I saw him give the ball away, he brings the ball down well and brings others into play, and that isn\u2019t just down to good coaching!\n\n\u201cI really wanted to sign him Swansea, so when the chance came this time around, I didn\u2019t hesitate, and today he showed that he is a really good, technical player.\u201d"}], "Steve Cooper has held a number of positions at clubs in the English Football League.": [{"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61565033", "page_content": "Nottingham Forest are in the Championship play-off final despite making their worst start to a season since 1913 before Steve Cooper took charge, having lost six of their opening seven games.\n\nNottingham Forest are not supposed to be in the Championship play-off final, not this season.\n\nA club who have gone through 14 bosses in 10 years, a club who were rock bottom of the Championship when Chris Hughton was sacked in September, a club who have become the ultimate example of a \"sleeping giant\" in English football.\n\nTwo times the champions of Europe, Nottingham Forest have not featured in the Premier League in the 21st century, but are now 90 minutes from ending a 23-year absence.\n\nForest's rise after their worst start to a season in over a century owes an awful lot to an unassuming Welshman who might just be about to make fans' dreams a reality after years of nightmares.\n\nHis name is Steve Cooper and he is the man who utterly transformed Nottingham Forest.\n\nA World Cup winner\n\nCooper's route to possible Premier League manager has not been conventional - he won a World Cup as a manager before he had presided over a single club game.\n\nThe son of former Premier League referee Keith Cooper, Steve Cooper the footballer had a nearly, but not quite, career; failing to make the grade at Wrexham before playing for The New Saints, Rhyl, Bangor City and Porthmadog.\n\nThroughout his time in the Welsh Premier League, Cooper was eyeing a future as a coach.\n\nCooper was only 27 years old when he earned his Uefa Pro licence and after progressing to become Wrexham's head of youth, he joined Liverpool's academy and worked with the likes of Raheem Sterling and Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nManchester City's Phil Foden scored twice as England beat Spain to win the 2017 Under-17 World Cup\n\nCooper had become Liverpool's academy manager before he joined the Football Association in 2013, where he was later named under-17s coach in 2015.\n\nIn 2017 Cooper won the under-17s World Cup, with a team including Jadon Sancho and Phil Foden, as England beat Spain 5-2 in the final.\n\nEngland played with such intensity and fluidity it was only a matter of time until a club came calling, as his former colleague at the FA and now Wales women's national team boss Gemma Grainger recalls.\n\n\"Steve and I worked together at the English FA, I was under-17s women coach and he was men's coach and his qualities as a leader always shone,\" she said.\n\n\"He was always very open about sharing his processes and his planning, he's meticulous.\n\n\"He's an incredible leader, the way he helps players, he inspires his staff and he has real strengths.\"\n\nWith a World Cup won and players raving about him, a transition to club football was inevitable.\n\nIt just came down to who would roll the dice on someone with no experience of managing at a senior level.\n\nRhian Brewster scored 11 goals in 21 appearances for Swansea, but has only found the net four times in the past two seasons for Sheffield United\n\nThe road to Nottingham... via Swansea\n\nSwansea City felt like a natural fit for Cooper.\n\nA club with a track record of strong managerial appointments, the Swans - in transition and in the Championship - were happy to take the chance on Cooper after losing Graham Potter to Premier League Brighton.\n\nHowever, despite still receiving Premier League parachute payments, Swansea nonetheless felt a determination to slash their wage bill, with key performers such as Daniel James and Oli McBurnie sold and not replaced.\n\nYet despite being set for a period of transition - Swansea finished 15th last season - despite shedding key stars, Swansea became promotion contenders.\n\nCooper, as he tends to do, found a problem he was able to solve, as he utilised his relationships working in the FA with the best of English football's young talent.\n\nThe Swans reached the play-offs in 2020 thanks to some superb loan signings as the likes of Freddie Woodman, Rhian Brewster, Marc Guehi and Conor Gallagher made key contributions, but Swansea were beaten by Brentford in the semi-finals.\n\nDespite spending just \u00a31m towards the 2020-21 campaign, with Joe Rodon sold to Spurs for 10 times that amount, Cooper once again led Swansea to the play-offs with key performers including Andre Ayew and Connor Roberts taking the club all the way to Wembley.\n\nYet the Swansea fans were restless. They did not enjoy the style of football Cooper was deploying as he placed results over the notion of playing \"the Swansea way\".\n\nAfter a 2-0 play-off final defeat to Brentford, there seemed little desire from coach or club for the relationship to continue.\n\n\"I think he did a fantastic job, Swansea probably missed a bit of a trick there,\" former Wales striker Nathan Blake said.\n\n\"I think after reaching the play-offs twice, promotion in the third season seemed a natural progression. If I was a Swansea board member or fan, I'd be kicking myself.\n\n\"It's difficult to know why he's not more loved by Swansea fans. With the budget he had and the players he had, he was a master at being able to get results.\n\n\"Will Swansea fans be happier next season if they finish outside the top 10 and Forest are in the Premier League?\"\n\nCooper left by mutual consent in July, but from the heights of the play-off final he was soon signing up for a relegation battle... or so it seemed.\n\nHighlights: Ruthless Forest knock holders Leicester out of FA Cup\n\nA relegation battle becomes a promotion push\n\nDespite punching well above his weight with Swansea, Cooper's next job was at the City Ground, where Forest were rock bottom of the Championship, a club on its knees.\n\nThe side he inherited from Chris Hughton had lost six of their first seven games in making their worst start since 1913, with Cooper becoming the 14th manager they had appointed in a decade since Billy Davies' departure in 2011.\n\nNot only has Cooper transformed Forest's fortunes, taking more points than any other side since his appointment in September, but he did so in style. He turned a relegation battle into an incredible campaign where automatic promotion was possible until the final week of the season.\n\n\"No-one would have given Forest a chance of being where they are after they were bottom after seven games of the season, and the players were looking a sad group,\" former Forest midfielder Steve Hodge told BBC Radio Nottingham.\n\n\"The whole season looked to be a write-off before he took over.\"\n\nWith an emphasis on attacking football, Forest powered up the table, while some of Cooper's critics at Swansea might also have been answered with emphatic 4-1 and 5-1 wins over his former side.\n\nIt was on the coaching field that the best work was done. Cooper turned water into wine. Or rather, Djed Spence from a Middlesbrough reserve to a player now eyed by several Premier League clubs, with others such as 19-goal Wales forward Brennan Johnson also given the opportunity to shine.\n\nAn eye-catching FA Cup run also boosted Cooper's profile, with Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp singling Cooper out for praise in his speech at the League Managers' Association awards after his side edged past Forest 1-0 in the quarter-final.\n\n\"The evidence of what a good motivator and coach Steve is has been there for all to see with what he's achieved this season,\" Grainger added.\n\n\"His CV is definitely looking good at the moment.\"\n\nNottingham Forest have appointed 19 different managers since Ron Atkinson left the club following their relegation from the Premier League in 1999\n\nThe final hurdle\n\nThe next step for a coach who has now been to the Championship play-offs in three successive seasons is clear - to manage in the Premier League, with Forest now as close as they have been to a Premier League return.\n\nBeaten at Wembley last season - in a match where Swansea were clearly second best - Cooper now has a chance to complete Forest's incredible revival on Sunday against Huddersfield, having survived a scare to see off Sheffield United in a tense semi-final.\n\n\"The job Steve Cooper has done at Forest is amazing,\" Blake added. \"It is clear for everyone to see how much he's gone in and changed things.\"\n\nCan Cooper now go one better at Wembley after last season's disappointment?\n\n\"He's been to the play-offs before, he's got plenty of experience and he knows exactly how to prepare to get a result in a big, one-off game,\" Grainger said.\n\nIf Cooper can get it done, he will have capped one of the most remarkable seasons in Forest's history, taking them from a recent nadir back to the Premier League.\n\nBut whatever the result at Wembley, after years of despair, Cooper has given Forest fans hope again."}, {"url": "https://www.premierleague.com/managers/65984/Steve-Cooper/overview", "page_content": "Manager Bio\n\nSteve Cooper was appointed head coach of Nottingham Forest on 21 September 2021.\n\nBorn in Pontypridd, Wales, Cooper played as a defender for several Welsh sides including Bangor City, while also studying for his coaching badges.\n\nAfter becoming one of the youngest coaches to obtain his UEFA Pro License, aged 27, Cooper went on to take charge of Wrexham and then Liverpool's academies.\n\nIn 2014, he was appointed manager of the England Under-16s, before going on to the Under-17s a year later.\n\nHe led them to the final of the 2017 UEFA European Championship, where they were beaten by Spain, but in October of that year, they avenged their loss with a 5-2 victory over the Spaniards in the FIFA Under-17 World Cup final.\n\nCooper joined Swansea City in June 2019, guiding them to the playoff final in 2020/21, where they lost out to Brentford at Wembley Stadium in his second and final season at the helm.\n\nIn his first campaign at Forest, Cooper took the club from the bottom of the table and ended their 23-year exile from the Premier League with a 1-0 win over Huddersfield Town in the Championship playoff final."}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/3266381/2022/05/29/nottingham-forest-huddersfield-promotion-premier-league/", "page_content": "(Editor\u2019s Note: A version of this article was published on April 26)\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to raise a glass to somebody who cannot be here today.

So please, can you all raise a glass to\u2026 Steve Cooper.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you want to understand the scale of the impact Cooper has had at Nottingham Forest, the widely shared social media video clip of a recent wedding speech sums things up perfectly.\n\nThe unexpected toast is followed by an enthusiastic rendition of Depeche Mode\u2019s Just Can\u2019t Get Enough. The song \u2014 fittingly released in 1981 during the era when then-manager Brian Clough\u2019s Forest side were at the peak of their powers \u2014 has become ubiquitous with Cooper\u2019s present-day version as he has overseen a remarkable transformation in both fortunes and mood.\n\nAt the time of his appointment in September, Forest had made their worst start to a season for 108 years, claiming only a single point from their first seven Championship games under Chris Hughton.\n\nThe fact they have now secured a place in the Premier League is testimony to the incredible job Cooper has done.\n\nBut it is more than just results that have earned the 42-year-old Welshman a place in the hearts of Forest supporters. It is the fact Cooper just seems to have an intrinsic grasp of this club and what it means to their fans. He gets it.\n\n\u201cIt is a special club to be part of. I tell the players that it is not going to last forever because we are just passing by, really, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Cooper said recently. \u201cYou do have to take it in and recognise that not everywhere is like this. You should never take it for granted, having the opportunity to be involved with a club like this, in any capacity. I just want a team that the supporters can be proud of.\u201d\n\nSo what has been behind his success?\n\nIn the dressing room and on the training ground, the players more regularly refer to him as \u201cCoops\u201d than \u201cBoss\u201d or \u201cGaffer\u201d.\n\nCooper does not favour a hierarchical structure but an atmosphere of unity. His post-match fist-pumps in front of every corner of the City Ground have become a trademark. But, normally, those moments only arrive after he has taken the time to talk to and congratulate every single one of his players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose fist-pump celebrations were not pre-planned but something that happened off the cuff and, while he appreciates the bond it has helped him to forge with supporters, Cooper has never wanted the spotlight to be cast solely on him. He can feel slightly embarrassed when it is. He prefers to see Forest\u2019s achievements as a team effort.\n\nHis family, including his father, brother and son, regularly attend games. Cooper admits he has been known to feel emotional during the traditional pre-match rendition of Mull Of Kintyre, which seems to have grown louder and more fervent with each passing week.\n\nFormer Wrexham and Liverpool academy coach Cooper still has his family home in north Wales, where there are a small but growing number of Forest fans who now make the journey across to the English east Midlands, having been inspired by the job their fellow countryman is doing.\n\nThere is nothing complex to Cooper\u2019s approach. He is meticulous but still somehow manages to keep things simple. There are several meetings with players every single day, as a group and individually.\n\nHe is a friendly, approachable character but also possesses a sharp wit and the ability to deliver a cutting put-down if a player does mess up in training.\n\n\u201cHe is intense but good. He has a great nature. He is good around the lads but you don\u2019t want to mess up one of his drills; you do not want to give balls away cheaply,\u201d defender Steve Cook tells The Athletic. \u201cHe is very sharp when he wants to be\u2026 he can give you one or two lines that will bring you down to earth.\n\n\u201cIf it is not you on the receiving end of it, it can be quite enjoyable \u2014 because I like hearing what he has to say. But if it is you on the end of it, it is much less enjoyable.\n\nFrom left: Scott McKenna, Steve Cook and Jack Colback have all benefited from Steve Cooper\u2019s guidance (Photo: Justin Tallis/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe work he does with his coaching staff all has a purpose. You can see the thought process behind everything. We do not do drills for the sake of it; they all have a purpose. That is a good way of keeping players on it \u2014 particularly those who can kind of drift, attention-wise. There are a few of those!\n\n\u201cThey are always short, sharp sessions, with a lot of detail. It is about keeping fitness levels up but also about getting the tactical ideas across. Because that can change, game to game.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Hughton had doubts over whether young Brennan Johnson was ready for Championship football, Cooper has honed the talent of the Wales international, who is now valued at as much as \u00a325 million, such has been his progress. The 20-year-old has contributed 19 goals and 10 assists.\n\nSimilarly, Hughton regarded Jordi Osei-Tutu as Forest\u2019s first-choice right-back at the start of the season and, while injury hampered his progress \u2014 to the point where his loan spell was terminated early and he returned to Arsenal \u2014 fellow loanee Djed Spence has subsequently evolved into a player that the likes of Tottenham, and Arsenal themselves, are watching keenly.\n\nThe only regret is that it will be parent club Middlesbrough who benefit financially from Spence\u2019s rapid development into one of the best young defenders outside of the top flight. He was an outcast in the north east last summer but is now valued at \u00a310 million.\n\nRyan Yates has long been regarded as a bright prospect by those who have worked closely with him, who see his qualities, but the midfielder had struggled to win Forest fans around to the same idea. His work-rate and constant desire for personal improvement are indicative of the attitude Cooper demands. Yates\u2019 personal improvement is a sign that they are more than just words.\n\n\u201cYou rest at the end, not in the middle,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cI have said that to the players. They just have to be hungry to improve and hungry to get the best out of every single day.\n\n\u201cIt is an elite environment. It needs to be challenging. Sometimes people need to be pushed \u2014 including myself. To achieve that, things are not always going to be fluffy. What we try to do is get to a place where, if you are having difficult conversations, we have built good connections and relations with people so that they know it is coming from the right place.\n\n\u201cThick or thin, everyone sticks together. That is so important.\u201d\n\nForest have been granted planning permission to revamp parts of their training ground at the Nigel Doughty Academy. But, while he approves of the club\u2019s ambition, Cooper is also a fan of the intimate, compact nature of the current facilities and does not want that to be lost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd his eye for detail extends to requesting that investment be made in new equipment to allow the ground staff to maintain the training pitches to the same degree that the City Ground\u2019s pitch is carefully manicured.\n\nSignificant money could be invested to level off the slight slope on some of the playing surfaces at the training ground, where Cooper has already overseen significant changes to the previously cramped meeting rooms to create a more welcoming environment.\n\n\u201cHe might as well have a rotating door in his office, because there are players in and out of there so often,\u201d Cook says. \u201cHe is very approachable. He is a good laugh. You don\u2019t want your work environment to be an entirely serious place. (But) there is a line you need to remain on the right side of. Their expectations are very high. It all stems from that.\u201d\n\nAfter Cooper was appointed, Joe Lolley revealed the new manager had held individual meetings with every single player to garner their thoughts on where things stood at Forest. It is a habit Cooper has maintained in the eight months since. Every player has been offered help or guidance of some sort.\n\nWhen regular captain Lewis Grabban was injured and out for most of the season\u2019s final three months, Cooper worked extensively with stand-in Joe Worrall on the challenges and demands of wearing the armband for a club of Forest\u2019s stature \u2014 and encouraged him to think about what kind of skipper he wants to be.\n\nWorrall has had to work on aspects of the role \u2014 including being more of a leader when other players are late for meetings or for training and need reminding of their responsibilities. Worrall\u2019s performances on the pitch have gone up another level this season, as have those of fellow defender Scott McKenna.\n\nBut while the academy product has never been short of confidence, the Scotsman, in contrast, has been encouraged not to be so self-critical.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcKenna would focus on every mistake or poor pass despite the fact that he \u2014 like Worrall \u2014 is hugely respected for his strong, no-nonsense displays and ability to carry the ball out from the back. Along with the experienced Cook and the resurgent Tobias Figueiredo, Forest have built one of English football\u2019s strongest defensive units outside of the Premier League.\n\nWhen Yates was left out of the starting XI, Cooper spoke to him to explain his thinking. The midfielder, respectfully but firmly, informed his manager that he was making a mistake. Cooper, far from being annoyed, loves the attitude of the 24-year-old, who is always the first into meetings and the last to leave the training pitch.\n\nRyan Yates has been in brilliant form under Cooper (Photo: Jon Hobley/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nWhen Max Lowe was sidelined with injury for the rest of the season in early March, Cooper took midfielder Jack Colback to one side to explain that he would be putting his faith in him to fill the void at left wing-back. His impressive performances culminated in him scoring a contender for goal of the season against West Bromwich Albion.\n\n\u201cThere is so much more improvement we can make still but we have come so, so far since the manager came in, and that is credit to him,\u201d Yates says. \u201cI look back at my clips from his first games in charge and from more recent games and some of the movements he wanted from me, I now do without even thinking.\u201d\n\nEven when they had time off during the March international break, the players could not escape Cooper\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cThe gaffer was dropping messages into the group chat, reminding us to keep focused for when we come back,\u201d says on-loan Aston Villa forward Keinan Davis. \u201cHe just makes sure that we keep our eye on the ball. It is always about the next match.\u201d\n\nIt says much that Davis and Lowe, who is on loan from Sheffield United, that both wanted to stay at Forest to complete their rehab from injuries rather than returning to their parent clubs.\n\n\u201cIt is great that they want to stay here,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cThey are part of it. They are popular lads and they have made friends here. We just need to shut Keinan up a little bit!\u201d\n\nThe appetite for Premier League football was only whetted by Forest\u2019s FA Cup run, which saw them beat recent winners Arsenal and Leicester City, as well as eventual play-off final opponents Huddersfield Town, before eventually being narrowly beaten by quadruple-chasing Liverpool in the last eight.\n\nForest may not have made it to the Wembley semi-finals because of that 1-0 loss to a club who would win both domestic cups, finish as runners-up in the Premier League by one point and lose Saturday\u2019s Champions League final to the only goal, but Cooper did go along to observe as he looks to continue his own football education.\n\n\u201cIt was an amazing spectacle,\u201d he says. \u201cI am a football nut. I am always up for seeing what might be new, what is happening in the game \u2014 in foreign football as well. You are always looking for something; always looking for ideas.\u201d\n\nWhat was telling in those FA Cup ties was how Forest took the game to their opposition. It is a mindset that has seen them now clinch promotion under Cooper, restoring the club to the top flight for the first time since the 1990s.\n\n\u201cWe do not fear anyone,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cThere is no player I have come up against that has made me think, \u2018I need to be on the back foot\u2019. The gaffer wants us to be positive, on the front foot all over the pitch. We are all confident and believe we can run over teams. That is why we score a lot of goals. We keep going in games, we never change our approach.\n\n\u201cIt was not great at the start here. But once the gaffer came in, things changed so quickly. I cannot speak highly enough about the club.\u201d\n\nIt says much that even an arch-rival can appreciate the job Cooper has done.\n\nDerby defender Curtis Davies played in both the 1-1 draw at Pride Park, which earned Hughton his only point of the season in August, and as Forest won 2-1 in January\u2019s reverse fixture under Cooper.\n\nEven Derby\u2019s Davies can appreciate the impact Cooper has made at arch-rivals Forest (Photo: Mick Walker \u2013 CameraSport via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cRegardless of my feelings about the club, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s done a fantastic job,\u201d Davies tells The Athletic. \u201cUnfortunately, him coming into the club was at the expense of my former manager (Davies worked with Hughton at Birmingham City), someone I have huge respect for \u2014 but at the start of the season, the club had lost a bit of its spark.\n\n\u201cWhen we played them earlier in the season, I think it was a game where Chrissy was on the verge of losing his job and in the second half they basically threw the game at us. They ended up getting the equaliser.\n\n\u201cThe second game, I don\u2019t think there was much in it. But they won the game and played some great football. Keinan Davis has been a great signing, Brennan Johnson has been used really well, leaving him up the pitch to frustrate teams. Not only has he got pace, he\u2019s got skill to break down teams on the counter.\n\n\u201c(Cooper) feels like a perfect fit for the club. Not just the way he wants to play football but his personality. Forest was a squad that was full of players who all thought they should be playing at Championship level, every week. That\u2019s one to 20 who all felt like they should be playing. He\u2019s found a way of keeping people onside. He keeps them ready and keeps them motivated. A hands-on coach but one who people want to work for.\u201d\n\nCloser to home, another experienced defender in Cook \u2014 who signed in January from a Bournemouth side bound for automatic promotion to the Premier League \u2014 has been equally impressed.\n\n\u201cI can appreciate the job he has done. You hear stories of how training used to be before he came in; about how we used to play and how things have changed \u2014 in just such a short amount of time,\u201d Cook says.\n\n\u201cNeil Warnock used to say that 90 per cent of being a manager is about man-management. I don\u2019t know whether that is true but that management side of the game \u2014 dealing with young players, knowing how you can speak to players now and treat them has changed so much.\n\n\u201cThe way that the manager does it here is a perfect example of how to do it. You have to speak to players in a certain way now, when they are on the pitch; you have to put your views across \u2014 there is an understanding of the game on the pitch that is needed, because the game is so tactical now.\n\n\u201cIt is a chess game. You (as a player) have to understand what you are being asked to do. For me, learning that from him has improved me.\u201d\n\nDo not expect things to change too much in the Premier League.\n\n\u201cIt is important to stick to what you do more than ever. Why change? That is my feeling. Stick to the plan. Make sacrifices every day. Plan, prepare and review as you have done all season,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cIf it has been a good enough way of working, it will get you to where you want to be.\n\n\u201cIf it does not, then somebody else has a go, don\u2019t they? That is the way it works. That is it really: stick to the plan. Believe in it.\u201d\n\nForest have had 21 permanent managers since they were last in the top flight in 1999.\n\nWith Cooper being mentioned in wedding speeches due to his success, is it any wonder this has proven to be the union that has finally taken them back to the Premier League?\n\nOther contributors: Phil Buckingham and Daniel Taylor\n\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Sam Richardson using Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/sep/21/nottingham-forest-appoint-steve-cooper-as-new-head-coach", "page_content": "The former Swansea City manager Steve Cooper has been appointed as the new head coach of Nottingham Forest on a contract to June 2024.

Following a 1-0 win against Huddersfield in the Championship play-off final, Nottingham Forest are finally there.\n\nSince their relegation, Nottingham Forest have constantly chopped and changed managers. They have had 20 managers in 22 seasons. Steve Cooper was their 21st managerial appointment and he was finally able to stop the rot at Nottingham Forest.\n\nHe replaced Chris Houghton at the helm of the Tricky Trees. Houghton only managed to secure a solitary win in eight games at the start of this season and was sacked. Steve Cooper came in and transformed the ethos of the club. After his appointment in the September of 2021 Nottingham Forest became a winning machine!

Whether it was his England youth teams or his Swansea side, Cooper makes sure his team looks to control possession. The tactics Cooper has deployed at Nottingham Forest function around the same principles.\n\nCooper usually sets up his Nottingham Forest team in a 3-4-1-2. Which looks like a 5-3-2 without the ball and often like 3-4-3 with the ball. His players are very comfortable with on field positional interchanges. Especially in the final 3rd.\n\nOne centre midfielder is deployed as a box-to-box midfielder while the other central midfielder hangs back to protect the backline and acts as a deep-lying playmaker. The number 10 is allowed to roam into free space, especially to help cause overloads on the flanks with an attacker and charging wing-backs on either flank. More often than not James Garner was the deep-lying playmaker and Ryan Yates was deployed as the box-to-box midfielder. New signing Orel Mangala might be an upgrade on Yates, while there is an upgrade in the No10 position too.\n\nAhead of them, Philip Zinckernagel played as the number 10. Jesse Lingard has come in to play this role now. Forest are not going to control games as easily in the Premier League so Lingard\u2019s running might prove to be crucial.\n\nOn the flanks, the wing-backs are charged with bombing up and down the pitch to contribute defensively and in the final 3rd. So much so that 78% of Forest\u2019s attacks come from the flanks. The wing-backs have also contributed with 16 goal involvements this season. Which is an impressive number for players in such a strenuous league as the Championship. Djed Spence and Jack Colback fit into these roles seamlessly last season.\n\nWhat was remarkable about Cooper\u2019s Forest is that they were the best counter-attacking side in the league. They move the ball extremely incisively. Without the ball, they look to cramp the centre of the park to leave space for the wing-backs to cause havoc on the flanks. The rampaging Spence and Colback were essential cogs to Nottingham Forest\u2019s counterattacks. Without Djed Spence, that could take a hit. Forest would hope new signing Neco Williams hits the ground running.\n\nNottingham Forest under Cooper have shown the tactical versatility to combine their possession game and counter-attacking ability to become one of the most complete teams in the league.\n\nSome of the above-mentioned players have gone on to become stars and had a breakthrough campaign in the Championship. Luckily for Nottingham Forest, Steve Cooper has an excellent track record of working with young players and developing them. They have 13 squad members under the age of 25 meaning Cooper can build a prodigious squad at Nottingham Forest.\n\nJust look at Sancho, Foden and Smith-Rowe who were part of Cooper\u2019s under-17 World Cup winning England squad.\n\nThe supporting cast\n\n\n\nSteve Cooper has managed to get superb performances out of some middling players. He has also given the perfect platform for youngsters. Cooper has even managed to get the best out of some veterans. Basically, he has got the squad working together beautifully.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Relaxed atmosphere, players often refer to him as \u2018Coops\u2019 not \u2018boss\u2019\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Several player meetings each day\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Eye for detail\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Helping developing Worrall as leader when Grabban injured How Cooper inspired Forest to play-off place \ud83d\udcdd @nottmtails @PJBuckingham @DTathletic \u2014 The Athletic UK (@TheAthleticUK) April 27, 2022\n\nMiddling players such as Steve Worral, Scott McKenna, Brice Samba and Philip Zinckernagell have fit into Cooper\u2019s system flawlessly. Worral, who was seen as a promising centre-back about 4 years ago, became one of the most consistent ball-playing centre-backs in the Championship.\n\n156 interceptions, 14 fouls, 2,720 minutes played and 1 vintage car.

Coming up in Scotland McKenna was seen as a promising centre-back. His form at Forest took a step up after Cooper\u2019s appointment. Since then, he has become one of the most physically dominant defenders in the league. This centre-back duo has managed to keep 17 clean sheets together and has got their career back on the right track.\n\nMcKenna has been called up #nffc pic.twitter.com/QpoCynds17 \u2014 Talk Forest TV (@talkforesttv) May 23, 2022\n\nPhilip Zinckernagel exploded last season. After his disappointing stint at Watford, the Hornets loanee has 6 goals and 7 assists last season. His performances earned him a move to Greek champions Olympiacos. The trio of Niakhate, Mangala and Lingard will hope to replace his attacking output.\n\nOnly Brennan Johnson and Lewis Grabban have more direct goal involvements for Nottingham Forest this season than Philip Zinckernagel (16). #NFFC pic.twitter.com/eMjo2MbEd3 \u2014 Callum Castel (@callumcasteln) April 19, 2022\n\nBrice Samba was the best keeper in the league last season. He had an 80% save rate in the Championship this season, the highest in the league. However, he moved back to France with Lens, leaving Forest to look for a replacement. Forest again played a masterstroke here. Manchester United\u2019s GK Dean Henderson was available on loan and the club snapped him up, arguably an upgrade on Samba.\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f \"Brice Samba saves it, and Forest are going to Wembley\" \u2764\ufe0f \ud83c\udf33\ud83d\udd34 #NFFC pic.twitter.com/j28z0w9A8h \u2014 Nottingham Forest FC (@NFFC) May 18, 2022\n\nCooper has also managed to get the best out of veterans like Lewis Grabban, Steve Cook and Jack Colback. These 3 veterans have provided the much-needed experience that was needed for a club like Nottingham Forest to push for a Premier League spot.\n\nLewis Grabban ruled out for 6-7 weeks with a hamstring injury At 34 and out of contract this summer, you suspect he\u2019s now played his final game for #NFFC Grabbs became the first Forest player since 2003 to net 20 goals in a season and has scored 50+ in red!

Grabban scored 12 and assisted 4 in 32 appearances in the league last season. Expecting such output in the PL was not realistic. Therefore, Forest went out and bought Taiwo Awoniyi for a club record fee. Scorer of 15 goals in the Bundesliga last season, Forest\u2019s survival hopes are tied to him making good on his promise.\n\nNottingham Forest's Jack Colback with the best goal you'll see today \ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\udc4f pic.twitter.com/bhmphjuUPZ \u2014 ESPN FC (@ESPNFC) April 18, 2022\n\nThe leading men\n\nNow come the stars of this team, James Garner, Ryan Yates, Brennan Johnson and Djed Spence. Yates is the oldest out of this lot. At 24, he contributed 8 goals last season. The 21-year olds-Garner, Johnson and Spence were exceptional season for Nottingham Forest under Steve Cooper.\n\nGarner, who was on loan from Manchester United, looked exceptional on the ball as his defensive game took a much-needed step up. In fact, he looks primed to make space for himself at the Red Devils under Ten Hag. His passing ability has made him a fan favourite this pre-season with United and he will look to make the deep-lying playmaker role his own. If the Frenkie de Jong saga ends up with de Jong not joining United, then Garner might make his way into ten Hag\u2019s first XI.\n\n\ud83e\udd47 James Garner has been named in the SofaScore team of the season; the only Nottingham Forest player to do so. \ud83d\ude80 \ud835\udddb\ud835\uddf2'\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddf7\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01 \ud835\udfee\ud835\udfed \ud835\ude06\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf1.#MUFC pic.twitter.com/i3b8BS5Ogk \u2014 Man United News (@ManUtdMEN) May 9, 2022\n\nBrennan Johnson was an outstanding attacking talent at Nottingham last season. His pace caused problems for every backline in the league. The hybrid attacking midfielder/ winger was mainly been deployed as a striker alongside a more physically dominant partner in either Davies, Grabban or Surridge.\n\n\ud83d\udcab Brennan Johnson has been directly involved in 29 goals in all competitions this season (19 goals, 10 assists) \u2013 12 more than any other @NFFC player. Will he be the match-winner this weekend? \ud83d\udc40#EFLPlayOffs | #StepUp pic.twitter.com/sJAt7sEn9c \u2014 Sky Bet Championship (@SkyBetChamp) May 26, 2022\n\nHis positional switch resulted in outstanding results. In 47 appearances he scored 17 goals and laid out 10 assists, the highest in the Nottingham Forest squad for both metrics. A stroke of genius by Cooper. Now, with a new contract, Johnson is one of the pillars of this side.\n\nLast but not least is Djed Spence. Spence was on loan from Boro but his performances had ensured that there was going to be no second season for him at Forest. The wing-back became a bona fide superstar last season. His relentless running, ball-carrying ability and sheer pace made him one of the most effective wing-backs in the EFL. So much so that he is Tottenham moved for him. In 40 appearances he kept 15 clean sheets and even chipped in with 2 goals. Along with Destiny Udogie, Conte might have settled Spurs\u2019 wing-back spots for the next decade.\n\nMost important result today: Djed Spence will be playing for Nottingham Forest in the playoffs. Boro didn\u2019t consider him good enough and Boro didn\u2019t make it.#NFFC pic.twitter.com/lEAEv7QK1I \u2014 FFSForest (@Forest_No_22) May 7, 2022\n\nOne can argue that the challenge for Steve Cooper starts now. He will get his chance to manage in the Premier League. However, just bringing promotion to Forest is a miracle, considering the position they were in when he was appointed.

Can it really be true that Steve Cooper\u2019s renaissance work involves a team that spent 35 days at the bottom of the league?\n\nTo say Cooper has done an exceptional job might not even do justice to his restorative powers since replacing Chris Hughton in September and inheriting a team that had never gone above 15th position during 11 months with the previous manager.\n\nColleagues talk about how hard Cooper works behind the scenes and the extraordinary level of detail that has gone into masterminding the recovery.\n\nThey talk about a man who demands high standards of everyone around him and has had the strength of personality to grab the entire club by its shirt lapels, give it a much-needed shake and let everyone know in friendly terms he would like it to be different from now on.\n\nWhen the 42-year-old took over, it quickly became apparent to him that the level of belief in the dressing room was not so much rock-bottom but subterranean. He knew he had to pick the right language in every team talk, interview and conversation to change the mindset. He wanted his players to be comfortable on the ball, to play with courage, attack in numbers and, above all, to understand the new manager thought they were capable of great things. Positivity was the key.\n\nCooper had noticed his players did not tend to celebrate every goal together. One of his first wishes was that, under him, that should change. Everyone celebrates together now.\n\nThose players talk about a man who understands the importance of communicating with them, one on one, and fostering a sense of togetherness. They talk about many late goals they have scored and what it reveals about their new attitude. Or the frequency with which Forest\u2019s substitutes have made telling contributions rather than feeling sorry for themselves about being left out of the starting line-up.\n\nCooper has quickly built up a rapport with the Forest faithful (Photo: Isaac Parkin/PA Images via Getty Images)\n\nStill early days, yes, but could anyone possibly dispute that the hiring of Cooper ranks as the best managerial appointment of the season?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of which makes this a key period for a club that started the season with a new chief executive, a new recruitment team and a shift in personnel to remove some of the high-ranking executives whose mistakes proved costly on the last occasion Forest entered the January transfer window in a position of strength.\n\nOn that occasion two years ago the club brought in three new players who all, without wishing to sound cruel, somehow managed to make the team worse.\n\nNuno da Silva, the most expensive at \u00a32 million, went on to have the dubious record \u2014 courtesy of an own goal on the final day of the season \u2014 of being the only striker in the club\u2019s history to finish his Forest career with a goals tally of minus one.\n\nGaetan Bong lasted 59 minutes of his debut before the manager, Sabri Lamouchi, decided the new signing was a danger to his own team and never selected him again. Bong plays these days only in an emergency, but he will have collected roughly \u00a31.5 million in wages by the time his contract expires next summer.\n\nAs for the third signing, Adama Diakhaby\u2019s rather unfortunate time in a Forest shirt could probably be summed up by a comment from the directors\u2019 box midway through one particularly erratic performance.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a speedboat, not a footballer,\u201d came the verdict.\n\nDiakhaby was fast. He just found it difficult making his feet, legs and brain work in coordination. And Forest, who had been in the play-off positions since Boxing Day, dropped out of the top six with virtually the final kick of the season. Privately, they will admit it was a \u201cshocking window\u201d.\n\nThese days, however, there is reason to be confident that Forest will not undermine this manager that way.\n\nDane Murphy has taken over from Ioannis Vrentzos as chief executive (even if his predecessor still has some level of say-so from his base in Greece) and deserves recognition for realising that Cooper, not Hughton, was the right fit for a modern-thinking club.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrancois Modesto is still listed as technical director on the club\u2019s website but he, like Vrentzos, is now more involved with Olympiakos as part of the Evangelos Marinakis empire.\n\nMurphy has assembled a recruitment team that is trying to put together an almost implausible promotion season while also reducing the average age of the squad and \u2014 here\u2019s the thing \u2014 no longer having the kind of big money that was available earlier in the Marinakis era.\n\nThat process has begun. It needs creativity and intelligence and it is noticeable that Forest are targeting quick, penetrative players to change the dynamic of what was, under Hughton, a team that scored fewer goals than every other club in the Football League last season bar Derby County and Southend United.\n\nA case in point is Forest\u2019s interest in Folarin Balogun, a 20-year-old Arsenal striker who has the pace to get behind opposition defences.\n\nForest would like Balogun on loan from Arsenal for the second half of the season (Photo: James Chance/Getty Images)\n\nPaul Mukairu, a 21-year-old Nigerian winger, was on the radar last summer and is still available from the Turkish club Antalyaspor. Various other targets have been identified.\n\nBut it is not straightforward.\n\nForest do not want to return to their days of spending wildly or the kind of transfer-window splurges that saw them accumulate 15 new players in the summer before last. They do not want a bloated squad full of disaffected players earning large wages for little input. It is imperative that Forest are no longer guilty of what the chairman, Nicholas Randall, admitted this year was \u201cshort-termism\u201d.\n\nThere is also the fact that Forest are bracing themselves for another concerted effort from Brentford to try to negotiate a suitable fee for Brennan Johnson.\n\nBrentford\u2019s latest bid was \u00a310 million with add-ons and a 10 per cent sell-on clause. It was turned down, in keeping with several offers from Brentford last summer, but Forest have been slow to fix up a new contract with Johnson and that makes them increasingly vulnerable now he is within 18 months of his present deal expiring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, Forest are fortunate that Johnson, a product of Gary Brazil\u2019s seemingly endless conveyor belt of academy talent, has an affinity to the club, is enjoying playing for Cooper and recognises that starting every week, at the age of 20, is good for his career development. Not that Forest should be complacent when Brentford can offer Premier League football and a significant pay rise.\n\nLeeds United, West Ham United and Newcastle United have also shown an interest and Forest need to resist these advances if they have any real ambitions of promotion. To sell Joe Worrall at this point of the season would seem counterproductive given his importance to the team. Forest, to put it bluntly, cannot let it happen. Not yet, anyway.\n\nThe priority ought to be about who comes in and the natural inclination among supporters, of course, is that Forest should be ambitious enough to push out the boat and see where it leads.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, the club has to take a slightly more pragmatic view, not least because they are having to work within the financial constraints that have arisen, for the most part, because so much money has been lost on poor transfer business in other parts of the Marinakis era.\n\nForest have been burned so badly in the past they now have to be smarter than the rest.\n\nIt is why Marinakis decided there had to be changes at the top of the club, including the appointment of data and analytics expert George Syrianos, previously with Stuttgart, as a head of recruitment. And maybe the club\u2019s supporters will have to understand that it would seem pretty contradictory to complain about Forest\u2019s scattergun approach under Vrentzos and Modesto but to expect, or even demand, a multitude of big-money signings in January.\n\nMurphy summed it up on a recent Forever Forest podcast: \u201cOver-spending, or over-extending, in January never works.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForest are understood to be operating with an \u00a318,000-a-week pay ceiling for new signings and it is said that one of the reasons why the club missed out on Keinan Davis last summer was because the Aston Villa striker wanted \u00a320,000 (Forest, it could be joked, would have settled this dispute previously by offering \u00a325,000).\n\nOther changes might be on the way. Lewis Grabban is out of contract at the end of the season and Tobias Figueiredo is free from January 1 to negotiate with overseas clubs. Grabban\u2019s goals would be hard to replace. At the same time, he is approaching his 34th birthday and earning in the region of \u00a330,000 a week. It will always divide opinion, but does he fit into the club\u2019s vision for the future?\n\nThe idea is to plan medium to long term as well as short term. Although the priority is to sign younger players, Forest would also like an experienced centre-half with leadership qualities to match those of Worrall and Scott McKenna.\n\nGrabban will be 34 in January \u2013 will he get another deal when his present one runs out at the end of the season? (Photo: Ashley Allen/Getty Images)\n\nThere is an understanding, from Cooper down, that they cannot continue to be so reliant on loan signings. One hope for the new year is that Braian Ojeda will emerge as a shrewd signing, even though the Paraguayan has taken a bit of time to adjust to his new surroundings.\n\nIs there any chance Forest might go back for Lee Buchanan at Derby County?\n\nNothing is happening at the moment. Forest received no encouragement when they tried last summer with three separate bids, the third being \u00a31.35 million with performance-related extras. But do not just assume that is a Derby-Forest issue. Other clubs have also contacted Derby\u2019s administrators and been told the player is not for sale. Whether that is genuinely the case remains to be seen, however, at a time when Derby are close to being financially shipwrecked.\n\nAs for Djed Spence, he has made it clear to Middlesbrough he wants to remain in Nottingham rather than returning to the club that placed a January recall clause in his season-long deal. Spence, one of Forest\u2019s outstanding performers under Cooper, is a strong-minded individual and there is the potential for it to get complicated if Middlesbrough demand his return. One possibility is that Forest may have to pay a fee to remove the clause.\n\nThere is also encouraging news about Max Lowe, who is ahead of schedule in his rehabilitation from a groin injury that was originally expected to keep him out until the end of January.\n\nForest, in short, are in a good place.\n\nJohnson wants to stay, Spence wants to stay, the team are winning football matches and the play-offs have suddenly loomed into view \u2014 it all starts with the change of manager, an outbreak of common sense in the boardroom and Cooper\u2019s impressive ability to re-energise a drifting, sometimes baffling club.\n\nWould it be premature to float the idea that Forest, now a point outside the top six, might even want to consider extending Cooper\u2019s contract (which runs until 2024) at the end of the season?\n\nYes, it is early. Too early, perhaps. Football can change quickly. And yes, it is only a few months since Randall claimed that Forest were \u201cthe envy of a number of Premier League clubs\u201d to have Hughton as manager. The most optimistic line heard in Nottingham, perhaps, since Fawaz Al-Hasawi, the previous owner, talked about adding a third star to the club\u2019s badge.\n\nSometimes, though, it all fits like a favourite pair of slippers. Cooper has shown that he is the man. The fans have taken him into their affections. One, two, three, sometimes even four, fist-pumps. And, for the first time in a long time, the City Ground feels like a happy place.\n\n(Top photos: Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/3668593/2022/10/08/steve-cooper-new-contract-at-forest/", "page_content": "On Monday night at Leicester, Steve Cooper wore the look of a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders during his post-match press conference.\n\nFour days later, as he sat in front of the media again, he cut a very different figure. Smiling, confident, relaxed \u2014 and able to focus on the future with at least a small degree of certainty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNottingham Forest have long been a club with an ability to surprise \u2014 since well before Evangelos Marinakis\u2019s tenure began. But, even by those standards, the scale of change over the last few days has been remarkable.\n\nOn Thursday, Steve Cooper and his Nottingham Forest coaching staff held a routine meeting with the players at the training ground to assess where things had gone wrong against Leicester City.\n\nCooper, in typically honest fashion, refused to blame the players for the result. Instead he is understood to have conceded that Forest\u2019s team selection and tactics were the reason for the 4-0 defeat, which looked like a farewell of sorts when the Welshman went over to acknowledge the travelling fans.\n\nSteve Cooper applauds fans after the 4-0 loss to Leicester (Photo: Joh Hobley/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nA discussion followed about how they could improve when Aston Villa visit the City Ground on Monday. The tone of the conversation is understood to have suggested the fixture could hold particular significance, if a sixth consecutive defeat was to follow.\n\nBut any sense among the players that their manager might be on dodgy ground will have been appeased a day later when the club announced that Cooper had put pen to paper on a new contract, which will run until 2025.\n\nIt was welcome news in the dressing room, where Cooper remains a popular figure among the squad, some of whom were part of the team he guided to promotion from the Championship last season, and some of whom were only persuaded to sign for Forest by the head coach in the last few months.\n\nIt is also a wise move from the club, as they look to quell the mood of uncertainty that had grown in recent weeks. Although there is also a case to be made that they had been a catalyst for much of that themselves.\n\nOn Tuesday, there was a sense around the club that Cooper\u2019s days were numbered: that defeat to previously bottom-of-the-table Leicester would be the final straw. Not least because alternative options had not only been discussed but, in some cases, had been contacted, via intermediaries, to assess their interest in joining Forest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is an age where fan power has an influence and the largely negative response to Forest\u2019s shortlist of targets \u2014 which was understood to have included Rafa Benitez, Sean Dyche, Nuno Espirito Santo and Bruno Lage \u2014 was noted by the Forest hierarchy. As was the fact that Cooper remains hugely popular among fans, demonstrated by supporters chanting his name noisily and extensively, even when defeat was certain in Leicester.\n\nForest\u2019s modus operandi, once they decide to make a change, has always been to work to get the new man in place before the trigger is pulled. In this case, the club found themselves in a position where viable alternatives were beginning to look as though they would not be a massive upgrade. The fact that Cooper has been on the radar of Southampton and Wolves was another factor, as Forest pondered whether it would be too hasty to get rid of a man who was being looked at by two of their Premier League rivals.\n\nThere was a meeting of the Forest hierarchy on Wednesday when it was decided that Cooper would be given more time. But even following that, there was a feeling that \u2018more time\u2019 could only be one more game.\n\nEven after signing a new deal, Cooper will still be judged on results; a failure to inspire a turnaround in fortunes will still ultimately have consequences for the former Swansea manager. But now, the man who inspired a sense of unity, togetherness and team spirit among the squad he inherited just over a year ago, will have the opportunity to do so again, amid a group of players that has been vastly transformed by the addition of 22 new signings during an ambitious \u00a3150million recruitment drive.\n\nCooper is understood to have met owner Evangelos Marinakis for talks last weekend, with the Greek shipping magnate keen to understand what his head coach felt the problems were. And further conversations were held yesterday between Cooper and the club hierarchy, although he described them as being \u201cnormal\u201d discussions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened this week,\u201d said Cooper, when asked if he had held talks over his future in the last few days. \u201cWe spoke after the game, as usual. I have to say the conversations I have with the ownership and with Dane (Murphy)\u2026 they have always been a discussion, rather than one person talking.\n\n\u201cThis is just normal. We were all really disappointed after Monday. Me first of all. But so were they. We talk about what went wrong in the game, what went right. I am always the first one to say, \u2018We should have done that better\u2019. But don\u2019t think that it has been along the lines of, \u2018Let\u2019s start the process now of negotiating a contract\u2019 on Tuesday morning. It has been something that has happened over a long while.\n\n\u201cI have had conversations with the hierarchy in the last few days. But they were just normal conversations.\u201d\n\nAnother significant change has seen Filippo Giraldi, who previously oversaw recruitment at Watford, appointed as sporting director. The list of players signed during his tenure there is impressive and includes Abdoulaye Doucoure, Etienne Capoue, Joao Pedro and Richarlison. He also played a part in building a structure to support the first team at Watford. Forest have handed him similar responsibilities. Giraldi met Cooper and the other senior figures at the Nigel Doughty Academy on Thursday.\n\nForest\u2019s new sporting director Filippo Giraldi, pictured in 2020 (Photo: Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cFilippo has come in and we have talked about that,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed my relationship so far with people above. I hope, and I\u2019m sure, that will continue now with people coming in. I\u2019m looking forward to working with him. I only met him for the first time in the last few days. Hopefully we\u2019ve started as we mean to go on. It\u2019s very modern now to have a technical director, sporting director, and working collaboratively. I\u2019m all for that.\n\n\u201cIf the club thinks the appointment will help us improve and take us forward, then they\u2019ve completely got my support. I\u2019m looking forward to being involved in that.\u201d\n\nCooper admits he is happy about one more thing: the fact that the weekly questions he faced about when he was going to sign his new deal can now be put to bed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe contract is great, because it brings an end to the questioning. But it does not change me. I could not work any harder. I could not love this club any more or want to fight any more, particularly in the moment we are in now,\u201d he says. \u201cWhether I had a very short-term contract or a very long-term one, it would not change that.\n\n\u201cI have not been thinking about it as much as others might have been. I have always said that when I was asked questions about it, and it was not just me swerving those questions. Talks have been ongoing, things have been progressing, and if we feel now is a good time to renew that is fine by me. But the main thing is that we just go and win on Monday.\n\n\u201cWith any sort of contract, it is always good to have clarity on which way a club is thinking about going. If at the moment it is a commitment to me, then of course that is mutual.\n\n\u201cIf there were any questions in some players minds \u2014 and they might have been thinking change was a good thing! \u2014 that is normal. I don\u2019t know how close that might have been. That is a club\u2019s prerogative with any manager, not just me.\n\n\u201cI alway said to myself, coming into first-team football, even before Swansea, that you know what you\u2019re coming into. I tried to promised myself then, and I\u2019ve stuck to that promise, that through the real highs and real lows, and you do go through those as a manager, I wanted to stick to what I believe in and stick to who I am.\n\n\u201cThrough good and bad times, you want to stick to what you believe in.\u201d\n\nWhen he led Forest to promotion at Wembley back in May, Cooper was an emotional figure afterwards, struggling to hold back his tears. He was not holding his emotions back to the same level at the Nigel Doughty Academy, but it was clear that the relationship he has forged with the club and its supporters is hugely important to him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery time somebody may have said something positively to me in the past, my natural feeling has just been to want to do well even more. If I bump into someone and they say they like the team or that the job I\u2019m doing is OK, I don\u2019t get in my car and go \u2018Happy days\u2019. I think I\u2019ve got to work even harder so that person can think even better of the team.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just how I am. Normally I get loads of stick from the kit man because I give something away. It\u2019s just how I am. This club is greater than any one person, one player, one whatever \u2014 maybe one manager, we stand on his shoulders and always will. But this club is unique and it\u2019s about being together. I have never been more determined to get things right.\u201d\n\n(Top photo: Michael Regan via Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-11813363/Nottingham-Forest-face-fight-hold-boss-Steve-Cooper-season.html", "page_content": "Forest are 13th in the Premier League, four points clear of the bottom three\n\nNottingham Forest are facing a fight to keep manager Steve Cooper at the club ahead of next season.\n\nCooper has built a reputation as one of the country\u2019s best young coaches at the City Ground but his work is attracting interest from rival clubs.\n\nA number of Premier League managerial jobs are set to come up at the end of the season and Sportsmail understands Cooper is already being identified by clubs as a target.\n\nThere is doubt over the head coach\u2019s position at Tottenham, Chelsea, West Ham, Southampton and Leeds heading into the end of the season.\n\nBrighton may also be on the look out for a new boss amid growing interest in their manager Roberto De Zerbi.\n\nSteve Cooper is attracting interest from a number of top Premier League clubs for next season\n\nCooper is currently under consideration for at least two clubs heading into the summer.\n\nThe former Swansea boss found himself under huge pressure earlier in the season following a tough start, but has emerged as a possible manager of the season contender after turning Forest\u2019s season around.\n\nCooper signed a new contract earlier this season, tying him to the club until 2025 but his work at the City Ground is not going unnoticed by teams in England\u2019s top division with Forest bracing themselves for interest in their boss."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jul/21/swansea-head-coach-steve-cooper-heading-for-exit-after-growing-unsettled", "page_content": "Steve Cooper has departed Swansea City by mutual consent after growing unsettled.

The club were keen to offer Cooper, whose deal runs until next summer, a new contract following defeat by Brentford at Wembley but the former England Under-17 manager was reluctant to enter talks.

Segura, meanwhile, returned to his native Catalonia to work in Barcelona\u2019s youth set-up and has since become general football manager at the Nou Camp.\n\nThe latter made a big impression on Cooper, and he has continued to outline Segura\u2019s influence on his approach to coaching over the years.\n\nIn an interview with The Guardian in May 2017, he said of the Spaniard: \u201cI thought I was in a decent place with my coaching before I met Pep [Segura], but then I realised that I had a load of work to do.\n\n\u201cFrom a coaching point of view, he has been the biggest influence on me. He just showed me the way \u2013 a different way.\n\n\u201cThe biggest message that Pep gave me was that you\u2019ve got to know what you want your team to look like at the end \u2013 close your eyes and imagine what is happening.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s one thing knowing what it looks like, it\u2019s also how you get there.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I pride myself on now, having a clear view of when the team is getting it right and where I want them to go, but also the bits to get there. So how do you train the game-model, for example?\n\n\u201cPep taught me to create a vision and build back up to it. More than anything, once you\u2019ve got your vision, once you\u2019ve got your steps to get there, with your periodisation of training, the type of practices that you use, the individual profiling of players, then stick to it. You need to have belief in it.\u201d\n\nHaving impressed at Melwood, Cooper became academy manager in 2011, and his time with the Reds saw him help develop such young talents as Raheem Sterling, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Wales international Ben Woodburn, before his move to the FA two years later.\n\nWorld Cup glory\n\nCooper initially joined the FA as a youth coach educator before taking on the task of coaching England Under-16s in 2014.\n\nHe made the step up to under-17 level the following year, and enjoyed fantastic, unprecedented success.\n\nHe led the Young Lions to the final of the 2017 European Championship, where they lost to Spain on penalties, but they gained revenge later in the year by coming from 2-0 down to beat the same opponents 5-2 in the World Cup final in India. They had never previously been further than the quarter-finals in the global competition.\n\nThe England side that day included the likes of Phil Foden, Rhian Brewster and Callum Hudson-Odoi, while Jadon Sancho was in the squad for the tournament.\n\nCooper\u2019s team were widely praised for their attractive, attacking style of play.\n\nIn addition to the five goals scored in the final, they put three past Brazil in the semi-finals and four past the USA in the last eight.\n\n\"It's about playing our way... we want to play with purpose, dominate possession, play forward and get the ball back as quick as we can.

It felt like a question of when, not if, Cooper would move on. Few imagined it would take this long.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrystal Palace were keen on him but not keen enough and instead chose Patrick Vieira. Fulham also gave serious consideration to appointing the Welshman before deciding to go for Marco Silva. West Bromwich Albion turned to Valerien Ismael, Scott Parker switched to Bournemouth and suddenly all the horses on the managerial merry-go-round were taken.\n\nCooper could have opted to stay on and see out the final 12 months of the three-year contract he signed when he replaced Graham Potter in the summer of 2019, but that always seemed an unlikely option and, in the circumstances, would not have suited either party.\n\nThere were signs of tension behind the scenes with the club\u2019s US owners and little in the way of a working relationship with the chief executive Julian Winter, who was appointed as Trevor Birch\u2019s replacement at the start of September last year. Cooper had been particularly close to Birch.\n\nIn many ways, it would have worked out better for Swansea \u2014 as well as for Cooper \u2014 if Palace or Fulham had offered him the job and a compensation package had been agreed. Nothing materialised, though, and that left both manager and club in a quandary as the new season started to come into view. Did they muddle through the next nine or 10 months like a couple who know their marriage is coming to an end, or agree to go their separate ways now?\n\nIn the end, it was the latter and although the timing of that decision raises major questions, it is arguably better this way than going through the motions and, potentially, making a change two or three months into the season when another club is pursuing Cooper or things have badly unravelled.\n\nMatt Grimes celebrates scoring against Barnsley in the Championship play-off semi-final second leg (Photo: Nick Potts/PA Images via Getty Images)\n\nIt would also be naive in the extreme to think that Swansea have just found out Cooper is not going to be their head coach any longer. It is understood the club have been exploring options for some time and that an appointment will be made swiftly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Cooper, he is expected to take a break from management rather than jump straight into another job.\n\nOn the face of it, Cooper had more to lose than gain by continuing at Swansea. After leading the club to the play-offs in successive seasons and accumulating 150 points in the process \u2014 quite an achievement for anyone, let alone somebody who is managing at senior level for the first time \u2014 his stock is high. This season promises to be much more challenging for the Welsh club, though, and Cooper knew it.\n\nThe Premier League parachute payments have come to an end after three seasons in the Championship and the message inside the club is that Swansea will once again need to trade at a profit in this transfer window. In other words, sell their best players.\n\nCooper fought hard to keep his captain Matt Grimes at the Liberty Stadium last year, but it would be futile for anybody to try to do the same again. Swansea need the money and the time has come for the midfielder to move on. Grimes will leave this summer and there is every chance that Connor Roberts will follow him, despite currently being injured.\n\nAndre Ayew, Swansea\u2019s top scorer last season, has already departed as a free agent, saving the club the best part of \u00a380,000 a week but leaving a sizeable hole in a goals column that was already light.\n\nFreddie Woodman has returned to Newcastle United after back-to-back season-long loans and Marc Guehi, who spent 18 months on loan at Swansea, went back to Chelsea earlier this summer before being sold to Palace for \u00a318 million. That\u2019s the spine of last season\u2019s team gone.\n\nDid Cooper have the motivation to build another side? Did he have the energy? There was a sense within the club that successive play-off campaigns with little in the way of a break between the two seasons \u2014 Swansea played 64 matches in under 12 months \u2014 had taken their toll on a coach who put his heart and soul into the role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have given any more in the last two years because that\u2019s what the job demands and that\u2019s how I personally live my life,\u201d Cooper said after the Plymouth friendly, when he chose his words carefully about his future. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody that could have worked any harder than me because I\u2019ve been so proud to be a part of this brilliant football club.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most curious thing about Cooper and Swansea is that he leaves with a hugely impressive results record \u2014 a 45 per cent win percentage and two top-six finishes \u2014 yet with supporters conflicted and divided about his time in charge because of a style of play that was hard to define at times.\n\nSwansea were efficient and disciplined defensively under Cooper but rarely expansive and free-scoring. They regularly found a way to win matches despite averaging the fourth-lowest number of shots per game in the Championship last season and rarely dominating the ball.\n\nIt was a formula that worked for a long time but it was also hard to see how the run of results that had Swansea on course for automatic promotion with 11 games of last season remaining was sustainable, and so it proved as four consecutive defeats followed in the space of 20 days. Swansea ended up finishing fourth and although they navigated a way past Barnsley in the play-off semi-finals, Brentford were simply too good for them.\n\nNot that missing out on promotion can be seen as any sort of failure for Cooper. Swansea\u2019s owners made such a mess of things during their two years in charge in the Premier League that the club have sold anyone with any value since being relegated and reinvested very little in the squad. They were certainly not geared up for an automatic promotion challenge under Cooper, put it that way.\n\nCooper had to beg and borrow to get players in and he used his contacts excellently in that respect. His close relationship with talented youngsters and top Premier League clubs through his work at the Football Association \u2014 with whom he led England Under-17s to win their World Cup in 2017 \u2014 enabled Swansea to sign some exceptional players on loan.\n\nCooper celebrates winning the Under-17 World Cup with England in 2017 (Photo: Tom Dulat \u2013 FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images)\n\nChelsea were happy to let Swansea borrow Guehi and Conor Gallagher. Rhian Brewster joined from Liverpool on loan \u2014 and was sold to Sheffield United for \u00a325 million six months later. Morgan Gibbs-White signed on loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers. Woodman arrived from Newcastle. In short, clubs trusted Cooper not only to give those players game time but also to develop them, and Swansea reaped the rewards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the return of Ayew ended up being an unexpected bonus for Cooper (that was by accident rather than design since the club couldn\u2019t find a buyer for their record signing after he had spent the 2018-19 season on loan at Fenerbahce in Turkey), the Ghanaian forward was never an out-and-out striker and that position became a problem for Swansea last season.\n\nCooper hoped it would be addressed in January, when he wanted to bring in Cauley Woodrow from Barnsley, but Swansea\u2019s owners were not willing to sanction a deal that, in truth, was never close to getting done.\n\nLeaving aside the question of whether Woodrow was the right fit, there was a school of thought at the club that Swansea\u2019s owners missed an opportunity to capitalise on their league position by failing to bring in a No 9 of any description, and it is easy to imagine what sort of message that sent to Cooper, his staff and the players.\n\nAlthough there was a feeling among some that Cooper\u2019s relationship with the owners deteriorated over time, it is understood that the last few weeks have been amicable. He oversaw the return to pre-season training at Pennyhill Park in Surrey and there was no indication whatsoever that his commitment had waned, even if the end was in sight.\n\nAll the while, Swansea have continued to pursue signings and that process will accelerate under the new coach, with a striker seen as a priority. The club plan to make use of the loan market again, although it remains to be seen what impact Cooper\u2019s departure will have on the calibre of players they can attract. Talks have been held with several top Premier League clubs and those conversations will need to be revisited when his successor is appointed.\n\nThe transfer window is not closing until the end of next month \u2014 time is still on Swansea\u2019s side in that respect.\n\nThe same cannot be said for the start of the season, however, which is only 17 days away and leaves very little time for a new coach to become acquainted with the players.\n\n(Top photo: Athena Pictures/Getty Images)"}]}
