They eventually embraced Quakerism, and Mary repeatedly returned to Boston to preach the new doctrine in defiance of the Puritan magistrates. Such persistence earned her martyrdom.\n\nAmong the Dyers other famous ancestors was a prior Elisha (1772-1854), a textile manufacturer who founded and operated the Dyerville Mill in North Providence.\n\nThe first governor Dyer, despite being an invalid for the thirty-five years preceding his death in 1890, excelled in many walks of life\u2013businessman, musician, world traveler, banker, railroad magnate, philanthropist, and a civic leader who was involved with innumerable boards and commissions, as well as with the temperance movement. He served as state adjutant general for the Law and Order government during the Dorr Rebellion and was elected Republican governor of Rhode Island in 1857 and 1858, declining reelection in 1859. When he left office the Providence Post, a leading Democratic paper, admitted that \u201cWe have from the first looked upon him as an honorable, high-minded opponent and a straightforward conscientious man; and candor compels us to say that he has never failed to reach the standard set up for him.\u201d\n\nDyer, Elisha, 1839-1909\n\nThe second Governor Elisha Dyer (1839-1906) carved out a career that paralleled that of his father. After graduation from Brown University in 1856, he earned a doctorate in science at the University of Geissen in Germany, and later became a manufacturing chemist.\n\nElisha served in the Civil War as a sergeant and suffered a nearly disabling injury. Nonetheless, he maintained his interest and involvement with the military, eventually serving as Rhode Island adjutant general from 1882 to 1895 and later compiling a valuable reference book on The War With Spain.\n\nA prominent Republican, Dyer was elected governor in 1897 and won reelection in 1898 and 1899. At various times during his amazingly successful career he won election as Providence school committeeman, alderman, state representative, and state senator. In 1905, a year before his death, he was chosen Mayor of Providence, thereby rounding out a political career unequaled in the annals of his native city.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss776.htm", "page_content": "Historical note:\n\nThe bulk of the papers in this collection are those of Governor Samuel Ward (1725-1776) and his son Lieutenant-Colonel Samuel Ward (1756-1832) of Westerly, Rhode Island. The remainder are those of their immediate family members, and their descendants who settled in New York. Both Governor Ward and his son Samuel Jr. served the cause of American independence: Governor Samuel, in the Continental Congress, and Samuel Jr. (\u201cSammy\u201d) in the First Rhode Island Regiment.\n\nGovernor Ward was an ardent defender of the American colonists\u2019 rights to liberty and representation. Published accounts of his life, and his papers, indicate that he had begun to build an argument against British abuses for close to ten years prior to the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, including the years when he was governor of the colony. He was reportedly the only colonial governor to refuse to sign the oath to enforce the Stamp Act of 1765. His death in Philadelphia in March, 1776, just weeks before he would have signed his name to the Declaration of Independence, seems, in this light, almost a tragedy in the classic sense. It should be noted, however, that Ward, along with others in the Continental Congress, was a slave owner. Papers in this collection indicate he had purchased a slave as late as 1771, and there were two slaves listed on his estate inventory dated May, 1776. Cudgoe, a slave Ward had purchased in 1768, was with him in Philadelphia at the time of his death.\n\nGovernor Ward was born May 27, 1725 in Newport of Richard and Mary (Tillinghast) Ward. His father was a Newport merchant and Colonial Governor of Rhode Island from 1740 to 1743. Little is known of Ward\u2019s youth. He married Anna Ray, daughter of Simon and Deborah (Greene) Ray of Block Island, at Westerly in 1745, and moved there after the marriage; exactly when is unknown. (Anna\u2019s half-brother was Gideon Ray (b. 1698), a sea captain, who was probably the author of the receipt/memoranda book in Series 7.)\n\nBefore becoming a public figure Ward was a farmer and store owner. His public life began in 1756 when he was elected one of Westerly\u2019s two deputies to the Rhode Island General Assembly. He served in the Assembly until May, 1758. In 1757, a feud developed between Ward and Governor Stephen Hopkins when Ward published statements against Hopkins during his campaign for governor against William Greene. Ward ran for governor against Hopkins four times between 1758 and 1761, losing each time. In the meantime he served as moderator of Westerly town meetings; was one of Rhode Island\u2019s delegates to the 1758 Hartford Conference, called by Lord Loudoun (John Campbell) to discuss contributions expected of New England and New York in the French-Indian War; and in 1761 was elected Chief Justice of the Rhode Island Superior Court by the General Assembly. He served as Chief Justice for one term.\n\nIn 1762 Ward succeeded in his bid for governor of the colony. He was elected again in 1765 and 1766, the period during which the Stamp Act was to take effect. While he served in a public capacity, he also was concerned with farming and merchant activities on the home front. As of 1765, Ward had a shop on Thames Street in Newport, but how long it was there prior to or after that date is unknown. In 1770 Ward was defeated in a run for governor against incumbent Joseph Wanton. His wife Anna died the same year.\n\nIn 1774, the Rhode Island legislature elected Ward and Stephen Hopkins as delegates to the first Continental Congress to be held in Philadelphia. The pair were elected again to the second Continental Congress which convened in Philadelphia in May, 1775. Approximately three months prior to the signing of the Declaration of Independence, on March 25, 1776, Ward died of smallpox. His place at the Continental Congress was taken by William Ellery of Newport. Bernhard Knollenberg\u2019s biography of Ward observes that, by the end of 1775\n\n...Ward, perhaps because in better health than Hopkins, perhaps because of his bolder stand, seems to have become more of a figure in Congress than Hopkins. Ward was now usually chosen Chairman when Congress resolved itself into a Committee of the Whole, and he, rather than Hopkins, was elected a member of the especially important standing committees of Congress, the Secret Committee for supplies from foreign sources and the Committee on Claims, both established in September, 1775.\n\nKnollenberg also notes that a diary kept by Yale president Ezra Stiles (1727-1795) listed \u201cthe Cardinals...or men of greatest Abilities and Influence\u201d in the Congress in order of importance, and that Ward was third after Samuel and John Adams.\n\nWard was originally buried in the First Baptist Churchyard in Philadelphia. In 1860, his remains were re-interred by his descendants in the Common Burial Ground in Newport, Rhode Island. The children of Samuel and Anna Ward were:\n\nCharles, born 1747, a soldier in the Revolution\n\nHanna (1749-1774)\n\nAnna (1750-1798)\n\nCatherine (1752-1782), who married Colonel Christopher Greene\n\nMary, unmarried (1754-1832)\n\nSamuel Jr. (1756-1832)\n\nDeborah (1758-1835), second wife of Colonel Christopher Greene\n\nSimon Ray (1760-1835)\n\nJohn (1762-1823)\n\nRichard (1765-1808)\n\nElizabeth (1767-1783)\n\nGovernor Ward\u2019s second son, Samuel Jr. (\u201cSammy\u201d) was born November 17, 1756 in Westerly. He graduated from Rhode Island College (Brown University) in 1771 at the age of fifteen. His military career began when he was commissioned a captain in the Army of Observation in May, 1775, at the age of eighteen. He participated in Benedict Arnold\u2019s attack on Quebec in December, 1775, under his brother-in-law Lieutenant-Colonel Christopher Greene (husband of his sister Catherine), and was taken prisoner by the British. He was released in August, 1776. Subsequently Ward was promoted to the rank of major in the First Rhode Island Infantry and, between 1776 and 1778, served with his regiment at Morristown, New Jersey (1777); Peekskill, New York (1777); Red Bank (Fort Mercer) under Christopher Greene (1777); Valley Forge (1778); and the Battle of Rhode Island (1778).\n\nCol. Ward married Phebe Greene in 1778 while on leave from military duties at Valley Forge; she was the daughter of Governor William Greene and Catherine (Ray). Ward returned to Rhode Island from Pennsylvania in the summer of 1778, and along with Christopher Greene recruited African-American men for a new Rhode Island regiment. These troops played an instrumental role in the military action on Aquidneck in August. In May, 1779, Ward was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel of the First Rhode Island and detached to command a Light Corps of troops near Providence, then was stationed at North Kingstown and Newport.\n\nIn early 1781, Congress ordered the First Rhode Island to merge with the Second Rhode Island, and several officers, including Ward, were forced to retire. In a letter dated April 16, 1781 Christopher Greene tells Ward \u201cI often very agreeably reflect upon the Toils and Dangers we have gone through together during the Course of this horrid War and nothing cou\u2019d halve been more agreeable than to have had your company in commd to the end of it, But so cou\u2019d not be...we therefore must for the present be a part.\u201d\n\nWard went into business as a merchant in Warwick, where he remained until about 1787. During 1788 and 1789, Ward sailed to China for the Providence firm Brown & Francis as supercargo for the vessel General Washington, the first Rhode Island ship to engage in the China trade. He moved to New York in late 1790, doing business with his brothers Richard and John under the firm name Samuel Ward and Brothers. Ward returned to Rhode Island in 1804; then went back to New York in 1807, though his wife Phoebe remained in Rhode Island. He was president of the New York Marine Insurance Company until about 1808. He returned to Rhode Island in 1809 and stayed until about 1816, then made his permanent home in New York: first in Jamaica, Long Island, then in New York City, where he died in 1832.\n\nSamuel and Phoebe (Greene) Ward\u2019s children were:\n\nWilliam Greene (1779-1798)\n\nHenry (b. 1784)\n\nSamuel (1786-1839)\n\nAnn Catherine (1788-1837, unmarried)\n\nPhoebe (1791-1825, unmarried)\n\nRichard Ray (b. 1795)\n\nJohn (1797-1866, unmarried)\n\nWilliam Greene (b. 1802)\n\nSamuel (III) was a member of the firm Prime, Ward & Sands (later Prime, Ward & King) and father of Julia Ward Howe (1819-1910), author of the Battle Hymn of the Republic. His son Samuel (IV) became a famous lobbyist. Richard Ray Ward was a lawyer and antiquarian, and John and William Greene Ward were bankers in Ward & Co. of New York.\n\nBibliography:\n\nBiographic Cyclopedia of Representative Men of Rhode Island (Providence, National Biographic Publishing Co., 1881), 95.\n\nHedges, James B.

The largest and most important series are Series 4 and 5: the papers of Governor Samuel Ward and his son, Col. Samuel Ward, respectively.\n\nCorrespondence predominates the Ward Family Papers. Among the papers of each series are also a few financial and estate papers, deeds, memoranda books, and/or Revolutionary War documents.\n\nIn Series 4, Governor Ward\u2019s papers, several political issues of colonial and Revolutionary America are addressed: the attempt at collecting monies due the Rhode Island colony for military contributions to England during the French-Indian War, 1762; a dispute over the British vessels St. John, Squirrel, and Maidstone while at anchor in Newport Harbor in 1764; antagonism between colonists and customs officials in Newport in 1765; the Boston Port Bill; and the developing movement toward American independence: specifically, Ward\u2019s activities on the Westerly Town Council and Committee of Correspondence (early 1774), and as a delegate to the Continental Congress. Exchanges of correspondence in 1762 and 1765 are especially enlightening as to the way in which colonial and British officials antagonized each other in reaction to increasing political tensions in the colonies. There is much correspondence during the year 1772 from Henry Marchant, William Ellery, and James Mitchell Varnum, but most of it is legal advice pertaining to a land dispute between Ward and Joseph Noyes.\n\nThere are several items in Governor Ward\u2019s papers relating to African and Native Americans, including a 1745 receipt, and 1762 indenture, relating to Native American servants of Ward; two bills of sale, one dated January 14, 1768, from Isabel Marchant to Ward, for a \u201cNegro Man Slave named Cajoe aged about Thirty three Years\u201d, and a 1771 bill of sale for a slave purchased by him; and a 1774 Rhode Island census which includes the total number of \u201cIndian\u201d and \u201cNegroes\u201d assessed. Cudgoe, the slave purchased in 1768, accompanied Ward to the Continental Congress, and is mentioned in the letter from Philadelphian Mary House to Ward\u2019s children dated April 27, 1776. Ward\u2019s indexed Newport account book, 1753 to 1763, contains occasional designations as to ethnicity, genealogy, residency, rank, or occupation of the persons listed.\n\nThe correspondence of Governor Ward\u2019s son Col. Samuel concerns primarily his war service, his attempts to rectify back-pay issues to discharged officers, and his business activities in Rhode Island, China, Europe, and New York. There are also ship\u2019s papers and journals from his voyage to China. Letters written during Ward\u2019s military years are vague as to military and political activity. Briefly touched upon are his trek to Quebec in 1775 and, in letters from his father, his subsequent imprisonment. There are four letters written from Ward to his wife Phoebe from Valley Forge in 1778, and six written to her from Aquidneck during August of 1778, including one describing action on the 28th. There are approximately four letters from Colonel Christopher Greene between 1780 and 1781. A copy of a letter from Jeremiah Olney, dated June 21, 1781, discusses the dispensation of Greene\u2019s effects after his death in May, 1781. A letter written May 23, 1783 from Ward to William Ellery mentions the general opposition in Rhode Island to \u201cany pecuniary considerations or even honorary distinctions\u201d to Revolutionary War officers. Other correspondents to Ward in the 1780s include Connecticut legislator Jeremiah Wadsworth; James Mitchell Varnum; and Ward\u2019s brothers and business partners John and Richard. Also noteworthy is an 1806 certificate from the Westerly Town Council naming \u201cCuggo\u201d (Cudgoe), the slave who had belonged to Ward\u2019s father, and another slave named Pegg, who \u201chath for some time past and still Remain in want and need some speedy support\u201d from Governor Ward\u2019s heirs. There is also a letter from Ward\u2019s niece Celia Greene, written from the Troy Female Seminary in 1827, describing her education and defending female intelligence.\n\nThere is a large amount of correspondence to Ward\u2019s wife Phoebe (Greene), mostly from Ward concerning his business travels and prospects. Other correspondents to Phoebe include her parents Gov. William and Catherine (Ray) Greene (1792 forward); her children, especially her sons William Greene, Henry, and Samuel; and Anne (Vernon) Olyphant, her husband\u2019s cousin.\n\nThe remainder of correspondence in the collection belongs, for the most part, to Ward family members living in New York, and contains little Rhode Island content. Exceptions are letters to Colonel Samuel\u2019s son Richard Ray Ward written between 1845 and 1846 from Rhode Islander William Gammell, about a biography of Governor Ward and the loan of Ward papers. Additionally, there is a note to Richard from his niece Julia (Ward) Howe, the daughter of Richard\u2019s brother Samuel (1786-1839), dated June 6, 1861. There is also a copy of her famous poem The Battle Hymn of the Republic (Series 7) written in the hand of her uncle Richard.\n\nIn Series 7, the receipt book believed to belong to Block Island sea captain Gideon Ray contains receipts for payments to crew members for extremely early voyages to South Carolina on the sloop Shorham (1723) and the sloop Block Island (1724); also for voyages to what appears to be Martinique (1725). There is also one receipt entry dated February, 1723, out of Port Royal, Jamaica. One other vessel, the Abigale, is mentioned in an entry on the book\u2019s inside cover. In addition to receipts, the book also lists supplies for voyages, including an undated list for rum, sugar, and cocoa shipped to various parties; and accounts. The latest entry details the division of the land of Simon Ray, father of Anna (Ray) Ward, to three of his children, and are written in a hand different from earlier entries.\n\nOther substantial collections of Lieutenant-Colonel Samuel Ward\u2019s papers can be found at the New York Public Library (2.5 feet) and the Houghton Library at Harvard University (3 boxes). The NYPL collection includes a small number of documents relating to Gov. Samuel and Col. Samuel. It appears from photostats in the collection that there may also be papers at the John Carter Brown Library in Providence, and the William L. Clements Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nSeries list:\n\nSeries 1: Henry Ward (1731-1797)\n\nSeries 2: John Ward (1797-1866)\n\nSeries 3: Richard Ray Ward (1795-1873)\n\nSeries 4: Governor Samuel Ward (\u201cSW I\u201d) (1725-1776) and Anna (Ray) Ward (1728-1770)\n\nSeries 5: Colonel Samuel Ward (\u201cSW II\u201d) (1756-1832) and Phoebe (Greene) Ward (1760-1828)\n\nSeries 6: Samuel Ward III (1786-1839)\n\nSeries 7: Miscellaneous Ward Family\n\nSeries 8: Ward Family Genealogy\n\nReturn to top\n\nProvenance:\n\nDue to the complexity of the provenance of this collection, its complete history is stored in the collection file. The bulk of the papers were in the hands of Governor Samuel Ward\u2019s grandson Richard Ray Ward (son of Col. Samuel Ward II) in the 1840s. They continued to be passed down to a number of Ward descendants, remaining in the family until 1945, when they were sold to the Rhode Island Historical Society for $5000. This purchase comprised the bulk of the present Ward Papers, including about fifteen hundred documents dating from 1732 to 1850.\n\nAnother important lot of Ward Papers also appears to have passed through the possession of Richard Ray Ward. It is unknown whether they continued on through the same complex route as the other papers, or whether they were inherited by Richard\u2019s daughter and sole heir, Gertrude R. (Ward) Dodd (b.1838). In any event, they somehow passed into the private collection of Charlotte and Edgar Sittig, who were Pennsylvania manuscript collectors, by the mid-twentieth century. The Sittig Collection was placed up for auction in May of 1999 by Horst Auctioneers in Ephrata, Pennsylvania. The Sittigs\u2019 batch of Ward Papers were sold off in 68 lots. Eight lots totaling about 0.5 linear feet were purchased at the auction by the Rhode Island Historical Society. The purchased lots included: 78 items relating to Maj. Samuel Ward III, 1804-1838; 38 items relating to Richard Ray Ward, 1820-1865; a 1762 indenture and 1745 receipt relating to Native American servants of Gov. Samuel Ward; a 1771 bill of sale for a slave purchased by Gov. Samuel Ward; 40 items from Col. Samuel Ward II\u2019s 1788-1789 voyage to China as supercargo aboard the ship General Washington; a 1791 Henry Marchant letter; two Asher Robbins letters; and two Tristam Burges letters. In November of 1999, the Society purchased, from dealer Charles Apfelbaum, 23 items relating to Colonel Samuel Ward that had originally been dispersed to Apfelbaum at the Horst auction.\n\nAn anonymous letter to Governor Samuel Ward and Stephen Hopkins (3/18/1768?) was a gift from the Providence Washington Insurance Company in 1845. Governor Ward\u2019s draft of a letter he wrote to George Washington, dated September 9, 1775, was the gift of John Ward in 1873. Ward\u2019s Continental Congress diary, dated 1774-1775, was purchased form University of Virginia librarian Harry Clemons in 1945 for $135. Some \u201cSamuel Ward letters\u201d were purchased from Parke-Bernet in 1957; accession records do not indicate the number of letters nor to which Samuel they belonged. A letter from Colonel Samuel Ward to an unidentified recipient, dated April 3, 1799, was purchased from the Carnegie Book Shop in 1968. Three Ward family letters dated from 1805 to 1810 were purchased of the Manuscript Company of Springfield in 1983. An 1822 lease from Samuel Ward III to James V. Turner for Warwick land was donated by Cherry Fletcher Bamberg in 2001; she had purchased it at Internet auction.\n\nReturn to top\n\nProcessing note:\n\nIn folder labeling, Governor Samuel Ward (Series 4) is designated as \u201cSW I\u201d, and his son, Colonel Samuel Ward (Series 5), is designated as \u201cSW II\u201d. Governor Ward\u2019s grandson Samuel (Series 6) is \u201cSW III\u201d, and his great-grandson Samuel (Series 7) is \u201cSW IV\u201d.\n\nMost of the letters among Governor Ward\u2019s papers (Series 4) are originals, or Ward\u2019s copies of his outgoing correspondence. However, some are photostats of letters in other repositories, and manuscript and typescript copies made presumably by Ward\u2019s descendants. For preservation purposes, photostat copies found among the Governor Ward letters were filed in separate folders. Photostats that were duplicates of originals in the collection were weeded out. Some photostats are marked with the name of the repository from which they were copied.\n\nMany of Governor Ward\u2019s letters from May, 1775 to March, 1776 have been published in Correspondence of Governor Samuel Ward, compiled by Bernhard Knollenberg and Clifford P. Monahon. Earlier letters are not, for the most part, in the book, except for a few that are extracted or published in full in its introduction, and two items found in box 1, folder 53: Ward\u2019s \u201cA Prayer\u201d, and his statement of faith to the Sabbatarian Church in Westerly and Hopkinton. When possible, pre-1775 letters in this collection that have been fully or partially published have been so marked in the attached calendar to Governor Ward\u2019s correspondence.\n\nThree items from Governor Ward\u2019s papers are filed in oversized storage: an agreement concerning the dispute between Gov. Ward and Stephen Hopkins, dated March 12, 1767; a letter from \u201cThe Friends of America\u201d concerning New York loyalist printer James Rivington; and a deed from Ethan Clarke in settlement of Ward's estate (1777). Archival copies have been filed in their places.\n\nSeries 7 contains papers from two William Greene Wards, both sons of Colonel Samuel Ward, born twenty-three years apart. The first son of that name died in 1798. Since undated correspondence to \u201cWilliam Greene Ward\u201d could be intended for either the first William (born 1779), or his brother (1802-1848), undated letters have been filed separately.\n\nReturn to top\n\nInventory:\n\nSeries 1: Henry Ward (1732-1797); R.

He also was a central figure in the birth of the Industrial Revolution, founding what was generally considered to be the first factory in America. In a busy life that spanned 98 years, he was prominent in virtually every aspect of life in his home town of Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nMoses Brown was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the youngest son of James and Hope (Power) Brown. He was the grandson of Baptist minister James Brown (1666-1732), and his father was a prosperous merchant. His father died in 1739, and Moses was raised in the family of his uncle Obadiah Brown (1712-1762). From age 13 to 22, he was an apprentice in his uncle\u2019s firm, Obadiah Brown & Co. In 1760, he became a full partner, and was primarily responsible for running the firm\u2019s spermaceti works. The firm was also active in distilling rum, owned an iron furnace, and took part in a wide variety of merchant activities including at least one slave voyage in 1759. Obadiah Brown died in 1762, and Moses Brown served as executor of his estate. Shares in the company were divided between Moses Brown and his three brothers, Nicholas, John and Joseph; it was renamed as Nicholas Brown & Co. This new firm quickly began involved with the slave trade, with Moses as an active partner. Their ship Sally left for Africa in 1764, and on the return trip most of the slaves died at sea from disease or were killed during unsuccessful revolts. After this one disastrous voyage, the firm does not seem to have had any direct involvement in the slave trade.\n\nMoses Brown married his cousin Anna Brown (daughter of his uncle Obadiah) in 1764. They had two surviving children: Sarah (1764-1794, married William Almy) and Obadiah (1771-1822), as well as a daughter who died young. Moses also served as a deputy to the Rhode Island General Assembly from 1764 to 1771, and served on a committee to oppose the Stamp Act in 1765. In 1769, he was active in efforts to move Rhode Island College to Providence from the town of Warren. The four Brown brothers donated family land for the new campus. Much later, after a generous donation from Nicholas Brown Jr., the school was renamed Brown University.\n\nBrown\u2019s wife Anna died in 1773. He gradually retired from the family business and began attending Quaker meetings. The following year he formally became a member of the Society of Friends. As a Quaker, he began a lifelong crusade against slavery, and soon became the leading opponent of the slave trade in Rhode Island. He freed his own slaves in 1773. As his brother John Brown was one of the state\u2019s leading slave traders, this caused some interesting tensions in the family. During the Revolution, Brown was active in New England Yearly Meeting\u2019s efforts to provide financial assistance to war refugees. He also led the efforts to start a Yearly Meeting School for Friends\u2019 children; it operated from 1777 to 1779, and then in Portsmouth, R.I. from 1784 to 1788, but lack of funds closed it both times.\n\nIn 1779, Brown married his second wife, Mary Olney, a fellow Quaker. They were married for 18 years, and had no children.\n\nAt the close of the war, Brown renewed his efforts against the slave trade. He unsuccessfully petitioned the General Assembly in 1783, wrote frequently in the local press, and helped distribute antislavery pamphlets throughout New England. He was instrumental in the 1787 passage of a law banning the participation of Rhode Islanders in the slave trade. In 1789, he helped found the Providence Society for Abolishing the Slave Trade with both Quaker and non-Quaker associates to help enforce this new law. He later helped to get a law passed in the U.S. Congress to forbid foreign slave ships from being equipped in American ports. He also became known for his willingness to help slaves and free blacks on an individual basis, through financial and legal assistance.\n\nIn 1788, Brown returned briefly to the business world, embarking on a textile venture in partnership with his cousin Smith Brown and his future son-in-law William Almy. Moses Brown became interested in the recent British attempts to use water power in their textile mills, and hired English emigrant Samuel Slater to help build a similar mill in what is now Pawtucket. In 1790, this became the first water-powered spinning mill in America, an event generally considered the birth of our Industrial Revolution. Moses\u2019 son Obadiah Brown soon replaced Smith Brown as a partner, and Samuel Slater was taken in as well, forming the new firm of Almy, Brown & Slater. Moses Brown soon withdrew from active involvement in the firm, but remained a partner.\n\nAfter getting Almy, Brown & Slater off the ground, Moses Brown moved on to a variety of new activities. He played a role in Rhode Island\u2019s ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1790. He also became interested in agricultural experiments on his Providence farm, and helped found the Rhode Island Agricultural Society in 1800. He served on the first board of directors of the Providence Bank, and was treasurer of the Central Bridge Company. He also was, with his son Obadiah, a founder of the Rhode Island Bible Society. During the yellow fever epidemic of 1797, he was a strong advocate of sanitary measures, and later introduced smallpox vaccination to Rhode Island.\n\nBrown\u2019s second wife Mary died in 1798, and he married his third and final wife, the widow Phebe (Waterman) Lockwood, in 1799. She had several grown children of her own: Sarah (1773-1832, married E. Bates Harris), Avis (1774-1831, never married), Benoni (1777-1852) and Phebe (1778-1800). After the death of his third wife in 1809, Moses remained unmarried for the last 27 years of his life.\n\nBrown was inspired by the War of 1812 to work on behalf of peace, and was instrumental in the founding of the Rhode Island Peace Society in 1818. Another interest was local history. He played an important role in collecting the documents relating to colonial Rhode Island, many of them inherited through his own family. He was a founding member of the Rhode Island Historical Society, served as its chairman, and had most of his papers left there after his death.\n\nBrown\u2019s last great contribution to Rhode Island life was his role in the revival of the New England Yearly Meeting School. It had existed intermittently in the 1770s and 1780s, but died out through lack of interest. In 1814, Brown presented the Yearly Meeting with 43 acres of land in Providence, and worked diligently toward the creation of a school on this land. He rendered important financial assistance, and also donated his impressive book collection to the school library. His son Obadiah was a major supporter of this effort until his untimely death in 1822. Moses Brown served as the school\u2019s treasurer until shortly before his own death in 1836, at the age of 98. The school was later renamed in his honor as the Moses Brown School, and remains the leading preparatory school in the state.\n\nMoses Brown left few family members, having outlived three wives, all three of his children, and three of his four step-children. At his death, his only descendants were his granddaughter Sarah (Almy) Jenkins (1790-1849) and her children. He also left much of his estate to the children of his stepdaughter Sarah (Lockwood) Harris (1773-1832), and to the Society of Friends. His son Obadiah had married, but had not left any children.\n\nWhile Moses Brown was an important historical figure for many reasons, his anti-slavery activities are probably best remembered. It is easy to defend those who profited from slavery as products of their time. Moses Brown stands as a shining example of a man who refused to profit from the horrors of slavery, long before such stands became fashionable. Through his efforts none of his peers could claim ignorance of the moral dimensions of the slave trade. Though in many ways he was a generation or two ahead of his time, he was more than a voice in the wilderness; he helped pass important legislation and was an influence on the next generation of abolitionists.\n\nBibliography:\n\nBulkley, Abby Isabel (Brown).

Chronologically Arranged, 1753-1836\n\nSeries 2: Subject Files. Alphabetically arranged, 1707-1867\n\nSeries 3: Genealogical and Historical Collection, 1636-1836\n\nSubseries 1: Indexed in the 1887\n\nSubseries 2: Not indexed in 1887\n\nSeries 4: Bound Volumes, 1750-1836\n\nSeries 5: Indices\n\nThe largest and most important is the correspondence series, which includes thousands of letters to and from Moses Brown from 1753 to 1836. Dozens are with his brother John Brown, and often discuss the slave trade. One particularly interesting letter from John dated November 27, 1786 attempts a lengthy moral justification for the trade. Many of the other letters in this series refer to the slave trade, especially after 1796. Other important topics include the Brown family spermaceti works; cotton manufacturing (especially circa 1790); the Society of Friends (Quakers); and state and local politics. There are also many letters to Brown asking for advice, legal assistance or financial support.\n\nThe subject files are arranged thematically, and cover everything from property records to research notes on yellow fever. Four folders titled \"Anti-slavery\" are of particular interest. The historical series, consisting of documents collected by Brown to satisfy his historical curiosity, is very miscellaneous in nature, but is an important source on early colonial Providence. The fourth series contains bound volumes: account books, diaries and school books. Series 5 includes the early indices compiled for the collection as a whole.\n\nProvenance:\n\nThe bulk of this collection arrived in 1851 from the heirs of Moses Brown; this accession probably comprised the full 18 scrapbook volumes of the Moses Brown Papers that had been compiled by 1889. A gift of business account books came from the Moses Brown School in 1914. \u201cA large quantity\u201d of Moses Brown papers was donated in 1919 by Mrs. Austin Fox, Brown\u2019s great-great-granddaughter, in 1919; this included several plats. Numerous other gifts dating from 1839 onward have been integrated into the collection. For a more detailed discussion of the provenance of this collection, see the note in the collection file at the repository.\n\nProcessing Note:\n\nCirca 1880, most of this collection was mounted in 18 scrapbooks. A calendar and index were compiled in 1887. There were 14 volumes of correspondence, three volumes titled \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d, and one for the genealogical and historical material. Each item in the scrapbooks was stamped \u201cRhode Island Historical Society\u201d in red, and a number assigned. Many old citations are made using these numbers, so a listing of the original arrangement might be useful.\n\nOld volume I. Correspondence, 1735-1770 #1 - #273\n\nOld volume II. Correspondence, 1770-1778 #274 - #591\n\nOld volume III. Correspondence, 1778-1782 #592 - #887\n\nOld volume IV. Correspondence, 1782-1784 #888 - #1140\n\nOld volume V. Correspondence, 1784-1787 #1141 - #1466\n\nOld volume VI. Correspondence, 1787-1789 #1467 - #1766\n\nOld volume VII. Correspondence, 1789-1792 #1767 - #2082\n\nOld volume VIII. Correspondence, 1792-1796 #2083 - #2401\n\nOld volume IX. Correspondence, 1796-1799 #2402 - #2729\n\nOld volume X. Correspondence, 1800-1804 #2730 - #3062\n\nOld volume XI. Correspondence, 1804-1810 #3063 - #3380\n\nOld volume XII. Correspondence, 1810-1816 #3381 - #3723\n\nOld volume XIII. Correspondence, 1816-1822 #3724 - #4054\n\nOld volume XIV.

Miscellaneous volume 3, 1678-1824\n\nOld volume XVIII. Genealogical and historical collection.\n\nAround 1950, the collection was removed from these scrapbooks, and a wide variety of other material was integrated into the collection. Item numbers were written in pencil on the items from the historical collection. The whole collection was reorganized circa 1980, and assumed roughly its present form. A rough finding aid was compiled in 1993. Beginning in 1995, the John Nicholas Brown Center for the Study of American Civilization at Brown University, in partnership with the John Carter Brown Library at Brown University and the Rhode Island Historical Society, conducted a two year collaborative project to arrange, describe and catalog records relating to the Brown family of Providence, Rhode Island. The Brown Family Papers Project was made possible by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. This collection was processed as part of that grant.\n\nA separate collection of Moses Brown papers is in the possession of the Archives of the New England Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends (the Quakers); it is referred to as the Austin Collection of Moses Brown Papers. This collection is only one linear foot in volume, but contains important material. It relates largely, but not exclusively, to Moses Brown\u2019s involvement in the Society of Friends. A separate inventory and item index is available.\n\nInventory:\n\nSeries 1: Correspondence.\n\nThis correspondence is indexed through a card catalog at the repository.

He was the son of James and Mary (Harris) Brown, and the great grandson of early Rhode Island settler and Baptist minister Chad Brown. Brown was a member of the General Assembly, and possessed a large property, which was lost during the financial difficulties of the mid-18th century. During the Ward-Hopkins controversy, he sided with Samuel Ward, and during Ward's term as governor from 1765 to 1767, Brown was selected as his deputy governor.\n\nLater in life, Brown moved to Wenscutt, located in North Providence, Rhode Island, and became a member of the Society of Friends. He had first married Martha, the daughter of John and Deborah (Angell) Smith, and a great granddaughter of both colonial president Gregory Dexter as well as Roger Williams' associate Thomas Angell. Following her death, he married Hannah Cushing, the widow of Elijah Cushing, and the daughter of James Barker.\n\nHe was the uncle of wealthy businessman John Brown and anti-slavery activist Moses Brown.\n\nAncestry [ edit ]\n\nMost of Brown's known ancestry is found in Austin's Genealogical Dictionary of Rhode Island.\n\nAncestors of Elisha Brown 8.
