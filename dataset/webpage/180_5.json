{"Stan Heal was a member of the Lakers' 1959 NBA championship team.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Los-Angeles-Lakers", "page_content": "Los Angeles Lakers, American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles. The Lakers are one of the most successful and popular professional franchises in all American sports. The franchise has won a combined 17 Basketball Association of America (BAA) and National Basketball Association (NBA) titles, tied in league history with their rival the Boston Celtics.\n\nThe franchise that would become the Lakers was founded in 1946 as the Detroit Gems and played in the National Basketball League (NBL). The team moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1947, and its name was changed to the Lakers to reflect the Minnesota state nickname, \u201cLand of 10,000 Lakes.\u201d That same year the Lakers acquired George Mikan, who became professional basketball\u2019s first dominant \u201cbig man\u201d and the first in a series of great Laker centres. The Lakers joined the BAA (the official precursor of the NBA) for the 1948\u201349 season and won the final BAA championship. The NBA was formed in 1949, and Mikan and the Lakers\u2014which also featured future Hall of Famers Jim Pollard, Slater Martin, Vern Mikkelsen, and (from 1953) Clyde Lovellette\u2014won four of the first five league titles, establishing professional basketball\u2019s first dynasty.\n\nBritannica Quiz Basketball Quiz\n\nAttendance at Lakers games fell after Mikan\u2019s retirement in 1956, and the team moved to Los Angeles before the 1960\u201361 season. The Lakers advanced to the NBA finals six times in the 1960s but lost to the Celtics in each appearance despite the presence of all-time greats Elgin Baylor and Jerry West (who would later assemble a number of Lakers championship teams as the team\u2019s general manager). During the 1971\u201372 season, however, the Lakers\u2014led by West, Gail Goodrich, and Wilt Chamberlain\u2014set NBA records for longest winning streak (33 games) and best regular season record (69\u201313; broken in the 1995\u201396 season by the Chicago Bulls) on their way to the NBA championship, the team\u2019s first title since relocating to Los Angeles. The Lakers again reached the finals in 1972\u201373 but lost to the New York Knicks. After that season Chamberlain retired, and the team\u2019s fortunes took a turn for the worse as the Lakers missed the playoffs in consecutive seasons for the first time in franchise history in 1974\u201375 and 1975\u201376.\n\nThe Lakers entered the most dominant period in their franchise history when they selected Magic Johnson in the first overall pick of the 1979 NBA draft. Johnson teamed with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and (from 1982) James Worthy to take the Lakers to eight appearances in the NBA finals over the following decade, resulting in five NBA championships (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1988). This era became known as \u2018\u2018Showtime,\u201d not only for the flamboyant, often spectacular playing style orchestrated by Johnson and polished head coach Pat Riley but also for the courtside presence of Hollywood stars, most notably Jack Nicholson. Additionally, the renewed Lakers-Celtics rivalry\u2014the two teams facing off for the NBA title in 1984, 1985, and 1987 and, more specifically, Johnson\u2019s battles with Boston\u2019s Larry Bird\u2014propelled the NBA to new levels of popularity in the 1980s.\n\nAfter Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s retirement in 1989 and Johnson\u2019s in 1991, the Lakers\u2019 fortunes took a turn for the worse. The team still regularly made the playoffs\u2014the Lakers missed postseason play only five times in the team\u2019s first 60 seasons\u2014but failed to advance to the NBA finals for the longest period of time in team history. That changed during the 1999\u20132000 season, however, when newly hired head coach Phil Jackson guided the Lakers, featuring Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Kobe Bryant, to the first of three consecutive titles. O\u2019Neal was traded away in 2004, but a reconfigured Laker team with Bryant as the focal point advanced to the 2008 NBA finals, which they lost to Boston in six games. The Lakers returned to the finals the following season, where they routed the Orlando Magic in five games to capture the franchise\u2019s 15th championship. In the 2009\u201310 season the Lakers made their third consecutive finals appearance, where they defeated the Celtics in a dramatic seven-game series.\n\nThe Lakers then entered a period of a relative lack of success, which reached its nadir in 2012\u201313. The team added perennial All-Stars Steve Nash and Dwight Howard in the preseason and was considered one of the favourites to win the championship, but it muddled through an inconsistent and injury-plagued campaign that ended with the team\u2019s being swept out of the playoffs in the first round. Howard left in free agency in the off-season, and Bryant and Nash both missed most of the next season with injuries, which greatly contributed to the Lakers\u2019 posting a losing record in 2013\u201314. Bryant missed much of the following season with another injury, and the Lakers struggled to a 21\u201361 record. The team was even worse in 2015\u201316, going a franchise-worst 17\u201365 in Bryant\u2019s final season before his retirement.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Johnson helped lure superstar free agent LeBron James to the Lakers during the 2018 off-season, but the team failed to significantly improve, and Johnson abruptly resigned at the end of the 2018\u201319 season. The following season was tumultuous. In January 2020 Bryant was among those killed in a helicopter crash, and less than two months later the NBA suspended play due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In July the season resumed but with a shortened schedule and the players largely isolated in a \u201cbubble.\u201d Backed by the stellar play of James, who was named the finals MVP, the Lakers ultimately defeated the Miami Heat to win the NBA championship."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/sports/basketball/NBA-championship", "page_content": "NBA championship The table provides a chronological list of winners of the NBA championship.

On one side was Shaquille O'Neal, the gargantuan almost myth of a man, 7-foot-1 and some 330 pounds of pure power and force. And on the other side, there was Ben Wallace, nearly 100 pounds lighter and maybe not quite the 6-foot-9 he was listed at.\n\nThe ball went up and the 32-year-old O'Neal quick-jumped it, swiping the ball before it reached its apex. Over the next 90 seconds, three plays summarized the prevailing series narrative: the small-market, outmanned Detroit Pistons against the championship institution that is the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe Lakers, aiming for a fourth title in five years with their megawatt superteam full of star power and ring-hunting veterans, faced a Pistons squad full of outcasts and underdogs. It was Shaq and Kobe, plus Karl Malone and Gary Payton, led by the legendary Phil Jackson versus a collective of Chauncey Billups, Richard Hamilton, Rasheed Wallace and Ben Wallace led by famously title-less Larry Brown.\n\nThe Pistons opened the scoring 12 seconds in with a 3-pointer from Rasheed Wallace, set up on a sweet, free-flowing set with weakside screens and sharp cuts. The Lakers then took their first possession, hammering through a set that ended with Malone attempting his patented free throw line fadeaway, which bounced woefully short off the front iron. Carving out his territory in the paint, O'Neal then snared the ball from behind a leaping Ben Wallace, tossing the league's best rebounder aside, and opened the Lakers' account in the series with a dunk.\n\nTwo possessions later, with 10:28 left in the first quarter and the score 3-2, Hamilton turned the corner on Kobe Bryant and found Ben Wallace on the left wing, O'Neal sagging off dramatically to leave Wallace wide open for the pick-and-pop. Wallace hoisted the 12-foot jumper ... about 10 feet.\n\nAir ball.\n\n\"Rasheed is known for offense and defense,\" Al Michaels said on the broadcast. \"Ben is known for defense only.\"\n\nMichaels might've been right. Indeed, by June 2004, Wallace had won two NBA Defensive Player of the Year awards, led the league in rebounding twice, led it in blocks once and twice been on an All-Defensive team. He had become a household name, making the All-Star game in 2003 and 2004, establishing himself as a one-way superstar.\n\n\"Ben Wallace shooting an air ball doesn't bother the Pistons at all,\" Doc Rivers said to Michaels. \"They're not looking for his offense.\"\n\nThey were, however, making a mammoth bet on Wallace on the other end -- one that would make or break the 2004 Finals. One that few teams had dared tried before.\n\nDetroit had made the audacious decision to guard O'Neal, the three-time NBA champion, 11-time All-Star, straight up, one-on-one.\n\nAnd it worked. The Pistons' game plan suffocated the Lakers and reset the narrative of NBA championship criteria. At the center of it all was Ben Wallace, an undrafted center from a tiny town 30 miles west of Montgomery, Alabama, who, in five games over nine days, cemented a legacy destined for Springfield, Massachusetts. A player now set to be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on Saturday.\n\n\"He has to be the most unlikely Hall of Famer,\" says Billups, the now-Portland Trail Blazers coach who played with Wallace for four seasons. \"When you look at his life, his high school career, his college career and even his early years in the NBA, you never saw Hall of Fame. That never came across your thought process when you watched him.\"\n\nBut after Wallace neutralized the NBA's most unstoppable force in the stunning 2004 Finals, he wasn't just a novelty star anymore. He was destined for NBA immortality.\n\nComing into the 2004 NBA Finals, the Pistons set out to conduct the most audacious of experiments: guarding then-11-time All-Star Shaquille O'Neal one-on-one.

A decade removed from the Bad Boys era, with years of meandering mediocrity, it was this late spring day when the Pistons' road to championship contention truly opened.\n\nIt did so, however, with a trade that pundits saw as a major loss for the Pistons. They'd dealt a 27-year-old, five-time NBA All-Star in Grant Hill to the Orlando Magic, seemingly for pennies on the dollar, in a deal that netted them, in part, a one-dimensional, unproven, zero-time All-Star big man with only 113 career starts to his name.\n\nIn Ben Wallace's first season in Detroit, while he led the team to a dramatic rise in defensive aptitude, from the 21st to eighth, the Pistons won 10 fewer games than they did the season prior and missed the playoffs for the first time in four years.\n\nIn year two, the team sustained its defensive prowess, but this time, the wins came along with it. The Pistons won 18 more games, with Wallace as their anchor, despite just 7.6 points per game and a meager 10.5 usage rate. They'd lose to the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference semifinals, but Wallace's one-way dominance earned him the 2001 Defensive Player of the Year award, the first of four he would win in the next five seasons.\n\nIn his third season, help arrived -- in the form of three eventual starters on the 2004 title-winning team: Billups, Hamilton and a rookie named Tayshaun Prince.\n\n\"Ben didn't get the credit. Everybody gave me all the credit for being the leader of the team, and I was one of the leaders, but Ben, to me, set the culture before Rip and I got there,\" Billups says. \"It was on us to come in and just follow his blueprint. He didn't get the credit he deserved for that, because he's so quiet. But if you know, you know.\"\n\nDuring one of their first games together, early in the 2002-03 season, Billups remembers Wallace setting a screen for him and then rolling to the basket. Wallace was open for a pocket pass, Billups says now, so he flipped him a bounce pass. Wallace threw it immediately back to him.\n\nBillups was confused. Timeout. He didn't get it. Why wasn't Wallace trying to score?\n\n\"Nah, nah, nah,\" Wallace told him. \"You score. If I set a screen, and I set a good enough one, don't look at me. You go do what you gotta do. I'm gonna get my touches off the glass.\"\n\nThat was a new one for Billups.\n\n\"No, that's never happened. Hell no,\" Billups says. \"I've never had a guy tell me, 'When I set a screen, I'm rolling, but don't pass me the ball.' ... That was crazy to me.\"\n\nThe Pistons won 50 games for a second straight season and became a top-five defense. They were the Bad Boys reborn, with toughness, grit and selflessness serving as hallmarks. Wallace, who'd averaged a league-high 15.4 rebounds per game along with 3.2 blocks, won his second consecutive Defensive Player of the Year trophy. But the Pistons fell in the playoffs once again, this time in a sweep in Eastern Conference finals to the top defensive team in the league, Jason Kidd's New Jersey Nets.\n\nTwo hundred and seventy-one days later, the final member of the historic fivesome landed in Motown: Rasheed Wallace. The 2003-04 Pistons won 54 games and amassed the NBA's second-best defense, with no bona fide superstars. And their opportunity to validate the four-year journey came in the form of a Finals matchup against maybe the most star-studded team in NBA history.\n\nConventional wisdom at the time argued Ben Wallace was Dennis Rodman without the wild side or even a modern-day Bill Russell, a player focused solely on starring in his role. But his teammates point to his tactical prowess and uncanny instincts.\n\n\"You don't know how many players that I played with after playing with Ben, that I would put together edited tapes and examples of how to guard this, how to do this,\" Billups says. \"The list goes on forever of people that I've tried to show how to be more like Ben.\"\n\nAT ONE POINT during the 2004 Finals, Billups recalls Wallace needing new shoes. His size 13 AND1 sneakers had been ravaged, the insoles bursting out from within.\n\n\"Ben was fighting so hard that he blew through his shoe, trying to resist -- literally trying to resist Shaq backing down,\" Billups says. \"It was the craziest thing. He actually blew through his shoe.\"\n\nThe Pistons' defensive approach, guarding the unguardable O'Neal with a single man, wasn't only bold; it was quite literally the opposite of what Brown had wanted. The coach had preferred to go the traditional route, mixing double-teams and using the depth of the roster to take fouls when necessary.\n\n\"LB wanted to double-team Shaq, and Ben said, 'No, I'll guard him head-up,\" Hamilton told the Detroit Free Press in 2016. \"You don't hear that from anybody.\"\n\n\"There were so many signature moments in that series for him ... I think that for the world, that was his moment. For us, we already knew.\" Chauncey Billups, on Ben Wallace's performance in the 2004 NBA Finals\n\nBut that's not to say it was easy. Guarding O'Neal one-on-one is like solo tackling Marshawn Lynch. There were plenty of instances in the series when Wallace just couldn't hold up physically. Like in the third quarter of Game 1, when O'Neal used his ample backside to shield Wallace's feeble attempts at a steal, eventually tossing Wallace aside to throw down a two-handed dunk. Or in the first quarter of Game 2, when O'Neal backed Wallace onto the block, elbows sharpened and flying, spinning off his left shoulder to drop in an easy layup. Or in the second quarter of Game 3, when, despite good positioning and defense from Wallace, O'Neal bullied his way onto the block, missing his first shot but casting aside Wallace for a putback. Or in the third quarter of the decisive Game 5, when O'Neal bulldozed Wallace, sending him flying into the first row of seats, drawing an offensive foul in the process. Because, come on, this was still Shaq after all.\n\n\"We did a lot of things; we tried to play behind him, tried to force him off the block,\" Wallace said after Game 4, an eight-point Pistons win in which O'Neal still scored 36. \"That didn't work. We tried to front him; they threw it over the top. All you can do is just fight.\"\n\nAnd if you just look at O'Neal's raw numbers for the series -- 26.6 points on 63% shooting and 10.8 rebounds -- you might think he was his usual, dominant self.\n\nBut the impact of Wallace's series is told, simply, within the scoreboard. And it expands far beyond his single coverage of O'Neal. In Game 1, the Lakers scored 75 points. In Game 3, 68. In Game 4, 80. In Game 5, 87. For the series, the Lakers shot 41.6% from the floor, down from 45.4% during the regular season. Their offensive rating sank to 96.1, down from a sixth-ranked 105.5 for the season. Their 3-point percentage plummeted to 24.7%. They shot six fewer free throws per game. Almost across the board, the Pistons put the locks on.\n\nWithout a Bryant buzzer-beater that forced overtime in Game 2, the Pistons would've swept the Lakers.\n\n\"He was having to deal with that dude by himself. Two people can't guard Shaq, and we're asking one guy to do it, and a guy that's probably six inches shorter and a hundred pounds lighter,\" Billups says of Wallace. \"There were so many signature moments in that series for him. He was in an unbelievable rhythm. I think that for the world, that was his moment. For us, we already knew.\"\n\nWallace led the Pistons to a shocking five-game win in the 2004 Finals, with the Lakers' sixth-ranked offense short-circuiting from the relentless Detroit defense.

Wallace's offense took a jump too, as the big man averaged 10.8 points for the series to pair with his standard 13.6 rebounds per game. He produced flurries of momentum-swinging plays, like an open-court steal early in Game 5, devouring the floor to soar for a one-handed dunk; or a putback right over the top of Bryon Russell as an idle O'Neal stood nearby in the third quarter of Game 5 that gave Detroit a 14-point lead; or ripping down a one-handed defensive rebound in traffic over three Lakers in the first half of Game 3 that had sportscasters Michaels and Rivers roaring in admiration.\n\nFor every O'Neal dunk, there was Wallace standing him up, forcing a contested miss or a turnover. In Game 2, O'Neal didn't reach double-digit rebounds for the first time in his Finals' career. In Game 3, he didn't take a free throw until the fourth quarter. Wallace might not have won the box score battle, but he won the war.\n\nESPN Daily podcast Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen\n\n\"If there was one word for him, it's relentless,\" Billups says. \"He was not only relentless on the floor, which we all got the luxury of seeing and experiencing; but he was relentless in his pursuit to be great. Even deeper than that, he was relentless in his pursuit to change the trajectory of his family and where he's from.\"\n\nAs the Pistons assembled at midcourt at the Palace of Auburn Hills, with confetti falling from the rafters after Game 5, NBA commissioner David Stern picked up the Larry O'Brien Trophy to present to the franchise. He congratulated the city of Detroit and handed the hardware to then-team owner Bill Davidson. Davidson held the trophy for about all of two seconds, immediately looking to his right, handing it to Ben Wallace. Wallace took it and with both hands lifted it above his head.\n\n\"Throw your hands up!\" Wallace yelled to the adoring crowd. \"Throw your hands up!\"\n\nSays Billups, \"He just felt validated. Like we all did. He just felt like, 'What can they say about me now? I wasn't supposed to be here. I wasn't supposed to be a champion. I wasn't supposed to be an All-Star. I wasn't supposed to be any of these things. Now that we won it, what can they really say about me now?'\""}, {"url": "https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/10/15/21516580/lakers-title-retrospective-2000-kobe-bryant-shaquille-oneal-phil-jackson", "page_content": "The story of the Lakers\u2019 early 2000s three-peat can be told through the prisms of two people: Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Kobe Bryant. On the movie poster, they are the headliners, both agents of chaos and order, protagonists and, sometimes, antagonists. Likewise, years from now the story of the 2020 championship Lakers will be told through the team\u2019s two alphas\u2014LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Yet in both cases, the rotating characters that filled out the roster not only had front-row seats, but were crucial contributors, too.\n\nThe Lakers had a lot riding on the 1999-2000 season, with a newly installed Hall of Fame coach, outsized title expectations with Shaq and Kobe, and a new arena to boot. Given where the relationship of their star duo was headed, the rest of the ingredients needed to be near perfect or else the chemistry could have exploded in a flash. Twenty years later, the Lakers are back on top after winning the franchise\u2019s 17th title, and in some ways, the two teams share a thread. Led by two superstar figures, shouldering great expectations, and under the tutelage of a new coach, this year\u2019s Lakers also needed to nail the peripheral pieces to win it all. And they did.\n\nIt\u2019s now been 20 years since that first Shaq-and-Kobe title tipped off the 21st century, and once again the Lakers are starting a new decade with a ring. So to glean some insight into the challenges and triumphs of the season that started it all, I talked with Robert Horry and John Salley\u2014both of whom played supporting roles on the 2000 Lakers team, but whose previous experience on championship teams made them proper purveyors of what a title team was supposed to look like\u2014about the memories, moments, and stories that have stuck with them.\n\n1. The way Salley tells it, the wheels for the 1999-2000 title team were already in motion before the season even began. Salley recalls getting on the phone with Phil Jackson, his former coach with the Michael Jordan\u2013led Bulls and at the time a free agent, and talking to Jackson about what the Zen Master could do for a roster with Kobe and Shaq. In short: win a title, and maybe more than one. Jackson was surprised that Salley knew so much about the Lakers, given that he\u2019d been out of the league for the past three seasons. But Salley made his case to be a part of the team if Jackson got the job.\n\n\u201cI told Phil \u2018You\u2019re gonna need me on this team,\u2019\u201d Salley said. \u201cAnd he goes \u2018Are you in shape?\u2019 and I say, \u2018You know I stay in shape.\u2019\u201d\n\nSalley would go on to play a mere 303 total minutes that season, plus 78 minutes in the playoffs. He took up residence at the end of the bench, but his presence off the court as someone who had been there before and knew Jackson\u2019s coaching quirks was significant. (One time he had to be the one to ask Jackson to get Shaq some rest.) In the end, it was enough to make him the first player to win three titles with three teams.\n\n2. From the moment the Lakers convened for camp in Santa Barbara, Horry said Jackson \u201cbrought a sense of awareness to the team that they had to be on point.\u201d\n\nOne thing stood out to Salley: It seemed like Jackson had already convinced Shaq to buy in before even getting there. That season, Shaq showed up in shape rather than playing his way into it like the three previous years. And he wasn\u2019t the only one. \u201cShaq came in shape, Kobe came in shape,\u201d Horry said. \u201cEverybody came into camp in shape. And so that was the biggest key, when you come into camp, you\u2019re ready from day one. And I think everybody was ready.\u201d\n\nWhen Jackson addressed the team for the first time over breakfast, Shaq said he was committed to doing whatever Jackson asked. \u201cAnd if the big man does that,\u201d Salley said, \u201cthen everybody follows it too.\u201d\n\n3. Despite the already brewing dysfunction between Kobe and Shaq\u2014there was even a physical altercation between them during the 1998-99 lockout\u2014the Lakers had a noticeable freshness and fullness to them.\n\n\u201cEvery player does this, they don\u2019t want to admit it, but you look around the league, you know, you assess yourself,\u201d Horry said. As someone who had seen two title teams already and would be part of four more after 2000, Horry was particularly qualified. \u201cWhen I sat down and looked at that team and what we had, I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, we got a shooter, Glen Rice, Derek Fisher defense. Then Brian Shaw and Shaq worked really well in Orlando. AC [Green], myself and [Ron] Harper, the old heads of the team that won championships. OK, we have no weak points.\u2019 Then you look around the league and say, \u2018What team would give us trouble? They\u2019re not smart enough. They\u2019re too young. Or they\u2019re too old.\u2019 And I said, \u2018This is a perfect opportunity for us to do some damage.\u2019 And I thought what we could do, we actually did. It wasn\u2019t surprising to me.\u201d\n\n4. Jackson\u2019s approach to coaching the Lakers was nontraditional, to say the least. On one road trip during the season, Jackson decided to play a joke on his players. Literally. Following that night\u2019s game, Jackson made the players get on the bus and took them to a Gabriel Iglesias comedy show. According to Horry, the event and the chance to see teammates in a non-basketball environment loosened everybody up and set a positive tone.\n\n\u201cI think that was the one time when we really realized that we could hang out as a team,\u201d Horry said. \u201cI think when we realized that we got to be human beings first and just not live and die basketball, it became a better workplace for us and a better team.\u201d\n\n5. Beyond the team-bonding trip to a comedy club, Jackson also brought unconventional practices into the fold, like meditation before shootarounds, weekly yoga sessions, and book recommendations for players. \u201cThe guys thought they had to write a book report about it,\u201d Salley said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t read it, I went to Cliffnotes.com,\u201d Shaq said in 2016 of a book Jackson gave him by Friedrich Nietzsche. The following season, however, he did read the book recommendation\u2014Siddhartha, this time\u2014and actually did a book report on it.\n\nRelated The NBA Offseason Entrance Survey\n\nKobe, who was initially skeptical about meditation and the mental health sessions with George Mumford\u2014Jackson\u2019s mindfulness coach of choice\u2014said in Roland Lazenby\u2019s book, Showboat, that he came around to Jackson\u2019s emphasis on the mind.\n\n\u201cIt was good because it gave people a chance to talk about things that might be on their mind, the hype, the pressure,\u201d Kobe said in the book. \u201cI think it\u2019s good for them to talk about those things. It increased our performance a lot. It really has. I\u2019m surprised other teams don\u2019t do that kind of stuff. Working with George helps us to get issues out of the way before they even start.\u201d\n\n6. Horry recalls a particular oddity from a road game in Sacramento when Jackson brought in \u201csome kind of sage\u201d before the game as the players were getting ready, and he was putting crosses in front of everybody\u2019s locker. \u201cEverybody was like, \u2018What the hell is happening here?\u2019\u201d Horry says. \u201cSo I think that\u2019s the only thing that I don\u2019t think any coach in his world would ever do. Come in and try to get out all the demons.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a typical coach,\u201d Horry said. \u201cHe had his quirks and his ways of handling things, and he had to learn how to put up with us too. So it was a back-and-forth type of thing and went on.\u201d\n\n7. Yet nowhere were Phil\u2019s unique fingerprints more vivid than on the court, where he deployed his trademark triangle offense. At the beginning of camp, Jackson made it clear that this would be the way they would not just play, but win.\n\n\u201cPhil started off by saying the reason we\u2019re here is to win an NBA championship,\u201d Salley said. \u201cYou had to practice [the triangle] to win, and if you submit to this\u2014learning the offense\u2014this system will take us to championships.\u201d\n\nAs Salley recalls, Jackson made it clear: If you didn\u2019t know the triangle, you wouldn\u2019t play. Tex Winter (Jackson\u2019s assistant and one of the architects of the offense), Salley, and Ron Harper were the conduits for getting the rest of the Lakers to learn the triangle.\n\nThough this offense eventually formed Kobe into the player he became, the adjustment wasn\u2019t easy for him. Shaq called it out at the time by branding Kobe as selfish. And in Jackson\u2019s book The Last Season, Jackson wrote that Kobe was \u201cuncoachable.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wanted more freedom, and I wanted him to be more disciplined,\u201d Jackson said in a series of conversations with Charley Rosen on ESPN. \u201cBut when I came back for my second stint with the Lakers, Kobe and I worked it all out. I gave him more of a license to do his thing, as long as it stayed within the overall context of the triangle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like a wild horse that had the potential to become Secretariat, but who was just too fucking wild,\u201d Kobe said in a 2015 GQ piece. \u201cSo part of that was him trying to tame me. He\u2019s also very intelligent, and he understood the dynamic he had to deal with between me and Shaq. So he would take shots at me in the press, and I understood he was doing that in order to ingratiate himself to Shaq. And since I knew what he was doing, I felt like that was an insult to my intelligence.\u201d\n\n8. In Phil\u2019s world, the terminology for things as simple as a back screen was different, and so there was an acclimation process that was not unlike learning a new language. Still, even in the teaching process, there were more Jackson curveballs. Film sessions, according to Salley, often included movie interjections between studying play sets because Jackson believed one could concentrate for only 15 minutes at a time.\n\n\u201cGuys weren\u2019t understanding Phil, but at the end of the day they realized that we had been in there for two and a half hours,\u201d Salley said. \u201cHe would put things in our brain, watching what we were gonna do and talking it through, and the next thing you know a movie was playing. It\u2019s like \u2018What the fuck is happening?\u2019\u201d\n\n9. On a road trip while in Phoenix, Salley remembers Phil taking the team to the movies. The entire theater was rented out and the Lakers watched Gladiator. The near-three-hour movie concluded with a Jackson-led questionnaire:\n\nWhat was his sacrifice?\n\nWhat did he have to give up?\n\nHow did he stay focused?\n\n\u201cAnd then he goes, \u2018We\u2019re gladiators against everyone else,\u2019\u201d Salley said. \u201cAnd guys felt that way, felt like we were the warriors against everybody when we were in the pit.\u201d\n\n10. Jackson reenergized Shaq with the triangle offense, but he didn\u2019t mince words when discussing Shaq\u2019s biggest weakness on the floor.\n\n\u201cBecause of his free throw situation, he can\u2019t be the leader,\u201d Jackson said in a Sports Illustrated piece from November 1999. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to deliver in the clutch if you\u2019re going to be the leader, and if you can\u2019t make free throws \u2026 \u201c\n\nThe triangle, however, effectively turned Shaq\u2019s poor free throw shooting into a moot point and helped him to a near-unanimous MVP season: a league-high 29.7 points, 13.6 rebounds, and a career-high 3.8 assists per game. Shaq paced the Lakers during the regular season. He averaged exactly 40 minutes a game and fueled winning streaks of 16 games and 19 games as the Lakers went on to win 67 total.\n\nRelated The Biggest Threats to the Lakers Will Come From the Last Two Stars to Beat LeBron\n\n\u201cWhen you got a guy like Shaq, it wasn\u2019t about him trying to fit in,\u201d Horry said. \u201cIt\u2019s us, trying to make it work best for him.\u201d That understanding was essential to the Lakers\u2019 ensuing three-peat. They tried to cater to the best aspects of Shaq while Shaq became a willing participant in the process that was the triangle.\n\n\u201cHe was so humbled by Phil,\u201d Salley said. \u201cThat really got me, and he believed and trusted Phil was gonna get him the championships and he did.\u201d\n\n11. Salley didn\u2019t get much playing time during the season, but he was a focal point in practice, serving as one of the many bodies to put in front of Shaq. The perspective gave him insight into just how Shaq was exploiting the position the triangle placed him in.\n\n\u201cImagine that you\u2019re taking the most dominant player and you\u2019re making him into a screener,\u201d Salley said. \u201cShaq, he modified it by taking the one step forward and if the guard came off the top the big man would have to step to the top and bump him and Shaq would step to the basket. Even though that\u2019s not the play, it would give Shaq almost a dunk every time.\u201d\n\n12. As Salley puts it, the triangle made Shaq an impossible force to stop in one-on-one situations, but it also led to an evolution from opposing defenses: Enter Hack-a-Shaq. Horry contends that the Lakers never really worried about the strategy because Shaq was getting to the line so much that he only really needed to make about 50 percent of his free throws to be effective. Both Salley and Horry practiced free throws with Shaq, sometimes even on free weekends, and Horry even had his own ideas for how to help the big man.\n\n\u201cWe would play this game where you get one point if it hits the rim, two points if you hit all swish. And of course, we used to play this game up to 11 all the time,\u201d Horry says. \u201cAnd a lot of times when he went to the free throw line, you\u2019ll see me always walk up to him and talk to him. And I would always say \u2026 \u2018Man, we\u2019re in practice. Knock this down.\u2019\u201d\n\n13. Horry remembers the ice baths. They were short, 10 to 15 minutes long, but they were moments that forced stillness and, by default, conversation. After going at 100 miles per hour in practices as only Kobe could, the ice baths froze him in place, opening him up in ways that other settings did not. As they walked around the locker room before going home or ordered food, Horry listened and talked about everything and anything. And Kobe would join in, too.\n\n\u201cWe would talk about kids, cars, the night before the game or something that happened in practice that was funny, or how bad we hate Phil, or how much we love Phil or whatnot,\u201d Horry says. \u201cIt was those moments when we got to know each other, I think those are the moments where he allowed us to get to know him.\u201d\n\n14. Horry understood why Kobe was standoffish at times. The league at that time was not exactly ready and willing to embrace young players, especially not ones who went straight from high school to the pros at 18. And though Kobe contends he wasn\u2019t selfish, his brashness branded him as a polarizing figure.\n\n\u201cI knew what I could have done individually,\u201d he said in the 2015 GQ piece. \u201cI could have gone to another team and averaged 35 points a game. I could have gone anywhere and destroyed people. I gave that up to win championships. So it was infuriating to hear people say I was selfish. It was very, very maddening.\u201d\n\nBy the 1999-2000 season, Kobe was still only 21, and he\u2019d played with teammates in previous years who, Horry says, didn\u2019t fully embrace him. His youth still showed in many ways despite his talent.\n\nThe funniest manifestation of this was in the card games. Like any NBA team, the Lakers killed time on flights by playing a whole host of games. But while most guys would get in on the action and even Chick Hearn would stand and watch, Kobe wasn\u2019t really a participant, in part because he didn\u2019t know how to play.\n\n\u201cI was shocked that he didn\u2019t know how to play spades,\u201d Horry says. \u201cYou come from a Black family, you don\u2019t play spades? So it was weird because he was always trying to learn new things. And so he sat down, we taught him how to play spades.\u201d\n\n15. One trait that both Salley and Horry vividly remember about Kobe is his propensity to be a sponge for information, from spades to footwork. Salley, in particular, described Kobe as \u201cquiet and introverted,\u201d but when it came to wanting to improve, there was no one more committed or curious.\n\nRelated The Biggest Offseason Questions for the Lakers and Heat\n\nOn the road, Kobe made sure to have a VHS connector set up in his room, and Salley would often catch Kobe studying old tapes of players.\n\n\u201cI would sit there and watch like, \u2018How\u2019d you get the tape?\u2019\u201d Salley said. Kobe would respond: \u201c\u2018You know I got the hookup.\u2019 I don\u2019t know if he got them from the NBA or where, but he would have old game tape,\u201d Salley said. \u201cOf Chicago, of whomever. Mike, Magic. He would just watch as much as he could.\u201d\n\n16. While on a road trip in Miami, Salley remembers going out with Kobe, which was in itself a minor miracle because the youngster mostly kept to himself. But soon after midnight, Kobe told Salley he had to go back to the hotel. His trainer had flown in and they were going to work out at 6:30 a.m. the next day.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if people understood that a lot of his things were coming from him watching past players,\u201d Salley said. \u201cKobe always wanted a lot of competition. He is the second coming of Michael. This guy wanted to practice all the time, he wanted to scrimmage, he wanted to play one-on-one.\u201d\n\n17. But after breaking his wrist in preseason, Kobe had to wait until December to make his debut in the vaunted triangle offense. For an individualist who was already getting on his teammates\u2019 nerves with his commanding style of play, it ended up being the perfect scenario. For the first two months of the season, Kobe saw the Lakers thrive without him in the new offense, and it created pressure on him to fit in and perform when he returned.\n\n\u201cIt was a good time for him to learn, watching it, and it was a good time for everybody to realize that you had to up your game until Kobe came back,\u201d Salley says.\n\nKobe still went on to have an All-Star season, averaging 22.5 points per game. But even as Kobe rapidly ascended, it was still Shaq\u2019s team. And even though trouble eventually lay ahead, the Kobe-Shaq duo was now a proven commodity on the court.\n\n18. The Lakers\u2019 cast of characters ended up being the perfect mix to put alongside Kobe, Shaq, and Jackson. Whether from a basketball perspective or a relationship one, everyone filled their role and did their part throughout the season.\n\n\u201cIt was, if everybody does their job you win, and it\u2019s just like there\u2019s no weak link,\u201d Salley said. \u201cI remember Derek Fisher being a man among boys. I couldn\u2019t believe how mature he was. Ron Harper was the other veteran, Brian Shaw, Rick Fox, Glen Rice, Robert Horry, these are guys who had played and understood what the focus was. The real big guy was A.C. Green, coming from a system with Magic and those guys, and being able to pick up the offense and really play it spot on. So I mean there were no weaknesses.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Ron Harper] was the one that was quarterbacking everything,\u201d Horry said. In Roland Lazenby\u2019s book The Show, Harper was also credited with helping the Kobe-Shaq relationship survive its toughest times. \u201cAnd when things got frustrating, he was the one that would talk to guys, tell him what Phil\u2019s philosophy was, his way of thinking,\u201d Lazenby wrote. \u201cRon was that guy that nobody ever talks about, that kept everybody together, kept everybody doing things the Phil way, sort of thing.\u201d\n\n19. Horry, who stayed on with the Lakers for their eventual three-peat, can recognize now that not only was this the honeymoon year for the squad, but it was the most fun he had on any of the seven championship teams he was a part of.\n\n\u201cEverything on the court was fun,\u201d Horry said. \u201cOur road presence was good. We all hung out. We went to dinner together. We talked, we had fun on the bus ... this one was just when everybody was just relatable, having a good time. We\u2019re all the same age, it was just a fun time. And plus who doesn\u2019t have fun in L.A.?\u201d\n\nSalley added that it helped that most of the players were around the same age. It meant bigger dinner groups to random places like P.F. Changs, it meant guys could get along off the court if they wanted to and it seemed like \u201ceverything fit.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we had smart guys,\u201d Horry says. \u201cWe had guys who could adapt. We had guys who could learn on the fly.\u201d\n\n20. With a new head coach, learning on the fly was the only way the Lakers were going to win the title. And adjusting on the fly was also what got them over their biggest hurdles. Shaq\u2019s free throw shooting problems nearly sunk them in the Western Conference finals, when the Blazers took to hacking Shaq and putting him at the free throw line 14 times per game. The result was a hard-fought seven-game series that culminated in a memorable Game 7 when the Lakers were down double digits in the fourth and on the edge of failure.\n\n\u201cThe focus, [we] had it, but that whole Hack-a-Shaq shit against Portland was really dampening,\u201d Salley says.\n\n\u201cWe started getting mad,\u201d O\u2019Neal said in Jeff Pearlman\u2019s book, Three Ring Circus. \u201cKobe was mad, B-Shaw was mad. That\u2019s exactly what we needed: that anger. That was the one time all year when they really saved my ass, because I was getting quadruple-teamed and playing like shit. I needed help in the worst way.\u201d\n\nWith the Lakers down 13, Salley recalls a timeout when he encouraged his teammates to shoot 3s because of how the Blazers were playing Shaq. Horry and Shaw delivered immediately, Shaq started making his free throws, and the Lakers delivered the final blow with the most iconic play of the franchise\u2019s era:\n\n\u201cI watched Steve Smith be so upset,\u201d Salley said with a laugh. \u201cAnd I watched Rasheed Wallace look at his teammates like they were crazy. I knew that was it.\u201d\n\nThe dagger would be etched in Lakers\u2019 lore, and the series would end with the Lakers on top. They would go on to beat the Pacers in the Finals, and so began the three-peat."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31436134/los-angeles-lakers-unveil-2020-nba-championship-banner-fans-hand-celebrate", "page_content": "LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Lakers finally unveiled the franchise's 17th NBA championship banner at Staples Center on Wednesday night, and LeBron James used the occasion to set his sights on No. 18.\n\n\"We said we would not unveil this banner until we had some of you guys in the seats, so this is your guys' moment,\" James said, speaking into a microphone at center court before L.A.'s 124-122 win over the Houston Rockets. \"We had our ring night; we wanted you guys there, but we wanted to make sure we saved the banner for y'all.\n\n\"So, we love you guys, and the road to back-to-back starts in about a week. So, let's get going.\"\n\nThe win over Houston kept L.A.'s hopes alive of avoiding the play-in tournament, where they would need to fend off the likes of the supernova that is Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors, or perhaps the upstart Memphis Grizzlies led by Ja Morant or James' old Finals nemesis, Gregg Popovich and the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nIf the Lakers go 2-0 to finish the season in their road back-to-back this weekend against the Indiana Pacers and New Orleans Pelicans and either the Portland Trail Blazers finish 0-2 at Phoenix and vs. Denver or the Dallas Mavericks go 0-2 vs. Toronto and at Minnesota, L.A. will enter the playoffs as the No. 6 seed. If the Blazers and Mavs both finish 0-2, the Lakers will be the No. 5 seed.\n\nLakers coach Frank Vogel said before the game that it's possible he'll have his roster fully healthy and available for just the second time this season come Saturday's game in Indiana.\n\n\"Obviously it's exciting to get everybody back, get our team back fully healthy,\" said Wesley Matthews, who helped preserve the win over Houston with a late defensive strip on Kelly Olynyk. \"And from there, we're going to see where we are.\"\n\nThe Lakers unveiled the franchise's 17th championship banner on Wednesday night at Staples Center. Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMatthews, who signed with L.A. as a free agent in the offseason, was nowhere to be found during the banner ceremony, staying back in the locker room to pray.\n\n\"That was something that I felt was for them,\" he said. \"And me, my fire burns, my hunger burns to raise another banner.\"\n\nNearly five months ago, the Lakers had a traditional ring ceremony on opening night of the 2020-21 season in December but held off on revealing the championship banner until L.A. County's COVID-19 restrictions lessened, so fans would be allowed in the building.\n\nApproximately 4,000 fans attended Wednesday's game, according to a Lakers spokesperson, which is far fewer than Staples Center's 19,000 capacity for Lakers games but also more than double the 1,915 fans present on April 15 against the Boston Celtics -- the first game fans were allowed back.\n\nJames shared center court with Lakers governor Jeanie Buss. Resting on a table between them was the Larry O'Brien Trophy from the team's 2020 title won in the NBA bubble in Orlando, Florida.\n\n\"We've waited until now because our banners have always been about our fans,\" Buss said. \"It's so good to hear you guys together and be together as family again. We've been awarded our trophy; the players have their rings. Our final piece of business to commemorate our 2020 NBA championship is to honor our fans with the banner.\"\n\nThe Lakers hope to continue to increase attendance capacity in the postseason while working with state and local coronavirus guidelines, according to a team spokesperson.\n\nJames, missing his sixth straight game because of a high right ankle sprain, addressed the crowd while wearing a baseball-style hat, dark green shorts and a black sweatshirt. When he was finished speaking, Lakers longtime public address announcer Lawrence Tanter counted down, \"3-2-1,\" and the black cloak featuring the message \"Stay Tuned, Lakers Family\" that had been covering the championship banner since opening night was removed.\n\nQueen's \"We Are the Champions\" blared through the arena's sound system to accompany the moment.\n\nAnthony Davis, also in street clothes and out for the game because of tightness in his groin, then took the mic to finish off the pregame ceremony.\n\n\"What a feeling,\" Davis said. \"I never thought that I would be hanging one of these banners, man. And it's all because of you guys. All because of you, your continued support for me, my teammates, the coaching staff.\n\n\"Before the hiatus, when you guys were allowed in the building. Even when we went to the bubble, every night we'd come in, and see on the screen you guys cheering for us. And that means a lot to us. And without you guys, we wouldn't be able to raise this banner or have this trophy behind us.\n\n\"So I appreciate you guys, and like Bron said, let's get it going and try to repeat.\"\n\nIt's still undetermined how much James and Davis will play this weekend, or if Dennis Schroder will be cleared from the league's health and safety protocols, or if Alex Caruso's sore right foot will feel well enough to join them.\n\nBut riding a three-game winning streak, the Lakers sound like they're looking forward to how it all plays out next -- play-in, playoffs, whatever.\n\n\"Honestly, it's damn fun,\" said Kyle Kuzma. \"Honestly. For us, the season has been a challenge. We've had rotatable parts, people in, people out, people in COVID protocols, people not healthy enough to play. We've all had to figure it out on the fly. ... I think we'll be alright.\""}]}
