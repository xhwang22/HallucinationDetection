I hung out in the trailer with Danny [Aykroyd] and Belushi and they decided they had a scene for me in the movie. So that's how that happened.\n\nBy that time, John and I had been friends for a while. I met Belushi on the road in Chicago. He came to an Eagles concert. He showed up in my room and didn't leave for two days. He wanted to show me how cool Chicago was, and he took me out to the finest restaurant. There's a whole story with that with how they wouldn't let us in because of the way we were dressed. So we went and spray painted our jeans black and went back. Then we did about $28,000 worth of damage to my hotel room.\n\nWhen the Eagles stopped in 1980 \u2026 I kept going. I didn't really want to admit it had ended, so I just kept the same mentality and lifestyle. And the way I wound up was that the only thing that mattered to me was not running out of cocaine. And also vodka. Vodka, cocaine and Camel Light cigarettes. Those three things.\n\nGradually, I stopped writing music and I stopped taking care of myself. I burned bridges. I was not dependable. I didn't make any sense a lot of the time. Musicians didn't really care to work with me anymore. I had an \"I don't care about anything\" attitude. My day \u2013 and it was really hard work \u2013 was spent trying to find a dealer who would front me some cocaine when I still owed him for the last batch. And if I was awake, I was drinking. I was just empty. I was godless and I took it about as far as a I could go. And I'd seen buddies go away. Keith Moon took it all the way. Belushi, he had gotten sober. And I helped him do it. He said, \"Look, I gotta quit. Do you know a sober companion?\" I said, \"Yeah, I know somebody. But you're gonna hate me for getting him for you and you're gonna hate him. But he'll get you clean.\" And John was doing great. Then he fell off the wagon, and on and on."}, {"url": "https://ultimateclassicrock.com/joe-walsh-but-seriously-folks/", "page_content": "Joe Walsh's fourth album, ... But Seriously Folks, is best known for producing the hit single \"Life's Been Good.\" But that's just the most obvious starting point of a record that proved to be one of Walsh's most durable LPs.\n\nComparisons to the Eagles for the album came early and often \u2013 and not just because this was the first stand-alone project Walsh released after he joined the group before 1976's Hotel California. All four of his bandmates appeared on ... But Seriously Folks, though they're mere footnotes on an album that strikes a more considered balance of introspection and biting wit, and of smart balladry and tough rockers, than the reconstituted Eagles' deflating finale The Long Run.\n\nWalsh moves with cunning and verve through the expected joys of country rockers like \"Second Hand Store\" and the surprising reggae rhythms of \"Over and Over,\" from the incisive nostalgia of \"Indian Summer\" to the fully realized instrumental wit of \"Theme From Boat Weirdos.\"\n\nEven casual fans will notice signature elements of the Eagles sound throughout, from the soaring background vocals of Glenn Frey, Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmit on \"Tomorrow\" to Don Felder's pedal steel on \"Second Hand Store.\" Walsh and Felder then reanimate their twin-guitar \"Hotel California\" entanglement on \"At the Station.\"\n\nListen to Joe Walsh's 'Life's Been Good'\n\nStill, ... But Seriously Folks arrived on May 16, 1978, as a Walsh record at its core, dominated not by the Eagles but by his vision. Don't let the winks and nudges fool you. As with Walsh's other must-buy solo album, The Smoker You Drink, the Player You Get, he's in complete command of his muse, something that becomes utterly clear on the hilarious album closer \"Life's Been Good.\"\n\nA comic depiction of the \"hardships\" of rock stardom, the song appeared on ... But Seriously Folks not in the zippy four-minute version that went to No. 12 on the pop chart but as an extended anthem of double that length.\n\nAlong the way, it earned fame separate from the charts when Walsh ran for president in 1980 as a lark. He suggested, tongue firmly in cheek, that \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" be replaced by \"Life's Been Good.\" That didn't happen. But it certainly became Walsh's personal good-time anthem \u2013 and a staple of his concerts, with and without the Eagles.\n\nMany fans understandably listen to ... But Seriously Folks decades later to relive that moment in time. But there's an entire album's worth of Walsh to enjoy here.\n\nEagles Solo Albums Ranked Here's a look back at studio projects recorded away from the band.\n\nHow a Drug Dealer Inspired Eagles' 'Life in the Fast Lane'"}, {"url": "https://www.grunge.com/439605/the-untold-truth-of-joe-walsh/", "page_content": "Notice the quotes above, and take note that we're not referring to the James Gang, which would come a few years later. Back in the mid-'60s, the Measles (we're guessing they chose the name because it rhymes with \"Beatles\") was a band of Kent State University students that featured Joe Walsh on vocals and guitar. After developing a reputation in the area as an up-and-coming bar band, they started working on original songs, including the Walsh-penned \"I Find I Think of You\" and \"And It's True,\" the latter of which was composed by bassist Bobby Sepulveda, according to Buckeye Beat.\n\nWhat makes this interesting is the fact that those two songs appeared on the Ohio Express' 1967 debut album \"Beg, Borrow and Steal,\" whose title track peaked at No. 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 that same year, per Songfacts. The Ohio Express was not as much a traditional band as it was the name producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz used for the songs they released from various bands and musicians, the Measles included. In fact, the song \"Beg, Borrow and Steal\" was actually performed by a group called the Rare Breed, while Kasenetz and Katz had a totally different band go on tour as the Ohio Express and record at least some of the other songs on the album.\n\nThe Ohio Express' history is a confusing one, to be sure, but for a brief moment, that history included a future guitar legend and one of his first-ever compositions."}, {"url": "https://ultimateclassicrock.com/joe-walsh-got-any-gum/", "page_content": "The late '80s were a challenging period for classic rockers: Could they remain relevant and maintain their levels of success, born of moments six or eight or 10 years before, when they were topping the charts and regularly packing arenas? Many were staring down their 40s, if not meekly entering them, crossing a threshold that at one time was impossible to fathom. Rock was a young person's game, a music of rebellion and reaction to those of a certain, older set.\n\nJoe Walsh was among this aging rock-star demographic, turning 40 in 1987. He dealt with his age and the expectations of a rock audience by both indulging in a debilitating drinking habit, while embracing then-current keyboard-heavy sounds on the solo album he released that year, Got Any Gum?\n\nThe bulk of the project was recorded at Memphis' renowned Ardent Studios, where producer Terry Manning preferred to work. Walsh liked Studio A in the facility, according to studio manager Jody Stephens, who initially rose to fame as Big Star's drummer. The room \"has huge baffles so that you can really damp things down to where it's almost a '70s studio,\" Stephens later told Goldmine. Others who have made albums there include the Allman Brothers Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Robert Cray.\n\nDrummer Chad Cromwell, a session musician and would go on to play with everyone from Neil Young and Mark Knopfler to Michael Bolton and Jessica Simpson, remembers how he got asked to play on Got Any Gum? It all started, in typical fashion, during a messy gig with Walsh.\n\n\"I met Joe at a recording studio in Memphis where I worked a lot and did a lot of sessions,\" Cromwell told Rolling Stone. \"When Joe came into town, he just came over and there was some sort of party going on. I was introduced to Joe. That was one of the strangest things because we just stayed up all night, acting like idiots, as everyone would do in the mid-'80s.\"\n\nWalsh asked Cromwell to accompany him to Dallas, where they would rehearse for a week with bassist Rick Rosas before playing a radio station-sponsored festival concert in Los Angeles. Cromwell agreed, but the week went by and no rehearsals happened. \"We get on a plane [at the end of the week] and fly to L.A.,\" Cromwell recalled. \"We get off the plane and literally get in a car and drive out to [the venue]. There are 20,000 people at this venue and I am shitting myself since I still haven't rehearsed with Joe and Rick.\n\n\"I remember walking onstage,\" he added, \"going, 'Okay! I'm probably going to be put on a plane home after this is over with, but fuck it. If he doesn't want to rehearse, I'm just going with it, with him. I'll see what happens.'\"\n\nListen to Joe Walsh Perform 'In My Car'\n\nA few missteps aside, the gig went well, and Cromwell became Walsh's first-call drummer when he went back to Memphis to record Got Any Gum? at Ardent. Cromwell was intrigued by working with Manning, who had provided the drum programming and synthesizer work on Eliminator \u2013 the 1983 LP that brought the rough-edged ZZ Top a whole new sound, and a big hit record.\n\n\"Terry was pretty big on whatever the latest, coolest piece of gear would be at the time,\" Cromwell told Rolling Stone. \"There was a company called AMS \u2013 they made a gated reverb box and then a delay box that probably is most well known as the drum sound on 'In the Air Tonight' by Phil Collins. Same gear, same box.\n\n\"If you listen to Got Any Gum?, you're going to hear the same thing,\" Cromwell added. \"I remember thinking at the time, 'This is the most incredible drum sound I've ever heard in my life.' I wasn't really thinking about how dated that would sound 10 years later.\"\n\nThe drum work wasn't the only quintessentially '80s sound on Got Any Gum? as the preponderance of synthesizers and compression led to an overall thin audio quality. That was, of course, somewhat typical for the era \u2013 but not for Walsh. For perhaps the first time, it sounded like his guitar was fighting to be heard over the patches and plastic. Got Any Gum? was about as far as one could imagine Walsh getting from the sound he'd all but patented since the first James Gang record decades earlier.\n\nWalsh saw it differently. \"What I'm really trying to do is get back to that young, aggressive feeling,\" he told the Sun-Sentinel while on a supporting tour. \"I'm full circle from being young and curious in the James Gang, going through development as an artist in the Eagles. I want to get back to what it was.\"\n\nOpinions are split on whether Walsh's curiosity actually resulted in a good record. There are certainly some intriguing songs to pick through, dated production and all.\n\n\"In My Car\" was co-written with Ringo Starr and originally appeared on Starr's 1983 album Old Wave, with Walsh co-producing and playing lead guitar. The big keyboard sound on Walsh's cover sounds like it should be on a soundtrack to an '80s high-school movie \u2013 though the keyboards are underpinned by an acoustic guitar, and Walsh plays a tasty solo in the middle of the song.\n\nListen to Joe Walsh Perform 'The Radio Song'\n\nOne of the few tracks on Got Any Gum? that got any traction was \"The Radio Song,\" which was a minor hit at rock radio, hitting No. 8 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. It's a pretty simple song about the pleasures of listening to music, with a chorus that's a winner, and some insistent guitar work that cuts through the atmospheric synthesizers, however briefly.\n\nComing in late on the record is \"Memory Lane,\" a touching ballad cut from a similar fabric as \"Pretty Maids All in a Row,\" Walsh's contribution to the Eagles' Hotel California. It's a heavy sentiment, on the power of looking back, and how memories can pull us out into \"faraway places and long ago names.\"\n\n\"Fun\" is perhaps the cut that sounds most like classic Joe Walsh from Got Any Gum? It's got a guitar sound right out of \"Rocky Mountain Way\" and \"Funk #49,\" with cannon-shot drums and an unfettered Walsh vocal. All the hard-rock noise is given purpose as he implores the listener to have a good time \u2013 while also noting how good a time Walsh is also having. How this didn't crack rock radio like \"The Radio Song\" did is a mystery.\n\nUnfortunately, few people embraced Got Any Gum? Released on Oct. 29, 1987, the LP was a critical dud. (The Los Angeles Times, in a typical comment, described it as a \"monumental flop.\"). Got Any Gum? was a commercial disappointment as well, topping out at No. 113 on the Billboard album chart.\n\nWalsh was still a sizable live draw, but his physical condition was becoming a concern. Supporting the record at the end of 1987 and into 1988, Walsh began to show the effects of his issues with alcohol. Carter Alan, a writer and longtime disc jockey in the New England area, saw it firsthand when he served as emcee at a Walsh show in New Hampshire.\n\n\"What was tragic,\" Alan said in his book Decibel Diaries: A Story of Rock in 50 Concerts, \"was the extent to which Joe Walsh's drinking had crippled his ability to play. I almost cried as he fumbled the solo to 'Life in the Fast Lane,' unable to replicate or even approach the mastery of his original studio performance. While Walsh's fingers responded clumsily, as if operated by an inept puppeteer hidden in the rafters above, several extended episodes of slurry rhetoric at the microphone replaced much of the music.\"\n\nListen to Joe Walsh Perform 'Fun'\n\nWalsh's promotional appearances on television shows like Late Night with David Letterman and The Arsenio Hall Show were shambolic, with sloppy performances followed by uncomfortable interview segments between the hosts and a visibly impaired Walsh.\n\nOn Hall's show, Walsh accused the host (a fellow Cleveland native) of stealing his hubcaps, before degenerating even further into a drunken announcement of his candidacy for president. He'd also done so in 1980, to great comic effect, but repeating the joke while slurring his words on national television in 1987 was not so funny.\n\nIt took the 1994 Eagles reunion to get Walsh to rehab \u2013 and he says he's remained sober to this day. Chad Cromwell remembers the circumstances that led Walsh to get help. Cromwell was having dinner with a friend in a restaurant in Hollywood when Walsh, fresh from a meeting with his Eagles bandmates, showed up and approached their table.\n\n\"He looked straight at us and said, 'They won't let me in the band if I don't go to rehab. I gotta go to rehab,'\" Cromwell told Rolling Stone. \"He was just a wreck. It was heartbreaking. He was in such bad shape. The next morning, he went to rehab. He has been sober ever since.\"\n\nWalsh's fortitude is the likeliest reason he has remained sober, but Cromwell also credits others for compelling him to get in that condition. \"The Eagles definitely saved his life,\" Cromwell added. \"No question about it.\"\n\nCombining sobriety and the life of a working musician was no easy task, Walsh admitted in a 2012 talk with Interview. \"It wasn't like you flick a switch, and you're sober,\" he said. \"It takes a while. You have to learn how to do everything all over again. You can measure how long that takes in terms of years.\n\n\"What I didn't know at the time was how to write music and do rock 'n' roll and live rock 'n' roll and record sober,\" Walsh added. \"I didn't try to do that at first. I learned how to take care of myself and then play in front of people. I didn't tackle going back to rock 'n' roll until I had some sobriety under my belt.\"\n\nThe Most Awesome Live Album From Every Rock Legend Some of these concert recordings sold millions of copies, while others received little fanfare.

I didn\u2019t have anybody to throw a ball with or pick up as a role model.

And it makes me uneasy, because that\u2019s back. And I thought we were over that.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\nWalsh famously ran for President of the United States in 1980, when he pledged to make his hit \u201cLife\u2019s Been Good\u201d the national anthem. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be good before a football game?\u201d he jokes. \u201cI would have had a lot more fun than Trump.
