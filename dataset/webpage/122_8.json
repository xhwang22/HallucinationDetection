the evolving role of the US on the global stage, hybrid attacks against the EU Member States, such as the instrumentalisation of migrants, aimed at challenging our democratic foundations; the continuous breach of international law by Belarus; the increasing assertiveness of the Chinese Communist Party and other authoritarian and totalitarian regimes; the recent rapid collapse of the state structures of Afghanistan and subsequent takeover of the country by the Taliban; the tensions in the Indo-Pacific, especially in the South and East China Seas as well as in the Taiwan Strait; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; the questioning of arms control agreements; climate change; financial crimes; the aggravation of regional conflicts that have generated population displacement; competition for natural resources; energy and water scarcity; failed states; terrorism; organised transnational crime; cyberattacks; and disinformation campaigns;\n\nD. whereas these existing trends are the result of shifts in the global balance of power towards a multipolar world of heightened geopolitical competition, which is making global governance and the provision of international public goods more difficult at a time when these are increasingly needed;\n\nE. whereas the world has entered in a new era of \u2018unpeace\u2019, a time of growing geopolitical uncertainty with multiplying regional conflicts and great power competition with significant implications for the security of the EU;\n\nF. whereas the detrimental impact of climate change on the security of the EU is becoming increasingly clear;\n\nG. whereas more than half of the world\u2019s population growth by 2050 is expected to occur in Africa, which is expected to account for 1.3 billion of the additional 2.4 billion people on the planet; whereas the concentration of this growth in some of the poorest countries together with the effects of climate change will lead to a series of new challenges which, if not addressed immediately, will have extremely problematic effects both for the countries in question and for the EU; whereas the UN Conference on Trade and Development\u2019s 2019 report on trade and development[3] figures an additional USD 2.5 trillion will be needed annually to reach the commitments of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development;\n\nH. whereas the EU needs to act on the global stage with one coherent voice rooted in a common strategic culture to develop its leadership role and revive and reform multilateralism guided by its values of democracy, rule of law, social justice, fundamental rights including gender equality and support for freedom globally, and its vision for a sustainable and inclusive future;\n\nI. whereas a broad majority of EU citizens and the comments received so far on the digital platform of the Conference on the Future of Europe support a stronger role for the EU and a common European approach in matters of foreign and security policy, and wish to see a more coherent and effective EU foreign and security policy;\n\n1. Highlights that in order to achieve the strategic objective of developing its global leadership role, the EU should shape its CFSP on the basis of the following five actions:\n\n\u0096 taking the lead in strengthening multilateral partnerships on global priorities, in particular its partnership with the UN, and in protecting and promoting democracy and human rights globally,\n\n\u0096 improving EU visibility and decision-making, and making full and more effective use of the EU\u2019s hard and soft power instruments, including by introducing qualified majority voting for decision-making in EU foreign policy,\n\n\u0096 achieving European sovereignty by coherently interlinking the EU\u2019s external and internal actions, combining the ability to act autonomously if needed with the readiness to pursue strategic solidarity with like-minded partners,\n\n\u0096 further developing regional strategies, including diplomatic and economic engagement and security cooperation,\n\n\u0096 strengthening democratic oversight, scrutiny and accountability, and the parliamentary dimension of the EU\u2019s CFSP;\n\nTaking the lead in strengthening multilateral partnerships on global priorities, in particular its partnership with the UN, and in protecting and promoting democracy and human rights globally\n\n2. Welcomes the EU\u2019s growing ambition and initiatives to take the lead in promoting global partnerships on key priorities and in strengthening the rules- and value-based multilateral order through a reform of key institutions and organisations in order to improve their efficiency and increase their resilience and through better use of existing mechanisms and institutions for multilateral global governance; notes that these initiatives make it possible for the international community, governed by international law, to effectively deal with global challenges such as climate change, pandemics, the energy crisis and terrorist threats, and to fight against the influence of malign authoritarian actors; reiterates that the EU\u2019s foreign and security policy must ensure the implementation of the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs);\n\n3. Stresses the need to develop a truly strategic partnership between the EU and the UN on climate action and human rights and in the context of crisis management; calls on the Member States and on governments worldwide to attribute more competences, resources and capacity of intervention to UN bodies; regrets the fact that China and Russia prevent the UN Security Council from condemning oppressive regimes for their actions, hamper a united international response to different crises, and prevent implementation of G7 decisions at UN level; reiterates its strong support for the International Criminal Court (ICC) and calls on the EU and the Member States to provide adequate financial support to enable the ICC to carry out its tasks;\n\n4. Highlights the need for the EU to defend and promote democracy globally by leading by example, including by ensuring strict compliance with the principles of democracy, human rights and rule of law in all Member States; calls for the EU to promote an alliance of democracies worldwide; insists on the need to pool resources, exchange best practices, coordinate common actions and develop shared strategies as regards countering malign interference and disinformation by authoritarian states and their proxies, hostile non-state actors and organisations, and anti-democratic actors within democratic societies; believes that, for this to be successful, the EU and its Member States should promote, through close cooperation with NATO among others, a whole-of-government and a whole-of-society approach to countering hybrid threats, combined with an ambitious democracy support agenda focusing on the preservation and promotion of freedom of speech and media independence; expresses, in this regard, its full support for the Summits for Democracy hosted by the US, which are focusing on concrete actions to defend universal human rights, prevent democratic backsliding and fight corruption;\n\n5. Calls for the EU to develop its toolbox for countering foreign interference, propaganda and influence operations, including developing new instruments that allow costs to be imposed on perpetrators and strengthening relevant structures, specifically the European External Action Service (EEAS) strategic communication taskforces; welcomes the ongoing revision of the Commission\u2019s Code of Practice on Disinformation; stresses the need for the EU to increase the visibility of its actions through a better, more strategic communication of its external actions towards its own citizens and beyond;\n\n6. Is deeply concerned by the continuous democratic backsliding and human rights setbacks in an increasing number of non-EU countries, including attacks against political rights and electoral integrity; reaffirms the importance of the EU\u2019s continuous support for electoral processes in the world by means of election observation missions, among others, and recalls the fundamental role of Parliament in this regard; stresses the importance of ensuring the highest level of protection for domestic electoral observers; calls for the EU to further strengthen its cooperation on election observation with all relevant partners such as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe and the endorsing organisations of the Declaration of Principles for International Election Observations and Code Of Conduct for International Election Observers;\n\n7. Encourages the EU to further develop its leadership role in the defence and promotion of freedom, democracy and human rights in multilateral forums, and in particular the UN; believes that the EU should ensure a transparent and effective use of the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime (GHRSR) (EU Magnitsky Act), including by expanding the scope of the GHRSR to include corruption-related offences; reiterates that the EU should better enforce the human rights provisions of the international agreements it has concluded; recalls the political nature of the EU GHRSR, which is part of the EU\u2019s integrated and comprehensive policy approach;\n\n8. Insists on the full implementation and systematic integration of gender mainstreaming and the EU gender action plan III (GAP III) in all EU external action, at all levels of engagement and in all relevant activities and concepts, including beyond the lifetime of the GAP III; calls for the EU and the Member States to exercise leadership in the implementation of UN Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security;\n\n9. Calls for the effective implementation of the 2020 EU Peace Mediation Concept to consolidate the EU\u2019s position as an influential global actor that invests in conflict prevention and mediation, and as a leading actor in the promotion and implementation of peace at international level; recalls the EU\u2019s comparative advantage in the area of conflict prevention and resolution vis-\u00e0-vis individual Member States; underscores the key role played by Parliament in this area through parliamentary diplomacy; recognises the role of youth organisations in building peaceful societies, and in promoting a culture of peace, tolerance and intercultural and interreligious dialogue;\n\n10. Reiterates its call for increased support for the EU maritime security strategy, as maintaining freedom of navigation presents a growing challenge both globally and for the neighbourhood; underlines that freedom of navigation should be respected at all times; calls for the EU to put more focus on ensuring freedom of navigation and on measures focusing on de-escalation and prevention of armed conflict and military incidents at sea;\n\n11. Calls for an ambitious EU agenda, in cooperation with key partners, on supporting freedom of religion or belief outside the EU and raising the issue of persecution on the grounds of religion or belief; notes that supporting freedom of religion or belief contributes to fostering durable peace and therefore to addressing many of the challenges faced by the EU and its partner countries; urges the Commission to appoint, as soon as possible, a new EU Special Envoy for the promotion of freedom of religion or belief;\n\n12. Welcomes the EU\u2019s efforts as a global frontrunner in the fight against climate change and urges the Commission and the EEAS to propose new initiatives such as the internationalisation of the European Green Deal as well as initiatives to respond to climate-related security risks, and to address the impact of climate change at local level, in particular in vulnerable populations and in heavily-affected communities; believes that the EU should support ambitious CO2 reduction targets in non-EU countries and stresses the need for climate diplomacy to play a crucial role; expects that the implementation of the European Green Deal will have significant geopolitical consequences and will influence the EU\u2019s relations with some of its partners, such as by addressing the EU\u2019s reliance on Russian fossil fuel supplies;\n\n13. Welcomes the EU\u2019s approach and global lead in providing COVID-19 vaccines and addressing the social and economic consequences of the pandemic via the COVAX mechanism and the Team Europe global recovery package; calls for the EU to put forward a robust global health strategy that includes global and EU efforts to ensure better global preparedness and an effective response to upcoming crises and to secure free, fair, affordable and equitable access to vaccines around the world; reiterates the need for the EU to become more autonomous with regard to health matters and to diversify its supply chains in order to end reliance on authoritarian and totalitarian regimes; welcomes the EU-US partnership on the COVID-19 global vaccination campaign;\n\n14. Recognises that technology, connectivity and data flow are important dimensions of the EU\u2019s external relations and partnership agreements and have significant geopolitical implications; urges the EU to develop global partnerships for the establishment of fair, open and values-driven norms and standards on a rules-based, ethical and human-centric use of technology that respect the privacy of individual users, in particular as regards artificial intelligence and the governance of the internet by putting cyber-diplomacy at the core of its external actions; stresses the need for the EU to ensure cooperation and coordination among democracies in this respect and to ensure respect for international and humanitarian law when addressing conflicts; stresses the specific threat that new digital technologies can pose for human rights defenders and others by controlling, restricting and undermining their activities, as illustrated recently by the Pegasus revelations; calls for the EU to take the initiative to promote a moratorium on the export of spyware technologies for repressive goals and the adoption of a robust international regulatory framework in this field; calls for the EU and the Member States to ensure due human rights diligence and proper vetting of exports of European surveillance technology and technical assistance in line with the Dual-Use Regulation[4]; calls for the EU and the Member States to engage with non-EU governments to end repressive cybersecurity and counter-terrorism legislation practices and legislation; stresses the need for the EU to preserve the rights of the individual; underlines, therefore, that systems of social scoring are not in line with the EU\u2019s fundamental values; stresses that such policies and tools of surveillance should under no circumstances be introduced and used in the EU; underlines, therefore, that the EU must work to limit and counter the transnational reach of digital repression; notes that the export of defence technologies and arms is a competence of the Member States;\n\n15. Reiterates that the EU should develop and implement a global connectivity strategy as an extension of the current EU-Asia Connectivity Strategy and as a strategic response to strengthen its influence in many regions of the world such as Latin America, Africa and Asia; welcomes, therefore, the ambitious and multifaceted \u2018Global Gateway\u2019 initiative presented by the Commission on 1 December 2021, which aims to invest in, among other things, digital networks and quality infrastructure with partners around the world in a fair and sustainable way, and promises stronger partnerships without creating dependencies; stresses that the Commission should make connectivity projects with non-EU countries conditional on adherence to strict social and labour rights, transparency, human rights, due diligence, interoperability, good governance and democratic standards, and the ethical use of technology both domestically and abroad; notes, in this regard, that the Commission should develop a strategy for improving its partners\u2019 access to reliable and safe technology; highlights that connectivity investments need to support economic resilience and a decarbonisation of the economy that is compatible with the Paris Agreement; asks for increased efforts to implement the EU\u2019s connectivity partnerships and encourages the Commission to develop these connectivity projects in conjunction and cooperation with like-minded partners; would welcome the establishment of a connectivity partnership with the African Union (EU) at the next AU-EU Summit;\n\n16. Welcomes the G7 global initiative \u2018Build Back Better World\u2019 and urges the EU to play an active role in developing it further, including by identifying linkages and in a mutually reinforcing way with \u2018Global Gateway\u2019;\n\nImproving EU visibility and decision-making, and making full and more effective use of the EU\u2019s hard and soft power instruments, including by introducing qualified majority voting for decision-making in EU foreign policy\n\n17. Reiterates that the EU needs first and foremost unity and a stronger and genuine political will of its Member States to jointly agree on and promote common EU foreign policy goals and EU security and defence cooperation aimed at implementing the objectives, values, principles and norms of Article 21 TEU; underlines the need to establish a Security and Defence Union that would serve as a starting point for implementing a common European defence policy, in line with the provision laid out in Article 42(2) TEU;\n\n18. Underlines that the EU\u2019s foreign policy needs to have its own instruments on foreign affairs, human rights, and security and defence; recalls that the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) was enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon but was only established in 2017; calls on the Member States and the Council, therefore, to have the courage to make the most efficient use of all foreign policy instruments available in the Treaties;\n\n19. Highlights the need for the EU, in cooperation with the Member States, to strengthen its ability to act efficiently, timely, proactively and independently, and to shape the EU\u2019s response to ongoing and upcoming challenges; stresses the urgent need for the EU to set up a mechanism of automatic exchange of information and intelligence between the Member States and the EU on foreign affairs and security issues occurring outside the EU, including on terrorism which continues to be a threat to European values and security and requires a multidimensional approach; welcomes the ongoing Strategic Compass process as the starting point for making progress towards a European Security and Defence Union and for the strategic sovereignty of the EU as regards its security and defence, as well as for the emergence of a common European strategic security and defence culture guided by our shared values and objectives and a common understanding of threats, and respect for the specific security and defence policies of the Member States; expects that the Strategic Compass will help shape a shared vision for EU security and defence of achieving strategic autonomy; stresses that the outcome should be reflected in a reformed version of the 2016 EU Global Strategy that takes into account key threats, challenges and opportunities, and offers pathways for the EU to play a more proactive global role; highlights, furthermore, that these findings should represent the basis for a revision of other documents such as the 2018 Capability Development Plan;\n\n20. Stresses the importance of human rights as an integral element of the EU\u2019s toolbox on foreign affairs and underscores its complementarity; encourages the EU to coordinate with partner countries in the defence of human rights and the application of sanctions to increase their impact; points out that the consistent and uniform application of restrictive measures in all Member States is a precondition for the credibility and effectiveness of the EU\u2019s external policy; urges the Commission, in its role as guardian of the Treaties, and the Council and the VP/HR as those responsible for the unity, consistency and effectiveness of the EU\u2019s external policy, to ensure that national responses to infringements of restrictive measures adopted by the EU are effective, proportionate and dissuasive; urges the EU to maintain close coordination and cooperation with the US in the use of sanctions when pursuing shared foreign and security policy objectives, while avoiding any unintended consequences for the interests of both countries;\n\n21. Further stresses that, upon completion, the Strategic Compass must have significant added value for the EU\u2019s CFSP and the solidarity among Member States, and should not be a mere listing of threats and challenges facing our EU and its Member States; insists that the final draft of the Strategic Compass should identify present and future capability gaps \u2013 both institutional and assets-wise \u2013 and provide a clear roadmap to fill in those gaps; reiterates Parliament\u2019s intention to be involved in the process; expects the final draft of the Strategic Compass and the NATO Strategic Concept to be coherent with one another, reflecting a clearer division of tasks between the EU and NATO to ensure better collaboration and burden sharing, and to identify ways to reinforce EU-NATO cooperation; encourages those Member States to utilise to the full extent the capabilities afforded to them via NATO membership; compels the Member States to reach, upon completion of the Strategic Compass, an ambitious common understanding of Article 42(7) TEU and Article 222 TFEU and their relation to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty;\n\n22. Recalls that the Treaties provide for the possibility to improve decision-making procedures for the CFSP; recalls Article 31(2) TEU, which allows the Council to take certain decisions on CFSP matters by qualified majority voting (QMV), and the \u2018passerelle clause\u2019 contained in Article 31(3) TEU that provides for the possibility to switch progressively to QMV for decisions in the area of the CFSP that do not have military or defence implications but enhance the EU\u2019s solidarity and mutual assistance in case of crises; stresses that unanimity hampers the EU\u2019s ability to act and therefore urges the Member States to use QMV for CFSP decision-making; in particular, reiterates its call for the introduction of QMV for the adoption of statements on international human rights issues and human rights-related decisions, the introduction and implementation of sanctions under the GHRSR, and for all decisions regarding civilian common security and defence policy (CSDP) missions; stresses that the use of Articles 31 and 44 TEU could improve the EU\u2019s flexibility and capacity to act on a broad range of foreign policy issues;\n\n23. Reiterates its call for the establishment of new formats of cooperation, such as the European Security Council, in order to develop an integrated approach to conflict and crisis; underlines that the composition and possible remit of this cooperation should be the subject of consideration; recalls that the ongoing Conference on the Future of Europe provides a relevant framework to shape innovative proposals in this respect; calls for the Conference to be more ambitious with regard to the external dimension of EU policies, including on security and defence, such as through the establishment of EU standing multinational military units and the introduction of QMV in EU foreign policy decision-making; notes, however, that new institutional frameworks alone will not solve the structural and political challenges faced by the CSDP; reiterates its call for the establishment of a Defence Ministers Council;\n\n24. Stresses that the EU\u2019s own instruments should include the creation of a European Diplomatic Academy, where EU diplomats are prepared as such from the very beginning and converge on common EU values and interests, moving towards a true esprit de corps determined by a common diplomatic culture from a European perspective: calls for the full implementation of the pilot project \u2018Towards the creation of a European Diplomatic Academy\u2019, which could pave the way for setting up this academy and should include the establishment of a selection process for entry into the EEAS and the EU Delegations; underlines the importance of strengthening the EU\u2019s diplomatic representation in non-EU countries and striving for full-fledged diplomatic representation in multilateral organisations in general and the UN in particular; stresses that stronger EU representation in non-EU countries and multilateral organisations would significantly promote the so-needed unity among EU institutions and Member States when it comes to tackling global challenges in the field of the CFSP;\n\n25. Stresses that a holistic approach to the CFSP requires the synergy of all available EU assets in the field of external action; in this respect, highlights the key role and comparative advantage of the European Parliament in the EU\u2019s diplomacy, notably through interparliamentary relations and Parliament\u2019s extensive engagement through democracy support programmes with third parties; calls on the Commission, the EEAS and the Member States to recognise Parliament as an integral part of \u2018Team Europe\u2019 and to reflect this in the operational structures; highlights that culture has become a useful diplomatic tool and a fundamental part of the EU\u2019s soft power; underlines that culture has major potential to promote EU values;\n\n26.

Condemns the actions of the PRC in Hong Kong and underlines that the ongoing undermining of Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy does not only go against China\u2019s bilateral treaties obligations and international law, but also puts into question Beijing\u2019s role as a credible partner; reinforces its commitment to the targeted sanctions under the EU Human Rights Global Sanction Regime against the Chinese officials involved in human rights violations in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, and further urges the Council to adopt targeted sanctions, including the implementation of travel bans and asset freezes, against individuals and entities in Hong Kong and the PRC for the serious violations of human rights and international law in Hong Kong; calls on the Member States that still have extradition treaties with China and Hong Kong to suspend individual extraditions wherever the extradition of an individual puts them at risk of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, where that individual would face charges for politically motivated reasons, in other situations where ethnic minorities, representatives of the pro-democratic opposition in Hong Kong and dissidents in general would be targeted, and wherever this would be in breach of the EU\u2019s obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights;\n\n61. Underlines the importance of the EU joining its transatlantic partners in pursuing an independent external investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 virus that originated in Wuhan, China, in order to seek much needed answers and insights into the possible prevention of future global disasters that directly impact foreign and security policy;\n\n62. Denounces the CCP\u2019s coercion of Lithuania and other EU Member States and partners, and calls for greater solidarity with countries coerced by the CCP, including by collaborating with our democratic allies in opening our markets to economies suffering under the CCP\u2019s economic coercion;\n\n63. Welcomes the Commission President\u2019s announcement of plans to present a new joint communication on a partnership with the Gulf region; calls for the EU to present a coherent strategy for balanced EU engagement in the region, with the promotion of regional security and cooperation as a key strategic objective; notes that such engagement should strive to build synergies with regional players, such as through the Baghdad Conference for Cooperation and Partnership and through increased EU support for Track II dialogue initiatives involving academics, civil society, religious leaders and other actors; is encouraged by the de-escalation of tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia and calls on both countries to swiftly conclude the process of re-establishing full diplomatic relations; reiterates that the EU\u2019s priority is to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as a matter of security for Europe and the region; recalls that the JCPOA remains the only way to stop Iran\u2019s worrying nuclear activities; commends the role of the VP/HR and the EEAS in mediating between the US and Iran in efforts to revive the JCPOA; calls on the US and Iran to pursue meaningful negotiations with a view to returning to compliance with the JCPOA; insists that the path towards the revival of the JCPOA combine Iran\u2019s full return to its obligations under the JCPOA with the lifting of all JCPOA-related US sanctions; notes the need to address and counter Iran\u2019s wider malign and destabilising activities across the Middle East and beyond, including on the territory of the Member States; stresses that any agreement with Iran needs to include sufficient safeguards so that Iran will not be able to acquire nuclear weapons; expresses grave concern about the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s (IAEA) reported lack of access to its monitoring and surveillance equipment at nuclear facilities and locations in Iran, which greatly hampers the IAEA\u2019s ability to verify and monitor Iran\u2019s nuclear activities, and about the fact that safeguard issues remain unresolved over the last two years; condemns Iran\u2019s human rights violations against its own people, the ballistic missile programme and the terror activities in the region;\n\n64. Underlines that the situation in Afghanistan is a wakeup call for the EU to reassess the international approach to nation-building abroad and strategically reshape an integrated approach of its external policies, to increase its share of responsibility in global security and to seek greater sovereignty in its foreign and security policy; is concerned by the dramatic humanitarian, political, economic and security situation in Afghanistan, particularly as one in three Afghans face severe hunger; calls on the Commission and EEAS to step up humanitarian aid and to use all tools available in order to ensure that Afghans at risk have access to protection; stresses the need for the Taliban regime to bear responsibility and accountability for the protection of human life and property and for the restoration of security, civil order and public services; reiterates that Afghan women and girls, people in professions linked with Afghan civil society, human rights defenders, political activists, journalists, academics, artists, religious and ethnic minorities and other groups at risk, like all Afghan people, deserve to live in safety, security and dignity and to have full access to education and public life, and welcomes the broad international support for their rights and freedoms; calls for the further evacuation of Afghans at risk, notably women judges, human rights defenders, journalists, local staff and other persons at risk due to their activities in promoting democracy and fundamental freedoms; calls for the EU to preserve the achievements of the last 20 years and to ensure that Afghanistan does not become once more a safe haven for terrorist groups; calls for the EU to conduct a thorough scrutiny of and draw lessons from the 20-year engagement in Afghanistan and for a comprehensive lessons-based EU strategy for Afghanistan and the surrounding countries to immediately be developed; emphasises the importance of cooperating with neighbouring and regional countries to ensure global security and regional stability, while bearing in mind that not all of Afghanistan\u2019s neighbours and regional powers shared the same goals as the US-led coalition; highlights, in this regard, the important role that certain countries have played in repatriating Europeans and evacuating Afghans in distress, in particular by exerting significant diplomatic pressure on the Taliban forces;\n\n65. Welcomes the EU\u2019s renewed commitment to the Indo-Pacific region and the recognition of its growing importance for EU interests as raised in the joint communication of 16 September 2021 by the VP/HR and the Commission on the EU strategy for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific[13] as well as the Council conclusions of 19 April on the same subject; advocates for stronger cooperation with countries in the region, in particular Japan, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Australia, New Zealand, and Korea; acknowledges the intense geopolitical competition and territorial disputes in the region, spurred largely by China\u2019s growing assertiveness with its neighbours; calls on all parties to adhere to the principles of international law, most notably the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea; underlines the need for a strategic long-term engagement in the Indo-Pacific region and for establishing comprehensive and strategic bilateral and multilateral dialogue mechanisms with Indo-Pacific countries and their societies, in particular with like-minded countries such as, among others, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand; underlines the importance of security and stability in the Indo-Pacific for prosperity and security in the EU; notes new emerging partnerships in the region such as the establishment of the trilateral military alliance between Australia, the UK and US (AUKUS) and expresses its regret about the fact that this partnership was created with a poor level of coordination;\n\n66. Highlights India\u2019s rising regional and geopolitical influence; underlines that increased political engagement is required to reinforce the EU-India partnership and unleash the full potential of the bilateral relations; reiterates the need for a deeper partnership which should be based on shared values and full respect for human rights; acknowledges that India is a key partner for the EU given its position and its leading role in fundamental areas;\n\n67. Calls for stepping up and enhancing cooperation with our partners in Latin America; believes that a strengthened relationship with Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is highly important to the EU\u2019s geopolitical strategy in the world; stresses the need for the Union to strengthen the ties that unite the EU with LAC countries, particularly in defending the rules-based multilateral order; calls for the EU to use all available tools to deepen its cooperation with LAC partners; urges the EU to recover its position as the preferred partner of Latin American countries in view of other geopolitical actors occupying increasing space in the region, especially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine diplomacy; calls on the EU and the Member States to implement more assertive policies towards authoritarian regimes that have benefited from their relations with the EU and have dismantled, violated or directly suppressed the rights and freedoms of their citizens;\n\nStrengthening democratic oversight, scrutiny and accountability, and the parliamentary dimension of the EU\u2019s CFSP\n\n68. Highlights the specific contribution of the European Parliament to the EU\u2019s foreign and security policy through its parliamentary diplomacy assets, for example through its reports and resolutions, its dense network of standing interparliamentary bodies, its political dialogue with office-holders across the world and its democracy support, mediation and election observation activities; affirms that Parliament should make full use of its oversight and budgetary powers in the decisions of the Union in the international arena; highlights the importance of Parliament\u2019s democracy support programmes which have strong potential to strengthen the EU\u2019s role around the world by engaging key political stakeholders and facilitating sustainable democratic governance in non-EU countries;\n\n69. Underlines that political and technical dialogue between parliaments is crucial and must be well coordinated with the executive\u2019s actions; accordingly, stresses the importance of a smooth exchange of all pertinent information between institutions in the area of the CFSP, including the exchange of relevant confidential information, in the interest of the effectiveness of EU external action as a whole and for a more accountable CFSP;\n\n70. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to enable and strengthen parliamentary oversight of EU external action, including by continuing regular consultations with the VP/HR and the Commission; underlines that such oversight plays an important role in ensuring the proper functioning of European democracy and public trust; stresses that such oversight can serve as the starting point towards a stronger institutional role for Parliament in the CFSP; calls for the swift conclusion of negotiations to replace the 2002 Interinstitutional Agreement on Parliament\u2019s access to sensitive information of the Council in the field of security and defence policy[14]; calls for the coordination of Member States\u2019 security and information services;\n\n71. Underlines the importance of the Parliamentary Assemblies as spaces for cooperation and institutional dialogue and their valuable contribution to European foreign action in matters of security as well as the need to promote their activity and guarantee their correct functioning and development; calls for the strengthening of Parliament\u2019s oversight of the EU Delegations\u2019 work in representing EU values and principles abroad and seeking the fulfilment of EU interests without disregarding the human rights approach; highlights the need for EU Delegations to have all the necessary and appropriate resources and capabilities to act effectively in these tasks;\n\n72. Calls for the full use of the increased involvement of the European Parliament in the programming of Global Europe and IPA III; welcomes the introduction of a biannual High-Level Geopolitical Dialogue for external financing instruments as a critical tool to not only scrutinise, but to also actively shape the EU\u2019s foreign policy priorities; underlines that these geopolitical dialogues aim to allow Parliament to provide orientations, strategic steering and guidance for programming and implementation across thematic and geographic priorities of Global Europe and IPA III; insists, however, that Parliament should receive relevant preparatory documents sufficiently on time and with an adequate level of detail in order to carry out a meaningful scrutiny; calls for improved transparency in the implementation of the financing instruments through the creation of a single common transparent public database of projects and actions;\n\n73. Reminds the Council of Parliament\u2019s right to be informed about all the stages of the procedures connected to negotiations and conclusions of the international agreements and its prerogative to grant or to withhold consent to such agreements; is determined to use these powers, as defined in the Treaties, in order to ensure transparency and democratic oversight over the international agreements negotiated on behalf of the EU, as well as the implementation of the European Peace Facility, as pointed out in its recommendation of 28 March 2019[15], including as regards its complementarity with other EU instruments in the field of external action;\n\n74. Reiterates its view that it is high time to revise the 2010 declaration of political accountability in order to improve this basis for relations between Parliament and the VP/HR;\n\n\u00b0\n\n\u00b0 \u00b0\n\n75.

This has produced centrifugal tendencies in Northern Irish politics, benefiting Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP at the expense of the political centre, and failing to produce working executives. Cushnahan proposes replacing this system with governing coalitions of parties, requiring two thirds of the Assembly\u2019s backing, \u201ccross-community support\u201d and sharing of first ministers.\n\nThere is still no \u201cequality of respect\u201d for the nationalist and unionist traditions, and \u201csupporters of the violent campaigns of republican and loyalist terrorist organisations continue to glorify their actions, and continue to inflict suffering and pain on the families of their victims, denying them closure\u201d. He calls for public apologies from those who perpetrated and supported paramilitary violence, greater efforts on integrated housing and education, action plans to remove peace walls (the \u201cgreatest misnomer\u201d, actually entrenching division), and more reciprocal, mutual respect, criticising for instance Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s veto of a monument to commemorate the Northern Ireland Centenary at Stormont.\n\nIn the case of a border poll, Cushnahan wants to avoid the pitfalls of Brexit, where voters had minimal information on the realistic options and consequences after a Leave victory. He calls for the British and Irish governments to fund a multi-university research project, to explore in detail the options for Irish unification. This work should examine different state models for a united Ireland \u2013 a \u201cunitary, federal or confederal\u201d state \u2013 as well as possible \u201clegislative and structural changes\u201d, options for protecting minority rights, \u201cgovernment culture and citizenship\u201d, and how contingencies such as Scottish independence would affect unification. This research would provide \u201cdetailed analysis\u201d, without recommending a particular course of action. The ultimate decision would lie with the electorate, but they should be as well informed as possible.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nJohn Cushnahan is a former student Civil Rights activist and General Secretary of the Alliance Party (1974-82) when he was the party\u2019s only full-time politician. John was a Councillor for North Belfast 1977-85 and in 1982, was elected as Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for the staunchly unionist constituency of North Down. John was appointed Chairman of the Assembly Education Committee and was Alliance Party Chief Whip (1982-4 ) and party leader 1984-7. When the Unionist parties used the Assembly's procedures to oppose the Anglo-Irish Agreement, in December 1985, John called on the British Government to dissolve the Assembly. This terminated his income as a full-time politician. Despite this, he led the Alliance Party into the June 1987 Westminster Election where the party doubled its share of the vote from 5-10% (this tally was not exceeded until 2019). He retired as Alliance Leader in September 1987. In 1989, he was invited by Fine Gael to contest the European Parliament (EP) election in the strongly nationalist Munster constituency. After being re-elected twice, he retired in 2004. During this period, John was elected Vice President of the EP Regional Policy and Foreign Affairs Committees and was EP rapporteur on Interreg, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Kashmir. John was also appointed by the EU Council as Head of Mission to lead multi-national and multi-disciplinary teams in South Asia on five occasions, the objective of which was to strengthen Democracy and Human Rights in the region.\n\nWatch the conversation\n\nWhat was said?\n\nThe Good Friday Agreement was a \u201chistoric achievement\u201d, says John Cushnahan, but it has fallen far short of its aspirations. After the Agreement was ratified, \u201ccomplacency then set in\u201d, and we began to \u201cdeceive ourselves about what was happening\u201d. Cushnahan paints a bleak picture of the peace process and democracy\u2019s success in post-conflict Northern Ireland. There is no bill of rights, no \u201cequality of respect\u201d for the Unionist and Nationalist traditions, and \u201ctotally insufficient progress\u201d on integration in education and housing. The \u201csupporters of the violent campaigns of Republican and Loyalist terrorist organisations continue to glorify their actions, and continue to inflict suffering and pain on the families of their victims, denying them closure\u201d. The biggest failure for Cushnahan, however, is the \u201cinability to deliver stable political institutions\u201d. He notes how the Stormont Executive has collapsed at least six times since 1999 (nine according some academics), and hasn\u2019t sat for ten out of twenty two years since power-sharing was installed. But Cushnahan is still convinced and determined that the Good Friday Agreement can be amended to finally meet aspirations.\n\nJohn Cushnahan was born in 1948 to a working-class Catholic family in the lower Falls, Belfast. He was involved in student civil rights activism before entering elected politics. He became General Secretary of the Alliance Party in 1974, at the time the party\u2019s only full time employee, and sat on the Belfast City Council from 1977-85. He served as Alliance Party leader from 1984-7, a difficult period in which Alliance backed the Anglo-Irish Agreement against concerted Unionist opposition. When Unionists blocked the Agreement, which would give the Irish Republic a consultative role in governing Northern Ireland, Cushnahan called on the British Government to prorogue Stormont. Stormont was dissolved in 1986, and Cushnahan soon after resigned his position in Alliance and moved to the Republic. Joining Fine Gael, he served as a member of the European Parliament from 1989-2004. Barry Colfer commends him for having \u201cdone more than most to build bridges North-South and East-West in British and Irish politics\u201d. Long retired from elected office, Cushnahan is still deeply engaged with politics, brimming with analysis and suggestions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that we should just discard the Good Friday Agreement\u201d, Cushnahan says. We should \u201creview it, see where it\u2019s defective and make corrective decisions\u201d. He particularly wants revisions to the power-sharing system established by Good Friday and the subsequent St Andrew's Agreement (2006), in which the largest party in the Assembly takes the First Minister role, and the largest party from the other tradition takes the Deputy First Ministership. Cushnahan argues that this system has led voters to coalesce around the largest party from their community \u2013 Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP. These centrifugal tendencies have weakened the political centre in Northern Ireland \u2013 the UUP, Alliance and SDLP \u2013 and have failed to produce working executives. Cushnahan proposes replacing this system with governing coalitions of parties, requiring two thirds of the Assembly\u2019s backing, \u201ccross-community support\u201d and sharing of the first minister roles.\n\nCushnahan also wants greater efforts towards reconciliation, to meet the unfulfilled aspirations of Good Friday. Audience member, former Alliance Chairman, Phillip McGarry, asks whether Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s \u201cunapologetic\u201d defence of IRA violence serves to \u201cundermine\u201d reconciliation, while Fergal McCarthy enquires about possible policies for reconciliation? Cushnahan offers some solutions. He calls for a roadmap to remove the \u201cpeace walls\u201d in cities such as Belfast \u2013 they are the \u201cgreatest misnomer\u201d, and only entrench segregation. He also calls for greater efforts at integrating education and housing. With regards to housing, he suggests removing all paramilitary murals as a productive first step. Cushnahan is scathing about all attempts to defend paramilitary violence. \u201cHow can anyone expect reconciliation in Northern Ireland when paramilitaries on both sides continue to glorify their actions?\u201d They should publicly apologise and commit to peaceful, democratic methods in future. Apologies would \u201cgive some comfort to the 3000 families whose relatives were slaughtered in the Troubles. And that would be an important psychological first step.\u201d\n\nCushnahan also addresses the framework for a border poll. Noting the ambiguities of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent Northern Ireland Act of 1998 on how a poll should be initiated, Cushnahan argues that two thirds of Assembly votes should be required to schedule one. If a poll is scheduled, Cushnahan is determined to avoid the pitfalls of the Brexit referendum, where voters had minimal information on the realistic consequences of a Leave vote. He criticises Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s campaigns for reunification as \u201csloganizing\u201d and insubstantial, and draws parallels between the party and Boris Johnson\u2019s Tories \u2013 both are \u201ccynically exploiting narrow nationalisms for electoral advantage\u201d.\n\nCushnahan wants voters to be as informed as possible before a border poll, and calls for the British and Irish governments to fund multi-university research projects with \u201cdetailed analysis of the options\u201d for Irish unification. This research, \u201ccoordinated under a single organisational umbrella\u201d, would explore diverse aspects of unification. It would cover potential state models (unitary, federal and confederal), \u201clegislative and structural changes\u201d, options for protecting minority rights, government and citizenship in a united Ireland, and the effects of \u201cpossible shocks\u201d such as Scottish independence. Publishing this research should \u201cinform the public and encourage a constructive and ongoing debate well in advance of any border poll\u201d.\n\nHowever, Cushnahan doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s \u201cany possibility in the near future of an all-Ireland settlement.\u201d So, in the meantime, we have to try and make Stormont work. \u201cIf we can\u2019t unite Northern Ireland, how the hell can we unite Ireland?\" A question which will inevitably be asked again in this series and as the political fallout from Brexit continues to animate these islands."}], "John Cushnahan was a member of the European Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights.": [{"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/John_Cushnahan", "page_content": "John Walls Cushnahan (born 23 July 1948) is a former politician in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland who served as leader of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and then as a Member of the European Parliament for Fine Gael.\n\nIrish politician\n\nQuick facts: John Cushnahan, Leader of the Alliance Party ... \u25bc\n\nCushnahan was educated at St Mary's Christian Brothers Grammar School and Queen's University, Belfast and worked as a teacher before going into politics.

He joined the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland (APNI) in the early 1970s and went on to act as its general secretary (1974-82). In addition he was to represent the party on Belfast City Council (1977-85) and in October 1982 was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly for the constituency of North Down (1982-86). Then in 1984 Cushnahan succeeded Oliver Napier as leader of the APNI (1984-87) and in this role attempted to strengthen his party's ties with the British Liberals. The biggest test of his leadership however came with the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement (AIA) and he went on to ensure that the APNI largely supported its implementation. Frustrated with the lack of any immediate indication of devolved powers being returned to Northern Ireland, he then decided to resign as party leader in 1987. In 1989, after having moved to the Republic of Ireland, Cushnahan joined Fine Gael (FG) and succeeded in being elected in 1989 as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the constituency of Munster (1989-2004).

However, when the Assembly was dissolved in 1986, Cushnahan found it financially difficult to remain in politics and so stood down as leader in 1987 to be succeeded by John Alderdice.\n\n\n\nTwo years later Cushnahan made a surprise political comeback when he moved to the Republic of Ireland and stood as a Fine Gael candidate in the 1989 election to the European Parliament, winning a seat in the Munster constituency.

We are \u201cindebted to its architects\u201d. However, \u201ccomplacency then set in\u201d shortly after ratification, and we began to \u201cdeceive ourselves about what was happening\u201d. It instituted no bill of rights, no major process of post-conflict reconciliation, and \u201ctotally insufficient progress\u201d on integration in housing and education. Its largest failure is the \u201cinability to deliver stable political isntitutions\u201d.The GFA should not be discarded, but needs reviewing and \u201ccorrective decisions\u201d to \u201cimplement what was intended in 1998\u201d.\n\nThe power-sharing system established by the 2006 St Andrew's Agreement, in which the largest party in the Assembly takes the First Minister role, and the largest party from the other tradition takes the Deputy First Ministership, has led voters to coalesce around the largest party from their community. This has produced centrifugal tendencies in Northern Irish politics, benefiting Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP at the expense of the political centre, and failing to produce working executives. Cushnahan proposes replacing this system with governing coalitions of parties, requiring two thirds of the Assembly\u2019s backing, \u201ccross-community support\u201d and sharing of first ministers.\n\nThere is still no \u201cequality of respect\u201d for the nationalist and unionist traditions, and \u201csupporters of the violent campaigns of republican and loyalist terrorist organisations continue to glorify their actions, and continue to inflict suffering and pain on the families of their victims, denying them closure\u201d. He calls for public apologies from those who perpetrated and supported paramilitary violence, greater efforts on integrated housing and education, action plans to remove peace walls (the \u201cgreatest misnomer\u201d, actually entrenching division), and more reciprocal, mutual respect, criticising for instance Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s veto of a monument to commemorate the Northern Ireland Centenary at Stormont.\n\nIn the case of a border poll, Cushnahan wants to avoid the pitfalls of Brexit, where voters had minimal information on the realistic options and consequences after a Leave victory. He calls for the British and Irish governments to fund a multi-university research project, to explore in detail the options for Irish unification. This work should examine different state models for a united Ireland \u2013 a \u201cunitary, federal or confederal\u201d state \u2013 as well as possible \u201clegislative and structural changes\u201d, options for protecting minority rights, \u201cgovernment culture and citizenship\u201d, and how contingencies such as Scottish independence would affect unification. This research would provide \u201cdetailed analysis\u201d, without recommending a particular course of action. The ultimate decision would lie with the electorate, but they should be as well informed as possible.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nJohn Cushnahan is a former student Civil Rights activist and General Secretary of the Alliance Party (1974-82) when he was the party\u2019s only full-time politician. John was a Councillor for North Belfast 1977-85 and in 1982, was elected as Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for the staunchly unionist constituency of North Down. John was appointed Chairman of the Assembly Education Committee and was Alliance Party Chief Whip (1982-4 ) and party leader 1984-7. When the Unionist parties used the Assembly's procedures to oppose the Anglo-Irish Agreement, in December 1985, John called on the British Government to dissolve the Assembly. This terminated his income as a full-time politician. Despite this, he led the Alliance Party into the June 1987 Westminster Election where the party doubled its share of the vote from 5-10% (this tally was not exceeded until 2019). He retired as Alliance Leader in September 1987. In 1989, he was invited by Fine Gael to contest the European Parliament (EP) election in the strongly nationalist Munster constituency. After being re-elected twice, he retired in 2004. During this period, John was elected Vice President of the EP Regional Policy and Foreign Affairs Committees and was EP rapporteur on Interreg, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Kashmir. John was also appointed by the EU Council as Head of Mission to lead multi-national and multi-disciplinary teams in South Asia on five occasions, the objective of which was to strengthen Democracy and Human Rights in the region.\n\nWatch the conversation\n\nWhat was said?\n\nThe Good Friday Agreement was a \u201chistoric achievement\u201d, says John Cushnahan, but it has fallen far short of its aspirations. After the Agreement was ratified, \u201ccomplacency then set in\u201d, and we began to \u201cdeceive ourselves about what was happening\u201d. Cushnahan paints a bleak picture of the peace process and democracy\u2019s success in post-conflict Northern Ireland. There is no bill of rights, no \u201cequality of respect\u201d for the Unionist and Nationalist traditions, and \u201ctotally insufficient progress\u201d on integration in education and housing. The \u201csupporters of the violent campaigns of Republican and Loyalist terrorist organisations continue to glorify their actions, and continue to inflict suffering and pain on the families of their victims, denying them closure\u201d. The biggest failure for Cushnahan, however, is the \u201cinability to deliver stable political institutions\u201d. He notes how the Stormont Executive has collapsed at least six times since 1999 (nine according some academics), and hasn\u2019t sat for ten out of twenty two years since power-sharing was installed. But Cushnahan is still convinced and determined that the Good Friday Agreement can be amended to finally meet aspirations.\n\nJohn Cushnahan was born in 1948 to a working-class Catholic family in the lower Falls, Belfast. He was involved in student civil rights activism before entering elected politics. He became General Secretary of the Alliance Party in 1974, at the time the party\u2019s only full time employee, and sat on the Belfast City Council from 1977-85. He served as Alliance Party leader from 1984-7, a difficult period in which Alliance backed the Anglo-Irish Agreement against concerted Unionist opposition. When Unionists blocked the Agreement, which would give the Irish Republic a consultative role in governing Northern Ireland, Cushnahan called on the British Government to prorogue Stormont. Stormont was dissolved in 1986, and Cushnahan soon after resigned his position in Alliance and moved to the Republic. Joining Fine Gael, he served as a member of the European Parliament from 1989-2004. Barry Colfer commends him for having \u201cdone more than most to build bridges North-South and East-West in British and Irish politics\u201d. Long retired from elected office, Cushnahan is still deeply engaged with politics, brimming with analysis and suggestions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that we should just discard the Good Friday Agreement\u201d, Cushnahan says. We should \u201creview it, see where it\u2019s defective and make corrective decisions\u201d. He particularly wants revisions to the power-sharing system established by Good Friday and the subsequent St Andrew's Agreement (2006), in which the largest party in the Assembly takes the First Minister role, and the largest party from the other tradition takes the Deputy First Ministership. Cushnahan argues that this system has led voters to coalesce around the largest party from their community \u2013 Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP. These centrifugal tendencies have weakened the political centre in Northern Ireland \u2013 the UUP, Alliance and SDLP \u2013 and have failed to produce working executives. Cushnahan proposes replacing this system with governing coalitions of parties, requiring two thirds of the Assembly\u2019s backing, \u201ccross-community support\u201d and sharing of the first minister roles.\n\nCushnahan also wants greater efforts towards reconciliation, to meet the unfulfilled aspirations of Good Friday. Audience member, former Alliance Chairman, Phillip McGarry, asks whether Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s \u201cunapologetic\u201d defence of IRA violence serves to \u201cundermine\u201d reconciliation, while Fergal McCarthy enquires about possible policies for reconciliation? Cushnahan offers some solutions. He calls for a roadmap to remove the \u201cpeace walls\u201d in cities such as Belfast \u2013 they are the \u201cgreatest misnomer\u201d, and only entrench segregation. He also calls for greater efforts at integrating education and housing. With regards to housing, he suggests removing all paramilitary murals as a productive first step. Cushnahan is scathing about all attempts to defend paramilitary violence. \u201cHow can anyone expect reconciliation in Northern Ireland when paramilitaries on both sides continue to glorify their actions?\u201d They should publicly apologise and commit to peaceful, democratic methods in future. Apologies would \u201cgive some comfort to the 3000 families whose relatives were slaughtered in the Troubles. And that would be an important psychological first step.\u201d\n\nCushnahan also addresses the framework for a border poll. Noting the ambiguities of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent Northern Ireland Act of 1998 on how a poll should be initiated, Cushnahan argues that two thirds of Assembly votes should be required to schedule one. If a poll is scheduled, Cushnahan is determined to avoid the pitfalls of the Brexit referendum, where voters had minimal information on the realistic consequences of a Leave vote. He criticises Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s campaigns for reunification as \u201csloganizing\u201d and insubstantial, and draws parallels between the party and Boris Johnson\u2019s Tories \u2013 both are \u201ccynically exploiting narrow nationalisms for electoral advantage\u201d.\n\nCushnahan wants voters to be as informed as possible before a border poll, and calls for the British and Irish governments to fund multi-university research projects with \u201cdetailed analysis of the options\u201d for Irish unification. This research, \u201ccoordinated under a single organisational umbrella\u201d, would explore diverse aspects of unification. It would cover potential state models (unitary, federal and confederal), \u201clegislative and structural changes\u201d, options for protecting minority rights, government and citizenship in a united Ireland, and the effects of \u201cpossible shocks\u201d such as Scottish independence. Publishing this research should \u201cinform the public and encourage a constructive and ongoing debate well in advance of any border poll\u201d.\n\nHowever, Cushnahan doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s \u201cany possibility in the near future of an all-Ireland settlement.\u201d So, in the meantime, we have to try and make Stormont work. \u201cIf we can\u2019t unite Northern Ireland, how the hell can we unite Ireland?\" A question which will inevitably be asked again in this series and as the political fallout from Brexit continues to animate these islands."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/ro/John_Cushnahan", "page_content": "[[ Mumhan (constituency of the European Parliament)| \u200b ]]\n\nFifth European Parliament\n\n[[ Mumhan (constituency of the European Parliament)| \u200b ]]\n\n[[ Mumhan (constituency of the European Parliament)| \u200b ]]\n\nThird European Parliament\n\nLeader of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland\n\nMember of the 1982\u20131986 Northern Ireland Assembly\n\nLegislatur\u0103"}, {"url": "https://parltrack.org/mep/John%20Walls%20CUSHNAHAN", "page_content": "Birth date 1948-07-23T00:00:00 place Belfast\n\nCV B.Ed., Queen's University, Belfast (1973).
