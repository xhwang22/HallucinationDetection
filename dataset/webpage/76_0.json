The club was beginning a poor era (The Barren Years) and he provided some respite for the Celtic Support.\n\nThe English defender arrived at Celtic Park from Italian club Pisa for \u00a3650,000 in the summer of 1989. Paul Elliott had moved to Italy from Aston Villa having started his professional career at Luton Town. While the switch to the continent may not have worked out as well as hoped the Lewisham-born centre-half undoubtedly benefited from his spell in the more cultured environment of Serie A; at that time Serie A was by far the premier football league in the world.\n\nPhysically big, good in the air and no slouch, Paul Elliot was also strong in the tackle and had the ability and confidence to play the ball out of defence rather than just lump it up the pitch. He was an undoubted asset to Celtic and his performances in the Hoops were seldom short of excellent. Admittedly he had a unconvincing start at Celtic, but once he got going he was peerless. Unfortunately for Paul Elliott the same could not be said for too many of his Celtic team-mates, and through no fault of his own the defender had the misfortune to play in one of the poorest Celtic sides in the club\u2019s history.\n\nFor two seasons Paul Elliott was, alongside the magnificent Paul McStay, the only undeniable top quality performers in a Celtic side which could barely compete with the most mediocre of Scottish Premier teams let alone the big money signings of a rejuvenated and rampaging Rangers.\n\nHe was injured in pre season 1989 and it was a disappointment that it took until September 23rd to make his debut against Motherwell at Celtic Park. Four days later he played in the infamous but breathtaking 5-4 win against Partizan Belgrade in the European Cup Winners cup. He quickly became a big favourite with the supporters but was targeted by referees and picked up a lot of bookings in his first season with a number of Celtic fans suspecting that he was being victimised by referees for various reasons.\n\nHe scored his first goals for Celtic, a double, against Ayr United in a 4-0 League Cup win in August 1990. He was a constant threat at dead ball situations with his aerial ability and Rangers took to Gary Stevens blatantly obstructing his runs in the penalty area in the 1990/91 season. Despite those efforts he scored twice against Rangers with thundering headers.\n\nDuring Paul Elliott\u2019s time in Glasgow the Bhoys did make it to a Scottish Cup final (1989/90) and a League Cup final (1990/91). Celtic lost the former to Aberdeen on penalties and the latter 2-1 to Rangers \u2013 Paul Elliott netting for the Hoops. League form in that period was woeful, finishing in a sorry fifth and distant third as Rangers romped home to the title on both occasions. Paul Elliott\u2019s personal performances had been considerably better though than that of his teammates and he firmly established himself as a huge favourite of the Parkhead fans.\n\nDuring his spell at Celtic he was often on the end of terrible racist abuse at away grounds all over Scotland, including unsurprisingly Ibrox, despite his great friend from Villa Park days, Mark Walters, playing for them.\n\nIt could be argued of Paul Elliott that during his time in the Hoops he wasn\u2019t only the best defender at Celtic Park but the whole of Scotland. Certainly the plaudits from pundits were plentiful and there was also talk of an England call-up. Unsurprisingly clubs in England had also noticed Elliott\u2019s fine displays and it seemed only a matter of time before he would be tempted back south.\n\nIn his last game for the club, in Pat Bonner\u2019s testimonial in May 1991, the fans stormed the pitch and carried him aloft in hope that he would stay having chanted \u201cPaul Elliott must stay\u201d throughout the preceding 90 minutes. He was that popular, but he was self-admittedly homesick and there was a financial spat with the board (not an uncommon occurrence back then). Some fans were critical over the board not making greater efforts to retain his services. Cynics felt that Elliot had tried to work his ticket away from Parkhead by initiating financial problems with the board regarding a house bought for him by the club to which he could retain the profits after selling.\n\nAs a measure of his contribution to the game, he won the \u2018Scottish Footballer of the Year\u2018 award for his form in season 1990/91. Highly deserved, and in retrospectives many have rated him as one of the finest centre-backs they have ever seen at Celtic if not all of football.\n\nSo it proved when in the summer of 1991 Chelsea paid \u00a31.25 million to take the player back to his native London.\n\nPaul Elliott had made a total of 66 appearances for Celtic over two seasons and scored five goals. He failed to pick up any winners medals during his time in Scotland but there\u2019s little doubt that Paul Elliott was a player good enough to play in any Celtic defence during the past 15 years.\n\nBig things were expected in England of Paul Elliott, but sadly his career came to a premature end after he suffered a serious knee injury in a tackle by Liverpool striker Dean Saunders in September 1992. It led to a protracted legal case in which Dean Saunders was found not guilty.\n\nPost-Playing Career\n\nSince the premature end of his playing days, Paul Elliott has enjoyed a successful career in the media and in October 2006 was appointed onto the English FA\u2019s disciplinary panel.\n\nHe made his mark tirelessly working for anti-racism groups and became the first black footballer to receive a CBE in Feb 2013 for his work in the field. However very soon after receiving his bobble, he was forced to resign from England\u2019s FA. He stupidly texted an offensive term in a message over an alleged dispute (business related) with another black footballer (Richard Rufus). He\u2019d uncharacteristically described him using an offensive racial \u201cn\u201d word. It was disappointing but this shouldn\u2019t be seen as being reflective of his true character, as he has been a genuine idol to all in his time campaigning in football.\n\nPaul Elliott still visits Parkhead occasionally as a media pundit and is always given a warm welcome by very appreciative Celtic fans.\n\nWe wish him the best.\n\nPlaying Career\n\nAPPEARANCES\n\nLEAGUE SCOTTISH CUP LEAGUE CUP EUROPE TOTAL 1989-91 52 8 5 1 66 Goals: 2 0 3 0 5\n\nHonours with Celtic\n\nnone\n\nPictures\n\nKDS forum\n\nArticles\n\nLinks\n\nQuotes\n\n\u201cI had the privilege of playing against Van Basten and Maradona, but in terms of my most talented team-mates, there was a Brazilian called Carlos Verri, better known as Brazilian legend Dunga and Paul McStay at Celtic.\u201d\n\nPaul Elliott (link)\n\n\u201cThe racial abuse I\u2019ve suffered in Scotland is far worse than anything I had to put up with in England or Italy.\u201d\n\nPaul Elliott (1989)\n\n\n\n\u201c[Best achievement in football] Breaking into the Chelsea team or being voted Scottish Player of the Year (1991) by my fellow professionals.

He has set a wonderful precedent \u2013 yet that wasn\u2019t even his intention.\n\n\u201cHis intention was to pick people on their ability and it just so happened they were black. They have the quality he requires to be in his team.\n\n\u201cHowever, in Scotland some of the racist stuff does still go on and I hope the football authorities and the players\u2019 union start to make better use of the legislation in place to deal with it.\n\n\u201cDown south, there\u2019s been a lot more progress made and that\u2019s been because of the work done by the players\u2019 union, the Commission for Racial Equality, the FA and the Premier League.\n\n\u201cScotland has caught on to that now. But before, there wasn\u2019t the required level of commitment.\n\n\u201cIn an ideal world, you would want the same vigour displayed in the battle against sectarianism to be applied to racism.\n\n\u201cYou also want your own supporters to take more responsibility, because we are talking about a minority. I\u2019ve always said the majority in Scotland are very, very decent and honourable people.\u201d\n\nElliott spoke out yesterday as English football pondered remarks made by Spurs striker Teddy Sheringham.\n\nThe ex-England star dared to suggest that white youngsters could struggle to succeed in the game because of \u201cbigger, stronger and quicker\u201d black players.\n\nIn the initial frenzy of reaction, some claimed his comments could be exploited by racists.\n\nBut among those to defend him for stating a fact were England great and ex-Celtic boss John Barnes and Elliott, who works tirelessly for the CRE.\n\nElliott knows more about the lion\u2019s den than most. He broke new ground as a black footballer in England, Italy and Scotland, before finishing his career at Chelsea, where a section of fans are associated with right-wing extremism.\n\nAnd it delights him to see how Scottish football has finally woken up to the talents offered by ethnic minority stars, even if we only have a fraction of the number in England.\n\nThere, at least 15 per cent of the 2500 registered players are non-white.\n\nJUMPING to Sheringham\u2019s defence, he said: \u201cTeddy is qualified to make such a statement. He has an impeccable CV as an international player and I think it\u2019s a very important point.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the context of what he said, it\u2019s a very professional observation.\n\n\u201cYes, there\u2019s been a massive increase in the number of black players in Britain for commercial and financial reasons, as the talent pours into the country.\n\n\u201cBut, from a professional point of view, the modern day player needs to be very strong, to be an athlete, to have pace, more than ever before.\n\n\u201cThese are fundamental requirements of being a top-class player nowadays.\n\n\u201cAnd, yes, I would have to acknowledge that the development of black talent is quite mesmerising.\n\n\u201cWhen I started out, we were getting bananas thrown at us and now they play with such a carefree, confident manner.\n\n\u201cThe difference is, I had to deal with racism and then concentrate on my job.\u201d\n\nOn arrival at Parkhead from Italy, he became the second black Old Firm player of the modern era, after Mark Walters at Rangers.\n\nBut it says a lot about the complexities of the west of Scotland psyche that more of a fuss was made about Roman Catholic ex- Celt Mo Johnston signing for Rangers than the Walters signing.\n\nElliott added: \u201cThe most difficult experiences I encountered in Scotland were when we played Hearts and Hibs.\n\n\u201cI loved Old Firm games \u2013 I felt safer during them than in any other matches.\n\n\u201cI was lucky because there was more pressure on Mo Johnston than myself and Mark Walters.\n\n\u201cWhen myself and Mark came to the two biggest clubs in Scotland, I think it made a big impact and went a long way towards helping those who followed.\n\n\u201cWe were the turning point, because after that there was quite an influx of black players in Scotland.\u201d\n\nWhen Elliott played at Luton in 1983 they had seven black players in the team, which raised a lot of eyebrows.\n\nBut he believes that even now, six black players playing in Scotland for Celtic has made a greater impact.\n\n\u201cYou have to respect Martin O\u2019Neill because his judgment is purely football- related. But I also have a lot of respect for Alex McLeish.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s looking at a player, first and foremost he\u2019s looking at his talent. It\u2019s wonderful you\u2019ve got two very powerful and decent human beings who are not getting caught up in bigotry or judging someone by their race, colour or creed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an issue to those managers and that can only be good for Scotland.\u201d\n\nAS well as the Parkhead contingent, Rangers have also welcomed black players including Russell Latapy and Marcus Gayle.\n\nOthers have become crucial players at Hearts, Hibs, Aberdeen, Livingston, Motherwell and elsewhere.\n\nMark de Vries, Kevin Harper and Eugene Dadi have all made their marks on the Scottish game.\n\nIt\u2019s all good news for Elliott, who travels the country spreading a wise message.\n\nAn intelligent communicator, he also helps front the anti-racism campaign Kick It Out, part of a UK- wide initiative to kick racism into touch.\n\nIn Scotland, its catchphrase is: \u201cShow racism the red card.\u201d The Executive, the SFA and teaching union EIS have thrown their weight behind the scheme.\n\nElliott said: \u201cA big part of my work involves going to universities, colleges and football clubs talking to kids and adults about racism and ways to eradicate it.\n\n\u201cBoth racism and sectarianism are an inherited way of life and the fundamental way to deal with them is education, starting with children in the classroom.\n\n\u201cThe intolerance is all recycled and there\u2019s no break in the cycle. You have to re- educate and while it has worked down south, you can\u2019t be complacent.\u201d\n\nFew are more qualified to offer a considered opinion than a player who faced racism in three different countries.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think my destiny has taken me into difficult places to set different precedents.\n\n\u201cIt was only recently that I\u2019ve considered my career path and the way it went and luckily I had a reasonable level of success at all of the clubs.\n\n\u201cSo I can use those experiences to put forward my opinions in a very constructive way.\n\n\u201cMy career started in 1980. I was part of the second generation of black players in England and at that point racism was prevalent. There was an insular, negative attitude about black players.\n\n\u201cI was in the Charlton first team at 16 and we were going to the north of England, to Newcastle, Carlisle, places like that, and the ignorance there was worse than anywhere I\u2019ve been \u2013 even worse than in Scotland.\n\n\u201cWhat prepares a 16-year-old for that? I was aware of it socially but I never had many confrontations to deal with and then all of a sudden I\u2019m thrown into an arena where people are behaving like that and getting away with it.\u201d\n\nBack then, the idea of a single black player in Scotland\u2019s top flight seemed a million miles away. Six in one line- up was out of the question.\n\nElliott said: \u201cNowadays football, like society, is multi-cultural, multi- racial.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that Scottish football attacks any racism which still exists with the same vigour given to sectarianism.\n\n\u201cI would like the people inside the game to really be very positive because you\u2019ve seen the benefits in society in Scotland as a result.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m able to walk along the streets here and see people of all races, colours and creeds enjoying being here.\n\n\u201cSport is a great way to encourage that and change attitudes because it brings people together.\u201d\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2003 Scottish Daily Record & Sunday"}, {"url": "https://takemeback.to/28-April-1964", "page_content": "Old Newspapers from April 28, 1964\n\nBrowse US newspapers from April 28, 1964\n\nDiscover UK newspaper headlines from April 28, 1964\n\nOld Magazines from April 28, 1964\n\nBrowse your vintage magazines from April 28, 1964\n\nLooking for other vintage memories?\n\nLook at our old newspapers and magazines page\n\nSee also\n\nWhat happened on April 28 in history?

Within this structure the party accords rights of representation to its members through various affiliated organizations. These organizations include the constituency Labour parties (CLPs), which are responsible for recruiting and organizing members in each of the country\u2019s parliamentary constituencies; affiliated trade unions, which traditionally have had an important role in party affairs; the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP), comprising Labour members of Parliament; and a variety of small socialist groups such as the Fabian Society. Delegates from these organizations meet in an annual conference, where they are given formal authority in policy-making matters. The Labour Party\u2019s various ancillary bodies (such as the women\u2019s and youth sections) are also entitled to representation at the annual conference, and a number of individuals attend in ex officio capacity\u2014including members of Parliament and parliamentary candidates. One of the principal functions of the annual conference is to elect the National Executive Committee (NEC), which oversees the party\u2019s day-to-day affairs. Twelve members of the NEC are elected by trade union delegates, seven by CLPs, five by women delegates, one by youth delegates, and one by delegates from affiliated socialist societies.\n\nNotwithstanding the formal sovereignty of the annual conference, policy making in the Labour Party historically has been dominated by coalitions of parliamentary elites and major trade union leaders. On occasion, however, this moderate establishment has lost ground to radical trade unionists and activists from the CLPs. As a result, since 1987 the parliamentary leadership has attempted to reassert its authority through a series of organizational reforms approved and supported by moderate trade union leaders. In the electoral college that selects the party leader, for example, the proportion of votes controlled by the unions was reduced from 40 percent to one-third; the other two-thirds were divided equally between the PLP and the CLPs. Trade unions also used to control 40 percent of the vote in the local electoral colleges that selected candidates for Parliament, but since 1987 those candidates have been chosen by a simple ballot of local party members. In the annual conference the proportion of delegates controlled by the unions, at one time more than 90 percent, was reduced to a maximum of 50 percent.\n\nAnother product of structural reform is the National Policy Forum, a body that effectively decreases the influence of the annual conference and reduces the voice of grassroots activists. The forum is divided into a number of smaller policy commissions, which are made up of appointed members and coordinated by a Cabinet minister (or, when the party is in opposition, by a shadow minister). The function of each commission is to produce policy reports for inspection by the forum and the NEC and for approval by the annual conference. Policy reports must be approved or rejected as a block, and affiliated organizations may not propose policy resolutions while issues are being deliberated by a commission.\n\nPrior to World War II, Labour\u2019s electoral support was based largely on blue-collar workers and middle-class socialists. Since the 1960s, sections of the middle class who worked in the public sector joined the coalition. After 1979 the Labour vote became heavily regionalized and concentrated in industrial areas of Scotland, South Wales, and northern England, though the renovation of the party leading up to the electoral victory of 1997 succeeded in restoring significant support in urban areas across southern England. Approximately two-thirds of Labour\u2019s vote still comes from blue-collar workers, though they account for only about one-third of the party\u2019s membership. Individual membership, which stood at about 350,000 at the end of the 1990s, has declined since 1960, though there was an upsurge during Blair\u2019s first years as party leader.\n\nFor financial support, the party has relied heavily on its trade union affiliates throughout its history. Since the early 1990s, attempts have been made to reduce this dependence, though the degree of change has not been significant. About half of the Labour Party\u2019s income is derived from union sources; the remainder comes from individual members, a variety of wealthy donors, and modest returns on investments. Although union members already were able to opt out of automatic political financial contributions that were going primarily to the Labour Party, in July 2013 party leader Ed Miliband proposed that those contributions become nonautomatic, or a matter of opting in. The party\u2019s increasingly close ties to British corporations under Blair\u2019s leadership provoked anger from the trade unions, some of which took steps to end their association with the party, including beginning talks in 2002 with the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/31/post-brexit-economic-crisis-labour-eu-britain", "page_content": "Plenty of people \u2013 on the left as well as the right \u2013 believed George Osborne when he conjured up a dystopian vision of Britain after a vote for Brexit during the final weeks of the referendum campaign. The then chancellor said victory for leave would result in a \u201cDIY recession\u201d, the loss of 800,000 jobs, a weaker housing market and a stock market crash. Two years on from our date of departure from the EU, none of it has happened.\n\nUnemployment is lower than it was in 2016 and, although this is very much a mixed blessing, house prices are higher. Share prices have risen and until Covid-19 arrived there was no recession. That hasn\u2019t halted the flow of gloomy predictions: Nissan would quit the UK, tens of thousands of City jobs would be lost to Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam. More recently, Brexit supply chain problems would mean a turkey-less Christmas and empty high street shelves in December. None of that happened either, and the wait for economic meltdown goes on.\n\nFar from quitting the UK, Nissan last year announced it was investing \u00a31bn in electric vehicle production at its Sunderland plant. Children didn\u2019t wake up to empty Christmas stockings. A study by the consultancy EY found almost nine out of 10 global financial services firms plan to establish or expand operations in the UK this year.\n\nConfirmation bias is where people latch on to evidence that suits their argument while zoning out things that don\u2019t. Opponents of Brexit, for example, filter out the success of the UK\u2019s go-it-alone vaccine procurement strategy and the freedom the government now has to cut VAT on domestic energy bills.\n\nBrexit supporters, by contrast, point out that UK exports to the EU in the second half of 2021 varied little from their level in the same period of 2020 when trade was still frictionless, but ignore the fact that other countries performed more strongly last year as lockdown restrictions were eased. Likewise, they downplay the loss of share trading to Amsterdam and the UK\u2019s poor investment performance after the Brexit vote.\n\nStripped of the social media spats, the reality is that Brexit has not magically transformed Britain\u2019s economic prospects, but nor has it been calamitous. From a big-picture perspective, Britain\u2019s economy will exit Covid-19 looking pretty much the same as when the virus first arrived two years ago, even though the UK left the single market and the customs union in the meantime. Unemployment is little different, interest rates are a little lower, the housing market is hot. The big difference is that inflation is a lot higher, as it is in every developed country.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the transition from EU membership has been seamless or cost free. It has been a burden that small exporting businesses could have done without at any time, let alone when seeking to cope with the impact of a global pandemic.\n\nBut the response to Covid-19 has proved two things: businesses adapt to changed circumstances pretty quickly, and that process can be accelerated by supportive government policy. The models suggesting the damage from Brexit will be permanent rather than transitional are flawed for two reasons: they are based on a number of questionable \u2013 and often neoliberal \u2013 assumptions; and they envisage life goes on as before, with no change in behaviour either by the private sector or the state.\n\nThere is a parallel here with the aim of \u201cgreening\u201d the economy. Clearly, there will be costs from decarbonising the economy, but supporters of the net zero target think these can be mitigated by activist government, and see the opportunity to break with a broken model.\n\nThere are those for whom this represents a false parallel because there can be no possible benefits from leaving the EU. For them it is only a matter of time before the doomsday scenario comes about, and therefore the only way ahead is for Britain to rejoin.\n\nBut this strategy would only work if one of the two main parties supported it, and neither of them do. The most significant Brexit development of the past two years has not been economic but political: the decision by Keir Starmer to accept that the left needed to come up with its own plan for a post-EU Britain.\n\nInterviewed by my colleague Simon Hattenstone, Starmer could not have been clearer: \u201cLook, we\u2019ve left the EU. There\u2019s no case for rejoining so we have to make it work. We are out, and we\u2019re staying out.\u201d Asked whether that ruled out a return to the single market or customs union under a Labour government he went on: \u201cYes, it does. We\u2019ve got to make Brexit work from the outside and not reopen old wounds.\u201d\n\nRachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said the same when she recently outlined her five-point plan for the economy. For Labour, Brexit is a done deal, and accepting that has meant it has been Reeves, who supported remain in 2016, rather than Rishi Sunak, who backed leave, who has been making the case to cut VAT on energy bills.\n\nLabour\u2019s new stance makes sense, and not just because it gives the party a chance of winning the next election. Until recently there were only two options: a wasted-opportunity Brexit where nothing much happens and the economy trundles along much as before; and a rightwing free-market Brexit. Now there\u2019s a third: a Labour Brexit in which the state uses its new powers to build a greener, fairer, levelled-up Britain."}, {"url": "https://labour.org.uk/people/unions/", "page_content": "The Labour Party was formed out of the trade union movement to give working people their own political voice.

TLA WENN Photos\n\nLast year, socialist stalwart Jeremy Corbyn won the leadership of the UK\u2019s Labour Party by a landslide.\n\nSince then, there has been a steady flow of claims by Israel\u2019s supporters that Corbyn has not done enough to combat anti-Semitism.\n\nThis has only accelerated in the lead-up to a major test for Corbyn, the UK local elections on 5 May.\n\nEven as this story was in preparation, two more victims were claimed in the war against his leadership.\n\nLawmaker Naz Shah and the former mayor of London, long-time Palestine campaigner Ken Livingstone, were also suspended from the party \u2013 within hours of being accused of anti-Semitism.\n\nBut an investigation by The Electronic Intifada has found that some of the most prominent stories about anti-Semitism in the party are falsified.\n\nThe Electronic Intifada can reveal that a key player in Labour\u2019s \u201canti-Semitism crisis\u201d covered up his involvement in the Israel lobby.\n\nMost Labour members so accused are in reality being attacked for expressing opinions in favor of Palestinian human rights and particularly for supporting the boycott of Israel.\n\nLabour activists, many of them Jews, have told The Electronic Intifada that false accusations of anti-Semitism are being used as a weapon against Corbyn by the party\u2019s right-wing.\n\nCorbyn has been active in the Palestine solidarity movement for more than three decades. In an interview with The Electronic Intifada last year, he endorsed key elements of the Palestinian call for a boycott of Israel. For example, he urged an end to weapons trading with Israel.\n\nHis election represented a radical shift in Labour, a popular revolt at the grassroots membership level.\n\nAlthough Labour\u2019s membership has grown since Corbyn\u2019s victory, he has been under constant attack from right-leaning politicians within the party. In an attempt to weaken his position, some of his critics have manufactured a \u201ccrisis\u201d about alleged anti-Semitism.\n\nAttacks on Corbyn have escalated in the lead-up to next week\u2019s local elections. Poor results would be seized upon by his enemies within the party.\n\nWitch hunt\n\nCharley Allan, a Jewish member of the party, and a Morning Star columnist, has described the current atmosphere in the press and Labour Party as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nIt has reached such an absurd volume that any usage of the word \u201cZionist\u201d is deemed to be anti-Semitic \u2013 although tellingly not when used by self-described Zionists.\n\nWhere real instances of anti-Jewish bigotry have come to light, the leadership and party machine have taken robust action.\n\nAccording to The Spectator, the party\u2019s general secretary Iain McNicol told a recent meeting of Labour lawmakers that everyone who had been reported for anti-Semitism had either been suspended or excluded.\n\nCorbyn has responded to the media storm by repeatedly condemning anti-Semitism and saying that anyone making an anti-Semitic remark is \u201cauto-excluded from the party.\u201d\n\nJohn McDonnell, the shadow finance minister and a long-standing Corbyn ally, told The Independent that any party member found by an investigation to be expressing anti-Semitic views should be expelled for life. \u201cIf people express these views, full stop they\u2019re out,\u201d McDonnell said.\n\nSmears\n\nSmears of anti-Semitism against Corbyn started even before he was elected.\n\nDuring his leadership campaign in the summer of 2015, the establishment media worked itself into a frenzy of anti-Corbyn hysteria, led more than any other paper by the liberal Guardian.\n\nOne of the recurring themes in this campaign was Corbyn\u2019s long-standing support for Palestinian human rights.\n\nBecause of this, attempts were made to say outright, or to imply, that Corbyn was a secret anti-Semite, or that he associated with, or tolerated \u201cnotorious\u201d anti-Semites.\n\nAlthough these hit jobs gained some traction, they were soon debunked, and ultimately seemed to have little impact on the leadership election.\n\nThis dishonest theme is now being revisited. In February, the slow drip of anti-Semitism scare stories burst into a flood.\n\nOxford\n\nAn \u201canti-Semitism scandal\u201d erupted in the Oxford University Labour Club \u2013 an association of student supporters of the party.\n\nAlex Chalmers posing with Labour MP Caroline Flint in a photo taken from his Facebook. A failed candidate for deputy leader, Flint is a leading voice in Progress, a right-wing Labour faction.\n\nIn a public Facebook posting Alex Chalmers, the co-chair of the club, resigned his position over what he claimed was anti-Semitic behavior in \u201ca large proportion\u201d of the student Labour club \u201cand the student left in Oxford more generally.\u201d\n\nBut as evidence he cited the club\u2019s decision, in a majority vote, to endorse Oxford\u2019s Israeli Apartheid Week, an annual awareness-raising exercise by student groups which support Palestinian rights.\n\nThis connection was clearly designed to smear Palestine solidarity activists as anti-Semites \u2013 a standard tactic of the Israel lobby.\n\nIn fact, the similarity was no coincidence.\n\nThe Electronic Intifada can reveal for the first time evidence that Chalmers himself has been part of the UK\u2019s Israel lobby.\n\nChalmers has worked for BICOM, the Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre.\n\nFunded by the billionaire Poju Zabludowicz, BICOM is a leading pro-Israel group in London.\n\nChalmers once listed an internship with BICOM on his LinkedIn profile, although the page was deleted some time in February.\n\nBut even were this key fact not known, Chalmers\u2019 accusations were not credible.\n\nNo one specific was named in his Facebook posting. He claimed that shortening the word Zionist to \u201cZio\u201d and expressing support for the Palestinian political party and resistance organization Hamas were enough to prove anti-Semitism.\n\nChalmers did not reply to an emailed request for comment. He set his Twitter profile to private the day after the email was sent by The Electronic Intifada.\n\nOne of his tweets from 2014 sought to smear The Electronic Intifada with \u201cIslamism.\u201d\n\nChalmers has also been accused of disseminating a false allegation that a left-wing Labour student at Oxford had organized people into a group to follow a Jewish student around campus calling her a \u201cfilthy Zionist,\u201d and that he had been disciplined as a result.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, the accused student said that he had reason to believe Chalmers may have been behind the dissemination of this smear.\n\nPaul Di Felice, the current acting principal of the Oxford college in question, confirmed to The Electronic Intifada the authenticity of a statement from its late principal denying all the allegations. \u201cI have found no evidence of any allegations being made to the college about\u201d the student \u201cinvolving anti-Semitism, or indeed anything else, during his time at the college,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThe Electronic Intifada put all this to Alex Chalmers in an email, but he failed to reply.\n\nDirty tricks\n\nThe Oxford University Labour Club responded with a statement saying it was \u201chorrified\u201d at the accusations and would fully cooperate with an investigation launched by the party organization Labour Students.\n\nIt did not take long, however, for someone to leak names to the right-wing press.\n\nCiting an anonymous \u201csource at the club,\u201d The Telegraph named two left-wingers at Oxford who were supposedly \u201cbeing investigated over alleged anti-Semitism at Oxford University.\u201d\n\nAgain, there were no further details. Chalmers\u2019 dubious and obviously politicized accusations were raised in general terms.\n\nOne of the two, James Elliott, was a vocal advocate at Oxford University of BDS, the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel, and was photographed in the Telegraph article sitting next to Corbyn.\n\nBut in an email to a Daily Mail journalist, seen by The Electronic Intifada, Chalmers privately admitted that Elliott wasn\u2019t involved. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard any allegations relating to him,\u201d Chalmers wrote.\n\nBoth activists named by The Telegraph are part of Momentum, the grouping founded by Labour left-wingers in the wake of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election victory to support his leadership.\n\nThe Electronic Intifada has seen evidence of a whispering campaign against the activists at Oxford. A dossier of allegations against the student Labour club is said to have been filed with the union\u2019s Jewish society.\n\nThat society has posted a summary of the dossier on Facebook.\n\nAsked in an email if he had been behind the dossier or the press leaks, Chalmers did not reply.\n\nHit pieces\n\nAlex Chalmers\u2019 Facebook post resigning from the Oxford University Labour Club was seized on by anti-Corbyn forces aiming to influence key internal elections to the Labour Party\u2019s youth wing, in which the Momentum pair were both candidates.\n\nOn 19 February, the Guardian reported that Momentum candidates had swept the board in Young Labour\u2019s elections, conducted by online ballot.\n\nThe Telegraph published its highly dubious hit piece four days later.\n\nAt the Young Labour conference the following weekend, several other positions remained to be elected. Elliott stood for the youth representative on Labour\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC).\n\nAfter the smear campaign against him, Momentum candidate Elliott lost to right-wing Labour First candidate Jasmin Beckett \u2013 by only a tenth of a percentage point.\n\nBut Beckett was caught carrying out a dirty tricks campaign against Elliott.\n\nAs a result, a formal complaint has been submitted calling for her to be disqualified from the NEC.\n\nThe smear campaign drew on right-wing media insinuations against the Momentum pair at Oxford.\n\nBeckett did not reply to an emailed request for comment.\n\n\u201cGo hard\u201d\n\nAs first revealed by Morning Star, Beckett urged supporters to \u201cget a few people tweeting\u201d allegations against Elliott.\n\nBut because such negative campaigning is against Labour rules, Beckett cautioned supporters to distance themselves from her. She asked her supporters to remove \u201ctwibbons\u201d \u2013 promotional badges for her election campaign \u2013 from their social media accounts before making allegations against Elliott.\n\nOne supporter, Josh Woolas \u2013 son of former Labour MP Phil Woolas \u2013 cautioned it \u201cneeds to look like a genuine complaint about racism and not a smear campaign!\u201d\n\nIn a Facebook group chat titled #TeamJB (viewable in full on the Labour blog Left Futures, edited by the chair of Momentum), Beckett encouraged other young Labour members to share unsubstantiated hit pieces on Elliott from right-wing media.\n\nShe asked \u201cdo you actually want an anti-Semite as NEC rep?\u201d She suggested her friends \u201cget a few people tweeting saying \u2018shocked my union GMB are supporting James Elliott who is anti-Semitic\u2019 or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just get it out there,\u201d agreed Labour activist Tom Jennings. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a huge opportunity \u2026 thus shaving off votes for him at [the Young Labour] conference.\u201d\n\nInvestigation\n\nThe complaint against Beckett was subsequently rolled into another investigation into Chalmers\u2019 allegations of anti-Semitism at Oxford, one ultimately taken over by Janet Royall, the Labour leader in the House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber of the UK parliament.\n\nLabour Students conducted a hasty investigation into the Oxford allegations. But, Labour activists told The Electronic Intifada, it was so obviously botched that it was not credible.\n\nThat investigation was led by Michael Rubin, Labour Students\u2019 national chairperson \u2013 who happened to be the boyfriend of one of Beckett\u2019s allies, Rachel Holland. Holland was part of Beckett\u2019s dirty tricks campaign, expressing support for it in the #TeamJB group chat.\n\nElliott told The Electronic Intifada he could not comment until the Royall investigation is concluded.\n\nThat seems unlikely to happen until after the crucial local elections at the earliest, and probably not until the summer, the BBC says, when Beckett is due to take her seat on the NEC.\n\nThe witch hunt expanded.\n\n\u201cFresh row\u201d\n\nIn March, Huffington Post talked up a \u201cfresh row over Labour anti-Semitism.\u201d\n\nThe website referred to how union official Jennie Formby had allegedly pointed out at a meeting of Labour\u2019s NEC that Royall once took part in a sponsored trip to the Middle East organized by Labour Friends of Israel, a pressure group within the party.\n\nFormby has successfully pushed at the NEC to have private security firm G4S banned from Labour conferences, due to its supply of equipment to Israeli prisons that practice torture against Palestinians.\n\nThe Jewish Chronicle claimed Unite\u2019s Jennie Formby was \u201cto be moved from her role partly as a result of her anti-Israel activism.\u201d It cited no evidence.\n\nThe paper claimed the move represented a demotion by the union, the UK\u2019s largest.\n\nBut the report was instantly denied by Formby and her union.\n\nFormby said she never questioned Royall\u2019s ability to conduct the investigation.\n\nIn fact, Formby said, she was appointed to the new job long before Chalmers made his allegations on Facebook.\n\n@stephenkb JF applied for the post 5 months ago. It is a promotion. She will remain on the NEC. Please check facts. \u2014 Unite the union (@unitetheunion) March 11, 2016\n\nBut the narrative was already out there.\n\nTony Greenstein\n\nIn March, the witch hunt reached Tony Greenstein, a Jewish anti-Zionist well known in Palestine solidarity circles.\n\nDespite supporting other left-wing parties in the past, Greenstein had joined the Labour Party after the election of Corbyn, hoping it would take a new, leftward direction.\n\nBut on 18 March he received a letter from the party\u2019s Compliance Unit (also known as the Constitutional Unit) saying that his membership had been suspended pending an investigation into a possible breach of party rules.\n\n\u201cThese allegations relate to comments you are alleged to have made,\u201d wrote John Stolliday, head of the unit. Greenstein asked to see the allegations against him, but his request was denied.\n\nAlthough the party refused to let Greenstein know what he was being accused of, further vague allegations were leaked to the right-wing press.\n\nIn April, The Telegraph published a story citing Greenstein\u2019s admittance to the party as the \u201clatest anti-Semitism scandal\u201d to hit Labour.\n\nGreenstein says he is considering legal action.\n\nThe Telegraph later added a \u201cclarification\u201d saying it wanted \u201cto make clear that we had not intended to imply that Tony Greenstein is anti-Semitic.\u201d\n\nIt would, however, be difficult to read the article as intending to do anything else.\n\nIronically, Greenstein has been at the forefront of moves to combat genuine cases of anti-Semitism on the fringes of the Palestine solidarity movement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to fight\u201d\n\nFor years Greenstein has been perhaps the most vocal foe in the UK of Gilad Atzmon \u2013 an Israeli jazz musician based in London who claims to express solidarity with Palestinians, even while opposing the BDS movement and relentlessly attacking activists.\n\nFour years ago, Atzmon was criticized by prominent members of the Palestine movement over racism and anti-Semitism in his work.\n\nAlso in 2012, a Holocaust denier was expelled from the UK\u2019s Palestine Solidarity Campaign.\n\nGreenstein has written that he is the person who had first reported the Holocaust denier to the PSC.\n\nThe Compliance Unit has also been behind the expulsion of many new Jeremy Corbyn voters accused of being \u201chard left\u201d or \u201cinfiltrators.\u201d\n\nIn February, John McDonnell, the shadow finance minister, called for the unit to be scrapped.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to fight it of course,\u201d Greenstein told The Electronic Intifada. He also accused the Compliance Unit itself of being behind the leaks \u2013 The Telegraph article cited \u201cevidence compiled\u201d by the unit.\n\nLabour\u2019s general secretary wrote to Greenstein denying this.\n\n\u201cCorbyn hasn\u2019t got a grip on the [party] machine, that\u2019s part of the problem,\u201d said Greenstein.\n\nIsrael lobby\n\nOne of the people at the forefront of the witch hunt has been Jeremy Newmark, now the chairperson of the Jewish Labour Movement.\n\nThe JLM is affiliated to the UK Labour Party, the Israeli Labor Party and the World Zionist Organization \u2013 according to the UN, the latter pumps millions into building in the occupied West Bank through its settlement division.\n\nNewmark has for years been active in the Israel lobby\u2019s anti-Palestinian campaigns in the UK.\n\nHe was previously the chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council, an anti-Palestinian lobbying group behind numerous attacks on BDS.\n\nDuring his tenure, the group invested huge efforts in an attempt to sue the University and College Union for \u201canti-Semitism\u201d after some members proposed discussing the academic boycott of Israel.\n\nNewmark was left with egg on his face, however, when in 2013 a tribunal judge ruled against the case on all counts.\n\nThe judge found it was \u201cdevoid of any merit\u201d and \u201can impermissible attempt to achieve a political end by litigious means.\u201d\n\nThe judge criticized Newmark personally for a \u201cdisturbing\u201d attempt to crush free speech in the union. He also found that that Newmark\u2019s evidence to the tribunal was \u201cpreposterous\u201d and \u201cuntrue.\u201d\n\nGiven all this, media should treat Newmark\u2019s claims about anti-Semitism in Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party with caution.\n\nInstead they\u2019ve been buying it all.\n\nIn The Telegraph hit piece on Greenstein, Newmark claimed the affair was a sign of Corbyn being \u201cimpotent\u201d over anti-Semitism.\n\nHe also told BBC Radio 4\u2019s influential Today program this month that the party was not doing enough about anti-Semitism.\n\nNone of these journalists disclosed Newmark\u2019s long-standing role in the Israel lobby, or his record of lying about anti-Semitism.\n\nRight-wing Labour\n\nThere is a large crossover between right-wing, anti-Corbyn Labour and the pro-Israel lobby within the party.\n\nRight-wing Labour MP Wes Streeting has participated in Israeli government efforts to cast Palestine solidarity as \u201cevil.\u201d (The Leadership Foundation/Flickr)\n\nOne example is Labour lawmaker Wes Streeting, also an Israel lobby stalwart.\n\nStreeting appeared on the same radio segment as Newmark. The right-wing Labour MP claimed that \u201cwe\u2019ve now got a problem\u201d that people think the party is \u201capathetic to anti-Semitism.\u201d\n\nStreeting has a long history in Progress, a right-wing faction within the party that continues to support former prime minister Tony Blair.\n\nOne of Progress\u2019 leading supporters has described the group as \u201can unaccountable faction\u201d dominated by the \u201csecretive billionaire\u201d Lord Sainsbury.\n\nIn 2009, when he was president of the National Union of Students, Streeting attended an anti-BDS working group in Jerusalem.\n\nThe visit was organized by the Israeli foreign ministry, which slandered the BDS movement as \u201cevil.\u201d\n\nAs an MP, Streeting has been consistently hostile to Corbyn.\n\nTerm of abuse\n\nStreeting and Newmark are arguing for tougher action and changes to the party\u2019s rules.\n\nThe head of Progress proposed rule changes in the Mirror which would put \u201ca modern understanding of anti-Semitism\u201d into the party. \u201cIt is not acceptable to use the term \u2018Zionism\u2019 as a term of abuse,\u201d the article stated, arguing for people who did so to be expelled.\n\nThis proposal echoes efforts pushed by Israel lobby groups, including at the University of California, to legislate that opposition to Zionism \u2013 Israel\u2019s state ideology \u2013 is itself a form of anti-Semitism.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, a Labour Party staffer told The Electronic Intifada that, even were the rule change to pass, such expulsions would still have to be approved by the NEC.\n\nThe staffer emphasized that for many within the party, concerns about incidences of anti-Semitism were genuine.\n\nBut the member of staff said that for the \u201cnon-Jewish Zionists\u201d in groups like Progress, \u201canti-Semitism is just a tool\u201d in \u201ca field of battle\u201d to \u201csmash up Jeremy at all costs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever gets agreed will not be good enough\u201d for them, the member of staff said.\n\nStreeting did not reply to emails requesting comment.\n\nFive cases\n\nLabour is a mass membership organization, which now has more than 380,000 full members, according to party figures.\n\nThe staff member said that, amid all the politicized attacks in recent months, there had been about five actual cases of alleged anti-Semitism within the party.\n\nA 2015 survey by Pew found that seven percent of the UK public held \u201cunfavorable\u201d views of Jews. By contrast, about a fifth held negative views of Muslims and almost two-fifths viewed Roma people unfavorably.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence to suggest that such views are any more prevalent in the Labour Party \u2013 and the tiny number of anti-Semitism complaints suggests they may well be less so in a movement many of whose activists have been in the frontline of anti-racist struggles.\n\nThe staff member said that in the five or so cases that had come to its attention, the party had taken swift action to expel, or suspend the membership of those alleged to have made anti-Semitic comments.\n\nOne of the most prominent of these was Vicki Kirby, a Labour Party candidate in Woking who is alleged to have tweeted that Israel is \u201cevil.\u201d\n\nShe also reacted to Israel\u2019s 2014 war on Gaza by tweeting in August: \u201cWho is the Zionist God? I am starting to think it may be Hitler. #FreePalestine.\u201d\n\nThat assault resulted in 2,251 dead Palestinians, including 1,462 civilians, 551 of whom were children, according to an independent inquiry commissioned by the UN.\n\nKirby\u2019s comments led to her suspension from the Labour Party in 2014.\n\nSpeaking to the media for the first time, Kirby told The Electronic Intifada that her choice of words had been \u201cawful\u201d and \u201cappalling.\u201d It was \u201ca reaction. I didn\u2019t think it through. I\u2019m not a born politician,\u201d she said.\n\nLater, still under the leadership of Corbyn\u2019s predecessor, Kirby\u2019s suspension from the party was lifted. But, after Corbyn became leader, somebody leaked a photo of Kirby posing with Corbyn to the party\u2019s enemies in the media.\n\nDoctored tweet\n\nThe hard-right gossip blogger known as Guido Fawkes, then proceeded to trawl through her entire Twitter backlog. He found a Tweet from 2011, a time when Kirby says she was not even in the Labour Party.\n\nGuido Fawkes then doctored a screenshot of the tweet, making it appear as if she had tweeted \u201cWhat do you know abt Jews? They\u2019ve got big noses and support spurs lol.\u201d The screenshot of the Tweet on Guido\u2019s site has clearly been cropped.\n\nBut Kirby says this was one of a series of tweets of quotes from the 2010 comedy film The Infidel.\n\nKirby provided The Electronic Intifada with evidence \u2013 a portion of a spreadsheet of her Twitter archive \u2013 showing that the original tweet concluded with the hashtag #TheInfidel.\n\nThe writer of the film David Baddiel confirmed this on Twitter at the time, even tweeting this to a Guido Fawkes blogger.\n\n@WikiGuido That first one: she's quoting a character from my movie The Infidel. \u2014 David Baddiel (@Baddiel) March 14, 2016\n\nKirby says she has received \u201cdeath threats\u201d to her and \u201chate email\u201d from around the world, including the wish that \u201cyour children get cancer and die.\u201d She says she even had to take legal actions against a constant barrage of journalists door-stepping her and harassing her family.\n\nDespite swift party action to suspend Kirby once again, the incident was still weaponized by the right.\n\n\u201cJeremy Corbyn needs to answer some serious questions,\u201d Streeting told the Mirror.\n\nStoking the flames\n\nWriting in the Jewish Chronicle, Momentum founder Jon Lansman \u2013 a key Corbyn ally \u2013 said that \u201cmy Jewish identity and anti-Semitism are at the core of my left Labour politics and so I welcome an investigation into anti-Semitism at Oxford University.\u201d\n\nBut Lansman cautioned that \u201cwithin the Labour Party, some people have factional reasons for stoking the flames.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that \u201cracism, including anti-Semitism\u201d had historically been part of the Labour movement. \u201cIt was not until the 1980s that the efforts to eradicate it became serious, and that was thanks in part to Ken Livingstone as leader of the Greater London Council,\u201d Lansman added.\n\nDuring that period, Livingstone, and what the right derided as the \u201clooney left\u201d in local government, became the prime targets of Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. But with her party unable to defeat Livingstone at the ballot box, she simply abolished London\u2019s city-wide government altogether.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the Blair years that the capital once again had a London-wide government and Livingstone was elected mayor. It would now seem that with his suspension, the Thatcherite campaign against Livingstone has resumed, but this time from within the Labour Party.\n\nIan Saville, who started the group Jews For Jeremy and then later joined the party, told The Electronic Intifada that \u201csome in the Labour Party, who do not have an understanding of the complexities of the situation, take [the accusations of prejudice] at face value, and quite understandably wish to oppose anti-Semitism.\u201d\n\nHe said that \u201cunfortunately, this \u2018opposition\u2019 to anti-Semitism has support of Israel and Zionism bundled in with it, so it fulfills the double purpose of isolating the left and supporting Israel uncritically.\u201d\n\nGreenstein wrote that \u201cfalse allegations of anti-Semitism are akin to the boy who cried wolf. They immunize people against the real thing. As a Jewish anti-Zionist my main experience of anti-Semitism is from Zionists \u2026 I have even been told that it was a pity I didn\u2019t die in Auschwitz.\u201d\n\nBack foot\n\nIn the Tony Blair years, the Labour Party took a major rightward shift.\n\nBlair notoriously led the UK into a war of aggression against Iraq in 2003 \u2013 which even he later admitted was a major factor in the emergence of Islamic State.\n\nBlair is also staunchly pro-Israel.\n\nThe 2006 Israeli war against Lebanon killed 1,191 Lebanese, \u201cthe overwhelming majority of them civilians\u201d according to Amnesty International. But Blair stood strongly behind Israel in that war. He later admitted in his memoir this caused him political damage. \u201cI suffered accordingly,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFor career-minded, rising Labour MPs, joining Labour Friends of Israel was long seen as the place to be. That has been slowly changing.\n\nUnder Blair, Jeremy Corbyn was a backbench MP, and a gadfly of the big business and war-friendly clique that had captured Labour\u2019s leadership. He voted against Blair\u2019s party line hundreds of times.\n\nThe scale of Corbyn\u2019s victory \u2013 almost 60 percent of 422,664 voters \u2013 last summer put the right on the back foot.\n\nSo now they are resorting to ever more desperate tactics, blaming alleged anti-Semitism in the party on Corbyn\u2019s leadership.\n\nMichael Levy, a Labour member of the House of Lords who was a key fundraiser for the party during the Tony Blair years, is a strong supporter of Israel. He has made a number of media appearances in recent weeks denouncing Corbyn for supposedly not doing enough against anti-Semitism.\n\nLeft-wing Jewish activists say that anti-Semitism has become the \u201cweapon of choice\u201d against the left.\n\nNaomi Wimborne-Idrissi, a local Labour Party activist and founder of Jews For Boycotting Israeli Goods, told The Electronic Intifada that it has become a \u201creally pernicious \u2026 pincer movement\u201d by the Israel lobby and the Labour right.\n\n\u201cMaybe the\u2019ve overstepped themselves\u201d this time, she said, before cautioning that what happens would depend on how well activists fought back and educated people on the true nature of anti-Semitism and Zionism.\n\nFor the moment, the manufactured anti-Semitism crisis shows no sign of abating.\n\nThe same day Ken Livingstone was suspended from the party, BICOM appealed to the mob, posting a tweet with the words: \u201csave your pitch fork for Corbyn.\u201d\n\n'Save your pitch fork for Corbyn'.

The Party has been in power for just over a third of the period since the Second World War.\n\nIn the most recent 2019 General Election, Labour won 202 out of 650 seats in the House of Commons, securing 32.2% of the popular vote.\n\nIn the summer of 2021, Labour Peers accounted for 173 of the 786 Members of the House of Lords.\n\nWhere Labour was once the dominant force in Scottish politics, securing 46% of the vote and winning 56 seats from a total of 72 seats in 1997 General Election, the Party is now the third force in Scottish politics. By 2019, Labour\u2019s share of the vote in Scotland had dropped to 18% and the party possessed just one Labour MP in Scotland.\n\nLabour Party Beliefs\n\nThe Labour Party\u2019s constitution makes the following statement: \u201cthe Labour Party is a democratic socialist party. It believes that by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create for each of us the means to realise our true potential, and for all of us, a community in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, the Labour Party\u2019s economic policy reflected Keynesian beliefs in government economic intervention, taxation to support the redistribution of wealth, and the nationalisation of industry.\n\nToday there are two distinct wings within the Labour Party. On the right of the party sit those supporters of Tony Blair\u2019s \u2018New Labour\u2019, who take a more Social Democratic approach. On the left of the party, lie the Momentum Group and the supporters of former Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn. This latter group support a more active socialist approach, built around the nationalisation of industries, hostility to the free market economy, and a more significant redistribution of wealth.\n\nThe Labour Party\u2019s socialists origins dovetail with its internationalist traditions. The overwhelming majority of the Parliamentary Labour Party was supportive of Britain remaining in the European Union during the 2016 Brexit referendum.\n\nLabour Party Membership\n\nIn 2019, the Labour Party was said to possess around 485,000 members, making it by far Britain\u2019s largest party in terms of membership numbers.\n\nAlthough the Labour Party failed to garner increased support amongst the wider electorate between 2013 and 2019, the Labour Party\u2019s own membership levels tripled during this period.\n\nLabour Party Voters\n\nThe results of the 2019 General Election showed the Labour Party to be most popular with the youngest cohort of voters. The Party\u2019s support then steadily decreases as voters age. According to a YouGov post-election survey, the age at which the average voter switches from voting Labour to voting Conservative is 39.\n\nOverall, women are slightly more likely to vote Labour than men, with this gap being significantly large in the youngest age bracket, before getting smaller with age.\n\nDespite Labour\u2019s history and past identity as the party of the working class, Labour\u2019s support in 2019 was approximately the same across all social classes. In that year\u2019s election, more working class voters were actually shown to have supported the Conservative Party than the Labour Party.\n\nLevels of Labour support are seen to rise steadily with a voter\u2019s level of formal education. In 2019, Labour polled only a quarter of the share of the vote among voters with a level of education at GCSE or below. This was some way below the party\u2019s overall share of the vote.\n\nEstimates by the polling firm Ipsos Mori suggested that 64% of Black and Minority Ethnic voters supported Labour in 2019, compared to only 29% of White voters. The Labour Party significantly trailed the Conservative Party amongst Anglican and Jewish voters, albeit retained a slim lead over the Conservatives amongst Catholic voters and non religious people. Studies have suggested that as many of 85% of Muslim voters supported the Labour Party.\n\nA Brief History of the Labour Party\n\nThe Labour Party was founded in 1900 as an alliance between the Socialists and the Trade Unions. The new party, then known as the Labour Representation Committee, won its first seats in Parliament in the 1900 general election, with Keir Hardie and Richard Bell becoming the first Labour MPs. Following a secret electoral pact with the Liberal Party, then the Conservative Party\u2019s main rival, Labour managed to increase its Parliamentary representation further in 1906. At this point, the Party officially adopted the name as the Labour Party, with Keir Hardie becoming its first Chairman.\n\nDuring the First World War, Labour was split between supporters of the war and anti-war campaigners. Despite this inner divide, Arthur Henderson became the first Labour MP to serve in Government after joining the wartime cabinet.\n\nAfter the war, Henderson, along with Ramsay MacDonald and Sidney Webb, set up a system of constituencies to formalise local Labour support. Webb also oversaw \u201cLabour and the New Social Order\u201d, a statement of Labour beliefs and policies that remained the party\u2019s manifesto until 1950. This statement detailed socialist values such as the redistribution of wealth through high taxation and the nationalisation of industries. These principles were reflected in the party\u2019s 1918 constitution, particularly its famous Clause IV, known as \u2018the socialist objective\u2019.\n\nIn 1922, the Liberal Party\u2019s internal divisions, and a surge in Labour support in the aftermath of the 1918 Representation of the People Act, allowed Labour to surpass the Liberals and form the Official Opposition for the first time.\n\nIn 1924, Labour and the Liberal Party joined forces in a minority government against the weakened Conservatives. This led to Ramsay MacDonald briefly becoming Britain\u2019s first Labour Prime Minister. MacDonald was subsequently elected outright as Labour Prime Minister in 1929.\n\nFollowing the Great Depression in 1929, and the subsequent formation of a National Government in 1931, there was a split in the Labour Party with a number of leading figures refusing to acquiesce in government spending cuts.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Labour entered into a war time coalition with the Conservatives. Then Labour Party Leader, Clement Attlee, served as Deputy Prime Minister. In the 1945 post-war general election, Attlee led Labour to a landslide victory. His government subsequently established the modern welfare state and created the National Health Service in 1948. Despite losing power in 1951, Attlee\u2019s reforms became the foundation of the Post War Consensus.\n\nLabour returned to power in both the 1960s and the 1970s under Harold Wilson, before spending 18 years in the political wilderness in the 1980s and 1990s, during the Conservative Governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Major.\n\nIn the run up to the 1997 General Election, Labour made some significant changes in its policy stances, moving decidedly towards the centre ground of British politics under Tony Blair\u2019s \u2018New Labour\u2019. This included the rejection of Clause IV in 1995. The party returned to power in 1997, winning big parliamentary majorities, and serving in government for 13 years until 2010.\n\nReturning to opposition after the 2010 General Election, the Labour Party moved steadily back towards the left of the political spectrum \u2013 a move that was hastened after the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour Party Leader in 2015. After two subsequent election defeats (2017 and 2019), Sir Keir Starmer was elected to replace Jeremy Corbyn in 2020.\n\nLabour and Anti-semitism\n\nUnder Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, there were accusations of antisemitism levelled both at him personally and at the party as a whole. This led to a 2016 internal inquiry under the auspices of the former Director of Liberty, and later Labour front bench spokesperson, Shami Chakrabarti. Her report criticized the party\u2019s \u2018atmosphere\u2019 but concluded that it was not institutionally anti-semitic.\n\nIn 2018, the Labour Party did not initially accept the \u2018Working Definition of Antisemitism\u2019 published by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, prompting further criticism from the Jewish community.\n\nThe Equalities and Human Rights Commissions (EHRC) then investigated the Labour Party in relation to its internal handling of antisemitism complaints by representatives of the Jewish community, including the Jewish Labour Movement. In 2020, an EHRC report concluded that Labour broke the law in relation to its handling of these antisemitism complaints.\n\nFormer Labour Leader, Jeremy Corbyn, rejected the findings of the EHRC, commenting that the issue was \u201cdramatically overstated for political reasons\u201d. This led to Jeremy Corbyn being temporarily suspended from the Labour Party, and the former Party Leader then losing the Labour whip in the House of Commons.\n\nLabour and the UnionsHistorically, the Trade Union movement was closely associated with the Labour Party, and indeed the unions were integral in the Party\u2019s founding.\n\nAccordingly, affiliated trade unions once possessed half of the votes at the Labour Party Conference, although this system was subsequently reformed by former Party Leader, Ed Miliband. Since 2014, members of a Trade Union affiliated to the Labour Party have been considered as affiliated supporters. This gives them the right to vote in leadership elections, but not to vote in other internal party elections.\n\nLabour Party Funding\n\nThe Labour Party is funded through a combination of public grants, donations and membership fees.\n\nBeing an opposition party, Labour currently receives both Policy Development Grants and Short Money. According to the Electoral Commission, Labour received a Policy Development Grant of \u00a3359,478 in the year 2015-16.\n\nThe Labour Party is also entitled to public funding in the form of Short Money and an extra annual allowance for the running costs of the Leader of the Opposition\u2019s office. According the House of Commons Department for HR and Change, in 2014-15, these amounted to \u00a35,740,052 and \u00a3777,538 respectively. As Labour is also the main Opposition Party in the House of Lords, they also receive what is known as Cranborne Money, amounting to \u00a3572,717 in the 2014/2015 session for example.\n\nIn addition to the above public funding, the Labour Party receives support in the form of donations. During the 2019 electoral period, such donations amounted to \u00a35.4 million. The vast majority of this funding came from the Trade Unions, with many of the wealthier individual donors who supported New Labour, said to be unwilling to fund the party whilst it was under Corbyn\u2019s leadership.\n\nCurrently, standard Labour Party membership costs \u00a34.42 per month, with reduced rates available for young people, students, the unemployed, part-time workers, retired people, affiliated trade union members, and current and former members of the armed forces.\n\nLabour Party Organisation\n\nThe Labour Party is centrally organised by the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC), which oversees all Party operations. The NEC sets yearly objectives to determine the direction of the party and its policy priorities.\n\nThe Labour Party also competes in Scottish and Welsh devolved elections as Scottish Labour and Welsh Labour, two autonomous sections of the national party.\n\nAt the local level, the Labour Party is organised into local branches. These branches choose candidates for local elections and send representatives to the General Committee of the local Constituency Labour Party (CLP). The CLP organises support in each Parliamentary constituency and in normal circumstances is responsible for the selection of Labour candidates for parliamentary elections. Each CLP also sends representatives to the annual Labour Party conference.\n\nLabour Party Leadership\n\nIf a Labour leadership contest is triggered by the incumbent leader\u2019s resignation, as it was in 2020, then to be able to stand for election, prospective candidates need the support of 10% of Labour MPs, in addition to that of either 5% of constituency parties or at least three affiliates, out of which, two must be trade unions.\n\nHaving secured their way onto the ballot paper, candidates are then voted on by party members, affiliated supporters, and registered supporters in a preferential ballot. Each eligible voter has one vote. The elected leader is the candidate who receives over half of the votes. If each candidate receives a minority of the vote, the one with the least votes is eliminated, with their votes redistributed to their voter\u2019s second preference. This continues until one candidate has at least 50% of the votes.\n\nA leadership contest can also be provoked through a challenge to the sitting leader. For this, any challenger needs at least 20% of MPs to support them. The incumbent leader is automatically on the ballot alongside the name of their challengers, and the voting system is the same as in the case of a race triggered by resignation. This is the process under which Owen Smith mounted a bid to Jeremy Corbyn in 2016.\n\nUnlike the Conservative Party, Labour MPs cannot forcibly remove the Party Leader through a vote of no confidence. Jeremy Corbyn lost such a vote in June 2016, but refused to resign.\n\nKeir Starmer was elected Leader of the Labour Party on 4 April 2020, doing so with over 50% of the vote in the first ballot.\n\nLabour Party Policy Process\n\nLabour Party policy can be made in several ways. Any member can individually submit an idea on the Labour Policy forum website or participate in a local or regional policy discussion. The National Policy Forum, made up of representatives of the various groups within Labour, receives and engages with these policy ideas. They also conduct regular reviews of existing Labour policy.\n\nThe task of developing policy from the ideas submitted to the Labour Policy Forum then falls to Labour\u2019s eight policy commissions. These are made up of specialists stemming from all areas of the party, including the Parliamentary Party, the NEC, and grassroots activists.\n\nThe Labour Party\u2019s Annual Conference then considers the policy proposals developed by the policy commissions and decides what will be included in the party\u2019s election manifesto. Delegates are picked by members to vote at the conference. They must have been party members for at least a year and come from constituency parties, Trade Unions and other groups within the Labour movement. The vote is on entire policy documents, not the details included within the proposals.\n\nWhen having to make smaller, day-to-day policy decisions, especially regarding House of Commons votes when in opposition, decisions are typically made by the leadership of the Parliamentary Labour Party.\n\nLabour Parliamentary Candidates\n\nCandidates for parliamentary elections are usually picked at the recommendation of their local Constituency Labour Party, but the NEC reserves the right to make the final decision.\n\nContact Details\n\nWebsite: www.labour.org.uk\n\nTwitter: @UKLabour"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/julie-elliott", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nJulie Elliott was born on 29 July, 1963 in Sunderland District, United Kingdom, is a British Labour politician.

The reason Boris Johnson is sitting in No 10 is that the Conservatives have learned the right lessons from these episodes and Labour has not.\n\nThe Tories have understood that their response to the financial meltdown \u2013 a prolonged period of austerity that squeezed living standards \u2013 was unpopular and wrong. They also twigged that Brexit was a revolt against austerity and free-market economics more generally \u2013 so they have embraced the decision to leave the European Union and positioned themselves as the party of intervention and the working classes.\n\nLabour got the first part of this narrative but not the second. In this general election it sought to divorce austerity from Brexit \u2013 with disastrous results. Labour won seats in 2017 when it said it would respect the referendum result, but saw its \u201cred wall\u201d breached when it moved steadily closer to remain. Having chosen not to listen to what voters in its former heartlands were saying, Labour now seems bemused to find that they have migrated to a party that did.\n\nLabour\u2019s Brexit stance was not the only reason it lost the election. The number of seats won by the party has fallen, with one exception, at every election since 1997. Corbyn bucked the trend in 2017 and although he only managed to emulate Gordon Brown\u2019s performance in the defeat of 2010, there was hope that Labour could avoid becoming as politically irrelevant as the social democratic parties in Germany and France. But to do so Labour had to keep its broad electoral coalition together.\n\nThe problem in doing so became evident as the campaign wore on. Voters in the former industrial parts of the country are not mugs. They could see that Labour\u2019s stance on Brexit had moved from respecting the referendum result in 2016, to telling the public to have another think (and to come up with a different result) in 2019.\n\nAnd when canvassing returns showed the likely loss of seats in the red wall, Labour made matters worse by coming up with a string of panicky, and expensive, electoral bribes. To many voters, these seemed an insult to their intelligence, which indeed they were.\n\nAll of which leaves Labour in a terrible place. It is not just that the Conservatives are in power for at least the next five years. It is not even that seats once thought impregnable have been lost. It is the failure \u2013 for a second time in a decade \u2013 to be able to exploit conditions that looked tailor-made for a party of the left.\n\nThe financial crisis marked a watershed for global economic liberalism, because its fundamental tenet \u2013 that markets worked best when governments took a back seat \u2013 came under scrutiny. Brexit was one of the ways in which the pushback against the orthodoxy manifested itself, but much of the remainer left in the UK has been unable to grasp this. Instead of seeing Brexit as a vote for a different sort of economy, it has demonised leave voters as nativists and racists. It decided early on that no matter what form Brexit took, it would be worse than the status quo.\n\nThis was a curious argument, because it presupposed that nothing ever changes: that there would be no new policies, no attempts to improve on what currently exists, no attempts to respond to any short-term problems that Brexit might cause. By this token, Labour\u2019s national investment bank and its Keynesian infrastructure programme would have made no difference either.\n\nBrexit has already been a catalyst for change. It has forced the government to spend rather than cut. The Conservatives are committed to increase both the minimum wage and have pledged to use the money saved by scrapping a planned reduction in corporation tax to spending on the NHS. The need for state intervention in the economy is now accepted: regional policy is back in vogue.\n\nSo Labour\u2019s remainers face a choice. Option one is to move straight from supporting a second referendum to arguing for rejoining the EU. This is an entirely negative strategy and relies on UK voters looking at the dismal growth across the Channel and saying: \u201cWe want what they are having.\u201d It seems a tad unlikely.\n\nOption two involves grudgingly accepting that Brexit is a reality and that Labour\u2019s approach should be to make the best of a bad job. This would be a continuation of Corbyn\u2019s triangulation strategy and have the same baleful result. The message sent to leave voters would be the same as it has been consistently from remainers since 2016: you got it wrong, you idiots. This doesn\u2019t seem to be a particularly good way of rebuilding the red wall either.\n\nStrategy three is the hardest for remainers to swallow but it is the only option that offers a way back for Labour: embrace Brexit and argue for a left version of Britain outside the EU. This could take many forms: a devolution of power to local mayors; a new deal for the north; state support for green industry that would provide well-paid jobs in every constituency. It means exuding optimism that things can get better rather than telling people who are struggling, but not destitute, that only state handouts can alleviate their misery.\n\nThe choice is simple: start putting together a post-Brexit progressive project or have a monster sulk and watch the Tories make the political weather."}], "Paul Elliott is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Sunderland Central.": [{"url": "https://www.sunderlandecho.com/health/coronavirus/government-had-to-be-reminded-that-sunderland-has-three-mps-during-a-covid-19-conference-call-3001047", "page_content": "Sunderland Central MP Julie Elliott had to remind the Government that there are three Members of Parliament for Sunderland during a telephone meeting about Covid-19 measures this afternoon (Monday, October 12).\n\nMPs in the North East were given short notice to join the call, which took place between 2.10pm and 2.30pm, with Mrs Elliott only receiving the invitation one minute before it was scheduled to start.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nA spokesman for Julie Elliott\u2019s office said: \u201cJulie got notice of the call a minute before it was due to start.\n\n\"She joined just as the meeting was starting where she then informed them that there was more than one Sunderland MP.\u201d\n\nThe MP for Washington and Sunderland West, Sharon Hodgson took to Twitter to express her anger, confirming that she was late to join the meeting.\n\nMrs Hodgson commented: \u201cI got email invite at 2.18pm as another MP pointed out so many MPs missing.

I was the Agent for Tynemouth in 1997 and played a central part in the historic victory that year, winning the seat for Labour for the first time since 1945.
