Pat O\u2019Brien\n\nThese animal carvings now in New Kalabsha, Southern Egypt are older than the ruin, the Kiosk of Qertassi that they stand beside (Figure 1).\n\nHow do we analyse to find out if they are as old as we think they are?\n\nThe problem is that they are just marks cut or incised into the rock and our ability to age them is not as good as with organic materials. Defining the subject and age of rock paintings can mean archaeologists are able to determine more about the life of prehistoric peoples and acquire a better understanding of our origins. However, dating rock art has been a struggle for archaeologists ever since the first discoveries of it in the late 19th century.\n\nIt is possible to determine a number of things based on where the art is found and when it was found, but not everything can be learnt from that.\n\nDating ancient material relies on the use of two approaches \u2013 direct or absolute and indirect or relative dating or chronology.\n\nFor example, consider relative dating. If something is found with another object that the archaeologist already knows the age of and the area has not been disturbed since they were placed together, it is safe to say they both come from the same time. More importantly, if it is found below the object archaeologists know it must be older. That is called context or stratigraphic relationship and it\u2019s how archaeologists date objects as they dig. But it does not produce precise dates. If archaeologists can date something precisely that is absolute dating. The problem is it requires highly scientific methods.\n\nThere is a difficulty with something painted, particularly if the paints all seem to have the same composition. Here, archaeologists have to use the materials themselves and try to date it using some property or component within the material. The most common example of this form of absolute chronology, which we can use with rock paintings, is radiocarbon dating. If we can use that technique it can give a reasonably accurate age up to approximately 50,000 BCE (Before Common Era similar to BC, Before Christ).\n\nRadiocarbon dating\n\nRadiocarbon dating (also called carbon dating) only works with organic things; materials that came from living things.\n\nWhere does the radioactive carbon come from?\n\nHow can it tell us how old an organic material is?\n\nIt relies upon the fact that plants take in carbon dioxide during photosynthesis and use it to make its chemicals. Animals eat these plants and the carbon is taken up into their chemicals.\n\nThe carbon element is composed of two different atoms called isotopes (meaning they have the same number of protons but there are differing numbers of neutrons in each different type of atom). When we add the number of protons, also known as the atomic number, to the number of neutrons, the total is the atomic mass number. The most common carbon atom has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, so the atomic number for this carbon isotope is 6 and the atomic mass number is 12. This can be written as:\n\nCarbon typically has 6 neutrons making the isotope carbon 12 (C12), but some carbon atoms have 7 neutrons making carbon 13 (C13) and some carbon atoms have 8 neutrons making carbon 14 (C14). The carbon 14 isotope is radioactive. The various isotopes are found in organic materials in the proportions shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2: Carbon istopes (12, 13, 14). Peter Bull\n\nAll the time an organism is alive it takes up all forms of the carbon isotopes to make its chemicals but on death it stops taking in any carbon.\n\nCarbon dating works because the amount of carbon 14 in the atmosphere has not changed in thousands of years. Carbon 14 is formed as cosmic rays hit atoms in the upper atmosphere. Living things, while they are still alive, absorb the isotopes of carbon. This means all living things have radioactive carbon 14 in them (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3: Carbon 14 entering the atmosphere. Image courtesy of Peter Bull.\n\nAfter a living thing dies, the amount of carbon 14 in the material decreases with time it decays with a half-life of about 5700 years into nitrogen (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 4:Half-life graph of carbon 14.\n\nCarbon dating involves the measuring of the amount of the radioactive carbon isotope C14 absorbed by living things into the organic matter. By comparing how much carbon 14 there is in the dead organism with the amount in a living one, the age of the dead organism can be estimated.\n\nWhy can\u2019t we use radiocarbon dating with some pigments?\n\nThe difficulties with pigments\n\nThe difficulty with carbon dating pigments is that they are often made from rocks, and do not contain organic matter. Where there are engravings or paintings that lack any organic pigments or binders there is no basis for the build up of natural carbon 14.\n\nWhat about limestone?\n\nIsn\u2019t that a sedimentary rock made up of once living cells and so contain carbon?\n\nIn some paints where suitable materials such as limestone, chalk or charcoal pigments do exist, we can use carbon dating. The sample size can only be very small otherwise the painting will be damaged or the level of contamination by the tools we use to take the sample will be high and could produce less accurate results.\n\nCarbon dating also relies upon certain assumptions. The first is that carbon 14 has always been produced and had the same concentration in the atmosphere. This assumption is more important the older the carbon sample is. After 10,000 years there are no absolute calibration points such as tree rings. The second assumption is that radioactive decay rates stay the same and have always been what we measure them now to be. Because of the half-life of carbon 14 the radiocarbon dating method is only useful for limestone\u2019s or chalks less than 30 million years old.\n\nCan radiocarbon dating be more accurate?\n\nUp to 2009 only small amounts of organic matter could be dated directly using carbon isotope decay. Then a new, highly sensitive dating method, called accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) was developed. It\u2019s an expensive but effective method, since it only requires 0.05 milligrams of carbon (the weight of 50 specks of dust). That\u2019s much less than the 1 to 10 grams of carbon needed with normal carbon dating.\n\nIn general terms, in AMS scientists create negative ions by bombarding atoms with fast moving particles which are accelerated using a particle accelerator. Then, using a mass spectrometer, they count all the carbon 14 atoms and from that work out the age.\n\nTo check its accuracy, research was carried out which analysed pictographs containing organic pigments from a number of countries over 15 years. This validation showed the method to be very successful allowing rock painting to join bones, pottery and other artefacts as materials that could be dated.\n\nIs radiocarbon dating the only absolute method for dating rock art?\n\nUranium-Series Disequilibrium\n\nIn 2010 a new development allowed the El Costillo paintings in Spain to be dated more accurately, pushing the advent of cave painting back 10,000 years.\n\nThis new method involved the measurement of the decay of inorganic materials. It measured the decay of uranium isotopes in the thin calcite flowstone growths that form on the surfaces of the paintings and engravings. Flowstones are created as water dissolves calcium compounds that are later deposited when the water collects on a prominent point forming a special type of stalagmite (Figure 5).\n\nThe research team was conducted by scientists from the University of Bristol. The team included Dr Paul Pettitt from the University of Sheffield\u2019s Department of Archaeology a renowned expert in cave art.\n\nFigure 5: Scientist removing a sample from the surface of a flowstone in El Costillo. Tito Bustillo\n\nFlowstones are formed where water flows down the walls or along the floors of a cave. They are typically formations in limestone \u201csolution caves\u201d, where they are the most common secondary deposit or speleothem. Speleothem\u2019s can form in any type of cave where water enters, including igneous lava tubes. The water dissolves minerals, among which can be uranium isotopes.\n\nThe team of scientists from the UK, Spain and Portugal dated the formation of tiny stalactites on top of the paintings. This gave a minimum age for the art. Where larger stalagmites had been painted, maximum ages were also obtained. This technique is used a lot in Earth Sciences, and was used on 50 paintings in 11 caves in Northern Spain, including the UNESCO World Heritage sites of Altamira, El Castillo and Tito Bustillo. It is sensitive and avoids the problems in dating by radiocarbon.\n\nElectron Spin Resonance (ESR)\n\nAnother method for dating calcite rocks is electron spin resonance (ESR) also known as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). This is based on the measurement of electron-hole centres accumulated with time in the crystal lattice of CaCO 3 exposed to natural radiations.\n\nAn electron hole is the absence of an electron from an otherwise full valence band. Imagine a row of people sitting in the last row in a theatre. The person in the middle gets up to leave and does this by jumping over the back of their seat into the next row and is then free to move away. The person is similar to a free electron escaping the atom and the empty seat is the hole. To even up the seating the people move along to fill the seat eventually leaving the hole at the edge so everyone has moved along. If the hole is assumed to be positively charged then the negatively charged electrons will have moved along leaving a positive hole on the edge. This open electron shell or unpaired electron is known as a free radical and is highly reactive. Sadly ESR is not as reliable as scientists would hope so it is used with caution.\n\nMany of these instrumental techniques are new to archaeological dating. In the past, in order to date cave and rock art, archaeologists looked for other methods such as those used by art historians. These are indirect tools often open to a lot of discussion as to their accuracy. They include the following:\n\nStratification techniques: The position of the object or painting relative to some other dateable objects. For example, in the cave of Le Tuc, France, two stalagmites had to be removed before the cave art could be reached and these were dated allowing an estimation of the age of the painting to be made.\n\nPatination: The appearance of a film or scratches on the surface due to time. This has been used by some scholars to give a sense of the relative age of different petroglyphs. Sweinfurth, in 1912, was one of the first to use patination to date some engravings. Then in 1938 Winkler formed a chronology of archaeological occupation of the Eastern Desert. He based his approach on the strength of patination over the rock art scenes. He used a relative rating scheme to help him make estimations of age. A 0 rating was for a high patination and older, while a 10 was indication of a shallow patination and younger. Accepting Winkler\u2019s chronological scheme was innovative it has been attacked on many occasions because of the effect of the differentiation of light due to shade or weather due to wind direction on conditions over the surface of a rock painting, and how that might cause non-uniform patination.\n\nSuperimposition: Where one drawing has been etched on top of another. This could establish that one image is more recent than another, but doesn\u2019t give any information about the time gap between the drawings of the two images. Using a combination of superimposition and patination it might be possible to argue that the two are some distance apart in terms of age. However, there is always the possibility the artist superimposed one image over another deliberately, and that they are of identical or similar age.\n\nWeathering: Where the impact of chemical and physical processes on an image after it has been created is determined. Lorblanchet in 1992 tried using radiocarbon dating to date some Australian rock art but found it inaccurate and so suggested that differential weathering could provide an indication of the relative ages of different rock art images. Unfortunately, weathering does not necessarily occur at a consistent rate across all rock art surfaces in a given area, and is not always a reliable way of determining relative ages. A more scientific approach to weathering is micro-erosion analysis, pioneered in Australia by Bednarik in 2002. One method is to examine the surface of a rock using a microscope and to measure the rate of weathering of the rock in a given area. This is done by sampling a number of rock surfaces set up to undergo simulated weathering and comparing the simulation with the actual weathering. In some cases the damage to rock crystals is used as the measure of weathering of the rock. A rock carved with petroglyphs is analysed in the light of this accumulated data giving an estimation of the duration of time based upon manual erosion of the rock surface.\n\nStyle: Attributing a figure to a specific artist or group and evaluating the style of a painting to generate a relative timeline based on comparison of multiple works of art. A number of archaeologists have tried to create an artificial timeline for rock art using assessments of style similar to those applied by art historians. The difficulty is that what may be seen as art may have had, when they were drawn on the cave wall, a very different purpose a few thousand years ago. Academic perceptions largely depend on their own culture and history. This approach is very similar to seriation used by Sir William Flinders Petrie. He used relative dating of artefacts by the evolutionary change in their style eg moving from a simple rim to a ridged rim and straight sides to bulged side and then with handles, etc.\n\nThe method of dating art by style consists of grouping paintings on the basis of their stylistic components by selecting specific criteria that are the same or similar in a selection of pictures. The criteria are used to create an artificial set or \u201cbase sample\u201d against which to compare other paintings.\n\nThe chosen criteria can be details like the absence of paws, features like eyes or fur, the redoubling of certain strokes, or the blank spaces between two anatomical segments. Then when dateable paintings are found, their components can be matched with those in the stylist groups of paintings and a whole swathe of disparate paintings can be dated.\n\nAlternatively extinct species are considered relevant. For example, the mammoth is a frequent topic of Upper Palaeolithic rock art and as the mammoth died out by the end of the last ice age, this provides a relative dating process.\n\nThe difficulty is that rock art is considered an art but is often analysed by archaeologists in a scientific way. For a number of years art historians have placed a high degree of reliance on the interpretation of the style of the painting and this approach has proven its analytical effectiveness many times in historical material culture. For that reason, rock art specialists try to apply this method to extremely old artefacts, like Palaeolithic art. Initial attempts by H. Breuil in 1952 aimed to establish a linear time frame for rock art.\n\nDating is still an area of development and criticism because of the imprecise nature of the material and methods available."}, {"url": "https://nittygrittyscience.com/textbooks/earths-changing-surface-2/section-2-determining-ages-of-rocks/", "page_content": "One way to determine the age of a fossil is by finding the age of the rock it was found in. A rock\u2019s relative age is compared with the ages of other rocks. The absolute age of a rock is the number of years since the rock formed. While it may be impossible to know the absolute age exactly, a geologist can sometimes determine it within a certain number of years. Geologists use the law of superposition to determine the relative age of rocks. For example, in horizontal sedimentary rock layers, the oldest layer of rock is at the bottom, and each higher layer is younger than the layer below.\n\nGeologists look at other clues besides the position of rock layers to determine the relative age of rocks. An extrusion is lava that hardens on the surface and is always younger than the rocks below it. When magma cools and hardens into a mass of igneous rock beneath the surface, it\u2019s called an intrusion. An intrusion is always younger than the rock layers around or beneath it. A fault is a break in the Earth\u2019s crust. It is always younger than the rock it cuts through. An unconformity is a gap in the geological record where some rock layers have been lost because of erosion.\n\nCertain fossils, called index fossils, represent an organism that existed only briefly and was widely distributed, meaning it lived in many different areas. To date rock layers, geologists use index fossils to match layers, and then they can give the same age to those layers of rocks at other locations.\n\nMost elements are stable, but some exist in unstable forms, meaning they break down. An element is when all the atoms of a particular type of matter are the same. When an element breaks down or decays, it releases particles and energy in a process called radioactive decay. These unstable elements are said to be radioactive. The rate of decay of each radioactive element is called a half-life, which is the time it takes for half of the radioactive atoms to decay. The decay will continue at a steady rate, slowly changing the original radioactive element into another, changing the composition over time. This change causes the amount of the radioactive element to decrease while the amount of the new element increases. Geologists also use radioactive dating to determine the absolute ages of rocks by first determining the amount of radioactive elements in a rock.\n\nReview:"}, {"url": "https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/dating-rocks-and-fossils-using-geologic-methods-107924044/", "page_content": "Unlike relative dating methods,methods provide chronological estimates of the age of certain geological materials associated with fossils, and even direct age measurements of the fossil material itself. To establish the age of a rock or a fossil, researchers use some type of clock to determine the date it was formed. Geologists commonly usemethods, based on the naturalof certain elements such as potassium and carbon, as reliable clocks to date ancient events. Geologists also use other methods - such asand, which assess the effects ofon the accumulation of electrons in imperfections, or \"traps,\" in the crystal structure of a mineral - to determine the age of the rocks or fossils.\n\nAll elements contain protons and neutrons, located in the atomic nucleus, and electrons that orbit around the nucleus (Figure 5a). In each element, the number of protons is constant while the number of neutrons and electrons can vary. Atoms of the same element but with different number of neutrons are called isotopes of that element. Each isotope is identified by its atomic mass, which is the number of protons plus neutrons. For example, the element carbon has six protons, but can have six, seven, or eight neutrons. Thus, carbon has three isotopes: carbon 12 (12C), carbon 13 (13C), and carbon 14 (14C) (Figure 5a).\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Radioactive isotopes and how they decay through time. (a) Carbon has three isotopes with different numbers of neutrons: carbon 12 (C12, 6 protons + 6 neutrons), carbon 13 (C13, 6 protons + 7 neutrons), and carbon 14 (C14, 6 protons + 8 neutrons). C12 and C13 are stable. The atomic nucleus in C14 is unstable making the isotope radioactive. Because it is unstable, occasionally C14 undergoes radioactive decay to become stable nitrogen (N14). (b) The radioactive atoms (parent isotopes) in any mineral decay over time into stable daughter isotopes. The amount of time it takes for half of the parent isotopes to decay into daughter isotopes is known as the half-life of the radioactive isotope. \u00a9 2013 All rights reserved.\n\nMost isotopes found on Earth are generally stable and do not change. However some isotopes, like 14C, have an unstable nucleus and are radioactive. This means that occasionally the unstable isotope will change its number of protons, neutrons, or both. This change is called radioactive decay. For example, unstable 14C transforms to stable nitrogen (14N). The atomic nucleus that decays is called the parent isotope. The product of the decay is called the daughter isotope. In the example, 14C is the parent and 14N is the daughter.\n\nSome minerals in rocks and organic matter (e.g., wood, bones, and shells) can contain radioactive isotopes. The abundances of parent and daughter isotopes in a sample can be measured and used to determine their age. This method is known as radiometric dating. Some commonly used dating methods are summarized in Table 1.\n\nThe rate of decay for many radioactive isotopes has been measured and does not change over time. Thus, each radioactive isotope has been decaying at the same rate since it was formed, ticking along regularly like a clock. For example, when potassium is incorporated into a mineral that forms when lava cools, there is no argon from previous decay (argon, a gas, escapes into the atmosphere while the lava is still molten). When that mineral forms and the rock cools enough that argon can no longer escape, the \"radiometric clock\" starts. Over time, the radioactive isotope of potassium decays slowly into stable argon, which accumulates in the mineral.\n\nThe amount of time that it takes for half of the parent isotope to decay into daughter isotopes is called the half-life of an isotope (Figure 5b). When the quantities of the parent and daughter isotopes are equal, one half-life has occurred. If the half life of an isotope is known, the abundance of the parent and daughter isotopes can be measured and the amount of time that has elapsed since the \"radiometric clock\" started can be calculated.\n\nFor example, if the measured abundance of 14C and 14N in a bone are equal, one half-life has passed and the bone is 5,730 years old (an amount equal to the half-life of 14C). If there is three times less 14C than 14N in the bone, two half lives have passed and the sample is 11,460 years old. However, if the bone is 70,000 years or older the amount of 14C left in the bone will be too small to measure accurately. Thus, radiocarbon dating is only useful for measuring things that were formed in the relatively recent geologic past. Luckily, there are methods, such as the commonly used potassium-argon (K-Ar) method, that allows dating of materials that are beyond the limit of radiocarbon dating (Table 1).\n\nName of Method Age Range of Application Material Dated Methodology Radiocarbon\n\n1 - 70,000 years\n\nOrganic material such as bones, wood, charcoal, shells\n\nRadioactive decay of 14C in organic matter after removal from bioshpere\n\nK-Ar dating 1,000 - billion of years\n\nPotassium-bearing minerals and glasses\n\nRadioactive decay of 40K in rocks and minerals\n\nUranium-Lead\n\n10,000 - billion of years\n\nUranium-bearing minerals\n\nRadioactive decay of uranium to lead via two separate decay chains\n\nUranium series\n\n1,000 - 500,000 years\n\nUranium-bearing minerals, corals, shells, teeth, CaCO 3\n\nRadioactive decay of 234U to 230Th\n\nFission track\n\n1,000 - billion of years\n\nUranium-bearing minerals and glasses\n\nMeasurement of damage tracks in glass and minerals from the radioactive decay of 238U\n\nLuminescence (optically or thermally stimulated)\n\n1,000 - 1,000,000 years\n\nQuartz, feldspar, stone tools, pottery\n\nBurial or heating age based on the accumulation of radiation-induced damage to electron sitting in mineral lattices\n\nElectron Spin Resonance (ESR)\n\n1,000 - 3,000,000 years\n\nUranium-bearing materials in which uranium has been absorbed from outside sources\n\nBurial age based on abundance of radiation-induced paramagnetic centers in mineral lattices\n\nCosmogenic Nuclides\n\n1,000 - 5,000,000 years\n\nTypically quartz or olivine from volcanic or sedimentary rocks\n\nRadioactive decay of cosmic-ray generated nuclides in surficial environments\n\nMagnetostratigraphy 20,000 - billion of years\n\nSedimentary and volcanic rocks\n\nMeasurement of ancient polarity of the earth's magnetic field recorded in a stratigraphic succession\n\nTephrochronology\n\n100 - billions of years\n\nVolcanic ejecta\n\nUses chemistry and age of volcanic deposits to establish links between distant stratigraphic successions\n\nTable 1. Comparison of commonly used dating methods.\n\n\n\nRadiation, which is a byproduct of radioactive decay, causes electrons to dislodge from their normal position in atoms and become trapped in imperfections in the crystal structure of the material. Dating methods like thermoluminescence, optical stimulating luminescence and electron spin resonance, measure the accumulation of electrons in these imperfections, or \"traps,\" in the crystal structure of the material. If the amount of radiation to which an object is exposed remains constant, the amount of electrons trapped in the imperfections in the crystal structure of the material will be proportional to the age of the material. These methods are applicable to materials that are up to about 100,000 years old. However, once rocks or fossils become much older than that, all of the \"traps\" in the crystal structures become full and no more electrons can accumulate, even if they are dislodged."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Amadeus-William-Grabau", "page_content": "Amadeus William Grabau, (born Jan. 9, 1870, Cedarburg, Wis., U.S.\u2014died March 20, 1946, Beijing), American geologist and paleontologist, known for his works on paleoecology and Chinese stratigraphy.\n\nGrabau was a member of the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, from 1892 until 1897 and of the Rensselaer Polytechnical Institute from 1899 until 1901, when he became a professor at Columbia University.

In other words, you can use superposition to tell you that one rock layer is older than another. But determining the absolute age of a substance (its age in years) is a much greater challenge. To accomplish this, scientists use a variety of evidence, from tree rings to the amounts of radioactive materials in a rock.\n\nLesson Objectives\n\nDefine the difference between absolute age and relative age.\n\nDescribe four methods of absolute dating.\n\nExplain what radioactivity is and give examples of radioactive decay.\n\nExplain how the decay of radioactive materials helps to establish the age of an object.\n\nEstimate the age of an object, given the half-life and the amounts of radioactive and daughter materials.\n\nGive four examples of radioactive materials that are used to date objects, and explain how each is used.\n\nTree Rings\n\nIn regions outside the tropics, trees grow more quickly during the warm summer months than during the cooler winter. This pattern of growth results in alternating bands of light-colored, low density \u201cearly wood\u201d and dark, high density \u201clate wood\u201d. Each dark band represents a winter; by counting rings it is possible to find the age of the tree (Figure 11.22). The width of a series of growth rings can give clues to past climates and various disruptions such as forest fires. Droughts and other variations in the climate make the tree grow slower or faster than normal, which shows up in the widths of the tree rings. These tree ring variations will appear in all trees growing in a certain region, so scientists can match up the growth rings of living and dead trees. Using logs recovered from old buildings and ancient ruins, scientists have been able to compare tree rings to create a continuous record of tree rings over the past 2,000 years. This tree ring record has proven extremely useful in creating a record of climate change, and in finding the age of ancient structures.\n\nFigure 11.22: Cross-section showing growth rings. The thick, light-colored part of each ring represents rapid spring and summer growth. The thin, dark part of each ring represents slow autumn and winter growth.\n\nIce Cores and Varves\n\nSeveral other processes result in the accumulation of distinct yearly layers that can be used for dating. For example, layers form within glaciers because there tends to be less snowfall in the summertime, allowing a dark layer of dust to accumulate on top of the winter snow (Figure 11.23). To study these patterns, scientists drill deep into ice sheets, producing cores hundreds of meters long. Scientists analyze these ice cores to determine how the climate has changed over time, as well as to measure concentrations of atmospheric gases. The longest cores have helped to form a record of polar climate stretching hundreds of thousands of years back.\n\nFigure 11.23: Ice core section showing annual layers.\n\nAnother example of yearly layers is the deposition of sediments in lakes, especially the lakes that are located at the end of glaciers. Rapid melting of the glacier in the summer results in a thick, sandy deposit of sediment. These thick layers alternate with thin, clay-rich layers deposited during the winter. The resulting layers, called varves, give scientists clues about past climate conditions. For example, an especially warm summer might result in a very thick layer of sediment deposited from the melting glacier. Thinner varves can indicate colder summers, because the glacier doesn\u2019t melt as much and carry as much sediment into the lake.\n\nAge of Earth\n\nFigure 11.24: Lord Kelvin.\n\nWhile tree rings and other annual layers are useful for dating relatively recent events, they are not of much use on the vast scale of geologic time. During the 18th and 19th centuries, geologists tried to estimate the age of Earth with indirect techniques. For example, geologists measured how fast streams deposited sediment, in order to try to calculate how long the stream had been in existence. Not surprisingly, these methods resulted in wildly different estimates, from a few million years to \u201cquadrillions of years\u201d. Probably the most reliable of these estimates was produced by the British geologist Charles Lyell, who estimated that 240 million years have passed since the appearance of the first animals with shells. Today scientists know his estimate was too young; we know that this occurred about 530 million years ago.\n\nIn 1892, William Thomson (later known as Lord Kelvin) calculated the age of Earth in a systematic fashion (Figure 11.24). He assumed that the Earth began as a ball of molten rock, which has steadily cooled over time. From these assumptions, he calculated that the Earth was 100 million years old. This estimate was a blow to geologists and supporters of Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, which required an older Earth to provide time for evolution to take place.\n\nThomson\u2019s calculations, however, were soon shown to be flawed when radioactivity was discovered in 1896. Radioactivity is the tendency of certain atoms to decay into lighter atoms, emitting energy in the process. Radioactive materials in Earth\u2019s interior provide a steady source of heat. Calculations of Earth\u2019s age using radioactive decay showed that Earth is actually much older than Thomson calculated.\n\nRadioactive Decay\n\nThe discovery of radioactive materials did more than disprove Thomson\u2019s estimate of Earth\u2019s age. It provided a way to find the absolute age of a rock. To understand how this is done, it is necessary to review some facts about atoms.\n\nAtoms contain three particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons are located in the nucleus, while electrons orbit around the nucleus. The number of protons determines which element you\u2019re examining. For example, all atoms of carbon have six protons, all atoms of oxygen have eight protons, and all atoms of gold have 79 protons. The number of neutrons, however, is variable. An atom of an element with a different number of neutrons is an isotope of that element. For example, the isotope carbon-12 contains 6 neutrons in its nucleus, while the isotope carbon-13 has 7 neutrons.\n\nSome isotopes are radioactive, which means they are unstable and likely to decay. This means the atom will spontaneously change from an unstable form to a stable form. There are two forms of nuclear decay that are relevant in how geologists can date rocks (Table (11.1):\n\nParticle Composition Effect on Nucleus Alpha 2 protons, 2 neutrons The nucleus contains two fewer protons and two fewer neutrons. Beta 1 electron One neutron decays to form a proton and an electron, which is emitted.\n\nIf an element decays by losing an alpha particle, it will lose 2 protons and 2 neutrons. If an atom decays by losing a beta particle, it loses just one electron.\n\nSo what does this have to do with the age of Earth? Radioactive decay eventually results in the formation of stable daughter products. Radioactive materials decay at known rates. As time passes, the proportion of radioactive isotopes will decrease and the proportion of daughter isotopes will increase. A rock with a relatively high proportion of radioactive isotopes is probably very young, while a rock with a high proportion of daughter products is probably very old.\n\nScientists measure the rate of radioactive decay with a unit called half-life. The half-life of a radioactive substance is the amount of time, on average, it takes for half of the atoms to decay. For example, imagine a radioactive substance with a half-life of one year. When a rock is formed, it contains a certain number of radioactive atoms. After one year (one half-life), half of the radioactive atoms have decayed to form stable daughter products, and 50% of the radioactive atoms remain. After another year (two half-lives), half of the remaining radioactive atoms have decayed, and 25% of the radioactive atoms remain. After the third year (three half-lives), 12.5% of the radioactive atoms remain. After four years (four half-lives), 6.25% of the radioactive atoms remain, and after 5 years (five half-lives), only 3.125% of the radioactive atoms remain.\n\nIf you find a rock whose radioactive material has a half life of one year and measure 3.125% radioactive atoms and 96.875% daughter atoms, you can assume that the substance is 5 years old. The decay of radioactive materials can be shown with a graph (Figure 11.25). If you find a rock with 75% of the radioactive atoms remaining, about how old is it?\n\nFigure 11.25: Decay of an imaginary radioactive substance with a half-life of one year.\n\nRadiometric Dating of Rocks\n\nIn the process of radiometric dating, several isotopes are used to date rocks and other materials. Using several different isotopes helps scientists to check the accuracy of the ages that they calculate.\n\nCarbon Dating\n\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere contains three isotopes of carbon. Carbon-12 is stable and accounts for 98.9% of atmospheric carbon. Carbon-13 is also stable and accounts for 1.1% of atmospheric carbon. Carbon-14 is radioactive and is found in tiny amounts. Carbon-14 is produced naturally in the atmosphere when cosmic rays interact with nitrogen atoms. The amount of carbon-14 produced in the atmosphere at any particular time has been relatively stable through time.\n\nRadioactive carbon-14 decays to stable nitrogen-14 by releasing a beta particle. The nitrogen atoms are lost to the atmosphere, but the amount of carbon-14 decay can be estimated by measuring the proportion of radioactive carbon-14 to stable carbon-12. As a substance ages, the relative amount of carbon-14 decreases.\n\nCarbon is removed from the atmosphere by plants during the process of photosynthesis. Animals consume this carbon when they eat plants or other animals that have eaten plants. Therefore carbon-14 dating can be used to date plant and animal remains. Examples include timbers from an old building, bones, or ashes from a fire pit. Carbon dating can be effectively used to find the age of materials between 100 and 50,000 years old.\n\nPotassium-Argon Dating\n\nPotassium-40 decays to argon-40 with a half-life of 1.26 billion years. Because argon is a gas, it can escape from molten magma or lava. Therefore any argon that is found in a crystal probably formed as a result of the decay of potassium-40. Measuring the ratio of potassium-40 to argon-40 will yield a good estimate of the age of the sample.\n\nPotassium is a common element found in many minerals such as feldspar, mica, and amphibole. The technique can be used to date igneous rocks from 100,000 years to over a billion years old. Because it can be used to date geologically young materials, the technique has been useful in estimating the age of deposits containing the bones of human ancestors.\n\nUranium-Lead Dating\n\nTwo isotopes of uranium are used for radiometric dating. Uranium-238 decays to form lead-206 with a half-life of 4.47 billion years. Uranium-235 decays to form lead-207 with a half-life of 704 million years.\n\nUranium-lead dating is usually performed on crystals of the mineral zircon (Figure 11.26). When zircon forms in an igneous rock, the crystals readily accept atoms of uranium but reject atoms of lead. Therefore, if any lead is found in a zircon crystal, it can be assumed that it was produced from the decay of uranium.\n\nFigure 11.26: Zircon crystal.\n\nUranium-lead dating can be used to date igneous rocks from 1 million years to around 4.5 billion years old. Some of the oldest rocks on Earth have been dated using this method, including zircon crystals from Australia that are 4.4 billion years old.\n\nLimitations of Radiometric Dating\n\nRadiometric dating can only be used on materials that contain measurable amounts of radioactive materials and their daughter products. This includes organic remains (which compared to rocks are relatively young, less than 100,000 years old) and older rocks. Ideally, several different radiometric techniques will be used to date the same rock. Agreement between these values indicates that the calculated age is accurate.\n\nIn general, radiometric dating works best for igneous rocks and is not very useful for determining the age of sedimentary rocks. To estimate the age of a sedimentary rock deposit, geologists search for nearby or interlayered igneous rocks that can be dated. For example, if a sedimentary rock layer is sandwiched between two layers of volcanic ash, its age is between the ages of the two ash layers.\n\nUsing a combination of radiometric dating, index fossils, and superposition, geologists have constructed a well-defined timeline of Earth history. For example, an overlying lava flow can give a reliable estimate of the age of a sedimentary rock formation in one location. Index fossils contained in this formation can then be matched to fossils in a different location, providing a good age measurement for that new rock formation as well. As this process has been repeated all over the world, our estimates of rock and fossil ages has become more and more accurate.\n\nLesson Summary\n\nTechniques such as superposition and index fossils can tell you the relative age of objects, which objects are older and which are younger. Other types of evidence are needed to establish the absolute age of objects in years. Geologists use a variety of techniques to establish absolute age, including radiometric dating, tree rings, ice cores, and annual sedimentary deposits called varves.\n\nRadiometric dating is the most useful of these techniques\u2014it is the only technique that can establish the age of objects older than a few thousand years. The concentrations of several radioactive isotopes (carbon-14, potassium-40, uranium-235 and -238) and their daughter products are used to determine the age of rocks and organic remains.\n\nReview Questions\n\nWhat four techniques are used to determine the absolute age of an object or event? A radioactive substance has a half-life of 5 million years. What is the age of a rock in which 25% of the original radioactive atoms remain? A scientist is studying a piece of cloth from an ancient burial site. She determines that 40% of the original carbon-14 atoms remain in the cloth. Based on the carbon decay graph (Figure 11.27), what is the approximate age of the cloth? Figure 11.27: Radioactive decay of Carbon-14 Which radioactive isotope or isotopes would you use to date each of the following objects? Explain each of your choices. A 4 billion year old piece of granite.\n\nA one million year old bed of volcanic ash that contains the footprints of hominids (human ancestors).\n\nThe fur of a woolly mammoth that was recently recovered frozen in a glacier.\n\nA fossilized trilobite recovered from a bed of sandstone that is about 500 million years old. The principle of uniformitarionism states that the present is the key to the past. In other words, the processes that we see happening today probably worked in a similar way in the past. Why is it important to assume that the rate of radioactive decay has remained constant over time?\n\nVocabulary\n\nabsolute age The age of an object in years. alpha particle Particle consisting of two protons and two neutrons that is ejected from the nucleus during radioactive decay. beta particle Particle consisting of a single electron that is ejected from the nucleus during radioactive decay.

Formal geologic time begins at the start of the Archean Eon (4.0 billion to 2.5 billion years ago) and continues to the present day. Modern geologic time scales additionally often include the Hadean Eon, which is an informal interval that extends from about 4.6 billion years ago (corresponding to Earth\u2019s initial formation) to 4.0 billion years ago. Geologic time is, in effect, that segment of Earth history that is represented by and recorded in the planet\u2019s rock strata.\n\nThe geologic time scale is the \u201ccalendar\u201d for events in Earth history. It subdivides all time into named units of abstract time called\u2014in descending order of duration\u2014eons, eras, periods, epochs, and ages. The enumeration of those geologic time units is based on stratigraphy, which is the correlation and classification of rock strata. The fossil forms that occur in the rocks, however, provide the chief means of establishing a geologic time scale, with the timing of the emergence and disappearance of widespread species from the fossil record being used to delineate the beginnings and endings of ages, epochs, periods, and other intervals. One of the most widely used standard charts showing the relationships between the various intervals of geologic time is the International Chronostratigraphic Chart, which is maintained by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS).\n\nBritannica Quiz Everything Earth\n\nLiving things play critical roles in the development of geologic time scales, because they have undergone evolutionary changes over geologic time. Moreover, particular kinds of organisms are characteristic of particular parts of the geologic record. By correlating the strata in which certain types of fossils are found, the geologic history of various regions\u2014and of Earth as a whole\u2014can be reconstructed. The relative geologic time scale developed from the fossil record has been numerically quantified by means of absolute dates obtained with radiometric dating methods.

Steno was struck by the resemblance of the shark's teeth to fossils, known as \"tongue stones\", recovered from inland mountains and hills (Figure 11.9).\n\nFigure 11.9: Fossil shark tooth (left) and modern shark teeth (right).\n\nFigure 11.10: Tyrannosaurus rex fossil resembling a living organism.\n\nWhile it may seem obvious today, most people at the time did not believe that fossils were once part of living creatures. The reason was that the fossils of clams, snails, and other marine animals were found in tall mountains, miles from any ocean. Two schools of thought explained these fossils. Some religious writers believed that the shells were washed up during the Biblical flood. But this explanation could not account for the fact that fossils were not only found on mountains, but also within mountains, in rocks that had been quarried from deep below Earth's surface. Seeking an alternate explanation, other writers proposed that the fossils had formed within the rocks as a result of mysterious forces. In other words, fossil shells, bones, and teeth were never a part of a living creature!\n\nSteno had other ideas. For Steno, the close resemblance between fossils and modern organisms was impossible to ignore. Instead of invoking supernatural forces to explain fossils, Steno concluded that fossils were once parts of living creatures. He then sought to explain how fossil seashells could be found in rocks far from any ocean. As in the Tyrannosaurus rex Figure 11.10, fossils resemble living organisms.\n\nSuperposition of Rock Layers [ edit | edit source ]\n\nSteno first proposed that if a rock contained the fossils of marine animals, the rock was formed from sediments that were deposited on the seafloor. These rocks were then uplifted to become mountains. Based on those assumptions, Steno made a remarkable series of conjectures that are now known as Steno's Laws.\n\nOriginal Horizontality [ edit | edit source ]\n\nBecause sediments are deposited under water, they will form flat, horizontal layers (Figure 11.11). If a sedimentary rock is found tilted, the layer was tilted after it was formed.\n\nFigure 11.11: Sedimentary layers that have been deposited horizontally.\n\nLateral Continuity [ edit | edit source ]\n\nSediments were deposited in continuous sheets that spanned the body of water that they were deposited in. When a valley cuts through sedimentary layers, it can be assumed that the rocks on either side of the valley were originally continuous.\n\nSedimentary rocks are deposited one on top of another. Therefore, the youngest layers are found at the top, and the oldest layers are found at the bottom of the sequence.\n\nFigure 11.12: Cross cutting relationships: older banded gneiss with a white granite intrusion. The granite must be younger than the gneiss, because it cuts across the existing gneiss.\n\nA rock formation or surface that cuts across other rock layers is younger than the rock layers it disturbs. For example, if an igneous intrusion goes through a series of metamorphic rocks, the intrusion must be younger than the metamorphic rocks that it cuts through (Figure 11.12).\n\nThe Grand Canyon provides an excellent illustration of Steno's laws. Figure 11.13 shows the many horizontal layers of sedimentary rock that make up the canyon. This nicely illustrates the principle of original horizontality. The youngest rock layers are at the top of the canyon, while the oldest are at the bottom, which is described by the law of superposition. Distinctive rock layers, such as the Kaibab Limestone, can be matched across the broad expanse of the canyon. We know these rock layers were once connected, which is described in the rule of lateral continuity. Finally, the Colorado River cuts through all the layers of sedimentary rock to form the canyon. Based on the principle of cross-cutting relationships, the river must be younger than all of the rock layers that it cuts through.\n\nFigure 11.13: Grand Canyon, with the Kaibab Limestone visible at the top of the canyon.\n\nDetermining the Relative Ages of Rocks [ edit | edit source ]\n\nThe relative age of a rock is its age in comparison with other rocks. If you know the relative ages of two rock layers, you know which is older and which is younger, but you do not know how old the layers are in years. In some cases, it is very tricky to determine the sequence of events that leads to a certain formation. Take the example, Figure 11.14:\n\nFigure 11.14: Cross-section of sedimentary layers: (A-C) igneous intrusion, (D) cross-section, (E) fault.\n\nThe principle of cross-cutting relationships states that a fault or intrusion is younger than the rocks that it cuts through. The fault labeled 'E' cuts through all three sedimentary rock layers (A, B, and C) and also cuts through the intrusion (D). So the fault must be the youngest formation that is seen. The intrusion (D) cuts through the three sedimentary rock layers, so it must be younger than those layers.\n\nThe principle of superposition states that the oldest sedimentary rock units are at the bottom, and the youngest are at the top. Based on this, layer C is oldest, followed by B and A. So the full sequence of events is as follows:\n\nLayer C formed. Layer B formed. Layer A formed. When layers A-B-C were present, intrusion D formed. Intrusion D cut through layers A-C. Fault E formed, shifting rocks A through C and intrusion D. Weathering and erosion occurred, forming a layer of soil on top of layer A.\n\nUnconformities in Rock Layers [ edit | edit source ]\n\nSteno discovered the rules for determining the relative age of rock beds, but he did not have a good understanding of how long it would take for these rock formations to form. At the time, most Europeans believed that the Earth was around 6,000 years old, a figure that was based on the amount of time estimated for the events described in the Bible. One of the first to question this time scale was a Scottish geologist named James Hutton (1726-1797). Often described as the founder of modern geology, Hutton formulated a philosophy called uniformitarianism: The present is the key to the past. According to uniformitarianism, the same processes we see around us today operated in the past as well. For example, if erosion and deposition occur slowly now, they probably have always occurred slowly.\n\nHutton discovered places where sedimentary rock beds lie on an eroded surface. Such a formation is called an unconformity, or a gap in rock layers, where some rocks were eroded away. Hutton reconstructed the sequence of events that led to this formation. For example, consider the famous unconformity at Siccar Point, on the coast of Scotland (Figure 11.15).\n\nFigure 11.15: Hutton's Unconformity on the coast of Scotland.\n\nBased on figure 15, at least nine geological events can be inferred:\n\nA series of sedimentary beds is deposited on an ocean floor. The sediments harden into sedimentary rock. The sedimentary rocks are uplifted and tilted, exposing them above the ocean surface. The tilted beds are eroded by rain, ice, and wind to form an irregular surface. A sea covers the eroded sedimentary rock layers. New sedimentary layers are deposited. The new layers harden into sedimentary rock. These layers are tilted. Uplift occurs, exposing the new sedimentary rocks above the ocean surface.\n\nHutton realized that an enormous period of time was needed to account for the repeated episodes of deposition, rock formation, uplift, and erosion that led to the formation of an unconformity, like the one at Siccar Point. Hutton realized that the age of Earth should not be measured in thousands of years, but millions of years.\n\nMatching Rock Layers [ edit | edit source ]\n\nSuperposition and cross-cutting are helpful when rocks are touching one another, but are useless when rocks are kilometers or even continents apart. Three kinds of clues help geologists match rock layers across great distances. The first is the fact that some sedimentary rock formations span vast distances, recognizable across large regions. For example, the Pierre Shale formation can be recognized across the Great Plains, from New Mexico to North Dakota. The famous White Cliffs of Dover in southwest England can be matched to similar white cliffs in Denmark and Germany.\n\nA second clue could be the presence of a key bed, or a particularly distinctive layer of rock that can be recognized across a large area. Volcanic ash flows are often useful as key beds because they are widespread and easy to identify. Probably the most famous example of a key bed is a layer of clay found at the boundary between the Cretaceous Period and the Tertiary Period, the time that the dinosaurs went extinct (Figure 11.16). This thin layer of sediment, only a few centimeters thick, contains a high concentration of the element iridium. Iridium is rare on Earth but common in asteroids. In 1980, a team of scientists led by Luis Alvarez and his son Walter proposed that a huge asteroid struck Earth about 66 million years ago, causing forest fires, acid rain, and climate change that wiped out the dinosaurs.\n\nFigure 11.16: White layer of clay that marks the Cretaceous-Tertiary Boundary.\n\nFigure 11.17: Geologic time scale.\n\nA third type of clue that helps scientists compare different rock layers is index fossils. Recall that index fossils are the remains of organisms that were widespread but only existed for a relatively short period of time. If two rock units both contain the same type of index fossil, their age is probably very similar.\n\nAs scientists collected fossils from all over the world, they recognized that rocks of different ages contain distinctive types of fossils. This pattern led to the creation of the geologic time scale and helped to inspire Darwin's theory of evolution (Figure 11.17).\n\nEach era, period, and epoch of the geologic time scale is defined by the fossils that appeared at that time. For example, Paleozoic rocks typically contain trilobites, brachiopods, and crinoid fossils. The presence of dinosaur bones indicate that a rock is from the Mesozoic era, and the particular type of dinosaur will allow the rock to be identified as Triassic, Jurassic, or Cretaceous. The Cenozoic Era is also known as the Age of Mammals, and the Quaternary Period represents the time when the first humans spread across Earth.\n\nLesson Summary [ edit | edit source ]\n\nNicholas Steno first formulated the principles that allow scientists to determine the relative ages of rocks in the 17th century. Steno stated that sedimentary rocks are formed in continuous, horizontal layers, with younger layers on top of older layers. A century later, James Hutton discovered the law of cross-cutting relationships: a fault or igneous intrusion is younger than the rocks that it cuts through. Hutton also was the first to realize the vast amounts of time that would be needed to create an unconformity, a place where sedimentary rocks lie above an eroded surface.\n\nOther methods come into play when comparing rock layers that are separated by a large distance. Many sedimentary rock formations are large and can be recognized across a region. Distinctive rock layers, called key beds, are also useful for correlating rock units. Fossils, especially index fossils, are the most useful way to compare different rock layers. Changes of fossils over time led to the development of the geologic time scale.\n\nReview Questions [ edit | edit source ]\n\nIn the 15th century, a farmer finds a rock that looks exactly like a clamshell. What did the farmer probably conclude about how the fossil got there? Which of Steno's Laws is illustrated by each of the following images in Figure 11.18? What is the sequence of rock units in Figure 11.19, from oldest to youngest? What kind of geological formation is shown in the outcrop in Figure 11.20, and what sequence of events does it represent?

But the time scale given by fossils is only a relative scale, because it does not give the age of the rock in years, only its age relative to other layers. Long after the relative time scale was worked out from fossils, geologists developed methods for finding the absolute ages of rocks, in years before the present. These methods involve radioactivity. Here's how one of the important ones works.\n\nSome minerals contain atoms of the radioactive chemical element uranium. Now and then, an atom of uranium self-destructs to form an atom of lead. Scientists know the rate of self-destruction. They grind up a rock to collect tiny grains of minerals that started out containing some uranium but no lead. Then they use a very sensitive instrument, called a mass spectrometer, to measure how much of the uranium has been changed to lead. Using some simple mathematics, they can figure out how long ago the mineral first formed. It is possible to date rocks as old as four billion years this way.\n\nAbsolute dating of rocks has provided many \"tie points\" for the relative time scale developed from fossils. The result is an absolute time scale. When you collect a fossil from a rock, you can place it in the relative time scale. Then you also know about how old it is in years (or usually millions, or tens of millions, or hundreds of millions of years). Even though modern technology makes it possible to date some rocks, the relative time scale is still very important. This is because it takes a lot of time and money to obtain an absolute date, and not all rocks can be dated using radioactivity."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Amadeus-Grabau/6000000063008817027", "page_content": "About Amadeus William Grabau\n\nGrabau was a versatile scientist, a substantial contributor to systematic paleontology, an imaginative pioneer in stratigraphic geology, and a highly respected teacher and prolific writer. After spending the first half of his professional life in the United States, he went to China for the last twenty-five years. Grabau was the son of William Henry Grabau, a Lutheran pastor, and Maria von Rohr Grabau, who died when he was a small boy; he was the third of ten children. He was educated in parochial and public schools, becoming interested in natural history, first in botany and subsequently in paleontology and mineralogy. Correspondence with William O. Crosby at Massachusetts Institute of Technology led to his attending that institution; he received the B.S. in 1896. After a year as instructor he proceeded to graduate study at Harvard, gaining the M.S. and D.Sc. in 1898 and 1900.\n\nGrabau soon became professor of paleontology at Columbia University after a short stay (1899\u20131901) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. In the succeeding twenty years he became a leading scientist in paleontology, stratigraphy, and sedimentary petrology, as well as a highly respected teacher. During the hysteria of World War I, Grabau\u2019s tenure at Columbia was embittered by accusations of pro-German sympathies and hints and rumors originating at the highest levels. Moving to China in 1920, he became professor of paleontology at the National University and chief paleontologist of the Geological Survey of China.\n\nGrabau married Mary Antin, a Polish immigrant and a distinguished author and sociologist, in 1901. Her health was poor when he left for China, and she remained with a daughter in the United States. Grabau, rather a stocky man, suffered a deterioration of circulation that limited his capacity to work in the field during his later years in the United States; he became an invalid, requiring a wheelchair or requiring crutches after moving to China. Students, associates, and books increasingly became his sources of information.\n\nThe principal distinction of Grabau\u2019s work is his anticipation of several principles of stratigraphy and paleontology that were to become more generally recognized by later geologists. Of North American stratigraphers of the early years of the century, he seems to have been the best informed on the relationships in foreign lands. Yet he traveled to Europe only once, when he was over forty, and to Asia at the age of fifty. He was imaginative and philosphical. A pioneer in sedimentary petrology, he proposed a genetic classification of sedimentary rocks that strongly influenced advances in the field. Grabau early emphasized the importance of the environment of deposition in determining rock characters and organic assemblages: the field of paleoecology. He produced such theories as the polar control theory of climatic control through the movement of the crust over the interior of the earth, and the pulsation theory, which endeavored to attribute the changing distribution of lands and seas to fluctuations in sea level. Moreover, he made substantial contributions in paleontology, both in the systematic study of fossils of several classes and in the interpretation of their phylogeny and classification.\n\nThe relationship of marine bionomy to stratigraphy was the subject of a fifty-page paper published in 1899, a pioneering analysis of knowledge of the living conditions of modern organisms applied to the environment of ancient sedimentary rocks. The article is a masterly outline of the principles of what is now the science of paleoecology. Grabau early emphasized the impact of environment on the fauna and its relationship to the facies of the rocks, that the lateral changes in time-equivalent rocks might be analogous to their succession. In this respect he was a great admirer of Johannes Walther, who held similar views. Grabau was an antagonist of Edward Oscar Ulrich, the popular authority of the early twentieth century who held that faunas relate to marine invasions from several independent oceanic realms; and in general he concurred with Charles Schuchert in his emphasis on environment and lateral facies.\n\nIn paleontology Grabau was influenced in his interest in phylogeny and ontogeny by his association at Cambridge with the great paleobiologists Alpheus Hyatt and Robert T. Jackson. His own early studies were directed toward these ends, particularly his work on gastropods. Subsequently he prepared several monographs on such diverse subjects as Chinese Paleozoic corals, Devonian brachiopods, and Permian faunas; these were excellent systematic paleontologic treatises in the manner of the nineteenth-century classic monographs in North America, with attention to anatomic details that might relate to genetic relationships. He had the good fortune to be in Peking when the Peking man was discovered, and he advised on its study.\n\nGrabau\u2019s \u201cClassification of Sedimentary Rocks\u201d (American Geologist, 33 [1904]) was a portent of the emphasis on the interpretation of origin, as well as texture and composition, in the classification of the deposited rocks. The original terminology was cumbersome in its having Latin-based names formed from terms for origin, texture, and composition; thus hydrosilicarenyte referred to a marine-laid quartz rock with the texture of sand. The use of a genetic term introduced a subjective element that deterred the direct application of the classification to the rock specimens. Adopted only reluctantly in the beginning, the textural-composition elements became widely used in the middle years of the century, only to be succeeded by other, more sophisticated classifications that further emphasize the aspects he recognized as most pertinent. Thus, Grabau had a great influence in directing the critical study of sedimentary petrology.\n\nEarly excursions in the Buffalo, New York, region brought Grabau into contact with the deposits of the continental glaciers. In the 1930\u2019s he developed the polar control theory of the distribution of climatic zones through the geologic record. He thought that the poles remained stable with respect to the earth\u2019s interior, retaining latitudinal climatic zones, but that the outer crust wandered from these poles. Thus the changing relations of continents to poles caused climatic changes, such as led to glaciation. In his day only a heretic could question the relative permanence of present relationships; half a century later, such a hypothesis came to be appreciably reasonable.\n\nGrabau further believed that the continents once formed a single continental mass, Pangaea, that had been disrupted through relative movements among its dismembered parts. Thus, he was an early protagonist of a theory of continental drift, but one different from those devised by Frank B. Taylor and Alfred Wegener. He thought mountains were rising at the fore of the shifting continental plates and volcanism was at their rear. These theories were ingenious and nearly plausible, for few stratigraphic geologists had Grabau\u2019s broad grasp of world geology or his interest in its collation. With the great advances in geophysical science in the latter half of the twentieth century, many such conjectures became subject to more rigorous analysis. Although Grabau could not have anticipated some of this present knowledge, his concepts of the nature of continental movements and climatic zonations have much to commend them.\n\nThe pulsation theory attributed the distribution of the principal stratigraphic units to great rhythmic advances and regressions of the seas, which were in turn dependent on restriction and expansion of capacities of ocean basins: eustatic control. He gave distinctive names to his pulsation systems, such as Taconian, Cambrian, Cambrovician, Skiddavian, Ordovician, Silurian, and Siluronian. Fourteen of these cycles were placed in the Paleozoic era, five in the Mesozoic, and two in the Cenozoic, partially to replace the conventional systems. He thought each pulsation had had a duration of about 30 million years, the contraction of seas at the close of each period leading to marked changes in organisms.\n\nPerhaps Grabau thought his pulsation theory was his greatest contribution, for he wrote many volumes endeavoring to relate the distribution of lands and seas to pulsing transgressions and retrogressions and saying that it was further controlled by provincial warping movements accentuating or reversing the effects, of the eustatic movements. As has been the case with other endeavors to alter the general geologic classification, based appreciably on historical accidents rather than on clearly natural principles, authorities have never agreed on more ubiquitous natural spans and thus continue to use the established systems.\n\nThe greatest effect of Grabau\u2019s scientific work probably has been in his contributions to the principles of paleoecology and to the genetic aspects of sedimentary petrology. His stratigraphic work was influential in bringing about a three-dimensional attitude toward sedimentary rock distribution, rather than merely emphasizing the faunal correlation of exposed rock sections. His stratigraphy was dynamic, the source of understanding earth movements. He anticipated the attitudes that became prevalent when the petroleum industry added knowledge of subsurface sections to that of the surface outcrops. The concepts involved in his polar control theory, pulsation theory, and the separation of Pangaea encouraged imaginative syntheses of geologic evidence. This heritage, brought to his students and associates, has contributed far beyond the words and thoughts that he recorded.\n\nThe esteem in which Grabau was held was reflected in the honors and prizes that he received but was shown more fittingly in the commemorative volumes that were published by Chinese geologists on his sixtieth birthday and in his burial within the gates of the National University. Among his greatest contributions were the stimulus that he gave to scientific life in China and the instruction and enthusiasm that was productive in his many students. For example, in the first ten years of his residence in China, nineteen of the twenty-five monographs of Palaeontologia sinica were prepared by his students.\n\nGrabau was a fellow of the Geological Society of America, the New York Academy of Science (vicepresident, 1906\u20131907), and the Geological Society of China (vice-president, 1925); corresponding member of the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences and the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher; and an honorary member of the Peking Society of Natural History, the China Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, the Academia Sinica, and the Academia Peipinensis.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nI. Original Works. Grabau was the author of some 300 publications, of which more than a score were substantial monographs and other books. The full bibliography is listed in the publications in the secondary literature. The principal volumes are listed in three categories: paleontological studies, stratigraphic studies, and textbooks and collative works.\n\nThe paleontological treatises contain substantial systematic descriptions of fossil organisms. Because his associates were exploring in regions that had not been known, the greatest contributions are to faunas from China: Phylogeny of Fusus and Its Allies (Washington, D. C., 1904); Ordovician Fossils From North China (Peking, 1922); Silurian Faunas of Eastern Yunnan (Peking, 1926);Paleozoic Corals of China (Peking, 1928); Devonian Brachiopods of China (Peking, 1931); and Early Permian Fossils of China, 2 vols. (Peking, 1934\u20131936). The Relations of Marine Bionomy to Stratigraphy (Buffalo, 1899) is a substantial introduction to the field of paleoecology.\n\nIn stratigraphic geology, Grabau\u2019s first publications were descriptions of stratigraphic sequences in various localities: Geology and Paleontology of Eighteen Mile Creek and the Lakesbore Section of Erie County, New York (Buffalo. 1898); Guide to the Geology and Paleontology of Niagara Falls and Vicinity (Albany, 1901); \u201cClassification of Sedimentary Rocks,\u201d in American Geologist, 33 (1904), 228\u2013247 and Guide to the Geology and Paleontology of the Schoharie Valley in Eastern New York, (Albany, 1906). The Monroe Formation of Southern Michigan and Adjacent Regions (Lansing, Mich., 1910) was prepared with W. H. Sherzer. The Permian of Mongolia (New York, 1931) included description of faunas collected on the central Asia expeditions of the American Museum of Natural History. The Stratigraphy of China was essentially a summary of knowledge. Probably his best-known work is The Principles of Stratigraphy (New York, 1913), repr. with preface by Marshall Kay (New York, 1960), one of the most influential texts of the early twentieth century.\n\nGrabau published Textbook of Geology, 2 vols. (New York. 1920\u20131921), which did not receive wide usage. His five-volume Paleozoic Formations in the Light of the Pulsation Theory (Peking. 1936\u20131938), intended to be the first encyclopedic summary of world stratigraphy, was developed to support his pulsation theory. Rhythm of the Ages (Peking, 1940) and the posthumously published, twenty year-old MS of The World We Live In (Taipei, 1961), were popular summaries of his philosophy. North American Index Fossils (New York, 1909\u20131910), written with W. H. Shimer, with illustrations of more than 2,000 distinctive invertebrate fossils, was the standard reference work for more than thirty years. He also published Principles of Salt Deposition (New York, 1920).\n\nII. Secondary Literature. The full bibliography of Grabau is contained in three biographic papers, H. W. Shimer, in Proceedings of the Geological Society of America for 1946 (1947), 161\u2013166; V. K. Ting in Grabau Anniversary. the commemorative vol. presented to Grabau on his fiftieth birthday, Bulletin of the Geological Society of China, 10 (l931). ix-xviii; and the intro. to The World We Live In (Taipei, 1961), xii-xxv.\n\nMarshall Kay"}]}
