What can one answer to these arguments, which seem to echo our most endearing notions and intuitions about the nature of science? Can we really deny that science and philosophy are two different worlds; that their subject matters and methods differ? Can we deny that science seeks to explain brute matters that are quite independent of human life? Can we deny the fact that unquestioned philosophical preconceptions have at times been hampering factors of scientific progress? Of course, we can\u2019t, as I hinted at in the previous Section: philosophy corrupts the youth\u2014I think we all need to start from that. But that\u2019s only one side of the story, and not the most interesting part for us.\n\nAs I will argue, the doctrine that philosophy is useless for science is not only false: it is also harmful for education, society, and ultimately science itself. I will do this by advancing three arguments for the usefulness of philosophy for the natural sciences. These arguments include refutations of the misconceptions presented in Sect. 2. They are neither wholly original nor exhaustive, but they should be a first step towards the development of a synergetic relationship between philosophy and the natural sciences.\n\nGiven the tensions between science and philosophy, vividly expressed by physicists such as Stephen Hawking and Lawrence Krauss in recent works, trying to gain some clarity in this confused subject is by itself an important and urgent task.\n\na) Why philosophy is useful (Ad 2a)) i. The fallacy of anti-philosophicalism\n\nLet me start with a simple contention that responds to a small, logical, part of the previous arguments: what I have called the fallacy of anti-philosophicalism and its refutation. The refuting argument boils down to something like this: \u201cIn order to argue that one does not need philosophy, one must do philosophy.\u201d Indeed, a convincing argument to the effect that \u201cphilosophy is useless for science\u201d will necessarily entail the act of philosophizing. Even if \u2018useful\u2019 is a practical notion, arguing for the uselessness of discipline A for discipline B requires philosophical knowledge about B: one needs to argue that A is irrelevant to the subject matter, method, and goals of B. To declare categorically the uselessness of philosophy for science is therefore to have complete knowledge of the goals, method, and subject matter of science. But one can only argue about what those goals and subject matter should be by doing philosophy\u2014more specifically, philosophy of science. Furthermore, we can only infer general statements about the usefulness of philosophy for science, from the study of a limited number of historical cases, by appending that study with a philosophical argument: hence by doing philosophy, in the way that historians and philosophers of science do it.\n\nDoes this debunk the argument about the death of philosophy? I submit that it does. For he who wants to insist on philosophy being useless for science must not try to rationally argue for this conviction, but must keep it as a matter of private opinion: for as soon as he starts to rationalize his view, he must start philosophizing. If there is some truth in that, as Hawking announces, philosophy is dead\u2014and there may be some sense in which this is true\u2014and that \u201cScientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge\u201d, then scientists can only do so by becoming philosophers of science themselves, hence resurrecting philosophy. Hawking acknowledges this by engaging in the discipline he has declared to be \u2018dead\u2019, thereby becoming a philosopher. Indeed, training in philosophy has at least this use, that it prevents us from being bad philosophers.\n\nBut, when arguing for the usefulness of philosophy, a logical argument is not necessarily the most convincing one. For it might lead us to replace the fallacy by a more cautious statement: \u201cphilosophy is useless for science, except for one thing: to argue that philosophy has no other use for science whatever.\u201d Nevertheless, the fact that the former statement was false and the latter sounds arbitrary and contrived, leads us to question the soundness of an approach that declares philosophy to be close to useless. It might lead us to the idea that perhaps there is some genuine value in philosophy which is useful or even necessary for science and for scientists after all. I will defend the view that philosophy is useful to scientists, and that some amount of philosophical activity is necessary in order to construct a theoretical framework for doing science.\n\nii. Paradigms and presuppositions (why science can\u2019t live without philosophy)\n\nThe necessity of philosophy for science can easily be understood from a Kuhnian perspective on how science develops. Thomas Kuhn explicates progress in science not as a linear process of theoretical formulation and experimental verification or refutation of scientific theories, but in terms of revolutions and changes of paradigm (Kuhn 1962). A paradigm is for Kuhn not a cookbook recipe about the mathematical laws and mechanical workings of the universe or a set of equations and technical terms and procedures. Paradigms include ways of looking at the world, practices of instrumentation, traditions of research, shared values and beliefs about which questions are considered to be scientific. Nowadays we might want to stretch this concept even further to include institutional conditions, governmental constraints and market stimuli that may be supportive of particular paradigms.Footnote 4 Scientists working in different paradigms view the world in different ways, Kuhn has emphasized. Their basic assumptions about the kinds of entities there are in the world differ, as do the kinds of primary properties they attribute to those entities. Scientists working in different paradigms may disagree, as did Einstein and Bohr, about what makes a good theory or a good explanation; or about what it means to understand a problem. In other words, there are a wide range of ontological, epistemic, and ethical presuppositions weaved into any given scientific paradigm (for some examples of this, see Sect. 4b). If it is the case that a paradigm cannot come to birth, gain support, defeat its competitors, consolidate, and eventually die without such a set of explicit or at least tacit presuppositions, then presuppositions must be an intrinsic and necessary part of science regarded as a pursuit of truth. Such philosophical presuppositions are contributory to scientific theories, even if the theories are formally independent of them, because axioms cannot even be formulated without an agreement, taken from common and technical language, and justified within a wider paradigm, over what the terms mean and what kinds of entities they apply to; without implicit or explicit assumptions about how the terms relate to experimentally measurable quantities; without prescriptions for how the results of the theory can be verified or falsified. Paradigms also suggest meaningful goals and open questions for the theory. Thus philosophy plays a heuristic role in the discovery of new scientific theories (de Regt 2004): paradigms can function as guides towards the formulation of theories that describe entities of one type or another. As de Regt has cogently argued (see also the examples in the next Section), many great scientific innovators have at some point studied the works of philosophers and developed philosophical views of their own. This did not always happen very systematically, but the interest in philosophy developed by these scientists was at least above average and in turn had an important heuristic function in the formulation of new scientific theories (de Regt 2004).\n\nImplicit in the heuristic role of philosophy is also an important analytic function, as I stressed in Sect. 4.Footnote 5 One task of philosophy is to scrutinize the concepts and presuppositions of scientific theories, to analyse and lay bare what is implicit in a particular scientific paradigm. It is a philosophical task\u2014one which is often carried out by physicists\u2014to clarify the concepts of space, time, matter, energy, information, causality, etc. that figure in a given theory. This analysis is philosophical in so far as it makes explicit the implicit assumptions in the uses of these concepts: assumptions that scientific theories do not themselves normally state. Hence it moves beyond the point where the concepts appear as irreducible elements in the postulates of a theory. This analytic function should ultimately allow for a further step of integration, where the concepts of one science are related to the concepts of another.\n\nThe analytic function of philosophy might not only feed back into science, but become a starting point for philosophy itself: discovering what entities science assumes there to be in the world can be a useful starting point for philosophical reflection on nature. It seems key that philosophical stances on nature and science be compatible with the kinds of objects and relations that science finds. In the example given earlier: mechanistic philosophy did not admit the concept of action at a distance because the only forces allowed by the dominant philosophical paradigm were mechanical, hence the opposition to Newton\u2019s gravity theory; whereas Kepler\u2019s Pythagoreanism did allow for such a concept.Footnote 6\n\nTo summarize, then, some of the tasks for philosophy that we have found in relation to science:\n\n1. To allow for, indeed to naturally incorporate into its own framework and build upon, the kinds of entities that science encounters in the world, and their properties and relations;Footnote 7 2. To scrutinize the terms and presuppositions of science, i.e. to make explicit the implicit assumptions of scientific theories: to critically analyse and clarify what the terms used by science mean, how they are articulated, and what assumptions they require, as well as how they relate to the entities that philosophy argues there to be in the world; 3. To discover standards for what good theories, valid modes of explanation, and appropriate scientific methods are: to offer an epistemology that does not thwart, but stimulates scientific progress; 4. To provide ethical guidance and discover (broad) goals for science; 5. To point out and articulate the interrelations between concepts that are found in different domains of the natural sciences as well as the social sciences and the humanities; 6. To explain how observations fit in the broader picture of the world, and to create a language where scientific results and broader human experience can complement and mutually enrich each other.\n\nThis list is neither exhaustive nor unique. Some of these general ideas will be instantiated in the two examples given in the next section.\n\nThe above points to a necessary relationship between science and philosophy. Science needs philosophy, as we have seen, in its two functions: heuristic, and analytic. Especially during changes of paradigm, philosophical debate will be part of the activities of science. None of this is to say that scientists need to be philosophers: most of them are not. So, philosophers may be drawn in at that point. But it is also not to say that professional philosophers should be doing all of the above tasks. Part of those tasks\u2014surely 1 to 4\u2014are often performed by scientists. Thus what I envisage here is a collaboration between scientists and philosophers. Indeed, I think we should be careful in distinguishing the disciplinary differences from the professional or individual ones. Saying that science, as a systematic theoretical and experimental study of the natural world, needs philosophy\u2014which I have defined, in the analytic tradition, as the study of all the results of the sciences and humanities using the method of conceptual analysis\u2014is not to say that each scientist requires philosophy. Philosophy may be merely a useful tool for scientists.\n\nb) Why the historical argument fails: quantum information, alive and kicking (Ad 2b))\n\nIn this section, I give two examples where philosophical discussion has been genuinely contributory to science, along the lines discussed in 4a)ii. Before I do that, I will address the negative examples given in 2b)\u2014examples where philosophy\u2019s influence was rather hampering: the iron clad of mechanistic philosophy and Plato\u2019s dictum that celestial motions should be along circles.\n\nWorking from 4a)ii we can now easily see that these examples in fact become a case in point: they illustrate the importance of philosophy for science. They make clear the need for having the right philosophical framework when doing science. If a conceptual enterprise such as philosophy were completely neutral, or indeed useless, to science, it could not be harmful to it in any important way either. But the fact is that: (A) some philosophical doctrines have been harmful for science while others have been productive; (B) it is impossible to have no philosophy at all (as I argued in 4a)); (C) the reason philosophy was harmful in some cases is because it was used in a positive way, according to its heuristic function from 4a)ii. And this heuristic function can indeed also be used positively. The correct course of action, then, is not to neglect philosophy\u2014because, as per (A) and (B), philosophy can\u2019t be neglected\u2014but to embrace its presence and to use it in an intelligent and positive way, as in (C). It follows from (A) to (C) that philosophy must be relevant to science in its own specific way, even if it is only in the manner of setting necessary intellectual preconditions of freedom of mind, of trust in the power of reason and of experimental observation, etc. History shows that it is hard for scientists to free themselves from outdated philosophical modes of thought. This highlights the importance of investing in having a philosophical framework that allows for the kinds of entities that science encounters in the world. Specific tasks for philosophy are as listed in 4a)ii.\n\nNext we will study positive historical examples where 4a)ii is at work, thereby refuting the historical argument formulated in 2b). To refute the historical argument, it suffices to show one example where philosophy has been genuinely contributory to the progress of science. The example will be interesting in so far as it also sheds light on why it was that philosophy contributed to science, thus instantiating elements of 4a)ii. There are many such examples. KeplerFootnote 8 and Sommerfeld were both inspired by Pythagorean philosophical ideas when working out their models of the harmonies of the solar system and of the atom, respectively. Let me here concentrate on another, more recent, example. It concerns the current revolution in quantum information technology. In the past ten years we have seen the first commercialization of quantum randomness: the first bank transaction built on the basis of a code encrypted not by the usual algorithms of classical cryptography (which rely on unproven mathematical assumptions such as the difficulty in factorizing large prime numbers), but based on the new field of quantum cryptography: a technique for encoding messages based on the notion of entanglement between particles at long distances. Quantum cryptography has been successfully developed and commercialized by several groups over the past twenty years or so.\n\nAs it turns out, the quantum information revolution is rooted in the efforts of scientists who saw philosophical enquiry as a necessary step in their quest for knowledge. There are two key moments in the history of quantum mechanics when physical progress crucially depended on asking the right philosophical questions. Let me take these two episodes as case studies of the question how philosophical ideas influence science, in terms of philosophy\u2019s heuristic and analytic functions.\n\ni. Einstein versus quantum mechanics\n\nIn 1927, conflicting views on quantum physics started to crystallize. Towards the end of the 5th Solvay conference in Brussels, Werner Heisenberg declared quantum mechanics to be a \u201cclosed theory, whose fundamental physical and mathematical assumptions are no longer susceptible of any modification\u201d (Bacciagaluppi and Valentini 2006, p. 437). In doing so, Heisenberg was voicing the shared feelings of his colleagues Niels Bohr, Wolfgang Pauli, and Paul Dirac, also present at the conference. But Einstein and Schr\u00f6dinger would have none of it: the Copenhagen interpretation\u2014as the new view of quantum mechanics came to be known\u2014had philosophical implications that they deemed undesirable. Among those properties was the lack of determinacy in physical quantities and events. Also, Heisenberg and co. seemed to introduce a possible role for human observers in the definition of the concepts that went into science.\n\nA few years later, in 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen made the nature of their discomfort with quantum theory explicit in a famous article that came to be known as the EPR thought experiment. They considered pairs of correlated particles separated at long distances. The possibility to measure a property (for example, the momentum) of the first particle automatically gives information about the value of that property for the second particle, without measuring that property for the second particle, since the particles are in a state of correlation. And the possibility to measure the complementary property (for example, the position) of the first particle would as well determine the value of that quantity for the second particle. But because of the assumption that measurements done on the first particle cannot affect the properties of the second particle (after all, the particles are well-separated), the second particle must have had the values of its position and momentum determined before any measurements were done on the first particle (since, according to the formalism of quantum mechanics, a measurement of the first particle determines the value of that property for the other particle, in both cases). Since, according to standard quantum mechanics, a particle cannot simultaneously have determinate values for both its position and its momentum, this means that quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory: for it does not predict properties for the second particle that, according to the argument, it can clearly have.\n\nThe EPR argument is philosophical in the sense explained earlier, in Sect. 3: for it analyses the foundations of quantum mechanics, trying to think clearly about the assumptions being made by standard quantum mechanics. But it also contains two substantive ontological assumptions. The first is what EPR call the \u2018criterion of reality\u2019 that if, using the formalism of quantum mechanics, one can predict with probability one the result of a measurement, then there is an element of physical reality corresponding to the physical quantity, with value equal to the predicted value of the measurement. The second assumption is what they call \u2018locality\u2019: namely, that elements of physical reality pertaining to one system cannot be affected by measurements performed on another system that is spacelike separated from the first.\n\nThus EPR\u2019s quest was both physical and philosophical. In addition to these two ontological assumptions, they also impose \u2018completeness\u2019 as an epistemic desideratum that a theory should satisfy: namely, that \u2018every element of the physical reality must have a counterpart in the physical theory\u2019.\n\nThis led EPR to push the physical arguments farther than anybody had ever done before. The study of paradoxes borne out by thought experiments such as EPR has always played a major role in physics; but the resolution of such paradoxical situations almost invariably requires a philosophical stance about the principles and methods that are valued and deemed legitimate.\n\nThe EPR paper was truly philosophical in so far at it analysed and questioned the conceptual foundations of quantum theory. Especially EPR\u2019s construal of the notion of completeness, and their criterion of reality, are explicit epistemic and ontological positions.\n\nDoes this mean that Einstein was being professional philosophers while he worked on that paper? Of course not. One should distinguish doing philosophy\u2014something that, like I said before, can be done by both physicists and philosophers\u2014from one\u2019s professional label. Einstein was doing the philosophy that physics required at that point in time\u2014and it was philosophy because he was reflecting on, and critically and constructively engaging with, the conceptual foundations of quantum theory. To do that, he needed philosophical tools. But he was of course also doing physics. So, by bringing philosophical methods into physics, he was advancing physics. I believe it is artificial, at such interdisciplinary intersections, to attempt to make too fixed a demarcation between physics and philosophy. Einstein was simply doing ground-breaking work that required methods from both fields.\n\nii. Physics and the hippies\n\nThe next episode in this story of physics and philosophy took place many years later. After the publication of EPR, physicists continued to philosophize about the interpretation of quantum mechanics, but eventually the discussion died out. During the cold war, science and in particular physics gained much prestige. As class sizes grew, increasingly less time was spent on big questions and philosophical debates in the classrooms. While part of the reason for this decrease of attention on philosophical issues may have been pragmatic\u2014philosophical discussions with large groups of students are hard to manage, and grading essay questions in exams is significantly more time consuming than computational questions\u2014a vision was certainly at play about what education in science and technology should prepare students for. The interpretation of quantum mechanics was unlikely to prepare students who could provide societies with new gadgets or governments with new powerful weapons, whereas technical mastery of the formulas actually might. The old generation of physicists had received thorough training in the humanities\u2014Werner Heisenberg once said \u201cMy mind was formed by studying philosophy, Plato and that sort of thing\u201d (Buckley and Peat 1996, p. 6) and they had indulged in philosophical musings about the meaning of it all. Now the new generation of strong-headed physicists uttered the war whoop \u201cShut up and calculate\u201d and instructed their students to rally behind their utilitarian flag. Making gadgets was the new goal of physics.\n\nThe instrumentalist view of science regnant during the decades after the war is explained by Lee Smolin as follows: \u201cWhen I learned physics in the 1970s, it was almost as if we were being taught to look down on people who thought about foundational problems. When we asked about the foundational issues in quantum theory, we were told that no one fully understood them but that concern with them was no longer part of science. The job was to take quantum mechanics as given and apply it to new problems. The spirit was pragmatic; \u201cShut up and calculate\u201d was the mantra. People who couldn\u2019t let go of their misgivings over the meaning of quantum theory were regarded as losers who couldn\u2019t do the work.\u201d (Smolin 2007, p. 312).\n\nBut instrumentalism had to give way to other kinds of motivation for doing physics. Economic recession, budget cuts, and the decrease in the number of physics jobs made class sizes decrease again. Physicists once again had the time to think about the meaning of what they were doing. In a second, seemingly unrelated line of developments, the CIA, afraid that Americans would lag behind the Soviets, decided to fund laser physicist Harald Puthoff at Stanford University\u2019s SRI lab in Menlo Park, California, for the study of psychic phenomena. Additional money came from NASA. Soon Puthoff would be associated with a third strand of events around the Bay Area. A dubious consortium of hippie physicists and quasi-crackpots formed an unlikely discussion group. They alternated their musings about all things quantum and the meaning of life with drinking parties and psychedelic drug use. They came to be known as the Fundamental Fysiks Group and eventually found a generous patron in self-help industry forerunner and multi-millionaire guru Werner Erhard. One goal of the hippie scientists was to use quantum mechanics for superluminal (faster-than-light) communication. This would include communication with their deceased colleagues. Needless to say, many of their arguments were misguided, but their contribution to physics was of lasting endurance. They not only put the interpretation of quantum mechanics on the research and teaching agenda; they analysed the EPR arguments and the important contributions to this discussion made by John Bell, David Bohm, and others, which had escaped the attention of scientists until then; they helped clarify the issues at stake, developed new thought experiments of their own, and raised awareness that quantum nonlocality might be useful in long-distance communication. Save the crucial (wrong) conclusion that superluminal communication was possible, several set-ups and techniques the hippies considered did not differ significantly from the ones that quantum communication uses nowadays. As David Kaiser has argued (Kaiser 2012, p. xxiii), \u201cThe group\u2019s efforts helped to bring sustained attention to the interpretation of quantum mechanics back into the classroom. And in a few critical instances, their work instigated major breakthroughs that\u2014with hindsight\u2014we may now recognize as laying crucial groundwork for quantum information science.\u201d\n\nLike Einstein, the Fundamental Fysiks Group worked at the intersection of physics and philosophy. They brought philosophical methods and literature to bear on problems in physics, and as such they did the kind of work that I argue physics periodically needs\u2014regardless of who does that work, whether it is the physicists themselves or the professional philosophers.\n\nThe two examples illustrate some of the tasks of philosophy for science listed in Sect. 4a)ii. Progress in fundamental issues such as entanglement and quantum communication stemmed from physicists\u2019 willingness to engage in debates about ontological and epistemic issues such as the role of the observer, the completeness of the mathematical description of nature, the desiderata for a good description of nature, and so on. Progress not driven by such philosophical questions is hard to imagine in this case; the philosophical debate that actually took place acted as a positive, guiding force that pushed science further; fuelled by the posing of legitimate and relevant philosophical questions in their quest for new physics, by their being insistent on philosophical clarity and coherence rather than content with just technical mastery of the formulas, which was the trend of the day.\n\nc) Synergy between science and philosophy (on objects and methods) (Ad 2c))\n\nThere are two sides to the objection regarding the difference between science and philosophy as forms of scholarship: subject matters on the one hand, methodology on the other.\n\nI will be brief about the distinction in subject matter. Philosophy studies every subject matter that the sciences also study (recall my \u2018philosophy of X\u2019 from Sect. 3), but it does this with different aims and methods. The universe, possible universes other than our own, elementary particles, life, are all subjects of concern for both natural science and philosophy. Therefore, on those overlaps science and philosophy cannot be distinguished on the basis of their subject matters alone. The difference is often sought in their formal objects and methodologies: the earlier mentioned distinction between erkl\u00e4ren and verstehen could be reframed as the statement that the natural sciences seek explanations in the modes of causal efficacy and material causation, whereas philosophy is interested in formal analysis, goals, and intentionality. This difference in methodology is often summed up by the mantra: \u2018philosophy asks why-questions, science asks how-questions\u2019. And I agree: their methods are different, and their aims (in particular, the specific interest from which they study \u2018the same subject matter\u2019) are also different. But I also submit that any such division cannot be made once and for all\u2014the division is both vague at any point in time, as well as dynamical.\n\nBy declaring that there is such a division of intellectual activities, natural scientists and philosophers can comfortably go about their work without competing or stepping on each other\u2019s shoes. But, as I am suggesting, the mantra is as comfortable as it is lacking in accuracy in fully reflecting the nature of the relationship between science and philosophy. Agreed: science and philosophy are in principle different forms of scholarship. For established fields of science such as classical mechanics or electromagnetism, there may be much truth in the statement that science is practically interested in how-questions, defined by the framework of the particular paradigm one is working in. But that is so only because a number of why-questions have been answered within the wider paradigm and are not being questioned any further. When paradigms are in the making, there is no clear-cut distinction between the scholar asking the how-questions and the scholar asking the why-questions. Any how-question may lead us to a why-question, and any answer to a why-question may lead us to answers to multiple how-questions. When placed in front of a why-question in the quest for a new theory, the scientist cannot retreat into the shell of specialism. He or she must struggle with the question using whichever intellectual means are available. He or she may need to establish, as the founding fathers of quantum mechanics attempted to do, what a measurement is before they can convincingly argue that there is such a thing as uncertainty in the microscopic world. The scientific quest presupposes having a number of philosophical issues settled first: or, at least, it presupposes engaging with the various conceptual options, and taking a stance on them. In so doing, the subject matters and methods of philosophers and of scientists become entangled: the relationship between science and philosophy becomes dynamical.\n\nThis is particularly true in our time, when science has expanded into realms\u2014from far-away galaxies to the multiverse to neuroscience to molecular engineering\u2014that were unknown territory just a number of decades before. Science is aimed at truth about the natural world, and although methodological distinctions can be made formally, one must be aware of their limitations: in particular, it would be wrong to conclude that a methodological distinction allows us to dismiss philosophy for the sake of science.\n\nThis brings us to another point: if science needs philosophy, scientific results should also be the starting point of philosophical reflection about nature. It is probably here that Hawking\u2019s criticism of philosophy has an important core of truth to it (see footnote 1).\n\nThere is another reason why science needs philosophy. Scientific knowledge is not technical specialism cut off from the rest of human knowledge. The moment this happens would signal the forthcoming death of science. Scientific results constitute knowledge to be integrated into the broader human quest for answers about ourselves and about the universe. Philosophy helps the scientist articulate her findings in a kind of knowledge that can be shared with others, not experts in her field; it will help her discuss with other intellectuals and contribute to the general human task of getting to know the world and ourselves better.\n\nTo summarize my main argument so far: the relationship between science and philosophy may be in bad shape, and philosophy may be in bad shape, but it cannot be dead as long as we are trying to understand the universe around us. Historically, philosophy has been very influential for science, as has science been for philosophy. Any instances where philosophy had a negative effect on science in fact contribute to highlighting the importance of thinking carefully about the relation between philosophy and science. Science cannot do without philosophy because there are philosophical stances implicit in the presuppositions and goals of any scientific paradigm and in how theories are connected to reality: and it is the task of philosophy of science to critically engage with those presuppositions. Thus science needs philosophy to scrutinize those presuppositions, stances, and goals. And philosophical tools are sometimes required to make progress\u2014as the EPR and quantum information revolution illustrate. Finally, science requires philosophy to connect its findings to the rest of human knowledge. Philosophy can act as a language connecting disciplines that are far away from each other.\n\nSince the subject matters of science and of philosophy are partially overlapping, formal or methodological distinctions between science and philosophy only have limited ranges of applicability and certainly do not imply independence of the two disciplines. In other words, the boundaries between science and philosophy are not water-tight, nor should they be."}, {"url": "https://undsci.berkeley.edu/the-philosophy-of-science/", "page_content": "In this website, we use a practical checklist to get a basic picture of what \u200b\u200bscience is and a flexible flowchart to depict how science works. For most everyday purposes, this gives us a fairly complete picture of what science is and is not. However, there is an entire field of rigorous academic study that deals specifically with what science is, how it works, and the logic through which we build scientific knowledge. This branch of philosophy is handily called the philosophy of science. Many of the ideas that we present in this website are a rough synthesis of some new and some old ideas from the philosophy of science.\n\nDespite its straightforward name, the field is complex and remains an area of current inquiry. Philosophers of science actively study such questions as:\n\nWhat is a \u200b\u200blaw of nature? Are there any in non-physical sciences like biology and psychology?\n\nWhat kind of \u200b\u200bdata can be used to distinguish between real causes and accidental regularities?\n\nHow much \u200b\u200bevidence and what kinds of evidence do we need before we accept \u200b\u200bhypotheses?\n\nWhy do scientists continue to rely on \u200b\u200bmodels and \u200b\u200btheories which they know are at least partially inaccurate (like Newton\u2019s physics)?\n\nThough they might seem elementary, these questions are actually quite difficult to answer satisfactorily. Opinions on such issues vary widely within the field (and occasionally part ways with the views of scientists themselves \u2014 who mainly spend their time doing science, not analyzing it abstractly). Despite this diversity of opinion, philosophers of science can largely agree on one thing: there is no single, simple way to define science!\n\nThough the field is highly specialized, a few touchstone ideas have made their way into the mainstream. Here\u2019s a quick explanation of just a few concepts associated with the philosophy of science, which you might (or might not) have encountered.\n\nEpistemology \u2014 branch of philosophy that deals with what knowledge is, how we come to \u200b\u200baccept some things as true, and how we justify that acceptance.\n\n\u2014 branch of philosophy that deals with what knowledge is, how we come to \u200b\u200baccept some things as true, and how we justify that acceptance.

Paradigm shifts and scientific revolutions \u2014 a view of science, associated with philosopher Thomas Kuhn, which suggests that the history of science can be divided up into times of normal science (when scientists add to, elaborate on, and work with a central, accepted scientific theory) and briefer periods of revolutionary science. Kuhn asserted that during times of revolutionary science, anomalies refuting the accepted theory have built up to such a point that the old theory is broken down and a new one is built to take its place in a so-called \u201cparadigm shift.\u201d\n\nWho\u2019s who in the philosophy of science\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about the philosophy of science, you might want to begin your investigation with some of the big names in the field:\n\nAristotle (384-322 BC) \u2014 Arguably the founder of both science and philosophy of science. He wrote extensively about the topics we now call physics, astronomy, psychology, biology, and chemistry, as well as logic, mathematics, and epistemology.\n\nFrancis Bacon (1561-1626) \u2014 Promoted a scientific method in which scientists gather many \u200b\u200bfacts from observations and \u200b\u200bexperiments, and then make \u200b\u200binductive inferences about patterns in nature.\n\nRene Descartes (1596-1650) \u2014 Mathematician, scientist, and philosopher who promoted a scientific method that emphasized deduction from first principles. These ideas, as well as his mathematics, influenced Newton and other figures of the Scientific Revolution.\n\nPiere Duhem (1861-1916) \u2014 Physicist and philosopher who defended an extreme form of empiricism. He argued that we cannot draw conclusions about the existence of unobservable entities conjectured by our theories such as atoms and molecules.\n\nCarl Hempel (1905-1997) \u2014 Developed influential theories of scientific explanation and theory confirmation. He argued that a phenomenon is \u201cexplained\u201d when we can see that it is the logical consequence of a law of nature. He championed a hypothetico-deductive account of confirmation, similar to the way we characterize \u201cmaking a \u200b\u200bscientific argument\u201d in this website.\n\nKarl Popper (1924-1994) \u2014 Argued that falsifiability is both the hallmark of scientific theories and the proper methodology for scientists to employ. He believed that scientists should always regard their theories with a skeptical eye, seeking every opportunity to try to falsify them.\n\nThomas Kuhn (1922-1996) \u2014 Historian and philosopher who argued that the picture of science developed by logical empiricists such as Popper didn\u2019t resemble the history of science. Kuhn famously distinguished between normal science, where scientists solve puzzles within a particular framework or paradigm, and revolutionary science, when the paradigm gets overturned.\n\nPaul Feyerabend (1924-1994) \u2014 A rebel within the philosophy of science. He argued that there is no scientific method or, in his words, \u201canything goes.\u201d Without regard to rational guidelines, scientists do whatever they need to in order to come up with new ideas and persuade others to accept them.\n\nEvelyn Fox Keller (1936-) \u2014 Physicist, historian, and one of the pioneers of feminist philosophy of science, exemplified in her study of Barbara McClintock and the history of genetics in the 20th century.\n\nElliott Sober (1948-) \u2014 Known for his work on \u200b\u200bparsimony and the conceptual foundations of evolutionary biology. He is also an important contributor to the biological theory of group selection.\n\nNancy Cartwright (1944-) \u2014 Philosopher of physics known for her claim that the laws of physics \u201clie\u201d \u2014 i.e., that the laws of physics only apply in highly idealized circumstances. She has also worked on causation, interpretations of probability and quantum mechanics, and the metaphysical foundations of modern science."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-006-9048-4", "page_content": "Mid-century philosophy of science was largely concerned with the analysis of explanation, confirmation, and physical theories. Against this backdrop of logic and physics-driven philosophy of science, Richard Levins\u2019 early contributions to philosophy of biology are notable for their attention to the complex issues facing practicing theoreticians. In a series of articles and book chapters, Levins, a population biologist, wrote some of the most important articles analyzing biological complexity and the theoretical strategies necessary to deal with it.\n\nLevins\u2019 work from this period investigated a number of questions that are central to the research of contemporary philosophers: What is the nature of complexity? How should we approach the need for idealization? What are scientific models and how do they differ from set-theoretic models? How do non-additive fitness structures affect our evolutionary explanations? Is precision intrinsicaly valuable, or should theorists be content with qualitative understanding in some cases? Can ecology and evolution be unified in to a single population biology? What would such a discipline look like? He addressed these questions in a series of papers (1962, 1966, 1968, 1970, 1974, 1975) which continue to reward careful reading, as their themes are extremely relevant to contemporary philosophy and science.\n\nPerhaps the most well-known of Levins\u2019 philosophical papers is \u201cThe Strategy of Model Building in Population Biology.\u201d (1966) \u201cThe Strategy\u201d has been very influential among population biologists and continues to be so to this day. Surprisingly, however, it received little attention from philosophers, with the notable exception of William Wimsatt (1981, 1987), whose work centered around themes similar to Levins\u2019. In the 1990s, philosophical attention was directed once again to Levins by Orzack and Sober\u2019s detailed, critical reexamination of \u201cThe Strategy.\u201d (Orzack and Sober 1993) Subsequently, there have been a number of discussions of Levins\u2019 work, as well as Orzack, Sober, and Wimsatt\u2019s analyses of it. (e.g., Odenbaugh 2003; Weisberg 2004, 2006; Levins 1993; Orzack 2005) Many of the contributors to these discussions met at the University of Pennsylvania in April, 2005 to discuss Levins\u2019 contributions to philosophy of science. The papers from this workshop, as well as several others, form the contents of this special issue of Biology and Philosophy honoring the philosophical work of Richard Levins.\n\nThis special issue contains papers concerned with the history and interpretation of Levins\u2019 philosophical work from the 1960s, the conceptual tools Levins developed to cope with complexity, and contemporary problems in philosophy of science that benefit from taking a Levinsonian perspective.\n\nJay Odenbaugh and Michael Weisberg discuss Levins\u2019 philosophical work from the 1960s, especially \u201cThe Strategy of Model Building.\u201d Odenbaugh\u2019s paper explains the historical background behind the writing of \u201cThe Strategy,\u201d a time of formal and informal collaboration between Levins, Robert MacArthur, Richard Lewontin, and E. O. Wilson, all of whom wished to construct a unified population biology. Weisberg\u2019s paper is a detailed analysis of \u201cThe Strategy\u201d itself, arguing that the paper should be seen as justifying the use of multiple models in population biology, itself a strategy of idealization.\n\nThe next pair of articles takes up Levins\u2019 work on the analysis of complex systems and tools we can use to cope with their complexity. Levins has long been an advocate of using qualitative models to describe highly complex phenomena. In such cases, Levins argues, high degrees of precision give one a false sense of understanding. The use of models specified only qualitatively, however, requires the use of qualitative methods of mathematical analysis. James Justus\u2019 contribution to this issue considers Levins\u2019 development of loop analysis, a tool for analyzing qualitative models. Justus\u2019 article explains Levins\u2019 method of loop analysis, analyses its formal properties, considers the limitations of the method, and discusses other qualitative methods that can be used along with it.\n\nWilliam Wimsatt considers another dimension of Levins\u2019 work on complex systems: Levins\u2019 analysis of aggregativity and the conditions under which aggregativity fails. In Levins\u2019 earliest work on complexity, he makes a distinction between aggregate, composed, and evolved systems. Wimsatt argues that this oft-overlooked distinction is crucial to keep in mind if one is interested in developing philosophical accounts of explanation and reduction. Wimsatt considers Levins\u2019 original distinction, but develops it further, applying it to questions about reduction in genetics, evolutionary ecology, as well as philosophical discussions about natural kinds and emergence.\n\nThe third group of papers connects themes from Levins\u2019 philosophical work to broader issues in philosophy of science. Rasmus Winther\u2019s paper discusses a theme from Levins and Richard Lewontin\u2019s work about the dangers of reifying idealized models and thus taking them too seriously. Winther analyses this problem of model reification, focusing on cases where theorists have conflated idealized scientific models with real-world systems. He considers Levins and Lewontin\u2019s \u201cdialectical\u201d perspective on this problem, and develops his own analysis of the issue.\n\nPeter Godfrey-Smith\u2019s article focuses on another aspect of \u201cThe Strategy,\u201d its emphasis on what Levins calls model building. Based on this analysis, Godfrey-Smith\u2019s article develops a new account of what he calls model-based science. He argues that model-based science differs from other kinds of theorizing because it involves the initial construction of a relatively simple, idealized model that is similar to this target in certain respects and degrees. This model is the initial locus of analysis and what one learns about the model can be, indirectly, applied to real world systems. Godfrey-Smith also considers the significance of model-based science for traditional philosophical questions about the structure and cognitive status of theories.\n\nThe last article in this issue is by Richard Levins himself. This article revisits some of the themes of \u201cThe Strategy,\u201d but focuses on the process of abstraction in model construction. Levins emphasizes the interest-relative nature of abstraction; no single procedure for abstraction will yield a universally applicable model. Illustrating the process with examples drawn from his own research, he directs our attention to the ways that abstractions can be enlightening or obscuring. A healthy theoretical enterprise, he argues, will explore systems of interests using a cluster of abstractions from different perspectives and scales."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-47000-9_8", "page_content": "The most basic feature of this relation is implicit in the wording of the question: \u201cinform each other.\u201d Any fruitful interdisciplinary connection should be mutual; a \u2018two-way street.\u2019 This point is not specific to systems biology and philosophy, of course, and one might dispute whether there needs to be a genuine interdisciplinary link between these two fields at all. However, in my view philosophy and systems biology have distinctive features that make the prospect of such a relation between them valuable and interesting.\n\nI will first say a bit about how I understand philosophy. (There are probably more views about this than there are philosophers.) In my view, philosophy is abstract reflection about general questions. If you keep asking questions about why things are the way they are, or how things should be, about any topic whatsoever, eventually you\u2019re going to be doing philosophy. So every field of knowledge has an intrinsic tie to philosophy; there is no sharp line dividing philosophy from other kinds of inquiry. In this sense philosophy is transdisciplinary, or perhaps anti-disciplinary. Asking and trying to answer basic questions is one of the ways we express our humanity. Creative art is another \u2013 or perhaps philosophy is a kind of creative art, consisting in the exercise of reasoning skills to the edge of our abilities. Art or no, philosophy so conceived is something anyone can do, if they\u2019re lucky enough to have their physical necessities provided for and some spare time. A few of us do philosophy for a living, but these professional efforts do not exhaust philosophy. They do, however, comprise a mode of philosophy that has the features of a discipline, within which philosophy of science is located. Philosophy of science is the sub-discipline of philosophy that focuses on philosophical questions arising in science: general issues about evidence, explanation, models, theories, etc. Exactly what relation philosophy of science should bear to scientific practice itself is a contentious issue, although my own preference (which I expect is shared by other philosophers contributing to this volume) is to engage actual science rather than idealized philosophical constructs.\n\nSystems biology involves new configurations among a number of scientific fields, including molecular biology, physics, computer science, and engineering. These changes raise questions about methods, models, norms, standards, education, and aims \u2013 all the components of what Kuhn termed a \u201cdisciplinary matrix\u201d (a disambiguation of his more famous term, \u201cparadigm\u201d). Insofar as systems biologists seek to answer these questions explicitly and reflectively, they are engaged in philosophy. Philosophers of science are interested in many of the same issues, though at a greater remove. Systems biologists approach questions about their disciplinary matrix from an unavoidably interested perspective, and their individual answers are likely to be those that make use of their own skill sets and benefit their own lines of research. The same is true for philosophers of science, of course, but our stake in particular answers for systems biology is lower. So the rise of systems biology creates a situation in which philosophers\u2019 and systems biologists\u2019 inquiries converge but don\u2019t precisely coincide. In the space between these two perspectives is opportunity for fruitful exchange that can enrich both discussions. Philosophers of science, as noted above, can gain a richer understanding of core topics like modeling, explanation, and laws by attending to systems biology. Systems biologists, in turn, can gain broader perspective on the value-laden debates about aims and progress in their field by attending to the work of philosophers of science. In the rest of this section, I discuss a few philosophical ideas that could be useful to systems biologists.\n\nMany systems biologists (and educated people generally) are familiar with Kuhn\u2019s accounts of paradigm and scientific revolution. What is less known outside philosophy of science circles is that Kuhn\u2019s ideas have been fruitfully modified and extended over the past 50 years. One of Kuhn\u2019s important insights concerns the role of shared values in scientific communities. Shared values, encompassing basic background assumptions about knowledge, understanding, evidence, and methods, allow members to refine and deepen their inquiries without the distraction of continuously arguing over fundamentals. But Kuhn saw a community\u2019s shared values as part of an indivisible package dominated by a theoretical world-picture: a paradigm providing a rigid monistic framework for doing \u201cnormal science\u201d (1962/1996). Paradigm change, according to Kuhn, involves a comprehensive shift from one scientific world-view to another, analogous to a Gestalt shift in perception. This account doesn\u2019t have much to offer systems biology, apart from identifying different values as a problem for integrating scientific communities. The idea that scientific fields can productively combine certain aspects of their practice to form a new integrative field of study has no place in Kuhn\u2019s account of scientific change. Recent philosophy of science, emphasizing the pluralistic, piecemeal aspect of scientific research, as well as the variety of scientific models and modeling practices, has much more to say. One way this philosophical work can inform systems biology is by making explicit the issues involved in coordinating different scientific communities, and so identifying ways to enhance their integration.\n\nA useful philosophical concept along these lines is the notion of a \u201cboundary object:\u201d an entity (abstract or concrete) that helps transcend communicative gaps across social worlds (Star and Griesemer 1989). Boundary objects perform this role by being open to diverse interpretations satisfying different sets of values, yet also retaining a recognizable common core. A model well-suited to play this role for systems biology is Waddington\u2019s landscape (1957): a simple diagram representing development as an inclined surface etched with branching valleys (developmental pathways) descending to multiple discrete termini (Fig. 8.1).\n\nFig. 8.1 From: The Strategy of the Genes, Waddington 1957, Taylor & Francis, p. 29 (Reproduced by permission of Taylor & Francis Books UK) Full size image\n\nWaddington\u2019s landscape can represent results of both mathematical modeling and experimental manipulation of cell development (Fagan 2012). One prominent mathematical modeling approach in systems biology begins with a network diagram representing molecular interactions thought to underlie and control cell development. Translated into a system of equations, the model is studied to reveal the network\u2019s dynamical behavior, which can be represented as an arrangement of vectors and attractors. Adding a stability dimension to this state space yields a landscape (rendered in 3d for simple networks or via principle components analysis). In this way, systems modelers can derive a landscape \u2018from the ground up.\u2019 The experimental approach, in contrast, begins with many different manipulations of cell development, which reveal causal connections between molecular components and cell phenotypes and behaviors. Results of many such experiments can be grouped together as distinct pathways on a landscape, \u2018annotated\u2019 to correlate cells\u2019 developmental potential with their morphological and molecular features. The landscape model is thus a point of contact between the two approaches, and so can provide a shared focus for collaborative effort in understanding cell development. Waddington\u2019s landscape is not unique in this regard, but exemplifies the kind of simple model that could help integrate mathematical modeling and experimental methodologies in systems approaches to a variety of biological phenomena.\n\nAnother way philosophy can help systems biology achieve its integrative goals is by diagnosing failures and problems. For example, although many experimental biologists are interested in high-throughput data and regulatory motifs, they ignore some theoretical proposals by systems biologists. One such case is a proposed definition of stem cells in terms of dynamical systems models that reproduce characteristic stem cell behaviors in silico (Huang 2011; Furusawa and Kaneko 2012). Experimental stem cell biologists have consistently ignored these proposals, to the modelers\u2019 increasing frustration. This failure to communicate, in my view, is at least partly due to the different standards of explanation endorsed by the experimentalists and modelers in this case (Green et al. 2015; Fagan 2016). Philosophers of science have proposed a number of different accounts of explanation, which help to clarify the situation. The dynamical systems modelers in this case are committed to something like the traditional covering-law account, which states that a phenomenon of interest is explained by deriving a description of its occurrence from a general law (in this case, principles of dynamical systems theory) and initial conditions. In contrast, experimental stem cell biologists aim at mechanistic explanations, which describe how some overall system (the stem cell) works in terms of its interacting parts (DNA, protein, and other molecules). Philosophical accounts of covering-law and mechanistic explanation, respectively, can identify points of dispute that remain implicit in scientific debates \u2013 or, as in this case, prevent debate from even beginning. Value-laden commitments to explanation via derivation from general principles, or via accurate depiction of the details of causal relations, can hamper efforts at integration, if the communities involved do not recognize their differences. Philosophers of science are well-positioned to make these issues explicit and indicate positive solutions. (I return to this issue in the response to Question 5)."}, {"url": "https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/pie/2021-v28-n1-pie06203/1079435ar/", "page_content": "The essays collected in The Importance of Philosophy in Teacher Education: Mapping the Decline and Its Consequences, edited by Andrew D. Colgan & Bruce Maxwell, tell the story of a discipline\u2019s fall from prominence in teacher education and some ways this trajectory might be meliorated or reversed. In the mid-nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries, philosophical study was \u201cwidely recognized as essential to the craft of teaching\u201d (Colgan & Maxwell, 2020, p. 1). During this period, nearly all pre-service teachers were required to take a course in the philosophy of education. Compare this today with Canada, the only country for which there is data, where less than 10% of educator preparation programs require a course in philosophical thought (p. 5), and the decline is obvious.\n\nThe anti-philosophical bent in teacher preparation programs, of course, is not anomalous. As Alasdair MacIntyre (2007), Philip Kitcher (2012), and others have noted, we live in an age that is generally skeptical of philosophical inquiry. The Importance of Philosophy in Teacher Education does not spend much time reflecting on this broader context. For Kitcher and MacIntyre, at least, some of the blame for our present age\u2019s philosophical skepticism falls at the feet of philosophers. Kitcher laments a drift in academic philosophy from a Deweyan focus on the \u201cstudy of the good life\u201d and seeking \u201cto understand how opportunities for living well can be promoted by social institutions\u201d (2012, p. 345) towards \u201carcane puzzles\u201d (p. 346) of metaphysics and epistemology. MacIntyre\u2019s worries point to a deeper anxiety: that seemingly unavoidable methodological tendencies in ethics and political philosophy \u2013 where the problems of life are defined and rooted \u2013 make it unlikely that philosophers are likely to make progress on these problems.\n\nSpecifically, MacIntyre (2007) observes that in contemporary ethics and political philosophy it is standard to appeal to conflicting starting points \u2013 basic judgments, perceptions, or intuitions \u2013 to establish what purport to be \u201cnormative\u201d ethical and political conclusions. But problematically, the inferences drawn from these disparate starting points leave us with conflicting conclusions \u2013 all purporting to be \u201cnormative.\u201d Philosophical inquiry into \u201cnormative\u201d ethical issues can thus appear to boil down to a purely preferential choice between internally coherent but conflicting views. MacIntyre refers to the non-cognitive ethic we are left with amidst such fragmentation as \u201cemotivist\u201d (p. 8). MacIntyre\u2019s insight, if well founded, bears directly on the predicament of the philosophy of education. The empirical study of preferences and their satisfaction is a canonical domain of social scientific inquiry. So, if MacIntyre is correct, then it should be no surprise that philosophy in general and philosophy of education in particular have witnessed a decline not felt in the same way by the social (and natural) sciences. The latter but not the former, one might think, are more conducive to solving the problems of life.\n\nThe chapters in Colgan and Maxwell\u2019s edited volume \u2013 divided into three sections \u2013 largely abstain from such meta-philosophical questions and their practical consequences. Nevertheless, the chapters shed light on the decline in prominence of the philosophy of education, what has been lost, and how the field is already rethinking and re-establishing its place in the unique context of teacher education. A common theme that emerges across the volume\u2019s sections is a shift of the sort Kitcher recommends towards the concrete problems of life and theorizing on terrain closer to that studied by social scientists. This, of course, is one response to problems in the epistemology of philosophy noted by MacIntyre: if the most philosophers can hope to do is reframe possibilities for interpreting and practically satisfying preferences, then focusing one\u2019s work on interpreting what people descriptively think, desire, and do allows the philosopher of education to be made useful to at least some public or other\u2019s interests. Philosophy, in this picture, gives up the role of \u201cqueen of the sciences\u201d and is instrumentalized in the service of the public\u2019s present problems.\n\nThe first section of the volume, \u201cDiagnosis and Prognosis,\u201d lays out some of the features of philosophy of education\u2019s current predicament in educator preparation programs that motivate this empirically oriented shift. In the first chapter, Robin Barrow argues that while claims to do \u201cphilosophical work\u201d have proliferated in faculties of education, little of this work would be recognized as such by analytic philosophers. The \u201c4Cs\u201d that characterize analytic philosophy \u2013 an argument\u2019s being \u201cclear, coherent, complete, and compatible\u201d (Colgan & Maxwell, 2020, p. 19) \u2013 are, in Barrow\u2019s view, neglected, leaving much educational debate and practice to proceed without sufficient analytic rigor.\n\nThe volume\u2019s second chapter, by David Waddington, traces a different decline, this time not in current analytic philosophical work in education, but in John Dewey\u2019s status as an educational scholar. Waddington, a Dewey scholar, suspects that Dewey\u2019s status is unlikely to persist into the twenty-first century. The reason, according to Waddington, is Dewey\u2019s ethical, political, and epistemic modernism, which involves a commitment to a form of \u201cliberation through science\u201d (p. 34) that seeks to control nature for the sake of satisfying human desires. Dewey\u2019s modernism, according to Waddington, entails an unwarranted ethical assimilation and integration of other cultures \u2013 most notably those of Indigenous peoples \u2013 that see nature as bearing inherent worth (p. 37). By Waddington\u2019s lights, this modernist tendency makes Dewey less well suited to our present moment, in which the modern liberation of human desires through science has led to a near total collapse of natural life and in which many inside and outside educator preparation programs are rightly worried about colonialism. An opportunity is missed in Waddington\u2019s insightful essay to signal awareness of Indigenous ethical and political thought as an alternative to Dewey\u2019s, to post-Marxist critical theorists, and to European postmoderns\u2019 views (e.g., Borrows, 2016; Kruse, Tanchuk, & Hamilton, 2019; North, 2021; Simpson, 2017). Nevertheless, Waddington, like Kitcher, and Dewey himself, can be read as calling philosophers to attend to the most pressing public problems of our day. Ironically, if Waddington is correct, the problems of the public now cut against Dewey and his pragmatic, problem-focused form of scientific modernism.\n\nThe third chapter, by Matthew J. Hayden, rounds out the first section, but with a more favourable outlook on the Enlightenment project, as it is reinvigorated by J\u00fcrgen Habermas. For Hayden, the neoliberal enemies of philosophical thought are largely to be found outside the walls of faculties of education (although technocrats within educator preparation programs are also a concern). The enemies within and without, according to Hayden, have failed to attend adequately to the critical \u201cemancipatory interests\u201d (Colgan & Maxwell, 2020, p. 51) of students. In Hayden\u2019s view, Habermas rigorously articulates these interests. Read in dialogue with Waddington\u2019s piece lamenting the Deweyan attempt to liberate humanity through scientific and communicative exchange, Hayden\u2019s chapter calls us in the opposite direction: towards the discursive and political conditions for rational emancipation, as they are spelled out by Habermas.\n\nThis dissensus between Waddington and Hayden, both well-trained philosophers of education, exemplifies MacIntyre\u2019s metanormative anxiety that philosophers (including philosophers of education) lack a genuine basis upon which to adjudicate the normative dimensions of the problems of life. Where one despairs of answering questions such as \u201cIs a modernist ethic (of some form or other) true?,\u201d it can be tempting to reduce the scope of analysis and turn towards more concrete concerns. The bulk of rest of the volume takes this line as the most promising pathway forward for philosophers of education.\n\nIn the middle section of the volume, \u201cPhilosophy and Teacher Development,\u201d all four chapters recommend, in different ways, a tighter tie to empirical problems of educational practice. The Philosophy for Teachers (P4T) movement described by Leonard Waks in the fourth chapter and by Janet Orchard & Carrie Winstanley in the fifth, the problem-based approach to philosophy of education championed by Dianne Gereluk in the sixth chapter, and Michael R. Matthews\u2019 focus on concrete problems in science education in the seventh, all evince a focus on building teachers\u2019 philosophical literacy within the context of the present practice of teaching.\n\nThis trend continues in the third section of the volume, \u201cHistorical Perspectives.\u201d In the eighth chapter, Douglas Yacek and Bruce Kimball argue for a return to an approach to teacher education based in the liberal arts. Yet, rather than unseating the current marginalization of philosophy in schools of education, Yacek and Kimball claim that philosophers more realistically might seek \u201cto widen our understanding of what it means to embody a philosophical spirit and to teach for liberal sensibility\u201d (p. 160) within the constraints of existing courses. In chapter 9, Lee S. Duemer similarly argues for a vision of educational foundations that allows policy and practice to be placed in a broader \u201cepistemological and theoretical framework\u201d (p. 173) that illuminates the human condition. By contrast, the final chapter of the volume, by David T. Hansen and Megan J. Laverty, recounts how the Philosophy and Education program at Teachers College, Columbia University has largely resisted the trend towards problem-based inductive approaches to the philosophy of education in favour of a historical curriculum focused on the \u201cGreat Books.\u201d Yet, even at Teachers College, where admissions are highly selective and placement rates are strong, Hansen and Laverty report that the program faculty intend to reflect on ways to deepen the curriculum\u2019s connection to the empirical realities of teacher education in response to graduate feedback (p. 195).\n\nThis wealth of perspectives on how to reinvigorate the field through deeper engagement with the problems of life is a strength of the volume. Such a shift towards problems that are both empirical and philosophical, in my view, aptly characterizes some of the most vibrant and thoughtful work in the philosophy of education today. Extending these insights, one might look to recent work that not only starts in worldly problems, but that features philosophers of education themselves engaging in empirical data collection and analysis as part of their research agendas. In recent books like Jen Morton\u2019s Moving Up Without Losing Your Way, qualitative data collected by Morton herself figures prominently in the context in which theoretical considerations are unpacked. In a similar spirit, Lauren Bialystok, et al. (2019) have conducted empirical research on the teaching of philosophy in schools, Doris Santoro (2018) has empirically researched the way the demoralization of teaching has affected teacher retention, and David Hansen (2021) draws on his own field work to articulate his vision of the ethics of teaching."}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/philosophy-of-science/article/karl-poppers-philosophy-of-biology/DCA49881E3105672ACC053A6C9FEF1C0", "page_content": "Crossref Citations\n\nThis article has been cited by the following publications.

Initially, I saw these as separate fields: I was writing about theories of morality in one class and memorizing the Krebs cycle in another. It was only after picking up first-hand research experience while working on my final-year biology thesis at New York University Abu Dhabi that I began to understand how philosophy can make me a better scientist. As I progress through the early stages of my PhD, I can see how impactful reading and studying philosophy have been in shaping my career so far, and how much they will continue to influence me in my future work.\n\nPhilosophy has expanded my critical and creative thinking. Philosophical arguments often lead to imaginative edge cases and a dive into hypotheticals, which I frequently find creatively stimulating. For my philosophy thesis, for example, I wrote about the metaphysics of identity, the Ship of Theseus (a thought experiment that questions whether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object), general relativity and some of the philosophical implications of time travel.\n\nThinking creatively while maintaining a critical and methodical approach carried over into my research. For example, studying instrumentalism \u2014 the philosophical idea that science does not uncover fundamental truths about the world, but merely provides us with tools to help us navigate it \u2014 helped me to adopt a more fluid approach to research and look for useful tools wherever I could find them. One thing I\u2019ve done is to repurpose \u2018contamination\u2019 in an organism\u2019s sequencing data so that I could look for viruses in its blood.\n\nKeeping two journals has made me a better scientist\n\nI also learnt logic. Most of us have a foundational understanding in this area \u2014 but, as a philosophy student, I was required to take a structured course in logic. At the start, it was like taking a class in brain-teaser puzzles: A\u2228B is true if both A and B are true; A\u2227B is true if either A or B is true.\n\nBut my study of formal logic turned out to be very helpful in my transition from a wet-lab undergraduate scientist to a computational scientist on my master\u2019s programme as I learnt coding languages, which involve elements such as logical operators and if-then reasoning. It also helped me to understand inference, the process of arriving at conclusions from evidence and reasoning. None of my science classes has formally taught the difference between induction (these frogs are all from this pond and they are all green: therefore all of the frogs in the pond are green) and deduction (all frogs in this pond are green and this frog is from this pond: therefore this frog is green), nor have any of them taught how to methodically evaluate arguments. Reading, studying and evaluating philosophical arguments as premises and conclusions has shaped my ability to scrutinize evidence and conclusions in research reports.\n\nPhilosophical arguments have often led Rasha Shraim to explore creatively stimulating edge cases, she says.Credit: Devin Quinn\n\nBeyond methods and data, philosophy pushed me to inwardly and outwardly examine the values and ethics behind science. Researchers are human, and our subjectivity and values inevitably influence our work. We might discuss glaring historical examples of unethical experiments or rogue scientists, such as He Jiankui and the gene-edited babies. But we rarely teach and discuss how everyday choices of everyday scientists can have serious ethical impacts: choices of colours on published figures; genotyping only populations of European descent; researching vulnerable groups without offering protection or help; or even the questions that we choose to pursue. Studying philosophy taught me to take both grand and smaller choices seriously.\n\nCollection: the PhD\n\nThrough philosophy, big questions grew familiar and it became easier to ask them in everyday life. During my PhD programme, I took a class on Mendelian randomization (a genetics research method that aims to identify modifiable risk factors for diseases), and we discussed how socioeconomic factors need to be accounted for statistically. I wanted to push this discussion past methodology, so I asked: if socioeconomic factors are significant predictors of health outcomes, why not divert medical research funding directly to food programmes, or schools, or income support, to fix medical problems before they occur?\n\nIn thinking through such challenges, I form a clearer idea of my motivation and goals in genetic health research, and of which opportunities I should pursue. Rather than being driven only by scientific curiosity, I\u2019ve found my motivation stemming from a desire to influence the world in a positive way.\n\nIf it can help us to think critically about science and our goals, and to recognize that scientific progress is rooted in creative philosophical enquiry, and if it can prompt us to ask important questions, then I think we could all benefit from reading more philosophy.\n\nPhilosophy resources for scientists\n\nLogic and inference. Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, offers an introductory online course in logic and critical thinking that covers the basics of argumentation, including induction and deduction. These concepts are useful in evaluating other people\u2019s reasoning, and in building your own sound arguments. For more in-depth material on formal logic and its semantics, try this free textbook: An Introduction to Formal Logic, by P. D. Magnus (Fecundity, 2012); or Introduction to Logic, a free online course designed to accompany a book of the same name by Paul Herrick (Oxford Univ. Press, 2012).\n\nPhilosophy of science. Theory and Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science, by Peter Godfrey-Smith (Univ. Chicago Press, 2003), provides an introduction to the subject aimed at general readers. It covers key thinkers in the area, including Thomas Kuhn, who wrote The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, and Karl Popper, who wrote The Logic of Scientific Discovery. Other titles in the field include The Fate of Knowledge by Helen Longino (Princeton Univ. Press, 2001), and Exceeding Our Grasp: Science, History, and the Problem of Unconceived Alternatives by Kyle Stanford (Oxford Univ. Press, 2006).\n\nEthics. For a general introduction to the field of ethics, read Plato\u2019s The Republic or Aristotle\u2019s Ethics, or try The Metaphysics of Morals by Immanuel Kant or Utilitarianism by John Stuart Mill. These provide a historical perspective and broad frameworks of ethics and morality. Applied Ethics by Peter Singer (Oxford Univ. Press, 1986) aims to ground theory in a wide range of practical situations. Although it starts out intuitively, ethics quickly becomes complex; the best option is to seek out specialized material (for example, I am taking a workshop on ethical considerations in biomedical \u2018big data\u2019).\n\nGeneral notes. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is a great and reliable online resource for exploring philosophical terms and concepts, and has entries on the philosophy of particular scientific subfields, such as the philosophy of cell biology. My background, and therefore my suggestions, are mainly rooted in the Western tradition, but I aim to continue diversifying my education."}]}
