{"In 1994, Bill Tobin joined the Indianapolis Colts as Vice President of Player Personnel.": [{"url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1994-01-08-9401080108-story.html", "page_content": "Bill Tobin joined the Indianapolis Colts as vice president and director of football operations Friday in a surprise move that changes the role of General Manager Jim Irsay.\n\nTobin, former vice president of player personnel with the Bears, was hired by Colts owner Robert Irsay, who told his son and Tobin, \"Go run the club.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I am what it says,\" Tobin said. \"I'm responsible for coaches, players, the draft, trainers, equipment guys. I will consult and work closely with Jim and get the approval of Mr. Irsay. He wants my football experience and success.\"\n\nSo will Tobin trade quarterback Jeff George to the Bears for Jim Harbaugh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What else are the Bears going to throw in?\" Tobin asked with a laugh.\n\nTobin was never an avid backer of George, first player selected in the 1990 draft, so George's future in Indianapolis is in question. George skipped most of training camp in a dispute he never publicly clarified. He was said to be fed up with what he perceived as unfair criticism in his hometown.\n\nTobin said he was going to review personnel with coach Ted Marchibroda before he talks about anyone, including George.\n\nSince the Colts finished 28th in the league in defense, Tobin's brother Vince could soon rekindle the family reunion they had with the Bears from 1986-92, when the Bears' defense finished 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 25th, 6th, 4th and 17th.\n\n\"We've got some changes to make,\" Bill Tobin admitted when asked about Vince.\n\nThe Colts' defensive coordinator is former Northwestern coach Rick Venturi.\n\nThe Tobin hiring was one of two shakeups in the NFL Friday. The New York Jets fired coach Bruce Coslet and promoted defensive coordinator Pete Carroll after Coslet refused to hire an offensive coordinator. Coslet spent four years without a winning season. After making the playoffs in 1991 as an 8-8 wild card, the Jets suffered through 4-12 and 8-8 seasons.\n\nTobin praised former Bears General Manager Jim Finks as his role model in structuring a team. He compared his situation in Indianapolis to the 1974 hiring of Finks by the Bears, who were a father-son operation. In that case, however, Finks was hired by son Mugs Halas, not father George. Mugs gave up his authority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJim Irsay will keep his title as vice president and general manager. Tobin said Jim Irsay, assistant GM Bob Terpenning and general counsel Michael Chernoff would remain responsible for signing players and fitting them under the salary cap.\n\nThe Colts had the third-highest payroll in the league last season, according to NFL Players Association figures. At $40.2 million, they are more than $6 million over next year's projected cap of $34 million.\n\n\"I'm here to tell them who to spend the money on,\" Tobin said. \"That's my area of expertise.\"\n\nSince the Colts finished fifth in the AFC East, they will avoid a game against the Bears next season and play a fifth-place schedule instead. The Colts have the second pick in the April 24 draft. The Bears never picked that high during Tobin's 18 years in Chicago."}, {"url": "https://www.colts.com/news/colts-season-in-review-1994-10256717", "page_content": "\"My philosophy is to control the ball, and I believe you win with defense,\" he said. \"When you go back to the great teams, the ones that sustained for any length of time, it was because of their defenses. I think you have to have a tough, aggressive, physical team.\"\n\nTobin's years with the Bears included the 15-1 team in 1985 that went on to win the Super Bowl, establishing its credentials as one of the most dominant squads in league history. In Tobin's final nine years in Chicago, the Bears reached the playoffs seven times. In his tenure, all 20 of his draft picks were productive players with nine earning Pro Bowl nominations.\n\nTobin immediately set about re-shaping the Colts.\n\nIn March, he traded Jeff George to Atlanta. The homegrown quarterback had started 49 games the previous four seasons since being drafted first overall in 1990, but held out for more than a month heading into 1993, disrupting the team and contributing to a 4-12 season.\n\n\"I think this is best for all concerned,\" said Tobin. \"It's best for the Colts, and it's best for Jeff George. And I think it's best for the Falcons that he go there.\"\n\nSoon thereafter he signed Jim Harbaugh away from the Bears to compete for the starting quarterback job.\n\n\"Jim is a guy who has been exposed to playoff situations, championship situations, winning situations,\" Tobin said. \"He's a leader, he's a winner and he's in the prime of his career.\"\n\nTobin also signed prominent free agents including defensive end Tony Bennett, safety David Tate and wide receiver Floyd Turner.\n\nIn April, Tobin engineered a memorable draft that produced a future Hall of Fame running back in second overall pick Marshall Faulk. Seven of the eight picks finished the season on the roster, including linebacker Trev Alberts, offensive linemen Eric Mahlum and Jason Mathews, tight end Bradford Banta and running back Lamont Warren.\n\nThe draft also produced a moment that would forever mark Tobin's years with the Colts. When he opted to take Nebraska linebacker Alberts with the fifth pick rather than quarterback Trent Dilfer, Tobin was roundly criticized by ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. Tobin defended the choice, and the exchange remains a memorable draft moment.\n\nWith head coach Ted Marchibroda's steady hand, a roster infused with young talent and Tobin's leadership from the top, the Colts laid the foundation for a remarkable future.\n\nRECAPPING THE 1994 SEASON\n\nMost memorable games: Considering Buffalo entered the season with four consecutive Super Bowl appearances, the Colts were not the only team to struggle with the Bills, but their difficulties had become acute. But they exorcised that demon by sweeping the Bills for the first time since 1980, playing a major role in ending the playoff run of their AFC East rivals. The biggest verdict came on October 16 in Buffalo, where the Colts had been outscored, 193-55, in their previous six trips. But Harbaugh completed 18-of-22 passes and directed two long touchdown drives as Indianapolis pulled a 27-17 shocker. Harbaugh's completion percentage (.818) was the second-highest in team history at the time. He guided a 17-play, 98-yard drive in the second quarter, completing all seven of his attempts including the capper, a 6-yard toss to Floyd Turner. The march consumed 10:25. In the third quarter he guided a 15-play, 79-yard drive capped by a 10-yard toss to Kerry Cash. That drive consumed 8:27. Sean Dawkins had six receptions for 105 yards. In the final game of the season, the Colts completed the sweep, 10-9, in the RCA Dome when Buffalo kicker Steve Christie \u2013 who had missed two field goal attempts all season to that point \u2013 missed two, including a 46-yarder that bounced off the upright as time expired. The victory gave the Colts a .500 season (8-8).\n\n* *\n\nBest seasonal performance: Faulk was a sensation right away, filling his trophy case with a prolific rookie season. He rushed for 1,282 yards (third-most in club history) and 11 touchdowns. He caught 52 passes for 522 yards and another score. His 1,804 total yards ranked second in club history and accounted for 40.9 percent of the team's output. He was the first player in NFL history to be named both the Offensive Rookie of the Year and Pro Bowl MVP, rushing for a record 180 yards in the game, while posting the first 1,000-yard season ever for a Colts rookie. He showed his Hall of Fame talent in the opening game, rushing for 143 yards and three touchdowns in a 45-21 victory over Houston, the first of his four 100-yard rushing games. He also topped 100 against Tampa Bay (104), the Jets (110) and Seattle (129). Faulk had 127 yards receiving against Washington, including an 85-yard touchdown.\n\n* *\n\nOther individual highlights: Harbaugh started nine games and posted a quarterback rating of 85.8, setting a club record by connecting on 61.9 percent of his passes. \u2026 Linebacker Jeff Herrod led the team in tackles for the fifth time in six seasons with a career-high 200 (94 solo). \u2026 Bennett produced nine sacks and forced two fumbles. \u2026 Ray Buchanan started the season at free safety but shifted to left cornerback for the final six games and totaled eight interceptions, returning three for touchdowns and totaling 221 return yards, the second-best seasonal mark in team history. \u2026 Dawkins led the team in receiving yards (742) while Turner tied Faulk for the lead in receptions (52). Dawkins, Turner and Faulk produced then only the fourth seasonal trio of 50 seasonal receivers in Colts history. \u2026 Center Kirk Lowdermilk and tackle Will Wolford anchored an offensive line that allowed just 28 sacks while paving the way for the number four rushing offense in the NFL.\n\nTurning point: The Colts carried a 2-4 record into their October 16 matchup in Buffalo, which had been a difficult venue for the Indianapolis team. But with the Bills' defense focused on Faulk, limiting the dynamic rookie to a modest 64 yards on 26 attempts, Harbaugh took over and directed the 27-17 victory gave the revamped Indianapolis franchise a huge boost of confidence. It was the club's first non-strike win in Buffalo since 1980. The Colts finished with six wins in their final 10 games. Buffalo, on the other hand, was 4-2 entering that game and wound up losing seven of its final 10. \"It's a great victory for us because it puts us right back in the thick of things,\" said Marchibroda. \"Like I've said all year, we haven't played our best football. This was our best game, and it came at the right time.\""}, {"url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1994-01-13-9401130311-story.html", "page_content": "The brothers Tobin were reunited again Wednesday when Vince Tobin was hired as defensive coordinator of the Indianapolis Colts five days after Bill Tobin was named the club's director of football operations.\n\nVince, former Bears defensive coordinator, takes over the 28th-ranked defense in the league from Rick Venturi, fired Monday along with three members of the defensive staff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Up.

The Colts owned the No. 2 overall pick and acquired the No. 7 overall pick after trading starting quarterback Jeff George to the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nWith George out of the picture and only Jim Harbaugh left on the roster, Kiper believed the Colts should draft a quarterback, either Heath Shuler or Trent Dilfer.\n\nTobin had other plans. He selected future Hall of Famer Marshall Faulk with the team's first first-round pick. Kiper offered light criticism of the selection, saying the Colts needed to address their hole at quarterback.\n\nThree picks later, with Shuler off the board, Indianapolis traded up to the No. 5 pick. Everyone thought Indy was targeting Dilfer. Instead the Colts selected Nebraska linebacker Trev Alberts with the pick, eliciting a furious response from Kiper.\n\n\"I think it was a typical Colts move,\" Kiper said to host Chris Berman. \"The Colts needed a quarterback. To pass up a Trent Dilfer when all you have is Jim Harbaugh \u2014 give me a break. That's why the Colts are picking second every year in the draft and not battling for the Super Bowl like other clubs in the National Football League.\"\n\nWhen ESPN reporter Chris Mortensen asked Tobin for his response to criticism during a post-draft interview, the Colts GM came ready to fire back.\n\n\"Who in the hell is Mel Kiper anyway?\" asks Tobin. \"Here's a guy that criticizes everybody, whoever they take. He's got the answers to who you should take and who you shouldn't take. And my knowledge of him: he's never ever put on a jock strap, he's never been a coach, he's never been a scout, he's been an administrator and all of a sudden he's an expert.\"\n\nThe whole time Tobin is ranting, Kiper is off screen, listening to Tobin insult him.\n\n\"We don't have to take anyone Mel Kiper says we have to take,\" Tobin continues. \"Mel Kiper has no more credentials to do what he's doing than my neighbor, and my neighbor's a postman, and he doesn't even have season tickets to the NFL.\"\n\nTobin seemed genuinely upset by Kiper's criticism, but the ESPN executives loved the attention the rant brought to the draft.\n\nTo his credit, Tobin's selection of Faulk was a productive one. Faulk played five seasons in the Indy before being traded to the St. Louis Rams for picks that became linebacker Mike Peterson and defensive end Brad Scioli.\n\nPassing on Dilfer for Alberts was not a smart decision. Alberts notched just one sack in three years with Indy before retiring due to injury.\n\nDilfer went one pick later to the Tampa Buccaneers. He had an up-and-down career with the before winning a Super Bowl with the Baltimore Ravens in 2000.\n\nTobin was fired by the Colts in 1997 after a 3-13 season.\n\nKiper is in his 35th season with ESPN.\n\nFollow IndyStar sports producer Akeem Glaspie on Twitter at @THEAkeemGlaspie."}, {"url": "https://mutigers.com/honors/hall-of-fame/bill-tobin/91", "page_content": "Thanks for visiting !\n\nThe use of software that blocks ads hinders our ability to serve you the content you came here to enjoy.\n\nWe ask that you consider turning off your ad blocker so we can deliver you the best experience possible while you are here.\n\nThank you for your support!"}, {"url": "https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/nfl/colts/2014/03/17/timeline-jim-irasy-through-the-years/6522179/", "page_content": "Star report\n\nJim Irsay through the years:\n\nJune 13, 1959: Born in Lincolnwood, Ill.\n\n1972: Jim's father, Robert Irsay, buys the Los Angeles Rams for $16 million, then trades them for the Baltimore Colts and $3 million in cash.\n\n1977: Jim graduates from Loyola Academy in Wilmette, Ill.\n\nAug. 2, 1980: Marries high school sweetheart Meg Coyle.\n\n1982: Graduates from Southern Methodist University with broadcast journalism degree; joins the Colts, working in the ticket office and public relations.\n\nMarch 28, 1984: Colts move to Indianapolis in the middle of the night.\n\nApril 26, 1984: Bob Irsay names Jim general manager.\n\nOct. 31, 1987: Jim engineers a trade for star running back Eric Dickerson, one of the franchise's most significant moves ever.

It was the funnest year of playing football of my life.\u201d\n\nJim Harbaugh remembers it like it was yesterday.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was amazing,\u201d he says. \u201cThroughout the course of the season for all of us, we became a real team.\u201d\n\nThat team was the 1995 Indianapolis Colts. The franchise was entering its 12th season in Indianapolis after relocating from Baltimore, and the direction in which it was headed was uncertain.\n\nThe Colts, beginning their fourth year under coach Ted Marchibroda, were coming off an 8-8 season, preceded by a 4-12 campaign. The franchise\u2019s only playoff appearance since moving to Indianapolis had been in the strike-shortened 1987 season and ended with a loss to the Cleveland Browns in the first round.\n\nBut 1995 would be a special year for the Colts and the city of Indianapolis, a season filled with stirring comebacks and an improbable playoff run that would include one of the greatest AFC Championship games.\n\nPeyton Manning, deservedly, gets much of the credit for establishing football in Indianapolis. But the city's passion for football began in 1995.\n\n\u201cI think we were the jump-start to an organization headed in the right direction,\u201d says Zack Crockett, then a rookie fullback. \u201cAnd then from all the negative things we heard about the team leaving Baltimore and all that, this was something to wash all that away and have a fresh beginning.\u201d\n\nTraining camp\n\nThe Colts had several questions to answer entering training camp in August 1995, not the least of which was who would be the starting quarterback.\n\nIndianapolis had traded a future first-round draft pick to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for Craig Erickson that offseason, casting doubt on whether the 31-year-old Harbaugh \u2013 who had started nine games for the Colts in 1994 \u2013 would be the No. 1 quarterback again. Despite his 61.9 percent completion rate and 85.8 passer rating in \u201994, Indianapolis was 4-5 with Harbaugh starting.\n\nHarbaugh had come to the Colts after seven seasons with the Bears, the team that drafted him in the first round (26th overall) out of Michigan in 1987 while Bill Tobin \u2013 Colts general manager in 1995 \u2013 was director of player personnel for Chicago. Harbaugh led Chicago to a division title and a wild-card berth before a disastrous \u201992 season (5-11) and mediocre \u201993 campaign (7-9) led Chicago to waive him.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see that anymore,\" Crockett said of having a high-quality backup quarterback. \"To watch that in training camp, those two guys compete, it was unreal.\u201d\n\nWithout a clear-cut leader on offense and with a team that had vacillated between mediocrity and moderate success, the Colts were undefined as a unit.\n\nThey would find that identity, in part, behind an offense that was undergoing a schematic transformation under new offensive coordinator Lindy Infante.\n\n\u201c(Infante) was just enhancing your football IQ,\" receiver Aaron Bailey says. \"The receivers were responsible for making the correct read with the quarterback. We had to know the defensive front, just everything. We had to know different kinds of routes depending on what kind of blitz they came at us with; one route could morph into two other routes. It was kind of cool in a way.\u201d\n\nWhen the Colts broke camp, Marchibroda had settled on Erickson as the starting quarterback. But Marchibroda\u2019s decision would soon be tested.\n\nEarly-season momentum\n\nThe Colts lost their season opener to the Bengals in the RCA Dome, 24-21 in overtime. Erickson was 19-of-31 for 196 yards, a touchdown and three interceptions. He was replaced in the fourth quarter by Harbaugh, who led a game-tying drive to force overtime.\n\nIn Week 2, Erickson was again the starter. But with Indianapolis down to the Jets 24-3 in the third quarter, Marchibroda again turned to Harbaugh. After the Colts recovered a fumble for a touchdown, Harbaugh tossed two touchdown passes to bring Indianapolis all the way back, forcing another overtime. Harbaugh led a game-winning drive that ended in a Mike Cofer 52-yard field goal for a 27-24 win.\n\nMarchibroda made Harbaugh the starting quarterback.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s another life lesson there,\u201d Harbaugh says. \u201cIt\u2019s better to be prepared and your opportunity does not come than to not be prepared and have your opportunity come.\u201d\n\nThe Colts lost in Week 3 at Buffalo i20-14 and after a bye week beat the Rams at home 21-18. Then came a game those Colts squad remember as a key marker in their development as a team capable of big things.\n\n\u201cYeah, that was Oct. 8, 1995,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cI remember because that was my first NFL touchdown.\u201d\n\nTrailing the Dolphins 24-3 at halftime in Miami, Harbaugh worked his comeback magic again, throwing three touchdown passes \u2013 the final one a 21-yard strike to Bailey \u2013 to pull Indianapolis even late in the fourth quarter. In overtime again, Harbaugh led a 57-yard drive that ended in a 27-yard Cary Blanchard field goal.\n\n\u201cCertainly the Miami game,\u201d Harbaugh says when thinking back on the key moments of that season. \u201cWe were gaining confidence as players in ourselves and everybody\u2019s abilities. Week after week it\u2019s a new guy that\u2019s shining and winning us the game.\u201d\n\nThat day at Joe Robbie Stadium, Harbaugh heard himself called \u201cCaptain Comeback,\u201d a nickname previously given to Hall of Fame quarterback Roger Staubach.\n\n\u201cI liked it,\u201d he says with a chuckle. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you? Wouldn\u2019t anybody? Who wouldn\u2019t?\u201d\n\nThe Miami win was followed by a stunning 18-17 victory over the defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers in Indianapolis.\n\n\u201cA lot of people use (the word) \u2018culture,\u2019 but the attitude, everybody was team-first,\u201d says Harbaugh. \u201cFrom the front office, together with the coaches, together with the ownership, together with the players, the equipment staff, the training staff, I mean it felt like we were family.\u201d\n\nThe 64-year-old Marchibroda was in his fourth decade of coaching in the NFL, and he knew how to get the most out of his players.\n\n\u201cCoach Marchibroda was like a calming effect over the team,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cHe was always cool. He was a great motivator, a great listener, a great teacher.\u201d\n\nInfante\u2019s offensive schemes were working with Harbaugh, a scrambling quarterback who could improvise on the go.\n\n\u201cHe was an offensive genius,\u201d says Harbaugh. \u201cWeek after week, you could count on seven wide-open throws a game, just the way he was scheming it \u2013 15 yards-plus kind of completions. It was artful.\u201d\n\nThings were coming together defensively as well under coordinator Vince Tobin. In the victory over San Francisco, the Colts held an offense led by reigning league Most Valuable Player Steve Young to 269 yards.\n\nMidseason adversity\n\nThe Colts hit a rough stretch after the win over San Francisco, losing three of their next four games. But Harbaugh got the Colts rolling again with wins over the Patriots and Dolphins.\n\nIn Week 13, Harbaugh outdueled Dan Marino. Harbaugh threw for 180 yards and three touchdowns, one to second-year running back Marshall Faulk, who had 133 all-purpose yards. The Colts built a 24-0 lead and held off a late Miami charge for a 36-28 win.\n\nThe next week, Harbaugh was sacked six times by the Carolina Panthers and sustained a knee injury that forced him out of the game in the third quarter. Indianapolis lost 13-10, but of more concern was Harbaugh\u2019s condition \u2013 he would need arthroscopic surgery and it was uncertain how long he would be out of action.\n\nErickson would reprise his starter role in Week 15 and help lift Indianapolis to a road victory over the Jaguars. Bailey was the catalyst, taking the game\u2019s opening kickoff and returning it 95 yards for a touchdown, then scoring on a 14-yard touchdown reception to put Indianapolis up 14-0. The Colts held off Jacksonville for a 41-31 victory that pushed their record to 8-6.\n\nHarbaugh was back for the following week\u2019s game against San Diego after having surgery to remove damaged cartilage from his right knee.\n\n\u201cJim was getting knocked out and he\u2019s staggering on the field almost like in a boxing match,\u201d says Crockett. \u201cWhen you see a guy that lays it on the line like Jim did, you as a player, you have no excuse. None. You just go out and say: \u2018I\u2019m gonna give my all just like he did.\u2019 \u201d\n\nEntering Week 16, the Colts were in position to clinch a playoff berth for the first time in eight years and the second time since moving to Indianapolis in 1984, but they lost 27-24 to San Diego. The Colts would go into the final game of the regular season with a postseason berth in the balance.\n\nIn a nationally televised Sunday night game at the RCA Dome, the Colts intercepted New England quarterback Drew Bledsoe three times, and 157 all-purpose yards from backup running back Lamont Warren resulted in a 10-7 Colts win, securing a wild-card berth.\n\nHarbaugh, in his ninth pro season, earned his first Pro Bowl selection and was named Comeback Player of the Year. He led the NFL with a 100.7 passer rating while throwing 17 touchdown passes and a league-low five interceptions. His three fourth-quarter comeback wins also led the league.\n\nNothing to lose\n\nIn the playoffs, the Colts would face the team they played just 14 days earlier: the San Diego Chargers.\n\n\u201cGoing into San Diego, we were double-digit underdogs,\u201d Harbaugh recalls (it was actually 5\u00bd points, according to pro-football-reference.com). \u201cWe felt like we had nothing to lose, but yet, we\u2019re gonna win.\u201d\n\nFaulk \u2013 selected for the Pro Bowl after rushing for 1,078 yards and 11 touchdowns \u2013 left the game after his first carry \u2013 a 16-yard gain. He had re-injured his left knee, suffering from loose cartilage. With Faulk and starting fullback Roosevelt Potts out with injuries, it was up to Warren and Crockett to carry the rushing load.\n\nCrockett had only one NFL rushing attempt for no gain to that point.\n\n\u201cDuring pregame warm-ups, the general manager, Bill Tobin, came to me,\u201d says Crockett, \u201cand we talk to this day about this \u2013 he tapped me on my shoulder and said, \u2018We need you today.\u2019\u201d\n\nBy the end of the game, Crockett had rushed for 147 yards and two touchdowns on 13 carries.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, with Indianapolis clinging to a 21-20 lead, Crockett broke the Colts\u2019 all-time playoff record for longest rushing play, eclipsing Tom Matte\u2019s 58-yard run in the 1969 Super Bowl. Crockett\u2019s 66-yard run for his second touchdown would be enough for the Colts to advance to the divisional round.\n\n\u201cOnce I got past (Chargers linebacker) Junior (Seau) after the cutback, I saw daylight and I knew no one was gonna catch me with the speed that I had,\u201d Crockett says.\n\nThe moment encapsulated what the Colts had been doing all season: relying on someone new every week to come up with a big play.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t ask for a better stage than that as a rookie, having a lot of snaps behind a Hall of Famer like Marshall Faulk in practice,\u201d says Crockett. \u201cAnd yeah, I only had one carry during the season, but look at who I was behind. I was over-prepared for that game.\u201d\n\nThe Indianapolis defense was also key, intercepting Stan Humphries four times, two by free safety Jason Belser. The Colts went on to win 35-20 for the franchise\u2019s first playoff victory since 1971. It set up a matchup with Super Bowl favorite Kansas City.\n\nKids in a candy store\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs owned the best record in the NFL (13-3) and the league\u2019s top-ranked defense. They also hadn\u2019t lost at home.\n\n\u201c(Everybody was) talking about Kansas City and who they were gonna play (in the next round),\u201d says Bailey. \u201cOf course they looked past us.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I really don\u2019t think we were looking past them,\u201d says Greg Manusky, a linebacker on that '95 Chiefs squad and formerly the Colts' defensive coordinator. \u201cWe were giddied up and really excited to play the Colts. It wasn\u2019t like we were looking at who we were gonna play in the next game.\u201d\n\nSunday, Jan. 7, 1996 was a frigid day in Kansas City. The temperature at kickoff was zero with a wind chill of 15 below. The field turf, particularly on the sidelines, was hard as ice. For a team that played its home games in a domed stadium, it didn\u2019t bode well for Indianapolis.\n\n\u201cIt was so cold, you wanted something to warm you up, so you took hot apple cider to the field,\u201d Crockett says. \u201cIt was frozen by the time you got to the middle of the field. Guys like me from Florida, we\u2019re like, \u2018OK, we\u2019re gonna be tough.\u2019 I had no sleeves on with the Vaseline on the arms and then the shade came over the field by halftime. I literally almost froze to death.\u201d\n\nFacing the league\u2019s No. 1 rushing offense, the Colts defense proved to be the difference. Chiefs running back Marcus Allen rushed for 94 yards but did not get into the end zone, and Kansas City quarterback Steve Bono was intercepted three times.\n\nWith the weather conditions, Harbaugh wasn\u2019t very effective through the air \u2013 completing 12-of-27 passes for 112 yards \u2014 but he managed 48 yards on the ground, keeping drives alive when Kansas City\u2019s defense flushed him out of the pocket.\n\n\u201cWe called it plastering \u2013 you\u2019ve gotta plaster on the back end and that\u2019s what we had to do that day with Harbaugh,\u201d Manusky says. \u201cAnd I think he found a couple openings. With the conditions that we had and even though we had Neil Smith, Derek Thomas and Dan Saleaumua, we just didn\u2019t have an opportunity to get to him.\u201d\n\nA 7-7 contest at halftime, a Blanchard field goal in the third quarter would decide it. The Chiefs' Lin Elliott missed three field goals, including a 42-yarder that would have tied the score late in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cThey had a last-second field goal try and they end up missing it, and I remember nudging one of my best friends to this day, (wide receiver) Bobby Olive, and we went crazy,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cWe were like little kids in a candy store, running and jumping around, hugging each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were just like, \u2018When is this fairy tale gonna be over?\u2019 \u201d Crockett says.\n\nNext up would be the Pittsburgh Steelers for the right to play in the Super Bowl. But first, a homecoming.\n\nA football city is born\n\n\u201cI moved here from Chicago in \u201993 and we\u2019d go to Colts games because there were tickets everywhere,\u201d says Kent Sterling, assistant program director of Indianapolis radio station WIBC in 1996. \u201cAnd when there was a touchdown and you\u2019d stand up and cheer for the Colts, you\u2019d have a lady two rows behind you yelling at you to sit down. That\u2019s kind of the way this place was.\u201d\n\nAfter the Colts upset the Chiefs in Kansas City, the team was welcomed home by a crush of fans at the Indianapolis airport.\n\nWhile many became aware of Indianapolis as a football town after Peyton Manning became the Colts\u2019 quarterback in 1998 and the team became a perennial playoff contender, Bailey says it began before that.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta think about it. Indianapolis was a basketball city,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cYou fast-forward to right now: It\u2019s kind of split. It was flattering to see that 12th man \u2013 that\u2019s when they were born, that \u201995 season.\"\n\n\u201cWhen people lined up with banners and signs, we felt like rock stars coming back home that day,\u201d says Crockett. \u201cEveryone knew who you were. Imagine if we had social media like we have now; it would\u2019ve been unreal.\u201d\n\n\u2018We\u2019re the hot team\u2019\n\nThe Steelers were on a mission to reach the Super Bowl after coming up 3 yards short the season prior against the Chargers, and the Colts were coming in riding a wave of underdog momentum.\n\n\u201c(Marchibroda\u2019s message was:) \u2018Everyone\u2019s counting us out. We believe,\u2019 \u201d Bailey remembers. \u201c\u2018The guys here in this locker room believe. The people in Indianapolis believe. You play for them. You play for your brothers here in this locker room. We\u2019re the hot team.\u2019\u201d\n\nA Neil O\u2019Donnell touchdown pass to Kordell Stewart with 13 seconds left in the second quarter gave Pittsburgh a 10-6 lead going into halftime. Television replays showed Stewart stepped out of bounds and came back into the end zone to make the catch, but the penalty wasn't called.\n\nAfter the teams traded field goals, Harbaugh, beginning at the Colts\u2019 30-yard line early in the fourth quarter, threw three straight completions followed by a 47-yard touchdown pass to Floyd Turner to put Indianapolis ahead with 8:46 remaining in the game. With the Colts up 16-13, the Three Rivers Stadium crowd was stunned.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely an emotional roller coaster, from your heart racing to your heart pounding when you\u2019re kinda worried, to you\u2019re excited,\u201d says Bailey.\n\nIndianapolis had a third-and-1 at its own 31 with 3:57 to go. A first down would keep alive a drive that could eat enough clock to seal a trip to the Super Bowl. But blitzing Steelers cornerback Willie Williams swept in from the right side and grabbed Warren\u2019s ankle to bring him down short of a first down.\n\n\u201cIf he wouldn\u2019t have gotten an ankle tackle right there, man \u2026 the game was over,\u201d Crockett says. \u201cGame was over.\u201d\n\nThe Colts were forced to punt. On the third play of the next Pittsburgh drive, O\u2019Donnell threw a short pass intended for wide receiver Ernie Mills that Quentin Coryatt almost intercepted.\n\n\u201c(Coryatt) started running and at the last second, this guy comes in and punches the ball out of his arm,\u201d remembers Bailey.\n\nFollowing another incomplete pass, it was fourth-and-3. A stop here, and the Colts would have the football, 2 minutes away from Super Bowl XXX.\n\nBut O\u2019Donnell completed a pass over the middle to Andre Hastings for 9 yards.\n\nThe next play was a 37-yard completion to Mills to the 1, and running back Bam Morris took it in from there to give Pittsburgh a 20-16 lead with 1:34 to play.\n\nThe Colts began their final drive of the game at their own 16. With 88 seconds to go 84 yards, \u201cCaptain Comeback\u201d went to work.\n\n\u201cIt was just all in the moment,\u201d Harbaugh says. \u201cAnd you just trusted your teammates and had great confidence that they would make the appropriate play, finish their assignment, do their job.\u201d\n\nHarbaugh was forced out of the pocket on first down and threw the ball away.\n\nEighty-two seconds left.\n\nOn second down, Harbaugh completed a 7-yard pass to Warren to the 23.\n\nSeventy-four seconds.\n\nOn third-and-3, Harbaugh completed an 18-yard pass over the middle to Turner to the 41.\n\nSixty-six seconds.\n\nHarbaugh couldn\u2019t find an open receiver on the next play, and ran for 8 yards.\n\nTimeout with 39 seconds left.\n\nOn second down, Harbaugh threw over the middle for Turner again, but it went in and out of the hands of Steelers defensive back Chris Oldham. Harbaugh was slow getting up after taking a shot from Pittsburgh defensive end Brentson Buckner.\n\nBleeding from his right hand, Harbaugh threw his next pass incomplete for Warren, bringing up fourth-and-2.\n\nTwenty-eight seconds.\n\nHarbaugh found wide receiver Sean Dawkins, who went out of bounds at the Pittsburgh 38 for a first down.\n\nTwenty-one seconds.\n\nHarbaugh was immediately pressured by the Steelers\u2019 pass rush on the next play and scrambled to the 29. With no timeouts, he hurried everyone to the line of scrimmage and spiked the ball to stop the clock.\n\nFive seconds. One shot at the end zone. One shot at the Super Bowl.\n\nEverything in slow motion\n\nThe Colts ran the Hail Mary during Friday practices each week.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing that I could remember (in the huddle) that was any different than: Here\u2019s the play, and you trust that everybody\u2019s going to do what they\u2019re supposed to do,\u201d Harbaugh says. \u201cWithout even thinking that they wouldn\u2019t. Just trust and knowing that they would.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d been in close games most of the season,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cSo it was just like business as usual; we\u2019re gonna go down here, we\u2019re gonna make a play and we\u2019re gonna score.\u201d\n\nAs Harbaugh walked up to the line of scrimmage, he had only one thing on his mind.\n\n\u201cI just kept telling myself: 'Hit a spot, hit a spot 5 yards deep in the end zone and don\u2019t throw it out of the end zone,' \u201d Harbaugh recalls. \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t throw it out of the end zone.\u201d\n\nAs he jogged out to the right side as part of a triple-right formation for the Colts, Bailey was talking to himself, too.\n\n\u201cBrian Stablein, he was on my side; it was Brian, Floyd Turner and myself,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cBrian was always the tip guy because with his vertical he could jump up and tip the ball in the air or just jump up and catch the ball.\n\n\u201cAnd Floyd and I were the ones that were gonna catch the tip. I distinctly remember running down and thinking, 'I\u2019ve gotta get down here, I\u2019ve gotta get down here, I\u2019ve gotta get down here and get into position.' \u201d\n\nHarbaugh took the snap, dropped back, paused, and lofted the ball into the air.\n\n\u201cI turn around and I see the ball coming,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cAnd it\u2019s coming right to me. And your whole thought process is: I hope we can keep it inbounds. And as the ball was coming down, we started jostling for position.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m feeling guys tugging on my arms, I\u2019m feeling guys trying to pull me down. I\u2019m feeling guys grabbing the back of my jersey. You\u2019re shaking yourself loose through all this stuff, and then all at once, you jump up.\u201d\n\nThe ball was tipped and juggled between Bailey and multiple Steelers defenders. When Bailey fell to the ground, NBC television commentator Phil Simms yelled out: \"He caught it! He caught it!\u201d\n\nBailey stood up and with the football in his left hand, raised both hands in the air.\n\n\u201cWe were always taught: Make the ref make a decision,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cYou go up, you put the ball in the air. The ref says no, he saw it. And that was the end of the game.\u201d\n\nThe referees ruled the ball had hit the ground. It was all over. The Steelers were going to the Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a catch,\u201d says Crockett. \u201cI immediately just thought, 'I\u2019m going to the Super Bowl!' \u201d\n\nHarbaugh, from his vantage point, saw the officials signal incomplete pass and looked up at the stadium\u2019s big screen for a replay.\n\n\u201cThe first angle, (I thought) 'Oh, it looked like he caught it,' \u201d says Harbaugh. \u201cThe second one: 'Oh, he looked like he caught it.' The third one: 'Aaah, it probably hit the ground.' \u201d\n\n\u201cAll this is going on in my head \u2013 this is happening in real time, but I\u2019m seeing everything in slow motion,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cOf course, they\u2019ll show it on TV in super-slow motion \u2013 \u2018Oh, the ball\u2019s on his stomach!\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like catching a speeding bullet. It was tucked in between my arm \u2013 half the ball\u2019s on my arm and half the ball is on the ground. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re in a dream. You\u2019re trying to grab something, but you just can\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nHarbaugh watched a replay of the telecast the following week. Bailey didn\u2019t.\n\nHarbaugh would reach the Super Bowl, but not as a player. Eighteen years after that Hail Mary, he coached the 49ers to the 2013 Super Bowl, losing 34-31 to the Baltimore Ravens.\n\n\u201cEven that day,\u201d Harbaugh says of the 1995 AFC Championship Game, \u201cyou\u2019re walking off the field going, \u2018There will be other days.\u2019 As a player, it turned out that was the only one. That was as close as we got. Would\u2019ve liked to, and didn\u2019t. Facts are stubborn things. And that\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n\nLegacy\n\nIn February 1996, Marchibroda\u2019s contract was not renewed and Infante was named the new head coach. The Colts went 9-7 and returned to the playoffs, losing to the Steelers in the wild-card game. In 1997, with several key members of the \u201995 team now gone, Indianapolis started the season 0-10 and finished 3-13.\n\nThat result gave the Colts the No. 1 selection in the 1998 NFL draft, with which they picked Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning.\n\nManning would lead the franchise to 11 playoff appearances and a Super Bowl title in 13 seasons, making the Colts a perennial power in the AFC.\n\nColts owner Jim Irsay fired Tobin after the 1997 season, bringing in Bill Polian as president. But while the Colts lost 13 of their last 21 games on his watch, Tobin was the architect of a team that was inches away from reaching the Super Bowl in 1996.\n\n\u201cIf you really studied it, the job Bill Tobin did, putting that team together, and it wasn\u2019t just, \u2018Here are a bunch of high draft picks,\u2019 \u201d says Harbaugh. \u201cThere were high draft picks that were good, and there were guys like myself who were off the scrap heap. Just every piece on the board was like a chess piece. How about putting that roster together and it worked for what not too many years before was a 4-12 team?\u201d\n\nHarbaugh would spend the 1998 season with the Ravens, reunited with Marchibroda, who was now coaching Baltimore. Harbaugh finished out his playing career with the Chargers in 1999 and 2000.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s football career comes to an end,\u201d Harbaugh says. \u201cI mean, very few guys play their best football right up to their very last day and then retire. I take pride that I was replaced by Peyton Manning. That\u2019s pretty darn good. How does it get better than that?\u201d\n\nHarbaugh and Bailey will forever be linked with the final play of the 1995 AFC Championship Game.\n\n\u201cBeing back in Ann Arbor now (coaching Michigan football), there are a lot of people that know Aaron Bailey (who grew up in Ann Arbor),\u201d Harbaugh says. \u201cIt comes up a lot.\u201d\n\nBut both remember that season more for what was than what could have been.\n\n\u201cIt was a heck of a time,\u201d says Harbaugh. \u201cIt was a rare thing. And it was great to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nFollow IndyStar reporter Manny Randhawa on Twitter: @MannyRsports.\n\n1995 Indianapolis Colts Schedule"}, {"url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1996-01-11-9601110073-story.html", "page_content": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 If Bill Tobin has turned around the Indianapolis Colts three years after leaving the Bears, it raises the question of whether Chicago made a mistake in turning away its player-personnel director when Dave Wannstedt was hired in 1993.\n\nTobin has more power as Colts vice president and director of football operations than the Bears ever gave him. Now he is one victory from the Super Bowl and universal acclaim as one of the NFL's shrewdest architects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShould the Colts' joy ride continue Sunday with a victory at Pittsburgh in the AFC championship game, more questions will be asked about whether Tobin as general manager and Wannstedt as coach couldn't have been a harmonious and winning arrangement at Halas Hall.\n\nPerhaps Wannstedt would have spurned the Bears in that case, since he didn't accept a New York Giants job offer that would have left personnel decisions in the hands of General Manager George Young. Dan Reeves is now chafing under that yoke.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in the two years of drafts since Tobin and the Bears parted, his selections have shown a more immediate dividend than Wannstedt's. For while Wannstedt doesn't own the GM title, he nonetheless is the final word in any personnel judgments and is responsible for acting on his scouting staff's recommendations.\n\nTobin and Wannstedt would have disagreed, however, from the start.\n\nTobin wouldn't have drafted Curtis Conway with the Bears' first pick in April 1993. His wide receiver choice would have been O.J. McDuffie, who made 62 catches for 819 yards and eight touchdowns with Miami this season, as well as a 24.5-yard kick-return average.\n\n\"We had McDuffie rated higher than Conway and, if I was going to be there, we needed a good player right away and not any spoiled guy from L.A.,\" Tobin said Wednesday. Conway, who led the Bears with 12 touchdown catches in 1995, \"may be a great player, but he was not my best wide receiver.\"\n\nTobin was a lame-duck player-personnel director at the time. Coach Mike Ditka had been fired after a 5-11 record in 1992, and Tobin was in the Halas Hall draft room in 1993 mainly as a traffic cop, overseeing the grading of the draftees with Bear scouts. He didn't have an ounce of influence in final decisions in his last official act as a Bear.\n\nA second disagreement would have come over Jim Harbaugh, the quarterback the Bears waived in March 1994. Harbaugh happens to be leading the Colts onward and upward.\n\nTobin's 1994 draft, in contrast to Wannstedt's, had staying power. Seven of his first eight picks finished the season on the Colts' active roster.\n\nThe Bears, on the other hand, took offensive tackle Marcus Spears in the second round in 1994, and defensive lineman Pat Riley and punter-kicker Todd Sauerbrun in Round 2 of 1995. Spears and Riley basically didn't play this season, when the Bears went 9-7 and missed the playoffs. Sauerbrun was a spectacular dud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTobin refuses to assess the Bears' drafts the last two years, feeling it's not his place. He prefers to talk about his top two draft picks in 1994: running back Marshall Faulk (now out with a knee injury) and Trev Alberts, a key to the Colts' shifting defense from a 4-3 to a 3-4 with his ability to play linebacker or end. Alberts doesn't start, but has been involved in 68 percent of the total plays.\n\nRookie defensive tackle Ellis Johnson, Tobin's first-round pick in 1995, remains a work in progress, but he started in place of an ill Tony Siragusa in Sunday's victory in Kansas City. Ex-Illini tight end Ken Dilger, Tobin's second pick from 1995, was the Colts' third-leading receiver this season with 635 yards, and his four receiving touchdowns tied for the team lead.\n\nCompare the impact of Faulk on the Colts and that of defensive end John Thierry, the Bears' first-rounder in 1994, on Chicago, and Tobin wins the comparison hands down at this point. Compare Dilger with Sauerbrun and Riley, and the same applies.\n\n\"Next season Thierry can be the Conway of 1995,\" Wannstedt contends, believing that with time, Thierry will mature on the line the way Conway did this season as a big-play receiver.\n\nOthers can argue the Bears would be better off with Tobin still working at Halas Hall, still offering his learned and diversified opinion of college talent. Tobin thinks the separation was needed.\n\n\"It was time to leave when I left,\" he said. \"I had 18 good years in Chicago. But my contract was being overriden by what (Bears President Mike McCaskey) promised Dave. The philosophy was changing and went against my principles, what I believed to be true.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTobin didn't just bring in talent in Indy.\n\n\"We found some players here they didn't know they had. Tony McCoy was sitting on the bench. They had Ray Buchanan at corner, and David Tate wasn't here. Stephen Grant was just a name.

But George won\u2019t be offering any more help.\n\nHe was traded Thursday to the Atlanta Falcons for firstand third-round draft picks this year and a second-rounder in 1996.\n\nAfter four largely unproductive years and nearly $13 million in salary and bonuses, he was swept out by the Colts new vice president, Bill Tobin.\n\nIt was one of several significant player deals announced Thursday. More could be on the way next week, according to club officials and agents.\n\n\u2014 San Diego, up against the salary cap and unable to afford transition player wide receiver Anthony Miller, declined to match a four-year, $10.4 million offer from Denver and instead traded a fourth-round pick for Dolphins receiver Tony Martin.\n\n\u2014 San Francisco, its vulnerability at inside linebacker exposed in the NFC championship game by Dallas, signed unrestricted free agent Gary Plummer of the Chargers. The price tag: $1.8 million over two years.\n\n\u2014 Eric Hill, a five-year starter at inside linebacker for the Arizona Cardinals, agreed to terms with the club. As a designated transition player, Hill will make at least $2.5 million this season, six times the $410,000 he was paid for playing in 13 games last year.\n\nFrom the day Tobin joined the Colts in January, he made it no secret he wasn\u2019t enamored with George, his 1993 holdout or his shaky relationship with fellow players.\n\n\u201cAll of his signs to us were that he wanted to be traded,\u201d said Tobin. \u201cWe granted his wish.\u201d\n\nThe deal gives the Colts the No. 2 and No. 7 picks in the draft, but Tobin wouldn\u2019t say if he was going to select one of the top two college quarterbacks \u2013 Trent Dilfer of Fresno State or Heath Shuler of Tennessee.\n\nThe trade leaves two quarterbacks on the Colts roster \u2013 Don Majkowski and Jack Trudeau. It\u2019s a good bet Tobin is not going into 1994 with either penciled in as his starter.\n\nHe is believed to be interested in Jim Harbaugh, whom he drafted in 1987 as vice president of the Chicago Bears.\n\nHarbaugh was released by Chicago for failing to produce a winner. The Bears replaced him with Erik Kramer, formerly of Detroit.\n\nGeorge was 14-25 as a starter with 41 touchdowns and 46 interceptions. Like another quarterback who was a No. 1 pick, Vinny Testaverde, he never matched his draft status.\n\nBut George rejected any comparisons with Testaverde. \u201cI had success in Indianapolis,\u201d he contended.\n\nIn Atlanta, he\u2019ll be tutored personally by new head coach June Jones, who has raised the level of play of two other Falcons\u2019 quarterbacks \u2013 Chris Miller and Bobby Hebert.\n\nFalcons Vice President Ken Herock said he had extensive discussions with former Colts front office employees to gather information about George\u2019s emotional problems.\n\nHe pronounced himself satisfied and went on to say that Jones would make George into a Pro Bowl quarterback.\n\n\u201cA lot of guys have talent but can never take it to another level. Jeff can,\u201d said Jones.\n\nGeorge said he was greatly relieved to be leaving his hometown. \u201cI think since I stepped foot in Indianapolis after the draft \u2013 I can\u2019t put my finger on it \u2013 but I\u2019ve never been accepted. Maybe the city got tired of hearing about Jeff George. Maybe I wore out my welcome. I did the best I could.\u201d\n\nHe has two years left on his contract and the trade produces $1.5 million of additional cap money for the hamstrung Colts.\n\nThe big loser is Hebert, who won\u2019t be recovered from elbow surgery until approximately June 1. He probably will be traded or released.\n\nMiller thrills Denver\n\nSan Diego had been expected all week to match for Miller, but was forced into a strictly financial decision because of the cap. \u201cWe thought we had only a 30 percent chance of getting him,\u201d said Denver owner Pat Bowlen.\n\nHe was the Broncos\u2019 second choice after the Raiders matched Denver\u2019s offer for transition receiver Tim Brown.\n\n\u201cJohn [Elway) is going to love having a deep threat,\u201d said Bowlen. Miller is the fastest receiver in a Broncos uniform since the days of Rick Upchurch.\n\nScramble for Bono\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s attention now turns to backup quarterback Steve Bono, who is coveted by several teams, including Kansas City, Washington and Minnesota.\n\nSources said the 49ers will offer Bono ($1.5 million in 1994) a restructured contract with guaranteed bonuses on the back end of the deal in order to keep him and make room on the cap.\n\nBut the Chiefs want him as a part-time starter with his good friend, Joe Montana, in an interesting new quarterbacking concept.\n\nIf Bono balks at a restructured deal, he\u2019s probably gone. The 49ers can\u2019t afford his paycheck.\n\nAccording to one source, Kansas City wants to design a schedule in which Montana takes off six to eight weeks, thereby lessening his chances of injury, and use Bono in the other starts.\n\n\u201cI think this would be acceptable to Joe only if it\u2019s Steve Bono. They are that close and it won\u2019t be another Steve Young situation.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.upi.com/Archives/1997/12/22/Infante-Tobin-fired-by-Colts/4204882766800/", "page_content": "INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. 22 -- In what could be a very busy period of coaches' firings, the Indianapolis Colts made the first move today (Monday) by announcing the expected firing of coach Lindy Infante. The Colts' league-worst 3-13 season, capped by Sunday's 39-28 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, also cost Bill Tobin his job as vice president and director of football operations.' 'We gave it a good run,' says Infante, 'but this season wasn't meant to be.' The Colts were able to split their last six games, including wins over Green Bay and Miami, but Infante's fate may have been sealed fate by the team's horrendous 0-10 start. In his two seasons, Infante had a record of 12-20. The 57-year-old Infante got off to a good start during his first season on the job in 1996, when the Colts began the season 4-0, ended at 9-7 and gained a wild-card berth. They were beaten by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the playoffs, 42-14. Infante also served as the Colts' offensive coordinator in 1995, and was head coach of the Green Bay Packers from 1988-91. At Green Bay, where he went 24-40, he was named the Coach of the Year after leading the Packers to a 10-6 mark in 1989. The 56 year-old Tobin has spent the last three seasons with Indianapolis. He was responsible for the signings of free agents like Jim Harbaugh, Tony Bennett, Jay Leeuwenburg and Cary Blanchard, and oversaw the selections of running back Marshall Faulk, tight end Ken Dilger and wide receiver Marvin Harrison in the draft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of them helped Indianapolis reach the AFC title game in 1995. 'I have no regrets other than I didn't get a chance to see this through,' Tobin said. Before coming to Indianapolis, Tobin spent the previous 18 seasons with the Chicago Bears and was a big part of the Bears' Super Bowl winning team in 1985."}]}
