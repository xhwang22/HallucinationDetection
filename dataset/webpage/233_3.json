The chant was intended to mock their Ukrainian opponents by referencing Russian President Vladimir Putin's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before the chant became an international scandal. Some newspapers described the chant as \u201cdisgusting.\u201d After the game, speaking to the press, Fenerbahce coach Jorge Jesus did not mention the chant. But on July 28, the club management issued a statement condemning the chant: \u201cWhatever the cause, by no means, as Fenerbahce Club we accept the chants that were voiced at the stadium.\u201d The club's management also said the 20-second judgment lapse in a game of 120 minutes should not define the team's values or the club's fans.\n\nThe chant came after Dynamo Kyiv's midfielder, Vitaliy Buyalskyi, scored the team's first goal.

Today, a large number of families in Great Britain buyfurniture, household goods and cars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbyinstallment. In the U.S. , the figure is much higher than in Great Britain, andpeople there spend over 10 percent of their income on the installment plan.\n\nThe price of an article bought oninstallment is always higher than the price that would be paid by cash. Thereis a charge for interest. The buyer pays one quarter or one third of the priceas a down payment\uff08\u9996\u671f\u4ed8\u6b3e\uff09 when the goods are delivered tohim. He then makes regular payments, weekly or monthly, until the full piece ispaid up. The legal ownership of the goods remains with the seller until thefinal payment has been made.\n\nInstallment buyinghas advantages and disadvantages. It can help couples with small incomes tofurnish their homes and start housekeeping. It increases the demand for goods,and in this way helps business and employment. There is, however, the dangerthat when business is bad, installment buying may end suddenly, making businessmuch worse. This may result in a great increase in unemployment. If the peopleon the installment plan lose their jobs, they will probably not be able to maketheir payments. If great numbers of people are not able to pay theirinstallment debts there is a possibility that businessmen cannot collect theirdebts and will therefore lose money. If businessmen lose money or fail to makea satisfactory profit, it becomes more likely to have a depression. This iswhy, in some countries, the government controls the installment plan by fixingthe amount of the down payment and each of the following installments todiscourage people from buying more than they can pay for on the installmentplan.\n\n36.Whichof the following is NOT true about the installment plan?\n\nA. Alot of British families use the installment plan.\n\nB. Morethan 10 percent American families buy things on installments.\n\nC. Americansdepend more on installment than British people do.\n\nD.

There are no costs for message time or space. An ad in primetime television may cost $ 250,000 or mare per minute, whereas a five-minutereport on a network newscast would not cost anything. However, there are costsfor news releases \uff08\u53d1\u5e03\uff09, a publicity department, and otheritems. As with advertising, publicity reaches a mass audience. Within a shorttime, new products or company policies are widely known.\n\nCredibility\uff08\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff09about messages is high, because they are reported in independent media. Anewspaper review of a movie has more believability than an ad in the samepaper, because the reader associates independence with objectivity. Similarly,people are more likely to pay attention to news reports than ads. Readers spendtime reading the stories, but they flip through \uff08\u8349\u8349\u7ffb\u9605\uff09the ads.Furthermore, there may be hundreds of ads in a magazine. Feature stories \uff08\u4e13\u9898\u62a5\u9053\uff09aremuch fewer in number and stand out clearly.\n\nPublicityalso has some significant limitations. A firm has little control over messages,their timing, placement\uff08\u62a5\u9053\u987a\u5e8f\uff09, or coverage. It may issue detailednews releases and find only small portions of them reported by the media; andmedia have the ability to be much more critical than a company would like. Afirm may want publicity during certain periods, such as when a new product isintroduced or new store opened, but the media may not cover the introduction oropening until after the time it would aid the firm. Similarly, media determinethe placement of a story; it may follow a report on crime or sports. Finally,the media ascertain\uff08\u786e\u5b9a\uff09whether to cover a story at all andthe amount of coverage to be devoted to it. A company-sponsored\uff08\u8d5e\u52a9\uff09jobprogram might go unreported or receive three-sentence coverage in a localnewspaper.\n\n41.The author mentions all ofthe following advantages of publicity EXCEPT ______.\n\nA.having no time costs B.having attentiveness\n\nC.having high credibility D.having no space costs\n\n\u3010\u7b54\u6848\u3011B\n\n\u3010\u89e3\u6790\u3011\u9898\u76ee\u95ee\u5f97\u662f\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u5230\u7684\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\u9664\u4e86\u4e0b\u5217\u7684\u54ea\u4e2a\uff0cB \u662f\u8bf4\u62a5\u9053\u6709\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6587\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u63d0\u5230\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u9009 B\n\n42.People are more likely tobelieve in news repots than ads because ______.\n\nA. theyreach a larger audience than ads do\n\nB. they areall latest events\n\nC. theyappear in independent media\n\nD. they aremuch more in number and stand out clearly\n\n\u3010\u7b54\u6848\u3011C\n\n\u3010\u89e3\u6790\u3011\u672c\u9898\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6bb5\u4e2d\u201cA newspaper\u2026\u2026\u2026Futhermore,theremay behundreds of ads in a magazine\u201d\u627e\u5230\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\n\n\u9009C\n\n\n\n\n\n43.Which of the following in NOT a limitation of publicity?\n\nA.Bad timing B.Very detailed\n\nreporting\n\nC.Placement after a report on crime D.Being reported much less than expected\n\n\u3010\u7b54\u6848\u3011B\n\n\u3010\u89e3\u6790\u3011\u6ce8\u610f\u9898\u76ee\u4e2d\u201cNot\u201d\uff0c\u672c\u9898\u7b54\u6848\u5728\u7b2c\u4e09\u6bb5\uff0c\u9009\u9879 B\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u63d0\u5230\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u9009 B\n\n44.One of the reasons why feature stories seem more reliablethan ads is that ______.\n\nA.they are more believable B.they are more objective\n\nC.they are more interesting D.they are much fewer in number\n\nand standout clearly\n\n\u3010\u7b54\u6848\u3011D\n\n\u3010\u89e3\u6790\u3011\u672c\u9898\u5728\u6587\u7ae0\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6bb5\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u53e5\u8bdd\uff0c\u6545\u9009 D\n\n45.The last sentence in the last paragraph implies that______.\n\nA. theplacement of a story is not quite important\n\nB. thereport of a crime may not be true\n\nC. local newspapers may not be interested incompany-sponsored programs D. publicity is always successful\n\n\u3010\u7b54\u6848\u3011C\n\n\u3010\u89e3\u6790\u3011\u7531\u6587\u7ae0\u7b2c\u4e09\u6bb5\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u9009\u9879 A\u6ca1\u6709\u63d0\u5230\uff0cB \u9519\u8bef\uff0cD \u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\u662f\u9519\u7684\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9 D\n\nPassage 3\n\nTheidea behind \u201c the rule of law \u201d is that it is laws based on logical reasons andclear thinking that should govern social life. \u201c We live under a rule of law,not of men. \u201d American teachers tell their students. The students accept theidea. They believe that \u201cno man is above the law,\u201d and that laws apply equallyto all people no matter how wealthy they are, what their personal connectionsare, or what their stations in life are. Their faith in the rule of lawexplains the belief many Americans held, and many foreigners could notunderstand, that President Richard Nixon should be removed from office as aresult of his behavior in connection with what was called\u201c Watergate Scandal (\u6c34\u95e8\u4e8b\u4ef6)\u201d.Nixon had broken the law and therefore should be punished, Americans believed,even if he was the President.\n\nThe belief in therule of law goes beyond the area of politics to other areas of life that aregoverned by formal rules and procedures. To get a job with governmentinstitutions, for example, or to get government funding for a research project,one must follow published procedures and show that one meets the publishedrequirements. Personal connections are not supposed to matter under the rule oflaw.\n\nThisis not to say that personal contacts, wealth, and social influence do notmatter in situations where laws and rules are to be obeyed. They may.What is said above describes the ideal with which Americans agree. In reality,connections can sometimes help a person get a government job.

Current treatments forinfertility, in terms of percentages\uff08\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\uff09, are notvery successful. Couples go through physically and emotionally painfulprocedures for a small chance of having children. Many couples run out of timeand money without successfully having children. Human cloning could make itpossible for many more infertile couples to have children than ever before. Weshould be able to clone the bone marrow (\u9aa8\u9ad3) forchildren and adults suffering from leukemia (\u767d\u8840\u75c5). This isexpected to be one of the first benefits to come from cloning technology.\n\nWemay learn how to switch cells on and off through cloning and thus be able tocure cancer. Cloning technology can be used to test for and perhaps curegene-related diseases. The above are just a few examples of what human cloningtechnology can do for mankind.\n\nThisnew technology promises unprecedented advancement in medicine if people will releasetheir fears and let the benefits begin.\n\n51.

His comedy (\u559c\u5267\uff09doesn\u2019t depend upon words or language, but on the little actions which mean the same thing to people all over the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his films, Chaplin raises his thick black eyebrow ( \u7709\u6bdb ).He straightens his coat or swings his walking stick in the air. He hides behind a fat lady or climbs under a table to escape from his enemies. Trying to be brave, he faints away on the floor. He pretends to be what he is not and never could be a rich\uff0csuccessful, important man. It is the secret fo Chaplin\u2019s huge success.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe discovered the character of the little tramp almost by accident. As young men, he and his brother traveled to America in a small company of actors and acted in various cities. One day Charles was invited to join a new company that was making comedies. It was in his second film that he wore the clothes that made his reputation : black hat, tight coat, big trousers, huge shoes, moustache ( \u80e1\u987b )and walking stick. He intended simply to make people laugh. But the odd disguises(\u626e\u76f8)made him look both comic and sad.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis appearance was a popular success, right form the beginning. But his early films hadn\u2019t much story. They were full of actions.

Later he used sharp bone or horn, metal knives and more recently, rubber and plastic and that was where we stuck, in surgical instrument terms, for many years. In the 1960s a new tool was developed\uff0cone which was, first of all\uff0cto be of great practical use to the armed forces and industry, but which was also, in time, to change greatly the art and science of surgery.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tool is the laser (\u6fc0\u5149\uff09and it is being used by more and more surgeons all over the world. As we all know, light is hot^ any source of light\u2014from the sun itself down to a simple match burning\u2014will give warmth. But light is usually spread out over a wide area. The light in a laser beam (\u6fc0\u5149\u675f)\uff0chowever, is concentrated ( \u5bc6\n\n\n\n\n\n\u96c6).This means that a light with no more power than that produced by an ordinary electric light bulb becomes intensely strong as it is concentrated to a pinpoint-sized (\u9488\u5c16\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\uff09beam.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiments with these pinpoint beams showed researchers that different energy sources produce beams that have a particular effect on certain living cells. It is now possible for eye surgeons to operate on the back of human eye without harming the front of the eye, simply by passing a laser beam right through the aye -ball.No knives, no stitches (\u7f1d\u9488)\uff0cno unwanted damage\u2014a true surgical wonder. Operations which once made patients tired and in need of long period of recovery time now leave them feeling calm and comfortable. So much more difficult operations can now be tried.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rapid development of laser techniques in the past ten years has made it clear that the future is likely to be very exciting.Perhaps some cancers will be treated with laser in a way that makes surgery not only safer but also more effective. Altogether, tomorrow may see more information coming to light on the diseases which can be treated medically.\n\n51.

Investigators obtained evidence of cheating and bribery involving 19 first and second division games, the police said.\n\nAt the centre of the scandal is Fenerbahce, and it is claimed that the club risklosing their league title in the same manner as the Italian club Juventus, who were stripped of their 2005 and 2006 Italian league titles over a similar scandal.\n\nThe Turkish football federation said it aims to decide on what measures, if any, it will take against the Istanbul club by 15 July; the cut-off date for notification to Uefa of which teams will play in European competitions. The investigation has also caused financial damage to Fenerbahce as its shares plunged in the Istanbul stock market.\n\nOn Thursday the court in Istanbul arraigned 15 more suspects, including senior Fenerbahce officials, increasing the number of suspects in jail pending trial to 22.\n\nIt is claimed the court also issued a warrant for the Fenerbahce president Aziz Yildirim, who newspaper reports say is suspected of bribing rival teams' players to play badly. Yildirim was in hospital after undergoing a cardiology check-up, the reports said, although Fenerbahce described him as being detained.
