The song's catchy guitar riff and memorable chorus make it a timeless classic that has stood the test of time. \"Dreams\" quickly rose up the charts and peaked at number 27 on the US Billboard Hot 100, while also reaching the top 20 in several other countries including the UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nThe success of \"Dreams\" propelled The Cranberries to stardom, as they soon became one of the most popular bands of the 1990s. The band's debut album, \"Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?\" was a commercial success, selling over 6 million copies worldwide. The album featured other hit songs such as \"Linger\" and \"Sunday,\" which further solidified The Cranberries' status as one of the most exciting new bands in the music industry.\n\nThe Cranberries continued their success with subsequent albums, including 1994's \"No Need to Argue,\" which featured the hit song \"Zombie,\" a politically charged track that has become one of the band's most iconic songs. The band's next album, \"To the Faithful Departed\" (1996), explored themes of social and political injustice and featured collaborations with artists such as The Pretenders' Chrissie Hynde and The Smiths' Johnny Marr.\n\nSign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Subscribe to IrishCentral\n\nThe Cranberries' success in the 1990s was largely due to their unique sound and O'Riordan's powerful vocals. The band's blend of alternative rock and Celtic folk music, combined with O'Riordan's distinctive voice and poetic lyrics, set them apart from other bands of the time. The band's music tackled a variety of social and political issues, including the Troubles in Northern Ireland, animal rights, and the environment, making them a favorite among fans who appreciated their meaningful lyrics.\n\nSadly, in 2018, Dolores O'Riordan passed away at the age of 46. Her death was a huge loss to the music world and to The Cranberries' devoted fanbase. However, the band's legacy lives on through their timeless music, including their iconic hit \"Dreams.\" The song's enduring popularity is a testament to the band's talent and the impact they had on the music industry during the 1990s and beyond.\n\nCheck out the video here:\n\nLyrics of \"Dreams\" by The Cranberries:\n\nOh, my life is changing every day\n\nIn every possible way\n\nAnd oh, my dreams\n\nIt's never quite as it seems\n\nNever quite as it seems\n\nI know I felt like this before\n\nBut now I'm feeling it even more\n\nBecause it came from you\n\nThen I open up and see\n\nThe person falling here is me\n\nA different way to be\n\nAah, la-ah-la-ah\n\nLa-la-la\n\nLa-ah-la-ah\n\nI want more, impossible to ignore\n\nImpossible to ignore\n\nAnd they'll come true\n\nImpossible not to do\n\nPossible not to do\n\nAnd now I tell you openly\n\nYou have my heart so don't hurt me\n\nYou're what I couldn't find\n\nA totally amazing mind\n\nSo understanding and so kind\n\nYou're everything to me\n\nOh, my life is changing every day\n\nIn every possible way\n\nAnd oh, my dreams\n\nIt's never quite as it seems\n\n'Cause you're a dream to me\n\nDream to me."}, {"url": "https://genius.com/artists/The-cranberries", "page_content": "About The Cranberries\n\nThe Cranberries were an Irish band who found major international success throughout the 1990s as a part of the alternative rock movement. The group\u2019s lineup included Dolores O'Riordan (singer and songwriter), Noel Hogan (guitarist and songwriter), Mike Hogan (bassist) and Fergal Lawler (drummer). Originally formed in 1989 under the name The Cranberry Saw Us, the band released an independent EP in 1991 that caught the attention of the industry. SPIN Magazine described the band\u2019s sound as \u201cdreamy swirl pop, midway between The Smiths and the Cocteau Twins cradling the will-o\u2019-the-wispy vocals of Dolores O\u2019Riordan.\u201d\n\nIn 1992, the band began recording their first album for Island Records with Stephen Street, a producer best known for working with The Smiths. Their debut, Everybody Else is Doing It So Why Can\u2019t We?, was initially ignored when released in early 1993, and it wasn\u2019t until that fall\u2014after the band opened for Suede and Duran Duran on their US tours\u2014that MTV picked up on their single \u201cLinger\u201d. The song eventually peaked at #4 on the US Pop chart in 1994, and the album sold five million copies. Success around the world followed.\n\nLater that year, the band released their sophomore album No Need To Argue, which went on to sell 7 million copies in the US. The lead single, \u201cZombie,\u201d was a departure from the wistful love songs the band was known for, showcasing aggressive distorted guitars and a bold political message. The song was an immediate smash, hitting at #1 in several countries and topping the US Modern Rock chart. The follow-up single \u201cOde To My Family,\u201d was a top 40 hit as well.\n\nIn 1996, The Cranberries collaborated with Bruce Fairbairn (Bon Jovi, Aerosmith) on their third album To The Faithful Departed, which experimented with new sounds and continued the band\u2019s embrace of hard rock. The album received mixed reviews and sold about half as well as their previous albums, but it did include the #1 US Modern Rock song \u201cSalvation\u201d.\n\nThe band\u2019s 1999 album Bury The Hatchet\u2014self-produced by The Cranberries and engineer Ben Fenner\u2014went gold and failed to produce any top 40 hits in the US. In 2002, they reunited with producer Stephen Street on Wake Up And Smell The Coffee, but the mainstream had largely lost interest in the band by this point. A hiatus\u2014during which O\u2019Riordan released two solo albums\u2014followed. The band reunited in 2012 for the independent album Roses.\n\nOn Jan. 16, 2018, an official spokesperson for the Cranberries announced that Dolores O'Riordan died \u201csuddenly\u201d in her home in London. She was 46."}, {"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-cranberries-mn0000784814/biography", "page_content": "Combining the melodic jangle of post-Smiths indie guitar pop with the lilting, trance-inducing sonic textures of late-'80s dream pop and adding a slight Celtic tint, the Cranberries became one of the more successful groups to emerge from the pre-Brit-pop indie scene of the early '90s. Led by vocalist Dolores O'Riordan, whose keening, powerful voice was the most distinctive element of the group's sound, they initially had little impact in the United Kingdom. It wasn't until the lush ballad \"Linger\" became a worldwide hit in 1993 that the band achieved mass success. Following \"Linger,\" the Cranberries quickly became international stars, as both their 1993 debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, and its 1994 follow-up, No Need to Argue, sold millions of copies and produced a string of hit singles. By the time of their third album, 1996's To the Faithful Departed, they had added distorted guitars to their sonic palette and began crafting more socially conscious music. They continued down this path into the 21st century before taking an extended hiatus in 2003 to pursue solo efforts. After nearly a decade, the quartet returned with 2012's Roses and 2017's Something Else. However, in early 2018, O'Riordan died from an accidental drowning in London. Her last vocal recordings were used to construct the Cranberries' final work, 2019's Grammy-nominated In the End, a goodbye to O'Riordan, fans, and the band itself.\n\nOriginally, the Cranberries were a band called the Cranberry Saw Us. Brothers Noel and Mike Hogan (guitar and bass, respectively) formed the band in Limerick, Ireland, with drummer Fergal Lawler in 1990. Following the departure of the group's original singer, Niall Quinn, the trio placed an advertisement for a female singer. Dolores O'Riordan responded to the advertisement and auditioned by writing lyrics and melodies to some of the band's existing demos. When she returned with a rough version of \"Linger,\" the group hired her on the spot. Shortly after she joined, the band recorded a demo tape and sold it in record stores throughout Ireland. After the original run of 300 copies sold out, the group truncated its name to the Cranberries and sent another demo tape, which featured early versions of both \"Linger\" and \"Dreams,\" to record companies throughout the U.K. The tape was made at Xeric Studios, which was run by Pearse Gilmore, who would later become their manager. At the time the tape was made, all of the members were still in their late teens.\n\nThe demo tape earned the attention of both the U.K. press and record industry, and there was soon a bidding war between major British record labels. Eventually, the group signed with Island. The Cranberries headed into the studio with Gilmore as their producer to record their first single, \"Uncertain.\" The title proved to be prophetic, as the band did indeed sound ill at ease on the single, leading to poor reviews in the press in addition to tensions between the group and Gilmore. Before they were scheduled to record their debut in 1992, the Cranberries discovered that Gilmore had signed a secret deal with Island to improve his studios. The tensions within the band became so great they nearly broke up. Instead, the Cranberries severed all relations with Gilmore, hired Geoff Travis of Rough Trade as their new manager, and hired Stephen Street, who had previously worked with the Smiths, as their new producer.\n\nThe band's debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, was released in the spring of 1993, followed by a single of \"Dreams.\" Neither the album nor the single gained much attention, nor did the second single, \"Linger.\" In the summer and fall of 1993, the band toured the United States, opening for The The and Suede, respectively; frequently, the Cranberries were given a friendlier reception than either of the headliners. Their strong live shows led MTV to put \"Linger\" into heavy rotation. By the end of the year, the single was on its way to becoming a crossover hit. Eventually, the single reached number eight on the U.S. charts, while the album went double platinum. Everybody Else and \"Linger\" began to take off in Britain in early 1994; the album eventually peaked at number one during the summer.\n\nO'Riordan married the band's tour manager, Don Burton, in a much-publicized ceremony in July 1994. The marriage, as well as the group's videos, emphasized the singer as the focal point of the band. O'Riordan's position in the group continued to rise with the fall release of the group's second album, No Need to Argue. Boasting a slightly harder, more streamlined sound, yet still produced by Stephen Street, the record debuted at number six on the U.S. charts and eventually outsold its predecessor; within a year it went triple platinum, spawning the number one modern rock hit \"Zombie\" and the number 11 \"Ode to My Family.\"\n\nDuring the tour for No Need to Argue, rumors began to circulate that O'Riordan was going to leave the band to pursue a solo career, all of which the band vehemently denied. Nevertheless, the rumors persisted until the Cranberries began recording their next album with producer Bruce Fairbairn, who had previously worked with Aerosmith. The resulting effort, To the Faithful Departed, was a tougher, more rock-oriented affair. Upon its spring 1996 release, it entered the charts at number six, but its first single, \"Salvation,\" failed to become a hit on par with \"Zombie,\" \"Linger,\" or \"Ode to My Family.\" Consequently, the album slipped down the charts relatively quickly and only went platinum, which was slightly disappointing in light of its two predecessors' multi-platinum status.\n\nDuring the fall of 1996, the group canceled its Australian and European tours, sparking another round of rumors about O'Riordan launching a solo career. In 1999, the group released Bury the Hatchet, their last big chart hit, and quickly followed with 2001's Wake Up and Smell the Coffee. Shortly after the release of a greatest-hits compilation in 2003, Stars: The Best of 1992-2002, the Cranberries officially declared that they were taking a break. This finally gave O'Riordan the time she needed to work on her long-talked-about solo album, Are You Listening?, which hit shelves in 2007. In 2009, O'Riordan released her second solo album, No Baggage. Around the same time, the Cranberries reunited for a North American tour that continued throughout Europe in 2010. Several live albums also appeared in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, the band began work on a new album in Toronto with longtime producer Street. Released nearly a decade after the start of their extended hiatus, the resulting album, Roses, arrived in March 2012. A supporting tour followed, recorded for posterity at London's Hammersmith Apollo on Live 2012. At the end of 2013, O'Riordan performed a New Year's Eve concert in Limerick with a string quartet from the Irish Chamber Orchestra. Inspired by the classical interpretation of the Cranberries sound, she approached the band with an idea to celebrate their silver anniversary. The result was a full album comprising string quartet renditions of the band's biggest hits. Something Else arrived in the spring of 2017, featuring their ten most successful singles culled from their first four albums, as well as three new songs. The band kicked off a tour in support of the album, but it was cut short due to O'Riordan's ongoing back problems.\n\nOn January 15, 2018, O'Riordan died of an accidental drowning at the age of 46 in London. At the time of her death, the Cranberries were in the middle of recording a new effort. After taking some time to process the tragedy, the remaining bandmembers decided to finish the project. Along with Stephen Street, they completed the LP using O'Riordan's demo vocals. Released in April 2019, In the End featured the single \"All Over Now\" and served as the Cranberries' final album. Peaking in the Top 10 across Europe and in the U.S. side charts, the farewell set was later nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Album."}, {"url": "https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/cranberries-dolores-oriordan/", "page_content": "Photo: Patrick Ford/Redferns\n\nThe world was shocked, saddened, and caught off-guard by the sudden death of Dolores O\u2019Riordan, on January 15, 2018. As lead singer of The Cranberries, the iconic County Limerick-born vocalist was an adventurous and truly singular talent fronting a band who weren\u2019t just one of the great alt-rock acts of the 90s, but an outfit for whom longevity has long been guaranteed.\n\nThat O\u2019Riordan\u2019s untimely death robbed the music world of one its most distinctive voices is undeniable, but the extensive body of work she and her bandmates bequeathed will proudly live on. On their own, the statistics (which inform us that The Cranberries\u2019 seven studio albums have collectively sold over 40 million copies) demand respect, but it\u2019s the rich, bold and diverse content of these seven discs that continues to beguile fans old and new.\n\nListen to the best of The Cranberries on Apple Music and Spotify.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe group achieved stratospheric success, but in time-honored rock\u2019n\u2019roll tradition, The Cranberries came from the humblest of beginnings. Formed by guitarist Mike Hogan, his bassist brother Noel and drummer Fergal Lawlor, in their native Limerick, during 1989, the classic Cranberries line-up only fell into place when budding vocalist/lyricist Dolores O\u2019Riordan was recruited a year later.\n\nTheir initial dues-paying done on the UK and Irish indie circuits, the band\u2019s first break came when Rough Trade label boss Geoff Travis took over their management. With help from Travis and further endorsement from key industry figures such as BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel and 2FM\u2019s Dave Fanning, in Dublin, The Cranberries signed to Island and cut their much-acclaimed debut album, 1993\u2019s Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We?.\n\nThe question posed by the album\u2019s title seemed moot at a time when grunge and alt-rock was on the rise, but the quality of The Cranberries\u2019 debut soon set them apart from the pack. The fiery Celtic soul inherent in O\u2019Riordan\u2019s dextrous vocal delivery ensured that she garnered the lion\u2019s share of the plaudits, but the whole band weighed in with consummate performances, and while the record\u2019s breakthrough hits \u201cDreams\u201d and the melancholic break-up song \u201cLinger\u201d have since defined Everybody Else\u2026, its tracklist also concealed treasures such as \u201cPretty\u201d and the gorgeous, chiming \u201cWaltzing Back.\u201d\n\nThe Cranberries - Linger\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nInitially a slow-burner, Everybody\u2019s Doing It\u2026 caught light after the transatlantic success of \u201cDreams\u201d and \u201cLinger,\u201d eventually going quintuple-Platinum in the US alone. It barely prepared the band for the runaway success of their second LP, however, the Stephen Street-produced No Need To Argue, which moved 17 million copies worldwide.\n\nThough spawning four UK Top 40 hits, No Need To Argue found The Cranberries stretching sonically. The album\u2019s trailer single, the churning, grunge-inflected \u201cZombie,\u201d was an outspoken protest song concerning the deaths of two young children in an IRA bombing, while the record also spawned introspective fare such as the uileann pipes-enhanced \u201cDaffodil\u2019s Lament\u201d and the evocative \u201cOde To My Family\u201d \u2013 the latter provoking one of O\u2019Riordan\u2019s most affecting vocals.\n\nThe Cranberries - Zombie (Official Music Video)\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nRiding the crest of a wave, The Cranberries\u2019 third album, To The Faithful Departed, was a muscular, arena-sized rock record which featured several of the band\u2019s signature hits, among them \u201cSalvation\u201d and the upbeat, radio-friendly \u201cWhen You\u2019re Gone.\u201d Riding high on the charts, it eventually peaked at No.2 in the UK and at No.4 on the Billboard 200, en route to going double-platinum.\n\nRelishing the changing trends in the post-Britpop world, The Cranberries enjoyed further success with 1999\u2019s Bury The Hatchet and 2001\u2019s Wake Up And Smell The Coffee. The former spawned strident UK Top 20 hit \u201cPromises\u201d though several of its stand-out tracks, including the wistful, acoustic \u201cJust My Imagination\u201d and \u201cAnimal Instinct\u201c (O\u2019Riordan\u2019s ode to becoming a mother for the first time) harked back to the dreamy indie-pop sound that originally made these Limerick stalwarts\u2019 names.\n\nProduced by a returning Stephen Street, Wake Up And Smell The Coffee arguably remains the dark horse of The Cranberries\u2019 catalog, housing two finely-wrought, if often overlooked singles, \u201cAnalyse\u201d and the environmentally-conscious \u201cTime Is Ticking Out.\u201d In the album\u2019s wake, The Cranberries then went on hiatus, though a reunion in 2009 led to an ambitious comeback album, Roses, in 2012.\n\nThe Cranberries - Analyse (Official Music Video)\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nProffering their most eclectic set of songs, the Stephen Street-helmed Roses took in everything from the loops and electronica framing \u201cFire And Soul\u201d to the reggae-flavored \u201cRaining In My Heart,\u201d along with plenty of the band\u2019s patented, Celtic-flavoured dream-pop on \u201cTomorrow\u2019 and the blissful \u201cAstral Projection.\u201d\n\nNot a new studio album as such, 2017\u2019s Something Else found The Cranberries recasting ten of their key hits in orchestral and/or \u201cunplugged\u201d-style acoustic settings akin to Tori Amos\u2019 Gold Dust. Issued in April 2017, it showcases the richness and maturity inherent in Dolores O\u2019Riordan\u2019s voice, and while it wasn\u2019t intended as a swansong, Something Else adds a graceful, dignified full stop to a highly covetable artistic legacy.\n\nOutside of The Cranberries, Dolores O\u2019Riordan also recorded two solo albums, Are You Listening? (2007) and 2009\u2019s No Baggage, and collaborated with artists renowned for their maverick approach, among them Zucchero, Jah Wobble and \u2013 more recently \u2013 DARK: a New York-based project also featuring The Smiths\u2019 former bassist, Andy Rourke. That public figures ranging from politicians to Irish President Michael D Higgins are mourning O\u2019Riordan\u2019s passing, and critics cite the debts the likes of Adele and Florence Welch owe her, all proves how deeply she\u2019s left her mark on popular culture.\n\nLooking for more?

However, that preconception was swiftly turned on its head by \u201cZombie,\u201d the furious anti-terrorism lament with which the rising Irish stars trailed their second album, 1994\u2019s No Need To Argue.\n\nThe Cranberries - Zombie (Official Music Video)\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of bombs going off\u201d\n\n\u201cZombie\u201d\u2018s genesis is traceable to March 20, 1993, when two bombs, planted by the Irish Republican Army, exploded in the northern English town of Warrington. The blast from the second bomb injured dozens of people, but most cruelly claimed the lives of three-year-old Jonathan Ball and 12-year-old Tim Parry: a twin tragedy that shocked and appalled both the UK and Irish public.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI remember at the time there were a lot of bombs going off in England and The Troubles were pretty bad,\u201d singer Dolores O\u2019 Riordan said in a 2017 Classic Rock interview. \u201cI remember being on tour and in the UK at the time\u2026 and just being really sad about it.\u201d\n\nDeeply affected by the tragedy, O\u2019Riordan began working on a song that reflected upon the event. However, unlike many Cranberries tracks that sprang from group collaboration, the formative \u2018Zombie\u2019 was composed alone by O\u2019 Riordan during downtime from her band\u2019s punishing tour schedule.\n\n\u201cThe most aggressive song we\u2019d written\u201d\n\n\u201cI wrote it initially on an acoustic guitar, late at night,\u201d she told Classic Rock. \u201cI remember being in my flat, coming up with the chorus, which was catchy and anthemic. I took it into rehearsals and picked up the electric guitar and kicked in distortion on the chorus. Even though it was written on an acoustic, it became a bit of a rocker. \u2018Zombie\u2019 was quite different to what we\u2019d done before. It was the most aggressive song we\u2019d written.\u201d\n\nRecorded in Dublin with producer Stephen Street manning the console, \u201cZombie\u201d featured pounding drums and churning guitars, representing a radical departure from The Cranberries\u2019 signature sound. However, as Dolores O\u2019 Riordan later revealed, the song\u2019s beefed-up alt.rock sound wasn\u2019t an attempt to jump on the grunge bandwagon.\n\n\u201cIt came organically, because we were using our live instruments \u2013 we were plugging in a lot and we started to mess around with feedback and distortion,\u201d she told Classic Rock. In a 2012 interview with Holland\u2019s Face Culture magazine, guitarist Noel Hogan explained that \u201cthe heavier sound was the right thing for the song. If it was soft, it wouldn\u2019t have had that impact. It would stand out in the live set because of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cA very human song\u201d\n\nReleased as No Need To Argue\u2019s lead single, on September 19, 1994, \u201cZombie\u201d was promoted with a powerful video that also made a significant impact. Directed by Samuel Bayer (also responsible for Nirvana\u2019s \u2018Smells Like Teen Spirit\u201d clip), the video was filmed in Belfast during The Troubles, using real-life footage. Dolores O\u2019Riordan memorably appeared covered in gold make-up in front of a cross, alongside a group of boys covered in silver make-up. Though banned by the BBC at the time, the clip has since become one of rock\u2019s most-watched music videos on YouTube, clocking up one billion views in April 2020, making The Cranberries the first Irish band to have a song reach that landmark.\n\nAt the time, O\u2019Riordan received criticism for \u201cZombie\u201d\u2018s hard-hitting lyrics (\u201cAnother head hangs lowly/A child is slowly taken\u201d), with some detractors suggesting she was taking sides in the Northern Irish conflict. However, as the singer pointedly observed in a 1994 interview with Vox magazine, the song was written entirely from a humanitarian point of view.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s Protestant or Catholic, I care about the fact that innocent people are being harmed,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what provoked me to write the song\u2026 It doesn\u2019t name terrorist groups or organizations. It doesn\u2019t take sides. It\u2019s a very human song.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer message applies to recent attacks\u201d\n\n\u2018Zombie\u2019\u2019s anti-terrorism stance struck a chord when it was first released, becoming a UK Top 20 hit and winning the Best Song award at the 1995 MTV Europe Music Awards. Perhaps more significantly, The Cranberries were later invited to perform \u2018Zombie\u2019 alongside Northern Irish political leaders John Hume and David Trimble at the ceremony for the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe song\u2019s anti-violence message continues to endure. During the 90s, Dolores O\u2019 Riordan dedicated it to citizens of Bosnia and Rwanda during live shows, while a recent BBC article reappraising the song\u2019s accomplishments observed that \u201cher message applies equally to recent attacks in Manchester, Paris and Egypt to name just three.\u201d\n\nArtists from right across the musical spectrum have also paid tribute to \u201cZombie.\u201d Eminem sampled it on his popular \u201cIn Your Head\u201d single, while US metal outfit Bad Wolves recorded an emotive version of the track, which O\u2019Riordan had agreed to contribute to prior to her death in January 2018.\n\nIn Your Head\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n\u201cWhen you listen to Dolores\u2019 recordings, there is a wall of emotional vulnerability, intensity, and honesty. That transcends all genres,\u201d Bad Wolves\u2019 Tommy Vext told The Irish Times in 2018. \u201cFor me, that is inspiring. That is something that every vocalist and artist should strive for, something honest and raw and real. She masterfully did that. People still love \u2018Zombie.\u2019 It shows how masterful her craft was. It stands the test of time.\u201d\n\nListen to the best of The Cranberries on Apple Music and Spotify."}, {"url": "https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-cranberries-everybody-else-is-doing-it-so-why-cant-we/", "page_content": "One Sunday afternoon in 1990, Dolores O\u2019Riordan lugged her keyboard across Limerick, Ireland, for an audition. The 18-year-old only knew a few details about the rock band she would potentially be joining: They only wanted to play original songs and they were punnily named the Cranberry Saw Us (say it out loud).\n\nFor their part, the Cranberry Saw Us had not formed much of an identity beyond these details. The trio\u2014drummer Fergal Lawler, guitarist Noel Hogan, and his bassist brother Mike\u2014had grown up together in Limerick. As teens, they shared a love of breakdancing\u2014Ireland had a robust breakdancing scene\u2014and a fondness for the Smiths. The three had formed the Cranberry Saw Us about a year earlier but since their fourth member and frontman had departed, the band had been adrift. They had been searching for a female lead singer for months, but now that a slight, mousey candidate actually stood in front of them, they didn\u2019t know what to make of her. However, when O\u2019Riordan began to sing\u2014her audition consisted of a few original tunes and a rendition of Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u201cTroy\u201d\u2014there was no question that they had found their new vocalist.\n\nO\u2019Riordan grew up about 10 miles outside Limerick in the rural townland of Ballybricken. The youngest of seven children, and one of two girls, O\u2019Riordan learned early on that her voice would set herself apart: She was the precocious student that was asked to sing in Gaelic in front of the class, the tiny niece uncles brought around local pubs to entertain sloshed patrons. On her first day of secondary school, O\u2019Riordan declared that she was going to be a rockstar before launching into a Patsy Cline song. She would go on to sing with a school choir that would frequently sweep the boards at Slogadh, an Irish youth arts festival. A devout Catholic, O\u2019Riordan would later credit the church where she played the organ as the place that helped her envision music as a potential career. In 1992, she contextualized her band\u2019s success as a kind of religious karma: \u201cI could be just superstitious, but I think what\u2019s happening now is a kind of a reward.\u201d\n\nAfter the audition, as O\u2019Riordan headed out the door, the band handed her a tape with a loose sketch of a song\u2014maybe she could think of some lyrics? The track consisted of four simple chords but, as O\u2019Riordan remarked a few years later, \u201cI took them home and I just wrote about me.\u201d One week later she returned with a song that would change the foursome\u2019s lives. Inspired by O\u2019Riordan\u2019s first kiss and the swift sting of rejection, \u201cLinger\u201d condenses every stage of heartache into four-and-a-half minutes of pop perfection with a few humble tools: an acoustic guitar riff, O\u2019Riordan\u2019s wistful humming, Lawler\u2019s rolling drumbeat, and swooning orchestrals that aim for visions of grandeur far beyond the cheap synthesizer that produced them. The problem, as O\u2019Riordan tells it, is that she gave her heart to someone, they stomped on it, and now she\u2019s left holding the pieces. \u201cBut I\u2019m in so deep/You know I\u2019m such a fool for you/You got me wrapped around your finger,\u201d she sings, her Irish brogue warming the edges of every syllable. All she wants is a little compassion moving forward: \u201cDo you have to let it linger?\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/the-cranberries-everyone-else-is-doing-it-so-why-can-t-we-still-spellbinding-after-all-these-years-1.3665515", "page_content": "Everyone Else is Doing It, So Why Can't We? - 25th Anniversary Edition \ue9d9 \ue9d9 \ue9d9 \ue9d9 \ue9d7 Artist : The Cranberries Genre : Rock Label : Island\n\nIn 1993, Albert Reynolds was elected taoiseach, the beef tribunal finally ended after a gruelling 226 days, Niamh Kavanagh won yet another Eurovision, and a Fianna F\u00e1il and Labour administration decriminalised homosexuality. U2 released Zooropa and brought another mammoth tour production to the RDS, while a Limerick band called The Cranberries quietly put out their debut album. It topped the UK and Irish charts, and stealthily progressed to became a slow-burning, world-conquering phenomenon. By the end of 1995, Everyone Else is Doing It, So Why Can't We? had sold five million copies in the US alone.\n\nOf course, things really should be so much different for this release. A quarter of a century under the bridge later, and instead of embarking on a victory lap for its anniversary and priming new material, Dolores O'Riordan is dead. In addition to compiling this box set and unveiling an unreleased song in Irish entitled \u00cdosa, the remaining Cranberries are completing an album featuring vocals from O'Riordan to be released next year.\n\nWritten entirely by O'Riordan and guitarist Noel Hogan, and produced by Stephen Street, Everyone Else is Doing It, So Why Can't We? offered a very distinctly Irish take on guitar-based indie pop in the early 1990s. It inspired a contemporary Californian band called Deafheaven to write a song called The Pecan Tree, which closed their Sunbather album and helped make them become modern metal sensations.\n\nThe Cranberries' influence on modern music still extends far beyond pop and indie rock, and we continue to underestimate just how huge and influential they were in the US.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nCloser to home, they were session darlings for two of the most important tastemakers on these islands, John Peel and Dave Fanning. Pristine versions of Linger, Dreams, and a few others from their respective shows are included. Peel and Fanning were where many Irish and British listeners first heard The Cranberries, but their success greatly eclipsed this early exposure.\n\nTheir very first recordings under the brutal moniker The Cranberry Saw Us are included, and a wealth of outtakes and early EP tracks. The Cranberries revisited this era before in 2002 for the release of Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? \u2013 The Complete Sessions 1991\u20131993, but this feels much more definitive.\n\nO'Riordan's album title was also a ballsy statement of intent: why shouldn't a band from Limerick take on the world rather than tip away playing covers at weddings? \"Elvis wasn't always Elvis,\" O'Riordan said. \"He became Elvis. As did Michael Jackson and so forth. I thought we were born in a random place, and why shouldn't we be successful as well?\"\n\nThe Cranberries: Mike Hogan, Dolores O'Riordan, Fergal Lawler and Noel Hogan\n\nThey paved the way for Limerick musicians to be taken seriously. By 2018, the Treaty City has spawned bands as singular and unique as Rusangano Family and The Rubberbandits, plus numerous others.\n\nEveryone Else is Doing It, So Why Can't We? captured a fledgling band at their best, refreshingly free of the bombast, bluster and harshness of some of their later work, and weaving soft and subtle sonic spells. Of course, The Cranberries achieved so much more after their debut, with No Need to Argue in 1994 selling millions more copies.\n\nThis re-release serves as a timely and tragic reminder that for all the acclaim about Stephen Street's production and Noel Hogan's fretwork, their unique selling point was always O'Riordan's unmistakable yodel. Everyone Else is Doing It, So Why Can't We? remains a remarkable debut album. Dolores O'Riordan is dead.

At just 19, the short-haired girl with leather pants and a sweet smile presented the band with what would become one of their biggest hits.\n\nLinger is the story of O'Riordan's first love, a young soldier shipped away to Lebanon who stole her a kiss and then moved on.\n\n:: Cranberries singer planned to re-record Zombie the day after her death\n\nImage: Dolores O'Riordan in 1995\n\nShe would later recall to the Irish Times how she wished \"the moment would linger\", but was disappointed when, on the next night out, she found he had fallen for another girl.\n\nIt is a sweet and innocent story, something which you would expect to hear from a pre-pubescent pop star today.
