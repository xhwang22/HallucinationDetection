Over time the age gap became more palpable and stirred her documentarian\u2019s impulse to freeze time. Part love letter (that occasionally borders on too intimate) and part artist portrait, Kleine\u2019s documentary, \u201cAndr\u00e9 Gregory: Before and After Dinner,\u201d opens today at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and runs through Aug. 9. Kleine and Gregory will be present at tonight\u2019s 7:30 screening to answer questions.\n\nFrom \"Andr\u00e9 Gregory: Before And After Dinner.\" (Courtesy, Cinema Guild)\n\nKleine, who narrates, sets a convivial pace and tone, best illustrated during a scene when she catalogs the 18 boyfriends who preceded Gregory. Photographs of each man flips by as Kleine lists, \u201cJonathan, Rob, Fernando, Rob ...\u201d How did she manage such thorough record-keeping pre-Instagram? And so few clothes!\n\nKleine studied filmmaking at The Museum School and at MIT under Richard Leacock, who knew a thing or two about personal documentaries. Her last documentary, \u201cPhyllis and Harold,\u201d held a microscope to her parents\u2019 59-year marriage. (It premiered in Boston as part of the Boston Jewish Film Festival and this run is also co-presented by BJFF.)\n\nHere, the marriage is unquestionably strong. Kleine pokes fun at Gregory\u2019s close friendship and life-long collaboration with actor/writer Wallace Shawn, who appears frequently in \u201cBefore and After Dinner\u201d and was his foil in \u201cMy Dinner With Andr\u00e9.\u201d And Gregory calls this friendship his \u201csecond marriage,\u201d but it\u2019s lighthearted. Kleine is yang to Gregory\u2019s yin. In his youth he was never hugged, he says. In her family, \u201cfighting was the primary means of communication and everyone talked at once.\u201d\n\nKleine steps into the background and devotes the second part of the film to Gregory, with fascinating footage from his formative days in experimental theater (the Richard Avedon stills from \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u201d are a knock-out) and a peppering of Gregory\u2019s theatrical wisdom and anecdotes told to wide-eyed, nodding listeners.\n\nIn one scene Gregory spins a delicate yarn about his first kiss, which just happened to take place in a moonlit, Marblehead, Mass. cemetery. His knees buckled and he fainted. In another, he recalls a moment of hysterical blindness.\n\nThough both are Jewish, Gregory\u2019s parents maintained a severely tight lip in this regard and the nature of his father\u2019s relationship to the highest ranks of Nazi leadership continues to plague him and occupies a major thread of this film. Yet, as compelling as it to delve into the underpinnings of Gregory\u2019s artistic drive, which he attributes to his terrifying father, the most gripping moments come while he\u2019s directing Ibsen\u2019s \u201cThe Master Builder\u201d in his living room.\n\nWhat sets him apart as director, we learn, is his willingness to take the time that a production needs \u2014 he rehearsed \u201cThe Master Builder\u201d for 14 years, for example. His obsession with \"Uncle Vanya\" was documented in \"Vanya on 42nd Street\" by Louis Malle, who also filmed \"My Dinner with Andr\u00e9.\" Gregory also has an incorrigible trust in the actors he chooses. \u201cI never audition an actor I only interview them,\u201d he says.\n\nThere\u2019s a discomfort at first with how long shots linger on Gregory\u2019s intense, piercing gaze while actors deliver their lines off camera. An hour or so into this film, convinced of his portrait as a bottomless well of artistic chutzpah and encouragement, we are desperate to watch only his reactions. The act of directing, or life itself, is manifest in every line of his face.\n\nErin Trahan edits the online film magazine The Independent and moderates the current season of The DocYard. you can reach her at erin@erintrahan.net."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Cindy-Kleine", "page_content": "Cindy Kleine is an American film director, producer and video artist.\n\nShe grew up on Long Island.

Often engaging themes of feminism, image, subjugation, and superficiality, Sherman continues to be sought after as a voice of critique in a media-based world. She is considered a member of the \u201cPictures Generation\u201d of American artists, who came to prominence in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nEarly Life and Family\n\nCindy Sherman was born Cynthia Morris Sherman on January 19, 1954 in New Jersey. She grew up on Long Island and was the youngest of five children. Because the sibling closest to her age was nine years her senior, Sherman felt like an only child, sometimes forgotten in the midst of so many others in her family. Sherman has said that, as a result of her family dynamic, she sought attention in any way possible. From a very young age, Sherman donned alternate personas with the assistance of her extensive costume wardrome.\n\nShe describes her mother as kind-hearted and \u201cgood,\u201d though primarily concerned that her children make the right impression (something which tempted the young Sherman to rebel). She has described her father as mean-spirited and closed minded. Sherman's family life was not happy, and when Sherman was 15 years old, her elder brother committed suicide. This trauma had repercussions for Sherman\u2019s personal life, and she cites it as the reason she ended up in several long-term relationships she did not want to be in, believing she could help other men where she could not help her brother. She was married to the video artist Michel Auder for 17 years in the 1980s and 90s, a marriage which ended in divorce.\n\nBeginnings as an Artist\n\nSherman studied art at Buffalo State College. After graduating, she moved to New York City with artist Robert Longo, who was a fellow art student and Buffalo State graduate.\n\nIn the 1970s, New York's streets were gritty and sometimes unsafe. In response, Sherman developed attitudes and attires that acted as coping mechanisms for the discomforts she would meet on her way home\u2014an extension of her childhood habit of dress-up. Though she found it upsetting and uncomfortable, Sherman ultimately saw New York as a place of reinvention. She began to show up to social occasions in costume, and eventually Longo convinced Sherman to begin photographing her characters. These were the beginnings from which the Untitled Stills were born, most of which were photographed in or around the apartment the two shared.\n\nIn many ways, the rebellious spirit instilled in Sherman as a child never left her. For example, as her work was gaining popularity in the 1980s, the artist took a turn towards the grotesque, creating work that featured various bodily fluids spilled and smeared within the frame, as a way to challenge the art world\u2019s perception of her as salable and appropriate to \u201chang above a dining room table.\u201d\n\nIn the 1990s, the National Endowment for the Arts withdrew its funding from \u201ccontroversial\u201d projects. As an act of protest against what she perceived to be a form of censorship, Sherman began to photograph outrageous portraits of genitals, using plastic hospital dummies and mannequins common to medical school classrooms. This type of subversion continues to define Sherman\u2019s career.\n\nUntitled Film Stills\n\nSherman works in series of photographs in which she builds off a theme that addresses a social issue. Her subjects have been wide-ranging as what it means to age as a woman, the subjugating effect of the male gaze on the female form, and the contorting effects of social media on self-image. Within each series, Sherman acts as the model, costumer, make-up artist, and set designer.\n\nThe \u201cUntitled Film Stills\u201d (1977-1980) are arguably Sherman\u2019s most famous works. These images, all in black and white, evoke key moments in Hollywood cinema. Though the \u201cfilms\u201d from which these photographs were taken do not exist, their appeal lies in the fact that they evoke moods played out ceaselessly in popular movies, thus causing the viewer to sense that he or she has seen the film before.\n\nCindy Sherman, Untitled Film Still #17 (1978). tate.org\n\nThe tropes portrayed by Sherman include the young ingenue, dominated by the city, who gazes off in fear at an unknown person or object out of frame, and the outcast, standing among detritus and ruins, waiting for someone to arrive. Often, these images contain within them a threat and a feeling that nothing good can come of these situations. By inserting discomfort into images of women, Sherman asks the viewer to consider the subject and understand her vulnerability.\n\nCenterfolds and Later Work\n\nIn the early 80s came the \u201cCenterfolds,\u201d a series of double-width images intended to mimic the typically seductive and alluring poses of models placed at the center of adult magazines. Sherman turned the concept of a centerfold on its head by using the format to depict women who had endured physical abuse. The images hold the viewer accountable for approaching the works as if they were designed to please\u2014 in Sherman's words, they are a \u201cthwarted expectation.\"\n\nCindy Sherman, Untitled #92 (1981). Centerfolds series. christies.org\n\nIn 2017, Sherman made public her personal Instagram account, which serves as an extension of her practice. Sherman employs the tools of digital airbrushing\u2014intended to falsely alter images of the human face to achieve the tool of flawlessness\u2014and instead pushes these contortions to an extreme. Using applications intended to improve images, Sherman exaggerates features, thus drawing attention to the fine line between inhuman perfection (the type that only social media is capable of showing) and inhuman, almost alien-like alteration. In line with her popularity in the more traditional art world, Sherman's account (@cindysherman) has garnered hundreds of thousands of followers.\n\nAwards and Accolades\n\nCindy Sherman is a widely honored artist. She has received both a MacArthur Genius Grant and a Guggenheim Fellowship. She is an honorary member of the Royal Academy, and has been represented in numerous biennials across the world.\n\nSherman continues to be an important voice not only in contemporary art, but also in the media age. Her biting critique gets at the core of an issue and hyper-focuses on it through the poignant and intimate medium of portraiture. She lives in New York with her parrot, Frida, and is represented by Metro Pictures Gallery.\n\nSources"}, {"url": "https://www.owlapps.net/owlapps_apps/articles?id=39287348&lang=en", "page_content": "Cindy Kleine is an American film director, producer and video artist.\n\nShe grew up on Long Island.

While father Harold remains a dark and shadowy figure, mother Phyllis is eventually painstakingly and fully fleshed out. The deeper focus and graphic details, which reveal the subtle and sometimes secret aspects of her mother's life, could not be revealed until Harold passed away in 2003. And, I won't spoil the accruing dramatic suspense by being too specific here. Suffice it to say, its impact is powerful and poignant.\n\nThe feelings the film evokes remind one of a first reading of Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique in which essential aspects of one's own mother or grandmother were given credence and revealed as never before. Phyllis and Harold is the perfect companion piece to Friedan's seminal work on the quiet plight of suburban women in the 1940s and 50s, proving once again that life was anything but pure and simple way back when.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Friedan's book, Cindy Kleine's film has captured something quietly but essentially tragic about many American women who were born in the 1920s and 30s. While this film is a very individual and unique unfolding of Klein's mother Phyllis' deeply complicated, lifelong dilemma, it also strikes notes of universality many will recognize as they recall the lives of the women from the WWII generation in their own families. In choosing duty and loyalty over satisfaction and a greater sense of freedom, these women stayed home, remained trapped, and suffered in silence.\n\nBut a mother's deep unhappiness and yearning for something missing (or in Phyllis' case someone who is missing) -- even when veiled by middle-class props such as a killer wardrobe, a tastefully decorated home, a pool in the back yard, and trips abroad -- seldom go unnoticed by her own children. It's striking to hear Harold recall the story of their 59-year marriage and compare it with Phyllis' recollections and those of her two sensitive and observant daughters.\n\nPhyllis' story is a heartbreaker, but so too is the effect it had on Cindy Kleine and her sister who are also interviewed. They worshipped their mother even though most of the time she was only half there. Kleine's extraordinary empathy and insight into her mother as well as her early exposure to photography which developed her visual sensibilities thanks to her father are the some of the elements that make this film so effective and ring so true. Ironically, the film -- unlike Phyllis' real life -- allows her ultimately to be revealed a whole human being.\n\nPhyllis and Harold. directed, produced, and written by Cindy Kleine. Opens in NYC on February 19, 2010. Limited release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActress Jean Simmons: Leading Lady in Her Final Film\n\nBorn nine years after Phyllis, the actress Jean Simmons shares some things in common with her. Simmons' career flourished through almost three decades before it began to wane in the late 1960s. Her second husband, film director Richard Brooks, sensed this frustration as well as problems with alcohol use and the effects of the increasing invisibility of middle age and an unhappy marriage. He created the film The Happy Ending especially for her. Released in an important and transitional year in Hollywood--1969--it was far from a perfect movie, but Jean Simmons made the most of a role that paralleled her life so closely and was nominated--a second time--for an Academy Award. It's another film that tries to make sense of Friedan's feminine mystique--that awful, nagging sense that something in life is missing.\n\n\n\nJean Simmons (1929-2010).\n\nSimmons always made wildly interesting if not important movies -- whether theatrically released or for television -- in almost every decade following her film debut in 1944 at the age of 15. 1940s: Great Expectations, Hamlet; 1950s: Young Bess, The Actress, Until They Sail; 1960s: Elmer Gantry, Spartacus ;1970s: Mr. Sycamore, Dominique, The Eastern Promise; 1980s: December Flowers, The Thornbirds, (television remake) Great Expectations; 1990s: How to Make an American Quilt.\n\nShe was luminous in black and white as well as Technicolor and shined brightly in quirky, contemporary dramas (Mister Buddwing, 1966) as well as in lavish, period pieces (The Robe, 1953). She even bridged the gap to musicals starring with Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra in Guys and Dolls (1955) and unlike her contemporaries Audrey Hepburn, Deborah Kerr, and Natalie Wood her singing voice was not dubbed by Marnie Nixon.\n\nHer final decade included a wide variety of work: serving as narrator of PBS's American Masters series' documentary on legendary Hollywood director George Cukor (On Cukor); playing Countess Lucinda Rhives in Winter Solstice alongside Geraldine Chaplin and Peter Ustinov; and in the English version of the critically acclaimed animated feature Howl's Moving Castle, she teamed up with Lauren Bacall, Christian Bale, Blythe Danner, and Emily Mortimer lending their voices to Hayao Miyakazi's rich characters in which Simmons played Grandma Sophie to great effect.\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Moore", "page_content": "Michael Moore, in full Michael Francis Moore, (born April 23, 1954, Flint, Michigan, U.S.), American filmmaker, author, and political activist, who was best known for a series of documentaries\u2014often controversial\u2014that addressed major political and social issues in the United States.\n\nFollowing his graduation from high school, Moore, as an 18-year-old member of the Flint school board, began his populist assault on what he viewed as the injustices of American capitalism. In 1976, after having attended but not graduated from the University of Michigan at Flint, Moore started a radical weekly newspaper, the Flint Voice (later Michigan Voice), which he edited for 10 years. He was later hired to edit the San Francisco-based left-wing magazine Mother Jones but was fired after a few months (he later accepted an out-of-court settlement for a wrongful-dismissal suit).\n\nBritannica Quiz Oscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nReturning to Flint, Moore filmed his first documentary, Roger & Me (1989), which chronicles the effects of unemployment in Flint due to the closing of two General Motors (GM) factories and the company\u2019s longer-term policy of downsizing. At the centre of the film were Moore\u2019s \u201cin-your-face\u201d efforts to gain an audience with GM\u2019s chairman, Roger Smith. Mixing humour and poignancy with indignation, Roger & Me was a hit with critics and at the box office. Moore subsequently moved to New York City and established Dog Eat Dog Films. He also created an organization to finance social-action groups and other filmmakers.\n\nAfter producing three television series and other limited-release films\u2014including the comedy Canadian Bacon (1995), in which a U.S. president starts a cold war with Canada in order to boost his approval ratings\u2014Moore achieved major success with Bowling for Columbine (2002). The film, which profiles gun violence in the United States, won the Academy Award for best documentary. In his next documentary, Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004), Moore criticized U.S. Pres. George W. Bush\u2019s handling of the September 11 attacks and the administration\u2019s decision to start the Iraq War. Although highly controversial, it won the Golden Palm at the Cannes film festival and earned more than $222 million worldwide to become the highest-grossing documentary.\n\nIn 2007 Moore released Sicko, an examination of the health care industry in the United States. For his next documentary, Capitalism: A Love Story (2009), Moore took a critical look at the U.S. economy, including the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007\u201308 and the subsequent bailout of banks. Where to Invade Next (2015) unfavourably compared various aspects of daily life in other countries\u2014such as educational practices and the balance between work and leisure\u2014with those in the United States. Moore\u2019s live stage performance about the 2016 presidential election\u2014filmed prior to Donald Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton\u2014was the basis for Michael Moore in TrumpLand (2016). In 2017 Moore made his Broadway debut in the one-man show The Terms of My Surrender, which examined the Trump presidency. The following year he considered the 2016 presidential election and the unexpected rise of Trump in the documentary Fahrenheit 11/9. The movie especially takes to task the policies of Michigan Gov.
