{"Dawn Landes collaborated with Sufjan Stevens.": [{"url": "https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/dawn-landes/dawn-landes-meet-me-at-the-river-review", "page_content": "As someone whose past musical collaborations have included Sufjan Stevens, Norah Jones and Bon Iver, a straight-ahead, retro-country sound would appear to be an interesting turn for TED-talk giving, Brooklyn-living, Dawn Landes. But Kentucky roots, a move from her longtime home of New York to Nashville and the impressive coup of luring Country Music Hall of Fame producer Fred Foster (Dolly Parton, Merle Haggard, Kris Kristofferson) out of retirement give some bonafide credo to Landes\u2019 fifth LP, Meet Me At The River.\n\nEven with Foster at the helm and an impressive line-up of veteran country session men, the more eclectic pockets of Landes sound comes through on the opening cuts. \u201cMeet Me At The River\u201d is more folk-country with its ambling, pastoral quality, before \u201cTraveling\u201d eases us into what\u2019s to come. Even with slightly eye-roll lyrics like \u201cI\u2019m not looking for a pot of gold / Not needing a hand to hold,\u201d the introduction of the familiar country soundscape\u2014twangy pedal steel and production infused with all the warmth of southern hospitality\u2014carries Landes through.\n\nShe has a clear, bright and gentle voice\u2014that classic country, bluebird tone\u2014which lilts delicately over the music, even when she\u2019s delivering a heartier tune like \u201cWhy They Name Whiskey After Men.\u201d A jaunty, achy-breaky-type tune delivered with a wink and a stiff pour, lines like \u201cComes on strong and keeps you warm / Before it starts to do you in,\u201d transporting you to a friendly, 70s honky-tonk.\n\nIt\u2019s here that things take a dip. \u201cOld Memories\u201d is a semi-forgettable ballad, and \u201cWind and Rain\u201d for all it\u2019s heart is a song for Nashville moms in nice SUVS\u2014soothing, not unpleasant, but nothing exceptional here. It\u2019s not until \u201cSouthern Girl\u201d (though it\u2019s all about troublesome, Southern men) that Landes wins your attention back with some of her best writing. \u201cBad boys / handsome as sin / Think I gotta stay away / Lord please / Send me a man / Who\u2019s not too proud to pray,\u201d she sings over a stomping rhythm, sound doubtful as she adds, \u201cDo you still make them that way?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Church\u201d and \u201cWhat Is The Color Of The Soul Of Man\u201d round out the album with some political conscience. The first, a very kumbaya, all-inclusive, love-your-neighbor country-waltz that sounds exactly like what some forward-thinking countrypolitan who heard his first Bob Dylan tune would write back in the late \u201860s. The second is the only track of the album with some real fire behind it, the vengeful strings and hard-drive backing up the song\u2019s anti-prejudice message.\n\n\u201cI Don\u2019t Dance,\u201d a track featuring vocals from octogenarian country legend Bobby Bare, attempts to end things on a charming and light-hearted note, but winds up sound forced and silly. A fitting end to what proves to be an uneven album. While Landes\u2019 is lovely at best and boring at worst, the real disappointment here is the excitement caused by Foster\u2019s production work, which, sadly, doesn\u2019t quite deliver.\n\nWatch Dawn Landes\u2019 2018 Paste studio session below:"}, {"url": "https://www.sagamusic.com/artists/dawn-landes/", "page_content": "Dawn Landes (born December 5, 1980) is an American singer-songwriter and musician.

Initially, she was concerned that it might feel like \u201can invasion of privacy, but I think he was delighted by it, and didn\u2019t say \u2018No\u2019 outright! I think his exact words were, \u2018send me some music and I\u2019ll see if there\u2019s something I can contribute, which was his way of saying \u2018maybe\u2019,\u201d Dawn recalls.\n\n\u201cIt took a lot of phone calls and snail mail and even driving. I was living in New York at the time [Landes has since re-located to Nashville] and had to drive the 14 hours to Nashville...and that must have impressed him.\u201d\n\nThey duly spent hours in Foster\u2019s Tennessee home; listening to Hank Williams and trading stories as Landes showed off heart-wrenching vocals and expressive songwriting. Foster's semi-retirement was at an end.\n\nLandes arrived for the recording sessions with a set of what she considered to be complete songs. Not so, according to Mr Foster. \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018That one has potential\u2019; \u2018this is a possibility\u2019,\u201d she recalls.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it, and the only other time that something like this happened was when I showed people my lyrics before recording them, and that was when I was at college and every Monday at the Fast Folk songwriters\u2019 exchange everyone would read the Iyrics while I sang the song.\n\n\u201cThat was a vulnerable feeling, but I did that when I was 20, at the Fast Folk gatherings at Jack Hardy\u2019s house in Greenwich Village, so that was a good experience to call on.\n\n\"I made sure not to talk politics,\" says Dawn Landes, recalling her recording sessions with legendary producer Fred Foster\n\n\u201cIt was in the era ten years after Dylan. Townes Van Zandt, Suzanne Vega, passed through Fast Folk, but by the time I did it, it had morphed into being at Jack\u2019s house.\u201d\n\nShe saw the opportunity to work with Foster as a learning experience. \u201cI learnt so much from him and his sense of judgement,\u201d says Dawn.\n\n\"He'd produced Dolly Parton's first album, but she was much younger than me, a teenager, when she made it, but I was also thinking about Joan Baez's album recorded with Fred in Nashville, working with some great Nashville musicians.\n\n\"He'd worked with her because she'd sung on Kris Kristofferson's recordings \u2013 though he didn't like her politics, so I made sure not to talk politics.\"\n\nBrought together largely by Kyle Lehning, Landes recorded Meet Me At River at the Sound Emporium studio with \"the heaviest hitters around\", as she called harmonica player Charlie McCoy, guitarist Steve Gibson, drummer Eddie Bayers, Elvis In Memphis guitarist Bobby Wood, steel guitr player Russ Pahl and bassist Larry Paxton.\n\n\"It was also Kyle's suggestion I should sing a duet [I Don't Dance] with Bobby Bare [the Ohio country singer, now aged 83], but you just had to mention Fred Foster and all these musicians were so excited to work with him again,\" says Dawn.\n\nAlong with her own songs on \"the big themes of life\", from heartbreak and wanderlust to reckoning with youth, she recorded two Jimmy Driftwood covers, The Church and What Is The Color Of The Soul Of Man, as recommended by Foster, who had produced Driftwood's records in the Sixties.\n\n\"Fred introduced me to a whole bunch of older music, mostly from the Monument label, including Jimmy's albums, and I just fell in love with his music,\" says Dawn. \"I think of him as a humanist, a very open soul to the human condition, very sympathetic.\"\n\nReflecting on the experience of recording with Foster, Dawn says: \"I just connected with him and he just seemed like a friend, like my first friend in Nashville, though we were never going to hang out!\"\n\nPlease Please You presents Dawn Landes at The Basement, City Screen, York, tomorrow night (October 16), supported by JF Robitaille & Lail Arad at 8pm.

The event was, he says, \u201ca horrifying Scientology end-of-year prom\u201d representative of \u201ceverything I hate about America and popular culture\u201d.\n\nHe had never paid much attention to them before being nominated in 2018. Mystery of Love \u2013 his bittersweet folk ballad, written for Luca Guadagnino\u2019s Call Me By Your Name \u2013 was up for best original song and Stevens had been invited to perform. His devoted fans celebrated this appearance as a moment of long-overdue mainstream recognition for the spotlight-shy then-42-year-old; 26 million viewers were watching at home, after all. But for the artist himself, shrinking into his pink-and-black striped blazer as Hollywood A-listers schmoozed around him, there was not much to celebrate. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with that world and that culture,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be part of any room full of adults hemming and hawing over plastic trophies.\u201d\n\nStevens has spent his career adjusting his work to help avoid such rooms. The Detroit-born composer is an indie household name, with St Vincent, Moses Sumney (both of whom joined him onstage at the Oscars) and the National among his peers. He has fans in hip-hop, too: Kendrick Lamar and Mac Miller have both sampled him, while in 2011, Donald Glover proclaimed himself \u201cthe only black kid at the Sufjan concert\u201d in a verse from Fire Fly telegraphing his sensitivity.\n\nFor your consideration \u2026 Stevens performs at the Oscars with St Vincent. Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP\n\nBut every time Stevens has edged too close to the precipice of mainstream success, he has reacted by releasing something challenging or fogged in darkness. After his 2003 breakthrough Michigan, full of bouncy chamber-pop, came an album of sparse folk meditations (2004\u2019s Seven Swans) themed to his Christian faith. When 2005\u2019s Illinois topped many publications\u2019 album-of-the-year lists, propelled by its anthemic single Chicago, he swerved again, releasing an avant-garde multimedia work about a graffiti-splattered highway (2009\u2019s The BQE) and a paranoid electronic opera (2010\u2019s The Age of Adz). \u201cIt\u2019s never a rebellious thing; I\u2019m always just ready to do something new,\u201d he says cheerily, sporting a salt-and-pepper beard of late, but with the same boyish, scout-leader good looks he emerged with for his woodsy, self-recorded 1999 debut A Sun Came. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be famous or sell millions of records. There\u2019s never a conversation with myself about how I\u2019m advancing my profile.\u201d\n\nStevens\u2019s latest and perhaps boldest work, The Ascension, is another exercise in changing direction after a brief flirtation with fame. His 2015 album Carrie and Lowell was a bare-bones exploration of grief, inspired by the death of his mother, and hailed as Stevens\u2019s greatest achievement yet. Rather than more of the same, its follow-up is a beautiful, scuffed electropop album that swaps Carrie and Lowell\u2019s introspection for outward-looking lyrics, grappling with an American culture he perceives as up in flames. \u201cI wanted to respond to changes in the political climate and changes in human engagement, influenced by the internet and technology,\u201d he says.\n\nOn The Ascension\u2019s lead single, America \u2013 pointedly released on Independence Day \u2013 Stevens sings solemnly: \u201cI\u2019m ashamed to admit I no longer believe.\u201d It is a far cry from the artist who once famously planned to write an album about every state in America \u2013 an intention later abandoned and written off as a joke. It was believable at the time because his songs frequently resembled celebrations of Americana, constantly invoking its landmarks and former leaders. Since then, his patriotism has become complicated by the advent of \u201cDonald Duck\u201d, as he occasionally calls the current occupant of the Oval Office. \u201cChrist would be ashamed of us all,\u201d he wrote on Tumblr in 2017, after Trump signed an executive order banning people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US. \u201cAmerica, there really is no such thing as an illegal immigrant,\u201d the letter continued. \u201cWe are all immigrants and refugees in a wildly changing world, dominated by superfluous boundaries built by blood and war.\u201d\n\nToday, his frustration is even greater, and his perspective somewhat broader: Trump is \u201ca symptom, not the problem\u201d whose presidency is evidence of a deep, foundational rot, he rages. \u201cRemember that ridiculous Hillary Clinton memoir that came out after she lost the [2016 election] race? It was called What Happened. What happened? Shit happened! For centuries and centuries, people were forcibly removed from one continent and shipped to another, where they were forced into free labour, for 400 years!\u201d\n\nExperience makes fools of us all \u2026 You start to lose faith in the structures of society as you get older Sufjan Stevens\n\nHe is not sure of the answers: \u201cI\u2019m not a politician or a civil servant or a scientist, I\u2019m just a songwriter.\u201d He is also unsure of how optimistic to be as November\u2019s crucial presidential election approaches: \u201cWhat gives me hope? Oh God. Diazepam! Lithium!\u201d But Stevens is certain that a Biden win \u201cwon\u2019t solve America\u2019s problems alone\u201d, and that the nation\u2019s ills, from police brutality to institutional racism, first require some uncomfortable conversations. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is many generations\u2019 worth of questions and answers that have stacked up. But we need to show up and do the work.\u201d\n\nThat desire is writ large across Stevens\u2019s recent output. In June 2019, the songwriter released Love Yourself, an EP of songs about \u201clove without conflict, anxiety or self-deprecation\u201d to mark 2019\u2019s Pride month, after decades of what has been interpreted as queer subtext in his songs. On Seven Swans\u2019 To Be Alone With You, Stevens detailed a man who \u201cgave up a wife and family \u2026 to be alone with me\u201d. A year later on the Illinois song The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades is Out to Get Us!, his narrator sang of a swim in a lake with a male friend, ending in a gay embrace.\n\nNow 45, Stevens has declined ever to discuss his romantic life publicly, nor this theme in his work, and it is possible these references are non-autobiographical. Regardless, he has amassed a large LGBTQ+ fanbase who celebrated that EP as his most pronounced acknowledgement of gay rights yet, at a time when those rights have been brought dangerously under threat.\n\nIt is this troubled state of the world \u2013 coupled with a sense of \u201chaving exorcised all my personal grief\u201d on Carrie and Lowell \u2013 that has given Stevens this new outlook. \u201cI have a sense of urgency I don\u2019t know I had before,\u201d he says, pointing to The Ascension\u2019s heavy use of declarations and imperatives. Where previously his lyrics were abstract and poetic, his new album is threaded with demands: \u201cRun away with me\u201d; \u201cMake me an offer I cannot refuse\u201d; \u201cDon\u2019t do to me what you did to America\u201d.\n\nThere is a line in America that feels especially poignant. \u201cI have traded my life for a picture of the scenery,\u201d he sings through sorrow, as if repenting for his previous positive mythologising of the US; he claims to feel \u201cdisassociated\u201d from his old music today. Does he feel he painted postcards of the US on those tracks, ignoring the darkness? A long sigh floats down the phone line. \u201cExperience makes fools of us all,\u201d he says. \u201cIn experiencing so much and growing older, I\u2019ve realised there was definitely a naivety to my former self. There was a hopefulness, joyfulness and playfulness to a lot of those early records that\u2019s been slowly receding over the years. It\u2019s hard for me to speak for it because it\u2019s happened so gradually, like watching a tree grow. But you start to lose faith in the structures of society as you get older, and I think that\u2019s coming to the surface now.\u201d\n\nA picture-postcard America nevertheless played a big part in the actual making of The Ascension. Stevens is today sequestered in the mountains upstate from New York, having moved here 18 months ago after 20 years in the city. \u201cI\u2019ve been coming up here to think and work for the last decade,\u201d he says. \u201cMaking the permanent move was a total transformation of my life, my mental health and perspective. I think deep down I\u2019m more of a naturalist. My soul belongs in the wilderness.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re expected to look good, feel good, do good all the time but insecurity, instability and disorder are built in, too Sufjan Stevens\n\nStevens spent a lot of time in nature as a kid: although he was born in the city, he spent much of his childhood in rural north Michigan, where his \u201chippy, eccentric\u201d father and stepmother did their best to shield Stevens and his six siblings from what he has described previously as constant looming \u201cdomestic and financial disaster\u201d. During these years, the outdoors often beckoned. \u201cIt made creating a life in New York when I was older actually quite hard,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to learn to be an urban dweller. It was unnatural to me.\u201d\n\nHe relocated last year, but the uprooting began in 2016 after touring Carrie and Lowell. Kicked out of his Brooklyn studio \u201cfor various shitty landlord reasons\u201d, he could only access a drum machine and computer after putting his belongings in storage. \u201cThat\u2019s why the nature of this record is so simple: I could only use things I could plug into a computer. My mind was not really in the folk idiom any more. I\u2019d packed my guitars in the storage and I think mentally I\u2019d packed away that aesthetic, too.\u201d\n\nHe does not know whether it was the instruments that led him to the socio-political subject matter of The Ascension or vice versa, but he was aware that the \u201ccold, impersonal, synthetic\u201d sounds he was playing around with and the anxieties swirling around his brain were aligning. \u201cFor me, the folk idiom is a great platform for storytelling and narrative,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the mechanics, the ergonomics of the instrument, that\u2019s very personal. It\u2019s very physical, very intimate. So when I write on the guitar or banjo, it feels natural to tell a story. The beats I was constructing when working on my laptop on the other hand felt parallel to a lot of the things I was thinking.\u201d\n\nOne topic on his mind was social media, a technology he says has rewired our interactions as well our democracy. \u201cPeople start to feel anxiety about who they are and who they feel they ought to be,\u201d he says, \u201cand there becomes a real tension between those things. We\u2019re expected to look good, feel good, do good all the time but insecurity, instability and disorder are built into its system.\u201d\n\nAngelic upstart \u2026 Sufjan Stevens performs at the Outside Lands festival in San Francisco, 2016. Photograph: FilmMagic\n\nSocial media has exacerbated \u201ccelebrity culture and idol worship\u201d, he says, and \u201cit monetises us, it commodifies human instinct. There\u2019s a loss of identity within that transaction.\u201d Moreover, \u201csystemic racism is nothing new. Corporate greed is nothing new. Political corruption is old as the hills.

Still, there\u2019s no mistaking that strains of Nashville reside in her voice and in her musical soul, and now, with her fifth album, Landes is finally bringing them to center stage.\n\nMeet Me At The River is Landes\u2019 self-described \u201cNashville record,\u201d and she has assured its pedigree by enlisting the production skills of Fred Foster, the Country Music Hall of Fame member who played a pivotal role in the careers of Dolly Parton, Roy Orbison, and Kris Kristofferson.\n\n\u201cI knew I wanted to make a record in Nashville,\u201d says Landes, who has been based in New York for most of her music career. \u201cI had this idea of what the sound of Nashville was to me \u2013 the countrypolitan sound of the \u201950s and \u201960s \u2013 I thought it would be great to work with someone who was actually a part of that scene, so I went straight to the source.\u201d\n\nBut how does a New York-based artist attract the attention of a Nashville studio icon, now in his eighties, who is keenly selective about any new project? (His most recent production credits, after all, were on albums by Hall of Famers Willie Nelson, Ray Price, and Merle Haggard.)\n\nTwo years ago, Landes first reached out to Foster by phone while she was on tour in New Zealand. Intrigued by her exotic location, Foster recounted \u201cWillie Nelson told me Christ Church, NZ is the most beautiful place on Earth.\u201d He then asked Landes to send him some of her music. \u201cIf there\u2019s something I can contribute,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\n\nWhat Foster encountered was a library of music that has been attracting ardent fans and critical acclaim since Landes entered New York\u2019s music scene in 1999. Raised in Louisville, Kentucky, and Branson, Missouri, Landes cultivated her musical gifts not only through performing and songwriting, but also through learn-by-doing production work that eventually led her to co-owning a recording studio for a time. Over the years, she has collaborated with such contemporaries as Will Oldham, Justin Townes Earle, and Norah Jones, creating music for albums, movies, and television that crosses folk, rock, and alternative genres.\n\nFoster, of course, liked what he heard and soon invited Landes to his Nashville home \u2013 a four-hour visit that convinced both they were kindred musical spirits.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about finding the right studio or finding the right musicians,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was about finding somebody who got me and got the music and who I trusted.\u201d\n\nFoster sent Landes off to \u201cstudy the Hanks\u201d \u2013 songwriting legends Hank Williams and Hank Cochran \u2013 and she also found inspiration in two other favorites, Dolly Parton and Lucinda Williams. Over the next several months, Landes began to compile original compositions, adding to a songlist she\u2019d already banked in trips to Nashville for co- writing sessions.\n\nThe next step for Landes was to sit down with Foster for lengthy get-togethers that he called \u201cwoodshedding\u201d \u2013 hours of listening to music, discussing ideas, and finetuning lyrics, all with a side of Foster\u2019s favorite fried pies.\n\n\u201cArtistically, I feel I had a great editor,\u201d Landes says. Foster, she adds, often alluded to Hank Williams\u2019 publisher Fred Rose as the great \u201csong doctor,\u201d and \u201cI feel like that\u2019s what Fred did to my songs. He tuned them, and they\u2019re better for it.\u201d\n\nTen songs written or co-written by Landes made the cut for the album, offering a range of musical moods and attitudes. \u201cHow to Say \u2018I Love You\u2019\u201d and \u201cI Don\u2019t Dance\u201d (a duet with Bobby Bare) show off Landes\u2019 light touch with melody and lyrics, while \u201cWind and Rain\u201d and \u201cSouthern Girl\u201d are searing testimonies to heartbreak. Landes takes inspiration from classic country themes with \u201cWhy They Name Whiskey After Men,\u201d a done-me- wrong song; \u201cTraveling,\u201d an ode to restless wandering; and \u201cOld Memories,\u201d which addresses the bittersweetness of lost love.\n\nFor the title track, \u201cMeet Me at the River,\u201d Landes expresses wistful longings. Turning more inward, she takes on eternal questions with the simple, and simply exquisite, \u201cWhat Will I Do?\u201d And with \u201cKeep on Moving,\u201d she embraces the tradition of music as political expression, paying tribute to activists and crusaders.\n\nDuring their meetings, Foster also introduced Landes to the work of Jimmy Driftwood, the late American folk singer, songwriter and activist whom Foster produced in the 1960s.\n\nAt one point, Foster simply began reciting the lyrics to Driftwood\u2019s \u201cMy Church\u201d: \u201cMy church is under the tree/My church is over the sea/and deep in my mind may I always find/My church in the heart of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was so moving to me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even heard what the song sounded like, and I was just floored by the words.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Landes decided to round out the album with \u201cMy Church,\u201d as well as Driftwood\u2019s anthem to racial equality, \u201cWhat Is the Color of the Soul of Man?\u201d\n\nThough Driftwood passed away in 1998, \u201chis music feels very present,\u201d Landes says. \u201cWoody Guthrie and Hank Williams both had that same gift.\u201d\n\nWhen Landes was finally ready to record, Foster recruited Kyle Lehning, who produced Randy Travis\u2019 library of hits, to serve as the album\u2019s sound engineer. Together, they made sure Landes had access to Nashville\u2019s musical riches and its heritage.\n\nMost of the sessions took place at Sound Emporium Studios, the \u201chouse\u201d that Hall of Famer \u201cCowboy\u201d Jack Clement built; over the years, it\u2019s been the home to hits by artists ranging from Merle Haggard and Keith Whitley to Alabama Shakes and Jason Isbell.\n\nFoster and Lehning also called up the cream of Nashville\u2019s \u201cA\u201d list of studio musicians: Country Music Hall of Fame member Charlie McCoy (harmonica); Eddie Bayers, 13- time Academy of Country Music drummer of the year; pianist Bobby Wood, who recorded with Elvis Presley and has played keyboards on all of Garth Brooks\u2019 hits; mandolinist-acoustic guitarist Bobby Terry (Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, Alison Krauss); acoustic guitarist John Willis (Jason Aldean, Brooks & Dunn, Johnny Mathis); fiddler Larry Franklin (Kenny Rogers, Randy Travis, Shania Twain); pedal steel guitarist Russ Pahl (Blake Shelton, Taylor Swift, Eric Church); pianist Steve Nathan (Tim McGraw, George Strait, Little Big Town). Bass player Larry Paxton (Reba McEntire, Kenny Chesney, Alabama) also served as band leader.\n\nDespite years of working with seasoned New York musicians, Landes was astonished by Nashville\u2019s level of musicianship. \u201cI got together with Larry Paxton one day and played him all the songs once, and he charted them out and we went into the studio,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI sang each song and played acoustic guitar while all the musicians stood in a circle all around me and looked at the charts. Then we played it two, maybe three times and it was done.\u201d\n\nFrom her own years as a producer, she says, \u201cI know how hard that is. It was astonishing. It was magic.\u201d\n\nAll the while, Foster assumed quiet command, sitting in the control booth alongside Lehning. \u201cI felt completely at ease with Fred at the helm,\u201d Landes says. \u201cWe rarely disagreed. A few times he asked for a tempo change that seemed extremely slow to me in the moment but felt perfect on playback. Listening back, he\u2019d crack a slight smile or give me a thumbs up, and I knew we were on the right path.\u201d\n\nThe musicians, in turn, \u201cwere in awe of Fred,\u201d Landes says. \u201cThey obviously revered him and wanted the sessions to go well.\u201d And with so much history in the room, she recalls, \u201cthere were so many stories!\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most memorable day of recording came when country legend Bobby Bare arrived to sing their duet, \u201cI Won\u2019t Dance.\u201d Bare, another member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, was Lehning\u2019s choice, but Landes was the one who had to persuade him to participate.\n\n\u201cI drove to his house by myself to play him the song,\u201d she says. \u201cI was just so nervous about that. He was kind of like Fred when I first met him. Bobby had lots of questions, like who are you, and why are you here, and what do you want from me? I sang him the song, and then he said, \u2018Play me something else that you wrote.\u2019 I kind of froze, and he said, \u2018Well, play me the song you played last at your last show.\u2019 Which means, what\u2019s your best song? So I played him \u2018Twilight\u2019 from my album from 2008, and he liked it. And then I played him recordings of a couple of the songs on the new album, and he said, \u2018I\u2019m in.\u2019\u201d\n\nOnce in the studio, Bare, Foster and Lehning took their time shooting the breeze and regaling each other with old stories. Once they got down to business, Landes was amazed that Bare joined her in the recording booth with a wad of chewing tobacco in his mouth \u2013 definitely not a habit among New York artists. The dialogue song is sprinkled with witty spoken asides by both singers, and Landes guarantees \u201cthey were all off the cuff. It was fun, really fun.\u201d\n\nThe album was recorded in two series of sessions about six months apart, and in that time, Nashville had worked its wiles on Landes: She and her husband, composer Creighton Irons, decided to leave New York behind and move to Music City. They put down roots just a couple of months before their daughter, Callan, was born in the spring of 2017.\n\nOriginally determined to make a \u201cNashville record,\u201d Landes has now become a part of Nashville\u2019s music scene, and she is eager to share the new album, which is set for release in 2018.\n\nLandes set out to create an album with Nashville \u201cauthenticity\u201d \u2013 and the people she surrounded herself with assured her of that. In the process, they also helped her achieve what has been her goal throughout her music career: her own authentic voice.\n\n\u201cIt just feels real,\u201d Landes says of the new music. Yes, it has a country vibe, but is it country? Landes takes her cue from Foster when she talks about genre.\n\nDespite his place in Nashville\u2019s country music history, Foster \u201cdoesn\u2019t consider himself country,\u201d Landes says. \u201cHe has a unique taste that I think I identify with somehow. He likes all music as long as it\u2019s good music.\u201d\n\nAs she played her music for Foster, she kept asking, \u201cIs it country?\u201d And Foster, ever enigmatic, kept answering, \u201cWhat country?\u201d"}, {"url": "https://acousticguitar.com/acoustic-guitar-sessions-presents-dawn-landes/", "page_content": "The Brooklyn-based singer-songwriter performs the title track from her latest album and shares how to position a microphone when recording an acoustic guitar.\n\nBrooklyn-based singer/songwriter Dawn Landes performs the title track from her latest album, Bluebird, and shares tips on how to position a microphone when recording an acoustic guitar.\n\nLandes, who grew up in Kentucky and has since relocated to New York, has proven to be one of the more intriguing songwriters of her generation, releasing five full-length albums and two EPs since 2005.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHaving collaborated with the likes of Justin Townes Earle, Will Oldham, and Josh Ritter, her gorgeous new record, Bluebird, features vocal and piano cameos by Norah Jones.\n\nLook for an upcoming feature on Landes in Acoustic Guitar magazine, and for more information on this talented guitarist and singer, including her current tour schedule, check out her website.\n\nFor more Acoustic Guitar Sessions, check out the archive."}, {"url": "https://www.sagamusic.com/artists/dawn-landes/", "page_content": "Dawn Landes (born December 5, 1980) is an American singer-songwriter and musician.

Two years ago, Landes reached out to Foster, and a four~hour visit to his Nashville home convinced both they were musical kindred spirits. With roots in both Louisville, Kentucky, and Branson, Missouri, Landes has been attracting ardent fans and critical acclaim since entering New York\u2019s music scene in 2000. Along the way, she has collaborated with such contemporaries as Sufjan Stevens, Justin Townes Earle, and Norah Jones, creating music for albums, movies, and television that crosses folk, rock, and alternative genres.\n\n\u2022 In Her Words: \u201eI was lucky enough to work with the legendary producer Fred Foster for my new record. Fred has been making hits for most of his 87 years. Merle Haggard once said, 'he lives in the songs.\u2019 He does, he\u2019s there in \u2018Pretty Woman\u2019 and \u2018Me and Bobby McGee\u2019 and Dolly Parton\u2019s first hit, \u2018Dumb Blonde.\u2019 I learned so much working with Fred on this record and I\u2019m really proud of it. Some of my favorite lessons were: * \u2018Keep it conversational.\u2019 If you can speak the lyric and it reads, it\u2019s all the morepowerful. * \u2018A great song can be sung by anyone in any style and any meter.\u2019 He learned this from the great publisher Fred Rose, who sat at a piano and played him Hoagy Carmichael\u2019s \u201eStarlight\u201c in its popular form, then in 3/4 time, then in a Western swing style. They all worked. * \u2018The feel is the thing. If you\u2019re in the wrong tempo you won\u2019t have the feel.\u2019 The drummer Eddie Bayers who played on the album has said that Fred sets the best tempos of anybody. I believe it. We recorded everything in Nashville with the heaviest hitters around: Kyle Lehning, Charlie McCoy, Steve Gibson, Bobby Wood, Eddie Bayers, Russ Pahl, Larry Paxton, Larry Franklin and more.\u201c \u2014 Dawn Landes\n\nAlbums:\n\n\u2660\u2660 dawn\u2019s Music (2005)\n\n\u2660\u2660 Two Three Four (2006)\n\n\u2660\u2660 Fireproof (2008)\n\n\u2660\u2660 Sweetheart Rodeo (2010)\n\n\u2660\u2660 Bluebird (2014)\n\n\u2660\u2660 Meet Me at the River (2018)\n\nEP:\n\n\u2660\u2660 Straight Lines (2005)\n\n\u2660\u2660 Mal Habill\u00e9e (2012)\n\nReview\n\nBy Josh Weinberg, Published Aug 07, 2018. Score: 8\n\n\u2022 Good storytelling and country music are meant to go together. For singer~songwriter Dawn Landes, the results make for one impressive collection on Meet Me at the River. Her teaming with legendary Nashville producer Fred Foster may seem unorthodox, but it works to perfection. Plenty of slide guitar and clap~along beats soundtrack Landes\u2019s beautiful delivery.\n\n\u2022 Landes chronicles a much~needed excursion on \u201eTraveling\u201c \u2014 wanting to see the sun rise over Graceland and explore wherever the road of life takes her. The opening harmonica solo and organ breakdown on \u201eWhy They Name Whiskey After Men\u201c spices up a song comparing men to alcohol (because it\u2019s true, they can both taste good and leave a lot of pain afterwards).\n\n\u2022 Providing backup for Landes on this record is an absolute A~team of musicians, from the stomp~clap rhythm of \u201eKeep On Moving\u201c to an excellent acoustic guitar line to the superb cover of Johnny Driftwood\u2019s \u201eWhat Is the Color of the Soul of a Man.\u201c It\u2019s the closest to blues this record gets, and worth every second.\n\n\u2022 The best example of what this album does, however, is on \u201eWhat Will I Do,\u201c a beautiful song, complete with harmonious backing vocals. A song about pondering risk v. reward, but \u201eonly the moon and stars can know\u201c what is right. It\u2019s clear that Dawn\u2019s songwriting is one of her many strengths, as Meet Me at the River is only too proud to showcase.\n\n\u2022 https://exclaim.ca/\n\nWebsite: http://www.dawnlandes.com\n\nLabel: http://westernvinyl.com/\n\nMySpace: https://myspace.com/dawnlandes\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dawnlandes\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dawnlandes/\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/FunMachineMusic\n\n_____________________________________________________________"}, {"url": "https://circuitsweet.co.uk/2014/03/dawn-landes-announces-uk-tour-dates%E2%80%8F/", "page_content": "\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s hard not to feel transported\u201d Uncut 8/10\n\n\u201cThis is deceptively simple music that packs a real punch\u201d Evening Standard 4/5\n\n\u201cthis is the sound of a woman getting clear and moving on, and letting everyone know she\u2019s in a better place for living it, and for singing it\u201d The Line Of Best Fit\n\nDawn Landes\n\n\n\nUK live dates announced for May 2014\n\nNew album Bluebird out now via Western Vinyl\n\nBrooklyn based artist Dawn Landes will return to the UK in May in support of her recently released, critically acclaimed new album Bluebird.

A labor of love. An attempt to reach out to parents and help them self-sooth. So, what is Lullabies For Parents?\n\n\u2013 Lullabies For Parents is a multimedia series of resources, entertainment, and encouragement for parents of all ages featuring music, podcast, videos, essays, assorted content and community that promotes finding common ground, connection, and comfort. -The music portion will be a series of singles \u2013 some of Rosie\u2019s strongest, most inspired work to date, with a slew of guest vocalists. Rosie has a LOT of musician friends, and almost all of them will appear on this series, including but not limited to: Sufjan Stevens, James Mercer, Sam Beam, The Head and the Heart, Alexi Murdoch, Dawn Landes, David Bazan, William Fitzsimmons and tons more! -The podcast will finally give a vehicle to some of Rosie\u2019s greatest, and as yet underutilized strengths: her unique ability to quickly disarm, relate to, and encourage people in their struggles, even as they\u2019re entertained by her razor-sharp wit, and engaging, loveable personality. (more on that soon). -There will be videos, essays, books, and a merch line for both parents and kids alike. -Most of all, it will be a community of support, and it\u2019s only just beginning.\n\n***\n\nIt\u2019s never been enough for Rosie Thomas. Not in shallow terms of success or fame, but in her own deeper personal sense of making the most of her life, what she has to offer, and what she wants to lend. Years of following the same well-worn formula of releasing albums (through Sub Pop, Nettwerk, and her own SINGALONG imprint), doing interviews, and going on tour to play those same songs again increasingly left her unsatisfied, bored, and yearning for more.\n\nSo, she began throwing wrenches in the works to see what might shake loose. She first tried opening her own somber, emotionally serious concerts disguised as an unannounced, awkward, neck-braced, coke-bottle-bespeckled comedian named Sheila Saputo, but over time as people became wise to the \u201calter ego\u201d identity, and the Kaufman-Clifton mystery faded, so did her interest in keeping it up. And while Rosie has always enjoyed making people laugh, dabbling in stand up, opening for Mitch Hedberg, acting opposite Steve Zahn, performing on the UCB stage, or making zany videos to promote a Sufjan Christmas album, she quickly found comedy alone didn\u2019t allow for the earnest emotional connection she began to desire most of all.\n\nAs her years of self-work and personal growth took her from a 20-something with a lot of questions to a more seasoned, more confident grown-up with more to actually lend, she found she had much more desire to talk with people at shows than just sing \u2013 thinking, \u201cYou can listen to these songs at home. We\u2019re together now. Let\u2019s go further!\u201d But creating an extended break in the set to talk to the crowd, or a handful of one-on-ones after at the merch table just didn\u2019t cut it either.\n\nOnce relocated to NYC, a place where career is pretty much everyone\u2019s sole focus, she wound up spending most of her time in between tours having people over to listen to them, and encourage them in whatever they were going through. But it didn\u2019t stop with friends and acquaintances. When she did phone interviews, she\u2019d spend an hour of a scheduled 30 min call talking about the interviewer\u2019s life, asking them questions, and building them up without even discussing her new album. What an eavesdropper might assume to be a heart-to-heart phone call with an old dear friend would turn on a dime to a billing question, revealing she had been going deep with a random customer service agent the whole time. People at parties, clerks at stores, strangers on the street; it didn\u2019t matter. Rosie had to talk to people. Not just talk, but really connect on a meaningful level, and not waste any time. She wants to find common ground; she wants people to feel understood, to feel less alone, to feel encouraged, and to feel comforted. Even as you read this, she\u2019s bummed somewhere that she can\u2019t ask you questions, and see how you\u2019re doing. How you\u2019re really doing.\n\nRosie has always pulled on heart strings, always made people laugh, always entertained, and always made a unique impact on others \u2013 in a way that only she could. Renowned publicist Carla Sacks, once said that Rosie had \u201cone of the most singular voices\u201d she had encountered, and yet Thomas was still searching for how to incorporate all these parts of herself in just the right way.\n\nHaving tried a few tours singing in other people\u2019s bands (Iron & Wine, Sufjan Stevens) and one more solo tour of her last record, Rosie was pretty over it all, and it was clear she needed a change, new inspiration, and a new direction.\n\nThough not necessarily the change she had in mind, change most certainly came.\n\nShe got pregnant, had a baby, left NY, and got busy being a parent. Then she had another one, and got busier still. This continued until she and her husband and creative partner, Jeff Shoop, were outnumbered, and then the inspiration fell into their laps\u2026 Or out of her lap, I guess?\n\nHaving been a purveyor of some admittedly sleepy music, it initially seemed an obvious time to make a lullaby album for kids. But as the newly overwhelmed and under-slept mother began writing, she soon realized the songs coming out were ultimately to comfort and soothe herself \u2013 the parent. As she\u2019d always done before, Rosie wrote about what was in front of her, processing what she was going through, and what she needed to hear \u2013 and so parents themselves became the focus. She figured parents are the ones that need the soothing after all. Help the parents first, so that they can help their own kids. Like putting on your oxygen mask first, before helping those that need assistance \u2013 ya know\u2026 basically.\n\nAt that point the inspiration floodgates opened wide, and a clarity of vision that Rosie had long sought began to take shape. Through music, videos, a podcast, essays, books, clothing, on and on, there was no shortage of material. Available time to actually work on it? No, yeah, there was a shortage there. They had lots of little kids, and not lots of help, so the two parents would work comically late into the night, or for a highly concentrated week when they could coax grandparents to town. The work was her most inspired and well crafted, but with so many interruptions, also frustratingly slow, snuck in between playtime, playgrounds, nap times, nursing, diaper changes, and then\u2026 the pandemic hit \u2013 slowing the in-house operation even further while increasing the pressure to get it out to the parents who would need it now more than ever.\n\nSo now at long last, Rosie returns with Lullabies For Parents, a multimedia series of resources, entertainment, and encouragement for parents of all ages featuring music, podcast, videos, essays, assorted content and community that promotes finding common ground, connection, and comfort. Musical contributions throughout the series include Sufjan Stevens, The Shins, Iron & Wine, Alexi Murdoch, Audrey Assad, William Fitzsimmons, Charity Theilen of The Head & The Heart, Kanene Pipkin of The Lone Bellow, Leigh Nash, Denison Witmer, Dawn Landes, Kyshona Armstrong, and more to come.\n\nIn a social media age of putting our best foot forward, presenting the impression of having it together, and perpetuating a false facade that others mistake as some unrealistic standard to aspire to, Rosie wants poop her pants, so everyone knows it\u2019s okay if/when they do \u2013 metaphorically or not. That\u2019s closer to a realistic portrayal of actual life than the baloney we see every day. We all have hardships, struggles, and insecurities, but we\u2019re not sure we\u2019re allowed to admit it and show them. But as Rosie often says, \u201cif you don\u2019t say it, who will?\u201d\n\nWell, Rosie is here to say it!\n\nShe\u2019s here to comfort you, to cheer you on, and to remind you It\u2019ll Be Alright.\n\nPress photos by Lindsey Patkos"}, {"url": "https://www.networthlist.org/dawn-landes-net-worth-138723", "page_content": "\ud83d\udcb0 Dawn Landes Net worth: 13 Million\n\nSome Dawn Landes images\n\nAbout\n\nFolk rock musician who has collaborated with the likes of Andrew Bird, Jose Gonzalez, and Midlake.\n\nBefore Fame\n\nShe moved to New York to study music at New York University.\n\nTrivia\n\nShe frequently played on New York-area college campuses.\n\nFamily Life\n\nShe married and toured with the musician Josh Ritter.\n\nAssociated With\n\nShe has toured with the singer Suzanne Vega."}, {"url": "https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/dawn-landes.html", "page_content": "About\n\nFolk rock musician who has collaborated with the likes of Andrew Bird, Jose Gonzalez, and Midlake.\n\nBefore Fame\n\nShe moved to New York to study music at New York University.\n\nTrivia\n\nShe frequently played on New York-area college campuses.\n\nFamily Life\n\nShe married and toured with the musician Josh Ritter.\n\nAssociated With\n\nShe has toured with the singer Suzanne Vega."}, {"url": "https://itsbiography.com/Dawn-Landes/", "page_content": "Dawn Landes Wiki \u2013 Dawn Landes Biography\n\nDawn Landes is a well-known celebrity from United States of America.
