{"Anne de Gaulle was a devoted Catholic.": [{"url": "https://catholiccitizens.org/views/65338/anne-de-gaulle/", "page_content": "By Donald R. McClarey \u2022 April 21, AD2016 5\n\nCharles de Gaulle could be a very frustrating man. Churchill, in reference to de Gaulle, said that the heaviest cross he had to bear during the war was the Cross of Lorraine, the symbol of the Free French forces.\n\nArrogant, autocratic, often completely unreasonable, de Gaulle was all of these. However, there is no denying that he was also a great man. Rallying the Free French forces after the Nazi conquest of France, he boldly proclaimed, \u201cFrance has lost a battle, France has not lost the war.\u201d For more than a few Frenchmen and women, de Gaulle became the embodiment of France. It is also hard to dispute that De Gaulle is the greatest Frenchman since Clemenceau, \u201cThe Tiger\u201d, who led France to victory in World War I. However, de Gaulle was something more than a great man, he was also at bottom a good man, as demonstrated by his youngest daughter Anne de Gaulle.\n\nAnne de Gaulle Had Down Syndrome\n\nCharles and Yvonne de Gaulle were both devout Catholics, so when their youngest daughter Anne was born on New Years Day in 1928, they had a strong faith to fall back on when they learned that Anne had Down Syndrome. She also had birth injuries that meant that she would never walk unaided. There was never any question about Anne being institutionalized. She was a member of their family, and she stayed with the family in all their travels. There was one sacred rule in the de Gaulle household: Anne was never to be made to feel different or less than anyone else.\n\nCharles de Gaulle was noted for his reserve and even with family members he was usually not very demonstrative. Not so with his daughter Anne, who received a warmth that he had seemed to be storing for his entire life just for her. \u201cPapa\u201d was the one word that Anne could say clearly. He would sing to her, read her stories and play with her. She was, he said simply, \u201cMy joy\u201d. As de Gaulle said, \u201cShe helped me overcome the failures in all men, and to look beyond them.\u201d\n\nThe De Gaulles Were Heartbroken\n\nYvonne de Gaulle, a formidable woman in her own right, as she demonstrated after the collapse of France in 1940 when by herself she traveled across the war-torn country and made sure her family, including Anne, was on the last transport from Brest to England, in October 1945 bought the Ch\u00e2teau de Vert-C\u0153ur and established a hospital for handicapped girls, the Fondation Anne de Gaulle. The de Gaulles were heartbroken when their beloved daughter died on February 6, 1948, in her father\u2019s arms. After they had buried her, Charles gently told his weeping wife, \u201cMaintenant, elle est comme les autres.\u201d (Now, she\u2019s like all the others.)\n\nOf course , the de Gaulles did not forget their daughter. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s\u2019 life was saved by his love for Anne on August 22, 1962, when an assassin\u2019s bullet was deflected in the car he was riding by the frame of the picture of his daughter which he carried with him at all times. When he died in 1970 he was buried beside his daughter at Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises as he requested. Love gives us no guarantees against the tragedies of life, but it does give us the strength to surmount them.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nThis article appeared on Catholic Stand and is reprinted with permission of the author.\n\nAbout the Author: Donald R.

Few know, however, how much strength he drew from his Down Syndrome daughter.\n\nWhen it comes to failed governments in our time, it\u2019s hard to ignore French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s administration. Hollande\u2019s record on basic issues like unemployment as well as his ineptness in the face of jihadist terrorism is so unimpressive that he declined to run for reelection. This, however, hasn\u2019t stopped his government from making the type of last-minute defiant gesture beloved of administrations whose days are numbered.\n\nIn Hollande\u2019s case, it has taken the form of effectively banning pro-life websites that don\u2019t explicitly identify themselves as pro-life. This follows a 2016 ruling by France\u2019s Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat endorsing a broadcasting tribunal\u2019s 2014 decision to prohibit a commercial portraying Down Syndrome children as joyful individuals loved by their parents because it might distress those who chose to terminate an unborn disabled child.\n\nReflecting upon these developments, I couldn\u2019t help thinking how much France owes to one particular Down Syndrome child: a young girl who struggled to speak, needed assistance to walk, and who died of pneumonia at the age of 20 cradled in her father\u2019s arms. Anne de Gaulle\u2019s father, however, was no ordinary man.\n\nCharles de Gaulle was surely the twentieth century\u2019s greatest Frenchman. Yet for all his achievements, the ultimate drama of de Gaulle\u2019s life was his helpless daughter. What Anne gave to him, however, was immeasurable. As de Gaulle confided to a priest at the beginning of his lonely crusade in 1940 to save France\u2019s honor, \u201cfor me, this child is a grace, she is my joy, she helps me to look beyond all the failures and honors, and always to look higher.\u201d\n\nUn enfant pas comme les autres\n\nCharles de Gaulle was an austere individual, one who consciously cultivated distance from others. 47 years after his death, however, we know much more about the private man. Thanks to the publication of memoirs, especially those of his son Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, the General emerges as a man who, like many French army officers of his background, found solace in his Catholic faith and a closely-knit family. We\u2019re also discovered that de Gaulle had a rich intellectual life which went far beyond politics. This went hand-in-hand with a wicked sense of humor which, in private, de Gaulle wasn\u2019t averse to using against himself.\n\nBy the time he reached his mid-30s, de Gaulle had settled into a milieu in which his faith, family and profession provided many of the certainties required for an ambitious man intent upon shaking up a political and military establishment committed to obsolete ideas. All this was shattered on 1 January 1928 when Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s third child was born. Within a few months, it became apparent that Anne was severely disabled.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that this was an era in which disabled children were neither seen nor heard in polite company. Down Syndrome children were referred to as \u201cmongols.\u201d Some even speculated that the condition resulted from alcoholism or some form of impropriety on the parents\u2019 part. It wasn\u2019t until 30 years after Anne de Gaulle\u2019s birth that another devout French Catholic, Professor Jerome Lejeune, and his research team discovered that Down Syndrome was caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21.\n\nIn the 1930s, it was common for French families to place disabled children permanently in hospitals that were woefully ill-equipped to care them. Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, however, refused to send Anne to live with, as he would say, \u201cstrangers.\u201d In de Gaulle\u2019s words, \u201cGod has given her to us. We must take responsibility for her, wherever she is and whatever she will be.\u201d In a way, de Gaulle\u2019s reaction to Anne\u2019s entry into his life foreshadowed the spirit of resistance expressed in his famous appeal of 18 June 1940 to Frenchmen to continue the war against Germany.\n\nThe de Gaulles worked hard to build a place for, to use de Gaulle\u2019s expression, \u201ca child who is not like the others\u201d in their family. From all accounts, Yvonne de Gaulle adopted a matter-of-fact approach. She focused on the practicalities of caring for a disabled child. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s contribution was to envelop Anne in a web of affection. According to his son, de Gaulle wanted to give Anne the assurance that he loved her just as much as her older brother and sister\u2014that her disability meant nothing to him.\n\nThe tall army officer infamous for his air of haughty disdain as leader of Free France during World War II and later as French President didn\u2019t hesitate to unbend to play on the floor with Anne. De Gaulle sang to Anne, told her stories, and even allowed her to play with one of his most treasured possessions: his officer\u2019s kepi hat. De Gaulle also said prayers with Anne in the evening. Painstakingly, she would repeat each word after her father. \u201cYou see,\u201d de Gaulle proudly informed his relatives, \u201cshe knows her prayers!\u201d\n\nWhen away on army business, de Gaulle constantly inquired about Anne\u2019s well-being. On one occasion, Anne had an operation while he was absent on maneuvers. De Gaulle telephoned incessantly to ask if she was in pain, whether the procedure had succeeded, what the doctors were saying, etc. Anne seems to have been aware of just how much she meant to her father. Her first governess recalled that Anne adored him and would be visibly upset when his responsibilities took de Gaulle away from his family.\n\nThough the de Gaulles valued their privacy, they didn\u2019t view Anne as an embarrassment. There are pictures of her standing awkwardly with members of the de Gaulles\u2019 extended family. Most striking, however, is a photo of Anne taken at a beach in Brittany in 1933. She is sitting on her father\u2019s lap. He, dressed in a homburg hat and three-piece suit, gently holds her hands as the five year-old girl looks intensely into her father\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s an image of unconditional love.\n\nWhile Anne lived, the de Gaulles took her everywhere with them. That included less-than-hospitable locations such as the French mandate in Syria and Lebanon. De Gaulle was posted there in 1929, partly because some of his superiors wanted to sideline an officer who asked awkward questions about France\u2019s readiness for the next war. There was, however, no question of leaving Anne behind. Instead she went with them, with the de Gaulles hiring a full-time governess to help them care for Anne in a Middle-Eastern country.\n\nFragility\u2014and Resistance\u2014in the face of Evil\n\nThere was, of course, a cost to all this. Though Charles de Gaulle came from a minor aristocratic family and his wife from an upper-middle class background, the de Gaulles were not wealthy. His modest army pay was their main source of income. Hiring full-time help was subsequently an enormous financial liability, but one they didn\u2019t hesitate to assume.\n\nThen there was the psychological burden. As Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s biographer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Neau-Dufour observes, Yvonne was an exuberant, even care-free young woman before Anne was born. After Anne\u2019s birth, that woman gradually disappeared. Yvonne became a much quieter, even somewhat withdrawn person who dreaded public appearances. This, however, didn\u2019t stop her from undertaking the extremely difficult task of successfully fleeing France with the profoundly disabled Anne in tow as the German Army swept across the country in May and June 1940.\n\nThis brings into focus another factor of which Charles de Gaulle was undoubtedly aware: how the National Socialist regime treated the disabled. Eugenics was part and parcel of the Nazi view of the world (and most Western liberal opinion for decades). And, as the Nazis made clear right from the beginning, the disabled had no place in a National Socialist world. They were lebensunwertes leben (life unworthy of life).\n\nStarting in September 1939, the Nazi government began removing Down Syndrome children and infants suffering from other disabilities from their parents. These children were taken to \u201chealth facilities\u201d and killed by lethal injection or gas poisoning. In the name of \u201cracial health\u201d and other eugenics nonsense, the regime murdered thousands of disabled children. Among them was a 15 year-old Down Syndrome cousin of the future pope, Joseph Ratzinger.\n\nThis would have been Anne de Gaulle\u2019s fate if she had ever fallen into Nazi hands. Although de Gaulle never referenced it specifically, it\u2019s likely that the brutal treatment of the disabled was one of the things he had in mind when referring to the evil of the Nazi regime. When de Gaulle refused to surrender in 1940 and was branded a traitor by France\u2019s political and military elites, it was certainly the act of an intensely patriotic man unwilling to accept his country\u2019s abasement by the Nazis. But de Gaulle\u2019s act of resistance also concerned safeguarding his defenseless daughter from those who viewed her as sub-human.\n\nLife after Death\n\nLike many Down Syndrome children, Anne de Gaulle died at an early age. Her brother Philippe recollects arriving at his parents\u2019 house in 1948 to find the entire residence immersed in silence. Noone, he writes, dared to say anything to his grief-stricken father. Anne was subsequently buried in the cemetery at the de Gaulles\u2019 parish church in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. After attending their regular Sunday Mass and always on the anniversary of her death, Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle would visit Anne\u2019s grave. 22 years after she died, her father was laid to rest beside Anne. Her mother joined them in 1979.\n\nThat, however, wasn\u2019t the end of the story. Back in October 1945, the de Gaulles raised enough money from private donors to buy the chateau de Vert-C\u0153ur in the department of Yvelines, not far from Paris. They then began creating a home for intellectually disabled girls. A few months after Anne\u2019s death, the Fondation Anne-de-Gaulle opened its doors at the chateau. Staffed by nuns, funded by the considerable royalties generated by de Gaulle\u2019s memoirs, and presided over by Yvonne de Gaulle until her death, the Foundation continues to serve the disabled today.\n\nOne of Charles de Gaulle\u2019s biographers, the late Jean Lacouture, records him as once saying, \u201cWithout Anne, I could never perhaps have done what I did. She gave me the heart and the inspiration.\u201d In that sense, the man of June 18 and his beloved pauvre petiteAnne teach us something which we are tempted to forget\u2014that all of us can find strength in weakness and that nothing is more powerful than self-giving love."}, {"url": "https://catholicstand.com/anne-de-gaulle/", "page_content": "Charles de Gaulle could be a very frustrating man.

This follows a 2016 ruling by France\u2019s Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat endorsing a broadcasting tribunal\u2019s 2014 decision to prohibit a commercial portraying Down Syndrome children as joyful individuals loved by their parents because it might distress those who chose to terminate an unborn disabled child.\n\nReflecting upon these developments, I couldn\u2019t help thinking how much France owes to one particular Down Syndrome child: a young girl who struggled to speak, needed assistance to walk, and who died of pneumonia at the age of 20 cradled in her father\u2019s arms. Anne de Gaulle\u2019s father, however, was no ordinary man.\n\nCharles de Gaulle was surely the twentieth century\u2019s greatest Frenchman. Yet for all his achievements, the ultimate drama of de Gaulle\u2019s life was his helpless daughter. What Anne gave to him, however, was immeasurable. As de Gaulle confided to a priest at the beginning of his lonely crusade in 1940 to save France\u2019s honor, \u201cfor me, this child is a grace, she is my joy, she helps me to look beyond all the failures and honors, and always to look higher.\u201d\n\nCharles de Gaulle was an austere individual, one who consciously cultivated distance from others. 47 years after his death, however, we know much more about the private man. Thanks to the publication of memoirs, especially those of his son Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, the General emerges as a man who, like many French army officers of his background, found solace in his Catholic faith and a closely-knit family.\n\nBy the time he reached his mid-30s, de Gaulle had settled into a milieu in which his faith, family and profession provided many of the certainties required for an ambitious man intent upon shaking up a political and military establishment committed to obsolete ideas. All this was shattered on 1 January 1928 when Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s third child was born. Within a few months, it became apparent that Anne was severely disabled.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that this was an era in which disabled children were neither seen nor heard in polite company. Down Syndrome children were referred to as \u201cmongols.\u201d Some even speculated that the condition resulted from alcoholism or some form of impropriety on the parents\u2019 part. It wasn\u2019t until 30 years after Anne de Gaulle\u2019s birth that another devout French Catholic, Professor Jerome Lejeune, and his research team discovered that Down Syndrome was caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21.\n\nIn the 1930s, it was common for French families to place disabled children permanently in hospitals that were woefully ill-equipped to care them. Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, however, refused to send Anne to live with, as he would say, \u201cstrangers.\u201d In de Gaulle\u2019s words, \u201cGod has given her to us. We must take responsibility for her, wherever she is and whatever she will be.\u201d\n\nThe de Gaulles worked hard to build a place for, to use de Gaulle\u2019s expression, \u201ca child who is not like the others\u201d in their family. From all accounts, Yvonne de Gaulle adopted a matter-of-fact approach. She focused on the practicalities of caring for a disabled child. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s contribution was to envelop Anne in a web of affection. According to his son, de Gaulle wanted to give Anne the assurance that he loved her just as much as her older brother and sister\u2013that her disability meant nothing to him.\n\nThe tall army officer infamous for his air of haughty disdain as leader of Free France during World War II and later as French President didn\u2019t hesitate to unbend to play on the floor with Anne. De Gaulle sang to Anne, told her stories, and even allowed her to play with one of his most treasured possessions: his officer\u2019s kepi hat. De Gaulle also said prayers with Anne in the evening. Painstakingly, she would repeat each word after her father. \u201cYou see,\u201d de Gaulle proudly informed his relatives, \u201cshe knows her prayers!\u201d\n\nWhen away on army business, de Gaulle constantly inquired about Anne\u2019s well-being. On one occasion, Anne had an operation while he was absent on maneuvers. De Gaulle telephoned incessantly to ask if she was in pain, whether the procedure had succeeded, what the doctors were saying, etc. Anne seems to have been aware of just how much she meant to her father. Her first governess recalled that Anne adored him and would be visibly upset when his responsibilities took de Gaulle away from his family.\n\nThough the de Gaulles valued their privacy, they didn\u2019t view Anne as an embarrassment. There are pictures of her standing awkwardly with members of the de Gaulles\u2019 extended family. Most striking, however, is a photo of Anne taken at a beach in Brittany in 1933. She is sitting on her father\u2019s lap. He, dressed in a homburg hat and three-piece suit, gently holds her hands as the five year-old girl looks intensely into her father\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s an image of unconditional love.\n\nWhile Anne lived, the de Gaulles took her everywhere with them. That included less-than-hospitable locations such as the French mandate in Syria and Lebanon. De Gaulle was posted there in 1929, partly because some of his superiors wanted to sideline an officer who asked awkward questions about France\u2019s readiness for the next war. There was, however, no question of leaving Anne behind. Instead she went with them, with the de Gaulles hiring a full-time governess to help them care for Anne.\n\nThere was, of course, a cost to all this. Though Charles de Gaulle came from a minor aristocratic family and his wife from an upper-middle class background, the de Gaulles were not wealthy. His modest army pay was their main source of income. Hiring full-time help was subsequently an enormous financial liability, but one they didn\u2019t hesitate to assume.\n\nThis brings into focus another factor of which Charles de Gaulle was undoubtedly aware: how the National Socialist regime treated the disabled. Eugenics was part and parcel of the Nazi view of the world (and most Western liberal opinion for decades). And, as the Nazis made clear right from the beginning, the disabled had no place in a National Socialist world. They were lebensunwertes leben (life unworthy of life).\n\nStarting in September 1939, the Nazi government began removing Down Syndrome children and infants suffering from other disabilities from their parents. These children were taken to \u201chealth facilities\u201d and killed by lethal injection or gas poisoning. In the name of \u201cracial health\u201d and other eugenics nonsense, the regime murdered thousands of disabled children. Among them was a 15 year-old Down Syndrome cousin of the future pope, Joseph Ratzinger.\n\nThis would have been Anne de Gaulle\u2019s fate if she had ever fallen into Nazi hands. Although de Gaulle never referenced it specifically, it\u2019s likely that the brutal treatment of the disabled was one of the things he had in mind when referring to the evil of the Nazi regime. When de Gaulle refused to surrender in 1940 and was branded a traitor by France\u2019s political and military elites, it was certainly the act of an intensely patriotic man unwilling to accept his country\u2019s abasement by the Nazis. But de Gaulle\u2019s act of resistance also concerned safeguarding his defenseless daughter from those who viewed her as sub-human.\n\nLike many Down Syndrome children, Anne de Gaulle died at an early age. Her brother Philippe recollects arriving at his parents\u2019 house in 1948 to find the entire residence immersed in silence. No one, he writes, dared to say anything to his grief-stricken father. Anne was subsequently buried in the cemetery at the de Gaulles\u2019 parish church in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. After attending their regular Sunday Mass and always on the anniversary of her death, Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle would visit Anne\u2019s grave. 22 years after she died, her father was laid to rest beside Anne. Her mother joined them in 1979.\n\nThat, however, wasn\u2019t the end of the story. Back in October 1945, the de Gaulles raised enough money from private donors to buy the chateau de Vert-C\u0153ur in the department of Yvelines, not far from Paris. They then began creating a home for intellectually disabled girls. A few months after Anne\u2019s death, the Fondation Anne-de-Gaulle opened its doors at the chateau. Staffed by nuns, funded by the considerable royalties generated by de Gaulle\u2019s memoirs, and presided over by Yvonne de Gaulle until her death, the Foundation continues to serve the disabled today.\n\nOne of Charles de Gaulle\u2019s biographers, the late Jean Lacouture, records him as once saying, \u201cWithout Anne, I could never perhaps have done what I did. She gave me the heart and the inspiration.\u201d In that sense, the man of June 18 and his beloved pauvre petite Anne teach us something which we are tempted to forget\u2013that all of us can find strength in weakness and that nothing is more powerful than self-giving love."}, {"url": "https://hollowverse.com/charles-de-gaulle", "page_content": "Charles de Gaulle was born in Lille, France. He was raised there and in Paris. He died of a ruptured blood vessel in 1970 at the age of 79.\n\nDe Gaulle came from a devout Catholic family whose parents lamented the lack of religion in the French government. Educated in Catholic schools, de Gaulle was nothing less than completely devout his whole life. He didn\u2019t speak of his faith very frequently, but there\u2019s no doubt of its importance.\n\nThroughout his dynamic life, the Catholic church was a comfort and a place of stability. About his love of Catholic ceremony he said,\n\nMass is the ceremony I most favor during my travels. Church is the only place where someone speaks to me and I do not have to answer back.\n\nAfter his beloved daughter Anne died of pneumonia at the age of 20, de Gaulle was consoled by the belief that she was looking on from heaven. He said,\n\nThe priest hurried in to give the blessing. Her soul was freed. But the disappearance of our little girl without hope caused immense suffering. May little Anne protect us from on high.\n\nAlthough de Gaulle\u2019s love of France was deeply entwined with its Catholic heritage, he remained committed to secular government. His religion, however, is only a small part of his immense legacy in France and through the world.\n\nDefining France\n\nDe Gaulle, a top member of the French military during World War II, refused to accept his country\u2019s surrender to the Nazis. He instead retreated to England and declared himself the leader of the Free French Forces, which joined the Allies in their eventual defeat of Germany. After presiding over France\u2019s interim post-war government, he resigned in 1946 to protest the constitution\u2019s lack of a strong executive power. Political instability plagued the country in de Gaulle\u2019s absence. He assumed emergency powers in 1958 while a new constitution was written, and spent the next ten years as president of France\u2019s new government.\n\nGaullism is marked by three major tenets: a powerful executive, heavy involvement of the state in the economy, and complete independence in foreign policy. It is that last tenet that is perhaps de Gaulle\u2019s most enduring legacy. He said,\n\nNo nation has friends, only interests.\n\nIt was this belief that caused the Frenchman to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) because he believed it was overly dominated by the U.S. and U.K. And although he supported a united Europe, he fought the U.K.'s entrance into the European Economic Community because he believed it was too cozy with the U.S.\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s legacy in American and British memory isn\u2019t too favorable. After all, those countries\u2019 tendency to meddle in global affairs didn\u2019t endear them to the French president\u2013during World War II, he had to be reminded that Germany was his enemy and not Britain. But he remains a hero among both the left and the right in France and across the world."}, {"url": "https://catholicism.org/39522.html", "page_content": "\u201cThese two saints of France were, as we are told in the Roman Martyrology, twin brothers.

My impressions probably reflected the distrust and dislike Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill had for him when de Gaulle led the exiled free French forces during the Second World War. FDR referred to de Gaulle as the Allies\u2019 \u201cproblem child\u201d while Churchill saw a man who refused to get off his high horse and had a \u201cJeanne d\u2019Arc complex.\u201d\n\nHowever, after reading a new biography by British journalist Jonathan Fenby on the fortieth anniversary of de Gaulle\u2019s death (The General: Charles de Gaulle and the France He Saved) I found I was wrong. Badly wrong. De Gaulle was a thoughtful, principled man whose world view stemmed from the traditional values he inherited from deeply Catholic parents.\n\nThe third of five children, Charles was born in Flanders in 1890. His father, Henri, who taught philosophy and literature at a Jesuit college, was a \u201crepresentative of the old true France\u201d who believed that the 1789 French Revolution had been \u201csatanic in essence.\u201d\n\nHenri and his wife, Jeanne, were devout Catholics who did not sing \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d or celebrate Bastille Day. Also, they could not reconcile \u201crevealed religion and a republic which put faith in the overwhelming power of reason and science.\u201d\n\nCharles de Gaulle was educated by the Christian Brothers and the Jesuits, and graduated from the French military academy, Saint Cyr. He inherited his parents\u2019 strict sense of right and wrong and lived modestly even after achieving high military and political rank. \u201cI have never been bourgeois,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bourgeois is wealth. . . . My family and I have always been poor.\u201d\n\nDuring World War I, de Gaulle was wounded several times and was captured in March 1916 during the Battle of Verdun. He spent the remainder of the war organizing escape attempts.\n\nAfter the war, he was assigned to train Polish forces during Poland\u2019s successful war against the Soviet Union between 1919-1921. He was valiant in battle and was awarded Poland\u2019s highest military decoration, the Virtuti Militari. Returning to France he served under Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, the hero of Verdun and taught at the \u1ebecole Militaire.\n\nIn April 1921, he married Yvonne Vendroux. They had three children. The apple of his eye was the youngest, Anne, who was born with Down\u2019s syndrome. He spent hours playing on all fours with her, singing an old French song, \u201cYou are beautiful mademoiselle.\u201d The only word she could say was \u201cpapa.\u201d De Gaulle believed \u201cAnne made me what I am,\u201d and was crushed when she died in his arms of pneumonia at age twenty: \u201cThe priest hurried in to give the blessing. Her soul was freed. But the disappearance of our little girl without hope caused immense suffering. May little Anne protect us from on high.\u201d As Anne\u2019s body was being lowered into the ground, he said to his wife, \u201cShe\u2019s like others now.\u201d\n\n\n\nCharles de Gaulle and his daughter Anne\n\nWhen France surrendered to Germany in 1940, de Gaulle refused to join the legally constituted but collaborating Vichy government led by P\u00e9tain and Pierre Laval. Instead he escaped to England, proclaimed himself the head of resistance forces, and told the French people over the BBC in his famous L\u2019Appel du 18 Juin, \u201cHas the last word been said? Must hope disappear? Is Defeat final? No!\u201d\n\nThrough willpower, tenacity, and \u2013 yes \u2013 arrogance, de Gaulle managed to outflank opponents and became head of the French Provisional government. After the allies liberated Paris, de Gaulle refused dictatorial powers, then resigned in January 1946 because he would not participate in party struggles and believed the draft constitution for the Fourth Republic was fatally flawed.\n\nAfter twelve years of self-imposed exile from politics, de Gaulle returned to power at sixty-seven, after the Fourth Republic collapsed over the Algerian crisis. Rejecting all talk of a military coup, de Gaulle legally accepted emergency powers for six months from the National Assembly with the understanding that a new constitution with a strong executive branch would be put to a popular vote. On September 29, 1958, the new constitution, which stands to this day, passed with 78 percent of the vote. \u201cLe Grand Charles\u201d served as President of the Fifth Republic for ten years, reviving France\u2019s morale and economy.\n\nIn early 1968, Maoist-inspired French university students, at first only demanding co-ed dormitories, began a strike that was to spread all over France. A shocked de Gaulle, who viewed the insurrection as an eruption of pure anarchy intent on destroying civilization, declared \u201cReform, Yes; sheer disorder, No!\u201d Dissolving Parliament, de Gaulle described the choice in the next elections as between subversion or order.\n\nThe Gaullists won big. For the first time in French history a party gained a parliamentary majority. Ten months later, however, on April 28, 1969, de Gaulle resigned as president when voters rejected his proposed government reforms in a nation-wide referendum. He died two weeks shy of his eightieth birthday on November 9, 1970.\n\nResponding to journalists\u2019 questions on plans for European unity, de Gaulle said, \u201cThe spirit of Europe does not lie in coal and steel and tariffs and money. No, the spirit of Europe is the Europe of Dante and of Goethe and of Chateaubriand.\u201d As soldier, politician, national leader, and international statesmen, deGaulle rejected ideology as the foundation of modern nation states and understood, as Christopher Dawson put it, \u201cthat a society or culture which has lost its spiritual roots is a dying culture.\u201d Unlike the European secularists who created the E.U. constitution without acknowledging Europe\u2019s Christian roots, de Gaulle knew that Christianity shaped the continent\u2019s moral and cultural values and that a good European order must reflect that heritage. France, and the rest of the world, could do with a few more such \u201carrogant\u201d men."}, {"url": "https://the-american-catholic.com/2021/05/23/anne-de-gaulle-3/", "page_content": "(I wrote this post back in 2009.

She generated in him a warmth that he had seemed to be storing for his entire life just for her. He would dance little jigs for with her, do pantomimes, sing popular songs to her. During her brief life, he was the only person who could make her laugh.\n\nOne of de Gaulle\u2019s neighbours recalled how he used to walk with her hand-in-hand around the property, caressing her and talking quietly about the things she understood. She was, he said simply, \"My joy. She helped me overcome the failures in all men, and to look beyond them\u201d.\n\nThe de Gaulles fiercely protected Anne from the press and others. Her father forbade photographers from including any of his children in publicity shots taken at him home during the war years. He knew that the presence or absence of Anne would be sure to elicit comment. Other children teased her because she was different. But her pain was compounded because she did not know why she was different.\n\nIn 1948, Anne died of pneumonia, a month after her 20th birthday and died in her father's arms. At the conclusion of the brief graveside service, de Gaulle took his wife\u2019s hand and said \u201cCome, now she is like the others.\"\n\nOn 22 August 1962, Charles de Gaulle was the victim of an attempted assassination at Petit-Clamart. He later said that the potentially fatal bullet had been stopped by the frame of the photograph of Anne that he always carried with him, placed this particular day on the rear shelf of his car. When he died in 1970, he was buried in the cemetery of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises beside his beloved daughter.\n\nAnne could only say one word clearly in her entire life: 'Papa'"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/travel/charles-de-gaulle-london-history.html", "page_content": "With its bland architecture and gray concrete pavement, little distinguishes Curzon Square from its surroundings in the heart of London\u2019s Mayfair district. But it was here that Charles de Gaulle wrote a speech that would change his country\u2019s fate and, he believed, fulfill his destiny.\n\nOn June 17, 1940, still reeling from France\u2019s fall to Nazi Germany three days earlier, de Gaulle fled to London, where he borrowed a friend\u2019s apartment at 3 Curzon Square (then called Seamore Grove) and drafted a passionate call to arms. The next day he broadcast a message on BBC radio \u2014 a direct, clarion appeal to the French people:\n\n\u201cI, General de Gaulle, now in London, call on all French officers and men who are at present on British soil, or may be in the future, with or without their arms; I call on all engineers and skilled workmen from the armaments factories who are at present on British soil, or may be in the future, to get in touch with me.\u201d\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s initial broadcast reached only a few parts of occupied France. (Subsequent transmissions on June 19 and 22 reached greater swathes of Vichy territory.) But today, it is considered one of the most significant moments in French history, even honored with its own square in Paris, Place du 18 Juin 1940.\n\nImage De Gaulle in the BBC studios, broadcasting his call to arms to all French people on British soil.

Few know, however, how much strength he drew from his Down Syndrome daughter.\n\nWhen it comes to failed governments in our time, it\u2019s hard to ignore French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s administration. Hollande\u2019s record on basic issues like unemployment as well as his ineptness in the face of jihadist terrorism is so unimpressive that he declined to run for reelection. This, however, hasn\u2019t stopped his government from making the type of last-minute defiant gesture beloved of administrations whose days are numbered.\n\nIn Hollande\u2019s case, it has taken the form of effectively banning pro-life websites that don\u2019t explicitly identify themselves as pro-life. This follows a 2016 ruling by France\u2019s Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat endorsing a broadcasting tribunal\u2019s 2014 decision to prohibit a commercial portraying Down Syndrome children as joyful individuals loved by their parents because it might distress those who chose to terminate an unborn disabled child.\n\nReflecting upon these developments, I couldn\u2019t help thinking how much France owes to one particular Down Syndrome child: a young girl who struggled to speak, needed assistance to walk, and who died of pneumonia at the age of 20 cradled in her father\u2019s arms. Anne de Gaulle\u2019s father, however, was no ordinary man.\n\nCharles de Gaulle was surely the twentieth century\u2019s greatest Frenchman. Yet for all his achievements, the ultimate drama of de Gaulle\u2019s life was his helpless daughter. What Anne gave to him, however, was immeasurable. As de Gaulle confided to a priest at the beginning of his lonely crusade in 1940 to save France\u2019s honor, \u201cfor me, this child is a grace, she is my joy, she helps me to look beyond all the failures and honors, and always to look higher.\u201d\n\nUn enfant pas comme les autres\n\nCharles de Gaulle was an austere individual, one who consciously cultivated distance from others. 47 years after his death, however, we know much more about the private man. Thanks to the publication of memoirs, especially those of his son Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, the General emerges as a man who, like many French army officers of his background, found solace in his Catholic faith and a closely-knit family. We\u2019re also discovered that de Gaulle had a rich intellectual life which went far beyond politics. This went hand-in-hand with a wicked sense of humor which, in private, de Gaulle wasn\u2019t averse to using against himself.\n\nBy the time he reached his mid-30s, de Gaulle had settled into a milieu in which his faith, family and profession provided many of the certainties required for an ambitious man intent upon shaking up a political and military establishment committed to obsolete ideas. All this was shattered on 1 January 1928 when Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s third child was born. Within a few months, it became apparent that Anne was severely disabled.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that this was an era in which disabled children were neither seen nor heard in polite company. Down Syndrome children were referred to as \u201cmongols.\u201d Some even speculated that the condition resulted from alcoholism or some form of impropriety on the parents\u2019 part. It wasn\u2019t until 30 years after Anne de Gaulle\u2019s birth that another devout French Catholic, Professor Jerome Lejeune, and his research team discovered that Down Syndrome was caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21.\n\nIn the 1930s, it was common for French families to place disabled children permanently in hospitals that were woefully ill-equipped to care them. Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, however, refused to send Anne to live with, as he would say, \u201cstrangers.\u201d In de Gaulle\u2019s words, \u201cGod has given her to us. We must take responsibility for her, wherever she is and whatever she will be.\u201d In a way, de Gaulle\u2019s reaction to Anne\u2019s entry into his life foreshadowed the spirit of resistance expressed in his famous appeal of 18 June 1940 to Frenchmen to continue the war against Germany.\n\nThe de Gaulles worked hard to build a place for, to use de Gaulle\u2019s expression, \u201ca child who is not like the others\u201d in their family. From all accounts, Yvonne de Gaulle adopted a matter-of-fact approach. She focused on the practicalities of caring for a disabled child. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s contribution was to envelop Anne in a web of affection. According to his son, de Gaulle wanted to give Anne the assurance that he loved her just as much as her older brother and sister\u2014that her disability meant nothing to him.\n\nThe tall army officer infamous for his air of haughty disdain as leader of Free France during World War II and later as French President didn\u2019t hesitate to unbend to play on the floor with Anne. De Gaulle sang to Anne, told her stories, and even allowed her to play with one of his most treasured possessions: his officer\u2019s kepi hat. De Gaulle also said prayers with Anne in the evening. Painstakingly, she would repeat each word after her father. \u201cYou see,\u201d de Gaulle proudly informed his relatives, \u201cshe knows her prayers!\u201d\n\nWhen away on army business, de Gaulle constantly inquired about Anne\u2019s well-being. On one occasion, Anne had an operation while he was absent on maneuvers. De Gaulle telephoned incessantly to ask if she was in pain, whether the procedure had succeeded, what the doctors were saying, etc. Anne seems to have been aware of just how much she meant to her father. Her first governess recalled that Anne adored him and would be visibly upset when his responsibilities took de Gaulle away from his family.\n\nThough the de Gaulles valued their privacy, they didn\u2019t view Anne as an embarrassment. There are pictures of her standing awkwardly with members of the de Gaulles\u2019 extended family. Most striking, however, is a photo of Anne taken at a beach in Brittany in 1933. She is sitting on her father\u2019s lap. He, dressed in a homburg hat and three-piece suit, gently holds her hands as the five year-old girl looks intensely into her father\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s an image of unconditional love.\n\nWhile Anne lived, the de Gaulles took her everywhere with them. That included less-than-hospitable locations such as the French mandate in Syria and Lebanon. De Gaulle was posted there in 1929, partly because some of his superiors wanted to sideline an officer who asked awkward questions about France\u2019s readiness for the next war. There was, however, no question of leaving Anne behind. Instead she went with them, with the de Gaulles hiring a full-time governess to help them care for Anne in a Middle-Eastern country.\n\nFragility\u2014and Resistance\u2014in the face of Evil\n\nThere was, of course, a cost to all this. Though Charles de Gaulle came from a minor aristocratic family and his wife from an upper-middle class background, the de Gaulles were not wealthy. His modest army pay was their main source of income. Hiring full-time help was subsequently an enormous financial liability, but one they didn\u2019t hesitate to assume.\n\nThen there was the psychological burden. As Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s biographer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Neau-Dufour observes, Yvonne was an exuberant, even care-free young woman before Anne was born. After Anne\u2019s birth, that woman gradually disappeared. Yvonne became a much quieter, even somewhat withdrawn person who dreaded public appearances. This, however, didn\u2019t stop her from undertaking the extremely difficult task of successfully fleeing France with the profoundly disabled Anne in tow as the German Army swept across the country in May and June 1940.\n\nThis brings into focus another factor of which Charles de Gaulle was undoubtedly aware: how the National Socialist regime treated the disabled. Eugenics was part and parcel of the Nazi view of the world (and most Western liberal opinion for decades). And, as the Nazis made clear right from the beginning, the disabled had no place in a National Socialist world. They were lebensunwertes leben (life unworthy of life).\n\nStarting in September 1939, the Nazi government began removing Down Syndrome children and infants suffering from other disabilities from their parents. These children were taken to \u201chealth facilities\u201d and killed by lethal injection or gas poisoning. In the name of \u201cracial health\u201d and other eugenics nonsense, the regime murdered thousands of disabled children. Among them was a 15 year-old Down Syndrome cousin of the future pope, Joseph Ratzinger.\n\nThis would have been Anne de Gaulle\u2019s fate if she had ever fallen into Nazi hands. Although de Gaulle never referenced it specifically, it\u2019s likely that the brutal treatment of the disabled was one of the things he had in mind when referring to the evil of the Nazi regime. When de Gaulle refused to surrender in 1940 and was branded a traitor by France\u2019s political and military elites, it was certainly the act of an intensely patriotic man unwilling to accept his country\u2019s abasement by the Nazis. But de Gaulle\u2019s act of resistance also concerned safeguarding his defenseless daughter from those who viewed her as sub-human.\n\nLife after Death\n\nLike many Down Syndrome children, Anne de Gaulle died at an early age. Her brother Philippe recollects arriving at his parents\u2019 house in 1948 to find the entire residence immersed in silence. Noone, he writes, dared to say anything to his grief-stricken father. Anne was subsequently buried in the cemetery at the de Gaulles\u2019 parish church in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. After attending their regular Sunday Mass and always on the anniversary of her death, Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle would visit Anne\u2019s grave. 22 years after she died, her father was laid to rest beside Anne. Her mother joined them in 1979.\n\nThat, however, wasn\u2019t the end of the story. Back in October 1945, the de Gaulles raised enough money from private donors to buy the chateau de Vert-C\u0153ur in the department of Yvelines, not far from Paris. They then began creating a home for intellectually disabled girls. A few months after Anne\u2019s death, the Fondation Anne-de-Gaulle opened its doors at the chateau. Staffed by nuns, funded by the considerable royalties generated by de Gaulle\u2019s memoirs, and presided over by Yvonne de Gaulle until her death, the Foundation continues to serve the disabled today.\n\nOne of Charles de Gaulle\u2019s biographers, the late Jean Lacouture, records him as once saying, \u201cWithout Anne, I could never perhaps have done what I did. She gave me the heart and the inspiration.\u201d In that sense, the man of June 18 and his beloved pauvre petiteAnne teach us something which we are tempted to forget\u2014that all of us can find strength in weakness and that nothing is more powerful than self-giving love."}, {"url": "https://www.lihpao.com/de-gaulle-artist/", "page_content": "Introduction\n\nDe Gaulle Artist was an influential French painter and sculptor who had a lasting impact on the development of modern art.

Through his career, De Gaulle explored a wide range of themes, from personal reflections on identity to social and political issues.\n\nThis article will explore the life and work of De Gaulle, with a focus on his artistic style and influence on the art world. It will also examine the inspiration behind his work, as well as its impact on society. By the end of this article, readers should have a better understanding of De Gaulle\u2019s legacy and why he is still remembered as one of the great masters of modern art.\n\nExploring the Life and Work of De Gaulle Artist\n\nDe Gaulle was born in Paris in 1884. He studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts and later worked as an apprentice to several artists. In 1912, he held his first solo exhibition, which showcased his early experiments in cubism. After serving in World War I, De Gaulle began to explore more abstract forms of expression. He was heavily influenced by the work of Picasso, Matisse, and other modernist painters.\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s most notable works include \u201cThe Dance\u201d (1917), \u201cThe Lovers\u201d (1921), and \u201cThe Poet\u201d (1930). He also created numerous sculptures and murals throughout his career. His works often featured angular lines, bright colors, and dynamic compositions that evoked a sense of movement and emotion.\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s artistic style was heavily influenced by cubism, surrealism, and other modernist movements. He often used abstract shapes and unexpected juxtapositions to create a sense of tension and energy in his works. He was also known for his innovative use of materials, such as metal, wood, and stone, which he often combined with paint to create fascinating three-dimensional effects.\n\nA Retrospective of De Gaulle\u2019s Artistic Style\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s distinctive style can be seen in the elements he employed in his works. He often used curved lines to create a sense of dynamism and movement, while harsh angles and sharp edges gave his works a sense of tension and drama. He also favored bright colors, which he often layered and blended to create vivid, complex visual textures. In addition, De Gaulle frequently incorporated textural elements into his works, such as fabric, metal, and wood, to create a tactile experience for viewers.\n\nDe Gaulle was also known for his innovative techniques. He often used unconventional tools, such as brushes made from animal fur or sticks, to create unique textures. He was also a master of light and shadow, often using chiaroscuro to create dramatic contrasts in his works. Finally, De Gaulle was a master of composition, often playing with scale and perspective to create intriguing and unexpected visual effects.\n\nExamples of De Gaulle\u2019s style can be seen in his paintings \u201cThe Dance\u201d and \u201cThe Poet\u201d, both of which feature his signature use of bold colors and dynamic compositions. His sculpture \u201cThe Lovers\u201d is another example of his innovative use of materials and textures. All of these works demonstrate De Gaulle\u2019s mastery of color, form, and composition.\n\nThe Influence of De Gaulle on the Art World\n\nThe Influence of De Gaulle on the Art World\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s bold and expressive artwork had a major impact on contemporary art. His works inspired a generation of artists, who sought to emulate his use of vibrant colors and dynamic compositions. His influence can be seen in the works of many modern and contemporary artists, including Jean Dubuffet, Jackson Pollock, and Willem de Kooning.\n\nDe Gaulle also played a major role in the development of modern art. He was one of the first artists to embrace abstraction and non-traditional materials, paving the way for future generations of avant-garde artists. He was also an early proponent of the \u201cartist as philosopher\u201d movement, which sought to explore the relationship between art and society.\n\nA Closer Look at the Inspiration Behind De Gaulle\u2019s Work\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s art was deeply personal and often reflective of his own experiences and emotions. He was heavily influenced by his travels, particularly his visits to North Africa, where he was exposed to a wide range of cultures and art forms. He was also inspired by his encounters with other artists, such as Picasso and Matisse, whose works served as an important source of inspiration.\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s creative process was often improvisational and intuitive. He often worked without sketches or pre-determined plans, allowing the painting or sculpture to take shape organically. He also experimented with different mediums and techniques, often combining traditional and unconventional materials to create unique works of art.\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s work was also heavily informed by his personal relationships. He often used his artwork to explore and express his feelings about the people in his life. His paintings often featured portraits of family members and friends, as well as intimate scenes from everyday life.\n\nExamining the Impact of De Gaulle\u2019s Art on Society\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s works were not only aesthetically pleasing, but also socially relevant. His works often addressed issues of identity, race, gender, and class. He was particularly interested in exploring the struggles of the working class and their fight for equality and justice.\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s art has had a profound effect on public discourse. His works have sparked conversations about social issues and encouraged viewers to think critically about the world around them. His art has also been instrumental in advancing cultural understanding, as it serves as a bridge between different worlds and perspectives.\n\nConclusion\n\nDe Gaulle Artist was an innovative French painter and sculptor who left a lasting mark on the art world. His bold and expressive use of color and texture, combined with his unique approach to composition, created a distinctive and recognizable style. His works explored a wide range of themes, from personal reflections on identity to social and political issues. De Gaulle\u2019s art has had a major impact on contemporary art, inspiring a generation of artists and influencing the development of modern art.\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s legacy lives on through his artwork, which continues to captivate viewers and provoke conversation. His art encourages us to look beyond our immediate surroundings and to consider both the beauty and complexity of the world around us.\n\n(Note: Is this article not meeting your expectations?

Current Unrest in the Parisian Suburbs: Villiers-le-Bel, December 2007 [00:00:00]\n\nProfessor John Merriman: This is all relevant. What happened at Villiers-le-Bel was that you got your basic cop car, coming along, and it wasn\u2019t rolling aggressively, it was about fifty kilometers an hour, and these two young North-African extraction youths, without helmets, didn\u2019t yield to the car. They were on a scooter, sort of essentially a motorcycle, not a big one but a scooter. And, so, they hit the car on the left side and unfortunately they were both killed. And then the police stayed a bit and made calls but the calls that they made were more, \u201cwe have something spinning out of control,\u201d it\u2019s not about how are these two kids who \u2014 and you see, they left it there for two days, they circled it all away.\n\nSo, you still see these little guys\u2019 tennis shoes and you see \u2014 you can see traces of their having expired. And, so, Villiers-le-Bel, which is about eighteen kilometers north of Paris \u2014 it\u2019s near Roissy, it\u2019s near Sarcelles, where there was a lot of trouble before, it\u2019s near Gonesse; it\u2019s in the Val d\u2019Oise \u2014 went up in flames basically, and unfortunately a lot of people were hurt in the fighting. And yesterday they burned, somebody stupidly burned the library, and the library is not associated with the flics, with the cops, it\u2019s not associated with the State even, it is the municipal library where lots of kids go and study in the municipal library. And, so, this was just la connerie, this is not possible to do stuff like that. But, anyway, part of the problem is that Sarkozy denigrated the people in the suburbs as racaille, as scum, by implication, that \u2014 and was Minister of the Interior during the big troubles, a couple of years ago; which I\u2019m going to talk about on Wednesday, the troubles, which started in Clichy-sous-Bois.\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot of \u2014 in Toulouse where there had been trouble two years ago, now it\u2019s happening in Toulouse, too, but I didn\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019ll watch it this afternoon. It\u2019s a problem, it\u2019s going to be a big problem for awhile. And what makes it a little more scary is that this wasn\u2019t an incident, where there have been incidents where the police are \u2014 the police systematically control people of color, systematically, in France, systematically. I go through Barb\u00e8s-Rochechouart, which is a metro stop famous for the first place that somebody shot and killed a German officer during Vichy and \u2014 or the Gare de Lyon. I was in the Gare de Lyon, not the other day but at the end of November \u2014 or for that matter after Sarkozy was elected; you go to the Gare de Lyon metro stop and all of a sudden you turn the corner and then you\u2019ve got ten policemen there, controlling people.\n\nI\u2019ve lived \u2014 I\u2019ve spent half my life in France for the last thirty years. I have never been controlled, not once, not once. And I\u2019ve been with people going through, and you turn the corner, and all of a sudden you\u2019ve got all the police there. And who do they pick out? They don\u2019t pick out whites carrying little academic briefcases, they pick out everybody, practically, who is young and who is not white. And so this rubs people the wrong way, to say the least, and it\u2019s part of the way this works in the suburbs.\n\nAnd, so, this incident, which involved a police car, was not coming in and sort of saying \u201cup against the mall MF\u201d and all this but, \u201clet\u2019s see your papers.\u201d Because that\u2019s what happens, and I\u2019ve seen that happen. It was just unfortunately these two policemen \u2014 who weren\u2019t doing anything wrong, they were just \u2014 it was a banal trip through a banal suburb \u2014 happened to hit these two kids who were not wearing helmets and so they were killed. But this is \u2014 who knows what\u2019s going to happen in this. But this is part of when you see La Haine, hate, you see \u2014 that\u2019s the best translation simply of it is hatred or hate. And to understand how people in the suburbs feel you have to understand the relationship between both \u2014 and I\u2019m going to do this again, in more detail; I better get to what I\u2019m doing today. But that it\u2019s not just young people with not much of a future, it also is, mostly has to do with under-privileged and under-appreciated minorities pitted against the CRS, the national kind of military police, as well as the municipal police.\n\nAnd of course what the government of Chirac did was take away all the money virtually for voluntary associations that are bridges to helping integrate people into the communities in which they live and into the State in which they live. Butce n\u2019est pas \u00e9vident, comme on dit en fran\u00e7ais, it\u2019s just \u2014 oh, well, there we go. How did we get on that? We got on that because it\u2019s important to talk about. Allez.\n\nChapter 2. The Death of Charles de Gaulle: Legacy of French Nation [00:04:48]\n\nSo, today I\u2019m going to talk about Charles de Gaulle. In November 1970, \u00e7a passe vite, les temps, I was a student in Paris, just a little older than you, and living in an eleven-franc-a-night hotel, on rue Monsieur le Prince \u2014 that was about two dollars a night. My hotel room wasn\u2019t worth that, actually, but it was kind of an interesting place to live for \u2014 again, I was living in Limoges for a lot of the year too.\n\nI went to the Archives one day about \u2014 get there early, which I always do, and this little man who was a World War Two veteran who had lost most of his arm in the war, who would check my ID, but he knew me so there was no problem \u2014 my wife used to come in looking for me, when she was my wife, carrying our baby and the groceries, and it\u2019s all veryd\u00e9contract\u00e9, very informal; it\u2019s not that way any more. And he said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to close because the general, il est mort\u201d \u2014 the general is dead. And Charles de Gaulle died, had died. And I, I think, infuriated my Gaullist friend by saying that he died of boredom watching French TV; but he was off in Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises, and he had died at age \u2014 he must\u2019ve just been eighty; wasn\u2019t he eighty when he died, do you remember? You don\u2019t remember, but anyway I think he was eighty when he died.\n\nAnd, so, later my Gaullist friend, who\u2019s a lawyer, a Parisian lawyer, called me up and said, \u201clook, why don\u2019t we go down to Notre Dame and go to the Mass?\u201d De Gaulle didn\u2019t want to have a Mass, and I didn\u2019t particularly want to go down to Notre Dame and go to the Mass for Charles de Gaulle, but he said that it\u2019ll be \u2014 it\u2019s a historical event, we should be there, you should see it. And so I went down, we went down at three in the morning and waited in line, and then they\u2019d flown in all these people. Haile Selassie was there, that was kind of amazing to see Haile Selassie, and the odious Richard Nixon was there and all these leaders, with rather minimum security. This was not in a high security time. You could see people who were carrying machineguns up on the towers, you could see people in the cathedral up \u2014 I was about the only person anyone saw get frisked, going in. They looked at me and said we want to check you out; so they checked me out, with the long hair and all that.\n\nBut we got in there, and it was a moment of \u2014 as a moment of history, and it was something to see. His influence on French life and the memory of French life can hardly \u2014 the collective memory, of collective memory in French life, can hardly be underestimated; yet it was so long ago that he died, and the party that bore his name disappeared, that even if someone like Sarkozy or, before him, Jacques Chirac, would go to Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises, this village in the Haute-Marne, in the east of France, to have their picture taken in front of his tomb with the Croix de Lorraine \u2014 de Gaulle seems like a long time ago. But what he did in 1958 is of course to rescue the French State and to define, in his own personage, a certain idea of France that he represented.\n\nAnd to borrow a Catholic image, de Gaulle who was born in Lille, right near, as I said the other day, right near the fortress \u2014 Lille is a pretty Catholic town \u2014 he was not himself a practicing religious man, but I suppose it\u2019s a religious image that I somehow have retained in the back of my mind from the days at a good old Jesuit high school in Portland, Oregon, that he saw himself as the mystical body of France, that somehow the whole, that is his body, his personage, his very being, was bigger than all of the parts that constituted the body of France, and that he represented France with his very existence, and that this was how he wanted to be remembered. And when he leaves power in 1969, after a rather obscure election, plebiscite really, that that image still was retained.\n\nThere are really three elements that represented his image and the myth of Charles de Gaulle after World War Two. That he was the providential figure who through his own determination had saved France and its honor after the blowout of May/June 1940; that as his voice crackled over the BBC on the 18th of June, 1940, a date that\u2019s still commemorated every year when there\u2019s a Gaullist in power and a mayor of France such as Chirac there\u2019s always a little event to commemorate that; that he had restored the integrity of France. My friend Bob Paxton, as I reminded you the other day, argued that P\u00e9tain might have saved the French State but he did not save the French nation; he destroyed it by destroying liberty, fraternity, equality, and what that means.\n\nThat Charles de Gaulle had restored the integrity of France, had restored the sovereignty of French over their own political existence, which is obvious, and the republic itself, by being involved in the creation of the Fourth Republic, but then repudiating the way it was established, wanting centralized executive authority and all of that, and then would go off pouting to Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises. That he\u2019d then he\u2019d reunified the nation after the civil war that was Vichy. But, again, with a Gaullist twist is that everybody had basically resisted, or wanted to resist, that they were always ready with the gun nearby to go and kill the German when they could and to restore France, and that hardly anyone had collaborated. So, this was sort of the Gaullist take on this.\n\nChapter 3. De Gaulle and the Napoleons: The Republican Monarchy [00:11:22]\n\nAnd that he had restored the centralized state \u2014 not after World War Two, because the Fourth Republic was this sort of swinging door ministry; it\u2019s rather like the Third Republic \u2014 which as in the case of the Third Republic gave the illusion that French political life was more unstable than it was, because the deputies of the Fourth Republic, like the deputies of the Third Republic, it was a club where the same people were re-elected time and time again from the same constituencies. But de Gaulle\u2019s thing was that the only form of government that could restore the integrity of France and end the factions of parliamentary quarrels, and quarreling, and he hated the communists, of course, was a strongly centralized government. And for that he had to wait, as you now know, until cinquante-huit, until 1958, with a constitution written for him by Michel Debr\u00e9, who personified Gaullism itself, and whose son is an important figure in contemporary France.\n\nThis is very important for de Gaulle\u2019s view of France, is that he had freed France, in his mind, from the anarchy of political parties that were quarreling, a parliamentary government that he didn\u2019t think had worked, that was incapable of restoring the \u201cgrandeur\u201d of France \u2014 a word to which he returned constantly; more about that in awhile \u2014 strengthening the French state under a new constitution that \u2014 written by Debr\u00e9 \u2014 that gave France a strong executive with a president who would be in power for seven years, and who had strong executive authority.\n\nNow, those of you who know anything about France before 1871, if this doesn\u2019t sound like Napoleon, both N-I, Napoleon the First, and N-III, Napoleon the Third \u2014 it\u2019s an obvious thing to say, but it\u2019s still true \u2014 that in \u2014 there\u2019s no need you should know this, but some of you do \u2014 1799 on the 18th of Brumaire, Napoleon, with the help of the wily Abbe Sieyes, the priest, Sieyes, who wrote \u201cWhat is the Third Estate,\u201d overthrow the Assembly. Napoleon had a bit of a faltering and his brother Lucien helped him out there, because he lost \u2014 the only time in his life he really lost his courage \u2014 they overthrow the government and impose a consulate in which Napoleon becomes the first council and finally snatches the crown, it is thought, from the Pope and crowns himself emperor.\n\nAnd Napoleon adopts what would become the most Gaullist political strategy, shared by that of governments of North Korea, among other dictatorships, that is the plebiscite, where you ask people with a cagy question, \u201cDo you agree\u201d \u2014 for example, Napoleon III, just before the fall of the whole mess at the end of the 1860s, in 1870 there was a plebiscite, \u201cDo you agree with the reforms that have been undertaken by our glorious Emperor?\u201d et cetera, et cetera. If you write \u201cno,\u201d you\u2019re saying, \u201cwell, I don\u2019t really like reforms,\u201d and so therefore do you say \u201cyes\u201d because you like reforms or \u201cyes\u201d because you like Napoleon III? And, so, naturally the plebiscite is like a North Korean plebiscite where ninety-nine percent of the people say oui \u2014 that\u2019s what Napoleon III did after he overthrew the Second Republic.\n\nSo, there are strong continuities between Napoleon and the idea of a centralized state overcoming the sort of quarreling factions of France. And Napoleon I put an end to what was called, rather colorfully and an unfortunate phrase, but \u201cthe war of the chamber pots\u201d that was the French Directory, before this whole thing is overthrown. And, so, there\u2019s an appeal to the nation. And Napoleon was one of the originators of an aggressive kind of nationalism. But Napoleon was perceived as somebody on the Left. Napoleon III, before he was Napoleon III, in 1841, wrote a little pamphlet called \u201cProperty,\u201d about property, called \u201cThe Extinction of Pauperism\u201d; and the idea that somehow the caring State cares about all people in France and that all people in France find part of their identity in the notion of being French.\n\nAnd as you already know from things we\u2019ve talked about, that part of nationalism was this sort of aggressive carrying of the French language into corners in which it was not spoken, or spoken only as a second way of speaking, language, dialect, patois, et cetera, et cetera. So, the idea of a national will represented in the body of a strong executive authority is a Napoleonic idea that became part of the political existence of de Gaulle, and ultimately of Gaullism. But you had to have the idea of it being ratified by the people \u2014 thus plebiscites. Now, P\u00e9tain, the difference is that P\u00e9tain in World War Two, the \u201cnational revolution,\u201d in quotes, with the Marshall \u2014 again the military connection, Napoleon, P\u00e9tain, as he saw it, and de Gaulle \u2014 it was never ratified by any kind of popular vote because it was an even more authoritarian government under Vichy.\n\nThe 1920s and the \u201930s, and the first half of the 1940s, was the wave of authoritarianism that cost the lives of so many millions of people, I need not remind you. And that Bonapartism, as in Gaullism, involved the kind of stamp of popular approval seen in the plebiscites of 1958, and in subsequent plebiscites. And he goes out in 1969, after he loses \u2014 they lose the plebiscite. On January 18th \u2014 no, I must\u2019ve written this wrong, it must be the dix-huit de juin, it must be June 18th, 1940 \u2014 he says \u201cI\u201d \u2014 he often said \u201cwe,\u201d the royal \u201cwe,\u201d but in this case he said \u201cI,\u201d because he wasn\u2019t yet running the show \u2014 \u201cI, General de Gaulle, French soldier and leader, am conscious that I am speaking in the name of France\u201d \u2014 that I represent France; again the mystical body.\n\nMichel Debr\u00e9 \u2014 again d-e-b-r-e \u2014 who wrote this constitution of \u201858, said that the only chance for French democracy, if that term may be used, is to have a republican monarch, and that was the Gaullist view of de Gaulle. And he resigns on the 20th of June, 1946, and the Fourth Republic comes into existence without him. Now, when he returns to power, in \u201858, it was after \u2014 because of the chaos of what was happening in Algeria that republican institutions seemed to have been discredited. And, so, he has the upper hand there to identify himself with the strongly centralized French state. It was clear in 1958, as it had been clear with Napoleon \u2014 but this is a different case \u2014 Napoleon I, that it was only de Gaulle at that moment who could impose discipline on the French Army; thus the howls of betrayal when the other generals say he\u2019s going to let Algeria become free.\n\nAnd thus the sense of betrayal, and they try to kill him. And, so, but for all of his verbal \u2014 his respect for and endorsement of popular sovereignty, but his tool of State is really often the plebiscite, which you can argue is sort of a sham tool of democracy. What he does \u2014 and reflecting the fact that the 1880s and the 1890s are the period of mass politics when the first political parties are created. Napoleon I and Napoleon III did not create political parties. Political parties did not exist in France; they existed, the Whigs and the Tories existed in England already, but that is a long, complicated story that starts with the run up to the English Civil War at the middle of the seventeenth century.\n\nBut he creates a political party that will support him, and his support, the people, a lot of the people who were Gaullists in the late 1940s were part of what is called the MRP, or whatever, the big mass Catholic political party which was extremely conservative. But he \u2014 the essence of this was strongly centralized authority. Did he consciously pattern himself after the Napoleons, or after Boulanger for that matter? He\u2019d been born in 1890, in Lille, but brought up in \u2014 I think he was born in Lille, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve seen this house in which I thought he was born, in Lille, but he was brought up in Paris. He loved the Arc de Triomphe and he loved Invalides, which is where Napoleon is buried.\n\nI\u2019ve got to just give you one small story, which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve related. There is a famous American tennis player who the first time this tennis player was in the French Open, which is sponsored the Banque Nationale de Paris, they took this tennis player on a tour of Paris, and that tour got kind of old for this particular player; after about an hour and a half this person had seen enough. And then finally they said, some journalists said, \u201cwhat do you like best about what you saw in Paris?\u201d and the tennis player said, \u201cOh, I really liked the tomb with the little dead dude;\u201d and the little dead dude is of course Napoleon, and that image is still\u2026\n\nNapoleon\u2019s tomb, which you see from above, you can\u2019t see in the tomb, it\u2019s not like when you\u2019re looking at Lenin or something but \u2014 is a massive tourist draw, and that is something that\u2019s always happened, that\u2019s always been the case since then. He was a lecturer at the Military College of Saint-Cyr, near Paris, and he lectured on Napoleon\u2019s military campaigns and particularly that of 1805. When he organized the French Free Forces in North Africa in \u201841 he referred to Napoleon\u2019s campaigns that he\u2019d studied very carefully. But he knew also that because the French Constitution had been written \u2014 that is the Third Republic, end of the Fourth Republic \u2014 had been written reflecting the fear of people like Napoleons, the Napoleons, of Caesarism, that he realized that that was always a possibility and always spoke highly of things like popular sovereignty.\n\nHe always used a kind of appeals to the French masses that Napoleon himself had done so effectively \u2014 more about that in a minute, and his sort of plunging into the crowds, to the horror of his guards. Something happened when Gorbachev came to the United States, and Gorbachev was such an impressive person and such an under-appreciated great man. And Gorbachev just shocked his guards by getting out of the big, black limousine near the mall in Washington and sort of plunging and giving high-fives, the Russian equivalents of high-fives, to people in the crowd, where the guards were just scared to death because we had lost a Kennedy and all this, two Kennedys, indeed, and because of security issues. And de Gaulle who had survived these various assassination attempts, and one in which, as I said, just this huge man, this car which is riddled by machineguns, a couple of guys firing in Clamart, and he escapes absolutely unscathed.\n\nNapoleon was only wounded three times, very lightly. Napoleon seemed to have this view that comes out of saintly romantic battling figures in the medieval times that they were \u2014 that God had made them immune to physical danger, and that if somebody fired in the seventeenth century a bullet at such a person that they could catch the bullet, as if Superman or some ridiculous video thing, catch them in their teeth. But part of this is the popular appeal of this man who was full of famous things that he said. But he never intended it as witticisms; the man had virtually no sense of humor. He\u2019s a cynic but a very smart man. But he\u2019s probably best remembered for saying, \u201chow can you possibly run a country\u201d \u2014 I don\u2019t think he used the word rule, that would\u2019ve been a mistake, that would\u2019ve been lapsing to the royal we, which he used constantly \u2014 \u201cHow can you run a country that has 268 different kinds of cheese? It\u2019s all so complex.\u201d\n\nIn fact, there are many more than 268 kinds of cheese; there\u2019s probably 268 different kinds of picodons, which are small goats\u2019 cheeses produced in the southeast of France and in other places. But what organized all this stuff together in his thinking is that France cannot be France without grandeur, without grandeur.\n\nChapter 4. Maintaining French Greatness in the Cold War World: Third World Influence and Military Independence [00:26:03]\n\nSo, one of the compelling aspects of his existence was that how you keep a power, that is no longer really a great power, in a world that had been divided among two great powers, how you keep a diminished great power a great power, how do you do that? So, there were two ways, very vehemently anti-communist through the whole thing, but more realistic than the Americans, always more realistic than the Americans \u2014 and this we\u2019ll tie together in a minute.\n\nTwo ways: one is that you maintain this forceful independence vis-\u00e0-vis the Americans and the Soviets. The clash of these two civilizations, both with their monumental exaggerations and both with their monumental problems; the Americans\u2019 problems less bloody than the traditions in the Soviet Union \u2014 how do you do that? So, you become independent, you leave NATO, you throw the Americans out; thus these huge airbases that were once full of American planes, full of American Air Force people and soldiers in Chateauroux and all these places \u2014 I mentioned this before \u2014 now empty, just big parking lots essentially. You can still see them all over the place. Or Lyon, there\u2019s another good one.\n\nYou\u2019re independent, and you insist on having the force de frappe, force, like force, and then de, d-e, and then frappe, f-r-a-p-p-e; and frappe, it sounds like something that\u2019s served at Coffee Too or Starbucks, but it is the nuclear capacity. And, so, France is going to be independent, it\u2019s going to have nuclear capacity. The Americans had the atomic bomb, the Soviet Union had the atomic bomb. The Americans had used an atomic bomb. The Israelis probably did not yet have the atomic bomb but soon would, and India would later and the Pakistanis and as you know the Chinese, as well.\n\nSo, that leads to point number two, that is by being independent and by being French, that you maintain your influence in places even as they are being decolonized \u2014 places like Mali, for example, or Senegal, or ex-Zaire, the Congo, which was the awful Leopold\u2019s private territory before the Belgian parliament took it over at the end of the nineteenth century, the beginning of the twentieth century, because of just the massacres, the slaughter of local people by sort of Belgian mercenary types, and all of this; that these places, that even after Algeria, and before that Morocco and Tunisia, become independent that the influence of la belle France in places like Vietnam, after the French leave, because of French civilization, the civilizing mission, the French language \u2014 Lebanon, another very good example, French influence in Lebanon, terribly, terribly important.\n\nAnd that this kind of influence, a cultural influence and a political influence of being an honest broker between these two big colossal powers will help accentuate France\u2019s existence as a great power, continued to exist as a great power. But there was a contradiction there because France was no longer a great power, but wanted to be a great power. And, so, that was essential in the way that de Gaulle viewed France\u2019s role and personally his role; that France would maintain its influence in what they called in those days the Third World, tiers monde, that were \u2014 had just been freed from the colonial imperial experience but were economically disadvantaged. And that France\u2019s historical mission of carrying civilization, French civilization, the civilizing mission, et cetera, et cetera, would continue in that context.\n\nNow, you even saw this very recently in the case of the Bulgarian nurses who had been in Libya accused of \u2014 it\u2019s a terribly complicated case \u2014 of infecting Libyan children with HIV, and who had been condemned to death and had been in prison for I don\u2019t remember how long. And one of the first things that Sarkozy does is he sends his wife, who\u2019s no longer his wife, to Libya to use the influence, that old French influence, in the Middle East to obtain the release of these Bulgarian nurses. And indeed they were able to pull that off. I think one of the nurses was Palestinian but I think the other ones were Bulgarian, I\u2019m sure they were Bulgarian; I\u2019m not sure about the Palestinian but I think so. And it works. But this is an idea that we can be there, we can intervene in these cases and get things happened because of that.\n\nAnd no one \u2014 if you travel in Africa and in Francophone countries, nobody should have any illusion about the continued influence of France in these places; and it is very, very important, and this is something that de Gaulle believed very much. He feared the domination of Europe and France by Britain and the United States, using NATO as a tool. And, so, you can argue now that Europe, quote/unquote Europe, the European Union, the European community and all this stuff, that the basis of this lies certainly in what would\u2019ve seemed in the 1920s and the \u201930s, or for that matter the 1880s and \u201990s, a horribly unusual alliance between Germany and France. And de Gaulle moves in that direction.\n\nAnd, so, that is a way of \u2014 working against is the wrong term \u2014 but sort of circumventing the kind of domination of the U.S. and of Britain in all of this. And what he helps do \u2014 and this is very important \u2014 is it ends all that animosity between Germany and France. I can remember going up to the Normandy beaches, the Norman beaches, and try waiting in there \u2014 imagine all these people shooting at you on the 6th of June, 1944 when you go to Omaha Beach, or Utah Beach, or one of these places, and it\u2019s full of Americans going there; it\u2019s full of very old Americans going there, to see where they had lost a lot of friends. But I remember going there with German plates \u2014 this is in the early 1970s \u2014 and still getting stares and insults, that I could understand perfectly well; they thought we were German, and we weren\u2019t, we were your age and just kind of traveling around, and sleeping on beaches, and eating a little, and drinking some wine along the way, and all that stuff.\n\nBut de Gaulle helped put an end to that, and now if you ask almost anybody, if you ask one of the Germans going into Strasbourg to buy foie gras, or all the French going over to Germany to buy what is slightly cheaper gasoline, this is an alliance, and a cornerstone of Europe, particularly given the attitude of the British and all the anxieties that they have about losing their integrity, national integrity, of losing the pound and all that stuff. And, so, de Gaulle helped make that possible. He never forgot the humiliation of France having been excluded from the Allied conferences at Yalta and Potsdam. You\u2019ve all seen those pictures of Stalin with Churchill and sometimes Roosevelt as well. But France was not invited.\n\nBoth Roosevelt and Churchill just hated de Gaulle\u2019s guts, they hated his arrogance. And he was not a person who lacked confidence, and he was not rigolo, he was not a good-time guy. His own family, by the way, his own family vous-vous-ed him, his children did. They didn\u2019t use tu they used vous \u2014 that\u2019s amazing. And they hated him, they had contempt for him. And de Gaulle never forgot those personal humiliations and the humiliations that la France, great power, was not invited to participate in essentially the fate of Europe. And, so, that leads to 1966, France withdrawing from NATO by forcing it to transfer its headquarters from Paris to Bruxelles, to Brussels, and these army and air force bases in France were closed; and armed forces radio was moved away, so it became more difficult to listen to football games on armed forces radio because you had to get them from Frankfurt, which is an extraordinarily minor point.\n\nAnd again he insisted on the development of an arsenal that was nuclear. And he angered the U.S. government by refusing to support the U.S. policies in Vietnam. And of course the French had already seen how stupid policies lead to bad results. But the Americans did not see that, for a very long time, until 70,000 American soldiers and God-knows how many people in Vietnam died in all of this. He outraged \u2014 and I remember this; I wasn\u2019t in Quebec \u2014 but he went to Quebec on a state visit, and he suddenly blurts out, \u201clong live free Quebec!\u201d And, so, this caused all sorts of problems. This was in the late \u2014 it was about 1967, if I remember correctly.\n\nWhy free Quebec? Because Quebec is nouvelle France, and that\u2019s where you had 60,000 French men, women, and children living. At the time there were 2.5 million English people living in what was the colonies in the U.S., and a very one-sided war. But again the idea that if Quebec is free, if it\u2019s independent \u2014 my own personal view is it ought to be independent; \u00e7a n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec. But it\u2019s just my feeling, but I don\u2019t know enough about it to say that\u2019s a good idea, but I have the same kind of cultural feelings that he does about it. But this is not what you do, you do not go on a state visit and suddenly announce \u201clong live Quebec!\u201d Americans, this is the same thing, if somebody came from, I don\u2019t know, a Serb ambassador or an Italian prime minister suddenly arrives and says, \u201clong live free New Mexico and Texas!\u201d or something like that \u2014 people didn\u2019t view it very well.\n\nBut although he was vehemently anti-communist, he did not want \u2014 he saw himself as again this honest broker in negotiating between these powers. His legacy were of these imperatives that he had; they were backed by deeds or at least attempts to restore the grandeur of France, its efficient, kind of active independence, as I guess Stanley Hoffmann called it that once. And this diverged from other parts of the French Right \u2014 Le Figaro magazine, for example, which is always just almost comically pro-American on every issue. The French Right couldn\u2019t \u2014 what de Gaulle did is he took the nationalism of Napoleons, the Napoleons, which was a nationalism associated with the general liberal Left \u2014 the State will do good things for people \u2014 he transforms that in the evolution that you see in the Third Republic, the nationalism, moving to the nationalism of the Right, into the equivalent of the Sacred Union of World War One, into a nationalism, fundamentally a nationalism of the Right in France.\n\nAnd part of that, to make a long story short, as you already have seen, is based upon his anti-communism. But at the same time you have all this business about grandeur and glory, et cetera, et cetera \u2014 grandeur more than glory; but inattention to \u2014 even at the end of what\u2019s called the glorious thirty years, the French economy takes off, that you\u2019ve read about \u2014 inattention to how you modernize France, how you make it more economically competitive, and what do you do about the education system, the university system in particular? And that would come crashing down on his head in 1968. So, his deeds, his legacy in \u2014 I\u2019ve already said I think what there is to say about the practical consequences of his legacy. But he did, France\u2019s influence did remain, has remained in the world, which I think is a very good thing.\n\nChapter 5. A Man above: The Stylistic Unity of de Gaulle [00:39:32]\n\nBut the most, the greatest legacy that he left is probably his style, that of the monarchical president, the monarchial president, the king of the republic, the idea that he represented France in a way that the Sun King had represented France, towering over France, and that overriding the interests of those he considered to be talkers, mere posers or talkers, including technocrats, the kinds of people who had emerged in part out of World War Two and out of the Fourth Republic. And, so, he left unsolved the question of how you educate France for a new society, how you train and modernize people. What do you do with the poisonous relations between a very powerful patronat, that is employers, and a working class that in the 1960s was still extremely influenced by the CGT, the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Travail, and by the Communist Party?\n\nSo, there were contradictions in all of this, the idea that France is a great power when France still \u2014 France wasn\u2019t yet a great power. The idea that France can be independent and therefore maintain itself as a great power by intervening, in terms of its cultural influence, its political influence in the Third World and that sort of thing. And the reality, when push came to shove, that there were two great powers. So, it kind of, the contradictions are there. He said over and over again that he was not of the Left nor of the Right; he was above the Left or the Right \u2014 he used the \u201cabove\u201d word, the word \u201cabove\u201d all the time. He said \u201cje suis un homme de la guerre de quatorze/dix-huit\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m a man of the War of 1914-1918; he was wounded on Belgian Bridge in Dinant, as I said the other day.\n\nAnd that was the Sacred Union, when in the interests of France these quarreling fragments would give up their quarrels with each other and would rally around big France \u2014 that France\u2019s historical mission was so especially said on the 11th of December, 1969, \u201cI don\u2019t want to repose, I don\u2019t want to even triumph, I want to bring people together.\u201d He saw his own party as being above these. He said that the parties \u2014 in 1965 \u2014 he said parties are organizations constituted to show off particular tendencies and to support the interests of such and such categories of people, or interests, or desires, and all this stuff, time and time again. But he wasn\u2019t just someone who was going to pronounce foolishly, revert to the same eventually tired phrases, he was somebody who believed that he could pay particular attention to circumstances. In this he was rather like Bismarck, and saw himself in that way, I think it\u2019s possible to argue.\n\nIn this maybe he saw himself a little bit, though I hate to make the comparison, but maybe with Henry Kissinger a little bit too, in the old days. But one of the results of the way he viewed France is that he didn\u2019t really give a damn about the existence of ordinary people. He once said that \u2014 he said this literally \u2014 \u201csteak frites,\u201d that is steak with French fries, \u201cis okay, it\u2019s fine, but it does not add up to national ambition\u201d; that\u2019s an exact quote. And the business of how do you bring together, how do you retain the importance of a people with 268 kinds of cheese, was a part of all of that. And, so, his style was more original than his doctrine.\n\nTake the press conference \u2014 he used to have press conferences. American presidents often have press conferences, though the current one really doesn\u2019t because the questions get too difficult to handle. But de Gaulle wasn\u2019t one for press conferences, he hated them, he couldn\u2019t stand them. But the press conferences in the old day were orchestrated, they were appearances. They were not a rock concert appearance, but they were appearances nonetheless, in which the questions had been planted. It was rather like FEMA, whatever they called it \u2014 did an amazing thing just a couple of weeks in California, they planted \u2014 the people in the room weren\u2019t reporters they were FEMA employees, and they presented it as a press conference where one guy raised his hand and he said, \u201cwhy is FEMA doing such a remarkable job this time around?\u201d And then the guy says, \u201cwell, I think we\u2019re very doing well, thank you for saying that.\u201d It turned out that he was an employee of FEMA and there weren\u2019t real journalists there.\n\nBut de Gaulle would do the same thing except he would do it with real journalists; he wouldn\u2019t do it with Helen Thomas, who was a wonderful person. I once had her as a guest at the tea in Branford; she was always able to ask the first question \u2014 I don\u2019t think this is the case anymore \u2014 because she was the senior person. But you had real journalists, but they were told what questions to ask, and then he would say \u2014 he would give the same kinds of responses that I just said \u2014 \u201csteak-frites do not end up with national ambition.\u201d At the time of the Algerian War somebody forgot to ask a question about Ben Bella. So, he said \u2014 he suddenly looks up and says, \u201cdid I hear somebody ask a question about Ben Bella?\u201d And then he gives the response, but he turns and reads a response that had already been written for him, and sometimes by him. And, so, it was the kind of style.\n\nSo, appearances were important, the idea that somehow this mystical body was connected in a real way to all of you, by national glory. And when he would go to any town, and he liked doing that, he would go and he would say, \u201cas I stand in the shadow of your magnificent cathedral,\u201d or \u201cnext to your smiling river\u201d \u2014 French rivers are always described as smiling, even if they\u2019re polluted, by politicians. \u201cI am thinking of you, and seeing you here, here to welcome me, your hearts beating just as mine for France and its grandeur and its civilization, I am reminded that\u201d \u2014 and then he launches into his two or three minute bit. And then he is in the big limousine and out of Lussac-les-Deux-Eglises or wherever it is.\n\nAnd it all was like that, where style increasingly overwhelmed substance, and in a man who was extremely elderly, but by no means, by no means senile, not one bit, and who could still treat with contempt anybody who came and told him something he didn\u2019t want to hear \u2014 but could be charming as well \u2014 the stage was set for his departure, as time moved on. And that would swirl around the events of 1968, la revolution manqu\u00e9e, the revolution that didn\u2019t really happen in France and involved an awful lot of people of your age. And it\u2019s to that, after I hope a glorious weekend, that I will return on Monday.\n\n[end of transcript]"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-de-Gaulle-president-of-France", "page_content": "Top Questions What were Charles de Gaulle\u2019s accomplishments? Charles de Gaulle led the Free French forces in resisting capitulation to Germany during World War II and became provisional president of France in the immediate aftermath of the war. Later he was an architect of the Fifth Republic and was president from 1959 to 1969. When did Charles de Gaulle become famous? Charles de Gaulle was undersecretary of state for defense and war when Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain took over the government of France with the intention of signing an armistice with Adolf Hitler. De Gaulle left for London, where, on June 18, 1940, he broadcast an appeal to his countrymen to continue to fight under his leadership. What were Charles de Gaulle\u2019s policies as president of France? Charles de Gaulle was determined that France should be treated as one of the great powers and not fall under the sway of any other country, particularly the United States. To that end, he made France a nuclear power, withdrew France from the military command of NATO, and followed his own views on foreign policy. When did Charles de Gaulle lose power? Charles de Gaulle lost power twice. He resigned as provisional president in 1946 because he opposed political parties forming the Fourth Republic, and, when his own movement failed to gain a majority, he retired from politics in 1953. The second time, voters rejected his proposed reforms, and he resigned as president in 1969.\n\nCharles de Gaulle, in full Charles Andr\u00e9 Joseph Marie de Gaulle, (born November 22, 1890, Lille, France\u2014died November 9, 1970, Colombey-les-deux-\u00c9glises), French soldier, writer, statesman, and architect of France\u2019s Fifth Republic.\n\nEducation and early career De Gaulle was the second son of a Roman Catholic, patriotic, and nationalist upper-middle-class family. The family had produced historians and writers, and his father taught philosophy and literature; but, as a boy, de Gaulle already showed a passionate interest in military matters. He attended the Military Academy of Saint-Cyr, and in 1913, as a young second lieutenant, he joined an infantry regiment commanded by Colonel Philippe P\u00e9tain. De Gaulle was an intelligent, hardworking, and zealous young soldier and, in his military career, a man of original mind, great self-assurance, and outstanding courage. In World War I he fought at Verdun, was three times wounded and three times mentioned in dispatches, and spent two years and eight months as a prisoner of war (during which time he made five unsuccessful attempts to escape). After a brief visit to Poland as a member of a military mission, a year\u2019s teaching at Saint-Cyr, and a two-year course of special training in strategy and tactics at the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure de Guerre (War College), he was promoted by Marshal P\u00e9tain in 1925 to the staff of the Supreme War Council. From 1927 to 1929 de Gaulle served as a major in the army occupying the Rhineland and could see for himself both the potential danger of German aggression and the inadequacy of the French defense. He also spent two years in the Middle East and then, having been promoted to lieutenant colonel, spent four years as a member of the secretariat of the National Defense Council. De Gaulle\u2019s writing career began with a study of the relations between the civil and military powers in Germany (La Discorde chez l\u2019ennemi, 1924; \u201cDiscord Among the Enemy\u201d), followed by lectures on his conception of leadership, Le Fil de l\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e (1932; The Edge of the Sword). A study on military theory, Vers l\u2019arm\u00e9e de m\u00e9tier (1934; The Army of the Future), defended the idea of a small professional army, highly mechanized and mobile, in preference to the static theories exemplified by the Maginot Line, which was intended to protect France against German attack. He also wrote a memorandum in which he tried, even as late as January 1940, to convert politicians to his way of thinking. His views made him unpopular with his military superiors, and the question of his right to publish under his name a historical study, La France et son arm\u00e9e (1938; France and Her Army), led to a dispute with Marshal P\u00e9tain. Britannica Quiz Pop Quiz: 17 Things to Know About World War II\n\nWorld War II At the outbreak of World War II, de Gaulle commanded a tank brigade attached to the French Fifth Army. In May 1940, after assuming command as temporary brigadier general in the 4th Armoured Division\u2014the rank that he retained for the rest of his life\u2014he twice had the opportunity to apply his theories on tank warfare. He was mentioned as \u201can admirable, energetic, and courageous leader.\u201d On June 6 he entered the government of Paul Reynaud as undersecretary of state for defense and war, and he undertook several missions to England to explore the possibilities of continuing the war. When the Reynaud government was replaced 10 days later by that of Marshal P\u00e9tain, who intended to seek an armistice with the Germans, de Gaulle left for England. On June 18 he broadcast from London his first appeal to his compatriots to continue the war under his leadership. On August 2, 1940, a French military court tried and sentenced him in absentia to death, deprivation of military rank, and confiscation of property. De Gaulle entered his wartime career as a political leader with tremendous liabilities. He had only a handful of haphazardly recruited political supporters and volunteers for what were to become the Free French Forces. He had no political status and was virtually unknown in both Britain and France. But he had an absolute belief in his mission and a conviction that he possessed the qualities of leadership. He was totally devoted to France and had the strength of character (or obstinacy, as it often appeared to the British) to fight for French interests as he saw them with all the resources at his disposal.

Broadcasts from London, the action of the Free French Forces, and the contacts of resistance groups in France either with de Gaulle\u2019s own organization or with those of the British secret services brought national recognition of his leadership; but full recognition by his allies came only after the liberation of Paris in August 1944. Henri Giraud, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Charles de Gaulle, and Winston Churchill; Casablanca Conference In London de Gaulle\u2019s relations with the British government were never easy, and de Gaulle often added to the strain, at times through his own misjudgment or touchiness. In 1943 he moved his headquarters to Algiers, where he became president of the French Committee of National Liberation, at first jointly with General Henri Giraud. De Gaulle\u2019s successful campaign to edge out Giraud gave the world proof of his skill in political maneuvering."}, {"url": "https://mercatornet.com/charles-de-gaulle/77769/", "page_content": "The greatest leaders demand the greatest attention from any would-be biographer.\n\nCharles de Gaulle belongs to the highest echelons of history\u2019s statesmen. For writing the acclaimed biography A Certain Idea of France, published in 2018, Julian Jackson deserves recognition in the highest echelons of historians, in the company of Robert Caro, Andrew Roberts and few others.\n\nHis subject\u2019s life spanned 80 years, which encapsulated heroic service in the First World War, intense historic study and extraordinary prescience in the decades following it, a rise to the position of national saviour in the wake of France\u2019s collapse in 1940, the country\u2019s liberation from the Nazis, de Gaulle\u2019s self-imposed exile and triumphant return, not to mention the creation of the Fifth (and still enduring) French Republic.\n\nVisionary leader\n\nDe Gaulle opened his memoirs by writing that he had \u201calways had a certain idea of France,\u201d and over the course of 944 pages, Jackson brilliantly describes what this idea was, and how the deeply conservative de Gaulle managed to steer the nation through periods of rapid change, while still holding to this vision.\n\nJackson\u2019s book contributes enormously to our understanding of a captivating figure. One of the many accomplishments is building on the work of earlier writers by demolishing the view that the General\u2019s Catholicism was incidental to his character and actions.\n\nDevout Catholic\n\nA throwaway remark by de Gaulle that he was \u201cCatholic by history and geography,\u201d coupled with a tendency to appear distracted during Mass, has occasionally been taken to imply that de Gaulle\u2019s Catholicism was merely cultural.\n\nJackson tears this viewpoint apart. Of his family background, there can be no doubt. As a teenager, de Gaulle served as a stretcher bearer in Lourdes, and after the Great War, the entire de Gaulle family returned together in pilgrimage to honour a promise Madame de Gaulle had made if all four of her sons were to survive the conflict.\n\nBoth of Charles\u2019s parents were devout. In one illuminating anecdote, the scholarly monarchist Henri de Gaulle chastised his officer son for praising the skills of a general of the French Revolution.\n\nOne of the many secrets of de Gaulle\u2019s extraordinary rise lay in his cultivation of a broader sense of French patriotism which could include those who did not share his family\u2019s religion and monarchism, but there can be no doubting de Gaulle\u2019s lifelong commitments to those beliefs. Again and again, Jackson shows this side of him to the reader.\n\nWriting to the philosopher Jacques Maritain about how some Catholics had embraced the Vichy regime, de Gaulle acknowledged that \u201cthe bishops have behaved badly, but there are good cur\u00e9s, simple priests, who are saving us.\u201d\n\nIn the 1960s, like many French conservatives, de Gaulle expressed suspicion about the reforms underway in the Church. \u201cThere are always people who want to go so fast that they destroy everything. I\u2019m not sure that the Church was right to suppress processions and the Latin service. It is always wrong to give the impression of denying oneself and being ashamed of what one is. How can you expect others to believe in you when you do not believe in yourself?\u201d he asked.\n\nLoving father\n\nThe clearest example of de Gaulle\u2019s piety was not shown in words however, but in how he responded to the birth of his daughter Anne, who had Down Syndrome. At the time when societal prejudice led most families to place such children in institutions, the de Gaulles would not hear of this, in spite of the severity of her condition which meant she could not speak, and only learned to walk at the age of 10.\n\nInstead, the taciturn military man developed a uniquely strong relationship with his youngest child, walking slowly hand in hand with her in the botanical garden after finishing work and spending hours speaking to her.\n\nAs is always the case, greatness and goodness went hand in hand. It was as if a man who maintained a distance from all around him knew instinctively that he must be forever close to the daughter who needed him most, \u201cthe one person who perhaps was not in awe of him,\u201d as Jackson observes.\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s words to a military chaplain in 1940 gave an insight into what Anne meant to this normally icy titan: \u201cHer birth was a trial for my wife, and for myself, but believe me, Anne is my joy and my strength. She is the grace of God in my life. She has kept me in the security of obedience to the sovereign will of God.\u201d\n\nWhen Anne died at the age of 20, the cur\u00e9 found de Gaulle collapsed in grief. \u201cFrom Heaven, let little Anne protect us,\u201d de Gaulle wrote, in a letter to his surviving daughter.\n\nFille a\u00een\u00e9e de l\u2019\u00c9glise\n\nReligion bound de Gaulle to his family\u2019s past and that of his nation. On his last day, November 9th 1970, de Gaulle wrote to thank a friend for sending him a genealogy of his family tree, and noted the two strands of their identity which were of greatest importance, writing that \u201c[i]t is pleasing to see in all of them, dead and alive, such depths of courage and fidelity to religion and to the fatherland.\u201d\n\nFor de Gaulle, the connection between France and Catholicism was obvious. He often spoke of his nation\u2019s 1,500 years of history, beginning with the baptism of Clovis.\n\nDuring the First World War, he expressed dismay at the Pope\u2019s neutrality in a conflict which pitted his country against the Ottoman Turks, adding that \u201cthe destruction of the Turkish empire would be a terrible blow to Islam. The repercussions would be immense, above all in Africa, where the doctrine of Muhammad is spreading with frightening rapidity, preventing the success of our missionaries, and also, the progress of our civilisation.\u201d\n\nIn the traditional divide between France of Joan of Arc and France of the Revolution, between Right and Left, there was no doubt where his allegiances lay. Pouring scorn on the tendency of French socialists to valorise revolutionary values, pointing instead to \u201cthe intellectual and spiritual prestige of France in the 17th and 18th centuries.\u201d\n\nNone of these statements were unusual for a French conservative or a French king. What set de Gaulle apart from the monarchs was his ability to hold together a diverse nation, and his possession of greater wisdom in understanding the limits of his own power.\n\nUnifier\n\nAs a high-ranking officer desperate to change France\u2019s military approach before the disaster of 1940, he worked with left-wing politicians to seek to raise the alarm about the need for a professional army including armoured units.\n\nWhen invoking historic examples to inspire the French public, he looked to a diverse array of French heroes like the secularist Clemenceau. And unlike other French Catholic leaders, he harboured no anti-Semitism, and instead attracted many Jewish followers.\n\nThis did not mean his religious faith failed to influence his political actions. Indeed, Jackson described how de Gaulle\u2019s belief in Catholic social teaching stirred him to pursue the idea of \u2018association\u2019 between employers and workers: another source of an extraordinary popularity which cut across France\u2019s classes.\n\nShared faith helped him to form a strong personal relationship with the West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, which in turn allowed for the creation of a warm Franco-German relationship upon which European unity would be built.\n\nClear-sighted\n\nUnlike the Bourbon monarchs whose example he deeply respected, de Gaulle knew where religious and political policy diverged, but his convictions about the roots of French national identity allowed him to understand problems which subsequent French leaders have refused to face.\n\nDuring the Algerian War, while other French nationalists believed France could integrate the country and its people in order to prevent Algerian independence, de Gaulle did not \u2014 mainly because his French patriotism was not rooted in the liberal and secular universalism of 1789.\n\n\u201cTry and integrate oil and vinegar,\u201d he told a Gaullist politician in 1959. \u201cShake the bottle. After a moment they separate again. The Arabs are Arabs, the French are French. Do you think the French can absorb 10 million Muslims who will tomorrow be 20 million, and after tomorrow, 40? \u2026 My village would no longer be called Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises but Colombey [of] the Two Mosques.\u201d\n\nMuch of the last several decades of French history has involved the playing out of an experiment which de Gaulle predicted would fail. With each passing presidency, the giant\u2019s stature grows in comparison with the pygmies who have succeeded him in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, and led their nation down the path of decline.\n\nRegardless of his country\u2019s current malaise, de Gaulle\u2019s achievements in saving his country\u2019s honour in its darkest hour, and giving it an enduring political system, can never be taken away.\n\nJulian Jackson has given the world an extraordinary biography of a man whose idea of France was both certain and correct.

Name variations: Madame de Gaulle. Born Yvonne Charlotte Anne-Marie Vendroux (pronunciation: Vahn-DROO) on May 22, 1900, in the family home in Calais, on the Channel coast of France; died on November 8, 1979, in the military hospital Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, Paris; daughter of Jacques Vendroux (the head of a biscuit manufacturing company) and Marguerite (Forest) Vendroux; received primary and secondary education largely with private tutors at home; spent several years at a primary school, Notre-Dame in Calais; married Charles de Gaulle, on April 7, 1921 (a civil ceremony took place the previous day but it was the religious ceremony held April 7 that was regarded as their wedding by the de Gaulles); children: Philippe (b. December 28, 1921); Elisabeth de Boissieu (b. May 15, 1924); Anne de Gaulle (January 1, 1928\u2013February 6, 1948).\n\nChildhood years spent in family home in Calais; at age five, began primary education with private tutors (1905); as German forces advanced toward Calais at outset of WWI, Vendroux family took refuge in England (July\u2013August 1914); family returned to Calais (December 1914); cared for war wounded in Calais (1915\u201316); left Calais, under threat of German bombs, for safety in Paris (1916); as renewed German offensive threatened Paris (March 1918), sent out of harm's way to Mortagne, Brittany, then Perigueux (summer and autumn, 1918); worked with mother among the wounded war veterans in Calais (1919\u201320); met Charles de Gaulle (October 1920); after marriage, lived together in Paris (1921); moved with Charles, who was promoted to major and placed in charge of 19th Battalion of Light Infantry in Trier, Germany (1927); moved with family to Beirut (then in Syria, a French mandate of the League of Nations, now Lebanon), where Charles was posted (1929); returned to Paris (1931); purchased La Boisserie, an estate in the village of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, in the Haute-Marne department in eastern France (June 9, 1934); based in Metz where Charles commanded the 507th Tank Regiment (1937); outbreak of WWII (September 1, 1939); Germans entered Paris (June 14, 1940); de Gaulle family left France for London (June 17) where Charles' first BBC radio broadcast back to France called for resistance against Germany (June 18); moved to join Charles in liberated Algiers (July 1943); Allied invasion of Normandy (June 6, 1944); rejoined Charles, now head of the Provisional Government, in Neuilly, near Paris (September 1944); Charles resigned as head of the Provisional Government (January, 1946); moved back into La Boisserie(May 1946); death of daughter Anne, caused by pneumonia (February 6, 1948); returned to Paris with re-call of Charles to power during Algerian crisis (June 1, 1958); became \"first lady\" of France upon the inauguration of Charles as first president of the Fifth Republic (January 8, 1959); narrowly survived an assassination attempt in the company of her husband (August 22, 1962); retired to La Boisserie after referendum defeat of de Gaulle (April 1969); death of Charles de Gaulle (November 9, 1970).\n\nOn August 22, 1962, in the Paris suburb of Petit-Clamart, en route from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace to the town of Villacoublay, the French presidential car was ambushed by a commando who fired some 150 shots from automatic weapons. Fourteen bullets struck the car in which Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, their son-in-law Alain de Boissieu, and the driver Francis Marroux were riding, on their way for a weekend at the presidential retreat in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. No one was hit. The Petit-Clamart attack was but the closest call in a series of assassination attempts by groups opposed to Charles de Gaulle's ceding of independence to the rebellious colony of Algeria. The general, at least according to some accounts, had been too proud even to drop to the floor during the fusillade, and, even though a bullet passed between their heads, Yvonne de Gaulle had also remained seated erect during the attack. Upon their arrival at Villacoublay, the general turned to his wife and said: \"Yvonne, you are brave.\"\n\nYvonne de Gaulle's behavior during and after the Petit-Clamart assassination attempt typified the stoicism, courage, and fidelity that characterized her entire adult life and for which she is remembered in France. Years after her death, President Richard Nixon remembered her having said in 1969, \"the presidency is temporary, the family permanent.\" The product of a middle-class Catholic family from Calais, in Normandy, Yvonne de Gaulle exemplified the \"dutiful wife and mother,\" silent in public but influential behind the scenes. Deeply religious and private, she kept to herself whatever complaints she might have had living with the self-assured and frequently cantankerous Charles de Gaulle. She lived so privately that, even as first lady in France during the 1960s, she was able to shop in Parisian stores without being recognized. Although her role came increasingly into question in the France of the 1960s, she nonetheless came to be respected in France as \"Tante Yvonne\" (Aunt Yvonne), during the presidency of her husband.\n\nThe daughter of Jacques and Marguerite Vendroux , Yvonne Vendroux was born on May 22, 1900, in the family home in Calais, on the Channel coast of France. Her father, who had gone into the biscuit-producing business, came from a long line of shipowners and local mayors and was himself vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, a municipal councilor, and the honorary consul of several foreign countries. He was, in French terms, a \"notable,\" or local dignitary. His family, the Van Droog, tobacco producers, had moved in the late 17th century from Delft in Holland to Dunkirk, where the name was changed to Vandroux; later the family moved to Calais, where the name was changed to Vendroux. Yvonne's mother, Marguerite Forest Vendroux, was the granddaughter of a well-known notary of the town of Charleville.\n\nMadame de Gaulle's importance was considerable not for what she said or did but for what she neither did nor said, by her silent presence. \u2014Andr\u00e9 Malraux\n\nYvonne Vendroux had a happy and stable childhood. Raised amid comfortable circumstances, the second of four children, she spent her early years with her family, in Calais in the winter and in a country estate in the Ardennes during the summer, where she went mountain climbing and developed a lifelong love of nature, especially flowers. Most of her schooling took place in the form of home tutoring. Dubious about the quality of the local schools after the 1905 separation of church and state in France, Yvonne's parents hired a tutor, Mademoiselle Delannoy , for her primary education. After 1907, she was sent for awhile as a day student to the local Notre-Dame boarding school, but her parents retained the tutor to supplement their daughter's education. Her secondary school education took place entirely at home.\n\nYvonne's first communion, in 1911, was followed by three relatively carefree years, broken with the onset of World War I in August 1914. As German forces advanced toward Calais and bombs fell on the town early in the war, the Vendroux family took refuge in Kent, in southern England. By the end of 1914, when it had become clear that the French forces would hold and Calais would be safe from German invasion, the Vendroux family returned. There, Yvonne's activities continued to revolve around the home as her mother cared for wounded war veterans. In 1916, seeking greater security, the family again left Calais for Paris, where Yvonne remained until March 1918, when a renewed German offensive led the family to send her and her sister Suzanne to Brittany. Now 18, Yvonne next went to Perigueux, where she spent the final days of World War I. With the end of the war, the Vendroux family turned to the restoration of their various properties in the Calais and Ardennes areas. Yvonne assumed an increasing role in household management, allowing her mother to continue to work in veterans' hospitals. Her older brother Jacques accompanied her as chaperon to the parties and balls in Paris and Calais. Yvonne soon joined her mother working among the war wounded, widows, and orphans.\n\nIn October 1920, at a tea arranged by family friends, Yvonne met Captain Charles de Gaulle, then on a brief leave from service with the French military mission in Poland. Shortly thereafter, he invited her to a ball at Saint-Cyr, the French military academy. Taken with Charles, Yvonne accepted and went in the company of Jacques. A few days later, asked directly about her feelings toward Charles, Yvonne replied, \"It will be he or no one.\" The families met, and the couple was officially affianced on November 11, 1920. Charles had to return for two additional months' service in Poland, then returned to France in February. He was named professor of history at Saint-Cyr, a post that would keep him in Paris.\n\nYvonne Vendroux and Charles de Gaulle were married in a civil ceremony in Calais on April 6, 1921, and in a religious ceremony the next day at the Notre-Dame Church in that city. Following their marriage, the young couple settled in a modest Paris apartment and lived a relatively quiet life. Their son Philippe was born at the end of 1921. In 1924, their second child, Elizabeth, was born. Charles finished his studies at the War College, published his first book, La Discorde chez l'Ennemi (Discord in the Enemy), and was posted as an officer working with Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, the hero of World War I, with whose career his own would be dramatically crossed. In 1927, Yvonne de Gaulle joined her husband in a posting in Trier, Germany, where in 1928, their daughter Anne was born. Within months of Anne's birth, it had become clear that she was suffering from Down's syndrome. Anne was never to speak well or eat or dress unaided. Her illness was the great personal tragedy of the de Gaulles who cared for her tenderly.\n\nIn 1929, the de Gaulles were sent to Beirut, Lebanon, then part of French-controlled Syria, where they remained until 1931. In 1932, Yvonne's father died; her mother died the following year. At the end of 1933, Charles de Gaulle was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In June 1934, the de Gaulles bought \"La Boisserie,\" the estate of Yvonne's late parents, located in the village of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, in the gently rolling hills of the Haute-Marne department about midway between Paris and France's eastern frontier. The year 1934 also saw the publication of Charles' second book, Vers l'arm\u00e9e de m\u00e9tier (The Army of the Future), which argued, to little avail, that the French should adopt new mechanized forms of warfare. In 1937, Charles was given the command of the 507th Tank Regiment based in Metz. Life for the de Gaulle family revolved quietly around Paris, Metz, and La Boisserie.\n\nYvonne's domain was the family home at La Boisserie, her place of refuge from the turbulent political affairs surrounding her husband. She quietly endured the tragedy of Anne's disabilities while living with a man who was very much a lone rebel in political and military circles during the 1930s, and who clearly ruled as master of the household. Known for his arrogance, Charles was said to be a tyrant at home, with Yvonne silently bearing the brunt of his disappointment and frustration. Charles dominated conversations; Yvonne was told plainly, and sometimes publicly, that her opinion did not count. On more than one occasion Charles was observed telling his wife to be silent, that she could not possibly know anything about politics. Years later, an acquaintance said that compared to the cheerful if somewhat reticent young woman who had married Charles in 1921, the Yvonne of the late 1930s was profoundly sad.\n\nThe outbreak of war with Nazi Germany in September 1939 found Charles in command of his tank regiment. Poland was quickly crushed by the Germans, but the war with France involved little actual fighting in what became known as the dr\u00f4le de guerre, or phony war. This changed with the German thrust westward of May 10, 1940. The force of the German onslaught was such that, within days, Charles was writing from the front to Yvonne at La Boisserie, warning her to be ready for quick flight in the event that the military situation turned disastrous. On June 1, Charles was promoted to brigadier-general. Five days later, he was appointed undersecretary of state for National Defense and War by Premier Paul Reynaud. The Germans entered Paris on June 14. On June 16, the Reynaud government was replaced by one headed by Marshal P\u00e9tain, who was committed to seeking peace with the Germans. A day later, Yvonne with her three children and their governess left for England to join her husband, a political exile.\n\nFor the second time in her life, Yvonne de Gaulle experienced wartime exile in England. On June 18, Charles broadcast back to France, calling on the entire nation to resist the Germans and any French authority that supported collaboration with them. In London, their son Philippe, then 18 years old, joined the newly created Free French Navy in July. In addition to the occupation of her homeland, Yvonne had to accept the fact that her husband was now a rebel, standing almost alone against his country's legal government, which was headed by World War I hero and his own former sponsor, Marshal P\u00e9tain. Moreover, P\u00e9tain sentenced Charles to death in absentia for wartime desertion and treason. Yvonne set up a household in London as he organized what became the Free French resistance to Nazi Germany and the government of Vichy France. Whatever his other activities in wartime London, Charles was invariably present to tell Anne stories at her bedtime and to shield her from the press.\n\nTogether with other Londoners, Yvonne endured the German Blitz or air raids in the summer and fall of 1940, but ultimately her faith in her husband's vision was rewarded; the fortunes of war turned with the entry of the Soviet Union and the United States into combat against the Nazis. Following the liberation of French North Africa, the de Gaulle family returned to Algiers in June 1943. The liberation of metropolitan France, which began with the D-Day landings in Normandy, June 6, 1944, left the country under the Free French, reorganized as a Provisional Government and headed by Charles de Gaulle. In late August, Paris was liberated and by the end of September, almost all of metropolitan France had been cleared of Germans. Yvonne, now the wife of the leader of the Provisional Government, returned home to supervise the reconstruction of La Boisserie, which had been pillaged and partially burned during the Occupation. Charles, however, became increasingly dispirited as the politicians who had dominated prewar politics and, in his view, had brought on the catastrophe of 1940, regained strength, promising to recreate what he called the \"regime of parties.\" On January 3, 1946, a few weeks after the marriage of daughter Elisabeth to Commander Alain de Boissieu, Charles abruptly resigned his position. The family lived until May in an uncomfortable house rented from the government while La Boisserie was being restored and Charles waited restlessly to be recalled to power.\n\nIn 1946, with the help of Georges Pompidou, who later served as one of Charles' prime ministers and was to become his successor as president, the de Gaulles established the Anne de Gaulle Foundation to help handicapped girls. The Foundation was to care for Anne in the event that her parents predeceased her. Supported financially by the income from Charles' books, the Foundation built a house on a wooded hill in the Chevreuse valley. Staffed by six nuns and a mother superior, the house eventually provided for some 40 handicapped girls. Yvonne helped select them.\n\nIn April 1947, Charles created the Rassemblement du Peuple Fran\u00e7ais (Rally of the French People), a political party that was to serve as a vehicle for his return to power. Then, on February 6, 1948, Anne died of bronchial pneumonia at age 20. With the death of Anne, the Anne de Gaulle Foundation occupied much of Yvonne's attention. She also accompanied Charles throughout France as he campaigned for his new RPF, but by 1952, the party was fading and he ended it the next year. These years were spent, often with their grandchildren, at La Boisserie where Charles worked on his memoirs, with occasional trips abroad where he was received as the hero of the wartime French Resistance. To visitors at La Boisserie, Yvonne occasionally expressed the desire to protect her husband \"for history,\" and keep him out of politics. The tranquil life was interrupted, however, when the government's inability to suppress the Algerian rebellion led to rioting by European Algerians in the streets of Algiers on May 13, 1958. La Boisserie was quickly turned into a command post as Charles and his advisors planned his return to office. On June 1, Charles de Gaulle was voted in as premier by the National Assembly with full powers to write a new constitution for France. The result was France's Fifth Republic, with a much stronger presidency, filled in 1959 by Charles de Gaulle.\n\nOnce again, Yvonne de Gaulle was a reluctant first lady of France. During the early 1960s, Charles survived several assassination attempts by opponents of independence for Algeria. The closest call was the Petit-Clamart fusillade in 1962. Profiting by the wave of sympathy engendered by the assassination attempt, Charles proposed a constitutional change to elect the president by universal suffrage, which was approved by popular referendum in October. In 1965, against Yvonne's will, he stood as a candidate for the presidency. Forced into a runoff with Socialist candidate Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Charles was elected in the second round to a seven-year term.\n\nTo many in 1960s France, \"Aunt Yvonne\" came to represent the wife of a previous era. She accompanied Charles to innumerable Paris Opera galas, where she sat through close to 30 performances of \"Carmen,\" and hosted the Kennedys, Khrushchevs, and many other world leaders. The comparison of the prim and somewhat dowdy Yvonne, who scrupulously supervised the household affairs of France's presidential \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, with the youthful and fashionable Jacqueline Kennedy , who accompanied her husband, then president of the United States, on a visit to Paris in 1961, was played out in the international press. Wearing sedate black, gray, or mauve dresses designed by Paris couturier Jacques Heim, Yvonne avoided d\u00e9colletage and shunned the more up-to-date fashions of Coco Chanel . Yvonne's successor as France's first lady, Claude Pompidou , recalled later that Yvonne's only advice to her had been to wear hats. Yvonne arranged the floral decorations of the palace, and she loved to travel and accompany her husband on all his official trips abroad, but whenever possible, she returned\n\nto La Boisserie and the gardens that were her favorite pastime.\n\nA strict Catholic, Yvonne set an austere tone at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, making sure the private lives of those in her husband's entourage passed moral muster. Exerting a considerable, if private, influence, she saw to it that divorcees were weeded out of influential positions and excluded from presidential social functions. She was equally severe in her judgments of much of the literature and film of the 1960s and carefully scrutinized the selection of films to be shown in the palace. For her religious devotions, she had a special chapel built inside the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nYvonne was with Charles when, during the height of the student and worker unrest of May 1968, he traveled to Baden-Baden to consult with French generals about the possibility of his resigning. She shared his disappointment, when, in April 1969, in a referendum he had called on behalf of decentralizing political reforms, he was defeated. Having staked his political prestige on the referendum, Charles immediately resigned. The couple returned to La Boisserie, where on November 9, 1970, Charles died. Yvonne continued to live there, where she cooked, knitted, and tended her garden, visited often by her children and four grandchildren until the fall of 1978, when she withdrew to the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception convent in Paris. In July 1979, she was operated on in Paris for an intestinal obstruction. Readmitted to a Paris military hospital, she died November 8, 1979. She was buried beside Charles and Anne at the church cemetery in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. Surviving Yvonne, in addition to her son Philippe and daughter Elisabeth, were her grandchildren and one great-grandson. Mourned as the symbol of moral rectitude and marital fidelity of a long gone era, \"Tante Yvonne\" was called the \"minister of common sense\" in the government of General Charles de Gaulle. Following her death, La Boisserie, which remained in the possession of Philippe, was converted into a museum, open to the public, in honor of the de Gaulles.\n\nsources:\n\nB\u00e9liard, Jean. \"Entretien avec Richard Nixon,\" in Institut Charles de Gaulle.

He is selfish, he is arrogant, he believes he is the center of the world. He . . . You are quite right. He is a great man.\u201d Churchill knew whereof he spoke: During World War II, it was he who bore the brunt of the Frenchman\u2019s intransigence.\n\nThough very different characters, the two statesmen had certain points in common: Both had an extraordinary way with words and both saw themselves as men of destiny. Having fled to Britain after the collapse of the French army, de Gaulle cast himself as the embodiment of the French nation, a modern-day male Joan of Arc, who would lead the fight against the Germans and their Vichy hirelings and restore France to its rightful place and greatness.\n\nIn the process, he managed to upset a great number of people. As French historian Francois Kersody has written, he seemed to be permanently involved in a two front war: \u201ca public war against Vichy and the Germans, and a private war against the British Admiralty, the Air Ministry, the War Office, the Intelligence Service, the Foreign Office, the Prime Minister, the U.S. State Department, and the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nOne of his advisers noted \u201cthe General must constantly be reminded that out main enemy is Germany. If he would follow his own inclination, it would be England.\u201d\n\nBefore departing London to set up headquarters in Algiers in May 1943, de Gaulle said goodbye to Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, who asked, \u201cDo you know you have given us more difficulty than all our European allies?\u201d To which de Gaulle answered, \u201cI have no doubt of it. France is a great power.\u201d\n\nThe Americans, of course, regarded him as suffering from delusions of grandeur. During the Casablanca summit, Roosevelt\u2019s secret service detail discretely kept the Frenchman covered with their Tommy guns. You can never be too careful.\n\nDespite \u2014 or because of \u2014 his obstinacy, de Gaulle managed to place France among the victors of World War II. Later, with his comeback in 1958, he gave his countrymen a new constitution, he got France out of the Algerian mess, and he saved his nation from civil war.\n\n\u201cWas he a great statesman or a conjuror on a huge scale, a true founding father of present day France, with lessons for the world, or a Wizard of Oz manipulating a great machine of illusions?\u201d This is the central question posed in Jonathan Fenby\u2019s fascinating The General: Charles de Gaulle and the France He Saved.\n\nThe book provides a vivid and eminently fair assessment of its subject, bringing out the essential ambiguities: de Gaulle was both a doer and a dreamer, an extreme realist \u201cremorselessly applying cold logic,\u201d and a romantic Don Quixote figure, \u201ctilting at windmills.\u201d\n\nDe gaulle was a \u201cman of the North,\u201d from the city of Lille, a colder and sterner industrial region, Fenby notes, than the sundrenched French south one normally reads about. His father was a monarchist and a professor of history and literature. De Gaulle\u2019s upbringing emphasized duty and frugality, and gave him a solid knowledge of the classics, of philosophy, and of French letters.\n\nWe catch colorful glimpses from his youth: Prompted by his reading about the French defeat in the 1870\u201371 Franco-German War, he early decided on a military career. Before attending military college as a cadet, he spent an obligatory year in an army regiment; he was not promoted to sergeant: As his captain argued, \u201chow he could do so to somebody who would only feel at ease as a general.\u201d At the military academy of St Cyr, his evaluations deemed him \u201ccalm and forceful in command.\u201d His physical appearance certainly contributed: Measuring 6\u20193, with hooded eyes and a nose in the Cyrano de Bergerac class, he towered over everybody.\n\nIn World War I, he was wounded three times, including a bayonet through his thigh in the battle of Verdun. Given up for dead, he had in fact been taken prisoner. His fellow prisoners recalled him as formal and reserved, not a man one addressed with the familiar tu. Fenby quotes his prison notebooks, which set out his ideas of leadership, of which mystique plays an important part: \u201cOne must speak little. In action one must say nothing. The chief is the one who does not speak.\u201d\n\nFrom de Gaulle\u2019s attendance at the Ecole de Guerre in 1922, one of his fellow officers provides amusing testimony: \u201cAt the beginning of term meeting in the lecture theatre I saw a tall, very tall captain in horizon blue make his way down the tiers to take his place again. He walked very straight, stiff and solemn, strutting as if he were moving his own statue.\u201d\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s career benefitted from his being a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Marshal Petain, the victor at Verdun, but the two parted company over military strategy. While the military establishment were putting all their bets on the defensive Maginot Line, de Gaulle insisted on a war of movement. His 1934 book, Vers l\u2019Armee de Metier, calls for a professional and fully mechanized army of some 100,000 men in addition to its conscript army. The book died in France, but in Germany it was studied with great interest by Rommel and Guderian.\n\nWhen the Germans invaded, their panzer armies practiced exactly the kind of concentrated war of movement de Gaulle had advocated. His division was one of the few to put up a successful fight. Hastily appointed deputy defense minister, he had three meetings with Churchill to discuss last-minute efforts to stave off defeat. The prime minister now needed the Royal Air Force for the defense of Britain, but was quick to recognize de Gaulle\u2019s mental toughness.\n\nWith Petain about to sign an armistice, the only course left to de Gaulle was to escape to Britain. Here, installed in a triangular office on the embankment, de Gaulle set up his Free French operation. His June 18th broadcast over the bbc provided a message of hope to the French population and an appeal to French servicemen abroad to join him in the battle against the Nazis. Asked to do a sound check, he uttered one word: \u201cFrance.\u201d\n\nDe gaulle never doubted the war\u2019s eventual outcome, especially once the Americans were in, but, as Fenby notes, his task was the tricky one of ensuring that France got a seat among the victors. To do that, Frenchmen had to participate on all fronts, thereby forcing Britain and the U.S. to recognize France as a fellow ally. But his suspicious and unyielding nature made him a prickly partner. After the allied landings in North Africa, he was particularly worried that Britain would take over France\u2019s colonial role in the Levant.\n\nFenby provides some valid explanations for de Gaulle\u2019s intransigence: One was his need to demonstrate to his countrymen that he was his own man, not some Anglo-Saxon puppet. He was also holding an extremely weak hand. Once when Churchill blamed him for his stubbornness, in a moment of naked candor, de Gaulle replied \u201cI am too poor to bow.\u201d He could not afford to compromise, as he did not have anything to compromise with. His was a high wire act, which in the words of his French biographer Jean Lacouture \u201csubstituted symbol for reality.\u201d\n\nStill, as Fenby\u2019s evidence makes plain, de Gaulle\u2019s stubbornness went way beyond what was required, \u201cbordering on the irrational.\u201d His was the kind of mind that carefully stored every slight, indignity, defeat, and humiliation the French had ever suffered at the hands of perfidious Albion, the most recent occurring in 1898 when a British force under Herbert Kitchener compelled a French expedition to withdraw at Fashoda on the White Nile, \u201cthe most traumatic event of his childhood.\u201d\n\nFenby details their clashes, with Churchill vacillating between admiration for the man\u2019s fighting spirit and the urge to clap him in chains. De Gaulle\u2019s constant attempts to split the British from the Americans triggered this outburst from Churchill at the Casablanca summit. \u201cFor get this quite clear, every time we have to decide between Europe and the open sea, it is always the open sea we shall choose. Every time I have to decide between you and Roosevelt, I shall always choose Roosevelt.\u201d\n\nMuch less indulgent than Churchill, Roosevelt saw him as a dictator type \u2014 \u201cThere is no man in which I have less confidence\u201d \u2014 and was keen to replace him with General Henri Giraud, but Giraud proved politically inept and lacked popular support. So they were stuck with de Gaulle.\n\nAfter the invasion, Roosevelt had wanted to the place France under military administration, but typically, de Gaulle presented the Allies with a fait accompli by immediately setting up his own administration in Baujeau. And when the Paris insurrection forced Eisenhower to liberate the city rather than bypass it, de Gaulle ordered General Leclerc to rush his tanks to Paris, making it look like the French had liberated themselves.\n\nWith some major unacknowledged help from Churchill at the Yalta and Potsdam conferences, to which de Gaulle was not invited, France came out of the war with permanent seat in the un security council, its own occupation zone in Germany, and a seat in the Allied Council of Foreign Ministers in Europe, a pretty impressive result.\n\nAfter liberation, Fenby notes, there was always the risk that the communists, having practicing classic \u201cunited front\u201d tactics during the war, would hijack the Resistance movement and leave de Gaulle as a French Kerensky, the Russian transition figure who governed briefly after the Revolution.\n\nIn the days of the provisional government, de Gaulle ruled by decree. As head of the new elected government, with three roughly equal blocks, he had to work with the communists, who with 26 percent were the largest party, and accept five communists in his cabinet, though not in the most sensitive spots.\n\nThus the immediate postwar months featured de Gaulle the extreme pragmatist, whose first priority was to prevent civil war. According to the resurrection myth, all the French had been part of the resistance: Thus among the charges at Marshal Petain\u2019s trial, there was nothing about the deportation of the French Jews to the extermination camps, nor the sending of French workers to do forced labor in Germany. (De Gaulle commuted Petain\u2019s death sentence.) Civil servants were treated leniently and so were businessmen, many of whom got off free.\n\nBut the composition of the parliament did not suit him: \u201ca nest of intrigues,\u201d he called it. After fierce clashes with parliament over his demand for a new constitution, he resigned in 1946 and withdrew to his austere home in Colombey-les-Deux Eglises, about which he once told a visitor \u201cone does not come here to laugh.\u201d\n\nHere, Cincinnatus-like, he was waiting for the country to call him back. The first volume of his elegant memoirs appeared in 1954, advancing his claims as the \u201conce and future savior of the nation.\u201d In particular, he was carefully monitoring the situation in French Algeria.\n\nMeanwhile, he pondered what changes he wanted to make. Constitutional change remained at the top of the list. Like its predecessor, the Fourth Republic proved ungovernable, with the prime minister\u2019s seat changing occupant 21 times in the period 1946\u201358. Noting his countrymen\u2019s preference for easy solutions, he saw his mission as making the French do the things they did not want to do.\n\nBut however badly he wanted to be back in power, notes Fenby, he wanted to do so through legal means. The worsening situation in Algeria afforded the opportunity. Here terrorist attacks were a daily occurrence, the Front De Liberation Nationale insurgency having been encouraged by the 1954 French pullout from Indochina.\n\nFearing a sellout from the politicians, General Salan, the commander in chief in Algeria, had warned President Coty that the army would not accept any concessions to the rebels. Addressing demonstrators in Algiers, Salan declared, \u201cWe are united now and will march together up the Champs Elysees and bedecked with flowers.\u201d The situation grew tenser when paratroopers stationed in Corsica took charge of the island in support of their comrades in Algiers.\n\nFenby details de Gaulle\u2019s handling of the touchy situation and gives it high marks: de Gaulle made plain his refusal to take power \u201cin a tumult of Generals\u201d and at the same time refrained from criticizing the army, instead offering himself as a referee, which a frightened legislature accepted: \u201cAs premier designate, he had achieved a legal return to power and headed off a very real threat of a military operation and civil war. It was an extraordinary victory.\u201d\n\nHaving assumed emergency powers for six months, he announced a referendum on constitutional reform. His proposal called for a strong presidency, in which the president would handle foreign and defense policy and retain special powers in case of threats to the republic from within. The president would appoint the prime minister, who would be responsible for the day-to-day business of government.\n\nThese measures he deemed necessary to make up for \u201cthe effects of our perpetual effervescence.\u201d While his harshest critic, the socialist Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, denounced it as a \u201cpermanent coup d\u2019etat,\u201d his countrymen backed him overwhelmingly.\n\nBut what exactly was his policy on Algeria? For a while, notes Fenby, he \u201choped for a military victory and a compromise solution\u201d involving the emergence of a third force. But the realist in him had long realized the demographic odds were against France holding on: nine million natives versus one million Pieds-Noirs, French settlers. \u201cBelieve me, I am the first to regret it, but the proportion of Europeans is too small.\u201d\n\nIn the end, he bit the bullet by entering the Evian agreement of 1962, which paved the way for the Algerians to vote on their future; 99 percent voted for independence. At home in France, in a referendum, 90 percent of the French, thoroughly fed up with the issue, voted in favor of the agreement. One million Pied-Noirs returned to France. \u201cThe Algerian crisis did not end favorably,\u201d writes Fenby, \u201cbut in the only conditions that were possible.\u201d\n\nCasting himself as a man above politics, de Gaulle\u2019s leadership style, in Fenby\u2019s words, combined \u201cthe oracular mystery of a long gone monarchical age with techniques of modern communications.\u201d\n\nThe slaughter began as soon as Algeria got independence. According to Fenby, between 10,000 and 80,000 natives who had backed the French were killed, some boiled alive or emasculated.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to see de Gaulle\u2019s handling of the crisis as anything more than the maneuvers of an extremely skilled politician operating on his own with a mixture of guile and ruthlessness to find an escape from the challenge that had brought down the republic,\u201d writes Fenby.\n\nThe secret army organization, the oas, continued its war on the French government. On August 22, 1962, they came close when they spayed de Gaulle\u2019s Citro\u00ebn with machine gun fire, leaving fourteen bullet holes in the car. Afterwards de Gaulle was unshaken, \u201cMy dear friend, these people shoot like pigs.\u201d The planner was sentenced to death and shot. Altogether, there were two dozen assassination attempts on de Gaulle.\n\nCasting himself as a man above politics \u2014 \u201cI am a man who belongs to nobody and who belongs to everybody\u201d \u2014 de Gaulle\u2019s leadership style in Fenby\u2019s words combined \u201cthe oracular mystery of a long gone monarchical age with techniques of modern communications.\u201d His press conferences were \u201chigh masses\u201d and his tv speeches were like \u201ca republican monarch addressing his subjects.\u201d\n\nThe air of aloofness surrounding the ruler was an essential governing tool. But he also needed physical contact with his subjects: \u201cHe believed he had some mystical communication with the French people,\u201d writes Fenby. Accordingly, he would plunge into the crowds in a bain de foule, a crowd bath \u201ceven if the police had arrested men with knives, pistols, and hypodermic syringes on his path.\u201d\n\nHis sense of superiority never fails to amuse. After his resignation in 1946, he turned down the offer of elevation to the rank of marshal on the grounds that his two stars had served him perfectly well during the war, and besides, \u201cOne does not decorate France.\u201d Similarly, he had declined an invitation to become a member of the Academie-Francaise: \u201cThe King of France does not belong to the Academy, nor does Napoleon.\u201d\n\nWhen attending jfk\u2019s funeral as president, he was not entirely satisfied with the seating arrangements, having been placed in the eighth row: Resolutely, he marched to the front and told the head of protocol \u201cRight. We can start,\u201d and sat down there and then.\n\nIn their dealings with him, exasperated American politicians repeatedly resorted to mountain imagery. Secretary of State Dean Rusk compares an audience with de Gaulle to \u201cCrawling up a mountainside, opening a little portal, and waiting for the oracle to speak . . . there was never any give and take. De Gaulle gave us pronouncements from on high, but never had any real discussion; he was there, he would listen. \u2018Je vous ecoute,\u2019 and would then bid us goodbye.\u201d\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s hauteur coexisted with a penchant for secrecy and ambiguity, writes Fenby.\n\n\u201cHe was at one and the same time the most straightforward of politicians in his ultimate aims, and among the most tricky in the way he proceeded towards them, an Olympian who adopted wily crab-like tactics. He rarely told an outright lie, but was masterly in obfuscation and economizing with the truth.\u201d\n\nThe central tenet of Gaullism is self-reliance: The French needed to see themselves as part of a great nation, and should not rely on others for their national security and prosperity. Thus de Gaulle oversaw the development of the French Force de Frappe, and sought to steer a kind of independent middle way between the blocs that was designed to maximize French influence.\n\nBut for a man priding himself on cold logic and clear thought, he could be remarkably incoherent and emotional, as Fenby demonstrates. He was an anti-communist, but seemed more intent on shutting America out of Europe. During the Korean war he stated that \u201cThe Russian are hard people,\u201d but added that the Americans were \u201cbrutes,\u201d too.\n\nHis initial desire to keep Germany weak had proved a nonstarter in the intensifying Cold War. Instead he tried to talk the Germans into some kind of Franco-German defense arrangement, but neither Konrad Adenauer nor his successor Ludwig Erhard bought the idea. As Fenby notes, the official photograph from the Franco-German friendship treaty in January 1963 carries huge symbolic value. \u201cBut the Germans did not sign up for de Gaulle\u2019s vision of Europe,\u201d he adds. \u201cIn the preamble to the treaty, it explicitly says that this will not affect relations with the U.S.\u201d\n\nRecalling Churchill\u2019s words about Britain always siding with America, he punished the Brits by vetoing their entry into the Common Market, as he saw Britain as a \u201cTrojan horse for American influence,\u201d and did not consider the British to be Europeans.\n\nThis kind of contrariness became even more pronounced after the 1965 elections, where he was forced into a run-off. \u201cIncreasingly he was a prisoner of his own mindset,\u201d writes Fenby, displaying \u201can exaggerated self importance and overestimation of France\u2019s role.\u201d\n\nThus having made threats for years, as part of his own attempts at d\u00e9tente with the Russians, in 1966 he pulled France out of nato\u2019s integrated military command, forcing all Allied personnel to leave, prompting President Johnson to ask if that applied to the American war dead, too. But France did remain part of nato\u2019s political structure.\n\nVietnam became the centerpiece in his anti-American crusade, which would presumably curry favor with third world revolutionary movements. At the same time, France was always ready to shore up its favorite dictators in Africa.\n\n\u201cHis lack of concern for ideological issues meant he did not appreciate the depth of the divide between East and West,\u201d writes Fenby. Leonid Brezhnev told Polish leaders \u201cwhile he [de Gaulle] was an enemy, his policies had the advantage of weakening U.S. positions in Western Europe.\u201d\n\nHis increasing remoteness was also demonstrated in the run-up to the 1967 Six-Day War, as Arab armies were massing on Israel\u2019s borders. He warned the Israelis that he would not support them if they attacked first, but magnanimously stated that he would not allow Israel to be destroyed. \u201cWhat did you think the Israelis did with my advice? They completely ignored it!\u201d he blurted out, and he took flak when he later described the Israelis as \u201can elite people sure of themselves and domineering.\u201d Interestingly, as Fenby notes, the Israelis were displaying precisely the kind of self-reliance he wanted for France. \u201cThe whole episode can best be seen as an example of his pique in being bypassed and reminded of the limits of his international sway,\u201d writes Fenby.\n\nThe book\u2019s final section is dominated by events on the home front, the six weeks of turmoil in the spring of 1968, which started with student occupations and spread to the massive strikes by industrial workers in an insurrection complete with barricades. The authority of the government was crumbling, and the cia foresaw civil war.\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s response was one of the great disappearing acts of all time. Without telling anybody of his whereabouts, he flew off to the headquarters of French troops in West Germany to confer with the general in charge, Jacques Massu. Having obtained the army\u2019s backing, de Gaulle headed back to Paris.\n\nResorting to \u201cextreme theater to rally France behind him,\u201d in a radio address he again faced the nation with a choice between himself and chaos. The result was the great counter-demonstration of May 30, followed by June elections in which the Left incurred a massive defeat.\n\nBut this was his last triumph. After losing on a referendum on senate reform the following spring, on which he had staked his presidency, he retired on April 28, 1969, to Colombey-les-Deux Eglises, quietly to work on his books.\n\n\u201cAll successful leaders are to varying degrees magicians and actors,\u201d writes Fenby. Starting from scratch, of the World War II leaders, de Gaulle \u201cconjured most from the least.\u201d Thus de Gaulle\u2019s career defies those who see history merely as the result of impersonal forces, beyond the influence of great men: \u201cThough it opened him to mockery from those who saw him as ridiculously self-important, the key to his greatness lay in a single factor: His genuine belief that he incarnated France and could raise it to the status he believed it deserved.\u201d\n\nThe original impulse of self-reliance behind Gaullism can be seen as positive, notes Fenby, as an attempt to take his countrymen out of their depression, and be part of a great national project.\n\nBut due to the originator\u2019s particular mindset, his brand of patriotism, as it comes out in the book, was too narrow and selfish, earning de Gaulle his reputation as the \u201cabominable no-man.\u201d According to Fenby, he saw his nation as \u201ca sort of middle kingdom [for which] the rest of the world had meaning only if it affected France.\u201d De Gaulle saddled France with the reputation of a nation that was always going its own way, that could not entirely be counted on. It is hard to see how this improved France\u2019s security.\n\nAs for the left-wing charges of a dictatorial bent, though he certainly had authoritarian traits, says Fenby, he was no dictator, as he believed that \u201cdictatorships always ended in disaster.\u201d As de Gaulle had noted in the 1965 presidential elections, where he was up against the socialist Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand \u2014 a \u201ccrafty ruffian\u201d in his words \u2014 and forced into a run-off: \u201cHave you ever seen a dictator on a run-off ballot?\u201d Accordingly, he relinquished power twice, in 1946 and in 1969.\n\nMost importantly, he brought stability. His Fifth Republic has survived: As Fenby notes, there were only three pms from 1958 to 1969, when he retired, versus the 21 under the Fourth Republic. The Fifth Republic\u2019s harshest critic, the socialist Mitterrand, came back a decade after de Gaulle defeated him to beat President Giscard D\u2019Estaing and seemed to settle in perfectly happily. It even survived a period of cohabitation, where Mitterrand had to rule with a Gaullist prime minister \u2014 providing de Gaulle with \u201ca heritage few politicians can claim.\u201d"}]}
