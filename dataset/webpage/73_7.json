{"John Loder continued to work in the music industry until his death in 1972.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/19/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries", "page_content": "I first met the sound engineer and record producer John Loder in about 1968. He was on an acid trip and seemed to be talking out of the top of his head. The next time I met him he was straight and made a lot more sense. We soon found that we shared. a common interest in Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, John Coltrane, and KarlHeinz Stockhausen. When we got bored with them, we would play birdsong forwards and Bach backwards.\n\nBy 1970 John, who has died aged 59, and I were working together in Exit, an avant-garde outfit. I was the percussionist, playing an amplified bicycle wheel, and he was using an ancient one-track tape-recorder discovered in a friend's attic; primitive, but it was the beginning of what was to become John's lifework.\n\nFinanced by a brief spell as a mini-cab driver, by 1972 John had cobbled together an innovatory multi-track sound system, first used as a part of the wildly ambitious avant-garde International Carnival of Experimental Sound (ICES 72). By the time Exit disbanded in 1974, John had accumulated enough equipment to build a recording studio in the small garage of his north London home.\n\nDuring the next three years we lost touch, but by 1977 he was recording advertising jingles - which he didn't enjoy - and I had cofounded the band Crass, which I enjoyed thoroughly. From then on the ball started to rock and roll. As \"the ninth member of the band\", John became our recording engineer and financial manager: the music was bad and so was the money, but it was fun.\n\nWithin a couple of years Crass albums were dominating the alternative charts, and John's garage had become Southern Studios. In 1979 we created Crass Records and, despite marketing our first single for 45p against John's warning that every copy would lose us 3p, we made money.\n\nWe were in business, and from the outset it was clear that the music industry was not well pleased; John was a maverick, a DIY champion who didn't play the game. In his philosophy, beautiful came before big: to the last he drove a wreck of an old van, and never considered moving his garage studio to a more \"desirable\" location.\n\nLikewise, attempts to buy him out failed, just as media attempts to denigrate Crass had no effect on its growing popularity. Crass Records became the label that every aspiring punk band looked to, Southern Studios their destination, and John their engineer of choice.\n\nThroughout that time, with scores of bands being released on the label, no contract was ever signed and no paperwork ever thrust in faces. It was all done on trust, a principle that John held dear throughout his life. And it was John's managerial, production and engineering skills which were to assist the likes of Crass, Bjork, Chumbawamba, Fugazi, Shellac, The Jesus And Mary Chain, Slint and Babes In Toyland into the public domain,\n\nBorn near Plymouth, educated at a boarding school that he didn't like, John studied electrical engineering at London's City University. Details of his early history are brief because he didn't like talking about himself. John was one of those people who appears to have been born on their 20th birthday.\n\nFor every band that made it on to Crass Records, 10 were turned away. Crass's ideology was uncompromising and, as John felt, many good bands were losing the chance of public exposure. As a response, in partnership with his artist wife Sue, he created several labels and Southern Distribution, to ensure that they found a market. Aided by a small team to whom John was devoted, Southern grew into the international force that it is today.\n\nJohn resisted many attempts over the years to rein him in; as other independents collapsed, Southern survived, as majors conglomerated and became increasingly bland, Southern remained a vibrant voice in the wilderness. When bands got too big for their boots or managers began to burn his ears, John would suggest they go elsewhere. In the truest sense, Southern was a cottage industry, it placed people before profit.\n\nMedia requests for interviews with John always drew a blank, he displayed a reticence which extended even to his closest friends. For that reason very few people were aware that during the last 18 months he had been battling with a brain tumour which finally killed him.\n\nBut just as John's studio has become legendary, so has his insistence that quality of product should come before quantity: his angle, small is beautiful, was the big idea.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Sue, and daughter, Natasha.\n\n\u00b7 John Loder, record producer, born April 7 1946; died August 12 2005."}, {"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-loder-mn0000238526/biography", "page_content": "Producer and engineer John Loder founded the landmark Southern Studios and its accompanying record label and distribution network, all potent forces in the emergence and continued longevity of post-punk. Born April 7, 1946, outside of Plymouth, England, Loder briefly studied electrical engineering at London's City University, but music was his obsession -- in particular experimental and avant-garde recordings -- and in 1970 he began collaborating with the avant outfit Exit. With earnings saved from a short tenure driving a taxi, by 1972 Loder had assembled his own multi-track sound system, and two years later opened a recording studio in the garage of his North London home.\n\nHe spent the mid-'70s writing and recording advertising jingles, but in 1977 crossed paths with fellow Exit alum Penny Rimbaud, who in the interim co-founded the punk group Crass. Soon Loder was installed as the band's recording engineer and financial adviser, and with a few additional improvements his garage was officially opened as Southern Studios. With Rimbaud, he also founded Crass Records, and the staunch D.I.Y. ethics of studio and label alike -- no contracts or paperwork, just handshake deals and mutual trust -- earned enormous respect from punk artists and fans.\n\nOver the years to follow, Loder created several additional labels and also Southern Distribution to ensure a home and retail channels for worthy bands that might otherwise go unnoticed. His production and managerial portfolio ultimately swelled to include a who's who of underground acts including Bj\u00f6rk, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Fugazi, Shellac, and Slint, and despite the music industry's trend towards consolidation, the Southern empire remained as fiercely independent as its owner. After battling a brain tumor, Loder died August 12, 2005, at the age of 59."}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/john-loder-sound-engineer/biography", "page_content": "John Loder Biography\n\nMusical artist\n\nJohn F. Loder (7 April 1946 \u2013 12 August 2005) was an English sound engineer, record producer and founder of Southern Studios, as well as a former member of EXIT and co-founder of the Southern Records distribution company with his wife Sue. He was also the studio engineer of choice for Cr* and Cr* Records, and was often considered to be the band's \"ninth member\".\n\nLoder was born near Plymouth and educated at boarding school before studying electrical engineering at London's City University. During his post-graduate work there, he became involved in early experiments in digital encoding of audio for the military. By 1970 he had joined EXIT, alongside Penny Rimbaud, utilising a one-track tape-recorder. This led to Loder eventually founding a record studio in his garage after the disbanding of EXIT in 1974. Loder was recording advertising jingles in 1977 when his path crossed once again with Rimbaud, who had by then co-founded Cr*, and invited Loder to become the band's engineer and financial manager, roles Loder happily accepted.\n\nWhen Cr* founded their own record label, Loder worked as an engineer on most of the label's releases, and when Loder saw potential in a number of bands turned away by Cr* Records, Loder set up Southern Records.\n\nLoder engineered and produced for many bands other than Cr*, among them the Jesus and Mary Chain (for whom he engineered the recordings of the Psychocandy album), Big Black (Songs About *), PJ Harvey, Babes in Toyland, Fugazi (mastering the vinyl edition of 2001's The Argument), Ministry and Shellac (mastering 2000's 1000 Hurts). American musician and recording engineer Steve Albini (member of Big Black and Shellac), has spoken highly of Loder and described him as a critical influence:\n\nWhen I was in Big Black we did a session with him, and I thought he was a terrific engineer. He showed me the potential for getting the most out of the equipment without making the equipment the focus of attention. He knew how to do things quickly and with great sensitivity to the band, and had a complete working knowledge of his equipment. In any situation he could snap his fingers and do the right thing, because he knew exactly how things worked and what to do.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Loder established a television production facility at Southern. Its notable output included the music show Snub TV, which after first being syndicated nationwide in the US, went on to further success on BBC2 and in other countries.\n\nLoder was responsible for encouraging and establishing independent alternative ezines, donating the use of Southern's servers and bandwidth, taking part in pioneering online media streaming and simulcasting.\n\nLoder died of a brain tumour on 12 August 2005, aged 59.\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-01-20-mn-979-story.html", "page_content": "Times Staff Writer\n\nJohn Loder, the aristocratic and debonair romantic star of films that began with early American silents and extended over more than three decades, has died at the age of 90.\n\nThe New York Times said in its Thursday editions that he died somewhere in England late last month.

He worked in Hollywood for two periods, becoming an American citizen in 1947. After living also in Argentina, he became a naturalized British citizen in 1959.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nLoder was born in 1898 in Knightsbridge, London. His father was W. H. M. Lowe, a British career army officer who achieved the rank of general. Patrick Pearse, the leader of the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin, Ireland, surrendered to him. Both were present at the surrender. Loder's mother was Frances Broster Johnson (n\u00e9e de Salvo; 1857\u20131942), daughter of Francesco de Salvo of Palermo, Sicily and his English wife, Emma Broster. Frances was widowed when she married Lowe; she had been married to the late Captain Robert Harry Johnson of the 64th Foot Regiment. Loder had a younger sister, Elizabeth, who would later become a nun. He had also three older half-siblings from his mother's first marriage: Harry Cecil Johnson, Dorothy Johnson and Gladys Frances McGrath (n\u00e9e Johnson; formerly Kingsmill).\n\nLoder was educated at Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Berkshire.\n\nWorld War One\n\nLoder followed his father into the army, being commissioned into 15th Hussars as a second lieutenant on 17 March 1915, during the First World War. He was immediately sent to Gallipoli, where he served until the British withdrawal.\n\nFrom 21 April until early May 1916, Loder was stationed in Ireland, serving as his father's ADC, and where they both witnessed the surrender of the leaders of the Easter Rising.\n\nHe rejoined his regiment in Rouen, France, in May 1916, and was engaged in the 1916 Battle of the Somme.\n\nHe was taken prisoner by the Germans on 21 March 1918 at the village of Roisel and transported to Le Cateau gaol and then by train to the first of several prisoner-of-war camps, Rastatt, in Baden, Germany.\n\nUpon being released, Loder stayed in Germany where he was *igned military duties on behalf of the Inter-Allied Commission in Breslau and Upper Silesia.\n\nGermany\n\nLeaving the cavalry, Loder went into business with a German friend, Walter Becker, establishing a pickle factory in Potsdam. Later he began to develop an interest in acting. He appeared at the British Theatre Guild in Berlin and enjoyed success in productions of The Last of Mrs Cheyney, which had opened in London in 1925, and Loyalties.\n\nHe began appearing in bit parts in a few German films produced at the Tempelhof Film Studios including Dancing Mad (1925). He had a good part in Madame Wants No Children (1926), directed by Alexander Korda before going on to appear in numerous films in the next two years: The Last Waltz, The White Spider, The Great Unknown, all in 1927; and Alraune, Fair Game, When the Mother and the Daughter, Casanova's Legacy, The Sinner, and Adam and Eve, all released in 1928.\n\nBritish films\n\nLoder left Germany to return briefly to the United Kingdom. He had a support role in The First Born (1928), playing Madeleine Carroll's love interest. That year he sailed to the United States on the SS:\u00cele de France, bound for Hollywood to try his luck in the new medium of \"talkies\".\n\nFirst period in Hollywood\n\nLoder was signed by Paramount Studios. He appeared in The Case of Lena Smith (1929) directed by European Josef Von Sternberg. He made The Doctor's Secret (1929), Paramount's first talking picture, playing Ruth Chatterton's leading man. He appeared opposite Jack Holt in a Western, Sunset P* (1929). But his very English persona in these roles did not win over viewers in the United States.\n\nHe also appeared in Black Waters (1929), the first British talkie, which was made in the US by producer Herbert Wilcox, and The Unholy Night (1929) at MGM. Loder made some for Pathe: Her Private Affair (1929), The Racketeer (1929), and Rich People (1930).\n\nAlexander Korda had also moved to Hollywood and cast Loder in Lilies of the Field (1930). This was produced by Warners studio, which also used Loder in The Second Floor Mystery (1930), Sweethearts and Wives (1930), The Man Hunter (1931) (a Rin Tin Tin film), and One Night at Susie's (1931). He went to Fox studios for Seas Beneath (1931) directed by John Ford. That year he also appeared in a film for Hal Roach at MGM, On the Loose (1931).\n\nReturn to Britain\n\nLoder returned to Britain. He starred in a comedy for Herbert Wilcox, Money Means Nothing (1932), and was reunited with Korda in Wedding Rehearsal (1933).\n\nLoder pursued Merle Oberon in The Battle (1933) and had the star role in Money for Speed (1933) opposite Ida Lupino. He was in You Made Me Love You (1933), and that year had a small part in Korda's hugely successful The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933), playing the love interest of Elsa Lanchester's Anne of Cleeves.\n\nLoder had lead roles in low-budget, quota quickies such as Paris Plane (1933) and Rolling in Money (1934) as well as the romantic male lead in the Gracie Fields vehicle, Love, Life and Laughter (1934).\n\nLoder specialised in leading man parts in Warn London (1934); Java Head (1934) with Anna May Wong; Sing As We Go (1934) with Fields again, and a big hit; My Song Goes Round the World (1934); Lorna Doone (1934), as John Ridd; and 18 Minutes (1935).\n\nHe was top billed in The Silent P*enger (1935) and It Happened in Paris (1935) and supported in the Mozart biopic, Whom the Gods Love (1936). Loder was reunited with Gracie Fields in Queen of Hearts (1936) and starred in an IRA drama, Ourselves Alone (1936). He had a part in Guilty Melody (1936) and supported Boris Karloff in The Man Who Changed His Mind (1936).\n\nLoder played the heroic investigator in Alfred Hitch*'s Sabotage (1936), replacing Robert Donat before taking on the role of Sir Henry Curtis, the male romantic interest in the 1937 original film version of King Solomon's Mines, romancing Anna Lee.\n\nHe romanced Margaret Lockwood in Doctor Syn (1937), supporting George Arliss. He and Anna Lee were reunited in Non-Stop New York (1937), and he took on Erich von Stroheim in Under Secret Orders (1937).\n\nLoder and Lockwood romanced again in support of a crusty old actor in Owd Bob (1938), before he went to France to appear in Katia (1938) with Danielle Darrieux, in which he played Alexander II of Russia.\n\nHe returned to Britain and starred in thrillers Anything to Declare? (1939), The Silent Battle (1939) with Rex Harrison, and Murder Will Out (1939). He had the *le role in Meet Maxwell Archer (1940).\n\nReturn to Hollywood\n\nAfter Britain entered the Second World War, Loder returned to the United States. He coasted into a career in B movie roles, usually playing upper-crust characters. He also played one role onstage on Broadway, in 1947's For Love or Money opposite June Lockhart.\n\nHe was in Adventure in Diamonds (1940) and Diamond Frontier (1940). At 20th Century Fox he made Tin Pan Alley (1940), Scotland Yard (1941), and How Green Was My Valley (1941), in which he played a brother of Roddy McDowall's character.\n\nHe also worked in such war films as Confirm or Deny (1941), One Night in Lisbon (1941), and Eagle Squadron (1941).\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nIn Now, Voyager (1942), he played a wealthy widower engaged to Bette Davis's character. That was made by Warners who used Loder in Gentleman Jim (1942) as Errol Flynn's love rival. Warners gave him a then-rare lead in a B move, The Gorilla Man (1943), The Mysterious Doctor (1943), Murder on the Waterfront (1943), and Adventure in Iraq (1943).\n\nHe was back with Bette Davis in Old Acquaintance (1943) and supported Humphrey Bogart in P*age to Marseille (1944).\n\nIn the early 1940s, Loder was host of Silver Theater, a dramatic anthology on CBS radio. He also starred in the programme's 11 June 1944 episode.\n\nFreelance\n\nLoder freelanced as an actor. He had support roles in The Hairy Ape (1944), and Abroad with Two Yanks (1944), then had a lead part in some B films: The Brighton Strangler (1945), Jealousy (1945), A Game of Death (1945) (a remake of The Most Dangerous Game), and The Wife of Monte Cristo (1946).\n\nHe supported in an A film, One More Tomorrow (1946) and appeared opposite then-wife Hedy Lamarr in Dishonored Lady (1947). Loder then appeared in a minor Broadway hit in For Love or Money (1947\u201348). Around this time he began to focus increasingly on business as opposed to acting.\n\nLater career\n\nLoder's later film appearances included British films The Story of Esther Costello (1957), Small Hotel (1957), and Gideon's Day (1958). His last film was The Firechasers (1971).\n\nPersonal life, marriages and children\n\nHe was unmarried when he fathered his first son. The boy followed his father to Eton and served in the Grenadier Guards. He later became a theatrical and literary agent, and was married three times. Loder's son, Robin Lowe, was married to British actress Hilary Tindall (1938\u20131992). She played Ann Hammond in the 1970s BBC TV series The Brothers.\n\nIn 1932 Loder was named in the divorce proceedings of Wanda Holden and Charles Baillie-Hamilton, a former MP.\n\nLoder was married five times; two of his wives were actresses.\n\nHe first married French star Micheline Cheirel (married 1936\u201341 \u2013 they had one daughter together, who later married Paul Meurisse).\n\nSecondly, he wed Austrian-American actress Hedy Lamarr in the United States (married 1943\u201347). He and Lamarr had three children together: James Markey Loder (born 1939), when Lamarr was married to Gene Markey; they adopted this boy and she said he was unrelated; Loder adopted him after their marriage; Denise (born 1945) and Anthony Loder (born 1947). Do*entation found after Lamarr's death was reported in 2001 to reveal that James was born to Lamarr and Loder before their marriage.\n\nHedy Lamarr and Loder in 1946\n\nLoder's other wives were Sophie Kabel, Evelyn Auff Mordt, and finally, in 1958, the heiress Alba Julia Lagomarsino of Argentina. After their marriage, he lived on her 25,000-acre cattle ranch and spent much time at the Jockey Club in Buenos Aires.\n\nAfter they divorced in 1972, Loder returned to London. He resided for some years in a house opposite Harrods department store.\n\nIn 1947, Loder had become an American citizen. In 1959, he became a naturalised citizen of the United Kingdom. Given his varied residencies, he had been considered of \"uncertain nationality\" by that time.\n\nLater years\n\nHe published his autobiography, Hollywood Hussar, in 1977. Loder's general health deteriorated in his eighties, and he was admitted in 1982 to the Distressed Gentlefolks Aid *ociation's Nursing Home in Vicarage Gate, Kensington. He went weekly by taxi to his London club, 'Bucks', in Mayfair, for luncheon. He died in London, aged 90, in 1988.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nLoder is the focus of the play The Private View: Fairytales of Ireland 1916\u20132016, written by Trevor White and directed by Gerard Stembridge. The play was staged by The Little Museum of Dublin as part of the Dublin Theatre Festival in October 2015, and was performed at the American Irish Historical Society in November of the same year.\n\nFilmography\n\nDancing Mad (1925) as Dance extra (uncredited)\n\n(1925) as Dance extra (uncredited) Madame Wants No Children (1926) as Dancer (uncredited)\n\n(1926) as Dancer (uncredited) The Last Waltz (1927)\n\n(1927) The White Spider (1927) as Lord Gray\n\n(1927) as Lord Gray The Great Unknown (1927) as Dr. Ralf Hallam\n\n(1927) as Dr. Ralf Hallam Alraune (1928) as Der Vicomte\n\n(1928) as Der Vicomte Fair Game (1928) as Oberleutnant von Rohnstedt\n\n(1928) as Oberleutnant von Rohnstedt When the Mother and the Daughter (1928)\n\n(1928) Casanova's Legacy (1928)\n\n(1928) The Sinner (1928) as Armand\n\n(1928) as Armand The First Born (1928) as Lord David Harborough\n\n(1928) as Lord David Harborough Adam and Eve (1928)\n\n(1928) The Case of Lena Smith (1929) (uncredited)\n\n(1929) (uncredited) The Doctor's Secret (1929) as Hugh Paton\n\n(1929) as Hugh Paton Sunset P* (1929) as Ashleigh Preston\n\n(1929) as Ashleigh Preston Black Waters (1929) as Charles\n\n(1929) as Charles The Unholy Night (1929) as Capt.

He also was a sought-after session musician. Legend was the first African American man to win all four major North American entertainment awards (EGOT: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony).\n\nStephens was born into a musically gifted working-class family. His mother directed a church choir, while his grandmother played organ and his father and brother played drums at the church. He took piano lessons and sang in the church choir as a child. His parents homeschooled him for several of his elementary-school years. After he graduated from high school, he attended the University of Pennsylvania (B.A., 1999). He then moved to New York City, working for the Boston Consulting Group by day and playing piano and singing in nightclubs; he sold self-produced CDs (John Stephens [2000] and Live at Jimmy\u2019s Uptown [2001]) at those appearances. In 2001 he was introduced to the up-and-coming producer Kanye West and began contributing keyboard music and backing vocals to tracks by other artists, among them Alicia Keys, Talib Kweli, and the Black-Eyed Peas. During that time he adopted the stage name John Legend.\n\nBritannica Quiz Pop Culture Quiz\n\nLegend worked on West\u2019s debut album as a rap musician, The College Dropout (2004). After West formed his own label (G.O.O.D. Records) with Sony Music, the first album he produced was Legend\u2019s major-label debut, Get Lifted, released in the final week of 2004. Buoyed by the ballad \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d the album rose up European and American popular-music and rhythm-and-blues charts. It garnered eight Grammy Award nominations and won for best R&B album and best male R&B vocal performance. In addition, Legend took the award for best new artist. His sophomore effort, Once Again (2006), won plaudits as well as Legend\u2019s second Grammy for best male R&B vocal performance (for the single \u201cHeaven\u201d). Legend was a cowinner (with Joss Stone and Van Hunt) of the award for best R&B performance by a duo or group with vocals for their rendition of the Sly and the Family Stone song \u201cFamily Affair\u201d on the tribute album Different Strokes by Different Folks.\n\nLegend\u2019s popularity continued with his 2008 studio release, Evolver. His 2010 collaboration with the Roots, Wake Up!, won three Grammys\u2014best R&B album, best traditional R&B vocal performance (\u201cHang On in There\u201d), and best R&B song (\u201cShine\u201d). In 2013 his album Love in the Future yielded the smash hit single \u201cAll of Me.\u201d The following year Legend and rapper Common recorded the gospel-influenced song \u201cGlory,\u201d written by them for the film Selma (2014). The song, which invokes a call to end racial injustice, won both a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award for best original song. Legend\u2019s fifth studio album, Darkness and Light (2016), yielded the hit song \u201cLove Me Now\u201d and featured collaborations with Chance the Rapper, Miguel, and Brittany Howard of Alabama Shakes. Bigger Love appeared in 2020, and it later won a Grammy for best R&B album.\n\nIn 2017 Legend coproduced August Wilson\u2019s Jitney on Broadway, and he received a Tony Award when the drama was named best play revival. The following year Legend played the title role in a well-received live telecast of the 1970 rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar. As a coproducer, he garnered a Creative Arts Emmy Award when the show won for best live variety special. With that honour, he completed his EGOT. In 2019 Legend became a coach on the televised singing competition The Voice.\n\nLegend also won praise for his philanthropic efforts, in particular his work to improve educational opportunities in poor communities."}]}
