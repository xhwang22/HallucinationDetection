A pair of homemade bombs detonated in the crowd watching the race, killing 3 people and injuring more than 260.\n\nThe attacks Boston Marathon bombing The marathon is traditionally held on Patriots\u2019 Day, a public holiday in Massachusetts that commemorates the American Revolutionary War Battles of Lexington and Concord. The festive atmosphere draws hundreds of thousands of spectators to the 26-mile 385-yard (42,195-metre) route from Hopkinton, Massachusetts, to Boston\u2019s Back Bay neighbourhood. More than 26,000 runners participated in the race in 2013, marking the 117th time that the world\u2019s oldest annual marathon had been contested. About five hours into the race, the first bomb exploded less than half a block from the finish line, on the north side of Boylston Street. Roughly 12 seconds later a second bomb exploded some 600 feet (180 metres) from the first. It too was planted on the north side of Boylston Street amid a crowd of onlookers. First responders reacted immediately, and a medical tent that had been erected to treat runners was turned into an emergency medical facility. Three bombing victims died of their injuries, and more than 100 of the seriously injured were transferred to area hospitals as local police and federal investigators surveyed a crime scene that covered 15 square blocks. In the days following the attacks, law-enforcement personnel solicited assistance from the public, asking for photographs or video footage that might prove relevant to their investigation. It was revealed that devices used in the attacks were household pressure cookers that had been packed with an explosive substance, nails, and ball bearings\u2014the latter two elements acting as shrapnel when the bombs detonated. On April 18 the Federal Bureau of Investigation released images and video of two men identified as suspects in the attacks, including one photograph that showed one of the men placing a package at the location of the second explosion.\n\nThe manhunt Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Within hours the fatal shooting of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus police officer in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the armed carjacking of a sport-utility vehicle in Boston\u2019s Allston neighbourhood spurred speculation about a possible connection between those crimes and the marathon bombing. Police pursued the stolen vehicle to the Boston suburb of Watertown, and an intense firefight ensued. Improvised explosive devices were thrown at the police, as many as 300 rounds were exchanged, and a police officer was shot and wounded. During the gun battle, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, identified as one of the two suspects in the bombing, was seriously wounded by explosives and multiple gunshots. He was apprehended by police, but he was further injured when the second suspect\u2014his younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev\u2014struck him with a car as he fled the scene. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was taken to a hospital and was pronounced dead in the early morning hours of April 19. With one suspect dead and the other on the run, police launched a massive house-to-house manhunt that covered the surrounding area. Much of Greater Boston came to an unprecedented standstill as officials requested that residents remain in their homes and that businesses not open. The \u201cstay home\u201d order was lifted at 6:00 pm on April 19, and a Watertown resident whose house was several blocks from the shoot-out went to his backyard to check on the boat that was parked there. He noticed that its protective tarp had come loose and, while adjusting it, he observed Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hiding in the boat. Police soon arrived, and after a short standoff Tsarnaev was taken into custody. On April 22 federal prosecutors charged him with having used a weapon of mass destruction in the marathon attacks. After a two-week trial, on April 8, 2015, Tsarnaev was found guilty on 30 counts in connection with the bombing; 17 of those charges carried the possibility of the death penalty. On May 15, 2015, Tsarnaev was sentenced to death. In July 2020 a federal appellate court vacated the death sentence against Tsarnaev, stating that the original trial judge should have allowed the admission of evidence that may have affected his sentencing. In March 2022 that ruling was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, and the death penalty was reimposed. Get a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Picked u as one of our best dressed stars: http://t.co/MuzJoPRuMh\u201d \u2014 Hilaria Baldwin (@hilariabaldwin) June 7, 2013\n\nIn an April 2020 podcast interview with Mom Truths, Baldwin chose her words carefully when asked about her past.\n\n\u201cI moved here when I was 19 to go to NYU,\u201d Baldwin says.\n\n\u201cFrom?\u201d the hosts interjects.\n\n\u201cFrom \u2014 my family lives in Spain,\u201d Baldwin responded.\n\nHilaria Baldwin went on the #momtruths podcast in April 2020 and said she didn\u2019t move to the US until she was 19 to go to NYU pic.twitter.com/s1BojT4XAH \u2014 #1 Rachel (@rachel) December 27, 2020\n\nBut in Baldwin\u2019s Instagram post Sunday, she said she was born in Boston.\n\n\u201cI was born in Boston and grew up spending time with my family between Massachusetts and Spain,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cMy parents and sibling live in Spain and I chose to live here, in the USA. We celebrate both cultures in our home \u2014 Alec and I are raising our children bilingual, just as I was raised.\u201d\n\nAlthough Hilaria Baldwin\u2019s parents now reside in Spain, it appears that neither of them are originally from the country.\n\nAs her father, David L. Thomas Jr., put it in a 2015 blog post for International Integrators: \u201cMy path in life has been heavily influenced by Spanish language and culture, and not because I have an iota of latin blood in my veins.\u201d\n\nWhat about Hilaria Baldwin\u2019s accent?\n\nBaldwin has made numerous media appearances, including segments on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and \u201cToday,\u201d in which her accent is inconsistent.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIn one example noted by Twitter user @lenibriscoe, Baldwin appears to forget the English word for cucumber.\n\nHere she is pretending not to know how to say cucumber in English \ud83d\ude2d pic.twitter.com/g8xYNktsNY \u2014 elena ilana alana alina elana (not) (@lenibriscoe) December 21, 2020\n\nIn Baldwin\u2019s Instagram video addressing the controversy, she speaks without a Spanish accent.\n\nWhat do Cambridge School of Weston classmates and staff have to say?\n\nMany people in the replies to @LeniBriscoe\u2019s viral thread claimed to be classmates of Baldwin\u2019s from her days at Cambridge School of Weston, where Hillary Hayward-Thomas graduated from in 2002.\n\n\u201cI went to high school with her,\u201d one 2002 CSW grad tweeted. \u201cGenuinely lovely person, I recall, but fully a white girl from Cambridge.\u201d\n\n\u201cHillary was kind and hard working,\u201d another \u201902 grad tweeted. \u201cAnd, yes, a white girl from Boston.\u201d\n\nOne former CSW teacher who did not want their name used for publication, said that Baldwin had no trace of a Spanish accent at CSW.\n\n\u201cHer CSW name was Hillary,\u201d the teacher said. \u201cShe had ZERO Spanish accent. She was a good kid, kinda quiet (at least from a teacher\u2019s perspective). And she was a gifted dancer \u2014 phenomenal.\u201d\n\nHow did Hilaria and Alec respond?\n\nBoth Hilaria and Alec have posted multiple responses on Twitter and Instagram (some of which were later deleted) giving context to Hilaria\u2019s cultural background and cast aspersions on internet haters.\n\nIn her initial Instagram video, Baldwin said that because she was raised speaking both English and Spanish, her accent sometimes fluctuates.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of back-and-forth my entire life, and I\u2019m really lucky that I grew up speaking two languages,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cWhen I tried to work, I try to enunciate a little bit more, but when I get nervous or upset, then I start to mix the two.\u201d\n\nBaldwin also said that her whole family and some friends call her Hilaria, while others have used Hillary. Baldwin said that she eventually decided to \u201cconsolidate\u201d to just Hilaria, citing the confusion having multiple different names on various forms can cause, such as picking up a prescription at a pharmacy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same name, just a few letters different, so I think we shouldn\u2019t be so upset about it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd whatever you guys want to call me, I will respond to both.\u201d\n\nIn the past few days, numerous online critics have called Hilaria \u201ca white girl from Boston,\u201d a label she appeared to embrace Sunday. \u201cYes I am a white girl,\u201d she said. \u201cEurope has a lot of white people in there. My family is white. Ethnically I am a mix of many, many, many things; culturally, I grew up with the two cultures. So it\u2019s really as simple as that.\u201d\n\nBaldwin said she was \u201cproud\u201d to be raised in a bilingual household, and to be raising her children in one as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud that I speak two languages, and I\u2019m proud that I have two cultures,\u201d she said in her Instagram. \u201cI\u2019m proud that I\u2019m raising my kids that way. I\u2019m proud that my family is that way. And I don\u2019t really think that that\u2019s a negative thing.\u201d\n\nIn a second video Sunday, Baldwin questioned \u201cwhy this is turning into such a big thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never said that my mother was Spanish, my family is a big mix of so many different things,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cMy thing is about being authentic and when people say I\u2019m not being authentic, it hurts my feelings \u2026 I don\u2019t really understand why this is turning into such a big thing. I want to take it seriously, but I also don\u2019t want it to be all of a sudden I\u2019m apologizing for who I am. Because at this point, I\u2019m starting to feel that I\u2019m being attacked for who I am, and that no answer is the right answer.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAlec Baldwin, meanwhile, posted a lengthy video criticizing social media in general, slamming the founders of Facebook and alluding to conspiracy theories like Pizzagate. Baldwin eventually advised his 1.9 million Instagram followers to \u201cconsider the source\u201d of the gossip about his wife.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s things that have been said lately about people I love and care about deeply which are ridiculous,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI mean, just ridiculous. Consider the source. Consider the source.\u201d\n\nHilaria\u2019s stepdaughter, Ireland Baldwin Basinger (from Alec\u2019s previous marriage to Kim Basinger), defended Hilaria as well in her Instagram Story, calling her \u201ca wonderful mother who takes great care of her kids\u201d and \u201cgreat care of my dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so pathetic that anyone would want to play detective and dig that deep into someone\u2019s life that they don\u2019t know anything about, don\u2019t know how they were raised, don\u2019t know who they were raised by,\u201d Ireland said. \u201cAnd the last thing we really need to do is start s*** and gossip about something just so, so stupid.\u201d A representative for Baldwin did not respond to a Boston.com request for comment.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nCritics say that Baldwin\u2019s alleged adoption of a culture that isn\u2019t hers has crowded out space for Hispanics and Latinas, citing Baldwin\u2019s magazine appearances as an example.\n\nAura Bogado, an investigative reporter for Reveal, criticized Latina Magazine for elevating Baldwin in its pages.\n\n\u201cFor nearly a decade, @Latina touted @hilariabaldwin, a white woman with white parents from Massachusetts,\u201d Bogado wrote. \u201cDuring this time, the magazine has been accused of erasing black latinas, and publishing pieces about how white latinas are somehow discriminated for not being dark enough.\n\n\u201cThe fact that @hilariabaldwin pretended to be from Spain with that ridiculous accent, while some of us have been denied opportunities for our actual accents, is disgusting. The fact that she pretended to be an immigrant, at a time of hatred, detention, and deportation, is sick.\u201d\n\nThe fact that @hilariabaldwin pretended to be from Spain with that ridiculous accent, while some of us have been denied opportunities for our actual accents, is disgusting.
