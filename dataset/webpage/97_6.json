{"David King is currently a commentator for Fox Footy.": [{"url": "https://www.sen.com.au/news/2023/04/03/david-king-defends-fox-footys-studio-broadcast-talks-showdown-medal-voting/", "page_content": "Controversy surrounded Saturday night\u2019s Showdown \u2013 but not because of anything that happened on the field.\n\nFox Footy has come under fire for broadcasting the game from their Victorian studio, rather than being at the ground, while the voting panel has been criticised for awarding the Showdown Medal to Jordan Dawson.\n\nIzak Rankine kicked four goals and Riley Thilthorpe kicked five, but the pair didn\u2019t feature in the top three of the voting.\n\nSpeaking first on Fox Footy\u2019s decision to broadcast the Showdown from Victoria, King says, while it\u2019s unfortunate, the commentators actually have just as much if not more to work with from the studio than live at Adelaide Oval.\n\n\u201cCan we give a bit of background on this? Because I\u2019m getting crushed for not being there (at the ground),\u201d King told SEN\u2019s Whateley.\n\n\u201cThe flippant discussion that we watch the game off a TV screen couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Unfortunately for a whole host of reasons we\u2019re calling from the studios. Not going to get involved in that.\n\n\u201cWe can see everything. We can see the whole field. We\u2019ve got a wall of screens. I\u2019ve got the ability to look behind the ball, forward of the ball, wherever your eyes go on game day, it\u2019s the same except it\u2019s on a wall screen.\n\n\u201cTo say we\u2019re missing things is wrong. You can see whatever you need to see and I have no problem with that and then combining that and the feel of the game and seeing player impact.\n\n\u201cThen we have the screen that people see at home and the end product, which is the main screen we look at. When you first go into television, the bosses say just call and talk about things people can see. There\u2019s no point talking about what\u2019s behind the ball if people can\u2019t see it.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re statistically minded like I am, I\u2019ve got a more detailed statistical setup than the average person has at the game, I\u2019d in fact mount a case that I\u2019ve got more information than those at the ground because that\u2019s real.\n\n\u201cNow, I don\u2019t hear the crowd roar. And I don\u2019t get to see who wins the toss from time to time \u2026 all those sorts of things, to me it\u2019s not really an impact for assessing a game.\n\n\u201cI understand why people are put out by us not being there from time to time or regularly, but I don\u2019t get the rationale that we don\u2019t see the ground because that is 100 per cent wrong.\n\n\u201cDoes it impact cricket? I think it does, but I don\u2019t think it impacts footy.\u201d\n\nKing gave Rankine three votes for his four-goal effort in the Showdown, but was the only one on the panel who gave the forward a vote.\n\nScott Camporeale, Simeon Thomas-Wilson, Josh Francou and Rhett Biglands all included Dawson in their votes, with King preferring Rankine, Rory Laird and Connor Rozee.\n\nLaird was impactful for the Crows with 11 clearances, while Rozee finished with 28 and a goal.\n\nDawson won the medal with nine votes, from Reilly O\u2019Brien with six and Rozee at three.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the other votes I had this sick feeling and thought \u2018have I got this totally wrong here\u2019. You straight away think \u2018someone\u2019s in trouble here\u2019. I was hoping it wasn\u2019t me!\u201d King said.\n\n\u201cA guy kicked five and I didn\u2019t give him a vote, that\u2019s probably the main feedback I\u2019m getting.\n\n\u201cI assessed Rankine\u2019s impact as greater than anyone on the ground. I gave him three. I was the only one to give him a vote. And Laird.\n\n\u201cRankine had the biggest moments. You could\u2019ve mounted a case for three or four players, but in the end you track back to what you value and when the game was in the arm wrestle, he was the reason why the Crows scored and the reason why they still had belief and the magic.\n\n\u201cThilthorpe was very good. If Laird wasn\u2019t there, he had 11 clearances for the day, they got smacked at clearances by Port, if he wasn\u2019t having a clearance impact it would\u2019ve been an avalanche to one end of the ground and Port would\u2019ve found a way to win.\n\n\u201cI thought Rozee was significant in the first three quarters of the game. Halfway through the last quarter Port was in front so the 30-point margin wasn\u2019t reflective of the game.\n\n\u201cAm happy not to do the voting again. It\u2019s just not worth the feedback.\u201d\n\nKing said he went home and watched the game again just to make sure of his votes!\n\n\u201cI saw the votes come through ahead of time and Dawson was in all the votes and Rankine wasn\u2019t and I thought oh wow. I was nervous that I\u2019d got it wrong,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI knew what the numbers were saying and what my eyes were saying.\n\n\u201cI actually went home and watched the game again. I can\u2019t believe I did that, but I needed to appease myself.\n\n\u201cIn the end it was a great game of footy and it\u2019s a shame we\u2019re talking about the votes and not what these young men were able to do.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsmoney.com/net-worth/david-king/", "page_content": "David King\u2018s source of wealth comes from being a australian rules footballer.

Their highly-vaunted midfield has been labelled \u201cinept\u201d by Fox Footy\u2019s David King after two rounds and a \u201creal concern\u201d for coach Luke Beveridge given his side \u201ccan\u2019t win the ball\u201d. The Dogs were smashed through the middle by St Kilda last weekend, finishing -13 in ground ball gets and -13 in tackles in just the first quarter alone. \u201cSome of these efforts were just really surprising. Blokes taking their eyes off the footy, just fumbling and being jittery,\u201d Fox Footy\u2019s Leigh Montagna said. \u201cFor some reason I\u2019m not sure why they are bereft of confidence.\u201d\n\nLions\u2019 burning question: Who provides the spark outside of Dayne Zorko?\n\nBrisbane looked out of sorts against Port Adelaide in Round 1, as they were essentially smashed in every facet of the game. Enter Round 2 and the return of former skipper Dayne Zorko. Despite as the Lions\u2019 \u201cangry ant\u201d by Nathan Buckley, Zorko provided an immediate spark as he slotted a first quarter goal and provided plenty of run through the middle. \u201cHe\u2019s been the spirit of this club for a long time. The ex-captain, five-time best and fairest winner, he brings a spark and an energy that the Lions didn\u2019t have last week,\u201d Jonathan Brown praised. But with Zorko 34, the question needs to be asked \u2013 who will step up to the mantle in Zorko\u2019s absence? Lachie Neale already carries a heavy burden as the club\u2019s premier mid, while Harris Andrews is deep in defence and not able to get involved across the ground. Coach Chris Fagan needs to find his next spark.\n\nCOLLINGWOOD v RICHMOND\n\nFriday March 31, 7:50pm at the MCG\n\nHow to watch on Fox Footy: Channel 504 from 7pm, with Garry Lyon, Jonathan Brown, Nathan Buckley, Jordan Lewis, Kath Loughnan and Jon Ralph, followed by Fox Footy Live with Drew Jones, Cameron Mooney and Nick Dal Santo.\n\nMagpies\u2019 burning question: Who can stop the \u2018Flagpies\u2019 run?\n\nCraig McRae and his band of merry men are simply dominating after two rounds of AFL action. The Magpies have shown their preliminary final run was no fluke as the team has improved exponentially in areas that held them back last season. After being ranked 17th in contested differential, Collingwood is now sitting first. Statistics show the Magpies are ranked No. 1 for ball movement, second for ball use and third for contest and clearance in warning signs for their rivals. \u201cTheir first two rounds were amazing. Offensive weapons everywhere and a style of play making the most of what they\u2019ve got,\u201d Fox Footy\u2019s Nathan Buckley said. \u201cWe love the way they play \u2013 it\u2019s exciting. (McRae\u2019s) come in clearly and given them confidence to just pull the trigger,\u201d Jonathan Brown added on On the Couch.\n\nTigers\u2019 burning question: Is it the former skipper to the rescue for Richmond?\n\nNo Dustin Martin and no Jacob Hopper for Richmond this week leaves the side \u201cthread bare\u201d according to Gerard Whateley and undermanned in the middle. But veteran Trent Cotchin looms as Richmond\u2019s potential saviour. The former skipper can rotate through the middle, and four-time premiership player Luke Hodge believes there\u2019s an even bigger role with Cotchin\u2019s name on it \u2013 shutting down Nick Daicos. \u201c(Play) as a defensive forward this week,\u201d he said on SEN. \u201cThere\u2019s a smart bloke who\u2019s disciplined and who knows how to find the footy. (Cotchin) can play a serious role for them. All he has to do is limit (Daicos) to 12,13, 15 touches and if Cotch kicks a goal, they\u2019d look at that as an even. There\u2019s a role for him \u2013 limit (Collingwood\u2019s) most attacking, best kick in the game and see if you can add value that way to the side.\u201d Fox Footy commentator Gerard Healy agreed that a defensive forward role has worked against Daicos in the past, pointing to Swan Ryan Clarke.\n\nHAWTHORN v NORTH MELBOURNE\n\nSaturday April 1, 1:45pm at UTAS, Tasmania\n\nHow to watch on Fox Footy: Channel 504 from 1.30pm, with Mark Howard, Kelli Underwood, Dermott Brereton, Nick Dal Santo and Ben Dixon.\n\nHawks\u2019 burning question: Are Hawthorn fighting too many battles?\n\nOff field drama and on field obstacles \u2026 The once-mighty Hawthorn has turned into a shambles in 2023 with questions asked over whether the club cut too harshly at the end of last season. Some even accused the club of a form of tanking, given how far they\u2019ve fallen. Sitting anchored at the bottom of the table with the worst attack (averaging 51 points per game) and worst defensive end (coughing up an average 121 points), Fox Footy\u2019s Mark Robinson warns \u201con every front, they are a mess\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019ve made this decision \u2013 no one is coaching this team to a lot of victories this year so everyone has got to chill out a little bit,\u201d he said on AFL 360. \u201cI said \u2026 \u2018settle down Hawks fans, you\u2019ve dominated the comp for a decade, now you know what it\u2019s like\u2019. But you\u2019ve got to have trust. You\u2019ve got have faith.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nKangaroos\u2019 burning question: How much has the Perth trip taken out of them?\n\nNorth Melbourne are riding high off of back-to-back wins to open the season \u2013 but how much of a toll has those wins taken? The trip to Perth is the most brutal in the competition; add on the fact the Roos are now off to Tasmania and the kilometres are really starting to add up. \u201cNorth Melbourne have had two really good wins, over in the west it\u2019s always hard to travel back and go down to Tasmania and travel down there,\u201d he said on AFL 360. On top of the physical toll is the mental side to the game. The Roos escaped with a thrilling dying second victory over Fremantle in emotional scenes on the sidelines from payers and staff alike including coach Alastair Clarkson. Now they have to get their heads back in the game against a Hawthorn side who are \u201cbacks against the wall\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s no easy feat.\n\nGWS GIANTS v CARLTON\n\nSaturday April 1, 4:35pm at GIANTS Stadium\n\nHow to watch on Fox Footy: Channel 504 from 4.30pm, with Anthony Hudson, Garry Lyon, Jason Dunstall and Alastair Lynch.\n\nGiants\u2019 burning question: How long can GWS run on \u2018Greene energy\u2019?\n\nGWS captain Toby Greene has certainly proved the firestarter for his side in the opening two rounds. He\u2019s kicked two bags of four goals, averaging 18.5 disposals per game. Fox Footy\u2019s Gerard Whateley questioned how long the club can rely on \u201cGreene energy\u201d in season 2023. Richmond forward Jack Riewoldt was full of praise for his rival: \u201cUndersized forwards are the hardest forwards to match up on,\u201d he said. \u201c(He\u2019s) a smoky for the Coleman. Toby just don\u2019t get suspended.\u201d Despite missing the first five games of 2022 due to suspension, Greene still finished with 37 goals to his name \u2013 going goalless just once in the 15 matches he played. He hit the scoreboard every match he played in 2021 \u2013 meaning he\u2019s now kicked goals in 35 of his past 36 matches.\n\nBlues\u2019 burning question: Have we already seen the proof they\u2019ve changed for the better?\n\nClearly the Blues\u2019 start has been promising \u2013 they\u2019re unbeaten through two rounds, with five games against teams that finished below them on the ladder in 2022 over the next five rounds. But the underlying numbers look even better. Last year, powered by Brownlow medallist Patrick Cripps, they were a team reliant on contested footy. With Sam Walsh and George Hewett on the injury list, they\u2019ve been unable to focus on that source \u2013 which is good because scoring from turnover is much more reliable. This year the Blues\u2019 points differential is +19 from turnovers (it was +0.6 last year), and -11.5 from clearances (+8.5 last year). So they\u2019re scoring the same amount overall, but from a much better source \u2013 and they should only get better at clearances once they\u2019re at full strength.\n\nST KILDA v ESSENDON\n\nSaturday April 1, 7:25pm at the MCG\n\nHow to watch on Fox Footy: Channel 504 from 7.15pm with Kath Loughnan, Brad Johnson and Jonathan Brown.\n\nSaints\u2019 burning question: Can the \u2018no name\u2019 St Kilda forwards get the job done?\n\nFox Footy\u2019s Nathan Buckley may have labelled St Kilda\u2019s attack end as \u201cno names\u201d, but not in a bad way. With Max King and Tim Membrey, they were \u201cso effective\u201d in attack last year as they reached 8-3. But with those two sidelined, the Saints have uncovered a few gems including Anthony Caminiti. Caminiti\u2019s journey to the AFL is bizarre, after he impressed Jack Silvagni at Carlton training. Silvagni\u2019s dad Steve swooped and landed Caminiti at St Kilda. \u201cCaminiti is the one who\u2019s just come from nowhere,\u201d Gerard Healy praised on SEN. \u201cOnce Steve Silvagni moves out of the talent ID, his son should move right in. (Caminiti) was superb again and looked dangerous.\u201d\n\nBombers\u2019 burning question: Can they continue their defensive gut run?\n\nUnder new coach Brad Scott, Essendon are opting to run and carry the ball at every opportunity. The Bombers are taking the game on in fantastic signs for the club\u2019s development, Fox Footy\u2019s Leigh Montagna believes. \u201cThis is what I love now, this defensive intent,\u201d he said on First Crack. \u201cThey would turn the ball over and use their talent, their run and carry to challenge them going back the other way. Gold Coast just couldn\u2019t go with them.\u201d Last week Essendon were ranked number one in the competition for metres gained by handball. In remarkable improvement on their 2022 efforts, the Bombers were also ranked fourth for pressure (up from 18th in 2022), third for tackles (up from 17th) and fourth in points off turnover differential \u2013 compared to 16th last season. The question now is \u2013 can they sustain it?\n\nPORT ADELAIDE v ADELAIDE CROWS\n\nSaturday April 1, 7:30pm at Adelaide Oval\n\nHow to watch on Fox Footy: Channel 503 from 7.25pm, with Dwayne Russell, Gerard Healy, David King and Mark Ricciuto.\n\nPower\u2019s burning question: Which Port Adelaide will turn up for the Showdown?\n\nAfter two rounds, it\u2019s like watching Jekyll and Hyde when it comes to the Power after a brilliant win over Brisbane and a shambolic loss to Collingwood in the space of seven days. In Round 1, Port Adelaide were unstoppable, precise and completely dominant through the middle of the ground as their young mids dismantled the Lions. But against the Magpies, the Power looked lost, uncertain and unable to win the tough ball. In contrast, the Power claimed 150 contested possessions in Rd 1, compared to just 98 against the Pies \u2013 a turnaround of -52! There was a -20 clearance differential between the two matches and -14 marks inside 50. The efficiency going into attack sat at just 42.6% in Rd 2 \u2013 down a whopping 18% on Rd 1. So which Port Adelaide turns up for the Showdown? Ken Hinkley will be hoping it\u2019s the Round 1 version.\n\nCrows\u2019 burning question: Is the much-praised forward line actually the problem?\n\nThe Crows don\u2019t appear to be lacking for talent in the front six with Izak Rankine joining the likes of Tex Walker, Darcy Fogarty and Josh Rachele, but for a fourth straight year Matthew Nicks\u2019 men are proving wasteful in front of goal. Numbers from the Pure Footy show revealed only Sydney and Collingwood have had more shots at goal this year, but Adelaide ranks 15th in the AFL for Champion Data\u2019s shot at goal rating. That comes after they ranked 18th in 2020, 16th in 2021 and 10th last year. Goalkicking arguably determined last Saturday\u2019s loss to Richmond \u2013 the actual score was 76-108, but the expected score was 86-91, suggesting the Crows were bad at converting in front of goal and the Tigers were very good. This appears to be a long-term issue; though at least they\u2019re creating chances.\n\n\n\n\n\nGOLD COAST SUNS v GEELONG\n\nSunday April 2, 2:10pm at Heritage Bank Stadium\n\nHow to watch on Fox Footy: Channel 504 from 2pm, with Anthony Hudson, Dermott Brereton, Cam Mooney, Alastair Lynch and Sarah Jones.\n\nSuns\u2019 burning question: Does Gold Coast coach Stuart Dew take a stand at selection?\n\nFox Footy\u2019s David King did not hold back in his assessment on the efforts of two Gold Coast players in the loss to Essendon. King highlighted plays from key-position duo Charlie Ballard and Jack Lukosius for particular scrutiny, claiming teammates should be \u201cfuming\u201d for their \u201cunacceptable\u201d plays. Big forward Mabior Chol was dropped last weekend \u2013 does Stuart Dew swing the axe again in their 0-2 start? \u201cI\u2019m in awe of the effort, attitude and application of Touk Miller, Matt Rowell, Noah Anderson, the big ruckman (Jarrod) Wicks, Nick Holman, Sam Collins; guys who maybe aren\u2019t front liners but play with everything they\u2019ve got,\u201d King said on First Crack. \u201cI watched Miller push himself, I watched Rowell go to the absolute extremes. Take a stand Gold Coast. Shift the course of your culture and not just drop guys because it\u2019s a name \u2026 drop them because of the effort they are providing.\u201d\n\nCats\u2019 burning question: Are they taking too many risks?\n\nWhile Collingwood has been lauded for its brave ball movement, it\u2018s actually Geelong taking the most chances by foot. Champion Data analyst Daniel Hoyne told Pure Footy the Cats\u2019 expected hit rate on their kicks this season, based on a 10-year AFL average of how many of those kicks have been made, is just 40 per cent. For context, the risky Pies\u2019 expected hit rate is 48 per cent, and last year the Cats\u2019 rate was 52 per cent. But the premiers aren\u2019t getting scoreboard return from these risks either \u2013 they\u2019re coughing up a horrendous 70.5 points per game from turnover, more than double last year\u2019s figure. They\u2019ve given up six goals a game from \u201cgiveaways\u201d \u2013 when they gift the ball straight back to the opposition, rather than having it taken away. If this is a tactic by Chris Scott, it is absolutely not working.\n\n\n\nMELBOURNE v SYDNEY SWANS\n\nSunday April 2, 3:20pm at the MCG\n\nHow to watch on Fox Footy: Channel 503 from 3pm, hosted by Sarah Jones with Jordan Lewis and Eddie Betts.\n\nDemons\u2019 burning question: Will Brodie Grundy be the ruck leader Melbourne need?\n\nBrodie Grundy was at the top of his game at the start of 2022, having signed a big money deal to essentially become a Magpie for life. But injury and then a bombshell trade to Melbourne to free up salary cap space at Collingwood ensured Grundy\u2019s career looked a lot different to start 2023. Now with Demons skipper Max Gawn\u2019s knee injury, there\u2019s a big opportunity for Grundy to take Melbourne\u2019s ruck mantle. Statistics show Grundy is ranked currently eighth for total hitouts but sits last for hit outs to advantage of the 25 ruckmen in the competition \u2013 with 0 scores coming from his hitouts. \u201cDoes he play the Max Gawn role that has worked so well for Melbourne,\u201d Fox Footy\u2019s Leigh Montagna questioned. \u201cOr do what we saw at Collingwood where he hovered in the corridor? They want him to get long down the line.\u201d David King said he doesn\u2019t think Grundy \u201ccan cover the ground\u201d to emulate the feats of Gawn. \u201cJust watching pre-season, he\u2019s miles off where Max is at,\u201d King added.\n\nSwans\u2019 burning question: Do Sydney still need Buddy Franklin?\n\nJust last week we put the Blowtorch on youngster Logan McDonald to see if his form without Lance Franklin could continue. And he kicked five goals in response. \u201cWhere does it leave Buddy in terms of the overall?\u201d On the Couch\u2019s Garry Lyon said. \u201cI reckon if there\u2019s one club that looks past names for instance and just chooses who its best side is, it\u2019s Sydney. That\u2019s the way Sydney goes about it,\u201d Nathan Buckley replied. Statistics show the Swans are averaging 90.4 points with Franklin and 99.4 points without him. But Buckley believes Franklin has the aerobic capacity to play a Jeremy Cameron-like role to get up the ground and turn for attack. \u201cI think he\u2019s got a spot,\u201d Buckley added.\n\nFREMANTLE v WEST COAST EAGLES\n\nSunday April 2, 5:20pm at Optus Stadium\n\nHow to watch on Fox Footy: Channel 504 from 5pm, with Adam Papalia, Dwayne Russell, Gerard Healy, Matthew Pavlich, Will Schofield and Kath Loughnan.\n\nDockers\u2019 burning question: Where do the goals come from?\n\nIt\u2019s deja vu for Fremantle as forward line woes continue to hurt the winless Dockers. Nat Fyfe was missing from that attack end in Round 2 while Matt Taberner has been well below par \u2013 subbed out from both matches by three quarter time. The Dockers have the third-worst forward line in the competition after two rounds \u2013 behind Hawthorn and the Western Bulldogs. Fox Footy\u2019s Nick Dal Santo believes the lack of goals stems from the lack of fast ball movement. \u201cThey are \u2018Freeze-mantle\u2019 at the moment,\u201d he said on AFL Tonight. \u201cThey are frozen in the spot, they have no flair in their game. What they\u2019ve put on the scoreboard at the moment ain\u2019t going to get it done.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEagles\u2019 burning question: Will West Coast keep running and taking the game on?\n\nThe Eagles have been poor at the contest for a number of seasons before they suddenly found their drive against GWS last weekend. West Coast finally won the inside 50, clearance and contested ball count in a single match in positive signs for coach Adam Simpson. The Eagles finished with their highest metres gained by handball since 2017, their highest kick forward percentage since 2021, the best ball movement stats since 2019 and the best ground ball differential since 2017. \u201cThey turned up on Sunday and played the sort of footy the modern game demands,\u201d On the Couch host Garry Lyon said. \u201cThey were a bit outdated.\u201d Fox Footy\u2019s Nathan Buckley believes Simpson gave his players free reign to run and carry. \u201cIt might have been all in, \u2018I don\u2019t care about the mistakes we make on the two v ones or the little marks\u2019,\u201d he said."}, {"url": "http://entertainmentbureau.com.au/portfolio-view/david-king/", "page_content": "DAVID KING\n\nAFL FOOTBALLER & TELEVISION PERSONALITY\n\nDavid King (born 7 March 1972) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the North Melbourne Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL).
