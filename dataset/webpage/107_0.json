Each seat is held by a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). MLAs are elected by eligible voters in their electoral district. Provincial elections are usually held every four years, on the third Saturday of October. However, an election may be called before this date. This sometimes happens when the party in power thinks it may help them win re-election. Elections may also occur before four years have passed in cases where the government no longer has the confidence of the Legislative Assembly (see Minority Government).\n\nAs with the other provinces and territories in Canada, British Columbia uses a first-past-the-post electoral system, meaning the candidate with the most votes in each electoral district wins. Typically, the party with the most seats forms the government, and the leader of this party becomes premier. However, a party with fewer seats may also form a coalition with members of another party or parties in order to form the government. Technically, as the Queen\u2019s representative, the lieutenant-governor holds the highest provincial office, though in reality this role is largely symbolic. (See also British Columbia Premiers: Table; British Columbia Lieutenant-Governors: Table.)\n\nThe premier typically appoints members of the Cabinet from among the MLAs who belong to the party in power. Cabinet members are referred to as ministers and oversee specific portfolios. Typical portfolios include finance, health and education.\n\nColonial Governments\n\nThe colony of Vancouver Island was established by Britain in 1849. Initially a colonial government, the island formed its first representative government in 1856. Representative government meant that members of a legislative assembly were elected by some residents of the island, while the governor and his council were appointed by Britain. However, in order to vote, residents had to own at least 20 acres of land. In 1856, these requirements meant that only 43 European men were able to vote in the colony\u2019s first election.\n\nIn 1858, following the Fraser River gold rush, Britain established a mainland colony called British Columbia. The two colonies shared a governor; however, the mainland was ruled by the governor alone, while the island maintained its representative government.\n\nIn 1866, Vancouver Island and British Columbia combined to form a single colony. The legislative assembly was established in Victoria, where it remains today.\n\nConfederation and Early Governments: 1871-1903\n\nBritish Columbia joined Confederation in 1871. As part of the terms of the union, Canada insisted that BC establish responsible government. Responsible government meant that the premier and their executive would be selected from the party with the most members elected to the legislative assembly. In addition, the executive needed the support of the majority of members of the assembly in order to govern.\n\nIn the years between 1871 and 1903, the political parties that are familiar today (e.g. Liberal, Conservative, New Democratic) didn\u2019t exist in BC. Instead, candidates identified themselves as in support of the premier, in support of the opposition, or as independent. In the 32 years between Confederation and the introduction of party lines, BC had 15 premiers. The province\u2019s first premier was John Foster McCreight.\n\nDid you know?\n\nIn 1917, women received the right to vote in British Columbia elections. However, there were still a number of people, male and female, who couldn\u2019t vote in BC elections for some time: Chinese and South Asian people received the right to vote in 1947, and Japanese people and Status Indians received it in 1949.Today, anyone can vote in a BC election, provided that they are 18 years of age, a Canadian citizen and have lived in BC for at least 6 months.\n\nMcBride, Bowser, Brewster, Oliver and MacLean: 1903-28\n\nPremier Richard McBride cheers after driving the last spike of the B.C. Electric Railway's Fraser Valley line to Chilliwack, BC, in 1910. (courtesy City of Vancouver Archives/LGN 952)\n\nIn 1903, Conservative Richard McBride was the first premier to win an election fought along party lines. He served as premier for 12 years. When McBride resigned in 1915, William John Bowser briefly filled the role of premier. In 1916, Bowser was defeated and the Liberal Party formed its first government, led by Harlan Carey Brewster. Two additional Liberal governments were elected following Brewster: John Oliver served as premier for nine years, from 1918 to 1927, and John Duncan MacLean held power from 1927 to 1928. The Conservatives regained power in 1928 under Simon Tolmie.\n\nTolmie, Pattullo, Hart and Johnson: 1928-52\n\nPremier Simon Fraser Tolmie addresses a crowd on Flag Day at the Vancouver Exhibition, 1929. (courtesy City of Vancouver Archives/CVA 99-1940)\n\nMany labour leaders came from Britain in the early 20th century and brought their experience as organizers with them. They gained early success in British Columbia when legislation for improved working conditions and social services was introduced. The Labour Party elected members in 1920, 1924, 1928 and 1933.\n\nProgressive and socialist parties emerged with the serious economic difficulties of the Great Depression. Simon Fraser Tolmie and his Conservative Party were nearly wiped out in the 1933 election. They finished behind the new Co-Operative Commonwealth Federation(CCF), which won seven seats and 31 per cent of the vote, and the Liberals led by Premier Thomas Dufferin Pattullo. Pattullo served as premier for the next eight years. In the following years, Premiers John Hart (1941\u201347) and Byron I. Johnson (1947\u201352), both Liberals, were called upon to lead coalition governments with the Conservative Party.\n\nW.A.C. Bennett and Barrett: 1952-72\n\nWilliam Andrew Cecil Bennett was premier of British Columbia from 1952 to 1972.\n\nIn 1952, a new party led by William Andrew Cecil Bennett broke away from the Conservative Party. The new party called itself Social Credit, after a similar party in Alberta. Social Credit won a minority government in 1952 and then governed the province, under the leadership of W.A.C. Bennett, for the next 20 years. Social Credit\u2019s reign covered a period of enormous resource development and growth in British Columbia. This was particularly true in the interior of the province, which was being better connected to the southwest coast by road-building programs and the northern extension of the British Columbia Railway to the Peace River area.\n\nThe New Democratic Party(formerly the Co-Operative Commonwealth Federation) became the official opposition in the 1960s with the virtual disappearance of the provincial Liberal and Conservative parties. In 1972, W.A.C. Bennett and the Social Credit party were defeated. The NDP formed a government for the first time, led by David Barrett. During this time period, the electorate tended to polarize in roughly equal numbers around the two parties. Social Credit advocated for free enterprise and government restraint, while the NDP advocated moderate socialism and government economic and social involvement.\n\nW.R. Bennett, Vander Zalm, Johnston and Harcourt: 1975-91\n\nIn 1991, Rita Johnson became premier of British Columbia and the first female premier in Canadian history.\n\nSocial Credit regained power in 1975, led by William Richards Bennett, son of W.A.C. Bennett. Bennett and his government were re-elected in 1979 and 1983. Social Credit was elected again in 1986, but this time under a new leader, William Vander Zalm. In 1991, Vander Zalm stepped down amid a conflict of interest scandal. Of primary concern was the fact that he had given the purchaser of his theme park, Fantasy Gardens, special access to government resources and services. When Rita Johnston succeeded him as leader of the party, she became Canada's first female premier.\n\nJohnston and her party were defeated at the polls later that year by the New Democratic Party, led by former mayor of Vancouver Michael Harcourt. That election marked the end of Social Credit\u2019s power, after the party had governed the province for 36 of the previous 39 years. The Liberals returned as a major force in British Columbia provincial politics, forming the official opposition for the first time in 40 years.\n\nGlen Clark, Miller, Dosanjh, Campbell and Christy Clark: 1996-2013\n\nChristy Clark was premier of British Columbia from 2011 to 2017.\n\nIn 1996, the New Democratic Party won their second consecutive mandate, under Glen Clark. In August 1999, the public became aware that Clark was being investigated for accepting free home renovations from businessman Dimitrios Pilarinos, in exchange for possibly helping to get Pilarinos\u2019s casino application approved. While the Supreme Court acquitted Clark in 2002, the allegations were significant enough to force his 1999 resignation. Two men served as interim leader prior to the next general election: Dan Miller (1999-2000) and Ujjal Dosanjh (2000-01).\n\nIn 2001, Liberal Gordon Campbell came to power, and was re-elected with majorities in 2005 and 2009. In 2010, suffering from low popularity linked mostly to his imposition of the harmonized sales tax (HST), Campbell stepped down as premier. He was succeeded by former deputy premier Christy Clark, who led the Liberals to a surprise majority in 2013. Although Clark didn\u2019t win her seat in the May election, she won a by-election in Westside-Kelowna in July 2013.\n\nHorgan and Eby: 2017-Present\n\nJohn Horgan, NDP premier of British Columbia.\n\nIn the May 2017 election, Christy Clark narrowly hung on to power, forming a minority government with 43 seats (one shy of a majority). The New Democratic Party won 41 and the Green Party won 3. The small riding of Courtenay-Comox, located on the east shore of Vancouver Island, played a large role in the outcome. There, the NDP candidate initially won by just nine votes, triggering a recount that meant the results of the 9 May election weren\u2019t official until 24 May. While the overall results remained the same as election night, the Liberals won more of the popular vote than the NDP by just 1,566 ballots, making it the closest result in British Columbia history.\n\nOn 29 May, the narrative took another twist when Green Party leader Andrew Weaver and NDP leader John Horgan jointly announced that the Greens would support the NDP on confidence motions. The combined total of each party\u2019s seats, 44, would create a majority in the legislature. On 29 June, the Liberals lost a confidence motion put forward by the NDP, and Lieutenant-Governor Judith Guichon asked the NDP to form a government under the leadership of Horgan.\n\nOn 21 September 2020, about seven months into the COVID-19 pandemic, Horgan abruptly ended his coalition with the Green Party and called an election. The announcement came one year before the province\u2019s fixed election date. Horgan\u2019s rationale for holding an early election was the possibility of a majority government. A majority government, he argued, would provide the province with better stability during the pandemic. A month before the election call, Horgan had the highest personal approval rating of any premier in Canada.\n\nOn 24 October 2020, British Columbia held the second general election in Canada since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (New Brunswick held an election under similar circumstances a month earlier). Voters elected a majority NDP government. Horgan became the first NDP premier in British Columbia\u2019s history to win two terms. His party won 57 seats, the Liberals 28 and the Green Party two.\n\nAbout two years later, on 28 June 2022, Horgan announced his retirement. The announcement came after Horgan had spent months in radiation treatment for throat cancer. The battle was Horgan\u2019s second with the disease, having successfully defeated bladder cancer earlier in his life. David Eby, the province\u2019s former attorney general and housing minister, and Anjali Appadurai, a climate activist, were the only two people in the race to replace Horgan. However, in October, the NDP\u2019s executive team disqualified Appadurai following a report issued by BC\u2019s chief electoral officer. The report stated that Appadurai\u2019s campaign breeched the province\u2019s Election\u2019s Act by using third party resources to sign up new NDP members. As a result of Appadurai\u2019s disqualification, Eby won the race."}, {"url": "http://dictionary.sensagent.com/john%20les/en-en/", "page_content": "John Les is a Canadian politician and member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for British Columbia.

The history of the legislative body\u2014which meets in the Palace of Westminster in London\u2014shows how it evolved almost organically, partly in response to the needs of the country\u2019s reigning monarch. Parliament traces its roots back to the earliest meetings of English barons and commoners in the 8th century.\n\nParliament\u2019s Humble Beginnings\n\nThe present-day Parliament is a bicameral (\u201ctwo chambers\u201d) legislature with a House of Lords and a House of Commons. These two houses, however, weren\u2019t always joined, and had their earliest beginnings in the Anglo-Saxon council governments of the 8th century.\n\nThe Witan was a small council of clergymen, land-owning barons and other advisors chosen by the king to discuss matters of state, taxation and other political affairs. As it expanded to include more advisors, the Witan evolved into the magnum concilium or Great Council.\n\nOn a local level, \u201cmoots\u201d were meetings of local bishops, lords, sheriffs and, importantly, commoners who were representatives of their counties or \u201cshires.\u201d\n\nThese institutions functioned\u2014with varying degrees of success\u2014as law-making bodies and law enforcement agencies throughout England during the Middle Ages. The two bodies didn\u2019t regularly convene, but they paved the way to the bicameral legislature that exists today.\n\nMagna Carta\n\nThe first English Parliament was convened in 1215, with the creation and signing of the Magna Carta, which established the rights of barons (wealthy landowners) to serve as consultants to the king on governmental matters in his Great Council.\n\nAs in the early Witans, these barons were not elected, but rather selected and appointed by the king. The Great Council was first referred to as \u201cParliament\u201d in 1236.\n\nBy 1254, the sheriffs of the various counties in England were instructed to send elected representatives of their districts (knowns as \u201cknights of the shire\u201d) to consult with the king on issues related to taxation. Four years later, at the English university town of Oxford, the noblemen who served in Parliament at the time drafted the \u201cProvisions of Oxford,\u201d which called for regular meetings of the legislative body, composed of representatives from each of the counties.\n\nIn 1295, Parliament evolved to include nobles and bishops as well as two representatives from each of the counties and towns in England and, since 1282, Wales. This became the model for the composition of all future Parliaments.\n\nRichard II Deposed\n\nOver the course of the next century, the membership of Parliament was divided into the two houses it features today, with the noblemen and bishops encompassing the House of Lords and the knights of the shire and local representatives (known as \u201cburgesses\u201d) making up the House of Commons.\n\nDuring this time, too, Parliament began to take on more authority within the English government. In 1362, for example, it passed a statute decreeing that Parliament must approve all taxation.\n\nFourteen years later, the House of Commons tried and impeached a number of the king\u2019s advisors. And, in 1399, after years of internal struggle for power between the monarchy and Parliament, the legislative body voted to depose King Richard II, enabling Henry IV to assume the throne.\n\nParliament\u2019s Power Expands\n\nDuring Henry IV\u2019s time on the throne, the role of Parliament expanded beyond the determination of taxation policy to include the \u201credress of grievances,\u201d which essentially enabled English citizens to petition the body to address complaints in their local towns and counties. By this time, citizens were given the power to vote to elect their representatives\u2014the burgesses\u2014to the House of Commons.\n\nIn 1414, Henry IV\u2019s son, Henry V, assumed the throne and became the first monarch to acknowledge that the approval and consultation of both houses of Parliament was required to make new laws. Still, all was not perfect in England\u2019s fledgling democracy.\n\nMore than 100 years later, in 1523, philosopher and writer Sir Thomas More, a Member of Parliament (M.P. for short), was the first to raise the issue of \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d for lawmakers in both houses during deliberations. A half-century hence, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I in 1576, Peter Wentworth, M.P., made an impassioned speech arguing for the same right; he was sentenced to imprisonment in the Tower of London.\n\nWentworth, a Puritan, later clashed with Elizabeth I over issues related to freedom of religion during his time as an M.P., and he was jailed for these acts as well. It was this persecution that led the Puritans to leave England for the New World in the 1600s, helping to settle the 13 colonies that eventually became the United States.\n\nEnglish Civil War\n\nFor much of the 17th century, the United Kingdom experienced a great deal of change and political turmoil. Arguably, the one constant was Parliament.\n\nFrom 1603 to 1660, the country was mired in a drawn-out civil war and, for a time, military leader Oliver Cromwell assumed power under the title Lord Protector. The ruling monarch at the time, Charles I, was executed in 1649.\n\nCromwell is best known for conquering Scotland (1649) and Ireland (1651) and bringing them, unwillingly, under the dominion of the United Kingdom. Still, those two nations had their own Parliaments, made up of Cromwell supporters.\n\nParliament continued to retain some power during this period of change. However, M.P.s who were thought to be loyal to Charles I were excluded from the legislature in 1648, creating the so-called \u201cRump Parliament.\u201d\n\nThe Monarchy Abolished\n\nIn 1649, the House of Commons took the unprecedented step of abolishing the monarchy and declaring England a commonwealth.\n\nFour years later, though, Cromwell disbanded the Rump Parliament and created the Nominated Assembly, a de facto legislature. Cromwell died in 1658 and was replaced by his son Richard. The son was deposed a year later, and Britain\u2019s government effectively collapsed.\n\nCharles I\u2019s son, Charles II, was restored to the throne in 1660, reaffirming the monarchy\u2019s place in British history.\n\nNew Parliamentary elections were held. And the M.P.s elected effectively held their seats for the next 18 years, during which no general election was called.\n\nThe Stuart Kings\n\nThe so-called \u201cStuart Kings\u201d\u2014Charles II and his brother James II, who succeeded him in 1685\u2014maintained a similar relationship with the legislature as their father had in the 1640s. However, religion was a major issue dividing English government and society.\n\nWhen Parliament passed the \u201cTest Act,\u201d which prevented Catholics from holding elected office, the legislature was at odds with King James II, himself a Catholic. After years of political in-fighting during the Glorious Revolution, Parliament deposed James II in 1689 and his eldest daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange ascended to the throne.\n\nDuring their brief rule, Parliament was once again elevated to having law-making powers. In fact, when Mary and William died (in 1694 and in 1702, respectively), the legislature established new protocols for succession, and named George of Hanover king.\n\nParliament in Recent History\n\nOver course of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, Parliament and its powers evolved\u2014just as the United Kingdom itself did.\n\nScotland formally became a part of the United Kingdom in 1707, and thus sent representatives to the Parliament at Westminster. By the late 1700s, Ireland was also part of the United Kingdom (the six counties in the north of the island\u2014known collectively as Ulster\u2014remain part of the U.K. today), and land-owners there elected their own representatives to both houses of Parliament.\n\nThrough a series of legislative acts, known as the \u201cReform Acts,\u201d a number of changes were made to the composition and legislative process in Parliament. The Reform Act of 1918 gave women the right to vote, and the first woman was elected to the body that same year.\n\nHowever, Countess Constance Markievicz of Ireland was a member of Sinn Fein, the political party seeking independence for the island nation, and thus refused to serve.\n\nMeanwhile, the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 established greater powers for the House of Commons, which has 650 elected members, compared to the House of Lords, which has 90 members appointed via peerage (a system of titles for noblemen).\n\nHouse of Lords\n\nToday, the two houses of Parliament\u2014the House of Lords and the House of Commons\u2014meet in the Palace of Westminster in London, and are the only body in the United Kingdom\u2019s constitutional monarchy government with the authority to create legislation and make laws.\n\nThe current monarch, King Charles III, still serves a ceremonial role as head of state, and the country\u2019s executive branch is headed by the Prime Minister.\n\nWhile the House of Lords can debate all bills that don\u2019t deal directly with financial matters for the country, it is the House of Commons that holds the ultimate sway when it comes to whether legislation ultimately becomes law.\n\nHowever, the House of Lords does play a role in government accountability, through its questioning of cabinet ministers and the formation of special committees to address important matters of state. Its members are now mostly appointees, not peers who inherit their seats in the House of Lords.\n\nHouse of Commons\n\nToday, all legislation must be approved by the House of Commons in order for it to become law. The House of Commons also controls taxation and the government\u2019s purse strings.\n\nThe public in the United Kingdom elects each of the 650 members of the House of Commons. And in a system somewhat different from that of the United States, government ministers (including the Prime Minister) must regularly answer questions in the House of Commons.\n\nSources\n\nThe Birth of English Parliament.
