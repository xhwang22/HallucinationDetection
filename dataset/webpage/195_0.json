Full disclaimer .\n\nHow old am I today?\n\nHow old you are can be calculated using your date of birth. By using mathematical calculation, it's possible to work out how many years, months, weeks and days have passed since you were born. If you know the time of your birth, it can be incorporated into the calculation to provide an even more precise result.\n\nHow old was I on X date?\n\nShould you want to know how old you were on a certain date in past history, or how old you will be at a future date, we've got you covered. Simply make use of our 'Age at Date' option in our calculator and enter a date in either the past or future. Our calculator will then make a calculation based upon that date.\n\nCalculating your age\n\nYour age can be calculated by finding the difference between your date of birth and the current date. What we are specifically finding out is how much time has passed since you were born. We can, of course, perform a rough calculation by subtracting the year of your birth from the current year, which will give you a figure for how many years old you are, or will be, in the current year.\n\nage (years) = current year - birth year\n\nAs an example, if I was born in 1995, my age in 2023 will be: 2023 - 1995 = 28 years.\n\nOf course, this only gives you a rough figure for how many years old you will be in the current year - it doesn't take into consideration the month and day of your birth compared to today's month and day. To calculate your exact age, including months and days, you need to deduct the numerical month and day of your birth from the current month and day.\n\nHow many days old am I?\n\nPeople regularly ask how they can work out their age, and I point them to this calculator (it's one of the reasons I created it). Although you can have a rough guess by multiplying your age in years by 365, you could still be out by up to several hundred days. This will in most part be because you'll be working on the basis of your age at your last birthday, and therefore excluding the days since.\n\nThere's also leap years to take into consideration. These occur once every four years and mean an extra day in the calendar (366 days in the year). Your best way to get an accurate calculation to how old you are in days is, therefore, to use the age calculator tool provided.\n\nHow old will I be in 2050?\n\nWorking out your age in the future is a simple process with our age calculator. Here's how to calculate how old you will be in 2050:\n\nEnter your day, month and year of birth. Set the 'age at date' to January 1 2050. Click the 'Calculate' button to find out what your age will be in 2050.\n\nHow old was the oldest person ever?\n\nThe oldest person ever recorded was Jeanne Calment, a woman from France. She was born on February 21, 1875 and lived until the age of 122 years and 164 days before passing away on August 4, 1997. 1\n\nOf the top 10 oldest people ever, all 10 are currently women. The oldest man ever is currently recorded as being Jiroemon Kimura from Japan. Plugging his date of birth into our age calculator tool reveals that he lived until the age of 116 years and 54 days. He passed away on June 12, 2013.\n\nWith that said, Fredie Blom, a South African man born on 8 May 1904, was recorded as 'unofficially' the world's oldest man ('unofficial' because he wasn't listed in the Guinness Book of World Records).

K. Anand Benevolent Trust, New Delhi, in the year 2014 in memory of Prof. Bal Kishan Anand, an internationally renowned physiologist.\n\nDr. Anand was born on September 18, 1917 in Lahore (now in Pakistan). All through his formative years, he was rated as an excellent student and won many scholarships, medals and prizes. He graduated in Medicine from King Edward Medical College, Lahore in 1940 and went on to do M.D. in three subjects \u2013 Medicine, Pathology and Physiology. Prof. Anand joined the Lady Hardinge Medical College as a Professor of Physiology at a tender age of 32 in 1949. As the first Rockefeller Foundation Fellow, he went to Yale University in 1950 and discovered the existence of a neural substrate which is responsible for regulating food intake that is now known as the Feeding Centre. In 1952, he returned to India and joined the Lady Hardings Medical College as Professor and Head, Department of Physiology. Under his leadership it became the first Medical College in the country to introduce human and mammalian experiments in Physiology in 1953. By 1955, Lady Hardings Medical College was recognized to start an M.D. course in Basic Medical Sciences and he also got the credit of establishing the first Neurophysiology Research Unit in Lady Hardings Medical College in the same year.\n\nDr. B K Anand joined the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in 1956 as its first Professor in the Department of Physiology. He demonstrated his dynamic leadership by helping to structure the MBBS course to three phases of three semesters, each followed by a year of internship that included three months of rural posting. This pattern was quickly followed throughout the country. Dr. Anand was a member of the core team which laid down the policies and curriculum for postgraduate training in AIIMS that was soon accepted by the Medical Council of India for all Medical Colleges in India. In 1969, he went on to become the Dean of AIIMS.\n\nDr Anand\u2019s tryst with science continued till the end of his long and distinguished scientific career by raising further questions related to the Neurobiology of feeding and satiety. The Neurophysiology Research Unit started by him at AIIMS continues to flourish even today. Besides understanding the neural basis of feeding and satiety, Dr. Anand and his team undertook studies to understand the role of limbic system in emotional and aggressive behaviour, the role of hypothalamus in reproduction as well as in cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal activities.\n\nIn 1955, Dr. B K Anand was instrumental in establishing the Association of Physiologist and Pharmacologists of India affiliated to the International Union of Physiological Sciences. In 1957, he also started the publication of Indian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology that is now one of the best medical journals published in India. In 1974, he worked for the World Health Organization in New Delhi. Working in Health Manpower Development Division in South East Asia, he rendered advice for policy matters relating to education, nursing and paramedical manpower in the member countries. In 1977, he joined the Family Planning Foundation as its Biomedical Doctor and he held this position till his retirement in 1982 after successfully steering research in India in Biomedical Sciences especially in the development of contraceptives.\n\nIn 1982, after retiring from the Family Planning Foundation, he took up yet another challenge of establishing a Postgraduate Medical Institute in Srinagar at the behest of the late Shri Sheikh Abdullah. During the period 1982-1985, he served as the Director of Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Science, Srinagar. Throughout his career, he guided many students, practitioners, researchers and faculty. He authored numerous research publications.\n\nDr. Anand won numerous national and international awards and accolades. Most significant among them are the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology in Medical Sciences in 1963 and Padma Shri in Medicine in 1969 from Government of India.\n\nDr.B.K.AnandAward presented every year to an outstanding person in the field of physiology, food and nutrition etc., within India.The Office-Bearers will recommend the names for consideration of the Committee Members of theDr.B.K.Anand award."}, {"url": "https://coolconversion.com/i-was-born-in/8-16-1940", "page_content": "Born in August 16, 1940\n\nAge calculator\n\nThe day of the week you were born was 228.

The age calculator calculates age given a date of birth in years, months and days. You can also use this calculator to find length of time between two dates.\n\nThe age calculator finds the age time span in years months and days, months and days, and in total days only.\n\nHow to Calculate Age\n\nThis age calculator uses 2 similar but slightly different methods to calculate age. One method is used to give age in years, months and days, and also months and days. The other method is used to very precisely calculate age in total days only.\n\nWhen calculating age to the detailed level of days it's important to remember that not all months have the same number of days. Also, while a year has 365 days, a leap year has 366 days.\n\nWhen you calculate age in terms that include years, this calculator provides the answer in common terms. For example, a teenager might say he is 15 years old rather than saying he's 12 normal years old plus 3 leap years old. This age calculator uses the same assumption -- although we know years may have different lengths, we generalize between regular years and leap years, and call them equal.\n\nThe same is true for months. If a baby is 7 months old, the parents would not say she is 4 months that are 31 days long, plus 2 months that are 30 days long, plus 1 month that is 28 days long. We typically generalize across months of different lengths, and count them all equal as general months.\n\nThe age calculator finds age in terms that are commonly used, calling all years equal and all months equal. When calculating days however, the calculator uses a function to find the precise number of days between dates.\n\nIf you wanted to know how many days you've been alive you need to account for extra days in leap years. You also need to know the total number of months with 31 days, total months with 30 days, and total months with 28 days.\n\nThe age calculator uses a function that recognizes how many leap years are in a given time span. It also calculates the specific number of days in a partial year. For example, if you were born on March 5 and today is June 7, the calculator finds the exact number of days that occur between those dates.\n\nYour age in total number of days is calculated as:\n\nNumber of years, x, with 365 days = 365x plus\n\nNumber of years, y, with 366 days = 366y plus\n\nNumber of days in the remaining partial year\n\nThis calculator assumes the start date is day 0 and begins counting one full day after day 0. For example if you input the dates 03/15/2022 and 3/18/2022 into the calculator you will get a total age of 3 days. Day 1 is the 16th, day 2 is the 17th, and day 3 is the 18th. The 15th is not counted in the tally of days.\n\nDate Formats\n\nThe age calculator allows you to input single digit months and days. You do not have to pad them with a leading zero. You must input the 4-digit year however.\n\nUS date formatting can use a forward slash, a period, or a dash:\n\nmm/dd/yyyy\n\nmm.dd.yyyy\n\nmm-dd-yyyy\n\nEuropean date formatting can use a forward slash, a period, or a dash:\n\ndd/mm/yyyy\n\ndd.mm.yyyy\n\ndd-mm-yyyy\n\nInternational date formatting according to ISO 8601 use only a dash (-):\n\nyyyy-mm-dd\n\nToday's date is based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).\n\nRelated Calculators: Date Difference, Date \u00b1 Days or Business Days Calculator."}], "B.

Until recently the main question that mattered for India\u2019s startup scene was valuation. But the mood has changed. Plunging share prices at companies that have gone public have made vc firms much warier about investing. Prizing unrealistic valuations has given way to worrying about how quickly startups might begin to make money. So far Mensa, which buys stakes in digital brands, is one of a handful of such firms that makes a profit.\n\nListen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the <audio> element.\n\nThat leaves plenty that do not. Since the beginning of 2021, the number of unicorns created in India has risen from 40 to 108. Only America and China have produced more. In 2021 promising startups had no trouble finding investors eager to fund fast-growing firms with big ideas. That year investment in startups tripled to $35bn. The momentum continued in 2022, with $3.7bn invested in March alone. Such was the clamour that startups had their pick of \u201cfounder friendly\u201d investors who were not too bothered about supervision, the drudgery of background checks and other intrusive oversight.\n\nThe environment has since cooled. Investment in December was only $900m. One reason is the woeful performance of firms that went public in 2021: Zomato (food delivery), Freshworks (enterprise software), Paytm (payments), Policy Bazaar (insurance) and Nykaa (fashion). The share prices of each has tumbled in excess of 59%. And while a global rout in tech valuations has coincided with a broader sell-off, that is not true of India. The Sensex, an index of the country\u2019s biggest 30 firms, is close to an all-time high and the economy is growing at a decent clip.\n\nThe poor performance means that other planned listings, such as that of PharmEasy, an online pharmacy, will not now go ahead. Acquisitions have been similarly hit. In October the $4.7bn purchase of BillDesk by PayU, both profitable payments companies, was cancelled. PayU\u2019s owner Prosus, a local vc firm affiliated to Naspers, a Dutch-South African company, is widely believed to have walked away because the fall in Paytm\u2019s share price created a new, and far lower, benchmark for what a payments company is worth.\n\nRe-evaluating what startups might be worth is now the foremost concern of all India\u2019s vc firms. Funding hinges on assessing reserves, costs and the time needed to become profitable. In theory, this sort of information is available for all Indian firms because they are required to file public financial statements. But the system operates poorly. Of the 40 startups that have filed results for 2022 only three are profitable, according to Tracxn, a statistical service, and based on their annual spending, only five have enough cash to survive for over six months (see charts). In response to the tougher environment, costs are being cut. Inc42, an online publication tracking startups, counts 20,500 layoffs over the past year, probably foreshadowing a much bigger wave. Edtech has been especially hard hit, with 16 companies axing over 8,000 employees, the most coming at Byju, India\u2019s most valuable startup, which is sacking 2,500 employees. A post-lockdown return to classrooms and low barriers to creating educational material online has raised doubts about the entire sector\u2019s prospects. Byju has other problems. It was accused in July of inappropriately aggressive accounting and sales policies, which it denies. Other startups have also come under fire. BharatPe (payments), Trell (social media) and Zilingo (supply-chain management) saw founders quit last year after fraud accusations. BharatPe\u2019s founder denies the allegations as does Trell; Zilingo is investigating the claims. On January 18th Amit Bhasin, a co-founder of GoMechanic, a car-repair firm, admitted to \u201cerrors in judgment as we followed growth at all costs, particularly in regard to financial reporting, which we deeply regret\u201d after it cut 70% of its workers. These tribulations have brought the role of backers into question. Were firms sufficiently monitored? Were valuations credible? Sequoia Capital, a prominent Silicon Valley firm, has invested in GoMechanic, BahratPe, Trell, Zilingo and several edtech companies. It acknowledged in April the governance issues in various holdings and vowed to provide stricter oversight but has declined to comment further. Other foreign vc firms are rethinking how they approach India, too. A more diligent approach may be required.\n\nHow companies come to market is also set to change in response to the losses from public offerings. India\u2019s stockmarket regulator made changes in September that will enable far greater scrutiny. It will force firms to provide information on the prices of private transactions that occurred before listings, as well as the key data used to derive valuations. Large investors will also be required to hold at least half of their shares through at least one accounting period to stop them selling shares during a spell of hype after an offering.\n\nThese changes may not head off the carnage to come. Anand Lunia of India Quotient, a vc firm in Bangalore, believes a quarter to half of the current unicorns will become zombie firms that will exist in name but cease to be funded or operate. His willingness to speak openly is unusual; his views are not. Yet for all the concerns about the immediate future, neither Mr Lunia nor many others who think sharp devaluations are coming are pessimistic about the long-term for startups. The economy is growing strongly and India is good at nurturing entrepreneurial software engineers whose skills increasingly apply in every industry. All of this suggests that the storm ahead will be followed by a resumption of growth, eventually.\u25a0\n\nTo stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}, {"url": "https://www.kliponar.com/professor-bal-krishan-anand/", "page_content": "Born: 18 September 1917\n\nDied: 2 April 2007\n\nHe better known as B.

And India is at the core of the impending event. In April 2023, India will overtake China as the world\u2019s most populous country.\n\nIndia will be home to 1.42 billion people, most of whom will be of working age. But would it be na\u00efve to have a linear, mostly positive, view of the opportunity, or is it time we mull over ways to channel this advantage to bring about real and perceptible change to the lives of India\u2019s teeming billions?\n\nMK Anand, MD & CEO, Times Network, articulated these critical questions as he hosted an absorbing session with celebrated economist Augusto Lopez-Claros, Executive Director of the Global Governance Forum at the Times Now Summit 2022\n\nUnleashing India\u2019s demographic potential\n\nTrue to this year\u2019s theme \u2018India: A Vibrant Democracy. Global Bright Spot\u2019, the Anand-Augusto interaction looked at ways to unleash the true potential of India\u2019s demographic advantage, while also deliberating on the mistakes that the nation must avoid.\n\nWhile demographic dividend, sustained high growth, stable political scenario and a resolute push to create infrastructure are the high points of the India story, there\u2019s a lot of catching up that India will have to do when it comes to issues like education and healthcare to name a few. More importantly, is India\u2019s population, especially the working population, equipped to take advantage of the opportunity?\n\nAnand said, \u201cWhen everything is on par, if everyone\u2019s productivity is equal, then countries with higher population are obviously stronger and bigger in terms of the market and therefore the negotiating power at the global high table. But productivity is not the same in all countries. And in the last 200-300 years that difference is stark because the technology that started in the West gave a very significant advantage.\u201d\n\nReferring to the huge gap between the per capita GDP between the developed counties and the rest of the world, Anand brought into focus the India-China example. 30 years back, the Asian giants had a per capita GDP of around USD 300. While India progressed to its current level of USD 2,100, China grew exponentially to USD 11,000 in the same period.\n\nHowever, going beyond numbers, Anand pointed out that one must factor in that India has grown while being a robust democracy, an important distinction when it comes to the China example.\n\nAnand elucidated the point further by asking Augusto how he sees this change happening in terms of the quantity of the population, and the changes in the potential and the \u2018quality\u2019 of the population. This a challenge for the country, given the regional disparities in key indicators like per capita income, skills, and population growth. How should India navigate the conundrum?\n\nWhile agreeing with the positives of the population story, Augusto leaned on his global experience to propose the idea of \u2018fiscal federalism\u2019, he said, \u201cI was actually quite surprised when I looked at the India data on income per capita across the various states. These regional differences in income per capita are quite common throughout the world. If we look at federal states like the US or the European Union , we will see these differences.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a couple of surprising things about Indian data. One is the big gap. India has a state like Kerala which has an income per capita in PPP terms of over USD 9,000 which is higher than Ukraine was before the war. And then the country has Bihar, which is again on PPP terms approximately USD 2000 and practically, accounts to one-fifth of that of Kerala.\u201d\n\nHow Did The World Do It?\n\nCiting global examples, Augusto said, \u201cIf we go back to 1990 and look at the income per capita of the three richest states and compare it with the income per capita of the three poorest states, the difference was 50 per cent. And that is comparable to what we see in the United States and in the European Union today.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, in those other parts of the world, there has been a tendency for catching up. The poorer countries' growth regions grow faster than the richer countries and eventually, there's some level of catch-up. In India, that 50 per cent by today is three times, which means the gap has widened spectacularly. Rich regions are becoming richer and poorer are staying behind in a big way and this is concerning.\u201d\n\nThe Spain Story\n\n\u201cWhen I was in my late 20s, I was the IMF Economist for Spain and at that time Spain was essentially rapidly integrating into the European economy together with Portugal they joined the European Union at the same time and they were sort of the poor cousins of Europe like Bihar of India with a huge difference in income per capita with respect to Germany the Netherlands and France,\u201d Augusto said.\n\n\u201cIf we look at the data today, Spain has caught up. In other words, it has gone in exactly the reverse direction of what's happening in India. So, how did this happen? The European Union has an explicit program for its members, we call it fiscal federalism. It basically consists of countries like Germany and the Netherlands will have an income per capita that is above the average transfer of resources through the European Union budget to the countries that have income per capita below the average and they do large investments in infrastructure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't think you can do these conversions in India unless you do something like that, where you have an explicit program of transfers through the tax system from the richer regions to the poorer regions. If you don't do that, these differences are going to accentuate and the problem with income disparities of this nature is that then soon they become a political problem, not just an economic one,\u201d Augusto asserted.\n\nIn response, Anand explained the ground realities in India, \u201cThat\u2019s precisely what I was wondering, because if you look at the political map of India from a state\u2019s points of view, that I was discussing, the richer parts have local governments which right now are only concerned about their regions. When you talk to ministers and those states, they are basically concerned about development, but it could be quite possible in the future, maybe a decade or two down the line that they come together and ask why is that resources are moving out here to there and what we are getting against that?\u201d\n\nIndia must use its demographic potential in a manner that will help speed up its growth story. While there are challenges, the opportunity is also too big to let go at this juncture in our history."}, {"url": "https://www.ey.com/en_in/people/d-k-srivastava", "page_content": "Welcome to EY.com\n\n\n\nIn addition to cookies that are strictly necessary to operate this website, we use the following types of cookies to improve your experience and our services: Functional cookies to enhance your experience (e.g. remember settings), and Performance cookies to measure the website's performance and improve your experience., and Marketing/Targeting cookies, which are set by third parties with whom we execute marketing campaigns and allow us to provide you with content relevant to you.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have detected that Do Not Track/Global Privacy Control is enabled in your browser; as a result, Marketing/Targeting cookies, which are set by third parties with whom we execute marketing campaigns and allow us to provide you with content relevant to you, are automatically disabled.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent to cookies at any time once you have entered the website through a link in the privacy policy, which you can find at the bottom of each page on the website.\n\nReview our cookie policy for more information.\n\nCustomize cookies\n\nI decline optional cookies"}, {"url": "https://wikimylinks.com/content/anand-srinivasan-wiki-biography-age-books-images-more", "page_content": "Anand Srinivasan is an Economist, Author, Investor, and Consultant from Chennai.

Twenty years ago few commentators took the financial muscle of China or India seriously. Try finding someone who shares that view now. These new economic superpowers are not the only countries giving Western finance ministers sleepless nights. Six of the nations that make up Goldman Sachs's \u201cNext 11\u201d emerging economic powers\u2014Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Korea and Vietnam\u2014are in the eastern hemisphere.\n\nThe potential impact on business education is huge. The heavy flow of applicants from Asia to schools in Europe and America has already slowed as the East's best and brightest opt to study closer to home. So is the balance of the world's intellectual power shifting?\n\nAlthough some Asian and Australasian schools have fallen in The Economist's global ranking this year, having found it harder to place graduates in top jobs, in the long term their march upwards seems inexorable. Currently there are 13 schools that feature in our global top 100 (the Asian Institute of Management falls just outside); five years ago there were just nine. In ten years' time, it may be that the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong University of Science and China Europe International Business School (CEIBS) will be challenging the best schools in North America and Europe for a position in the top ten.\n\nDemand is certainly on the rise. Score reports for the GMAT, the test used by business schools as part of the candidate-selection process, indicate that in the past five years the number of applicants from China, India, Hong Kong and Singapore sending their test scores to local schools has more than tripled. But to compete on the world stage they must also attract talent from farther afield. The signs are encouraging.\n\nAt CEIBS, based in Shanghai, the share of Western students in the full-time MBA programme has increased from 2% in 2005 to 22% in 2009. The National University of Singapore (NUS) has seen similar growth. Since 2006 there has been a threefold increase in the number of North American applicants for its MBA programmes and a more than fourfold increase in European applicants. Lim Yue Wen, the school's director of graduate studies, identifies several factors driving this demand, including the burgeoning Asian economy. \u201cWe have seen more multinational corporations setting up their regional headquarters in Asia, and in the process, the need for talent has risen accordingly \u2026 Thus, it is not surprising that students will want to be in Asia, where the action is.\u201d\n\nIndia, for many years the largest exporter of students to Western business schools, is also seeing foreign applications grow, albeit more slowly. The Indian School of Business in Hyderabad reports that though international students make up only 5% of the current MBA class, international applications have almost doubled over the past two years. In a tentative global economy, the school believes, India continues to provide better opportunities for career progression. Given that it is not easy to start a career in a new country, it makes sense for Western applicants to consider studying in the region first.\n\nIf the GMAT is any indicator of student quality, these schools can also claim to attract a bright talent pool. The average score of a student at ceibs is 696 (out of 800), on a par with London Business School. Furthermore, the appeal of Asia appears to work for both sexes. Whereas Western business schools have long struggled to encourage more women into the classroom, in many MBA programmes in South-East Asia around 40% of the students are female. Hong Kong University tops the list with 48%.\n\nAs might be expected, a growing number of Western business schools are responding by setting up their own campuses in the region. Chicago and two French schools\u2014INSEAD and ESSEC\u2014are now well established in Singapore; Western Ontario's Ivey school has made a second home in Hong Kong; Vlerick, a Belgian school, and hec Paris have entered the Beijing market; and Duke University in North Carolina is developing campuses in Shanghai and New Delhi. Such expansion provides these schools with direct access to Asian mba recruiters as well as offering students the opportunity to learn in Asia. It also appeals to faculty, by providing research and case-study opportunities in the world's most dynamic regional economy.\n\nNot there yet\n\nBut there remain areas in which the business schools of Asia and Australasia will have to improve if they are to claim a place at the top table. For one, the region still lacks a school with the brand-recognition of longer established American and European schools. Here they can draw encouragement from the experience of European business schools like Spain's ie, little-known ten years ago, but now rising to global prominence.\n\nAsian schools also lack powerful alumni networks, which offer the fund-raising potential and career opportunities that are the lifeblood of schools in America and Europe. This also takes time, but as more alumni filter into the boardrooms of London, New York and Shanghai, momentum will inevitably build.\n\nFinally, there is an inability to attract the world's leading thinkers and best teachers. To date, many Asian business schools have relied on visiting faculty to make up their numbers, but they have struggled to convert these to permanent teaching positions. As schools develop research centres and provide direct access to Asia's banks, conglomerates and family businesses, professors will take a closer look at a permanent move east. The recent arrival of Arnoud de Meyer, director of Cambridge's Judge school, at the Singapore Management University might be a sign of things to come."}], "B. K. Anand was the former Chairman and Managing Director of the State Bank of India (SBI).": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/State-Bank-of-India", "page_content": "State Bank of India (SBI), state-owned commercial bank and financial services company, nationalized by the Indian government in 1955. SBI maintains thousands of branches throughout India and offices in dozens of countries throughout the world. The bank\u2019s headquarters are in Mumbai.\n\nThe oldest commercial bank in India, SBI originated in 1806 as the Bank of Calcutta. Three years later the bank was issued a royal charter and renamed the Bank of Bengal. Along with the Bank of Bombay (founded 1840) and the Bank of Madras (founded 1843), it was one of three so-called presidency banks, each of which was jointly owned by the provincial government and private subscribers. In 1921 the presidency banks were merged to form the Imperial Bank of India (IBI), which then became the largest commercial enterprise in the country. In 1955 the government of India and the country\u2019s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (founded 1935), assumed joint ownership of IBI, which was renamed the State Bank of India. Four years later, by the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, banks earlier operated by individual princely states became subsidiaries of SBI. The Reserve Bank\u2019s share of SBI was transferred to the government in 2007. Since nationalization, SBI has served the needs of Indian economic development through rural-development initiatives and microcredit programs and by financing major agricultural and industrial projects and raising loans for the government.\n\nSBI is governed by a board of directors headed by a chairman. The chairman and managing directors of the bank are appointed by the government."}, {"url": "https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-the-state-bank-of-india-is-learning-from-crisis", "page_content": "How should a leader approach a challenge as unprecedented, volatile, and globally disruptive as the COVID-19 pandemic? As a learning experience. That\u2019s the attitude of Rajnish Kumar, chairman of the State Bank of India (SBI). The veteran banker, who joined SBI in an entry-level role four decades ago, is now tasked with leading India\u2019s largest financial institution through an uncertainty that no organization had anticipated.\n\nNonetheless, some of the digital initiatives SBI had undertaken before the crisis are helping to meet the moment. In 2017, for example, SBI launched YONO (\u201cyou only need one\u201d), a mobile app that offers services for banking, investments, and trading, as well as a platform for online shopping. And, with 24 million accounts, it\u2019s also the world\u2019s largest digital bank. The institution began to rethink the operational side as well, reconsidering what a bank should be in the digital age. That includes service virtualization and remote work\u2014plus a lot of deep reflection on India\u2019s needs in the decades to come.\n\nShare Rajnish Kumar biography Rajnish Kumar is chairman of the State Bank of India. Kumar joined SBI in 1980, serving in various positions, including director, SBI Life Insurance, and managing director, National Banking Group, before taking office as chairman, in 2017. Kumar is a graduate of Chaudhary Charan Singh University.\n\nTaking the long view, as well as embracing and reappraising digital and what it can and should be, is a challenging leap for any legacy organization, and SBI faces an especially rich stew of challenges. With more than 22,000 branches, some 448 million customers, and a market share within India of about 23 percent, the partly state-owned, partly publicly traded bank has the dual mandate of serving all Indians\u2014including those who have grown up with the notion of a bank as a brick-and-mortar institution\u2014as well as its shareholders.\n\nRecently, on a videoconference with McKinsey\u2019s Akash Lal and Joydeep Sengupta, Kumar took time to discuss his \u201cCEO moment,\u201d including how he is dealing with the crisis and reimagining SBI for the future. In addition to helping maintain the stability of India\u2019s banking system and strengthening the bank\u2019s own digital capabilities, Kumar is dealing with issues of personal leadership that will resonate with many global leaders, including how to avoid \u201clos[ing] your cool in such circumstances\u201d and living the idea that \u201cwhatever we learn through this process, it must not go to waste.\u201d\n\nThe Quarterly: How are you doing in all of . . . this?\n\nRajnish Kumar: You know, we had tested for disruptions in a simulated environment. But this\u2014this is testing in a real environment. No business or organization had anticipated that it would have to deal with the situation brought about by COVID-19. And, of course, it\u2019s not confined to one country; it\u2019s in all countries and economies. No question, we are in an unprecedented situation. I have spent almost 40 years now in the banking system. We are used to having disruptions, and there have always been localized disruptions. But nothing of this scale or effect.\n\nFortunately, we had been investing in our technology and digital capabilities and had been looking to build on that. So we have been able to keep our operations up and running, and there\u2019s been no disruption of service as far as transactions go.\n\nThe Quarterly: How has that looked behind the scenes? What kinds of operational changes have you been making?\n\nRajnish Kumar: We have a work-from-home policy, but it was not tested in a big way, so this has been a good learning period. We also have a unique practice where in cities like Mumbai or Delhi\u2014places where commuting is a major issue\u2014we have residential real estate so our people can live close to the office or to global IT centers. But, of course, during the pandemic, they can\u2019t come in. So for certain back-office or IT functions, we\u2019ve procured laptops that have secure access to our full banking office.\n\nOver the long term, this raises exciting questions. How do we create the flexibility between an office or a workplace and build the capability to work from anywhere? This could perhaps bring huge productivity gains. How can we use this [crisis] to reimagine how we work?\n\nThe Quarterly: What does it mean to reimagine SBI\u2019s operations in a post-COVID-19 world?\n\nRajnish Kumar: It starts with understanding which functions have to be done at the branch or at a physical office. We have to look at each and every office, floor by floor, each and every position, each and every role, and each and every person. Can I convert and have satellite offices? Why can\u2019t you do the job from anywhere else?\n\nAnd how do we do that without impacting efficiency or diluting any control or policy functions? Whatever our approach, it has to be absolutely secure, because of the sensitivity around the data of the bank. There cannot be even a little bit of laxity in that. The current model is that you live at a place, and you work at a place. And in that process, you may have to travel 20 kilometers, you may have to travel 40 kilometers. Or, if you are lucky, you may not have to travel much.\n\nThis concept will undergo a change, but when it does, what will be the impact on individual human behavior? Not everybody would like to work from home. It may look like a very exciting idea, but when you sit at home for one month, you may realize it is not such an exciting idea. [Laughs.] So the flexibility around workplaces, and what the compensation structure should be, have to be thought through. We\u2019re in a much better position now because our learnings are based on a real situation.\n\nThe Quarterly: What does all this mean for your customers as you look ahead?\n\nRajnish Kumar: Even before the pandemic, 90 percent of customer transactions were happening away from our physical branches\u2014and, even though [the pandemic] has proved the robustness of our platform, we still have to build on our digital capabilities to serve customers better.\n\nOf course, we have many customers, including many senior citizens, who are not tech savvy and still prefer to visit a branch; it is an outing for them to come to a branch and talk to people. We also have a segment of customers who are underprivileged\u2014and, again, not as tech savvy\u2014who depend on us. So for people who want to come to the branches, we say, \u201cLet them come!\u201d We will, of course, serve them.\n\nBut there is a growing, largely urban middle class who are very familiar with technology and very comfortable with their smartphones. And more and more, people don\u2019t want or need to travel for transactions, particularly banking transactions, but others as well\u2014investments, shopping. That\u2019s why we built out YONO.\n\nIn addition to banking transactions, YONO enables people to take loans, manage investments, and buy insurance. And there\u2019s also online shopping, which is a big attraction\u2014and a cool product. And many more functionalities are coming; we are in the process of building a B2B platform for YONO business, and development is a continuous process. We complete one thing and think, \u201cWhat more can we do for the customer?\u201d Our philosophy has been that whatever you imagine in terms of your daily needs, whatever you need to do, you should be able to do on one single platform.\n\nParticularly during the crisis, YONO has come in handy. During the lockdown, we\u2019ve had 30,000 new users a day joining our existing users, often because they can\u2019t visit their branch.\n\nThe Quarterly: Let\u2019s change gears and talk about you as a leader for a moment. How do you approach the challenge of leading a large institution through uncertainty of this scale and scope?\n\nRajnish Kumar: I firmly believe that you need to be convinced of whatever you\u2019re doing. That\u2019s the starting point. Don\u2019t do anything in a half-hearted manner. Once your personal commitment is established, it is crucial that people believe; whatever you do as a leader, you have to have credibility. If I say something and it applies to others but not me, I lose credibility. It\u2019s important to remain connected to the ground and be accessible. Personal credibility and personal commitment matter a lot at the CEO level, and also from the top-management team, whose buy-in you need. Whatever we do, we always have to be aligned with the core values of the organization. We must resist the temptation to do things in a short-term manner or align goals with our own instincts.\n\nAnd whatever we do, ultimately, it has to benefit the people affected\u2014whether they\u2019re staff members or customers. If you do something that only benefits the organization, it\u2019ll be a much harder push. The chances of success are much higher when everyone benefits.\n\nThe Quarterly: As a state-owned bank, how do you balance social responsibility with your duty to shareholders?\n\nRajnish Kumar: On the social-policy side, SBI is helping with the stability of the financial system and revival of economic growth. Action has to be coordinated between the bank, the government, and the various regulators. The quality of the government\u2019s response depends on how honestly the feedback is reaching the government from the ground. As the CEO of SBI, I\u2019m connected to the ground: what\u2019s happening in the economy, to the individuals, to businesses. Based on what we\u2019re observing, we make recommendations that help the government shape its response. If we say [to the government], \u201cLook, we see a genuine problem here,\u201d it adds more credibility. Our large size\u2014and that we\u2019re 57 percent owned by the government\u2014also adds to our credibility.\n\nRegarding our duty to shareholders, there are certain interventions in the area of social banking that we have to do as a government-owned bank. And there\u2019s a financial cost to that, which is reflected in our earnings. There\u2019s no such obligation on the private sector. So when measured purely by returns to shareholders, there is a fairly huge difference. But I always say there are certain inherent advantages to public ownership, especially public confidence around keeping their money with the bank. Ultimately, shareholders will still look at the expected return on their equity. But performance shouldn\u2019t be solely measured by the returns to shareholders. Corporations should be measured by what they\u2019re doing for society as a whole. When that happens, the true worth of organizations would be more. Then again, I may say that, but investors in the stock market\u2014they\u2019re not going to like it. [Laughs.]\n\nThe Quarterly: Looking back, do you think that we will view this crisis as a speed bump or as an inflection point?\n\nRajnish Kumar: Oh, it will be a true inflection point. The world is not going to be the same as it was pre-COVID-19. There are a lot of questions around global supply chains. There are a lot of questions about new leaders, or whether a new world order will emerge. I think that this pandemic, in terms of implications, will be as big an event as World War II. We had a period where globalization was a panacea for everything. I don\u2019t believe that thinking will remain. More self-reliance may become the norm, and the way we interact with people, the way we live our life, will shift as well.\n\nCould that conclusion change? Yes; with human nature, sometimes memory is very short. But I have my doubts that it will be business as usual. I think that big changes are inevitable after this pandemic. And whatever we learn through this process\u2014it must not go to waste."}, {"url": "https://www.sidbi.in/en/directors", "page_content": "Shri Monomoy Mukherjee is presently working as Chief General Manager in National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and holds the charge of Secretary\u2019s Department.
