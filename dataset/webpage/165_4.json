{"Geoff Griffin scored a try in the grand final.": [{"url": "https://www.espn.com/cricket/story/_/id/22248945/no-balled-game", "page_content": "The subject of questionable bowling actions has dogged cricket since its earliest days. Initially it was roundarm, and then overarm, bowling that caused much gnashing of teeth, and then, in the last century, throwing - for which there have been three peaks: the late 19th century, the late 1950s and early 1960s, and over the last few years. But few victims of the resulting bids by the establishment to clean up the game have been as sad as Geoff Griffin, the 21-year-old South African fast bowler whose career was so publicly ended in a Test match at Lord's in 1960.\n\nGriffin's inclusion in South Africa's squad to tour England was controversial in itself. The vexed subject of illegal actions was high on the agenda - Ian Meckiff, Graham Rorke and Charlie Griffith were all under the spotlight - and Griffin had been called in domestic matches the previous winter. Tall, blond and fast, he headed the national averages in his second season, with 35 wickets at 12.23 for Natal, and could not be overlooked. He also suffered from a physical defect, having been handicapped by an accident when a schoolboy, which left him unable to straighten his right arm fully.\n\nNo tourist had been called for throwing in England up to then, but in the South Africans' early matches Griffin's bowling attracted muttering among the media. Ian Peebles, who sat side-on in the game against Essex, wrote that he was much perturbed by what he saw and that \"there was something amiss\". At Lord's in May, against MCC, Griffin was no-balled for throwing (in one instance he was called for throwing and dragging) and the genie was out of the bottle. At Trent Bridge a few days later Griffin was again called.\n\nIn the light of this, most newspaper correspondents called for a tough line to be taken and expected Griffin to be left out of the Tests. That he was not, given the obvious backing umpires had received from the authorities to call Griffin, was to the shame of the South African management.\n\nThe affable Griffin retreated to the internationally famous Alf Gover Indoor School in south-west London, where a three-day coaching session appeared to have ironed out the problem. Although Gover did his best, he later admitted that the arm was unquestionably bent.\n\nGriffin played in the first Test at Edgbaston, where there were again mumblings, but the umpires did not call him. He cut down his speed, but his penetration went with it. The only time he really opened up, late on the first day, the old problems appeared to return. At Southampton a week later, he was once again no-balled. It was to general surprise that he was named in the XI for the Lord's Test.\n\nWhat followed was a match of mixed fortunes for Griffin. On the plus side, he became the first South African to take a hat-trick in a Test. But that was scant consolation for the events that ended his Test career.\n\nIn the third over of England's innings Griffin was no-balled by Frank Lee, who was standing at square leg, and after a break for rain, he was called again by Lee. Onlookers commented that while Griffin's action was suspect, there was no discernible difference between any of the deliveries. In all, Griffin was no-balled five times on the opening day.\n\nGeoff Griffin's hat-trick as reported by the Daily Mirror Daily Mirror\n\nOn the Friday (the second day) Griffin didn't bowl until the new ball was taken after lunch. He managed four deliveries before he was again no-balled in successive balls by Lee. The next delivery was fine according to Lee, but the hapless Griffin was called for dragging by Syd Buller at the bowler's end.\n\nIn between these battles with the umpires, Griffin bowled well, giving the batsmen a real going-over. In the dying overs, Mike Smith chased a wide one from Griffin and was caught behind by John Waite for 99; the first ball of Griffin's next over bowled Peter Walker, and when Fred Trueman was bowled heaving, Griffin had his hat-trick, the first in a Test at Lord's.\n\nHis euphoria was short-lived. South Africa were twice bowled out cheaply, and by 2.25pm on Monday (the fourth day) had lost by an innings. But with the Queen due to visit Lord's at tea, both sides agreed to play a 20-over exhibition match. Griffin was brought on to bowl at the Pavilion End - where Lee was standing - but this time he fell foul of Buller. Buller watched the first ball from square leg, then ambled across to point, and, satisfied with what he had seen, called Griffin's next three half-paced deliveries as no-balls. He allowed the next - overarm - delivery as fair before again calling him for throwing.\n\nJackie McGlew, South Africa's captain, consulted with Buller. \"What's going on?\" McGlew asked. \"He's obviously not throwing... he's bowling slowly. Is he going to be allowed to finish the over?\" Buller replied: \"We are playing to the Laws, which I must abide by.\" An exasperated McGlew asked how \"we can finish the over if this sort of thing goes on\", to which Buller answered: \"There's only one way and that's for him to bowl underarm.\"\n\nA disconsolate Griffin switched to underarm - and was promptly and pettily no-balled by Lee for not notifying him of his change of action. \"We didn't take the warning seriously,\" Griffin said. \"It sounded so preposterous to use an exhibition match to do the dirty on me.\" That was his final act as an international player.\n\nAccording to Griffin, after the match Don Bradman came into the South Africans' dressing room to sympathise, and told Griffin that Buller was acting under orders. Bradman claimed to have overheard Gubby Allen, the MCC president and a leading campaigner against chucking, instructing Buller to call Griffin out of the game.\n\nThe overwhelming reaction was one of sympathy for Griffin but anger that his own management had exposed him on such a public stage as a Lord's Test to what was seen as inevitable, and also that the selectors had picked him in the first place. The response from South Africa was to blame the English media for stirring up the storm. Griffin was not the only victim. Buller, who had done as asked, was controversially dumped for the rest of the series by the MCC, to the fury of the press.\n\nGeoff Griffin resorts to underarm bowling after being no-balled PA Photos\n\nPerhaps the most damming evidence came from Gover. He explained that he had remedied the problem ahead of the first Test, but that Griffin's \"consequent loss of pace at Birmingham made him ineffective\u2026 at Lord's he put all he could into his bowling and slipped out of the groove into which he had been put\".\n\nGriffin was contacted by a lawyer who offered to take the matter to court, free of charge. \"You'll win hands down and end up a wealthy young man,\" he said. But Griffin declined. \"I loved cricket too much to sully the great game further.\"\n\nTwo days after the Lord's Test came the inevitable announcement that Griffin would not bowl again on the tour \"for reasons obvious to all\" but would remain with the squad as a batsman. He made one or two useful contributions from the No. 9 spot and was widely praised for what the Cricketer described as \"the superb manner in which he has taken this misfortune\". His behaviour was always polite and measured.\n\nThere was a brief glimmer of hope when, back at Lord's during the tourists' match against Middlesex, he bowled in the nets in front of Bradman and McGlew, wearing a plastic arm split designed by a surgeon, but nothing came of it.\n\nIn 2006, shortly before he died, Griffin said: \"I was the victim of a thoroughly distasteful 'chucking' conspiracy. I was the fall guy. I attribute the blame to the South African cricket authorities and MCC, who should never have allowed things to develop as they did.\"\n\nGriffin returned home and moved from Natal to Rhodesia, but within two years - and still only 23 years old - his career ended when he was repeatedly no-balled against North-Eastern Transvaal at Salisbury.\n\nFormer Rhodesia opener Ray Gripper, who played in that match, told me: \"I must say I also thought that Geoff threw but he had got away with it for some time, and let me say he really could bowl/throw at pace. However, I became thoroughly confused in the game in question when Umpire Fletcher called Geoff for throwing.\n\n\"Geoff left the field and returned a couple of overs later wearing a long-sleeved sweater and bowled with as much pace as he had before. Fletcher once again called him and Geoff took off his sweater to show Fletcher that he was wearing a metal brace on his arm and asked how he could throw with that brace on.\n\n\"I saw it and agreed that there was no way he could bend and straighten his arm while wearing the brace, and yet he had bowled with just the same pace as he had before putting on the brace. So although I had thought Geoff's action suspect, I had no answer as to how he could bowl with the same pace whilst wearing a metal brace. Therefore the question remains as to whether he really did throw or not.\"\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nThe no-nonsense approach to \"chuckers\" continued and climaxed with the no-balling out of Test cricket of Ian Meckiff, one of the most notorious culprits, in the first Test of the 1963-64 series between Australia and South Africa.\n\nGriffin never played first-class again after being no-balled in Salisbury. His career was over at the age of 23\n\nIs there an incident from the past you would like to know more about?

For other people named Geoff Griffin or Geoffrey Griffin, see Geoffrey Griffin (disambiguation)\n\nGeoffrey Merton Griffin (12 June 1939 \u2013 16 November 2006) was a Test cricketer who toured England with the South African cricket team in 1960, appearing in two Test matches. A right-arm, fast bowler and lower order batsman, his selection for the tour was controversial, because of his suspect bowling action \u2013 some of his deliveries were judged to be thrown rather than bowled. The core of his problem was that, due to a childhood accident, he was unable to fully straighten his right arm.\n\nDuring the 1960 tour he was no-balled for throwing in several matches prior to the Test series, but retained his place in the side nevertheless. In his second Test appearance, at Lord's in June 1960, he became the first South African cricketer to take a hat-trick in a Test match, and also the first cricketer of any nationality to do this at Lord's. In the same match, however, he was no-balled for throwing eleven times, and again in an exhibition match that followed the match's early conclusion. These events ended his international career, and after fruitless attempts to resolve his problem, he retired from cricket in 1963, at the age of 23.\n\nGriffin was unfortunate to emerge on the international scene at a time when cricketing authorities were particularly concerned about the growing proliferation of bowlers with dubious actions and were determined to eradicate it. He, along with others, was convinced that he had been made a scapegoat to ensure that certain bowlers would be omitted from the Australian side due to tour England in 1961. After 1960 the throwing controversy largely subsided as an issue in international cricket.\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 5 Views: 467 23 795 1 183 11 691 3 255\n\nGT Football 2021: Defensive Lineman Ja'Quon Griffin\n\nSpringbok 65 - South Africa's tour of England | Cricket History\n\n#NSD18 - Quon Griffin\n\nGeoff Cameron says USMNT would be in World Cup if Jurgen Klinsmann were still manager | ESPN FC\n\nSacramento Kings Pre-Draft Workout - Geoff Petrie Transcription\n\nLife\n\nEarly life and cricket career\n\nGriffin was born in Graytown, Natal, on 12 June 1939. He received his education at Durban High School, where he excelled at many sports: cricket, athletics (he held provincial titles for high jump, triple jump and pole vault), and Rugby football (in which he played for the provincial under-19 XV). After leaving school he made his debut for Natal's Cricket XI in the 1957\u201358 season, and played regularly in 1958\u201359. In 1959\u201360 he returned bowling figures for the season of 35 wickets for an average of 12.23, heading the national bowling averages. His figures included 7 wickets for 11 runs in the extraordinary Currie Cup match at East London on 19\u201321 December 1959, in which Natal dismissed Border for 16 and 18. These performances were significant, because a Test tour of England was scheduled for 1960, and South Africa were looking for a partner for their star fast bowler Neil Adcock. Griffin was duly selected, at 20 the team's youngest player.\n\nThese early successes with Natal were, however, marked with a degree of controversy about Griffin's bowling action. As the result of an accident when a schoolboy, he could not fully straighten his right (bowling) arm; he experienced problems with his action while at school, and was twice no-balled for throwing during the 1958\u201359 season while bowling for Natal, although he escaped censure in the 1959\u201360 season. According to Griffin's Wisden obituarist many years later, his bent arm \"allied to an open-chested action, with front foot splayed towards gully, made him look more like a baseball pitcher than a conventional bowler\". John Waite, Griffin's future Test colleague, batting for Transvaal against Natal in 1958\u201359, says he informed the umpire that Griffin was throwing. The umpire replied: \"You concentrate on batting, and leave the umpiring to me.\"\n\nIt was Griffin's misfortune that his emergence as a possible Test bowler occurred at a time when the matter of illegal bowling was an issue of considerable and rising concern among cricket's international authorities. Incidents in a recent England tour to Australia had brought the issue to the fore; South Africa were, therefore taking some risk in selecting Griffin.\n\nThrowing controversy: background\n\nThe Laws of Cricket, in their various formulations, had always specified that the ball delivered to the batsman must be bowled, not thrown \u2013 that is, the bowler's arm must be straight at the point of delivery. This rule had, from time to time, created problems in the game. Around the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the Australian umpire Jim Phillips no-balled the Australian fast bowler Ernie Jones for throwing; the same umpire ended the career of England's star bowler Arthur Mold by declaring his bowling action illegal. Fifty years later, during South Africa's 1951 tour of England, the umpire Frank Chester wanted to no-ball the South African quick bowler Cuan McCarthy, but was told by the Lord's authorities to desist: \"These people are our guests\". England's Tony Lock was called for throwing during a Test Match in the West Indies, in 1953\u201354 (he subsequently remodelled his bowling action). The issue arose again during England's 1958\u201359 Australian tour, which was dominated by the suspect actions of four Australian bowlers: Ian Meckiff, Gordon Rorke, Keith Slater and Jim Burke; Jack Fingleton, the former Australian batsman, provocatively entitled his account of the series Four Chukkas to Australia. Neither England's captain, Peter May, nor the tour manager, Freddie Brown, raised the issue publicly during the series, but did so afterwards, causing considerable concern to the leading administrators on each side, Gubby Allen and Sir Donald Bradman. The principal issue in these administrators' minds was what would happen if these bowlers were brought to England in 1961, when the Australians were due to visit. They decided that the matter had to be resolved before then, and accordingly they resolved to adopt what they termed a \"zero tolerance\" policy during the intervening period, especially with regard to the forthcoming 1960 tour to England by South Africa.\n\nSouth African tour of England, 1960\n\nEarly matches\n\nGriffin's first match of the 1960 tour was against Derbyshire, on 7\u201310 May. During this game the umpire Paul Gibb called the Derbyshire fast bowler Harold Rhodes six times for throwing, but Griffin remained unmolested. He took three wickets in his side's easy victory. In his next county game, against Essex, on 14\u201317 May, Griffin again escaped attention from the umpires, but members of the media, including the writer and former Test bowler Ian Peebles, wrote that \"there was something amiss\". The following week, in the match against the MCC at Lord's on 21\u201324 May, Griffin was called for throwing by both umpires, John Langridge and Frank Lee, the first member of any touring side to be thus called. When, a few days later, he was called again in the match against Nottinghamshire, it was clear that some action needed to be taken.\n\nThe immediate step was to send Griffin to the indoor cricket school run by the former England bowler Alf Gover, in Wandsworth. This treatment seemed to help, but at the same time to reduce Griffin's effectiveness. He returned to the side, and was duly selected to play in the First Test, at Birmingham, on 9\u201314 June. Langridge was one of the umpires, but the match passed without official incident, Griffin taking two wickets in each of England's innings in a game comprehensively lost by the tourists. However, a week later in Southampton, in the match against Hampshire, Griffin was called again, so his inclusion in the South African side for the Second Test at Lord's, on 23\u201327 June, was something of a risk.\n\nLord's Test, 23\u201327 June, and after\n\nAt Lord's, England batted first and scored 362. The match provided mixed fortunes for the beleaguered bowler. In the third over of the innings, Griffin was no-balled by umpire Frank Lee, and ten further times by the same umpire, before the innings closed in sensational fashion. In three successive balls, Griffin had Mike Smith caught behind for 99, Peter Walker bowled for 52, and Fred Trueman bowled for 0, to record the first-ever hat-trick in a Test at Lords. South Africa were then twice bowled out cheaply, the match ending with their defeat early on the afternoon of Monday 26 June. Because a visit from the Queen was scheduled for later that afternoon, to fill the available time the teams agreed to play an exhibition match of 20 overs per side.\n\nIn the exhibition match, despite its informal nature, the umpires Lee and Syd Buller chose to apply the Laws of cricket strictly. Bowling at half-pace from a shortened run, Griffin was no-balled by Buller for throwing on four occasions. When the South African captain, Jackie McGlew, remonstrated, Buller replied: \"We are playing to the Laws, which I must abide by\". Griffin was allowed to finish the over by bowling underarm, but was then pedantically no-balled again by Lee, standing at square leg, for failing to notify him of the change of action. These events provoked both great sympathy for the player and contempt for the authorities. The South African writer Louis Duffus challenged Buller's intransigency concerning the Laws; the exhibition match, he said, was being played outside the \"strict tenets of play\", because of the arrangement that every player was required to bowl. McGlew later wrote: \"My own feeling at that moment was that cricket, its laws and their application, had been reduced to complete and utter farce.\" There was general anger that the South African management had exposed Griffin to the Lord's Test, given the high likelihood of an incident; the management's response was to blame the press for stirring up the trouble.\n\nSubsequent matches\n\nThe events at Lord's finished Griffin as a bowler on the tour. He remained with the team, and played in a number of subsequent matches as a specialist batsman, generally in the lower order, but on a couple of occasions as an opener. He made a few useful scores, including 65 not out against Lancashire in his next match after the Lord's Test, and 37 in the final match of the tour, against T.N. Pearce's XI at the Scarborough Festival in September.\n\nGriffin was praised in The Cricketer magazine for \"the superb manner in which he has taken [his] misfortune\". A final attempt to analyse and perhaps correct his bowling action was made in the nets at Lord's, during the tourists' match against Middlesex in mid-July. In front of Bradman and McGlew, he bowled wearing a specially-designed surgical brace on his arm, but the experiment came to nothing.\n\nLate career, retirement, later life\n\nAfter the tour, Griffin was approached by a lawyer who offered to bring the issue to court, assuring the bowler that he would win if he brought a case against the authorities, but Griffin declined, not wishing, he said, \"to sully the great game further\". He returned to South Africa, and attempted to revive his cricket career there. He moved from Natal to Rhodesia, and played a few times for his new state, but this ended after he was repeatedly no-balled in a match at Salisbury, against North-Eastern Transvaal, in 1962\u201363. At the age of 23 he retired from first-class cricket. He continued his involvement with the game at club level and as a coach, while pursuing a new career in hotel management.\n\nGriffin died on 16 November 2006 at the age of 67, after collapsing while attending a dinner held at his old school, Durban High. In all first-class cricket he played 42 matches, taking 108 wickets for 2324 runs, averaging 21.51. With the bat he scored 895 runs, av. 17.90, with a highest score of 73. He held 19 catches. In his two Tests he took 8 wickets, averaging 24.00, and scored 25 runs, av. 6.25.\n\nAftermath\n\nNot everyone was convinced that Griffin threw rather than bowled the ball. The former England batsman Denis Compton wrote: \"I am sure the umpires have been too severe on this boy. Certainly he has a bent elbow, but he cannot straighten it because of physical disability. I have seen bowlers with far more suspect actions get away with it. And I will say definitely that Griffin does not throw\". Against this, the South African commentator Charles Fortune was convinced that Griffin threw, as were his team-mates Waite and Adcock. Fortune questioned the wisdom of the selectors in sending Griffin to England: \"they chanced their arm\", he wrote. The England batsman Peter Walker, who played at Lord's, was unequivocal: \"There was absolutely no doubt in either Mike [Smith]'s or my mind that he threw virtually every ball\".\n\nSome believed that Griffin had been deliberately scapegoated, as part of a conspiracy to ensure that Australia's suspect bowlers were excluded from the forthcoming 1961 tour of England. In support of the conspiracy theory the journalist Martin Chandler, in his analysis of the throwing controversy, writes that umpire Lee may have been instructed by Allen, during a rain break in England's innings in the Lord's Test, to take a firmer line against Griffin, who had largely escaped attention in the match at that point in time, but was afterwards called on six occasions in rapid succession. According to Griffin's later account, after the match Bradman came to the tourists' dressing room to offer sympathy, and claimed that Allen had ordered Buller to \"call Griffin out of the game\". Griffin asserted: \"I was the victim of a thoroughly distasteful 'chucking' conspiracy. I was the fall guy. I attribute the blame to the SA cricket authorities and the MCC who should never have allowed things to develop as they did\".\n\nIn the event, none of Australia's suspect quartet was selected for the 1961 tour. Burke retired from Test cricket after the 1958\u201359 series; Slater did not add to the one cap he gained during that series, and Rorke's international career had ended by December 1959. Meckiff played on until December 1963, when he was no-balled four times by the umpire Colin Egar during the first Test of a series against South Africa. He then retired from all forms of the game. In cricket generally, the throwing controversy rumbled on in low-key fashion, but did not re-emerge in Tests until 1995, when the Sri Lankan bowler Muttiah Muralitharan was no-balled for throwing seven times in Melbourne. Analysis through modern technology, however, demonstrated that every bowler, on delivery of the ball, flexed his arm to some extent, and the Laws were changed to reflect this; a 15-degree elbow bend was thenceforth permitted. Had this rule been applied in Griffin's day, it might have saved him.\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n\nGeneral\n\nMatch cards"}, {"url": "http://www.leaguefreak.com/the-1997-nrl-grand-final-winners-the-newcastle-knights-53801/", "page_content": "The 1997 NRL Grand Final Winners: The Newcastle Knights\n\nIn 1997 Rugby League in Australia had been split in two.

Geoff Griffin maintained to the end of his days that he was the victim of a thoroughly distasteful chucking conspiracy. Like that of McCarthy Griffin\u2019s cricket career did not last very long, and again in common with his predecessor he was undoubtedly treated badly. There was however one big difference between the two, in that unlike McCarthy Griffin almost certainly did throw.\n\nWhy should there have been a conspiracy is the first question that needs to be looked at. The flippant response to that is to point to conspiracy theories emerging in most situations of great controversy, but to be fair to Griffin when the ground opened up before him the game, in England at least, needed a scapegoat.\n\nA 19 year old Griffin had made his First Class debut in the 1957/58 season without tearing up any trees. His second campaign was much better and, at the same time, Peter May\u2019s England were touring Australia. Having started the season as favourites to retain The Ashes England had been soundly beaten, and blamed the defeat on the quartet who inspired Jack Fingleton to title his book on the series Four Chukkas to Australia. The alleged offenders were Ian Meckiff, Gordon Rorke, Keith Slater and Jim Burke.\n\nThe next Ashes series was due to be played in England in 1961, and the authorities did not want Australia bringing with them a group of illegal bowlers thus, so Griffin\u2019s argument would go, they resolved to adopt a zero tolerance attitude against South Africa in 1960. The reasoning was that by making it clear to Australia that, unlike on their own soil, offenders would be ruthlessly exposed, the selectors would be dissuaded from picking those with suspect actions. At this time the four mentioned in the preceding paragraph were by no means the only offenders in the Australian game.\n\nReturning to the 1958/59 South African domestic season it should not be forgotten that during that season Griffin was called for throwing twice by his own umpires. Des Fell called him in the match between Natal and Transvaal, and a couple of weeks later in an end of season trial Arthur Kidson called him as well.\n\nAnother Kidson, Hayward, as far as I can see unrelated to Arthur, was a South African umpire who went on to be one of that nation\u2019s very best and who later wrote an autobiography. Prior to the selection of the 1960 touring party Hayward Kidson had never stood in a game in which Griffin played. But in making that point he did add a telling observation; Bearing in mind the lack of a suitable definition, I would most likely have gone along with the majority of umpires in this country and done nothing anyway. Men more senior than I had passed him, but there were warnings which the South African Board should perhaps not have ignored.\n\nThe side to tour England was to be selected at the end of the 1959/60 domestic season and if the Board were in any way reluctant to select him Griffin spent the summer piling on the pressure. He ended the campaign with the remarkable tally of 35 wickets at 12.22, including 7-11 in the second innings of a bizarre match in which Border were dismissed for 16 and 18. The Board could not ignore form like that, so Griffin was picked. It should also be borne in mind that throughout that momentous season no umpire called him. He didn\u2019t encounter Arthur Kidson, but Fell was not troubled by Griffin\u2019s action in the 41 overs he bowled in a match against Rhodesia.\n\nLike a number of bowlers, Muttiah Muralitharan the foremost of them, Griffin did start out with a \u201cproblem\u201d, in that as a result of a bad break to his right arm in a childhood accident he could not straighten his elbow fully. Thus any square leg umpire would see a bent arm throughout his delivery. There was another factor with Griffin that exacerbated his difficulties. He had the classic open chested action of the thrower, with a front foot splayed outwards at the point of delivery.\n\nGriffin was left out of the side for the tour\u2019s opening First Class fixture against Worcestershire. There was some speculation that the identity of the umpires dictated that decision. One was a known hardliner, Syd Buller, and the other, Jack Crapp, had recently called Worcestershire\u2019s John Aldridge. To add fuel to that particular theory Aldridge was rested by the home side.\n\nThe South Africans next outing was against Derbyshire. Paul Gibb was not afraid to call a throw a throw but Griffin couldn\u2019t be hidden forever so he played. There were six calls from Gibb at square leg, but none of them directed at Griffin who seemed to satisfy most of the travelling press pack that his action was fair. The man called on this occasion, wholly unjustly in this writer\u2019s opinion, was Derbyshire\u2019s Harold Rhodes.\n\nThe next appearance against a county for Griffin was the game against Essex. This time the press did get on his case although the umpires did not. One newspaper, The People, was particularly trenchant in its criticism of Griffin\u2019s \u201cjerk\u201d. The only problem with that argument however was that on an experimental basis the word jerk had been removed from what was then Law 26 for the 1960 season.\n\nNearly all cricketers reminisce fondly about their first appearance at Lord\u2019s, although it was not to prove a happy hunting ground for Geoff Griffin after he was selected to play against the MCC in late May. The day was cold and damp and the start of play, before a disappointing crowd, was considerably delayed. Skipper Jackie McGlew won the toss and invited the home side to bat. There were four uneventful overs from Griffin. His fifth began with a call from John Langridge for dragging, and then half way through the over Frank Lee crossed to point. He immediately called Griffin. It was the first time a visiting cricketer had ever been called for throwing in England. McGlew immediately took his man out of the attack.\n\nShortly before tea Griffin was reintroduced to the attack from the other end. He then guaranteed his place at the forefront of the next day\u2019s Sunday Newspapers by being called by both umpires for the same delivery, by Lee for dragging and John Langridge for throwing. Langridge must have seen something different, because he had allowed Griffin to bowl unhindered in the game against Essex. Langridge called him again later in the game. One of the complaints that Griffin had, supported by many irrespective of their views on his basic action, was that all his deliveries were identical. Thus it should have been a case of all or nothing. Either everything he bowled was a no ball, or all were legal deliveries.\n\nThere was a meeting after the MCC match attended by South African manager Dudley Nourse, the umpires and MCC representatives. Nourse made a statement afterwards to the effect that he was entirely happy with the outcome of the meeting and that he believed that from then on English umpires would not have any further difficulty with Griffin. The press were critical and accused the MCC of condoning throwing. It may be that adverse reaction influenced what happened next, but Nourse\u2019s view proved to be well wide of the mark. Griffin was left out of the next game at Northampton, but was selected to play against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. He was called five times for throwing in the first innings, and three times in the second innings.\n\nIt was clear that by the end of the game Griffin, still not yet 21 and the baby of the South African team had, unsurprisingly, lost his direction and much of his pace. One thing he had however done, on McGlew\u2019s instructions, was bowled his fastest delivery immediately after being called. For many with dubious actions it is their quicker ball that offends. As all of Griffin\u2019s fastest got past the umpires that is something else that distinguishes his case from those of others who, at first glance, might appear similar.\n\nVery sensibly in the circumstances Griffin was packed off to Alf Gover\u2019s indoor school for help in sorting out his action. Gover thought the basic action was fine, and sought to modify it in such a way that at the point of delivery Griffin was in a position where he couldn\u2019t throw. He was back to join his teammates for the game against Glamorgan in which he bowled 18 overs without falling foul of the umpires. South African journalist Charles Fortune described his action as distinctly smoother.\n\nThe first Test followed the Glamorgan encounter and, in a 100 run defeat, Griffin took four wickets altogether and once more avoided censure. Langridge was one of the umpires on duty so, presumably, he too saw a difference. The second Test was, as usual, to be played at Lord\u2019s. In the meantime there were two more county games, against Somerset at Taunton and Hampshire at Southampton.\n\nThere was no Griffin at Taunton, but he did play at Southampton and, if he thought his troubles were over he was to be sorely disappointed. He was called once each by Jim Parks Snr and Harry Elliott in the first innings, and three times by Parks in the second innings as well as once more by Elliott. He had now been called by six different umpires and the South Africans had a difficult decision to make about whether he should be selected for the Lord\u2019s Test. The battle of wills was primarily between Nourse and Gubby Allen, the man who wanted to use Griffin as a stick with which to beat the Australian selectors.\n\nThe simple truth was that without Griffin there was no adequate foil for the South African spearhead Neil Adcock. So Griffin played at Lord\u2019s and South Africa bowled first. Griffin\u2019s first over was uneventful, and in the second he claimed the prized scalp of Colin Cowdrey. Just as he must have started to feel better about himself he then heard Lee call him twice from square leg in his third over. Never before had a bowler been called for throwing in a Test in England. At the close of a truncated day\u2019s play England were 114-2, and Griffin had been called five times altogether.\n\nPlay began on time next morning and England moved serenely on to 210-3 by lunch, losing only Kenny Barrington to Trevor Goddard\u2019s miserly left arm medium pace. Griffin did his share of bowling, and was not called at all, umpire Lee seeming to take less and less interest in him as the session wore on. His interest did however rise considerably after lunch when the new ball was taken and there were two more calls in Griffin\u2019s very first over with it.\n\nThis is another basis for the conspiracy theory. As ever there was nothing different about the way that Griffin bowled after lunch, other than having a new cherry in his hand, but there was a very substantial change in the way that Lee went about his duties. It is difficult to dismiss the idea that Allen had had words with him during the interval. There was a rain break during the afternoon session, and after it Lee called Griffin twice more. By 6.15 pm in the final session Griffin had been called six times in all by Lee for throwing and once by Buller for dragging. He had not taken a wicket all day and when, with England cruising as 347-5, Mike Smith on 99 edged the last ball of an over into the gloves of \u2018keeper John Waite most of the crowd did not know whether to feel sympathy for Smith or delight that the young bowler had finally got something to take from the game.\n\nThere was however much more for Griffin. With the first delivery of his next over he got through Peter Walker\u2019s defences and just clipped the bails. The new batsman was Fred Trueman and his reaction to the hat trick delivery was to take a mighty swing at it and lose his leg stump. It was the first ever Test hat trick at Lord\u2019s and the first by a South African anywhere. The crowd rose to applaud a young man they were growing to like. England reached the close at 362-8 and at that point Cowdrey declared. There was little play on the Saturday, which saw South Africa move to 34-1 in reply, but they then collapsed twice on the fourth day to lose by an innings before mid-afternoon. This committed the two sides to playing an exhibition match as a royal visit was due later so there had to be some cricket in play. The game involved no more than 20 overs per side and two overs per bowler, so it was a game that\u2019s only purpose was to entertain the crowd.\n\nEngland batted first and Griffin took the second over. For the first time on the tour Buller was at square leg for Griffin. The youngster ran in off five yards to deliver the first of his dozen deliveries. For the second Buller crossed to point and then back again to square leg for the third. He called that as well as the next two despite Griffin having cut his \u201crun up\u201d down to a couple of paces and the delivery itself to a gentle loosener. There was a discussion between McGlew and Buller as a result of which McGlew instructed Griffin, following an indication from Buller that it would be the only way he could complete the over, to bowl underarm. Even then Lee chose to no ball the first such delivery on the basis that Griffin, unsurprisingly, had forgotten to inform the batsman he would be changing his mode of delivery. With commendable restraint McGlew wrote later; My own feeling at that moment was that cricket, its laws and their application, had been reduced to complete and utter farce. Former England and Middlesex leg spinner turned writer Ian Peebles, who published an interesting book on the throwing controversy a few years later, said of the episode, this was the saddest moment I have ever experienced in cricket.\n\nFollowing that particular debacle there was to be no more bowling for Griffin on the tour. He played occasionally as a batsman, and indeed in his first game in that role he scored an unbeaten 65 against Lancashire, but that effort apart there were not too many more runs for him.\n\nThe tour was just about the end of Griffin\u2019s career, but not quite. An International Cavaliers XI arrived in South Africa for a month long tour a few days after the tourists got back. Griffin played twice against them, first for Natal and then for an invitation eleven. After the controversy in England Griffin was a big draw and the umpires, who included Fell, were firmly requested not call him. Howard Kidson stood in the second match and was content to follow orders. What would he have done if there were no such instructions? The answer to that one is as clear as mud. He first wrote I still had no clear definition of a throw although I knew a throw when I saw it, before adding cryptically, with Griffin I was left with a lingering impression that I had been observing something that certainly looked* like a throw.\n\nOne of the Cavaliers on that trip was Trueman who, interestingly, commented; On a dead wicket which wasn\u2019t helping anyone Griffin let one go faster than anything I\u2019ve ever bowled \u2013 it ripped the thumb clean off Norm O\u2019Neill\u2019s brand new batting glove. After the Cavaliers games Griffin moved to Rhodesia were he played a few matches over the next couple of seasons, but he stepped off a First Class cricket ground for the last time at the age of just 23 after being no balled seven times. He only bowled nine overs in what was a sad end to an unfulfilled career.\n\nSo did Griffin throw? In 1960 Richie Benaud wrote; He has a very strong wrist flick in the last moment of delivery but this is quite permissible under the new interpretation of law 26, Benaud was in a tricky position as a man who might have found himself skippering Meckiff, Rorke and Slater the following summer, and he made similar comments about Charlie Griffith before later doing a volte face with him.\n\nDenis Compton wrote; I am sure the umpires have been too severe on this boy. Certainly he has a bent elbow, but he cannot straighten it because of physical disability. I have seen bowlers with far more suspect actions get away with it. And I will say definitely that Griffin does not throw. On the other hand Fortune believed that Griffin threw as, more tellingly, did Adcock and Waite. But for all that no one ever suggested that there was any malice in Griffin. For a fast bowler he was certainly a man with an equable temperament. His reaction to his hat trick was not significantly different to the outwardly phlegmatic response to being called. Trueman summed him up by saying; I would like to say what a really good sport Griffin has been about the whole throwing business. Geoff is a very nice lad, I think we were all sorry for him on that tour.\n\nFurther evidence to support Griffin\u2019s theory came the following year when none of the controversial Australian bowlers were chosen, despite all of them putting forward a decent case for selection in the previous domestic season. It may well be that Geoff Griffin\u2019s action did infringe the laws of the game, but that doesn\u2019t alter the fact that the treatment that he received at the hands of English umpires was truly appalling. His ordeal should never have been played out in the public eye in the manner that it was and the whole episode is one from which only Griffin himself emerges with any credit.\n\nBy the mid 1960s, when he might have been leading South Africa\u2019s attack with Peter Pollock and Mike Procter, Geoff Griffin was building an alternative career for himself as a hotelier in Rhodesia and was lost to the game of cricket. In due course he moved back to Natal where, at the age of 67, he died from a heart attack in 2006.\n\n*the emphasis is Kidson\u2019s, not that of the writer."}, {"url": "https://7news.com.au/sport/rugby-league/cameron-smith-scores-bizarre-try-to-break-nrl-grand-final-record-c-1455163", "page_content": "Melbourne Storm legend Cameron Smith has scored the first grand final try of his illustrious career in what could mark his final NRL game.\n\nSmith and Melbourne dominated the opening 40 minutes against Penrith - and the Storm skipper broke a grand final record by scoring with the final play of the first half.\n\nWatch the try in the video above\n\nWatch the latest sport on Channel 7 or stream for free on 7plus >>\n\nThe 37-year-old scored after Panthers hooker Apisai Koroisau knocked the ball out of his hands just metres from the line and Smith regathered before diving over.\n\nSmith has now scored the most grand final points in history (42) after adding 14 to his name in the first half, with Melbourne leading 22-0 at the break.\n\n\u201cJust another record for Cameron Smith.

Many felt that his selection was a mistake in the first place \u2022 PA Photos\n\nThe subject of questionable bowling actions has dogged cricket since its earliest days. Initially it was roundarm, and then overarm, bowling that caused much gnashing of teeth, and then, in the last century, throwing - for which there have been three peaks: the late 19th century, the late 1950s and early 1960s, and over the last few years. But few victims of the resulting bids by the establishment to clean up the game have been as sad as Geoff Griffin , the 21-year-old South African fast bowler whose career was so publicly ended in a Test match at Lord's in 1960.\n\nGriffin's inclusion in South Africa's squad to tour England was controversial in itself. The vexed subject of illegal actions was high on the agenda - Ian Meckiff, Graham Rorke and Charlie Griffith were all under the spotlight - and Griffin had been called in domestic matches the previous winter. Tall, blond and fast, he headed the national averages in his second season, with 35 wickets at 12.23 for Natal, and could not be overlooked. He also suffered from a physical defect, having been handicapped by an accident when a schoolboy, which left him unable to straighten his right arm fully.\n\nNo tourist had been called for throwing in England up to then, but in the South Africans' early matches Griffin's bowling attracted muttering among the media. Ian Peebles, who sat side-on in the game against Essex, wrote that he was much perturbed by what he saw and that \"there was something amiss\". At Lord's in May, against MCC, Griffin was no-balled for throwing (in one instance he was called for throwing and dragging) and the genie was out of the bottle. At Trent Bridge a few days later Griffin was again called.\n\nIn the light of this, most newspaper correspondents called for a tough line to be taken and expected Griffin to be left out of the Tests. That he was not, given the obvious backing umpires had received from the authorities to call Griffin, was to the shame of the South African management.\n\nThe affable Griffin retreated to the internationally famous Alf Gover Indoor School in south-west London, where a three-day coaching session appeared to have ironed out the problem. Although Gover did his best, he later admitted that the arm was unquestionably bent.\n\nGriffin played in the first Test at Edgbaston, where there were again mumblings, but the umpires did not call him. He cut down his speed, but his penetration went with it. The only time he really opened up, late on the first day, the old problems appeared to return. At Southampton a week later, he was once again no-balled. It was to general surprise that he was named in the XI for the Lord's Test.\n\nWhat followed was a match of mixed fortunes for Griffin. On the plus side, he became the first South African to take a hat-trick in a Test. But that was scant consolation for the events that ended his Test career.\n\nIn the third over of England's innings Griffin was no-balled by Frank Lee, who was standing at square leg, and after a break for rain, he was called again by Lee. Onlookers commented that while Griffin's action was suspect, there was no discernible difference between any of the deliveries. In all, Griffin was no-balled five times on the opening day.\n\nNo mistaking the view of the Daily Mirror after Griffin's hat-trick at Lord's \u2022 Daily Mirror\n\nOn the Friday (the second day) Griffin didn't bowl until the new ball was taken after lunch. He managed four deliveries before he was again no-balled in successive balls by Lee. The next delivery was fine according to Lee, but the hapless Griffin was called for dragging by Syd Buller at the bowler's end.\n\nIn between these battles with the umpires, Griffin bowled well, giving the batsmen a real going-over. In the dying overs, Mike Smith chased a wide one from Griffin and was caught behind by John Waite for 99; the first ball of Griffin's next over bowled Peter Walker, and when Fred Trueman was bowled heaving, Griffin had his hat-trick, the first in a Test at Lord's.\n\nHis euphoria was short-lived. South Africa were twice bowled out cheaply, and by 2.25pm on Monday (the fourth day) had lost by an innings. But with the Queen due to visit Lord's at tea, both sides agreed to play a 20-over exhibition match. Griffin was brought on to bowl at the Pavilion End - where Lee was standing - but this time he fell foul of Buller. Buller watched the first ball from square leg, then ambled across to point, and, satisfied with what he had seen, called Griffin's next three half-paced deliveries as no-balls. He allowed the next - overarm - delivery as fair before again calling him for throwing.\n\nJackie McGlew, South Africa's captain, consulted with Buller. \"What's going on?\" McGlew asked. \"He's obviously not throwing... he's bowling slowly. Is he going to be allowed to finish the over?\" Buller replied: \"We are playing to the Laws, which I must abide by.\" An exasperated McGlew asked how \"we can finish the over if this sort of thing goes on\", to which Buller answered: \"There's only one way and that's for him to bowl underarm.\"\n\nA disconsolate Griffin switched to underarm - and was promptly and pettily no-balled by Lee for not notifying him of his change of action. \"We didn't take the warning seriously,\" Griffin said. \"It sounded so preposterous to use an exhibition match to do the dirty on me.\" That was his final act as an international player.\n\nAccording to Griffin, after the match Don Bradman came into the South Africans' dressing room to sympathise, and told Griffin that Buller was acting under orders. Bradman claimed to have overheard Gubby Allen, the MCC president and a leading campaigner against chucking, instructing Buller to call Griffin out of the game.\n\nThe overwhelming reaction was one of sympathy for Griffin but anger that his own management had exposed him on such a public stage as a Lord's Test to what was seen as inevitable, and also that the selectors had picked him in the first place. The response from South Africa was to blame the English media for stirring up the storm. Griffin was not the only victim. Buller, who had done as asked, was controversially dumped for the rest of the series by the MCC, to the fury of the press.\n\nGriffin resorted to underarm bowling after being no-balled at Lord's, and was promptly no-balled for not notifying the umpire he intended to switch from overarm \u2022 PA Photos\n\nPerhaps the most damming evidence came from Gover. He explained that he had remedied the problem ahead of the first Test, but that Griffin's \"consequent loss of pace at Birmingham made him ineffective\u2026 at Lord's he put all he could into his bowling and slipped out of the groove into which he had been put\".\n\nGriffin was contacted by a lawyer who offered to take the matter to court, free of charge. \"You'll win hands down and end up a wealthy young man,\" he said. But Griffin declined. \"I loved cricket too much to sully the great game further.\"\n\nTwo days after the Lord's Test came the inevitable announcement that Griffin would not bowl again on the tour \"for reasons obvious to all\" but would remain with the squad as a batsman. He made one or two useful contributions from the No. 9 spot and was widely praised for what the Cricketer described as \"the superb manner in which he has taken this misfortune\". His behaviour was always polite and measured.\n\nThere was a brief glimmer of hope when, back at Lord's during the tourists' match against Middlesex, he bowled in the nets in front of Bradman and McGlew, wearing a plastic arm split designed by a surgeon, but nothing came of it.\n\nIn 2006, shortly before he died, Griffin said: \"I was the victim of a thoroughly distasteful 'chucking' conspiracy. I was the fall guy. I attribute the blame to the South African cricket authorities and MCC, who should never have allowed things to develop as they did.\"\n\nGriffin returned home and moved from Natal to Rhodesia, but within two years - and still only 23 years old - his career ended when he was repeatedly no-balled against North-Eastern Transvaal at Salisbury.\n\nFormer Rhodesia opener Ray Gripper, who played in that match, told me: \"I must say I also thought that Geoff threw but he had got away with it for some time, and let me say he really could bowl/throw at pace. However, I became thoroughly confused in the game in question when Umpire Fletcher called Geoff for throwing.\n\n\"Geoff left the field and returned a couple of overs later wearing a long-sleeved sweater and bowled with as much pace as he had before. Fletcher once again called him and Geoff took off his sweater to show Fletcher that he was wearing a metal brace on his arm and asked how he could throw with that brace on.\n\n\"I saw it and agreed that there was no way he could bend and straighten his arm while wearing the brace, and yet he had bowled with just the same pace as he had before putting on the brace. So although I had thought Geoff's action suspect, I had no answer as to how he could bowl with the same pace whilst wearing a metal brace. Therefore the question remains as to whether he really did throw or not.\"\n\nWhat happened next? The no-nonsense approach to \"chuckers\" continued and climaxed with the no-balling out of Test cricket of Ian Meckiff, one of the most notorious culprits, in the first Test of the 1963-64 series between Australia and South Africa.\n\nGriffin never played first-class again after being no-balled in Salisbury.

Geoff Griffin, the former South African pace bowler, has died in Durban aged 67.\n\nAlthough he played two Tests and was the first South African to take a hat-trick in a Test, Griffin will best be remembered as the man who was no-balled out of international cricket at Lord's in 1960.\n\nA tall, blond, quick bowler who topped the national averages during the 1959-60 domestic season with 35 wickets at 12.23, his action had been the subject of debate from the moment the South Africans landed. In his defence, he had suffered an accident as a schoolboy which meant he couldn't straighten his arm, but he was playing at a time that there was considerable debate over suspect actions, mainly of Australian fast bowlers.\n\nNo-balled in warm-up matches, he underwent remedial work at Alf Gover's famous indoor school before returning to action, but a number of people were not satisfied.\n\nAt Lord's he took a hat-trick, the first by a South African, but that was completely overshadowed by him being repeatedly no-balled. His career was almost finished when, in an exhibition match played as the Test ended early, he was again called for throwing. Attempting to finish an over by bowling underarm, he was then rather cruelly called for not informing the umpire of a change of action. \"We didn't take the warning seriously,\" he was to recall many years later. \"It sounded so preposterous to use an exhibition match to do the dirty on me. He remained on the tour playing as a specialist batsman.\"\n\nA good-natured and popular player, he was widely praised for the way he took this massive setback. Griffin was contacted by a lawyer who offered to take the matter to court, free of charge. \"You'll win hands down and end up a wealthy young man,\" he said. But he declined. \"I loved cricket too much to sully the great game further.\"\n\nMany felt that the relatively unknown Griffin had been singled out by the authorities, who were desperate to send a message to the world that chuckers would not be tolerated. The fear was that a major row would erupt if Australia brought their batch of suspect bowlers in 1961, and so Griffin was used to show that umpires were prepared, if necessary, to act. If so, it worked. Australia omitted all their fast bowlers whose actions had caused such rancour in 1958-59.\n\n\"I was the victim of a thoroughly distasteful 'chucking' conspiracy,\" Griffin said earlier this year. \"I was the fall guy.

Six South Sydney players would tour with the Kangaroos that year thanks to their efforts for the team in red and green.\n\n2) 1909 \u2013 the no-show from Balmain South Sydney were awarded the 1909 premiership when Balmain forfeited the Final, in protest about being scheduled as a curtain-raiser match to the main fixture between the Kangaroos and the Wallabies. Souths kicked off, a try was awarded, and the men in cardinal and myrtle were declared premiers. A pick-up game was organised of players from other Clubs playing against South Sydney to entertain the crowd. Souths won this game 18-10 at the Royal Agricultural Ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n3) 1914 \u2013 First past the post South Sydney claimed their third premiership in seven years, at the start of the first World War, when they finished on top of the ladder from a fast-finishing Newtown Club. Souths clinched the title with a final round victory over Annandale, 14 points to five at the Agricultural Ground.\n\n4) 1918 \u2013 Book-ending World War I The South Sydney men won their fourth premiership when they finished on top of the ladder ahead of Wests, claiming 24 points for the season and premiership trophy. Souths won the 1914 title at the start of World War I and claimed it again in 1918, the year the Great War ended.\n\n5) 1925 \u2013 Undefeated The South Sydney Club was the talk of the town in 1925, claiming its fifth premiership title with an undefeated record from its 12 games that season. The Club also won the second and third grade titles and the City Cup, leading acclaimed Rugby League journalist Claude Corbett to dub South Sydney, the Pride of the League. 1925 would mark the start of the Club\u2019s first golden era.\n\n\n\n\n\n6) 1926 \u2013 Stability the key South Sydney claimed back-to-back titles in 1926, with the men in red and green overcoming Sydney University in the Final 11 points to five at the Agricultural Ground to win the Truth and Sportsman Cup. South Sydney only used 19 players throughout the entire season.\n\n7) 1927 \u2013 The Three-Peat South Sydney claimed its third straight premiership and its seventh in the first 20 years of the competition, with a 20-11 victory over St George at the Agricultural Ground in the Final. Benny Wearing and George Treweek starred for Souths, with scribes describing this team as the best-balanced team in Rugby League in Australia.\n\n8) 1928 \u2013 Climbing to Four Straight The season of 1928 was not as spectacular as the previous three for South Sydney, but the Club took out its fourth straight premiership title in 1928, smashing Easts 26-5 in the Final. 1928 will be remembered for the semi-final against St George known as \u2018The Battle at Earl Park\u2019. It ranks as one of the bravest wins by a South Sydney side in history, with Souths reduced to 11 men at one stage to finish in regular time at five-all, before going to win 13 pints to five in extra time.\n\n9) 1929 \u2013 High Five The South Sydney Club achieved something that had never been achieved before, and has been done once since, that being winning five consecutive premierships. Souths hammered Newtown 30-10 in the decider at the Sydney Sports Ground with a squad missing almost half the team due to representative commitments for Australia against England in the Old Dart. This truly was a golden era for South Sydney.\n\n10) 1931 \u2013 Winning Smiles During the Great Depression With the Great Depression taking hold across the world following South Sydney\u2019s ninth premiership in 1929, the men in cardinal and myrtle were able to put smiles on the faces on their supporters when they claimed the Club\u2019s tenth title in 1931. A crowd of over 27,000 people saw South Sydney defeat Eastern Suburbs in the Final, 12 points to seven, thanks to a remarkable Harry Eyers try in the final minute of play.\n\n\n\n\n\n11) 1932 \u2013 Seven of the Best With the Great Depression coming to end mid-1932, four years of heartache would begin to lift for people all over the world. With that came the seventh premiership in eight years for the mighty South Sydney Club, the final premiership of the Club\u2019s first golden era. Souths sought revenge against Western Suburbs in the Grand Final in 1932, reversing a 23-8 loss in the Final to defeat the men from the west 19-12 in the decider. Seven premierships in eight years was a remarkable feat and something that brought great joy to many people during one of the toughest periods in Australian history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12) 1950 \u2013 We\u2019re Back South Sydney had experienced a premiership drought the likes of which they not experienced before \u2013 18 years without victory. That would end in 1950 when the Jack Rayner-led side, which included the likes of Clive Churchill, Bernie Purcell, Greg Hawick, Johnny Graves and Ernie Hammerton to name just a few, would go on to be minor premiers and premiers after defeating Wests 21-15 in the Final played at the Sydney Sports Ground in front of 32,373 fans.\n\n13) 1951 \u2013 Sunday Bloody Sunday South Sydney used their right as minor premiers to challenge Manly in the Grand Final in 1951, with Souths having lost to Saints in semi-finals which saw Greg Hawick\u2019s jaw broken in the opening ten minutes, only to have him refuse to leave the field of play. Manly went on to beat Saints in the Final, leaving Souths to challenge Manly in the Grand Final as was their right to challenge as minor premiers. Souths hammered Manly 42-14. Souths\u2019 42 points that day remains the record number of points scored by a team in a premiership decider to this day. This was the first year the JJ Giltinan Shield was presented to the premiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14) 1953 \u2013 Club Success South Sydney were crowned premiers in first grade for the 14th time in 1953, as well as adding the second grade title, the Club Championship and the President\u2019s Cup, with third grade going down by just two points in their decider. Souths defeated old rivals St George 31 points to 12 in the decider with legendary winger Ian Moir scoring a hat-trick courtesy of his combination with \u2018The Little Master\u2019 Clive Churchill.\n\n\n\n\n\n15) 1954 \u2013 Grand Final Glory In the first season of mandatory Grand Finals, South Sydney would not disappoint their fans as they went on to win their fourth premiership in five years, this time over Newtown in the Grand Final, 23 points to 15. Newtown and Souths had done battle all year, throughout the regular season and the finals, and the Grand Final result was a fitting end to a memorable year for both clubs.\n\n16) 1955 \u2013 The Miracle of \u201855 The story of South Sydney in 1955 is one etched in the folklore of Rugby League. Running in eighth spot in a ten team competition, with only three wins from 10 games, the season looked lost for South Sydney. However, led by men of the calibre of Jack Rayner and Clive Churchill, Souths would go on to win their next 11 matches straight, including the Grand Final against Newtown, to claim the Club\u2019s 16th premiership. Clive Churchill famously broke his arm during the second last round game against Manly at Redfern Oval and played on with his arm splinted with the cover of an exercise book. To claim the title in 1955 truly was a miracle, and rounded out the Club\u2019s second golden era, winning five premierships in six years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17) 1967 \u2013 That Intercept The dominance of the St George Club, who had won 11 straight premierships since the Rabbitohs had last won in 1955, would come to an end in 1967 with the introduction of limited-tackle football, when a young South Sydney side would begin the Club\u2019s third golden era. Souths would take on Canterbury-Bankstown in the Grand Final at the Sydney Cricket Ground, with the enduring image from that game being the intercept try to second rower Bob McCarthy on the way to 12-10 victory.\n\n\n\n\n\n18) 1968 \u2013 Best of the Southern Hemisphere The Rabbitohs would go back-to-back for the first time since the mid-fifties in 1968 when the young South Sydney side defeated Manly 13-9 in the Grand Final at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In a developing rivalry with the men from the peninsula, the Rabbitohs led by John Sattler dominated the season to finish as premiers for the 18th time. The team then toured New Zealand beating the Kiwi premiers Mt Albert 27-13, before towelling up Brisbane Brothers 55-15 to be regarded as the best team in the southern hemisphere in 1968.\n\n\n\n\n\n19) 1970 \u2013 Sattler\u2019s Heroics 1970 will always be the 19th premiership season for the Rabbitohs, but it will always be remembered as the Grand Final where Sattler broke his jaw. Up against manly again, South Sydney\u2019s skipper had his jaw smashed in a play off-the-ball by Manly forward John Bucknall. Refusing to leave the field and his team mates, Sattler battled on to lead the team to a famous victory on the turf of the SCG. Sattler\u2019s team mates rallied around him once they realised he had broken his jaw in multiple places in just the third minute of play, which they didn\u2019t know until half time, and registered a 23-12 win over the men in maroon and white.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20) 1971 \u2013 Rule Changes Can\u2019t Stop Souths Despite a number of rule changes being brought in to try and halt the run of the Rabbitohs, such as the six-tackle rule and the reduction of the value of a field goal from two points to one such was the dominance of Eric Simms\u2019 boot, South Sydney would go on to claim the Club\u2019s 20th premiership in 1971. Leading one-nil at half time, Souths would go on to defeat St George 16-10, and Denis Pittard would collect his second Rothmans Medal following his outstanding season in the red and green at the end of the Club\u2019s third golden era.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://rugbyleagueopinions.com/south-sydney-rabbitohs-greatest-xiii-rugby-league-team/", "page_content": "South Sydney Rabbitohs: All-Time Greatest XIII\n\nThe South Sydney Rabbitohs are the most successful club in Australian rugby league history, having won more premierships (21) than any other NRL outfit. Despite their history of success, Souths suffered a premiership drought of 43 seasons between 1971 and 2014, before Sam Burgess and Greg Inglis famously led them out of the wilderness.\n\nThe club was one of the founding members of the original New South Wales Rugby Football League that started in 1908. They have since participated continuously in the official premier rugby league competition in its various incarnations in Australia (the ARL and NRL), except for a controversial two-year period in 2000-2001 when they were excluded. That decision was subsequently overturned on appeal, after several public rallies from their legion of die-hard fans.\n\nBecause of the club\u2019s rich history, coming up with their greatest all-time XIII is a serious challenge. Below are my selections, which are sure to trigger some debates. Those under the age of 50 wouldn\u2019t have seen many of these Rabbitohs players live in action, but their records speak for themselves.\n\nAll of the players selected represented their state and country while playing for the Rabbitohs. Some also had successful stints at other clubs during their careers; however, the stats listed for each player reflect only their first grade matches and achievements wearing the famous red and green jersey.\n\nSo, without further adieu, let\u2019s take a look at the greatest South Sydney Rabbitohs players of all time.\n\nFullback: Clive Churchill\n\n\n\n157 matches (1947-1958), 13 tries, 77 goals.\n\nThe \u2018Little Master\u2019 (as he was known) was one of the original four Immortals named by Rugby League Week when they came up with the concept, so his selection is a \u2018no-brainer\u2019. Only slightly built, Churchill won four premierships with the Rabbitohs, including captain-coaching the team in his final season. He also captained the Australian team in Test matches from 1950-1955.\n\nAfter his playing career ended, Churchill became one of rugby league\u2019s greatest coaches, steering Souths to four premierships in the late 1960s and early 1970s. His legacy is such that the Clive Churchill Medal for the player-of-the-match in contemporary NRL grand finals is named in his honour.\n\nChurchill was the greatest all-round champion the Rugby League code has known.\n\n\u2013 Henry Jersey Flegg\n\nRead More: Players who shouldn\u2019t have won the Clive Churchill Medal.\n\nWinger: Harold Horder\n\n\n\n89 matches (1912-1920, 1924), 102 tries, 71 goals.\n\nWhile other Souths wingers over the years have scored more tries, none have a better strike rate than Harold Horder. Horder averaged better than a try a match over 11 seasons with the Rabbitohs, and won two premierships. His incredible try-scoring record has stood the test of time for nearly a hundred years, making him arguably the best rugby league winger of all time. Horder is also the only Souths player in history to have scored five tries in a premiership match twice. To top it off, he was a handy goal-kicker as well.\n\nCentre: Greg Inglis\n\n124 matches (2011 \u2013 2016), 60 tries.\n\nGreg Inglis is the only modern day Souths player I\u2019ve found a place for in my all-time greatest XIII. Although he hasn\u2019t played a lot in the centres for Souths since joining the club as a key signing in 2011, he is likely to play in that position more in the latter part of his career. He has also excelled as a centre in the State of Origin arena for Queensland for several years, as well as in Test matches for Australia. That versatility allows you to find a spot for him, given that the immortal Clive Churchill has the fullback spot nailed down.\n\nInglis was already an established star when he arrived at Souths, and has been a focal point of their attack ever since. It was fitting that he scored the final try in Souths\u2019 drought-breaking 2014 premiership win, celebrating it with his trademark \u2018goanna walk\u2019.\n\nCentre: Paul Sait\n\n160 matches (1968-1978), 31 tries.\n\nPaul Sait was a powerful and versatile centre/back-rower who won two premierships with Souths in 1970 and 1971. He played in the centres early in his career during an era where the club had a glut of forward talent, before later moving into the backrow. Players transitioning from the backs to the forwards was less common in those days, but Sait\u2019s outstanding form for Souths over the years saw him selected to play Tests for Australia in both positions.\n\nWinger: Ian Moir\n\n110 matches(1952-1958), 105 tries.\n\nLike Harold Horder, Ian Moir was another Souths winger with a phenomenal strike rate. He averaged almost a try a match over seven seasons with the famous club. Reportedly the quickest winger of his era, he scored a hat-trick of tries in South Sydney\u2019s 1953 grand final win, which was one of three premierships he achieved with the Rabbitohs. His finishing ability for Souths resulted in him being selected in Australia\u2019s successful 1957 World Cup team.\n\nFive-eighth: Denis Pittard\n\n121 matches (1967-1973), 56 tries.\n\nDenis Pittard was the first player to win two Rothmans Medals, the equivalent of today\u2019s Dally M Medal for the best player in the competition. Evidence of his ability is the fact that he won those two awards as part of a champion Rabbitohs\u2019 team that contained several internationals. He helped the club achieve three premierships during his time in first grade at Souths.\n\nHalfback: Bob Grant\n\n136 matches (1966-1975), 20 tries.\n\nBob Grant won three premierships with Souths during the golden era for the club in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He and five-eighth Denis Pittard were the best halves pairing in the competition for several seasons. A career highlight for Grant was scoring two of the Rabbitohs\u2019 three tries in their 1970 grand final win over Manly. His consistent excellence saw him named Rugby League Week\u2019s Player of the Year in 1971.\n\nProp: John Sattler\n\n197 matches (1963-1972), 12 tries.\n\nNo Souths forward has a tougher reputation than John Sattler after his heroics in playing almost an entire match with a broken jaw as captain in Souths\u2019 brutal 1970 grand final win. Sam Burgess revived memories of that feat when he played nearly a full game with a broken cheekbone as captain in Souths\u2019 2014 grand final win. Both efforts are considered among the most courageous grand final performances of all time. While Sattler is best remembered for that one encounter, he was an outstanding performer for almost a decade at South Sydney. Sattler captained the Bunnies to four premierships during his career and led the Australian Test team in 1969 and 1970.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about trying to be a hero. It was just something that had to be done. It was a grand final and nothing was going to stop me.\n\n\u2013 John Sattler\n\n\n\n\n\nHooker: Elwyn Walters\n\n129 matches (1967-1973), 17 tries.\n\nElwyn Walters was a skillful dummy half and strong defender, who won three premierships with South Sydney. He only missed a fourth grand final win with Souths through injury. Walters was also a great ball-winner back in the days of contested scrums. That skill was a major part of the hooker\u2019s role in rugby league in that era. Walters\u2019 all-round ability saw him selected for two Kangaroo Tours to Great Britain and France during his time at Souths.\n\nProp: John O\u2019Neill\n\n128 matches (1965-1971, 1975-1976), 11 tries.\n\nJohn O\u2019Neill was a tough, aggressive prop who won four premierships with the Bunnies in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Due to his big frame, he was nicknamed \u2018Lurch\u2019 after the similarly large butler character in The Addams Family, a popular TV show at the time. He and John Sattler formed arguably one of the toughest front row pairings ever seen on a rugby league field.\n\nSecond Rower: Bob McCarthy\n\n211 matches (1963-1975, 1978), 100 tries.\n\nBob McCarthy is the all-time leading try scorer among forwards to have donned the red-and-green jersey and is often cited as one of rugby league\u2019s greatest second rowers. His most famous was an 80 metre intercept in the 1967 grand final against Canterbury, which helped the Rabbitohs to a two-point win. That try alone demonstrated the considerable pace he had to go with his size and strength. McCarthy was also an influential member of Souths\u2019 1970 and 1971 premiership-winning sides. He later captained the Bunnies and led the Australian Test team in 1973.\n\nSecond Rower: Jack Rayner\n\n194 matches (1949-1957), 58 tries.\n\nJack Rayner started his career with Souths at the late age of 25 due to serving in the Australian army in Papua New Guinea in World War II. After the War ended, his leadership skills saw him rise quickly to be the captain and then captain-coach of the club for the majority of his playing career. Rayner steered Souths to five premierships, an all-time record for a captain-coach, and is deservedly remembered as one of the finest Rabbitohs players.\n\nLock: Ron Coote\n\n151 matches (1964-1971), 48 tries.\n\nRon Coote was a tall, rangy lock with a distinctive running style. He was also well known for his brilliant cover defence. Coote won four premierships with the champion Rabbitohs side of the late 1960s and early 1970s. He was rewarded for his stellar Souths form by being named captain of the Australian team for the World Cup held in Great Britain in 1970, a tournament that the Kangaroos won.\n\nCoote played alongside Sattler, Walters, O\u2019Neill, McCarthy & Gary Stevens in what was arguably the greatest forward pack of all-time.\n\nSo those are my selections as the best South Sydney Rabbitohs players. I can\u2019t even find a spot for Sam Burgess given the career achievements of the star-studded forward pack. Some other very handy players haven\u2019t made my team, like Eric Simms (fullback), Mike Cleary (winger), Benny Wearing (winger), Nathan Merritt (winger and Souths all-time leading try scorer), Ray Branighan (centre), Alf Blair (five-eighth), Les Cowie (lock), George Treweek (second-row), and George Piggins (hooker). None of them would be out of place.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n23"}, {"url": "https://www.nrl.com/news/2021/09/30/true-believer-albanese-says-bunnies-back-where-they-belong/", "page_content": "Federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese believes a 22nd South Sydney premiership on Sunday would prove their 2014 success \"wasn't a fluke\" and be a fitting send-off for super coach Wayne Bennett.\n\nA generational Rabbitohs fan who \u201ccame out of the womb supporting South Sydney\u201d and attended the 1971 grand final with his mother, Albanese has not only been a long-suffering fan through the ups and downs over more than half a century but also served as a member of the club's board.\n\nAfter falling one win short for the past three seasons, the Rabbitohs are now in their second grand final in seven years \u2013 but the Suncorp Stadium showdown against Penrith is also only the club\u2019s second grand final since 1971.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t come by too often,\u201d Albanese told NRL.com. \u201cIt is our second grand final in 50 years. We have won 21 premierships, so we have been pretty good in grand finals over the years.\n\n\u201c1969 was my first memory \u2026 we lost 11-2, of course, and we are still cross about [Balmain] players laying down. We don\u2019t want to miss that opportunity to win a grand final.\n\n\u201cIt would mean so much if we were to win because what it would show is that 2014 wasn\u2019t a fluke.\u201d\n\nUp Next / Cancel Replay Play Next Anthony Albanese explains what makes Bennett so special\n\n'In Wayne we trust'\n\nAlbanese has known Bennett since before he joined the club in 2019 and believes the seven-time premiership winning coach is poised to leave the club with a grand final win on Sunday night.\n\n\u201cWayne gives people that sense of belief so when people wrote us off after Latrell Mitchell was suspended I didn\u2019t because I was sure that Wayne would use that to get the best out of the team,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe is actually interested in politics, he tells a good story and he has a fantastic sense of humour.\n\n\u201cI have seen him in the dressing room giving talks after wins and after losses. He doesn\u2019t say that much but they hang off every word and they would run through a brick wall for him \u2013 and they do.\u201d\n\nRevive, survive and thrive\n\nAlbanese said a win on Sunday would reaffirm the view he and others involved in the club\u2019s fight for reinstatement 20 years ago held about the Rabbitohs\u2019 potential to not only survive - but thrive - if given a chance.\n\nHe was a member of the Rabbitohs\u2019 board when the club was cut from the competition in 1999 - when the premiership was reduced to 14 teams - until after their return in 2002.\n\nUp Next / Cancel Replay Play Next Benji's overlooked resilience his proudest trait\n\nHe helped organise rallies, tabled motions in parliament against the club's expulsion and was among those in a packed courtroom on July 6, 2001 when Souths' legal team, led by current chairman Nick Pappas, won their case for readmission.\n\nAlbanese later spoke in favour of selling a 75 per cent stake in the club to Russell Crowe and Peter Holmes a Court at a meeting of more than 3000 Rabbitohs members in 2006 that set Souths on the path to ending their 43-year premiership drought in 2014.\n\nBefore the 2014 triumph against Canterbury, an entire generation of fans had listened to stories about the courage of John Sattler, the brilliance of Clive Churchill and how Souths had won 20 premierships in 63 years, without ever celebrating success themselves.\n\nAfter winning the minor premiership in 1989, the Rabbitohs were wooden spooners in 1990 and didn\u2019t feature in the finals again before failing to meet the criteria for a streamlined 14-team NRL in 2000.\n\nHowever, the likes of Albanese, Pappas and Crowe, along with a fiercely determined club patriarch in George Piggins and other \u201ctrue believers\u201d such as Andrew Denton, Ray Martin, Mike Whitney, Don Lane, Deirdre Grusovin and Laurie Brereton, insisted Souths could return to the glory days.\n\n\u201cI joined the board when the NRL had been reconstituted after the Super League war,\u201d Albanese said.\n\nSouths is a phenomenon and it something that people relate to. Anthony Albanese\n\n\u201cWe thought the criteria was stacked against us and didn\u2019t give enough credit to history and heritage, and to the level of support South Sydney has.\n\n\u201cTo me that fightback was an extraordinary experience. I will never forget when we lost the first court case and coming back to Souths Leagues Club, there were people who had been in tears.\n\n\u201cI remember this elderly woman who I got to know. She was quite distraught, and she said to me, \u2018South Sydney is all I have. How can they take it away from me?\u2019 We made the decision in a board meeting later that day that we would continue the fight.\n\n\u201cI think we had about 10 days to organise the second big rally and because we didn\u2019t have any money \u2026 that would be a sign of whether people wanted to continue to engage in the fight.\n\n\u201cIt was just incredible, people came from everywhere and there we were on the steps of Sydney Town Hall with over 100,000 people led by George Piggins, who showed incredible courage and leadership during that period.\n\n\u201cNewcastle Knights fans came down, people who supported other NRL clubs were all there with us and there were people who didn\u2019t even follow rugby league but who just thought it was wrong that something so embedded in the community was being taken from them.\n\n\u201cIt said a lot to me a lot about why rugby league has that sense of community, that sense of belonging and who you are - that sense of identity.\u201d\n\nUp Next / Cancel Replay Play Next Finals focus: Walker stars as Rabbitohs book grand final spot\n\nSense of pride\n\nSince their return, Albanese said the Rabbitohs had not only re-emerged as regular premiership contenders but have maintained their strong links with the Indigenous community and the Souths Juniors competition, which produced six members of Sunday\u2019s grand final team.\n\n\u201cThe link with the Indigenous community is one of the reasons I know why Greg Inglis came to play for Souths,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a real sense of pride about that and it has made an enormous difference.\n\n\u201cGreg Inglis could have played wherever he wanted. He was at the time the best player in the world, but he chose Souths in part because of that commitment.\n\n\u201cLatrell Mitchell, a proud Indigenous man, coming to Souths has also really added to the side so we have been able to attract players of quality and in Wayne Bennett, we attracted the 'super coach', who has made such a difference since he came to the club.\u201d\n\nUp Next / Cancel Replay Play Next Looking back at the 2014 grand final\n\nRandom Souths Guy\n\nWith Sunday\u2019s grand final moved to Queensland due to COVID restrictions and Sydney in lockdown, Albanese will be forced to watch at home like most Souths fans, but he said the support for the team was still noticeable.\n\n\u201cSouths is a phenomenon and it something that people relate to,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI noticed at the AFL grand final in Perth last Saturday night, there was a Random Souths Guy. At almost any event, it doesn\u2019t matter if it is the tennis at Wimbledon or the Masters Golf, you will see someone there in a Souths top or cap.\n\n\u201cThere is that real sense of energy in the community.\n\n\u201cYou see people walking around with their South Sydney gear on and that will be the case all week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that we can\u2019t go to the game or get together to watch it but the plus side is how good the NRL, the players, the administration, the coaches, all the support staff and the Queensland Government have been for keeping NRL going.\n\nUp Next / Cancel Replay Play Next Burgess brothers still a big part of Tom's Rabbitohs journey\n\n\u201cIt has given people that sense of community and belonging even though we are by ourselves.\n\n\u201cIn some ways the community has never been more together than it has been during COVID, with people making sacrifices for each other.\n\n\u201cOne of the sacrifices we are making is not being able to go to the grand final but we will be celebrating virtually.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.rabbitohs.com.au/content/top-5-rabbitohs-of-the-1950s", "page_content": "Team list Top 5 Rabbitohs Of The 1950s\n\nThere is no denying the Rabbitohs are a Club with a great history full of great players. The team at Rabbitohs.com.au have put our heads together to look back and name, in our opinion, the Top 5 Players of each decade from the 1950s to the 2000s. Here are our Top 5 Players of the 1950s - Let us know what you think on Twitter or Facebook!\n\n5) Les 'Chicka' Cowie Arguably one of the best lock forwards of his time, \u2018Chicka\u2019 Cowie played an integral role in the dominance of the golden era of the Rabbitohs. A brutal tackler and effective blind-side attacking player, Cowie played in five premiership winning teams between during his 178 appearance for Souths. His four tries in the 1956 final against Balmain, a Club record for a forward, was a reflection of his brilliant positional ability. Cowie also represented Australia six times in his career. When his career ended in 1958, Cowie continued with Souths as a selector before progressing to the Australian selection panel in 1978. Born 17 May 1925 Position Lock Club Appearance 178 Club Points 198 (66 Tries) Representative Honours 10 Matches For NSW, 6 Tests For Australia Representative Points 6 (2 Tries) 4) Ian Moir The fastest man in Rugby League during the 1950s, Ian Moir was a try scoring phenomenon in the 1950s. Debuting in 1952, Moir quickly established himself as a force on the field. In 1953 he was the season\u2019s leading try scorer with 20 tries and another three coming in the Grand Final win over St George. Moir would be joint leading try-scorer in the 1957 World Cup and help Australia lift the trophy in their undefeated campaign. With 104 tries to his name in 110 appearance, Moir still stands in the Souths records book thanks to his five tries in a game against Parramatta in 1957 \u2013 he shares this record with several other Rabbitohs. Even in 1988 Moir still had his trademark athleticism, winning the 1988 NSW Veterans (50-54 years old) 100m Championship in 12.7 seconds.\n\nBorn 1932 Position Winger Club Appearance 110 Club Points 312 (104 Tries) Representative Honours 10 Matches For NSW, 8 Tests For Australia Representative Points 51 (17 Tries) 3) Bernie Purcell A product of St Peters, Surry Hills, Purcell was a stalwart for the Rabbitohs during their golden era. A goal-kicking second-row forward with absolute composure on the ball, Purcell became the first Australian forward to score over 1,000 career points and the first Australian forward to kick over 500 goals (a record only matched by three other players up until 2011). Captaining Souths on several occasions, Purcell\u2019s coolness sealed the 1955 premiership with a late conversion to beat Newtown by a point (12-11). After retiring, Bernie went on the coach Souths in the 60s. He played a huge part in working to save Souths from a financial crisis in the early 70s and again when we were excluded from the NRL competition. Sadly, Purcell passed away in 2001, aged 73, and did not get the chance to see Souths take the field in their return season. Born 1928 Position Second-Row Club Appearance 178 Club Points 1126 (36 Tries, 509 Goals) Representative Honours 4 Matches For NSW, 1 Test For Australia Representative Points 3 (1 Try) 2) Jack Rayner The most dominant Captain and Coach in Souths history, Jack Rayner led Souths during our golden era of the 1950s. Winning premierships in \u201950, \u201951, \u201953, \u201954 and \u201955, Jack stands as the most successful captain in Rugby League history (alongside Ken Kearney) and was the first man to coach a side to five Grand Final victories. A police detective by trade, his tough leadership and inspirational performances as a forward culminated in the miracle of \u201955 when Rayner managed to rouse Souths to a remarkable comeback to claim the premiership. In the words of Clive Churchill; \u201cHe was a brilliant tactician. I never saw a better forward in cover defence on the blind side than Rayner. Jack was the crankiest forward I played with but what a grand fellow he was.\u201d Born 11 April 1921 Position Second-Row Club Appearance 194 Club Points 190 (58 Tries, 8 Goals) Representative Honours 16 Matches For NSW, 5 Test For Australia Representative Points 15 (5 Tries) 1) Clive Churchill The Little Master - a Rugby League Immortal and namesake of the Clive Churchill Medal for man-of-the-match in NRL Grand Finals \u2013 Clive Churchill retired as the most capped Kangaroo and left a huge imprint on the game in the way he changed the role of fullback. There was no aspect of his game that he didn\u2019t master \u2013 attack, defence, support play, kicking, captaincy and finally, coaching. Churchill was courageous in standing up to bigger opponents and was electrifying when he came into the attack. His courage was best displayed in the last regular game of the 1955 season when Churchill kicked a successful sideline conversion after the full-time bell with a broken arm wrapped in cardboard. After retiring he linked up with Souths again in 1966 to preside over a record ten season in the Club\u2019s second golden period."}, {"url": "https://www.theroar.com.au/2023/03/17/feud-for-thought-the-best-players-whove-lined-up-for-rabbitohs-and-roosters-in-nrl-era/", "page_content": "Friday night marks the 230th match-up between the two oldest teams in Australian rugby league, heritage clubs Sydney Roosters and South Sydney Rabbitohs.\n\nThey have been linked since 1908, where South Sydney beat the then named Eastern Suburbs 14-12 in the inaugural grand final.\n\nThe clubs have enjoyed a healthy rivalry, with South Sydney having won only 15 more head-to-head clashes. When Australian Kangaroos regular Ron Coote defected from South Sydney to Easts in 1972, the rivalry went up another level to pure hatred.\n\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\n\nSince then, there has been a smattering of players who have donned both the tri-colours and the cardinal and myrtle. This week, the Roosters have signed Nathan Brown, who although not named in the Round 3 side, will join this list.\n\nHere is the best side from the NRL era of those who have played for these two famous clubs.\n\n1. Latrell Mitchell\n\nSydney Roosters \u2013 96 matches \u2013 2 premierships\n\nSouth Sydney \u2013 50 matches\n\nThis one is a no-brainer. Mitchell started in the Roosters SG Ball Cup team, before being rushed into the NRL side as a baby-faced 18-year-old. From there, he featured prominently as a centre in the Roosters\u2019 back-to-back title-winning sides of 2018-19. Instead of staying put in search of a three-peat, Mitchell chose the club he supported as a child for the chance to play fullback.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Shannon Hegarty\n\nSydney Roosters \u2013 109 matches \u2013 1 premiership\n\nSouth Sydney \u2013 59 matches\n\nShannon Hegarty was a hard-nosed, undersized winger who ran the ball hard and had a knack of scoring important tries. Playing three games for Queensland in 2003, he featured heavily in the early 2000s Roosters sides. He played in four grand finals, and scored the opening try in the 2002 victory against the Warriors. After losing the 2004 Grand final to the Bulldogs, Hegarty played four years on the flank for South Sydney.\n\n3. Adam MacDougall\n\nSydney Roosters \u2013 6 matches\n\nSouth Sydney \u2013 31 matches\n\nMost fans would remember Adam \u2018Mad Dog\u2019 MacDougall from his time with the Newcastle Knights, where he famously had a longstanding feud with Wendell Sailor. However he started his career at the Roosters and also had a stint at South Sydney. Today he is the man behind \u2018The Man Shake\u2019, a weight loss shake which has made him a wealthy man.\n\n4. Shane Rigon\n\nSydney Roosters \u2013 84 matches \u2013 1 grand final\n\nSouth Sydney \u2013 99 matches\n\nShane Rigon had a handy career spanning 213 first grade games. Playing off the bench for the Roosters 2000 grand final loss to the Broncos, the lock/centre then moved to Bradford for one year, before returning home to play 99 games for the cellar-dweller Rabbitohs.\n\n5. Chris Walker\n\nSouth Sydney \u2013 5 matches\n\nSydney Roosters \u2013 47 matches\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Walker is the only man on this list to have played for both clubs in the same season. Whilst not the only player to do so, his controversial mid-season move to the Roosters in 2003 saw him receive death threats in the mail. A talented journeyman who played for six NRL clubs, his career was marred by a handful of incidents which eventually saw him sacked from his 2006 stint with the Melbourne Storm.\n\n6. Luke Keary\n\nSouth Sydney \u2013 65 matches \u2013 1 premiership\n\nSydney Roosters \u2013 118 matches \u2013 2 premierships\n\nLuke Keary famously split from the Rabbitohs after a confrontation with team owner Russell Crowe at his farm near Coffs Harbour in 2016. At that point he was a premiership winner, playing off the bench for the 2014 drought-breaking side. Since then, he has won two premierships with the Roosters, joining a short but illustrious list of players who have a premiership at both clubs.\n\n7. Craig Wing\n\nSouth Sydney \u2013 71 matches\n\nSydney Roosters \u2013 185 matches \u2013 1 premiership\n\nCraig Wing was a South Sydney junior who debuted for the Bunnies just before they were booted from the competition in 1999. Moving to the cross-town rivals was the lifeline to continue his career and it thrived. Wing would go onto feature in four grand finals, 12 origins and 17 Tests before returning to South Sydney in 2008.\n\n8. David Kidwell\n\nSydney Roosters \u2013 19 matches\n\nSouth Sydney \u2013 38 matches\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA hard hitting front rower, whose eventual coaching resume revealed an impeccable footballing brain, Kidwell featured heavily for the Kiwis over his career, playing 25 tests for New Zealand. Whilst he did not play in the 2002 Grand Final, Kidwell was an important squad member playing 19 games in that campaign. After playing the bulk of his career in Melbourne, Kidwell returned to Sydney to finish his playing career with Souths.\n\n9. Mick Crocker\n\nSydney Roosters \u2013 92 matches \u2013 1 premiership\n\nSouth Sydney \u2013 68 matches\n\nWhilst not remembered as a hooker, this Queensland Maroons stalwart found himself as the starting dummy-half for the Roosters in their 2003 Grand Final loss to Penrith. Having already won in 2002, success seemed to follow Crocker throughout his career. In his three years at Melbourne, Crocker lost only three games. After picking up a second grand final win, Crocker found himself at South Sydney, after a failed visa application blocked a Super League move. Crocker may have played in a sixth grand final if he did not retire at the end of 2013.\n\n10. Peter Cusack\n\nSydney Roosters \u2013 95 matches \u2013 1 premiership\n\nSouth Sydney \u2013 73 matches\n\nAnother Arthur Beetson discovery, Cusack featured heavily in the early 2000s dominant Roosters sides, winning their clubman of the year in 2002. When he moved to Souths in 2005 he replicated that effort, winning the George Piggins Medal. Cusack would eventually co-captain the side.\n\n11. Ashley Harrison\n\nSouth Sydney \u2013 66 matches\n\nSydney Roosters \u2013 41 matches\n\nPlaying close to 300 NRL games and a mainstay of Queensland\u2019s dominant streak in Origin, Harrison captained the South Sydney Rabbitohs during his 66 games there. His move to the Roosters was not so successful, as the club went through two years of disappointment. Harrison eventually found his long term home, playing 117 games at the Gold Coast Titans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. Bryan Fletcher\n\nSydney Roosters \u2013 135 matches \u2013 1 premiership\n\nSouth Sydney \u2013 45 matches\n\nThe less decorated of the comedic duo Fletch and Hindy, Bryan Fletcher grew up in the eastern suburbs playing for the Paddington Colts. He eventually debuted for the Roosters and was fast tracked to representative honours. After his infamous \u2018hand grenade\u2019 celebration in Origin, and a try scoring effort in the 2002 premiership win, Fletcher defected to South Sydney to captain the side in their early years post re-admission to the NRL.\n\n13. Angus Crichton\n\nSouth Sydney \u2013 55 matches\n\nSydney Roosters \u2013 87 matches \u2013 1 premiership\n\nAngus Crichton came through the Roosters junior system whilst starring for Scots College in rugby union. Also a part of the Waratahs system, it was Souths who gave him his first opportunity when the \u2018Tahs told him he would have to wait a few more years. Crichton played three years at Souths before signing for the Roosters, the team he supported since birth. Crichton was part of the 2019 premiership winning side and is currently away from the game while he deals with personal issues.\n\nBench:\n\n14.

Since it is Member Appreciation Round, I thought I\u2019d share my story. My family have always been Souths fans having been born and bred in Redfern. Even though I had been playing League since age eight, my first proper introduction to the Rabbitohs was in 2007 when I was in my final year of primary school. Our sports coordinator was a huge Souths fan and for an assembly he invited a few of the players to talk to the school about not only the Club but to promote health and fitness awareness. One that stood out immediately was Beau Champion, who I thought had one of, if not, the best names ever. He became an instant favourite. The way he spoke about his passion for the Club and their changing culture made me intrigued. I always liked an underdog story and this one called out to me. From then on I decided I\u2019d start to follow the Club more closely.\n\nI was lucky enough to return from an overseas trip in time to see the Round 25 clash with the Sydney Roosters where David Fa\u2019alogo and Braith Anasta were involved in their infamous scuffle, which is when my hatred for the Eastern Suburbs club began, so much so that I refuse to call them the Sydney Roosters. In 2008 came the return of the prodigal son in the form of Craig Wing, which I made sure to rub in the noses of my mates who supported the tri-colours. While it was a dour season in terms of results, I started regularly attending games with my cousins, with whom still sit in the Burrow with me today. Although I was regularly attending games, I still wanted to prove my commitment to the cause. I wanted to know every little detail I could find about the Club players and especially the rich history and working class values it stood for. Even though the ticket only included home games, my cousins and I still managed to attend a majority of the games, which included road trips to the Central Coast, Manly, Cronulla, Penrith and Wollongong. Some of the memorable moments in my first year of Membership included demolishing the Roosters in Round 1 by 40 points, witnessing Nathan Merritt\u2019s field goal against the Tigers, Beau Champion\u2019s hat trick against the Broncos and the debuts of Dave Tyrrell, Chris McQueen and Jason Clark. Once again we missed the finals, but I was intent on being there the day the Club won its 21st Premiership. With each year the Club began to field a more formidable team. The likes of Sam Burgess, Greg Inglis, and Ben Te\u2019o joining the Club, alongside Michael Maguire, who was a promising young coach who had some success in the English Super League season at the time. The 2012 season was one of my favourite seasons as there was so much anticipation and so many questions to be answered. How will we go with this new coach? How much will we miss Chris Sandow? Can they finally make the 8 after falling short so many years? Thankfully after 4 years without seeing my beloved Rabbitohs making the finals, they were able to break through under the guidance of \u2018Madge\u2019 and finish in the top 4 for the first time since our last Minor Premiership way back in 1989.\n\nMadge brought an intense work ethic and discipline to the Club that it had been lacking for quite some time, and made the career defining masterstroke to move Greg Inglis into the fullback role. Unfortunately, I was overseas while the boys took on the Bulldogs in their preliminary final loss, and while it did hurt, it felt great knowing we were a Club on the rise, especially with our young halfback Adam Reynolds (who is my favourite current player). In 2013 we were an unstoppable force. I fed off the determination and the commitment the players showed week in, week out. We were winning games with ease and breaking records left, right and centre. I was so sure that 2013 would be our year. And then, tragedy struck. We collapsed against a red-hot Sea Eagles in the preliminary after leading 14-0. It was the second year in a row where we had fallen at the final hurdle. I was shattered. In disbelief. The pain was too much. I\u2019d have to wait another year to even see if they could make it back to the preliminary finals, and that\u2019s if they were able to. Morale was low but I still had a flicker of belief. The beginning of 2014 was bittersweet. Fan favourite Sam Burgess had announced that at the end of the year he would be leaving the Club to take up a contract in rugby union. I was shattered. But one of the perks of membership comes in the form of prizes. I was lucky enough to win a game day experience with Michael Crocker and Scott Geddes at Belmore Oval when we took on the Bulldogs in one of the trial matches that pre-season. The boys were great to be around and weren\u2019t deterred by the fact they were having beers with a bunch of 18 year olds. They spoke as regular blokes and provided some great conversation and made the experience one of a kind. Later that year I was lucky enough to be a part of John Sutton\u2019s record breaking match, being allowed onto the hallowed SCG while holding up a banner to celebrate the occasion. Again, it was thanks to a Membership prize which my mate won and invited me to join him. Surely this was a good omen.\n\nThe 2014 season was the definition of a rollercoaster ride. We saw Lote Tuqiri join the Club, and after some on field struggles he was able to regain his mojo and lock down a spot in the backline. Issac Luke suffered a long term injury which proved to be a blessing in disguise as Api Koroisau and Cam McInnes made their NRL debuts and showed their worth in the team. We saw a crop of young guns like Alex Johnston, Kyle Turner, Luke Keary, Kirisome Auva\u2019a and Dylan Walker rise through to knock off some of the older heads which spurred the team on and provided the spark they desperately needed. The likes of Adam Reynolds, the Burgess brothers, John Sutton, Ben Te\u2019o and Greg Inglis grew another leg. As the season went on the team grew not only on the field but off the field. There was a sense of real belief not only from fans but in the area. The team came third in the regular season and demolished the Sea Eagles in the semi-final; sweet revenge from last year. Then it was our old rivals, the Roosters, in the preliminary final. How appropriate to take on your enemy to overcome adversity. The boys fell to a 12-0 deficit in the first ten minutes. This surely could not happen again\u2026 The boys fought hard and piled on 32 points thanks to a masterclass from the man GI. There was still one more game to go, but knowing I had witnessed Souths make their first Grand Final in over four decades. The moment not only belonged to the boys but to me. Grand Final week was absolutely surreal. Being a Redfern local, the whole area was buzzing. Thousands of people came to Redfern Oval just to see the team train, and you could feel a great, positive energy in the community. I wasn\u2019t too sure what to think and how to feel. I was confident but weary. The Bulldogs weren\u2019t to be taken lightly and for most of the match they competed and did their fans proud, but there was no stopping the Red and Green tsunami that was about to hit them. After what felt like an eternity, kick off was finally underway. Sam Burgess took on his old mate James Graham and came away from the tackle second best. He was pointing at his face. Something was wrong and this wasn\u2019t good."}, {"url": "https://www.rabbitohs.com.au/content/menulog-team-of-the-decade-revealed", "page_content": "Team list Menulog Team of the Decade Revealed\n\nOver the last 10 years the Rabbitohs have found themselves in their most successful decade since the glory years of the 1970s.
