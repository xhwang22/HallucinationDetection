{"Hisashi Iwakuma signed with the Mariners in January 2012.": [{"url": "https://theathletic.com/2147688/2020/10/19/appreciating-hisashi-iwakumas-memorable-mariners-moments/", "page_content": "The Mariners weren\u2019t entirely sure what they were getting when they signed Japanese pitcher Hisashi Iwakuma to a one-year deal in January 2012.\n\nIwakuma, a right-hander, had a decorated past in Japan and a history of durability, but he was four months shy of his 31st birthday when he signed with Seattle. And on top of that, he was coming off a season where a sore right shoulder limited him to 17 starts and his diminished velocity raised red flags.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeattle\u2019s caution was revealed in the terms of Iwakuma\u2019s deal with the team \u2014 one year and $1.15 million, though the contract did come with incentives that could garner Iwakuma an additional $3 million. In an offseason where the Mariners had chased free agent slugger Prince Fielder, the deal for Iwakuma felt, well, a little underwhelming.\n\nBut over parts of the next six seasons, Iwakuma \u2014 who on Monday announced he will retire following the end of the season in Japan \u2014 not only proved a value for Seattle but provided plenty of memorable moments along the way, accumulating a 16.9 WAR and a 3.42 ERA before heading back to his home country in 2018.\n\n\u201cKuma is a warrior, is my best way to put it,\u201d Mariners manager Scott Servais said in 2018. \u201cHe\u2019d come into a ballgame and you\u2019d look up in the first or second inning and think, \u2018My gosh, he doesn\u2019t have much today. How\u2019s he going to get through it?\u2019 And he\u2019d find a way.\u201d\n\nIwakuma was an All-Star and finished third in the American League Cy Young Award voting in 2013 when he had a 2.66 ERA. Two years later, he tossed the fifth no-hitter in franchise history. In September 2018, a year after undergoing shoulder surgery, Iwakuma decided to head back to Japan to finishing pitching where he started. He\u2019s on the roster of the Tokyo Giants but has yet to pitch this season because of lingering shoulder issues.\n\nAs for his time in Seattle, Iwakuma said it was an unforgettable chapter in his professional and personal life.\n\n\u201cThis is a city that I played for, for seven years and a city that I not only lived in, it\u2019s by far the best city that I can think of,\u201d Iwakuma said in September 2018 through his interpreter, Antony Suzuki. \u201cThe city has treated me well. The fans were great. I only have good memories here.\u201d\n\nWe decided to pay homage to Iwakuma\u2019s time in Seattle by breaking down his three best starts with the Mariners (sorted by Baseball-Reference\u2019s game scores).\n\n3. Sept. 25, 2013 vs. Royals (Game score: 82)\n\nHis line: 8 innings, 4 hits, 0 earned runs, 1 walk, 9 strikeouts\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was Iwakuma\u2019s final start in his best season with the Mariners, who would finish 71-91 \u2014 20 games ahead of the Astros (!). This was a pretty nice Royals lineup Iwakuma had his way with. Alex Gordon, Billy Butler, Eric Hosmer, Salvador P\u00e9rez, Mike Moustakas \u2014 a lot of these guys helped the Royals win the World Series two years later, but this loss eliminated the Royals from the postseason. Iwakuma got 13 swinging strikes and 17 called strikes while the Mariners turned two double plays behind him. In many ways, it was the perfect finish to an almost perfect season for Iwakuma, who was 4-0 with a 1.62 ERA over his final eight starts and didn\u2019t allow a run in 23 consecutive innings over his last three games. Get this: He was the only big-league pitcher in 2013 to have two streaks of 20-plus scoreless innings. \u201cHe\u2019s special,\u201d Mariners third baseman Kyle Seager said.\n\n2. Aug. 19, 2014 at Phillies (Game score: 85)\n\nHis line: 8 innings, 4 hits, 0 earned runs, 0 walks, 11 strikeouts\n\nFacing a less-than-stellar lineup (the Phillies finished 2014 with a 73-89 record), Iwakuma carved up the Fightins with an outing that was equal part dominant and efficient, as 74 of the 96 pitches he threw were for strikes over his eight innings of work. The Phillies were guessing all night, as evidenced by the 23 called strikes he amassed. Iwakuma\u2019s split-finger fastball proved devastating, especially against a team not used to seeing him \u2014 remember, this was interleague play. Only one player on the roster, Ben Revere, had ever faced Iwakuma. This was just the third interleague start in Iwakuma\u2019s career. The results of those three starts? Twenty-two scoreless innings. \u201cHe was outstanding,\u201d Seattle manager Lloyd McClendon said. \u201cHe commanded all of his pitches. He was in and out and up and down.\u201d\n\n1. Aug. 12, 2015 vs Orioles (Game score: 91)\n\nHis line: 9 innings, 0 hits, 0 earned runs, 3 walks, 7 strikeouts\n\nYou were waiting for this one, right? Iwakuma authored the fifth no-hitter in franchise history during a Wednesday afternoon game against the Orioles, who weren\u2019t actually awful in 2015 (finishing 81-81). He became just the second Japanese pitcher in Major League history to throw a no-hitter (Hideo Nomo was the first to do so in 2001). The funny thing (well, sort of funny) was that Iwakuma was neither overpowering (seven strikeouts), nor supremely in command (three walks). But he was plenty good, getting 19 swinging strikes. Said Orioles manager Buck Showalter after the game. \u201cHe didn\u2019t miss.\u201d There were no real close calls in the field for Iwakuma. Seager made a nice over-the-shoulder catch for the first out in foul territory to start the ninth inning, and the n0-no was complete when Iwakuma got Gerardo Parra to line out softly to center fielder Austin Jackson. This was the first American League no-hitter since F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez threw a perfect game against the Rays on Aug. 15, 2012. \u201cI can\u2019t find the words to express my feelings,\u201d Iwakuma said after the game. \u201cI\u2019m truly happy.\u201d\n\n(Photo of Iwakuma: Otto Greule Jr / Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://mlb.nbcsports.com/2012/01/05/mariners-sign-hisashi-iwakuma-to-one-year-1-5m-contract/", "page_content": "From ESPN\u2019s Jerry Crasnick comes word that the Mariners have signed Japanese right-hander Hisashi Iwakuma to a one-year, $1.5 million major league contract. The agreement also carries another $3.4 million in performance-based incentives.\n\nIwakuma, 30, registered a superb 2.42 ERA and 90/19 K/BB ratio in 119 innings last season for the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles of Nippon Professional Baseball. He posted a 2.82 ERA and 153/36 K/BB ratio across 201 innings in 2010.\n\nThe A\u2019s tried to sign Iwakuma last offseason, offering up a $19 million posting fee for exclusive negotiating rights, but the two sides ultimately failed to work out a major league contract. If everything goes well in spring training with the Mariners, the 6-foot-3 native of Tokyo should grab a spot at the back end of the Seattle starting rotation."}, {"url": "https://www.mlb.com/news/hisashi-iwakuma-mariners-special-assignment-coach", "page_content": "\n\n\",\"providerName\":\"Twitter\",\"providerUrl\":\"https://twitter.com\",\"type\":\"oembed\",\"width\":550,\"contentType\":\"rich\"},{\"__typename\":\"Markdown\",\"content\":\"The Tokyo native, who pitched in Nippon Professional Baseball for 11 seasons, could be an invaluable addition in this scouting arena for a Mariners club that has consistently had one of the stronger MLB imprints in Japan. Beyond signing Iwakuma in 2012, the club successfully signed Ichiro Suzuki in \u201800 and Kikuchi in \u201819, and it was believed to be the runner-up for Shohei Ohtani in \u201917.\n\n\n\nIwakuma was among Japan\u2019s top pitchers before joining Seattle as an international free agent in 2012, having won the Pacific League MVP Award in \u201908. The right-hander retired from professional baseball in October after experiencing prolonged shoulder injuries, an issue that dated back to when he first signed with Seattle ahead of his age-31 season. His final appearances as a professional came for the Yomiuri Giants in '19.\n\n\n\nBut when healthy, Iwakuma was one of the Mariners\u2019 most effective pitchers over his six seasons in Seattle (2012-17), going 63-39 with a 3.42 ERA in 150 games, including 136 starts. The \u201813 All-Star\u2019s career ERA is tied for the lowest in club history (min. 500 innings) with Randy Johnson, Felix Hernandez and James Paxton. He was voted the most valuable Mariners pitcher in \u201913 and \u201916 by the Seattle chapter of the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America, and he was a finalist for the AL Cy Young Award in \u201913.\n\n\n\nIwakuma is most immortalized for throwing the fifth no-hitter in club history on Aug. 12, 2015, against Baltimore, when he joined Hideo Nomo as just the second Japanese-born pitcher to throw a no-no in the Majors.\",\"type\":\"text\"}],\"contentType\":\"news\",\"subHeadline\":null,\"summary\":\"SEATTLE -- The Mariners are bringing back a familiar face, as the club announced Tuesday that it has hired former pitcher Hisashi Iwakuma as a special assignment coach.

The A's and Iwakuma, though, couldn't agree on a contract, and Iwakuma returned to Japan. I'd like to take you back for a moment:\n\nJapanese media had reported that Oakland made a four-year proposal worth $15.25 million. In terms of annual salary, it is equal to what Iwakuma made with the Eagles of Japan's Pacific League. \"Their offer was low and they weren't sincere,\" [agent] Nomura said.\n\nOkay, now keep that in mind. After the 2011 season, Iwakuma became a free agent. Recently, he's been linked to the Mariners, and, Jerry Crasnick, just a little while ago:\n\nFree agent Hisashi Iwakuma has agreed on one-year deal with Mariners\n\nFurther:\n\nDeal will pay Iwakuma a guaranteed $1.5M. He can earn $4.9M with awards and incentive bonuses based on starts and IP.\n\nIn December 2010, Iwakuma walked away from a reported $15.25 million over four years. In January 2012, he's signed for $1.5 million and one year, with a chance to make another $3.4 million given health and success. I'm not saying that Iwakuma probably regrets not signing with the A's, because nobody should want to sign with the A's, but he just signed for 10% the guaranteed money.\n\nOf course, there's a pretty good reason for that. The 30-year-old Iwakuma missed significant time with a shoulder injury last season. He came back from it, and he's healthy now, but his velocity dropped, so there are more questions than there used to be. Salary + questions = reduced salary.\n\nEven with the injury, and possibly because of the injury, this looks like a heck of a deal for the Mariners. The worst-case scenario is that Iwakuma goes crazy and kills all of the team's good players. The realistic worst-case scenario is that Iwakuma is bad or hurt or both, and the M's are out $1.5 million. That's not much. If Iwakuma starts hitting his incentives, which begin at 20 starts and 140 innings, he's probably pitching well, and more than earning the money. This is practically all upside.\n\nAnd because it's a one-year contract, there's no future risk. That also means that Iwakuma could go somewhere else in 2013 if he's good, but he'd probably be open to re-signing with the Mariners if that's something the Mariners want to do. They'll cross that bridge several months from now.\n\nWe've talked a lot about Iwakuma lately. I don't need to re-hash it. It's hard to say whether he'll be good or bad or okay. His stuff could work, or his stuff could not work. But it's fun to consider the Hiroki Kuroda possibility, and it's just nice to see the Mariners making a Major League move. Welcome, Hisashi Iwakuma. Be awesome.\n\nStats"}, {"url": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2012/01/mariners-agree-to-sign-hisashi-iwakuma.html", "page_content": "10:57pm: Geoff Baker of The Seattle Times reports (on Twitter) that the incentives kick in at 20 starts, at which point Iwakuma will be paid a $200K bonus. He will make $250K for 22 starts, $300K for 25 starts, and $400K for 30 starts. The innings bonuses kick in at 140 IP, and he can earn another $400K for 200 IP.\n\nIwakuma spent four days in Seattle back in December according to Baker, during which time he met GM Jack Zduriencik and was shown around town. He didn't speak to Ichiro Suzuki before signing, says Baker (on Twitter).\n\n7:35pm: The Mariners have agreed to sign right-hander Hisashi Iwakuma to a one-year contract worth $1.5MM, reports ESPN's Jerry Crasnick (all Twitter links). The deal includes $3.4MM in incentives based on starts and innings pitched. We heard the two sides were closing in on a deal earlier this week. Iwakuma is a Sosnick-Cobbe client.\n\nThe Rakuten Golden Eagles posted the 30-year-old righty a year ago and the A's won the rights to negotiate with him for $19.1MM. However, the sides didn't work out a deal and Iwakuma re-signed with Rakuten. He posted a 2.42 ERA with 6.8 K/9 and 1.4 BB/9 in 119 innings in 2011 and became a true free agent after the season. He figures to join Felix Hernandez, Jason Vargas, and Michael Pineda in Seattle's rotation with Blake Beavan and Charlie Furbush as candidates for the fifth spot."}, {"url": "https://www.mlb.com/news/hisashi-iwakuma-signs-with-mariners-c262446820", "page_content": "Iwakuma wrote on his Instagram account that the Mariners offered him a contract early in his rehab process and he was grateful for the team's help in his recovery and the opportunity to return.\n\n\"I signed a Minor League deal until I recover well, but I will definitely come back and contribute to win for the Mariners,\" Iwakuma wrote. \"Me and my family love [the] Mariners and the city of Seattle, so we're happy to stay here!\"\n\nIn six seasons with Seattle, Iwakuma has a 63-39 record and 3.42 ERA in 150 games, including 136 starts. He was an American League All-Star in 2013, threw a no-hitter in '15 and was voted the Mariners' Pitcher of the Year by the Seattle chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America in '13 and '16.\n\nSince joining the Mariners in 2012, Iwakuma ranks fifth among qualified pitchers in the AL in fewest walks per nine innings (1.88), sixth in winning percentage (.618), eighth in ERA (3.42) and strikeout-to-walk ratio (3.86) and ninth in wins (63).\n\nIwakuma is seventh on the Mariners' all-time list in wins, eighth in strikeouts and quality starts and 12th in starts and innings pitched.\n\nThe Mariners are expected to add further pitching this winter, so there's not a lot of pressure on Iwakuma to return by the start of the season.

He slots into a Seattle rotation that's led by former Cy Young Award winner Felix Hernandez and also includes Michael Pineda and Jason Vargas.\n\nIwakuma attracted interest from seven or eight major league teams and received offers from five clubs -- with Oakland, Baltimore and Minnesota among his most active suitors. Cobbe said the pitcher received more than one multiyear offer and could have earned more money with other teams, but chose Seattle after developing a comfort level with the organization and the city during a visit in December.\n\nCobbe said Seattle general manager Jack Zduriencik and the team \"rolled out the red carpet\" for Iwakuma and showed him \"a lot of respect\" during his visit.\n\n\"This was Iwakuma's first time in the U.S., and he found the city of Seattle and the people there were a really strong fit for him and his family,\" Cobbe said.\n\nIwakuma joins 10-time All-Star and former American League MVP Ichiro Suzuki to give Seattle an added Japanese presence. Japanese infielder Munenori Kawasaki also says he's been invited to spring training by the Mariners.\n\nIwakuma, who played in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens and the 2009 World Baseball Classic, went 21-4 with a 1.87 ERA in 2008 and won the Eiji Sawamura Award, the Japanese equivalent of the Cy Young. But Iwakuma missed time with a shoulder injury this season and was 6-7 with a 2.42 ERA in 17 starts. After entering the free-agent market, Iwakuma decided to sign a one-year deal to re-establish his value in anticipation of 2013.\n\nThe Oakland Athletics paid a reported $19.1 million for the right to negotiate with Iwakuma last winter. But talks between the A's and Iwakuma's former agent, Don Nomura, broke down with no resolution, and the pitcher returned to Japan after the 30-day negotiating window expired.\n\nSince Iwakuma had reached 10 years of service time this winter, he wasn't subject to a posting fee like Nippon Ham Fighters pitcher Yu Darvish. The Texas Rangers recently bid more than $50 million for the negotiating rights to Darvish, and are working to sign him by Jan. 18. If the deadline passes with no agreement, the Rangers will get a refund and Darvish will return to Japan to pitch in 2012.\n\nJerry Crasnick is a senior writer for ESPN.com.

Wilson, Mark Buehrle, Japanese countryman Hiroki Kuroda of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Yu Darvish of Japan's Nippon Ham Fighters. Sabathia can become a free agent if he exercises an opt-out clause in his seven-year, $161 million contract with the New York Yankees this winter.\n\nIwakuma hired Paul Cobbe of Sosnick-Cobbe Sports as his new representative several months ago, but delayed the announcement out of respect for his community and the victims of the March earthquake and tsunami in Sendai, Japan, home of the Eagles. He had also been occupied until recently with rehabilitation from a shoulder injury that sent him to the disabled list in late May. Iwakuma recently rejoined Rakuten and his fastball was clocked at between 89 and 92 miles per hour in his last start.\n\nAlthough Iwakuma's decision will reverberate throughout Japan, Cobbe said the pitcher does not plan to address his professional future during the Golden Eagles' season.\n\n\"Iwakuma-san has instructed me not to discuss Major League Baseball with him during the 2011 season,\" Cobbe said. \"His sole focus is bringing a championship to Rakuten.\"\n\nIwakuma, 30, played in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens and the 2009 World Baseball Classic. In 2008 he won the Eiji Sawamura Award, the Japanese equivalent of the Cy Young Award.\n\nThe Oakland Athletics paid a reported $19.1 million posting fee to negotiate with Iwakuma last winter. But talks between the A's and Iwakuma's former agent, Don Nomura, broke down with no resolution, and the pitcher elected to return to Japan after the 30-day negotiating window expired. In early December, Nomura told reporters that the A's were insincere and \"never showed any respect\" to his client during the discussions.\n\nSince Iwakuma is currently in his 10th professional season in Japan, he will not be subject to a \"posting fee\" as a prelude to negotiations with a major league club. There are estimates that an MLB team will have to pay a posting fee in the $25 million-to-$50 million range to win the right to negotiate with Darvish this winter.\n\nSenior writer Jerry Crasnick covers Major League Baseball for ESPN.com."}, {"url": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2019/02/27/baseball/japanese-baseball/hisashi-iwakuma-throws-practice-first-time-since-returning-japan-giants/", "page_content": "Former major league pitcher Hisashi Iwakuma on Wednesday threw for the first time in practice since making his return to Japanese baseball with the Yomiuri Giants.\n\nThe 37-year-old right-hander tossed 45 pitches, testing out a variety of balls at the Giants\u2019 preseason camp in Okinawa.\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m just working out how much I can throw.

High School Horikoshi High School\n\nBR page\n\nBiographical Information [ edit ]\n\nHisashi Iwakuma has won the Sawamura Award and starred on the international stage and in the US. He is the son-in-law of Koju Hirohashi.\n\nIwakuma was the 5th-round pick of the Kintetsu Buffaloes in the 2000 NPB draft. Spending most of his rookie year in the minors, he joined the team's rotation in '02, going 8-7 with a 3.69 ERA. In 2003 Iwakuma established himself as Kintetsu's ace, going 15-10 with a 3.45 ERA. He was sixth in the Pacific League in ERA and fourth in wins despite playing on a fifth-place team. Iwakuma did even better in '04, with a 15-2, 3.01 season. He led the PL in wins, was second to Daisuke Matsuzaka in ERA and didn't suffer a defeat till after the All-Star Game (starting off the year 12-0). The rest of the Kintetsu staff went 46-68 during the year.\n\nIwakuma received even more fame after the 2004 season. When the Buffaloes announced a merger with the Orix Blue Wave, Kintetsu's ace said he would not play for the new team. The merged Orix Buffaloes selected him in a draft of the former Buffalo and Blue Wave players, but Iwakuma continued his refusals. The usually-docile players' union threw their weight behind Iwakuma and the Buffaloes relented, letting Iwakuma go to the expansion Rakuten Golden Eagles instead.\n\nIwakuma's first season with Rakuten paled statistically in comparison with his last Kintetsu season. He was clearly the ace of the new squad though - his 4.99 ERA was the best by a starter and his 9-15 record gave him more wins than the next two pitchers combined. He also threw half of the team's 18 complete games. Hisashi did not pitch much in 2006, going 1-2 with a 3.72 ERA in six games. Shoulder injuries and new rules about pitch deliveries limited his effectiveness and playing time.\n\nIwakuma went 5-5 with a 3.40 ERA in 2007. After his three ineffective seasons from 2005-2007, Iwakuma turned things around in a big way in 2008. He went 21-4 with a 1.87 ERA. He edged Yu Darvish by .01 for the PL lead in ERA, led the league in innings (201 2/3), was third with 159 strikeouts (trailing Toshiya Sugiuchi and Darvish) and tied for second with two shutouts. That earned him Pacific League MVP honors. He became just the third MVP in Nippon Pro Baseball history from a 5th-place team, following Hiromitsu Ochiai (1982) and Hiromitsu Kadota (1988. Iwakuma also won the Sawamura Award as the best pitcher in Japan. No one had won 21 games in a NPB season since Yoshinori Sato in 1985.\n\nIwakuma pitched for the Japanese national team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. He went 1-1 with a 1.35 ERA, allowing only 12 hits in 20 innings while striking out 15. He lost a 1-0 duel to Jung-keun Bong of South Korea, giving up a 4th-inning run on a walk to Jong-wook Lee and hits by Keun-woo Jeong and Tae-kyun Kim. He tossed a scoreless 7th inning in a win over Cuba. Iwakuma started the second game against Cuba, a make-or-break game; he tossed only 69 pitches in six shutout innings before Toshiya Sugiuchi completed the whitewash. It was the earliest Cuba had ever been eliminated from a major baseball tournament. Iwakuma then got the call from Tatsunori Hara to start the finale against South Korea. He allowed only one run in the first 7 innings (a homer by Shin-soo Choo) before giving up a second score in the 8th; he left with a 3-2 lead but Yu Darvish blew the save. Japan went on to win in the 10th. Iwakuma led the tournament in innings (20) and was second to Darvish in strikeouts. He made the All-Tournament team alongside fellow pitchers Daisuke Matsuzaka and Bong. Matsuzaka beat him out for MVP honors, but said that Iwakuma deserved them more.\n\nIwakuma fell to 13-6, 3.25 in 2009. He was 7th in the PL in ERA (between D.J. Houlton and Takayuki Kishi), tied for 5th in wins (with Kishi and Satoshi Nagai) and allowed a league-worst 179 hits. He rebounded a bit at 10-9, 2.82 in 2010, finishing 4th in ERA behind Darvish, Masaru Takeda and Masahiro Tanaka. He was 4th in innings (201), was 7th in losses, tied Chihiro Kaneko for second with 184 hits allowed (only Hideaki Wakui was worse), fanned 153 (7th-most) and had a 1.09 WHIP (4th after Darvish, Yoshihisa Naruse and Takeda).\n\nIwakuma with Seattle\n\nFollowing the 2010 season, Iwakuma's name was placed on the posting system by the Golden Eagles. The Oakland Athletics posted the highest bid to secure the right to negotiate a major league contract with him. Iwakuma turned down a 4-year, $15,250,000 offer from Oakland and opted to remain with Rakuten. He missed part of the season with a shoulder injury, being sidelined from May 18th to July 26th. He had been 3-2, 1.72 in 6 starts before the injury, and went 3-5, 2.87 after his return. He became a free agent after the season, and this time truly made the jump across the Pacific Ocean, signing with the Seattle Mariners. Surprisingly, he only agreed to a one-year contract worth $1.5 million, with potential performance bonuses of $3.4 million, much less than what he had turned down a year earlier. However, he explained that having a good relationship with a team - something he had not felt with Oakland - was more important than the money. He added that he and his family had taken an immediate liking to the city of Seattle and that he was looking forward to being a teammate of the great Ichiro Suzuki.\n\nIwakuma's time in the major leagues did not start off well. He pitched poorly during the Mariners' spring training in 2012, forcing the hand of manager Eric Wedge who announced he would not be part of the team's starting rotation to start the season. The plan was to use him in the bullpen to allow him to build back strength in his shoulder. Thus, he was on the M's special 28-man roster for their season-opening series against the Oakland Athletics in his native Japan, but in one of three spots designated as being ineligible to play during the Series, even though he made the trip across the Pacific Ocean. It took him until April 20th to make his debut, when he pitched four innings in relief of Hector Noesi and Erasmo Ramirez in a game against the Chicago White Sox. He was outstanding, only giving up a single hit during his stint; it was a solo homer by Adam Dunn, although it made little difference in the final 7-3 score in favor of the White Sox. He was the last player from all 30 teams' opening day rosters to make his season debut. He won his first game as a starter on July 30th, beating the Toronto Blue Jays, 4-1. In that game, he set a Mariners rookie record with 13 strikeouts, after surrendering a leadoff homer to Rajai Davis to start the game. He settled down nicely after that rough start, giving up no more runs in completing 8 innings, before turning the ball to Josh Kinney. He had been inserted in the starting rotation just before the All-Star break, but had had to fly back to Japan to be at the side of his ill father only a few days before. He ended the season with a record of 9-5, 3.16, in 30 games, with 16 starts, pitching 125 1/3 innings and striking out 101.\n\nIwakuma started the 2013 season as one of the best pitchers in the major leagues, placing his name among the ERA leaders from the start. He had a scoreless string of 23 2/3 innings in June, only broken by an unearned run allowed to the Houston Astros on June 10th, in a game he won, 3-2. That win improved his record to 7-1 and lowered his ERA to 1.79, trailing only Clay Buchholz's 1.71 at that point of the season. He finished the year at a very solid 14-6, 2.66 with a 1.01 WHIP and 185 K in 219 2/3 IP. He was chosen for the 2013 All-Star Game but did not play due to the Sunday starter rule; Chris Tillman replaced him. He finished among the 2013 AL leaders in ERA (3rd behind Anibal Sanchez and Bartolo Colon), wins (tied for 8th), WHIP (2nd to Max Scherzer), fewest hits per 9 IP (4th behind fellow ex-PL star Darvish, Scherzer and Justin Masterson), fewest walks per 9 (3rd behind David Price and Colon), innings (3rd behind James Shields and R.A. Dickey) and ERA+ (138, 6th, between Chris Sale and Shields). He was third in voting for the 2013 AL Cy Young Award, behind Scherzer and Darvish.\n\nPreparing for spring training in 2014, Iwakuma injured a finger while working out in southern California in January. He showed up in camp wearing a splint due to a strained tendon and had to lay off throwing for a month. The Mariners then announced that as a result, he would not be ready for the start of the season. As a result, he only made his first start on May 3rd, then had back-to-back starts of 8 innings without allowing a run in his second and third outings of the season. After a couple of games in which he was touched for 9 runs in 15 innings and suffered two losses, he bounced back with a gem on June 4th when he shut out the Atlanta Braves for seven innings, combining with two relievers for a 2-0 win. He ended the season with an excellent record of 15-9, 3.52 in 28 starts, and 154 Ks in 179 innings. He tied for 8th in the 2014 AL in wins, was 4th in WHIP (behind teammate Felix Hernandez, Sale and Garrett Richards), was second in walk rate (behind Phil Hughes) and was second in K:BB ratio (also behind Hughes).The Mariners were hoping to take a step forward in 2015 and were counting on Hisashi as one of the team's pillars, but after making only three starts in April, with a record of 0-1 and a 6.61 ERA, he went on the disabled list and was out until July 6th. he was roughed up in his first start back, allowing 5 runs in as many innings to the Detroit Tigers, increasing his ERA to 7.17, but then began pitching well after that. On August 12th, he threw a no-hitter against the Baltimore Orioles, allowing 3 walks and striking out 7, in what was the first complete game and shutout of his big league career. The Mariners won the game, 3-0, as he improved to 4-2 on the year and lowered his ERA to 3.86. He was the second Japanese-born pitcher to throw a no-hitter, after Hideo Nomo. He finished the season with a record of 9-5, 3.54 in 20 starts, logging 129 2/3 innings.\n\nIwakuma became a free agent after the 2015 season and was sought after by the Los Angeles Dodgers, who were looking to strengthen their starting rotation following the departure of co-ace Zack Greinke through free agency. The two sides came to a preliminary agreement on a three-year contract worth $45 million, but after two weeks of intense negotiations, they were unable to agree on the final details of the deal and the Mariners took advantage of the snag to scoop him up back into the fold, inking him on December 17th to a guaranteed one-year contract with two option years. So back he went to Seattle in 2016, but he started off slowly as by mid-May, he was only 1-4 with a 4.38 ERA in 8 starts. However, he won his last three starts of the month, then after going 2-2 in his first four June starts, began a tremendous streak on June 28th, when he beat the Pittsburgh Pirates, 5-2. Starting with that game, he won 7 of 8 starts, topped off with a 3-0 win over the Detroit Tigers on August 8th in which he tossed 7 shutout innings. The streak improved his record to 13-7 while lowering his ERA to 3.79. He ended the season at 16-12, 4.12.\n\nIn 2017, Iwakuma was set back by injuries and made only 6 starts, going 0-2, 4.35.

Beyond signing Iwakuma in 2012, the club successfully signed Ichiro Suzuki in \u201800 and Kikuchi in \u201819, and it was believed to be the runner-up for Shohei Ohtani in \u201917.\n\n\n\nIwakuma was among Japan\u2019s top pitchers before joining Seattle as an international free agent in 2012, having won the Pacific League MVP Award in \u201908. The right-hander retired from professional baseball in October after experiencing prolonged shoulder injuries, an issue that dated back to when he first signed with Seattle ahead of his age-31 season. His final appearances as a professional came for the Yomiuri Giants in '19.\n\n\n\nBut when healthy, Iwakuma was one of the Mariners\u2019 most effective pitchers over his six seasons in Seattle (2012-17), going 63-39 with a 3.42 ERA in 150 games, including 136 starts. The \u201813 All-Star\u2019s career ERA is tied for the lowest in club history (min. 500 innings) with Randy Johnson, Felix Hernandez and James Paxton. He was voted the most valuable Mariners pitcher in \u201913 and \u201916 by the Seattle chapter of the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America, and he was a finalist for the AL Cy Young Award in \u201913.\n\n\n\nIwakuma is most immortalized for throwing the fifth no-hitter in club history on Aug. 12, 2015, against Baltimore, when he joined Hideo Nomo as just the second Japanese-born pitcher to throw a no-no in the Majors.\",\"type\":\"text\"}],\"contentType\":\"news\",\"subHeadline\":null,\"summary\":\"SEATTLE -- The Mariners are bringing back a familiar face, as the club announced Tuesday that it has hired former pitcher Hisashi Iwakuma as a special assignment coach.

Iwakuma threw 16 strikes and induced four ground balls, one pop up and a fly out to center.\n\n\"It was a good game, my first game in a long time, so I wanted to get back in the groove and get a feel for every pitch,\" Iwakuma said through translator Antony Suzuki. \"I felt I was able to command every pitch on each corner, where I wanted to.

So far, it's been great.\"\n\nIwakuma is plenty familiar with the Rangers. He's 8-3 with a 3.43 ERA in 14 regular-season meetings with Texas over the past four years. And with Seattle opening at Texas in a three-game series from April 4-6 and then hosting the Rangers at Safeco Field a week later, he'll likely line up against them for his first two starts of the season.\n\n\"I look forward to the competition,\" he said. \"Hopefully I will throw two games in the first two weeks and I look forward to it.\""}]}
