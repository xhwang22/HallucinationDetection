{"Noel Anthony Hogan released two solo albums, The Sky Road (2009) and Ten Songs (2013).": [{"url": "https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/noel-hogan-cranberries-everybody-else-interview/", "page_content": "Cover: Courtesy of Island Def Jam Music Group\n\nWhen The Cranberries\u2019 debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We?, turned 25, in March 2018, it should have been a joyous occasion for all concerned. However, after the tragic death of vocalist Dolores O\u2019Riordan, on January 15, the mooted anniversary edition of their landmark record was put on hold while the band mourned the sudden and unexpected loss of their friend. Eventually, though, The Cranberries\u2019 instrumental trio \u2013 guitarist Noel Hogan, his bassist brother Mike and drummer Fergal Lawlor \u2013 made the unanimous decision to press ahead with the reissue of Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We?.\n\nListen to the super deluxe edition of Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We? now.\n\nFounding member Noel Hogan was Dolores O\u2019Riordan\u2019s songwriting partner in The Cranberries and, as he told us in an exclusive interview, their debut album still \u201cjust sounds like a great collection of songs.\u201d Yet, as he goes on to reveal, when the young Irish teenagers began learning their craft in Limerick, the idea that they could possibly experience mainstream success was beyond their comprehension.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis was around the time of The Joshua Tree, and U2 were just massive,\u201d Hogan says. \u201cIf you thought Irish rock music, you thought U2, but that was way out of our reach. Coming from a small town in the south of Ireland, we thought no further than forming a band and playing a local club in front of a few friends if ever we got good enough. Really, we would have been content with that.\u201d\n\nAs Hogan freely admits, he started the band with his brother and long-time school friend Lawlor \u201cwithout even knowing a chord.\u201d Yet the trio were galvanized by punk\u2019s DIY ethic and their collective love of classic English indie-pop acts such as The Cure and Echo & The Bunnymen. This led to The Cranberries\u2019 initial line-up: a much quirkier affair known as The Cranberry Saw Us featuring the Hogans, Lawlor and local singer-songwriter Niall Quinn. The latter\u2019s tenure was brief, but he later introduced the band to Dolores O\u2019Riordan: a friend of Quinn\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s sister and also a budding local singer-songwriter.\n\n\u201cThat day changed our lives\u201d\n\n\u201cWe played a few songs for her, then she sang Sinead O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u2018Troy\u2019 and a couple of songs she\u2019d written, and it was obvious she could sing, so that was it \u2013 she was in,\u201d Noel Hogan says, recalling the classic line-up\u2019s embryonic first rehearsal.\n\n\u201cI gave her a cassette with the music for \u2018Linger\u2019 on it,\u201d he adds, \u201cand a few days later, Dolores brought it back with all the words and the song that we now all know. That was the first song we wrote together. At the time, it was just another song and another day, but years later I realize how much that day changed our lives.\u201d\n\nThe Cranberries - Linger (Official Music Video)\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nHaving found the final piece of their puzzle with O\u2019Riordan, The Cranberries sporadically performed low-key local gigs and began looking for a deal when they had a set of songs in place. Hogan, for one, was determined the band would bypass the small and insular Irish club circuit and send their first demo direct to London.\n\nRemarkably, the tape immediately received a positive response from Rough Trade\u2019s Geoff Travis (later to become their manager). While they didn\u2019t sign to Travis\u2019 label, the enthusiastic response later set off a bidding war in London, with numerous major labels keen to sign the band.\n\nNoel Hogan elaborates: \u201cIsland were actually the last label to show an interest, but their A&R guy, Denny Cordell, was just completely different to the others. He was an English guy based in New York. He\u2019d produced [Procol Harum\u2019s] \u2018A Whiter Shade Of Pale,\u2019 he knew [Island boss] Chris Blackwell and the whole business inside out, but he was realistic too. Unlike the other labels, he didn\u2019t promise us the world. We just had a feeling about him and, thankfully, we were right. He died early, sadly, but he always believed in us and if it wasn\u2019t for Denny, we\u2019d never have taken off.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe perfect time and place\u201d\n\nAfter the initial album sessions at The Cranberries\u2019 demo studio in Limerick failed to work out, the band asked Island if they could work with Stephen Street. As his CV included engineering and production credits with The Smiths and on Morrissey\u2019s Viva Hate solo album, O\u2019Riordan and company were big fans, but they felt they were chancing their arm when they suggested hooking up with the much in-demand producer.\n\nAs it turned out, Street had already seen The Cranberries play at London\u2019s Marquee and immediately saw their potential. After an initial trial session which pleased all concerned, the producer \u2013 whose credits also include Blur and Kaiser Chiefs \u2013 signed up to man the console for the Everybody Else Is Doing It\u2026 sessions.\n\n\u201cWe more or less knew what we wanted, but not quite how to get it, and that\u2019s where Stephen comes in,\u201d Hogan reveals. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t completely change what you have, but he always wants to explore your ideas \u2013 he\u2019s great at fine-tuning your music and keeping you focused. You look forward going to the studio every day with Stephen and I think that\u2019s why we\u2019ve spent 30 years working with him. We\u2019ve the greatest respect for him.\u201d\n\nNoel Hogan remembers Everybody Else Is Doing It\u2026 as \u201cthe perfect time and place for us,\u201d and that everything slotted into place for them artistically. Yet, while the band felt they had a great debut under their belt, the initial response to the album was lukewarm.\n\nFearing that their time had come and gone, the band set off on tour, accepting a mismatched opening slot for The Hothouse Flowers. However, while they slogged around half-empty European concert halls, Noel Hogan and company were completely oblivious to what was happening across the Atlantic.\n\n\u201cWe were about a month into the European tour and we get a call out of the blue, requesting we come to the States,\u201d he remembers. \u201cDenny Cordell had been working on [the album\u2019s] first single, \u2018Linger,\u2019 in New York and it had become a hit on college radio, where it had gone to No.8. Suddenly, from thinking we were about to get dropped by Island, we went to play our first American gig in Denver, Colorado, opening for The The. We went onstage and everyone knew the songs and the place just went mental.\n\n\u201cOvernight, it literally went from us thinking our career was dead to this \u2013 and from then on, it went from strength to strength. MTV picked up on \u2018Linger\u2019 and put it on heavy rotation and off we went.\u201d\n\n\u201cSongs I honestly feel have stood the test of time\u201d\n\nWith a buzz building around the band, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We? went on to enjoy a remarkable second life in the UK and Europe. Underlining the quality of Dolores O\u2019Riordan\u2019s haunting, ethereal vocals, and the band\u2019s sophisticated melodicism, the album\u2019s signature tracks, \u201cLinger\u201d and \u201cDreams,\u201d both cracked the UK Top 30, with the album itself topping the British charts in the summer of 1994 and moving over six million copies worldwide.\n\nThe Cranberries - Dreams (Dir: Peter Scammell) (Official Music Video)\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nOn its own, the newly-remastered Everybody Else Is Doing Is, So Why Can\u2019t We? reminds us why its reputation as one of the key alt-rock albums of the 90s remains gloriously intact, but its new edition also offers a wealth of rare and previously unreleased material that paints a bigger picture.\n\nEarly demo recordings reveal how The Cranberries often reworked and honed their songs\u2019 arrangements, while their radio sessions for the BBC\u2019s John Peel and Irish DJ Dave Fanning are joined by valuable rarities including the eerie, Irish-language \u201c\u00cdosa\u201d and the first-ever demo recording of \u201cDreams\u201d: the latter mastered from a cassette Noel Hogan came upon in his garage completely by accident.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t listened to the album front to back in 20 years, so when I heard the remastered version at Abbey Road in February, I was genuinely shocked by how good it sounded,\u201d Noel Hogan confesses. \u201cIt was only about a month after Dolores\u2019 death, so hearing her voice was emotional, obviously, but even so, I was really surprised and delighted that four young kids from Limerick could produce an album with songs I honestly feel have stood the test of time.\u201d\n\nThis feature was first published in late 2018. We are re-publishing it today in celebration of the March 1, 1993, release of the album. The 25th-anniversary edition of Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We? is out now."}, {"url": "https://www.radioswisspop.ch/en/music-database/musician/11866c3ff06f93ee621a832303a51823bfcf6", "page_content": "Noel Anthony Hogan (born 25 December 1971) is an Irish musician and record producer best known as the lead guitarist and co-songwriter of the Irish rock band The Cranberries.\n\nThe Cranberries\n\nHogan formed the Cranberries with his brother Mike and drummer Fergal Lawler in 1989.
