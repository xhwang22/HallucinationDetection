His personal name was Xiong L\u00fc (Chinese: \u718a\u65c5; pinyin: Xi\u00f3ng L\u01da), his ancestral name was Mi (Chinese: \u8288; pinyin: M\u01d0), and his posthumous title was King Zhuang. He was one of the five rulers dubbed the Five Hegemons by Xunzi and attempted to wrest control of China from King Ding of Zhou.[1]\n\nKing of Chu\n\nQuick facts: Xiong L\u00fc \u718a\u65c5, Reign, Predecessor, Successor, D... \u25bc\n\n\"Wangzi Wu\" Bronze Ding.

According to a legend in the Records of the Grand Historian, for the first three years of his reign Zhuang wasted time in pleasure seeking, but, when challenged by two courtiers, reformed his ways.[2]\n\nThe king made Sunshu Ao his chancellor. Sunshu Ao began a series of major dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir in modern-day northern Anhui province.\n\nAfter some military successes, King Zhuang attempted to usurp King Ding of Zhou. According to a well-known story, probably an invention of the Warring States period, he asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the legendary Nine Tripod Cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China, but was rebuffed. This incident gave rise to the chengyu \"to enquire about ding in the central plains\", i.e. to have great ambitions (simplified Chinese: \u95ee\u9f0e\u4e2d\u539f; traditional Chinese: \u554f\u9f0e\u4e2d\u539f; pinyin: w\u00e8n d\u01d0ng zh\u014dngyu\u00e1n).[2]\n\nIn the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the State of Jin.

BCE) and was one of the so-called five hegemons (wuba \u4e94\u9738). His personal name was Mi Xiongl\u00fc \u8288\u718a\u4fb6 (also written \u718a\u5442 or \u718a\u65c5). The state of Chu is sometimes called Jing \u834a, and Xiongl\u00fc's posthumous title is also King Yan \u56b4\u738b.\n\nHe succeeded to the throne as son of King Mu \u695a\u7a46\u738b (r. 625-614). King Zhuang started his reign in a style of laissez-faire politics without much caring for the government. His advisors Wu Ju \u4f0d\u8209 and Su Cong \u8607\u5f9e opened him his eyes, so that he started restructuring the administration and strengthening the royal power with the support of Sunshu Ao \u5b6b\u53d4\u6556. The state took over the care for hydraulic works, dykes and dams, he built up a strong army and quelled the internal rebellion of a certain Ruo Ao \u82e5\u6556 (not King Ruo Ao, r. 791-764). His armies marched to the north, defeated the state of Song \u5b8b and the Rong \u620e barbarians of Luhun \u9678\u6e3e, and lined up before the domain of the king of Zhou \u5468.\n\nWith the awareness of his power King Zhuang of Chu menaced the King of Zhou and threatened him that Chu would be able to replace the house of Zhou. The armies of Chu then conquered a handfull of smaller states like Yong \u5eb8, Shu \u8212 and Chen \u9673, and in 602, King Zhuang was able to destroy the army of Jin \u6649 at Bi \u90b2 (modern Xingyang \u6ece\u967d, Henan). Chu thus came to replace Jin as the hegemonial power of the Central States.\n\nSource:\n\nCang Xiuliang \u5009\u4fee\u826f, ed. (1991).

Zhuangzi\u2019s foils were mainly credulous and dogmatic Confucian humanists, particularly the innate intuitionist absolutism of a type familiar from the Mencius. He also took his linguistic insights to undermine Mozi\u2019s pragmatic utilitarian alternative to Confucianism. He engaged seriously with later Mohist, realist, linguistic theories, both acknowledging their challenge to primitive quietism (the anti-language view familiar in The Laozi) and yet remaining skeptical of the realist conclusion. His most frequent co-discussant in the text was Hui Shi, a rival linguistic relativist.\n\nPhilosophically, Zhuangzi strikes us as more the Hume of his tradition than a system builder like Plato, Aristotle or Kant. He drew skeptical and relativist implications from a naturalist approach to normative guidance. His treatment of natural d\u00e0os focused on the norms governing correct use of language. His ethical relativism grew out of an indexical model of how natural conditions shape the norms governing the use of terms.\n\nThis wide range of views of Zhuangzi stem from the style of the text. Zhuangzi\u2019s prose style is its own distinctive literary treasure. The central feature is the parable, typified as a discussion between imaginary or real interlocutors. Typically short, pithy, and amusing, his tales are both accessible and philosophically seductive\u2014they both entertain and make you think. A respite from the dry moralizing of Confucians, the text was always a favorite of the Chinese intellectual, literati class. The Zhuangzi also attracts modern Western readers with its thoroughgoing naturalism, philosophical subtlety, and sophisticated humor, all set in a strikingly different conceptual scheme and its distant, exotic context.\n\nSix centuries later, elements of Zhuangzi\u2019s naturalism, along with themes found in the text attributed to Laozi helped shape Chan Buddhism (Japanese Zen)\u2014a distinctively Chinese, naturalist blend of Daoism and Buddhism with its emphasis on focused engagement in our everyday ways of life.\n\nZhuangzi (Chuang-tzu \u838a\u5b50 \u201cMaster Zhuang\u201d late 4th century BC ) is the pivotal figure in Classical Philosophical Daoism. The Zhuangzi is a compilation of his and others\u2019 writings at the pinnacle of the philosophically subtle Classical period in China (5th\u20133rd century BC ). The period was marked by humanist and naturalist reflections on normativity shaped by the metaphor of a d\u00e0o\u2014a social or a natural path. Traditional orthodoxy understood Zhuangzi as an anti-rational, credulous follower of a mystical Laozi. That traditional view dominated mainstream readings of the text. Recent archeological discoveries have largely laid that ancient orthodoxy to rest.\n\nZhuangzi flourished through the latter half of the 4th century BC roughly contemporary with Mencius, and the movement known as the School of Names (\u540d\u5bb6 ming-jia name school). Zhuangzi shows familiarity with Classical Chinese theories of pragmatic-semantics and makes his own theoretical contributions to it. The traditionally recognized figures in this school included Gongsun Long and Hui Shi\u2014Zhuangzi\u2019s close friend and most frequent direct philosophical discussant. With the recovery of the Later Mohist dialectical work detailing their theory of language, we find compelling evidence that the linguistic turn in Classical thinking was a widespread feature of this mature phase of the Classical period. The later Confucian thinker, Xunzi, follows Zhuangzi in reacting to and incorporating this linguistic turn in his thinking.\n\nMost of what we infer about Zhuangzi\u2019s life, we draw from evidence within the Zhuangzi, although the Han biographers did speculate about his place of origin (the state of Meng) his personal name (Zhou), and the official posts he held (minor in Qiyuan in his home state) and period he lived (during Prince Wei reign over Chu\u2014which ended about 327 BC ). Scholars have found it hard to confirm any details of his life from outside this text and from his being discussed by later thinkers. The text itself contains scattered stories about Zhuangzi, but given its frequent use of fantasy, even these we must season with the salt of textual skepticism. We attribute a large chunk of the extant text of the Zhuangzi to \u201cstudents of Zhuangzi\u201d but we have little hint of who his students were or if he even had students in any formal sense.\n\nA scholar working around 600 years later after the fall of the Han, Guo Xiang (d. 312), edited and reduced what he saw as a haphazardly accumulated cluster of apocryphal and possibly authentic texts. He concluded that many were added after the time Zhuangzi lived. Guo reports compressing that prior collection of writings from fifty-two chapters to thirty-three. This is the extant text on which our knowledge is based. Guo divided the chapters he had chosen into three sections: the \u201cInner Chapters\u201d (1\u20137), the \u201cOuter Chapters\u201d (8\u201322) and the \u201cMiscellaneous Chapters\u201d (23\u201333). He attributed only the first section to the period dating from Zhuangzi\u2019s lifetime\u2014hence possibly originating from Zhuangzi himself. The second grouping may have included writings of a \u201cSchool of Zhuangzi.\u201d Modern scholarship assigns various sources of other influences found in both the second \u201couter\u201d and final \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d chapters. Graham drawing on work of the Chinese theorist, Kuan Feng and followed with some variation by Liu Xiaogan and Harold Roth, divides these influences into roughly four variously named groups:\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s students or the School of Zhuangzi credited with those later writings committed most closely to the views expressed in the \u201cinner chapters.\u201d\n\nAuthors with egoist views associated with Yang Zhu (4th century BC ). The Mencius presented Yang\u2019s thought as a version of an ethical egoism that rejected conventional altruistic social d\u00e0os.\n\n). The Mencius presented Yang\u2019s thought as a version of an ethical egoism that rejected conventional altruistic social d\u00e0os. The third group Graham dubbed the \u2018primitivists\u2019. Primitivists share Yang Zhu\u2019s antipathy to social, historical or conventional d\u00e0os\u2014typically those supporting social norms extending beyond agricultural village life\u2014in favor of more natural ways. This group shares attitudes with the text of the Laozi (D\u00e0od\u00e9 Jing) mixed with Yangist themes.\n\nThe final group, dominated the \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d sections, Graham called them syncretists (eclectics) who seemingly attempted comprehensiveness by combining all points of view into a single complete d\u00e0o.\n\nHowever widely assumed, Zhuangzi\u2019s authorship of any of the \u201cinner\u201d chapters remains a speculative hypothesis. Guo\u2019s original assessment that Zhuangzi did not author any of the remaining sections remains conventional scholarly wisdom, but religious Daoists treat the entire book as a Canon\u2014The N\u00e1nh\u00faa Zhen-Jing.\n\nCombining all these elements into a single volume reflects a familiar Classical pattern of embellishing the teachings of a master, adapting the additions to the namesake\u2019s writing style and expanding on his themes and insights in distinctive ways. The four schools contributing to the extant text shared an emphasis on natural \u2013usually as opposed to social-cultural, d\u00e0os. Yangism or egoism largely rejected social or moral d\u00e0os on the apparent assumption that natural guiding d\u00e0os essentially recommend self-preserving behavior. Its paradigm is the anti-social hermit. Motivation by self-interest was normatively prior to any conventional d\u00e0o. They preserved their natural purity from social corruption by rejecting society\u2019s mores.\n\nPrimitivism similarly rejected social and conventionally moral d\u00e0os (mores), but has its own conception of a natural, pre-social, typically intuitive, way of life that supports rustic, agricultural, village life. It supports populist and anarchist political tendencies.\n\nSyncretism does not reject social d\u00e0os per se, but does reject any particular d\u00e0o as biased and narrow in contrast to a more, \u201crounded,\u201d idealized, or comprehensive d\u00e0o. This is often expressed in an ideal observer form (the sage, perfect human, or \u5929 tiannature:sky\u2019s d\u00e0o). These views tend toward epistemic supernaturalism\u2014claims to superlative cognitive or religious access to some transcendently correct d\u00e0o. Both tend to deny that their correct d\u00e0os can be expressed and transmitted in language or words.\n\nThe discussions in the \u201cInner Chapters,\u201d particularly in the 2nd chapter, by contrast, treat language as also natural and social-conventional d\u00e0os as themselves natural d\u00e0os. It undermines the otherwise presupposed contrast of natural vs. conventional d\u00e0os. Humans are naturally social animals and execute natural causal processes when their walking, speaking, writing, and other practices leave marks in nature, (like a trail or a text) which become physically accessible to later walkers as history (stored in memory, legend, writings, or footprints etc.).\n\nThe pivotal 2nd chapter draws relativist and skeptical conclusions from its normative naturalism. It rejects the religious traditionalism of Confucianism and the Gaia-hypothesis implicit in the Mohist attempt at utilitarian naturalism. Nature provides us with many ways to go, but does not favor or command our making any choices among them. Sh\u00ec-f\u0113i \u662f\u975e (This way not that) judgments are made by living creatures in nature, not by \u5929 ti\u0101nnature:sky itself. We can find guiding structures, d\u00e0os, in nature but not a favored or dictated d\u00e0o of nature.\n\nLike the later syncretist chapters, the \u201cInner Chapter\u201d Zhuangists accept that social d\u00e0os are continuous with natural ones, but they do not endorse any imagined or alleged, comprehensive judgments from everywhere, from all natural points of view. The cosmic judgement from nowhere is a non-judgment. Zhuangists are not committed to Laozi\u2019s conception of an exclusive choice of natural (\u5929 ti\u0101nsky:nature) over social (\u4eba renhuman) d\u00e0os. They are skeptical of any claim of special access to contextless guiding knowledge by alleged or self-styled sages, \u201cideal observers\u201d or perfect exemplars of epistemic virtues. They accept language but also accept our natural capacity and inclination to toy with it, alter it, and mould it to our use in various situations of practical choice.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s exemplars are butchers, musicians, cicada catchers, wheelmakers\u2014exemplars of mundane and focused action guidance. Each is an exemplar of one of the many ways of life (d\u00e0os) who execute their particular specialties in a highly cultivated, precise, smooth, and seemingly easily executed way. The imagined eclectic synthesis of all the various ways of life into some total-comprehensive d\u00e0o is no more than de-facto restatement of their co-existence in a single natural world as optional ways of life. The cosmos makes no judgment that they should exist\u2014though it combines them into a cosmic d\u00e0o that is the history of everything. That the cosmos has this outcome does not mean it makes a human-like choice which humans could or should execute. We are ill advised to strive for skill in everything.\n\nThe eclectics were probably the last community working with the text, adding to it and carrying it into later periods. The Laozi had become enmeshed with a ruler cult worship of The Yellow Emperor. Laozi became the far more influential figure during the entire Confucian orthodoxy of the Han (206\u2013220 BC ).\n\nThe wide range of views of Zhuangzi stem from the style of the text and the ways it has figured in China\u2019s intellectual history as well as the ways it was caught up in the modern interaction between China and the modern, scientific West.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s style is the philosophical parable, typically a brief discussion or exchange between two points of view. There is slight plurality of humans among the discussants joined by natural and imaginary creatures. Its fictional characters are usually cleverly named, some are Confucian icons (Confucius or his alleged teacher, Lao Dan). Some discussants are animals (real and fictional fish, birds, snakes), a talking skull, the wind, musicians, debaters, tigers, trainers, butchers, butterflies, burglars and the myriad \u201cpipes of nature.\u201d Expressive brevity and subtlety of detail enhances the impact of the often complex and elusive point of the parables\u2014they seldom explicitly formulate the moral or point explicitly. Most commonly, the author(s) end discussions in a doubting tone, a double rhetorical question or some pithy enigmatic parting shot. They may make their point by having the two parties walking away shaking their heads, agreeing only to disagree; both appreciating that they barely understand one another, and yet feeling that something has been learned from the exchange.\n\nTranslation into Western languages invites biases that are hard to avoid. The main effect is loss of the conceptual cohesion of the original, but the parables still engage our Western philosophical curiosity. We get the exhilaration of immersion in an independent philosophical tradition of comparable antiquity and richness. Readers in and out of China invariably suspect that the Zhuangzi\u2019s appealing style is infused with philosophical genius, even as they disagree about its philosophical upshot. Indeed, much of the Zhuangzi\u2019s philosophical appeal may stem from its seemingly deliberate open-ended texture, the interpretive malleability of its dialogues which invites, even perhaps requires, us to join the author(s) in their philosophical reflection.\n\nThis appeal stems only partly from the quality and sophistication of his episodes; each illuminated a patch of philosophical territory ending with a question for further pondering\u2014rather like Nietzsche or the Later Wittgenstein. Each exchange presents or illustrates shards of insight with open-textured conclusions\u2014all laced with Zhuangzi\u2019s obvious joy in exploring paradox\u2014particularly linguistic ones of the sort that appeal to analytic Western thinkers. Each is an expression of some natural, but perhaps inaccessible, alternative way of life. The frequent enigmatic conclusions \u201cthe answer is X\u201d leaves interpreters arguing centuries later, Fermat-like, how X can be an answer\u2014or what X is (e.g., \u201cfree and easy wandering,\u201d \u201cwalking two paths,\u201d \u201cgoblet words,\u201d \u201cclarity,\u201d and so forth). Each seems easily to fit into a range of puzzles familiar to thinkers in both traditions. One suspects that we find the correct interpretation by finding our way, like Wittgenstein\u2019s fly, out of some philosophical bottle. The correct philosophy coincides with the correct interpretation of Zhuangzi.\n\nThe traditional religious Zhuangzi narratives placed him as the disciple of Laozi, whom they regard as a quasi-divine founder of a mystical religion worshipping a mysterious entity translators tended to render as a definite descriptive term, but capitalized it as if it were a singular name, \u201cThe D\u00e0o.\u201d Compatible philosophical treatments were versions of metaphysical monism, epistemic intuitionism (often explicitly anti-rationalist), political anarchism and a vague normative absolutism\u2014follow The D\u00e0o. The bulk of popular and religious treatments still follow this interpretive line, treating Laozi as the earliest layer of \u201cDaoist mystical thought\u201d or \u201cLao-Zhuang\u201d thought and situating Zhuangzi as his \u201cfollower.\u201d\n\nThe story of the religious view of Zhuangzi starts a century after Zhuangzi lived (4th century BC ). Philosophical schools were closed, books burned and thought repressed during the superstitious Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC ) which followed the classical period. This initiated China\u2019s philosophical \u201cDark Age.\u201d The more orthodox Confucian Han Dynasty (206 BC to 220) followed. Over two decades (109\u201391 BC ) the Han emperor\u2019s hereditary Grand Historians, Sima Tan and Sima Qian (a father and son team), wrote an official history from the mythical Yellow Emperor (c. 3rd Millennium BC ) to the Han. It is in this account that the classification of thinkers into three concept schools, Daoist, Legalist, and School of Names first occurs. Graham speculates that the assumption of an affiliation of Zhuangzi to Laozi may have originated from the Outer Chapters. There Zhuangzi\u2019s students used the mythical teacher of Confucius, Lao Dan or Laozi, to ridicule Confucius in a cycle of dialogues.\n\nA cult of Huang-Lao, worshipping the Yellow emperor and Laozi as divinities, had grown up in the Qin. The father and son historians were students of Huang-Lao masters. At the fall of the Han the narrative of Zhuangzi as a follower/elaborator of a semi-divine Laozi was well entrenched. The post-Han resurgence, known as Neo-Daoism, began with the editing of the received edition of, first, the Laozi (Wang Bi 226\u2013249) then the Zhuangzi (Guo Xiang d. 312 see above). Neo-Daoist discussion practices and ideas were influential in bringing Buddhist and Chinese thought into interaction and Daoism became enmeshed with Buddhism in the popular view (especially with Chinese Chan Buddhism). A Daoist \u201creligion\u201d, borrowing models of religious institutions from Buddhism (monasteries, monks and nuns) influenced discourse about Daoism throughout the period of Buddhist domination of the Chinese intellectual world (achieved gradually during the Six Dynasties period 220\u2013589 and extending through the Tang 618\u2013907). Neo-Confucians from the medieval period on treated Buddhism and Daoism as essentially similar religions.\n\nModern text theory concerning the Zhuangzi grows from two recent discoveries.\n\nThe reconstruction of the Later Mohist dialectical works and Archeological reconstructions of the text of the Daode Jing.\n\nThe following section discusses their twin impact on our view of Zhuangzi.\n\nDevelopments at the end of the 19th and early 20th century in China led Chinese intellectuals to adopt the European concept of philosophy (\u54f2\u5b78) with its implicit distinction from religion. This distinction was seen as pivoting on logic\u2014the theory of proof or argument. They started to segregate their own writings which seemed most like argument, inference and logic from those sustained mainly by credulity and tradition. They began to sort out the philosophical aspects of their traditional thought from its more religious and superstitious elements. Sun Yirang\u2019s (1848\u20131908) 1897 reconstruction of the Mohist Canon provided convincing evidence that analytically inspired and rigorous thinking had grown up in Classical China. This example encouraged 19th century intellectuals like Yan Fu (1854\u20131921) and Liang Qichao (1873\u20131929). They started to emphasize the ancient schools that more clearly related to the logical paradigms of Western philosophy and Mohist analytics. Hu Shih (1891\u20131962) continued this tradition of reconceiving and re-centering Chinese thought away from the Confucian scholasticism that had dominated since the decline of Buddhism.\n\nThe early 20th century logic-inspired reformation recently began to influence the interpretation of the Zhuangzi and the Xunzi in the west, largely inspired by Angus Graham who had observed that both ancient texts demonstrated a mastery of the technical vocabulary of Mohist linguistic theory.\n\nModern philosophical appreciation of the Zhuangzi, probably stems from Graham\u2019s 1969 \u201c[Zhuangzi]\u2019s Essay on Seeing Things as Equal\u201d (Graham 1969, predating his work on Mohism). Wryly replying to Wang Fuzhi\u2019s speculation that Shen Dao, not Zhuangzi had authored the beloved chapter, Graham averred that whoever wrote that philosophically rich text is the person we would want to think of as Zhuangzi. Graham proposed looking at the text\u2019s seemingly conflicting thoughts as analogous to the \u201cinner dialogue\u201d of a reflective thinker who formulates a view, considers then rejects it. Graham also noted the writer\u2019s deep involvement and apparent fluency in the technical language and obscure issues arising in Classical Chinese theories of language which he then only beginning to study.\n\nGraham\u2019s outlook conflicted overtly with a traditional Chinese narrative of a disciple Zhuangzi following a semi-divine Laozi in worship of The Mystical Dao. Zhuangzi, Graham quipped, didn\u2019t know he was a Daoist. Graham later argued that the internal evidence suggested Zhuangzi had never seen the text of the Laozi (The D\u00e0o D\u00e9 Jing) and probably thought of Lao Dan as a Confucian. Most interpretive disputes are, to a greater or lesser degree, a result of the tension between Graham\u2019s textual arguments and the traditional Historian\u2019s picture of Zhuangzi as a religious mystical Daoist follower of the semi-divine Laozi, similarly worshipping \u201cThe D\u00e0o.\u201d\n\nGraham\u2019s textual arguments were indirectly supported by archeological discoveries of different Laozi texts. The discoveries in the early 1970s and 1990s together implied a relatively late date for the emergence of the Laozi text\u2014probably some years after Zhuangzi had lived and perhaps overlapping the composition of a series of dialogues between Laozi and Confucius in the \u201cOuter Chapters\u201d section. Graham speculated that Zhuangzi\u2019s students, who were writing the cycle of Laozi-Confucius dialogues, may have rhetorically chosen to use the legendary Lao Dan (mythical teacher of Confucius) to give him authority to lecture and ridicule the revered master.\n\nWhen we abandon the traditional identification of Zhuangzi as a Laozi follower, it opens the door for speculation about his relation to the relativist, linguistic theorist, Hui Shi, traditionally treated as belonging to the School of Names. Christoph Harbesmeier speculated he may have been either Zhuangzi\u2019s teacher, mentor or fellow student. If he was a teacher, he came to accept his student as an equal or even superior. Zhuangzi portrays him as playing a role in Zhuangzi\u2019s philosophical skill development as an intimate philosophical interlocutor and eventually as a foil for sharpening his analysis. Among those texts that concentrate on \u540d m\u00edngnames, Hui Shi\u2019s ten theses mark him as a relativist response to Mohist realism on the relation of names and \u201cstuff\u201d\u2014focusing especially on comparative and indexical terms.\n\nWe can read Zhuangzi\u2019s relativism, accordingly as an alternative, arguably more reflectively subtle, indexical relativism about \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments regarding choices of paths (d\u00e0os) of correct use of names/words/concepts as guideposts to our \u884c x\u00edngwalking:behavior. This can both explain Zhuangzi\u2019s relativist direction of analysis and his recognition of sound Mohist/realist responses to Hui Shi\u2019s version of that relativist direction of thought. This article develops and expands on Graham\u2019s philosophical interpretation and emphasizes this relation to Hui Shi rather than to Laozi.\n\nBetween the traditional, piously mystical Daoist religious interpretation and that view\u2019s nearest philosophical neighbors, lies the bulk of the interpretive historical and religious literature. Given the philosophically oriented venue of this article, what follows should not be treated as ecumenical.\n\nConfucian d\u00e0os were broadly humanist. The earliest version (Confucius 551\u2013479 BC ) traced normativity to earlier human invention. Metaphorical trails are left by past human walkings, i.e. social practices. Language was an example of such an invented social practice which intertwined with routine activities (rituals) to yield the correct, sage-king inspired way of life\u2014the social \u9053 d\u00e0opath. A later version (Mencius 372\u2013239 BC ) focused on natural human psychology. The correct path is that to which our natural moral psychology inclines us. Humans have a \u5fc3 x\u012bnheart-mind that is naturally shangood-at normative choice and practice.\n\nMencius may have been reacting to Mohism. Mozi (470\u2013391 BC ) had earlier initiated a shift in focus to more natural and objective, less culturally relative way of grounding normative judgment. His claim that \u5929 ti\u0101nnature:sky exhibited a tendency to a course leading to human utility or well-being. So humans should use that natural norm, the \u8faf bi\u00e0ndistinction between \u5229\u5bb3 l\u00ec-h\u00e0i benefit-harm in constructing our social d\u00e0o, including the norms of language.\n\nCorrectly using terms is using them to mark the path of cooperative behaviors that lead to general human benefit\u2014a social \u9053 d\u00e0opath utilitarianism, rather than a law or rule version. Nature intends us to follow its natural structures in ways that lead to universal human \u5229 l\u00ecbenefit. Ethical questions thus have a single correct answer in an ideally engineered and shared normative linguistic practice. Mohist utilitarian metaethics pointed to natural realism.\n\nDaoist primitivism (symbolized by the mythical Laozi and the anonymous text known as the D\u00e0od\u00e9 Jing) was, as noted above, a further trend toward a broader ethical naturalism with anti-language absolutist implications. We should forget or ignore all social norms and practices, including linguistic ones. Utility (perhaps egoistic utility) does motivate our behavior as naturally as water follows the paths created by natural contours of earth. Language should not interfere in any way with this natural guiding interaction between us and the course(es) of nature.\n\nUnderstanding the Zhuangzi is made more difficult by the huge differences not only in the philosophical context, but in the pervasive metaphors that structure and focus discussions of norms of behavior in the Chinese vs Indo-European classical traditions. His positions invite comparisons with modern metaethical naturalism but he does not focus them with concepts linked to grammatical sentences such as \u201claws\u201d or \u201crules\u201d (sentences in all form) or \u201cfacts\u201d (sentence-sized chunks of reality) or \u201cproperties (realities corresponding to sentence predicates).\u201d Zhuangzi used the traditional \u9053 d\u00e0opath metaphor together with the technical terminology developed in Mohism of sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that, bi\u00e0ndistinction and k\u011bpermissible.\n\nThe metaphor shaping most Chinese discussions of pragmatic knowing, choice and behavior was d\u00e0o\u2014a path or trail. Questions we would phrase in terms of moral propositions, laws, or principles are questions about finding, choosing and following d\u00e0os, paths or ways. D\u00e0os can be social or natural structures that guide us in answering practical questions: what to do or how to do it. As the focus of warring Chinese conceptions of guidance, d\u00e0o guidance has three phases. We must find or notice them, choose one from among those we notice, and then follow or interpret the selected d\u00e0o in \u884c x\u00edngwalking:behavior. We \u8faf bi\u00e0ndistinguish, discover and recognize them; choose or approve (sh\u00ecthis:right) them or reject (f\u0113inot-that:wrong ) them, and treat them as k\u011bpermissible or not. Our capacity to engage in these three processes governing natural guiding structures, d\u00e0os, is an internal d\u00e0o\u2014our \u5fb7 d\u00e9virtuosity. Our \u5fb7 d\u00e9virtuosity at interacting with the web of d\u00e0os reads and interprets the path-marks thus generating our \u884c x\u00edngwalking:behavior.\n\nThe d\u00e0o metaphor corresponds closely with the Western translation metaphor of \u2018a way\u2019 which, while ubiquitous in philosophical discourse, is rarely a central focus of philosophical analysis of normativity. The salient differences between the two traditions accounts of behavior are that the Chinese does not focus on sentential items (actions, events, beliefs) particularly as conclusions of belief plus desire mental arguments. Instead, it focuses on the interplay of natural processes grounded in the temporally shifting distributions of \u6c23 qiphysical stuff that yields path-like guidance structures for living things.\n\nConfucians and Mohists had their own theories of the both the right d\u00e0os and the right \u5fb7 d\u00e9virtuosity to use together in guiding behavior. Confucian d\u00e0os tended to be those enshrined in past practice and their version of \u5fb7 d\u00e9virtuosity tended toward the intuitive, typically appealing to \u4ec1 r\u00e9nhumanity.\n\nMohists advocated guiding reform of conventional social d\u00e0os using a natural normative \u8faf bi\u00e0ndistinction of \u5229\u5bb3 l\u00ec-h\u00e0ibenefit-harm. For Mohists, \u5229\u5bb3 l\u00ec-h\u00e0ibenefit-harm was a \u5929 ti\u0101nnatural way of finding, choosing, reforming and interpreting social d\u00e0os. In contrast to Confucians, Mohists sought to elaborate their natural ways of selecting d\u00e0o-like social practices as operational, objective, measurement-like processes accessible to ordinary people and not subject to training and indoctrination.\n\nChinese linguistic analysis folded naturally into similar language\u2014it concerns ways of using words\u2014d\u00e0os (norms) of linguistic behavior focused on word use. The more philosophically inclined schools began to see such norms of the use of words as underlying the explicit disagreements among schools about which norms or d\u00e0os to follow and how to follow them.\n\nThe discussion of norms of use are typically couched in behavioral formulations such as \u53d6 q\u01d4choose, \u8209 j\u01d4 pick-out \u53ef k\u011bassertible:admissible \u8faf bi\u00e0ndistinction \u6307 zh\u01d0point and h\u00e9combine. The core psychological attitude is \u70ba w\u00e9ideem:do which may be expressed as a tendency (in speech, both inner and expressed) to express a \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgment regarding the use of a word. A phonetically and semantically related tendency is \u8b02 w\u00e8icalling it by the term. Behaviorally, it amounts to dealing with it under that word-concept. Conversely we can sh\u00ec or f\u0113i the use of a name of some contextual object\u2014w\u00e8icall it or w\u00e9ideem it properly associated with that \u540d m\u00edngname.\n\nTo \u70ba w\u00e9ideem:do can be either to express the category assignment in one\u2019s behavior\u2014either speech-behavior or behaving toward the object as people would be expected to, given that they assigned the object to that category. The behavior for the category would be found in the social or natural d\u00e0opath they follow. A \u70ba w\u00e9ideem:do state is less a mental picture of a fact (a belief) than a disposition to treat or identify some object as deserving the term in question. Instead of the western reality vs. appearance dialectic, Chinese discussion revolves around the contrast of natural (\u5929 ti\u0101nnature:sky) d\u00e0os and human (\u4eba r\u00e9nhuman) or socially constructed, d\u00e0os. The human d\u00e0os are constructed with the help of \u540d m\u00edngnames strung together into \u8a00 y\u00e1nlanguage.\n\nMozi, as we noted above, appealed to what he regarded as a natural utility standard to judge the acceptability of y\u00e1nlanguage use and Confucius relied more on past usage ranging back to the mythical sage kings. Problems of justifying approvals and disapprovals of word usage led such later Confucians as Mencius, to rely more on cultivating an intuition. Since the account of cultivation typically presupposed practice in conformity with the social practice requiring justification, the threat of circularity pushed traditionalists eventually to teach about and appeal to an allegedly innate or pre-social human psychology.\n\nBy contrast, the craft\u2013inspired Mohists went on to emphasize the use of measurement tools and operations as the standards guiding term use. They argued that such operational standards would be more accessible to ordinary people who could rely only on their \u201ceyes and ears.\u201d The Confucians, by contrast, were forced to flip between appealing to some cultivated authority and attributing an innate moral inclination to the existing conventional language d\u00e0o to such ordinary people.\n\n\u662f\u975e Sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments can concern choice of a d\u00e0o or the interpretive performances of a chosen d\u00e0o. Chinese writers similarly focused on \u53ef k\u011bassertible:permissible which may be said of a d\u00e0o, or of a permissible walking of some d\u00e0o\u2014including those of language use. Disagreement could be at the level of d\u00e0os, or at the interpretive level\u2014endorsing or rejecting a \u70ba w\u00e9ideem:do. The endorsing-rejecting \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that and \u53ef k\u011bpermissible behaviors themselves involve either choosing or interpreting d\u00e0os. Each time we make any of these judgments we contribute to further constructing our socially shared d\u00e0o with its implied practices of \u540d m\u00edngnames use.\n\nZhuangzi conforms to the general pre-Han model, using a path metaphor to discuss normativity in general. This fuels the traditional view of him as a Daoist. Most of his discussion, moreover, further conforms to the practice of focusing on social d\u00e0os\u2014undermining treatment as religious disciple of Laozi\u2019s insistence we follow only \u5929 ti\u0101nnatural d\u00e0os. What links him to a naturalist theme is his reluctance to draw the usual contrast between natural and social d\u00e0os. (Is it nature? Is it man?). Human social d\u00e0os are natural behaviors of natural animals. This grounds Zhuangzi\u2019s pattern of talking about and with other equally natural creatures.\n\nHumans are as natural as monkeys, birds, and fish. \u201cHow can d\u00e0os be hidden such that there are authentic and artificial?\u201d he asks rhetorically? (Harvard Yenching Zhuangzi Yinde hereafter HY 4/2/24\u20135) All the different social traditions expand the number and kinds of naturally existing d\u00e0os. Other animals\u2019 walking patterns also construct natural d\u00e0os which, similarly, become available for human finding, choosing and walking.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s discussion, particularly in the philosophically most sophisticated second chapter, is mainly about the plurality and relativity of second-level d\u00e0os, our naturally endowed, internal d\u00e0osways of finding, choosing and following one of many natural ways of life in the maze or network presented by nature. This stance makes the complexity of the natural network only the first level of variety and possibility. Recursion of d\u00e0os explodes the complexity. A tripartite recursion follows because there are many d\u00e0os of finding, of choosing, and of translating the first level plethora. The many layered complexity of d\u00e0os of d\u00e0os yields the human sphere of life. \u201cFish interact in water; humans interact in d\u00e0os\u201d (Ibid., HY 18/6/72)\n\nHe naturalizes d\u00e0os less by attending to natural physical guiding structures (e.g. d\u00e0os of water) than to the variety of human d\u00e0os presented by analogy to the variety of creatures with different d\u00e0os. Alternately, he encourages us not to assume we have found all the available ways to behave or he reflects on the variety of sources of d\u00e0os of choice or of different capacities to catch on and follow within us\u2014our different natural organs and the range of different ways we may train or habituate them. This complexity of d\u00e0o structures fuels, in turn, both his skepticism of absolutes, of authority, of ideal observers, of social dogmas and his qualified advice to leave the finding, choice and interpretation to a working out from the variety of perspectives that make up the behaving units in the particular circumstance. D\u00e0o choices are best made from the perspective of walkers.(Ibid., HY 4/2/33)\n\nThe other distinctive feature of Zhuangzi\u2019s approach lies in the sophistication of his handling the issues of language in explicating this natural complexity of d\u00e0os. Graham interpreted a famous Zhuangzi trope (the pipes of \u5929 ti\u0101nnature:sky) as Zhuangzi\u2019s way of positioning language as ti\u0101n (natural) sound.\n\nThe pipes of earth, these are the hollows everywhere; the pipes of men, these are rows of tubes. Tell me about the pipes of Heaven.\u2019 Who is it that blows the ten thousand disputing voices, who when of themselves they stop their talk has sealed them, and puffs out of them the opinions that they choose for themselves?\u2019 HY 3/2/4\u20139\n\nGraham elaborates:\n\nThese are apparently the holes in the heart through which thought courses and the mouths which utter it, so that the breath blown by heaven through the inner formations of different men issues in contradictory utterances. (Graham 1969:149)\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s Daoism, thus, starts by removing ti\u0101nconstant nature from its role as ultimate normative authority\u2014the role it played in virtually all the rival accounts of which d\u00e0o we should follow. All d\u00e0os that are practically available at the point of choice for walking (actually existing d\u00e0os) are similarly ti\u0101n. Ti\u0101n (nature) generates d\u00e0os as it generates the \u7269 w\u00f9thing-kinds (humans and other animals) that find and follow them. Neither it nor the cosmos can play the role of an authority, far less of an anthropomorphic authority commanding or dictating our choice among the network of naturally existing d\u00e0os. D\u00e0os are chosen from those found in nature, but none represents nature\u2019s choice for us\u2014none of the d\u00e0os in nature is the d\u00e0o of nature.\n\nDialectically, Zhuangzi\u2019s replacement for ti\u0101n\u2019s role as source of normative guidance would be the entire complex network of d\u00e0o structures that permeate the natural world. He situates us at indexed points in this network seeking paths forward from here and now, choosing from among the plethora of those accessible which, if any, to follow.\n\nThe philosophical advantage of Zhuangzi\u2019s way of discussing d\u00e0os, thus, does not leave him suggesting that what is natural is moral (analogous to implying \u201cought\u201d from \u201cis\u201d). Nature gives us a complex network of iterative guiding structures among which we are about to swim. In our waking hours, we continue constructing systems of contending, resolving and agreeing on \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments\u2014the rejected ones buried in rubble of ongoing construction of normative language marking behavioral paths. (HY 3/2/11\u201313)\n\nWe recognize greater and lesser models of both\u2014the more reflective and engaging vs. a lazier, more wordy type. As we walk through a day, we encounter attitudinal states\u2014joy, sorrow, surprise, ennui etc. We don\u2019t know what role these play but they seem central to our choosing activity\u2014indeed to our having a perspective, an \u2018I\u2019. (HY 3/2/11\u201314)\n\nWhen we describe that entire structure, e.g. as resembling a natural network of links (d\u00e0os) between temporally and spatially indexed points we can see how it might generate talk of a single cosmic dao. All guidance is at a point in the network and available to and for some emergent object\u2014physical, living, animal or human. The inner processes of seeking, choosing, and following d\u00e0os from node to node are themselves part of the natural network. We are not sure what the normative point of our natural reactions in walking through the nature\u2019s maze. Each step or utterance adds a \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that to the edifice of guiding discourse marking paths for ourselves and for others. It\u2019s as if there is some natural authority guiding the construction process, though we can\u2019t see marks of its authority. We can reliably walk paths or d\u00e0os but can't see the shape of the authority. We light on paths and react with heart-mind responses. That\u2019s it. (Ibid., HY 4/2/14\u201316)\n\nHuman d\u00e0os of finding, choosing and following are capacities normally attributed to the \u5fc3 x\u012bnheart-mind. Zhuangzi recognizes its involvement in the construction process, but is skeptical of making it a kind of natural authority. It is, after all, only one of the natural organs involved\u2014our daily reactions include being directed by our stomachs, our eyes, etc. Why, Zhuangzi wonders, should we think they need a single authority? (HY 4/2/14\u201316)\n\nEven, then, if we take the \u5fc3 x\u012bnheart-mind as an authority, it\u2019s not clear how it can help us deal with the role of judgments of greater and lesser wisdom and different ways of using \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that. Aren\u2019t all the hearts involved in the evolving construction equally natural\u2014the sages and the fools? (HY 4/2/21\u201322)\n\nAny output from our \u5fc3 x\u012bnheart-mind into this construction of a d\u00e0o to follow from here is itself a product of our having walked one of a range of possible d\u00e0os to this point. (HY 4/2/20)\n\n\u201cTo get a \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that from the \u5fc3 x\u012bnheart-mind without it\u2019s having been constructed there is like going to Yue today and arriving yesterday, like getting something from nothing.\u201d Even the wisest of mythical sages (Yao) can\u2019t know how to do that! (Ibid., HY 4/2/22\u201323)\n\nThere are many natural ways of finding and choosing ways. Humans naturally exhibit variety in how they find or choose a course of behavior. This recursive complex of d\u00e0os of choosing is part of nature. No single one need be considered the d\u00e0o of nature to the exclusion of others. They may be capacities of individuals or of social groups, embodied in their social practices. The gestalt set of past commitments and acquired inclinations to choose and interpret paths is another component of our situation or location in a complex web of d\u00e0os. The given d\u00e0os of choice are what Zhuangzi treats as \u6210 ch\u00e9ngconstructed/mature within our body as we traverse the nodes of the network of d\u00e0os. Our heart-minds reach an indexed point with a given momentum vector\u2014a speed on an existing trajectory\u2014this is our a point of view or perspective, complete with prior commitments to d\u00e0osways of appreciating and selecting among available paths.\n\nThese second-level d\u00e0os can also be chosen and walked correctly or incorrectly. Choosing an epistemic d\u00e0o, in turn, depends on other a practically available d\u00e0os for guiding that meta-choice\u2026 and so on. Zhuangzi does not view it as a rational or logical construction, but a complicated, multi-layered natural one. He speaks of \u201ceight \u5fb7 d\u00e9virtuosities\u201d involved in constructing d\u00e0os and guiding expressions, starting with the indexical locatives, left and right, then human relations, then mores, divisions (categories?), distinctions (disputes), competition and then strife. (HY 5/2/55\u20136)\n\nA similar recursion concerns d\u00e0os of finding and interpreting d\u00e0os. This network of recursive natural guidance structures constitutes the complex network of natural d\u00e0o. We rely on meta-d\u00e0os, practically available links in this network, in choosing and in interpreting practically available ground-level d\u00e0os. Humans navigate in a sea of d\u00e0os.\n\nThen who or what does the choosing? Zhuangzi\u2019s theory here is similarly detached and natural. He focuses less on the consciousness or subjectivity of some mental substance or cognitive self or agent, but on a grammatical locus of judgment, a \u6211 w\u01d2I:me within the linguistic d\u00e0o structure\u2014the grammatical indexical marks a choosing point in the conceptual and space-time structure. Like Hume\u2019s self, without the naturally occurring grab-bag of attitudes, it would not be there to play its choosing role. The \u6211 w\u01d2I:me is situated in a frame of reference with its own complicated \u6210 ch\u00e9ngcommitment trajectory in the iterative d\u00e0os of choice. The w\u01d2I:me that knows-how is situated in existing commitments embedded in an indexed here-now in the network of ways it will assign to sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that. Each sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that it \u201cshoots out\u201d further commits it to a path. (The narrator had introduced the above \u201cpipes of heaven\u201d metaphor to describe a gestalt he describes as having \u201csaid farewell to my w\u01d2I:me.\u201d)\n\n\u201cIts eruptions are like a repeating crossbow\u201d expresses how it manages \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments. \u201cIts resting on them like an oath or treaty\u201d expresses how it clings to past winners, \u201cits death is like autumn and winter\u201d expresses how it daily declines, a weakening brought about by this (the weight of accumulated commitments?) and it cannot start the process over. \u201cIts rejections are like tightening bonds\u201d puts into language these aging channels. As the x\u012bnheart-mind nears death, nothing can restore its dynamism. (HY 3/2/11\u201313) Joy, anger, sadness, pleasure, worrying, sighing, resisting, clinging, being drawn to, eschewing, launching, and committing, like music from empty holes, dampness generating mushrooms, these day and night replace each other before us and yet none can know from what they emerge. Let it be! Let it be! They come from where they emerge\u2014without these, there would be no \u6211 w\u01d2I:me and without a w\u01d2I:me there would be no choosing. (HY 3/2/13\u201314)\n\nFor Zhuangzi, the issue is not mind or consciousness, but the behavioral inclinations and the normative authority of these roving indexical perspectives scattered within the natural d\u00e0o network. Their choices of which d\u00e0os to walk furthers the construction ( \u6210 ch\u00e9ngfixing) of our perspective for the next choice.\n\nIt seems as if there is a natural authority, but we cannot find its authoritative source. There is sufficient reliability that this is walkable, but we don\u2019t see it\u2019s [authorizing?] shape\u2014it has natural reality but no visible shape. (HY4/2/15\u201316)\n\nThe first level paths have a shape, but the d\u00e0os of correct choice and performance are inside the performer and not plainly visible.\n\nThe trend from social construction humanism toward naturalism had been gradual. Mozi\u2019s argument for basing such constructions on a natural distinction of benefit and harm was an early step. Graham had separately theorized that Mencius developed both his response to Mozi and his account of the role of \u4ec1 r\u00e9nhumanity as arguments that Confucian ritual behavior had evolved from ti\u0101nnatural intuitive response patterns in the \u5fc3 x\u012bnheart-mind. This implicitly endorsed Mozi\u2019s reliance on a ti\u0101nnatural ground for the social construction of morality.\n\nGraham\u2019s Zhuangzi then addressed this Mencian response in a passage that extends the Hume-like skepticism about any identifiable \u201cinner self\u201d. That should be what guides the naturally occurring emotive reactions that are necessary for a w\u01d2I:me that chooses. It seems, he says, there must be one, but we find no evidence of it. We approve of behaviors and place our trust in its reactions but find no sign of what is authorizing or making them.\n\nHundreds of parts, nine openings and six viscera included and completed (\u6210 ch\u00e9ngfixed) in place in us, with which should I feel most akin? Should I be pleased with them all? Is there a w\u01d2I:me among them? Among them, should we deem some as rulers and as servants? Are the rulers and servants incapable of governing each other? Are they not capable of taking turns as ruler and servants? Is there a genuine ruler among them? It\u2019s as if trying and failing to grasp its real character has no bearing on whether it is genuine. (Ibid., HY 4/2/16\u201318)\n\nMozi had worried that it would be circular to appeal to intuitions about the word use in a social d\u00e0o to authorize that very practice, for example Confucian ritual. Being a product of ritual training. acquired intuitions could not be a sufficiently neutral way of justifying our choosing ritual as our social guide. Nor could one trained practitioner have authority over another in resolving interpretive disputes about how to execute the ritual, e.g., about how to apply the terms found in ritual texts to concrete real-time behaviors. He insisted we need a neutral, non-cultural or natural basis for such meta-choices of social practices of choosing and interpreting practices.\n\nThe narrative history of Classical thought found near the end of the Zhuangzi (Ibid., HY 90/33/1) takes off from this dispute between Confucians and Mohists. It welcomes Mozi\u2019s implicit search for neutrality, universality, and greater objectivity. However, the school viewed the familiar debate between a utilitarian and traditional morality as interminable because Mozi\u2019s d\u00e0oguide, like Confucius\u2019s, starts from different standards, different \u6210 ch\u00e9ngconstructed commitments to linguistic practices. Each relies on their past practice of judging how to use the key moral \u540d m\u00edngnames. Confucians would reject Mozi\u2019s standards because they led to what Confucians view as the wrong conclusions (e.g., implied Confucians should abandon \u7fa9 y\u00ec moral rituals such as burial). The Mohists reject burial rituals because they use \u7fa9 y\u00ec morality of the social mores reformed according to their standard of general utility. The pivotal statement of Zhuangzi\u2019s position is expressed as a riff on the relativity or dependence of \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments about language use on natural circumstances, naturally existing past practice, commitments and attitudinal gestalt shifts.\n\nWhere can \u9053 d\u00e0oguides hide such that there are genuine and artificial? Where can \u8a00 y\u00e1nlanguage hide such that there is \u662f \u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that. Where can d\u00e0os hide such that they do not exist? How can a \u8a00 y\u00e1nlanguage exist and not be \u53ef k\u011bassertible? D\u00e0os hide behind small achievements and language hides behind rhetorical flourishes and elaboration. So you have the \u201cthis is right-that is wrong\u201d of the Confucians and Mohists. Of what one says \u201cthis is right\u201d the other says \u201cthat is wrong\u201d and of what they say \u201cthat is wrong\u201d says \u201cthis is right.\u201d If you want to \u201cwrong\u201d what the other \u201crights\u201d and \u201cright\u201d what the other \u2018wrong\u2019s, nothing matches \u660e m\u00edngdiscerning. (Ibid., HY4/2/24\u20137)\n\nThough balanced in judging this impasse, the Zhuangzi\u2019s interesting target is the Mohist aspiration to objectivity. Many stories in the text target the notion that utility is a naturally constant value\u2014particularly the human utility that Mozi champions. Among this series of parables, the most famous, the useless tree, illustrates the relativity of usefulness to Hui Shi. (Ibid., HY 3/1/46\u20137)\n\nNot only are we implicitly appealing to a d\u00e0o in choosing to adopt a benefit/harm standard, we are also going to appeal to interpretive d\u00e0o to judge whether we have followed it correctly or not. Mozi had treated moral disputes as disagreements about how to \u8faf bi\u00e0ndistinguish in applying terms like \u7fa9 y\u00ecmorality and \u5584 sh\u00e0ngood-at. He had also objected to Confucian reliance on acquired intuition since it made access to such judgments esoteric. He argued that standards governing such evaluative word use should be made by \u6cd5 f\u01cemeasurement standards that are accessible to the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of ordinary people. His utility standard, Zhuangzi is suggesting, is still relative to the way of translating it to behavior.\n\nOthers in the ethical debate, notably Yang Zhu and related Primitivists, also appealed to ti\u0101n (natural constancy) as a normative arbiter. The growing awareness that norms of behavior are intertwined with norms of language use, produced another feature of this strand of thought bringing the natural world into our guidance. Primitivists came to advocate silence\u2014letting the natural paths of the world take over completely.\n\nFor most of history, the Laozi has exemplified this rejection of language. It treated all social \u9053 d\u00e0ospaths as implicit rejections of the natural \u9053 d\u00e0opath. Graham has argued that echoes of this line of thinking lay in the background of Mencius\u2019s thought. That concern led him to attempt to substitute natural moral psychology (a natural moral disposition in human \u5fc3 x\u012bnheart-mind) for positive social mores.\n\nA paradigm of this anti-language, silence trend (cited in the Zhuangzi\u2019s internal history just before discussing the Laozi group ) was Shen Dao. Shen Dao postulated a \u201cGreat D\u00e0o\u201d (essentially the actual course of cosmic history from past to future) which \u201ceven a clod of earth\u201d will follow. We all will follow Great D\u00e0o. We can (and should) therefore abandon knowledge of how to make linguistic distinctions (\u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments) to follow Great D\u00e0o. Shen Dao, based on his version of logical determinism (i.e., There being an actual complete history of space-time entails your behavior tomorrow is included) draws an anti-normative, quietist and stoic conclusion.\n\nLater Mohist writings contain several acute critiques of such a trending pro-silence posture. Deeming all \u8a00 y\u00e1nlanguage as not-\u53ef k\u011bassertible is not \u53ef k\u011bassertible. The explanation, later Mohists noted, lies in the asserter\u2019s own use of \u8a00 y\u00e1nlanguage. Rejecting (f\u0113i-ing) all sh\u00ec-f\u0113i judgments is f\u0113i (wrong, to be rejected). Similarly self-defeating is \u201cteaching not to teach.\u201d\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s \u201cpipes of nature\u201d metaphor signals his departure from these defective Laozi-like or Primitivist anti-language positions. Language is natural and arguments for silence are self-condemning. So the point of Zhuangzi\u2019s own reflections on the absence of natural normative endorsement of our sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that decisions should not guide us to stop making them. Making them is what we naturally do when we find our d\u00e0os in nature. It is natural for us to make a judgment, but not nature making it. Normativity arises from within nature, but nature only makes all its normative, behavior-guiding paths for us naturally available.\n\nThe Zhuangzi emphasizes the plurality of natural stances or points of view from which one may see paths of possible behavior as \u201cnatural.\u201d For one of the paths to be available for me will be dependent on where I am and my given trajectory in the network. All the appeals to ti\u0101nnature as an authority are right in insisting their d\u00e0os are natural, but mistaken in using that as a reason to deny a similar status to the d\u00e0os of rival normative thinkers. Ti\u0101n cannot serve as an arbiter of which rival norm is correct since it equally \u201cpuffs\u201d all of them out. This allows each to claim their choices are of ti\u0101nnatural d\u00e0os but does not allow them the corollary that their rival\u2019s choices violate ti\u0101n. They, like us, conform with ti\u0101n\u2019s constancies in being committed to their d\u00e0os.\n\nAny sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis:right judgment concerning a d\u00e0o may be either a \u56e0 y\u012bndependent sh\u00ec, based on prior or enacted commitments, gestalts orientations, and inner processes or it may be an arbitrary posited (\u70ba w\u00e8ido:deem) sh\u00ec. Dependency arises from past (ch\u00e9ngfixed) commitments to the d\u00e0o structures through which we worked our way to our here-now. We always encounter such choices as we are already engaged in walking along some d\u00e0o. Those past d\u00e0o commitments bring us to a normative stance from which successive judgments of sh\u00ec-f\u0113i and \u53ef k\u011bpermissible vs. not k\u011b arise. Zhuangzi\u2019s pivotal illustration pairs \u662f sh\u00ecthis with \u5f7c b\u01d0that as near and far indexicals. His use of another indexical here signals his view that \u662f sh\u00ecthis:right used normatively as opposite to \u975e f\u0113inot-that:wrong is relative to a commitment index.\n\nLocal justifications for having sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that or k\u011bassertible are delivered in accordance our ch\u00e9ngfixed commitment momentum along the d\u00e0os that guided us to this point. This relativity of normative dependence underpins Zhuangzi\u2019s mildly ironic, skepticism of special or extraordinary normative statuses we give to, e.g., sages. The skepticism must apply even to the quietist posture that sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments are \u201cbad\u201d or unnatural. We should doubt any transcendent or allegedly perfect, totalistic epistemic access to nature\u2019s inexpressible normative know-how. There are no naturally ideal observers.\n\nWill the eventual result be there is both \u662f sh\u00ecthis:right and \u5f7c b\u01d0that? Will the eventual result be there is neither sh\u00ec nor b\u01d0? We can call the situation of neither sh\u00ec nor f\u0113i finding its opposite the \u201cpivot of \u9053 d\u00e0oguides.\u201d The pivot sets the start of the center of a sphere from which there are inexhaustible responses\u2014inexhaustible sh\u00ec and inexhaustible f\u0113i. Hence the saying \u201cnothing matches \u660e m\u00edngdiscernment.\u201d (Ibid., HY 4/2/30\u201331)\n\nThis cautious skepticism undergirds Zhuangzi\u2019s departure from the primitivists\u2019. He neither thinks we should conclude that we must not issue sh\u00ec-f\u0113i judgments nor that we must reject or deny our natural, situational inclinations to sh\u00ec-f\u0113i. We should, however, adopt an attitude of epistemic modesty in making our perspective based choices and recommending our interpretations to others. That modesty arises from m\u00edngdiscerning that their perspectives, like ours, arise from within a immensely complex and complicated natural d\u00e0o structure. Epistemic modesty also undergirds Zhuangzi\u2019s openness and willingness to interact with others. If nature has a point of view, it is that one in which all actual d\u00e0os of sh\u00ec-f\u0113i-ing in nature are available as natural guiding structures. Hence nature makes no choice that implies a more absolute, or superior normative status on either perspective. Nature makes them possible candidate guiding d\u00e0os for us to choose and walk.\n\nA question implicitly and repeatedly left to the reader is what Zhuangzi means by \u660e m\u00edngdiscerning. Does it amount to taking the view of nature but of nowhere in particular or is it a naturally occurring, perspective on perspectives, a recognition of the plurality of natural perspectives? He usually recommends to our attention insights gained from realizing that our choice is one among a wide range of naturally available d\u00e0os. He provokes us to realize that we may make progress and improve our guiding perspective by simulating the guiding perspectives of others. Some tales, by contrast, warn us not to expect the d\u00e0os of others to mesh with our capacities and character\u2014as with the boy from Shouling who goes to learn the Handan way of walking, which \u201ccripples\u201d his original ability. Still a third outcome of the interaction, as with violent gangsters, reminds us simply to keep our distance.\n\nHowever, in the standard cases, we learn from simulating others\u2019 perspectives, choices and interpretations of the natural d\u00e0o-structures either from projecting or communicating\u2014sharing methods and techniques we did not grasp before (new ways to use gourds or hand-salve or find ways to accommodate and interact while \u201cwalking two ways\u201d). New accumulated insights about natural structures may improve our range of options, from our own point of view. Learning can also help us see how to walk in the natural paths together without getting in the other\u2019s way.\n\nIn understanding other\u2019s trajectories along their d\u00e0os, we may judge them as correct or incorrect. First, we do this from our own present perspective. We neither judge all to be right nor all to be wrong\u2014nor even that all are equal. Certainly, not all are equally worthy of our choice. We need not judge that all are good choices for those following them\u2014only that the grounds of their choice may be different from ours. They might still be dogmatic, careless, or unwarranted even given the situational grounds of their choice. Nothing about the naturalness of such choices arising makes them right. All this is compatible with recognizing others as natural creatures guided by natural inner processes along natural guiding d\u00e0os.\n\nWe neither seek to follow all at once or each equally\u2014as Hui Shi seems to suggest. Nor do we resolve to follow none\u2014as Shen Dao suggests. We do judge that we might gain from being aware of and engaging in open exchanges\u2014as in Zhuangzi\u2019s dialogues. We are more inclined to follow a path, and given our similarities, think we might pursue it with benefit when we know some natural being like us found and followed it. And Zhuangzi clearly does ridicule the social moralists (Confucians and Mohists) as well as Hui Shi for the narrowness of their range of choices\u2014their failure to appreciate the richness and complexity of alternative ways of life.\n\nOur tendency to appreciate and share others\u2019 values, to mirror their behavior cooperatively, together with our awareness of the wide variety of perspectives, many of which we judge to be worthless, mistaken, or dangerous, makes it hard to treat any projected transcendental, comprehensive viewpoint as the single answer. Zhuangzi\u2019s \u201cpivot of d\u00e0os,\u201d his \u201cview from nowhere,\u201d is not a final sh\u00ec-f\u0113i judgment. It is the point prior to any sh\u00ec-f\u0113i and from which all diverge. Each commitment propels us down a different path at a ch\u00e9ngfixed momentum. We rely on ch\u00e9ngfixed commitments to prior sh\u00ec-f\u0113i in all sh\u00ec-f\u0113i judgment. All sh\u00ec-f\u0113i are indexed within the network. The judgment from no-where-when is no-judgment.\n\nWe learn from openness and exchange because we acquire commitments from simulating others\u2019 path following behavior. That we progress in such exchanges is something we ourselves judge, not the cosmos. No judgment comes from some point outside of or everywhere in the network of d\u00e0os. We are naturally influenced by others\u2019 evaluations, their judgments of our choices and their behavioral virtuosity\u2014especially when the others are our parents, perceived superiors and respected models. These, again, are the \u56e0 y\u012bndependencies on which present judgments depend.\n\nThis gives Zhuangzi\u2019s indexical relativism a different contour from Hui Shi\u2019s. The latter structures his analysis mainly on comparatives. This leads him to a version of normative \u2018error theory\u2019 \u2013the conclusion that we should abandon normative semantic distinctions as all wrong. Since the \u8faf bi\u00e0ndistinctions on which they are based are relative, they are unreal. Ergo, there are no real distinctions and the world is actually one. Any distinction making judgment, any sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that, unnaturally divides what is naturally one. Hui Shih\u2019s Tenth Thesis is:\n\nFlood concern on all the 10,000 thing-kinds; The cosmos is one \u9ad4 t\u00edunit. (HY 93/33/74)\n\nGraham, relying on his hypothesis that Zhuangzi frequently considers positions which he later rejects, had already targeted the stereotype view of Zhuangzi as agreeing with Hui Shi\u2019s monism. Graham\u2019s translation reveals the reductio that puts monism in a \u201cconsidered and rejected\u201d category. It amounts to the self-rebutting anti-language stance targeted by the Later Mohists\u2014the error Zhuangzi\u2019s naturalism of all perspectives (the \u201cpipes of heaven\u201d) was intended to avoid.\n\n\u201c[H]eaven and earth were born together with me and the myriad things and I are one.\u201d Now that we are one, can I still say anything? Now that I have called us one, did I succeed in not saying something? One and the saying make two, two and one make three. Proceeding from here even an expert calculator cannot get to the end of it, much less a plain man. (HY5/2/52\u201354)\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s relativism expresses choice, commitment, and interpretive performance on analogy to natural processes involved in following a path. Commitment is setting off along a path. We have momentum and a trajectory. The shape of the path combines with these and commits us to walk on or continue in a way that depends on the discernible shape of the path. Walking a path involves staying mostly within its physical boundaries.\n\nThis account allows us to capture the flavor of Zhuangzi\u2019s discussion which does not employ the familiar Western sentence-based metaphors of laws, rules, principles with norms of obedience, belief or propositional desire. Using the Western idiom, along with the associated practical syllogism of belief-desire explanation would give Zhuangzi the basis for a distinction between a cause and a reason\u2014a distinction he seems not to draw in his talk of \u56e0 y\u012bndependence. There is a kind of inference from d\u00e0os of choice, interpretation etc. of a path and an internal feedback d\u00e0o (our \u5fb7 d\u00e9 virtuosity at) \u201creading\u201d external paths to guide behavior.\n\nZhuangzi would not make that point in terms of deduction from a normative premise or principle. The internal and external paths themselves have a causal and normative relation to our walking behavior. A more sentential focus would similarly mean describing the outcome as an action rather than an extended course of walking/following behavior. A sentence would state the action or the intent\u2014rather like the conclusion of a practical syllogism rather than, as as fits in this metaphorical space, as performing a role in a play or or part in a symphony.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s use of the path metaphor did extend to the understanding of language but, again, not with a focus on sententials. Rather than constructing d\u00e0os in sentential form, Zhuangzi construes language in d\u00e0o form. The focus of ancient Chinese theory was on names on the analogy of path markers: \u201cgo past the tree, turn right and then down to the water.\u201d Names take on importance as sign-posts along physical structures. Confucian social versions emphasized the names of social roles and statuses more than of natural kinds. Primitivist opposition to social d\u00e0os led them into the sweeping anti-naming postures that Later Mohists showed to be self-condemning.\n\nGraham\u2019s interpretation of Zhuangzi\u2019s pipes of nature gave him a way to evade this anti-language abyss. Human language is a natural sound. Hui Shi\u2019s using relativist premises about names to derive an absolutist monism which threatened to collapse to the primitivist anti-distinction, anti-naming quietism. Making everything one is equivalent to denying \u8faf bi\u00e0ndistinctions thereby denying any real basis for the sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis way-not that statuses implicit in all \u540d m\u00edngnames and y\u00e1nwords:language.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s naturalism is anti-dogmatic, it neither denies nor asserts any particular set of distinctions as authentic. Distinctions arise from indexed here-now points in the actual network of d\u00e0o perspectives\u2014by travelers on a trajectory along one of the d\u00e0os choosing \u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113i this-not that from among multiple possible courses of behavior afforded by the cosmos. The cosmos does not select which way to make the choice.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s analogy of language and wind, however, had its own problems. Graham had noted that Zhuangzi returns to the metaphor nearer the middle of the dialogue, noting that here Zhuangzi seems to be taking back some of its implications. Having disposed of Mencius\u2019s appeal to intuition and Hui Shi\u2019s attempt to make everything normatively equal, he here addresses a more challenging position. The Later Mohists advocated a version of pragmatic-semantic realism. The Later Mohists had also argued that when a \u8faf bi\u00e0ndistinction was formulated as a sh\u00ec-f\u0113i, e.g., one of the disputants calls it \u201cox\u201d and the other \u201cnot-ox\u201d, one of them must \u52dd sh\u00e8ngwin i.e., \u7576 d\u0101nghit on it.\n\nThe Later Mohists\u2019 version of common-sense realism incorporated social conventions. Conventions set out what \u7269 w\u00f9natural-kind each term \u201cselects out\u201d or bi\u00e0ndistinguishes from the rest. We then extend that distinction to pick out new objects based on their objective similarity or difference (those accessible to \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of ordinary people). This is the basis of a social standard of correct word use enshrined in past practice.\n\nHui Shi, however, had undermined that simple version of realism with his observation that between any two \u7269 w\u00f9natural-kinds we can find some similarity and some difference. The world, in effect, gives us many ways of establishing conventional distinctions and assigning names. The Later Mohists had failed to find an adequate account of what similarities would and would not lead to what they called \u72c2\u8209 ku\u0101ngj\u01d4wild picking out . Zhuangzi\u2019s analogy of language to the noises made by wind had seemed to echo Hui Shi\u2019s normlessness about language. In this later passage, however, he revisits the wind analogy, and retreats, accepting the Mohist insight that language is more than a \u201cnatural sound.\u201d\n\nLanguage is not blowing; those who use language, have language. (Graham translates: \u201cSaying is not blowing breath, saying says something.) That which it languages is decidedly not yet fixed. Is the eventual result that they have (there is) language? Or there has never been language? Deeming it as different from bird calls: does that mark a distinction? Or is there no distinction?\u201d (HY4/2/23\u20134) (This passage is followed by the passage cited in the \u201cIntuition\u201d sub-section above)\n\nThis frustrating vagueness and signature indecision in the text leaves interpreters to philosophize about what Zhuangzi\u2019s implicit answer (\u660e m\u00edngdiscern:clear) might be. However, the analogy with bird calls is a fortuitous suggestion. We arrange, adapt and modulate the elements of our language to fit our environment, abilities, and opportunities (e.g., mating). Would Zhuangzi have guessed the same about birds?\n\nThe claim following that concurs that the \u201caboutness\u201d of a language exists but aboutness is not fixed. This can be explicated with the above discussion of the indexicals \u662f sh\u00ecthis:right and \u5f7c b\u01d0that. Zhuangzi carries the diectic character over to his treatment of the ubiquitous sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that that undergird the norms guiding how to use names (words). We endorse and recommend (sh\u00ec this:right) our guiding terms, language and linked behavior. We may base that on our correctly following prior commitments to d\u00e0os of word use\u2014relying on a Confucian traditional standard, the past and existing practices of our linguistic community.\n\nIn one passage, Zhuangzi allows this appeal to past or existing common practice but does not endorse it as right\u2014merely as useful. Conventions are useful because they facilitate communication. He he adds a tone of \u201cthat is all\u201d hinting we need not regard them as plausible candidates for being absolutely right\u2014a single transcendent standard of use.\n\nOnly those who \u201cbreak through\u201d know how to communicate with it as a \u201cone.\u201d Because of this, we don\u2019t use that strategy and instead locate things in the conventional realm. The conventional is useful; the useful, communicable, and the communicable achievable. If you hit on the achievable, you are almost there and dependent sh\u00ecs end. (Ibid., HY 4/2/36\u201337)\n\nZhuangzi describes our past sh\u00ecs of this kind as \u201clike an oath or treaty.\u201d (Ibid., HY 3/2/11) They have \u201cenactment force\u201d committing us to a d\u00e0o governing their later use. We may conform to (correctly follow) and further construct our transmitted linguistic d\u00e0o in expressing or performing (\u70ba w\u00e9ideeming) other things as sh\u00ec-f\u0113i. Our trajectory along our paths incorporates these accumulated commitments to prior practices of language use. As our d\u00e0os now bring us to new situations, how do we know to project the correct indexed choice from the prior history of differently-indexed behavior? That actual language behavior commits us to a linguistic d\u00e0o-type, but it\u2019s not clear what the commitment entails at this choice point. The Mohists and Confucians are both claiming, from their different directional perspectives, to be following similar commitments to existing d\u00e0os of practice.\n\nMozi\u2019s recommending naturally or empirically available d\u00e0os for reforming shared linguistic practice was itself, Mozi thought, following existing natural practice. He even noticed that our ongoing linguistic practice rejects treating something\u2019s merely being a shared past practice as automatically making it right. Our existing evaluation practices remind us that shared and unquestioned past practices can be wrong.\n\nMozi appealed to what he would also have regarded as a purely natural practice. Practical efficiency (l\u00ec benefit) is a standard accessible to all ordinary people\u2019s \u201ceyes and ears.\u201d Each time we apply some natural, empirically guided interpretation in practice, we participate in shaping evolving normative practices (both linguistic and behavioral practices). Each such decision commits us and others to a d\u00e0o of interpreting our social d\u00e0o. We understand our commitment to that d\u00e0o as a commitment to practice and transmit it correctly\u2014where the standard of \u2018correct\u2019 is itself either enshrined in a past practice or in natural utility. This is the basis for Zhuangzi\u2019s claim that social d\u00e0os, including linguistic d\u00e0os, are natural d\u00e0os\u2014and there are many of them. Further, as the Laozi would later famously observe, d\u00e0os can be interpretively guided. They are changeable d\u00e0os.\n\nHumans, in finding ways to walk and walking them, initiate the construction of social paths, naturally and perhaps unintentionally, by leaving prints in the natural world. Zhuangzi links the path metaphor to a society\u2019s linguistic practice thus:\n\nThat which we treat as \u53ef k\u011bassertible is \u53ef k\u011bassertible; that which we treat as not assertible is not assertible. D\u00e0os are made by walking them; thing-kinds are made \u7136 r\u00e1nso so by being called \u2018so\u2019. (Ibid., HY 4/2/33)\n\nThis sense of the immense complexity and the fluid nature of normative commitments to a d\u00e0opath underlie Zhuangzi\u2019s skeptical themes. \u660e M\u00edngclear:discerning seems linked to the gestalt in which we accept ourselves as embedded, along with others similarly situated, in nature\u2019s endlessly complex evolution of guiding structures. How do we know either that our past practice was correct or that we are correctly following them in this new situation, here and now, based solely on our eyes and ears?\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s stance toward Mohist formal realism (if we disagree on a sh\u00ec-f\u0113i, one party must \u52dd sh\u00e8ngwin) becomes clearer now. The Mohists did not specify any objective mechanism of \u201cwinning\u201d beyond some vague suggestion of tipping a balance. However Zhuangzi\u2019s point in response appears to track the warning function of a norm of truth (even when justified by our best available judging standards, we may still be wrong). Zhuangzi takes sh\u00e8ngwinning as a vague primitive in arguing that we cannot finally settle skeptical doubts by appeal to winning disputes. The main mechanism Zhuangzi discusses is appeal to a judge or authority. We appreciate that all judges will also use terms like sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that indexed by their acquired commitment momentum. Their judgments, like ours, express their momentum along a d\u00e0o of using these words here, now and projecting the usage to that, there, then.\n\nGiven that you and I have been brought to \u8faf bi\u00e0ndispute and you win me over and I don\u2019t win you over, in such a case is your distinction substantively \u662f Sh\u00ecthis:right? Mine substantively \u975e f\u0113i? If I win you over and you don\u2019t win me over; is mine substantively right? And yours?; substantively wrong? Are they partly right and partly wrong? Or jointly right and jointly wrong? You and I cannot know between ourselves, so another human inherently inherits our obscurity and doubt. To whom can we go to correct us? Employing someone who agrees with you, given that they are like you, how can they correct the situation? Employing someone who agrees with me, given that they are like me, how can they correct it? Employ someone different from both me and you to correct it, given that they are different from us both, how can they correct it? Employ someone who is like both of us to correct it, given that they are like us both, how can they correct it? So you and I and others cannot know, and in these condition on what other can we rely? The changing sounds\u2019 mutual dependence is like their conjoint autonomy. Harmonize them with glances at nature and make them dependent on eventual consensus and with that exhaust the years. (Ibid., HY 7/2/84\u201392)\n\nIt is not clear if the conclusion is supposed to be a solution to the skeptical problem posed or merely a way to cope constructively with complexity and uncertainty. The passage rules out any appeal to a special authority of any other point of view\u2014while giving equal authority in the construction to all. Even where we all share some \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d it does not have special authority\u2014say over other creatures. This, was implicit in Mozi\u2019s rejection of socially agreed d\u00e0os. Zhuangzi\u2019s notorious toying with the perspectives of animals expanded it (for naturalists). .\n\nGap-tooth asked Kingsley, \u201cDo you know that which all natural kinds agree in sh\u00ecendorse-ing?\u201d\n\nHe answers \u201cHow would I know that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, do you know of what you don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how could I know that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, does no natural kind know anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how would I know that? Nonetheless, let me try to put it in language. How would I know that what I call \u2018knowing\u2019 is not not-knowing? And what I call \u2018not-knowing\u2019, is knowing.\u201d And let me try a question on you. If people sleep in the damp, they get pains and paralysis; would eels? If in a tree, they tremble in fear; would monkeys? Of the three, does any know the correct place to live? \u2026 From where I see it, the origins of goodness and morality, painting things as \u2018this/right\u2019 or \u2018not-that/wrong\u2019 are, as boundaries, both confused and complicated; how could I know how to distinguish them? (Ibid., HY 6/2/64\u201370)\n\nThis passage reinforces the conclusion that norms of correct word use is Zhuangzi\u2019s core skeptical target. So we may indeed know how to act, according to some norms of using \u2018know how\u2019 and not if judged by some other d\u00e0o of correct usage of the knowing/ignorant distinction. Linguistic skepticism easily metastasizes to virtually any commitment. According to which d\u00e0o of projecting past practice should we judge this linguistic behavior as conforming to our commitment or not. Normative skepticism, in a use-theory is hard to contain\u2014especially when the model of all judgments is as some indexed \u662f \u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that assignment. It sweeps in metaphysics, epistemics, and semantics.\n\nA consequence is that Zhuangzi\u2019s skepticism is broad but weak. Broad because it infects so many judgments, but weak not merely in the usual sense of denying absolute certainty, but in failing to imply that we should stop or refuse to make the judgment. It does not rest on any theory of the probability of an error, but that the concept of an error is subject to the same concerns as the original judgment. It neither undermines nor give us reason to withdraw our judgments. Appreciating that others reach their views as naturally as we do only removes our status to claim that our judgment is authentically and uniquely correct.\n\nTemporally, Zhuangzi\u2019s skepticism is buttressed by reminding us of our own past experiences of learning, of acquiring new gestalts, of realizing that what we had considered the way, was subject to reconsideration and improvement. The skepticism does not target any specific failure in my epistemic process. It does not advise me to abandon my present course. It reminds me only to remain open to the further possibility of learning more\u2014about what? About the world? We can do that by learning more about other natural ways of processing and how they work in the world\u2014other d\u00e0os.\n\nIt counts as skepticism because it reminds us that we normally err on the side of overestimating than underestimating our epistemic security. We think we know and do not more often than we think we don\u2019t know and we do. And that is because we underestimate the range of possible alternative d\u00e0os. Hence the pragmatic upshot of his skepticism is to remind us to engage with more other points of view.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s skepticism is weak because it acknowledges that we may apply different concepts of \u2018knowing\u2019 in different situations. Implicitly, it does not deny that we could meet some particular standard of knowing, but that we could know for every situation which standard is the right one. What standard is the right one to use for acknowledging or denying someone knows well enough to satisfy, for example, the correct d\u00e0o of assertion?\n\nThis feature of Zhuangzi\u2019s skepticism lies at the heart of the famous debate between Zhuangzi and Hui Shi about the fish-pleasure in which Zhuangzi defends a claim to know against Hui Shi\u2019s challenge. Zhuangzi makes an assertion and Hui Shi initiates the skeptical challenge. His challenge implies that there is a favored or correct standard of knowing that turns out to be impossibly strict. All knowledge must come from inside. It\u2019s impossibly strict because it doesn\u2019t allow Hui Shi to issue the challenge in this conversation.\n\nZhuangzi and Hui Shi wandered over the Hao River bridge. Zhuangzi said, \u201cthose mini-fish coming from there and cruising around, relaxed and unhurried, are fish at leisure.\u201d Hui Shi said \u201cYou are not a fish; from whence do you know the leisure of fish?\u201d Zhuangzi retorted, \u201cYou are not me, from what perspective do you know my not knowing fish at leisure?\u201d Hui Shi responds, \u201cI\u2019m not you, of course I don\u2019t know about you; You are not a fish and that\u2019s enough to count as you\u2019re not knowing fish\u2019s leisure.\u201d Zhuangzi concludes, \u201cLet\u2019s return to where we started. When you said \u2018from what perspective do you know fish at leisure\u2019, you clearly knew my knowing it as you asked me. I knew it here above the Hao.\u201d (Ibid., HY 45/17/87\u201391)\n\nGraham drew our attention to the role of perspective in this passage, noting that Hui Shi\u2019s challenge to Zhuangzi\u2019s assertion does not use the normal question form, (\u4f55 h\u00e9how do you know?) but a locative question word (\u5b89 \u0101nwhence?). This brings the debate into alignment with Zhuangzi\u2019s concern about the various perspectives from which to deploy a d\u00e0o of word use. Here, as above, the word is \u77e5 zh\u012bknow. The norm of asserting, as in English, involves answering the challenge \u201chow do you know?\u201d What normative conditions allow me, here and now, correctly to use the term zh\u012bknow\u2014hence to make the assertion about these fish below me? Hui Shi both knew Zhuangzi was relying on a d\u00e0o of using \u2018know\u2019 \u201cfrom zhuangzi\u2018s here\u201d and Hui Shi knew Zhuangzi\u2019s situation from his own relevantly similar \u201chere-now\u201d and relying on the same \u9053 d\u00e0onorm of claiming to know from a distinct perspective. Hui Shi cannot consistently insist that a speaker can only use \u77e5 zh\u012bknow when he occupies the perspective of the thing known.\n\nNotice, the argument about the fish implies we have a perspective on the perspectives of others. So skepticism grounded in dependence or relativity of perspective need not be predominantly negative. Zhuangzi, here, uses it to justify a way of claiming to knowing. In many other parables, he addresses the kind of knowing that comes with a gestalt shift, especially when we see our own and others\u2019 points of view as similar\u2014see ourselves as others see us. This is the more comprehensive perspective Zhuangzi urges on us. We experience such gestalt shifts especially when we come appreciate we had been wrong before and now view things differently. We are confident from our own \u201cnow\u201d that we have made epistemic progress\u2014our new awareness seems \u201crelatively\u201d improved to us now. We reach a state where we judge our former perspective to be inferior to our present one. It includes insight into our relative situations. Evidently, this awareness of one\u2019s own perspective as one of many, equally natural points of view motivates us to wonder if we have made the final correction. This enhanced awareness of ourselves as one of many perspectives is an intelligible candidate reading of Zhuangzi\u2019s \u660e m\u00edngclarity. It is harder to construct a coherent narrative for mystical and/or dogmatic readings\u2014those that jump from an improved perspective to a perfect one.\n\nThis kind of gestalt shift leads us to reflect on how narrow our past perspective had been. It features prominently in the \u201cAutumn Floods\u201d Chapter 17. The Earl of the Yellow River, having thought himself as the ultimate, discovers the North Sea and announces his former error and newfound awareness of his lesser significance in \u201cthe greater path.\u201d The North Sea Overlord tells him that he too sees himself as situated in a modest status in a still greater scheme and rejects the River Earl\u2019s attempts to identify the North Sea\u2019s as ultimate. He casts doubt on there being a final, ultimately small or large.\n\nThe lord of He river said, \u201cSo can I consider cosmos \u2018large\u2019 and the tip of a hair as \u2018small\u2019?\u201d North Sea Ruo replied, \u201cNo! Thing kinds have unlimited measurement (ways of measuring); Time has no end; distinctions have no constancy, beginning and ending no inherent cause. Because of this great knowing is viewed within a range of distant and close. \u2026We calculate that what humans know is never as great as what they do not know, their temporal extent of life is not as great as not as much as the time before life, and from the very small to try to take in the scope of the very large, is an invitation to confusion and disorder and not that from which we can gain. (Ibid., HY 42/17/14\u201320)\n\nCan we describe Zhuangzi\u2019s m\u00edng as \u201chaving a sense of our limited perspective?\u201d Credulous, dogmatic and imperious absolutists do not appreciate themselves as being in one of a variety of natural perspectives. Broad open-mindedness and mild skepticism come together in the m\u00edngclarity Zhuangzi encourages in us. It has a dual nature\u2014an epistemically modest perspective on ourselves that arises from improving our epistemic status and encourages us to continue. It helps us appreciate that we are still as naturally situated and others with whom we may disagree and still grow. Further improvement can come from further exchange of perspectives.\n\nThe na\u00efve Confucian-Mohist advocates of imposing a single social d\u00e0o thus disrupt the natural process by which social d\u00e0os evolve in real time as we seek a harmony guided by \u201cglances at nature.\u201d Seeing things from another\u2019s perspective both alerts us to how we could be wrong and makes us feel that we now understand things better than with our former, narrower perspective. Yet, the Zhuangzi repeatedly reminds us not to abandon epistemic modesty when we make epistemic progress. That we now see things from a perspective in common with another does not make us both right. Yet, the more comprehensive our perspective, the \u201cclearer\u201d the new gestalt should seem.\n\nThe search for this kind of perspective on ourselves and others seems to motivate Zhuangzi\u2019s willingness to engage and interact with others, seeking to understand their perspective as having a natural status and role for them as ours does for us. This is partly illustrated by common sense examples of our judging from our own current perspective that theirs \u201cadds something\u201d enriching our own perspective by our own lights. Sometimes it\u2019s dangerous to try to mix others\u2019 perspectives with your own.\n\nAnd have you alone not heard tell of those from Shou-ling who studied walking with those in Handan? They never mastered the country\u2019s skill and lost their original way of walking, and stumbled and crawled back. (Ibid., HY45/17/79\u201380)\n\nAside from its frequent usefulness from our point of view, the main benefit from the self-recognition as a natural creature embedded as are others at a perspective-point within a natural network structure is to encourage being open-minded. Part of the value is the humbling of our epistemic pride, mildly disrupting our judgment equilibrium. Without such an occasional perspective on ourselves, we too easily fall into exaggerating our epistemic exceptionalism. The reminder that we are intermingled with others in a web of natural perspectives gives us an appropriate, realistic correction. A Zhuangzi story illustrates such a moment.\n\nZhuangzi was wandering in Diaoling fields when he glimpsed a weird magpie-like-thing flying in from the south. It had a wingspan of over seven-feet and passed so close his forehead, he could feel it. Then it gathered its wings and settled in a chestnut grove. Zhuangzi thought \u201cwhat bird is that? Massive wings of such power and eyes so large it couldn\u2019t see me.\u201d He hiked up his robe and hurriedly tiptoed closer holding his cross-bow at the ready. Then he spotted a cicada settling in the shaded shelter without a worry for itself, but a preying mantis opened its pincers about to grab it, also focused on its gain and ignoring its own bodily danger. The strange magpie burst out and harvested them both\u2014similarly unaware of the natural dangers he faced. But Zhuangzi was suddenly seized with this thought, \u201cWe natural kinds are all interconnected! We two different species are mutually seeing things in our own ways.\u201d He dismantled his crossbow and fled, himself now himself pursued by the game warden shouting out his crimes. (Ibid., HY 54/20/61\u20135)\n\nOverall, Zhuangzi clearly recommends open-minded flexibility as when he scolds Hui Shi for being tied to conventional thinking about how to use giant gourds. He illustrates it again with his story about different uses of a salve that prevents chapping. He models such openness in his conversations with cripples (righteously shunned by Confucians), freaks, thieves, strange creatures, the wind, a shadow and a skull. He imagines many other conversations illustrating the differences of perspectives, capacities and needs.\n\nWhile we cannot help making our own judgments and commitments, he seems to see tolerance and accommodation as values that follow from appreciating other natural perspectives:\n\nA monkey keeper says (to the monkeys) \u201cI\u2019ll give you three [rations] in the morning and four in the evening.\u201d The monkeys seemed angry. \u201cOk, I\u2019ll give you four in the morning and three in the evening.\u201d The monkeys were happy. So with no substantive loss, he could change their anger to happiness. This is an example of a sh\u00ec judgment being dependent on circumstances. So the sage uses sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments to harmonize and rests in the natural balance. And we can call this walking as pairs. (Ibid., HY 5/2/38\u201340)\n\nWe are, as it happens, capable of understanding the perspectives of others well enough to accommodate and cooperate with them, to borrow insights and to reach agreements. However, the Zhuangzi seems skeptical that we can extrapolate from this ordinary capacity to broaden our perspective to having some absolute or comprehensive insight\u2014as it were from all points of view. Nor, as we saw above, can we assume that because the two disputants come to a resolution or agreement, it constitutes knowing from a cosmically or absolutely higher perspective. Hui Shi\u2019s relativism, recall, does point to such an infinite expansion ending in a single universal point of view. Here, however, we are reminded that while we experience a gestalt broadening of perspective as revealing something real and significant (like waking from a dream), we cannot extrapolate from that to the claim to be able to know the final result of such gestalt leaps to broader perspectives.\n\nEven though North Sea Lord denies there is any final or ultimately broad perspective from which we can make sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments, the parable suggests a progressive path toward broader perspectives with those further along having the epistemic status to guide those with less comprehensive perspectives. However, arguments in Chapter 2 suggest that progress must always be judged from a moving frame of reference along a d\u00e0o that is already ch\u00e9ngfixed in our x\u012bnheart-mind that shoots-out the sh\u00ec-f\u0113i.\n\nOur location and trajectory makes us receptive to some and not other avenues of learning. The boy was unable to master the Handan way of walking because of the way he had already learned to walk. The monkey keeper could accommodate the monkeys, but still disagreed with them about the importance of the breakfast-dinner choice. That someone understands and agrees with both of us does not make his judgment correct. The final skepticism concerns whether these paths of progress of perspectives must or will converge on a single outcome.\n\nThe epistemic modesty implicit in Zhuangzi\u2019s skepticism targets mainly the paternalistic, superior attitude toward other points of view exemplified by Confucian and Mohist moralistic posture. When we have an accommodation (you and I come to a common agreement) you and I may both rate it as progress. However, it does not imply we have moved to a higher state of overall insight along an absolute scale\u2014or from any arbitrary third point of view. Exchange of points of view can be valuable to each (perhaps in different ways) and broadening perspective in this way can make us wiser\u2014but always as judged from our already operative \u6210 ch\u00e9ngfixed d\u00e0os . We can advise and recommend our normative perspective on others, but their being able to appreciate and use it depends on their capacities, options and situation.\n\nAt this point, Zhuangzi starts to draw an analogy of dreaming and waking up to the shift in gestalt that comes when we leap to a more comprehensive perspective. At awakening, we immediately appreciate the unreality of the dream, yet within the dream, we can have a similar gestalt shift and dream of having dreamed and interpreted that deeper dream.\n\nHow do I know that loving life is not a form of ignorance? How do I know disliking death is not a weak farewell of the sort when we don\u2019t know about the return? Miss Li Zhi cries when she is betrothed to someone\u2019s son, and when she first goes off to the Jin state soaks her clothing with her tears; but then she arrives at the kings abode, sleeps with the king in his bed, eats fattened livestock and then starts to regret her tears. How do I know the dead do not regret their former clinging to life, We dream of eating and drinking and on awaking cry bitterly, we dream of weeping and wailing and awake in a good mood to go off hunting. When we dream, we don\u2019t know it as a dream, and in our dreams, judge something else as a dream. On awakening, we know it was a dream, and there could be another greater awakening in which we know a greater dream, and under these the conditions the ignorant think they are as enlightened as if they had learned it by an investigation. Gentlemen to shepherds inherently do this! (Ibid., HY 6/2/78\u201383)\n\nSo, is there an ultimate or final possible such shift in gestalt\u2014some final state of knowing what to do? Zhuangzi\u2019s relativism is mildly skeptical because he cannot know either that there is not nor that there is a final or ultimate \u201cawakening\u201d\n\nThe dream theme is memorably carried over to the story of Zhuangzi dreaming a butterfly and/or vice versa. It seems to suggest that the gestalt sense of liberation from error may even be reciprocal. Perhaps our subsequent perspective is one from which most would move to our former perspective. Adolescent conversion can be to or from a religion.\n\nOnce before, Zhuangzi dreamt of being a butterfly, gaily butterflying and himself embodied in this sense of purpose! He knew nothing of Zhuangzi. Suddenly awakening, he then is rooted in Zhuangzi. He doesn\u2019t know if Zhuangzi dreamt being a butterfly or a butterfly is dreaming being Zhuangzi\u2014though there must be a difference. This is called \u201cthings change.\u201d (Ibid., HY7/2/94)\n\nElaborating the complexity this way makes Zhuangzi\u2019s proposals seem disappointing as solutions. They amount to mildly suggesting that we allow the exchange of views to go on without the domination of any dogma and with some vague \u201cglances at natural constancies\u201d and see what comes out \u201cin the long run.\u201d\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s conception of d\u00e0os in nature, from a here-now to a there-then, differs from a Mohist (broadly utilitarian) naturalism. Utilitarianism is a natural constraint, an allegedly single naturally correct way for all of us to choose our course. In effect, Zhuangzi is more of a natural pluralist, with the natural outcome of morality the product of ongoing individual and social construction.\n\nD\u00e0os are in nature but not choices of nature for us. So the discussion, competition, and even strife between d\u00e0os and their advocates are factors in an ongoing natural \u9053 d\u00e0oguiding process. We and our circumstances change as we each find, choose and walk different naturally evolving paths.\n\nThis does not entail we should not advocate our own way. Such exchanges are part of the natural process of construction of \u9053 d\u00e0ospaths and making them available to others. Such a dialogue of competing d\u00e0os constitutes the natural evolutional d\u00e0o of guidance. Realizing this, we should not flatter ourselves, posing as the Confucian father shaping his child\u2019s character, but as a contributor in this competition among similarly natural ways. We express perspectives located in a real world of indexed points from which we choose behavioral paths.\n\nSome characters in Zhuangzi\u2019s dialogues wonder about exceptional figures who allegedly have abilities that justify that paternal posture\u2014the capacity to transcend our location in points of view and to lecture all of us from a privileged perspective. The Zhuangzi\u2019s response typically remind them that such idealized points of view are neither intelligible to us nor relevant to what we should do. Either these exceptional observers have their own naturally ch\u00e9ngfixed frames of reference in the natural world, or they are outside of the natural world in some unrealistically free realm. If the latter, then their views are both unintelligible and irrelevant to us. What they would do in our situation does not constitute helpful advice to us. To advocate following the advice of these ideal observers is to speak practical nonsense to non-ideal, actual actors.\n\nGap Tooth, following Kingsley\u2019s skeptical formulation above says:\n\nSo you don\u2019t know what is beneficial or harmful, does the \u201cfully arrived human\u201d necessarily not know them? Kingsley replied, \u201cthe fully arrived person becomes pure sapience, he could be in a blazing forest and not be able to feel any heat, the rivers of our civilization could freeze and he couldn\u2019t feel any chill, devastating lighting could pulverize mountains and the wind raise a tidal wave and he could not experience surprise. Someone like that could ride on clouds and air, straddle the sun and moon, and wander beyond the four oceans. Death and life are not different for him, much less the inclinations of benefit and harm.\u201d Master Ju Que asked master Zhang Wu, \u201cI\u2019ve heard from my teacher that a sagely man does not find social dealings worth engaging, doesn\u2019t pursue utility, doesn\u2019t avoid harm, doesn\u2019t take delight in striving, doesn\u2019t follow d\u00e0os, in silence says things, and in saying things is silent, and roams outside the nitty-gritty of the actual world. Master regarded this as romantic fantasy but I deem it the execution of a mysterious d\u00e0o. My kind sir what do you say of this?\u201d Zhang Wu replied, \u201cThis is something that, were the yellow emperor to hear, it would be like buzzing, and so how could the likes of Confucius come to know it? Furthermore, you have jumped to conclusions\u2026 . I\u2019ll give you some absurd talk and you absurdly listen.\u201d (Ibid., HY 6/2/71\u20137)\n\nHowever, in later chapters, Zhuangzi himself seems to recommend to us examples of such spectacular capacities\u2014the most beautifully and elaborately expressed of which is the passage celebrating Butcher Ding.\n\nButcher Ding carved an ox for Lord Wen Hui; his point of contact, the way he inclined his torso, his foot position, the angle of his knee \u2026 gliding, flowing! The knife sang \u201cwhuaa\u201d with nothing out of tune. It was as if he were dancing the Faun Ballet or directing an opera. Lord Wen Hui exclaimed \u201cOle! Splendidly done! Can talent extend even to this?. Butcher Ding gestured with his knife, explaining, \u201cWhat your servant pursues is d\u00e0o; which is what skill aims at. When I began to carve oxen, what I saw was nothing but the oxen. After three years, I had ceased seeing them as wholes, and now my sapience mingles so that I don\u2019t see with my eyes, Sensory know-how ends and my sapient desires take over my performance. I rely on natural guiding structures, separate out the great chunks and steer through empty gaps depending on the anatomy. I evade places where cords and filaments intertwine, much less the large bones. A good cook gets a new knife every year; he chops! Mediocre cooks change knives monthly; they hack. My knife now has 19 years on it; it\u2019s carved several thousand oxen and the edge is as if I had just taken it from the sharpener. Those joints have gaps, and the knife\u2019s edge no thickness, to put something infinitesimally thin in an empty space?! Effortless! It even allows the edge wander in with ample room to play. That is why, with 19 years on it, this knife\u2019s edge is grindstone fresh.\u201d (Ibid., 7/3/2\u20138)\n\nThe Zhuangzi plays several variations on this theme. Sometimes the virtuoso performer catches cicadas on a sticky rod, another crafts chariot wheels, there are musicians, debaters, and thieves. The theme extends to animals, millipedes with their expertise in coordinating their limbs while maintaining a smooth flow, snakes flashing by while slithering on their stomachs, One implicit example is Zhuangzi\u2019s own relation with his relativist rival and buddy, Hui Shi. Bemoaning his loss while visiting his sidekick\u2019s grave, Zhuangzi spins a tale of a virtuoso ax-thrower who sliced specks off the nose of his crony, but lost his \u201cknack\u201d when his co-performer passed away. (Ibid., HY 66/24/48\u201351)\n\nThe tales often highlight the tranquil state that accompanies behavior that skillfully follows a natural path. The performances look and feel effortless.

His personal name was Xiong L\u00fc, ancestral name Mi (\u8288), and King Zhuang was his posthumous title. He became one of the Five Hegemons and attempted to wrest control of China from the king of Zhou.\n\nKing Zhuang ascended the throne in 613 BC at a time when the Kingdom of Chu was in disarray. For the first three years of his reign, Zhuang wasted time on excessive hunting and lavish partying. Several courtiers were anxious about the king but none dared speak up as he had given orders that anyone who challenged his authority would be killed. When a particularly senior minister challenged him through a riddle, the king responded that he had been waiting for three years for someone from his court to show some nationalistic pride.\n\nThe king made Sunshu Ao chancellor and began a series of reforms. Chu's agricultural output improved significantly during his reign, aided by Sunshu Ao's comprehensive dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir created in modern-day northern Anhui province. In 611 BC he annexed the State of Yong (\u5eb8\u56fd), a move which made Chu much stronger.\n\nAfter some overwhelming victories at the head of his army, King Zhuang attempted to take the place of King Ding of Zhou. He asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the Nine Tripod Cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China at the time but was rebuffed.\n\nIn the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the State of Jin, another strong state at that time. Later he achieved hegemony amongst some other states. His progress from lazy regent to a hegemon of his time gave rise to the Chinese Four-character idiom of y\u012b m\u01d0ng j\u012bng r\u00e9n (Chinese: \u4e00\u55da\u9a5a\u4eba; literally: \"Amaze [the others] with one cry\")."}, {"url": "https://www.visiontimes.com/2021/07/12/a-forgiving-nature-is-always-rewarded.html", "page_content": "King Zhuang of Chu (\u695a\u838a\u738b) was one of the Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn Period (\u6625\u79cb\u4e94\u9738, 770-476 B.C.), and the most accomplished monarch of Chu.\n\nAt a celebration after the suppression of a rebellion, King Zhuang and his ministers drank to their heart\u2019s content. King Zhuang had his concubine Xu Ji toast the ministers. In the evening, he ordered the court to light candles, and the singing and dancing continued.\n\nSuddenly a gust of wind blew out the candles. In the darkness, one of the drunken courtiers pulled on Xu Ji\u2019s clothing. In those days, no men were allowed in the palace unless they were castrated. Assaulting a concubine in this way was a serious offence. She pulled the tassel off of the courtier\u2019s hat and asked King Zhuang to deal with him. King Zhuang not only did not do anything about it but also said loudly that everyone should take their tassels off, relax and enjoy. After all the ministers had taken off their tassels, King Zhuang ordered the candles to be relit.\n\nXu Ji was both surprised and angry. When the banquet was over, she complained to the king. He replied, \u201cIt is excusable to be careless after drinking. If I were to condemn a minister to death over something like this, it would chill the hearts of other ministers, and they would not be able to do their best to defend the country.\u201d Nodding, Xu Ji listened, and agreed.\n\nThe minister was undoubtedly at fault for his drunken demeanor, but King Zhuang showed breadth of mind in the way he handled the incident. In time, he was repaid for his kindness.\n\nWhen King Zhuang was leading his troops to attack the state of Zheng, he was ambushed, and in a critical situation. Tang Cui, the vice general of the Chu army, single-handedly rushed into the enemy lines and rescued King Zhuang from the chaos. The King of Chu was very grateful and wanted to reward him.

The only known close counterpart to this blade is a damaged bronze halberd blade, missing the yuan, and inscribed on the hu with seven characters, which can be generally translated to \u2018for the auspicious use of Qu Shutuo of Chu\u2019. That halberd is now in the collection of the Hunan Provincial Museum, Hunan, and published in Wu Zhenfeng, Shangzhou qingtongqi mingwen ji tuxiang jicheng [Compendium of inscriptions and images of bronzes from Shang and Zhou dynasties], vol. 32, Shanghai, 2012, no. 17048. The reemergence of this significant blade has provided an opportunity for close examination revealing an inscription of a total of twenty characters, eight on the hu and twelve on the nei (seven on one side and five on the other side). The meaning of seven of these characters is unresolved; however the remaining thirteen can be translated as: 'Qu Shutuo of Chu, Qu X's grandson, yuanyou of the King of Chu'. Based on the inscription, the owner of this blade can be identified as someone named Qu Shutuo.\n\n\n\nTwentieth century scholars, using only published ink rubbings and drawings of the present halberd, have attempted to match Qu Shutuo to members of the Qu family recorded in historical texts. The Qu family enjoyed prominent status in the Chu court. Members of the family were appointed to various positions as high officials and military generals. It is also believed the Qu family was of royal lineage. According to Tongzhi [Comprehensive records] written by the Song dynasty (960-1279) historian Zheng Qiao (1104-1162), Xia (d. 699 BC), son of King Wu of Chu (d. 690 BC), was rewarded the territory of Qu. He adopted Qu as his last name and became Qu Xia, the progenitor of the Qu family. Given the importance of the Qu family and its connection to the Chu court, the identification of Qu Shutuo contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the Chu history.\n\n\n\nThe research of these scholars was, however, limited to a certain degree because an essential character\u2014the first name of Qu Shutuo's grandfather\u2014is illegible in some of the published rubbings and drawings of this halberd. Perhaps the most widely accepted theory regarding the identity of the halberd\u2019s owner was developed by He Hao (b. 1929), a historian specializing the Chu state. In his paper, 'Chu Qu Shutuo Ge kao [Study of the halberd blade of Chu Qu Shutuo]', Anhui wenxue [Literature of Anhui], vol. 1, Hefei, 1985, pp 56-59, He Hao notes the name Qu Shutuo is not recorded in any of the pre-Qin dynasty (221-207 BC) texts. He posits that 'Shutuo' is in fact the zi of Qu, and therefore, there is a possibility that Qu Shutuo may have been recorded in the historical texts under a different name. He Hao then proposes a candidate, a royal guard of Chu named Qu Dang, who is recorded in the Zuozhuan [The Commentary of Zuo] to have participated in the Battle of Bi.\n\n\n\nThe Zuozhuan provides a detailed narrative on this famous battle fought between the Chu and Jin states in 597 BC, which ended in a decisive victory for Chu, and which, in turn, cemented the position of King Zhuang of Chu as one of the five hegemons of the Spring and Autumn period (770-476 BC). During this battle, the war chariots of King Zhuang of Chu were divided into the right and left flanks. Xu Yan commanded the right chariot with Yang Youji on the right. Peng Ming commanded the left chariot with Qu Dang on the right. When King Zhuang of Chu was in pursuit of General Zhao Zhan of Jin, Zhao was forced to abandon his chariot in the woods. Qu Dang then jumped off the chariot, successfully captured him and seized his armor.\n\n\n\nHe Hao notes in his paper that according to the Zhouli zhushu [Annotations to Rites of Zhou], the guard on the right of the royal war chariot holds a ge and a shield and rides together with the king. Qu Dang was on the right of the royal war chariot during the Battle of Bi, and therefore, he was a right guard to King Zhuang of Chu. The inscription on the present blade states that Qu Shutuo was the yuanyou of King Chu. He Hao argues yuanyou should be interpreted as the \u2018right guard [of the war chariot]\u2019, as the ancient name of war chariot is yuanrong, and the Chinese character for \u2018right\u2019 is you. Based on He\u2019s interpretation, Qu Shutuo was a right guard for the king of Chu, which is consistent with the aforementioned historical records about Qu Dang.\n\n\n\nIn attempting to determine the character that specifies the first name of Qu Shutuo\u2019s grandfather, which is illegible in most rubbings and drawings, He Hao traces the history of the Qu family based on historical texts and concludes that Qu Dang was the grandson of Qu Wan, who was the dafu of Chu (for his detailed discussion, see ibid., p. 58). In conclusion, He Hao believes the owner of this blade was Qu Dang and infers the character he could not read must be wan. The validity of He\u2019s conclusion, therefore, relies on the identification of the missing character in the inscription, which will either corroborate or refute his hypothesis.\n\n\n\nFortunately, upon thorough physical inspection, the character previously illegible in the published rubbings can be made out. The once-intaglio character is now filled with oxidized encrustations and has an almost flat surface, which is why it could not be properly transferred via the ink rubbing. The character appears to be in a vertical two-part composition: the top part seems to be the character mao (spear), the bottom part has yet to be deciphered. Although the character remains unidentifiable, it is conspicuously different from the character wan. It is also unlikely to be the zi of Qu Wan, as a zi would normally consist of two characters. In addition, this character is not found in any of the names of the Qu family members noted in He Hao\u2019s paper.\n\n\n\nA closer examination of the blade also reveals an additional character, zhi (of) on one side of the nei, which does not appear in some of the previous illustrated publications. For example, in Wu Zhenfeng\u2019s book, the author records nineteen characters (including the illegible character). The zhi character complicates existing understanding of the inscription, as the placement of this preposition character allows the last part of the inscription to be read in a different order, which could produce a different interpretation of the inscription.\n\n\n\nThe reemergence of the Chu Qu Shutuo Ge provides a great opportunity for the advancement of scholarship. The inscription poses challenges to the exciting understanding of Chu history raising fascinating new questions in the process. Hopefully fresh research based on this important artifact will illuminate the true identity of its original owner and the historical context surrounding him.\n\n\n\nInk rubbings by Li Zhi\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/Chinese-literature/1949-76", "page_content": "1949\u201376\n\nLiterature on the China mainland from 1949 through much of the 1970s was largely a reflection of political campaigns and ideological battles. This state of affairs can be traced to Mao Zedong\u2019s 1942 \u201cZai Yan\u2019an wenyi zuotanhui shang de jianghua\u201d (\u201cTalks at the Yan\u2019an Forum on Literature and Art\u201d), in which he articulated his position that literature, which existed to serve politics, was to be popularized while the people\u2019s level of literary appreciation was gradually being elevated. Mao\u2019s call for a truly proletarian literature\u2014written by and for workers, peasants, and soldiers\u2014gave rise to a series of rectification campaigns that further defined and consolidated party control over literary activities. In 1949 the First National Congress of Writers and Artists was convened, and the All-China Federation of Literature and Art Circles was founded, with Guo Moruo elected as its first chairman.\n\nMao\u2019s literary ideals had first been realized in the 1940s by Zhao Shuli, whose early stories, such as \u201cLi Youcai banhua\u201d (\u201cThe Rhymes of Li Youcai\u201d), were models of proletarian literature, both in form and in content. As the civil war neared its conclusion, novels of land reform, such as Ding Ling\u2019s prizewinning Taiyang zhao zai Sangganhe shang (1949; The Sun Shines over the Sanggan River) and Baofeng zhouyu (1949; The Hurricane) by Zhou Libo, became quite popular. Few of the established May Fourth writers continued to produce fiction after 1949, for their experience as social critics did not prepare them for Socialist Realism, a method of composition, borrowed from the Soviet Union, according to which society is described as it should be, not necessarily as it is. Many of the older poets, however, were successful during the early postliberation years, writing poetry in praise of land reform, modernization, and Chinese heroes of the Korean War. Playwrights were also active, introducing more proletarian themes into their works, some of which incorporated music. By this time Lao She had begun writing plays, such as Longxugou (1951; Dragon Beard Ditch), which earned him the prestigious title of People\u2019s Artist. Another very popular play, Baimaon\u00fc (1953; White-Haired Girl) by He Jingzhi, was taken from a contemporary folk legend. It was made a model that all writers were supposed to follow.\n\nDuring the mid-1950s an experiment in liberalization\u2014the Hundred Flowers Campaign\u2014was abruptly terminated as criticism of the party went beyond all expectations. It was followed by an anti-rightist movement that purged the cultural ranks of most preliberation writers and artists and deprived many young writers such as Liu Binyan and Wang Meng of their freedom to write. The literary nadir, however, was not reached until the Cultural Revolution (1966\u201376), when the only literature available was a few carefully screened works by Lu Xun, a handful of model revolutionary operas, known as yangbanxi, and the revolutionary-romantic novels of Hao Ran. After the death of Mao and the fall of the Gang of Four, literature made a comeback and most surviving writers were rehabilitated, although the progress was as rocky as the political scene Chinese literature continued to reflect."}, {"url": "http://chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/personszhuangqiao.html", "page_content": "Mar 6, 2019 \u00a9 Ulrich Theobald\n\nThere might have been two persons with the name Zhuang Qiao \u838a\u8e7b, Zhuang Hao \u838a\u8c6a, or Quan Zu \u4f01\u8db3, one being a rebel leader, another one a general, both in the state of Chu \u695a during the Warring States period \u6230\u570b (5th cent.-221 BCE).\n\nThe rebellion of Zhuang Qiao broke out after the disastrous defeat of Chu in the battle of Chuisha \u5782\u6c99 (today's Tanghe \u5510\u6cb3, Henan) in 301 against three alled states and brought the state into such a turmoil that the central government lost grip over large parts of the country, as the books Xunzi \u8340\u5b50 (ch.

Another possibility is that the rebel leader Zhuang Qiao marched to the west, the region of Ba \u5df4 and Shu \u8700 in the Sichuan Basin, and had nothing to do with the Dian expedition.\n\nWhen Qin occupied the western parts of Chu in 277 and founded the commandery of Qianzhong \u9ed4\u4e2d (Yuanling \u6c85\u9675, Hunan), Zhuang was cut off from the rest of Chu and assumed the title of King Zhuang \u838a\u738b, perhaps because he was an offspring of King Zhuang of Chu \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 614-591).\n\nSources:\n\nGao Wende \u9ad8\u6587\u5fb7, ed.

According to traditional dating, Master Zhuang, to whom the first seven chapters of the text have traditionally been attributed, was an almost exact contemporary of the Confucian thinker Mencius, but we have no record of direct philosophical dialogue between them. The text is ranked among the greatest of literary and philosophical masterpieces that China has produced. Its style is complex\u2014mythical, poetic, narrative, humorous, indirect, and polysemic.\n\nMuch of the text espouses a holistic philosophy of life, encouraging disengagement from the artificialities of socialization, and cultivation of our natural \u201cancestral\u201d potencies and skills, in order to live a simple and natural, but full and flourishing life. It is critical of our ordinary categorizations and evaluations, noting the multiplicity of different modes of understanding between different creatures, cultures, and philosophical schools, and the lack of an independent means of making a comparative evaluation. It advocates a mode of understanding that is not committed to a fixed system, but is fluid and flexible, and that maintains a provisional, pragmatic attitude towards the applicability of these categories and evaluations.\n\nThe Zhuangzi text is an anthology, in which several distinctive strands of Daoist thought can be recognized. The Jin dynasty thinker and commentator, Guo Xiang (Kuo Hsiang, d. 312 CE), edited and arranged an early collection, and reduced what had been a work in fifty-two chapters down to thirty-three chapters, excising material that he considered to be repetitious or spurious. The versions of Daoist philosophy expressed in this text were highly influential in the reception, interpretation, and transformation of Buddhist philosophies in China.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Historical Background\n\nAccording to the Han dynasty historian, Sima Qian, Zhuangzi was born during the Warring States (403-221 BCE), more than a century after the death of Confucius. During this time, the ostensibly ruling house of Zhou had lost its authority, and there was increasing violence between states contending for imperial power. This situation gave birth to the phenomenon known as the baijia, the hundred schools: the flourishing of many schools of thought, each articulating its own conception of a return to a state of harmony. The first and most significant of these schools was that of Confucius, who became the chief representative of the Ruists (Confucians), the scholars and propagators of the wisdom and culture of the tradition. Their great rivals were the Mohists, the followers of Mozi (\u201cMaster Mo\u201d), who were critical of what they perceived to be the elitism and extravagance of the traditional culture. The archaeological discovery at Guo Dian in 1993 of an early Laozi manuscript suggests that the philosophical movement associated with the text also began to emerge during this period. The strands of Daoist philosophy expressed in the earliest strata of the Zhuangzi developed within a context infused with the ideas of these three schools. Master Zhuang is usually taken to be the author of the first seven chapters, but in recent years a few scholars have found reason to be skeptical not just of his authorship of any of the text, but also of his very existence.\n\nAccording to early evidence compiled by Sima Qian, Zhuangzi was born in a village called Meng, in the state of Song; according to Lu Deming, the Sui-Tang dynasty scholar, the Pu River in which Zhuangzi was said to have fished was in the state of Chen which, as Wang Guowei points out, had become a territory of the southern state of Chu. We might say that Zhuangzi was situated in the borderlands between Chu, centered around the Yangzi River, and the central plains\u2014which centered around the Yellow River and which were the home of the Shang and Zhou cultures. Some scholars, especially in China, maintain that there is a connection between the philosophies of the Daoist texts and the culture of Chu. The diversity of regions and cultures in early China has increasingly been acknowledged, and most interest has been directed to the state of Chu, in large part because of the wealth of archaeological evidence that is being unearthed there. As one develops a sensitivity for the culture of Chu, one senses deep resonances with the aesthetic sensibility of the Daoists, and with Zhuangzi\u2019s style in particular. The silks and bronzes of Chu, for example, are rich and vibrant; the patterns and images on fabrics and pottery are fanciful and naturalistic. However, while the evidence is persuasive, it is far from decisive.\n\nIf the traditional dating is reliable, then Zhuangzi would have been an almost exact contemporary of the Ruist thinker Mencius, though there is no clear evidence of communication between them. There are a few remarks in the Zhuangzi that could possibly be alluding to Mencius\u2019 philosophy, but there is nothing in the Mencius that shows any interest in Zhuangzi. The philosopher and statesman Hui Shi, or Huizi (\u201cMaster Hui,\u201d 380-305 BCE), is represented as a close friend of Zhuangzi, though decidedly unconvinced by his philosophical musings. There appears to have been a friendly rivalry between the broad and mythic-minded Zhuangzi and the politically motivated Huizi, who is critiqued in the text as a shortsighted paradox-monger. Despite their very deep philosophical distance, and Huizi\u2019s perceived limitations, Zhuangzi expresses great appreciation both for his linguistic abilities and for his friendship. The other \u201clogician,\u201d Gongsun Longzi, would also have been a contemporary of Zhuangzi, and although Zhuangzi does not, unfortunately, engage in any direct philosophical discussion with him, one does find what appears to be an occasional wink in his direction.\n\n2. The Zhuangzi Text\n\nThe currently extant text known as the Zhuangzi is the result of the editing and arrangement of the Jin dynasty thinker and commentator Guo Xiang (Kuo Hsiang, d. 312 CE). He reduced what was then a work in fifty-two chapters to the current edition of thirty-three chapters, excising material that he considered to be spurious. His commentary on the text provides an interpretation that has been one of the most influential over the subsequent centuries.\n\nGuo Xiang\u2019s thirty-three chapter edition of the text is divided into three collections, known as the Inner Chapters (Neipian), the Outer Chapters (Waipian), and the Miscellaneous Chapters (Zapian). The Inner Chapters are the first seven chapters and are generally considered to be the work of Zhuangzi himself. Because the evidence for this attribution is sparse and because of the miscellaneous nature of the editing, some scholars (McCraw, Klein) express skepticism that we can be sure which were the earliest passages or who they were written by. The Outer Chapters are chapters 8 to 22, and the Miscellaneous Chapters are chapters 23 to 33. The Outer and Miscellaneous Chapters can be further subdivided into different strands of Daoist thought. Much modern research has been devoted to a sub-classification of these chapters according to philosophical school. Kuan Feng made some scholarly breakthroughs early in the twentieth century; A. C. Graham continued his classification in the tradition of Kuan Feng. Harold Roth has also taken up a consideration of this issue and come up with some very interesting results. What follows is a simplified version of the results of the research of Liu Xiaogan.\n\nAccording to Liu, chapters 17 to 27 and 32 can be considered to be the work of a school of Zhuangzi\u2019s followers, what he calls the Shu Zhuang Pai, or the \u201cTransmitter\u201d school. Graham, following Kuan Feng, considers chapters 22 to 27 and 32 not to be coherent chapters, but merely random \u201cragbag\u201d collections of fragments. In fact, this miscellaneous character is characteristic of many, if not most, of the rest of the chapters, and complicates any simplistic classification of chapters as a whole. Liu considers chapters 8 to 10, chapters 28 to 31, and the first part of chapter 11 to be from a school of Anarchists whose philosophy is closely related to that of Laozi. Graham, again following Kuan Feng, sees these as two separate but related schools: the first he attributes to a writer he calls the \u201cPrimitivist,\u201d the second he considers to be a school of followers of Yang Zhu. Liu classifies chapters 12 to 16, chapter 33, and the first part of chapter 11 as belonging to the Han dynasty school known as Huang-Lao. Graham refers to them as the Syncretist chapters. Graham finds the classification of chapter 16 to be problematic. Chapter 30 does not seem to have any distinctively Daoist content at all. Though Graham thinks that it is consistent with the Yangist emphasis on preserving life, it is also consistent with Confucian and Mohist critiques of aggression.\n\nIn the following chart the further to the right the chapters are listed, the further away they are from the central ideas of the Zhuangzian philosophy of the Inner Chapters:\n\nThe Inner Chapters School of Zhuang Anarchist Utopianism Huang-Lao Syncretism 1.

Central Concepts in the \u201cInner Chapters\u201d\n\nThe following is an account of the central ideas of Zhuangzian philosophy, going successively through each of the seven Inner Chapters. This discussion is not confined to the content of the particular chapters, but rather represents a fuller articulation of the inter-relationships of the ideas between the Inner Chapters, and also between these ideas and those expressed in the Outer and Miscellaneous Chapters, where these appear to be related. References to \u201cZhuangzi\u201d below should not be taken as referring to a historical person, but rather as shorthand for the overall philosophy as articulated in the text of the Inner Chapters and related passages.\n\na. Chapter 1: Xiao Yao You (Wandering Beyond)\n\nThe title of the first chapter of the Zhuangzi has also been translated as \u201cFree and Easy Wandering\u201d and \u201cGoing Rambling Without a Destination.\u201d Both of these reflect the sense of the Daoist who is in spontaneous accord with the natural world, and who has retreated from the anxieties and dangers of social life, in order to live a healthy and peaceful natural life. In modern Mandarin, the word xiaoyao has thus come to mean \u201cfree, at ease, leisurely, spontaneous.\u201d It conveys the impression of people who have given up the hustle and bustle of worldly existence and have retired to live a leisurely life outside the city, perhaps in the natural setting of the mountains.\n\nBut this everyday expression is lacking a deeper significance that is expressed in the classical Chinese phrase: the sense of distance, or going beyond. As with all Zhuangzi\u2019s images, this is to be understood metaphorically. The second word, \u2018yao,\u2019 means \u2018distance\u2019 or \u2018beyond,\u2019 and here implies going beyond the boundaries of familiarity. We ordinarily confine ourselves within our social roles, expectations, and values, and with our everyday understandings of things. But this, according to Zhuangzi, is inadequate for a deeper appreciation of the natures of things, and for a more successful mode of interacting with them. We need at the very least to undo preconceptions that prevent us from seeing things and events in new ways; we need to see how we can structure and restructure the boundaries of things. But we can only do so when we ourselves have \u2018wandered beyond\u2019 the boundaries of the familiar. It is only by freeing our imaginations to reconceive ourselves, and our worlds, and the things with which we interact, that we may begin to understand the deeper tendencies of the natural transformations by which we are all affected, and of which we are all constituted. By loosening the bonds of our fixed preconceptions, we bring ourselves closer to an attunement to the potent and productive natural way (dao) of things.\n\nPaying close attention to the textual associations, we see that wandering is associated with the word wu, ordinarily translated \u2018nothing,\u2019 or \u2018without.\u2019 Related associations include: wuyou (no \u2018something\u2019) and wuwei (no interference). Roger Ames and David Hall have commented extensively on these wu expressions. Most importantly, they are not to be understood as simple negations, but have a much more complex function. The significance of all of these expressions must be traced back to the wu of Laozi: a type of negation that does not simply negate, but places us in a new kind of relation to \u2018things\u2019\u2014a phenomenological waiting that allows them to manifest, one that acknowledges the space that is the possibility of their coming to presence, one that appreciates the emptiness that is the condition of the possibility of their capacity to function, to be useful (as the hollow inside a house makes it useful for living). The behavior of one who wanders beyond becomes wuwei: sensitive and responsive without fixed preconceptions, without artifice, responding spontaneously in accordance with the unfolding of the inter-developing factors of the environment of which one is an inseparable part.\n\nBut it is not just the crossing of horizontal boundaries that is at stake. There is also the vertical distance that is important: one rises to a height from which formerly important distinctions lose what appeared to be their crucial significance. Thus arises the distinction between the great and the small, or the Vast (da) and the petty (xiao). Of this distinction Zhuangzi says that the petty cannot come up to the Vast: petty understanding that remains confined and defined by its limitations cannot match Vast understanding, the expansive understanding that wanders beyond. Now, while it is true that the Vast loses sight of distinctions noticed by the petty, it does not follow that they are thereby equalized, as Guo Xiang suggests. For the Vast still embraces the petty in virtue of its very vastness. The petty, precisely in virtue of its smallness, is not able to reciprocate.\n\nNow, the Vast that goes beyond our everyday distinctions also thereby appears to be useless. A soaring imagination may be wild and wonderful, but it is extremely impractical and often altogether useless. Indeed, Huizi, Zhuangzi\u2019s friend and philosophical foil, chides him for this very reason. But Zhuangzi expresses disappointment in him: for his inability to sense the use of this kind of uselessness is a kind of blindness of the spirit. The useless has use, only not as seen on the ordinary level of practical affairs. It has a use in the cultivation and nurturing of the \u2018shen\u2018 (spirit), in protecting the ancestral and preserving one\u2019s life, so that one can last out one\u2019s natural years and live a flourishing life. Now, this notion of a flourishing life is not to be confused with a \u2018successful\u2019 life: Zhuangzi is not impressed by worldly success. A flourishing life may indeed look quite unappealing from a traditional point of view. One may give up social ambition and retire in relative poverty to tend to one\u2019s shen and cultivate one\u2019s xing (nature, or life potency).\n\nTo summarize: When we wander beyond, we leave behind everything we find familiar, and explore the world in all its unfamiliarity. We drop the tools that we have been taught to use to tame the environment, and we allow it to teach us without words. We imitate its spontaneous behavior and we learn to respond immediately without fixed articulations.\n\nb. Chapter 2: Qi Wu Lun (Discussion on Smoothing Things Out)\n\nIf the Inner Chapters form the core of the Zhuangzi collection, then the Qi Wu Lun may be thought of as forming the core of the Inner Chapters. It is, at any rate, the most complex and intricate of the chapters of the Zhuangzi, with allusions and allegories, highly condensed arguments, and baffling metaphors juxtaposed without explanation. It appears to be concerned with the deepest and most \u2018abstract\u2019 understanding of ourselves, our lives, our world, our language, and indeed of our understanding itself. The most perplexing sections concern language and judgment, and are filled with paradox, sometimes even contradiction. But the contradictions are not easy to dismiss: their context indicates that they have a deep significance. In part, they appear to attempt to express an understanding about the limits of understanding itself, about the limits of language and thought.\n\nThis creates a problem for the interpreter, and especially for the translator. How do we deal with the contradictions? The most common solution is to paraphrase them so as to remove the direct contradictoriness, under the presupposition that no sense can be made of a contradiction. The most common way to remove the contradictions is to insert references to points of view. Those translators, such as A. C. Graham, who do this are following the interpretation of the Jin dynasty commentator Guo Xiang, who presents the philosophy as a form of relativism: apparently opposing judgments can harmonized when it is recognized that they are made from different perspectives.\n\nAccording to Guo Xiang\u2019s interpretation, each thing has its own place, its own nature (ziran); and each thing has its own value that follows from its own nature. If so, then nothing should be judged by values appropriate to the natures of other things. According to Guo Xiang, the vast and the small are equal in significance: this is his interpretation of the word \u201cqi\u201d in the title, \u201cequalization of all viewpoints\u201d. Now, such a radical relativism may have the goal of issuing a fundamental challenge to the status quo, arguing that the established values have no more validity than any of the minority values, no matter how shocking they may seem to us. In this way, its effect would be one of destabilization of the social structure. Here, however, we see another of the possible consequences of such a position: its inherent conservativeness. Guo Xiang\u2019s purpose in asserting this radical uniqueness and necessity of each position is conservative in this way. Indeed, it appears to be articulated precisely in response to those who oppose the traditional Ruist values of humanity and rightness (ren and yi) by claiming to have a superior mystical ground from which to judge them to be lacking. Guo Xiang\u2019s aim in asserting the equality of every thing, every position, and every function, is to encourage each thing, and each person, to accept its own place in the hierarchical system, to acknowledge its value in the functioning of the whole. In this way, radical relativism actually forestalls the possibility of radical critique altogether!\n\nAccording to this reading, the Vast perspective of the giant Peng bird is no better than the petty perspectives of the little birds who laugh at it. And indeed, Guo Xiang, draws precisely this conclusion. But there is a problem with taking this reading too seriously, and it is the kind of problem that plagues all forms of radical relativism when one attempts to follow them through consistently. Simply put, Zhuangzi would have to acknowledge that his own position is no better than those he appears to critique. He would have to acknowledge that his Daoist philosophy, indeed even this articulation of relativism, is no improvement over Confucianism after all, and that it is no less short-sighted than the logic-chopping of the Mohists. This, however, is a consequence that Zhuangzi does not recognize. This is surely an indication that the radical relativistic interpretation is clearly a misreading.\n\nRecently, some western interpreters (Lisa Raphals and Paul Kjellberg, for example) have focused their attention on aspects of the text that express affinities with the Hellenistic philosophy of Skepticism. Now, it is important not to confuse this with what in modern philosophy is thought of as a doctrine of skepticism, the most common form of which is the claim that we cannot ever claim to know anything, for at least the reason that we might always be wrong about anything we claim to know\u2014that is, because we can never know anything with absolute certainty. This is not quite the claim of the ancient Skeptics. Arguing from a position of fallibilism, these latter feel that we ought never to make any final judgments that go beyond the immediate evidence, or the immediate appearances. We should simply accept what appears at face value and have no further beliefs about its ultimate consequences, or its ultimate value. In particular, we should refrain from making judgments about whether it is good or bad for us. We bracket (epoche) these ultimate judgments. When we see that such things are beyond our ability to know with certainty, we will learn to let go of our anxieties and accept the things that happen to us with equanimity. Such a state of emotional tranquility they call \u2018ataraxia.\u2019\n\nNow, the resonances with Zhuangzi\u2019s philosophy are clear. Zhuangzi also accepts a form of fallibilism. While he does not refrain from making judgments, he nevertheless acknowledges that we cannot be certain that what we think of as good for us may not ultimately be bad for us, or that what we now think of as something terrible to be feared (death, for example) might not be an extraordinarily blissful awakening and a release from the toils and miseries of worldly life. When we accept this, we refrain from dividing things into the acceptable and the unacceptable; we learn to accept the changes of things in all their aspects with equanimity. In the Skeptical reading, the textual contradictions are also resolved by appealing to different perspectives from which different judgments appear to be true. Once one has learnt how to shift easily between the perspectives from which such different judgments can be made, then one can see how such apparently contradictory things can be true at the same time\u2014and one no longer feels compelled to choose between them.\n\nThere is, however, another way to resolve these contradictions, one that involves recognizing the importance of continuous transformation between contrasting phenomena and even between opposites. In the tradition of Laozi\u2019s cosmology, Zhuangzi\u2019s worldview is also one of seasonal transformations of opposites. The world is seen as a giant clod (da kuai) around which the heavens (tian) revolve about a polar axis (daoshu). All transformations have such an axis, and the aim of the sage is to settle into this axis, so that one may observe the changes without being buffeted around by them.\n\nNow, the theme of opposites is taken up by the Mohists, in their later Mohist Canon, but with a very different understanding. The later Mohists present a detailed analysis of judgments as requiring bivalence: that is judgments may be acceptable (ke) (also, \u2018affirmed\u2019 shi) or unacceptable (buke) (also \u2018rejected\u2019fei); they must be one or the other and they cannot be both. There must always be a clear distinction between the two. It is to this claim, I believe, that Zhuangzi is directly responding. Rejecting also the Mohist style of discussion, he appeals to an allusive, aphoristic, mythological style of poetic writing to upset the distinctions and blur the boundaries that the Mohists insist must be held apart. The Mohists believe that social harmony can only be achieved when we have clarity of distinctions, especially of evaluative distinctions: true/false, good/bad, beneficial/harmful. Zhuangzi\u2019s position is that this kind of sharp and rigid thinking can result ultimately only in harming our natural tendencies (xing), which are themselves neither sharp nor rigid. If we, on the contrary, learn to nurture those aspects of our heart-minds (xin), our natural tendencies (xing), that are in tune with the natural (tian) and ancestral (zong) within us, then we will eventually find our place at the axis of the way (daoshu) and will be able to ride the transformations of the cosmos free from harm. That is, we will be able to sense and respond to what can only be vaguely expressed without forcing it into gross and unwieldy verbal expressions. We are then able to recognize the paradoxes of vagueness and indeterminacy that arise from infinitesimal processes of transformation.\n\nPut another way, our knowledge and understanding (zhi, tong, da) are not just what we can explicitly see before us and verbalize: in modern terms, they are not just what is \u2018consciously,\u2019 \u2018conceptually,\u2019 or \u2018linguistically\u2019 available to us. Zhuangzi also insists on a level of understanding that goes beyond such relatively crude modes of dividing up our world and experiences. There are hidden modes of knowing, not evident or obviously present, modes that allow us to live, breathe, move, understand, connect with others without words, read our environments through subtle signs; these modes of knowing also give us tremendous skill in coping with others and with our environments. These modes of knowing Zhuangzi calls \u201cwuzhi\u201d, literally \u2018without knowing,\u2019 or \u2018unknowing\u2019. What is known by such modes of knowing, when we attempt to express it in words, becomes paradoxical and appears contradictory. It seems that bivalent distinctions leave out too much on either side of the divide: they are too crude a tool to cope with the subtlety and complexity of our non-conceptual modes of knowing. Zhuangzi, following a traditional folk psychology of his time, calls this capacity shenming: \u201cspirit insight.\u201d\n\nWhen we nurture that deepest and most natural, most ancestral part of our pysches, through psycho-physical meditative practices, we at the same time nurture these non-cognitive modes of understanding, embodied wisdoms, that enable us to deal successfully with our circumstances. It is then that we are able to cope directly with what from the limited perspective of our \u2018socialized\u2019 and \u2018linguistic\u2019 understanding seems to be too vague, too open, too paradoxical.\n\nc. Chapter 3: Yang Sheng Zhu (The Principle of Nurturing Life)\n\nThis chapter, like the Anarchist Utopian chapters, deals with the way to nurture and cultivate one\u2019s \u2018life tendencies\u2019 (sheng, xing) so as to enable one to live skillfully and last out one\u2019s natural years (zhong qi tian nian). There is a \u2018potency\u2019 within oneself that is a source of longevity, an ancestral place from which the phenomena of one\u2019s life continue to arise. This place is to be protected (bao), kept whole (quan), nurtured and cultivated (yang). The result is a sagely and skillful life. We must be careful how we understand this word, \u2018skill.\u2019 Zhuangzi takes pains to point out that it is no mere technique. A technique is a procedure that may be mastered, but the skill of the sage goes beyond this. One might say that it has become an \u2018art,\u2019 a dao. With Zhuangzi\u2019s conception, any physical activity, whether butchering a carcass, making wooden wheels, or carving beautiful ceremonial bell stands, becomes a dao when it is performed in a spiritual state of heightened awareness (\u2018attenuation\u2019 xu).\n\nZhuangzi sees civic involvement as particularly inimical to the preservation and cultivation of one\u2019s natural life. In order to cultivate one\u2019s natural potencies, one must retreat from social life, or at least one must retreat from the highly complex and artificially structured social life of the city. One undergoes a psycho-physical training in which one\u2019s sensory and physical capacities become honed to an extraordinary degree, indicating one\u2019s attunement with the transformations of nature, and thus highly responsive to the tendencies (xing) of all things, people, and processes. The mastery achieved is demonstrated (both metaphorically, and literally) by practical embodied skill. That is, practical embodied skill is also a metaphor representing the mastery of the life of the sage, and so it is also a sign of sagehood (though not all those who are skillful are to be reckoned as sages). Thus, we see many examples of individuals who have achieved extraordinary levels of excellence in their achievements\u2014practical, aesthetic, and spiritual. Butcher Ding provides an example of a practical, and very lowly skill; Liezi\u2019s teacher, Huzi, in chapter 7, provides an example of skill in controlling the very forces responsible for life themselves. Chapter 19, Mastering Life, is replete with examples: a cicada catcher, a ferryman, a carpenter, a swimmer, and Woodcarver Qing, whose aesthetic skill reaches \u2018magical\u2019 heights.\n\nd. Chapter 4: Ren Jian Shi (The Realm of Human Interactions)\n\nIn this chapter, Zhuangzi continues the theme broached in the last chapter, but now takes on the problem of how to maintain and preserve one\u2019s life and last out one\u2019s years while living in the social realm, especially in circumstances of great danger: a life of civic engagement in a time of social corruption.\n\nThe Daoists, especially the authors of the anarchistic utopian chapters, are highly critical of the artificiality required to create and sustain complex social structures. The Daoists are skeptical of the ability of deliberate planning to deal with the complexities of the world within which our social structures have their place. Even the developments of the social world when left to themselves are \u2018natural\u2019 developments, and as such escape the confines of planned, structured thinking. The more we try to control and curtail these natural meanderings, the more complicated and unwieldy the social structures become. According to the Daoists, no matter how complex we make our structures, they will never be fully able to cope with the fluid flexibility of natural changes. The Daoists perceive the unfolding of the transformations of nature as exhibiting a kind of natural intelligence, a wisdom that cannot be matched by deliberate artificial thinking, thinking that can be articulated in words. The result is that phenomena guided by such artificial structures quickly lose their course, and have to be constantly regulated, re-calibrated. This need gives rise to the development and articulation of the artificial concepts of ren and yi for the Ruists, and shi and fei for the Mohists.\n\nThe Ruists emphasize the importance of cultivating the values of ren \u2018humanity\u2019 and yi \u2018appropriateness/rightness.\u2019 The Mohists identify a bivalent structure of preference and evaluation, shifei. Our judgments can be positive or negative, and these arise out of our acceptance and rejection of things or of judgments, and these in turn arise out of our emotional responses to the phenomena of benefit and harm, that is, pleasure and pain. Thus, we set up one of two types of systems: the intuitive renyi morality of the Ruists, or the articulated structured shifei of the Mohists.\n\nZhuangzi sees both of these as dangerous. Neither can keep up with the complex transformations of things and so both will result in harm to our shen and xing. They lead to the desire of rulers to increase their personal profit, their pleasure, and their power, and to do so at the expense of others. The best thing is to steer clear of such situations. But there are times when one cannot do so: there is nothing one can do to avoid involvement in a social undertaking. There are also times\u2014if one has a Ruist sensibility\u2014when one will be moved to do what one can and must in order to improve the social situation. Zhuangzi makes up a story about Confucius\u2019 most beloved and most virtuous follower, Yen Hui, who feels called to help \u2018rectify\u2019 the King of a state known for his selfishness and brutality.\n\nZhuangzi thinks that such a motivation, while admirable, is ultimately misguided. There is little to nothing one can do to change things in a corrupt world. But if you really have to try, then you should be aware of the dangers, be aware of the natures of things, and of how they transform and develop. Be on the lookout for the \u2018triggers\u2019: the critical junctures at which a situation can explode out of hand. In the presence of danger, do not confront it: always dance to one side, redirect it through skilled and subtle manipulations, that do not take control, but by adding their own weight appropriately, redirect the momentum of the situation. One must treat all dangerous social undertakings as a Daoist adept: one must perform xinzhai, fasting of the heart-mind. This is a psycho-physical discipline of attenuation, in which one nurtures one\u2019s inner potencies by thinning out one\u2019s personal preferences and keeping one\u2019s emotions in check, so that one may achieve a heightened sensitivity to the tendencies of things. One then responds with the skill of a sage to the dangerous moods and intentions of one\u2019s worldly ruler.\n\ne. Chapter 5: De Chong Fu (Signs of the Flourishing of Potency)\n\nThis chapter is populated with a collection of characters with bodily eccentricities: criminals with amputated feet, people born with \u2018ugly\u2019 deformities, hunchbacks with no lips. Perhaps some of these are moralistic advisors, like those of chapter 4, who were unsuccessful in bringing virtue and harmony to a corrupt state, and instead received the harsh punishment of their offended ruler. But it is also possible that some were born with these physical \u2018deformities.\u2019 As the Commander of the Right says in chapter 3, \u201cWhen tian (nature) gave me life, it saw to it that I would be one footed.\u201d These then are people whose natural capacity (de) has been twisted somehow, redirected, so that it gives them a potency (de) that is beyond the normal human range. At any rate, this out of the ordinary appearance, this extraordinary physical form, is a sign of something deeper: a potency and a power (de) that connects them more closely to the ancestral source. These are the sages that Zhuangzi admires: those whose virtue (de) is beyond the ordinary, and whose signs of virtue indicate that they have gone beyond.\n\nBut what goes beyond is also the source of life. To hold fast to that which is beyond both living and dying, is perhaps also to hold fast to something more primordial that is beyond human and inhuman. To identify with and nurture this source is to nurture that which is at the root of our humanity. If so, then one does not necessarily become inhuman. Indeed, one might argue that this creates the possibility of deepening one\u2019s most genuine humanity, insofar as this is a deeper nature still.\n\nf. Chapter 6: Da Zong Shi (The Vast Ancestral Teacher)\n\nThe first part of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of the zhenren: the \u201cgenuine person,\u201d or \u201cgenuine humanity,\u201d (or in older translations, \u201cTrue Man\u201d). It begins by asking about the relation between tian and ren, the natural/heaven and the human, and suggests that the greatest wisdom lies in the ability to understand both. Thus, to be forced to choose between being natural or being human is a mistake. A genuinely flourishing human life cannot be separated from the natural, but nor can it on that account deny its own humanity. Genuine humanity is natural humanity.\n\nThere are several sections devoted to explicating this genuine humanity. We find that the genuinely human person, the zhen ren, is in tune with the cycles of nature, and is not upset by the vicissitudes of life. The zhenren like Laozi\u2019s sage is somehow simultaneously unified with things, and yet not tied down by them. The zhenren is in tune with the cycles of nature, and with the cycles of yin yang, and is not disturbed or harmed by them. In fact, the zhenren is not harmed by them either in what appears to us to be their negative phases, nor are their most extreme phases able to upset the balance of the zhenren. This is sometimes expressed with what I take to be the hyperbole that the sage or zhenren can never be drowned by the ocean, nor burned by fire.\n\nIn the second part of the chapter, Zhuangzi hints at the process by which we are to cultivate our genuine and natural humanity. These are meditative practices and psycho-physical disciplines\u2014\u201dyogas\u201d perhaps\u2014by which we learn how to nourish the ancestral root of life that is within us. We learn how to identify with that center which functions as an axis of stability around which the cycles of emotional turbulence flow. By maintaining ourselves as a shifting and responding center of gravity we are able to maintain an equanimity without giving up our feelings altogether. We enjoy riding the dragon without being thrown around by it. Ordinarily, we are buffeted around like flotsam in a storm, and yet, by holding fast to our ancestral nature, and by following the nature of the environment\u2014by \u201cmatching nature with nature\u201d\u2014we free ourselves from the mercy of random circumstances.\n\nIn this chapter we see a mature development of the ideas of life and death broached in the first three chapters. Zhuangzi continues musing on the significance of our existential predicament as being inextricably tied into interweaving cycles of darkness and light, sadness and joy, living and dying. In chapter two, it was the predicament itself that Zhuangzi described, and he tried to focus on the inseparability and indistinguishability of the two aspects of this single process of transformation. In this chapter, Zhuangzi tries to delve deeper to reach the center of balance, the \u2018axis of the way,\u2019 that allows one to undergo these changes with tranquility, and even to accept them with a kind of \u2018joy.\u2019 Not an ecstatic affirmation, to be sure, but a tranquil appreciation of the richness, beauty, and \u201cinevitability\u201d of whatever experiences we eventually will undergo. Again, not that we must experience whatever is \u2018fated\u2019 for us, or that we ought not to minimize harm and suffering where we can do so, but only that we should acknowledge and accept our situatedness, our thrownness into our situation, as the \u2018raw materials\u2019 that we have to deal with.\n\nThere are mystical practices hinted at that enable the sage to identify with the datong, the greater flow, not with the particular arisings of these particular emotions, or this particular body, but with what lies within (and below and above) as their ancestral root. These meditative and yogic practices are hinted at in this chapter, and also in chapter 7, but nothing in the text reveals what they are. It is not unreasonable to believe that similar techniques have been handed down by the practitioners of religious Daoism. It is clear, nonetheless, that part of the change is a change in self-understanding, self-identification. We somehow learn to expand, to wander beyond, our boundaries until they include the entire cosmic process. This entire process is seen as like a potter\u2019s wheel, and simultaneously as a whetstone and as a grindstone, on which things are formed, and arise, sharpened, and are ground back down only to be made into new forms. With each \u2018birth\u2019 (sheng) some \u2018thing\u2019 (wu) new arises, flourishes, develops through its natural (tian) tendencies (xing), and then still following its natural tendencies, responding to those of its natural environment, it winds down: enters (ru) back into the undifferentiated (wu) from which it emerged (chu). The truest friendship arises when members of a community identify with this unknown undifferentiated process in which they are embedded, \u201cforgotten\u201d differences between self and other, and spontaneously follows the natural developments of which they are inseparable \u201cparts.\u201d\n\ng. Chapter 7: Ying Di Wang (Responding to Emperors and Kings)\n\nThe last of the Inner Chapters does not introduce anything new, but closes by returning to a recurring theme from chapters 1, 3, 5, and 6: that of withdrawing from society. This \u2018withdrawal\u2019 has two functions: the first is to preserve one\u2019s \u2018life\u2019; the second is to allow society to function naturally, and thus to bring itself to a harmonious completion. Rather than interfering with social interactions, one should allow them to follow their natural course, which, Zhuangzi believes, will be both imaginative and harmonious.\n\nThese themes resonate with those of the Anarchist chapters in the Outer (and Miscellaneous) chapters: 8 to 11a and 28 to 32. These encourage a life closer to nature in which one lets go of deliberate control and instead learns how to sense the tendencies of things, allowing them to manifest and flourish, while also adding one\u2019s weight to redirect their momentum away from harm and danger. Or, if harm and danger are unavoidable, then one learns how to minimize them, and how to accept whatever one does have to suffer with equanimity.\n\n4. Key Interpreters of Zhuangzi\n\nThe earliest of the interpreters of Zhuangzi\u2019s philosophy are of course his followers, whose commentaries and interpretations have been preserved in the text itself, in the chapters that Liu Xiaogan ascribes to the \u201cShu Zhuang Pai,\u201d chapters 17 to 27. Most of these chapters constitute holistic developments of the ideas of the Inner Chapters, but some of them concentrate on particular issues raised in particular chapters. For example, the author of Chapter 17, the Autumn Floods, elaborates on the philosophy of perspective and overcoming boundaries that is discussed in the first chapter, Xiao Yao You. This chapter develops the ideas in several divergent directions: relativism, skepticism, pragmatism, and even a kind of absolutism. Which of these, if any, is the overall philosophical perspective is not easy to discern. The author of chapter 19, Da Sheng, Mastering Life, takes up the theme of the cultivation of the wisdom of embodied skill that is introduced in chapter 3, Yang Sheng Zhu, The Principle of Nurturing Life. The author of chapter 18, Zhi Le, Utmost Happiness, and chapter 22, Zhi Bei You, Knowledge Wanders North, continues the meditations on life and death, and the cultivation of meditative practice, that are explored in chapter 6, Da Zong Shi, The Vast Ancestral Teacher.\n\nThe next group of interpreters have also become incorporated into the extant version of the text. They are the school of philosophers inclined towards anarchist utopias, that Graham identifies as a \u201cPrimitivist\u201d and a school of \u201cYangists,\u201d chapters 8 to 11, and 28 to 31. These thinkers appear to have been profoundly influenced by the Laozi, and also by the thought of the first and last of the Inner Chapters: \u201cWandering Beyond,\u201d and \u201cResponding to Emperors and Kings.\u201d There are also possible signs of influence from Yang Zhu, whose concern was to protect and cultivate one\u2019s inner life-source. These chapters combine the anarchistic ideals of a simple life close to nature that can be found in the Laozi with the practices that lead to the cultivation and nurturing of life. The practice of the nurturing of life in chapter 3, that leads to the \u201clasting out of one\u2019s natural years,\u201d becomes an emphasis on maintaining and protecting xing ming zhi qing \u201cthe essentials of nature and life\u2019s command\u201d in these later chapters.\n\nThe third main group, whose interpretation has been preserved in the text itself, is the Syncretist school, an eclectic school whose aim to is promote an ideal of mystical rulership, influenced by the major philosophical schools of the time, especially those that recommend a cultivation of inner potency. They may or may not be exemplary of the so-called \u2018Huang-Lao\u2019 school. They scoured the earlier philosophers in order to extract what was valuable in their philosophies, the element of the dao that is to be found in each philosophical claim. In particular, they sought to combine the more \u2018mystically\u2019 inclined philosophies with the more practical ones to create a more complete dao. The last chapter, Tian Xia, The World, considers several philosophical schools, and comments on what is worthwhile in each of them. Zhuangzi\u2019s philosophy is here characterized as \u201cvast,\u201d \u201cvague,\u201d \u201coutrageous,\u201d \u201cextravagant,\u201d and \u201creckless\u201d; he is also recognized for his encompassing modes of thought, his lack of partisanship, and his recklessness is acknowledged to be harmless. Nevertheless, it is stated that he did not succeed in getting it all.\n\nPerhaps the most important of the pre-Qin thinkers to comment on Zhuangzi is Xunzi. In his \u201cDispelling Obsessions\u201d chapter, anticipating the eclecticism of the Huang-Lao commentators of chapter 33, he considers several philosophical schools, mentions the corner of \u2018truth\u2019 that each has recognized, and then goes on to criticize them for failing to understand the larger picture. Xunzi mentions Zhuangzi by name, describes him as a philosopher who recognizes the value of nature and of following the tendencies of nature, but who thereby fails to recognize the value of the human \u2018ren\u2019. Indeed, Zhuangzi seems to be aware of this kind of objection, and even delights in it. He revels in knowing that he is one who wanders off into the distance, far from human concerns, one who is not bound by the guidelines. Perhaps in doing so he corroborates Xunzi\u2019s fears.\n\nAnother text that reveals what might be a development of Zhuangzi\u2019s philosophy is the Liezi. This is a philosophical treatise that clearly stands in the same tradition as the Zhuangzi, dealing with many of the same issues, and on occasion with almost identical stories and discussions. Although the Daoist adept, Liezi, to whom the text is attributed is said to have lived before Zhuangzi, the text clearly dates from a later period, perhaps compiled as late as the Eastern Han, though in terms of linguistic style the material appears to date from around the same period as Zhuangzi. The Liezi continues the line of philosophical thinking of the Xiao Yao You, and the Qiu Shui, taking up the themes of transcending boundaries, and even cosmic realms, by spirit journeying. The leaving behind and overturning of human values is a theme that is repeated in this text, though again not without a certain paradoxical tension: after all, the purpose of such journeying and overturning of values is ultimately to enable us in some sense to live \u2018better\u2019 lives. While Zhuangzi\u2019s own philosophy exerted a significant influence on the interpretation of Buddhism in China, theLiezi appears to provide a possible converse case of Mahayana Buddhist influence on the development of the ideas of Zhuangzi.\n\nThe Jin dynasty scholar, Guo Xiang, is one of the most influential of the early interpreters. His \u201crelativistic\u201d reading of the text has become the received interpretation, and his own distinctive style of philosophical thinking has in this way become almost inseparable from that of Zhuangzi. The task of interpreting Zhuangzi independently of Guo Xiang\u2019s reading is not easy to accomplish. His contribution and interpretation have already been discussed in the body of the entry (See sections above: The Zhuangzitext, and Chapter 2: Qi Wu Lun (Discussion on Smoothing Things Out) ). The Sui dynasty scholar, Lu Deming, produced an invaluable glossary and philological commentary on the text, enabling later generations to benefit from his vast linguistic expertise. The Ming dynasty Buddhist poet and scholar, Han Shan, wrote a commentary on the Zhuangzi from a Chan Buddhist perspective. In a similar vein, the Qing dynasty scholar, Zhang Taiyan, constructed a masterful interpretation of the Zhuangzi in the light of Chinese Buddhist Idealism, or Weishilun. Guo Qingfan, a late Qing, early twentieth century scholar, collected and synthesized the work of previous generations of commentators. The scholarly work of Takeushi Yoshio in Japan has also been of considerable influence. Qian Mu is a twentieth century scholar who has exerted considerable efforts with regard to historical scholarship. Currently, in Taiwan, Chen Guying is the leading scholar and interpreter of Zhuangzi, and he uses his knowledge of western philosophy, particularly western epistemology, cosmology, and metaphysics, to throw new light on this ancient text.\n\nIn the west, probably the most important and influential scholar was A. C. Graham, whose pioneering work on this text, and on the later Mohist Canon, has laid the groundwork and set an extraordinarily high standard for future western philosophical scholarship. Graham, following the reading of Guo Xiang, develops a relativistic reading based on a theory of the conventional nature of language. Chad Hansen is a current interpreter who sees the Daoists as largely theorists of language, and he interprets Zhuangzi\u2019s own contribution as a form of \u201clinguistic skepticism.\u201d Recently, there has been a growth of interest in the aspects of Zhuangzi\u2019s philosophy that resonate with the Hellenistic school of Skepticism. This was proposed by Paul Kjellberg, and has been pursued by other scholars such as Lisa Raphals.\n\n5. References and Further Reading\n\nAmes, Roger, ed. Wandering at Ease in the Zhuangzi.
