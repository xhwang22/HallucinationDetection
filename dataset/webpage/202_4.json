This diverse spectrum of objects were all donated to museums by George Hubbard Clapp (1858-1949), an aluminum industry pioneer whose collecting across art and science made him something of a modern-day Renaissance man.\n\nThis exhibition focuses on a collection of drawings that Clapp donated to the University in 1941. Dating from the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries, Pitt students have conducted in-depth research that sheds new light on these mysterious drawings. The Curious Drawings of Doctor Clapp provides a rare opportunity to inspect early modern drawings in Pittsburgh and provides a fascinating glimpse into the history of collecting.\n\nCurated by the students of HAA1030 (Spring 2019) and HAA1020 (Fall 2019).\n\nSupported by The Fine Foundation"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/george.clapp/2302796", "page_content": "George Clapp\n\nZoologist\n\nDecember 14, 1858 (age 90) Allegheny City, Pennsylvania , United States\n\nClapp took an engineering position at Park Brothers\" Black Diamond Steel Works.
