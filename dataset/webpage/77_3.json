He was cofounder in 1991 of Tectonic Theater Project, a company dedicated to examining the structure and language of theatre as well as addressing contemporary social issues.\n\nKaufman was born in Venezuela to Orthodox Jewish parents and was of Ukrainian and Romanian descent. He attended a yeshiva (Jewish religious school) as a child and was exposed to broader culture on family trips to New York City. A Caracas theatre festival he attended as a young teenager brought him exposure to the avant-garde plays of such artists as Peter Brook, Tadeusz Kantor, Pina Bausch, and Jerzy Grotowski, whom he cited as his early influences. While attending Metropolitan University in Caracas (B.A. in business administration, 1985), Kaufman joined a touring experimental theatre group as an actor. In 1987 he moved to New York City, where he studied theatre directing at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, meanwhile directing a variety of plays. It was at NYU that he honed his ideas about the purpose and most-effective means of presenting theatrical performances. Four years later Kaufman, together with his partner, Jeffrey LaHoste, established Tectonic Theater Project.\n\nKaufman\u2019s writing debut, Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde (performed 1997\u201398, published 1997), illustrated his concerns as a writer-director. He was especially interested in what he termed \u201cwatershed historical moments,\u201d events that reveal the foundations of society\u2019s beliefs. A powerful and moving play that used actual trial testimony, Gross Indecency won an Outer Critics Circle Award for outstanding Off-Broadway play. Kaufman and his troupe then began work on The Laramie Project (performed 2000, published 2001, television movie 2002), interviewing numerous residents of the small Wyoming city in which gay college student Matthew Shepard had been brutally murdered. The play had particular resonance with Kaufman, who was gay, and it proved popular throughout the world.\n\nIn 2003 Kaufman directed a one-man show, Doug Wright\u2019s I Am My Own Wife: Studies for a Play About Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (performed 2003\u201304), the story of a gay transvestite who survived life in Nazi Germany and Soviet East Berlin. It was critically acclaimed and resulted in a Tony Award nomination for Kaufman. In the next several years Kaufman directed a variety of plays, including Wilde\u2019s Lady Windermere\u2019s Fan and Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth. He also directed his own play 33 Variations (first performed 2007), starring Jane Fonda as a musicologist obsessed with Beethoven\u2019s Diabelli Variations, and received another Tony nomination. In 2009 Kaufman and other Tectonic members arranged for 150 simultaneous readings in theatres across the globe of a sequel, The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later. He also directed Rajiv Joseph\u2019s Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo (performed 2011), starring Robin Williams as the title character; a 2012\u201313 revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz\u2019s The Heiress, a play based on Henry James\u2019s novel Washington Square; and a revival of Torch Song (2018\u201319), which was written by Harvey Fierstein. In 2016 Kaufman received the National Medal of Arts."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/16/us/moises-kaufman-stonewall-50.html", "page_content": "Merely a year later, some 5,000 activists held the first pride march in New York City \u2014 with similar marches held in Chicago and Los Angeles.

We must make ourselves known.\u201d\n\nCamus also states in his book that \u201cin every act of rebellion,\u201d the rebel experiences a \u201ccomplete and spontaneous loyalty to certain aspects of himself.\u201d Just four years after the riots, in 1973, we said \u201cno\u201d to the American Psychiatric Association, and its leaders at long last removed the diagnosis of homosexuality from its official list of mental illnesses.\n\nThe next year, 1974, we said \u201cno\u201d to being politically powerless when Elaine Noble, the first out lesbian to run for a state-level political office, was elected to the Massachusetts State Legislature. And, famously, in 1977, an openly gay man, Harvey Milk, was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.\n\nBut as the battle went on, and as the character of the homosexual was being redrawn in revolt, 1981 brought about the first cases of the AIDS epidemic. And the death toll \u2014 and the country\u2019s initial refusal to respond to it \u2014 brought to the surface the depth of homophobia, transphobia and other queer-centered bigotry in the American psyche.\n\nA radical rethinking of tactics and actions was needed, and a new kind of gay activist was born.

The son of a Holocaust survivor, he was raised in an Orthodox Jewish family in a conservative, deeply Roman Catholic country \u2013 which led to profound feelings of isolation.\n\n\u201cThe difficulty was that there were no role models,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cBut I remember very vividly the first time I found the word \u2018homosexual\u2019 in the dictionary and being delighted, because I thought there must be one other person in the world who is homosexual because there is a word for it.\u201d\n\nToday Mois\u00e9s Kaufman, 52, is one of the most acclaimed playwrights and directors in the American theater.\n\nIn September, Kaufman was among a select group of Americans honored at the White House with the highly prestigious National Medal of the Arts. He termed the experience \u201cexciting\u201d because of his fellow honorees. \u201cSome of those people are people I have admired all my life, like Mel Brooks, Sandra Cisneros,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was really a great sense of camaraderie between all of the recipients.

He founded his theater company, The Tectonic Theater Project, in 1991 with his now-husband Jeffrey LaHoste.\n\n\u201cWe started it in the dining room of our apartment. The first four years, we were performing in church basements,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cOften there were more people onstage than in the house.\u201d\n\nRELATED: These Latinos Were Honored with National Medals for Art, Humanities\n\nThe Tectonic Theater Project uses a unique process for conceiving and reimagining theater known as \u201cMoment Work.\u201d It enables actors, writers, designers, and directors to collaborate in creative storytelling.\n\nVenezuelan-born playwright/director. Moises Kaufman. The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images\n\nUsing this technique, Kaufman wrote and directed Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde in 1997. This off-Broadway play, which The New York Times called \u201cabsolutely gripping,\u201d utilized actual testimony and transcripts from the trials of the iconic Wilde. Kaufman won a Lambda Literary Award, an award given for works that explore LGBT themes, for \"Gross Indecency\" in 1998.\n\nThat same year, just three months after the brutal murder of gay student Matthew Shepard, Kaufman took his theater group to Laramie, Wyoming to interview people in the town where the killing had taken place. They conducted over 200 interviews, totaling 400 hours, and the company then used these oral histories to write The Laramie Project.\n\n\u201cThe community was in shock,\u201d Kaufman recalled. \u201cThey never expected a murder like that to occur in their midst. We managed to capture, I think, something of the rawness and the experience the town was having at that time.\u201d\n\nKaufman and his siblings. Moises Kaufman\n\nActress Mercedes Herrero, who collaborated in the creation of \"The Laramie Project,\" described the process as \u201cpretty extraordinary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came from the Stanislavski (acting) tradition,\u201d Herrero said. \u201cMois\u00e9s was using this experimental form, not only gathering interviews, but also literally writing current events as they were happening. This was a new kind of theater to me, and it was mind-blowing.\u201d Herrero, who co-stars in House of Cards, added that working with Kaufman has made her \u201ca more politically aware being.\u201d\n\n\"The Laramie Project,\" about the town\u2019s reaction to Shepard\u2019s brutal killing, went on to become one of the most acclaimed plays of the year, and one of the most-produced works of the decade. It has been performed worldwide, and is often used to educate people about homophobia and anti-LGBT violence. It was also made into an HBO film written and directed by Kaufman.\n\nJudy Shepard, the mother of Matthew Shepard, told NBC News that \"The Laramie Project\" was very special to her. \u201cI think everybody can relate to an actor who is on stage. The audience is seeing somebody who is like them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt brings home how differently we all feel about things, and how we respond to things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt (the play) is not specifically about Matt,\u201d Shepard pointed out. \u201cBut it shows how society looks when we don\u2019t accept each other for who we are. It shows what happens when we are at odds with each other for no reason.\u201d\n\nShepard said that she hears from people all over the country who have \u201ccome out\u201d as LGBT after seeing or having been a part of the play.\n\n\u201cPeople say to me, are you a Latino writer? Are you a gay writer? Are you a Jewish writer? And I say yes to all.\"\n\n\u201cMois\u00e9s has absolutely moved the needle in terms of how people view bullying and hate crimes against LGBT people,\u201d said Shepard.\n\nKaufman and his theater company revisited Laramie to produce The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later in 2008.\n\nIn 2003, Kaufman directed the Pulitzer Prize- and Tony Award-winning play I Am My Own Wife on Broadway. Also on Broadway, in 2009 he directed Jane Fonda in 33 Variations, and Robin Williams in Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo in 2011. Kaufman\u2019s most recent Broadway show was a 2012-2013 revival of The Heiress, starring Jessica Chastain.\n\nGlenn Davis, Brad Fleischer, playwright Rajiv Joseph, Robin Willams, director Moises Kaufman, Arian Moayed & Hrach Titizian during the Broadway Opening Night Curtain Call for 'Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo' at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York City.

When \"The Laramie Project\" was first being produced at colleges, there were protests from people who claimed it was being used to recruit students into homosexuality. Last year, Russia cut off funding for a production of \"Gross Indecency\" at the Moscow New Drama Theater because of its gay themes.\n\nBroadway writer/director Moises Kaufman as a young actor. Moises Kaufman\n\nKaufman is currently working on an adaptation of the opera \"Carmen,\" and has several events planned for this fall. On November 7, Jane Fonda will host the 25th anniversary gala for the Tectonic Theater Project. The event will feature celebrities reading excerpts from Tectonic\u2019s plays, including The Laramie Project and 33 Variations.\n\nOn November 10, Kaufman will be presented with the American Artist Award by Arena Stage in Washington D.C.\n\nThe Artistic Director of Arena Stage, Molly Smith, said that she was proud to have known Kaufman for almost two decades. \u201cI watched him in the initial stages of developing \"The Laramie Project.\" I have been so moved by his combination of theater, social commentary, and political fervor in the projects he has taken on,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe is a bold theater artist, and I think our audience loves that.\u201d\n\nWhen Barack Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, Smith noted, the president had Kaufman there as a recognition of the impact of his work.\n\nSmith also mentioned that Kaufman was \u201cone of the most gracious and warm individuals you could ever meet.\u201d\n\nThroughout his career, Kaufman has dealt with issues of identity. \u201cPeople say to me, are you a Latino writer? Are you a gay writer? Are you a Jewish writer? And I say yes to all,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I am any good at what I do, then I\u2019m a Latino writer and I am a Jewish writer and I\u2019m a gay writer, and I\u2019m a New York writer. And I\u2019m a writer of all the things that I am as a human being.\u201d\n\nStill, Kaufman said that LGBT youth continue to face challenging circumstances as they grow up. \u201cAnyone who has ever had the experience of coming out will tell you that it is a process. It is a process for the person coming out, and for the people you are coming out to,\u201d he said. In his case, he explained, because his work dealt so publicly with issues of gender and sexuality, his parents had to learn how to deal with it.\n\nA picture of Moises Kaufman and his father Jose. Moises Kaufman\n\nAlthough Kaufman describes his mother and late father as \u201cvery proud and supportive\u201d of his work, he stressed that young LGBT kids often struggle with acceptance. \u201cThe question of whether things are getting better for LGBT youth is a complicated one,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, yes, they are getting better. Having said that, there is an epidemic of bullying in high school, especially against LGBT kids,\u201d Kaufman continued, mentioning the high rates of suicide and depression among LGBT youth.\n\n\u201cSo I think that yes, things are getting better,\" said the playwright. \"But there is still a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nFollow NBC News Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."}, {"url": "https://howlround.com/commons/moises-kaufman", "page_content": "Mois\u00e9s Kaufman is the founder and artistic director of Tectonic Theater Project, an award-winning director and playwright, and an activist-in-art.

Mois\u00e9s is an Obie and Lucille Lortel award winner, a 2002 Guggenheim Fellow in Playwriting, winner of the 2002 Humanitas Prize, and has been nominated for Tony, Emmy, and Drama Desk awards. He was awarded the 2015 National Medal of Arts from President Barack Obama, which he accepted in a ceremony at the White House in September 2016.\n\nMois\u00e9s was born in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1963, and he grew up surrounded by the city\u2019s thriving international performance scene. He studied with several theater companies at home and then, in 1987, moved to New York City to complete his education at New York University. He attended NYU\u2019s groundbreaking Experimental Theatre Wing, where he deepened his investigation of the role of text in the creative process and his love of challenge in theatrical structure. When he finished school in 1991, Mois\u00e9s founded Tectonic Theater Project with his husband, Jeff LaHoste. Many of their first collaborators came from Mois\u00e9s\u2019s artistic circle at the Experimental Theatre Wing.\n\nTectonic\u2019s early productions were a natural expansion upon the themes that had absorbed Mois\u00e9s in his studies: structurally difficult plays demanding extensive problem-solving in stagecraft. He found his path to creative maturity, though, in applying that passion for form and experimentation to his own new work, most notably 1997\u2019s critically acclaimed Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde, which ran off-Broadway for a year and a half. Gross Indecency gained Mois\u00e9s and the company national recognition and its success enabled them to travel to Laramie, Wyoming to pursue their next undertaking.\n\nThat next work, The Laramie Project (which Mois\u00e9s wrote in collaboration with members of Tectonic after an extensive community-based research process), is an examination of the cultural conflict surrounding the 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard. It opened at the Denver Theater Center in March 2000 and moved to New York shortly thereafter. TIME called Laramie \u201cone of the 10 best plays of 2000,\u201d and it was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience. It was also recently selected by the New York Times as one of their \u201c25 Best American Plays Since \u2018Angels in America\u2019\u201d and remains among the most performed plays in the United States. In 2002, Mois\u00e9s co-wrote and directed HBO\u2019s film adaptation of The Laramie Project, which garnered two Emmy Award nominations\u2014Best Director and Best Writer.\n\nIn the years since Gross Indecency first brought his methods to wider attention, Mois\u00e9s has continued to refine his devising process with Tectonic, always with an aim toward using the powers unique to theater to explore primary sources and understand underrepresented stories\u2014old and new. His writing and adaptation credits include 33 Variations (2007), The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later (2008), One Arm (2011), and Carmen (2013-2016); as artistic director he has also guided the development of Anushka Paris-Carter and Andy Paris\u2019s Uncommon Sense (2017).\n\nMois\u00e9s is also a dedicated teacher. Since 2000, he and the company\u2019s teaching artists have been sharing Tectonic\u2019s techniques in lectures, training labs, and educational residencies. In 2018, he co-wrote Moment Work: Tectonic Theater Project\u2019s Process of Devising (Vintage), a comprehensive introduction to his theatrical principles and the company\u2019s creative tools.\n\nOn Broadway, Mois\u00e9s has directed the 2012 revival of The Heiress with Jessica Chastain, the Tony-nominated 33 Variations with Jane Fonda , Rajiv Joseph\u2019s Pulitzer Prize finalist Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo with Robin Williams, and Doug Wright\u2019s Pulitzer- and Tony Award-winning I Am My Own Wife with Jefferson Mays.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Seven years ago, Mois\u00e9s Kaufman was approached to direct the Broadway musical \u201cParadise Square\u201d and, after reading it, he immediately said yes.\n\n\u201cI did this show because it spoke to me,\u201d the Venezuelan theater director and playwright says. \u201cSo much of my work occurs at the intersection of the personal and the political. I like to look at history through the eyes of the other, through the eye of the person that doesn\u2019t get to tell their story.\u201d\n\nNow \u201cParadise Square\u201d \u2014 about unity and racism in New York\u2019s notorious Five Points neighborhood, where Irish immigrants and Black Americans jostled to survive in the years before the Civil War \u2014 is nominated for 10 Tony Awards, including best musical, best lead actress for Joaquina Kalukango, and best featured actor for both Sidney DuPont and A.J. Shively.\n\nDuring a recent interview with The Associated Press, Kaufman, himself an immigrant based in New York City, reflected on immigration and the roots of American divisions.\n\n\u201cImmigration is a great fallacy, because you never leave the country where you were born, and you never arrive in the country where you land. Your being is always divided, part of you is there and part of you is here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe founder of Tectonic Theater Project \u2014 best known for \u201cThe Laramie Project\u201d and who has received awards including the National Medal of Arts \u2014 also spoke about the relevance of the show today and the powerhouse that is Kalukango as the courageous bar owner Nelly O\u2019Brien.\n\nRemarks have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\n___\n\nAP: You have directed plays on Broadway, but this is your first Broadway musical. Did you expect \u201cParadise Square\u201d to get 10 nominations?\n\nKAUFMAN: No, I did not expect it. It was a great joy to hear that and to get that, and it\u2019s been really rewarding! I did this show because it spoke to me. I don\u2019t know, something about looking at America through the eyes of that community, a community where Irish immigrants and Black natives were getting married and living together and doing business together in 1863! When in the South, Black people were still slaves, here there was a community where people were living and loving together. It spoke to me.\n\nAP: You are also an immigrant directing a show about immigrants. How did this inform the process?\n\nKAUFMAN: Well, that was another way into the material. Like a lot of immigrants, we arrive here with a dream, with an expectation of what we want our lives to be like. And we have this whole mythology of what America provides and what one is able to do in America. And invariably, whether you succeed or you fail, you have to confront the reality of America. There\u2019s always a gap between the reality of America and the dream of America. I think that the poorer you are, the distance between that reality and that image widens. So, of course, it\u2019s much harder for a poor person to come to America and realize their dreams than it is for a wealthy person to come to America and realize their dreams. I don\u2019t know, there was something about these immigrants arriving in this country and then finding community with the least likely of partners that really spoke to me.\n\nAP: What was the biggest challenge of directing this show?\n\nKAUFMAN: The biggest challenge was that we knew that we wanted to tell an epic story. You don\u2019t see musicals of this size on Broadway anymore or on the West End. You know, they\u2019re un-producible \u2014 36 actors on stage, 10 more actors off stage just being standbys, an orchestra of 50 people. It is a very big musical. At times we felt like, who do we want the audience to fall in love with and follow for the course of the play when you have so many characters? And how do you craft it in a way that you can follow all of them, and that you can follow the intricacies of this historical musical?\n\nAP: Joaquina Kalukango gets a standing ovation before the show even ends \u2014 after \u201cLet It Burn.\u201d What can you tell me about her? Do you ever worry she might get sick?\n\nKAUFMAN: We have two understudies for her, and they\u2019re both very good. But Joaquina \u2014 every so often a monster arrives at the theater and that\u2019s her, she\u2019s a theatrical monster. And in real life she\u2019s the most unassuming person in the world. She\u2019s a Juilliard graduate, she\u2019s a brilliant actor, and she can sing like that. It\u2019s just an astonishing thing to watch.\n\nAP: \u201cParadise Square\u201d happens in the 1800s, but it is still very relevant. What is the most important message that people can get from this musical today?\n\nKAUFMAN: I\u2019m always a little afraid of that question, because I feel that if I tell you the message that I want people to get, I am denying the audience part of the fun, which is for them to figure out what they see in the play. But what I can tell you is that what interested me is to see how deep the roots of our divisions are, and to see what are the forces that keep fueling those divisions. You know, America is a melting pot where nothing ever melted. So how do we aspire to a more perfect union? I think that the answer to that is by really understanding what are the things that tear us apart, and the play talks a lot about that.\n\n___\n\nSigal Ratner-Arias is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/sigalratner."}, {"url": "https://stageagent.com/writers/3201/moises-kaufman", "page_content": "Mois\u00e9s Kaufman is a playwright, director, and founder of the Tectonic Theater Project based in New York City.\n\nKaufman was born in Caracas, Venequela on November 21, 1963. His family is Orthodox Jewish of Romanian and Ukrainian descent. He attended a yeshiva (a Jewish religious school) as a child. While growing up, he was first exposed to theatre on family vacations to New York City. As a teenager, he attended a Caracas theatre festival which introduced him to the work of avant grade theater artists Peter Brook, Tadeusz Kantor, Pina Bausch, and Jerzy Grotowski, whom he cites as his earliest influences. He attended Metropolitan University in Caracas. During his time at university, he acted in a touring experimental theatre group.\n\nIn 1987, Kaufman moved to New York City to study directing at NYU's Tisch School of the Performing Arts. Four years later, he and his partner, Jeffrey LaHoste, created the Tectonic Theatre Project. The company is dedicated to addressing contemporary social issues, as well as to explore the structure and language of theatre.\n\nKaufman has stated that he is primarily drawn to moments in history that unintentionally reveal a society's views and belief systems. His first play, Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde, premiered in New York City in 1997. It won the Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Off-Broadway play.\n\nFrom 1998-1999, Kaufman and the Tectonic Theater Project traveled to Laramie, Wyoming to interview those connected to the murder of gay college student Matthew Shepard. The ensuing work compiled from their interviews, The Laramie Project, premiered in 2000 and was made into a film for HBO on 2001. The play gathered a worldwide following and has become a seminole work for the LGBQT community and for professional theaters, universities, high schools, and community theaters.\n\nIn 2003, Kaufman directed Doug Wright's I Am My Own Wife: Studies for a Play About Charlotte von Mahlsdorf. The play follows a gay transvestite who survived life in Nazi Germany and Soviet East Berlin. Kaufman received a Tony Award nomination for his direction. In 2007, Kaufman directed for Broadway again, this time for his own play, 33 Variations starring Jane Fonda as a musicologist obsessed with Beethoven\u2019s Diabelli Variations.

He\u2019s grappled with Beethoven and Jane Fonda, both in the same play (\u201c33 Variations\u201d).\n\nNow this 46-year-old playwright and director is playing with puppets: fish, fowl, an ogre, rabbits, a cat.

Is this the same theater auteur who brought the world \u201cGross Indecency\u201d (the Wilde play) and the Shepard-inspired \u201cLaramie Project\u201d?\n\n\u201cThis awakens the child in me,\u201d Mr. Kaufman said recently, holding aloft a foam-rubber eel puppet during a break from rehearsal for \u201cPuss in Boots (El Gato Con Botas),\u201d a 1947 opera by the Spanish composer Xavier Montsalvatge. If Mr. Kaufman\u2019s inner child is behind the endeavor, he\u2019s an ambitious tyke, as Montsalvatge\u2019s one-act opera does not typically include a cast of puppeteers alongside the singers. The production, which opens on Saturday at the New Victory Theater, is by Mr. Kaufman\u2019s Tectonic Theater Project, Gotham Chamber Opera and the puppetmakers of Blind Summit Theater (a London company last represented in New York by the puppet-child in the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s \u201cMadama Butterfly\u201d).\n\nA taste for the fanciful is actually not so new for Mr. Kaufman. Last year he lavishly reimagined the fairy-tale collisions of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s \u201cInto the Woods\u201d at Kansas City Repertory. And while the three years he spent immersed in Beethoven\u2019s music to write and direct \u201c33 Variations\u201d were hardly a lark, the experience whetted his appetite \u201cto be with music in the room, and to keep exploring the narrative power of music.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://animatingdemocracy.org/profile/mois%C3%A9s-kaufman", "page_content": "Mois\u00e9s Kaufman is a Tony and Emmy nominated director and award-winning playwright.\n\nMost recently, Mr. Kaufman directed the Pulitzer and Tony Award winning I Am My Own Wife on Broadway (Obie award for direction, Tony, Outer Critics, Lucille Lortell, Drama Desk Awards nomination)\n\nMr. Kaufman\u2019s plays Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde and The Laramie Project have been among the most performed plays in America over the last decade.\n\nThe Laramie Project opened at The Denver Theater Center in March 2000 and moved to New York on May 18th 2000 .

The medal recognizes outstanding contributions to the excellence, growth, support, and availability of the arts in the United States. Kaufman is in good company; among this year's other recipients are film director Mel Brooks, author Sandra Cisneros, actor Morgan Freeman, composer Philip Glass, and actress-singer Audra McDonald. (See the full list here.) Kaufman has had a long and varied career, and some facts about his life and work may surprise even devoted fans. Read on for 10 things you should know about Moises Kaufman.\n\nHe is the son of a Holocaust survivor.\n\nKaufman's father, Jose, was a Romanian Jew who survived the Holocaust. As a boy, Jose earned money by making and selling the yellow Stars of David that the Nazi regime forced Jews to wear. \"He spent most of the war alternately hiding in a small room and selling Stars of David,\" Moises Kaufman recalled in the book A Memory, a Monologue, a Rant, and a Prayer, edited by Eve Ensler. After World War II was over, Jose made his way to Caracas, Venezuela. There he worked in a grocery store and eventually bought one, and he married Dora Akerman, a Venezuelan-born woman of Ukrainian descent. Moises was born in Caracas in 1963. His parents brought him up in the Orthodox branch of Judaism, and he attended a yeshiva -- a Jewish religious school -- which made Moises quite the outsider in the heavily Catholic nation, as did his realization at age 11 that he was gay. Moises moved to New York City in 1987 to pursue his theatrical career, in which many of his projects have dealt with outsiders, and some have touched directly on the Holocaust. In 2015 he directed a revival of Bent, Martin Sherman's play about gay men in a concentration camp, at Los Angeles's Mark Taper Forum.\n\nThe Laramie Project was a massive undertaking.\n\nFor The Laramie Project, which deals with the brutal murder of gay college student Matthew Shepard and the reactions of the townspeople in Laramie, Wyo., Kaufman and his colleagues at the Tectonic Theater Project compiled 400 hours of interviews from over 200 people. Kaufman was in New York City when he heard about the attack on Shepard in October 1998. \"I started getting phone calls -- 'Did you hear what happened?' -- and then I read it in the newspaper and I saw it on television,\" he recalled to The Advocate in 2008. \"People have spoken about how we as gay people feel attacked, injured, constantly in our culture. And that image of that boy tied to the fence spoke to so many of us about our pain and about our sense of how we fit into the landscape of this country. The impact of seeing what this was doing to the country--that's when I decided to go to Laramie and do The Laramie Project.\" The Laramie Project premiered in 2000, has been performed widely, and was adapted into an HBO movie, directed by Kaufman, in 2002. And 10 years after Shepard's death Kaufman and his Tectonic collaborators returned to Laramie to compile a sequel, The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later, which premiered in 2009.\n\n[rebelmouse-image

It received numerous critics' awards and a GLAAD Media Award. It has been produced in dozens of cities in the U.S. and abroad, but a planned production in Moscow was abruptly canceled in 2015. The production was to be funded in part by the U.S. State Department, but the Russian government stepped in and said the Moscow theater company that was to stage it could not accept foreign funds. The real reason for the cancellation, Kaufman believes, was that this depiction of the great gay author and wit ran afoul of Russia's \"gay propaganda\" law, which bans any positive discussion of LGBT people or issues in forums accessible to minors. The play did receive a a star-studded benefit reading in New York City in the fall of 2015 to support the Tectonic Theater Project and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission.\n\nPictured: Kaufman (left) and Ben Foster clown around at the premiere of the HBO film of The Laramie Project.\n\nThe Laramie Project has run into trouble a few places too.\n\nThe Laramie Project's gay subject matter has led high school administrators to cancel performances of the play in places as varied as Spokane, Wash.;Ottumwa, Iowa; and Burbank, Calif. The students in Burbank eventually were able to stage their production, although not at their high school -- it went on at the Los Angeles suburb's Colony Theatre, which donated the space, and with help from Tectonic. But the play also has had well-received, school-supported productions in many places in the U.S., including Xavier High School, a Roman Catholic institution in New York City.\n\nHis play 33 Variations gave Jane Fonda her first Broadway role in 46 years.\n\nKaufman wrote and directed 33 Variations, about a music scholar studying one of Beethoven's most enigmatic works, and when it premiered on Broadway in 2009, Jane Fonda played the lead role. This was Fonda's first Broadway appearance since 1963, and she received positive reviews. \"Whatever discomfort the actress may feel melds into her portrayal of Dr. Katherine Brandt, whose naturally assertive nature is humbled by the progressive, atrophying illness known as Lou Gehrig's disease,\" Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times, adding, \"For those who grew up enthralled with Ms. Fonda's screen image, it's hard not to respond to her performance here, on some level, as a personal memento mori.\"\n\nHe discovered a different side of Robin Williams during Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo.\n\nFonda isn't the only major movie star who has appeared in a Kaufman play. In 2011, Robin Williams starred in Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo, a meditation on the Iraq war written and directed by Kaufman. Williams portrayed a tiger who is killed in the first scene and then haunts the rest of the characters for the remainder of the play. Williams initially started rehearsals with what Kaufman called \"the 10 a.m. stand-up.\" \"He would start talking about whatever crossed his mind and would riff on it for the next 20 or 30 minutes, keeping all of us -- actors, designers, stage management -- roaring with laughter,\" Kaufman wrote in Salon in 2014, after Williams's suicide. \"Like everyone, I was dazzled by the speed of his brain and the quickness of his wit, but I also noticed something else: an actor's natural trepidation about tackling a demanding role. As he developed his character ... the 10 a.m. monologues became shorter and shorter. He was feeling more at home in the rehearsal room, finding his groove in the role. Until, finally, the monologues were gone.\" Williams also developed \"a real camaraderie\" with his castmates -- and he occasionally showed signs of depression, the playwright noted. \"For me, it isn't his brilliant sense of humor, or his wit, or his chameleon abilities that I'll miss,\" Kaufman concluded. \"I'll miss the guy who came to rehearsal every day with humility and kindness, who sat around at lunch and shot the breeze. I'll miss the man who loved what he did every day. And who loved this community. I will miss my friend.\"\n\nHe's even directed operas, including one based on Puss in Boots.\n\nKaufman has proved his versatility time and again. In 2010 he took on the direction of Spanish composer Xavier Montsalvatge's chamber opera adaptation of the popular fairy tale. The production incorporated both puppets and human actors. Staging a show aimed at children was intimidating and also rewarding, Kaufman told the New York Daily News. \"I've never been more scared in my life, because children don't lie,\" he said. On the other hand, he noted, \"There's nothing better than hearing children laugh.\"\n\nHis most recent project is a reimagining of Bizet's Carmen.\n\nNothing if not adventurous, Kaufman and cowriter Eduardo Machado adapted Georges Bizet's 19th-century opera into Carmen: An Afro-Cuban Jazz Musical, set in 1958, changing the locale from Spain to Cuba, and making the sensuous factory worker Carmen a black woman who supports Fidel Castro's revolution. Composer Arturo O'Farrill adapted Bizet's melodies into jazzy tunes with lyrics by Kaufman and others. The play had its world premiere, directed by Kaufman, in February of this year at the Olney Theatre Center in Montgomery County, Md., near Washington, D.C.\n\nDespite all his success, Kaufman describes himself as shy and socially awkward.\n\n\"I'm incredibly shy, I am socially awkward, and I don't have many other interests other than my work,\" he told Los Angeles's Jewish Journal in 2011. \"When I'm in the rehearsal room, I'm my best self. I've always known how to live in my work. I am not so good at living my life.\"\n\nBut he has managed to have a long-term relationship. He is married to Jeffrey LaHoste, with whom he founded the Tectonic Theater Project.\n\nKaufman and LaHoste founded Tectonic in 1991, with the goal of \"developing innovative works that explore theatrical language and form, fostering an artistic dialogue with audiences on the social, political, and human issues that affect us all,\" according to the New York-based company's website. Kaufman is its artistic director, and LaHoste, a writer and producer, is a member of the board of directors. LaHoste has produced many of Kaufman's plays and several other projects, such as Kirby Dick's 2009 documentary film Outrage, about closeted politicians who support anti-LGBT legislation. He is also the author of author of Elysian Fields, a television series in development that was chosen as a participating project in the Producers' Guild of America's Diversity Workshop. Kaufman and LaHoste have been together for more than 20 years, and they were married in 2014."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/moises-kaufman", "page_content": "Spring Preview\n\nJoaquina Kalukango Isn\u2019t Afraid to Speak Up Anymore\n\nBefore leading her first Broadway musical in \u201cParadise Square,\u201d she had long deferred to others in the rehearsal room \u2014 until she realized how much she has to share."}]}
