Pakistan played a key role in China-US breakthrough, says Dr Kissinger in a speech to China Development Forum. Senator Mushahid Hussain says honour for Pakistan to play a pivotal role in China-US opening\n\nIslamabad: China Development Forum, a high-level annual event organised by China\u2019s State Council in Beijing, organised a Webinar on \u201850 Years of China-US Relations\u2019 with keynote speeches from former US Secretary of State Dr Henry Kissinger and Senator Mushahid Hussain on Pakistan\u2019s pivotal role in arranging Dr Kissinger\u2019s secret journey to China in 1971.\n\nHenry Kissinger speaking at the event.\n\nDr Henry Kissinger praised Pakistan for its key role during that period and how President Yahya Khan acted as a go-between China and US, communicating secretly with Premier Zhou Enlai and President Nixon, which led to Dr Kissinger\u2019s path-breaking journey in a PIA plane from Islamabad to Beijing on July 9, 1971. Dr Kissinger recounted on how the first message from China was in the form of a handwritten note which was personally dictated to him in the White House by the then Pakistan Ambassador in Washington, Agha Hilaly.\n\nSpeaking next after Dr Kissinger, Senator Mushahid Hussain, representing Pakistan, said that this historic breakthrough in China-US relations became possible due to the \u2018indispensable role of Pakistan which enjoyed the trust of both China and the United States, whose then President, Richard Nixon, had tremendous affection and goodwill for Pakistan\u2019.\n\nSenator Mushahid Hussain said that Pakistan\u2019s then President, General Yahya Khan, once entrusted with this task by both President Nixon and Premier Zhou Enlai, undertook this sensitive mission with \u2018military precision, secrecy and deception\u2019, with an official announcement of a decoy visit by Dr Kissinger to Nathiagali on the pretext that \u2018the American official was resting due to an upset stomach\u2019, while he had secretly flown to Beijing!

He said that the normalisation of relations had been beneficial for not just China and the US but also Asia and the world. China had helped the US win the Cold War and the US helped China come out of isolation which led later to China\u2019s reform and opening up policy that has transformed China.\n\nSenator Mushahid Hussain concluded that 50 years later, one lesson of China-US relations is that cooperation is good for both the countries and there is no room for outmoded policies like containment or a New Cold War.\n\nThe China Development Forum was attended by a large number of high officials, policymakers, economists, opinion and business leaders in Beijing, while Dr Kissinger and Senator Mushahid Hussain spoke virtually from New York and Islamabad respectively."}, {"url": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1024464", "page_content": "Born in 1952, Mushahid Hussain Syed did his Bachelors from Lahore\u2019s Forman Christian College, followed by a Masters degree from Georgetown University.

He was appointed information minister by Nawaz Sharif in the latter\u2019s 1997 cabinet.\n\nIn 1999, following the coup by former president General (retd) Pervez Musharraf, Mushahid\u2019s house was stormed by soldiers the very same day and he was placed under house arrest and then behind bars. He was released in 2000. Surprisingly, following his release, he defected to Pakistan Muslim League - Quaid (PML-Q), which became known as the \u2018King\u2019s party\u2019 because of its association with Musharraf.\n\nBefore Mushahid decided to experiment with politics, he had a vibrant career in academia as well as journalism. He also trained diplomats at the Pakistan Administrative Staff College, a civil service academy.

He has written regularly for the Times of India and The Hindustan Times, along with being published in the New York Times and Washington Post amongst other publications.\n\nIn 1997, Mushahid entered politics and was elected a Senator on a PML-N ticket. He was also made the information minister by Nawaz, and ushered Pakistan through some of its worst international crises \u2013 including the conducting of nuclear tests followed by crippling sanctions and the Kargil War.\n\nPrior to his 1997 cabinet induction, he was an advisor to the then prime minister Nawaz. According to Nawaz, Mushahid was the first person who told him to go ahead with the nuclear tests although this statement has been contested.\n\nAfter his arrest following the 1999 coup, Mushahid remained imprisoned for 440 days and was declared a \u2018Prisoner of Conscience\u2019 by Amnesty International. He was imprisoned by the military government for his connections with Nawaz, and was held in solitary confinement for a part of this time.\n\nEventually, he contested the 2003 Senate election on a PML-Q ticket and won \u2013 reportedly with a letter of recommendation from Washington. Mushahid also become a staunch supporter of Musharraf and even agreed with the latter\u2019s decision to not shed his uniform.\n\nIn 2004, he was part of a team that negotiated with slain Baloch nationalist leader Akbar Bugti. However, he was also part of the same government which was eventually implicated in the leader\u2019s killing.\n\nAfter the 2008 election, Mushahid was nominated by PML-Q as its presidential candidate \u2013 but he lost to Asif Ali Zardari, and received the smallest number of votes of all the nominees to boot.\n\nMushahid successfully contested election for the Parliament\u2019s upper house again in 2012 and currently heads the Senate\u2019s Standing Committee on Defence and Defence Production.
