BOTTOM: Henry Bibby, Terry Schofield, Andy Hill.\n\nJohn Vallely Today\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Vallely, age 53, was raised in Orange County and now lives in Newport Beach. During his college days, John was a member of the UCLA Bruins basketball team and participated in two National Championship seasons, 1969 and 1970, under legendary coach John Wooden. John and wife Karen met during college and were married in 1970, the year John graduated with a degree in sociology. The couple had two children: a son, Eric, and a daughter, Erin. When Erin was 9 years old she was diagnosed with cancer, and eventually lost her battle, at the age of 12, in 1991. Since then, John and Karen have been committed to fighting pediatric cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, John is completing treatment for his own illness, lymphoma, and is very optimistic about his recovery. John says he uses Wooden\u2019s Pyramid of Success strategy to deal with his cancer. Wooden\u2019s philosophy, according to Vallely, focuses on success rather than winning. \u201cI have no conflict in my heart about knowing that I am the best I can be and so I have peace of mind,\u201d John says. \u201cSuccess is the absence of conflict. Actually it\u2019s harder to do than winning. It\u2019s possible to win a game without doing your best. But knowing have been the best husband, the best father, the best patient I can, is all I can do.\u201d\n\nSurviving With Strength\n\nA Former UCLA Basketball Star Writes About Dealing with the Loss of a Daughter from Cancer, and Then, Fighting His Own Battle with Lymphoma\n\nBy John Vallely\n\n\n\nA random attack of cancer strikes fear in anyone. Why me? Am I going to die? What did I do wrong? Why did this have to strike my daughter at such a young age? It\u2019s not possible to answer these questions. What matters most, is our response to these life challenges.\n\n\n\nMy experience with cancer began in 1988. My 9- year-old daughter Erin was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma. Surgeons removed a cantaloupe- sized tumor from her abdomen, but were unable to get the entire growth. Until her death in 1991, she endured multiple s u r g e r i e s , chemotherapy and radiation that severely burned her already ill body. I learned so much from her. I miss her.\n\n\n\nIn April 2002, at 53 years old, I was diagnosed with lymphoma. I cannot tell you how astonished I was to learn of my condition. How could this be? Haven't we had enough? My wife and I had already experienced our child dying in our arms. What could be next for us? What about our son Eric? Again I was filled with fear, but once we all began to fight back it gradually subsided.\n\n\n\nThe first step of each patient\u2019s process is correct diagnosis. I believe you must have at least two opinions regarding pathology. If a patient is incorrectly diagnosed, the treatment will not attack their disease. I have spoken with patients who were disappointed with treatment outcome. They later learned that the course of medications would have been different had they researched their circumstances more thoroughly. Consensus on diagnosis is good. Differing opinions lead to better decisions, so patient and family must be proactive and explore options. The relationship with the medical system should be considered a partnership.\n\n\n\nThe next step is launching a plan of attack. After all, this is War! Most things, including my cancer, are not simply about winning and losing. My disease is about the process. I believe it is important to have a positive attitude. Mine is: \"I will be the best I can be. I will do all that I can do to get well and to help my loved ones. I will follow all of the doctor\u2019s directions. I will do everything in my power to give myself and loved ones every chance to survive this disease. And then I will pray!\"\n\n\n\nI believe \"hope\" is important. One can benefit from faith in something. The mental, physical and spiritual obstacles related to cancer are severe. A positive outlook may not have the power to heal -\u2014 but, then again, it might. I believe, at the very least, it can make the process more manageable. Hope and faith are very personal. I was broken-hearted and disappointed when God did not heal my daughter. Yet, I believe she is in heaven. When I was diagnosed, I was angry with God. My lonely walks on the beach brought on another series of questions: What kind of God are you? Do you care? What do you want with my family? Even so, I never gave up my trust that God is watching over Erin.\n\n\n\nMy journey forward has been steady but difficult. It requires a willingness to participate on so many levels and I\u2019m always seeking answers. I believe that the process will lead to living my life at the highest level, regardless of the outcome. Prayer and reflection are part of my daily vigilance. I am grateful that doctors, nurses, chemotherapy, and other drugs are available. I consider these to be gifts from God. I also believe this is part of a grand plan that will give me, the cancer patient, an opportunity to fight and a chance to get well.\n\n\n\nWhen our daughter Erin died my wife, Karen, and I made our decision to fight back. We joined with others in an organization called the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation (PCRF) to raise funds for research aimed at curing pediatric cancer. I\u2019m a past president of PCRF, and currently a member of the PCRF board of directors. Karen spends countless hours on the PCRF Holiday Card Program \u2014 their major fund raising activity for the last 20 years. Our family shares the goals of PCRF.\n\n\n\nRaising funds to support research will help fight this terrible disease. Over the last 20 years the survival rate for children with cancer has more than doubled because of research. Regardless of the outcome of my disease, I know that we are making a difference in this big battle, that we are committed until cancer is defeated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links John Vallely Motivates\n\nLatest News Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/john-baker-vallely-24-b031nf", "page_content": "This database contains family trees submitted to Ancestry by users who have indicated that their tree can be viewed by all Ancestry subscribers.These trees can change over time as users edit, remove, or otherwise modify the data in their trees.

He won his two NCAA championships in 1969 and 1970, and was a teammate of Kareem Abdul Jabbar (then known as Lew Alcindor) in \u201969.\n\nThe 14th player drafted in the First Round of the 1970 NBA Draft by the Atlanta Hawks, the 6\u20192\u201d guard also played for the Houston Rockets.\n\nAs impressive as Vallely was in hoops, the Newport Beach, CA born athlete was equally dominant in volleyball. Introduced to beach volleyball while in high school, John was a member of one of beach volleyball\u2019s greatest two-man duos ever. In 1969, Vallely and his partner, the legendary Von Hagen, put together a perfect season, winning all of the five open tournaments they entered.\n\nVallely was recognized for his beach volleyball accomplishments by being inducted into the California Beach Volleyball Association (CBVA) Hall of Fame.\n\nFollowing his basketball career, Vallely built a successful real estate portfolio and a sports apparel business. Since the passing of his daughter, Erin, from cancer at the age of 12, he has been actively involved in pediatric cancer research, serving on the Board of Director of the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation with Rod Carew.\n\nVallely faced his own battle with cancer, being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in 2002, and was later blessed with a successful stem cell/bone marrow transplant in 2006. He called on the lessons he learned from Coach Wooden to come out triumphant in that battle as well.\n\nJohn currently works in Orange County, CA where he lives with his wife Karen of 50+ years, and close to his son Eric and granddaughter Erin.\n\nA basketball legend and a California Beach Volleyball Hall of Famer, the affable John Vallely will be a special \u2018MMM\u2019 guest on April 13th.\n\n###"}, {"url": "https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/john-vallely-24-8d7q09", "page_content": "This database contains family trees submitted to Ancestry by users who have indicated that their tree can be viewed by all Ancestry subscribers.These trees can change over time as users edit, remove, or otherwise modify the data in their trees.

The same principles apply whether the opponent is Oregon State or non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing about playing for Coach was not necessarily the championships, but what he taught us about living life was far more important,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cI just recall the importance of the Pyramid of Success and the characteristics. What he taught us were lifelong lessons. So much of what he was teaching really had a parable of how you live your life.\u201d\n\nIn 1968, Vallely transferred from Orange Coast College to UCLA for his junior year. On the first day of practice, he looked around the locker room filled with teammates such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then known as Lew Alcindor), Lynn Shackelford, Curtis Rowe and Sidney Wicks. Wooden came in, unfolded a pair of socks and told his players how to put them on, making sure there were no creases or folds that could cause blisters.\n\nThis was during UCLA\u2019s run of seven consecutive championships, and Wooden took pains to eliminate even the slightest threat to the Bruins\u2019 dominance. Vallely wasn\u2019t just along for the ride. He started in both of his seasons, averaged 13.8 points and even outscored Abdul-Jabbar, 29-25, in a Final Four game.\n\n\u201cJohn was a great player for us,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\n\n\u201cHe delivered, consistently, in the crunch. I remember that. I was real happy to play with someone like that, that was versatile and wasn\u2019t going to shy away from taking the ball and doing something righteous with it when we needed it.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long after Vallely finished his college career in 1970 that Wooden started influencing his personal life. When Vallely was wavering on whether to propose to his girlfriend, Karen, Wooden jabbed a finger in his chest and said, \u201cYou marry that girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe still takes credit for it,\u201d Vallely says.\n\nVallely was drafted in the first round by the Atlanta Hawks but lasted only a couple of seasons before heading to Europe to play. He returned to Orange County for his post-basketball life, starting a ski clothing store and investing in real estate. Wooden grew from his coach to his mentor and friend, and his teachings became increasingly relevant.\n\n\u201cSo many of the things he said that had to do with basketball really had a lot to do with life,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cSuccess was more important than winning or losing the game.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, as Abdul-Jabbar had his children, he discovered himself applying the same approach he received from Wooden. Now he\u2019s proud of the four college graduates he raised.\n\n\u201cThe idea of challenging them to be at their best and pushing them at the times when they needed to be pushed, but not taking away their individuality, really started with how I was treated by John Wooden,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing man that way.\u201d\n\nWooden always defined success as \u201cpeace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best that you are capable of becoming.\u201d\n\nTo Vallely, that meant, \u201cBeing able to say, \u2018I have no conflict in my heart over my effort.\u2019 Carry that into your business life and family life, marital life. It puts a spring in your life and makes you want to do the best you can in those areas.\u201d\n\nIt enables him to triumph even through adversity. Vallely\u2019s 12-year-old daughter, Erin, died in 1991 after a three-year battle with pediatric cancer; since 1989 he has made children\u2019s cancer research funding his philanthropic mission.\n\nTreating kids with cancer is particularly difficult because \u201cthey react differently to chemotherapy, they\u2019re fast-growing and changing differently than adults,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s legacy is her mommy and daddy are trying to do something about that.\u201d\n\nFor assistance, he recruited a key player: his old coach.\n\nFor the last decade Vallely has been the host of exclusive private dinners with Wooden and moderated Q&A; sessions with him as part of the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation\u2019s annual \u201cBid for the Kids\u201d fundraising event. (This year the event, which included a live auction of sports memorabilia, netted $220,000.)\n\nEven at 95, Wooden keeps lending his name and showing up for free.\n\nAnd Vallely keeps learning. When someone asked Wooden the two most important words in his vocabulary, Wooden chose \u201clove\u201d and \u201cbalance.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis faith in God, love of family, love for the things you\u2019re involved in,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cBalance: not being too high, too low.\u201d\n\nThe way those lessons have taken root is evident in Vallely\u2019s response to the challenges life throws at him. He recently was diagnosed with a recurrence of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system.\n\nWhat struck me was how the tone of his voice sounded similar in a series of phone calls: on the evening before he went to Houston for more testing; the next day, when a test showed he might not have the disease after all; this week, when further tests indicated he did have it.\n\nAs always, he followed Wooden\u2019s advice.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018This is a bump in the road,\u2019 \u201d Vallely said. \u201cHe encouraged me to go forward. The way I treated it was to be the best patient I could be. Same old deal: Have peace of mind about that, give the doctor the best chance he could to heal me.\u201d\n\nIt worked once, and it\u2019s his best shot to beat it again.\n\n\u201cI wish it hadn\u2019t happened, but stuff happens to people,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cI look at what those kids go through, it\u2019s a mind-blower. There\u2019s always someone who has more difficult circumstances than you. My life has been good. I\u2019m pleased with that. I\u2019m hoping to carry on. But it is what it is.\u201d\n\nIt is a life enriched, still, by the man who taught him how to put on his socks 37 years ago.\n\n*\n\nJ.A. Adande can be reached at j.a.adande@latimes.com.
