{"Wilhelm Windelband was a neo-Kantian who protested other neo-Kantians of his time and maintained a critical position towards psychologism.": [{"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wilhelm-windelband/", "page_content": "First published Mon May 18, 2020\n\nWindelband was a marvelous essayist. He developed his ideas not in the format of a larger systematic work, but in a series of addresses and individual papers, a selection of which was published in his famous Pr\u00e4ludien [Preludes] in 1883. The genre of Windelband\u2019s writings does not lend itself to the development of a philosophical system, and he often changes the emphasis, framing, and terminology of his claims and arguments from one essay to the next. Nevertheless, he was a rigorous thinker. This entry provides a rational reconstruction of the systematic insights that Windelband developed in his various addresses and essays, and groups them around the central themes that reoccur throughout his oeuvre. With respect to many of these themes\u2014the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant, the fact-value distinction, the question of historical method, and the conception of the history of philosophy\u2014Windelband was a highly influential contributor to the philosophical landscape of his time. Although he did not develop a detailed and encompassing philosophical system like his student Rickert, or the neo-Kantians of the Marburg school, most notably Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945), his ideas shaped subsequent debates on these issues more profoundly than is often acknowledged.\n\nHe also made a name for himself in the history of philosophy by pioneering the method of structuring the historical presentation in terms of fundamental philosophical problems, rather than as a chronology of individual thinkers.\n\nWindelband is well-known for having introduced a distinction between the \u201cnomothetic method\u201d of the natural sciences and the \u201cidiographic method\u201d of the historical disciplines. His argument that history is a science [Wissenschaft] that captures the unique, unrepeatable and individual character of reality has been highly relevant for subsequent debates on historical method.\n\nWindelband\u2019s main philosophical contribution consists in reformulating Kant\u2019s transcendental approach in terms of a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d that focuses philosophical analysis on questions of normativity. Although Windelband thinks of his project as an anti-metaphysical \u201cscientific philosophy\u201d, he is keen to secure for philosophy a role that is independent of the special sciences. He finds the grounds for philosophy\u2019s independence in its formal-teleological method, and in its concern with a quaestio juris, rather than a quaestio facti. That is, philosophy deals with questions of justification, it does not determine matters of fact.\n\nWilhelm Windelband (1848\u20131915) was a German neo-Kantian philosopher. He is considered the founding father of the Baden (or Southwest) school of Neo-Kantianism. The Baden school included his student and successor at Heidelberg, Heinrich Rickert (1863\u20131936), and Rickert\u2019s student Emil Lask (1875\u20131915) as its core members. Alongside his contemporary Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918)\u2014the founder of the Marburg school of Neo-Kantianism\u2014Windelband is a central proponent of the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant that became dominant in German academic philosophy from the 1880s onwards, and that constituted the backbone of \u201corthodox\u201d neo-Kantianism in the late nineteenth century.\n\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nWilhelm Windelband was born in 1848 in Potsdam, Germany. His father, Johann Friedrich Windelband was a state secretary for the Province of Brandenburg. Windelband studied in Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen, attending lectures by Kuno Fischer (1824\u20131907) in Jena and studying with Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881) in G\u00f6ttingen. Fischer and Lotze would deeply influence Windelband\u2019s philosophical thinking, as well as his work as a historian of philosophy.\n\nIn 1870, Windelband completed his dissertation on Die Lehren vom Zufall [Doctrines of chance] under Lotze\u2019s supervision. The following year he served as a soldier in the German-French war. After his military service, he completed his habilitation in Leipzig and took up a position as \u201cPrivatdozent\u201d there. His habilitation was published in 1873 under the title Ueber die Gewissheit der Erkenntniss: eine psychologisch-erkenntnisstheoretische Studie [On the certainty of knowledge: a psychological-epistemological study]. In 1874, Windelband married Martha Wichgraf with whom he would have four children.\n\nTwo years later, Windelband became professor (ordinarius) of \u201cinductive philosophy\u201d in Z\u00fcrich. He lectured on psychology before taking up a position as professor of philosophy in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1877. In 1882 he accepted an offer from the University of Strasbourg. While his inaugural lectures in Z\u00fcrich and Freiburg had centered on the relation between psychology and philosophy, his works from the Strasbourg period develop his core themes in the philosophy of values and the philosophy of history. Windelband served as \u201cRektor\u201d of the University of Strasbourg in 1894/95 and 1897/98. He remained in Strasbourg until 1903, when he accepted a call from the University of Heidelberg. Between 1905 and 1908 he served as representative of the University of Heidelberg in the Baden \u201cLandtag\u201d. He was a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and of the Academies of Sciences of G\u00f6ttingen, Bayern and Heidelberg. He remained in Heidelberg and taught there until his death in 1915.\n\n2. From Kant to the Philosophy of Values\n\nWindelband\u2019s views on normativity are strongly influenced by his teacher Lotze. In his Logic (1874), Lotze distinguishes between psychological laws which determine how thinking proceeds as a matter of fact, and logical laws, which are normative laws and prescribe how thinking ought to proceed (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x; \u00a7332, \u00a7337). This distinction also corresponds to a distinction between act and content. Lotze observes that \u201cideas\u201d do occur in us as acts or events of the mind. But their content does not consist in such acts, is not reducible to mental activity, and does not exist in the way empirical processes and entities may be said to exist. It is not real, but \u201cvalid\u201d (Lotze 1874: \u00a7\u00a7314\u2013318).\n\nThe distinction between the factual and the normative would become the cornerstone of Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d. In his early writings, however, Windelband does not yet embrace this distinction. In his habilitation thesis \u00dcber die Gewi\u00dfheit der Erkenntnis (1873), he argues that logic is a normative discipline, but that it needs to be put on a psychological basis. This is because the justification of our knowledge claims is always dependent on and relative to specific epistemic purposes which, in turn, are given psychologically. Although he criticizes the identification of the conditions of knowledge with psychophysical processes, he does think of psychology and logic or epistemology as continuous with one another. His 1875 \u201cDie Erkenntnislehre unter dem v\u00f6lkerpsychologischen Gesichtspunkte\u201d [\u201cThe theory of knowledge from the perspective of folk-psychology\u201d] which was published in Moritz Lazarus\u2019 and Heyman Steinthal\u2019s Zeitschrift f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft [Journal of folk psychology and linguistics], is more radical. It denies that logical norms are independent of the conscious mind and claims that the origins of logical norms are to be found in the social history of humankind: the principle of contradiction emerges in situations of social conflict together with the distinction between true and false beliefs; and the law of sufficient reason comes into being when conflicts between rival views are no longer settled by brute force. On this picture, logical principles exist only when humans cognize them. There is no boundary between psychological acts and objective logical laws, or between actual historical acceptance and normative validity.\n\nThis is precisely the type of thinking that Windelband will later reject as \u201cpsychologistic\u201d, \u201chistoricist\u201d, and \u201crelativist\u201d (1883: 116\u2013117, 132). It is not clear what led Windelband to this change of view, but a deeper engagement with the Critique of Pure Reason and with the Kant scholarship of his time, in particular with works by Kuno Fischer (1860), Herman Cohen (1871), and Friedrich Paulsen (1875), seem to have factored in. The clear contours of Windelband\u2019s anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant emerge for the first time in his 1877 paper \u201c\u00dcber die verschiedenen Phasen der Kantischen Lehre vom Ding-an-sich\u201d [\u201cOn the different stages of the Kantian doctrine of the thing-in-itself\u201d]. In this essay, Windelband argues against the idea, held by prominent figures of the \u201cback-to-Kant\u201d movement like Friedrich Albert Lange (1828\u20131875) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1821\u20131894), that knowledge emerges from an interaction between subject and object. According to their view, the object affects the subject\u2019s mind, while the subject provides the a priori cognitive structures that organize representations. These a priori structures are innate as they consist in the psychophysical constitution of the human sensory apparatus and mind. Cohen\u2019s critique of this (mis)interpretation focuses on the concept of the a priori and the question of objectivity (Cohen 1871). Windelband, in contrast, takes the problem of the thing-in-itself and the concept of truth as his starting points. His critique of the subject-object-interaction model leads him to an immanent conception of truth, according to which truth consists in the normative rules according to which our judgments ought to be formed. The immanent concept of truth thus shifts the focus of philosophical analysis on the universal and necessary \u201crules\u201d that ground our judgments.\n\nThe 1877 essay gives a genetic account of the development of Kant\u2019s views about the thing-in-itself from the Inaugural Dissertation (1770) to the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (1787). This genetic reconstruction is supposed to reveal the underlying philosophical problems and motivations that drove Kant\u2019s thinking, as well as the inner tensions that, according to Windelband, permeate critical philosophy. In particular, Windelband identifies a \u201cgulf\u201d (1877: 225) between Kant\u2019s critique of knowledge and the metaphysics of morals, as well as a tension between the psychological account of the faculties, and Kant\u2019s mature anti-psychologism. He distinguishes between four phases in Kant\u2019s thinking about the thing-in-itself, and argues that residues of the latter three stages are present in both editions of the Critique (1781; 1787) and in the Prolegomena (1783).\n\nThe first phase, Windelband argues, is that of the Inaugural Dissertation (1770). Kant adopts Leibniz\u2019s distinction between noumena and phenomena while formulating a genuinely novel thought: he introduces the psychological distinction between receptive sensibility and the spontaneous intellect. This distinction allows him to maintain the claim that, unlike intuitions, concepts relate to things-in-themselves (1877: 240\u2013241).\n\nIn the second phase, Kant concerns himself more deeply with the question how the concepts of the understanding can relate to objects. He is driven to the insight that\n\n[w]e can only have a priori knowledge of that which we produce by the lawlike forms of our rational activities [Vernunfthandlungen]. (1877: 246)\n\nHere, Windelband follows Fischer\u2019s claim that the categories of the understanding are a priori valid for experience because they produce or \u201cmake\u201d it (Fischer 1860). Because the understanding cannot \u201cmake\u201d the thing-in-itself, the thing-in-itself cannot be known.\n\nAccording to Windelband, Kant then proceeds to inquire why we are even assuming the existence of things-in-themselves if we cannot know them. Here he enters his third, most radical phase. Kant now thinks of the thing-in-itself as a fiction, an illegitimate hypostasis in which\n\nthe universal form of the synthetic act of the understanding is seen as something that exists independently of experience. (1877: 254)\n\nWindelband argues that it is only by dismissing the existence of the thing-in-itself and by jettisoning the phenomena-noumena distinction that Kant can undertake his anti-psychologistic turn. With the rejection of the thing-in-itself, the characterization of sensibility as \u201creceptive\u201d also needs to be abandoned. And that makes a psychological construal of the faculties nonsensical. Kant is then also able to abandon the concept of truth as correspondence between representations and objects in favor of a strictly immanent conception. The immanent conception defines truth in terms of the universal and necessary rules that the relations between our representations need to accord to (1877: 259\u2013260).\n\nAnd yet, Kant could not rest with this radical view given his commitments in moral philosophy. Practical reason, and in particular the idea that the moral law does not depend on the qualities of humans as sensuous beings, but only on reason, demands a return to the assumption that the thing-in-itself exists (1877: 262). In the fourth phase, Kant thus reintroduces the thing-in-itself, while maintaining his anti-psychologism.\n\nThis genetic reconstruction allows Windelband to think of the conflict between the different views of the thing-in-itself that had emerged within the neo-Kantian tradition as reflective of inherent tensions in the Critique. He argues that Kant was especially unclear with respect to psychologism: the distinction between judgment (as a cognitive process) and justification (as logical and normative) is inadequately articulated in the first Critique. Hence Kant is at least partly responsible for the fact that in the first wave of neo-Kantianism represented by Lange and Helmholtz \u201cthe new concept of aprioricity was soon dragged down to the old idea of psychological priority\u201d (1883: 101).\n\nBut Windelband\u2019s approach to Kant is not merely historical. His sympathies clearly lie with the Kant of the third phase. For Windelband, the insight that natural psychological processes are \u201cutterly irrelevant\u201d for the truth value of our representations (1882b: 24), and the idea that the ultimate problem of philosophy is that of normativity and justification\u2014not a quaestio facti, but a quaestio juris (1882b: 26)\u2014need to be defended from Kant\u2019s own unclarities on these matters. Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d can thus be understood as an attempt to purify, explicate and develop the radical insights of the anti-psychologistic move in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d.\n\nThe cornerstone of this endeavor is the immanent conception of truth. Windelband repeatedly returns to discussing the correspondence theory of knowledge with its metaphor of a \u201cmirror relation\u201d between mind and object. He criticizes the misconception that our sensual perceptions are the things-in-themselves and that these things could be compared with our representations. Any comparison must occur between representations, since things and representations are \u201cincommensurable\u201d (1881: 130). According to Windelband, Kant\u2019s central innovation consists in the insight that the truth of our judgments, and the relation of our representations to an object are not to be found in correspondence at all. Rather, it consists in the \u201crules\u201d for combining representations (1881: 134). This leads Windelband to define truth as the \u201cnormality of thinking\u201d (1881: 138)\u2014with \u201cnormality\u201d meaning that thinking proceeds in accordance with rules or norms. Windelband also conceptualizes the object of knowledge in terms of the rules of judgment. The object of knowledge is nothing other than\n\na rule according to which representational elements ought to organize themselves, in order for them to be recognized as universally valid in this organization. (1881: 135).\n\nWindelband uses the terms \u201caxioms\u201d and \u201cvalues\u201d interchangeably to refer to the most fundamental rules, and he uses the term \u201cnorms\u201d often, but not fully consistently to refer to values or axioms as they relate to psychological experience and the cultural-historical world. Focusing his interpretation on \u201cvalues\u201d and \u201cnorms\u201d, Windelband captures the structural similarity of Kant\u2019s three Critiques in terms of immanent truth: if truth is nothing other than accordance with a rule, then there is moral and aesthetic truth in just the same way as there is epistemic truth (1881: 140). In a later text, Windelband describes the unified project of the three Critiques in terms of the necessary and universal relation between thought and object. He writes that the postulates of practical reason relate to intelligible objects (ideas) just \u201cas necessarily\u201d as the intuitions and categories relate to the object of experience, and that teleological judgment constructs the purposive whole of nature just \u201cas universally\u201d as the principles of pure understanding apply the categories to experience (1904a: 151). While this formulation glosses over some of the nuances of the distinction between constitutive and regulative uses of reason, Windelband\u2019s main intention is not that of giving a detailed and fully accurate reconstruction of Kant\u2019s philosophy. In line with his famous dictum that \u201cunderstanding Kant means to go beyond him\u201d (1915: iv), he instead seeks to revive the critical project in a manner that allows it to answer the needs of his own time. And Windelband thinks that the critical philosophy required at the time of his writing is a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d which reveals the most fundamental values in epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.\n\n3. The Factual, the Normative, and the Method of Philosophy\n\nAs indicated above, Windelband bases his \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d on Lotze\u2019s distinction between the factual and the normative. Throughout his career, he seeks to explicate and clarify this distinction and to illuminate its consequences for philosophical method.\n\nIn \u201cWas ist Philosophie?\u201d [\u201cWhat is philosophy?\u201d] (1882), Windelband approaches the factual-normative distinction by identifying two basic and irreducible types of cognitive operations: judgments and evaluations. While judgments relate representations in a synthesis, and thus expand our knowledge about an object, evaluations presuppose an object as given. They do not expand our knowledge. Rather, they express a relation between the \u201cevaluating consciousness\u201d and the represented object in a \u201cfeeling\u201d of approval or disapproval (1882b: 29\u201330).\n\nDespite characterizing evaluations in terms of the feelings and subjective attitudes of the evaluating consciousness, Windelband argues that some evaluations are \u201cabsolutely valid\u201d. Even if they are not embraced by everyone as a matter fact, they entail a normative demand: they ought to be accepted universally according to an absolute value (1882b: 37). The basic idea seems to be that the normative force of any particular evaluation that is carried out by an empirical consciousness is derived from its relation to a non-empirical, absolute value. Windelband argues that even if there is disagreement about which evaluations ought to be embraced as universal and necessary, the demand for absolute validity itself can be recognized by everyone: we all believe in the distinction between that which is absolutely valid and that which is not (1882b: 43).\n\nAccordingly, there must be a system of absolute values from which the validity of judgments in epistemology, aesthetics, and ethic derives. Critical philosophy, then, is nothing other than the \u201cscience of necessary and universal values\u201d (1882b: 26) that explicates this system and thus reveals the grounds of normative appraisal and valid judgment. Note that for Windelband, normativity and validity are closely linked, if not identical. Absolute values endow our judgments with a normative demand. Our judgments are valid if and only if they raise a normative demand, that is if they ought to be accepted universally and necessarily.\n\nHaving distinguished the factual and the normative by reference to different cognitive operations, Windelband also seeks to identify the points of contact between the two realms. Ultimately, he wants to explain how empirical beings can recognize absolute values. His idea that there is a system of absolute values is thus accompanied by the conception of a \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. In normal consciousness the absolute system of values is, at least partially, represented in the form of norms that are known by \u201cempirical consciousness\u201d and that have an effect on it.\n\nStarting from the immanent conception of truth as accordance with a rule, Windelband distinguishes from among the infinite possible combinations of representations that might or might not be formed by empirical consciousness a subset of combinations: the subset that accords with universal and necessary rules, and which hence ought to be formed (1881: 135\u2013139: 1882a: 72\u201373). This subset is what he calls \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d (1881: 139). Thought is related to and valid for an object if of the infinite possible combinations of our representations, our thinking forms exactly those judgments that \u201cought to be thought\u201d (1881: 135). One might say that empirical consciousness contains (parts) of the system of absolute values as its \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. To the extent that philosophy seeks not only to reveal the absolute system of values, but also to inquire into how they can be norms for empirical\u2014embodied, psychological and historically situated\u2014human beings, critical philosophy is not only a \u201cscience of values\u201d, but also a \u201cscience of normal consciousness\u201d (1882b: 46).\n\nAlthough Windelband refers to the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d as a science, he emphasizes that philosophy does not rely on the methods of the empirical sciences. Philosophy is a second-order science that reflects on the methods and results of the various empirical disciplines in order to reveal the values \u201cby virtue of which we can evaluate the form and extent of their validity\u201d (1907: 9). Crucially, this reflective endeavor cannot be carried out by means of empirical investigation. Here, the distinction between the factual and the normative assumes a methodological dimension.\n\nIn \u201cKritische oder genetische Methode?\u201d [\u201cCritical or genetic method?\u201d] (1883) Windelband lays out in great detail the differences between the \u201cexplanatory\u201d and \u201cgenetic\u201d method of the empirical sciences, on the one hand, and the \u201cteleological\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d method of philosophy, on the other. And he warns of the devastating consequences that result if the two are conflated. He singles out two disciplines that might be thought to be relevant to philosophical questions about values: individual psychology and cultural history. He does not call into question the legitimacy of these disciplines or of the \u201cgenetic method\u201d in general. He even thinks that the genetic method can be applied to values. That is, individual psychology and cultural history can yield valid genetic theories that explain the actual acceptance and development of values in an individual\u2019s mental life and in cultural history. But actual acceptance is not the same as normative validity, and validity proper cannot be found by generalizing from the empirical. A firm boundary separates the genetic method and its approach toward actually accepted values from the critical method of philosophy which concerns values as normative.\n\nWindelband\u2019s argument against the application of the genetic method to philosophical questions has three components. First, he argues that the genetic method cannot solve philosophical questions about normativity and validity, because there is too much variety regarding the values that have been and are actually accepted. The empirical method will not uncover values that are universally embraced by all cultures (1883: 114\u2013115).\n\nSecond, the genetic method can show and explain why some values have been accepted by this or that individual, or in this or that culture. But insofar as it is an empirical method, it cannot establish that the values in question are universal and necessary.\n\nThe universally valid can be found neither by inductive comparison of all individuals and peoples nor by deductive inference from \u2026 the \u2018essence\u2019 of man. (1883: 115)\n\nWindelband points to the absurdity of trying to justify by empirical means that which is the presupposition of any empirical theory: the axioms upon which the validity of any theory is based (1883: 113).\n\nThird, Windelband argues that the genetic method leads to relativism. The argument rests on the two claims just outlined, and can be reconstructed as follows. There is variation between individuals and cultures regarding which beliefs are actually prevalent, and the naturally necessary [naturnotwendig] laws of psychology lead to the formation of both true and false beliefs. As an empirical method with no access to the universal and necessary, the genetic method of cultural history and individual psychology has no criterion for distinguishing between valid and invalid beliefs. This means that it has to treat all beliefs as \u201cequally justified [alle gleich berechtigt]\u201d (1882b: 36).\n\nFor [the genetic explanation], there is thus no absolute measure; it must treat all beliefs as equally justified because they are all equally necessary by nature\u2026 [R]elativism is the necessary consequence of the purely empiricist treatment of philosophy\u2019s cardinal question. (1883: 115\u2013116)\n\nNote that Windelband does not differentiate between the idea that all beliefs have only relative validity and the claim that they are all equally justified or equally valid. In his view, the genetic method does not merely render belief relative to individuals and cultures; it also forces us to conclude that all beliefs are equally valid. An empirical psychology or cultural history that oversteps its boundaries and tries to address philosophical questions about normativity and validity leads to \u201chistoricism\u201d, \u201cpsychologism\u201d, and \u201crelativism\u201d and destroys the basis of normative appraisal altogether.\n\nHaving rejected the genetic method in philosophy, Windelband explains that philosophical method is purely \u201cformal\u201d. The axioms, or values, on which the validity of our judgments is based upon cannot be proven. But it can be shown that the purposes of recognizing truth, beauty, and can only be achieved if absolute values are presupposed. Hence the critical method of philosophy has a teleological structure:\n\n[F]or the critical method these axioms, regardless of the extent to which they are actually accepted, are norms which ought to be valid if thinking wants to fulfil the purpose of being true, volition the purpose of being good, and feeling the purpose of capturing beauty, in a manner that warrants universal validation. (1883: 109)\n\nAnd yet, while Windelband insists on the distinction between the empirical-genetic method of science and the critical-teleological method of philosophy, he takes his theory of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d to imply that empirical facts do play a role in philosophy. In particular, he wants to maintain that empirical facts about individual psychology and culture can provide the starting points for philosophical reflection. He therefore describes the philosophical method as a method of reflection [Selbstbesinnung], in which the empirical mind becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. Philosophy examines existing claims to validity in light of teleological considerations, and in this way reveals the \u201cprocessual forms of psychic life that are necessary conditions for the realization of universal appraisal\u201d (1883: 125). Put differently, teleological considerations allow the empirical consciousness to distinguish within itself between empirical and contingent contents, on the one hand, and the \u201ccontents and forms\u201d that \u201chave the value of normal consciousness\u201d, on the other (1882b: 45\u201346; 1881: 139).\n\n4. The Problem of Freedom\n\nThe distinction between the normative and the factual and the question how the two realms are related also structure Windelband\u2019s reflections on human freedom. Throughout his intellectual career, Windelband returns to this problem, presenting different strategies for reconciling causal determinism and human freedom. His dissertation, completed under Lotze in 1870, deals with the concepts of chance, causal necessity, and freedom. At that time, Windelband still embraces the Kantian concept of transcendental freedom, according to which the noumenal self is the uncaused cause of all intentional action (1870: 16\u201319). But after the 1877 essay, which had uncovered the anti-metaphysical rejection of the thing-in-itself in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d as the radical starting point for the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d, Kant\u2019s metaphysical solution to the problem of freedom ceased to convince him.\n\nWindelband\u2019s most fully developed effort to arrive at an alternative solution to the problem of freedom can be found in his 1882 essay \u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d [\u201cNorms and natural laws\u201d] and in his 1904 lectures \u00dcber Willenfreiheit [On freedom of the will]. In these texts, Windelband articulates the following core claims. First, the Kantian dualism between phenomena and noumena needs to be overcome, and we need to think of moral responsibility in a way that does not presuppose a noumenal realm. Second, causal explanation and normative evaluation are two irreducible, but ultimately compatible, ways of viewing, or constructing, the world of appearances. Third, the object of moral evaluation is neither a particular moral action, nor a transcendentally free will, but a \u201cpersonality\u201d\u2014understood as a set of relatively stable motivations and psychological dispositions\u2014that is the natural cause of our actions. Although articulating these same core thoughts, the two texts differ in how they motivate these ideas, and in the consequences that they draw from them.\n\n\u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d begins by postulating a conflict between natural law and moral law: if the moral law demands an action that would also result from natural causes alone, it is superfluous. But if it demands an action that does not accord with natural causes, it is useless, because natural necessity cannot be violated (1882a: 59).\n\nWindelband holds that causal determinism extends to mental life and that for this reason the conception of freedom as a fundamental capacity that violates \u201cthe naturally necessary functions of psychic life\u201d (1882a: 60) is implausible from the get-go. However, he grants that there are two different and irreducible ways of viewing the same objects: on the one hand, there is psychological science which explains what the facts of mental life are. On the other hand, there are ideal norms, which do not explain what the facts are, but express how they ought to be (1882a: 66\u201367). The solution to the antagonism between natural law and moral law is to be found in the relation between these two points of view.\n\nHere, Windelband introduces the claim that although ideal norms differ from causal laws, they are not incommensurable with them and, in fact, act on us causally. His argument builds on his conception of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d as the representation of the system of absolute values within empirical consciousness. Windelband argues that a mind that becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d is capable of acting on the basis of and in agreement with the norms that it has discovered within itself:\n\n[E]ach norm carries with it a sense that the real process of thinking or willing ought to form itself in accordance with it. With immediate evidence a form of psychological coercion attaches itself to the awareness of the norm. (1882a: 85)\n\nThe norm becomes a determining factor in and for empirical consciousness. It acts as \u201cpart of the causal law\u201d and determines psychological life with natural necessity (1882a: 87; see also 1883: 122).\n\nThe result is what Windelband calls a \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d (1882a: 88), according to which freedom consists in nothing other than the becoming-aware of the norms that command how we ought to act: our becoming-aware of them determines our actions with natural necessity. Freedom is the \u201cdetermination of empirical consciousness by normal consciousness\u201d (1882a: 88).\n\nBut Windelband still needs to explain how it is possible that we can be aware of a moral norm and not act on it. Long passages in the 1904 lectures are devoted to developing the thought that what determines our moral decisions and actions, and hence decisions if and when we act in accordance with the moral law is our \u201cpersonality\u201d. Windelband approaches this as a theoretical, not as a normative, question and concludes that we may well call those decisions and actions \u201cfree\u201d that are predominantly determined by our constant personality, as opposed to being determined by external circumstances or contingent affects. Freedom is \u201cthe unhindered causality of a pre-existing willing\u201d (1904b: 106).\n\nHowever, Windelband concedes that this analysis does not exhaust our concept of freedom since there is not merely a theoretical, but also a normative use of the concept. In this context, Windelband acknowledges the attraction of the Kantian argument that moral responsibility is possible only if we have transcendental free will and with it the capacity for genuine alternatives: we could act differently given the same circumstances. But Windelband rejects the project of grounding human freedom in a noumenal world. He thinks that Kant\u2019s distinction between an intelligible noumenal self that is the uncaused cause of our actions, and a deterministic empirical world as constructed by our understanding reproduces the same problems that earlier metaphysical accounts of freedom had encountered. He discusses two problems in particular.\n\nFirst, on the one hand, the personality that a particular individual has developed is part of the empirical world and therefore, on the metaphysical picture, does not feature into the free decisions of the individual. But, on the other hand, the noumenal self is empty. It is an abstract, general self, uniform in all of us; and thus it cannot account for the differences in the moral life of individuals (1904b: 161\u2013163).\n\nSecond, transcendental freedom is fundamentally incompatible with the \u201call- encompassing reality and causality of the deity\u201d (1904b: 187). God is the ultimate uncaused cause, and the only way to understand this thought is by assuming a \u201ctimeless causality\u201d between God and the intelligible characters (noumenal selves)\u2014a view which ends up undermining the freedom of the latter (1904b: 186\u20139)\n\nHaving concluded that Kantian dualism fails to avoid the pitfalls of earlier metaphysical approaches to freedom, Windelband abandons the concept of transcendental freedom altogether. But while in 1882 his alternative had been the \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d, in 1904 Windelband proceeds to articulate the view that the concept of free will is a mere placeholder in our normative discourse. We are not free in the metaphysical sense, but we are perfectly entitled to pass moral judgment. And we use the language of freedom to express the fact that when passing moral judgment we disregard questions of causal determination.\n\nTo spell out this idea, Windelband takes up the 1882 distinction between the \u201cpoints of view\u201d of explanatory science and ideal norms. He now argues that there are two ways of constructing the world of appearances: we construct the world of appearances according to causal laws, and we construct it according to our normative evaluations. Evaluation\n\nreflects within the manifoldness of the given on those moments only which can be put in relation to the norm\u2026 [O]ne could call the manner in which the objects of experience, the given manifoldness of the factual, appear uniformly in light of such an evaluation another form of \u201cappearance\u201d\u2026. (1904b: 195\u20136)\n\nFreedom then means not that the will is an uncaused cause. When speaking of freedom, we appeal to the uncaused merely in the sense that we evaluate matters independently of causal deterministic processes (1904b: 197\u2013198).\n\nWindelband believes that his view preserves moral responsibility. As described above, his theoretical investigation had yielded the result that that which determines the extent to which we act in agreement with a moral norm is our personality or character. Personality is the constant cause of voluntary action, it determines our actions necessarily according to general psychological laws. From a practical standpoint, personality then is also the ultimate object of moral appraisal. We hold personality responsible, and we are justified in doing so, even if the formation of personality is itself a causal process over which the individual has no control. Ultimately, the upshot of Windelband\u2019s discussion is that moral responsibility does not presuppose a noumenal world and transcendental freedom, because it does not presuppose that we could act otherwise. It merely presupposes that another person in the same circumstances could act otherwise. The idea that one could have acted differently refers\n\nnot to the concrete human being in these concrete circumstances, but to the generic concept of the human being. (1904b: 212)\n\n5. The Natural and the Historical Sciences\n\nIn Windelband\u2019s view, a reconsideration of the Kantian project is not only necessary because of its inherent tensions; broader developments in nineteenth-century culture and science also necessitate an adaptation of the critical method to changed historical circumstances. One important factor is the professionalization of the historical disciplines that had been underway since the early nineteenth century (1907: 12). One of Windelband\u2019s central and best known philosophical contributions concerns the question what distinguishes the \u201chistorical sciences\u201d, that is, those disciplines that study the human-historical and cultural world, from the natural sciences. Windelband\u2019s answer to this question is in line with his formal-teleological conception of philosophy: by explicating the autonomous presuppositions of historical method, critical philosophy safeguards the historical sciences against methodological holism, namely the view that there is only one scientific method, and that this is the method of physics and natural science.\n\nWindelband shares the goal of securing the autonomy of the historical disciplines with his contemporary Wilhelm Dilthey. In his 1883 Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften [Introduction to the human sciences] Dilthey had founded the distinction between the natural sciences and the human sciences or \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on a distinction between outer and inner experience. While outer experience forms the basis of hypothetical knowledge in natural science, inner experience discloses \u201cfrom within\u201d how the individual is an intersection of social and cultural relations (Dilthey 1883: 30\u201332, 60\u201361, 88\u201389). Inner experience is at the same time psychological and socio-historical, and a descriptive psychology capable of grasping the integrated nexus of inner experience can provide the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d with a solid foundation (Dilthey 1894).\n\nWindelband profoundly disagrees with Dilthey\u2019s strategy for demarcating the historical disciplines. In his Strasbourg rector\u2019s address \u201cGeschichte und Naturwissenschaft\u201d [\u201cHistory and natural science\u201d] from 1894, he takes issue with the suggestion that the facts of the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d derive from a particular type of experience. He takes Dilthey to endorse an introspective view of psychological method. To this he objects that the facts of the historical disciplines do not derive from inner experience alone, and that inner perception is a dubious method in the first place. He also classifies psychology with the natural sciences, rejecting Dilthey\u2019s idea that the human-historical disciplines could be founded on a non-explanatory and non-hypothetical descriptive psychology. Perhaps most fundamentally, Windelband rejects the term \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on the ground that it suggests that the distinction between different sciences rests on a material distinction between different objects: spirit and nature (Windelband 1894: 141\u2013143).\n\nWindelband seeks an alternative method for science-classification that is purely formal. His reflections take scientific justification in its most abstract form as their starting point: justification in science is either inductive or deductive, Windelband argues, and the basic relation on which all knowledge is based is between the general and the particular (1883: 102\u2013103).\n\nThe distinction between different empirical sciences is then also to be sought at this level. In particular, Windelband argues that science might pursue one of two different \u201cknowledge goals\u201d (1894: 143): it \u201ceither seeks the general in the form of natural law or the particular in the historically determined form\u201d (1894: 145). The former approach is that of the \u201cnomothetic sciences\u201d which seek to arrive at universal apodictic judgments, treating the particular and unique as a mere exemplar or special case of the type or of the generic concept. The \u201cidiographic sciences\u201d, in contrast, aim to arrive at singular assertoric judgments that represent a unique object in its individual formation (1894: 150).\n\nWindelband emphasizes that the distinction between nomothetic and idiographic sciences is a purely formal and teleological one. One and the same object can be approached from both points of view, and which method is appropriate depends entirely on the goal or purpose of the investigation. Moreover, most sciences will involve both general and particular knowledge. The idiographic sciences in particular depend on general and causal knowledge which has been derived from the nomothetic sciences (1894: 156\u2013157).\n\nNote, however, that Windelband is not consistently restricting his analysis to the formal level. He tends to use the terms \u201cnomothetic\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d sciences, and the terms \u201cidiographic\u201d and \u201chistorical\u201d sciences interchangeably, which at least suggests a correspondence between scientific goals, methods, and objects.\n\nAlthough Windelband does not spell this out in great detail, he also suggests that values are of integral importance to the idiographic method. First, he argues that the selection of relevant historical facts depends on an assessment of what is valuable to us (1894: 153\u2013154). Second, he suggests that the integration of particular facts into larger wholes is only possible if meaningful, value-laden relations can be established such that \u201cthe particular feature is a meaningful part of a living intuition of the whole [Gesamtanschauung]\u201d (1894: 154). And third, he claims that we value the particular, unique, and individual in a way in which we do not value the general and recurrent, and that the experience of the individual is indeed at the root of our \u201cfeelings of value\u201d (1894: 155\u2013156).\n\nIt is Windelband\u2019s student Heinrich Rickert who takes up these suggestions and develops them into a systematic account of the \u201cindividuating\u201d and \u201cvalue-relating\u201d \u201cconcept-formation\u201d of the \u201chistorical sciences of culture\u201d (Rickert 1902). Rickert argues that \u201cscientific concept formation\u201d, by which science overcomes the \u201cextensive and intensive manifold\u201d of reality, depends on a principle of selection. The principle of selection at work in the natural sciences is that of \u201cgeneralization\u201d. For this reason, the natural sciences cannot account for the unique and unrepeatable character of reality. The historical sciences, in contrast, form their concepts in a manner that allows them to capture individual realities (Rickert 1902: 225, 236, 250\u2013251). They do so on the basis of values: values guide the selection of which particular historical facts belong to and can be integrated into a specific historical \u201cindividuality\u201d (examples being \u201cthe Renaissance\u201d, \u201cthe Reformation\u201d or \u201cthe German nation state\u201d). According to Rickert, one can clearly distinguish the theoretical value-relation that is the basis of historical science and practical evaluation. The historian relies on values but does not evaluate his material (Rickert 1902: 364\u2013365). Building on Windelband\u2019s core ideas about historical method, Rickert arrives at a more refined and systematized account of how historical science forms its concepts, that ultimately leads to an account of what culture as an object of scientific study amounts to.\n\nIn some of his later writings, Windelband will pick up the more developed thoughts of his student Rickert. For example, he claims that each science creates its objects according to the manner in which it forms its concepts (1907: 18), and that the historical sciences rely on a system of universal values when making selections about what enters into their concepts (1907: 20).\n\n6. The History of Philosophical Problems\n\nA large part of Windelband\u2019s oeuvre consists of writings in the history of philosophy. Windelband primarily covers modern philosophy from the Renaissance to his own time, but he also published on ancient philosophy. As a historian, Windelband is heavily indebted to Fischer. And yet, he goes significantly beyond his teacher, developing a new method and mode of historical presentation. Windelband conceives of the history of philosophy as a \u201chistory of problems\u201d. Rather than presenting a chronological sequence of great minds, he organizes the presentation of philosophical ideas according to the fundamental problems around which the philosophical debates and arguments of an age were structured. Windelband also takes a reflective attitude towards his own historiographical practice and seeks to clarify the goals and systematic relevance of the history of philosophy.\n\nIn these reflections, Windelband seeks to integrate two main thoughts: First, the idea that philosophy is a reflection of its time and age and, second, the conviction that the history of philosophy has systematic significance. Windelband finds both thoughts in Hegel\u2019s approach to the history of philosophy. Mirroring Hegel\u2019s famous dictum that \u201cphilosophy is its own time apprehended in thought\u201d, he speaks of philosophy the \u201cself-consciousness of developing cultural life\u201d (1909: 4). He also applauds Hegel\u2019s \u201cdeep insight\u201d that the history of philosophy realizes reason and thus has intrinsic relevance for systematic philosophy (1883: 133). Windelband thinks of history as the \u201corganon of philosophy\u201d (1905: 184), as a guide to the absolute values that the critical method seeks to reveal.\n\nBut despite the Hegelian gloss of these two claims, Windelband is critical of Hegelianism. This is primarily because he has a different understanding of the idea that philosophy is \u201cits own time apprehended in thought\u201d. For Windelband, this means that philosophical thinking is shaped by historically contingent factors.\n\nAccordingly, Windelband formulates two criticisms of the Hegelian conception of the history of philosophy. First, he finds fault with the idea that the order in which successive philosophical ideas emerge is necessary and that\u2014in virtue of being necessary\u2014it has systematic significance:\n\n[I]n its essentially empirical determination which is accidental with respect to the \u201cidea\u201d the historical process of development cannot have this systematic significance. (1883: 133, see also 1905: 176\u2013177)\n\nThe history of philosophy is not only shaped by the necessary self-expression of reason, but also by the causal necessity of cultural history. The cultural determinants of philosophical thinking lead to \u201cproblem-convolutions\u201d (1891: 11), in which various, conceptually unrelated philosophical questions merge with one another. Windelband also emphasizes that the \u201cindividual factor\u201d of the philosopher\u2019s character and personality is relevant for how philosophical problems and concepts are articulated in a given historical moment (1891: 12)\n\nSecond, although Windelband agrees that the historical development of philosophical ideas is partly driven by critique and self-improvement, he does not think of this process in terms of progress. Windelband probes the often unacknowledged presuppositions of our talk about progress. In \u201cPessimismus und Wissenschaft\u201d (1876) Windelband argues that science cannot decide between historical optimism and historical pessimism (1876: 243). In \u201cKritische und genetische Methode\u201d (1883) he gives a more detailed analysis of why this is the case. Historical change itself is not progress, he observes. In order to determine whether a given historical development is progressive, we need to be in possession of \u201ca standard, the idea of a purpose, which determines the value of the change\u201d (1883: 119). Windelband is wary of triumphalist narratives that identify the historical development of present-day values with progress. History is determined by contingent cultural factors and could have produced \u201cdelusions and follies \u2026 which we only take to be truths now because we are inescapably trapped in them\u201d (1883: 121). Of progress we can only speak legitimately, if we are in possession of an absolute value that allows us to assess the historical development. At minimum, this means that the appeal to a progressive history of philosophy is of no help when it comes to the systematic task of uncovering the system of absolute values: progress cannot aid in revealing absolute values as it presupposes them.\n\nBut while the fact that philosophy is at least partly determined by contingent cultural factors undercuts necessity and progress, it also opens the door for a reconceptualization of the \u201cessence\u201d of philosophy. In his Einleitung in die Philosophie [Introduction to philosophy] (1914) Windelband reflects on the fact that everyday life, culture, and science do already contain general concepts of the world. These concepts form the initial content of philosophical reflection (1914: 6). But the business of philosophy only takes off when these initial concepts, and the assumptions that are baked into them, become unstable and collapse. An experience of shock and unsettling prompts philosophy to question, rethink, and critically assess the concepts and ideas of everyday life and science. In this process of critical assessment, philosophy strives to purify these concepts and ideas, and to connect them into a coherent, unified system. According to Windelband, in this process of conceptual reorganization, a rational necessity exerts itself. The \u201cvigorous and uncompromising rethinking of the preconditions of our spiritual life\u201d creates certain philosophical problems \u201cwith objective necessity\u201d (1914: 8).\n\nWindelband provides neither a very detailed account of what \u201cphilosophical problems\u201d exactly are, nor of how precisely they spring from the unsettling of everyday concepts. But he makes three claims that, taken together, establish that philosophy, even when reflecting its particular age, is not solely determined by contingent cultural factors. First, philosophical puzzles stem from the \u201cinadequacy and contradictory imbalance\u201d of the contents that philosophy receives from life and science (1891: 10). That is, true philosophical problems emerge whenever the systematizing drive of philosophy is confronted with the deep incoherence of life. Second, philosophical problems are necessary because the conceptual \u201cmaterial\u201d found in life already contains \u201cthe objective presuppositions and logical coercions for all rational deliberation about it\u201d (1891: 10). The necessity of philosophical problems is logical necessity. Third, despite historical change\n\n[c]ertain differences of world- and life-attitudes reoccur over and over again, combat each other and destroy each other in mutual dialectics. (1914: 10)\n\nBecause philosophical problems emerge \u201cnecessarily\u201d and \u201cobjectively\u201d, they also reoccur throughout history. Philosophical problems are thus timeless and eternal (1891: 9\u201310; 1914: 11)).\n\nWindelband also believes that the history of philosophy, pursued empirically and scientifically, can disentangle from one another the \u201ctemporal causes and timeless reasons\u201d (1905: 189) that together give rise to the emergence of philosophical problems.\n\nOnly through knowledge of the empirical trajectory that is free of constructions can come to light \u2026. what is the share of \u2026 the needs of the age on the one hand\u2026but on the other hand that of the objective necessities of conceptual progress. (1905: 189)\n\nAt this point, Windelband reaches a clear verdict on the goal and systematic significance of the history of philosophy: it lies in disentangling that which is contingently actually accepted from that which is \u201cvalid in itself\u201d (1905: 199). History is the \u201corganon of critical philosophy\u201d precisely to the extent that it allows us to distinguish the actually accepted norms of cultural life from that which is absolutely valid (1883: 132).\n\n7. Critical Philosophy and World-Views\n\nWindelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d is also an intervention into debates that had preoccupied the neo-Kantian movement and German academic philosophy more broadly since the materialism controversy [Materialismusstreit]: what the relation between science and world-views is, and whether philosophy is capable of providing a \u201cworld-view\u201d.\n\nGiven that he takes the core of the critical project to consist in a quaestio juris\u2014a concern with normativity\u2014it seems surprising that throughout the 1880s Windelband insists that critical philosophy does not provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d: the project of revealing the highest values of human life has nothing to do with \u201cworld-views\u201d, he argues, because it does not provide a metaphysical account of the world and our place in it (1881: 140\u2013141, 145). Questions about optimism or pessimism cannot be answered by means of \u201cscientific\u201d philosophy, since they depend on the idea that the world as a whole has a purpose. And claims about the ultimate purpose of the world arise only from an unscientific, subjective, and arbitrary projection of particular purposes onto the universe as such (1876: 231). Philosophy is a science, albeit a second-order formal science, and is thus barred from formulating a world-view that would be metaphysical in character.\n\nAfter 1900, however, Windelband\u2019s position on the question of world-views changes. He now claims that it is the aim of philosophy to provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d with scientific justification (1907: 1). Given that Windelband holds that philosophy in general and the Kantian project in particular need to be adapted to the developing circumstances of time and culture, this change of position is not inconsequential: the cultural landscape of the early 1900s demands a revision of the neo-Kantian project that highlights not only its \u201cnegative\u201d and critical aspects, but also develops its positive implications for cultural life (1907, 8). The shift to a more positive attitude towards philosophy as a world-view corresponds to a re-evaluation of Kant\u2019s oeuvre, in which Windelband at least partly suspends the anti-metaphysical rigor of the \u201cthird phase\u201d of the genesis of the Critique of Pure Reason, and attributes more relevance to the Critique of the Power of Judgment. This view is taken up by Rickert, who later argues in more detail that the third Critique forms the core of critical philosophy, and that Kant\u2019s metaphysical project can provide the basis for an encompassing theory of world-views (Rickert 1924: 153\u2013168).\n\nIn his 1904 \u201cNach hundert Jahren\u201d [\u201cAfter one hundred years\u201d] Windelband provides yet another take on the relation between the natural and the normative. Declaring the question how the realm of natural laws is related to the realm of values to be the \u201chighest\u201d philosophical endeavor (1904a: 162), he now sees in the Critique of the Power of Judgment the possibility of solving this problem: here one finds the idea that the purposive system of nature gives rise to the value-determined process of human history. The central concept that allows for connecting nature and history in this way is that of \u201crealization\u201d (1904a: 162\u20133).\n\nThe turn to the concept of \u201crealization\u201d also leads to a shift in how Windelband approaches the problem of science classification. In 1894, Windelband had thought of the nomothetic and idiographic sciences as two fundamental yet disjointed and even incommensurable approaches to seeking knowledge of the word: \u201cLaw and event persist next to each other as the last, incommensurable factors of our representation of the world\u201d (1894: 160). But in 1904, he claims that the concept of realization provides a common, unified basis for the natural and the historical sciences (1904a: 163).\n\nWindelband\u2019s language assumes a Hegelian tone. Critical philosophy equipped with the concept of realization is able to grasp and express the \u201cspiritual value content\u201d of reality (1904a: 165). History is capable of revealing the universal value content in the contingent maze of human interests and desires, and in so doing captures \u201cthe progressive realization of rational values\u201d (1907: 20\u201321). The human as a rational being is not determined psychologically or naturally, but humanity is a historical task: \u201conly as a historical being, as the developing species, do we have a share in world-reason\u201d (1910a: 283: see also 1905: 185). Windelband even suggests that history itself has a goal, namely the realization of a common humanity (1908: 257).\n\nThese remarks remain cursory however, and there is room for debate over how much of Hegel\u2019s ontology of history Windelband takes on board, as well as whether his talk about the progressive realization of reason in history is incompatible with the formal-teleological method that he had endorsed in the 1880s and 1890s. His \u201cKulturphilosophie und transzendentaler Idealismus\u201d [\u201cPhilosophy of culture and transcendental idealism\u201d] of 1910 presents us with a puzzling fusion of Kantian and Hegelian language. The goal of critical philosophy is that of revealing the unity of culture, Windelband now claims, and this unity can only be found"}, {"url": "https://iep.utm.edu/neo-kant/", "page_content": "Neo-Kantianism\n\nBy its broadest definition, the term \u2018Neo-Kantianism\u2019 names any thinker after Kant who both engages substantively with the basic ramifications of his transcendental idealism and casts their own project at least roughly within his terminological framework. In this sense, thinkers as diverse as Schopenhauer, Mach, Husserl, Foucault, Strawson, Kuhn, Sellers, Nancy, Korsgaard, and Friedman could loosely be considered Neo-Kantian. More specifically, \u2018Neo-Kantianism\u2019 refers to two multifaceted and internally-differentiated trends of thinking in the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth-Centuries: the Marburg School and what is usually called either the Baden School or the Southwest School. The most prominent representatives of the former movement are Hermann Cohen, Paul Natorp, and Ernst Cassirer. Among the latter movement are Wilhelm Windelband and Heinrich Rickert. Several other noteworthy thinkers are associated with the movement as well.\n\nNeo-Kantianism was the dominant philosophical movement in German universities from the 1870\u2019s until the First World War. Its popularity declined rapidly thereafter even though its influences can be found on both sides of the Continental/Analytic divide throughout the twentieth century. Sometimes unfairly cast as narrowly epistemological, Neo-Kantianism covered a broad range of themes, from logic to the philosophy of history, ethics, aesthetics, psychology, religion, and culture. Since then there has been a relatively small but philosophically serious effort to reinvigorate further historical study and programmatic advancement of this often neglected philosophy.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Proto Neo-Kantians\n\nDuring the first half of the Nineteenth-Century, Kant had become something of a relic. This is not to say that major thinkers were not strongly influenced by Kantian philosophy. Indeed there are clear traces in the literature of the Weimar Classicists, in the historiography of Bartold Georg Niebuhr (1776-1831) and Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886), in Wilhelm von Humboldt\u2019s philosophy of language (1767-1835), and in Johannes Peter M\u00fcller\u2019s (1801-1858) physiology. Figures like Schleiermacher (1768-1834), Immanuel Hermann Fichte (1796-1879), Friedrich Eduard Beneke (1798-1854), Christian Hermann Wei\u00dfe (1801-1866), the Fries-influenced J\u00fcrgen Bona Meyer (1829-1897), the Frenchman Charles Renouvier (1815-1903), the evangelical theologian Albrecht Ritschl (1822-1889), and the great historian of philosophy Friedrich Ueberweg (1826-1871), made calls to heed Kant\u2019s warning about transgressing the bounds of possible experience. However, there was neither a systematic nor programmatic school of Kantian thought in Germany for more than sixty years after Kant\u2019s death in 1804.\n\nThe first published use of the term \u2018Neo-Kantianer\u2019 appeared in 1862, in a polemical review of Eduard Zeller by the Hegelian Karl Ludwig Michelet. But it was Otto Liebmann\u2019s (1840-1912) Kant und die Epigonen (1865) that most indelibly heralds the rise of a new movement. Here Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762-1814), Hegel (1770-1831), and Schelling (1775-1854), whose idealist followers held sway in German philosophy departments during the early decades of the 19th Century, are chided for taking over only Kant\u2019s system-building, and for doing so only in a superficial way. They sought to create the world from scratch, as it were, by finding new, more-fundamental first principles upon which to create a stronghold of interlocking propositions, one following necessarily from its predecessor. Insofar as those principles were generated from reflection rather than experience, however, the \u2018descendants\u2019 would effectively embrace Kant\u2019s idealism at the expense of his empirical realism. The steep decline of Hegelianism a generation later opened a vacuum which was to be filled by the counter-movement of scientific materialism, represented by figures like Karl Vogt (1817-1895), Heinrich Czolbe (1819-1873), and Ludwig B\u00fcchner (1824-1899). By reducing speculative philosophy to a system of naturalistic observation consistent with their realism, the materialists utilized a commonsense terminology that reopened philosophical inquiry for those uninitiated in idealist dialectics. Despite their successes in the realm of the natural sciences, the materialists were accused of avoiding serious philosophical problems rather than solving them. This was especially true about matters of consciousness and experience, which the materialists were inclined to treat unproblematically as \u2018given\u2019. Against the failings of both the idealists and the materialists, Liebmann could only repeatedly call, \u201cZur\u00fcck zu Kant!\u201d\n\nThe 1860\u2019s were a sort of watershed for Neo-Kantianism, with a row of works emerging which sought to move past the idealism-materialism debate by returning to the fundamentals of the Kantian Transcendental Deduction. Eduard Zeller\u2019s (1814-1908) Ueber Bedeutung und Aufgabe der Erkenntnishteorie (1862) placed a call similar to Liebmann\u2019s to return to Kant, maintaining a transcendental realism in the spirit of a general epistemological critique of speculative philosophy. Kuno Fischer\u2019s (1824-1907) Kants Leben und die Grundlagen seiner Lehre (1860), and the second volume of his Geschichte der neuern Philosophie (1860) manifested the same call, too, in what remain important commentaries on Kant\u2019s philosophy. Fischer was at first not so concerned to advance a new philosophical system as to correctly understand the more intricate nuances of the true master. These works gained popular influence in part because of their major literary improvement upon the commentaries of Karl Leonhard Reinhold (1757-1823), but in part also because of the controversy surrounding Fischer\u2019s interpretation of Kant\u2019s argument that space is a purely subjective facet of experience. Worried that the ideality of space led inexorably to skepticism, Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg (1802-1872) sought to retain the possibility that space was also empirically real, applicable to the things-in-themselves at least in principle. Fischer returned fire by claiming that treating space as a synthetic a posteriori would effectively annul the necessity of Newtonian science, something Fischer emphasized was at the very heart of the Kantian project. Their spirited quarrel, which enveloped a wide circumference of academics over a twenty-year span, climaxed with Trendelenburg\u2019s highly personal Kuno Fischer und sein Kant (1869) and Fischer\u2019s retaliatory Anti-Trendelenburg (1870). Although such personal diatribes attract popular attention, the genuine philosophical foundations of Neo-Kantianism were laid earlier.\n\nHermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz (1821-94) outstripped even the scientific credentials of the materialists, combining his experimental research with a genuine philosophical sophistication and historical sensitivity. His advances in physiology, ophthalmology, audiology, electro- and thermo-dynamics duly earned him an honored place among the great German scientists. His \u00dcber die Erhaltung der Kraft (1847) ranks only behind The Origin of Species as the most influential scientific treatise of the Nineteenth-Century, even though its principle claim might have been an unattr\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adibuted adoption of the precedent theories by Julius Robert von Mayer (1814-1878) and James Joule (1818-1889). His major philosophical contribution was an attempt to ground Kant\u2019s theoretical division between phenomena and noumena within empirically verifiable sense physiognomy. In place of the materialist\u2019s faith in sense perception as a copy of reality and in advance of Kant\u2019s general ignorance about the neurological conditions of experience, Helmholtz noted that when we see or hear something outside us there is a complicated process of neural stimulation. Experience is neither a direct projection of the perceived object onto our sense organs nor merely a conjunction of concept and sensuous intuition, but an unconscious process of symbolic inferences by which neural stimulations are made intelligible to the human mind.\n\nThe physical processes of the brain are a safer starting point, a scientifically-verifiable ground on which to explain the a priori necessity of experience, than Kant\u2019s supra-naturalistic deduction of conceptual architectonics. Yet two key Kantian consequences are only strengthened thereby. First, experience is revealed to be nothing immediate, but a demonstrably discursive process wherein the material affect of the senses is transformed by subjective factors. Second, any inferences that can possibly be drawn about the world outside the subject must reckon with this subjective side, thereby reasserting the privileged position of epistemology above ontology. Helmholtz and the materialists both thought that Newtonian science was the best explanation of the world; but Helmholtz realized that science must take account of what Kant had claimed of it: science is the proscription of what can be demonstrated within the limits of possible experience rather than an articulation about objects in-themselves. Empirical physiognomy would more precisely proscribe those limits than purely conceptual transcendental philosophy.\n\nFriedrich Albert Lange (1828-1875) was, at least in the Nineteenth-Century, more widely recognized as a theorist of pedagogy and advocate of Marxism in the Vereinstag deutscher Arbeitervereine than as a forerunner to Neo-Kantianism. But his influence on the Marburg school, though brief, was incisive. He took his professorship at Marburg in 1872, one year before Cohen completed his Habilitationschrift there. Lange worked with Cohen for only three years before his untimely death in 1875.\n\nMuch of Lange\u2019s philosophy was conceived before his time in Marburg. As Privatdozent at Bonn, Lange attended Helmholtz\u2019s lectures on the physiology of the senses, and later came to agree that the best way to move philosophy along was by combining the general Kantian insights with a more firmly founded neuro-physiology. In his masterpiece, Geschichte des Materialismus und Kritik seiner Bedeutung in der Gegenwart (1866), Lange argues that materialism is at once the best explanation of phenomena, yet quite na\u00efve in its presumptive inference from experience to the world outside us. The argument is again taken from the progress of the physiological sciences, with Lange providing a number of experiments that reveal experience to be an aggregate construction of neural processes.\n\nWhere he progresses beyond Helmholtz is his recognition that the physiognomic processes themselves must, like every other object of experience, be understood as a product of a subject\u2019s particular constitution. Even while denying the given-ness of sense data, Helmholtz had too often presumed to understand the processes of sensation on the basis of a non-problematic empirical realism. That is, even while Helmholtz viewed knowledge of empirical objects as an aggregate of sense physiognomy, he never sufficiently reflected on the conditions for the experience of that very sense physiognomy. So even while visual experience is regarded as derivative from the physiognomy of the eyes, optic nerves, and brain, how each of these function is considered unproblematically given to empirical experience. For Lange, we cannot so confidently infer that our experience of physiognomic processes corresponds to what is really the case outside our experience of them\u2014that the eyes or ears actually do work as we observe them to\u2014since the argument by which that conclusion is reached is itself physiological. Neither the senses, nor the brain, nor the empirically observable neural processes between them permit the inference that any of these is the causal grounds of our experience of them.\n\nWith such skepticism, Lange would naturally dispense, too, with attempts to ground ethical norms in either theological or rationalistic frameworks. Our normative prescriptions, however seemingly unshakeable by pure practical reason, are themselves operations of a brain, which develop contingently over great spans of evolutionary history. That brain itself is only another experienced representation, nothing which can be considered an immutable and necessary basis of which universal norms could be considered derivative. Lange thought this opened a space for creative narratives and even myths, able to inspire rather than regulate the ethical side of human behavior. Through their mutual philology teacher at Bonn, Friedrich Ritschl, Lange was also a decisive influence on the epistemology and moral-psychology of Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nThe progenitors of Neo-Kantianism, represented principally by Liebmann, Fischer, Trendelenburg, Helmholtz, and Lange, evince a preference for Kant\u2019s theoretical rather than ethical or aesthetical writings. While this tendency would be displaced by both the Marburg school\u2019s social concerns and the Baden school\u2019s concentration on the logic of values, the proto-Neo-Kantians had definite repercussions for later figures like Hans Vaihinger (1852-1933), the so-called empirio-positivists like Richard Avenarius and Ernst Mach, and the founder of the Vienna Circle, Moritz Schlick (1882-1936).\n\n2. Marburg\n\nHerman Cohen (1842-1918) was Lange\u2019s friend and successor, and is usually considered the proper founder of Neo-Kantianism at Marburg. The son of a rabbi in Coswig, he was given a diverse schooling by the historian of Judaism Zacharias Frankel (1801-1875) and the philologist Jacob Bernays (1824-1881). Moving to Berlin, he studied philosophy under Trendelenburg, philology under August Boeckh (1785-1867), culture and linguistics with Heymann Steinthal (1823-1899), and physiology with Emil Du Bois-Reymond (1818-1896). One of his earliest papers, \u201cZur Controverse zwischen Trendelenburg und Kuno Fischer\u201d (1871), was a sort of coming-out in academic society. Against Fischer, the attempt above all to understand the letter of Kant perfectly \u2013even the problems that persisted in his work\u2014was tantamount to historicizing what ought to be a living engagement with serious philosophical problems. Although roughly on the side of his teacher Trendelenburg, Cohen stood mostly on his own ground in denying that objectivity required any appeal to extra-mental objects. Granted a professorship at the University of Marburg in 1876, Cohen came to combine Kant-interpretation with Lange\u2019s instinct to develop Kant\u2019s thinking in light of contemporary developments: a \u201cVerbindung der systematischen und historischen Aufgabe.\u201d It was Cohen who published Lange\u2019s Logische Studien (1877) posthumously and produced several new editions of his Geschichte des Materialismus. More interested in logic than science, however, Cohen took Lange\u2019s initiatives in a decidedly epistemological direction.\n\nCohen\u2019s early work consists mainly in critical engagements with Kant: Kants Theorie der Erfahrung (1871), Kants Begr\u00fcndung der Ethik (1877), and Kants Begr\u00fcndung der Aesthetik (1889). Where he progresses beyond Kant is most plainly in his attempt to overcome the Kantian dualism between intuition and discursive thinking. Cohen argues that formal a priori laws of the mind not only affect how we think about external objects, but actually constitute those objects for us. \u201cThinking produces that which is held to be\u201d (Logik der reinen Erkenntnis [Berlin 1902], 67). That is, the laws of the mind not only provide the form but the content of experience, leaving Cohen with a more idealistic picture of experience than Kant\u2019s empirical realism would have warranted. These laws lie beyond, as it were, both Kant\u2019s conceptual categories as well as Helmholtz\u2019s and Lange\u2019s physiognomic processes, the latter of which Cohen considered unwarrantedly naturalistic. The transcendental conditions of experience lay in the most fundamental rules of mathematical thinking, such that metaphysics, properly understood, is the study of the laws that make possible mathematical, and by derivation, scientific thinking. While Cohen did not deny the importance of the categories of the understanding or of the necessity of sensuous processes within experience, his own advancement beyond these entailed that an object was experienced and only could be experienced in terms of the formal rules of mathematics. The nature of philosophical investigation becomes, in Cohen\u2019s hands, neither a physiognomic investigation of the brain or senses as persistent \u2018things\u2019 nor a transcendental deduction of the concepts of the understanding and the necessary faculties of the mind, but an exposition of the a priori rules that alone make possible any and every judgment. The world itself is the measure of all possible experience.\n\nThe view had a radical implication for the notion of a Kantian self. Kant never much doubted that something persistent was the fundament on which judgment was constructed. He denied that this thing was understandable in the way either materialism or commonsense presumed, of course, but posited a transcendental unity of apperception as, at least, the logically-necessary ground for experience. Cohen replaces the \u2018unity\u2019 of a posited self, and indeed any \u2018faculties\u2019 of the mind, with a variety of \u2018rules\u2019, \u2018methods\u2019, and \u2018procedures\u2019. What we are is not a \u2018thing\u2019, but a series of logical acts. The importance of his view can be illustrated in terms of Cohen\u2019s theoretical mathematics, especially his notions of continuity and the infinitesimally small. Neither of these is an object, obviously, in the views of materialists or empiricists. And even idealists were at pains to decipher how either could be represented. By treating both as rules for thinking rather than persistent things, Cohen was able to show their respective necessities in terms of what sorts of everyday experiences would be made impossible without them. Continuity becomes an indispensable rule for thinking about any objects in time, while the infinitesimally smallest thing becomes an indispensable rule for thinking about the composition of objects in space. Though a substantial departure from the Kantian ascription of faculties, Cohen never prided himself so much on ascertaining and propagating the conclusions of Kant as on applying Kant\u2019s transcendental method to its sincerest conclusions.\n\nLike his Marburg colleagues, Cohen is sometimes unfairly cast as an aloof logical hair-splitter. Quite the contrary, he was deeply engaged in ethics as well as in the social and cultural debates of his time. His approach to them is also based on a generally Kantian methodology, which he sometimes dubbed a \u2018social idealism\u2019. Dismissing the practical and applied aspects of Kant\u2019s ethics as needlessly individualistic psychology, he stressed the importance of Kant\u2019s project of grounding ethical laws in practical reason, therein presenting for the first time a transcendentally necessary ought. This necessity holds for humanity generally, insofar as humanity is considered generally and not in terms of the privileges or disadvantages of particular individuals. Virtues like truthfulness, honor, and justice, which relate to the concept of humanity, thus take priority over sympathy or empathy, which operate on particular individuals and their circumstances. Like both experience and ethical life, civil laws could only be justified insofar as they were necessary, in terms of their intersubjective determinability. Because class-strata effectually inculcate authoritative relationships of power, a democratic \u2013or better\u2014 a socialist society that effaced autocratically decreed legal dicta would better fulfill Kant\u2019s exhortation to treat people as ends rather than means, as both legislators and legislated at the same time. However, Cohen thought that then-contemporary socialist ideals put too much stock in the economic aspects of Marx\u2019s theory, and in their place tried to instill a greater concentration on the spiritual and cultural side of human social life. Cohen\u2019s grounding of socialism in a Kantian rather than Marxist framework thus circumvents some of its statist and materialist overtones, as Lange also tried to do in his 1865 Die Arbeiterfrage.\n\nHermann Cohen also remains important for his contributions to Jewish thought. In proportion to his decreasing patriotism in Germany, he became an increasingly unabashed stalwart of Judaism in his later writing, and indeed is still considered by many to be the greatest Jewish thinker of his century. After his retirement from Marburg in 1912, he taught at the Berlin Lehranstalt f\u00fcr die Wissenschaft des Judentums. His posthumous Die Religion der Vernunft aus den Quellen des Judentums (1919) maintains that the originally Jewish method of religious thinking \u2013its monotheism\u2014 reveals it as a \u201creligion of reason,\u201d a systematic and methodological attempt to think through the mysteries of the natural world and to construct a universal system of morality ordered under a single universal divine figure. As such, religion is not simply an ornament to society or a mere expression of feelings, but an entirely intrinsic aspect of human culture. The grand summation of these various strands of his thought was to have been collated into a unified theory of culture, but only reached a planning stage before his death in 1918. Even had he completed it, Cohen\u2019s fierce advocacy of socialism and fiercer defense of Judaism, especially in Germany, would have made an already adverse academic life increasingly difficult.\n\nCohen\u2019s student Paul Natorp (1854-1924) was a trained philologist, a renowned interpreter of Plato and of Descartes, a composer, a mentor to Pasternak, Barth, and Cassirer, and an influence on the thought of Husserl, Heidegger, and Gadamer. Arriving at Marburg in 1881, much of Natorp\u2019s career was concerned with widening the sphere of influence of Cohen\u2019s interpretation of Kant and with tracing the historical roots of what he understood to be the essence of critical philosophy. For Natorp, too, the necessity of Neo-Kantian philosophizing lie in overcoming the speculations of the idealists and in joining philosophy again with natural science by means of limiting discourse to that which lay within the bounds of possible experience, in overcoming the Kantian dualism of intuition and discursive thinking.\n\nHowever close their philosophies, Natorp stresses more indelibly the experiential side of thinking than did Cohen\u2019s concentration on the logical features of thought. Natorp saw it as a positive advance on Kant to articulate the formal rules of scientific inquiry not as a set of axioms, but as an exposition of the rules\u2014the methods for thinking scientifically\u2014to the extreme that the importance of the conclusions reached by those rules becomes subsidiary to the rules themselves. Knowledge is an \u2018Aufgabe\u2019 or task, guided by logic, to make the undetermined increasingly more determined. Accordingly, the Kantian \u2018thing-itself\u2019 ceases to be an object that lies outside possible experience, but a sort of regulative ideal that of itself spurs the understanding to work towards its fulfillment. That endless call to new thinking along specifically ordered lines is just what Natorp means by scientific inquiry\u2014a normative requirement to think further rather than a set of achieved conclusions. Thus, where Kant began with a transcendental logic in order to ground math and the natural sciences, Natorp began with the modes of thinking found already in the experimental processes of good science and the deductions of mathematics as evidence of what conditions are necessarily at play in thinking generally. The necessities of math and science do not rest, as they arguably do for Kant, upon the psychological idiosyncrasies of the rational mind, but are self-sufficient examples of what constitutes objective thinking. Thus philosophy itself, as Natorp conceived it, does not begin with the psychological functions of a rational subject and work towards its products. It begins with a critical observation of those objectively real formations\u2014mathematical and scientific thinking\u2014to ground how the mind itself must have worked in order to produce them.\n\nOne of the consequences of Natorp\u2019s concentration on the continual process of methodological thinking was his acknowledgement that a proper exposition of its laws required an historical basis. Science, as the set of formal rules for thinking, begins to inquire by reflecting on why a thing is, not just that it is. Whenever that critical reflection on the methods of scientific thinking occurs, there ensues a sort of historical rebirth that generates a new cyclical age of scientific inquiry. This reflection, Natorp thought, involves rethinking how one considers that object: a genetic rather than static reflection on the changing conditions for the possibility of thinking along the lines of the continuing progress of science.\n\nPlato\u2019s notion of ideal forms marks the clearest occasion of \u2013to borrow Kuhn\u2019s designation for a similar notion\u2014a paradigm shift. Under Natorp\u2019s interpretation, Plato\u2019s forms are construed not as real subsistent entities that lie beyond common human experience, but regulative hypotheses intended to guide thinking along systematic lines. No transcendent things per se, the forms are transcendental principles about the possibility of the human experience of objects. In this sense, Natorp presented Plato as a sort of Marburg Neo-Kantian avant le lettre, a view which garnered little popularity.\n\nLike Cohen, Natorp also had significant cultural interests, and thought that the proper engagement with Kant\u2019s thought had the potential to lead to a comprehensive philosophy of culture. Not as interested as Cohen in the philosophy of religion, it is above all in Natorp\u2019s pedagogical writings that he espouses a social-democratic, anti-dogmatic ideal of education, the goal of which was not an orthodox body of knowledge but an attunement to the lines along which we think so as to reach knowledge. Education ought to be an awareness of the \u2018Aufgabe\u2019 of further determining the yet undetermined. Accordingly, the presentation of information in a lecture was thought to be intrinsically stilting, in comparison to the guided process of a quasi-Socratic method of question and answer. An educator of considerable skill, among his students were Karl Vorl\u00e4nder (1860-1928), Nicolai Hartmann (1882-1950), Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset (1883-1955), and Boris Pasternak (1890-1960).\n\nErnst Cassirer (1874-1945) is usually considered the last principle figure of the Marburg school of Neo-Kantianism. Entering Marburg to study with Cohen himself in 1896, though he would never teach there, Cassirer adopted both the school\u2019s historicist leanings and its emphasis on transcendental argumentation. Indeed, he stands as one of the last great comprehensive thinkers of the West, equal parts epistemologist, logician, philosopher of science, cultural theorist, and historian of thought. His final work, written after having immigrated to America in the wake of Nazi Germany, wove together Cohen\u2019s defense of Judaism together with his own observations of the fascist employment of mythic symbolism to form a comprehensive critique of the Myth of the State (published posthumously in 1946). His wide interests were not accidental, but a direct consequence of his lifelong attempt to show the logical and creative aspects of human life \u2013the Naturwissenschaften and Geisteswissenschaften\u2014 as integrally entwined within the characteristically human mode of mentality: the symbolic form.\n\nCassirer\u2019s earlier historical works adopt the basic view of history promulgated by Natorp. The development of the history of ideas takes the form of na\u00efve progresses interrupted by a series of fundamental reconsiderations of the epistemological methods that gave rise to those progresses, through Plato, Galileo, Spinoza, Leibniz, and Kant. Like Natorp, too, the progress of the history of ideas is, for Cassirer, the march of the problems and solutions constructed by the naturally progressive structure of the human mind. Despite this seemingly teleological framework, Cassirer\u2019s histories of the Enlightenment, of Modernity, of Goethe, Rousseau, Descartes, and of epistemology are generally reliable, lucidly written expositions that aim to contextualize an author\u2019s own thought rather than squeeze it into any particular historiographical framework. A sort of inverse of Hegel, for Cassirer the history of ideas is not reducible to an a priori necessary structure brought about by the nature of reason, but reliable evidence upon which to examine the progression of what problems arise for minds over time.\n\nCassirer\u2019s historicism also led him to rethink Cohen\u2019s notion of the subject. As Cohen thought the self was just a logical placeholder, the subject-term of the various rules of thinking, so Cassirer thought the self was a function that united the various symbolic capacities of the human mind. Yet, that set is not static. What the history of mathematics shows is not a timeless set of a priori rules that can in principle be deciphered within a philosophical logic, but a slow yet fluid shift over time. This is possible, Cassirer argued, because mathematical rules are tied neither to any experience of objects nor to any timeless notion of a context-less subject. Ways of thinking shift over time in response to wider environmental factors, and so do the mathematical and logical forms thereby. Einstein\u2019s relativity theory, of which Cassirer was an important promulgator, underscores Cassirer\u2019s insights especially in its assumption of non-Euclidean geometry. Put into the language of Cassirer\u2019s mature thought, the logical model on which Einsteinian mathematics was based is itself an instantiation not of the single correct outlook on the world, but of a powerful new shift in the symbolic form of science. What Einstein accomplished was not just another theory in a world full of theories, but the remarkably concise formula for a modified way of thinking about the physical world.\n\nThe complete expression of Cassirer\u2019s own philosophy is his three-volume Philosophie der symbolischen Formen (1923-9). In keeping with a general Kantianism, Cassirer argues that the world is not given as such in human experience, but mediated by subject-side factors. Cassirer thought that more complex structures constituted experience and the human necessity to think along certain pre-given lines. What Cassirer adds is a much greater historical sensitivity to earlier forms of human thinking as they were represented in myths and early religious expressions. The more complex and articulate forms of culture \u2013the three major ones are language, myth, and science\u2014 are not a priori necessary across time or cultures, but are achieved by a sort of dialectical solution to problems arising when other cultural forms become unsustainable. Knowledge for Cassirer, unlike Natorp, is not so much the process of determination, but a web of psycho-linguistic relations. The human mind progresses over history through linguistic and cultural forms, from the affective expressions of primitives, to representational language, which situates objects in spatial and temporal relations, to the purely logical and mathematical forms of signification. The unique human achievement is the symbolic form, an energy of the intellect that binds a particular sensory signal to a meaningful general content. By means of symbols, humans not only navigate the world empirically and not only understand the world logically, but make the world meaningful to themselves culturally. This symbolic capacity is indeed what separates the human species from the animals. Accordingly, Cassirer saw himself as having synthesized the Neo-Kantian insights about subjectivity with the roughly Hegelian-themed phenomenology of conscious forms.\n\n3. Baden\n\nThe intellectual pride of the Marburg school fostered a prickly relationship with their fellow neo-Kantians. The rivalry developed with the Baden Neo-Kantians (alternately named the \u201cSouthwest\u201d school) was not so much a competition for the claim to doctrinal orthodoxy as much as what the proper aims and goals of Kant-studies should be. Although it is a generalization, where the Marburg Neo-Kantians sought clarity and methodological precision, the Baden school endeavored to explore wider applications of Kantian thought to contemporary cultural issues. Like their Marburg counterparts, they concerned themselves with offering a third, critical path between speculative idealism and materialism, but turned away from how science or mathematics were grounded in the logic of the mind toward an investigation of the human sciences and the transcendental conditions of values. While they paid greater attention to the spiritual and cultural side of human life than the Marburg school, they were less active in the practical currents of political activity.\n\nWilhelm Windelband (1848-1915), a student of Kuno Fischer and Hermann Lotze (1817-1881), set the tone of the school by claiming that to truly understand Kant was not a matter of philological interpretation\u2013per Fischer\u2014nor a return to Kant\u2013per Liebmann\u2014but of surpassing Kant along the very path he had blazed. Never an orthodox Kantian, he originally said \u201cKant verstehen, hei\u00dft \u00fcber ihn hinausgehen.\u201d Part of that effort sprung from Kant\u2019s distinction between different kinds of judgment as being appropriate to different forms of inquiry. Whereas the Marburg school\u2019s conception of logic was steeped in Kant, Windleband found certain elements of Fichte, Hegel, and Lotze to be fruitful. Moreover, the Marburgers too-hastily applied theoretical judgment to all fields of intellectual investigation summarily, and thereby conflated the methods of natural science with proper thinking as such. This effectively relegated the so-called cultural sciences, like history, sociology, and the arts \u2013 Geisteswissenschaften \u2013 to a subsidiary intellectual rank behind logic, mathematics, and the natural science \u2013 Naturwissenschaften. Windelband thought, on the contrary, that these two areas of inquiry had a separate but equal status. To show that, Windelband needed to prove the methodological rigor of those Geisteswissenschaften, something which had been a stumbling block since the Enlightenment. In a distinctly Kantian vein, he was able to show that the conditions for the possibility of judging the content of any of the Geisteswissenschaften took the shape of idiographic descriptions, which focus on the particular, unique, and contingent. The natural sciences, on the other hand, are generalizing, law-positing, and nomothetic. Idiographic descriptions are intended to inform, nomothetic explanations to demonstrate. The idiographic deals in Gestaltungen, the nomothetic in Gesetze. Both are equally parts of the human endeavor.\n\nThe inclination to seek a more multifaceted conception of subjectivity was a hallmark of the Baden Neo-Kantians. The mind is not a purely mathematical or logical function designed to construct laws and apply them to the world of objects; it works in accordance with the environment in which it operates. What is constructed is done as a response to a need generated by that socio-cultural-historical background. This notion was a sort of leitmotif to Windelband\u2019s own history of philosophy, which for the first time addressed philosophers organically in terms of the philosophical problems they faced and endeavored to solve rather than as either a straightforward chronology, a series of schools, or, certainly, a sort of Hegelian conception of a graduated dialectical unfolding of a single grand idea.\n\nHeinrich Rickert (1863-1936) began his career with a concentration on epistemology. Alongside many Neo-Kantians, he denied the cogency of a thing itself, and thereby reduced an ontology of externalities to a study of the subjective contents of a common, universal mind. Having dissertated under Windelband in 1888 and succeeding him at Heidelberg in 1916, Rickert also came to reject the Marburger\u2019s assumption that the methodologies of natural science were the rules for thinking as such. Rickert argued instead that the mind engages the world along the dual lines of Geisteswissenschaften and Naturwissenschaften according to idiographic or nomothetic judgments respectively, the division which Rickert borrowed from his friend Windelband and elaborated upon (although it is sometimes attributed to Rickert or even Dilthey mistakenly). And similar to him as well, Rickert considered it a major project of philosophy to ground the former in a critical method, as a sort of transcendental science of culture. Where Rickert went his own way was in his critique of scientific explanations insofar as they rested on abstracted generalizations and in his privilege of historical descriptions on account of their attention to life\u2019s genuine particularity and the often irrational character of historical change. Where Windelband saw equality-but-difference between the Geistes\u2014and Naturwissenschaften, Rickert saw the latter as deficient insofar as it was incapable of addressing values.\n\nHistory, for Rickert, was the exemplary case of a human science. Historians write about demonstrable facts in time and space, wherein the truth or falsity of a claim can be demonstrated with roughly the same precision as the natural sciences. The relational links between historical events \u2013 causes, influences, consequences \u2013 rely on mind-centered concepts rather than on observable features of a world outside the historian; though this of itself would not preclude the possibility of at least phenomenal explanations of history. More importantly, historians deal with events which cannot be isolated, repeated, or tested, particular individuals whose actions cannot be subsumed under generalizations, and with human values which resist positive nomothetic explanation. Those values constitute the essence of an historiographical account in a way entirely foreign to the physical sciences, whose objects of inquiry \u2013 atoms, gravitational forces, chemical bonds, etc.\u2014remain value-neutral. A historian passes judgment about the successes and failures of policies, assigns titular appellations from Alexander the Great to Ivan the Terrible, decides who is king and who a tyrant, and regards eras as contributions or hindrances to human progress. The values of historians essentially comprise what story is told about the past, even if this sacrifices history\u2019s status as an exact, demonstrable, or predictive science.\n\nRickert\u2019s differentiation of the methods of history and science has been influential on post-modern continental theorists, in part through his friend and colleague, Karl Jaspers (1883-1969), and through his doctoral student, Martin Heidegger (1889-1976). The traditional scientific reliance on a correspondential theory of truth seemed woefully uncritical and thereby inadequate to the cultural sciences. The very form of reality should be understood as a product of a subject\u2019s judgment. However, Rickert\u2019s recognition of this subjective side did not entangle him in value relativism. Although the historian\u2019s values, for example, do indeed inform the account, Rickert also thought that values were nothing exclusively personal. Values, in fact, express proximate universals across cultures and eras. Philosophy itself, as a critical inquiry into the values that inform judgment, reveals the endurance and trans-cultural nature of values in such a way that grounds the objectivity of an historical account in the objectivity of the values he or she holds. That truth is something that \u2018ought to be sought\u2019 is perhaps one such value. But Rickert has been criticized for believing that the values of historians on issues of personal ethics, the defensibility of wars, the treatment of women, or the social effects of religion were universally agreed upon.\n\n4. Associated Members\n\nTwentieth-century attempts to categorize thinkers historically into this or that school led to some debate about which figures were \u2018really\u2019 Neo-Kantian. But this overlooks the fact that even until the mid-1880\u2019s the term \u2018Neo-Kantian\u2019 was rarely self-appellated. Unlike other more tightly-knit schools of thought, the nature of the Neo-Kantian movement allowed for a number of loosely-associated members, friends, and students, who were seekers of truth first and proponents of a doctrine second. Although each engaged the basic terminology and transcendental framework of either Kant or the Neo-Kantians, none did so wholesale or uncritically.\n\nHans Vaihinger (1852-1933) remains arguably the best scholar of Kant after Fischer and Cohen. And he probably maintained the closest ties with Neo-Kantianism without being assimilated into one or the other school. His massive commentary, begun in 1881 and left unfinished due to his health, exposited not only Kant\u2019s work, but also the history of Neo-Kantian interpretation to that point. He founded the Kant-Studien in 1897, which is both the worldwide heart of Kant studies and the model for all author-based periodicals published in philosophy. Vaihinger\u2019s own philosophy, which resonates in contemporary debates about fictionalism and anti-realism, takes as its starting point a curious blend of Kant, Lange, and Nietzsche in his Die Philosophie des Als-Ob (1911). For Vaihinger, the expressions that stem from our subjective makeup render moot the question whether they correspond to the real world. Not only do the concepts of math and logic have a subjective source, as per many of the Neo-Kantians, but the claims of religion, ethics, and even philosophy turn out to be subjectively-generated illusions that are found to be particularly satisfying to certain kinds of life, and thereafter propagated for the sake of more successfully navigating an unconceptualizable reality in-itself. Human psychology is structured to behave \u2018as-if\u2019 these concepts and mental projections corresponded to the way things really were, though in reality there is no way to prove whether they do. Freedom, a key notion for Vaihinger, is not merely one side of a misunderstanding between reason and the understanding, but a useful projection without which we could neither act nor live.\n\nWilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911) remains alongside Vaihinger as one of the great patrons of Kant scholarship for his work on the Academy Edition of Kant\u2019s works, which began in 1900. Taught by both Fischer in Heidelberg and Trendelenburg in Berlin, Dilthey was strongly influenced by the hermeneutics of Schleiermacher as well, and entwines his Neo-Kantian denial of material realism with the hermeneutical impulse to see judgment as socio-culturally informed interpretation. Dilthey shares with the Baden school the distinction between nomothetic and idiographic sciences. Where he stresses the distinction, though, is slightly different. The natural sciences explain by way of causal relationships, whereas history makes understood by correctly associating particulars and wholes. In this way, the practice of history itself allows us to better understand the Lebenzusammenhang \u2013how all life\u2019s aspects are interconnected\u2014in a way the natural sciences, insofar as they treat the objects of their study as abstract generalizations, cannot. The natural sciences utilize an abstract Verstand; the cultural sciences use a more holistic way of understanding, a Verstehen.\n\nDespite his shared interest in the conditions of experience, Dilthey is usually not considered a Neo-Kantian. Among several key differences, he rejects the Marburg proclivity to construct laws of thinking and experience that supposedly hold for all rational beings. Their consideration of the self as a set of logico-mathematical rules was an illegitimate abstraction from the really-lived, historically-contextualized human experience. In its place he stresses the ways historicity and social contexts shape the experiences and thinking processes of unique individuals. In distinction from the Baden school, Dilthey rejects Rickert\u2019s theses about both the necessarily phenomenal and universal character of historical experience. Since we have unmediated access to our lived inner life through a sort of \u2018reflexive awareness\u2019, our explanations of historical events may indeed require a degree of generalization and abstraction; however, our sympathetic awareness of agent\u2019s motivations and intentions remains direct. That inner world is not representational or inferential, but \u2013 contrary to the natural sciences \u2013 lived from within our inter-contextualized experience of the world. In this way, Dilthey alsocrossed the mainstay Neo-Kantian position on the role of psychology in the human sciences. It is not a field alongside sociology or economics that requires a transcendental grounding in order to gain a nomothetic status. Psychology is an immediate descriptive science that alone enables the other Geisteswissenschaften to be understood properly as a sort of mediation between the individual and their social milieu. Dilthey thought the results of psychology will, contra Windelband, allow us to move beyond a purely idiographic description of individuals to a law-like (though not strictly nomothetic) typology according to worldviews or \u2018Weltanschauungen\u2019.\n\nMax Weber (1864-1920) was a student and friend of Rickert\u2019s in Freiburg, and was also concerned with distinguishing the logic of historical judgment from that of the natural sciences. The past itself contains no intelligibility. Intelligibility is something added by means of the historian\u2019s act of contextualizing an individual in his or her social environment. Unlike Comte (1798-1857), whatever \u2018laws\u2019 we might discover in history are really just constructions. And unlike Durkheim (1858-1917), talk of \u2018societies\u2019 runs the risk of hypostasizing what is actually a convenient symbol. Social history should instead be about trying to understand the motivations behind individual and particular changes.\n\nThe sociology of Georg Simmel (1858-1918) was also informed by a personal connection to Rickert. From its foundation by Comte and Mill (1806-1873), sociology had been marked by both a positivist theory of explanation-under-law and by an uncritical empiricism. Simmel, with the familiar Neo-Kantian move, undermined their naivety and replaced it with a more careful consideration of how society could be conceived at all. How do individuals relate to society, in what sense does society have a sort of psychology in its own right that generates changes and out of which spiritual shifts emerge, and how do the representational faculties affect societal rituals like money, fashion, and the construction of cities?\n\nTaking history away from its sociological orientation and back to its conceptual roots was Emil Lask (1875-1915). Having dissertated on Fichte under Rickert in 1902 and habilitated on legal theory under Windelband in 1905, Lask was called to Heidelberg in 1910, where his inaugural lecture \u2013\u201cHegel in seinem Verh\u00e4ltnis zur Weltanschauung der Aufkl\u00e4rung\u201d\u2014 intimated a rather different line of influence. His work is comprised of two major published titles: Logik der Philosophie oder die Kategorienlehre (1911) and Lehre vom Urteil (1912). In them, Lask works out an immediate-intuitional theory of knowledge that went beyond the Kantian categories of the understanding of objects into the realm of a logic of values, and even probed the borders of the irrational. In fact he criticized the generalities of the Baden school\u2019s Problemsgeschichte for lacking a concrete grounding in actual historical movements. Although Lask\u2019s insistence to fight on the eastern front in the First World War cut short what should have been a promising career, he had significant influence on German philosophy through Weber, Luk\u00e1cs, and Heidegger. His death, in the same year as Windelband\u2019s, stands as the usual endpoint of the Baden school of Neo-Kantianism.\n\nThe physiognomic leanings of the Neo-Kantian forerunners, like Helmholtz and Lange, were revitalized by a pair of philosophers of considerable scientific reputation. Richard Avenarius (1843-96) and Ernst Mach (1838-1916), founders of empirio-criticism, sought to overcome the idealism-materialism rift in German academic philosophy by closer investigation into the nature of experience. This entailed replacing traditional physics with a phenomenalistic conception of thermodynamics as the model of positivist science. In his Kritik der reinen Erfahrung (1888-90), Avenarius showed that the physiognomic factors of experience vary according to environmental conditions. As the nervous system develops regular patterns within a relatively constant environment, experience itself becomes regularized. That feeling of being accustomed to typical experiences, rather than logical deduction, is what counts as knowledge. Mach was similarly critical of realist assumptions about sensation and experience, positing instead the mind\u2019s inherent ability to economize the welter of experience into abbreviated forms. Although the concepts we use, especially those in the natural sciences, are indispensable for communication and for navigating the world, they cannot demonstrate the substantial objects from which they are believed to be derived.\n\nAlois Riehl (1844-1924) denied Liebmann\u2019s claim that the Kantian thing-in-itself was nothing more than an incidental remnant of enlightenment rationalism. Were it, Riehl argued, Kantianism should give up any pretension to a positive engagement with science. Kant in fact never entirely rejected the possibility of apprehending the thing-in-itself, only the attempt to do so by way of the understanding and reason. It was not inconsistent with Kant to try to articulate noumena mediately, via indirect inferences from their perceptible characteristics in observation. Beyond its spatio-temporal and categorical qualifications, the particular characteristics of an object which we perceive and by which we distinguish it from any other object depend not on us so much, as upon its mode of appearance as it really is outside us.\n\nAlthough Rudolph Otto (1869-1937) taught in Marburg, he had little interest in the logic of mathematics per se. Otto did, however, follow his school\u2019s inclination to understand the objects of study in terms of the transcendental conditions of their experience as fundamental to the proper study, specifically of religion. What Otto discovered thereby was a new kind of experience \u2013the \u2018holy\u2019\u2014 that was irreducible either to the categories of the understanding or to feeling. This had a substantial influence on the religious phenomenology of two other loosely-associated Neo-Kantian thinkers, Ernst Troeltsch (1865-1923) and Paul Tillich (1886-1965).\n\nWith certain Hegelian overtones, Bruno Bauch (1877-1942) was another fringe member of the Baden school with much to say about religion. While he studied with Fischer in Heidelberg, Rickert in Freiburg, and wrote his Habilitationschrift under Vaihinger in Berlin, he was more concerned than most Badeners with logic and mathematics, and in this respect represents a key link between the Neo-Kantians and both Frege, his confidant, and Carnap, his student. But his views about religion and contemporary politics kept Bauch at considerable distance from mainline Neo-Kantians. Due, in fact to his overt anti-Semitism, he was made to resign his editorship at the Kant-Studien. Having argued that Jews were intrinsically foreign to German culture, his embrace of Nazism during the very period of Cassirer\u2019s emigration was an obvious affront, too, to the legacy of Cohen, whatever honors it may have gained him by the state-run academies.\n\nNicolai Hartmann (1882-1950) began his career as a Neo-Kantian under Cohen and Natorp, but soon after developed his own form of realism. While remaining largely beholden to transcendental semantics, Hartmann rejected the basic Neo-Kantian position on the priority of epistemology to ontology. The first condition for thinking about objects is itself the existence of those objects. It was an error of idealism to assume the human mind constitutes the knowability of those objects and equally the error of materialism to assume that those objects are all open to knowability. To Hartmann, some objects were able to be known by way of their appropriate categorization. Others, however, must remain mysterious, closed off to human inquiry at least until philosophy could point the way toward new methods of comprehending them. Philosophy\u2019s task, accordingly, was to discover the discontinuities between the \u2018subjective categories\u2019 of thought and the \u2018objective categories\u2019 of reality, and, where possible, to eventually overcome them.\n\nGiven the predominance of Neo-Kantianism in German academies during the turn of the century, a number of fringe-members deserve at least mention here. None can be considered an orthodox \u2018Marburg\u2019 or \u2018Southwestern\u2019 school Neo-Kantian, but each had certain affinities or at least critical engagements with the general movement. Friedrich Paulsen (1846-1908), Johannes Volkelt (1848-1930), Benno Erdmann (1851-1921), Rudolf Stammler (1856-1938), Karl Vorl\u00e4nder (1860-1928), the Harvard psychologist Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg (1863-1916), Ernst Troeltsch (1865-1923), the plant physiologist Jonas Cohn (1869-1947), Albert G\u00f6rland (1869-1952), Richard H\u00f6nigswald (1875-1947), Artur Buchenau (1879-1946), Eduard Spranger (1882-1963), and the neo-Friesian Leonard Nelson (1882-1927), who, though more critical than not about Neo-Kantian epistemology, shared certain ethical and social Neo-Kantian themes. There was also significant Neo-Kantian influence on French universities in the same years, with representative figures like Charles Renouview (1815-1903), Jules Lachelier (1832-1918), \u00c9mile Boutroux (1845-1921), Octave Hamelin (1856-1907), and L\u00e9on Brunschvicg (1869-1944). (For a more detailed look at French Neo-Kantians, see Luft and Capeill\u00e8res 2010, pp. 70-80.)\n\n5. Legacy\n\nFrom March 17 to April 6, 1929, the city of Davos, Switzerland hosted an International University Course intended to bring together the continent\u2019s best philosophers. The keynote lecturers and subsequent leaders of the famous disputation were the author of the recent Being and Time, Martin Heidegger, and the author of the recent Philosophy of Symbolic Forms, Ernst Cassirer. Heidegger\u2019s contribution was his interpretation of Kant as chiefly concerned with trying to ground metaphysical speculation in what he calls the transcendental imagination through temporally-finite human reason. Cassirer countered by revealing Heidegger\u2019s formulation of that imagination as unwarrantedly accepting of the non-rational. Agreeing that the progress of Kantian philosophy must acknowledge the finitude of human life, as Heidegger held, Cassirer emphasized that beyond this it must retain the spirit of critical inquiry, the openness to natural science, and the clarity of rational argumentation that marked Kant himself as a great philosopher and not only as an intuitive visionary. The Analytic philosopher Rudolf Carnap (1891-1970) was a participant in the Davos congress, and was thereafter prompted to write a highly critical review of Heidegger. What should have been an event that revitalized Neo-Kantianism in contemporary thought became instead the symbol both for the rise of the Analytic school of philosophy and for its cleavage from Continental thought. Increasingly, Cassirer was viewed as defending an unfashionable way of philosophizing, and after he emigrated from Germany in the wake of increasing anti-Jewish sentiment in 1933 the influence of Neo-Kantianism waned.\n\nEven while serious Kant scholarship thrives in the Anglophone world of the early 21st century, Neo-Kantianism remains perhaps the single worst-neglected region of the historical study of ideas. This is unfortunate for Kant studies, since it inculcates an attitude of offhandedness toward nearly a century of superb scholarship on Kant, from Fischer to Cohen to Vaihinger to Cassirer. The Neo-Kantians were also the single most dominant group in German philosophy departments for half a century. Few works of Cohen, Natorp, Rickert, or Windelband have been translated in their entirety, to say nothing of the less prominent figures. Cassirer and Dilthey have attracted the interest of solid scholars, though it tends to be historical and hermeneutical rather than programmatic. Study of Simmel and Weber has been consistently strong, but more for their sociological conclusions than their philosophical starting points. To the rest, it has become customary to attribute a secondary philosophy rank behind the Idealists, Marxists, and Positivists \u2013and even a tertiary one behind the Romantics, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Kierkegaard, none of whom, it may be reminded, held a professorship in the field. It is not uncommon even in lengthy histories of 19th Century philosophy to find their names omitted entirely.\n\nThe reasons for this neglect are complex and not entirely clear. The writing of the Marburg school is dense and academically forbidding, true, but that of Windelband, Cassirer, Vaihinger, and Simmel are quite eloquent. The personalities of Cohen and Rickert were eccentric to the point of unattractive, though Natorp and Cassirer were congenial. Their ad hominem criticisms of rival members seem crass, but such gossip is undeniably salacious as well. Some of their writing was intentionally set against the backdrop of obscure political developments, though often with other figures such obscurities give rise to cottage-industries of historical scholarship (see Willey, 1978). The two World Wars no doubt had a severely negative impact on the continuity of any movement or school, though phenomenology has fared far better. The fact that many of the Neo-Kantians were both social-liberals and Jewish virtually guaranteed their works would be repressed in Hitler\u2019s Germany. Forced resignation and even exile was a reality for many Jewish academics; Cassirer even had his habilitation at Stra\u00dfburg rejected explicitly on the grounds that he was Jewish. He and Brunschvicg both escaped likely persecution by giving up their homeland. But as the examples of Bauch and Fischer make clear, Neo-Kantianism need not be subsumed under a specifically Jewish or even minimally Semitically-tolerant worldview. And as Cohen\u2019s resurgent legacy in Jewish scholarship proves, not all aspects that were once repressed need forever be.\n\nTo ignore the Neo-Kantians, however, creates the false impression of a philosophical black hole in the German academies between the decline of Hegelianism and the rise of phenomenology, a space more often devoted to anti-academic philosophers like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche. Moreover, the Neo-Kantian influence on 20th century minds from Husserl and Heidegger to Frege and Carnap is pronounced, and should not be brushed aside lightly. In terms of early 21st century philosophy, Neo-Kantianism reminds us of the importance of reflecting on method and of philosophizing in conjunction with the best contemporary research in the natural sciences, something for which Helmholtz, Lange, and Cassirer stand as exemplars. And just as Liebmann\u2019s motto \u2018Back to Kant\u2019 was exhorted to bridge the gap between idealism and materialism in the 19th century, so too may it be a sort of third way that rectifies the split between contemporary continental and analytic partisanship. If the old saying still carries water, then \u201cone can philosophize with Kant, or against Kant; but one cannot philosophize without Kant.\u201d\n\nFortunately there are signs of renewed interest. In 2010, Luft and Rudolf Makkreel edited Neo-Kantianism in Contemporary Philosophy (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press), which presents a well-rounded contemporary collection of research papers. In Continental Europe, no one has done more to revitalize Neo-Kantian studies than Helmut Holzhey and Fabien Capeill\u00e8res, who have each published a row of books, editions, and papers on the theme. Under the directorship of Christian Krijnen and Kurt Walter Zeidler, the Desiderata der Neukantianismus-Forschung has hosted a number of congresses and meetings throughout Europe. A 2008 issue of the Philosophical Forum was dedicated to Neo-Kantianism generally, and featured articles by Rolf-Peter Horstmann, Paul Guyer, Michael Friedman, and Frederick Beiser among others. Studies of particular Neo-Kantians have been produced by Poma (1997), Krijnen (2001), Zijderveld (2006), Skildelsky (2008), and Munk (2010). And Charles Bambach (1995), Michael Friedmann (2000), Tom Rockmore (2000), and Peter Eli Gordon (2012) have composed fine works of intellectual history concerning the heritage of Neo-Kantianism in the twentieth century.\n\n6.

After giving an overview of the common features of Neo-Kantians, section 2 is devoted to the Marburg School, and section 3 to the Southwest (SW) School. The Neo-Kantians were systematic and comprehensive philosophers, writing on nearly every area of philosophy. Instead of attempting to cover all areas of their thought, this article will focus on the areas of their philosophies that were most central to their thought, and that were most influential on their contemporaries and successors. Accordingly, each section begins with each school\u2019s conception of philosophy (sections 2.1 and 3.1), moves on to their theory of knowledge (2.2 and 3.2), and ends with the philosophy of the special sciences most characteristic of each school (2.3 on Marburg philosophy of physics, and 3.3 on SW philosophy of history). (Three supplementary documents cover philosophies of logic, psychology, and mathematics in the Marburg School.)\n\nNeo-Kantians [ 2 ] were not only intellectually influential, they were also great successes academically in Germany. They held prominent academic chairs, and were successful in placing their students, shaping curricula, and editing important journals and books. Most of the German philosophers who came to prominence in Germany after the First World War were educated by Neo-Kantians\u2014an impressive and comprehensive list of students that includes Rudolf Carnap, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Martin Heidegger, and Hans Reichenbach. [ 3 ] But the reputation of Neo-Kantianism shifted dramatically in the decades after 1918. Neo-Kantians were associated with the old order, and so became the primary targets of the many philosophers (including their own students) wanting to make a completely fresh start. The subsequent geopolitical upheavals, not the least of which was Hitler\u2019s rise to power in 1933, nearly erased the institutional memory of Neo-Kantianism within the emerging analytic and continental traditions. However, in the last few decades, historians of philosophy of all stripes have begun to re-discover both the historical and philosophical significance of Neo-Kantianism.\n\nNeo-Kantianism was the dominant philosophical movement in Germany from roughly 1870 until the First World War. This movement drew inspiration from a diverse cast of philosophers\u2014principally, Kuno Fischer (Fischer 1860), Hermann von Helmholtz (Helmholtz 1867, 1878), Friedrich Lange (Lange 1866), Otto Liebmann (Liebmann 1865), and Eduard Zeller (Zeller 1862))\u2014who in the middle of the nineteenth century were calling for a return to Kant\u2019s philosophy as an alternative to both speculative metaphysics and materialism (Beiser 2014b). During the 1870s, the movement formed into two schools, one based around Hermann Cohen at Marburg University and another based in southwest Germany (in the province of Baden) around Wilhelm Windelband. Later members of the Marburg School include Paul Natorp and Ernst Cassirer; later members of the Southwest School include Heinrich Rickert and Emil Lask. [ 1 ]\n\n1. Common Features of Neo-Kantians\n\nThe Neo-Kantians did not always think of themselves as members of a common movement. Though the members of the Marburg school very clearly identified with one another, and the members of the Southwest school identified themselves with one another, the two schools initially[4] made little effort to present themselves as part of a common movement. Their doctrines were different in some fundamental ways, and they often criticized one another\u2019s positions. Nevertheless, there were some common features of Neo-Kantians of both schools\u2014common features that made it natural for their contemporaries and for historians today to talk about them together. This section presents seven common features of the Neo-Kantians. These seven common features make it possible to distinguish, in a principled philosophical way, between the (\u201cclassical\u201d) Neo-Kantians of the Marburg and Southwest schools and the various \u201cback to Kant\u201d philosophers of the mid nineteenth century and the assorted philosophers contemporary with the Neo-Kantians who were \u201cneo-Kantian\u201d in some broader sense. For example, Helmholtz and Lange did not share the Neo-Kantians\u2019 anti-psychologism or commitment to the transcendental method (features 2 and 3 below), while Alois Riehl did not share their idealistic theory of objective validity (feature 6).\n\n1. Most obviously, the Neo-Kantians thought of themselves as reviving, defending, and extending Kant\u2019s philosophy. They self-consciously adopted Kant\u2019s vocabulary, and some of his key ideas and arguments. They wrote commentaries on Kant\u2019s major writings, and would often present their own positive views in the form of commentaries or interpretations of Kant. Nevertheless, they never considered themselves to be orthodox Kantians, nor did they see the value in defending Kant\u2019s views on all topics. As Windelband famously said in the preface to the 1883 first edition of Windelband 1915,[5] \u201cto understand Kant means to go beyond him\u201d. And, as Natorp explained,\n\nit was never anyone\u2019s wish nor intent to cling to Kant\u2019s doctrines in an absolute way. Talk of an orthodox Kantianism within the Marburg School was never justified. (Natorp 1912a: 180)\n\nIn fact, there were some core Kantian ideas that the Neo-Kantians self-consciously rejected. They rejected the doctrine of the thing-in-itself as incoherent and unnecessary (Windelband 1910: 323), or radically reinterpreted talk of things-in-themselves as talk of a postulated final and complete theory of the world (Cohen 1885: 503ff.). Their rejection of Kant\u2019s dualism of appearances and things-in-themselves was closely related to their rethinking of Kant\u2019s distinction between two \u201cstems\u201d of cognition: sensibility and understanding. The Marburg philosophers came to fundamentally reject this distinction, while the Southwest Neo-Kantians (while maintaining the irreducibility of intuitions to concepts) still rejected the idea that intuitions are the result of a mind-independent thing-in-itself affecting sensibility. Though the Neo-Kantians took as fundamental to their philosophies the existence of substantive a priori concepts and principles that make knowledge possible, they did not accept that the categories and principles identified in the Critique of Pure Reason were complete or fixed for all time. In particular, Marburg Neo-Kantians believed that some of the categories and principles that Kant identified were relative to the scientific theories of Kant\u2019s day, and that the categories and principles could change as scientists develop new empirical theories. Southwest Neo-Kantians, on the other hand, were keen to argue that history is just as much a science as mathematical physics, and they thought that Kant\u2019s critical project had to be extended in order to identify the a priori elements in history. Last, the classical Neo-Kantians held that transcendental philosophy is distinct and independent of empirical psychology, even though (they argued) Kant himself was not always innocent of psychologism, despite the fact that Kant\u2019s philosophy when rightly interpreted is the basis for a sound anti-psychologism (Cohen 1883: \u00a78).\n\n2. The Neo-Kantians put forward a suite of arguments to show that philosophy is independent of psychology. Logic, or the theory of knowledge, concerns what is objective, not what is subjective, as psychology does (Cohen 1883: \u00a76). It does not concern itself with the mental processes of subjects, with their cognitive apparatus, or with empirical results about human sense organs or nervous system. As Windelband 1883 put it, psychologistic philosophers employ the \u201cgenetic method\u201d trying to find the justification of some part of our knowledge by tracing empirically its causal antecedents. The correct method, however, is the \u201ccritical method\u201d, which distinguishes what he calls \u201cfactual\u201d from \u201cteleological\u201d or normative validity. The critical method is the only correct method, because the fact that we do believe something, or even that all humans by some biological necessity have to believe it, does not yet solve the critical question: what we ought to believe.[6] For these reasons, the Neo-Kantians sharply distinguished a priority from innateness\u2014a distinction they claimed was obscured by philosophers such as Helmholtz and Lange.\n\nA return to an anti-psychologistic Kant was the Neo-Kantians\u2019 solution to what the historian Herbert Schn\u00e4delbach (1984: 5) called the \u201cidentity crisis\u201d that faced philosophy in the middle of the nineteenth century. Given the collapse of the conception of philosophy shared by post-Kantian speculative idealists, and the concurrent spectacular advances made in the sciences, philosophers were left questioning what (if anything) was left as the distinctive subject matter and method of philosophy (Beiser 2014a: Ch.1). In particular, in opposing psychologism, the Neo-Kantians were staking out a conception of philosophy that avoids the naturalism defended by many German philosophers in the decades after Hegel\u2019s death (Cassirer 1912). According to naturalistic conceptions of philosophy, the method of philosophy is in fact not distinguishable from that of natural science, and the theory of knowledge just becomes applied empirical psychology. Nevertheless, the Neo-Kantians shared with these naturalistic philosophers a deep distrust of speculative metaphysics: they denied that philosophy could deliver knowledge of the supersensible, could deduce facts of the special sciences from a priori principles knowable in some special philosophical way, or that philosophy could even be done in ignorance of the results of the sciences.\n\n3. This via media, this third way of doing philosophy, they found in the transcendental method. The two schools conceived of the transcendental method differently. For Cohen and his school, philosophy begins with a fact\u2014paradigmatically, the fact of science\u2014and investigates the conditions that make that fact possible. For Windelband and his school, the transcendental question is understood teleologically: given certain fundamental goals, such as knowing the truth, or doing good, or experiencing what is beautiful, what is necessary for achieving these values? Still, though, there was a common core to both schools\u2019 conceptions of the transcendental method: they wanted to identify those objective elements within some part of human culture (say, physics, history, or ethics) that made possible objective validity (say, the objective validity of physical theories, historical narratives, or ethical claims). Adherence to the transcendental method led the Neo-Kantians to reject skepticism. Philosophical reflection begins with the fact that scientists have developed successful theories of the physical world; or with the universal validity of the value of truth. So no room is left for the skeptical worry that scientific theories do not in fact deliver empirical knowledge, or that truth is in fact unattainable (Windelband 1883: 280).\n\n4. The object of the transcendental method, for the Neo-Kantians, is culture. Often, they approached human culture using Kant\u2019s three-fold distinction between knowledge, ethics, aesthetics. Because they saw the achievements of science as one of the most significant aspects of modern culture, a good portion of their writings concern the philosophy of science. As Kant applied the transcendental method to Newtonian science, they sought to apply the method to the best science of their day. Typically (not exclusively), the Marburg philosophers were concerned with the physics and mathematics of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, which (they emphasized) differed fundamentally from that of Kant\u2019s own day. The Southwest Neo-Kantians, on the other hand, were more concerned with the so-called \u201cGeisteswissenschaften\u201d (the \u201chuman sciences\u201d), which had come into their own in the nineteenth century and now deserved (they argued) to be recognized as autonomous and fully scientific (despite the fact that Kant himself had sharply distinguished history from science (Kant 1786: Ak 4:468)).\n\n5. Neo-Kantian philosophy of science is distinctive in its focus on the methodology of science. Thus, Neo-Kantian philosophy of physics is not so much concerned directly with what matter is, but with how mathematical physics comes to know about matter. Neo-Kantian philosophy of history is not concerned with grand theories concerning what drives history, but with what makes the methodology of a historian different from that of a physicist or empirical psychologist. Philosophy of science, for them, is the logic of the sciences\u2014in the extended sense of \u201clogic\u201d that includes theory of knowledge and scientific methodology. And, true to their anti-psychologistic conception of logic, Neo-Kantian accounts of scientific methodology are not intended to be empirical descriptions of what scientists do, but accounts that identify objective norms, or the fundamental principles and concepts of a particular science.[7] Philosophy of science thus becomes a second order discipline, different in kind from the natural sciences (thus avoiding naturalism). But because Neo-Kantian philosophy of science adheres to the transcendental method, it avoids the errors of speculative metaphysics. It does not, for instance, try to derive the concept of matter or life a priori, but is content to demonstrate that these concepts are necessary conditions for physics and biology. Since philosophy of science for the Neo-Kantians is a second order discipline, they were in general committed to a non-revisionist attitude. According to Rickert, philosophy\n\ndoes not claim to direct science onto the paths it should take. On the contrary, it proposes only to follow science with a view to understanding it. (1902: 340)\n\nFor Cassirer, \u201ccritical philosophy \u2026 does not seek to direct the sciences but to understand them\u201d (1907b: 31).\n\n6. Since the goal of transcendental philosophy, for the Neo-Kantians, is to identify those elements within some part of human culture that are necessary for its objective validity, they were also led to investigate the nature of objective validity itself (Natorp 1887, Rickert 1915).[8] The two schools construed the question of objective validity differently. The Marburg philosophers emphasized objectivity, and gave an account of objectivity in terms of constant laws (see section 2.2). The Southwest Neo-Kantians emphasized the question of validity\u2014specifically the validity of values (section 3.2). For both schools, a central issue in the investigation of objective validity is the question of transcendence: what does it mean that the object is independent of our knowledge and provides the standard for its truth?\n\nThere are four key ideas that are common to the Southwest and Marburg theories of objective validity. First, both schools emphasized the centrality of judgments (as opposed to concepts or intuitions), as the kind of representation that first makes objective validity possible (Rickert 1915: Ch.3; Cohen 1902: \u00a710\u201311). Second, the Neo-Kantians were emphatic that the objective validity of knowledge does not consist in its being a copy (Abbild) or mirror of the object (Windelband 1910; Rickert 1934; Cassirer 1910: Ch.1; Rickert 1915: Ch.2). This \u201ccopy theory\u201d of knowledge is inconsistent with a third key idea, that the objective validity of every area of culture is made possible by substantive a priori principles. The a priori principles that make possible some part of human culture are again not interpreted psychologistically: they are not features of the minds of individual subjects, they are not discovered empirically, and their necessity is not grounded in the empirical fact that they are universally accepted. These a priori principles are parts of culture\u2014they are its fundamental norms or laws. Fourth, the Neo-Kantians described themselves as \u201cidealists\u201d. Idealism meant different things to different Neo-Kantians (see section 2.2 and 3.2). But all Neo-Kantians shared the view that knowledge requires a priori elements that are not present in what is given in immediate intuition. Knowledge, then, requires a \u201creshaping\u201d or \u201ctransformation\u201d of what is given. The copy theory that they reject would in this sense be a kind of \u201crealism\u201d. Of course, Neo-Kantian idealism must be rigorously distinguished from other kinds of idealisms. As noted earlier, they reject Kant\u2019s doctrine of the thing-in-itself, and they emphatically do not believe that objects are in any way subjective or dependent on the representations of individual psychological subjects.\n\n7. There is one final common feature of Neo-Kantian philosophers that should not be overlooked: the Neo-Kantians were great historians of philosophy. It\u2019s not surprising that the Neo-Kantians wrote extensively on Kant, producing commentaries (e.g., Cohen 1885; Cassirer 1918) and critical editions of his writing. But the Neo-Kantians also wrote extensively on other philosophers, ancient and modern, and on the history of science and mathematics (e.g., Windelband 1891; Cassirer 1906, 1907a). These historical works were not thought of as side projects, but as essential aspects of their philosophy. Neo-Kantians did not sharply distinguish history of philosophy from philosophy (see Introduction to Windelband 1891; \u00a7I of the 1902 version of Cohen 1898).\n\n2. The Marburg School\n\nThe intellectual beginnings of the Marburg School can be traced to 1871, when Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918) published the first edition of his Kants Theorie der Erfahrung (Kant\u2019s Theory of Experience), which interpreted Kant in an anti-psychologistic way and found in Kant\u2019s first Critique the expression of a novel way of doing philosophy: the transcendental method. In 1873 Cohen did his Habilitation in Marburg under Friedrich Lange, who had moved there in 1872. He was promoted as Professor Extraordinarius in 1875, and then took over Lange\u2019s chair in 1876 after his death. When Paul Natorp (1854\u20131924) moved to Marburg in 1880 (writing his Habilitation\u2014Natorp 1881\u2014under Cohen and being promoted to Professor in 1893), the \u201cMarburg\u201d school as an institutional force was born.\n\nCohen\u2019s work culminated in a three part system of philosophy, modeled after Kant\u2019s own tripartite division of critical philosophy: The Logic of Pure Knowledge (Cohen 1902), The Ethics of Pure Will (Cohen 1904), and the Aesthetics of Pure Feeling (Cohen 1912). His most influential works, though, were his interpretation of Kant, principally in Kant\u2019s Theory of Experience, which was significantly revised and expanded in a second edition (Cohen 1885), and his works in the philosophy of science and mathematics: The Principle of the Infinitesimal Method (Cohen 1883), and his introduction to the sixth edition of Lange\u2019s History of Materialism (Cohen 1898).[9]\n\nNatorp\u2019s most influential writings are in the interpretation of Plato, the philosophy of science, and in the philosophy of psychology. Starting with his habilitation (\u201cDescartes\u2019s Theory of Knowledge: A Study in the Pre-history of Criticism\u201d) in 1881, Natorp extended the reach of the Marburg school as historians of philosophy beyond Kant to other philosophers who in various ways anticipated the Kantian themes important to the Marburgers. Natorp\u2019s most significant work in this vein was his book Plato\u2019s Theory of Ideas (1903), which gave a serious scholarly argument for the dating of Plato\u2019s dialogues, in addition to a novel \u201ccritical\u201d reading of Platonic ideas. In the philosophy of science, his systematic work The Logical Foundations of the Exact Sciences (1910) gives a systematic philosophy of logic, arithmetic, geometry, and physics that engages with contemporary science and mathematics in a more comprehensive and detailed way than any of Cohen\u2019s works. Last, in a series of works in the philosophy of psychology (culminating in General Psychology According to the Critical Method (1912b)), Natorp defended a novel conception of psychology as the science of the subjective.\n\nAmong the many students of Cohen and Natorp\u2019s who identified themselves with the Marburg school, the most accomplished and influential was undoubtedly Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945). After writing his dissertation under Cohen in 1899 on Descartes\u2019s philosophy of mathematics and science, Cassirer moved to Berlin, where he worked as a Privatdozent (though not a Professor, which was ruled out by institutional anti-Semitism[10]). His most important works before 1914 are in the history of philosophy (especially the massive, two volume Problem of Knowledge (Cassirer 1906, 1907a), which follows the development of the philosophy of science from the late Renaissance to Kant), and the philosophy of the exact sciences (Substance and Function, 1910; Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity, 1921). Starting in 1921, Cassirer\u2019s philosophy broadened into a \u201cphilosophy of symbolic forms\u201d, which differs in some fundamental ways from the classic works of his teachers.\n\n2.1 Conception of Philosophy: The Transcendental Method\n\nThe core commitment of the Marburg school was to a philosophical method: \u201cthe transcendental method\u201d (Natorp 1912a; Cohen 1883: \u00a77\u20139; Cohen 1885: \u00a712; Richardson 2006). The method, as Natorp describes it, comes in two steps. In the first step, the philosopher identifies some \u201cfact\u201d of culture. Theoretical philosophy begins with the \u201cfact of science\u201d; practical philosophy with the fact of \u201csocial order\u201d; aesthetics with the fact of \u201cartistic creation\u201d. These facts are concrete, detailed, and \u201chistorically verifiable\u201d. For instance, a theoretical philosopher begins by investigating the best scientific theories of her contemporaries. In this first step, the philosopher is like a fact collector, investigating the methods, important concepts and laws of that aspect of culture, including the historical development of that area of culture up to the present day. In the second step, however, the philosopher goes beyond fact-collecting to identifying those aspects of that area of culture that make its objective validity possible. As they put it, this involves identifying the \u201claws\u201d or \u201cform\u201d of that area of culture. Their model here is Kant in the Prolegomena. As they read Kant, he began by identifying within the best scientific theory of his time\u2014Newton\u2019s\u2014the fundamental laws, concepts, and methods (which are contained in Kant\u2019s Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science). The second step is showing how these laws, concepts, and methods are made possible by even more fundamental concepts and laws, which are contained in the Critique itself\u2014laws which make objective validity possible.\n\nThere are a few aspects of this method that need to be emphasized. First, the second step in the method involves much more than just identifying a class of basic laws and concepts. If a philosopher were to axiomatize a physical theory, even a fundamental one, for the Marburgers that would be only the first step. A philosopher also needs a story of how just these laws and just these concepts make it possible for the theory to make true claims about objects\u2014a story that will require a very general account of objective validity itself. Second, the transcendental method requires demonstrating the unity of culture. A philosophy of arithmetic should show how the laws of arithmetic fit in with the laws of geometry and analysis to form the unity of mathematics; how the laws of mathematics are preconditions of all natural science to form the unity of science; and all the way up to the unity of culture. Third, these two steps are interrelated. The notion of objective validity itself is analyzed in step two on the basis of reflection on the details of concrete culture from step one; the philosopher in step one collects the relevant facts about an area of culture because she has in mind the step two goal of explaining its objective validity, in a unified account of the validity of all culture. Fourth, the method is non-skeptical, non-revisionary, and unconcerned with certainty. Since it takes an area of culture as a fact, it rules out radical skepticism about the validity of an area of culture, and it has no room to advocate a radical revision in that area of culture. Though the goal of the transcendental method is to provide foundations for culture, these foundations are not meant to be certain. Transcendental logic, one might say, is a semantic, not a Cartesian project. Fifth, though the transcendental method is rooted in the concrete facts of contemporary culture, it is nevertheless possible and even necessary for a philosopher to take sides on contested questions within culture. A philosopher is not a bystander in culture. So, for instance, Cohen argues for infinitesimal over limit methods in the calculus, for Herz\u2019s mechanics over its rivals, for liberal democracy over monarchy. After all, the transcendental philosopher, having studied the method of an area of culture and its long historical development, can show that one party in a dispute has departed in some fundamental way from that method. And the philosopher also has her eye on the question of the foundations of the objective validity of an area of culture (and its integration into a synthetic account of the objective validity of all culture), and so can intervene to show that one approach in a controversy is better suited to make objective validity possible.\n\nSince the transcendental method begins with the fact of culture, Marburg Neo-Kantians reject the possibility of speculative metaphysics. Transcendental philosophy as they understand it is also distinct from and independent of psychology. Though the goal of the theory of knowledge is to understand what makes \u201cexperience\u201d possible, they understand experience in a radically non-psychological way. As Cohen puts in (1898: x, my translation):\n\nThe transcendental method does not research the principles of human reason but rather the foundation of science that conditions scientific validity. Our organization is, insofar as it comes into question in general, a question of psychology; and there is at least no methodological means for procuring secure, scientific, and exact information from the ultimate and simplest parts of our mental essence. But the sciences lie before us in books. What makes them into sciences, wherein their character of generality and necessity rests, from which concepts their epistemological validity within their region can be derived, what tools and ways of knowing explain in its validity those historical facts of knowledge\u2014the sciences\u2014this is a methodological question, this is the question, which the sciences themselves pose, whenever they feel the impulse to think about their own principles\u2014this and nothing else is the transcendental question.\n\nThe fact of science does not occur in the minds of individual scientists; it lies before us in books. \u201cExperience\u201d is not a representation in the mind of a knower; it is the objective content. \u201cExperience\u201d is virtually equated with mathematical natural science, and a paradigm \u201cexperience\u201d is Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation. What makes experience (in this non-psychological sense) possible is \u201ca priori\u201d, now interpreted in a radically non-psychological sense as elements of the content of some aspect of culture that makes the objective validity of that culture possible. This new conception of the a priori, radically distinct from innateness and independent of any facts about human minds discoverable by empirical psychology, is articulated in Cohen\u2019s Kant\u2019s Theory of Experience. It is here that Cohen\u2019s Neo-Kantianism breaks decisively with the Kantianism of Lange and Helmholtz. In his book, Cohen distinguishes between the \u201cmetaphysical a priori\u201d and the \u201ctranscendental a priori\u201d (1885: 109; cf. 1902: 44). The metaphysical a priori are the basic structures of our thinking that we can discover by introspection or empirical study; these are irrelevant to the transcendental philosopher (unless she is doing philosophy of psychology). The transcendental a priori, on the other hand, are those aspects of the content of science that make objective validity possible. Thus, the relationship between the a priori and experience is not like the relationship between a mental apparatus and its acts. It is a logical relationship, more like the relation between an axiom and a theorem (Cassirer 1918: 151, 153)\u2014though with the important qualification that the a priori laws are not just axioms, but axioms that have the special semantic function of making objective validity possible.\n\nThe fact of culture is not static, but dynamic. As Natorp memorably put it (1912a: 184; 1910: Ch.1, \u00a74; 1903: 366ff), the fact is not a \u201cfactum\u201d (a thing done) but \u201cfieri\u201d (becoming). Culture changes; one scientific theory replaces another. In keeping with the transcendental method, only a Newtonian could have written what Kant wrote; but the transcendental method just as emphatically requires that later transcendental philosophers rethink the doctrines of the first Critique in light of the advances in mathematics and natural science since Newton. This appreciation for the historically evolving character of culture has two consequences. First, the transcendental a priori is not absolute, but relative to the current best physical theories. Second, Marburg Neo-Kantians have an additional transcendental task that Kant himself did not fully recognize: to understand how it is possible that the changes in an area of culture can themselves be objectively valid. They want to understand the objective law or method that determines how an area of culture changes.[11] This emphasis on the objectivity and lawlikeness of cultural change thus introduces a check on the potential relativistic or historicist consequences of their relativizing the a priori. (Cassirer in particular develops a sophisticated theory of the a priori with both relative and absolute elements; see section 2.3.) This emphasis on the progressive character of culture leads the Marburg Neo-Kantians to adopt a distinctive, historical method of writing and arguing, in which systematic philosophy is not separated from the history of philosophy and the history of culture.[12]\n\n2.2 Theory of Knowledge\n\nThe core of the Marburg Neo-Kantian theory of knowledge is a conception of \u201cobjective validity\u201d (Natorp 1887; Cohen 1902: \u00a711). By the \u201cobjective validity\u201d of knowledge, they mean its objectivity (that is, its independence from individual subjects), its truth, and its relation to objects. A theory of objective validity is then also a theory of the \u201ctranscendence\u201d of the object\u2014in what sense the object is an independent standard of correctness for knowledge. A good way to approach the Marburg theory is by considering an alternative they reject. Consider the view that \u201cobjects in themselves are there, outside and independent of all subjectivity, without any original relation to it\u201d. That is, begin your theory of objective validity with the notion of an independent object, taken as a theoretical given. This notion of an object is then used to explain aboutness, truth, and objectivity. A representation is about an object, say, if it is caused by an object or, perhaps, it resembles it. A representation is true if it then mirrors or copies the object as it is independently of us. And then knowledge is objective if it is about an independent object, not about the subject and its states. For Marburg Neo-Kantians, this theory of objective validity (which they call \u201cnaive realism\u201d) simply presupposes the very thing it is supposed to explain:\n\nPerhaps this actually means something correct, but at least as it is presented, it is not really an answer to the question [What is objective validity?]. The being-in-itself of the object is itself an enigma and thus cannot serve as a solution to our present enigma. If we understood what it meant to say the object in itself is there independent of all subjectivity and then is appropriated in our subjectivity by knowledge there would be no problem in the knowing of objects or in the objectivity of knowledge. (Natorp 1887: \u00a74)\n\nThe Marburg theory of objective validity, on the other hand, turns this order of explanation on its head: instead of beginning with the notion of an object as its explanatory primitive, it sees the notion of an object as dependent on many other prior notions. In particular, it begins its account of objective validity with a distinctive account of objectivity.\n\nObjectivity, according to the Marburg view, depends on laws. For example, a particular physical thing (say a table in a room) appears in a certain way from my own subjective point of view in the room. To achieve an objective representation of the table, I would need to understand how all of the various appearances at various points of view in the room are related to one another in a law-like way. When I know the law, I\u2019ve moved from appearance to reality, from subjectivity to objectivity. If there is no such law, then there is only appearance, and I cannot speak about an independent object and its properties. This simple point generalizes at higher levels. It merely appears from our subjective point of view that the earth is stationary and the sun moves. But it is objectively the case that the earth moves around the sun because the heliocentric model follows from Newton\u2019s laws of motion. Even more fundamentally, scientific theories (such as Newton\u2019s) are developed, adopted, and abandoned as science progresses; this whole progression is itself objective because there are \u201claws\u201d (that is, a common scientific method) that prescribe these changes. These laws secure the \u201cunity\u201d of knowledge: the various appearances of the same particular are united as of the same particular object by a law; a law of nature unites various observed phenomena under it; the scientific method unites science in its development, prescribing a uniquely correct path to follow. This unity can also be described as \u201cpermanence\u201d: the appearances change, even as the object stays the same; the planets move, but the law remains; theories come and go, but the method stays constant. This notion of objectivity as lawfulness is then used to give an account of truth and objecthood. Knowledge is true if it can be unified with other knowledge within an objective system of knowledge. Last, an object is then what is known by fully objective knowledge:\n\nthe object signifies the law; it signifies the lasting unity in which the changing manifold of appearance is unified and determined in thought. (Natorp 1887: \u00a74)\n\nThis theory of objective validity has some notable consequences. First, the possibility of objective validity requires that we postulate, as a regulative ideal, a final science. The unity of knowledge through laws that the Marburgers point to as the foundation of objective validity has clearly not yet been achieved: there are still phenomena that have not yet been explained, and our current theories are certainly not going to be the final word. But it is clearly the case that even now we can know objects, even if our knowledge is partial. If unity through laws makes objectivity validity possible and that unity has not yet been achieved, how then can we know any objects at all? We have to postulate that our current, only partially unified knowledge can progress in a law-like way into a unique, final theory. Such a final theory can never actually be achieved, because the task of knowledge is infinite\u2014there is always more to understand, deeper explanations to give. The postulated final theory is like the asymptote that a curve never quite reaches. This viewpoint\u2014that speaking of an object contains the demand for unity of knowledge, that this task is infinite, that we must therefore postulate the possibility of its completion\u2014Natorp calls the \u201cgenetic view of knowledge\u201d (1910: Ch.1, \u00a74\u20135). The genetic view delivers a unique way of cashing out the \u201ctranscendence\u201d of the object. The fact that the object is independent of knowledge, in the sense that it always transcends our knowledge of it, is expressed by the infinity of the task of knowledge. And the fact that the object is the standard for knowledge is expressed by the postulate that the course of knowledge is moving asymptotically towards a unique (though infinite) endpoint as its goal. Second, the emphasis on lawfulness gives the Marburgers a satisfying explanation of the application of mathematics to the objects of natural science: the laws of natural science are mathematical, and there would be no objects if there were no laws of natural science. Third, since objectivity is explained in terms of laws, and laws are a special kind of universal judgment, the Marburg theory of objective validity emphasizes the priority of judgments over concepts (Cohen 1902: \u00a710). As Cohen memorably put it, modifying Galileo\u2019s phrase: the book of nature is written in sentences (with mathematics as its letters, and the a priori principles of pure knowledge as its syntax) (1902: 204, 484).\n\nIn addition to their theory of objective validity, another core commitment in the mature writings of the Marburg school is a rejection of the \u201cgiven\u201d. In this, they are explicitly departing from Kant. Kant had argued that our cognitive faculty has two stems: a receptive faculty (sensibility), and a spontaneous faculty (understanding). Through sensibility, objects are given to us, and through the understanding, objects are thought. The representations of sensibility are intuitions, which relate to objects immediately; the representations of the understanding are concepts, which relate to objects mediately. The Marburgers\u2019 skepticism of these distinctions culminated in Cohen\u2019s Logic of Pure Knowledge (1902: \u00a77), where these dualisms are definitively rejected. As Natorp put the point:\n\nIn the end, \u201cintuition\u201d no longer remains a cognitive factor which stands across from or is opposed to thinking. It is thinking, just not thinking in terms of laws, but thinking in terms of full objects. In its implementation, in its exercise, intuition is to conceptual thought as function is to the law of function. (1912a: 186)\n\nIntuition is itself a \u201cfunction\u201d, because even intuitions are active or spontaneous, and not merely given. Similarly, they were often uncomfortable with Kant\u2019s word \u201csynthesis\u201d because it suggests that the function of thinking is only to combine a content that is already given. Instead, Cohen prefers the term \u201cgenerate\u201d in order to indicate the \u201ccreative sovereignty of thinking\u201d (1902: 25). In another favorite slogan, an object is not given [geben] to knowledge, but given as a task [aufgegeben], echoing the genetic view of knowledge described in the previous paragraph (Natorp 1912a: 183\u20134; Natorp 1910: Ch.1, \u00a75). In Substance and Function (1910: Ch.1), Cassirer attacks the given by attacking a related doctrine: the traditional view that all concepts are formed by abstraction. On this view of concept formation, concepts would have to be abstracted from given material that is completely independent of thought and its concepts\u2014thus presupposing the doctrine of the given.\n\nIt is hard to interpret the Marburg rejection of the given. It seems to deny the obvious fact that there is some passive element in perception, and to leave no room for experiment within natural science (as Natorp recognized: 1912a: 186). In interpreting the doctrine, it is helpful to remember that the Marburg theory of knowledge concerns relations among the content of knowledge\u2014how one part of the content of knowledge justifies another. It is not concerned with causal relations between acts of the mind in perception. Plausibly, the only content that could justify a thought must itself be something thinkable, since \u201cknowledge is only grounded through other knowledge\u201d (Natorp 1887: 168). (In this sense, the denial of the given is a denial of content that is not conceptual or dependent on what is conceptual.) In Cassirer\u2019s polemic against the given, he attacks the \u201cepistemological atomism\u201d implicit in it: the view that there are some contents that can be efficacious for knowledge without requiring that a knower possess any concepts or know any facts. (In this sense, the denial of the given is a defense of semantic holism.) For this reason, he argues against the given by arguing that even the most basic experiments\u2014measurements\u2014depend on the experimenter possessing concepts and knowing certain theoretical facts (see section 2.3 below).\n\nThe Marburg philosophers characterize their philosophy as a kind of \u201cidealism\u201d. This idealism should be sharply distinguished from \u201csubjectivism\u201d, since they do not believe that objects of knowledge are representations\u2014they do not believe that the objects of knowledge depend for their existence on the existence of minds to think them (Cassirer 1910: 298). This idealism is also opposed to the view that our knowledge is really illusory; they do not hold that there are unknowable objects, or that the real nature of objects of knowledge is in principle unknowable (Cohen 1902: 507ff). Rather, their position is idealist in four senses. First, they defend an \u201cidealist\u201d conception of philosophy, as following the transcendental method. In this sense, idealism is opposed to \u201cnaturalism\u201d, the view that the method of philosophy does not differ in kind from that of the natural sciences. Second, they hold that there are substantive a priori principles that make experience possible. In this sense, their idealism is opposed to empiricism. Third, according to their theory of objective validity, our conception of an object depends on our conception of objectivity, which is grounded in the idea of the unity of knowledge according to laws. In this sense of idealism, idealism is opposed to \u201crealism\u201d, which takes the concept of an object as a philosophical primitive. Fourth, according to their philosophy of science (see below section 2.3), our empirical theories make essential use of fundamental concepts (such as mathematical concepts, or \u201ctheoretical concepts\u201d, such as the concept <force> or <energy>) that are radically unlike the features that the world appears to have to untutored, everyday experience. These \u201cideal\u201d concepts are not reducible to \u201csensible\u201d concepts such as color, texture, or shape. In this sense, idealism is opposed to \u201csensualism\u201d.\n\nThe Marburg conception of philosophy, as guided by the transcendental method, along with their rejection of the given, leads them to a unique conception of logic. For further discussion, see the Supplement, Philosophy of Logic in the Marburg School.\n\nThe Marburg rejection of the given, along with their view that objectivity is conferred by laws, has significant consequences for their philosophy of psychology. For further information, see the Supplement, Philosophy of Psychology in the Marburg School.\n\n2.3 Philosophy of Natural Science\n\nThe Marburg philosophers wrote several works that engaged in a detailed way with the natural science, especially physics, of their day. In his Forward and Introduction to the sixth edition of Lange\u2019s History of Materialism, first published in 1898, Cohen gives a philosophical interpretation of work on electromagnetism since Faraday, and defends Hertz\u2019s Principles of Mechanics (Hertz 1894). In two works both published in 1910 (Natorp 1910: Ch.7; Cassirer 1910: Ch.4) Natorp and Cassirer discuss foundational issues in physics: the principles of mechanics and thermodynamics; the nature of mass, energy, space, and time; atomism and its critics. (Cassirer also addresses foundational issues in chemistry: 1910: Ch.4, section 8). The culmination of this work is Cassirer\u2019s Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity, published in 1921.\n\nThere are three themes that run through Marburg work in the philosophy of natural science: they argue that contemporary natural science supports philosophical idealism; they highlight radical conceptual changes in physics; and they philosophically interpret physics in the light of their conception of objective validity. Each of these themes is discussed in the rest of the section.\n\nIdealism in Natural Science\n\nOne of Cohen\u2019s chief goals in Cohen 1898 is to show that recent work in electromagnetism undermines \u201csensualism\u201d or \u201cmaterialism\u201d, and supports \u201cidealism\u201d, by transforming our conception of physical reality away from the \u201csensible\u201d and \u201cmaterial\u201d to the \u201cideal\u201d. The physical world, according to the \u201csensible\u201d conception of reality\u2014the way the world appears to us to be through our senses\u2014is composed of matter, conceived on the model of the roughly medium sized dry goods that our senses reveal to us. Physicists working in electromagnetism\u2014Cohen points to Faraday especially\u2014demonstrated the physical reality of electromagnetic fields. Following Faraday, Cohen applauds efforts to treat electromagnetic fields and forces as independent entities in their own right, not dependent on a \u201cmaterial\u201d ether. Pure field theories thus vindicate idealism, by showing that our conception of the objects of physics should not be constrained by the picture of the world supplied by our senses; our conception of the world can only be supplied by thought, and not by the senses.\n\nGiven Cohen\u2019s opposition to ether theories, it is not surprising that he feels vindicated by Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity (Cohen 1898: 134; the passage appears in 1914\u20135 edition). In fact, Cassirer claims (1921: Ch.4) that Einstein\u2019s general theory, which departs further from the \u201csensible\u201d conception of matter by not separating matter from space and time, is a natural continuation of the idealism Cohen first articulated.\n\nRadical Conceptual Change in Natural Science\n\nAccording to the Marburg transcendental method (section 2.1), the \u201cfact\u201d of science is not static, but dynamic. In advocating this method, the Marburg Neo-Kantians are thus claiming that the principles that are a priori for science will evolve as theories change, and the concepts that function as categories will be radically reconceived as science progresses. There is then a new task, to identify the principles that are a priori in a given physical theory, and to investigate how the categories\u2014space, time, substance, magnitude\u2014are being reconceived in our current best physical theories. The Marburgers are thus committed to a view of scientific progress that emphasizes conceptual shifts in science. Scientists don\u2019t just discover new facts: they also develop new concepts, and radically revise their fundamental concepts.\n\nFurthermore, according to the Marburg conception of objectivity and objecthood, objecthood\u2014what it is to be an object\u2014is conceptually dependent on objectivity, which is explained in terms of laws. The upshot of this is that our notion of a physical object is determined by the most fundamental laws of our science. Marburg Neo-Kantianism therefore highlights the fact that scientific progress requires fundamental shifts in science\u2019s ontology\u2014its conception of what there is.\n\nThese themes are apparent already in Cohen\u2019s introduction to Lange (Cohen 1898). Following Hertz, Cohen surveys three different proposals for the principles of mechanics: Newton\u2019s view (which takes as fundamental space, time, mass, and force); an alternative that replaces the notion of force with energy; and Hertz\u2019s own radical view, which uses only the notions of space, time, and mass. Cohen argues for Hertz\u2019s view, emphasizing how it fundamentally reconceptualizes the traditional notion of \u201cmass\u201d (Cohen 1898: 128ff.). This same tendency is even more apparent in Cassirer\u2019s writings on Einstein. He argues that Einstein introduces new a priori principles: the constancy of the speed of light (in the special theory), and the principles of general covariance and the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass (in the general theory) (1921: 415, 428). And he emphasizes the transformations in the notions of substance, space, and time that the general theory requires (1921: Chs. 3\u20135).[13]\n\nObjective Validity of Natural Science\n\nFor Marburg Neo-Kantianism, objectivity and objecthood are explained in terms of the unity of knowledge. Explaining the unity of scientific knowledge over time becomes especially pressing for them given their emphasis on radical conceptual change in natural science. If even the categories are shifting over time, in what sense is there unity to our knowledge?\n\nThis problem is made more pressing in conjunction with the Marburg attack on the given. (After all, if there were something given in experience, then the given in experience would determine which conceptual changes are necessary in science, and the objectivity of our scientific knowledge could be explained.) In the philosophy of science, the attack on the given amounts to an attack on the possibility of crucial experiments\u2014experiments that would, in a theory neutral way, establish the truth of a scientific theory. Marburg philosophers emphasized that even the most primitive experimental results\u2014measurements\u2014presuppose a good amount of \u201ctheoretical\u201d machinery: not only mathematics, but even physical laws. Cassirer cited Duhem in support (1910: Ch.4). Duhemian underdetermination of scientific theory by experience showed, Cassirer believed, that there is no given: no autonomous layer of self-authenticating experiences.\n\nMarburg philosophy of science thus includes the claim that there could be rival scientific theories, each of which is empirically adequate.[14] Given this, in what sense is science objective? How is there unity in science, when there are no theory-neutral experiments that would prevent different scientists from adopting different theories? Cassirer (1910) in particular proposed an intricate answer to this question (Heis 2014). He argued that there is a common set of demands on theories that will constrain the choice of theory. These demands are a priori, in a regulative sense, and partially constitute what he calls the \u201cform\u201d of a scientific theory. These demands include that a theory be simple and of wide scope.[15] He also argues that even in the face of radical conceptual changes and shifts in ontology, some features of scientific theories are maintained\u2014for instance the approximate mathematical structure of the theory.\n\nFor further discussion of the philosophy of mathematics, see the Supplement, Philosophy of Mathematics in the Marburg School.\n\n3. The Southwest School\n\nThe beginning of the Southwest School of Neo-Kantianism can arguably be located in Wilhelm Windelband\u2019s 1883 essay, \u201cCritical or Genetic Method?\u201d, which for the first time both gives a clear exposition of the philosophical point of view that would characterize the Southwest school and argues explicitly for a return to Kant. However, many of the core ideas in that essay were already articulated by Windelband\u2019s teacher, Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881), principally in his Logic (1874). Lotze argued for a clean distinction between philosophy and psychology. Logic depends on the distinction between \u201ctruth and untruth\u201d, and gives the laws that thought ought to obey, while psychology identifies the laws that mental processes do obey. Logic gives laws governing the content of thoughts, while psychology concerns acts of thinking (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x; \u00a7332; on the act/content distinction see also Lotze 1856\u201364: vol.2, 630; Lotze 1874: \u00a7337). The contents of thoughts are objective, inasmuch as they are not only shareable but have a reality independent of being thought. Though these contents are real, they do not occur (as events do), do not exist or have being (as things do), but are valid (1874: \u00a7\u00a7314\u2013318). Though Lotze did not explicitly call for a return to Kant, he did articulate many of the themes that the SW Neo-Kantians located in Kant. Lotze argued that knowing cannot be considered a copying [Abbilden] of its object (\u00a7327); he held that knowledge requires a priori elements, and that apriority is not the same as innateness (\u00a7324); and more generally he positioned his philosophy as a middle ground between speculative idealism and materialism.\n\nAfter completing his dissertation, on the doctrine of chance, under Lotze in 1870, Windelband (1848\u20131915), moved to Strassburg in 1882, and then to Heidelberg in 1902. A master essayist, he is best known for the essays and addresses collected in his Pr\u00e4ludien (1915), which was first published in 1883. In \u201cCritical or Genetic Method?\u201d\u2014the important essay just mentioned\u2014Windelband self-consciously looks to Kant and the critical philosophy as the key to clearly distinguishing philosophy from psychology. Picking up Lotze\u2019s key notion of validity, he argues that Kant\u2019s project is best understood as a study of validity: the topic of philosophy is value, or the \u201cvalidity of axioms\u201d or norms. This study of validity should be broadened to all areas of culture. This broadening of the critical project was carried further in his essay, \u201cHistory and Natural Science\u201d (1894), which argued (against the positivist theory of history), that history provides a distinct way of knowing (which he calls, \u201cidiographic\u201d), distinct from the natural scientific (\u201cnomothetic\u201d) way of knowing. Windelband was also a prolific and original historian of philosophy, culminating in 1891 with his history of philosophy from ancient to modern times (Windelband 1891). He articulated and defended a conception of doing history of philosophy (Problemgeschichte, history of philosophical problems) that became standard for the Neo-Kantians of both schools.\n\nThese programmatic ideas in the theory of knowledge and the philosophy of history were expanded systematically by Windelband\u2019s student Heinrich Rickert (1863\u20131936). After writing his dissertation (\u201cThe Theory of Definition\u201d) under Windelband in Strassburg in 1888, Rickert moved to Freiburg in 1889. The philosophical school became known as the Southwest or Baden school, because Freiburg and Heidelberg are both in Baden in southwest Germany. In 1892, he published The Object of Knowledge (Rickert 1915), which he expanded and modified in subsequent editions over the next thirty years. His most influential book, The Limits of Concept Formation in Natural Science (1st ed: 1902) greatly expands and systematically develops the core idea in Windelband\u2019s essay \u201cHistory and Natural Science\u201d. His book Das Eine, die Einheit und die Eins (Oneness, Unity, and the Number One, 1911), was one of the few SW works in the philosophy of mathematics.\n\nAmong the students of Rickert and Windelband who aligned themselves with their philosophical point of view, the most influential and philosophically sophisticated was Emil Lask (1875\u20131915).[16] After studying under Windelband in Heidelberg and Rickert in Frieburg, Lask wrote his dissertation under Rickert in 1902 (\u201cFichte\u2019s Idealism and History\u201d). He later habilitated at Heidelberg, where Windelband was located, and eventually became a professor there. While there, he wrote two dense works, The Logic of Philosophy and the Doctrine of the Categories (1911), and The Doctrine of Judgment (1912). Tragically, he died in 1915 in the Great War.\n\n3.1 Conception of Philosophy: Philosophy as Theory of Value\n\n\u201cKant posed a new conception of philosophy\u2019s task and mode of knowledge against the psychologism of his contemporaries\u201d, Windelband writes in his programmatic essay, \u201cCritical or Genetic Method?\u201d (Windelband 1883: 271). On this Kantian view, Windelband asserts, philosophy\u2019s subject matter is the \u201cvalidity\u201d [Geltung] of \u201caxioms\u201d. Philosophy must identify these axioms, put them into a system, and explain how these axioms govern the activities of knowing, acting, and judging. This latter task requires giving a general account of validity, in addition to identifying how the various sciences and areas of culture are governed by specific axioms. Logic (or theoretical philosophy, or \u201ctheory of knowledge\u201d) is the science of the axioms for knowing; ethics is the science of the norms for acting; aesthetics is the science of the rules of the \u201ceffects of the emotions\u201d (1883: 274\u20135).\n\nThis conception of philosophy furnishes the SW School with an antidote to psychologism, which differs fundamentally from the kind of anti-psychologism proferred by the Marburg school (see section 2.1). For Windelband, axioms are understood \u201cteleologically\u201d: they are the rules that must be followed if certain ends are to be realized. For instance, logic gives those norms that must be followed if one wants to believe what is true. Axioms are norms, and their necessity is normative necessity. Essentially, philosophy is distinct from psychology because norms are distinct from facts. The norms that, as a matter of fact, people do recognize have only \u201cfactual validity\u201d, and not \u201cteleological validity\u201d.[17] What Windelband calls the \u201cgenetic method\u201d recognizes only factual validity or generality. It seeks to demonstrate the validity of axioms by showing that these axioms are built into our psychology, or are universal to all cultures. The genetic method therefore makes philosophy dependent on psychology and cultural history. But the genetic method is hopeless: one cannot prove the axioms that govern all sciences by using psychology or anthropology, since these sciences themselves presuppose these axioms. Indeed, the genetic method threatens relativism, since we cannot say what humans will believe at all times and places, but only what they believe now, or what is believed in this or that culture. Indeed, on the genetic method, truth and goodness are reduced to social power or majority opinion.\n\nThe critical method, on the other hand, begins with the assumption that there are universal, absolute values which all subjects ought to recognize and conform to. It postulates a \u201cnormal consciousness whose principles must be recognized, insofar as anything at all is to have universal validity\u201d (Windelband 1883: 280). This normal consciousness,[18] inasmuch as it embodies a norm, is not an empirically real subject and cannot be investigated using the genetic method. The \u201caxioms\u201d, which form the subject matter of philosophy, are the principles that must have normative force if there is to be a normal consciousness at all. These axioms are \u201cmeans to the end of universal validity\u201d (1883: 281)\u2014they are the norms that must be recognized if there are to be any universally valid norms at all. For example, there could be a normal consciousness in a world where ripe tomatoes are blue and not red. Thus the norm \u201cBelieve that ripe tomatoes are red\u201d, though it is true and thus universally valid in our world, is not an axiom\u2014not a norm whose recognition is a precondition of universal validity. The law of contradiction, on the other hand, is a precondition of universal validity. No matter what color ripe tomatoes are in our world, there would be no point in adopting the norm \u201cBelieve that ripe tomatoes are red\u201d as a norm of truth, unless we also recognize the demand to avoid contradictions. The proof that these axioms are the indispensable preconditions of universal validity cannot be empirical, as the genetic method would require.\n\nThe defining claim of SW Neo-Kantianism is that there are universally valid norms, and every universally valid norm has an a priori ground.[19] The concept of the a priori is therefore not a psychological or biological notion (the a priori is not the innate), nor is it an anthropological notion (the a priori is not what is universally assented to). The a priori are norms, the recognition of which is indispensable for normative activities. In theoretical philosophy, the a priori are norms the recognition of which are necessary for making universally valid judgments\u2014judgments that make a claim to truth, truth for every other cognizer. These a priori theoretical norms include the laws of logic. For natural science, the law of causality is an a priori norm; for history (see section 3.3), it is a priori that there are universal values that make certain individuals historically significant (Rickert 1902: 334). Similarly, there are universally binding norms in ethics and aesthetics, which make it possible that certain actions and emotions are universally valid.\n\nLask agrees with his teachers in characterizing philosophy as the science of validity (Lask 1911: 401). He recognizes, however, that the SW Neo-Kantian insistence on the objectivity of what is valid, along with their distinction between the factual and the normative, threatens to devolve into a \u201ctwo world\u201d metaphysics that is potentially incompatible with Kantianism. In fact, Lotze (Lask argues) opted precisely for such a two world theory, where what is valid is set over against what is, or has being. This dualism is unpalatable, since it would leave it unexplained how senses (i.e., the contents of our sentences) come to be true of what is, thus reigniting the question (famously posed by Kant in his 1772 letter to Herz) about how representations can relate to objects at all. Lask thus argued that Neo-Kantianism had to be completed by taking a Kantian \u201cCopernican Turn\u201d[20] (Lask 1911: First Part, \u00a71). Just as Kant argued that the object must conform to our cognition of it, Lask holds that both the senses of our sentences and the objects that have being share a form (\u00a72). The form of a sense is theoretical validity [G\u00fcltigkeit], and the form of an object is objectivity [Gegenst\u00e4ndlichkeit]. The Copernican view, then, is that theoretical validity just is objectivity. The two world theory thus becomes a two element theory (\u00a73). There is one realm (the realm of theoretical sense or being), within which we can distinguish a formal element and a material element. The formal element is validity, which is the subject matter of philosophy, while the material element is sensible. Validity, however, is not supersensible (such as the objects of dogmatic theology or cosmology would be), but rather \u201cnon-sensible\u201d, since it is an element in the sensible objects of our experience.\n\nLast, it should be emphasized that for Windelband and the rest of the SW Neo-Kantians, the goal of the critical philosophy is to be an \u201call-encompassing philosophy of culture\u201d (Windelband 1910). In particular, they wanted to expand Kant\u2019s critical project to those areas of culture that Kant\u2019s original draft of critical philosophy had neglected: the so-called \u201cGeisteswissenschaften\u201d, principally history.\n\n3.2 Theory of Knowledge\n\nThere are four fundamental features of the SW Neo-Kantians\u2019 theory of knowledge: a normative theory of objectivity and objecthood; the act/content/object distinction; the rejection of the copy theory of knowledge; and a theory of what is given in perceptual experience. This section addresses each of these features in turn.\n\nObjectivity and Objecthood\n\nThe central question that Rickert poses in his The Object of Knowledge, which is the most developed and thorough SW work in the theory of knowledge, is \u201cWhat is the object of knowledge, which is independent of the subject, or in virtue of what does cognizing achieve objectivity?\u201d (Rickert 1915: 1). In particular, Rickert is concerned with the \u201ctranscendence\u201d of the object: that the object is an independent standard for knowledge, that it determines whether knowledge is true or objective. Rickert\u2019s answer to these questions is that the object is a \u201ctranscendent ought\u201d [Sollen], and not fundamentally a \u201ctranscendent being\u201d [Sein] or \u201creality\u201d [Wirklichkeit]. This is a distinctive view. It is, of course, a platitude that objects are normative in the sense that our beliefs about an object ought to be true of it. But a common view is that this normativity is derivative: our beliefs about an object ought to be a certain way, because the object itself is a certain way. On this common view, the object\u2019s standing as a \u201ctranscendent ought\u201d is grounded in its \u201ctranscendent being\u201d. Rickert rejects this view. He argues that the only norms that can be derived from what is [sein], are conditional norms, to the effect that one ought to do such and such if one happens to will a certain thing\u2014norms that are neither objective, nor independent of the subject. Such a view either undermines the theory of knowledge as a normative discipline (and truth as a value), or undermines objectivity (Rickert 1915: 281). Rickert therefore advocates upending the common view. He takes norms of cognition as basic and irreducible, and argues that the transcendent reality of objects is grounded in these irreducible cognitive norms.\n\nIn Lask 1911 and Lask 1912, Lask follows his teacher in talking of the object as \u201ccontaining a value\u201d or being the standard for knowledge. Drawing on Rickert\u2019s ideas, he argues that the objectivity (of an object) is just the same thing as validity (of values), and that both objects and senses share this form. Nevertheless, Lask departs from Rickert\u2019s view in two ways. First, he argues that\n\nas we must fight every version of truth that is characterized by mirroring and shadowing, so also conversely, we must fight any assertion of a dependence in the opposite direction, a priority of theoretical validity, of the \u201cdemand\u201d, of the \u201cought\u201d before being. (Lask 1911: 410)\n\nThe transcendent being of an object is no more derivative from the normativity of our claims about that object than the latter is on the former (Lask 1908). Second, Lask argues that the object has a form and a matter, and that the form alone is what is valid. Thus the object is not itself a transcendent ought, but only its form is.[21]\n\nAct, Content, and Object of Thinking\n\nLotze had distinguished psychology from the theory of knowledge (what Lotze calls \u201clogic\u201d) by distinguishing the acts of thinking, which are events and constitute the subject matter of psychology, from the contents of thinking, which are valid and constitute the subject matter of logic (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x; \u00a7332). This distinction was taken up and ramified by Rickert and Lask. Starting in the 1915 third edition of The Object of Knowledge, Rickert argued that the content [Gehalt] of a judgment had to be split up into two parts: the unreal [unwirklich], objective content [Gehalt], and the subjective, \u201cimmanent sense\u201d [Urteilssinn] of the judgment. This immanent sense is distinct from the act of judging, which is \u201creal\u201d and the subject matter of psychology. Rickert calls the immanent sense \u201cirreal\u201d [irreal]. The immanent sense is the orienting of the subject toward the objective content (Rickert 1915: 164\u2013167; Ch.3, \u00a74). What Rickert means by this can be brought out by contrasting it with the objective content, which Rickert takes to be a whole composed of connected representations. For example, the three sentences \u201cIs snow white?\u201d, \u201cSnow is white\u201d, and \u201cSnow is not white\u201d, for Rickert all have the same objective content, since in all three the same representation (\u201cwhite\u201d) is predicated categorically of the same representation (\u201csnow\u201d). The difference is in the \u201cimmanent sense\u201d of the sentences: the first sentence questions whether the content is true, the second affirms that the content is true, and the third denies that the content is true (Rickert 1915: 175; Ch.3, \u00a76). Rickert\u2019s distinction between immanent sense and objective content fits more naturally than does the simple act/content distinction with the SW conception of philosophy as the theory of values, and thus with their conception of the theory of knowledge as concerned with the norm of truth. After all, if theory of knowledge is concerned only with abstract, objective contents, then it is not clear why it would be any more normative than natural science. A science that isolates the laws of abstract things would seem just as descriptive as a science that isolates the laws of concrete things\u2014as Husserl argued forcefully in Logical Investigations (Husserl 1900). Norms seem more suited for acts, not objective contents. But to swing in the opposite direction, and take theory of knowledge to concern acts of cognition wouldn\u2019t help either, since the laws that govern the acts are just descriptive laws that predict what a psychophysical subject will think under certain circumstances. The theory of knowledge, however, can be normative if it concerns the element intermediate between acts and objective contents: it gives the norms for immanent senses, stances taken toward objective contents.\n\nA different kind of refinement of the act/content/object distinction appears in Lask\u2019s 1912 Die Lehre vom Urteil (The Doctrine of Judgment).[22] Lask wants a theory of judgment that recognizes that the object is the standard of truth; and that truth does not depend on the act of judging\u2014just as anti-psychologism demands. Lask believes that the standard distinctions between act, content, and object do not fully recognize this. In particular, he rejects Rickert\u2019s view that, in judging, a subject takes a stance with respect to the objective content. This is because Lask believes that the objective content is created by the act of judging, and so Rickert\u2019s view has the unpalatable consequence that our acts of judging are about something that is created by our acts of judgment, thus violating the idea that our judgments answer to something prior to the act of judging. On the other hand, he cannot say that in judging, we judge the object itself, since all judgments have a structure (one thing is predicated of another), and the object, he argues, is an unstructured whole whose articulation into parts is a work of the mind. Lask therefore posits, in addition to the content of the judgment and the object itself, a third thing, which he calls the \u201cprimary object\u201d (Lask 1912: Ch.1). The primary object is a structured whole, which (as structured) is distinct from the object itself, but (as structured in a way that differs from the logical structures possessed by judgments) is distinct from the content of the judgment, as well. Judging is then a decision about whether the predication in the primary object is valid, and the content is the thought that the primary object is valid. The judgment thus aims to successfully \u201creproduce\u201d or \u201crebuild\u201d [nachbilden] in a structured form the originally unstructured object (Lask 1912: Ch.2, \u00a71), and truth, as the adequate rebuilding of the object, becomes a kind of correspondence (Ch.2, \u00a72).[23]\n\nRejection of the Copy Theory of Knowledge\n\nAnother idea, present in Lotze, though ultimately derived from Kant, is the rejection of the copy theory [Abbildtheorie] of knowledge. \u201cSince the Critique of Pure Reason\u201d, Windelband writes,\n\nthe days are over once and for all when a mature philosophical consciousness might think of the world as \u201cgiven\u201d and mirrored in it, as it would seem to the naive consciousness. In everything we regard as given our reason is already at work: and the justification of our knowledge of things rests only on our first creating them for ourselves. (1910 [NKR: 318])\n\nNo knowledge, not even perceptual knowledge, is merely receptive, or a mirror, but is a product that results from the application of a priori forms to what is given. The explicit attack on the copy theory becomes more explicit in Windelband and Rickert\u2019s writings over time: starting in the 1915 third edition of The Object of Knowledge, Rickert devotes a section (Chapter 2, section VI) explicitly to attacking the copy theory, and he devotes a late essay (Rickert 1934) to what he sees as a revival of the errors of the copy theory in Heidegger. In the latter essay, Rickert attacks \u201ctheoretical intuitionism\u201d, the idea that cognition [Erkenntnis] is no more than intuition [Anschauung], a passive reception of the object that is given to us. Such a view implies that cognition is simply a copy of the object, which resembles it. However, he argues that intuition, the passive reception of what is given, merely gives \u201ckennen\u201d (acquaintance with), and not true \u201cerkennen\u201d (cognizing). Cognition requires a \u201ccomplete transformation of the given intuition through non-intuitive factors\u201d (1934 [NKR: 391]).\n\nThe Given\n\nThough the SW and Marburg school agree in their rejection of the copy theory, they take very different attitudes toward the distinction between intuitions and concepts, and toward the \u201cgiven\u201d. For the Marburg school, there is nothing given; the SW School argues only that knowledge is not a copy of the given, but requires a transformation of it. For the Marburg school, there is no distinction between intuitions and concepts; for the SW School, intuitions are irreducible to concepts. These two points are developed by Rickert. He holds that the content of a sensory consciousness, what is given in perception, is a \u201cheterogeneous continuum\u201d and an \u201cunsurveyable manifold\u201d (1915: 406\u20137; Ch.5, \u00a75, \u201cKonstitutive Wirklichkeitsformen und Methodologische Erkenntnisformen\u201d). This multiplicity of content in perception can only be felt [Erlebnis, Gef\u00fchl], since it would be an infinite (and so impossible) task to express this content in conceptual form (1915: 139; Ch.3, section 1, \u201cDas Erkennen als Vorstellen\u201d). So cognition cannot be a reproduction, or mirror, of what is given; the concept cannot be a reproduction of the intuition. Rather, concepts are always general, and overcome the multiplicity of the content of sensory consciousness by leaving out content that is present in intuition (Rickert 1902: Ch.1, \u00a71). This idea is further developed by Lask (1911). He argues that a theoretical sense (e.g., the sense of this or that sentence) is composed of matter and form, that the form of the sense is validity, while the matter is the \u201cnon-valid sensible\u201d, or \u201calogical content\u201d. This material matter, though it can be taken up into a concept as its matter, is not itself conceptual, or reducible or transformable into what is conceptual. The sensible content (i.e., the content of a sensory consciousness) is \u201csomething irrational\u201d or \u201cforeign to meaning\u201d, and can only be passively taken in, felt, and intuited (Lask 1911: 415\u2013417; First Part, \u00a73). The sense of a sentence does not mirror or copy the sensory given: the sensory given is its matter. Lask summarizes the difference between the Marburg view and this conception as a distinction between \u201cpanlogicism\u201d (the view that all content is conceptual content\u2014the kind of content that is the subject matter of logic) and \u201cpanarchy of logos\u201d (his view that all content, even sensory content, can be the matter for conceptual form, without being reduced to it) (Lask 1911: 426; Second Part, Ch.1, \u00a73).\n\n3.3 Philosophy of Historical Sciences\n\nWindelband\u2019s most influential and widely-read work, and indeed, the most influential and widely-read of all of the SW Neo-Kantian writings, is his essay, \u201cHistory and Natural Science\u201d. This essay is a contribution to the philosophical debate sparked by the 19th century explosion in what we might call the human sciences\u2014principally history, but also comparative linguistics, anthropology, and comparative religion\u2014that seemed rigorous and so \u201cscientific\u201d, but that seemed to differ fundamentally from paradigm mathematical natural sciences such as physics.[24] Windelband\u2019s chief claim is that there is an irreducible methodological difference (or, as he puts it, a \u201clogical\u201d difference) between history and the natural sciences.\n\n[W]e have before us a purely methodological classification of the empirical sciences that is grounded upon sound logical concepts. The principle of classification is the formal property of the theoretical or cognitive objectives of the science in question. One kind of science is an inquiry into general laws. The other kind of science is an inquiry into specific historical facts. In the language of formal logic, the objective of the first kind of science is the general, apodictic judgment; the objective of the other kind of science is the singular, assertoric proposition. (Windelband 1894: 291)\n\nThose sciences, such as mathematical physics, whose goal is to produce general laws are called \u201cnomothetic\u201d; those sciences, such as history, whose goal is to know a unique, singular individual, are called \u201cidiographic\u201d. The individual that is the subject of idiographic sciences need not be an individual human being, such as Caesar. It could be a unique event or sequence of events (the fall of the Roman empire); an individual nation, language, religion, or culture (Florence during the Renaissance); or a unique artifact of literature, art, or science (Homer\u2019s Iliad). The important point is that an idiographic science has as its goal to understand an individual in all its uniqueness.[25] Nomothetic sciences want to know laws; idiographic sciences want to know unique processes. The nomothetic seeks the general, and what happens invariably; the idiographic seeks the particular, and what only happens once. Nomothetic sciences begin with what is given to intuition [Anschauung], but ascend to what is abstract and no longer intuitive; idiographic sciences proceed in the opposite direction, attempting to resurrect and reproduce a unique individual in all its vitality, detail, and intuitiveness [Anschaulichkeit].\n\nWindelband\u2019s chief target is the positivist philosophy of history, defended by Comte, Mill, and others. On this view, the method of history ought to be fundamentally the same as that of the natural sciences, and its goal ought to be the discovery of general laws that explain and predict historical events.[26] A secondary target of this essay is the view that history and the natural sciences can be distinguished principally in terms of their subject matter. This view is expressed by the terms \u201cNaturwissenschaften\u201d (sciences of nature) and \u201cGeisteswissenschaften\u201d (sciences of \u201cmind\u201d or \u201cspirit\u201d), which Dilthey introduced in his 1883 book Introduction to the Geisteswissenschaften. Windelband objects that when the distinction among the sciences is drawn in this way, psychology ends up as a Geisteswissenschaft like history; indeed psychology, as the empirical science of the mind, ought to be the fundamental Geisteswissenschaft on which all other Geisteswissenschaften depend. But, Windelband argues, psychology is methodologically just as much a \u201cnomothetic\u201d science as physics is: both try to discover mathematical laws of their phenomena through controlled experimentation.[27] And the amount of psychology that a historian needs does not go beyond what is supplied by reflective common sense; the new discoveries of empirical psychologists have been, and are likely to be, of no special significance for historians.[28]\n\nThe conception of history first sketched in Windelband\u2019s \u201cHistory and Natural Science\u201d was thoroughly elaborated and expanded in Rickert\u2019s The Limits of Concept Formation in Natural Science. Rickert improves on Windelband\u2019s view in two principal ways: he systematically develops Windelband\u2019s idea that the distinction between history and natural science must be grounded in logic, and he connects the distinction in kinds of sciences to the characteristic SW distinction between fact and value.\n\nAs Rickert\u2019s title emphasizes, he conceived of history as a logical notion, as a certain way of forming concepts. The traditional logic, he claims, considers only concepts formed by abstracting away from individual particularities to form general representations. But this method has its limit: it cannot explain how we form concepts of individuals. History is a logical procedure for forming concepts of individuals, as, for instance, a historical work on Caesar would produce a concept of Caesar. In calling the products of historical research \u201cconcepts\u201d, Rickert is combating the view that a historian merely collects facts and reports them. Rather, the historian sifts through the potentially infinite number of facts about her subject and isolates, using some principle of selection, the facts about her subject that are essential for history.[29] Though Rickert employs the traditional logical notion of an individual to characterize the subject of historical concepts, he uses the term in a distinctive way. Individuals are unique and they are indivisible or irreplaceable. An adequate historical concept of Julius Caesar needs to include those features that make him unique, and unlike any other individual. Rickert uses the example of the Koh-i-noor diamond to illustrate the indivisibility or irreplaceability of an historical individual. Of course there are distinctive facts about this diamond that distinguish it from all other hunks of carbon; but the same could be said of any lump of coal. However, from the point of view of history, it is indifferent whether one lump of coal that was used to power a locomotive carrying Queen Victoria would have been destroyed and replaced by some other lump of coal. But, from the point of view of history, the massive diamond that the Queen herself was wearing is hardly replaceable. Furthermore, Rickert insisted that historical concepts, although they are of an individual, are nonetheless general in the sense that the principles of selection employed in forming these concepts are universally valid for all historians.[30]\n\nWhen Rickert insists that concepts of historical individuals are formed through employing principles of selection that are universally valid, he is bringing into the philosophy of history the characteristic SW distinction between fact and value. The principles of selection are given by values. The Koh-i-noor diamond is a historical individual because it is widely held to be uniquely beautiful, and it forms a central part of the crown jewels of the British monarch; it is thus related, say, to the values of beauty, social order, and national identity.[31] Rickert therefore concludes that \u201cthe claim that historical concepts have an unconditionally general validity presupposes the acknowledgment of unconditionally general values\u201d (Rickert 1902: 360). The SW view of history thus attempts to thread the needle between positivism and more radical forms of historicism: it makes history an autonomous science, without falling into relativism. (Clearly, in arguing that the concepts of history are objectively valid, despite the fact that history does not include universal laws, the SW Neo-Kantians are rejecting the Marburg view that objective validity depends on laws. This is a paradigm case where their differing conceptions of objective validity, as normative or nomological, are brought to bear.) Indeed, Rickert claims that there are certain a priori conditions of history, just as Kant had claimed in the first Critique that there are certain a priori conditions for natural science. It is a priori that every historical individual is value-relevant. It is also a priori that there are certain values, such as beauty or social order, that are universally valid. Inasmuch as a culture is a collection of values, or value-relevant individuals, the most apt way of characterizing the subject matter of a science like history is as a science of culture, as opposed to a science of mind (Geisteswissenschaft).[32]"}, {"url": "http://www.worldheritage.org/articles/Wilhelm_Windelband", "page_content": "World Heritage Encyclopedia\n\nThe World Heritage Encyclopedia is the largest and most comprehensive Encyclopedia ever compiled.

He managed his publications in a way that should strike the contemporary reader as familiar. He would present new ideas and lines of inquiry first in exploratory journal articles (many of them published in Logos, the journal he founded in Freiburg) and subsequently he would incorporate them in larger publications, often including previously published materials. Following a common trend in his time, he kept working at his two major books, The Object of Knowledge (first published in 1892) and The Limits of Concept-Formation in Natural Science (first published in 1902), for his entire life. Instead of writing new books he would rewrite entire chapters and add new sections to his two magna opera, thereby addressing criticism and sometimes even changing significantly his previous views. So, for instance, The Object of Knowledge grew from the 91 pages of the first edition to the 460 pages of the sixth edition in 1928. This style of writing makes the development of his thought particularly perspicuous. However, in spite of his constant revisions and additions, the fundamental principles of Rickert\u2019s philosophy remained constant throughout his career. In keeping with his systematic understanding of philosophy (see below), his approach to new problems was geared towards connecting them to old problems, and his way of handling criticism was often characterized by an effort to reformulate his opponent\u2019s views so as to make them compatible with his own.\n\nRickert had a long and successful academic career. He received several awards and honorary degrees. He taught and in some cases supervised important German thinkers of the next generation, such as Martin Heidegger (1889\u20131976), Emil Lask (1875\u20131915) and Walter Benjamin (1892\u20131940). He had close intellectual exchanges with leading figures of his time, including Wilhelm Dilthey (1833\u20131911), Georg Simmel (1858\u20131918), Edmund Husserl (1859\u20131938), Max Weber (1864\u20131920) and Karl Jaspers (1883\u20131969). Although very few of his writings are available in English, in recent years there has been a growing interest in Rickert\u2019s work, both to the extent that it influenced other philosophers and as a significant contribution to the discipline in its own right.\n\nHeinrich Rickert was born in Gda\u0144sk (then Danzig, in Prussia) on May 25 th 1863. His father Heinrich Rickert Sr. (1833\u20131902) was a politician and editor in Berlin. Heinrich Sr. was a liberal democrat particularly invested in the cause of the German Jews. In 1890 Heinrich Sr. founded the Society Against Anti-Semitism in Berlin (Zijderveld 2006, 9). This is an interesting fact about Rickert Jr.\u2019s background, considering that he eventually worked to support the appointment of philosophers of Jewish descent, such as Edmund Husserl and Georg Simmel, who were not under the protective wing of Hermann Cohen, the head of the Marburg School of Neo-Kantianism (see below) and a very influential Jewish thinker.\n\nRickert is considered the head of the so-called Southwestern or Baden school of Neo-Kantianism, whose exponents worked in the philosophy departments at Freiburg and Heidelberg, both in the region of Baden in southwestern Germany. The Southwestern school stands in contrast to the so-called Marburg school, spearheaded by Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918) and continued by Paul Natorp (1854\u20131924) and Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945). (For an overview of the two schools see Crowell 1999.)\n\nIn spite of their fierce opposition, the two schools present elements of similarity alongside the numerous elements of difference. These have been recently debated among Neo-Kantianism scholars (Krijnen 2001, 77\u201393; Krijnen/Noras 2012). One indisputably common element between the two schools is the preoccupation with the problem of validity, or Geltung, which is arguably the systematic core of Neo-Kantianism in general (Krijnen 2001, 84). Philosophy for the Neo-Kantians is concerned with the systematic elucidation of the a priori principles that allow for valid thinking in various spheres of knowledge. In keeping with Kant\u2019s first Critique, valid thinking is not merely logically consistent thinking. Valid thinking requires, over and above the adherence to the laws of formal logic, thinking in accordance with the a priori principles governing the intelligibility of a given area of reality. These will be, for instance, the principles of causality, substantiality etc. in the sphere of physical nature and principles such as good and evil, responsibility, freedom, etc. in the sphere of ethics. It is the task of philosophy to identify these a priori principles in all the different spheres of culture, including politics, biology, art, history, etc. Helmuth Plessner captures metaphorically the spirit of Neo-Kantianism when he characterizes the Neo-Kantians as \u201cbotanists in the garden of the a priori\u201d (Plessner 1974, 185).\n\nIn their attempt to clarify the way in which we should think of such principles, both the Southwestern and the Marburg Neo-Kantians reject any kind of psychological reading, which dominated among early 19th Century interpretations of Kant. The a priori principles of valid thinking are not mere facts about human psychology; they do not describe merely how our mind happens to function. Their validity is objective, that is, it is part of the formal structure of the objects of investigation and not merely an extrinsic mental scheme that exemplars of the species homo sapiens contingently apply to them.\n\nMoreover, both schools were rather unenthusiastic about the label \u2018Neo-Kantianism\u2019. Their goal was not to go \u201cback to Kant\u201d, as Otto Liebmann (1840\u20131912) famously urged philosophers to do in his Kant und die Epigonen (Liebmann 1865), but, rather, to move forward beyond Kant building on his original views. Windelband, Rickert\u2019s mentor and the forefather of Southwestern Neo-Kantianism, pronounced: \u201cTo understand Kant means to move beyond him\u201d (Windelband 1915, IV). Likewise, the Marburg school leader Cohen pointed out: \u201cFrom the very beginning I was concerned with developing Kant\u2019s system further\u201d (Cohen 1902, VII).\n\nThe two schools, however, diverge significantly in their interpretation of Kant. While the Marburg school was predominantly interested in the Critique of Pure Reason (Cohen 1885) and considered it to be an essay in the philosophical foundation of Newtonian science (a reading that is still prominent among contemporary Kant scholars, such as Friedmann 1992), Rickert and the Southwesterners emphasized the importance of reading Kant as a whole and considered the centerpiece of his philosophical program to be the system of the faculties outlined in the introduction to the Critique of Judgment (Rickert 1924b, 167). For Rickert, in particular, already in Kant\u2019s first Critique \u201cthe focal point [\u2026] is not in the transcendental aesthetic and analytic but rather in the dialectic, and this means that the main problem of this work is not a theory of the experiential sciences (Erfahrungswissenschaften). Rather, it revolves around the old, ever-recurring problems of metaphysics. The work on these problems becomes the foundation for an encompassing theory of worldview culminating in the treatment of issues in the philosophy of religion. The theory of mathematics and physics is merely preparatory for the treatment of these issues\u201d (Rickert 1924b, 153). Rickert\u2019s Kant is primarily a philosopher of human culture at large, interested in questions about the meaning and value of our life in the world, whereas Cohen\u2019s Kant is primarily (albeit not exclusively) a philosopher of the natural sciences. Incidentally, the largely ignored influence of Rickert\u2019s Kant-interpretation is still vivid in Heidegger\u2019s acclaimed book Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics (Heidegger 1997).\n\nFrom these diverging interpretations of Kant flows another fundamental theoretical difference between the two schools. This difference has been effectively phrased by Rickert\u2019s student, Emil Lask in terms of \u201cpan-logism\u201d, attributed to the Marburg Neo-Kantians, versus the \u201cpan-archy of logos\u201d, attributed to the Southwestern Neo-Kantians (Lask 1923, 133; Crowell 2010). If we take the distinction between intuition (Anschauung) and concept (Begriff) to be the fundamental paradigm of Kantian transcendentalism, then in Lask\u2019s eyes the Marburg Neo-Kantians are committed to a kind of \u2018pan-logism\u2019 to the extent that they tend to minimize the role of intuition. As is particularly evident, for instance, in Natorp (1911, 26\u201367), for the Marburg Neo-Kantians whatever we might be tempted to consider a pure given or a raw datum of experience can be analyzed into an underlying thought-process, whereby the given is actually constructed according to a conceptually articulable (i.e., logical) pattern. Every alleged pure given (Gegebenes) is actually a task (Aufgegebenes) for conceptual thinking and can be resolved into an underlying thought process governed by logical a priori principles.\n\nBy contrast, Rickert and the Southwestern Neo-Kantians emphasize the ultimate irreducibility of what is given in intuition to conceptual forms. While everything can be grasped by concepts, and therefore no domain of reality and cultural life eludes in principle conceptual mastery (pan-archy), nothing can be grasped exhaustively by concepts, and therefore our rationality has to constantly take into account an irrational residue intrinsic to every conceptual construction. To conceptualize, for Rickert, is to recast the materials delivered immediately by the senses into a conceptual form. In so doing, we necessarily have to be selective, that is, we have to leave out of consideration an overwhelming amount of elements and take up in our conceptuality only those elements that match the criteria originally established for the purpose of solving our theoretical task. To give a simple example, in order to conceptualize, say, linear motion we have to isolate from the overwhelming amount of data stemming from the senses only those features that pertain to the movement of bodies (spatial location, speed, reciprocal position, etc.) and leave out of consideration everything else. This general characterization can serve as a prelude to Rickert\u2019s theory of knowledge, which is the theme of the next section.\n\nFor us, epistemology has become a matter of good conscience, and we will not be prepared to listen to anyone who fails to justify his ideas on this basis. (Rickert 1986, 21)\n\nFor Rickert epistemology or Erkenntnistheorie (\u2018theory of knowledge\u2019) has to be the point of departure and the systematic foundation of philosophy as a whole. He often uses interchangeably the words \u201clogic\u201d (Logik), \u201ctheory of knowledge\u201d (Erkenntnistheorie), \u201cmethodology\u201d (Methodologie), \u201ctheory of truth\u201d (Wahrheitslehre) and \u201ctheory of science\u201d (Wissenschaftslehre). (See for instance Rickert 1986, 19; Rickert 1909, 170.) This is because ultimately all these phrases refer to one and the same problem, i.e., the problem of the validity of thought and the principles on which valid thought rests. Erkenntnistheorie, therefore, is his preferred phrase because it makes this fundamental problem most explicit.\n\nRickert\u2019s theory of knowledge is designed to answer the following question: \u201cwhat is the subject-independent yardstick of knowledge? In other words, through what does knowledge receive its objectivity?\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 1) Or, following the title of his major work in the theory of knowledge, what is the object of knowledge? In asking this question Rickert is explicitly setting up a transcendental argument that can be summarized as follow: given that (1) there is knowledge and that (2) knowledge as true thought can be contrasted to mere thought in that it grasps some thought-independent object, how are we to think this thought-independent object? (Rickert 1909, 170) Therefore Rickert rejects the idea that the theory of knowledge should somehow respond to skepticism (Rickert 1921a, 7; Rickert 1909, 174). To the extent that skepticism negates the very possibility of knowledge it cannot be meaningfully addressed in a theory that sets out to determine precisely what knowledge is. Nonetheless Rickert believes that a modified version of skeptical doubt, which he compares to Husserl\u2019s epoch\u00e9 (Rickert 1921a, 12), is beneficial to the theory of knowledge. The theory of knowledge cannot begin without some presuppositions, in particular, that there are true thoughts in which a subject successfully grasps an object. \u201cHowever, the theory of knowledge ought to be \u2018presuppositionless\u2019 in the sense that it ought to limit as much as possible the presuppositions upon which the objectivity of knowledge rests\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 12). It is through the exercise of doubt that we get to raise the key question as to whether we necessarily have to posit a transcendent reality existing independently of consciousness as the source of validation for knowledge. The pursuit of the object of knowledge, then, leads straight to the problem of transcendence and its relation to the knowing subject. Note that Rickert is not questioning one of the inescapable assumptions of any theory of knowledge, namely, that there has to be some subject-independent yardstick or criterion that validates knowledge. He is questioning whether this subject-independent criterion has to be understood as a transcendent reality, for instance, a world of mind-independent and presumably physical things in themselves. His conclusion will be precisely that this transcendent criterion cannot be meaningfully conceived of as a reality and that only values can be considered genuinely transcendent.\n\nRickert argues that we can tackle the problem of the theory of knowledge in two ways: \u201cOne can begin first with an analysis of the real act of knowledge as a psychic process and then, from there, move progressively to determine the transcendent object. Secondly, one can attempt to reach as quickly as possible the sphere of the transcendent object and deal with it in a purely \u2018logical\u2019 fashion without considering the psychic act of knowing\u201d (Rickert 1909, 174). He labels these two approaches the \u201ctranscendental-psychological\u201d (or subjective) and the \u201ctranscendental-logical\u201d (or objective) ways (Rickert 1909, 174). While in the first editions of The Object of Knowledge Rickert privileged the transcendental-psychological way, in the early 1900s he introduced the transcendental-logical way and incorporated it into later editions of the book, arguing that the two ways should be considered complementary.\n\nThe most important move at the beginning of the subjective way is to determine the notions of subject and object that the theory of knowledge can legitimately operate with, and, in particular to characterize \u201cthe epistemological subject\u201d (das erkenntnistheoretische Subjekt) (Rickert 1921a, 41). Rickert examines three different subject/object dichotomies. (1) We can define the object in spatial terms as what is out there in the world. This is what the expression \u2018external world\u2019 seems to refer to. Correspondingly, the subject, too, will be defined in spatial terms as the animated body, for which there are spatial surroundings populated by objects. The first dichotomy construes subject and object as \u201ctwo bodies\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 14) facing each other in physical space. (2) We can construe a second dichotomy, in which we take our body, too, to be an object like other objects and consider \u2018subject\u2019 to refer exclusively to consciousness. \u201cIn this second case my consciousness and its content are the subject, and therefore the object is everything that is not my content of consciousness or my consciousness itself\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 15). This second dichotomy captures the traditional distinction between immanence and transcendence. (3) A third dichotomy ensues from a further distinction that we can carry out within the sphere of immanence, that is, the distinction between the ego and its representations, or between any content of consciousness and consciousness itself. In this third case representations, perceptions, feelings, emotions etc. would be the object and the subject would be the ego standing over against them.\n\nBased on these dichotomies, it seems that the problem of transcendence and its possible denial only pertains to (2). It would not make sense to question the transcendence of the object if by object we mean what occupies the spatial surroundings of a psychophysical human subject and, similarly, it would not make sense to deny the transcendence of our representations, perceptions, emotions etc. from the point of view of the pure ego-subject undergoing such representations, perceptions, emotions, etc. Following the subjective way, we should then set out to determine whether we necessarily have to posit the existence of transcendent objects independent from the contents of our consciousness. We should, it seems, assume what the positivists have called \u201cthe standpoint of immanence\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 21) and see if there is some rationally justifiable way to infer our way out of it.\n\nThis conception however, is misleading and if we took it as our point of departure it would put the whole enterprise of the theory of knowledge in jeopardy. Who or what is the subject, for which the problem of transcendence can be meaningfully posed? Rickert indicates that the three concepts of subject considered above ought to be seen in their mutual relations. If we begin with the psychophysical subject in (1), we can obtain the notion of subject in (2) by way of a progressive \u2018objectification\u2019 of the body (Rickert 1921a, 35). I can progressively consider each part of my body as itself an \u2018object\u2019 or content of my consciousness and once the whole body has been \u2018purged out\u2019 the result will be a purely psychic subject, which Rickert defines as \u201cthe limit concept (Grenzbegriff) of the series, in which the physical component in the subject becomes progressively smaller\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 36). In a similar way, we can continue the process of \u2018de-objectification\u2019 of the subject and consider each and every mental state as itself an object for an absolutely non-objective and non-objectifiable ego. In this way we reach the authentic epistemological subject, the identical \u201csubject-factor\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 42) that provides the form \u2018subjectivity\u2019 to every possible content of consciousness. Following Kant\u2019s terminology Rickert designates the epistemological subject \u201cconsciousness in general\u201d, that is, a \u201cnameless, generic, impersonal consciousness\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 42). This consciousness in general has to be distinguished sharply not only from the individual psychophysical human subject but also from the individual psychic subject with its empirical mental states.\n\nRickert insists: \u201cThe question regarding immanence or transcendence only makes epistemological sense with respect to the epistemological subject or consciousness in general\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 43). From this perspective, \u201cto be immanent means nothing but to carry the form of being-conscious (Bewu\u00dftheit) and to be transcendent means to really exist without such form\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 48). Given these definitions, Rickert contends that while there are many good reasons to reject psychological idealism, if one holds fast to consciousness in general there is no good reason to posit the existence of a transcendent reality beyond the sphere encompassed by the epistemological subject. His theory of knowledge is therefore committed to transcendental idealism. In order to defend this point Rickert examines three types of arguments that have been traditionally played out against transcendental idealism as defenses of the necessity to posit a transcendent reality: (1) transcendence as the unexperienced cause of conscious experiences (Rickert 1921a, 62\u201373); (2) transcendence as necessary in order to fill the gaps in our conscious experiences (Rickert 1921a, 74\u201384); (3) transcendence as the objective counterpart of our will, that is, as the correlate of the experience of a resistance and constraint to our willful actions (Rickert 1921a, 84\u201393). All these arguments, however, only show that we cannot reduce reality to psychic existence. In other words, they are good arguments only against a psychological idealism \u00e0 la Berkeley according to which reality would coincide with our empirical mental states. From the point of view of the epistemological subject, however, both psychic and physical occurrences are objects whose reality is encompassed by the form \u2018consciousness in general\u2019. A transcendental idealist, then, emphatically agrees that there is an extra-mental physical reality causing the occurrence of mental states in empirical subjects. To the extent that they are experienced or experienceable, however, both extra-mental (physical things) and intra-mental realities (mental states) have to be seen as content of consciousness, namely, of transcendental consciousness in general. It is important to remember that by \u2018consciousness in general\u2019 Rickert means no individual psychic subject but the general form of subjective accessibility. In other words, to say that all reality is a content of consciousness does not mean that all reality is psychic. It means that all reality (both psychic and physical) is encompassed by a general form of subjectivity, which makes it available for theoretical determination. Commenting on his own brand of transcendental idealism, Rickert states: \u201cour standpoint is the true realism\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 104), in that it refuses to counterpose an immanent psychic reality to an inaccessible transcendent reality to be posited via inferential reasoning. Rickert insists that transcendental idealism considers real precisely the reality that we encounter in everyday life through sensory experience, consisting of immediately aware psychic and physical occurrences. What it rejects is that this reality can be meaningfully construed as transcendent vis-\u00e0-vis consciousness in general.\n\nThe reason why one might be prone to reject transcendental idealism is a wrong conception of what knowledge really is all about. Rickert labels this conception the copy-theory or pictorial theory (Abbildtheorie) of knowledge. According to this conception, \u201cthe act of knowing has to depict (abbilden) a reality independent from its activity of representing (vorstellen)\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 119). The rejection of a pictorial theory of cognition and the ensuing intuitionism (according to which to know is merely to intuit some mind-independent real or noetic object), remains a constant in Rickert\u2019s philosophy (see Rickert 1934a; Staiti 2013a). It also connects Rickert with other Neo-Kantians, including Natorp and Cassirer in Marburg, who likewise reject the notion that knowledge is a merely picturing representation of the object (see Holzey 2010; Kubalica 2013).\n\nIn order to expose the untenable notions in the pictorial theory of knowledge Rickert introduces a distinction between the form and the content of cognition. While nothing is wrong with the idea that in order to have knowledge we have to take up in some representations some content, what distinguishes knowledge from other kinds of representation must be sought in its form. If I say of a piece of paper that it is white, then certainly \u201cmy representation reproduces what is real with respect to the white, and this is why the statement is true\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 125). However, this is not all. \u201cIn the statement at issue (this piece of paper is white), in fact, not only is the being-white asserted alongside the being-white, but rather, the white as \u2018property\u2019 is also attributed to a \u2018thing\u2019, and, in so being, the being-white is determined more specifically. Thing and property, however, are, as much as being and reality, concepts that do not belong in the content of knowledge. One has to know beforehand what it means epistemologically that a \u2018thing\u2019 has a \u2018property\u2019 and what the objectivity of this piece of knowledge rests upon in order to be able to say: \u2018the thought: this piece of paper is white grasps what is real through pictorial representations\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 125\u2013126; Rickert 1909, 177). The theorist of knowledge cannot overlook the gulf that exists between the pre-discursive perceptual experience of seeing a white piece of paper and the articulation of the true judgment \u2018this piece of paper is white\u2019. The judgment does not merely mirror or depict perceptual reality. Rather, the judgment transforms and reshapes the perceptual material delivered by the senses by way casting it into a new form, whose legitimacy does not rest in the faithful depiction of the perceptual scene but in the logical validity of such forms. The problem of the pictorial theory of cognition is that it \u201cignores the form\u201d (Rickert 1909, 178).\n\nThese considerations lead to one of the key theses in Rickert\u2019s theory of knowledge: \u201cThe fundamental problem of the theory of knowledge is the question regarding the yardstick or the object of judging (Rickert 1921a, 131\u2013132). The epistemological subject is not merely a representational subject, but rather a judging subject. Judgment is for Rickert the place where the standpoint of immanence is necessarily broken and the genuine meaning of transcendence becomes manifest. In his analysis of judgment Rickert draws a sharp distinction between the psychological act of judging and the content (Gehalt) of a judgment, which parallels Husserl\u2019s treatment of the same issue in Logical Investigations (Husserl 1973). While the act of judging, say, that 2 + 2 = 4 is a psychic occurrence unfolding in time and differing for each empirical subject making this judgment, the objective content grasped by this act, the true relation 2 + 2 = 4 is timelessly valid and it is one over and against the many psychic acts directed towards it. Moreover, if by real we mean either a psychic or a physical entity, then the content of the judgment 2 + 2 = 4 has to be deemed \u201cunreal\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 145). Taking notice of the objective content of an act and reflecting back on the psychological act of judging that intends such content we also have to highlight a third component of a judgment, which Rickert labels \u201cimmanent sense\u201d of the act (Rickert 1921a, 145), i.e. that which orients the act towards the judged content. As one commentator puts it: \u201cthe immanent sense of the judgment stands in an intermediate position between the real psychic act and the unreal logical content\u201d (Oliva 2006, 97). It is the function (Leistung) performed by the psychic act seen purely and exclusively in its functionality of connecting psychological subjectivity and logical objectivity. Determining what kind of immanent function characterizes judgments and how this function sets them apart from other kinds of psychic occurrences is Rickert\u2019s next step.\n\nIn order to grasp the epistemological essence of judgment and its relation to the fundamental epistemological problem of transcendence we have to describe its difference from a mere representation or string of representations. The best way to characterize the specific essence of judgment is by \u201cconsidering the judgment the answer to a question\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 153). Rickert thus identifies the essence of judgment is thus in the function of \u201caffirmation or negation\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 154), thereby following a trend in logic that dates back to Brentano (see Brentano 1995, 194\u2013234). If we consider exclusively the representational content, the judgment, \u201cthis paper is white\u201d, and the question, \u201cis this paper white?\u201d do not differ in the slightest. The same representational elements are there in a meaningful connection. The genuine performance of judgment, for Rickert, is all contained in the \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 that we could answer to the question, thereby taking a stance with regards to the represented content. In fact, what distinguishes judgment from all sorts of representations is the moment of \u2018stance-taking\u2019 (Stellungnehmen) expressed by the words \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019. Judging should then be considered a \u201cpractical comportment (Verhalten)\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 165), in which something is acknowledged as true or rejected as false. In this regard, judging has to be considered an \u201cact of valuing\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 165). What is it, however, that elicits from the epistemological subject an act of stance-taking? Rickert explains: \u201cWith our act of affirming we can only orient ourselves toward requirements (Forderungen), only vis-\u00e0-vis a requirement can we comport ourselves in an endorsing fashion. In this way we have obtained the broadest concept for the object of knowledge. What is known, that is, what is affirmed or acknowledged in the act of judgment must be located in the sphere of the \u2018ought\u2019 (Sollen)\u201d (Rickert 1909, 184). This is the kind of transcendence that Rickert set out to determine at the beginning. The object of knowledge has to be conceived as transcendent, however, not as a transcendent reality mirrored by a psychological act of representation but as a \u201ctranscendent ought\u201d (Rickert 1909, 187). This prompts the theoretically oriented subject to affirm the transcendent theoretical value of truth in the necessary connection existing between the form and the content expressed in a true judgment.\n\nExamining retrospectively the results of this first subjective path of the theory of knowledge Rickert points out a number of shortcomings. It seems that if we begin with an analysis of the act of judging, we can only reach the transcendent object of knowledge by way of a \u201cpetitio principii\u201d (Rickert 1909, 190). If we take our cues from the psychologically perceived \u201cfeeling of a requirement\u201d (Forderungsgef\u00fchl) and from the evidence of the judged content as the \u201cimmanent indicator of the transcendent\u201d (Rickert 1909, 189), we have no sufficient reason to posit a transcendent object of knowledge unless we somehow already presupposed it in the very analysis of this feeling and its psychological connotations. It seems that the only conclusion we could legitimately draw without falling into circular reasoning is that when a certain compelling feeling of evidence occurs, we feel the urge to affirm the truth of a certain connection between a form and a content. But this does not really amount to proving that the internally felt sense of ought is connected to a transcendent ought. Rickert considers petitio principii inherent in the subjective path to be problematic but nonetheless a useful starting point, in that it allows us to analyze the meaning of certain fundamental concepts of the theory of knowledge such as transcendence, ought, stance-taking and recognition. However, in order to have a complete theory of knowledge, an objective or transcendental-logical path has to be taken.\n\nActs of judgments are not the only kinds of realities to which truth or falsehood attach. Propositions can also be true or false and their meanings can be taken as a new point of departure for the sake of determining the transcendent object of knowledge avoiding a petitio principii (Rickert 1909, 197). The meaning of a proposition can be taken objectively and independently of empirical acts of thought. In this case, we can say of the proposition itself that is either true or false, without thereby referring to the feeling of evidence or necessity perceived by the subject of judgment. In propositional logic we are accustomed to assign a truth-value to a given proposition and in so doing we think of the truth-value as pertaining to the proposition itself and not to the immanent psychological act that affirms the proposition\u2019s truth. This is the advantage of the objective path over the subjective path: \u201cThe subjective path led us to the object as a requirement (Forderung) and this requirement was then interpreted as a transcendent ought. The objective path leads us directly to a transcendent value, and this concept yields the form of the object in its purity for the first time. Value and ought do not coincide. The ought is not the pure value. It represents the unreal as a command and relates it to a subject from which it demands obedience, recognition and submission. This is a secondary and even misleading addition. Only the value which rests upon itself and holds valid as value [\u2026] is the transcendent object\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 242).\n\nRickert considers the concept of transcendent value (as pure validity independent of subjective acts of valuing) the culmination of his theory of knowledge. It is ultimately the theoretical value of truth, the unreal transcendent object, that is \u2018known\u2019 or grasped in every act of true judgment. However, this does not imply a complete rejection or neglect of the valuing subjectivity. Rickert maintains that once the theory of knowledge has established the absolute transcendence of values and their independence from empirical acts of valuing, it is then possible to relate values back to subjectivity. As we know, the immanent sense of acts (Aktsinn) is the unreal component of acts that mediates between the empirical sphere of psyche and the unreal sphere of values. Subjectivity is then interpreted as the \u2018middle\u2019 factor capable of mediating between reality and value, and thereby it receives its philosophical \u2018dignification\u2019. It is fair to say that Rickert\u2019s work in all other fields of philosophy and in particular in the theory of the empirical sciences is an attempt to reconstruct the meaning of various spheres of reality and knowledge from his fundamental insight into the transcendence of values. See also the\n\nSupplement on Rickert\u2019s Philosophy of Mathematics\n\nEmpirical reality becomes nature when we conceive it with reference to the general. It becomes history when we conceive it with reference to the distinctive and the individual. (Rickert 1986, 54)\n\nRickert\u2019s theory of science is primarily geared towards a philosophical elucidation of the natural and the historical sciences. This is intended to provide a defense of the sui generis scientificity of the historical sciences against the threat of positivism and naturalism. Rickert\u2019s work on this issue builds upon Windelband\u2019s influential paper History and Natural Science (Windelband 1980, 169\u2013185). While Rickert criticizes some terminological and argumentative limits of his teacher\u2019s essay, the bulk of his lengthy volume, The Limits of Concept Formation in Natural Science: An Introduction to the Historical Sciences (Rickert 1986), is consistent with the tenets of Windelband\u2019s position.\n\nWindelband pointed out that the customary distinction of the empirical sciences into natural sciences and Geisteswissenschaften (that is, literally spiritual or mental sciences and used in German to indicate the humanities and the social sciences) is deeply misleading (Windelband 1980, 173). This is because it seems to suggest that these two groups of sciences differ primarily with respect to their subject matter, that is, in the first case \u2018nature\u2019 and in the second case \u2018mind\u2019. However, there are at least two problems with this classification: (1) a significant number of disciplines commonly considered Geisteswissenschaften have little or nothing to do with the study of the human mind. Take, for instance, art history, political economics or archeology. None of these disciplines seems to have mental processes and states as their subject matter. (2) According to this classification psychology should be considered a Geisteswissenschaft and presumably even the most fundamental of all Geisteswissenschaften in that it studies the human mind in the most direct and rigorous fashion. Indeed, in late nineteenth century Germany there was a widely spread expectation that progress in psychology should have led to significant reforms in all other humanistic fields of research. This expectation, however, clashes with the fact that psychology\u2019s method is much more similar to that of physics, chemistry, and biology than with that of literary studies or musicology. Psychology, too, seeks to determine its subject matter in terms of general laws and works with the aid of mathematical models and experiments. Considering these anomalies Windelband\u2019s proposal is to drop content-related distinctions altogether and rely exclusively on a methodological distinction between \u201cnomothetic\u201d and \u201cidiographic\u201d sciences (Windelband 1980, 175). One group of sciences works by way of positing general laws and understanding its objects as examples of such general laws (nomo-thetic). Another group of sciences aims at producing illuminating descriptions of irreducibly individual and unrepeatable occurrences (idiographic). Most importantly, \u201cthe same subjects can be the object of both a nomothetic and an idiographic investigation\u201d (Windelband 1980, 175). From this purely methodological point of view, sciences like psychology, physics, chemistry, and biology all belong in the same group as nomothetic, whereas sciences like history, art history, and musicology are to be considered idiographic. This distinction is meant to reorganize the universe of knowledge and to avoid unhelpful encroachments of empirical psychology on the work of humanistic disciplines, whose theoretical aims are fundamentally alien to nomothetic inquiry.\n\nRickert enhances and corrects Windelband\u2019s perspective in two ways: (1) He revises his terminology and rejects the phrase \u2018idiographic\u2019, which seems to suggest a purely pictorial or reproductive procedure. This would not qualify as knowledge by Rickert\u2019s epistemological standards (see Zijderveld 2006, 246\u2013255; Ferrari 1998). (2) He insists on the necessity of beginning a reflection on the classification of the sciences with a purely methodological criterion, but only to articulate subsequently a more adequate content-related distinction to replace the customary Naturwissenschaft/Geisteswissenschaft pair (Rickert 1962, 11).\n\nRickert defines the task of a logical/methodological investigation of the sciences in the following terms: \u201cThe logical distinctiveness of an empirical science is to be understood in terms of the relationship the content of its concepts bears to empirical reality in its unique and distinctive form\u201d (Rickert 1986, 114). In other words, the task of a theory of science is to determine how the science under scrutiny forms its concepts and in so doing overcomes the unsurveyable, \u201cimmeasurable manifold\u201d (Rickert 1962, 32) of empirical reality as it is given in intuition. Concept formation for Rickert indicates \u201cthe conclusion of an investigation\u201d (Rickert 1986, 27), that is the fulfillment of the scientific task posed at the beginning of that investigation. In keeping with his general rejection of a pictorial theory of knowledge (see above), Rickert rejects the view that the empirical sciences would simply have to depict (abbilden) reality as it is in itself. Rather, the task of the empirical sciences is to re-mold (umbilden) immediately given reality and form concepts, in which only a small fraction of the original given is taken up. The criteria for such selections and re-molding activities culminating in the formation of a scientific concept are the specific preoccupation of the philosophy of science.\n\nAs for the natural sciences, Rickert contends that Kant already provided a satisfactory definition of their logical structure. In the Prolegomena Kant stated: \u201cNature is the existence of things, insofar as [sofern] that existence is determined according to universal laws\u201d (Kant 2002, 89; Rickert 1962, 5). Following Kant, Rickert defines the natural sciences as generalizing (Rickert 1986, 34; Rickert 1962, 46), that is, they form their concepts by way of moving away from the individual, unrepeatable occurrences encountered in experience. As Windelband already saw, the natural sciences view individual occurrences as mere examples of general laws. In this way, individuality \u201cfixes the limits of natural scientific concept formation\u201d (Rickert 1986, 40) and calls forth its logical complement: \u201cindividualizing concept-formation\u201d (Rickert 1986, 62) as the method defining the historical sciences. The logical distinction between the sciences, then, has to be between the generalizing natural sciences and the individualizing historical sciences. In other words, while the natural sciences build their concepts by way of disregarding what is individual, the historical sciences build their concepts in order to grasp precisely what is individual.\n\nHow are we to understand, then, historical individuality? Rickert\u2019s definition unfolds in three stages (Rickert 1986, 98). (1) In the broadest sense, the individual is every single empirical reality in its uniqueness and distinctiveness. This, however, is not yet historically relevant individuality. (2) In a more specific and etymological sense, a historical individual is what \u201cshould not be divided\u201d (Rickert 1986, 85), that is, it is an individual whose \u201cuniqueness is related to a value\u201d (Rickert 1986, 84). Rickert suggests to compare a lump of coal and the famous Koh-i-noor diamond. While the lump of coal can be split at any time without any significant loss, the Koh-i-noor ought not be spilt because it is a good, that is, a bit of reality related to a value and valued by any subject capable of carrying out valuations. (3) The historical individual as the object of the historical sciences has to be a good related to generally acknowledged values as opposed to merely personal values. In other words, while a certain item can be valuable to me as an individual (for instance, because a beloved person gave it to me), this is not enough to make it an object of historical interest. The Koh-i-noor, on the contrary, has a more than merely individual historical relevance because it is inextricably related to the historical vicissitudes of India and British colonialism.\n\nThe notions of value and value-relatedness are crucial to determine Rickert\u2019s material or content-related (inhaltlich) criterion for the demarcation of the sciences. In this respect we have to distinguish between the value-free sphere of nature and the value-related sphere of culture (Rickert 1962, 21). Accordingly, the material distinction that has to replace the customary distinction between natural sciences and Geisteswissenschaften is the distinction between the sciences of nature (value-free objects) and the sciences of culture (value-related objects). It is the reference to objectively acknowledged cultural values that \u2018preserves\u2019 the individuality of empirical objects and makes them relevant to historical inquiry.\n\nIn the context of this distinction Rickert insists on the important distinction between Wertung, or valuation, and Wertbeziehung, or the act of relating something to a value. The two notions stand in sharp opposition. While human subjects in their practical lives constantly engage in valuations resulting in positive or negative value-judgments, the historical scientist must abstain from every act of valuation and limit herself to the ascertainment of objective value-relations in the cultural materials under scrutiny. \u201cAccordingly, if it is to express the character of history as a theoretical science, the procedure that we speak of as oriented to values is to be most sharply separated from one that posits values. This means that history treats values only in so far as they are actually accepted by subjects so that certain objects are actually denoted as goods. Thus, even if history deals with values, it is not a science that posits values\u201d (Rickert 1962, 89). Rickert gives the following example to illustrate this distinction: \u201cWe can regard the personality of Luther as either a good thing or a bad thing. In other words, we can believe that it was a stroke of luck for the cultural development of Germany or that it brought misfortune. On this point, the opinions of historians will probably always be in disagreement. But no one who knows the facts will doubt that Luther had some sort of significance with reference to generally acknowledged values, and it can never occur to a historian to claim that Luther\u2019s personality is historically unimportant\u201d (Rickert 1986, 93; for a critical response to this view see Oakes 1988, 111\u2013144).\n\nBy contrasting the generalizing method of the natural sciences dealing with value-free objects and the individualizing (i.e., historical) method of the cultural sciences dealing with value-related objects, Rickert does not mean to say that values play no role in the natural sciences or that generalizing procedures and general objects are completely absent form the cultural sciences. On the contrary, he emphasizes that \u201cnatural science is not free of valuations\u201d (Rickert 1986, 93). In a way that anticipates much late twentieth century philosophy of science (see for instance Laudan 1985; Lacey 1999; Allchin 1999) Rickert insists that natural science and, for that matter, science in general obeys \u201clogical values to which the investigator is committed, and which are implicitly presupposed in all scientific concept formation\u201d (Rickert 1986, 94). What remains \u2018value-free\u2019 is the material that the natural sciences investigate. To stay with the above example, for a mineralogist studying diamonds the Koh-i-noor will be merely an instance of some general law of crystallization as much as any other diamond. It is not considered in its relation to culturally acknowledged values. On the other hand, the historical sciences do not completely dispense with elements of generality. Rickert identifies four senses in which \u2018the general\u2019 is at play in historical research. \u201cFirst, the elements of all scientific concepts are general\u201d (Rickert 1986, 115). This means that, for example, in order to form the concept \u2018French Revolution\u2019 we have to use general concepts such as \u2018French\u2019 and \u2018revolution\u2019. However, these two general concepts are compounded in order to capture a unique historical event. In a second sense, as we saw, history has to take into account the relation of events and objects to general values. However, the fact that a certain object has a reference to a general value (e.g. the French Revolution bears a reference to the general value \u2018political freedom\u2019) does not make the concept of that object general. \u201cThird, historical science never regards individuals in isolation, as the generalizing sciences do, but in a general nexus\u201d (Rickert 1986, 115). We cannot understand the individual Robespierre unless we view his actions in the meaningful general context of the French Revolution. Such \u2018nexus\u2019, however, is not itself a general concept but is itself an \u2018individual\u2019, that is, a unique and unrepeatable constellation of events. Fourth, in some cases the historical scientist will deliberately study groups of individuals, say, late-medieval serfs in Holland. In this case single individuals (either people or objects) will be seen as mere examples of dynamics and characteristics pertaining to their group in a way that seems to resemble the generalizing procedure of natural science. However, even in this case the historian is not interested in the \u2018general nature\u2019 of human groups but in the individuality of the group at issue.\n\nRickert engaged in a lifelong controversy with another prominent theorist of the human sciences, Wilhelm Dilthey (on the controversy see Makkreel/Luft 2010 and Makkreel 2010). Dilthey advocated the necessity to maintain a primarily content-related distinction to demarcate different ambits of science and he defended the legitimacy of the phrase Geisteswissenschaft. Dilthey rejected the argument that psychology could not be foundational for the human sciences because of its methodological similarity to the natural sciences. He considered the empirical (or, in his language, explanative) psychology of his time to be deeply flawed in that it imitated the methods of the natural sciences without paying attention to the specificity of the mental domain (Dilthey 2010, 119). Psychology, for Dilthey, should be conducted in a descriptive-analytical spirit, starting off from the overall meaningfulness and intelligibility of mental phenomena and working to describe the intricate connections or nexuses of significance characterizing human life (Dilthey 2010, 182). \u201cSuch a psychology will become the foundation of the human sciences, just as mathematics grounds the natural sciences\u201d (Dilthey 2010, 165). This is because, for Dilthey, all the products of culture studied by the human sciences are nothing but \u201cpsychic life that has become objective, [\u2026] the products of active forces of a psychic nature and stable configurations formed from psychic elements and their laws\u201d (Dilthey 2010, 171). For this reason, Dilthey contends that in the human sciences we can only understand, as opposed to explain, (Dilthey 2010, 119) cultural products (poems, artworks, juridical systems, etc.) to the extent that we reactivate the psychic life at their origin and relive (nacherleben) the life-experience that brought them about. If we had theoretical tools provided by a descriptive psychology to orient ourselves in the complexity of psychic objectifications, we would make significant advancements in the human sciences, too.\n\nRickert is willing to grant the \u201cparamount significance of mental beings within the historical material\u201d (Rickert 1986, 123) and the importance of \u201chistorical personalities that valuate\u201d (Rickert 1986, 122) for the cultural sciences. He is also open to the use of Geist, provided that this term is considered synonymous with culture. However, he insists that Dilthey\u2019s emphasis on psychic life and reliving is both systematically and methodologically misleading. First, not all of psychic life is relevant in the cultural sciences. Most psychic manifestations, both those occurring in individuals and those objectified in cultural objects, are completely devoid of historical significance, in that they lack the reference to a general value. Second, even if we had the capacity to relive past experiences in their total intensity and vividness, this would not amount to understanding those experiences and their cultural objectifications. In the historical sciences, too, to know does not mean merely to mirror or depict a real object. Only if the notion of value and the objective value-relatedness of historical individuals (be they physical or psychic) are taken as the systematic point of departure can the subjectivity involved in history be adequately understood. \u201cThe fact that history is a science of mental entities does not determine its logical structure, for mental processes can also be represented in a natural scientific or generalizing fashion. Rather, the converse is true: On the basis of the logical structure of historical science [\u2026] it can be understood why history primarily takes a certain kind of mental life as the object of its investigation\u201d (Rickert 1986, 127).\n\nRickert\u2019s theory of generalizing and individualizing concept formation as the systematically fundamental criterion for the demarcation of science elicited other waves of criticism. Husserl, for example, considered it an oversimplification of the Kantian problem of the transcendental deduction in that Rickert simply takes for granted that the infinite, unsurveyable manifold of immediate experience is amenable to conceptualization (Husserl 2001, 91). However, given his premises it is hard to see why a completely chaotic and heterogeneous immediate experience would nonetheless lend itself to conceptual rationalization. The problem, according to Husserl, is that for Rickert \u201cworld-experience (Welterfahrung) remains an empty word\u201d (Husserl 2001, 100). Moreover, and similarly to Dilthey, Husserl laments the fact that Rickert downplays historically active subjectivity as the source of culture. Like Rickert, Husserl distinguishes between nature and culture in terms of \u201cthe world considered without significance\u201d as opposed to \u201cthe world full of significance\u201d (Husserl 2002, 139), however, he immediately relates back such significance to the operations of \u201cmeaning-bestowing subjectivity, which endows things with spiritual meaning [vergeistigen] through operations of significance [Bedeutungsleistungen]\u201d (Husserl 2002, 140). For this reason, Husserl considers the whole dispute about whether the correct pair of concepts to demarcate the ambits of science should be nature/Geist (Dilthey) or nature/culture (Rickert) \u201ca mere verbal dispute\u201d (Husserl 2002, 140). Another line of criticism of Rickert\u2019s distinction comes from his student, Emil Lask. In his personal notes Lask forcefully asserts that \u201ca purely logical meaning of nature must be absolutely denied\u201d (Lask 1924, 272). Lask argues that in Rickert\u2019s reconstruction natural-scientific generalization and historical individualization are treated as equally legitimate and complementary ways of conceptualizing empirical reality. Against this view Lask contends that the generalizations carried out by the natural sciences presuppose a preliminary \u2018devitalization\u2019 (Ert\u00f6tung) and \u2018quantification\u2019 of reality, in which the dimension of significance and value is put out of play (Lask 1924, 244). In a way that anticipates Husserl\u2019s later treatment of this issue in The Crisis of the European Sciences (Husserl 1970). Lask points out that our original experience of the world is pervaded with value and significance and it is only by way of an abstractive impoverishment of this original experience that the natural sciences create their value-free (and to that extent artificial) field of research. As a matter of fact, however, there is evidence that Rickert was well aware of the quantifying tendency of natural science (see for instance Rickert 1900, 76), although he did not assign to it a central role.\n\nFundamental progress in the cultural sciences with respect to their objectivity, their universality, and their arrangement in a coherent system, is dependent on progress in the development of an objective and systematically articulated concept of culture, i.e., on the approach to a knowledge of value based on a system of valid values. (Rickert 1962, 139\u2013140)\n\nWhile Rickert does not believe that significant progress in the historical sciences of culture can be expected from the development of psychology, he believes that a philosophy of history grounded in an unconditionally valid system of values (Rickert 1924a, 118) would be of paramount importance. If philosophy were able to identify and justify a formal set of values common to all cultures and historical constellations, then the historical sciences could employ such a formal set of values to orient their inquiries. In order to do this, however, philosophy cannot simply rely on empirical generalizations. Given the multiplicity of cultures and the complexity of human history, it would be impossible to adopt a generalizing procedure in order to identify a robust set of values common to all. \u201cRather, it would be appropriate to reflect (completely independently of the multiplicity of the historical material) on that which holds valid by necessity, that is, the formal presupposition of each value-judgment claiming more than individual validity. Only when such timelessly valid formal values are found will it be possible to relate them to the plenitude of empirically detectable values actually developed in history\u201d (Rickert 1924a, 118). Rickert underscores in various places that such system, however, should be understood as completely \u201copen\u201d (Rickert 1913, 297; Rickert 1921b, 348\u2013355; see Bohlken 2002, 124). This means that it is intended to provide merely the \u201cmost encompassing framework in which all meaningful cultural life plays itself out\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 225). The areas of values identified in the system can be filled with the most diverse concrete historical values.\n\nRickert\u2019s first attempt to articulate a timelessly valid system of values can be found in his paper On the System of Values (Rickert 1913). The position developed here was eventually recast and schematized visually in the first (and only) volume of his System of Philosophy (Rickert 1921b). Rickert begins his inquiry by describing different kinds of goods, that is, concrete objects related to values. His intent is to read off the objectively valid values from concrete classes of goods. The human creation of goods related to values follows a general impulse towards \u201ccompletion\u201d (Vollendung), which can be best described as the attainment of a certain goal. Moreover, each realization of values in a good can be understood as the work on a certain \u2018content\u2019, which receives a value-related form. Such content can be interpreted as a whole consisting of parts. Starting from these abstract distinctions, Rickert identifies three domains of goods, that of the \u201cuncompletable (unendlich) totality\u201d, that of \u201cfully completed (voll-endlich) particularity\u201d and that which synthesizes the two in a \u201cfully completed totality\u201d (Rickert 1913, 302). To each of these domains of goods Rickert assigns a temporal dimension, such that the goods of un-ending totality are goods of the future, those of fully completed particularity are goods of the present and those of fully completed totality are goods of eternity. A further overarching distinction, however, cuts across these three domains of goods, thus giving as a result six domains: the distinction between contemplation and activity, whose parallel categories of objects are \u201cthing\u201d and \u201cperson\u201d. After fleshing out this general scheme Rickert fills in the six domains with actual values and the corresponding cultural activities according to the following schema (Rickert 1921b, annex):\n\nGoods: asocial matters (Sachen)\n\n\n\nSubjective Comportment: monistic contemplation\n\n\n\nForm: encompassing Stages of completeness Goods: social persons\n\n\n\nSubjective Comportment: pluralistic activity\n\n\n\nForm: pervading Domain of Logic (1)\n\n\n\nValue: truth\n\nGood: science\n\nSubjective Comportment: judgment\n\nWorldview: intellectualism FIRST STAGE\n\nUn-completable totality\n\nGoods of the future Domain of Ethics (4)\n\n\n\nValue: morality (Sittlichkeit)\n\nGood: community of free people\n\nSubjective Comportment: autonomous action\n\nWorldview: moralism (Moralismus) Domain of Aesthetics (2)\n\n\n\nValue: beauty\n\nGood: art\n\nSubjective Comportment: intuition (anschauen)\n\nWorldview: aestheticism SECOND STAGE\n\nFully completed particularity\n\nGoods of the present Domain of Erotics (5)\n\n\n\nValue: happiness (Gl\u00fcck)\n\nGood: loving community\n\nSubjective Comportment: inclination\u2014devotion (Hingabe)\n\nWorldview: eudaemonism System of Philosophy (8)\n\n\n\nComprehensive theory of worldviews INTERMEDIATE STAGE\n\nImmanent syntheses Love between man and woman (7)\n\n\n\nWorldview: eroticism Domain of Mystics (3)\n\n\n\nValue: impersonal sanctity\n\nGood: the All-One (world-mystery)\n\nSubjective Comportment: solitude (Abgeschiedenheit) (divinization)\n\nWorldview: Mysticism THIRD STAGE\n\nFully completed totality\n\nGoods of eternity\n\n(Transcendent syntheses) Domain of the Philosophy of Religion (6)\n\n\n\nValue: personal sanctity\n\nGood: the world of god (G\u00f6tterwelt)\n\nSubjective comportment: piety\n\nWorldview: Theism\u2014Polytheism\n\nThe following points are distinctive of Rickert\u2019s approach to values as presented in the above table:\n\n(1) Note that Rickert distinguishes the way in which values relate to their materials in the spheres of contemplation and in the sphere of practice. In his language, the value of truth \u2018encompasses\u2019 scientific theories and likewise the value of beauty encompasses works of art. This means that the value is experienced as something essentially \u2018beyond\u2019 the particular theory or artwork at issue. On the contrary, in the sphere of practice values \u2018pervade\u2019 their materials, that is to say they structure them \u2018from within\u2019, as it were.\n\n(2) Rickert prides himself on having \u2018discovered\u2019 and defended the autonomy of the fifth domain of values, which he labels \u2018erotics\u2019 (Rickert 1913, 313\u2013319). Erotics is the sphere of practical life in which subjects cultivate specific values attaching to their relationships to particular people or groups of people. According to Rickert in the philosophical tradition this autonomous domain has been unduly overshadowed by the domain of ethics, which constantly tried to impose its distinctive values on erotics (Rickert 1921b, 406). However, for Rickert our practical life would be unbearable if it were dedicated exclusively to the pursuit of ethical values and the utopian ideal of a community of free subjects (that is, Kant\u2019s kingdom of ends). We need a particular sphere of relationships in which the practical thrust of our social life finds full realization in the present. The values characterizing these spheres, such as family, homeland, religious community, etc. need to be respected and studied as a class of values in its own right.\n\n(3) Rickert assigns an important role to religion in the totality of cultural life (see Crowe 2010). He points out an inevitable tension between the pursuit of goods of totality in domains (1) and (4), which are ultimately unattainable in our earthly life, and the pursuit of goods of particularity in (2) and (5), which are fully attainable but inevitably finite. Religion opens up the space for \u2018transcendent syntheses\u2019, in which this tension is overcome through the pursuit of goods of eternity. These, in Rickert\u2019s view, do justice to both our human desire for infinity and our human need for actually experienced fulfillment. Mysticism thus offers a transcendent synthesis between the sense of fulfillment characterizing aesthetic contemplation and the unending process of scientific theorein via conceptual knowledge. Similarly, the religious devotion to a divinity experienced as \u2018dwelling among us\u2019 (in both polytheistic and monotheistic religions) promises a transcendent synthesis between the values of ethics and those of erotics.\n\n(4) For Rickert, however, the transcendent syntheses promised by religion are prefigured, as it were, in two earthly kinds of syntheses, that is, the love between man and woman in the sphere of practice and the production of a philosophical system oriented towards a comprehensive worldview-theory in the sphere of contemplation. As for the love between man and woman, Rickert\u2019s view rests on the dubious assumption that women are \u201cessentially\u201d more oriented toward the realization of goods of the present, while men are \u201cessentially\u201d more oriented toward the realization of goods of the future (Rickert 1921b, 403). Since no meaningful existence can be devoted exclusively to one type of goods (the goods of the future being ultimately unattainable and the goods of the present being ultimately too narrow), Rickert argues that the \u201cpersonal union\u201d (Rickert 1921b, 402) between man and woman amounts to a mutual completion and a synthesis of the two domains of values. Needless to say, to a contemporary reader this view sounds extremely antiquated and even sexist. However, it has to be interpreted in the context of Rickert\u2019s time. In his eyes, insisting on the mutual completion and irreducibility of the values traditionally associated with masculinity and those traditionally associated with feminineness (Rickert 1921b, 403) was a way to defend the equal value of men and women in the whole of cultural life. Philosophy as a worldview-theory based on the system of values, in turn, can provide a comprehensive picture of the world in which all contemplative and practical activity takes place. To the extent that it strives towards a comprehensive system, however, philosophy tends to exceed the sphere of theoretical goods (Rickert 1921b, 408). Instead of partaking in the indefinitely open work of the specialized sciences philosophy attempts to survey the totality of cultural life and to systematically determine its underlying value-related structure. In each successfully articulated philosophical system we then find a completed cultural good, which differs from the characteristic open-endedness of theories in the specialized sciences. The philosopher thus occupies the middle ground between the scientist moving indefinitely forward in her specialized investigations and the artist striving to produce a complete artwork. Philosophy, then, can then be considered an immanent synthesis between the unending totality characterizing the goods of science and the particularity characterizing the goods of art.\n\nPhilosophy has to be characterized as the scientific activity, which, in the stream of restlessly forward-moving development, endeavors to make a stop and find a resting point. It stands still in order to bring to light the significance for the meaning of life of what has been hitherto achieved. (Rickert 1921b, 410)\n\nRickert\u2019s conception of philosophy is tightly connected to his notion of worldview. Worldview (Weltanschauung) was a buzzword in early twentieth century German culture. Life-philosophers and anti-rationalists used the phrase \u2018Weltanschauung\u2019 to designate the inherently elusive and obscure source of all cultural life and thinking (see Dilthey 1960, 80; Simmel 1996, 29; Mannheim 1952, 38). On this reading philosophy is nothing but the conceptual articulation of pre-theoretical worldviews that are inextricably related to the historical, psychological, and cultural conditions of individual philosophers. Worldview philosophy was extremely critical of all attempts to describe the discipline as a science, that is, as a purely theoretical enterprise. Rooted in existentially grounded worldviews, philosophy is an expression of the whole human being and not merely an impersonal conceptual construction of the one-sided \u2018theoretical man\u2019 (see Staiti 2013b, 795\u2013799).\n\nRickert agrees that philosophy, unlike the specialized empirical sciences, must be oriented toward the world as a whole (Weltganze), and not merely toward this or that specific part of the world (Rickert 1910, 1; Rickert 1934, 1). However, he firmly rejects the view that, in order to grasp the world as a whole, philosophers ought to shun the ideal of scientificity and work as whole human beings merely expressing what their existential intuition of the world-whole suggests. In this regard, for Rickert, the phrase \u2018worldview\u2019 should designate the goal of philosophical work and not philosophy\u2019s obscure existential origin. Furthermore, the goal of a comprehensive theory of worldview can only be achieved with the aid of concepts and logical thinking, that is, adopting a scientific standpoint. Contra Dilthey, Simmel, and the antirationalist life-philosophers Rickert points out that \u201conly the one-sided, theoretically oriented man is able to reflect upon the world in its totality\u201d (Rickert 1933, 50). On the contrary, \u201c[t]he whole human being, precisely as \u2018whole\u2019 or \u2018existing\u2019 human being, will never transcend his \u2018small\u2019 world and this small world inevitably takes on different shapes for different people. For the pre-scientific man only that which stands in an essential connection with his own life can become \u2018world\u2019\u201d (Rickert 1933, 49\u201350; see Staiti 2013b: 799\u2013804). Rickert contends that the historical beginnings of philosophy in ancient Greece coincide with the birth of a purely \u2018theoretical man\u2019, that is, of a subject who pursues knowledge for knowledge\u2019s sake and in so doing discloses a dimension of totality unknown to natural, practically oriented human subjects (Rickert 1923b).\n\nIn order to produce knowledge about the world as a whole, philosophy cannot rely on empirical methods like the specialized sciences do, nor can it simplistically project one concept or set of concepts describing one of the world\u2019s parts onto the world-whole. For Rickert philosophy has to rely on what he calls \u201cthe heterological principle\u201d (Rickert 1921b, 57; Rickert 1934b, 39). Scholars agree that the notion of heterology is the most distinctive element of Rickert\u2019s philosophy (Glockner 1937, 11; Flach 1958, 564; Orth 1998, 81) and even his \u201cprinciple of all principles\u201d (Krijnen 2001, 256). Heterology is a relational mode of thinking, which Rickert considers paramount to the theoretical determination of objects in general (Rickert 1921b, 57) and utterly unavoidable for a conceptual grasp of totalities. It consists in using a pair of mutually exclusive concepts, that is, concepts that negate each other, and take them together as complementary. To think heterologically means to posit a given initial concept (thesis) and then proceed to posit a second concept that can be seen as its \u2018other\u2019 (hetero-thesis), so that the two concepts taken together cover the entirety of the totality to be theoretically determined. \u201cWherever we can construct concepts that, through their determinations (i.e., their limitations), do not merely negate, but they simultaneously determine positively the negated component that is missing from the whole, we can think in terms of alternatives. In so doing we are able to grasp conceptually, through a kind of detour, a whole that cannot be grasped through concepts in a direct fashion. This is because we can construct two concepts, under which every element belonging to the whole necessarily falls\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 34). We already encountered heterological pairs of concepts in the previous sections, for instance, the transcendental-psychological and the transcendental-logical paths in the theory of knowledge and generalizing and individualizing concept formation in the theory of science (see above.) In both cases the two opposite concepts, if taken together, circumscribe a totality: in the first case, the totality of epistemology, and, in the second case, the totality of scientific methods in empirical research. The \u2018test\u2019 for successful heterological reasoning is that the negation of one of the two related concepts results positively into the other concept, so that one can be a priori certain that any item not falling under the first concept necessarily falls under the second concept. As an example Rickert illustrates how to determine heterologically the totality of bodies (Rickert 1934b, 42). We can start with the thesis \u2018organic living bodies\u2019 and if we proceed to negate it we see that the merely negative concept \u2018~ organic living bodies\u2019 immediately results in the positive concept \u2018dead mechanical bodies\u2019. Taken together the two concepts amount to a successful theoretical grasp of the whole \u2018bodies\u2019. We can see with evidence that within the totality \u2018bodies\u2019, whatever body does not fall under the category \u2018organic living body\u2019 necessarily falls under the category \u2018dead mechanical body\u2019. Using heterology philosophy can reflect upon the world as a whole in terms of \u201cworld-alternatives\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 42) and set out to determine what pair of concepts is best suited to encompass the totality of what is. As we know from previous sections, Rickert contends that the pair of concepts nature/psyche does not withstand the heterological test, in that what is not nature can be either psyche or timelessly valid value. Ultimately for Rickert the correct heterology in terms of which we can approach philosophically the world as a whole is reality/value (Rickert 1913, 11). This is because whatever is not an empirical reality (be it physical or psychic) lies necessarily in the sphere of value and vice versa. Once this broad categorization of the world as whole is established, philosophy can set out to determine more specifically the subordinated wholes out of which the world as a whole is constituted and to articulate meaningfully their mutual relations.\n\nOnly an ontological pluralism does justice to the richness of the world. (Rickert 1932, 100)\n\nFrom roughly the beginning of the 1920s Rickert\u2019s philosophy is characterized by what has been referred to as an \u201contological turn\u201d (Farges 2010, 26; Kuttig 1987). However, in Rickert\u2019s eyes the introduction of ontology is not a departure from his earlier epistemological focus or the leap into a completely new philosophical dimension. As his definition of ontology as \u201cthe doctrine of what is predicated as being\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 54) already suggests, ontological questions are deeply connected to questions about judgment and predication. In other words, if we take our knowledge to consist of judgments and if we take our judgments to consist of a formal and a material component, then it is legitimate to ask what is the material component cast into conceptual forms in judgments. As the opening quote of this section indicates, for Rickert it is important to uphold pluralism in ontology. In keeping with the pluralism of meaningful predication (there is a plurality of things that we can meaningfully articulate judgments about), we cannot dogmatically presuppose that there is only one meaning of the \u2018being\u2019 addressed in our predicative activities. In this regard, far from being detrimental to a genuine ontological investigation, Rickert\u2019s insistence on the preeminence of epistemology turns out to have a positive effect on ontology. If the compass to orient ourselves in ontology is meaningful predication, then we are from the beginning immune to dogmatic reductions of what is to one monistically conceived dimension of reality (Rickert 1934b, 57).\n\nRickert\u2019s ontology contemplates four \u201ckinds of being (Seinsarten) of the world\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 153): (1) sensible (sinnlich) being; (2) non-sensible (unsinnlich) being; (3) pro-physical (pro-physisches) being; (4) supersensible (\u00fcbersinnlich) being.\n\n(1) Sensible being is the ontological category under which fall both physical and psychological being, that is, material things and mental states. Both the sphere of the physical and the sphere of the psychological are directly accessible to experience (Rickert 1934b, 63\u201364) and can be the object of meaningful predication. Therefore they must be granted equal ontological worth. Psychophysical dualism, however, causes the classical problems of mind-body causal interaction versus mind-body parallelism. Rickert\u2019s sympathies are clearly with the idea of psychophysical causality (both body to mind and mind to body) versus the hypothesis of psychophysical parallelism and the ensuing panpsychism (Rickert 1900). He considers psychophysical parallelism a self-undermining hypothesis to the extent that it relies on the atomization and quantification of psyche. Defenders of psychophysical parallelism (such as Baruch Spinoza and Gustav Fechner) introduced this hypothesis in order to preserve the autonomy of the psyche as the domain of the qualitative, which they take to be essentially different from merely quantitative physical being. However, in order to articulate their model they have to rely on a quantification of the psyche, which undercuts precisely the premise, based on which psychophysical parallelism was considered a good alternative to psychophysical causality to begin with (Rickert 1900, 76; Rickert 1934b, 66\u201373). The reason why the idea of a two-way causal link between mental and physical being seems to pose an impossible puzzle is that, prima facie, the order of the psychic and the order of the physical strike us as belonging to two separate ontological domains. However, for Rickert this is because we generally overlook the tertium comparationis, which proves that they actually belong in one an the same ontological dimension, namely, that they are both domains of sensible being, i.e., being that is directly accessible to perception. From this perspective causal interaction between mind and body is nothing but causal interaction between two ontologically homogeneous species of one and the same ontological genus \u2018sensible being\u2019. To be sure, the physical and the psychic display vastly different characteristics (extension vs. unextendedness; intentionality vs. lack of intentionality; spatiotemporal individuation vs. temporal individuation.) However, for Rickert this is not enough reason to consider the two dimensions as ontologically heterogeneous. If they are ontologically homogeneous, then it is the task of specialized empirical research and not of philosophy to determine their causal relations.\n\n(2) The ontological homogeneity of the physical and the psychic becomes even more clear if we turn our attention to a completely different ontological sphere, which taken together heterologically with sensible being completes the concept of the world of experience (Erfahrungswelt). The second kind of being in Rickert\u2019s ontology is what he calls non-sensible being. In order to introduce non-sensible being Rickert recommends that we turn our attention to word-meanings (Rickert 1934b, 79). While having a conversation, we do not only perceive the physical body of our interlocutor and the psychic reality attached to it. We also \u2018receive\u2019 in the same direct, immediate way the meanings of the words that he or she is uttering. These meanings are not psychic realities. They do not coincide with the thoughts of the speaker or with the acoustic stimuli of the listener. The very same meanings could be conveyed by a completely different sensible \u2018support\u2019 such as ink scribbles on paper. We can even recognize the same meaning as being instantiated by different words in different languages, such as the identical meaning of \u2018red\u2019, \u2018rot\u2019, \u2018rosso\u2019 and \u2018rouge\u2019. While the meaning of words must be carried by some sensible support, it is itself not sensible. It is not sensed or perceived but rather understood. This is why Rickert proposes to call the second ontological domain the non-sensible sphere of understandable meaning-configurations (verstehbare Sinngebilde) (Rickert 1934b, 81). Word-meanings, however, are only a tiny fraction of the meaning-configurations that we can experience. The arrangement of the musical notes in a symphony is likewise understood as a meaning-configuration possibly carried by different sensible supports\u2014the same melody can be played in a different key, with a different instrument, it can be sung, etc. Looking at the works of a great artist we can understand one and the same non-sensible meaning-configuration (say, the same \u2018style\u2019) realized sensibly in different media. The universe of meaning-configurations constitutes for Rickert an authentic mundus intelligibilis experienced in concomitance with but as different from the mundus sensibilis of perceivable being. However, he takes pains to remind us that we should not repeat the old Platonic mistake of taking the world of non-sensible being to be a metaphysically separate reality. Understandable meaning-configurations are an ingredient of our everyday experience and so they have to be counted among the ontological ingredients of the experiential world. In exploring the world of meaning-configurations we must take into account the principles that allow for meaning-configurations to be intelligible. Not every string of words is intelligible and, most importantly, not every intelligible string of words is true. The same holds for every meaning-configuration. It is intelligible only if its constitutive non-sensible elements are held together by the reference to a specific value. True sentences, for instance, are unified by their reference to the theoretical value of truth. In this way, Rickert clarifies the ontological status of values as non-sensible beings. The real dualism pertaining to the world of experience, then, is not the one between body and mind but the one between the sensible world of perceivable entities and the non-sensible world of understandable meaning-configurations (Rickert 1934b, 92\u201397). This insight defeats a view Rickert calls \u201chyletic sensualism\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 93) that he attributes to both Kant and Husserl. Hyletic sensualists assume that the content of our experience can only be sensible, and that whatever is non-sensible and intelligible must be ascribed to the form of our experience instead. However, based on the above analyses, Rickert emphasizes that the very content of our experience is both sensible (perceivable) and non-sensible (intelligible). Accordingly, in order to generate knowledge of sensible entities and intelligible meaning-configurations the conceptual forms of our cognition must apply to both domains.\n\n(3) Upon closer scrutiny, the kind of content that we encounter in the world of experience and conceptualize in the empirical sciences shows itself to be a compound of form and content. In fact, the entities that we encounter and theorize about in the world of experience are always objects, in a broad sense comprising physical, psychic and non-sensible entities (meaning-configurations). In keeping with the Kantian tradition, however, objects are the result of synthetic processes of objectification guided by some categories (forms). It is therefore possible to raise a question about a third domain of being: how are we to think the pure content or hyle that is immediately experienced prior to all objectification and categorization? At first this universe of absolutely raw and unsynthesized content has to be conceived of as prior to the distinction between sensible and non-sensible being, and, within the sphere of sensible being, prior to the distinction between physical and psychic reality. This is why Rickert suggests to call this third domain of being the \u201cpro-physical world\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 111; Rickert 1921b, 296), using improperly the term \u2018physical\u2019 in the phrase to indicate the whole domain of the experiential world. In this sense, \u201cthe problem of prophysics [is] at the same time the problem of the immediate\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 112), that is of the pure, immediately lived content preceding all synthesis and categorization. The regression to the prophysical world, however, does not leave us with a completely undifferentiated and inchoate mass of raw \u2018content\u2019. If we think of objects as the products of a subject\u2019s activity of categorial formation, then suspending all categorial syntheses leads us back to a pre-objective subject (Rickert 1934b, 115), whose synthetic activity brings about objects out of the pure pro-physical material in the first place. One might be inclined to think that the pro-physical subject coincides with Kant\u2019s transcendental apperception, that is, a mere empty \u2018form\u2019 of subjectivity or consciousness in general. However, and in keeping with the analyses of subjectivity in The Object of Knowledge (see above), in order to be responsible for the processes of objectification and thus form primordial materials into proper objects, the pro-physical subject must be conceived of as active and capable of stance-takings toward values (Rickert 1934b, 118). In other words, the pro-physical subject that we necessarily have to think as prior to all psychic, physical and meaning-related objectifications must be conceived of as free (Rickert 1934b, 120). While empirical psychology operating in the sphere of already objectified sensible being presents us with empirical subjects who are causally determined in various ways, pro-physics unearths a transcendental dimension of freedom that is presupposed by all objectifications. Rickert suggests that this insight solves the \u201cmystery\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 123) of freedom by way of dissolving, as it were, the traditional antinomy between freedom and determinism. These two notions, in Rickert\u2019s view, belong in two distinct ontological spheres. While the objectified psychic subject is indeed causally determined as much as any other bit of sensible being, the pro-physical subject responsible for each objectification is inherently free. In this sense, freedom and determinism are not opposed. To the extent that determinism presupposed the process of objectification, (psychophysical) determinism presupposes (prophysical) freedom. After establishing the ontological features of the prophysical subject, we can turn to the primordial materials or contents that the prophysical subject forms. Rickert suggests to calls the branch of prophysics dealing with pure materials Zustandslehre, an expression hardly translatable into English without losing its intended assonance with Gegenstandslehre (Rickert 1934b, 127). Gegen-stand is the German term for object, that is, literally, that which stands over and against a subject. However, if Gegend-stand is the product of an objectifying process, then Rickert suggests that we call that which is thereby objectified and placed \u2018over and against\u2019 Zu-stand, which can be roughly translated as \u2018state\u2019. A doctrine of pure states (reine Zust\u00e4nde) is meant to investigate the pre-objectified, pure content independently of the categorial forms that pervade such content in our sensible experiences of fully formed objects (Rickert 1934b, 129). The gist of Rickert\u2019s Zustandslehre is that even in the pro-physical world we have no reason to think of content in a monistic fashion. \u201cIn the Zustandslehre we can exhibit the ultimate ground for the encompassing dualism of the world of objects. Already the dimension of pure states (das Zust\u00e4ndliche) pertaining to understandable objects, that is, its bare material, is as non-sensible as the form which creates non-sensible objects out of it. The understandable meaning-configuration has both a non-sensible form and a non-sensible content\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 131). In other words, Rickert wants to say that the understandable meaning-configurations considered in the second domain of ontology are non-sensible through and through. One might be tempted to think that a word-meaning is composed of a non-sensible form (the ideal Bedeutung) and a sensible content, say, the acoustic data forming the distinctive sound of the word \u2018red\u2019 in English or those forming the distinctive sound of the word \u2018rosso\u2019 in Italian. On Rickert\u2019s account, however, this would be wrong. We have to distinguish the acoustic carrier of the word-meaning from the word-meaning as a whole, in both its form and its content. The acoustic carrier is entirely sensible and the word-meaning itself is entirely non-sensible. The conclusion of Rickert\u2019s prophysics is that if we consider its domain as that of the \u201cuniversal minimum\u201d of thinkability (Rickert 1934b, 133), then we have to concede that such universal minimum already entails a plurality of factors, namely, the minimal distinction between I (the prophysical subject) and non-I (the domain of pure states) and the further distinction within the sphere of non-I between the pro-physical sensible and the pro-physical non-sensible, whose objectifications carried out by the free pro-physical subject give rise to the objects in the world of experience.\n\n(4) The fourth and last ontological domain Rickert considers is that of supersensible being, traditionally addressed by metaphysics. Rickert\u2019s approach to metaphysics is guided by the problem of the ultimate connection between reality and value. Both the analysis of the world of experience and the analysis of the prophysical world resulted in an inevitable dualism between the sensible and the non-sensible, viz., the perceivable and the understandable. This poses the problem of how to preserve the dualism and still be able to conceive of the world as a whole in a unitary fashion. The first clue to think about the unity of the world is provided by the doctrine of the prophysical subject: \u201cIt produces a connection of what is real and what is meaningful (das Sinnhafte) and at the same time with the valid value\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 135). With its free stance-takings relating (sensible and non-sensible) materials to (non-sensible) values the prophysical subject encompasses both terms of the dualism and thus provides a criterion to conceive of them as united. However, this seems to tie the unity of reality and value to the particularity and contingency of actual stance-takings. This unity seems to be extremely precarious and ultimately grounded in the arbitrary acts of a pro-physical subject. The thought of a unity of reality and value beyond the particular acts of valuing subjectivity and thus beyond the scope of contents of consciousness opens up the intellectual space of metaphysics. Rickert is adamant that ultimately the transcendent unity of reality and value beyond subjectivity is the object of \u201cfaith\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 137) and not scientific knowledge. However, he insists that we need such faith in order to live both as practical and as theoretical human beings. \u201cIf the world were not arranged in such a way that our stance-taking toward the value of truth \u2018succeeds\u2019 beyond the I\u2019s act, then science, which pushes forward to cognize the world, is impossible. As scientific people, too, we need the assumption that there is a more than particular, \u2018cosmic\u2019 connection of value and reality\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 138). The \u201csupersensible unity\u201d of value and reality (Wirklichkeit) or the domain of \u201cvalue-reality\u201d (Wertrealit\u00e4t) (Rickert 1934b, 139) is the object of metaphysics. Describing the mode of access to the domain of value-reality in metaphysics, Rickert holds fast to Kant\u2019s view that metaphysics is not possible as a science. This, however, entails neither that metaphysics is altogether impossible, nor that some other kind of non-scientific knowledge may not be produced as legitimate metaphysical knowledge. Rickert refers to metaphysical knowledge in scare quotes as \u201callegoric\u201d, \u201cimage-building\u201d (sinnbildlich) or \u201csymbolic\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 140). In other words, metaphysics is bound to employ images, metaphors and oblique expressions in order to produce indirect knowledge of the transcendent, subject-independent unity of reality and value. Rickert here clearly has in mind the most illustrious of all metaphysicians: Plato. When he called the Forms \u2018real\u2019 he borrowed a phrase that has an established meaning for this-worldly realities and applied it metaphorically to the domain of otherworldly or supersensible being. Moreover, as is well known, he made abundant use of allegories, similes and mythological stories in order to illustrate the ultimately inaccessible world of the supersensible. Finally, Rickert warns against a conflation of metaphysics and religion (Rickert 1934, 201). While in concrete cultural worlds and living individuals these two spheres of culture often intersect and overlap, it is important to keep them conceptually distinct. Metaphysics is a theoretical enterprise trying to determine conceptually supersensible being with the aid of metaphors, symbols, etc. It does involve faith but it is a purely rational faith in some kind of transcendent unity of reality and value. Religion, on the contrary, is characterized by faith in the existence of a supersensible divine being, in which ultimately all values and meanings are grounded. Both are valuable and important component of culture. Empirically speaking, they often occur together and have numerous mutual influences. However, they can never be reduced theoretically to one another. In other words, the rational faith of metaphysics does not automatically lead to religious faith in a divine being and, conversely, religious faith does not necessitate the believer to accept that the ultimate unity of reality and value is accessible (through symbolic knowledge) to the rational discourse of metaphysics."}, {"url": "https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/neo-kantianism/v-2", "page_content": "DOI: 10.4324/9780415249126-DC055-2\n\nVersion: v2, Published online: 2022\n\nRetrieved June 10, 2023, from https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/neo-kantianism/v-2\n\nThe term \u2018neo-Kantianism\u2019 indicates various attempts at a renewal of Kant\u2019s philosophy in the modern context. It began with the rehabilitation of Kant to overcome the speculative turn of classical German idealism and ground philosophy in the investigation of the conditions of knowledge. In this sense, the origins of neo-Kantianism are sometimes dated back to figures opposing speculative idealism in the early nineteenth-century philosophical landscape, including Johann Friedrich Herbart, Jakob Friedrich Fries, Friedrich Eduard Beneke (Beiser 2014). Philosophers from the next generation sharing the commitment to a Kantian theory of knowledge also include Kuno Fischer, Eduard Zeller, Otto Liebmann, J\u00fcrgen Bona Meyer, Friedrich Albert Lange. More specifically, \u2018neo-Kantianism\u2019 is used to indicate a philosophical movement developed beginning in the 1870s with the intent to shed light on the basic tenets of Kant\u2019s work and face challenges to traditional philosophy coming from nineteenth-century scientific advancements in the spirit of Kant\u2019s critical philosophy (see, e.g., K\u00f6hnke 1991; Patton 2005; Luft 2015). The neo-Kantian movement started with Hermann Cohen\u2019s seminal interpretation of Kant (Cohen 1871a; 1877; 1885), and subsequently flourished in German universities, with two main centres in Marburg, where Cohen was appointed lecturer in 1873, and in South West Germany.\n\nThe development of experimental methods in nineteenth-century life sciences offered important insights for the theory of knowledge, but also raised the question about the possibility of reducing cognitive processes to physical ones. Kant\u2019s critical philosophy offered a powerful argument against materialism, by limiting the validity of causal explanations to the realm of appearances rather than replacing them with metaphysical explanations. In conjunction with the materialism controversy, the 1860s saw a resurgence of interest in classical interpretative issues concerning Kant, including the assumption of a thing in itself, its relation to the sensibility, the status of a priori elements of knowledge. Following a suggestion first made by the physiologist and physicist Hermann von Helmholtz, some of those who argued for a return to Kant believed that Kant\u2019s a priori forms deserved an empirical explanation. In contrast with this, Cohen emphasized that the individuation of a priori elements of knowledge requires a meta-level inquiry into the presuppositions of the sciences, that is, what Kant identified as the transcendental cognition. Cohen took Kant to imply that experience is given in the fact of science, and the transcendental task is to derive the preconditions for the possibility of this fact by regressive analysis. This formulation allowed Cohen to address the controversial issues raised in the Kant scholarship by emphasizing the logical structure of experience, while considering part of Kant\u2019s considerations about the natural sources of knowledge to be a remainder of his reliance on empirical psychology in the precritical period. At the same time, Cohen\u2019s interpretation of Kant set the task of a novel investigation of the historically documented facts of science and culture in the wake of the transcendental method.\n\nCohen\u2019s interpretation set a standard, not only for its contribution to the historical reconstruction of the development of Kant\u2019s thought, but also for the idea of a fruitful correlation between interpretation and philosophical theorizing. In this sense, the revival of Kant\u2019s critical philosophy involved also the idea of a constant renewal of it. Over the next decade, other influential interpretations were developed with various theoretical purposes, from the attempt to integrate the Kantian theory of a priori cognition with insights derived from the empiricist theory of knowledge (Riehl 1876; 1879) to the appreciation of Kant\u2019s attempt to account for the application of universal rules of thought outside the domain of the mathematical science of nature in the third Critique (Windelband 1878\u201380). The Marburg School formed in the wake of Cohen\u2019s characterization of the transcendental method. Its main representatives were Paul Natorp, who became Cohen\u2019s colleague at Marburg in 1885, and Ernst Cassirer, who studied there from 1896 to 1899, and continued to subscribe to the methodology of his Marburg teachers throughout his intellectual career. The South West German School developed around Wilhelm Windelband\u2019s teaching at the universities of Freiburg from 1877 to 1882, Strasbourg from 1882 to 1903, and Heidelberg from 1903 to 1915. Other leading figures of this school were Heinrich Rickert and his student Emil Lask. There were also neo-Kantians who did not strictly belong to a school or combined neo-Kantianism with other philosophical traditions. This includes, for example, Alois Riehl, Jonas Cohn, Richard H\u00f6nigswald.\n\nEach school focused on some common themes. Marburg neo-Kantians gradually broadened the scope of their research from Kant to the philosophical and scientific roots of what they called a critical or scientific form of idealism, according to which the objects of experience are constructed by scientific concepts. They sought to provide an account for the various spheres of human experience by extending the transcendental inquiry from the fact of science to the facts of culture. South West German neo-Kantians focused on the question concerning the grounds for relating unconditionally valid values to contingent experience. This led them to engage in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century debate about the possibility of an autonomous foundation of the human sciences. They pursued the project of a philosophy of culture offering a unitary account of the various human activities from the standpoint of the theory of values. These commonalities notwithstanding, neo-Kantianism was a complex movement, with internal debates and major developments within the same school, as well as connections between different schools and traditions.\n\nNeo-Kantianism dominated the philosophical scene until the early 1910s, and remained in the background of the main philosophical innovations in the German-speaking world for the next two decades until the rise of Nazism. It is considered to have made lasting contribution in epistemology, philosophy of science, history of philosophy and philosophy of culture (see, e.g., Luft and Makkreel 2010; De Warren and Staiti 2015; Edgar and Patton 2018; Kinzel and Patton 2021)."}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-intellectual-history/article/abs/neokantianism-and-georg-simmels-interpretation-of-kant/7181F0DDC3844A7E89401AFA179E7695", "page_content": "INTRODUCTION Georg Simmel (1858\u20131918) was one of the most perceptive and integrative thinkers of his time. He absorbed the intellectual languages of his tradition more comprehensively than any of his contemporaries. Thus he can be regarded as a synoptic figure who assists us in making sense of this tradition: through the hermeneutic interaction between the whole and the part, the overall intellectual context elucidates the meaning of his thought and, conversely, his thought is brought to reflect on the meaning of its context.Footnote 1 On the most general level, the story of German intellectual life of that period can be summarized in terms of a quest to resolve a specific dilemma: how might one reconcile the ideal of universal harmony with the axiological independence of one or more fragments which are otherwise supposed to serve this harmony? This issue is alluded to in the formula \u201cunity in diversity\u201d and in the set of questions relating to the interaction between the whole and the part. It was broadly acknowledged in the nineteenth century but acquired a nearly existential significance only in Germany. Hence it can serve as a master key, so to speak, to decipher what was going on in German intellectual life at that time. The story, as I see it, runs as follows. The intellectual tradition that puts at its centre a preoccupation with the question of unity amid the growing differentiation of intellectual activities and social forms begins in parallel with Bl\u00fctezeit, lasts for over a century and can be roughly divided into three periods. The first period frames the intellectual task: to find a way to combine unity and variety. The second period\u2014the mid-nineteenth century\u2014is one of technicians: intellectuals who more or less uncritically absorb the ideal of synthesis posited by earlier generations. They engage in a variety of intellectual practices, which find their cultural justification in conformity to the ideal of ultimate unity. However, the relative success of this enterprise, as each of those intellectual spheres reaches methodological maturity, paradoxically generates a new anxiety. For as culture continues to diversify, the ideal of unity does not appear to be any closer; it is like the horizon, constantly distant, possibly even receding. The realization of the illusory character of this unity signifies the third period, which lasts roughly from the 1870s to World War I. Growing discontent with the very ideal of synthesis provokes a renewed philosophical conversation on the issue of interaction between unity and its fragments, until the entire quest is all but abandoned as obsolete in the aftermath of the war.Footnote 2 This storyline was typical of almost every significant sphere of intellectual activity in Germany, be it religion, the social sciences, aesthetic theories, historicism or philosophy. In this essay I focus specifically on the philosophical movement of neo-Kantianism and on Simmel's relation to it. Neo-Kantianism belongs to the last two periods of the story, exemplifying how straightforward attempts to maintain the ideal of unity in variety, which characterize the work of the mid-nineteenth-century generation, evolved into anxiety about irreconcilable plurality. Simmel's own intellectual development replicates this story in miniature with the broadest amplitude: shifting from confident optimism in the ability of Kantian philosophy to serve as the basis for the modern unified world view (optimism that was common among his teachers belonging to the older generation) to a break with Kant\u2014a step which most of his fellow neo-Kantians were not prepared to make.\n\nWHAT WAS NEO-KANTIANISM? In the anglophone world Georg Simmel is known mainly as a sociologist, as most of his philosophical works remain untranslated. Yet he was one of the most acute philosophical minds of his time, whose interpretation of Kant greatly influenced his students and a wider audience. In fact, Simmel's intellectual career began with Kant. Kant's theory of matter was the subject of his student dissertation, for which he was awarded the Royal Prize in 1880, and on the basis of which he was promoted to a doctoral degree.Footnote 3 His subsequent Habilitation essay analysed Kant's ideas of synthetic judgement, pure perception and pure will and was regarded by the examination committee as a better work than his initial study, on the origins of music.Footnote 4 Simmel's first course as Privatdozent at Berlin University was on Kant's ethics, and he continued teaching Kant for many years.Footnote 5 Kant was also a recurring theme in many of his publications, culminating in Kant: Sixteen Lectures Delivered at Berlin University, delivered in the winter semester of 1902\u20133 and published as a book in 1904.Footnote 6 Kant was Simmel's most popular work; none of his other books enjoyed four editions during his lifetime.Footnote 7 In addition to his promotion of Kant's philosophy as a teacher and writer, Simmel regularly cooperated with Kant scholars: he contributed an article on Kant's philosophy to the first issue of Kant-Studien, became a life member of the Kant Society and was among the founders of the philosophical journal LOGOS, perceived as the tribune of the south-western Baden neo-Kantian school, and he was initially apprehensive that he would be perceived as a representative of that particular school.Footnote 8 But what kind of a neo-Kantian was he, after all? \u201cNeo-Kantianism\u201d was a blend of activities of at least three different kinds.Footnote 9 First, it was a scholarly movement, the aim of which was to pursue a detailed philological, historical and interpretative study of Kant's philosophy. Second, it was an attempt at reformulating, developing and improving Kant's philosophical system. Finally, it was a public philosophical movement which aimed at creating its own cultural world view. Simmel's work encompasses all three aspects. When one mentions Simmel's \u201cneo-Kantianism,\u201d one is usually referring only to his cultural\u2013philosophical contribution, without considering his role in the two other aspects of neo-Kantianism: the interpretation and modification of Kant's philosophy. Yet only by considering these can Simmel's peculiar place within neo-Kantianism be made clear. Simmel's approach to Kant can be split into two periods. In the first, he considered Kant not only as a great philosophical mind, but also as the creator of the only adequate intellectual basis for resolving the contradictions of the modern era. In the second period, he came to believe that Kant's response to the problems of modernity was not fully satisfactory, although he continued to hold him in great esteem. This turn in Simmel's position happened between 1896 and 1902; that is, between the publication of his essay \u201cWhat Is Kant to Us?\u201d (1896), in which he outlined in detail his initial position, and the public lectures on Kant (1902), in which he voiced his new attitude. If one were to look for a more precise date of the change, I would suggest 1899. Two things happened then. First, Simmel stopped offering annual classes on Kant. From now on he would lecture on Kant only occasionally.Footnote 10 Second, in the same year he published the essay \u201cKant and Goethe,\u201d in which for the first time he spoke about an alternative way\u2014Goethe\u2019s\u2014to resolve the contradictions of modernity.Footnote 11 I claim that it is Simmel's disenchantment with central tenets of Kant's philosophical world view which led him to ally himself more closely with the cultural\u2013philosophical project of neo-Kantianism. His philosophical development can thus be described as a departure from Kant towards neo-Kantianism.\n\nEARLY NEO-KANTIANS In the latter half of the nineteenth century, Kant's philosophy attracted a great deal of attention in Germany. The renewed interest had begun in the late 1850s and the 1860s with the publication of important studies by Kuno Fischer, Otto Liebmann and F. A. Lange. It spread in the 1870s and 1880s, the term \u201cneo-Kantianism\u201d first appearing around 1875.Footnote 12 In 1896 Hans Vaihinger established the journal Kant-Studien, and shortly afterwards (1904) the Kant Society was founded. In the last two decades of the Kaiserreich, neo-Kantianism established itself as a leading philosophical current in Germany. The cultural project of neo-Kantianism in general can be described as an attempt to find in Kant the foundations for restoring the unity of the world view vis-\u00e0-vis diversified modern civilization. The diagnosis of modernity was disunity, and Kant was supposed to have provided the answer to this disunity. But the kind of answer expected from Kant depended on the kind of disunity perceived to exist in modernity. The first period of the Kantian revival (late 1850s\u20131880s) was affected by the legacy of Kant's reception by the first generation of post-Kantian Idealists, the generation of Schelling, Hegel and Schopenhauer. The specific kind of disunity that troubled these Idealists was that between the phenomenal and noumenal worlds. The central initial question of post-Kantian German Idealism was the question of dualism between the world as appearance and the world as it really is, symbolized by the famous expression \u201cthing-in-itself.\u201d Neo-Kantians attacked this preoccupation with the thing-in-itself, which they considered futile. They believed that the emphasis on the thing-in-itself turned Kant into a metaphysician, whereas the most valuable aspect of his philosophy, the one that ensured its coherence, was his rejection of metaphysics. Kant's philosophy, in their eyes, was critical rather than metaphysical. It focused on what governs our experience and not on what may lurk behind it. These neo-Kantians regarded \u201cthing-in-itself\u201d as a \u201ctranscendental\u201d (in the Kantian sense) rather than metaphysical term. In other words, \u201cthing-in-itself\u201d is a term evoked to outline the limits of possible experience rather than to point to things that may exist beyond our experience. \u201cThe \u2018thing in itself\u2019 is a mere limit-concept,\u201d claimed F. A. Lange,Footnote 13 while Hermann Cohen called it \u201cominous,\u201d arguing that, from the standpoint of our experience, it should be considered as nothing.Footnote 14 Having thus got rid of the obnoxious thing-in-itself and the set of associated problems (antinomies, Ideas, God, etc.), neo-Kantians concentrated on what they regarded both as the heart of Kant's theory and as his most relevant philosophical idea: that our mind always grasps the world actively, and that the forms in which the world appears to our perception and to our understanding exist a priori. It is impossible for us to experience the world other than in time, in space, under the category of causality, etc. The purpose of philosophy is to outline the presuppositions under which the world can be known by experience and thus to determine the proper sphere of modern science. Neo-Kantians diverged in their views as to why our experience is determined by a priori forms, and why specifically by these and not other forms. The earlier generation (for example Liebmann and initially Lange) offered a physiological explanation, arguing that the a priori is determined by our biological organization.Footnote 15 Certain categories are necessary for the human race, whereas other intelligent beings may possess a different system of categories. Cohen, by contrast, believed that the categories possessed logical necessity: for all mental organisms there is only one way to pursue truly scientific knowledge. Kant's own view in this respect is a subject of historical interpretation, though it appears that he did not clearly differentiate between the two positions.Footnote 16 But this did not have to concern neo-Kantians, whose aim, even as they proclaimed the importance of studying Kant's texts scrupulously, was mainly to reformulate and improve upon Kant. The task of the new scholarship was precisely to return to Kant's basic problems in order to solve them better than Kant himself had done.Footnote 17 As Wilhelm Windelband would later say, \u201cto understand Kant means to surpass Kant.\u201dFootnote 18 The way in which Kant was surpassed regarding the question of a priori was this: Kant himself believed that the system of categories outlined by him was complete and eternally valid. But neo-Kantians could not accept this closed system; they considered it inadequate and outdated. It did not matter whether the a priori was a function of our biological organization or of logical necessity. In both instances Kant's system was finite, for he did not foresee any significant changes either in the organization of human beings or in the Aristotelian and Newtonian basis of the natural sciences; and in both instances Kant would be challenged by the end of the nineteenth century. First, evolutionary biology implied that the contemporary form of the human race was not the final or the only possible one, that new forms would develop in time, and that consequently the nature of experiencing by future human beings may differ from ours. Second, and more central to the history of neo-Kantianism, the principles of natural and exact sciences significantly evolved, which allowed Cohen to suggest that Kant had based his a priori system on the scientific situation that was becoming increasingly irrelevant. Science is an open-ended activity. The science of the future would modify the principles universally accepted in Cohen's time, just as the science of his time modified the principles of Newtonian physics. For this reason, it is impossible to formulate a finite system of a priori categories. The system must remain open enough to accommodate future scientific progress.Footnote 19 At the same time, neo-Kantians did not consider this criticism to be a repudiation of Kant. On the contrary, they saw themselves as completing Kant's work. For them, the most significant thing was, first, that Kant's philosophy presupposed unity rather than dualism. And second, this unity was quintessentially modern, because it welcomed variety and open-endedness. Kant paved the way towards a unified philosophical world view that could accommodate open-endedness and progress. Thus, in the eyes of early neo-Kantians, his theory entailed, in principle, an adequate response to the intellectual demands of the modern age; it built a unified system valid for the condition of modern variety.\n\nSIMMEL\u2019S INTERPRETATION OF KANT\u2019S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE The project of reformulating Kantian doctrine was all but over by the early 1880s, the time of Simmel's first intellectual endeavours. His understanding of Kant's epistemology and metaphysics was preconditioned by this reformulation. His initial view of Kant developed in the context of the interpretation advanced by early neo-Kantians. In his eyes, as in the eyes of many of his contemporaries, this was not an interpretation but the interpretation: the last word of scholarship. For Simmel, Kant's philosophy is mainly the philosophy of knowledge and experience. Simmel does everything he can to remove any remnants of the noumenal world from Kant's philosophy. In \u201cWhat Is Kant to Us?\u201d, for example, he argues that Kant's teaching about the thing-in-itself is generally misunderstood. It is commonly believed that Kant argued that \u201cI\u201d\u2014our mind\u2014has something beyond itself which is fundamentally different from it: the world of objects to which one is denied direct access. According to this belief, \u201cthere exists an unbridgeable abyss between representation and the thing-in-itself, and the former can never reach the latter, always remaining just itself.\u201dFootnote 20 This understanding, however, is false. The reason for our inability to know the thing-in-itself is not the incommensurability of our mind with what lies outside it (for thinking has no limits and can in principle push towards things-in-themselves); it is, rather, that pure thinking, detached from sensual perception, cannot be a means of knowledge at all, for the only existing reality is the one already entailed in sensual appearance. \u201cThis mere appearance of the world that we see is not an illusion or error,\u201d for \u201cthe sensible, intelligibly ordered representation is precisely reality.\u201dFootnote 21 It is all the more certain to us, as we do not imagine anything beyond it: thus the stable world's apparent evaporation and uprooting through reduction to a sensible representation actually bestows on it a kind of stability and certainty which it never had as long as one assumed as the real and true world a world of things in themselves which exists beyond our senses and can be reached only in thought.Footnote 22 This is the gist of Simmel's interpretation of Kant's theory of knowledge and experience: the very notion that the world is appearance determined by forms entailed in our own mind actually bestows upon reality an earlier unachievable degree of certainty and thus frees us from the danger of scepticism. The radical subjectivism of Kant leads to the radical assertion of objectivity and of certainty with regard to the known world. One can speak meaningfully about objectivity only once the thing-in-itself has been deprived of its status as an independent object. According to Simmel's interpretation, from which he never deviates, the question of the existence of something beyond the realm of experience is simply irrelevant to the Kantian critique of reason.Footnote 23 Like other neo-Kantians, Simmel is well aware that this was not exactly the view of the historical Kant, who was very interested in the problem of God's existence and other \u201cmetaphysical\u201d subjects. Yet Simmel believes that these questions lost their appeal for modern man, for whom the critical aspect of Kant's philosophy is of greater consequence. It is this critical aspect which constitutes the philosophical essence of Kant's ideas.Footnote 24 Therefore it is important not to succumb to the \u201cterrible danger of converting into a world the absolutely unrecognizable [quality] of the thing-in-itself.\u201dFootnote 25 This substantialization of the thing-in-itself was merely an unfortunate error of Kant: \u201cThe crossing of self-imposed limits which is committed by Kant through the metaphysical use of the thing-in-itself is based on the fact that he solidifies its purely functional meaning into a substantive being.\u201dFootnote 26 The relevant context for the term \u201cfunction\u201d vis-\u00e0-vis \u201csubstance,\u201d as they are used in Kant, is the school of \u201cempiricism\u201d (or \u201cempirio-criticism\u201d) of Ernst Mach and Richard Avenarius.Footnote 27 It was Mach who popularized the idea that modern physics replaced the older understanding of matter as substance with a newer notion of matter as energy. By using these terms Simmel was pushing his interpretation of Kant into a strongly empiricist direction, apparently deviating from the orthodox neo-Kantian position. In the intellectual context of the late nineteenth century, Mach's critical positivism was seen to be in opposition to neo-Kantianism, which focused on the logical rather than the sensual presuppositions of knowledge. Simmel regarded this opposition as unfortunate and considered both approaches complementary. He wrote that the intellectual-historical situation in the 1870s, in which the renaissance of Kantian theory occurred, meant that one perceived in it above all its opposition to ordinary empiricism without properly emphasizing that actually in respect of the practice of understanding it did not depart that far from empiricism.Footnote 28 Instead of postulating the dualism of empirical perception, on the one hand, and of necessary mathematical and logical judgements, on the other, Simmel thus described them as the two poles of possible experience: pure perception as its lowest limit, and pure understanding as its highest limit. All judgements of experience occur within these limits, being in fact mixtures of perception and understanding in different proportions.Footnote 29 There is, then, no dichotomous distinction between valid objective experience and sensual perception. Valid objective experience means merely the guarantee of the repetition of sensual perception for everyone and at all times.Footnote 30 This empiricist bias does not, however, put Simmel outside the neo-Kantian tradition. Some other prominent neo-Kantians too, especially those with a scientific bent, such as Helmholtz and Riehl, were strongly influenced by empiricism. In addition, in Simmel's texts this empiricist side coexists with another motive: considering the mind as an active construction of reality. This motive was characteristic of more stringent currents in neo-Kantianism, represented, for example, by the Marburg school of Cohen and Paul Natorp. One of the central tasks of Marburg neo-Kantians was to purge Kantian teaching of any elements of passivity, or of receptivity.Footnote 31 For if the mind is just a passive perceiver of external reality, then the question\u2014what is reality in itself?\u2014is not eliminated. Therefore these thinkers suggested that even time and space (that is, those a priori forms which, according to Kant, are perceived intuitionally and not conceptually) are nothing other than functions of the active mind itself. This is exactly the line Simmel pursues to its extreme. He describes space as an activity of experiencing. According to him, it would be false to say that we exist in space. Rather, it is the mind's activity which is spatial. And this is what actually makes space perfectly \u201cobjective\u201d: \u201cspace possesses the entire reality about which one can speak at all within the limits of our knowledge, precisely because it is the form and condition of our empirical representations.\u201dFootnote 32 Similarly, time is \u201cthe form of self-perception, of the knowledge of one's own self.\u201dFootnote 33 In other words, as Simmel says in the fourth edition of Kant (1918), the essence of Kantian Idealism lies not in the formula \u201cthe world is my representation [die Welt is meine Vorstellung], but in a more profound one: the world is my [activity of] representing [die Welt ist mein Vorstellen].\u201dFootnote 34 Yet, again, this formula does not presuppose any subjectivism. On the contrary, it bestows complete certainty on our experience. Already in the first edition of Kant Simmel claims that the Kantian subject \u201cis definitely not personal, definitely not the \u2018soul\u2019.\u201dFootnote 35 Kant succeeds in combining the subjective and the objective into a fully coherent whole: \u201cAfter subjectivity and objectivity have thus become for him the [opposite] poles of the world of knowledge, he bends them together again.\u201dFootnote 36 Kant's teaching substitutes representations of the things for the things themselves. Yet by this \u201cthe world is intellectualized, it is not subjectivized.\u201dFootnote 37 Later, in the third edition (1913), this point is reinforced by an additional statement that the relevant conscience in experience is not that of an individual but the unity of conscience as such, which is not individual, not force-like [kraftm\u00e4\u00dfig], but is the meaning, the form of the mental coherence of the contents of the world, coherence that resides in the currently active individual, similar to how the logical meaning of a written sentence resides in material pieces with that sentence.Footnote 38 Thus even in his later writings Simmel continues to follow the initial programme of the neo-Kantian movement in general and of Marburg scholars in particular: that of removing any remnants of dualism from Kant's epistemology. Whenever he senses the danger of dualism sneaking back in, he speaks against it. For example, without naming him directly he criticizes Vaihinger's interpretation of Kant. In 1911 Vaihinger published The Philosophy of As If, in which he argued that human knowledge advances by inventing convenient fictions: mental tools employed to acquire a knowledge of reality. A significant portion of the treatise was dedicated to Kant and his usage of the \u201cas-if\u201d formula.Footnote 39 It is to this image of Kant as an \u201cas-if\u201d philosopher that Simmel replied in his 1913 edition of Kant: This category of \u201cas if\u201d, introduced by Kant among philosophical methods, was proclaimed as the necessary fiction for human understanding and action, a conscious self-deception, so to speak, which is a stage on the way towards what is theoretically and practically correct. I consider this to be a misconception . . . It can appear as fiction only because we are used to presenting our elements of knowledge as the harsh and extraneous alternative: subjective or objective. As a matter of fact, this structure belongs to a third layer which cannot be divided into those two, but is rather a self-sufficient synthetic unity of them.Footnote 40 In Simmel's eyes, the major achievement of Kant's philosophy was to reach unity out of extreme dualism. This unity had to be guarded. Another aspect in which Simmel followed the neo-Kantian interpretation was the notion of a priori. Like other neo-Kantians, he considered the idea of the synthetic a priori one of the most important and promising elements of Kantian teaching, and like them he criticized Kant's specific scheme of a priori categories. The history of knowledge, argued Simmel, can be reduced to two contrasting tendencies. One is governed by \u201cthe architectonic instinct,\u201d which attempts to reduce all parts of our knowledge to a closed system.Footnote 41 The other and more modern tendency, of which the quintessential expression is the theory of evolution, sees the world as an incessant development, an endless line rather than a circle. Kant's view is a surprising mixture of both. On the one hand, he postulates that the world given to our sensual experiences is infinite, and so knowledge of it develops endlessly. On the other hand, this endless development of knowledge is governed by the systematic structure of our mind. The satisfaction of the architectonic inclination is thus achieved not in extraneous reality but within the mind itself, whereas the developmental inclination can satisfy itself in an endless exploration of the world.Footnote 42 According to Simmel, this solution was a stroke of genius; sadly it became unsatisfactory for the modern mind. There is no reason why the mind's structure itself should remained closed and limited, and why the infinite development attributed to the world should not also be attributed to the forms of our knowledge.Footnote 43 The system of a priori should become more flexible, developing together with advancing knowledge. It should assign \u201cto each domain of experience its general norms and forms.\u201dFootnote 44 On a number of occasions Simmel tried himself to develop new a priori postulates for specific sorts of knowledge, such as historical knowledge or social knowledge.Footnote 45 With regard to the origin of the a priori, Simmel also seems to follow the general neo-Kantian approach, as his suggestions vacillate between the two aforementioned possibilities: that the a priori is determined either by our physiological organization or by the logic of scientific inquiry. The former position is most explicitly presented in \u201cOn the Relation of the Theory of Selection to Epistemology,\u201d an article published in 1895 in Archiv f\u00fcr systematische Philosophie, edited by Natorp.Footnote 46 Simmel suggested there a synthesis between pragmatism and the evolution theory. The truthfulness of our knowledge is based on its usefulness. Usefulness is the primary category. The objection to this view would be that it appears to advocate arbitrariness in knowledge: truth is subject to our subjective desires. Yet, in Simmel's view, this is an erroneous objection. The emphasis on usefulness does not need to presuppose subjectivity. In order to explain why this is so, Simmel draws an analogy with Kant's philosophy. The fact that, for Kant, \u201cspace\u201d is not some independent reality but is embedded in the process of intuition itself does not make it any less objective or real. Similarly, the requirement of usefulness does not lead to epistemological chaos. On the contrary, the process of evolution has established for us norms of \u201ctruth\u201d that we recognize as objectively valid and from which we cannot absolve ourselves at our own discretion: The dualism between the world as appearance as it logically\u2013theoretically exists for us and the world as that reality which responds to our practical action is removed by the fact that those forms of thought which produce the world as representation are also determined by the practical actions and counteractions that are shaped, in accordance with evolutionary necessities, by our mental as well as our bodily constitution.Footnote 47 Simmel goes on to suggest that evolutionism can be the postulate of the Kantian world view. The validity of Kant's system does not originate in abstract logical necessity, he argues, but is rather a result of the evolutionary development of the human race. Our experience today is indeed governed by the limits drawn by Kant. But this is only because in the course of the evolution these specific limits turned out to be most useful for our existence. This radical evolutionism is not characteristic of Simmel's thought as a whole. The article emerged from the philosophical explorations of a younger Simmel, and the position outlined in it was partly abandoned by him later. In Kant he did not venture into the exploration of the biological \u201cin-itself\u201d of our experience, but instead took a rather more standard line. The Kantian a priori is described there not as a product of the biologically conditioned state of the human organism, but as an abstraction derived from the practice of existing sciences. Yet this interpretation was no less neo-Kantian, as it looked similar to the view of Cohen, who argued that the a priori was based on logical necessity.Footnote 48 In any case, let the nuances of Simmel's view of Kant's epistemology be as they may, his principal position reflected the line of mainstream neo-Kantianism. His interpretation was based on two major ideas. First, there is no irreconcilable dualism in Kant's theory of knowledge. Second, the specific form that this theory takes in Kant's writings is out of date and should be modified in accordance with the state of modern knowledge. But whatever modifications might be required, it is difficult to overestimate the cultural\u2013philosophical significance of Kant's theory. Kant provides a response to intellectual discrepancies created by the modern age. Before him, early modern thinking was torn between rationalism and sensualism. Pushing both elements to their extremes, Kant managed to create a true synthesis, a true unity. He showed the way to perform \u201cthe unification of the manifold.\u201dFootnote 49 Simmel might have had reservations about some details in Kant's world view, but, especially in his younger years, he considered Kant's philosophy in general as the outline for the philosophy of modernity and his method of thinking (even when used in a very non-Kantian way in the context of the theory of evolution) as the way to find unity in variety.\n\nKANT AND THE PLURALITY OF CULTURAL FORMS Simmel almost never deviated from his appraisal of Kant's theory of experience. Although doubts about Kant's epistemology crept into the 1918 edition of Kant, where Simmel suggested that \u201cat the foundation of a priori . . . there lurks a hidden scepticism towards life,\u201d on the whole he tended to grant Kant his due with regard to this aspect of his philosophy.Footnote 50 Yet in the late 1890s Simmel began to modify his reading of other aspects of Kant's teaching, sounding more sceptical about whether the Kantian kind of \u201cunity in variety\u201d was sufficiently encompassing to provide the comprehensive response to modern disunity. At that point Simmel's interpretation of Kant began to diverge from that of many of his fellow neo-Kantians. In order to see in what way Simmel differed from other neo-Kantians, let us examine some developments which occurred in neo-Kantianism from the 1880s onwards. One can notice from that time a certain redirection of attention of many neo-Kantians from critical philosophy towards ethics, driven by the hope to develop a positive world view on the basis of Kant's teaching. The entire Kantian system begins to be perceived as directed towards the questions of morality, and this perception finds support in the Kantian formula of \u201cthe primacy of practical reason.\u201dFootnote 51 Already in 1877 Cohen referred to ethics as the safe ground to which experience steers itself as its last anchor.Footnote 52 And in 1881 Friedrich Paulsen, in his essay \u201cWhat Can Kant Be to Us?\u201d, assigned to Kant a crucial moral\u2013cultural significance. He argued that during the preceding decades the German nation had lost its unifying idea, and expressed the hope that a future philosophy built on Kantian foundations would restore the unity of the national ideal and thus become the leader of the nation. The questions to deal with, however, do not pertain to epistemology but to faith and morality.Footnote 53 It is sometimes argued that the main point of difference between the two leading schools of neo-Kantianism\u2014the Marburg school represented by Cohen and Natorp and the south-western (Baden) school represented by Windelband and Rickert\u2014is the weight assigned to different aspects of Kant's philosophy; that while the latter attributed greater significance to the questions of value and morality, the former focused on Kant's logic and its role in the foundation of the natural sciences. This account cannot be considered satisfactory and it was, in fact, challenged by commentators.Footnote 54 Neither school posited a sharp dichotomy: ethics or knowledge. Cohen and Natorp professed keen interest in moral philosophy and in practical issues arising out of it, whereas Windelband and Rickert paid serious attention to general epistemological questions (they used the terms \u201cnorm\u201d and \u201cvalue\u201d as meta-concepts governing every aspect of Kant's philosophy\u2014epistemology no less than morality).Footnote 55 A gradual shift towards exploration of the foundations of the Kantian ethics took place in both schools. The major difference seems to lie rather in the way they addressed new questions that arose as a result of their growing attention to ethics. As I pointed out earlier, neo-Kantianism was driven by the hope to form an integrated world view in the condition of diversified modernity. This hope underlay the aspiration of the early generations of neo-Kantians: to remove incoherencies from Kant's epistemology. The same search for unity and certainty in the condition of diversity initially triggered the cultural\u2013ethical pursuits of the following generations. But the peculiarity of Kant's ethics and the neo-Kantian diagnosis of the modern cultural situation presented a new set of problems. First, Kant's practical philosophy was intimately connected with the notion of freedom, which belonged to the \u201cnoumenal\u201d world, to the realm of the \u201cthing-in-itself.\u201d To dismiss the \u201cthing-in-itself\u201d in this respect was much more difficult than in the context of Kant's theory of knowledge. Dualism threatened to return. Second, the emphasis on ethics highlighted the problem of the relationship between the field of ethics and the field of knowledge, and consequently an even broader problem of how different fields in Kant's philosophy relate to each other. To find a unified system in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason was easy. But was it possible to envision a unified world view encompassing all three Critiques? The three spheres outlined in them\u2014knowledge, action, non-reflective judgement\u2014seemed to be independent, each governed by its own set of postulates. And thus, even if earlier neo-Kantians had managed to correct the epistemological dualism of Kant, there remained the problem of the pluralism of forms of experience. Plurality of cultural forms and the question of the possibility of achieving unity out of this plurality became, then, the central question of neo-Kantianism. As I see it, the main difference between the Marburg and south-western schools lies in the way they addressed this problem. The two schools differed on the question to what extent, if at all, is it possible to contemplate unity in the condition of the variety of cultural spheres? The Marburg scholars\u2019 answer tended to be \u201coptimistic.\u201d Cohen, for example, could argue as follows: \u201cCulture is unified [einheitlich] because it is possible, even necessary, to discover in it a unified law on the basis of a unified methodology. This is the task of systematic philosophy: to make culture unified in what is really its methodological lawfulness.\u201dFootnote 56 This is, of course, an extreme statement; the philosophical position of the Marburg scholars was more nuanced, and their relative optimism regarding the possibility of unity was due to the fact that their criteria for it became in the course of time less stringent and involved an open-ended logic which did not require closed totality.Footnote 57 Still, it is not philosophical nuances which concern us here, but the public language of the two intellectual movements. It is significant that Cohen was still writing like this at a time when such language was already unimaginable for south-westerners, who gradually adopted a rather pessimistic discourse on the issue. If in 1881 Windelband was able to suggest that all spheres of experience could be subsumed under the concept of \u201crule,\u201d and if a decade later Rickert could still claim that the concept of \u201cought\u201d was the governing category, the end of every judgement and therefore of knowledge, then in their later publications these two authors admitted that even if something unifies different cultural spheres, it belongs either to the transcendent realm unknown in principle or is discoverable only in a very distant future.Footnote 58 Windelband and his followers doubted, therefore, whether modern culture could be integrated into a unified whole. They introduced a degree of cultural \u201cpessimism\u201d into neo-Kantianism. Thus the Marburg and south-western schools symbolize two diverse approaches to the question of cultural integration within the neo-Kantian discourse. Yet these approaches did not carry equal weight in neo-Kantianism understood as a cultural movement. Current studies of the field pay much attention to the ideas of the Marburg neo-Kantians. Yet, historically speaking, their cultural role was relatively marginal. Hermann Cohen enjoyed the reputation of a great Kant commentator, but his role as a public intellectual was limited mainly to the Jewish audience. Moreover, politically, Cohen and Natorp were adepts of a certain kind of \u201cidealistic\u201d socialism, which put them far to the left of the political mainstream but did not endear them to orthodox Social Democrats who were committed, at least in rhetoric, to Marxist \u201cmaterialism.\u201d The ideas of Marburg scholars may have influenced a number of prominent figures on the left, such as the \u201crevisionist\u201d leader Eduard Bernstein, but this influence was indirect and, in any case, what Marburg scholars were saying on the subject of the unity of culture remained below the mainstream public radar. Ernst Cassirer, a younger Marburg scholar, played a significant role as a public intellectual, but with regard to the notion of the variety of cultural spheres he tended to adopt the pluralistic tone more reminiscent of Rickert than of Cohen. Now, whereas the Marburg philosophers were known and respected as scholars rather than intellectuals, the story of the south-western school seems to be the exact opposite. In the field of Kant commentary they wrote nothing comparable in scope to Cohen's works (unless one counts Windelband's teacher, Kuno Fischer, who published his commentary on Kant in the 1860s).Footnote 59 But they were much more vocal in their role as public intellectuals, setting the tone in debates on the state of modern culture. As a cultural phenomenon, therefore, neo-Kantianism as a whole began to be associated with the specific position taken by Windelband and his followers. They emphasized above all the idea of the radical plurality of cultural spheres in the modern world, believing that the role of philosophy was to theorize the axiological postulates of these spheres. What, then, was the role of Kant in this story? We have seen that initially neo-Kantians perceived Kant as the guide to the integration of the modern mind. But now, as the focus of attention moved towards the issue of the pluralism of cultural spheres, south-western neo-Kantians moved away from this ideal. At the same time they were not prepared to break with Kant. They carried him with them as far as they could, presenting him as the source of their pluralism, though admitting that the historical Kant might not have been as radical as they.Footnote 60 Thus the neo-Kantian reading of Kant which began with Kant as a great unifier turned into the perception of Kant as a codifier of plurality. Let us now examine what happened to Simmel's interpretation of Kant in the context of this general change.\n\nSIMMEL\u2019S BREAK WITH KANT Initially Simmel regarded Kant's practical philosophy as the basis to solve the dilemmas of the modern age. He argued that Kant laid out presuppositions for the truly empirical science of ethics, which could produce an antidote to the prevailing scepticism.Footnote 61 In his appraisal of Kant's ethics Simmel did not differ from many other neo-Kantians. Indeed the title of his essay \u201cWhat Is Kant to Us?\u201d was reminiscent of Paulsen's essay from 1881.Footnote 62 Paulsen would be a bit suspicious of the term \u201cempirical.\u201d Many neo-Kantians believed that \u201cempiricism\u201d was just a euphemism evoked to conceal the overall nihilism. Yet they would have hardly disagreed with the main message of Simmel's essay, according to which Kant was the founding father of the kind of morality that was able to rebuff modern scepticism. Simmel's initial view of Kant's ethics paralleled his view of Kant's epistemology: just as Kant's epistemology established the principles of our knowledge, his ethics established the principles of moral judgement and conduct. In both cases the solution is achieved by creating a great synthesis from two contradictory tendencies. In respect of epistemology, the two tendencies were rationalism and sensualism. Analogously, \u201cKant's moral teaching is a remarkable attempt to decide between social and individualistic tendencies.\u201dFootnote 63 The synthesis between the two is achieved by means of the categorical imperative that requires us to act in such a way that would enable our actions to become a universal law. And \u201chere is the point where the Kantian formula links the complete individualization of conduct with its complete socialization.\u201dFootnote 64 On the one hand, an action must be completely free; that is, it must come from the depths of one's own personality, from the determination of one's will. On the other hand, this self-determination is supposed to follow the broadest principles of social welfare. Therefore the apparent dualism between the personal and the social is abolished. To be part of social collectivity and at the same time to be a free individual is in fact one and the same thing. Simmel admits, though, that there appears to be another dualism within Kant's moral teaching: that between the quest for happiness and the requirements of duty. Kant denied any possibility of reconciliation between the two in this world. By depriving us of this, \u201che set a rift in the world of ideals which runs right through the middle of the human heart.\u201dFootnote 65 But even here dualism was not Kant's last word. The possibility of reconciliation was implied in his view of God and immortality, so that dualism could be overcome by the unity of a higher order, at least hypothetically.Footnote 66 Thus, according to Simmel, the task of Kant's moral philosophy was analogous to that of his theory of knowledge: to show the way to overcome modern dualism and reach coherent unity. An integrated world view is achieved within both the sphere of action and the sphere of thought. But what about their relation to each other? Does the perfect unity characterizing each of these spheres separately also exist when they are considered together? And if they are part of the same unity, do they both enjoy equal status, or does one of them have primacy over the other (for example, does practical reason have primacy over theoretical reason, as many neo-Kantians claimed)? Simmel occasionally touched on this question in his early writings. Sometimes he appeared to think that the two spheres were fully independent of each other. For example, in the Introduction to the Science of Morality (1892), where he advocated the autonomous standing of the category of \u201cought,\u201d he argued that the Kantian assertion that [moral will] is practical reason, and that it is \u201cin the end one and the same reason\u201d which operates in understanding and in practice, was the expression and is still the cause of countless obscurities and errors. I cannot see at all what the act of will to renounce my advantage for the sake of that of another person or of a collectivity has in common with the ability to draw a conclusion from certain premises, unless one extends the notion of the reason common to them to that of consciousness or of the soul in general, by which, though, this connection loses any specific sense.Footnote 67 On other occasions, like in the aforementioned essay on knowledge and the theory of selection, he suggested that there is a sort of connection between the two spheres, and that the primacy belongs to practice: truth appears to be a function of practical usefulness.Footnote 68 Yet generally the question of the relationship between the sphere of knowledge and the sphere of action in Kant's philosophy did not bother Simmel too much in his early writings. He seemed to be satisfied enough with the manner in which the paths to unity within the realm of scientific knowledge and within that of moral conduct were outlined, and this was everything he needed at that time. His own philosophical position was that the two spheres were irrelevant to each other, and therefore he did not envisage a grand system encompassing the two. It is with regard to this issue that Simmel's attitude underwent an important change as he later developed an interpretation which put him at odds with the neo-Kantian one. He did this in Kant, arguing there that Kant's thought as a whole is characterized by a unified disposition; that the inner unity found within each sphere of Kant's thought also exists between the spheres; and that in this unified world view the theoretical attitude appears to be primary and all the rest derivative. This interpretation is of the utmost importance to Simmel, as he outlines it in many places in the book. Already in the beginning he criticizes the tendency, as it were, to regard \u201cwill\u201d rather than \u201cthought\u201d as the central interest of the Kantian system. This view is erroneous, because \u201cKant and his system are fully intellectualistic; his interest . . . is to prove that the norms valid for thinking are valid in all spheres of life.\u201dFootnote 69 In another chapter Simmel claims that \u201cthe modern tendency to adjust or subordinate knowledge itself to other ruling powers of life is completely foreign to Kant.\u201dFootnote 70 The famous primacy of practical reason means little. And if one still has any doubts, Simmel decides to be utterly provocative: The Kantian \u201cprimacy of practical reason\u201d over the theoretical\u2014the legitimization of the theoretically unprovable ideas of God, freedom and immortality through ethical needs\u2014has been often exaggerated in respect of its significance for the image of life. Yet it means nothing more than that science, not itself knowing what to do with a couple of concepts, leaves them to the practical need to give them shape, thus making sure that this practical need never interferes in its own affairs. To call this a primacy of practical reason was not a very happy expression.Footnote 71 The primacy of practical reason is thus reduced by Simmel to \u201ca couple\u201d of concepts relegated to practice, as if they were a cookie given by parents to an obnoxious child to shut him up. The primacy of intellect over will in Kant is demonstrated through the analysis of his justification of the categorical imperative. Simmel posits the question why, according to Kant, is it inherently impossible to wish that certain actions be a universal norm? Why is it impossible to wish that stealing or lying become a general law of conduct? Simmel claims that two divergent answers can be found in Kant, even if Kant himself did not always clearly differentiate between them. One is based on the notion of one's own interest: when someone hurts others, he cannot really want that others behave similarly towards him. Simmel considers this answer inadequate and incomprehensible, reproaching Kant for \u201cethical pettiness [Kleinlichkeit].\u201dFootnote 72 Kant must have never been able to imagine a strong rebellious character bent on suppressing others who at the same time would be prepared to submit to someone stronger than he. Similarly, Kant did not seem to realize that the most altruistic natures are precisely those who, while always being ready to sacrifice themselves for the sake of others, would never want anyone else to behave like them in similar situations. But there is another answer in Kant which is based not on the considerations of interest but on those of logic. It is inherently impossible to want to universalize certain actions because this would constitute logical contradiction. For example, to turn \u201clying\u201d into a universal law would entail contradiction. To lie is to make a false utterance. A law is also a type of utterance, and according to the general maxim of \u201clying\u201d the law prescribing lying would be false too.Footnote 73 Such a law would therefore contradict itself. Unlike in the case of the first argument, Simmel does not spare his praise from the second. He calls it \u201cKant's most important purely speculative thought . . . it is a truly superb idea that the intellectual coherence, the internally logical unity of our actions, constitutes the criterion of their moral value as well.\u201dFootnote 74 Simmel claims that in this argument \u201cthe Kantian intellectualism reveals itself as the ultimate authority of moral decisions too.\u201dFootnote 75 This determination of ethics by logic does not abolish Kant's moralism. On the contrary, Kant's intellectualism is the surest foundation of his moralism: \u201cas morality entered next to it as absolute value, a difficult dualism of the ultimate principles [Dualismus des Definitiven] would have emerged, which Kant solved by allowing the moral norm to be structured by logic.\u201dFootnote 76 Simmel's interpretation of Kant thus reaches its logical completeness. Kant's philosophical method, according to him, was based on attaining certainty by means of a radical synthesis of two seemingly opposing tendencies. Long before Kant, Simmel explained the way this synthesis worked separately within the world of knowledge and the world of action. Now it appears that a similar synthesis happens in Kant's thought as a whole. On an even higher level of abstraction, Kant's \u201cintellectualism\u201d seems to govern both his ethics and his epistemology, regardless of whether both these fields enjoy full autonomy or whether (as seems to be implied in Simmel's argument) Kant's philosophy tends towards the primacy of theoretical reason. Simmel offers this intellectualist reading of Kant with regard to other fields too, even if only in passing, since he focuses mainly on epistemology and ethics. Thus, in his discussion of Kant's theory of religion, he argues that, because of intellectualism, Kant \u201ccould not acknowledge religiosity as a unified structure, as an inclination with its own roots.\u201dFootnote 77 Rather (says Simmel in 1913), \u201creligion is to him a sum of theoretical conclusions from morality.\u201dFootnote 78 The same intellectualism is found in the field of aesthetics. The mind of the genius, argues Simmel, led Kant towards great insights about art and beauty. Yet these insights coexist with errors which sprang out of Kant's very limited knowledge of true art and his very limited ability for aesthetic feeling. Kant's aesthetic philosophy, even when true, was constructed by him not through a positive relation to aesthetic objects, \u201cbut only indirectly, because of the scientifically rational need to delimit with perfect precision the concept of the beautiful versus the sensually agreeable, the true and the morally good.\u201dFootnote 79 This intellectualistic interpretation was unusual in Simmel's time. It points to his profound disagreement with the approach of other neo-Kantians, especially the south-western school. Windelband once said (in 1881) that the significance of Kant in the history of philosophy consisted in his overcoming the entire philosophical tradition that had preceded him with its roots in ancient Greece. Greek civilization, in his view, was characterized by \u201cintellectualism,\u201d and thus Kant's achievement consisted in overcoming Greek intellectualism.Footnote 80 Later, Windelband retreated somewhat from this formulation. He spoke about \u201creason\u201d (Vernunft) as the basis on which Kant built his vision of all spheres.Footnote 81 But he used the word \u201creason\u201d in an ambiguous and broad sense. It apparently signified for him simply the absence of irrationality, without suggesting any strong \u201cintellectualistic\u201d connotations in the Simmelian sense. From a certain perspective, Simmel's position can be seen as being close to that of the Marburg school. Marburg scholars envisioned a narrower distance between different parts of Kant's philosophy and put a greater emphasis on the guiding role of logic. But Simmel differs from them in at least two important respects. First, unlike Cohen, he does not play with the idea of the primacy of practical reason. At most he assigns to each sphere equal standing, placing logic above them all, and on many occasions he sounds as if he puts the sphere of knowledge above those of ethics and aesthetics. He even seems to suggest at one point that Kant's theory of knowledge is the only truly satisfactory part of his teaching.Footnote 82 Second, and crucially, Kant's coherence and intellectualism were, for Simmel, a reason for reproach rather than praise. Precisely because Kant's world view was intellectualistic, it became inadequate for the day. The unity it entailed was one-sided, not comprehensive. This fully coherent intellectualism was not competent to deal with the true variety of modern experience. Here we come to the essence of Simmel's change in attitude. The young Simmel believed that Kant's philosophy was a peculiar mixture of coherence and open-endedness. It was coherent enough to serve as a basis for a unified world view and open-ended enough to enable the adjustment of this world view to new conditions. The principles of Kant's world view were, in fact, the only satisfactory ones for the purpose of forming unity out of modern variety; this was true both of epistemology and of ethics. In later years, however, Simmel began to regard Kant's world view as outdated. He still considered Kant's theory of knowledge as fairly adequate.Footnote 83 But he questioned Kant's ethics, arguing that intellectualism in it went far beyond its proper limits. The sphere of ethics belongs to life, he protested, and the norms of life cannot be reduced to the lifeless formulae of thought. In the 1913 edition of Kant Simmel added the following statement: Modern pragmatism, whatever else one may think about it, has at least seen that the limitations of the critique of reason and of the entire intellectualism lie in this: that knowledge, even if it is the Kantian enthronement of the empirical, cannot protect itself by itself when the question of legitimacy is addressed to experience, and hence it is only within the total structure of life that one should seek the other elements that provide such legitimization.Footnote 84 It was, of course, Simmel himself who almost two decades earlier (in 1895) had brought up the Kantian theory in the context of pragmatism.Footnote 85 As we have seen, in that early article Simmel argued that the truth of experience was dependent on the process of our biological evolution. Yet he did not think that this would make Kant's world view inadequate. On the contrary, he attempted to integrate Kant's philosophy into the general framework of pragmatist philosophy. Later, however, the gap between pragmatism and Kant became clear to him, as Kant was becoming more and more intellectualistic for him, and \u201clife\u201d more and more non-reflective. This led Simmel to realize that Kant's philosophy could not be modified or improved, and that it should rather be abandoned. He developed a peculiar philosophical standpoint which to a great extent can be identified as neo-Kantian, as it included a distinctively neo-Kantian emphasis on the variety of forms of experience, each governed by its own presuppositions. But this Simmelian \u201cneo-Kantianism\u201d was based on the conscious decision to repudiate Kant, something that other neo-Kantians were not prepared to do, or at least to admit to."}, {"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/neo-kantianism/notes.html", "page_content": "Notes to Neo-Kantianism\n\n1.

Please note that this article concerns what might be called \u201cclassical\u201d Neo-Kantianism: the self-identified philosophical schools of late nineteenth and early twentieth century Germany centered around Marburg and southwestern Germany. Many philosophers are \u201cneo-Kantian\u201d in the broader sense that they draw significant inspiration from aspects of Kant\u2019s philosophy: for instance, earlier nineteenth century philosophers such as Herbart or Schopenhauer were neo-Kantian in this broad sense, as were other philosophers contemporary with the classical Neo-Kantians\u2014for instance, Hans Vaihinger or Wilhelm Dilthey in Germany, Alois Riehl in Austria, \u00c9mile Boutroux or L\u00e9on Brunschvicg in France, and Robert Adamson or T.H.

There are principled reasons, articulated in section 1 of this article, for distinguishing the classical Neo-Kantians of the Marburg and SW schools from \u201cneo-Kantians\u201d in this broader sense. An article on neo-Kantianism in this broad sense would almost constitute a complete history of philosophy from Kant up into the twentieth century.\n\n3. Indeed, as Friedman (2000) argues, Neo-Kantianism is the common root out of which both the so-called \u201canalytic\u201d and \u201ccontinental\u201d traditions grew.\n\n4. Though the Southwest and Marburg Neo-Kantians did not initially present themselves as part of a common movement, this tendency softened among \u201cthird generation\u201d Neo-Kantians, i.e., the Neo-Kantians contemporary with Cassirer and Lask. For instance, the Neo-Kantians Bruno Bauch, Jonas Cohn, and Richard H\u00f6nigswald all freely borrowed from both schools and did not emphasize the differences between the schools so strongly.\n\n5. Citing the writings of the Neo-Kantians presents some serious challenges, since few of the key works have been translated in full into English, and many of these works went through many editions, which often differ significantly from one another. To address these difficulties, the following conventions are adopted. Whenever possible, passages are cited by section number or chapter (which are usually common between editions) instead of by page number. When citing page numbers, citations are from English translations whenever an English translation is listed in Bibliography. Otherwise, the page citation is to the original language edition cited in the Bibliography (unless an original language passage is being cited that is not translated in the listed translation: such cases are noted as they arise). Translations are from the cited translations, unless otherwise noted. Whenever possible, texts with English translations are referenced over texts that currently lack English translations, in order to aid the Anglophone reader. In particular, this entry aims to refer as much as possible to English-language editions that are widely available, such as the texts collected in the Neo-Kantian Reader [abbreviation: NKR] (Luft 2015).\n\n6. As Neo-Kantians were quick to point out, this is just Kant\u2019s old point: there is a difference between a question of fact (quid facti) and a question of justification (quid juris), between an empirical deduction that shows how we humans come to acquire some representation and transcendental deduction that shows its justification (Kant 1781/7: A84-5/B116-7). (Citations to Kant 1781/87 are according to the pagination in the first (\u201cA\u201d) and second (\u201cB\u201d) edition. Page references to Kant\u2019s other works are to the pagination in the Akademie [Ak] edition: Kant 1902\u2013.)\n\n7. In this respect, the Neo-Kantians followed the lead of Kant himself. In the first Critique, Kant himself characterized mathematics not in terms of its object (number and extensive magnitude), but in terms of its method (the construction of concepts). In the third Critique, Kant claims that biology is unique because of its method: the use of teleological judgments. And according to the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science, physics is distinctive because it delivers properly scientific knowledge by allowing for the right kind of application of mathematics.\n\n8. In this way, again, they were following Kant, whose argument in the first Critique for the objective validity of the categories utilized a more general account of the objective validity of all knowledge.\n\n9. After his retirement from Marburg in 1912, Cohen wrote a series of books in the philosophy of religion, articulating a vision of Judaism as a \u201creligion of reason\u201d, an \u201cethical monotheism\u201d. Cohen\u2019s book The Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Monotheism (1919) is perhaps the most significant book in Jewish thought written in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and is surely (in terms of intellectual and real world impact) the most significant book produced by the Marburg Neo-Kantians. But its relations to the core doctrines of the Marburg school are indirect, and so it is not discussed in this article.\n\n10. The academic fate of the Marburg School, unfortunately, was significantly impacted by the rising tide of German anti-Semitism. Cohen was an observant Jew, and his promotion in Marburg in 1876 was made possible by a brief window of tolerance in German politics. The Marburg School was often subjected to thinly-veiled, and often even overt, anti-Semitic attacks. As institutional anti-Semitism hardened, Cohen had more difficulty placing his students, to the point that Cassirer had to struggle to find an institution that would accept his two volume Problem of Knowledge as a Habilitation. He eventually habilitated in Berlin, but was prevented from holding a professorship until after the war, when official discrimination was lessened in the Weimar Republic. (Because Cassirer was unable to hold a professorship, Hans Reichenbach, who took courses with him and always considered him his teacher, was forced to officially submit his dissertation under a different supervisor outside of Berlin.) Cassirer finally held a position in Hamburg in 1919, and indeed was the rector of the university in 1929\u201330, the first Jewish rector of a German university. But all of this collapsed in 1933 when Hitler was appointed Chancellor, and Cassirer was forced to flee the country.\n\n11. In keeping with the Marburg tendency, the progressive development of culture is understood very abstractly, and not as historical or temporal. Natorp\u2019s model is the progression from a number to its successor in the natural number sequence: the progression is not temporal or arbitrary, but is grounded in a law, i.e., the axioms of arithmetic (1910: Ch.1, \u00a75).\n\n12. There are a few reasons for this distinctive method. First, the transcendental method requires an initial stage of \u201cdata collection\u201d, in which the goal is to lay out the detailed, concrete features of some area of culture, along with its historical development. To give systematic philosophical theories without first canvassing the history of the topic would amount to trying to carry out the second step of the transcendental method without the first. Second, the transcendental method prescribes that philosophical reflection not be done in isolation from the facts of culture. For this reason, the Marburg philosophers were keen to show that the core doctrines of past philosophers were in fact developed in continual conversation with other areas of culture, in particular with natural science. This way of doing history of philosophy\u2014where the history of philosophy and the history of science are presented together as one narrative\u2014culminated in Cassirer\u2019s Problem of Knowledge. Third, the transcendental method (unlike the method of speculative idealism) is not foundationalist, but requires that philosophical reflection start up only after an area of culture has reached a stage of maturity where it can be self-reflective. Philosophy, then, always begins \u201cin the middle\u201d.\n\n13. In his later book on quantum mechanics, Determinism and Indeterminism in the Philosophy of Physics, Cassirer argues (1936: Ch.12) that the real philosophical significance of QM is not its conflict with an alleged classical conception of causality, but rather its requirement that we rethink what it is to be an individual particle in a determinate state (and thus rethink the concepts substance and accident), given superposition and Heisenberg uncertainty.\n\n14. Cohen (1898) recognized this possibility in his discussion of Hertz, since he allows that all three of the rival foundations for mechanics are equally consistent with the empirical data. Cassirer (1921: 354) later cited Einstein\u2019s special theory and Lorentz\u2019s theory as rival theories, the choice of which could not be decided on the basis of experiments alone.\n\n15. Interestingly, Cassirer argues (1921: Ch.2) that Einstein\u2019s principle of general covariance is supported by such a regulative principle. By requiring that the laws of nature be the same for any observer, whether the observer be at rest, undergoing inertial motion, or even accelerated motion, Einstein\u2019s theory accords with the general demand that scientific laws be \u201cde-anthropologized\u201d and thus made fully objective (see Ryckman 2005: 45).\n\n16. Lask self-consciously aligned himself with the Southwest school, and defended their core commitment, that the subject matter of philosophy is validity. However, he was in many ways an internal critic, who incorporated many of the ideas of Husserl\u2019s Logical Investigations (Husserl 1900). See below, section 3.2.\n\n17. Rickert put this idea more sharply by distinguishing two kinds of generality of values. A value is \u201cfactually general\u201d if it is held by all humans (or all members of the relevant community); a value is normatively general if its \u201crecognition is in fact required of all members of a certain community\u201d (Rickert 1902: 376).\n\n18. In Rickert\u2019s The Object of Knowledge (Rickert 1915: 47, Chapter I, \u00a77: \u201cDas erkenntnistheoretische Subjekt\u201d), and in Windelband\u2019s later writings (1910: 319), the notion of a \u201cnormal\u201d consciousness is expressed using Kant\u2019s famous phrase \u201cconsciousness in general\u201d from the Prolegomena (Kant 1783: \u00a720; Ak 4:300). There, Kant argued that there is a difference between \u201cjudgments of perception\u201d, which are subjectively valid and express only a consciousness of my own state, and \u201cjudgments of experience\u201d, which are objectively valid and express a connection \u201cin consciousness in general\u201d. Rickert and Windelband self-consciously echo this argument, interpreting Kant\u2019s distinction as a fact/value distinction: consciousness in general is what ought to be judged, not what in fact I do judge.\n\n19. This claim that every universally valid norm has an a priori basis is made the defining feature of Neo-Kantianism in Anderson 2005. It may be more accurate to restrict this to SW Neo-Kantianism, since the fact/value distinction is not thematized by the Marburg Neo-Kantians. This defining claim can again be extracted from Kant\u2019s discussion of \u201cconsciousness in general\u201d, given the SW Neo-Kantians\u2019 reading of this as a normative consciousness. In Prolegomena \u00a720, Kant argues that the ascent from consciousness of my own state to consciousness in general requires certain special a priori concepts, the categories. SW Neo-Kantianism takes on this idea as well, again interpreted normatively.\n\n20. Lask is echoing Kant\u2019s famous analogy between what Copernicus accomplished in astronomy and what he takes himself to have accomplished in metaphysics: Kant 1781/7: Bxvi\u2013xvii.\n\n21. Rickert replies to this criticism from Lask in Rickert 1915: 282.\n\n22. An excellent presentation and interpretation of Lask\u2019s very difficult theory is Emundts 2008.\n\n23. Since truth becomes a kind of correspondence, Lask holds that there needs to be some way of cognizing the object, prior to the act of judging, which furnishes that against which the content of the judgment can be compared. This kind of cognition, which is passive and prior to any act of judging, Lask calls \u201cHingabe\u201d [abandonment] (Lask 1912: 135, Ch.2, \u00a72). In so doing, Lask is rejecting a fundamental Neo-Kantian commitment that all cognizing is judging. (Compare Rickert 1915: 168: \u201cErkennen ist immer Urteilen\u201d.) In accepting the correspondence theory in Die Lehre vom Urteil, Lask is also departing from his own view in Lask 1911, where he rejected the correspondence theory.\n\n24. On this issue: see Beiser 2014a: Ch.4. On the place of SW Neo-Kantianism in this debate, and for an excellent treatment of the philosophy of history of SW Neo-Kantians, see Beiser 2011:, Chs. 9\u201311.\n\n25. Of course, Windelband (as well as Rickert) were quite clear that a historian conducting her research will need to make use of general propositions from nomothetic sciences, just as nomothetic scientists can make use of results of idiographic sciences and can even make claims about singular things (e.g., the Milky Way, the Triassic period). Nevertheless, there is still a fundamental difference in the goals of the two kinds of sciences.\n\n26. Windelband\u2019s resistance to this positivist reductionism is another example of the non-revisionism intrinsic to the transcendental method: recognizing the autonomy of history is simply recognizing the way the best contemporary historians were in fact doing their research.\n\n27. Windelband\u2019s claim that psychology is nomothetic is opposed to the Marburg view that psychology is the science of the subjective, and so is not nomothetic. On the Marburg view of psychology, see the Supplement, Philosophy of Psychology in the Marburg School.\n\n28. On the debate between Dilthey and Windelband and Rickert, see Makkreel 2010 and Makkreel & Luft 2010. Partially in response to Windelband\u2019s criticisms, Dilthey 1894 introduces his well-known distinction between explanation and interpretation (or understanding), arguing that the Geisteswissenschaften depend, not on \u201cmechanical\u201d psychology, which \u201cexplains\u201d mental phenomena in the nomothetic way Windelband identified, but on \u201cdescriptive\u201d psychology, which \u201cinterprets\u201d or \u201cunderstands\u201d some mental phenomenon. This view is like the SW view, in distinguishing history from the natural sciences in terms of a distinctive method. For Rickert\u2019s criticism of this more mature Diltheyan position, see Rickert 1902: 369.\n\n29. Here, Rickert is drawing on the view that the content of an intuition is always potentially infinitely complex, and it is the work of a concept to select out (in accordance with certain a priori norms) certain features. See section 3.2.\n\n30. Rickert also clearly articulated two other senses of \u201cgenerality\u201d that are at play in the formation of the concepts of history. The concept of Caesar, though it only applies to one individual, Caesar, is nevertheless composed of general concepts (such as being Roman, being a soldier, being assassinated). The concept of Caesar ought also be integrated into a more \u201cgeneral\u201d historical nexus, say, through showing its relation to the concept of the Late Roman Empire. In this sense, one historical individual, Caesar, is part of a larger historical individual, the Late Roman Empire.\n\n31. Rickert makes his point with some care. Of course, even natural scientists are sensitive to values, inasmuch as they are concerned with truth; but only in history do we form concepts constrained by those features of a subject that are value-relevant. Furthermore, the historian is making theoretical claims, not aesthetic or practical claims. Everyone can agree that Goethe is a historical individual, and that certain facts about him are historically relevant, whether or not one happens to like his poetry, approve of his character, or even have any personal attachment to German culture. The historian qua historian does not make determinate value judgments about her subjects. (Still less should historians argue that history acts teleologically to realize certain values, such as freedom, reason, or the will of God.)"}]}
