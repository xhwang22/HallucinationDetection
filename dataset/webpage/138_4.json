She has appeared in a variety of productions, films, and television shows, sharing the spotlight with her brilliant co-stars and sharing her talent with the world. Her filmography is impressive and shows off her stunning range as a performer, lending her voice to animated films and shows as well as showing just how far she can push herself in most serious roles, too.\n\nBorn on April 2, 1945, in Morristown, New Jersey, Hunt was raised in Westport, Connecticut. She is one of two children to her parents and grew up enjoying the arts and participating in them. Taking a leap of faith, Hunt went forward with pursuing her passion for acting, and it\u2019s safe to say that all of her hard work and dedication has truly paid off.\n\nWhile Hunt has appeared in many productions throughout her lifetime, one of her most notable and recognizable roles was as Hetty Lange on the television show \u201cNCIS: Los Angeles.\u201d She appeared on the show for 12 seasons and even made a guest appearance later on. Fans grew to not only love the character but also love Hunt as an actress.\n\nShe has gone on to be nominated and win several awards throughout the course of her career, earning her recognition amongst critics and fans alike. Hunt has also shared some insights into both her personal and professional life, including her actual height and what her family is really like.

Her father, Raymond, was the vice president of Harper Fuel Oil, while her mother, Elsie, was a piano teacher. They were very encouraging of their daughter\u2019s ambitions.\n\nHunt became completely mesmerized by the idea of becoming an actress after seeing a stage performance of \u201cPeter Pan\u201d during her childhood, according to Britannica. She was so determined to make her dreams come true that she began pursuing her passion by implementing it into her studies and attended the Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan as well as the Goodman School of Drama in Chicago.\n\nShe focused heavily on directing since it seemed like her physical frame was limiting her opportunities as an actress. According to Britannica, Hunt had hypopituitary dwarfism and was not conventionally beautiful, and her appearance was something that sadly held her back. Hunt has a short height, standing at 4 feet 9 inches tall.\n\nHunt, fortunately, made her dreams a reality and began appearing in stage productions and Broadway shows during the 1970s. In 1982, Hunt made her mark on the entertainment industry by portraying a male character named Billy Kawn in \u201cThe Year of Living Dangerously,\u201d earning plenty of praise and recognition for the complex and dramatic role.\n\nThe role even earned her her first Academy Award, making her the first person to win an Oscar for playing a character of the opposite sex, according to Britannica.

Hetty is the Supervisory Special Agent and Operations Manager of the Office of Special Projects who embark on dangerous missions and cares deeply for others.\n\nIt seems like Hunt pulled from her personal life to add some genuineness to her character as she has proved time and again to be a kind-hearted individual. Although Hunt has kept much of her private life out of the public eye, relishing in the personal moments she gets to share with her loved ones; she has shared a few details about her relationships. She has been in a long-lasting relationship with psychotherapist Karen Kline since 1978. The two tied the knot in 2008.\n\nHunt has also served as an ambassador for the Best Friends Animal Society since 2011 and is a supporter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, according to Celebrity Net Worth. It\u2019s clear that Hunt has had a very successful relationship as well as a brilliant career. According to Celebrity Net Worth, her net worth is estimated at $12 million. She earned $80,000 per episode of \u201cNCIS: Los Angeles,\u201d totaling to about $2 million per year before royalties.\n\nAt 76 years old, Hunt can easily say she has accomplished a lot in her life and has become a true inspiration to any aspiring actor.

But did that include Hetty? Find out!\n\nCaution: This article has SPOILERS for the series finale of NCIS: Los Angeles.\n\nThe conclusion of the two part finale had the team quickly settling a case of smuggling and dirty cops. They then turned to the long-awaited wedding of Callen and Anna. The pair decided that rather than a huge fancy and expensive wedding, they\u2019d simply get hitched at a local courthouse that very day.\n\nThe wedding went off without a hitch as the team celebrated. Meanwhile, Kensi and Deeks were rocked by the unexpected news that Kensi was pregnant. Roundtree decided to accept a settlement in his suit against the LAPD and everyone seemed happy.\n\nJust as the wedding was wrapping up, Callen got a letter from Hetty saying she wished she could be there and how much she counted the team as family. However, she hinted she was in some sort of danger and left two tickets to Morocco to find her.\n\nJetting over, Callen and Sam found a camp run by former colleague Nell Jones (Renee Felice Smith), who was leading a makeshift team of former ally Nate (Peter Cambor), troublesome CIA officer Sabatino (Erik Palladino) and a \u201cnew guy\u201d played by Chris O\u2019Donnell\u2019s real-life son, Chip. They explained Hetty was in trouble and the series ended with Callen and Sam off to find her.\n\nSo why did Linda Hunt not make a live appearance on the show?\n\nWhy was Linda Hunt absent from the NCIS: Los Angeles finale?\n\nWhile a major presence for most of the show\u2019s run, Hetty has been absent for the last few seasons. A key reason was Linda Hunt was wary of traveling to Los Angeles for filming during the Covid-19 pandemic. The series has explained it as Hetty off on one of her mysterious missions.\n\nSpeaking to TV Line, showrunner R. Scott Gemmill explained that they had scripted the finale on the idea of Hetty making a surprise appearance, but it simply came down to Linda Hunt being unavailable.\n\n\u201cIt was sort of a touch-and-go situation. Had we had another season, or even this season, I really hoped that if Linda had been available, that\u2019s probably what the finale would have been \u2014 our guys going to pull her butt out of the fire. But it just wasn\u2019t in the cards. So, we mixed it up with having them going [to Morocco] thinking they may find Hetty, and instead there\u2019s a surprise with finding Nell in her stead.\u201d\n\nIt would have been fun to finally see Hunt back on screen, but sadly for fans, the timing just wasn\u2019t right. Thus, NCIS: Los Angeles ends with Callen and Sam on another adventure to find their mentor, who likely is as tough as ever.\n\nNCIS: Los Angeles seasons 1-14 are streaming on Paramount+."}, {"url": "https://www.looper.com/623759/how-much-does-linda-hunt-really-make-as-hetty-on-ncis-la/", "page_content": "Cookies help us deliver our Services.

Ironically, or perhaps consequently, Hunt grew up an unusual overachiever, undaunted by her condition. She took her first stab at acting at age 12 while performing in a production of \"Flibbertigibbet\" at Westport's famed Silver Nutmeg Theater. Hunt moved to New York in the mid-1960s, where she found consistent work in summer stock theater. Concerned that her unusual physical type would limit her future as an actress, Hunt initially focused on becoming a stage director. But the lure of acting proved too powerful to resist, so in 1969, Hunt returned to Westport to study acting under dramatic coach, Robert Lewis.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Hunt began a longtime association with the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven. Her one-woman show based on the life of Joan of Arc won the actress rave reviews and even flickers of interest from Broadway. A year later, Hunt went to New York City and made her off-Broadway debut as the Player Queen in the New York Shakespeare Festival's production of \"Hamlet\" in Central Park. This led to Hunt's first major role as the Irish maid Nora in a 1973 production of Eugene O'Neill's play, \"Ah, Wilderness!\" Originally directed by Arvin Brown for the Long Wharf Theatre, the play eventually moved to the Circle-in-the-Square Theatre along the Great White Way in New York, where it was taped for airing as a PBS special, \"Theater In America\" (1976). Hunt's screen career began in the late 1970s, when she made her television debut in a \"Hallmark Hall of Fame\" presentation of Arthur Miller's \"Fame\" (CBS, 1979). Adapted for the screen by the playwright himself, it was noteworthy that Miller specifically created Hunt's role of Mona with the actress in mind.\n\nThe following year, Hunt made her official big screen debut in Robert Altman's bloated and ultimately failed musical, \"Popeye\" (1980). Cast in a small supporting role as the feisty Mrs. Oxheart, Hunt's appearance was a fortunately forgettable cameo lost in an even more forgettable film that dogged stars Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall for years to come. Her next film, however, permanently changed her career. Tapped to co-star in the controversial drama \"The Year of Living Dangerously,\" Hunt joined burgeoning young actors Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver in director Peter Weir's complex drama. Based on a novel of the same name by Christopher Koch, the film told the complicated tale of an Australian journalist caught at the center of a foreign country's political overthrow. Based on the real-life events of the attempted 1965 coup of Jakarta by Indonesia's Communist party, \"Dangerously\" earned Hunt an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Eurasian photographer, Billy Kwan. The first actor to ever win an Oscar for playing a role of the opposite gender, Hunt's record stood untouched until 1999, when Hilary Swank won an Oscar for \"Boys Don't Cry.\"\n\nDespite her formidable talent, however, Hunt hit the proverbial glass ceiling. Though she remained consistently employed on stage - even winning two Obies and a Tony nomination in the 1980s and 1990s - the pedigree of her film work had slipped. Still, Hunt's presence in movies managed to endure throughout this period. Among her higher profile roles were supporting turns in such critical favorites as \"Silverado\" (1985), in which she played Stella, a genial saloon proprietor, and the blockbuster comedy, \"Kindergarten Cop\" (1990), portraying a school principle disapproving of a rough-and-tumble cop (Arnold Schwarzenegger) going undercover as a kindergarten teacher to capture a wanted fugitive. In 1993, Hunt briefly returned to television, starring in the ill-fated space opera, \"Space Rangers\" (CBS, 1993), which was cancelled after just six episodes. After a brief dormancy in the mid-to late 1990s, during which time she only appeared in the horror dud, \"The Relic\" (1997), Hunt's career underwent something of a renaissance when she turned to television. In 1997, Hunt created the role of Judge Zoey Hiller on David E. Kelly's long-running legal dramedy, \"The Practice.\" A favorite recurring character for the show's fans, Hunt reprised the role more than two dozen times before the show finally adjourned its run.\n\nIn 2003, Hunt joined the cast of the HBO drama \"Carnivale\" (HBO, 2003-05) for a 10-episode run as the mysterious voice of Management. In 2005, actress Hunt added an unlikely new credit to her resume: video game icon. As the resonant, authoritative voice of the Narrator for the award-winning \"God of War\" video game series, Hunt gained a whole new generation of fans unfamiliar with her acting work. Hunt reprised the voiceover role for the game's sequel, \"God of War 2.\" Following a long vacation away from features, Hunt finally returned to the big screen with the blended family comedy \"Yours, Mine, and Ours\" (2005), starring Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo. While her role was hardly much of a challenge for the actress, the movie did at least allow Hunt a rare opportunity to flex her comedic muscles. Her next project continued in the same vein, as Dr. Mittag-Leffler in director Marc Forster's twisted comedy, \"Stranger than Fiction\" (2006) starring Will Ferrell and Emma Thompson. After building a second career voicing narration for numerous PBS specials, including \"Secrets of the Ocean Realm\" (1997), \"Woodrow Wilson\" (2002) and \"Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State\" (2004), Hunt joined the cast of the successful spin-off series, \"NCIS: Los Angeles\" (CBS, 2009- ), playing OSP Operations Manager Henrietta Lange."}, {"url": "https://www.thelist.com/649675/how-linda-hunt-made-acting-history/", "page_content": "How Linda Hunt Made Acting History\n\nWhile \"NCIS: LA\" fans know Linda Hunt for her role as Hetty Lange, they might not realize that the actress had a renowned acting career long before she joined the cast of the successful CBS drama. Raised in Connecticut, Hunt was bitten by the performing bug after seeing a performance of \"Peter Pan\" on Broadway. \"It was bigger than life. And that in some sense, I longed to be bigger than life, because I wasn't,\" Hunt \u2014 who has a condition known as hypopituitary dwarfism \u2014 told CBS News.\n\nWorried that she wouldn't be able to find work because of her height, Hunt focused on directing as a student at the Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan and at the Goodman School of Drama in Chicago (via Britannica). But she was destined to become an actor, and went on to land a part on Broadway in 1975 in Eugene O'Neill's \"Ah, Wilderness!\" before making her movie debut in Robert Altman's \"Popeye\" opposite the late Robin Williams. \"My acting coach reminded me again about the importance of acting in my life and the knowledge that this was my gift,\" Hunt revealed to The Bulletin. \"I had lost myself for a while, and that awareness gave me back to myself.\"\n\nAnd her big break was just around the corner \u2014 one that would lead her to make Oscar history."}]}
