Homicide also ushered in a new look for Australian television.\n\nIt presented audiences with a different, more factual view of Australia than anything previously released.\n\n\u201cThe recipe for success was, there must be a body, two or more suspects and plenty of clues,\u201d said Monte Miller \u2013 one of many scriptwriters who worked on the show.\n\nThe proof was in the pudding. The hatted heroes of Homicide were arresting enough (sorry) to make this the first locally made drama to rate in the Australian TV Top Ten.\n\nCrawfords (who produced this show and a number of other Australian police dramas) had developed a close relationship with the Victoria Police while producing radio serials, and this relationship continued with Homicide.\n\nReal policemen were, in fact, seconded to the production company as technical consultants, and Victoria Police sponsored the programme for the first year as a public relations exercise.\n\nThe original cast included Jack Fegan as Inspector Connolly, Terry McDermott as Detective Sergeant Bronson, and Lex Mitchell as Detective Fraser.\n\nLater, when the show was at its peak, the top cops were Alwyn Kurts as Inspector Fox, Leonard Teale as Detective Sergeant Mackay, Norman Yemm as Senior Constable Patterson and George Mallaby as Detective Barnes.\n\nHeading up the final Homicide team was Charles \u2018Bud\u2019 Tingwell, Gary Day, Don Barker and Dennis Grosvenor.\n\nWith limited budgets (compared to the American cop shows they were up against) many of the actors performed most of their own stunts.\n\nTerry McDermott \u2013 who played Detective Sergeant Frank Bronson from 1964 to 1966 \u2013 recalled some instances while filming around Melbourne: \u201cOnce we were filming around the old Nylex sign on the corner of Punt Road and the freeway, and we had to climb right out on the scaffolding to bring back a boy who was threatening to commit suicide. It looked dangerous \u2013 that\u2019s because it was dangerous!\u201d\n\nThe location shooting made the series very good to look at, though, typically with small-time crooks being pursued by the boys in blue, down grotty back streets and alleyways with the griminess of the setting echoing the griminess of the crime.\n\nMcDermott again: \u201cWe once did a boat chasing sequence and, of course, we didn\u2019t have a boat. We were lucky enough to come across some people who were water skiing and they let us borrow their boat. We used it for most of the day, and they were really good sports\u201d.\n\nThe evolution of Homicide\u2019s production values over its 12 years reflects the development of Australian television. It went from black-and-white to colour and limited sound to full sound.\n\nAlthough, in a move that wasn\u2019t typical of all series at the time, Homicide shifted to an all-film production when it changed to colour, apparently due to a delay in Seven\u2019s colour video facilities being ready.\n\nDetective Fraser\n\nLex Mitchell\n\nDS Frank Bronson\n\nTerry McDermott\n\nInspector Connolly\n\nJack Fegan\n\nSnr Detective Mackay\n\nLeonard Teale\n\nDetective Hudson\n\nLes Dayman\n\nInspector Colin Fox\n\nAlwyn Kurts\n\nSnr Detective Barnes\n\nGeorge Mallaby\n\nDetective Patterson\n\nNorman Yemm\n\nDetective Radford\n\nGary Day\n\nInspector Lawson\n\nCharles Tingwell\n\nSgt White\n\nDon Barker"}, {"url": "https://666how.com/how-old-is-tristan-rogers/", "page_content": "Tristan Rogers is an actor best known for his role as Robert Scorpio on the ABC soap opera General Hospital.

The popularity and longevity of the character Robert Scorpio in General Hospital came as a result of his involvement with the monumentally popular \"supercouple\" Luke and Laura, whose 1981 wedding brought in 30 million viewers and remains the highest-rated hour in American soap opera history.\n\nWhile Rogers' Scorpio had been \"killed with no body found\" when he left the series in 1992, Rogers returned briefly in 1995 as Scorpio's spirit to comfort the character's daughter Robin Scorpio (Kimberly McCullough), who is dealing with the loss of her boyfriend to an AIDS-related illness and is herself HIV-positive. He returned again in January 2006 for six weeks, this time with Scorpio being very much alive.

Playing Robert Scorpio, a sophisticated and savvy operative for the World Security Bureau, Rogers was teamed up with the most famous couple in the world at that time -\"GH\" lovers Luke and Laura - to help save the world from being frozen solid. He went on to become one of the soap world's most iconic actors, even long after he had left the show and moved on to other endeavors.\n\nBorn June 3, 1946 in Melbourne, Australia, the young Rogers never seriously considered acting as a career. After starting a rock group with some friends in 1964, he learned to love the good life so much that a regular desk job was not for him. His music career evolved into acting, more out of laziness than ambition. After landing acting gigs on Australian television series such as \"Bellbird\" (1967-1977) and \"The Link Men\" (1970), Rogers made the big leap across the pond to Hollywood. Back in the pre-Aussie invasion days, actors from down under were told to lose their accent or never work. Rogers promptly worked on losing the accent. When he booked \"GH,\" however, he was told to keep it, making him the first foreigner to hit it big on a U.S. soap using his native accent.\n\nFew actors met with immediate success the way Rogers did when he joined \"GH\" as agent Robert Scorpio. His participation, along with Luke (Anthony Geary) and Laura (Genie Francis), in possibly the show's most famous storyline - the Ice Princess caper - sealed the deal with fans who were not used to such a unique accent nor such take-charge masculinity in their soap idols. Rogers became so popular, that when couple du jour Geary and Francis left the show in 1983, the Aussie assumed the full mantel of the show's premiere leading man. First, he romanced Luke's left-behind love, Holly Sutton (Emma Samms) to the delight of fans. Even more popular was his teaming with ex-wife Anna Devane (Finola Hughes). The two actors remained in the forefront of the show's storytelling canvas until 1992 when Scorpio and Anna were presumed killed in a boat explosion. In 1995, Rogers briefly reprised Scorpio in a series of dream sequences experienced by the character's daughter Robin and his old pal Luke. But as far as Rogers was concerned, his days of Robert Scorpio were behind him forever.\n\nFree from the daily grind and stifling fame of \"GH,\" Rogers worked steadily in prime time television. He made appearances on the series \"Walker, Texas Ranger\" in 1993, \"Babylon 5\" in 1994 and \"V.I.P\" in 1999. Rogers lent his distinctive accent for the animated TV series \"The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest\" in 1996 and \"Batman Beyond\" in 2000. He had also performed voice over for the feature film, \"The Rescuers Down Under\" (1990).\n\nIn 1997, Rogers appeared in and produced the Showtime series \"Fast Track,\" which delved into the world of race car drivers. Rogers enjoyed producing, but continued to act, too, appearing on \"The Quality of Mercy,\" and \"Family Law.\" \"GH\" was not the star's only soap opera - he was cast as private eye Hunter Jones on \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" in 1997.\n\nIn January 2006, the star created headlines for the first time in years when ABC announced that he would be reprising his role as Scorpio for a six-week sweeps arc on \"General Hospital.\" Viewers learned that Scorpio indeed had survived the boat explosion and was recruited by former employer, the WSB, to become a hired assassin. Rogers was reunited with Geary and Samms during his brief return. It was so successful that ABC announced the Australian actor would return for more episodes in May, as would Hughes and Samms, so as to mix it up love-triangle style."}], "Tristan Rogers appeared in the Australian television series Division 4.": [{"url": "https://www.betaseries.com/en/person/100275-tristan-rogers", "page_content": "Tristan Rogers\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\n\n\nTristan Rogers (born 3 June 1946 in Melbourne) is an Australian\u2013American actor.\n\n\n\nHe is best known for playing Robert Scorpio on the ABC soap opera General Hospital and for voicing Jake in Walt Disney Pictures' The Rescuers Down Under.

But some of the Nohrin, led by would-be conqueror Sedessa, believe in the superiority of their own race and try to take land away from the Lokni. The parents of Delgo, a Lokni, are killed in the resulting conflict. Nohrin King Zahn is horrified by the war and admonishes Sedessa, who then poisons the Queen and almost kills Zahn as well. She is subsequently banished, and her wings are clipped off. Delgo, meanwhile, is raised by Elder Marley, who tries to teach him how to use the power of magical stones. Once Delgo grows up, however, he gives in to his desire for revenge against the Nohrin as a whole. But then he meets Princess Kyla of the Nohrin and develops a tentative friendship with her. When she is kidnapped by Nohrin General Raius, who is actually working for Sedessa, Delgo and his friend Filo are blamed and arrested. In the Nohrin prison, Delgo meets Nohrin General Bogardus, who was forced to illegally gamble with his weapons by Raius, because Bogardus opposed an all out war with the Lokni. Delgo, Filo, and Bogardus escape into some underground caverns and eventually reach Sedessa's stronghold and rescue Kyla. Together they hurry back to try to stop the war from taking place. They are too late, for the war has already begun. Bogardus meanwhile fights and defeats Raius, but is soon after mortally injured.\n\n, 1h34Nohrin Officer43%"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/tristan-rogers/", "page_content": "Tristan Rogers (born 3 June 1946) is an Australian-American actor.
