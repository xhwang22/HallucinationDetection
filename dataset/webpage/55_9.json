{"The National Center for Learning Disabilities is a non-profit organization.": [{"url": "https://www.ncld.org/", "page_content": "To the learning disabled community, and our allies,\n\nOur students are in a mental health crisis, one that disproportionately impacts students with learning disabilities. A 2019 CDC report indicated 33% of high school students experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness. This number jumped to 44% during the pandemic. For those of us in the learning disability community, mental health issues permeate our everyday lives. The limited research we have supports a strong correlation between learning disabilities and mental health disorders. For example, one study found that individuals with learning disabilities report mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation at twice the rate of their non-disabled peers, even controlling for possible confounding factors. Another meta-analytic study shows varying rates of comorbidity, from 8% to 46.3%, for ADHD and anxiety among students with LD.\n\nYet, the causal relationship between mental health and learning disabilities is still poorly understood. The topic of mental health rates in the LD community came up time and time again in conversations among our Young Adult Leadership Council members, where for many of us mental health struggles are woven throughout our LD stories. We write this letter first as a note of acknowledgement to the LD community, second to bring awareness of this issue to a broader global community, and third to call in parents, teachers, policy makers, and researchers to help us address this issue.\n\nGenerally, poor mental health is associated with challenges with decision making, difficulty in school, difficulty forming positive relationships, and other risky or potentially harmful behaviors. Dual-disability diagnoses present even greater challenges, as many experience persistent stress, anxiety,, trauma, bullying, internalizing problems, and feelings of social isolation as they navigate a world with learning disabilities and mental health disorders. These negative experiences are especially concerning when you consider that almost one-third of incarcerated individuals report having a learning disability, and mental health issues affect approximately half of the incarcerated populations.\n\n\u201cNot being diagnosed until recently as an adult, I never understood why I struggled like I did. However, after my diagnosis, I realized that my anxiety and depressive episodes contributed to my perfectionism and impulsive choices. Undiagnosed individuals with ADHD face the harsh reality of being prone to depression and anxiety. It could lead someone to a pathway of substance abuse and impulsive decision making that can have serious consequences. When you live in a world where people don\u2019t understand individuals with attention issues, it can make you feel like something is inherently wrong with you, which can also contribute to depression.\u201d\n\n\u2014Misha Nicholas\n\nWe know that students with LD report more issues with mental health. However, that is the extent of the research. We do not know the cause of these lower mental health rates in students with learning disabilities. Anecdotal reports by students with LD suggest that many experience educational trauma. We need research in order to know the extent and impact of this educational trauma. Is educational trauma a risk factor for poor mental health?\n\nAs members and activists on the National Center for Learning Disabilities\u2019 Young Adult Leadership Council (YALC), we feel it is imperative to kick-start a solution-driven mental health initiative focused on the intersectionality of learning disabilities and mental health disorders. Many of us navigate life as learning disabled people struggling with mental health. Research suggests that promoting a sense of belonging and peer social support within schools can protect learning disabled individuals from many documented negative outcomes. Yet, many of us experienced various forms of educational trauma throughout education in the form of persistent academic failure, feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, bullying, social isolation, and ridicule. Educational trauma refers to the perpetual pattern of harmful cycles within educational systems that detrimentally affect academic and emotional outcomes.\n\n\u201cThe humiliation, bullying, and systematic exclusion was shattering beyond words. Eventually the educational trauma I experienced became a bigger barrier to learning than my actual learning disability.\u201d\n\n\u2014Erin\n\nMany young adults with learning disabilities describe their K\u201312 educational experiences as traumatic. They describe feelings of being misunderstood. Often, they report that those around them failed to understand their learning and mental health struggles, as they lacked the words to describe the shame they felt to the adults and peers in their lives. These struggles span well beyond weaknesses in reading, writing, and math. Mental health and learning disabilities are interwoven, and these challenges follow learning disabled individuals as they transition out of high school and into postsecondary education and the workplace.\n\n\u201cIt was not until undergrad that I learned that it isn\u2019t normal to feel like you can\u2019t breathe every time before attempting homework.\u201d\n\n\u2014Stevie Mays\n\nMany learning disabled people report feeling unsafe and like they do not belong in the classroom. In talking with almost any learning disabled person, they will tell you that their learning disability has impacted them far beyond just their struggle with learning skills like math and reading. They will tell you that existing as a learning disabled person impacts one\u2019s whole experience with the world, how the world interacts with them, and how they interact with the world. Yes, it\u2019s important for us to help LD students in academic areas like reading and writing. But if we fail to look beyond academics, at the whole person, we miss an entire aspect of the learning disabled experience. We miss what it actually means to exist as a learning disabled person.\n\n\u201cAt age 16, as everyone around me wrote in fine penmanship, I felt like a child still writing with red crayon. It didn\u2019t matter what or how well I wrote \u2013 I wasn\u2019t allowed to belong.\u201d\n\n\u2014Brody\n\nWhat are you doing personally to better understand and address the experiences of the learning disabled community and why our peers are pushed out of schools, into the prison system, into low-wage careers, and, in the best case, into college settings that don\u2019t support us?\n\nWe need to talk about mental illness for what it is: a disability. A disability that deserves the same support and focus as dyslexia, ADHD, and other learning disabilities.\n\nOur dyslexia, anxiety, ADHD, depression, dysgraphia, PTSD, and more are disabilities that need support, understanding, and recognition. Many of us on the YALC say that finding the LD community was the key to us feeling like we finally understood ourselves and were able to come out of our shame. We found strength in our shared experiences and were able to name many of our experiences for what they were: educational trauma. In doing so we found our voice, not only to share our stories but to advocate for our community as a whole.\n\nTo the LD person reading this, we see and empathize with your struggles. We encourage you to seek out your LD community and embrace your disability identity. The disability label (including mental health and learning disabilities) give you access to support and treatment. It also comes with a community that wants to welcome you in.\n\nFinally, this letter is a call to action \u2014 a call to our researchers, policy makers, educators, and parents and caregivers to better understand, address, and find solutions for the mental health needs of individuals with learning disabilities.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP!\n\nFor researchers:\n\nInclude mental health as measures in your data collection, and mental health disabilities as covariates.\n\nResearch educational trauma, including its prevalence and impact on students with learning disabilities.\n\nConduct holistic research on the experiences of LD students beyond our academic success, and understand the impact on our non-academic lives.\n\nResearch the intersection of mental health and learning disabilities, and specifically the experiences of BIPOC, LGBTQ+, and historically marginalized groups.\n\nInclude LD people in your research process beyond them being research subjects. Ensure that learning disabled people are a part of the research design process. Get feedback from the LD community and ensure that the research questions you ask are aligned with the values of the community you\u2019re studying. Hire LD people in your labs and centers so a good percentage of the next generation of people studying LD are LD themselves.\n\nFor policy makers:\n\nIncrease funding for early identification, treatment, and psychological support within schools. We need well-funded school-based mental health programs, school psychologists, counselors, and social workers.\n\nKeep your promise and fully fund IDEA, after over 40 years of never doing so.\n\nBan the practices of seclusion and restraint that have harmed and oppressed disabled students for decades.\n\nFor educators:\n\nMany of your students are walking into your classroom with years of educational trauma. You can end it. Focus on students\u2019 strengths while also acknowledging and building solutions to address our weaknesses, and listen to students when they are brave in sharing their experiences.\n\nBe aware of the interconnectedness of mental health and learning disabilities, and work with us to create strategies that address what we need and prevent negative outcomes.\n\nAvoid terms such as \u201clazy\u201d when you talk about your disabled students. We aren\u2019t lazy. We\u2019re trying our best.\n\nFor parents and caregivers:\n\nTalk about mental health with us, and help us own our identities as members of the disability community.\n\nLook for early warning signs of mental health issues and teach us to be self-advocates, so that when we\u2019re on our own, we\u2019ve got the skills to stand up for ourselves and the things we need to be successful learners.\n\nFor the learning disabled community:\n\nEmbrace your learning disability identity. Don\u2019t be afraid to use the language of disability. Taboo and stigma lead people to use euphemisms. But ultimately, our legal rights and our connection to community depend on identifying as disabled. We can end the stigma and taboo of being disabled by embracing this community.\n\nBe willing to talk about how mental health impacts you in school. We are functioning in school systems that are not designed for us and that \u201cothers\u201d us constantly. Allowing yourself to get support is the greatest gift you can give to yourself. We know it\u2019s hard to stick out as the one using accommodations, but you\u2019ll be glad you did.\n\nUnderstand that you\u2019ll need to self-advocate for both your LD and your mental health. This may look like telling your parents and educators what you need in a classroom setting to succeed. This means attending your IEP meeting and making sure your accommodations reflect your needs.\n\nThis call to action only scratches the surface of a larger conversation. Our voice matters. Join us in amplifying this initiative by signing below.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Young Adult Leadership Council"}, {"url": "https://www.guidestar.org/profile/13-2899381", "page_content": "We employ various strategies to achieve our goals and they are customized to best meet the needs of our audiences:\n\n\n\nOur parent empowerment work is based on 1) building and engaging a large national network of parents, 2) conducting campaigns to support and motivate parents to take action for their own and other children, 3) and working with parents at grassroots level in selected states to become effective agents for change.\n\n\n\nOur school transformation strategies focus on state, district and school-level education leaders.

In simple terms, a learning disability results from a difference in the way a person's brain is \"wired.\" While children with learning disabilities are as smart or smarter than their peers, they may have difficulty with reading, writing, spelling, reasoning, or recalling and/or organizing information if they are left to figure things out by themselves or if they are taught in conventional ways.\n\nJack Horner (b. 1946) is an American paleontologist who discovered the Maiasaura, providing evidence that dinosaurs cared for their young. His dyslexia interfered with his ability to do well in school, yet he received an honorary doctorate and is a faculty member at Montana State University.\n\nA learning disability may not be curable, but with the right support and intervention, children with learning disabilities can succeed in school and go on to successful, often distinguished careers later in life. Parents can help children with learning disabilities achieve such success by encouraging their strengths, knowing their weaknesses, understanding the educational system, working with professionals and learning about strategies for dealing with specific difficulties.\n\nIt is important to understand that learning disabilities are defined differently by different groups. The concept of \u201clearning disability\u201d has one meaning for the general public, but a different meaning for professionals. Furthermore, different professional groups use different definitions of learning disability.\n\nCommon Learning Disabilities\n\nDyslexia \u2013 a language-based disability in which a person has trouble understanding written words. It may also be referred to as reading disability or reading disorder. Dyscalculia \u2013 a mathematical disability in which a person has a difficult time solving arithmetic problems and grasping math concepts. Dysgraphia \u2013 a writing disability in which a person finds it hard to form letters or write within a defined space. Auditory and Visual Processing Disorders \u2013 sensory disabilities in which a person has difficulty processing auditory or visual information despite normal hearing and vision. Nonverbal Learning Disabilities \u2013 a neurological disorder which originates in the right hemisphere of the brain, causing problems with visual-spatial, intuitive, organizational, evaluative and holistic processing functions.\n\n(From: Learning Strategies for Problem Learners, by Thomas Lombardi, ldonline.org, and teachingld.org)\n\nPossible Indicators\n\nBecoming aware of the warning signs of learning disabilities and getting children the necessary help early on can be key to a child's future. The earlier a learning disability is detected, the better chance a child will have of succeeding in school and in life. All children learn in highly individual ways. To increase the likelihood of student success, detection is key.\n\nPreschool\n\nSpeaks later than most children Pronunciation problems Slow vocabulary growth, often unable to find the right word Difficulty rhyming words Trouble learning numbers, alphabet, days of the week, colors, shapes Extremely restless and easily distracted Trouble interacting with peers Difficulty following directions or routines Fine motor skills slow to develop\n\nGrades K\u20134\n\nSlow to learn the connection between letters and sounds Confuses basic words (run, eat, want) Makes consistent reading and spelling errors including letter reversals (b/d), inversions (m/w), transpositions (felt/left), and substitutions (house/home) Transposes number sequences and confuses arithmetic signs (+, -, x, /, =) Slow to remember facts Slow to learn new skills, relies heavily on memorization Impulsive, difficulty planning Unstable pencil grip Trouble learning about time Poor coordination, unaware of physical surroundings, prone to accidents\n\nGrades 5\u20138\n\nReverses letter sequences (soiled/solid, left/felt) Slow to learn prefixes, suffixes, root words, and other spelling strategies Avoids reading aloud Trouble with word problems Difficulty with handwriting Awkward, fist-like, or tight pencil grip Avoids writing assignments Slow or poor recall of facts Difficulty making friends Trouble understanding body language and facial expressions\n\nHigh School Students and Adults\n\nContinues to spell incorrectly, frequently spells the same word differently in a single piece of writing Avoids reading and writing tasks Trouble summarizing Trouble with open-ended questions on tests Weak memory skills Difficulty adjusting to new settings Works slowly Poor grasp of abstract concepts Either pays too little attention to details or focuses on them too much Misreads information\n\nSample Strategies\n\nBring to the student's attention science role models with disabilities with a similar disability to that of the student. Point out that this individual got ahead by a combination of effort and by asking for help when needed. Generally, a person with learning disabilities may experience difficulties in study skills, writing skills, oral skills, reading skills, math skills, and social skills.\n\nIn studying, students may experience inability to organize time and may be unable to finish assignments on time. They also may have trouble taking notes and following instructions. They often have difficulty spelling correctly and may make frequent grammatical errors which results in poor sentence structure and poor penmanship. If the lecturer speaks too fast, they may have difficulty understanding the lecture and recalling the words. They are often slow readers and sometimes have incorrect comprehension and poor retention. They may be confused with math symbols and may have difficulty with concepts of time and money. Realizing their inabilities result in low self-esteem which can greatly affects their social skills. They might have impulsive behavior and be disorientated in time.\n\nDealing with students with learning disabilities, as with other students, requires that teachers have a good understanding of individual students\u2019 strengths and needs, and plan instruction to build on their strengths and address their needs. The following are some suggestions and guidelines for a teacher with students with learning disabilities.\n\nGeneral Courtesy\n\nDon't assume that the person is not listening just because you are getting no verbal or visual feedback. Don't assume that you have to explain everything to students with learning disabilities. They do not necessarily have a problem with general comprehension. Consult with the special education specialist to obtain help in understanding the specific nature of the learning disability for each student. Never assess a student's capabilities based solely on their IQ or other standardized test scores. Give student with learning disabilities priority in registration for classes. Allow course substitution for nonessential course requirements in their major studies. A student may have documented intelligence with test scores in the average to superior range with adequate sensory and motor systems and still have a learning disability. Learning disabilities often go undiagnosed, hence teacher observation can be a major source of identification. Bring to the student's attention science role models with disabilities with a similar disability to that of the student. Point out that this individual got ahead by a combination of effort and by asking for help when needed.\n\nTeacher Presentation\n\nAlways ask questions in a clarifying manner, then have the students with learning disabilities describe his or her understanding of the questions. Use an overhead projector with an outline of the lesson or unit of the day. Ensure that students have a managable course load. Provide clear photocopies of your notes and overhead transparencies, if the student benefits from such strategies. Provide students with chapter outlines or study guides that cue them to key points in their readings. Provide a detailed course syllabus before class begins. Ask questions in a way that helps the student gain confidence. Keep oral instructions logical and concise. Reinforce them with a brief cue words. Repeat or re-word complicated directions. Frequently verbalize what is being written on the chalkboard. Eliminate classroom distractions such as, excessive noise, flickering lights, etc. Outline class presentations on the chalkboard or on an overhead transparency. Outline material to be covered during each class period unit. (At the end of class, summarize the important segments of each presentation.)Establish the clarity of understanding that the student has about class assignments. Give assignments both in written and oral form. Have more complex lessons recorded and available to the students with learning disabilities. Have practice exercises available for lessons, in case the student has problems. Have students with learning disabilities underline key words or directions on activity sheets (then review the sheets with them). Have complex homework assignments due in two or three days rather than on the next day. Pace instruction carefully to ensure clarity. Present new and or technical vocabulary on the chalkboard or overhead. Provide and teach memory associations (mnemonic strategies). Support one modality of presentation by following it with instruction and then use another modality. Talk distinctly and at a rate that the student with a learning disability can be follow. Technical content should be presented in small incremental steps. Use plenty of examples, oral or otherwise, in order to make topics more applied. Use straight forward instructions with step-by-step unambiguous terms. (Preferably, presented one at a time). Write legibly, use large type; do not clutter the blackboard with non-current / non-relevant information. Use props to make narrative situations more vivid and clear. Assist the student, if necessary, in borrowing classmates' notes. Consider cross-age or peer tutoring if the student appears unable to keep up with the class pace or with complex subject matter. The more capable reader can help in summarizing the essential points of the reading or in establishing the main idea of the reading.\n\nLaboratory\n\nClearly label equipment, tools, and materials. Color code them for enhanced visual recognition. Consider alternate activities/exercises that can be utilized with less difficulty for the student, but has the same or similar learning objectives. Provide clear photocopies of your notes and overhead transparencies. For students with learning disabilities, make available cue cards or labels designating the steps of a procedure to expedite the mastering. Use an overhead projector with an outline of the lesson or unit of the day. Allow extended time for responses and the preparation and delivery of reports. In dealing with abstract concepts, use visual tools such as charts and graphs. Also, paraphrase and present them in specific terms, and sequence and illustrate them with concrete examples, personal experiences, or hands-on exercises. To minimize student anxiety, provide an individual orientation to the laboratory and equipment and give extra practice with tasks and equipment. Find areas of strength in the student's lab experiences and emphasize those as much as possible. Allow the students with learning disabilities the use of computers and spell checking programs on assignments.\n\nReading\n\nAnnounce readings as well as assignments well in advance. Find materials paralleling the textbook, but written at a lower reading level. (Also, include activities that make the reading assignment more relevant.) Introduce simulations to make abstract content more concrete. Make lists of required readings available early and arrange to obtain texts on tape from Recording for the Blind or a Reading/Typing Service. Offer to read written material aloud, when necessary. Read aloud material that is written on the chalkboard and on the overhead transparencies. Review relevant material, preview the material to be presented, present the new material then summarize the material just presented. Suggest that the students use both visual and auditory senses when reading the text. Rely less on textbooks. Reading for students with learning disabilities may be slow and deliberate, and comprehension may be impaired for the student , particularly when dealing with large quantities of material. Comprehension and speed usually dramatically increase with the addition of auditory input. Spend more time on building background for the reading selections and creating a mental scheme for the organization of the text. Encourage students to practice using technical words in exchanges among peers. Choose books with a reduced number of difficult words, direct non convoluted syntax, and passages that deliver clear meaning. Also, select readings that are organized by subheads because this aids in the flow of ideas. When writing materials for reading by students with learning disabilities, some of the strategies referred to in the reading section of the hearing impaired presentation will be appropriate. Allow the student to use a playback device, such as tape player, computer, mp3 player, etc...\n\nGroup Interaction and Discussion\n\nAlways ask questions in a clarifying manner, then have the students with learning disabilities describe his or her understanding of the questions. Assist the student, if necessary, in borrowing classmates discussion notes. Encourage questions during or after class to ensure that materials are understood by students with learning disabilities. Give individual conferences to guide students with learning disabilities to monitor progress and understanding of the assignment and of the course content. Give plenty of reinforcement when it is evident that the student with a learning disability is trying things that are made difficult by the disability. Have frequent question-and-answer sessions for students with learning disabilities.\n\nField Experiences\n\nAllow the students with learning disabilities the use of computers and spell checking programs on field notes and reports. Consider alternate activities/exercises that can be utilized with less difficulty for the student, but has the same or similar learning objectives.\n\nResearch\n\nReview and discuss with the student the steps involved in a research activity. Think about which step(s) may be difficult for the student's specific functional limitations and jointly devise accommodations for that student. Use appropriate laboratory and field strategies.\n\nTesting\n\nAvoid overly complicated language in exam questions and clearly separate items when spacing them on the exam sheet. (Refer to writing for students with hearing impairments in thereading section.) Consider other forms of testing (oral, hands-on demonstration, open-book etc.). Some students with learning disabilities find that large print helps their processing ability. Consider the use of illustrations by the students with learning disabilities as an acceptable form of response to questions in lieu of written responses. Eliminate distractions while students are taking exams. For students with perceptual problems, for whom transferring answers is especially difficult, avoid answer sheets, especially computer forms. Allow them to write answers (check or circle) on the test (or try to have them dictate their responses on a tape recorder.) For students who have reading difficulties, have a proctor read the test to the student. For students with writing difficulties, have someone scibe the answers for them or use a tape recorder to take down the answers. Gradually increase expectations as the students with learning disabilities gains confidence. Grant time extensions on exams and written assignments when there are significant demands on reading and writing skills. If distractions are excessive, permit the students with learning disabilities to take examinations in a separate quiet room with a proctor. Provide study questions for exams that demonstrate the format along with the content of the exam. Review with the student how to proofread assignments and tests. Do not test material just presented or outcomes just produced, since for the students with learning disabilities, additional time is generally required to assimilate new knowledge and concepts. Permit the students with learning disabilities the use of a dictionary, thesaurus, or a calculator during tests. Provide computer with spell check/grammar/ cut & paste features\n\nOrganizations\n\nCouncil for Exceptional Children - Division for Learning Disabilities (DLD)\n\nThe Division for Learning Disabilities (DLD) is one of 17 special interest groups of the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC).

Here are a number of suggestions and considerations for parents.\n\nLearn about LD. The more you know, the more you can help yourself and your child. Take advantage of the excellent resources out there for parents .\n\nPraise your child when he or she does well. Children with LD are often very good at a variety of things. Find out what your child really enjoys doing, such as dancing, playing soccer, or working with computers. Give your child plenty of opportunities to pursue his or her strengths and talents.\n\nFind out the ways your child learns best. Does he or she learn by hands-on practice, looking, or listening? Help your child learn through his or her areas of strength.\n\nLet your son or daughter help with household chores. These can build self-confidence and concrete skills. Keep instructions simple, break down tasks into smaller steps, and reward your childs efforts with praise.\n\nMake homework a priority.

Specific learning disability means a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or in using language, spoken or written, that may manifest itself in the imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell, or to do mathematical calculations, including conditions such as perceptual disabilities, brain injury, minimal brain dysfunction, dyslexia, and developmental aphasia.\n\nDisorders not included. Specific learning disability does not include learning problems that are primarily the result of visual, hearing, or motor disabilities, of intellectual disability, of emotional disturbance, or of environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage.\n\nIDEA also lists evaluation procedures that must be used at a minimum to identify and document that a child has a specific learning disability. These will now be discussed in brief.\n\nSocial Skills Winter 2023\n\nRegistration Now Open! Our Social Skills Program is designed for children ages 6 to 16 diagnosed with LD and/or ADHD.

If this happens, there are specific actions you can take. These include:\n\nContact your states Parent Training and Information Center for assistance.The PTI can offer you guidance and support in what to do next. Find your PTI by visiting our Find Your Parent Center page.\n\nConsider having your child evaluated by an independent evaluator.You may have to pay for this evaluation, or you can ask that the school pay for it. To learn more about independent evaluations, have a look at Right to Request an Independent Evaluation.\n\nAsk for mediation, or use one of IDEAs other dispute resolution options. Parents have the right to disagree with the schools decision not to evaluate their child and be heard.

The ways in which children are identified as having a learning disability have changed over the years. Until recently, the most common approach was to use a severe discrepancy formula. This referred to the gap, or discrepancy, between the childs intelligence or aptitude and his or her actual performance. However, in the 2004 reauthorization of IDEA, how LD is determined has been expanded. IDEA now requires that states adopt criteria that:\n\nmust not require the use of a severe discrepancy between intellectual ability and achievement in determining whether a child has a specific learning disability\n\nmust permit local educational agencies to use a process based on the childs response to scientific, research-based intervention and\n\nmay permit the use of other alternative research-based procedures for determining whether a child has a specific learning disability.\n\nBasically, what this means is that, instead of using a severe discrepancy approach to determining LD, school systems may provide the student with a research-based intervention and keep close track of the students performance. Analyzing the students response to that intervention may then be considered by school districts in the process of identifying that a child has a learning disability.\n\nMoving on, let us suppose that the student has been diagnosed with a specific learning disability.

A learning disability can cause a person to have trouble learning and using certain skills. The skills most often affected are: reading, writing, listening, speaking, reasoning, and doing math.\n\nLearning disabilities is not the only term used to describe these difficulties. Others include:\n\ndyslexia which refers to difficulties in reading\n\nwhich refers to difficulties in reading dysgraphia which refers to difficulties in writing and\n\nwhich refers to difficulties in writing and dyscalculawhich refers to difficulties in math.\n\nAll of these are considered learning disabilities.\n\nLearning disabilities vary from person to person. One person with LD may not have the same kind of learning problems as another person with LD. Sara, in our example above, has trouble with reading and writing. Another person with LD may have problems with understanding math. Still another person may have trouble in both of these areas, as well as with understanding what people are saying.\n\nResearchers think that learning disabilities are caused by differences in how a persons brain works and how it processes information. Children with learning disabilities are not dumb or lazy. In fact, they usually have average or above average intelligence. Their brains just process information differently.\n\nRead Also: Tricare For 100 Disabled Veterans\n\nTips And Resources For Teachers\n\nLearn as much as you can about the different types of LD.

Examples:\n\nbreaking tasks into smaller steps, and giving directions verbally and in writing\n\ngiving the student more time to finish schoolwork or take tests\n\nletting the student with reading problems use instructional materials that are accessible to those with print disabilities\n\nletting the student with listening difficulties borrow notes from a classmate or use a tape recorder and\n\nletting the student with writing difficulties use a computer with specialized software that spell checks, grammar checks, or recognizes speech.\n\nLearn about the different testing modifications that can really help a student with LD show what he or she has learned.\n\nTeach organizational skills, study skills, and learning strategies. These help all students but are particularly helpful to those with LD.\n\nWork with the students parents to create an IEP tailored to meet the students needs.\n\nIs Ncld Now Understood\n\nNo. NCLD and 14 other nonprofits collaborated to create Understood.org, a digital destination for parents of children with learning and attention issues.

We started by searching the National Center for Education Statistics IPED database for the colleges that attract an unusually large number of students with disabilities. More specifically, we only considered schools at which more than 5% of undergraduates are formally registered with the office of disability services. From that point, one of the main factors we considered in our ranking was the actual percentage of undergraduate students at the college who have learning disabilities. In the list below, the values range from 7-100%!\n\nHowever, just because a program is popular with LD individuals doesn\u2019t mean its services are necessarily successful. Therefore, we also considered each school\u2019s overall undergraduate graduation rate . And to pinpoint the programs that offer the most individual attention and a supportive academic environment at every stage of learning, we looked at each college\u2019s student-to-faculty ratio. We acquired both of these statistics from the NCES\u2019 College Navigator database.\n\nOnce we had obtained a short-list of potential top programs, we researched each college individually to assess the types of services they provide for students with learning disabilities. We considered both the range of available services as well as any particularly unique resources and opportunities that benefit LD undergrads.\n\nNyc Adult Literacy Program\n\nThe Adult Literacy Program is a partnership with the New York City Adult Literacy Initiative , the City\u2019s system for providing literacy and English language services for adults and out-of-school youth over the age of 16.\n\nPhone if calling within NYC: 800-246-4646\n\nPhone if calling outside of NYC: 646-343-6800\n\nRead Also: Home Loans For Disabled Persons With Bad Credit\n\nWhat Are The Signs Of A Learning Disability\n\nWhile there is no one sign that a person has a learning disability, there are certain clues. Weve listed a few below. Most relate to elementary school tasks, because learning disabilities tend to be identified in elementary school. This is because school focuses on the very things that may be difficult for the childreading, writing, math, listening, speaking, reasoning. A child probably wont show all of these signs, or even most of them. However, if a child shows a number of these problems, then parents and the teacher should consider the possibility that the child has a learning disability.\n\nWhen a child has a learning disability, he or she:\n\nIf a child has unexpected problems learning to read, write, listen, speak, or do math, then teachers and parents may want to investigate more. The same is true if the child is struggling to do any one of these skills. The child may need to be evaluated to see if he or she has a learning disability.\n\nWhat About School\n\nThe LD Checklist: Recognize and Respond\n\nOnce a child is evaluated and found eligible for special education and related services, school staff and parents meet and develop what is known as an Individualized Education Program, or IEP. This document is very important in the educational life of a child with learning disabilities. It describes the childs needs and the services that the public school system will provide free of charge to address those needs.\n\nSupports or changes in the classroom help most students with LD. Common accommodations are listed in the Tips for Teachers section below. Accessible instructional materials are among the most helpful to students whose LD affects their ability to read and process printed language. Thanks to IDEA 2004, there are numerous places to turn now for AIMs. Weve listed one central source in the Resources Especially for Teachers section.\n\nAssistive technology can also help many students work around their learning disabilities. Assistive technology can range from low-tech equipment such as tape recorders to high-tech tools such as reading machines and voice recognition systems .

A 2019 CDC report indicated 33% of high school students experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness. This number jumped to 44% during the pandemic. For those of us in the learning disability community, mental health issues permeate our everyday lives. The limited research we have supports a strong correlation between learning disabilities and mental health disorders. For example, one study found that individuals with learning disabilities report mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation at twice the rate of their non-disabled peers, even controlling for possible confounding factors. Another meta-analytic study shows varying rates of comorbidity, from 8% to 46.3%, for ADHD and anxiety among students with LD.\n\nYet, the causal relationship between mental health and learning disabilities is still poorly understood. The topic of mental health rates in the LD community came up time and time again in conversations among our Young Adult Leadership Council members, where for many of us mental health struggles are woven throughout our LD stories. We write this letter first as a note of acknowledgement to the LD community, second to bring awareness of this issue to a broader global community, and third to call in parents, teachers, policy makers, and researchers to help us address this issue.\n\nGenerally, poor mental health is associated with challenges with decision making, difficulty in school, difficulty forming positive relationships, and other risky or potentially harmful behaviors. Dual-disability diagnoses present even greater challenges, as many experience persistent stress, anxiety,, trauma, bullying, internalizing problems, and feelings of social isolation as they navigate a world with learning disabilities and mental health disorders. These negative experiences are especially concerning when you consider that almost one-third of incarcerated individuals report having a learning disability, and mental health issues affect approximately half of the incarcerated populations.\n\n\u201cNot being diagnosed until recently as an adult, I never understood why I struggled like I did. However, after my diagnosis, I realized that my anxiety and depressive episodes contributed to my perfectionism and impulsive choices. Undiagnosed individuals with ADHD face the harsh reality of being prone to depression and anxiety. It could lead someone to a pathway of substance abuse and impulsive decision making that can have serious consequences. When you live in a world where people don\u2019t understand individuals with attention issues, it can make you feel like something is inherently wrong with you, which can also contribute to depression.\u201d\n\n\u2014Misha Nicholas\n\nWe know that students with LD report more issues with mental health. However, that is the extent of the research. We do not know the cause of these lower mental health rates in students with learning disabilities. Anecdotal reports by students with LD suggest that many experience educational trauma. We need research in order to know the extent and impact of this educational trauma. Is educational trauma a risk factor for poor mental health?\n\nAs members and activists on the National Center for Learning Disabilities\u2019 Young Adult Leadership Council (YALC), we feel it is imperative to kick-start a solution-driven mental health initiative focused on the intersectionality of learning disabilities and mental health disorders. Many of us navigate life as learning disabled people struggling with mental health. Research suggests that promoting a sense of belonging and peer social support within schools can protect learning disabled individuals from many documented negative outcomes. Yet, many of us experienced various forms of educational trauma throughout education in the form of persistent academic failure, feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, bullying, social isolation, and ridicule. Educational trauma refers to the perpetual pattern of harmful cycles within educational systems that detrimentally affect academic and emotional outcomes.\n\n\u201cThe humiliation, bullying, and systematic exclusion was shattering beyond words. Eventually the educational trauma I experienced became a bigger barrier to learning than my actual learning disability.\u201d\n\n\u2014Erin\n\nMany young adults with learning disabilities describe their K\u201312 educational experiences as traumatic. They describe feelings of being misunderstood. Often, they report that those around them failed to understand their learning and mental health struggles, as they lacked the words to describe the shame they felt to the adults and peers in their lives. These struggles span well beyond weaknesses in reading, writing, and math. Mental health and learning disabilities are interwoven, and these challenges follow learning disabled individuals as they transition out of high school and into postsecondary education and the workplace.\n\n\u201cIt was not until undergrad that I learned that it isn\u2019t normal to feel like you can\u2019t breathe every time before attempting homework.\u201d\n\n\u2014Stevie Mays\n\nMany learning disabled people report feeling unsafe and like they do not belong in the classroom. In talking with almost any learning disabled person, they will tell you that their learning disability has impacted them far beyond just their struggle with learning skills like math and reading. They will tell you that existing as a learning disabled person impacts one\u2019s whole experience with the world, how the world interacts with them, and how they interact with the world. Yes, it\u2019s important for us to help LD students in academic areas like reading and writing. But if we fail to look beyond academics, at the whole person, we miss an entire aspect of the learning disabled experience. We miss what it actually means to exist as a learning disabled person.\n\n\u201cAt age 16, as everyone around me wrote in fine penmanship, I felt like a child still writing with red crayon.

A disability that deserves the same support and focus as dyslexia, ADHD, and other learning disabilities.\n\nOur dyslexia, anxiety, ADHD, depression, dysgraphia, PTSD, and more are disabilities that need support, understanding, and recognition. Many of us on the YALC say that finding the LD community was the key to us feeling like we finally understood ourselves and were able to come out of our shame. We found strength in our shared experiences and were able to name many of our experiences for what they were: educational trauma. In doing so we found our voice, not only to share our stories but to advocate for our community as a whole.\n\nTo the LD person reading this, we see and empathize with your struggles. We encourage you to seek out your LD community and embrace your disability identity. The disability label (including mental health and learning disabilities) give you access to support and treatment. It also comes with a community that wants to welcome you in.\n\nFinally, this letter is a call to action \u2014 a call to our researchers, policy makers, educators, and parents and caregivers to better understand, address, and find solutions for the mental health needs of individuals with learning disabilities.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP!\n\nFor researchers:\n\nInclude mental health as measures in your data collection, and mental health disabilities as covariates.\n\nResearch educational trauma, including its prevalence and impact on students with learning disabilities.\n\nConduct holistic research on the experiences of LD students beyond our academic success, and understand the impact on our non-academic lives.\n\nResearch the intersection of mental health and learning disabilities, and specifically the experiences of BIPOC, LGBTQ+, and historically marginalized groups.\n\nInclude LD people in your research process beyond them being research subjects. Ensure that learning disabled people are a part of the research design process. Get feedback from the LD community and ensure that the research questions you ask are aligned with the values of the community you\u2019re studying. Hire LD people in your labs and centers so a good percentage of the next generation of people studying LD are LD themselves.\n\nFor policy makers:\n\nIncrease funding for early identification, treatment, and psychological support within schools. We need well-funded school-based mental health programs, school psychologists, counselors, and social workers.\n\nKeep your promise and fully fund IDEA, after over 40 years of never doing so.\n\nBan the practices of seclusion and restraint that have harmed and oppressed disabled students for decades.\n\nFor educators:\n\nMany of your students are walking into your classroom with years of educational trauma. You can end it. Focus on students\u2019 strengths while also acknowledging and building solutions to address our weaknesses, and listen to students when they are brave in sharing their experiences.\n\nBe aware of the interconnectedness of mental health and learning disabilities, and work with us to create strategies that address what we need and prevent negative outcomes.\n\nAvoid terms such as \u201clazy\u201d when you talk about your disabled students. We aren\u2019t lazy. We\u2019re trying our best.\n\nFor parents and caregivers:\n\nTalk about mental health with us, and help us own our identities as members of the disability community.\n\nLook for early warning signs of mental health issues and teach us to be self-advocates, so that when we\u2019re on our own, we\u2019ve got the skills to stand up for ourselves and the things we need to be successful learners.\n\nFor the learning disabled community:\n\nEmbrace your learning disability identity. Don\u2019t be afraid to use the language of disability. Taboo and stigma lead people to use euphemisms. But ultimately, our legal rights and our connection to community depend on identifying as disabled. We can end the stigma and taboo of being disabled by embracing this community.\n\nBe willing to talk about how mental health impacts you in school. We are functioning in school systems that are not designed for us and that \u201cothers\u201d us constantly. Allowing yourself to get support is the greatest gift you can give to yourself. We know it\u2019s hard to stick out as the one using accommodations, but you\u2019ll be glad you did.\n\nUnderstand that you\u2019ll need to self-advocate for both your LD and your mental health. This may look like telling your parents and educators what you need in a classroom setting to succeed. This means attending your IEP meeting and making sure your accommodations reflect your needs.\n\nThis call to action only scratches the surface of a larger conversation. Our voice matters.

A 2019 CDC report indicated 33% of high school students experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness. This number jumped to 44% during the pandemic. For those of us in the learning disability community, mental health issues permeate our everyday lives. The limited research we have supports a strong correlation between learning disabilities and mental health disorders. For example, one study found that individuals with learning disabilities report mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation at twice the rate of their non-disabled peers, even controlling for possible confounding factors.

Dual-disability diagnoses present even greater challenges, as many experience persistent stress, anxiety,, trauma, bullying, internalizing problems, and feelings of social isolation as they navigate a world with learning disabilities and mental health disorders.

However, after my diagnosis, I realized that my anxiety and depressive episodes contributed to my perfectionism and impulsive choices. Undiagnosed individuals with ADHD face the harsh reality of being prone to depression and anxiety. It could lead someone to a pathway of substance abuse and impulsive decision making that can have serious consequences.

However, that is the extent of the research. We do not know the cause of these lower mental health rates in students with learning disabilities.

Is educational trauma a risk factor for poor mental health?\n\nAs members and activists on the National Center for Learning Disabilities\u2019 Young Adult Leadership Council (YALC), we feel it is imperative to kick-start a solution-driven mental health initiative focused on the intersectionality of learning disabilities and mental health disorders. Many of us navigate life as learning disabled people struggling with mental health. Research suggests that promoting a sense of belonging and peer social support within schools can protect learning disabled individuals from many documented negative outcomes. Yet, many of us experienced various forms of educational trauma throughout education in the form of persistent academic failure, feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, bullying, social isolation, and ridicule. Educational trauma refers to the perpetual pattern of harmful cycles within educational systems that detrimentally affect academic and emotional outcomes.\n\n\u201cThe humiliation, bullying, and systematic exclusion was shattering beyond words. Eventually the educational trauma I experienced became a bigger barrier to learning than my actual learning disability.\u201d\n\n\u2014Erin\n\nMany young adults with learning disabilities describe their K\u201312 educational experiences as traumatic. They describe feelings of being misunderstood. Often, they report that those around them failed to understand their learning and mental health struggles, as they lacked the words to describe the shame they felt to the adults and peers in their lives. These struggles span well beyond weaknesses in reading, writing, and math. Mental health and learning disabilities are interwoven, and these challenges follow learning disabled individuals as they transition out of high school and into postsecondary education and the workplace.\n\n\u201cIt was not until undergrad that I learned that it isn\u2019t normal to feel like you can\u2019t breathe every time before attempting homework.\u201d\n\n\u2014Stevie Mays\n\nMany learning disabled people report feeling unsafe and like they do not belong in the classroom. In talking with almost any learning disabled person, they will tell you that their learning disability has impacted them far beyond just their struggle with learning skills like math and reading. They will tell you that existing as a learning disabled person impacts one\u2019s whole experience with the world, how the world interacts with them, and how they interact with the world. Yes, it\u2019s important for us to help LD students in academic areas like reading and writing. But if we fail to look beyond academics, at the whole person, we miss an entire aspect of the learning disabled experience.

A disability that deserves the same support and focus as dyslexia, ADHD, and other learning disabilities.\n\nOur dyslexia, anxiety, ADHD, depression, dysgraphia, PTSD, and more are disabilities that need support, understanding, and recognition. Many of us on the YALC say that finding the LD community was the key to us feeling like we finally understood ourselves and were able to come out of our shame. We found strength in our shared experiences and were able to name many of our experiences for what they were: educational trauma. In doing so we found our voice, not only to share our stories but to advocate for our community as a whole.\n\nTo the LD person reading this, we see and empathize with your struggles.

Ensure that learning disabled people are a part of the research design process. Get feedback from the LD community and ensure that the research questions you ask are aligned with the values of the community you\u2019re studying. Hire LD people in your labs and centers so a good percentage of the next generation of people studying LD are LD themselves.\n\nFor policy makers:\n\nIncrease funding for early identification, treatment, and psychological support within schools. We need well-funded school-based mental health programs, school psychologists, counselors, and social workers.\n\nKeep your promise and fully fund IDEA, after over 40 years of never doing so.\n\nBan the practices of seclusion and restraint that have harmed and oppressed disabled students for decades.\n\nFor educators:\n\nMany of your students are walking into your classroom with years of educational trauma. You can end it. Focus on students\u2019 strengths while also acknowledging and building solutions to address our weaknesses, and listen to students when they are brave in sharing their experiences.\n\nBe aware of the interconnectedness of mental health and learning disabilities, and work with us to create strategies that address what we need and prevent negative outcomes.\n\nAvoid terms such as \u201clazy\u201d when you talk about your disabled students. We aren\u2019t lazy. We\u2019re trying our best.\n\nFor parents and caregivers:\n\nTalk about mental health with us, and help us own our identities as members of the disability community.\n\nLook for early warning signs of mental health issues and teach us to be self-advocates, so that when we\u2019re on our own, we\u2019ve got the skills to stand up for ourselves and the things we need to be successful learners.\n\nFor the learning disabled community:\n\nEmbrace your learning disability identity.

In simple terms, a learning disability results from a difference in the way a person's brain is \"wired.\" While children with learning disabilities are as smart or smarter than their peers, they may have difficulty with reading, writing, spelling, reasoning, or recalling and/or organizing information if they are left to figure things out by themselves or if they are taught in conventional ways.\n\nJack Horner (b. 1946) is an American paleontologist who discovered the Maiasaura, providing evidence that dinosaurs cared for their young. His dyslexia interfered with his ability to do well in school, yet he received an honorary doctorate and is a faculty member at Montana State University.\n\nA learning disability may not be curable, but with the right support and intervention, children with learning disabilities can succeed in school and go on to successful, often distinguished careers later in life. Parents can help children with learning disabilities achieve such success by encouraging their strengths, knowing their weaknesses, understanding the educational system, working with professionals and learning about strategies for dealing with specific difficulties.\n\nIt is important to understand that learning disabilities are defined differently by different groups. The concept of \u201clearning disability\u201d has one meaning for the general public, but a different meaning for professionals. Furthermore, different professional groups use different definitions of learning disability.\n\nCommon Learning Disabilities\n\nDyslexia \u2013 a language-based disability in which a person has trouble understanding written words. It may also be referred to as reading disability or reading disorder. Dyscalculia \u2013 a mathematical disability in which a person has a difficult time solving arithmetic problems and grasping math concepts. Dysgraphia \u2013 a writing disability in which a person finds it hard to form letters or write within a defined space. Auditory and Visual Processing Disorders \u2013 sensory disabilities in which a person has difficulty processing auditory or visual information despite normal hearing and vision. Nonverbal Learning Disabilities \u2013 a neurological disorder which originates in the right hemisphere of the brain, causing problems with visual-spatial, intuitive, organizational, evaluative and holistic processing functions.\n\n(From: Learning Strategies for Problem Learners, by Thomas Lombardi, ldonline.org, and teachingld.org)\n\nPossible Indicators\n\nBecoming aware of the warning signs of learning disabilities and getting children the necessary help early on can be key to a child's future. The earlier a learning disability is detected, the better chance a child will have of succeeding in school and in life. All children learn in highly individual ways. To increase the likelihood of student success, detection is key.\n\nPreschool\n\nSpeaks later than most children Pronunciation problems Slow vocabulary growth, often unable to find the right word Difficulty rhyming words Trouble learning numbers, alphabet, days of the week, colors, shapes Extremely restless and easily distracted Trouble interacting with peers Difficulty following directions or routines Fine motor skills slow to develop\n\nGrades K\u20134\n\nSlow to learn the connection between letters and sounds Confuses basic words (run, eat, want) Makes consistent reading and spelling errors including letter reversals (b/d), inversions (m/w), transpositions (felt/left), and substitutions (house/home) Transposes number sequences and confuses arithmetic signs (+, -, x, /, =) Slow to remember facts Slow to learn new skills, relies heavily on memorization Impulsive, difficulty planning Unstable pencil grip Trouble learning about time Poor coordination, unaware of physical surroundings, prone to accidents\n\nGrades 5\u20138\n\nReverses letter sequences (soiled/solid, left/felt) Slow to learn prefixes, suffixes, root words, and other spelling strategies Avoids reading aloud Trouble with word problems Difficulty with handwriting Awkward, fist-like, or tight pencil grip Avoids writing assignments Slow or poor recall of facts Difficulty making friends Trouble understanding body language and facial expressions\n\nHigh School Students and Adults\n\nContinues to spell incorrectly, frequently spells the same word differently in a single piece of writing Avoids reading and writing tasks Trouble summarizing Trouble with open-ended questions on tests Weak memory skills Difficulty adjusting to new settings Works slowly Poor grasp of abstract concepts Either pays too little attention to details or focuses on them too much Misreads information\n\nSample Strategies\n\nBring to the student's attention science role models with disabilities with a similar disability to that of the student. Point out that this individual got ahead by a combination of effort and by asking for help when needed. Generally, a person with learning disabilities may experience difficulties in study skills, writing skills, oral skills, reading skills, math skills, and social skills.\n\nIn studying, students may experience inability to organize time and may be unable to finish assignments on time. They also may have trouble taking notes and following instructions. They often have difficulty spelling correctly and may make frequent grammatical errors which results in poor sentence structure and poor penmanship. If the lecturer speaks too fast, they may have difficulty understanding the lecture and recalling the words. They are often slow readers and sometimes have incorrect comprehension and poor retention. They may be confused with math symbols and may have difficulty with concepts of time and money. Realizing their inabilities result in low self-esteem which can greatly affects their social skills. They might have impulsive behavior and be disorientated in time.\n\nDealing with students with learning disabilities, as with other students, requires that teachers have a good understanding of individual students\u2019 strengths and needs, and plan instruction to build on their strengths and address their needs. The following are some suggestions and guidelines for a teacher with students with learning disabilities.\n\nGeneral Courtesy\n\nDon't assume that the person is not listening just because you are getting no verbal or visual feedback. Don't assume that you have to explain everything to students with learning disabilities. They do not necessarily have a problem with general comprehension. Consult with the special education specialist to obtain help in understanding the specific nature of the learning disability for each student. Never assess a student's capabilities based solely on their IQ or other standardized test scores. Give student with learning disabilities priority in registration for classes. Allow course substitution for nonessential course requirements in their major studies. A student may have documented intelligence with test scores in the average to superior range with adequate sensory and motor systems and still have a learning disability. Learning disabilities often go undiagnosed, hence teacher observation can be a major source of identification. Bring to the student's attention science role models with disabilities with a similar disability to that of the student. Point out that this individual got ahead by a combination of effort and by asking for help when needed.\n\nTeacher Presentation\n\nAlways ask questions in a clarifying manner, then have the students with learning disabilities describe his or her understanding of the questions. Use an overhead projector with an outline of the lesson or unit of the day. Ensure that students have a managable course load. Provide clear photocopies of your notes and overhead transparencies, if the student benefits from such strategies. Provide students with chapter outlines or study guides that cue them to key points in their readings. Provide a detailed course syllabus before class begins. Ask questions in a way that helps the student gain confidence. Keep oral instructions logical and concise. Reinforce them with a brief cue words. Repeat or re-word complicated directions. Frequently verbalize what is being written on the chalkboard. Eliminate classroom distractions such as, excessive noise, flickering lights, etc. Outline class presentations on the chalkboard or on an overhead transparency. Outline material to be covered during each class period unit. (At the end of class, summarize the important segments of each presentation.)Establish the clarity of understanding that the student has about class assignments. Give assignments both in written and oral form. Have more complex lessons recorded and available to the students with learning disabilities. Have practice exercises available for lessons, in case the student has problems. Have students with learning disabilities underline key words or directions on activity sheets (then review the sheets with them). Have complex homework assignments due in two or three days rather than on the next day. Pace instruction carefully to ensure clarity. Present new and or technical vocabulary on the chalkboard or overhead. Provide and teach memory associations (mnemonic strategies). Support one modality of presentation by following it with instruction and then use another modality. Talk distinctly and at a rate that the student with a learning disability can be follow. Technical content should be presented in small incremental steps. Use plenty of examples, oral or otherwise, in order to make topics more applied. Use straight forward instructions with step-by-step unambiguous terms. (Preferably, presented one at a time). Write legibly, use large type; do not clutter the blackboard with non-current / non-relevant information. Use props to make narrative situations more vivid and clear. Assist the student, if necessary, in borrowing classmates' notes. Consider cross-age or peer tutoring if the student appears unable to keep up with the class pace or with complex subject matter. The more capable reader can help in summarizing the essential points of the reading or in establishing the main idea of the reading.\n\nLaboratory\n\nClearly label equipment, tools, and materials. Color code them for enhanced visual recognition. Consider alternate activities/exercises that can be utilized with less difficulty for the student, but has the same or similar learning objectives. Provide clear photocopies of your notes and overhead transparencies. For students with learning disabilities, make available cue cards or labels designating the steps of a procedure to expedite the mastering. Use an overhead projector with an outline of the lesson or unit of the day. Allow extended time for responses and the preparation and delivery of reports. In dealing with abstract concepts, use visual tools such as charts and graphs. Also, paraphrase and present them in specific terms, and sequence and illustrate them with concrete examples, personal experiences, or hands-on exercises. To minimize student anxiety, provide an individual orientation to the laboratory and equipment and give extra practice with tasks and equipment. Find areas of strength in the student's lab experiences and emphasize those as much as possible. Allow the students with learning disabilities the use of computers and spell checking programs on assignments.\n\nReading\n\nAnnounce readings as well as assignments well in advance. Find materials paralleling the textbook, but written at a lower reading level. (Also, include activities that make the reading assignment more relevant.) Introduce simulations to make abstract content more concrete. Make lists of required readings available early and arrange to obtain texts on tape from Recording for the Blind or a Reading/Typing Service. Offer to read written material aloud, when necessary. Read aloud material that is written on the chalkboard and on the overhead transparencies. Review relevant material, preview the material to be presented, present the new material then summarize the material just presented. Suggest that the students use both visual and auditory senses when reading the text. Rely less on textbooks. Reading for students with learning disabilities may be slow and deliberate, and comprehension may be impaired for the student , particularly when dealing with large quantities of material. Comprehension and speed usually dramatically increase with the addition of auditory input. Spend more time on building background for the reading selections and creating a mental scheme for the organization of the text. Encourage students to practice using technical words in exchanges among peers. Choose books with a reduced number of difficult words, direct non convoluted syntax, and passages that deliver clear meaning. Also, select readings that are organized by subheads because this aids in the flow of ideas. When writing materials for reading by students with learning disabilities, some of the strategies referred to in the reading section of the hearing impaired presentation will be appropriate. Allow the student to use a playback device, such as tape player, computer, mp3 player, etc...\n\nGroup Interaction and Discussion\n\nAlways ask questions in a clarifying manner, then have the students with learning disabilities describe his or her understanding of the questions. Assist the student, if necessary, in borrowing classmates discussion notes. Encourage questions during or after class to ensure that materials are understood by students with learning disabilities. Give individual conferences to guide students with learning disabilities to monitor progress and understanding of the assignment and of the course content. Give plenty of reinforcement when it is evident that the student with a learning disability is trying things that are made difficult by the disability. Have frequent question-and-answer sessions for students with learning disabilities.\n\nField Experiences\n\nAllow the students with learning disabilities the use of computers and spell checking programs on field notes and reports. Consider alternate activities/exercises that can be utilized with less difficulty for the student, but has the same or similar learning objectives.\n\nResearch\n\nReview and discuss with the student the steps involved in a research activity. Think about which step(s) may be difficult for the student's specific functional limitations and jointly devise accommodations for that student. Use appropriate laboratory and field strategies.\n\nTesting\n\nAvoid overly complicated language in exam questions and clearly separate items when spacing them on the exam sheet. (Refer to writing for students with hearing impairments in thereading section.) Consider other forms of testing (oral, hands-on demonstration, open-book etc.). Some students with learning disabilities find that large print helps their processing ability. Consider the use of illustrations by the students with learning disabilities as an acceptable form of response to questions in lieu of written responses. Eliminate distractions while students are taking exams. For students with perceptual problems, for whom transferring answers is especially difficult, avoid answer sheets, especially computer forms. Allow them to write answers (check or circle) on the test (or try to have them dictate their responses on a tape recorder.) For students who have reading difficulties, have a proctor read the test to the student. For students with writing difficulties, have someone scibe the answers for them or use a tape recorder to take down the answers. Gradually increase expectations as the students with learning disabilities gains confidence. Grant time extensions on exams and written assignments when there are significant demands on reading and writing skills. If distractions are excessive, permit the students with learning disabilities to take examinations in a separate quiet room with a proctor. Provide study questions for exams that demonstrate the format along with the content of the exam. Review with the student how to proofread assignments and tests. Do not test material just presented or outcomes just produced, since for the students with learning disabilities, additional time is generally required to assimilate new knowledge and concepts. Permit the students with learning disabilities the use of a dictionary, thesaurus, or a calculator during tests. Provide computer with spell check/grammar/ cut & paste features\n\nOrganizations\n\nCouncil for Exceptional Children - Division for Learning Disabilities (DLD)\n\nThe Division for Learning Disabilities (DLD) is one of 17 special interest groups of the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC).

Although learning disabilities occur in very young children, the disorders are usually not recognized until the child reaches school age. Research shows that 8 to 10 percent of American children under 18 years of age have some type of learning disability.\n\nTreatment The most common treatment for learning disabilities is special education. Specially trained educators may perform a diagnostic educational evaluation assessing the child's academic and intellectual potential and level of academic performance. Once the evaluation is complete, the basic approach is to teach learning skills by building on the child's abilities and strengths while correcting and compensating for disabilities and weaknesses. Other professionals such as speech and language therapists also may be involved. Some medications may be effective in helping the child learn by enhancing attention and concentration. Psychological therapies may also be used.\n\nPrognosis Learning disabilities can be lifelong conditions. In some people, several overlapping learning disabilities may be apparent. Other people may have a single, isolated learning problem that has little impact on their lives.\n\nResearch The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other Institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) support research learning disabilities through grants to major research institutions across the country.

A 2019 CDC report indicated 33% of high school students experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness. This number jumped to 44% during the pandemic. For those of us in the learning disability community, mental health issues permeate our everyday lives. The limited research we have supports a strong correlation between learning disabilities and mental health disorders. For example, one study found that individuals with learning disabilities report mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation at twice the rate of their non-disabled peers, even controlling for possible confounding factors. Another meta-analytic study shows varying rates of comorbidity, from 8% to 46.3%, for ADHD and anxiety among students with LD.\n\nYet, the causal relationship between mental health and learning disabilities is still poorly understood. The topic of mental health rates in the LD community came up time and time again in conversations among our Young Adult Leadership Council members, where for many of us mental health struggles are woven throughout our LD stories. We write this letter first as a note of acknowledgement to the LD community, second to bring awareness of this issue to a broader global community, and third to call in parents, teachers, policy makers, and researchers to help us address this issue.\n\nGenerally, poor mental health is associated with challenges with decision making, difficulty in school, difficulty forming positive relationships, and other risky or potentially harmful behaviors. Dual-disability diagnoses present even greater challenges, as many experience persistent stress, anxiety,, trauma, bullying, internalizing problems, and feelings of social isolation as they navigate a world with learning disabilities and mental health disorders. These negative experiences are especially concerning when you consider that almost one-third of incarcerated individuals report having a learning disability, and mental health issues affect approximately half of the incarcerated populations.\n\n\u201cNot being diagnosed until recently as an adult, I never understood why I struggled like I did. However, after my diagnosis, I realized that my anxiety and depressive episodes contributed to my perfectionism and impulsive choices. Undiagnosed individuals with ADHD face the harsh reality of being prone to depression and anxiety. It could lead someone to a pathway of substance abuse and impulsive decision making that can have serious consequences. When you live in a world where people don\u2019t understand individuals with attention issues, it can make you feel like something is inherently wrong with you, which can also contribute to depression.\u201d\n\n\u2014Misha Nicholas\n\nWe know that students with LD report more issues with mental health. However, that is the extent of the research. We do not know the cause of these lower mental health rates in students with learning disabilities. Anecdotal reports by students with LD suggest that many experience educational trauma. We need research in order to know the extent and impact of this educational trauma. Is educational trauma a risk factor for poor mental health?\n\nAs members and activists on the National Center for Learning Disabilities\u2019 Young Adult Leadership Council (YALC), we feel it is imperative to kick-start a solution-driven mental health initiative focused on the intersectionality of learning disabilities and mental health disorders. Many of us navigate life as learning disabled people struggling with mental health. Research suggests that promoting a sense of belonging and peer social support within schools can protect learning disabled individuals from many documented negative outcomes. Yet, many of us experienced various forms of educational trauma throughout education in the form of persistent academic failure, feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, bullying, social isolation, and ridicule. Educational trauma refers to the perpetual pattern of harmful cycles within educational systems that detrimentally affect academic and emotional outcomes.\n\n\u201cThe humiliation, bullying, and systematic exclusion was shattering beyond words. Eventually the educational trauma I experienced became a bigger barrier to learning than my actual learning disability.\u201d\n\n\u2014Erin\n\nMany young adults with learning disabilities describe their K\u201312 educational experiences as traumatic. They describe feelings of being misunderstood. Often, they report that those around them failed to understand their learning and mental health struggles, as they lacked the words to describe the shame they felt to the adults and peers in their lives. These struggles span well beyond weaknesses in reading, writing, and math. Mental health and learning disabilities are interwoven, and these challenges follow learning disabled individuals as they transition out of high school and into postsecondary education and the workplace.\n\n\u201cIt was not until undergrad that I learned that it isn\u2019t normal to feel like you can\u2019t breathe every time before attempting homework.\u201d\n\n\u2014Stevie Mays\n\nMany learning disabled people report feeling unsafe and like they do not belong in the classroom. In talking with almost any learning disabled person, they will tell you that their learning disability has impacted them far beyond just their struggle with learning skills like math and reading. They will tell you that existing as a learning disabled person impacts one\u2019s whole experience with the world, how the world interacts with them, and how they interact with the world. Yes, it\u2019s important for us to help LD students in academic areas like reading and writing. But if we fail to look beyond academics, at the whole person, we miss an entire aspect of the learning disabled experience. We miss what it actually means to exist as a learning disabled person.\n\n\u201cAt age 16, as everyone around me wrote in fine penmanship, I felt like a child still writing with red crayon. It didn\u2019t matter what or how well I wrote \u2013 I wasn\u2019t allowed to belong.\u201d\n\n\u2014Brody\n\nWhat are you doing personally to better understand and address the experiences of the learning disabled community and why our peers are pushed out of schools, into the prison system, into low-wage careers, and, in the best case, into college settings that don\u2019t support us?\n\nWe need to talk about mental illness for what it is: a disability. A disability that deserves the same support and focus as dyslexia, ADHD, and other learning disabilities.\n\nOur dyslexia, anxiety, ADHD, depression, dysgraphia, PTSD, and more are disabilities that need support, understanding, and recognition. Many of us on the YALC say that finding the LD community was the key to us feeling like we finally understood ourselves and were able to come out of our shame. We found strength in our shared experiences and were able to name many of our experiences for what they were: educational trauma. In doing so we found our voice, not only to share our stories but to advocate for our community as a whole.\n\nTo the LD person reading this, we see and empathize with your struggles. We encourage you to seek out your LD community and embrace your disability identity. The disability label (including mental health and learning disabilities) give you access to support and treatment. It also comes with a community that wants to welcome you in.\n\nFinally, this letter is a call to action \u2014 a call to our researchers, policy makers, educators, and parents and caregivers to better understand, address, and find solutions for the mental health needs of individuals with learning disabilities.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP!\n\nFor researchers:\n\nInclude mental health as measures in your data collection, and mental health disabilities as covariates.\n\nResearch educational trauma, including its prevalence and impact on students with learning disabilities.\n\nConduct holistic research on the experiences of LD students beyond our academic success, and understand the impact on our non-academic lives.\n\nResearch the intersection of mental health and learning disabilities, and specifically the experiences of BIPOC, LGBTQ+, and historically marginalized groups.\n\nInclude LD people in your research process beyond them being research subjects. Ensure that learning disabled people are a part of the research design process. Get feedback from the LD community and ensure that the research questions you ask are aligned with the values of the community you\u2019re studying. Hire LD people in your labs and centers so a good percentage of the next generation of people studying LD are LD themselves.\n\nFor policy makers:\n\nIncrease funding for early identification, treatment, and psychological support within schools. We need well-funded school-based mental health programs, school psychologists, counselors, and social workers.\n\nKeep your promise and fully fund IDEA, after over 40 years of never doing so.\n\nBan the practices of seclusion and restraint that have harmed and oppressed disabled students for decades.\n\nFor educators:\n\nMany of your students are walking into your classroom with years of educational trauma. You can end it. Focus on students\u2019 strengths while also acknowledging and building solutions to address our weaknesses, and listen to students when they are brave in sharing their experiences.\n\nBe aware of the interconnectedness of mental health and learning disabilities, and work with us to create strategies that address what we need and prevent negative outcomes.\n\nAvoid terms such as \u201clazy\u201d when you talk about your disabled students. We aren\u2019t lazy. We\u2019re trying our best.\n\nFor parents and caregivers:\n\nTalk about mental health with us, and help us own our identities as members of the disability community.\n\nLook for early warning signs of mental health issues and teach us to be self-advocates, so that when we\u2019re on our own, we\u2019ve got the skills to stand up for ourselves and the things we need to be successful learners.\n\nFor the learning disabled community:\n\nEmbrace your learning disability identity. Don\u2019t be afraid to use the language of disability. Taboo and stigma lead people to use euphemisms. But ultimately, our legal rights and our connection to community depend on identifying as disabled. We can end the stigma and taboo of being disabled by embracing this community.\n\nBe willing to talk about how mental health impacts you in school. We are functioning in school systems that are not designed for us and that \u201cothers\u201d us constantly. Allowing yourself to get support is the greatest gift you can give to yourself. We know it\u2019s hard to stick out as the one using accommodations, but you\u2019ll be glad you did.\n\nUnderstand that you\u2019ll need to self-advocate for both your LD and your mental health. This may look like telling your parents and educators what you need in a classroom setting to succeed. This means attending your IEP meeting and making sure your accommodations reflect your needs.\n\nThis call to action only scratches the surface of a larger conversation. Our voice matters. Join us in amplifying this initiative by signing below.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Young Adult Leadership Council"}]}
