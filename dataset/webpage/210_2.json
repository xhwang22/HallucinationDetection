{"Joe Holland attended Archbishop Mitty High School in San Jose, California.": [{"url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/06/05/san-jose-private-school-alumni-speak-out-about-the-racism-they-say-they-faced/", "page_content": "With racial justice at the forefront of conversations across the nation, alumni of some of San Jose\u2019s most acclaimed private schools have joined the chorus of voices to describe cultures of racism and discrimination they say administrators did little to quash.\n\nBy Friday morning, hundreds of current and former Archbishop Mitty High School students had taken to Twitter to share their stories using the hashtag #ExposeMitty. The students\u2019 stories ran the gamut \u2014 from teachers using the \u201cn\u201d word to minority students facing significantly harsher punishments than their white peers to a lack of recourse for those who endured racism and discrimination.\n\nAlumni said the social media movement was sparked by a former student who experienced racism during his time at Mitty and felt school administrators did not act promptly enough to denounce the death of George Floyd \u2014 a black man who was killed at the hands of white police officers last week in Minneapolis. The students are working to compile the list of stories, send it to school administrators and demand changes, which they are still developing.\n\nErica Johnson, a 2017 graduate who went on to attend the University of Southern California, tweeted that during her junior year at Mitty, she caught wind of a video posted on Snapchat by another student of her and her friends with the caption \u201cI feel like I\u2019m back in the hood.\u201d\n\nMitty is a high-performing Catholic high school on the west side of San Jose with an annual tuition of about $23,000. As one of only a few black students at the school, Johnson found the video racist and brought it to the attention of administrators.\n\n\u201cWhat amazes me the most is that we are a Catholic school with the motto along the lines that we are all created in the image and likeness of God\u2026I personally no longer feel safe in a place that is supposed to be one of the safest for a child,\u201d she wrote in an email to Dean of Students Jim Fallis and Principal Kate Caputo in August 2015.\n\nCaputo responded at the time that she was \u201ceager to hear from all sides to better understand how this situation came to fruition.\u201d\n\nAccording to Johnson, however, after she posted the email exchange on Twitter, she was \u201cshamed into apologizing to administrators.\u201d\n\n\u201cI, myself, the victim of racism should have been coddled and supported by the administrators and, instead, I was gaslighted and felt like I did something wrong,\u201d Johnson said in an interview.\n\nA black student who graduated in 2011 and played on the school\u2019s basketball and football teams said in an interview that one of his history teachers required him to defend the merits of slavery. \u201cAs the only black kid in that class, it was humiliating,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMitty\u2019s culture is focused on revenue generation and, as a result, the children of large donors walk around with impunity while minority children on scholarship are supposed to pick up trash to give back to the community,\u201d he said.\n\nFallis, Caputo and Mitty President Tim Brosnan did not return multiple requests for comment from this news organization. But in an email to alumni on Thursday, the administrators said they \u201cdid not talk about race as we should have in the past, and this has been detrimental to not only our students of color but the wider Mitty community.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough we recognize that discussions surrounding race are difficult, delicate, and often polarizing, we are committed to such discussions to ensure that racism will not be tolerated at Archbishop Mitty,\u201d the email said.\n\nAlumni at Mitty aren\u2019t the only ones demanding changes in San Jose private schools in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death and resounding calls for racial justice.\n\nOgechi Ajawara, a black alumna of Notre Dame San Jose, spoke out on Facebook earlier this week about the racism she said she was subjected to in high school, including a college counselor who discouraged her from writing about it out of fear it would make the school look bad.\n\n\u201cThe administration is filled with weak and racist people who call all the POC students together whenever they need a photo for the school\u2019s website. They only care about the image of the school, and that has been directly communicated to me for a long time,\u201d she wrote in the post that has since received more than 600 comments and 400 likes.\n\nIn a statement on its Facebook page later that day, Notre Dame addressed the Floyd killing for the first time since his death. \u201cWe call on all of us in the US to work with a great sense of urgency to eliminate systemic poverty and racism that is a part of our culture,\u201d the school wrote in a social media post.\n\nBut in an interview Friday, Notre Dame Principal Mary Beth Riley said it has become \u201cvery clear\u201d to her and her colleagues that their response \u201cwas not adequate.\u201d\n\nIn response to concerns raised by Ajawara and other alumni, Riley said the school will form a task force on race, equity and inclusion, start providing training for teachers and faculty on issues of inequality and make a donation to the Movement for Black Lives.\n\nMore than 500 alumni at Valley Christian Schools also banded together this week to write a list of 21 demands for the school system to make it more equitable. The demands include hiring more faculty members of color, implementing anti-bias and anti-aggression training for school personnel and strictly enforcing a zero-tolerance policy to racism and microaggressions.\n\n\u201cAs alumni, we look back on our VCS experience and recognize that some VCS administrative policies and practices failed to acknowledge and care for the specific needs of Black students and failed to teach non-Black students how to love and respect their Black brothers and sisters,\u201d they wrote in a letter to the school.\n\nAdministrators at Valley Christian Schools could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.\n\nThe movement organized by a former Mitty student on Twitter on Wednesday started with a call to his peers to \u201cshare their stories of racism\u201d at the school using the hashtag #ExposeMitty. But as the term picked up on social media, alumni began speaking out about other discrimination they say they experienced during their time at the school, including for their gender, sexual orientation and mental health.\n\n\u201cI know in my tweet above I created the hashtag as a way to address racism. However, after reading through the responses, I want this to be a platform for anyone to express any bad experiences or trauma they\u2019ve had at Mitty. You are all owed more than an apology,\u201d the organizer wrote on Twitter.\n\nAndrea Vo, a 2011 Mitty graduate who is now an openly proud transgender woman, said she was \u201ctargeted as one of the most flamboyant and openly queer students at school by administrators\u201d during her time at Mitty.\n\nBefore the senior prom, Vo said that when Fallis learned she intended to wear makeup and a dress, he pulled her out of class and told her she would be prohibited from entering the dance in a dress and would face detention for a dress code violation if she did.\n\n\u201cAs a young person discovering her trans identity, I felt ashamed and embarrassed,\u201d Vo said."}, {"url": "https://www.privateschoolreview.com/archbishop-mitty-high-school-profile", "page_content": "Email:\n\nName of parent:\n\nStudent first name:\n\nStudent last name:\n\nStudent date of birth: Month January February March April May June July August September October November December Year 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\n\nStudent is: Male Female\n\nCurrently in grade: Nursery Pre-K Gr.K 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n\nSeeking entry for grade: Nursery Pre-K Gr.K 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n\nTarget start date: Fall Spring Summer Immediately 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028\n\nPlease briefly describe academic, athletic, and extracurricular interests of the student:\n\nHome address:\n\nCity:\n\nCountry: Afghanistan Albania Algeria Antigua and Barbuda Argentina Australia Austria Azerbaijan Bahamas Bahrain Bangladesh Barbados Belgium Belize Bermuda Bolivia Bosnia-Herzegowina Botswana Brazil Brunei Darussalam Bulgaria Burma Cameroon Canada Cayman Islands Chile China Colombia Costa Rica Croatia Cyprus Czech Republic Czechia Denmark Dominican Republic Ecuador Egypt El Salvador England Estonia Ethiopia Finland France Germany Ghana Greece Guam Guatemala Haiti Honduras Hong Kong Hungary Iceland India Indonesia Iran Ireland Israel Italy Jamaica Japan Jordan Kazakhstan Kenya Kuwait Kyrgyzstan Latvia Lebanon Liechtenstein Lithuania Luxembourg Macau Macedonia Malaysia Maldives Malta Mauritius Mexico Monaco Mongolia Morocco Namibia Nepal Netherlands New Zealand Nicaragua Niger Nigeria Norway Oman Pakistan Panama Papau New Guinea Paraguay Peru Philippines Poland Portugal Puerto Rico Qatar Romania Russia Rwanda Saudi Arabia Senegal Serbia Singapore Slovakia Slovenia Somalia South Africa South Korea Spain Sri Lanka Sweden Switzerland Taiwan Tanzania Thailand Trinidad & Tobago Turkey Uganda Ukraine United Arab Emirates United Kingdom United States of America Uruguay Venezuela Vietnam Zambia Zimbabwe\n\nState: Select State Alaska Alabama Arkansas Arizona American Samoa California Colorado Connecticut DC, Washington Delaware Florida Federated States of Micronesia Georgia Guam Hawaii Iowa Idaho Illinois Indiana Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Massachusetts Maryland Maine Marshall Islands Michigan Minnesota Missouri Mississippi Montana North Carolina North Dakota Nebraska New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico Nevada New York Northern Mariana Islands Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Puerto Rico Palau Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Virgin Islands Washington Wisconsin West Virginia Wyoming\n\nZip: (enter \"N/A\" if not applicable)\n\nPhone:\n\nAllow nearby private schools to send me information.

At Archbishop Mitty, former students have taken to Twitter to call out racial discrimination from faculty and students under the hashtag \u201c#exposemitty.\u201d There have also been instances of racial injustice at Saint Francis, most notably when a group of alumni were linked to a racist Instagram post mocking George Floyd.\n\nShearin-Sewell spoke about the challenges he has experienced as a Black student at the predominantly Asian and white Archbishop Mitty.\n\n\u201cIt seems like there\u2019s more eyes on you,\u201d he told The Daily. \u201cYou\u2019re expected to uphold the standard. Even if that standard isn\u2019t who you are, you\u2019re expected to maintain that at all times, rather [than] just be yourself.\u201d\n\nPaige Ashton, who just graduated from Archbishop Mitty High School, said that she felt that same pressure at times.\n\n\u201cI felt the pressure of having to be the perfect Black person so I represented everyone else who looked like that,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, even though I shouldn\u2019t have to carry that burden, nor am I expected to, it was one that I felt I had to.\u201d\n\nThe administration at Saint Francis High School responded to this incident and other feedback from students and alumni with a Twitter post and statement on their website. This initial response from Saint Francis focused on organizing community events to address racism and discrimination. In an updated statement, the administration issued curriculum changes, school policy revisions and efforts to hire more diverse employees.\n\nThe school plans to implement an anti-bias curriculum, an ethnic studies graduation requirement and course offerings on social justice. School policy was revised to emphasize improving students\u2019 behavior and reducing excessive punishment. Lastly, per the administration\u2019s statement, Saint Francis will \u201cenact hiring practices that will ultimately lead to the school\u2019s educators reflecting the demographics of the Diocese of San Jose\u201d through making new hiring guidelines.\n\nLiam Tierney, a rising junior at Saint Francis high school, believes that these changes are a step in the right direction. He said, \u201cI feel like it\u2019s like it\u2019s good. Any change in that direction is good.\u201d\n\nHowever, Tierney recognizes the limitations of the school\u2019s actions, pointing out that not all students will respond positively to change.\n\n\u201cI feel like the people the school is trying to reach with [these measures] already have these views kind of set in their minds, so they\u2019re going to work to defend them,\u201d Tierney said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to work to listen and learn because they don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nLike Saint Francis, Archbishop Mitty high school posted a list of changes in an official statement on Twitter, including improving lines of communication between administration and the Archbishop Mitty community; better educating faculty, students and teachers on racism; and implementing more ways to look for more diverse staff.\n\nThe school also announced the creation of a subcommittee to select a diversity consultant for the school. To improve lines of communication between students and administrators, Mitty appointed Principal Kate Caputo as a liaison between the Archbishop Mitty community and the administration for race issues, and introduced programs to enhance administrative support for students of color, including implementing biannual listening sessions between students of color and the administration, and providing the Outreach program additional opportunities for discussions surrounding race.\n\nIn order to provide more complete education on racism, the administration added more staff development on how to support students of color; the Parent Education series investigated more resources to discuss race issues with students, and looked for ways to focus curriculum on the causes of injustice. Lastly, Mitty expanded resources to look to hire more diverse faculty and staff.\n\n\u201cThe administration will expand existing resources to seek greater diversity in applicant pools for faculty and staff hiring,\u201d the Archbishop Mitty administration wrote in their official statement.\n\nKaitlyn Springs, a rising senior, is cautiously optimistic about the appointment of Caputo as the point of contact at Mitty for issues about race. Springs said that she is \u201cunsure about the direction [this appointment] will actually go.\u201d\n\nAshton, who graduated from Mitty last year, praised Caputo\u2019s initiative, but also pointed out that \u201c[Caputo] personally hasn\u2019t been affected or directly discriminated against\u201d and added that she would prefer if the school hired a liaison who was not previously associated with the school, for a less biased stance.\n\nSprings believes that Mitty\u2019s lack of diversity within the administration also poses potential problems for hiring new staff and attracting diverse applicants.\n\n\u201cWhat [Mitty\u2019s] administration projects is not a big diverse face from the administration side\u2026 I don\u2019t think many diverse faces will be drawn in,\u201d Springs said.\n\nShearin-Sewell echoed Springs\u2019s sentiment when it comes to prospective students, adding that \u201cbased on the things [the students] heard before, even after being accepted, they don\u2019t want to come,\u201d he said.\n\nAt Stanford, the Catholic community has also implemented changes to address racial justice on campus. Education is one such change. Fifth year Ph.D. candidate Katie Wullert M.A. \u201917, who served as Vice President of the Catholic Community at Stanford ([email protected]), described some of this programming in an email to The Daily.\n\n[email protected] graduate leadership \u201cis currently working on a presentation and discussion examining racism in the church that is the kick off to a book club that will continue the conversation,\u201d Wullert said.\n\nAnother main element of change is direct service. Lourdes Alonso, the campus minister and advisor for student organizations at Stanford, announced plans for greater engagement with communities of color in East Palo Alto.\n\n\u201c[W]e partnered with the Francis of Assisi in East Palo Alto, and we\u2019re working with their pastor right now to set up some programming with the kids in the community,\u201d Alonso said.\n\nAlonso also emphasized the importance of seeing the service as accompaniment in order to truly make progress. She added, \u201cWe\u2019re going to open ourselves to growth. We\u2019re going to make ourselves vulnerable to change into thinking differently. And then allowing \u2014 I\u2019m Brown, by the way \u2014 our Black and Brown brothers and sisters to share with us ways that we could work for systemic changes. So then, then that\u2019s another piece is like, what in a system needs to change?\u201d\n\nStudents at Bay Area Catholic high schools generally saw these changes as steps in the right direction. There was, however, one change that students unanimously called for: implementing stricter and more clear-cut policies against racism.\n\nA new Supreme Court ruling on July 8 may threaten this progress not only within the Bay Area Catholic community but also within the Catholic community at large. The ruling declared that Catholic schools could discriminate against ministerial employees \u2014 those who carry out some sort of religious duty, whether it be a priest or religion teacher \u2014 based on race, age, sexual orientation, gender identity and other factors.\n\nAlonso believes that the Supreme Court ruling could mean only upholding certain parts of Catholic teaching and not supporting other aspects.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t discriminate on very specific parts of people\u2019s lives,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s not what [the Catholic] teaching says.

Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate\n\nSue Phillips has been piling up honors for decades. A couple more this month have led her to reflect on her career.\n\nThe Mitty girls basketball coach, a 1986 graduate of the school, was inducted into the San Jose Sports Hall of Fame on Nov. 9 and two days later learned she was a nominee to the Women\u2019s Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible week,\u201d said Phillips, who has more coaching wins than any girls high school basketball coach in Northern California history (761) and six state championships. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful to be acknowledged.\u201d\n\nPhillips is a member of the Women\u2019s Basketball Hall of Fame committee, so she has spent the past few weeks reviewing the process for nominations. She didn\u2019t know that the rest of the committee had been reviewing her qualifications.\n\nShe was watching the Nov. 11 South Carolina-Maryland game on ESPN when the nominees were announced. That was when she saw her name among the 12 nominees.\n\n\u201cI was floored,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so surprised and honored; what a really cool thing to be a finalist, and to see it like that.\u201d\n\nPhillips\u2019 Monarchs were ranked 12th in the country by ESPN heading into this season, her 30th at the San Jose school.\n\nPhillips, who is also a math teacher at Mitty, has coached more than 50 players who went on to play in Division I, including Stanford\u2019s Haley Jones, one of the top players in the country.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a really tough coach,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe relationship I created with her was one where she could get on me every day. I took that and knew it was from a place of her wanting me to reach my full potential.\u201d\n\nJones said Phillips \u201cnot letting up\u201d on her during some of her rough days helped her grow, and her support to encourage her to keep at it was an essential balance.\n\nWith USA Basketball, Phillips has coached the likes of Arike Ogunbowale, Katie Lou Samuelson, AD Durr, Aliyah Boston, and Paige Bueckers. Earlier this month, JuJu Watkins \u2014 one of Phillips\u2019 U17 players \u2014 committed to USC as the top recruit in the country.\n\nAshley Hiraki, a junior at Santa Clara, recalled a game in her senior year at Mitty when the team was down by 20 at halftime. Phillips\u2019 speech was motivational, Hiraki said, and that \u201cstruck momentum for the rest of the season.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was a huge influence on me,\u201d said Hiraki. \u201cShe is someone you listen to. I wouldn\u2019t be where I am without her.\u201d\n\nThe 2018 Mitty team, led by Jones and Hiraki, earned top national rankings from ESPN, MaxPreps and USA Today and was declared the mythical national champion by USA Today and espnW.\n\nPhillips has been named National Coach of the Year by the WBCA, Naismith and Gatorade, and in 2019 coached the McDonald\u2019s All-American Game. She won gold medals with USA Basketball\u2019s U16 national team at the 2013 FIBA Americas tournament and the U17 team at the FIBA World Cup the next year. This summer, she won U17 gold at the FIBA World Cup in Hungary.\n\nA top player herself while at Mitty, Phillips had an offer to play basketball at Cal, but ultimately opted to play softball at Northwestern, where she was an All-Big Ten selection. In the end, she returned to basketball and the Bay Area, spending time as an assistant coach at Cal between coaching stints at her alma mater.\n\nShe was inducted into the Mitty Athletic Hall of Fame in 1998 for her accomplishments as a three-sport athlete (basketball, softball and volleyball).\n\nBut for all her athletic success, coaching was her true calling.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the midst of doing something, it\u2019s just your day-to-day,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cI love coaching and enjoy teaching young people. To hit the pause button and be acknowledged for those efforts is a great feeling.\u201d\n\nPhillips said it was special to have both of her parents at the San Jose Hall of Fame induction, and to have shared all her successes with them over her career.\n\nMitty finished 30-2 and No. 1 in The Chronicle\u2019s final 2021-22 rankings. This season\u2019s team maintained that spot in the preseason rankings and is led by 6-foot-1 senior Morgan Cheli, who was part of the Phillips-coached U17 World Cup championship team over the summer.\n\nWhile Phillips develops another generation of top players, her legacy \u2014 and her list of awards \u2014 continues to expand.\n\n\u201cShe deserves everything she\u2019s getting,\u201d Jones said. \u201cShe\u2019s an amazing coach and has built an amazing program. She shapes us to come to the next level and succeed.\u201d\n\nMarisa Ingemi is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
