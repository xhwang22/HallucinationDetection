It was however a transfer which was not originally met with universal approval from the Bhoys support.\n\nNaylor had spent all his career at Wolves and following soon after the dismal failure of Mo Camera, a free transfer from Burnley, the Celtic support were not pleased at the club looking once more towards the English Championship in their bid to solve the problematic left-back position.\n\nFor his part, Naylor was delighted to have secured a move to Parkhead, and his enthusiasm and obvious joy at joining Celtic was evident in his early interviews as well as his performances on the pitch. Indeed within weeks of arriving, Naylor had won over most of the Celtic support with his energetic and tenacious play.\n\nAn over-lapping full back, Naylor was an asset in both attack and defence. Eager to get forward and get a cross into the box, Naylor also ensured he didn\u2019t neglect his primary role and worked hard in curtailing opposition attacks. Although his performances dipped by the end of that season he had done enough to be nominated as a candidate for the SPFA Player of the Year Award 2006/07.\n\nCracks had however began to appear in his play and as the new season began, Naylor appeared to be a different player from the one that impressed during his first six months at the club. His distribution was dire, good opportunities were squandered by over-hit crosses and misplaced passes. Defensively he was often caught out of position and looked uncomfortable when players ran at him with the ball\n\nLess than a year after giving hope that Celtic\u2019s search for a quality left-back could be over, it appeared that Naylor, like many before him, was not the answer. He did however retain a regular starting spot \u2013 scoring his first goal in a vital win over Hibs (s cracker of a goal he scored v Hibs was to everyone\u2019s surprise but more than deserving of all the plaudits that came his way after it) \u2013 as Celtic dramatically battled back to claim the 2007/08 championship and their third title in a row.\n\nSeason 2008/09 saw Celtic surrender their grip on the league title and once more Naylor\u2019s performances were frequently criticised by the support. A seemingly likeable character off the pitch, Naylor, despite his obvious failings on the park, he never gave anything less than his all in the Hoops but the fact remained that the left-back slot remained a significant weakness within the Celtic team.\n\nThe arrival in July 2009 of the highly rated Danny Fox from Coventry \u2013 ironically another Championship team \u2013 appeared to spell the end of Naylor\u2019s days as the first choice left-back at Parkhead. Naylor made a number of cameo appearances filling in for Fox when the ex-Sky Blues man was injured.\n\nWhen Danny Fox surprisingly exited Parkhead prematurely in the January transfer window, Bhoys boss Tony Mowbrary underlined his reluctance to use Naylor by bringing in Dutch internationalist Edson Braafheid on loan from Bayern Munich. The Dutchman disappointed, and following the departure of Mowbray the interim Celtic manager Neil Lennon recalled Naylor to the starting line-up. Patience from Naylor had paid off.\n\nTo Lee Naylor\u2019s credit he came good, and to the surprise of most he played a strong part and put the Dutch internationalist in the shade (where notably Braafheid later played in the World Cup final at the end of the season). Admittedly no stunning performances, but he still managed to hit the jackpot and grab a goal against Rangers in the final league derby match in May 2010. Something that he will prize. It may have been a deflection from his free-kick but it was still one more goal than Danny Fox scored this season from free-kicks (and Danny Fox was meant to be a free-kick specialist). Naylor had caught the eye of sections of the support and all were happy for him.\n\nHowever, with a new manager to come, the squad had to be refreshed and Lee Naylor had been in and out for the last couple of seasons. He was released on a free in June 2010, and despite the criticisms from sections of the support, he will be fondly remembered by the majority for his time and effort. He got himself a goal v Rangers and for that invaluable moment the support will remember him very fondly. At least he was leaving after a fine final run of form.\n\nWe wished him all the best.\n\nPost-Celtic\n\nAfter Celtic, he had spells at Cardiff, Accrington and Derby, and appears to have finally hung up his boots in 2015.\n\nHe never lost his Celtic roots, and played in front of 48,000 supporters for a \u2018Celtic Legends\u2018 select side at Anfield v their Liverpool counterparts in a charity match in March 2023, winning the chance to relive old glories.\n\nPlaying Career\n\nClub From To Fee League Scottish/FA Cup League cup Other Cardiff 01/08/2010 Free Celtic 25/08/2006 01/08/2010 \u00a3600,000 95 (5) 3 12 (0) 0 5 (0) 0 22 (3) 0 Wolves 01/08/1997 25/08/2006 Trainee Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals\n\n2009/10 Statistics TEAM Competition GS SB G A SH SG FC FS YC RC Celtic UEFA Europa League 1 2 0 0 1 0 1 3 1 0 Celtic Scottish Premier League 11 1 1 2 9 6 7 11 1 0 Celtic Scottish Cup 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2009/10 Season Totals 14 3 1 2 10 6 8 14 2 0 2008/09 Statistics TEAM Competition GS SB G A SH SG FC FS YC RC Celtic Scottish Cup 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Celtic Scottish Premier League 19 4 1 1 5 3 18 21 2 0 Celtic Scottish CIS Insurance Cup 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2008/09 Season Totals 23 4 1 1 5 3 18 21 2 0 2007/08 Statistics TEAM Competition GS SB G A SH SG FC FS YC RC Celtic UEFA Champions League 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 Celtic Scottish Premier League 33 0 1 1 12 4 41 32 4 0 Celtic Scottish Cup 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2007/08 Season Totals 36 0 1 1 12 4 41 32 5 0 2006/07 Statistics TEAM Competition GS SB G A SH SG FC FS YC RC Celtic Scottish CIS Insurance Cup 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Celtic Scottish Cup 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Celtic Scottish Premier League 32 0 0 3 7 2 29 30 7 0 2006/07 Season Totals 38 0 0 3 7 2 29 30 7 0\n\nGS: Games Started, SB: Used as Substitute,\n\nG: Goals, A: Assists, SH: Shots, SG: Shots on goal,\n\nYC: Yellow Cards, RC: Red Cards,\n\nFC: Fouls Committed, FS: Fouls Suffered,\n\nSV: Saves, OF: Offsides, W: Wins, D: Draws, L: Losses\n\nHonours with Celtic\n\nScottish Premier League\n\nScottish Cup\n\nPictures"}, {"url": "https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/sport/football/lee-naylor-reveals-two-celtic-20624006", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nGet the latest Celtic F.C updates, transfer news and analysis from Football Scotland delivered straight to your inbox every day for free\n\nFormer Celtic left-back Lee Naylor claims Neil Lennon had his hands tied over transfers before being shown the door at Parkhead.\n\nNaylor enjoyed a four-year stint for the Hoops between 2006 and 2010, winning two Premiership titles and one Scottish Cup during his time in Glasgow, and has since became an agent since hanging up his boots.\n\nNaylor even played under Lennon during his time with the Hoops and has revealed he submitted several players for the club's hierarchy to consider during the Northern Irishman's most recent tenure.\n\nBut it seems the manager might not have had the final say on potential incomings, as Naylor told the Celtic Huddle podcast : \u201cI put a few in at the start of the season but there was no takers.\n\n\u201cThere was a centre midfielder and striker.

In all competitions, the Bhoys were floundering. Protest filled the winter air, as fans congregated [Herald] outside Paradise on two occasions.\n\nIt was an unusual sight. Admittedly, small protests against the board, via tifos and literature had become commonplace. However, an actual revolt was a sight to behold. In a decade of dominance, there were still rumblings of discontent, but this was mutiny.\n\nAnd it was quite reasonable. This season was utterly dismal, and we\u2019ll be counting the cost of the board\u2019s inaction for a while yet. Even if normal service resumes in 21-22, the scars of this campaign will take a while to heal. If, that is, they heal at all.\n\nReflecting on this season, Lee Naylor joined Mark Wilson and Simon Donnelly for a chat on the Celtic Huddle Podcast. What\u2019s more, he didn\u2019t hold back when talking about the failures of 20-21.\n\nSpeaking about the awful form and the protests outside Paradise, Naylor said [Celtic Huddle Podcast]:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not Celtic. That\u2019s not the Celtic I know, anyways. I never thought in my time that I\u2019d see Celtic fans gathering outside the club, in that much disappointment.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t nice to see, obviously I don\u2019t condone bad behaviour and violence, but that was the lowest point for me, to see that.\n\nAsked about whether there were any positives to this season, Naylor curtly replied:\n\n\u201cKnowing who to get rid of.\n\n\u201cAt least now you can rebuild, and rebuild to know who wants to be at Celtic. Clear out who wants to be there and who doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n\nLee Naylor doesn\u2019t hold back, but nor should he: Celtic let supporters down this season\n\nEssentially, just so he isn\u2019t misconstrued, what Naylor is saying is that he didn\u2019t expect fans to be so disappointed by the club, that they\u2019d (rightly) protest. Just so we\u2019re on the same page.\n\nIt\u2019s clear Naylor took a lot from being at Celtic. Across the whole podcast, the former Wolves man drops \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d throughout. Signed by Gordon Strachan in 2006, Naylor was shortlisted for the Player of the Year honours in 2007 [BBC].\n\nOver 4 years and 100 appearances, Naylor established himself as Strachan\u2019s first-choice left-back, before his contract expired in 2010.\n\nAnd, on this evidence, he\u2019s clearly hurt by what the supporters have been through this season. Clearly, he counts himself in that number."}, {"url": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5528472/celtic-naylor-brown-threatening-break-legs/", "page_content": "FORMER Celtic star Lee Naylor has revealed the shock to the system he got before his very first match in Scottish football - when future Celtic skipper Scott Brown threatened him before kick off.\n\nBrown was a feisty 20-year-old right midfielder in the colours of first club Hibs when Naylor was persuaded north by Gordon Strachan after nine years at Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\n2 Brown and Naylor went on to become team-mates and pals Credit: Kenneth Ramsay\n\nSpeaking to Si Ferry in the latest Open Goal - Keeping the Ball on the Ground podcast, Naylor told the story of his first encounter with a man who would go on to become a team-mate at Parkhead.\n\nIt came in a 2-1 Celtic win in the East End of Glasgow back in August 2006 - in which Brown opened the scoring for the visitors within eight minutes.\n\nNaylor said: \"My first taste of Scottish football was against Browny.\n\n\"My first game was Hibs at home, he was playing right midfield and I was left back.\n\n2 Naylor had four campaigns at Celtic Credit: Kenny Ramsay - The Sun Glasgow\n\n\"This was my first meeting with Browny.\n\n\"I am walking out, we've done our warm ups and that and we are out for kick off.\n\n\"I am walking across the field and Browny comes running right next to me and says 'I am going to break your legs'.\n\n\"He must have been what, about six years younger than me, he was 20 at the time, and I was like 'Is this kid for real or what?'\n\n\ud83c\udfa5\u26bd\ufe0f| Lee Naylor tells us about how his first introduction to Scottish Football was getting threatened by @HibernianFC's @ScottBrown8 in the tunnel before his @CelticFC debut \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\n\n\nFull Interview MONDAY @ 5PM w/ @WilliamHill pic.twitter.com/ot5uVf3Jez \u2014 Open Goal (@opengoalsport) April 24, 2020\n\n\"Obviously they went and scored, they went 1-0 up.\n\n\"He has come running up to me and said 'I am going to be on you all game, you aren't going to get anything, break you in two'\n\n\"I was thinking 'oh my Lord what have I come to here'.\n\nAsked by Ferry if his future team-mate had impressed him on the day, Naylor replied: \"Aye he was good but we got the winner with me going on down the line.\n\n\"I said alright to him after that.\n\nStrachan must have been impressed anyway, because Brown moved to Celtic at the end of that season for \u00a34.5million.\n\nNow 34, the midfielder has led the Parkhead club to a catalogue of major honours in the 13 years since then.\n\nFerry said: \"He was a wee wideo, wasn't he?\"\n\nThe full podcast airs on Monday.\n\nKeep up to date with ALL the latest news and transfers at the Scottish Sun football page"}, {"url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/lee-naylor-ill-be-a-celtic-player-1035257", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nGet the latest Celtic news sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter\n\nLEE NAYLOR insists he'll fight for his place at Celtic until told he is surplus to requirements.\n\nThe left-back came on as a sub against Arsenal in midweek and many people felt that may have been his final curtain call for the club.\n\nNaylor's no longer a first pick since Tony Mowbray brought Danny Fox from Coventry for \u00a31.5million.\n\nThe Englishman has been linked with a move away with Portsmouth apparently keen on signing him.\n\nA transfer switch could happen before Tuesday's 5pm deadline but Naylor - who is contracted until the end of the season - admits he's as much in the dark as anyone.\n\nLee (left) said: \"There's been a bit of speculation but I'm still at Celtic.

No matter how long is gone I have a belief, and the team has a belief, we are going to win every game.\n\n\"It is a good habit to have and it is brilliant going into matches feeling like that.\n\n\"Confidence is high.

He is just as important as anybody else in the team.\n\n\"He has provided Scott with a lot of the ball, flick-ons and the runs he makes. They work together and their partnership is credit to both their goals.\"\n\nMany of which have been created by McGeady, a player he believes is destined for one of the big four in the Premiership at some point in his career. But Naylor hopes that will be later rather than sooner.\n\nHe added: \"Being selfish, I hope he stays here. If he keeps doing the things he is doing he is going to have big teams looking at him. That is what is happening.\n\n\"I don't think anybody could sway him away from Celtic apart from one of the big four down south.\n\n\"It might be his personal choice to go to Spain but I think he should stay at Celtic although the Premiership would suit him better than Spain.

He is scoring goals and creating them and that is all credit to him.\n\n\"He is up there with the top players in the Champions League.

He said: \"I like to leave him to what he does best. That is running, attacking and taking on defenders.\n\n\"It is good when he tracks back and helps me but we have a relationship where I let him go and do what he does best and I try to give him all the confidence in the world.

Ross McCrorie has been linked with a move to Bristol City, while Duk has admitted that he is also eyeing a move south at some point.

The Ibrox side dropped just two points (a draw against Celtic) in their first 15 league games under new manager Michael Beale and still could not put a dent in that deficit.\n\nAnge Postecoglou's side were relentless before the World Cup and were equally as ruthless after it until the title was clinched. Their quest to amass a record points tally was brought to a halt after a sobering 3-0 defeat at Rangers last month but the title was virtually assured since November. A 3-2 win over Rangers at Parkhead in April snuffed out any hope the visitors may have had of reigniting a title race in the closing stages of the season.\n\nA win over Inverness Caledonian Thistle at Hampden in the Scottish Cup final on Saturday clinched a fifth treble in seven years, although it may be the last time Celtic fans see their Australian boss leading their side.\n\nMid-season rating 8/10\n\nImage: Ange Postecoglou has won back-to-back titles at Celtic\n\nWhat do they need?

However, the Celtic manager has emerged as the preferred candidate for the vacant Tottenham job and, this time, the speculation is not going away. If the Australian departs after two seasons in the east end then Celtic will look to act quickly to appoint a successor to minimise disruption to their summer plans.

Their brilliant form at Rugby Park saved this side after they picked up just two wins and scored 11 goals away from home all campaign.\n\nFor now, those figures are irrelevant but McInnes knows that the hard work of recruitment - especially finding a striker to hit double figures next time around - continues in the summer.\n\nMid-season rating 6/10\n\nImage: Kilmarnock's Kyle Vassell celebrates scoring to make it 3-1 during a Premiership match between Kilmarnock and Ross County\n\nWhat do they need? McInnes will want guarantees that Kilmarnock will build on their first season back in the top flight rather than be satisfied with it. Killie are not yet expected to reach the heights of European qualification achieved in Steve Clarke's tenure but they will be keen to ensure that they don't become a club that flirts with relegation every year.\n\nThe former Aberdeen boss will want to be backed in the summer with the idea of pushing for a top six spot as opposed to constantly looking down. McInnes signed a three-and-a-half-year extension to his contract in October and appears to be in it for the long haul.\n\nStar man: Danny Armstrong\n\nLivingston 7/10\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Highlights of St Johnstone against Livingston in the Scottish Premiership.\n\nLivingston's form since the turn of the year has been a concern. David Martindale's side finished where they realistically should have in the table but the manager has exceeded expectations plenty of times in the past and his side were in with a chance of a top-six finish again just before the split.\n\nHowever, Livi have won just six times since the start of 2023. Martindale said recently that either new players needed to be brought in or he would have to think about his position if results continue to be a concern but the club would surely focus on actioning the former. Martindale has been a revelation in West Lothian.\n\nDespite that, Livi have not been scoring enough goals - they were the lowest scoring side in the division with 36 - and have gone from having one of the tightest defences in the league to the joint-fourth worst for conceding.\n\nLivingston had reasonable aspirations of challenging for a European spot going into 2023 but the drop off is perhaps not unsurprising given budgets and squad depth. Indeed, Martindale was happy to have secured Premiership safety after top six hopes were extinguished.\n\n\"To be honest, I'd have bit your hand off to not be in a relegation battle at the start of the season,\" he said. \"I spoke to folk at Ross County who said 'keep your head up, you've had a great season' and the same at Kilmarnock. I'm going home absolutely devastated after defeats. It hurts. It really hurts, and I'll do absolutely everything within my power to turn the corner.\"\n\nMid-season rating 8/10\n\nImage: Livingston's Joel Nouble (L) celebrates with teammate Bruce Anderson\n\nWhat do they need? A trip to Almondvale used to be a real concern for both halves of the Old Firm but that trepidation has disappeared over the past 12 months or so. Livingston have become easier to play against and, while they have never been a side that scored freely under Martindale, they were always difficult to break down. The Livi boss needs to freshen the squad and quite possibly get back to being that team that no one wants to play again.\n\nStar man: Jon Nouble\n\nMotherwell 7/10\n\nImage: Motherwell's Kevin van Veen celebrates scoring to make it 1-1\n\nStuart Kettlewell's name did not appear among the nominees for the PFA Manager of the Year award - understandably so, given he was only appointed in February - but few bosses have impacted upon a side's fortunes the way he has this season.\n\nMotherwell had not won in the league since October before Kettlewell took charge on a temporary basis in February with the club slipping into the relegation battle under previous boss Stevie Hammell.\n\nKettlewell got the job full time after initial back-to-back wins and has not looked back - Motherwell have finished as best of the rest outside the top six, becoming one of only two Scottish teams to stop Celtic winning at Parkhead this season in the process, and their manager has stated his desire to start challenging for Europe as opposed to flirting with relegation.\n\nThey had the best defensive record in the league outside of the Old Firm and, with Kevin van Veen finishing with 25 goals for the season, it is no surprise in the end they secured their top flight status with plenty to spare.\n\nMid-season rating 5/10\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Highlights of the Scottish Premiership match between Celtic and Motherwell.\n\nWhat do they need? The likelihood is that the prolific Van Veen will depart North Lanarkshire in the summer and who knows where Motherwell would have been this season without his goals.

Giovanni van Bronckhorst had no luck with injuries but a disastrous Champions League campaign coupled with being booed off the pitch by their own supporters following stale domestic performances meant an exit was all but inevitable for the Dutchman.\n\nMichael Beale did steady the ship, going on an unbeaten 15-game run after taking the reins but he could not stop Celtic's march to the title, even if Rangers did secure a morale-boosting 3-0 win in the Old Firm at Ibrox in May. That will count for little as Celtic pick up another treble after two Hampden wins in the League Cup final and Scottish Cup semi-final over the Gers but Beale at least has something to work with over the summer as the likes of Ryan Kent and Alfredo Morelos bid farewell, probably a year too late.\n\nThe January additions of Nicolas Raskin and Todd Cantwell have given supporters hope that summer recruitment will be a marked improvement on what has come before but Beale has a major rebuild on his hands, with the club in transition on and off the pitch.\n\nMid-season rating 4/10\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Rangers say goodbye to departing players including Ryan Kent and Alfredo Morelos after their last home game of the season.\n\nWhat do they need?

Jordan White bagged 11 goals and Yan Dhanda scored six, including one in the play-off final, but Owura Edwards and Alex Iacovitti were next on the list, only managing three each in the league.

On average, winners placed second before their subsequent win. In contrast, Leicester finished 2014/15 in 14th, 46 points adrift of league winners Chelsea. Their remarkable escape from relegation wasn't a traditional platform for a title challenge.\n\nRanieri's first Premier League win Claudio Ranieri has become the eighth different manager to win the Premier League title.\n\nIndeed, their much-publicised 5,000/1 title odds illustrate just how far out of the running they were expected to be. It wasn't until a 3-1 win at Manchester City in February when thoughts of a sustained Leicester title challenge began to gather credence.\n\nA last-gasp defeat to Arsenal next time out was billed as a potentially fatal blow to Leicester's unlikely hopes - but their response was one of champions, taking 23 points from the next 27 available.

The first part ran to the end of December and saw Leicester register the joint-most goals in the division at that point but also concede more than any other team in the top half.\n\nHowever, as the title-race pressure told, there was a clear shift from the open, expansive football of high-flying underdogs to a more solid, clinical approach which reflected Leicester's determination to capitalise on their strong start to the campaign.\n\nLeicester conceded 25 times in their first 19 matches of the season. They let in just nine in their next 17. Five 1-0 wins in six games from the end of February summed up their altered style and, with two games still to play, they have already won more matches by the odd goal (14) than the 10.9 average for previous Premier League winners.\n\nLeicester's season of two halves Up to December 31, 2015 From January 1, 2016 Total Played 19 17 36 Won 11 11 22 Drew 6 5 11 Lost 2 1 3 Goals scored 37 27 64 Goals against 25 9 34 Points 39 38 77\n\nDoing it on a budget\n\nBankrolled by a billionaire Thai owner, Leicester are hardly operating on a shoestring budget. But a comparison of the value of their typical starting XI to previous Premier League winners demonstrates Ranieri's remarkable efforts in getting the best out of a squad acquired at the fraction of the cost.\n\nLeicester's most-used starting XI this season cost them just \u00a323m to assemble. That's almost 10 times less than Chelsea's 2014/15 winners - and Manchester City and Manchester United fielded teams worth over \u00a3150m in their recent triumphant seasons.\n\nKeeping it fun\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player A collection of Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri's most amusing quotes over the season.\n\nThere were no mind games from Ranieri, just humble press conferences - and the promise of pizza for his players if they kept clean sheets. Twenty years on from Kevin Keegan's rant at Sir Alex Ferguson, neither the Leicester boss nor his Tottenham counterpart saw fit to try to wind the other up.\n\nInstead, Ranieri's focus was on getting to 40 points in the first half of the campaign - long after Leicester seemed certain of survival. Later, he insisted his team were just enjoying the ride. The mood spread through the club, with owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha dishing out free beer and doughnuts to celebrate his birthday before a game against Southampton.\n\nMuch has been made of the camaraderie between the Leicester players. Ranieri has helped to maintain that spirit throughout the campaign - and the club have reaped the rewards."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/scottish-premiership/table", "page_content": "1 team hasn't moved Celtic 38 32 3 3 114 34 80 99 W Won 2 - 0 against Heart of Midlothian on May 7th 2023.

After his death, the former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr wrote on Twitter: \u201cGod bless Dr John, peace and love to all his family. I love the doctor, peace and love.\u201d\n\n\u2018Ranking\u2019 Roger Charlery\n\nThe Beat singer\n\nAs vocalist with The Beat, Ranking Roger spearheaded the two-tone movement with a distinctive vocal style influenced by the Jamaican rap technique of toasting. The group enjoyed several top 10 hits, most famously Mirror in the Bathroom - the first digitally recorded single released in the UK. Their 1980 cover of Andy Williams\u2019 Can\u2019t Get Used To Losing You was used as the main sample on Beyonce\u2019s 2016 hit Hold Up.\n\nLaShawn Daniels\n\nGrammy-winning songwriter\n\nHe co-wrote such hits as Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s Grammy-winning Say My Name and Lady Gaga\u2019s Telephone. Daniels, who was known as Big Shiz, also worked with artists including Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Brandy and Toni Braxton.\n\nJames Ingram\n\nR&B singer-songwriter\n\nThe Grammy-winner and Oscar-nominee had two US number ones, with the smooth soul ballads Baby Come To Me and I Don\u2019t Have The Heart.

Fellow musician Drake, who won a Grammy on the same night, took to Instagram to pay tribute to the 33-year-old: \u201cMy whole energy is just at a low right now hearing this\u2026 You were having the best run and I was so happy watching from distance fam nobody ever talks down on your name you were a real one to your people and to the rest of us.\u201d\n\nJuice Wrld\n\nRapper\n\nThe musician, real name Jarad Anthony Higgins, rose to fame in 2018 with hit singles All Girls Are the Same and Lucid Dreams. More plaudits followed the release of his first studio album, Goodbye & Good Riddance - and his second album Death Race for Love topped the Billboard chart this year.\n\nRic Ocasek\n\nLead singer of The Cars\n\nThe US band - formed in Boston in the mid-1970s by Ocasek and Benjamin Orr - helped kick-start the new wave movement. Merging guitar rock with synthesizer-based pop, their early hits included Just What I Needed, My Best Friend\u2019s Girl and Good Times Roll. Their 1984 ballad Drive was used as background music for footage of the Ethiopian famine, and its re-release as a single after Live Aid helped raise money for the cause.\n\nEddie Money\n\nTake Me Home Tonight singer\n\nBorn Edward Joseph Mahoney in New York, Money had major US chart success in the 70s and 80s with songs such as Two Tickets to Paradise and Take Me Home Tonight. He released 11 albums and sold nearly 30 million records in a career that spanned four decades.\n\nGinger Baker\n\nCream drummer\n\nHe was one of the most innovative and influential drummers in rock music. A co-founder of Cream, Ginger Baker also played with Blind Faith, Hawkwind and Fela Kuti in a long and varied career. His style combined the lyricism of jazz with the crude power of rock. One critic said watching him was like witnessing \u201ca human combine harvester\u201d.\n\nHal Blaine\n\nProlific and influential drummer\n\nOver the course of his career he played on countless hits by Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, The Beach Boys and John Lennon, amongst others. According to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which inducted him in 2000, Blaine \u201ccertainly played on more hit records than any drummer in the rock era, including 40 number one singles and 150 that made the [US] top 10\u201d. His most recognisable riff is the \u201cboom-ba-boom-crack\u201d bar that opens The Ronettes\u2019 Be My Baby.\n\nMalcolm \u2018Molly\u2019 Duncan\n\nAverage White Band saxophonist\n\nDuncan attended Dundee Art College with fellow band members Roger Ball and Alan Gorrie.

Fredriksson and bandmate Per Gessle (both pictured) achieved their biggest success when It Must Have Been Love was re-written for inclusion on the Pretty Woman film soundtrack in 1990. The song topped the charts in more than 10 countries and gave Roxette their biggest UK hit, reaching number three.\n\nBoon Gould\n\nLevel 42 musician\n\nRoland Charles \u201cBoon\u201d Gould (pictured left) was one of the founding members of the 1980s pop group, playing guitar and saxophone between 1980 and 1987 - and reuniting for a one-off performance in 2012.

Their album - Getz/Gilberto - sold millions of copies and won international praise, including a US Grammy for Album of the Year.\n\nMark Hollis\n\nLead singer of Talk Talk\n\nThe 1980s band achieved mainstream success with such hits as It\u2019s My Life and Such a Shame, but became increasingly insular and experimental over time. After releasing a solo album in 1998, Hollis removed himself from public view. Spandau Ballet\u2019s Gary Kemp said: \u201cHis influence upon music was immense and far-reaching. A great presence in the modern era who took his bow far too early but has left us so much still to be moved by.\u201d\n\nKeith Flint\n\nProdigy singer\n\nRecognisable by his fluorescent spiked hair and known for high-octane performances, Flint sang lead vocals on both the band\u2019s number one singles - Breathe and Firestarter. In 1996, Flint told the BBC the Firestarter lyrics, \u201cI\u2019m the firestarter/Twisted firestarter\u201d, were not about starting fires. \u201cIt was when you\u2019re in front of 5,000 people and you can go out there - and just with the aid of the music and a visual performance, you can stir all them people up into a frenzy and that\u2019s almost like starting a massive fire, or a riot,\u201d he said.\n\nBarrie Masters\n\nEddie and the Hot Rods singer\n\nThe band were best known for their top 10 hit in 1977, Do Anything You Wanna Do. Formed in Canvey Island, Essex in 1975, they were part of the pub rock scene which included Dr Feelgood and Ian Dury\u2019s band Kilburn and the High Roads.

She had more than five million followers on Instagram. She came to be known for speaking out on mental health issues, cyber-bullying and women\u2019s rights - issues that remain sensitive in conservative South Korean society.\n\nPeter Tork\n\nOne of the Monkees\n\nTork was one of the four Monkees (pictured second from right) - a made-for-TV 1960s pop group and marketed as the American answer to The Beatles. He played keyboard and bass for the group, which had a string of hits including I\u2019m A Believer, Daydream Believer and Last Train to Clarksville.\n\nNeil Innes\n\nMonty Python songwriter\n\nThe writer, comedian and musician was dubbed \u201cThe Seventh Python\u201d. Python founding member Sir Michael Palin described him as \u201cthe most lovely friend\u201d, while John Cleese called him \u201ca very sweet man, much too nice for his own good\u201d. Innes also performed in The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band - later renamed The Bonzo Dog Band - who had a hit in 1968 with I'm the Urban Spaceman. After his work with Monty Python, Innes joined fellow Python Eric Idle on a new series, Rutland Weekend Television, which gave birth to their spoof band The Rutles - a pastiche of The Beatles.\n\nDick Dale\n\n\u2018King of Surf Rock\u2019\n\nHis song Misirlou played over the opening credits to Quentin Tarantino\u2019s film Pulp Fiction. Dale was known for his blindingly-fast strumming style, which inspired acts like The Beach Boys and Jimi Hendrix. He said the sound reminded him of the rumble and crash of the waves, and the noises of marine animals, as he surfed in California.\n\nLes Reed\n\nDelilah songwriter\n\nReed (pictured right) co-wrote Tom Jones hits Delilah and It\u2019s Not Unusual, as well as The Last Waltz by Engelbert Humperdinck (pictured left). He also served as a pianist in The John Barry Seven and conducted his own orchestra for more than 10 years.\n\nMichel Legrand\n\nWindmills of Your Mind composer and jazz pianist\n\nHe wrote more than 200 film and TV scores, as well as songs. In 1968, he won his first Oscar for the song The Windmills of Your Mind from The Thomas Crown Affair. Two more best original score Oscars followed in 1971, for the movie Summer of \u201942 and in 1983 for Yentl.\n\nKarel Gott\n\n\u2018Sinatra of the East\u2019\n\nGott was a Czech singer who sold millions of records.

Man Utd have had the most success with 13 titles in the 31 seasons so far.\n\nMan City have the Premier League record for the biggest winning margin, when they finished 19 points ahead of second-placed Manchester United in 2017/18.\n\nThe narrowest winning margin of +8 goal difference came in 2011/12 when Sergio Aguero's goal, deep into stoppage time on the final day of the season, gave Man City the title in the most dramatic of Premier League finishes.\n\nArsene Wenger's Arsenal are the only side to have gone the entire Premier League campaign unbeaten. That record season was achieved in 2003/04, when they won the title by 11 points from Chelsea.
