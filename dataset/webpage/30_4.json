At that point the likes of Blackpool, Motherwell, Partick Thistle and St Mirren were vying for his signature, but the 19-year-old's mother was so impressed by the honest approach of the Aberdeen manager David Halliday that the boy heeded her advice to head north-east from his Lanarkshire home to enlist with the Dons.\n\nBaird, who had starred for Strathclyde Juniors alongside the future Rangers luminary Willie Waddell, was an intelligent fellow who nursed ambitions to be an architect, but his football skills had proved impossible to ignore and now he planned to train in the mornings and study for his future career in the afternoons. However, he made a slow start at Pittodrie, struggling for an impact in this new competitive environment, and he was still featuring for the reserves when war broke out in 1939.\n\nNow, all too soon, the youngster who had viewed joining the Dons as a great adventure was to find himself caught up in an expedition of an altogether more daunting nature, one on which failure surely must have carried fatal consequences.\n\nWhile serving in the medical corps for the ill-fated British Expeditionary Force, he missed the evacuation at Dunkirk but managed to board the last ship out of St Nazaire when France fell in summer 1940. Awaiting his return to the war, Baird was stationed at Headingley, Yorkshire's cricket headquarters, and while he was there he guested for Leeds United, facing top performers of the day such as the Everton trio Tommy Lawton, Joe Mercer and Cliff Britton.\n\nThe respite was brief, though, and he was dispatched to North Africa, where he was part of the force which confronted Rommel in the Western Desert. When Tobruk was taken in the summer of 1942, his field ambulance was surrounded by German tanks and he was captured and handed over to the Italians, who placed him in a prisoner-of-war camp near Rimini on the Adriatic coast.\n\nMany of his fellow detainees died in what he described later as \"a filthy hell-hole\" but Baird, who whiled away some of his time by day-dreaming about his life as a footballer, remained resilient and in 1943, after 18 months of incarceration, he and a comrade, Harold Smith, managed to escape. Knowing that the Allies had landed in Italy, and aiming to join them, the pair headed south into the lower reaches of the Appenines. They lived off the land, helped on their way by sympathetic Italian farmers, and when severe winter weather set in Baird was sheltered for some months by a compassionate family, the Pilottis, who found other safe billetts for Smith and another fugitive who had joined the pair on their trek towards freedom.\n\nWith his sharp and lively mind, Baird picked up Italian quickly, enabling him to pose convincingly as the son of his courageous benefactors, to whom he became devoted and with whom he embarked on a lifelong friendship. \"They were real heroes,\" he said years later. \"They looked after me despite knowing the Germans would have shot them if they had found out.\"\n\nEventually, as Hitler's forces pulled out of Italy, Baird rejoined the Allied ranks and returned to Britain, guesting as a footballer for Aldershot and non-League Falmouth before returning to Aberdeen following his demob in September 1945. Vastly matured by his recent experiences, he was now a far more confident character than the tentative youth he had been during his initial Pittodrie sojourn, and he became established rapidly in the Dons' first team.\n\nOperating as an incisive prompter alongside his close pal and fellow inside-forward George Hamilton and the diminutive spearhead Stan Williams, Baird proved hugely influential as Aberdeen won the Southern League Cup, an emergency wartime competition and the precursor to the soon-to-be-launched Scottish League Cup. They beat Rangers 3-2 in a see-sawing final in front of 135,000 fans at Hampden Park in May 1946 to claim the first big prize since the club's formation in 1903.\n\nThere was reward on a wider front, too, with an appearance for Scotland in the Victory international against Belgium that January, the game finishing 2-2. Because it was classed as an unofficial wartime encounter, no cap was awarded, and that proved to be his sole outing for his country. He was immensely unfortunate because he had excelled against the Belgians, keeping his feet deftly in thick snow on a foggy Hampden afternoon, and had been selected for the next fixture, against England, only to be forced out through injury.\n\nA season later Baird was prominent again as the Dons beat highly-fancied Hibernian 2-1 to win the Scottish Cup, thus securing their first senior trophy and emphasising the progress they had made in finishing third in that term's title race behind Rangers and Hibs. They reached the inaugural League Cup final, too, losing 4-0 to Rangers, and faced the future on a tide of optimism.\n\nBaird, with his clever passing, neat ball skill and happy knack of contributing important goals, was seen as a major plank of Halliday's entertaining side, but he was hampered cruelly by knee problems which demanded three operations, and also he suffered a fractured leg. His best extended run was in 1950-51, when he scored 10 times in 40 league and cup appearances, but after barely figuring in 1952-53, the 34-year-old \u2013 whose overall record of 37 goals in 144 games for Aberdeen would have been far more extensive had he been blessed with fitness on a consistent basis \u2013 accepted a transfer to second-tier St Johnstone.\n\nAt McDiarmid Park Baird enjoyed a fruitful Indian summer, moving back to wing-half and missing only a handful of matches as the Saints twice finished in upper mid-table, then narrowly missed promotion to the top flight in 1955-56, his last campaign.\n\nAfter leaving the game, Baird \u2013 who until his death was believed to be Aberdeen's oldest surviving player \u2013 embarked on a fulfilling and packed life as a sports writer for the Scottish Sunday Express and a PE teacher who rose to become assistant head of Hilton Academy in Aberdeen by the time he retired in 1979. Somehow he even chiselled out the necessary time from his crowded schedule to qualify as a glider pilot.\n\nBaird believed passionately in education, achieving degrees in English and Italian through the University of London by correspondence course in the 1960s then teaching his second language at evening class. A warm, gregarious and charming man who had come to love all things Italian, he moved to Italy for a year from 1980, along with his wife Nancy, to teach English there.\n\nHis attachment to journalism was equally deep \u2013 many of his family members were practitioners, including his brother-in-law Magnus Magnusson and Magnusson's daughter Sally \u2013 and he became a popular columnist on the Aberdeen-based monthly magazine Leopard.\n\nArchie Baird was an author, too, penning a moving autobiography, Family Of Four (1989). It was a book in which his love of football was abundantly evident, but which illustrated eloquently his appreciation of its rightful place when he came to consider the more profound values of life.\n\nIvan Ponting\n\nArchibald MacKechnie Baird, footballer, journalist and teacher; born Rutherglen, Lanarkshire 8 May 1919; played for Aberdeen 1938-53, St Johnstone 1953-56; marriedn (one son, one daughter); died Cove, Aberdeen 3 November 2009."}, {"url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/rutherglen-born-aberdeen-fc-hero-2601789", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nGet the latest top news stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter\n\nTRIBUTES have been paid to Aberdeen Football Club hero Archie Baird, who died recently.\n\nArchie, from Rutherglen, born on May 8 1919, passed away on November 3, when he died in his sleep.\n\nAs well as helping the Dons to their first-ever Scottish Cup win in 1947, the inside-forward and wing-half also played for St Johnstone, and picked up one international cap for Scotland.\n\nBelieved to have been the oldest surviving Aberdeen player, Archie signed for the Pittodrie club from Strathclyde Juniors before the Second World War, but the war started before he had made the first team.\n\nSpeaking to the Aberdeen website earlier this year, he said: \u201cI had always admired the Dons and their style and moving to Aberdeen was a clean break It all happened so quickly; six months after starting as a junior I was away to Aberdeen and earning \u00a34 per week with a \u00a320 signing on fee.\u201d\n\nHe joined the British Army, but was captured and held as a prisoner of war. He escaped and lived with an Italian family as their \"son\".\n\nIn 1989 he published an autobiography, Family of Four, which described these experiences. In 2001, he was presented with a medal and diploma for his service to Italian language and culture in Scotland.\n\nBaird returned to Aberdeen before the end of the war. His good form in this period earned him selection for Scotland in a friendly match against Belgium in January 1946. The match ended in a 2-2 draw.\n\nArchie was one of nine Scotland players making their international debut in the match, and five of them did not make another international appearance, including the Rutherglen man.\n\nHe said: \u201cThat game should never have been played as the ground was covered in snow. The game ended in a 2-2 draw but the thick fog made conditions all the more difficult.\u201d\n\nBaird helped Aberdeen win the Southern League Cup - a forerunner of the Scottish League Cup - in 1946 and the 1947 Scottish Cup.\n\nArchie recalled: \u201cIt was an amazing experience and after we lost a goal in the opening minute we came back to win with Stan Williams scoring the winner. I took up a position at the near post as Stan cut in from the bye-line.\n\n\u201cI was shouting at Stan to cut the ball back, but he flicked the ball in at the near post for a great goal.\u201d\n\nBut his appearances at Pittodrie were restricted by injuries. In all he made 104 league appearances for Aberdeen, scoring 26 goals.\n\nHe was transferred in 1953 to St. Johnstone, where he played for three seasons before retiring in 1956.\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Archie worked as a teacher and a sports journalist.\n\nAn Aberdeen FC spokesman said: \u201cA tall inside forward, Baird was a master in the air and arguably one of the finest inside forwards to grace Pittodrie.\u201d\n\nArchie celebrated his 90th birthday in May this year.

With a few days notice, Baird will offer free tours of his Heritage of Golf museum right next to Gullane's pro shop. Here, Baird shows off his extensive collection of artwork, memorabilia and equipment, including some bizarre old clubs.\n\n\"I especially enjoy showing Americans this one,\" he says with a grin. It's an old, hickory iron designed by an American that has a wooden face attached to the iron head. \"They thought that it was the wood that made the ball go far, so they put wood over the face of the iron, bless them.\"\n\nThe tour starts at the beginning of golf history, dating back into the 1300s. Though the game's origins are debated by many, Baird has plenty of proof the game was played by the Dutch on ice, including paintings of men playing to a stick on ice, as well as some young Dutch children in formal portraits holding ancient tools, resembling the game's first clubs.\n\nIn a painting from 1668, you'll notice Dutch men now joined by men in kilts. Those are Scots, who would sell wool to the Dutch in the winter and would sometimes stay for days or months if the weather was unfavorable to return home.\n\nBaird especially enjoys talking about the golf ball, which went from an expensive, feather-core ball to a cheaper, more mass-produced ball made of a black, gum-like Gutta-Percha, just after 1850. This allowed the number of golf clubs in the world to go from just a handful to thousands by 1900.\n\nThe tour ends rather abruptly, as Baird notes:\n\n\"Then the modern, rubber-core ball came along in the 1920s, courses had to adapt to it, and I lost interest. Any questions?\"\n\nThat's not entirely true. Baird still plays the game regularly, often at Gullane, especially enjoying the shorter Gullane No. 3 course, designed by Harry Colt in 1910.\n\nFor more information, see www.heritageofgolf.org."}, {"url": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/default_content/12608718.archie-baird-footballer/", "page_content": "No sooner had he signed for Aberdeen FC in 1938 than he became part of the generation that was to lose the prime of its football years to the\n\nSecond World War. Nevertheless, he carved out a remark\u00adable career in which he became a kind of Boys\u2019 Own figure, particularly in Aberdeen and the north-east.\n\nLife had begun in Rutherglen in the immediate aftermath of the First World War. With his father a school janitor and local councillor, Baird went from Rutherglen Academy to become an apprentice architect in Glasgow.\n\nBut football dominated his young life, as he joined first Glencairn and then Strathclyde Juniors. There he teamed up with another youngster destined for the heights of Scottish football, by the name of Willie Waddell. As the latter\n\nheaded off to Rangers, Baird was catching the train to Aberdeen, where coincidence played its hand. Having just left one Willie Waddell, he arrived on the same day as another Willie Waddell, who had come to join the Dons from Renfrew Juniors.\n\nThe two shared digs, little knowing that they would play their part in Aberdeen\u2019s first taste of success in years to come. Before that, however, there would be the matter of the Second World War. Baird was off to a dramatic adventure, teaming up with the field ambulance of General Montgomery\u2019s 8th Army as it battled through the ferocity of the North African campaign.\n\nAt the battle of Tobruk, he was captured by the Germans and sent to Italy. But with a characteristic body-swerve, he made a daring escape and found refuge with an Italian peasant family for whom he ploughed, sowed grain and made wine. They, in turn, managed to hide him from the Germans and the friendship lasted for the rest of their lives. He tried to break back to the British lines but eventually had to wait until his own troops arrived.\n\nAfter that escapade, about which he wrote a splendid book, the rigours of Scottish football held few terrors for Baird, who continued to breach enemy lines and elude tight situations when he returned to play for Aberdeen. He was soon playing\n\nfor Scotland against Belgium and was chosen for the Victory International of 1946, though he had to withdraw through injury.\n\nA prominent Scottish sports-writer forecast that Gordon Smith of Hibs and Baird would turn out to be the best right-wing partnership Scotland had ever seen. But cartilage trouble, extending to a broken leg, broken jaw, broken nose and a variety of broken ribs interfered with a career which Baird\n\nstill maintained he thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nHe was home in time for Aberdeen Football Club to win its first-ever trophy, the Scottish League Cup of 1946, when he scored the opening goal in the 3-2 defeat of Rangers. That match was played on May 11 \u2013 surely a good omen for the club\u2019s greatest moment to come. For it was on May 11, 1983, that the Dons won the European Cup-Winners\u2019 Cup in Gothenburg, beating Real Madrid, the greatest club side in the world.\n\nWhen the Dons won the Scottish Cup for the first time in 1947, beating Hibernian 2-1, his friend Willie Waddell was there to share that moment of glory. At 27, Baird had resumed his football life, making the most of what was left of it.\n\nWith football careers cut short by war, there had to be other ways of making a living. Baird had continued his architectural training in Aberdeen but later switched to become a gym teacher. Then he extended that to an honours degree in Italian when he was 50 \u2013 and ended up as assistant headmaster of Hilton Academy. He was a thoroughly rounded man of intelligence and charm.\n\nBaird remained active and alert for most of his days and welcomed visitors to his 90th birthday this year, including his former team-mate Alex Kiddie and current director of football at Pittodrie, Willie Miller. He had been invited to perform an unveiling ceremony at Pittodrie next Wednesday, when the Aberdeen FC Heritage Trust will honour the eight players and staff who lost their lives in the First World War. In the end, however, he had to withdraw from the engagement.\n\nBut Archie Baird will remain one of the all-time heroes of Pittodrie, a man of stature, good humour and an example to up-and-coming footballers. He is survived by his wife Nancy, son Ian and daughter Anne. Also his twin sisters Anna and Mamie, the latter being former journalist Mamie Baird, who became the wife of the late Magnus Magnusson"}, {"url": "https://www.electricscotland.com/history/world/ambaird.htm", "page_content": "Scots around the world\n\nArchie Markland Baird ARCHIE MARKLAND BAIRD. One of the additions to the manufacturing interests of Topeka, Archie Markland Baird has for many years boon known in railroad circles of the state, and has been connected with numerous movements national in their character. His present business is the manufacture of pneumatic labor-saving devices. His knowledge of the business, his wide connections, and his executive capacity have brought his enterprise to a foremost and commanding position.\n\n\n\nMr. Baird was born at Kilmarnock, near Glasgow, Scotland, in 1857, and is a son of William and Janet\n\n(Markland) Baird, and a grandson of Archibald Baird, also a native of that place. Archibald Baird had a\n\nfamily of twelve sons and one daughter, all of whom grew to maturity, and it is a remarkable fact that all\n\nof these sons learned the blacksmith trade from their father, and some of them later came to the United States and became officials in the mechanical departments of several railroads. The children of Archibald Baird were: Andrew I., David, John, William, Thomas, Hugh, James, Elisha, Robert, Adam, Joseph and Andrew II, and one daughter, Jean. Of these, Andrew I died in young manhood; David came to America in 1857, took employment with the New York & New Haven Railroad at Hartford, Connecticut, and was foreman of the blacksmith shops for forty-five years; John was employed by the same railroad company; Thomas remained in Scotland and became a prominent manufacturer of cotton spindles; and Andrew II became general foreman of the Illinois Central Railroad shops and served that company for forty-five years.\n\n\n\nWilliam Baird, the father of Archie M. Baird, was born in 1810, and when a young man married Janet\n\nMarkland, of Stewarton, near Kilmarnock, Scotland. They had five children born to them: Janey, Belle,\n\nSarah, Jessie and Archie, of whom the two latter survive, Jessie now being the wife of James Thompson, who was for thirty years master mechanic of the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad.\n\n\n\nArchie Baird was eight years old when brought to the United States, the family settling at Chicago, Illinois, where the youth attended school until he was fourteen. He was more interested in mechanical things than in learning facts from books, and his father, recognizing this fact, apprenticed him to become a patternmaker, but a little later the youth decided to become a boilermaker and sheet iron worker and followed that trade for about six years. He was then offered a position at the Green Point Navy Yard, but a little later was called to Vincennes, Indiana, by the Ohio & Mississippi Railroad, and, although but nineteen years old, accepted a big contract to reconstruct the boiler equipment of the road so as to be suitable for a standard gauge road. This line, having been reduced from a broad gauge of 60 inches to the standard gauge of 56 1/2 inches, began operations under the new conditions after a period of six months. Mr. Baird states that on one Sabbath day 480 miles of the road was changed in this way.\n\n\n\nImmediately after the completion of this contract, Mr. Baird was called to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, by the Burlington, Cedar Rapids & Northern Railroad to take charge of the new and expensive boiler shops of\n\nthe company, and held this position for four years. In 1882 Mr. Baird went to the Wabash Railroad to\n\ntake charge of the office of superintendent of the boiler shops, and after holding this post for two years was offered and accepted the position of assistant to J. W. Williams, who had been made superintendent of the Union Iron and Steel Mills, at Chicago. This large plant was equipped for wire, plate, rails, merchant bars, and a full line of blast furnaces in which ore was melted and never reheated until it came out as railroad steel. This is what is known as direct process. There was also the very latest machinery which disposed of the hand hook process, all being handled by hydraulics and live rollers. Mr. Baird and his superior were two years in building this wonderful mill. In 1886 Mr. Baird was called to the shops of the Wisconsin Central & Northern Pacific, at Waukesha, Wisconsin, where he held the position of general foreman boilermaker for four years, and then, in 1890, was called to Topeka by John Player, who was superintendent of motive power of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad, and became general foreman of the shop. This position he held during a period of sixteen years. In 1906 he began to handle pneumatic hydraulic static devices, and in 1909 was sent by the company to Cotesville, Pennsylvania, to superintend the building of the new patented firebox, known as the Jacob\n\nShupert box. He built 200 of these appliances and spent three months in testing and comparing them with the standard firebox. There were a number of university professors who assisted in the testing, and\n\nthe box was finally accepted. Returning to Topeka, Mr. Baird took the position of safety boiler inspector of the whole Santa Fe system, instructing the different shop foremen so that these men would be able to fill the requirements of the new Federal laws. He then returned to his old position as general foreman\n\nboilermaker of the Santa Fe system, with headquarters at Topeka, and a little later was made assistant superintendent of the locomotive shops at Topeka, a capacity in which he acted until 1915. In that year he embarked in the manufacture of a full line of pneumatic labor-saving devices, and the business has grown to such an extent that its products now fill a fifty-page catalogue.\n\n\n\nMr. Baird was united in marriage, in 1877, with Miss Mary J. Lyons, of Chicago, Illinois, a daughter of\n\nPatrick Lyons of that city. Of the seven children born to them, the following are living: Mamie, who is the wife of I. S. Sheets, who is identified with the clerical department of the shops of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad, at Topeka; Sadie, who is the wife of Fred J. Partridge, who is an an[sic] employe of the state in the office of Hon. Tom Bodkin, secretary of state of Kansas; and Mildred, a stenographer in the office of State Labor Commissioner McBride, and living at home with her parents. Mamie is a graduate of Saint Xavier College, Chicago; and Mildred and Sadie are graduates of Saint Mary's Academy, at Leavenworth, Kansas.\n\n\n\nMr. Baird has taken no active part in public affairs, but like all good business men has accepted his share of the responsibilities of citizenship and is always eager to assist in the advancement of movements making for the general welfare, for the advancement of education or for the betterment of civic conditions. He is a thirty-second degree Mason and a Knight Templar and Shriner and has filled most of the chairs, and is also a member of organizations of railroad men. His family belongs to the Catholic Church, while Mr. Baird favors Presbyterian doctrines."}, {"url": "https://www.nationalclubgolfer.com/news/archie-baird-gullane-golf-museum-dies/", "page_content": "No trip to Gullane is complete without a visit to the Heritage of Golf Museum.

At first glance it might seem an extension of the club\u2019s modest pro shop, but no, it\u2019s something apart\u2014centuries apart.\n\nIt is the Heritage of Golf Museum, and if that title is a bit ambitious for the one-room collection of golfiana that comprises it, its founder and proprietor may be forgiven, for he has donated generously of his time and possessions to make it what it is.\n\nArchie Baird is a former RAF fighter pilot and veterinary surgeon whose interest in golf collecting began more than half a century ago when he acquired his most prized possession, his wife Sheila, who happened to be not only a medical doctor but the great-granddaughter of Willie Park Sr., the first British Open Champion, at Prestwick back in 1860.\n\nThe couple inherited a small flat in Edinburgh, and being on a tight budget, they furnished their home by scouting for bargains at second-hand shops and auction sales. On one such expedition, Archie came upon an old canvas bag of hickory clubs. Rubbing the dust off one of the long-nosed woods, he discovered it was stamped with the name Park. A family heirloom! He promptly bought it for the princely sum of five shillings (less than a dollar).\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what got me going,\u201d he says. \u201cIn those days, such clubs could be found all over Edinburgh, so I started collecting them\u2014hundreds of them\u2014and not just Parks, but Philps, Forgans, all the top makers. Eventually I filled my wine cellar with them.\u201d In those days also, Archie was known to do a bit of veterinary \u201ctrading,\u201d treating the odd dog or cat for free in exchange for clubs that had caught his eye.\n\nIn the process, he became curious about the game\u2019s beginnings, and so began collecting golf books, which led to memorabilia, medals, trinkets, and ultimately to his keenest interest, artwork. Today, Baird has the most valuable private collection of golf art in the world.\n\nIn 1980, he decided to share some of his treasures. With fellow collector Ben Crenshaw (in town for the Open Championship at Muirfield) cutting the ribbon, the Heritage of Golf Museum opened.\n\nA sturdy terrier of a man, often clad in plus-fours of tweed or tartan, he is still an active golfer at the age of 88 (a member of both Gullane and Muirfield), and continues to give free tours to those who make an advance booking (phone the Heritage of Golf Museum direct from the U.S.\u2014011 441 875 870 277).\n\nHis 20-minute presentation is as entertaining as it is informative, and traces golf\u2019s birth back to the 1300s. Rather generously for a Scot, he cites the Dutch as inventors of the game: \u201cThey were ahead of the Scots, but they couldn\u2019t make decent clubs\u2014they didn\u2019t need to because they played on iced-over canals, so everyone hit the ball a long way.\n\n\u201cNonetheless,\u201d he adds, \u201cit was the Scottish craftsmen, with their fine woods of beech and ash, who made the first great golf clubs, and it was the Scots who spread the game.\u201d\n\nThis is an interactive tour and visitors are encouraged to heft and inspect the artifacts as Archie delivers a series of well-honed one-liners. Offering a few of his precious featheries to the assembled group, he says, \u201cThis is the only museum in the world where you\u2019re allowed to handle the curator\u2019s balls.\u201d\n\nGolf\u2019s heritage, by Baird\u2019s reckoning, petered out in the 1930s with the advent of steel shafts. \u201cAfter that,\u201d he says, \u201cI lost interest,\u201d and with that pronouncement his tour ends.\n\nAsked to point out his most prized possession, Archie smiles slyly. \u201cAll my good stuff is at home.\u201d One can only imagine what treasures grace the walls, cabinets, and bookcases of the Baird residence. Happily, however, Archie\u2019s castoffs are rare gems to the rest of us."}, {"url": "https://www.golfheritage.org/archie-baird-scotlands-ambassador-for-golf-dies-at-95/", "page_content": "Archie Baird, beloved ambassador for golf who lived in Gullane, Scotland, died Sunday, Dec. 7, 2019. He was 95. He passed away very peacefully at Edington Cottage Hospital in North Berwick.\n\nMr. Baird, a former RAF fighter pilot and veterinary surgeon, is survived by his wife, Sheila, a medical doctor and great-grandaughter of the legendary Willie Park Sr., first winner of the Open Championship, Prestwick in 1860. The couple had four great-grandchildren.\n\nEarly in their marriage the couple shared a small flat in Edinburgh. Their tight budget forced the couple to search second-hand shops and auctions for furnishings. It was during one such excursion that Mr. Baird came upon a dusty bag of hickory shafted clubs. One of the log-nosed woods bore the name of Park. Excited by the find of a club connected to a family member, he bought the club for five shillings (less than a dollar), and thus began a lifelong love of golf collecting.\n\nMr. Baird began to scour shops throughout England and eventually amassed an enormous number of especially prized ancient clubs before turning his eye to other golf collectibles such as books, medals, and other odds and ends. His keenest interest turned out to be artwork.\n\nHis home was a gallery of landscapes, golfing scenes, portraits, sketches, prints, and caricatures. The artist names were a who\u2019s who of the genre \u2013 Major Francis Powell Hopkins, W.D. McKay, John Smart, J. Michael Brown, John Hassell, \u201cGeorge Pipeshank,\u201d John Barclay, Lawson Wood, Harry Rountree, and William S. Nicholson. One of the oldest pieces was a tempura painting from the 1850s of the Bruntsfield links. He had also acquired a portrait of W. Goddard. Esq. painted by Charles Lees, RSA as a study for his later masterpiece \u201cA Grand Match Played Over St. Andrews Links.\u201d\n\nArchie Baird in an early 1980s photo of the Golf Heritage Museum.\n\nIn 1980 wishing to share some of these treasures, and with fellow collector Ben Crenshaw cutting the ribbon, Mr. Baird opened the Heritage of Golf Museum nearly adjacent to the 18th green of the Gullane No. 1 golf course in Aberlady. Thousands of visitors have come through the museum these past 40 years. Mr. Baird charged not a penny, rather wanting visitors to come away with a deeper appreciation of the game\u2019s rich history. He delighted in giving those tours, all delivered in a concise, entertaining style punctuated with dry humor and memorable one-liners. In an interview with Links Magazine he spoke of the Dutch as inventors of the game:\n\n\u201cThey were ahead of the Scots, but they couldn\u2019t make decent clubs\u2014they didn\u2019t need to because they played on iced-over canals, so everyone hit the ball a long way. Nonetheless it was the Scottish craftsmen, with their fine woods of beech and ash, who made the first great golf clubs, and it was the Scots who spread the game.\u201d\n\nHe would often appear at golf functions wearing an original red golf play coat, c. early 1800s, worn by members of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, a coat he was said to have found at a Boy Scout rummage sale.\n\nMr. Baird was the author of Golf on Gullane Hill, published in 1982, which recounts 350 years of golf on Gullane links. He was a member of Muirfield Golf Club and assisted in the development of exhibits that display the club\u2019s rich history. He also donated the pocket watch that Old Tom Morris gave his son, Tommy, after he won his first Open Championship, to the St Andrews Golf Club, whose clubhouse faces the 18th fairway of the St Andrews Old Course. A small plaque commemorates the gift.\n\nAmong many other memberships and honors, Mr. Baird was a founding member of the British Golf Collectors Society, latterly an Honorary Life member and an original committee member. He won the BGCS\u2019s Murdoch Medal in 2000 and in June 2018 was honored with the British Empire Medal, both in recognition for services to the history of golf. The BEM was bestowed as part of the Queen\u2019s Birthday Honours, which annually recognizes individuals for a variety of services to the Crown.\n\nHe was a past Captain of Gullane Golf Club, and an honorary member the Society of Hickory Golfers, the latter a modest honor, but a testimony to the esteem in which he was held by those around the world who value golf\u2019s traditions.\n\nMr. Baird will long be remembered for his kindness, his keen appreciation for golf\u2019s heritage and his expertise in sharing that knowledge.\n\nAdditional information will be added here as it becomes available."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51559632", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Scotland\n\nAlan Hutton left Rangers to join Tottenham Hotspur in a \u00a39m move in 2008\n\nFormer Rangers, Aston Villa and Scotland defender Alan Hutton has retired aged 35.\n\nThe right-back has been without a club since leaving Villa last summer.\n\nHutton won 50 Scotland caps and also turned out for Tottenham Hotspur, having starting his career at Ibrox, where he played more than 100 games.\n\nAfter announcing his decision to retire live on TalkSport radio, he said he is undecided over his next move but \"I don't fancy coaching if I'm honest\".\n\n\"I'm going to take my time deciding,\" he said. \"I'm enjoying the family side of things, even if it does mean I'm a taxi service.\"\n\nHutton told BBC Scotland in September he had turned down offers from English Championship clubs and felt capable of playing \"for a few more years\".\n\nBut the 'Scottish Cafu' has now called time on a 17-year playing career that began with Rangers in 2002.
