They were well known for their songs \"Easy Come, Easy Go\", \"Headed For A Heartbreak\", \"Madalaine\", \"Miles Away\" and \"Seventeen\"."}, {"url": "https://rockandrollglobe.com/rock/it-all-comes-back-around-the-return-of-winger/", "page_content": "An exclusive chat with Kip Winger about the band\u2019s new album Seven and more\n\nOn May 5, hard rockers Winger released Seven, their \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 seventh studio album.\n\nThe band members haven\u2019t put out anything together since 2014\u2019s Better Days Comin\u2019, and frontman Kip Winger admits that he was bit nervous as this latest release date approached. \u201cOh God, it\u2019s always so stressful \u2013 it\u2019s just like the first time I put out an album. It\u2019s always high stakes. You wonder what people think,\u201d he says.\n\nThe long gap between albums happened because Winger himself has been pursuing an acclaimed career in classical music, while guitarist Reb Beach has spent time playing with Whitesnake. The pandemic also caused significant delays.\n\nNow that Seven is finally out, Winger can finally breathe.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy with the way it sounds and the content of the record, and I\u2019m proud of the fact that there\u2019s no filler,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s right in the zone of where I want it to be, somewhere between our first record [1988\u2019s Winger], which had a certain thing to it, and our [1993] third record, Pull, which was a huge album for us, and really was the beginning of the sound of the band, in my mind. This record is really a great cross collateralization of all the stuff that we\u2019ve done, wrapped up into one thing.\u201d\n\nThe band, which includes all four original members\u2013Winger on bass, guitarist Reb Beach, multi-instrumentalist Paul Taylor and drummer Rod Morgenstein\u2013plus longtime third guitarist John Roth, recorded the new album in Nashville, where Winger has lived for several years. This time, he produced it himself. \u201cWhen it comes to my own music, I\u2019m pretty confident about knowing where to finish [a song] \u2013 because I also know that after a point, diminishing returns doesn\u2019t help you much,\u201d he says.\n\nHe also felt confident about the material, even though it\u2019s been a long time since he recorded a rock album. \u201cI\u2019m replete with ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cA long time ago, I would get stumped for ideas and have nowhere to go. It wasn\u2019t until I really started studying and learning other things and stepping out of my comfort zone that I really started flourishing in the musical idea department.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s referring to his years studying classical composition at the University of New Mexico, starting in 1997. By that time, \u201cI had already had a full career in music, so I took what I had known already and applied these new things to what I already did, and it created an incredibly fertile ground to work in.\u201d\n\nIn truth, though, Winger had begun studying music his entire life. \u201cMy parents were in a band. They put a guitar in my hand when I was five. I did my first professional gig at eight years old, and my two elder brothers and I played in a band [together] from the time I was five years old \u2019til the time I was 20 years old.\u201d That means, and sixty-one years old, he\u2019s been a working musician for more than five decades.\n\nThough he started out as a guitarist, he switched to bass after becoming a fan of Beatles bassist Paul McCartney. \u201cAnd my brother grabbed the guitar, and my other brother grabbed the drums, so it was an obvious choice for me to play bass to round out the band,\u201d he says.\n\nFrustrated that the band with his brothers wasn\u2019t achieving significant success, Winger quit and moved from his native Colorado to New York City. His skills earned him a spot in shock rocker Alice Cooper\u2019s band, and he stayed on for two years. Though it was a good job, he left in 1987 (with Cooper\u2019s blessing) so he could form his own eponymous band.\n\n\u201cI felt at the time it was like, \u2018Once a side man, always a side man,\u2019 and I needed to make the break right then,\u201d Winger says. \u201cIn some ways it was really stupid. I gambled on myself and won, but I could have just as easily gambled and lost.\u201d\n\nVIDEO: Winger \u201cMadalaine\u201d\n\nForming the band definitely turned out to be the right call, as their first two albums, 1988\u2019s Winger and 1990\u2019s In the Heart of the Young, both earned platinum sales status. Several of their singles \u2013 including \u201cMadalaine,\u201d \u201cSeventeen,\u201d \u201cHeaded for a Heartbreak,\u201d \u201cMiles Away,\u201d and \u201cEasy Come Easy Go\u201d \u2013 were ubiquitous on radio and MTV. Although the grunge era caused the band to take a break during the 1990s, Winger says that they\u2019ve retained a loyal following because of their emotional connection to the music.\n\n\u201cNothing makes somebody feel something more than music,\u201d Winger says. \u201cThe only thing that you ever remember about anything is what it makes you feel like. If you go to the beach, you don\u2019t remember what it looks like as much as how it makes you feel. If you watch a movie, it\u2019s always about the lingering feeling. If you get in a fight with somebody, maybe you\u2019ll remember what they said, and it\u2019ll piss you off or make you cry or whatever it is \u2013 it\u2019s always about the emotion.\u201d\n\nIn the past, the band\u2019s willingness to tap into that emotion has sometimes earned them derision from other hard rock musicians. Metallica, in particular, took public swipes at Winger, leading some fans to follow suit.\n\n\u201cA lot of rock fans hated us and thought we were wimpy. We took a lot of shit,\u201d Winger says. \u201cBut I think in a lot of ways, our music actually does stand the test of time, and there\u2019s a lot more under the hood than what the general consensus of the pop world would think of \u2018Hey, he\u2019s just Mister \u2018Seventeen.\u2019 I mean, anybody that knows the difference knows that it\u2019s way deeper than all of that.\u201d\n\nThese days, he adds, \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot more respect. It\u2019s kind of come full circle. And the only reason that\u2019s happened is that I stayed the course and I just kept trying to become a better musician. I didn\u2019t pay attention to any of it, as much as I could. I just realized there was nothing I could do to change it. And so the things that you can\u2019t change, you can\u2019t dwell on them in a way that\u2019s going to ruin your life. You just have to focus on the things that you are in control of \u2013 and the only thing I was in control of was the music that I was writing. Nothing else.\u201d\n\nWinger was vindicated when, in 2017, he was nominated for a Grammy award in classical composition.\n\n\u201cOnce that happened, I never looked back,\u201d he says. \u201cThat basically set the record straight on whether I\u2019m a good musician or not. So anybody that wants to imagine that I don\u2019t know what music is, they can go ahead and just keep imagining that, but they\u2019re just completely out of touch with reality.\u201d\n\nFortunately, he knows there are many fans who\u2019ve defended the band, then and now \u2013 and soon, those loyal followers will get a chance to see Winger in person when the band embark on an extensive string of tour dates \u2013 some headlining, and others performing with Steel Panther or Tom Keifer Band.\n\nWinger himself promises fans that they\u2019ll have a blast at these shows: \u201cI can hit every note I\u2019ve ever been able to hit. People heard \u2018Seventeen\u2019 in high school and they\u2019re coming to hear that song and I don\u2019t want to let them down.\u201d In order to keep performing at this level, he says he\u2019s \u201cbig on health and working out, and working on my voice. I haven\u2019t had a drink since 2012.\u201d\n\nGiving back to the fans, with good gigs and new music, is Winger\u2019s way of showing gratitude.\n\n\u201cI appreciate everybody hanging in with us,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is our 35th anniversary year, so we\u2019re really happy we\u2019re still standing!\u201d"}, {"url": "https://xsrock.com/winger-where-are-they-now/", "page_content": "Winger released their debut album \u201cWinger in 1988 and it scored the band its first platinum-selling album.

Alice Cooper suggested that the band change their name to \u201cWinger\u201d from \u201cSahara\u201d, which is what the band was using n the early days. Winger found success with two platinum albums, but their third album \u201cPull\u201d didn\u2019t meet the sales of the albums before it and the band went in different directions pursuing solo careers for quite some time. Kip Winger married Beatrice Richter in 1991 but tragedy would strike in 1996 when she was killed in a car accident. Kip Winger released the following solo albums: This Conversation Seems Like a Dream (1997), Down Incognito (1999), Songs from the Ocean Floor (2001), From the Moon to the Sun (2008), Ghosts \u2013 Suite No. 1 (2010) and Conversations with Nijinsky (2016).

He would then go on to Whitesnake, where he still remains a member of the band as well as a member of Winger. Reb also has been in several so-called supergroups featuring all-star members from other well-known bands like The Mob and Black Swan. Reb Beach has also released several solo albums showcasing his guitar virtuoso skills with \u201cThe Fusion Demos\u201d, \u201cMasquerade\u201d, and \u201cA View From The Inside\u201d.\n\nhttp://www.rebbeach.com\n\nRod Morgenstein\n\nPrior to joining Winger, drummer and percussionist Rod Morgenstein played with The Dixie Dregs and Steve Morse\u2019s solo band.

Formed in New York City, Winger gained popularity during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The band's two platinum albums, Winger and In the Heart of the Young, along with charting singles \"Seventeen,\" \"Headed for a Heartbreak\" and \"Miles Away,\" put them on the top of the charts by the early 1990s. In 1990, the band was nominated for an American Music Award for \"Best New Heavy Metal Band.\" As the music scene changed in the early to mid-1990s due to the popularity of grunge, their success faded after their third release Pull.\n\nWinger disbanded in 1994. In 2001 they reunited and have since conducted several successful tours. In 2006, the band's 1993 touring line-up (minus Paul Taylor but including John Roth) reunited to record the band's first studio album in over 13 years, IV, and toured in support of the album into 2008.\n\nIn 2009, the band released their fifth album, Karma. As of 2013, Winger was performing on mini-tours, festivals and private events. Their most recent album, Better Days Comin', came out in 2014.\n\nHistory:\n\nMain career and break-up (1987\u20131994).\n\nThe debut album, Winger, was released on August 10, 1988 on Atlantic Records. The record was a success, achieving platinum status in the United States, and gold status in Japan and Canada. On February 11, 1989, the album peaked at number 21 on the Billboard 200, and was in various places on the chart for 63 weeks. Radio and MTV hits from the album included \"Madalaine\", \"Seventeen\", \"Headed for a Heartbreak\" and \"Hungry\". In 1990, the band was nominated for an American Music Award for \"Best New Heavy Metal Band\".\n\nShortly after that tour, Winger released its second album In the Heart of the Young, which went 1-and-1/2 platinum in the U.S. and gold in Japan. Hit radio tracks and MTV videos included \"Can't Get Enuff\", \"Miles Away\" and \"Easy Come Easy Go\".\n\nWinger followed the release of its second album with a 13-month world tour, playing over 230 dates with Kiss, Scorpions, ZZ Top, Extreme and Slaughter. Paul Taylor left the band after the tour, citing exhaustion after years of touring. Their third studio album, Pull, produced by Mike Shipley, was recorded in 1992/1993 as a three-piece band. It was originally to be called Blind Revolution Mad, after the opening song. Reportedly, Kip Winger, anticipating that critics would dismiss the album out of hand, renamed it Pull as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the CD being used by critics as a skeet-shooting target. The album was not as successful as the previous albums sales wise, but gained solid reviews. On the following tour, John Roth was called in to replace Paul Taylor on rhythm guitar. The album coincided with the rise of grunge, which swept aside the brand of melodic pop metal that Winger represented.\n\nIn the 1990s, Winger was subject to mockery from MTV's animated series Beavis and Butt-head. Series creator Mike Judge later revealed that he had been incorrectly informed that Kip Winger had asked the network not to make jokes about the band on the series, which led to further jokes about the band, but later learned from Winger himself that he had never made any such stipulation. \u201cStewart\u201d, an early character from the TV show, wore a Winger t-shirt during the shows original run on MTV during the early 90s.\n\nAfter disbanding in 1994, bassist/lead vocalist Kip Winger went on to a solo career, guitarist Reb Beach went on to touring projects with artists Dokken, Alice Cooper and has held a permanent guitar spot in Whitesnake since 2002. The band's other members pursued or resumed careers as session musicians.\n\nReunions (2001\u2013present)\n\nIn 2001, it was announced that all original members of the band would return to the studio to record the song \"On the Inside\" for The Very Best of Winger. In 2002, all five members embarked on a reunion tour of the U.S. and Canada on a bill with Poison. According to Kip Winger, in a 2008 interview with rock and roll comic C.C. Banana, it was important to include all five members because \"it was the big, long-awaited reunion so I wanted to include everybody who had ever been in the band.\" In 2003, it was confirmed that activity had been halted due to Reb Beach's touring commitment with Whitesnake as well as his solo album \"Masquerade\" and involvement with \"super-group\" project The Mob with King's X frontman Doug Pinnick and Night Ranger drummer Kelly Keagy.\n\nOn July 16, 2005, it was announced that Kip Winger would perform as the lead singer for the Alan Parsons Live Project at the Common Ground Music Festival in Lansing, Michigan. In May 2006, it was confirmed that Winger had reformed without one of its original members Paul Taylor, to record another album and tour Europe. The album, IV, was released in Europe in October and the nine-country \"Winger IV Tour\" ran in the last two weeks of the same month.\n\nOn February 25, 2008, the band performed in Providence, Rhode Island, as part of a benefit for survivors of the Station nightclub fire. The concert, along with other artists was debuted on VH1 Classic on March 23, 2008. In late 2009, it was confirmed that Winger would record a fifth album Karma, with a tour to support it. Most recently, John Roth became the guitarist for Giant and would appear on their forthcoming album Promise Land then set for release in February/March of 2010.\n\nWinger released their sixth studio album titled, Better Days Comin' in April 2014, after teasers were published on Kip Winger's website and on the official Winger Facebook page as well.\n\nAs of late 2018, Winger was playing club dates. They were scheduled on Dec 29, 2018 in Westland, Michigan.\n\nStyle and influences.\n\nThe band's musical style combines elements of glam metal and progressive metal. Kip Winger, in description of the band's musical ability and style, said, \"Our band was known to musicians, and a lot of musicians showed up to see me play \u2014 watching, trying to figure out how I'm playing. We were like the 'hair band' (version of) Dream Theater.\""}, {"url": "https://www.discogs.com/master/274746-Winger-Winger", "page_content": "juvat270 May 19, 2021 Report\n\nEdited 2 years ago\n\nI've bought a few Friday Music releases and while the physical quality of the albums has always been top notch, the sound quality always leaves something to be desired. The first Friday Music release I ever bought was Ratt's \"Out of the Cellar\". Even with not having, nor having ever heard an original pressing of said album at the time that I purchased it, it just didn't sound \"right\". It was somewhat flat and muddy sounding. This was confirmed when I eventually did get an original pressing of that record. Night and day difference. The original was loud and dynamic. Skid Row's debut was slightly better in the sound department, but still doesn't compare to an original. And that brings me to WInger's Debut. Call me an eternal optimist, but I keep thinking with each new Friday Music release its going to get better. Unfortunately Winger suffers from the same problem as the others, the sound. All the dynamics having been sucked out, it just sounds flat and lifeless. I've noticed that all these Friday releases are mastered by Joe Reagoso. Other than being the owner of Friday Music, he doesn't seem to be any one of any note as far as mastering engineers go. Certainly not in the same company as Kevin Gray and Robert Ludwig, et al. And a quick search on the internet seems to confirm this. So perhaps the blame should fall on him for the sub-par sound quality. Perhaps Mr. Reagoso's hearing isn't the greatest. Perhaps he just has no idea what hes doing when it comes to mastering. Or maybe he really does think these releases sound good to him. Whatever the reason, I just can't recommend any of these releases on sound quality alone.\n\n\n\nTL;DR....its not god-awful and if you can't find an original this release this should serve as a decent player copy. However, as tired and cliche as its become...an original first pressing blows this away in every regard."}, {"url": "https://www.highresaudio.com/en/album/view/dp64ov/winger-winger-remaster", "page_content": "Info for Winger (Remaster)\n\nRather unfairly Winger were lumped into the '80s hair metal scene. However, it was an easy mistake to make considering Kip Winger's drop dead gorgeous looks and the band's penchant for penning memorable and melodic rock of an altogether addictive nature. However, beneath the fancy looks was a band of enormous depth, containing members that had already notched up years of experience and played with several demanding and high caliber artists. Originally issued in 1988, and produced by man of the moment Beau Hill, the album caused an immediate stir with it's seductive blend of heavy, yet melodic, rock suggesting that Winger's talent was very much in the same realms as Bon Jovi and Foreigner. Indeed, such was the excitement surrounding the album that it achieved platinum status and made them a fixture on MTV, all helped by their good looks and fully formed songs such as 'Madalaine', 'Hungry', 'Headed for a Heartbreak' (a Top 20 US hit single) and the superhumanly catchy 'Seventeen' ; a tour de force of perfection.\n\n\u201eSince Winger was marketed largely on the looks of lead singer Kip Winger, and since their sleazy rockers and lovelorn ballads cover the same old pop-metal territory, the band's high-quality musicianship tended to get overlooked. Guitarist Reb Beach earned wide praise from other musicians, and he, ex-Dixie Dregs drummer Rod Morgenstein, and keyboardist Paul Taylor bring a distinct progressive metal influence to many of the tunes on Winger. Even if the lyrics are standard issue, the album is impeccably composed, crafted, and played, with melodies, riffs, and guitar solos taking off in unexpected directions and keeping the listener slightly off balance -- no easy task in the cookie-cutter hair metal genre. The only misstep is an overdone, tight-assed, totally misguided recasting of 'Purple Haze.' Otherwise, Winger is a surprisingly accomplished debut.\u201c (Steve Huey, AMG)\n\nKip Winger, vocals, bass, keyboards, string arrangements\n\nReb Beach, guitars, vocals\n\nPaul Taylor, keyboards, vocals\n\nRod Morgenstein, drums, vocals\n\nAdditional musicians:\n\nDweezil Zappa, left side guitar solo on 'Purple Haze'\n\nBeau Hill, vocals\n\nIra McLaughlin, vocals\n\nSandra Park, strings\n\nRebecca Young, strings\n\nHae Young Ham, strings\n\nMaria Kitsopoulos, strings\n\nRecorded 1988 at Atlantic Studios, New York City\n\nProduced by Beau Hill\n\nDigitally remastered\n\n"}], "Winger had several hit singles, including 'Seventeen' and 'Headed for a Heartbreak'.": [{"url": "https://genius.com/artists/Winger", "page_content": "About Winger\n\nWinger are an American heavy metal band that has combined elements of glam metal and progressive metal.

Kip Winger: Conversations With Nijinsky\", recorded with the San Francisco Ballet Orchestra."}, {"url": "https://ultimateclassicrock.com/winger-career-collapsed/", "page_content": "In 1993, Winger had every reason to believe their third album, Pull, was going to be a big hit. Guitarist Reb Beach was so confident that he \u201cbanked\u201d on the record going gold \u2013 and was forced into a large-scale U-turn when it didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe band's self-titled debut LP had introduced the group to the world via the hit singles \u201cHeaded for a Heartbreak\u201d and \u201cSeventeen,\u201d then the follow-up, In the Heart of the Young, continued the streak with \u201cCan't Get Enuff,\u201d \u201cEasy Come Easy Go\u201d and \u201cMiles Away.\u201d But by the time Pull was ready for release, the grunge revolution had changed everything.\n\nIn Tom Beaujour and Richard Bienstock\u2019s new book Nothin' but a Good Time: The Uncensored History of the '80s Hard Rock Explosion, Winger noted that their rise to fame had come thanks to MTV\u2019s support for their \u201cMadalaine\u201d video and an opening slot on tour with Scorpions. \u201cWe got some good touring out of our second record, but the writing was on the wall before it came out,\u201d frontman Kip Winger said. \u201cBad timing.\u201d\n\nKeyboardist and guitarist Paul Taylor added: \u201cWe were starting to notice, like, wow, where\u2019s everybody at the shows? \u2026 I remember it finally hit home in Cincinnati. We had a night off, and I went to see Extreme and Cinderella with David Lee Roth at the Riverbend [Music Center]. And it was half-full. \u2026 David Lee Roth was the ultimate rock star. And now the place is half-empty? I was like, \u2018Whoa. Something's up.\u2019 Because two years prior it would've been sold out.\u201d\n\nBeach agreed with Winger\u2019s \u201cbad timing\u201d analysis. \u201cIf we had come out in \u201986, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be a very rich man,\" he explained. \"But we came out in '89, right at the tail end. We didn't know it was gonna end. On the third album we were gonna get big publishing advances. If it had done well, I would've made a lot of money. And I banked on that. I figured, it's gotta do well! The last one sold a million and a half records. This one's gotta at least go gold.\u201d\n\nSo, he \"bought a new house and moved the whole fam to Florida. \u2018C\u2019mon, kids! We\u2019re moving to Florida!\u2019 I got a house on a lake with a pool, and you could jump from the pool right into the lake! It was incredible. I was only there for eight months before I had to sell that house. That's how quickly it all went south.\u201d\n\nThe band split in 1994, before reforming briefly in 2001 then more permanently in 2006. They\u2019ve released three more albums since Pull, the most recent being 2014\u2019s Better Days Comin\u2019."}, {"url": "https://www.last.fm/music/Winger/+wiki", "page_content": "Winger is an American rock band that has combined elements of glam metal and progressive metal. Formed in New York City, Winger gained popularity during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The band's two platinum albums, Winger and In the Heart of the Young, along with charting singles \"Seventeen,\" \"Headed for a Heartbreak\" and \"Miles Away,\" put them on the top of the charts by the early 1990s. In 1990, the band was nominated for an American Music Award for \"Best New Heavy Metal Band.\" As the music scene changed in the early to mid-1990s due to the popularity of grunge, their success faded after their third release Pull.\n\nWinger disbanded in 1994. In 2001 they reunited and have since conducted several successful tours. In 2006, the band's 1993 touring line-up (minus Paul Taylor but including John Roth) reunited to record the band's first studio album in over 13 years, IV, and toured in support of the album into 2008.\n\nIn 2009, the band released their fifth album, Karma. As of 2013, Winger was performing on mini-tours, festivals and private events. Their most recent album, Better Days Comin', came out in 2014.\n\nHistory:\n\nMain career and break-up (1987\u20131994).\n\nThe debut album, Winger, was released on August 10, 1988 on Atlantic Records. The record was a success, achieving platinum status in the United States, and gold status in Japan and Canada. On February 11, 1989, the album peaked at number 21 on the Billboard 200, and was in various places on the chart for 63 weeks. Radio and MTV hits from the album included \"Madalaine\", \"Seventeen\", \"Headed for a Heartbreak\" and \"Hungry\". In 1990, the band was nominated for an American Music Award for \"Best New Heavy Metal Band\".\n\nShortly after that tour, Winger released its second album In the Heart of the Young, which went 1-and-1/2 platinum in the U.S. and gold in Japan. Hit radio tracks and MTV videos included \"Can't Get Enuff\", \"Miles Away\" and \"Easy Come Easy Go\".\n\nWinger followed the release of its second album with a 13-month world tour, playing over 230 dates with Kiss, Scorpions, ZZ Top, Extreme and Slaughter. Paul Taylor left the band after the tour, citing exhaustion after years of touring. Their third studio album, Pull, produced by Mike Shipley, was recorded in 1992/1993 as a three-piece band. It was originally to be called Blind Revolution Mad, after the opening song. Reportedly, Kip Winger, anticipating that critics would dismiss the album out of hand, renamed it Pull as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the CD being used by critics as a skeet-shooting target. The album was not as successful as the previous albums sales wise, but gained solid reviews. On the following tour, John Roth was called in to replace Paul Taylor on rhythm guitar. The album coincided with the rise of grunge, which swept aside the brand of melodic pop metal that Winger represented.\n\nIn the 1990s, Winger was subject to mockery from MTV's animated series Beavis and Butt-head. Series creator Mike Judge later revealed that he had been incorrectly informed that Kip Winger had asked the network not to make jokes about the band on the series, which led to further jokes about the band, but later learned from Winger himself that he had never made any such stipulation. \u201cStewart\u201d, an early character from the TV show, wore a Winger t-shirt during the shows original run on MTV during the early 90s.\n\nAfter disbanding in 1994, bassist/lead vocalist Kip Winger went on to a solo career, guitarist Reb Beach went on to touring projects with artists Dokken, Alice Cooper and has held a permanent guitar spot in Whitesnake since 2002. The band's other members pursued or resumed careers as session musicians.\n\nReunions (2001\u2013present)\n\nIn 2001, it was announced that all original members of the band would return to the studio to record the song \"On the Inside\" for The Very Best of Winger. In 2002, all five members embarked on a reunion tour of the U.S. and Canada on a bill with Poison. According to Kip Winger, in a 2008 interview with rock and roll comic C.C. Banana, it was important to include all five members because \"it was the big, long-awaited reunion so I wanted to include everybody who had ever been in the band.\" In 2003, it was confirmed that activity had been halted due to Reb Beach's touring commitment with Whitesnake as well as his solo album \"Masquerade\" and involvement with \"super-group\" project The Mob with King's X frontman Doug Pinnick and Night Ranger drummer Kelly Keagy.\n\nOn July 16, 2005, it was announced that Kip Winger would perform as the lead singer for the Alan Parsons Live Project at the Common Ground Music Festival in Lansing, Michigan. In May 2006, it was confirmed that Winger had reformed without one of its original members Paul Taylor, to record another album and tour Europe. The album, IV, was released in Europe in October and the nine-country \"Winger IV Tour\" ran in the last two weeks of the same month.\n\nOn February 25, 2008, the band performed in Providence, Rhode Island, as part of a benefit for survivors of the Station nightclub fire. The concert, along with other artists was debuted on VH1 Classic on March 23, 2008. In late 2009, it was confirmed that Winger would record a fifth album Karma, with a tour to support it. Most recently, John Roth became the guitarist for Giant and would appear on their forthcoming album Promise Land then set for release in February/March of 2010.\n\nWinger released their sixth studio album titled, Better Days Comin' in April 2014, after teasers were published on Kip Winger's website and on the official Winger Facebook page as well.\n\nAs of late 2018, Winger was playing club dates. They were scheduled on Dec 29, 2018 in Westland, Michigan.\n\nStyle and influences.\n\nThe band's musical style combines elements of glam metal and progressive metal. Kip Winger, in description of the band's musical ability and style, said, \"Our band was known to musicians, and a lot of musicians showed up to see me play \u2014 watching, trying to figure out how I'm playing. We were like the 'hair band' (version of) Dream Theater.\""}, {"url": "https://myrockmixtapes.com/2016/09/12/the-story-of-wingers-headed-for-a-heartbreak/", "page_content": "\u201cHeaded for a Heartbreak\u201d was one of those songs which I instantly fell in love with, the very second I heard for the first time. I had no idea who Winger were but thankfully, this song opened a new door for me and I got the chance to explore more of Kip Winger\u2019s incredible voice and persona, as well as discover other beautiful songs of them, such as \u201cMiles Away\u201d and \u201cSeventeen\u201d.\n\nWinger debuted way too late. The 80s were long gone, music styles and directions were changing and the hair/glam metal era was beginning to fade. What they were bringing to the table was no longer desired, unfortunately. Just after a few successful singles and two platinum albums, they decided to call it quits. Yes, they did release a bunch of new stuff in 2006, 2009 and 2014 but, you know, it\u2019s not the same. To me, personally, their first two albums were absolutely the best!\n\nAnyhow, as I was saying, \u201cHeaded for a Heartbreak\u201d is definitely one of my favorite \u201880s rock tunes and most certainly in my \u201ctop 10 power ballads\u201d list. Kip is absolutely killing it with his vocals and the beautiful guitar solo is just transferring me to another dimension\u2026And the lyrics \u2013 definitely nothing so special or distinctive about them, but still quite painful, emotional and quite relatable, as I\u2019m sure many of us have been in a similar situation as the protagonist of this song. There\u2019s also this unique orchestra aura that surrounds the song, achieved by the keyboard bits, which actually made me fall for this song so much!\n\n\n\nThe track was released in May 1989, as a single from Winger\u2018s self-titled debut album. It was written by the lead singer of the band \u2013 Kip Winger. According to him, this is the most definite Winger song.\n\n\n\n\u201cI wrote the riff and we jammed on it a little bit, and it was just one of those things that happened magically. You\u2019ll talk to many people who think the best ideas happen by accident, and that was definitely one of them. A lot of times I\u2019ll sit down and the s\u2013t will just drop into my hands and I don\u2019t even think about it. That was one of those songs,\u201d Kip Winger said in an interview.\n\nWritten in a lydian scale, the song tells us a story about a man, who wants to be left alone and move on with his life, as his love has become a stranger to him. Despite that he\u2019s going to be heartbroken, he chooses to \u201clive again\u201d instead of keep on dealing with the pain she\u2019s causing him.\n\n\n\n\u201cHeaded For A Heartbreak\u201d LYRICS\n\nYeah\u2026 Morning came and I was on my way\n\nWhen you reminded me\n\nI had too soon forgotten\n\nIt was you that set me free\n\nYeah, you were here when I came\n\nYou\u2019ll be here when I\u2019m gone\n\nSo don\u2019t be waiting on love\n\n\u2018Cause I\u2019ll be waiting to ramble on Headed for a heartbreak\n\nHeaded for a heartbreak Darling, don\u2019t wait up for me\n\nTonight I won\u2019t be home\n\nYou\u2019ve become a stranger\n\nI just got to be alone\n\nDon\u2019t need nobody on my side\n\nTo dull the blade I\u2019m on\n\nSo don\u2019t be waiting on love\n\n\u2018Cause I\u2019ll be waiting to ramble on Headed for a heartbreak\n\nHeaded for a heartbreak\n\nHeaded for a heartbreak It\u2019s not a mistake\n\nDon\u2019t you think I can feel the pain?\n\nI walk away, to live again\u2026 Headed for a heartbreak\n\nHeaded for a heartbreak (Don\u2019t make me hurt you)\n\nHeaded for a heartbreak (\u2018Cause I love you\u2026)\n\nHeaded for a heartbreak Don\u2019t you think I feel the pain?\n\nReferences: \u201cHeaded for a Heartbreak\u201d by Winger, retrieved from http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=33963\n\n\u201cHeaded for a Heartbreak\u201d Lyrics, retrieved from http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/winger/headedforaheartbreak.html\n\nP.S.

A quartet of singles in Madalaine, Headed for a Heartbreak, Hungry, and the most outrageous lyrics in the hair metal game in Seventeen make for a strong debut album for Kip Winger and the band.\n\nUpdated Oct 28 2022\n\nThe lyrics of Winger's Seventeen are upper echelon hair metal lyrics. Singles Madalaine, Headed for a Heartbreak, and Hungry highlight Winger's debut album.\n\nRecorded at Atlantic Studios in New York City, and coming in at a concise 43:50, Winger's self-titled album was produced by Alice Cooper, Warrant, and Ratt collaborator, Beau Hill.\n\nWinger songs are an eclectic mix of hair metal, prog rock, and power pop balladry. I think this is due to the outstanding musicians who made up the band. Moving beyond Kip, we have:\n\nReb Beach (lead guitar, backing vocals)\n\nReb was in hair metal bands: Winger, Whitesnake, and Dokken. Beyond that, he contributed to a ton of other projects, including Alice Cooper, Danger Danger, Twisted Sister, and even Chaka Khan.\n\nPaul Taylor (keyboards, backing vocals)\n\nBeyond the band Winger, Taylor has played with Eric Martin of Mr. Big, Aldo Nova, Steve Perry, and other rock legends.\n\nRod Morgenstein (drums, backing vocals)\n\nDrummer Rod Morgenstein teaches percussion at Berklee in Boston. So there's that. Plus, he's played with guitar legend Steve Morse.\n\nThe guys Kip chose to play with are no slouches. I mean sure, they might not have had Kip's gracious chest plummage. But really, who does!?\n\nIt's actually got some strong songs.\n\nThe Winger album cover art is interesting. The multi-layered face thing ... The string or laser beam (unsure) through the eye ... The Def Leppard lettering ...\n\nSlicing your head like a laser beam ... the album cover is as if Kip foreshadowed his future contribution to the Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey soundtrack.\n\nWinger notes\n\nMadalaine\n\nA big Mark Slaughter YEEAAAAHH from Kip to start Madalaine. For it.\n\nYou need to see the video to watch Kip Winger rip out the power bass player look.\n\nShreddy guitar fun in the solo with some solid whammy/tapping.\n\nKEY CHANGE! Like an old friend, always nice to see.\n\nHungry\n\nWhoa! What a video (and song).\n\nAlright, let me set the scene.\n\nGuy gets married\n\nGets in a car accident with his girl after skidding around many turns\n\nHe gets tossed from the car\n\nThen watches the car blow up\n\nNow he is hungry for her physical love\n\nBro, she hasn't been dead for more than 30 seconds. Kids these days ...\n\nAnyway, Hungry rocks.\n\nSeventeen\n\nLike Benny Mardones Into the Night, but hair metal.\n\nBoth Into the Night and Seventeen's lyrics are superiorly creepy. But hair metal is the great equalizer, and Winger's song rocks.\n\nSeventeen is written like an 80s hair metal madlib.\n\nI'm only 17. I'll show you love like you ain't never seen. She's only 17. Daddy says she's too young, but she's old enough for me.\n\nThese lyrics are criminal in MANY states.\n\nLook at them laughing in the video. They know something is wrong with all of this and ... nevermind, bitchin' solo.\n\nBig \"Uh\" at 2:33.\n\nShe loves to work shirtless Kip overtime. Are seventeen year olds even legally allowed to work overtime? Pretty sure not.\n\nShe's a magic mountain, she's a leather glove, she's my soul, it must be love.\n\nI feel disgusted just typing it. But hey, it was the 80s, I guess anything went. At least Reb smokes out dope riff after dope riff.\n\nWithout the Night\n\nYou can feel the heartbreak thumping in your metal heart on Without the Night.\n\nKip's bass interplays well with the synth. His vocals take on a Jani Lane on Cherry Pie tone on this track 4 ballad.\n\nSome nice medium power Dimarzio Super Distortions (guessing) all over the lead track.\n\nPurple Haze\n\nWinger adds all the sex to Purple Haze that Jimi Hendrix left out. And all the Aqua Net. And all the falsetto.\n\nI don't hate it though. They don't back down when faced with the challenge of covering Jimi, and I applaud them for it.\n\nCameo by Dweezil Zappa, cause why not?\n\nState of Emergency\n\nFun vocal effects. Decent riffing to kick State of Emergency off. I don't hate this glam prog thing. This could have been on the Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure soundtrack - it has the right feel.\n\nIs it me or did the chorus go minor in the second half of the song!?!? Total pro move.\n\nI bet the keys player (Paul Taylor) suggested it. Every band needs one. A keys player that is.\n\n... and a choral modulation.\n\nTime to Surrender\n\nA song made by bad asses, for bad asses. Reb Beach sprinkles notes like cheese on a pizza. Rod Morgenstein hits pretty hard on Time to Surrender.\n\nPoison Angel\n\nNot be confused with Fallen Angel by Poison, Poison Angel follows in the footsteps of Seventeen with a fistful of innuendo, just NOWHERE near as good.\n\nPoison Angel is co-written by Kip Winger and Reb Beach ... and it sounds like it was. Total bass and guitar shred it up tune.\n\nLove the ending, from the dive bomb to extra shred.\n\nHangin' On\n\nBitchin' intro! Calls out to Damn Yankees Coming of Age, with a hint of early Van Halen.\n\nAnd a ... Warrant Pre-Chorus!?\n\nGang vocals are keeping me interested.\n\nReb Beach really rocks. I underappreciated him in my youth.\n\nBack to the Damn Yankees riff post chorus (or maybe Damn Yankees lifted it from Winger). Who cares?\n\nHeaded for a Heartbreak\n\nKip Winger is like, \"Coheed and Cambria, here, hold my beer! THIS is how you do prog rock!\"\n\nJokes aside, Headed for a Heartbreak is a pretty decent tune. The entire band shows up on this tune, especially Paul Taylor's keyboards.\n\nI can see Kip penning Headed for a Heartbreak now, thinking, \"gosh, the song is good, but the video will ascend to echelons not seen before or since. it will have a white piano, the color purple, someone half drowning, and it shall feature my chest hair! prominently!\"\n\nHigher and Higher\n\nHigher and Higher is just a standard, upbeat 80s hair metal track. A few verses, a few choruses, typical lyrics, a progressively more bad ass solo, whammy bars, high vocals, etc., etc., etc.\n\nTrack 11 \"Higher and Higher\" was a B-side of the Madalaine single\n\nThe list could go on, but the album does not.\n\nMore Winger Details\n\nWinger Info Release Date Length Producer Studio Record Label |\n\nReviews of Winger Albums"}, {"url": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/artist/114080", "page_content": "\n\nDown Incognito\n\nSeventeen\n\nMiles Away\n\nCan't Get Enuff\n\nHeaded for a Heartbreak\n\nEasy Come Easy Go\n\n4 users Winger - Seventeen4 users Winger - Miles Away4 users Winger - Headed for a Heartbreak4 users Winger - MadalaineAvailable in: Winger is an American hard rock band formed in New York City that gained popularity during the late 1980s and early 1990s.
