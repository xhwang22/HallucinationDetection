{"Charles Melville Hays was a strong advocate of the transcontinental railway, and was instrumental in securing the necessary funding from the Canadian government.": [{"url": "https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-victim/charles-melville-hays.html", "page_content": "Mr Charles Melville Hays, 55, was born at Rock Island, Illinois, USA, on 16 May 1856. He was educated at the public schools of Rock Island, and went to work for the Atlantic and Pacific Railway when he was 17. At 22 he was appointed secretary to the Manager of the Missouri Pacific Railway.\n\nHe married Clara Gregg in St. Louis Mo, 13 October 1881, and they had four daughters.\n\nIn 1889 he was appointed general manager of the entire Wabash Railway network. In 1896 he moved to Montreal to become general manager of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. It was Hays who convinced the Canadian Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, of the need for a second transcontinental railroad. To this extent, the Canadian government subsidized the Grand Trunk to the tune of $30-million, and in November 1902 construction of the railroad began. The company's board of directors in England, however, were more concerned with dividends than with risky expansion. Financing proved chaotic, and at the end of 1911 the railroad was 100-million in debt. Hays went to England for a directors meeting where he proposed to spend the companys way out of bankruptcy by upgrading rolling stock, double tracking and by building a chain of luxury hotels across Canada. Hays had already built the flagship hotel, the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier in Ottawa, and had plans for six others, including the Fort Garry in Winnipeg and the Macdonald Hotel in Edmonton.\n\nHe arrived in England \"looking fagged and tired,\" according to Alfred Smithers, Chairman of the Grand Trunk's board of directors. He was supposed to spend Easter in Paris with his daughter and son in law, Thornton and Orian Davidson, but in a letter to friends in Montreal on April 1, said he preferred to stay at Smithers country estate in Kent before sailing home on 10 April on the Titanic. The recipient is unknown, partly because the letter is so hard to decipher, it is possibly Lockett Gavin Coleman, asst. superintendant of the Grand Trunk Railroad but the informality of the letter suggests it was to a close friend or relative.\n\n\n\n(Courtesy and \u00a9 Craig Sopin,USA / Courtesy: Alan Hustak, Canada)\n\nDear [?Marin / Mavin] I thought you would be interested in seeing the decision in the [?Flessen - a law suit of that time] case + so enclose you the synopsis of same which please keep for my scrap book after you have read.

Hays\n\nWhile in England he recieved news that the third of his four daughters, Louise, was having a difficult pregnancy and might have to be delivered by Ceasearean section. ANother reason for his return was the imminent opening of the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier Hotel on April 26. Travelling with him would be Paul Romaine Chevr\u00e9, the sculptor who had done the bust of Laurier that still stands in the lobby.\n\nIn his business dealings Hays had had discussions with the White Star Line about speeding travellers from Europe to the Orient using White Star ships and his transcontinental railroad. As a result, J. Bruce Ismay invited Hays and his entourage as guests aboard Titanic. They paid \u00a393 10s to cover incidental expenses, travelled on ticket number 12749, and occupied four cabins: B-69-71-73 and B-24. (Mr and Mrs Hays in B-69, Thornton and Orian Davidson in B-71, their maid Miss Perreault in B-73 and Hays secretary, Vivian Payne, in B-24).\n\nOne hour before the disaster, Hays relaxed with Colonel Archibald Gracie and Captain Edward Crosby in the Gentlemen's Smoking Lounge and they talked about the technological advances in transportation. At one point, Hays conceded that while Titanic was a superlative vessel, he expressed concern that \"the trend to playing fast and loose with larger and larger ships will end in tragedy.\" Twenty minutes later, Titanic struck the iceburg. Hays never believed the ship would sink quickly. As he put his wife and daughter into a lifeboat he assured them Titanic would stay \"afloat for at least 10 hours.\"\n\nHays drowned in the disaster, but the Minia recovered his body on 26 April. \"It was no trouble to identify him as he had a lot of papers on him and a watch with his name on it,\" sailor Francis Dyke wrote to his mother. His coffin was brought back to Montreal for burial aboard his private railway car, Canada. The car is still preserved and on display at the Canadian Railway Museum near Delson, Quebec.\n\nSimultaneous funerals for Hays were held on 8 May at the American Presbyterian Church in Montreal...\n\n\n\n(Courtesy: Alan Hustak, Canada)\n\nand at the Church of St. Edmund King and Martyr in London. At 11:30 a.m. on the day of the funeral, as the Montreal Herald Reported:\n\n\"From Montreal to Chicago, from New Brunswick to the Pacific coast, in all the thousands of miles of sidings and branch lines owned and operated by the Grand Trunk Railway, in every Grand Trunk Depot, at every Grand Trunk crossing, action ceased for the space of five full minutes as the Grand Trunk Railway system paid its respects to the memory of its great departed chief. For five minutes activities were suspended and the thousands of individuals who serve the great system invarious capacities bowed their heads in silent tribute. Then once more work resumed, the wheels turned, and in 30 seconds things had been as they had before.\"\n\n\n\nCourtesy: Alan Hustak, Canada\n\nHays is buried in the Pine Hill Section, (Lot 246) of Montreals' Mount Royal Cemetery. A massive monument is inscribed: \"And so he died and the example of his simple, devoted consecrated life is our priceless heritage. We are a different people, we are a better people, because this man worked and loved and died.\"\n\nCourtesy: Alan Hustak, Canada Courtesy: Diane Lapierre, Canada\n\nThe town of Melville in Saskatchewan and Hays in Alberta, Canada are named for him, and a statue in his memory was erected in Prince Rupert, B.C. which would have been the Pacific terminus city of the transcontinental railroad he had planned to build.\n\nIn 1919 the Grand Trunk Railroad was placed in recievership, and later was absorbed into Canadian National Railways.\n\nNotes\n\nIn 1907 Hays was given Japan's highest decoration, the Order of the Rising Sun by Prince Fushimi, and in 1910 was offered a knighthood but turned it down because to become Sir Charles would have meant giving up his U.S. citizenship. His Japanese decoration can be seen today at the Lyman House Memorial Museum in Hilo, Hawaii."}, {"url": "https://www.liquisearch.com/charles_melville_hays/biography/career/transcontinental_railway", "page_content": "Transcontinental Railway\n\nAt this time in Canadian history the western prairies were being rapidly settled. Hays wanted to capitalize on the trend by constructing a transcontinental railroad within the borders of Canada to run 3,600 miles from Moncton, New Brunswick, to Prince Rupert, British Columbia. In 1900 he introduced a proposal to extend the lines of the Grand Trunk Western, an American subsidiary, from Chicago to Winnipeg \"and thence to the Pacific.\" However, he was turned down by the railroad's directors in London. Later that year, Hays left GTR to work for Southern Pacific but a change in ownership there lead to his resignation. He returned to the GTR to find that the president, Sir Charles Rivers Wilson had convinced the Board of Directors to pursue the transcontinental railway. Meanwhile the government, under Sir Wilfrid Laurier, had also decided to back the project. Plans to construct the transcontinental line were announced on November 24, 1902.\n\nHays' plan involved the creation of a subsidiary line from Winnipeg to Prince Rupert, with the government building the line from New Brunswick to Winnipeg. The cabinet became weary of Hays' demands for subsidies, but after negotiations between the government and Hays, aided by the railroad's president Rivers Wilson, the National Transcontinental Railway Act was passed in 1903. It enabled the incorporation of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP). The government's portion of the line would be called the National Transcontinental Railway (NTR).\n\nThere were problems with some of Hays' policies regarding the GTP. Firstly, he had planned to buy out the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) but the company resisted and instead provided competition. Secondly, Hays lacked support from the Board of Directors in London. He wanted to link the GTR with the GTP but the board would not back this plan. He thus proceeded on his own authority, making commitments that would ultimately ruin both the GTP and the GTR. Thirdly, Hays faced opposition to his choice of Prince Rupert, on Kaien Island, B.C., for the western terminal, because there was not much traffic there. Hays preferred the location as he felt that it would provide a shorter route for transshipment to destinations in Asia.\n\nHays made the construction of the mainline his priority, failing to develop feeder lines. CNoR and CPR joined forces to gain control of the prairie traffic. As a result of the competition between the three railroads, Canada ended up with three transcontinental railways instead of one. This was to result in the GTP being starved of traffic; even though it was arguably the best of the three, it ultimately failed to attract enough freight to make it profitable.\n\nAfter construction on the GTP began in 1905, Hays started the Grand Trunk Pacific Development Company in order to purchase thousands of acres of land on which he established town sites along the route of the railway, including Melville, Saskatchewan, which was named after him. Hays' vision went beyond the building of the railway. He also had plans for a fleet of ocean liners and a string of resort hotels across the Rocky Mountains. He hired the famed architect Francis Rattenbury from CPR to design a grand hotel, the Ch\u00e2teau Prince Rupert, at the westernmost stop on the railway. In 1909, only 3000 people lived in Prince Rupert, but anticipation of the railroad caused it to grow rapidly in spite of the rapidly rising cost of property and the muddy environs. The city was incorporated in 1910.\n\nAfter Rivers Wilson retired as the railroad's president in 1909, Hays was appointed to fill the position. By 1910, Grand Trunk union workers were demanding wages on par with those of railroad workers in the United States. A strike put a stop to construction. Hays finally gave into the workers' demands, but failed to re-hire 250 previously fired strikers despite promising to do so. He also denied workers their pensions, causing one member of Parliament to describe him as \"heartless, cruel, and tyrannical\".\n\nBy 1912, the cost of constructing the railway was increasing, with rising wages and price increases on materials, while the government refused to allow a rate increase. Another reason for the mounting costs was Hays' insistence on \"building to the very highest standards\". Meanwhile CNoR and CPR monopolized the traffic in the west. In addition, Grand Trunk, which would be leasing the NTR from the government, was responsible for paying back the construction cost of that line. Hays began to fear insolvency."}, {"url": "http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?id_nbr=7430", "page_content": "HAYS, CHARLES MELVILLE, railway official; b. 16 May 1856 in Rock Island, Ill.; m. 13 Oct. 1881 Clara J. Gregg in St Louis, Mo., and they had four daughters; d. 15 April 1912 in the North Atlantic, and was buried in Montreal.\n\nCharles M. Hays grew up and received his early education in St Joseph, Mo. At 17 he began work in St Louis with the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. In 1878 he was appointed secretary to the general manager of the Missouri Pacific and six years later he accepted a similar position with the larger Wabash, St Louis and Pacific. He became general manager of the Wabash Western in 1887 and of the entire Wabash system in 1889.\n\nA reorganization of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada in 1895 resulted in Hays\u2019s appointment as general manager of that system, effective 1 Jan. 1896, and his move with his family to Montreal. His predecessor, Lewis James Seargeant, became a special adviser to the GTR\u2019s London-based board of directors. With one interruption, in 1901, Hays held his position until 1909, when he was appointed president; he was president as well of the railway\u2019s western Canadian subsidiary, the Grand Trunk Pacific, from 1904 until his death.\n\nHe had arrived in Canada at a time of economic depression. The performance of railways had been disappointing for years, although the Canadian Pacific Railway had fared better than the larger, more heavily indebted GTR. Hays was brought in to make major managerial changes \u2013 specifically to introduce \u201cAmerican\u201d methods which were more aggressive and less scrupulous than those of British systems. His first responsibility was to restructure the GTR\u2019s administration and operations. Instead of relying only on the reports and recommendations of senior administrators in Britain, he sought the opinions and advice of operating staff in Canada. Traffic exchanges with other systems, the negotiation of running rights, and the modernization of accounting procedures solved many of the practical problems left unaddressed by the head office. Hays was even willing to sell important trackage between Toronto and Hamilton to the rival CPR, but only after the GTR had obtained an advantageous agreement on running rights. The improved efficiency resulting from these reforms coincided with an era of unprecedented growth and enabled him to bring the GTR from a state of near-bankruptcy to one of moderate success. In the process, Hays, a stocky man who invariably appeared well dressed with a neat beard, became known for his unwillingness to tolerate any interference in the way he ran the railway and for his implacable disdain for organized labour, especially during a dispute in Ontario in 1905 and a bitter, system-wide strike in 1910.\n\nAfter 1896 Canadian prosperity was based on the settlement of the prairies. To compete effectively with the CPR, Hays believed the GTR had to cross them. In 1900 he had advanced a grandiose plan to run the lines of an American subsidiary, the Grand Trunk Western, from Chicago to Winnipeg and thence to the Pacific. The directors in London rejected this proposal and in late 1900 Hays resigned to become president of the Southern Pacific Railroad in the United States as of 1 Jan. 1901. Unfortunately for him, it was taken over by the interests of railway magnate Edward Henry Harriman. Hays disagreed with the new owners and quit; by the end of 1901 he had returned to his old job, and a vice-presidency, at the GTR. In the meantime its board had been persuaded by president Sir Charles Rivers Wilson to adopt an aggressive policy of westward expansion. Significantly too, the federal government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier had decided to promote the building of a second transcontinental railway. On the failure of the GTR and the smaller, prairie-based Canadian Northern to unite on such a project, Ottawa threw its support behind the GTR. On 24 Nov. 1902 Hays formally announced plans to construct a transcontinental.\n\nThe Grand Trunk Pacific, Hays\u2019s greatest and most controversial work in Canada, was to consist of two sections: a line west from Winnipeg and a government-built line between Winnipeg and Moncton, N.B., that was to connect with the old Grand Trunk system. Hays was responsible for the construction and operation policies of the new western line. His persistent demands for federal subsidization, however, contributed to bitter discord within Laurier\u2019s cabinet [see Andrew George Blair*], which could not agree on a policy. In May 1903 Hays was joined by president Sir Charles Wilson, who was able to exert greater influence on cabinet; together they formed an effective team, one tough, the other smooth. Hays was willing to promise whatever Wilson thought diplomatically necessary, but he did so only if there were no real means for the government to enforce terms that the GTP might find inconvenient in the future. Nevertheless, his concessions were critically important in meeting specific political difficulties faced by Laurier when he was promoting the transcontinental scheme in parliament that summer and fall. In October the National Transcontinental Railway Act was passed and the GTP was incorporated.\n\nFour aspects of Hays\u2019s GTP policies were particularly problematic. He seriously underestimated the Canadian Northern, whose owners he thought would sell out to him but who, instead, launched vigorous competition. A second, more difficult matter was the commitment of the GTR to the GTP. There were no existing traffic links between the two systems, and the board in London was not willing to give the western project its unqualified support. Nevertheless, Hays, acting without proper authorization from London, committed the parent company in 1903 to conditions which would ultimately ruin the GTP and the Grand Trunk. The selection in 1905 of the site of Prince Rupert, on Kaien Island, B.C., as the western terminal was the third controversial decision supported by Hays. There was little local traffic on the portion of the line in northern British Columbia, only 100 miles of which had been built by 1912, but Hays insisted that it would prove beneficial since it shortened the route to Asia.\n\nA final, disastrous decision involved the priority Hays gave to the construction of the GTP to the highest standards in North America, before a system of feeders had been developed on the prairies. The resulting delay in completion and the lack of competition allowed the CPR and the Canadian Northern to consolidate their holds on traffic on the prairies. Consequently, what was arguably the best main line across western Canada did not attract the volume of freight needed for profitable operation.\n\nHays did not live to see the GTP completed: he perished in the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. Sanctified by this tragic end and by his high social standing in Montreal, including membership in the American Presbyterian Church, he was eulogized as one of Canada\u2019s greatest railwaymen. On 25 April 1912 work and movement on the GTR\u2019s entire system stopped for five minutes in tribute. Hays\u2019s legacy, however, was mixed. He presided over the most prosperous era in the history of the GTR, but as president of the GTP he initiated policies and programs which led in 1919 to the GTP being placed in receivership and to legislation authorizing federal acquisition of the GTR\u2019s capital stock. During the proceedings of the board appointed to value this stock, it was alleged that Hays had deceived the London directors in 1903 and that they had never knowingly endorsed the scheme that led to the insolvency and nationalization of the entire system.\n\nTheodore D.

Hays kam 1856 in der Stadt Rock Island in Illinois an der Grenze zu Iowa zur Welt. 1873 begann er im Alter von 17 Jahren, f\u00fcr die Atlantic and Pacific Railroad zu arbeiten. 1878 wurde er Sekret\u00e4r des Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrers der Missouri Pacific Railroad und 1884 nahm er dieselbe Position bei der Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway ein. 1887 stieg er zum Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer der Unterabteilung Wabash Western Railroad und 1889 zum Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer der gesamten Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway auf.\n\nHays lebte viele Jahre in Kanada und arbeitete dort f\u00fcr die Grand Trunk Railway , einer der damals gr\u00f6\u00dften Eisenbahngesellschaften Kanadas. Bei einer Neuorganisation des Unternehmens im Jahr 1895 wurde er mit Wirkung vom 1. Januar 1896 zum Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer ernannt. Bis auf eine kurze Unterbrechung 1901 hatte Hays von 1899 bis 1910 die Position des Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrers inne. Ab dem 1. Januar 1910 war er Pr\u00e4sident des gesamten Unternehmens.\n\nHays ging w\u00e4hrend einer Zeit der wirtschaftlichen Rezession nach Kanada. Sein Plan war es, das Management und die Arbeitsweise der Grand Trunk Railway in eine angriffslustigere, US-nahe Richtung zu lenken. Das Wachstum des amerikanischen Eisenbahnwesens in der ersten H\u00e4lfte des 20. Jahrhunderts wird unter anderem dieser Tatsache zugeschrieben. Au\u00dferdem wollte er der Canadian Pacific Railroad Konkurrenz machen, die durch einen Einwanderungsboom in den l\u00e4ndlichen Regionen Rekordzahlen bei der Passagierbef\u00f6rderung verzeichnete.\n\n1907 wurde Charles Hays mit dem h\u00f6chsten Orden Japans , dem Orden der Aufgehenden Sonne , ausgezeichnet. 1910 wurde ihm die Ritterschaft angeboten, was ihn zu Sir Charles Hays gemacht h\u00e4tte. Er lehnte diese Ehrung jedoch ab, da sie den Verlust seiner US-amerikanischen Staatsb\u00fcrgerschaft zur Folge gehabt h\u00e4tte. Hays interessierte sich auch f\u00fcr das Gesundheits-, und Bildungswesen und f\u00fcr wohlt\u00e4tige Zwecke. Er unter anderem Vorsteher des Montreal General Hospital , des Royal Victoria Hospital und der McGill University in Montreal .\n\nBau der transkontinentalen Eisenbahnstrecke Bearbeiten ]\n\n1899 schlossen die beiden kanadischen Eisenbahnunternehmer Sir William Mackenzie und Sir Donald Mann mehrere kleinere Eisenbahngesellschaften zur Canadian Northern Railway zusammen und planten den Bau einer zweiten transkontinentalen Eisenbahnverbindung. Finanzielle Unterst\u00fctzung durch die kanadische Regierung lehnten sie jedoch ab, da sie es aus eigenen Kr\u00e4ften schaffen wollten. Auf Druck von Hays nahm die Grand Trunk Railway staatliche Unterst\u00fctzung an, was sie noch in den 1870ern strikt abgelehnt hatte. Durch diese Tatsache hatte sich die Regierung damals der Canadian Pacific Railroad zugewandt. Da er erkannte, dass es ein Fehler war, nicht in den Westen zu expandieren, nahm Hays das Angebot der Regierung an, eine Eisenbahnstrecke von Prince Rupert in British Columbia (kanadische Westk\u00fcste) nach Moncton in New Brunswick (kanadische Ostk\u00fcste) zu bauen. Diese Strecke sollte den Namen Grand Trunk Pacific Railway tragen.\n\nIm Oktober 1903 passierte der National Transcontinental Railway Act das kanadische Parlament. Hays war daraufhin in die Beaufsichtigung des Baus des Streckenabschnitts westlich von Winnipeg involviert. Grand Trunk hatte die Verantwortung f\u00fcr den westlichen Teil der Strecke \u00fcbernommen, w\u00e4hrend die Regierung den \u00f6stlichen Teil von Winnipeg nach Moncton \u00fcbernahm, darunter den kostspieligen Bau der Quebec Bridge \u00fcber dem Sankt-Lorenz-Strom . Die gesamte Verbindung sollte jedoch von der Grand Trunk Railway als ein System verwaltet werden. 1904 wurde Hays zum Pr\u00e4sidenten der Grand Trunk Pacific Railway ernannt.\n\nDer Spatenstich f\u00fcr das Bauvorhaben wurde am 11. September 1905 in Fort William in Ontario durch Premierminister Wilfrid Laurier vorgenommen. Von dort aus wurde durch die Grand Trunk Pacific Construction Company ein 190 Meilen langer Streckenabschnitt bis in die N\u00e4he von Sioux Lookout gebaut. Das Projekt erwies sich als kontrovers und Hays f\u00fcr einige seiner Entscheidungen kritisiert, darunter die Wahl von Prince Rupert als Endstation. Auch der Finanzierung haperte es trotz staatlicher Zuwendung. Ende des Jahres 1911 hatte das Unternehmen Schulden in Millionenh\u00f6he. Mehrere neue Vorhaben sollten Grand Trunk wieder in die roten Zahlen bringen, darunter der Bau einer Kette von Luxushotels in Kanada. Hays hatte bereits das Ch\u00e2teau Laurier in Ottawa gebaut und sechs weitere waren in Planung, darunter das Fort Garry in Winnipeg und das Hotel Macdonald in Edmonton\n\nTrotz der Schwierigkeiten konnte die Strecke fertig gestellt werden, jedoch erst im April 1914, zwei Jahre nach Hays\u2018 Tod.\n\nPrivatleben Bearbeiten ]\n\nAm 13. Oktober 1881 heiratete Hays in St. Louis , Missouri die 22-j\u00e4hrige Clara Jennings Gregg, die aus dieser Stadt stammte. Sie bekamen vier T\u00f6chter: Orian (sp\u00e4ter Mrs. Thornton Davidson), Clara (Mrs. Hope C. Scott), Marjorie (Mrs. George D. Hall) und Louise (Mrs. A. Harold Grier).\n\nIm Jahr 1912 verbrachte Charles Hays die Osterfeiertage mit seiner Frau, seiner Tochter Orian und seinem Schwiegersohn Thornton Davidson in Paris . Da er an der feierlichen Er\u00f6ffnung des Ch\u00e2teau Laurier am 26. April 1912 in Ottawa teilnehmen sollte, ging die Gruppe am 10. April 1912 in Southampton an Bord der RMS Titanic , dem bis dahin gr\u00f6\u00dften Schiff der Welt, das zu seiner Jungfernfahrt nach New York in See stach. Ein weiterer Grund f\u00fcr die R\u00fcckreise war die schwierige Schwangerschaft der Hays-Tochter Louise Grier, der m\u00f6glicherweise ein Kaiserschnitt bevor stand.\n\nDie Gruppe belegte insgesamt vier Kabinen der Ersten Klasse auf dem B-Deck. Das Ehepaar Hays bewohnte die Kabine B-69 und das Ehepaar Davidson die Nachbarkabine B-71. Clara Hays\u2018 Dienstm\u00e4dchen Mary Perreault war in B-73 untergebracht und Charles Hays\u2018 Sekret\u00e4r Vivian Payne in B-24. Am Abend des 14. April sa\u00df Hays mit Colonel Archibald Gracie und dem Schiffsmagnaten Captain Edward Crosby im Rauchsalon der Ersten Klasse und besprach mit ihnen die rasanten technischen Fortschritte im Transportwesen. Er dr\u00fcckte seine Besorgnis folgenderma\u00dfen aus: \u201eDer Trend, immer schneller und leichtlebiger mit immer gr\u00f6\u00dferen Schiffen zu spielen, wird in einer Trag\u00f6die enden\u201c.\n\nEtwa 20 Minuten sp\u00e4ter rammte die Titanic den Eisberg . Hays schien nicht davon auszugehen, dass das Schiff schnell sinken w\u00fcrde. Als er seine Frau und seine Tochter in ein Rettungsboot setzte, sagte er ihnen, dass das Schiff noch \u201emindestens 10 Stunden schwimmf\u00e4hig sei\u201c. Clara Hays, Orian Davidson und Mary Perreault \u00fcberlebten im Rettungsboot Nr. 3. Dieses Boot wurde auf der Steuerbordseite zu Wasser gelassen, wo der Erste Offizier William M. Murdoch das Ausbooten \u00fcberwachte. Im Gegensatz zu Charles Lightoller auf der Backbordseite lie\u00df Murdoch auch M\u00e4nner in die Boote, wenn nach dem Einsteigen der Frauen und Kinder noch Platz war. Charles Hays, sein Schwiegersohn und sein Sekret\u00e4r blieben trotzdem an Bord. Alle drei kamen bei dem Untergang ums Leben. Die drei Frauen wurden zusammen mit den anderen \u00dcberlebenden an Bord der RMS Carpathia nach New York gebracht, wo das Schiff am 18. April einlief.\n\nPostum Bearbeiten ]\n\nAm 25. April 1912 wurde bei der gesamten Grand Trunk Railway eine f\u00fcnfmin\u00fctige Schweigepause f\u00fcr den verstorbenen Unternehmenspr\u00e4sidenten eingelegt. Am darauffolgenden Tag fand der Kabelleger Minia, der neben anderen Schiffen mit der Bergung der Todesopfer beauftragt war, die Leiche von Charles Hays (#307) im Nordatlantik . Am 8. Mai 1912 fand auf dem Friedhof Mont-Royal in Montreal die Beisetzung statt. Am selben Tag wurden in der American Presbyterian Church in Montreal und in der Church of St. Edmund King and Martyr in London Trauerfeiern f\u00fcr Hays abgehalten. Er wurde in der Pine Hill Section des Mount Royal Cemetery (Grab # 246) bestattet.\n\nDie Stadt Melville in der kanadischen Provinz Saskatchewan wurde nach Hays benannt, ebenso die Charles Hays Secondary School in Prince Rupert. Clara Hays blieb unverheiratet und lebte bis zu ihrem Tod 1955 haupts\u00e4chlich in Maine . Sie wurde neben ihrem Ehemann bestattet. Auch Orian Davidson wurde nach ihrem Tod 1979 neben ihren Eltern beigesetzt.\n\nQuellen Bearbeiten ]\n\nGrand Trunk Pacific Railway\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation , search\n\nThis article needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . (January 2008)\n\nThe Last Spike: Fort Fraser, BC, 1914\n\nThe Grand Trunk Pacific Railway ( reporting mark GTP) was a historical Canadian railway.\n\nA wholly owned subsidiary of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR), the GTPR was constructed by GTR using loans provided by the Government of Canada . The company was formed in 1903 with a mandate to build west from Winnipeg, Manitoba to the Pacific coast at Prince Rupert, British Columbia . East of Winnipeg, the federal government would build the National Transcontinental Railway (NTR) across Northern Ontario and Quebec , crossing the St. Lawrence River at Quebec City and ending at Moncton, New Brunswick . The conceptual plan was to have GTR operate both GTPR and NTR as a single transcontinental railway, competing with the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR).\n\nHistory\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the GTR planned a second Canadian transcontinental rail route with a terminal on the Pacific that would be nearer to Asia than Vancouver . It would follow one of the routes surveyed by Sandford Fleming from Winnipeg to Port Simpson at the end of the Portland Canal which formed part of the boundary between British Columbia and Alaska . In 1903 there was resentment in Canada over the Alaska boundary decision which favoured US interests after a British commissioner sided with them. As a result of the clamour in Canada, US President Theodore Roosevelt threatened to send an occupation force to nearby territory. Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier considered a new location at Prince Rupert would be more easily defended and decided to build the terminal there rather than at Port Simpson. [1]\n\nTurning of the first sod for the construction of the GTPR, took place at an official ceremony, September 11, 1905, at Fort William, Ontario , by Prime Minister Laurier. From there a 190-mile section of track was built by the Grand Trunk Pacific Construction Company, connecting with the NTR, near Sioux Lookout .\n\nConstruction began on the Canadian Prairies in 1905, the year that the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were established. Construction proceeded west to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in 1907, Edmonton, Alberta in 1909, and through Jasper, Alberta into Yellowhead Pass crossing the Continental Divide in 1910-1911. The last spike ceremony heralding completion of the rail line across the prairies, and through the Rocky Mountains to the newly constructed seaport at Prince Rupert, British Columbia was held one mile east of Fort Fraser, British Columbia on April 7, 1914.\n\nIn 1910, the company also built a dock in Seattle, the Grand Trunk Pacific dock , which was the largest dock on the west coast at the time it was built. On July 30, 1914, the dock was destroyed by fire .\n\nOperations\n\nMain article: Last Spike (Grand Trunk Pacific Railway)\n\nThe GTPR did not immediately realize the traffic potential GTR and the federal government had hoped. CPR occupied the more populous southern route in the prairies through Regina, Saskatchewan and Calgary, Alberta to Vancouver, British Columbia and was using land grants provided by the federal government as well as government incentives to draw immigrants and businesses to settle along its route. GTR did not have a coordinated marketing plan, and efforts at settlement were disrupted by the First World War . GTR rejected operating the NTR for cost reasons, forcing the federal government to assume that operation into Canadian Government Railways .\n\nBy 1919 it was obvious that the GTPR was not paying its way. The financial strain broke on March 7 when GTR defaulted on repayment of construction loans to the federal government, whereby the GTPR was nationalized and taken over by a Board of Management operating under the Department of Railways and Canals while legalities were resolved. On July 12, 1920 the GTPR was placed under the management of Crown corporation Canadian National Railways (CNR) and in 1923 was completely absorbed into the CNR.\n\nThe chateau-style hotels of the early 20th century remain iconic Canadian symbols. While the CPR quite rightly receives credit for many of the early hotels of this genre such as The Banff Springs Hotel , The Empress (hotel) in Victoria, The Royal York in Toronto, Hotel Vancouver , Quebec City's Chateau Frontenac and Chateau Lake Louise in The Rockies, it was the GTPR that built Ottawa's Chateau Laurier , The Fort Garry Hotel in Winnipeg, and The Hotel Macdonald in Edmonton. After the nationalization, this tradition continued with construction of The Bessborough Hotel in Saskatoon. The GTPR chateau-style hotels remain among the most impressive of these structures in the country.\n\nCurrent status\n\nToday, the majority of the GTPR is still in use as CN's (name change to Canadian National or acronym CN in 1960) main line from Winnipeg to Jasper. West of Jasper, CN's main line swings south on the former Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) to Vancouver, however the GTPR line to Prince Rupert forms an important CN secondary main line. The GTPR's high construction standards and the fact Yellowhead Pass has the lowest elevation of any railway crossing of the Continental Divide in North America gives the CN a competitive advantage in terms of fuel efficiency and the ability to haul tonnage.\n\nPrince Rupert is the primary marine-railway connection for the Alaska Railroad , and despite having languished as a poor cousin to the Port of Vancouver , there are many opportunities for this port city as a result of the GTPR's foresight a century ago.\n\nThe Johnston Terminal at The Forks in Winnipeg was originally a cold storage facility for the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway.

He was educated at the public schools of Rock Island, and went to work for the Atlantic and Pacific Railway when he was 17. At 22 he was appointed secretary to the Manager of the Missouri Pacific Railway.\n\nHe married Clara Gregg in St. Louis Mo, 13 October 1881, and they had four daughters.\n\nIn 1889 he was appointed general manager of the entire Wabash Railway network. In 1896 he moved to Montreal to become general manager of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. It was Hays who convinced the Canadian Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, of the need for a second transcontinental railroad. To this extent, the Canadian government subsidized the Grand Trunk to the tune of $30-million, and in November 1902 construction of the railroad began. The company's board of directors in England, however, were more concerned with dividends than with risky expansion. Financing proved chaotic, and at the end of 1911 the railroad was 100-million in debt. Hays went to England for a directors meeting where he proposed to spend the company's way out of bankruptcy by upgrading rolling stock, double tracking and by building a chain of luxury hotels across Canada. Hays had already built the flagship hotel, the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier in Ottawa, and had plans for six others, including the Fort Garry in Winnipeg and the Macdonald Hotel in Edmonton.\n\nHe arrived in England \"looking fagged and tired,\" according to Alfred Smithers, Chairman of the Grand Trunk's board of directors. He was supposed to spend Easter in Paris with his daughter and son in law, Thornton and Orian Davidson, but in a letter to friends in Montreal on April 1, said he preferred to stay at Smithers country estate in Kent before sailing home on 10 April on the Titanic. The recipient is unknown, partly because the letter is so hard to decipher, it is possibly Lockett Gavin Coleman, asst. superintendant of the Grand Trunk Railroad but the informality of the letter suggests it was to a close friend or relative. [See Titanica page for images and transcriptions of letters]\n\nWhile in England he recieved news that the third of his four daughters, Louise, was having a difficult pregnancy and might have to be delivered by Ceasearean section. ANother reason for his return was the imminent opening of the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier Hotel on April 26. Travelling with him would be Paul Romaine Chevr\u00e9, the sculptor who had done the bust of Laurier that still stands in the lobby.\n\nIn his business dealings Hays had had discussions with the White Star Line about speeding travellers from Europe to the Orient using White Star ships and his transcontinental railroad. As a result, J. Bruce Ismay invited Hays and his entourage as guests aboard Titanic. They paid \u00a393 10s to cover incidental expenses, travelled on ticket number 12749, and occupied four cabins: B-69-71-73 and B-24. (Mr and Mrs Hays in B-69, Thornton and Orian Davidson in B-71, their maid Miss Perreault in B-73 and Hays secretary, Vivian Payne, in B-24).\n\nOne hour before the disaster, Hays relaxed with Colonel Archibald Gracie and Captain Edward Crosby in the Gentlemen's Smoking Lounge and they talked about the technological advances in transportation. At one point, Hays conceded that while Titanic was a superlative vessel, he expressed concern that \"the trend to playing fast and loose with larger and larger ships will end in tragedy.\" Twenty minutes later, Titanic struck the iceburg. Hays never believed the ship would sink quickly. As he put his wife and daughter into a lifeboat he assured them Titanic would stay \"afloat for at least 10 hours.\"\n\nHays drowned in the disaster, but the Minia recovered his body on 26 April. \"It was no trouble to identify him as he had a lot of papers on him and a watch with his name on it,\" sailor Francis Dyke wrote to his mother. His coffin was brought back to Montreal for burial aboard his private railway car, Canada. The car is still preserved and on display at the Canadian Railway Museum near Delson, Quebec.\n\nSimultaneous funerals for Hays were held on 8 May at the American Presbyterian Church in Montreal...\n\n...and at the Church of St. Edmund King and Martyr in London. At 11:30 a.m. on the day of the funeral, as the Montreal Herald Reported:\n\n\"From Montreal to Chicago, from New Brunswick to the Pacific coast, in all the thousands of miles of sidings and branch lines owned and operated by the Grand Trunk Railway, in every Grand Trunk Depot, at every Grand Trunk crossing, action ceased for the space of five full minutes as the Grand Trunk Railway system paid its respects to the memory of its great departed chief. For five minutes activities were suspended and the thousands of individuals who serve the great system in various capacities bowed their heads in silent tribute. Then once more work resumed, the wheels turned, and in 30 seconds things had been as they had before.\"\n\nHays is buried in the Pine Hill Section, (Lot 246) of Montreals' Mount Royal Cemetery. A massive monument is inscribed:\n\n\"And so he died and the example of his simple, devoted consecrated life is our priceless heritage. We are a different people, we are a better people, because this man worked and loved and died.\"\n\n\n\nThe town of Melville in Saskatchewan and Hays in Alberta, Canada are named for him, and a statue in his memory was erected in Prince Rupert, B.C. which would have been the Pacific terminus city of the transcontinental railroad he had planned to build.\n\nIn 1919 the Grand Trunk Railroad was placed in recievership, and later was absorbed into Canadian National Railways.\n\nNotes\n\nIn 1907 Hays was given Japan's highest decoration, the Order of the Rising Sun by Prince Fushimi, and in 1910 was offered a knighthood but turned it down because to become Sir Charles would have meant giving up his U.S. citizenship. His Japanese decoration can be seen today at the Lyman House Memorial Museum in Hilo, Hawaii.\n\nTravelling Companions (on same ticket)\n\nReferences and Sources\n\nNewark Evening News, 16 April 1912, Word Received Here of C.

Hasta hace muy poco no ten\u00edamos ni siquiera una fotograf\u00eda de \u00e9l, pero en marzo de 2.013 finalmente se public\u00f3 la \u00fanica de la que existe constancia. La imagen muestra a un Vivian beb\u00e9, con apenas 9 meses.\n\nVivian Payne con apenas 9 meses. La imagen est\u00e1 deteriorada, pero el paso del tiempo no ha podido ocultar sus ojos llenos de vida y la atm\u00f3sfera de futuro que cualquier ni\u00f1o de su edad desprende. Lamentablemente, para Vivian ser\u00eda un futuro demasiado corto\n\nQueremos que esta entrada sirva como homenaje a todos los j\u00f3venes llenos de sue\u00f1os que se hundieron con el Titanic y de los que apenas conocemos los nombres.\n\n__________\n\nVivian Ponsonby Payne naci\u00f3 en 1.889. Su padre, un contable de la Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, muri\u00f3 en 1.903 cuando Vivian s\u00f3lo ten\u00eda 13 a\u00f1os. El presidente de la compa\u00f1\u00eda donde trabajaba, Charles Melville Hays, se convirti\u00f3 casi en un padre para el chico tras el fallecimiento del suyo. Para Hays fue todo un placer ya que s\u00f3lo ten\u00eda hijas.\n\nCharles Hays, el que fuera como un padre para Vivian tras la muerte del suyo\n\nAsisti\u00f3 a la Escuela Superior de Montreal, donde fue calificado como \u201cun estudiante brillante, su reputaci\u00f3n no fue dada s\u00f3lo por su gran capacidad, sino por su duro trabajo\u201d.\n\nDespu\u00e9s de su graduaci\u00f3n fue contratado por Hays como secretario personal y trabaj\u00f3 para la Grand Trunk haciendo recados entre las oficinas de Montreal y Ottawa. El Montreal Herald, un peri\u00f3dico canadiense, dijo sobre \u00e9l lo siguiente:\n\n\u201cMr. Payne ten\u00eda el don de hacer amigos sin ning\u00fan esfuerzo y atra\u00eda a todo aquel con quien entrara en contacto.\u201d\n\nA principios de 1.912 Vivian acompa\u00f1\u00f3 al matrimonio Hays y su familia a un viaje por Europa. El joven pisar\u00eda por primera vez Inglaterra y qued\u00f3 asombrado con los hermosos paisajes. Escribi\u00f3 entusiasmado a su madre una carta donde describ\u00eda con gran ilusi\u00f3n, lo incre\u00edble que le parec\u00eda que todo fuese verde en pleno marzo.\n\nPor lo poco que podemos extraer de su carta y lo que los que le conocieron dec\u00edan de \u00e9l, se puede deducir que Vivian viv\u00eda con ilusi\u00f3n cada momento, que era un gran trabajador y sobretodo, podemos destacar su alegr\u00eda.\n\nHays y su s\u00e9quito embarcaron al Titanic el mi\u00e9rcoles 10 de abril de 1.912 en el puerto de Southampton, Inglaterra. Lo hicieron como invitados del mism\u00edsimo Bruce Ismay, el presidente de la White Star Line, la compa\u00f1\u00eda naviera propietaria del buque.\n\nLa familia regresaba precipitadamente debido a las complicaciones del embarazo de una de las hijas de los Hays, Louise, que se presentaba con amenaza de ces\u00e1rea. De no haber sido as\u00ed, seguramente el viaje se hubiese alargado algunos d\u00edas m\u00e1s.\n\nLa partida ocup\u00f3 cuatro camarotes de primera clase, Charles y Clara Hays el B-69, la hija y el yerno de \u00e9stos, Orian y Thornton Davidson el B-71, la doncella de Clara, Mary Anne Perreault, el B-73 y el joven Vivian el B-24.\n\nEl camarote que utiliz\u00f3 Vivian Payne. Estaba situado en la cubierta B por el lado de babor por proa\n\nLa noche del 14 de abril de 1.912, a las 23,40 horas, el Titanic choca con un iceberg que le hiere de forma mortal. Probablemente la familia Hays, su doncella y el joven Payne subiesen presurosos a la cubierta de botes.\n\nClara, Orian y Anne embarcaron en uno de los primeros salvavidas, el 3, que dej\u00f3 el Titanic a alrededor de las 00,50-00,55 horas.

Hays\u2019s first plan for a western branch envisaged a line starting at Callander, Ontario and going west via Winnipeg and Edmonton following the original Sandford Fleming survey across the prairies. West from Edmonton, the line would use the Yellowhead Pass to reach the Pacific at Port Simpson.\n\nLaurier responded positively to this proposal since it gave him an opportunity to escape from an earlier commitment to support another railway to be built across the desolation of the Canadian Shield. The Trans-Canada Railway had been conceived by Colonel Church to serve the needs of the British Empire by linking its various parts in an All Red-Route. Despite its origins, support for this project had come from Quebec nationalists and the Roman Catholic Church who saw it as a way of settling the Canadian Shield and exploiting its mineral wealth.\n\nWhile supporting the Grand Trunk Railway in its efforts to extend its activities to the West, Laurier, having failed to insist on cooperation between the Canadian Northern and the Grand Trunk, countered with another proposal, that of constructing a \"National Transcontinental Railway.\" This new entity would consist of two divisions: the Western, from Winnipeg to the Pacific coast, would be built by the Grand Trunk Pacific, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Grand Trunk; and the Eastern, from Muncton to Winnipeg, would be built by the government (generally known as the National Transcontinental) and upon its completion would be leased to the Grand Trunk Pacific to operate. After a contentious debate in Parliament, the National Transcontinental Railway Act was proposed on September 2, 1903 and the Grand Trunk Pacific was incorporated on October 24, 1903. At the same time that the incorporation of the GTP was taking place in Ottawa, Hays was making contact with its potential supporters in the west. As a sample, the town council of Edmonton was approached by him for their support for the GTP, with the result that an agreement regarding terminal facilities was signed.\n\nThe GTP from Winnipeg to the Pacific Coast (Kaien Island, on which Prince Rupert was built was chosen as the terminus) was directed into two divisions--the Prairie from Winnipeg to Wolf Creek in Alberta, and the Mountain from Wolf Creek to the Coast.\n\nThe mainline was constructed to a high standard from the outset so that it would not be \"inferior to the main line of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada (parent company of the GTP) between Montreal and Toronto, so far as may be practicable in the case of a newly constructed line of railway.\" This required a well-constructed roadbed with grades not to exceed four-tenths of one percent, and curves to be four degrees or greater. To further enhance the standards of construction, the use of 85 pound rail to the yard on the prairies was mandated. But as Currie points out, \"the proposed standard of construction was suited to a busy railway in a thickly populated area...it was ill-fitted for a pioneer road on the sparsely settled Prairies: it was quite unrealistic for a railway through the mountains to the undeveloped port of Prince Rupert....\"\n\nThe first sod for the GTP was turned near Carberry, Manitoba on August 29, 1905 with steel reaching Edmonton in 1909, while the first train entered the city on August 13. Passenger service was inaugurated in 1910.\n\nAfter several surveys, GTP engineers had eliminated all but three possible passes--the Peace, Pine and Yellowhead, the latter being the most favoured. But the choice generated controversy with the Canadian Northern, which had a prior claim to that route, through its ownership of the charter of the Edmonton, Yukon and Pacific. However, the protests of the CNoR disallowing the use of the pass by the GTP were dismissed by the government, with the result that both companies ran their respective lines through it.\n\nTwo subsidiary companies of the GTP had an impact on the landscape of Alberta. In 1906 the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company and the Grand Trunk Pacific Town and Development Company were incorporated. The Branch Line Company built a line from Tofield to Calgary, and opened up the country for the exploration of coal reserves by building a line from Bickerduke to Lovett, an area which became known as the Coal Branch. Both were in operation by 1913. Lacking land grants the GTP, through the Town and Development Company, purchased land along the main line and developed \"towns in precise patterns, at a distance of not under seven miles or more than fifteen miles from each other.\"\n\nGeoffrey Taylor, writing about the building of the GTP states that technology \u201chad changed little in its essentials since Langdon and Shepard laid the roadbed for the Canadian Pacific in the 1880s... the pick and shovel gang, the horse and dump wagon, and the scraper were still the mainstay of the contractor.\u201d\n\nNotes | Bibliography | Abbreviations\n\nCanadian National Railways, Vol. 2, Towards the Inevitable 1896-1922\n\nA History of Transportation in Canada\n\nCanadian Railway Development\n\nCanadian National Railways, Vol. 2\n\nThe Grand Trunk Pacific Raiwlay of Canada\n\nCanadian National Railways, Vol. 2\n\nThe Asians Dreams\n\nCanadian National Railways, Vol. 2\n\nCanadian National Railways, Vol. 2\n\nThe Railway Contractors"}, {"url": "https://melville.ca/m/tourism-melville/charles-melville-hays", "page_content": "Melville as a Railway Hub\n\nCharles Melville Hays was born at Rock Island, Illinois, USA on May 16, 1856. At the age of 17, he began working for the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad in St. Louis, Missouri. He became a secretary to the general manager of the Missouri Pacific Railroad in 1878. After his time as a secretary he then was the General Manager for the Grand Trunk Railroad from 1896 \u2013 1909, where he became President until his death in 1912. He married Clara Jennings Gregg in 1881 and together had four daughters. They then moved to Melville in 1909 and started the construction of the railway between Regina and Melville. He was a major part in the building of the City Hall Opera House because he believed it would be a great way to represent the growing community.\n\nThe Naming of Melville\n\nAdditionally, due to his role in making Melville a hub in the railway, his middle name became the basis for which our city was named. According to records from the late J. W. Redgwick, who also played an important entrepreneurial role in early Melville, claimed that, \"there were several rumours about the name of the place - one name mentioned was Hayes, another Melhayes, and the name finally decided on by the Grant Trunk Pacific officials was the middle name of their president\". The name was officially introduced and used instead of 'Killaly', in 1908.\n\nThe End of the Legacy\n\nAt the age of 55, Charles was one of the 1,503 people who died on the RMS Titanic in 1912. His wife and daughters were able to make it off of the ship alive and came back to Melville to continue his legacy. Charles is buried at Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal."}, {"url": "https://www.titanic.memorial/post/memorial/charles+melville+hays+memorial+london/", "page_content": "The grief and sorrow which prevail throughout the civilized world as a sequence to the appalling disaster which befell the steamship Titanic are particularly profound and keenly emphasized in the minds and hearts of the Directors of the United States Mortgage and Trust Company, for among those lost was Charles Melville Hays, a member of this board since Aug. 31, 1905. ~ The New York Times, 28 April 1912\n\nLocated on the western wall of the interior of the Church of St Edmund the King in the City of London is a small brass plaque, behind glass, set into the dark, wooden panelling of the building. The memorial is dedicated one of the Titanic's first-class passengers, American Charles Melville Hays, who died in the sinking of the Titanic on 15 April 1912. Charles Melville Hays was a leading figure in the Canadian railway business and at the time of the sinking was President of the Grand Trunk Railway and the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. He died in the sinking and his body was recovered from the North Atlantic and repatriated for burial in Montreal.\n\nCharles Melville Hays was born in Rock Island, Illinois in 1856. In 1873, by the age of 17, he was working in the railway industry for the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad company. He rose through lower managerial ranks at a number of railway companies before becoming General Manager of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada in January 1896. In 1904 he was appointed President of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and later, by 1909, had succeeded to the presidency of the parent company, the Grand Trunk Railway.\n\nBiographies of Charles Melville Hays tell of his considerable business acumen but also of his ruthlessness in his business dealings. During his running of the Grand Trunk Railway he modernised and restructured the company, improving its efficiency and expanding the network, notably with the construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. However, he would not see its completion loosing his life in the sinking of the Titanic.\n\nThe memorial is in the form of a small brass plaque, set into a wooden panel within the church interior. The plaque has the following inscription:\n\nAMDG In memory of Charles Melville Hays. President of the Grand Trunk and Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Companies of Canada, who lost his life on April 15th 1912, by the foundering in mid-Atlantic, of the steamship \"Titanic\" through collision with an iceberg, while on her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York. A memorial service was held in this Church simultaneously with one at Montreal, on Thursday, April 25th 1912. This tablet with the kind permission of the Rector and Churchwardens was placed here by the Directors of the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada in recognition of Mr Hays great services to the company, and of his high character in public and private life.\n\nOn 25 April 1912 a memorial service for Charles Melville Hays was held in Montreal and at London's Church of St Edmund the King. At the same time operations on the Grand Trunk Railway paused for five minutes of remembrance. Following his death the directors of the Grand Trunk Railway commissioned a memorial plaque, which was installed in the Church of St Edmund the King in the City of London.\n\nMore information"}]}
