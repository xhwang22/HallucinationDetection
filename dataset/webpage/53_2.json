He opened his first shop in 1969, joining forces with the master cutter Edward Sexton, and backed by Cilla Black and the Beatles executive Peter Brown.\n\nThe shop attracted rock stars and aristocrats who wanted the mix of innovative styling and traditional made-to-measure tailoring. Huge lapels, velvet jackets with nipped-in waists, Oxford bags and mixed-up tweeds fast became his design signatures.\n\nHighlights from the exhibition, Tommy Nutter: Rebel on the Row, include four of Mick Jagger's suits \u2013 boyish-sized save for the shoulders \u2013 in shades of green and lemon. Elton John's stadium-ready two-tone dinner jackets are striking and tasteless in equal measure.\n\n\"Tommy completely glamorised Savile Row and made it accessible,\" said Elton John, who often visited the shop to be measured up while drinking a glass of sherry.\n\nIn the early 70s Nutter created suits for Bianca Jagger. \"Bianca really wanted a man's suit and not a suit cut for a woman,\" Everest said. \"She asked for the darts to be taken out of her first pistachio green suit to make it sexier.\"\n\nThe exhibition has recreated Nutter's shop, along with its innovative window displays featuring patchouli-soaked stuffed rats wearing diamond chokers, to demonstrate how pioneering his approach to brand image was at the time.\n\nThe tailor stopped working with Sexton at 35a Savile Row in 1976 but returned to the street some years later to set up business again, at No 19.

The family moved to Kilburn and Tommy and his brother David had a normal suburban childhood, punctuated by highly enjoyable holidays at Butlin's holiday camps. He attended the Willesden Technical College where, according to his brother, he studied plumbing.\n\nIn the early Sixties, Nutter obtained a position with Donaldson, Williams & Ward, traditional Savile Row tailors with premises in the Burlington Arcade. Here, starting as an apprentice, he absorbed the lore and the rules of the English gentleman's classical wardrobe. His seven years with the firm gave him a thoroughgoing knowledge of his craft, and a lifelong respect for its rules.\n\nIn 1968, Nutter left Donaldson Williams & Ward to found his own business, first at 35a Savile Row, later in its present handsome double-fronted premises at No 19. He was backed by clients including Cilla Black and her husband Bobby Willis, Peter Brown, then Managing Director of the Beatles' Apple Corps, also situated in Savile Row, and by the lawyer James Vallance-White.\n\nThe business was an immediate success for, like Sir Hardy Amies, a Savile Row dandy of a previous generation, Tommy Nutter produced lively, contemporary tailoring whose roots were deeply embedded in the craftsmanship and knowledge of Savile Row. Indeed, he made suits for Amies as well as for newer residents of Savile Row, and in particular the Beatles. He was proudest of the fact that, for the cover of the Beatles' album Abbey Road (1969), he dressed three out of the four (George Harrison elected to be photographed on the road-crossing in denims). Other leading dandies of the period were also his clients, including Sir Roy Strong (then Director of the National Portrait Gallery), Mick Jagger and Elton John.\n\nNutter also applied his craft to dressing female icons of swinging London society at the time, including Cilla Black, a close friend, and Bianca Jagger, who was much photographed at the time in a white dinner jacket with white satin facings. Nutter also made a red velvet suit for Twiggy which became a celebrated and much-copied look when she was photographed wearing it in the early Seventies.\n\nIn 1971 he was elected to the Best-Dressed List in the United States, along with the Earl of Snowdon and Hardy Amies. At the time, American Menswear magazine said of Nutter that he was 'tradition spiced with daring'.\n\n'He never got things wrong about clothes,' said the restaurateur and bookshop-owner Stuart Grimshaw, who was a client of Tommy Nutter's from the late Sixties. 'He really knew what he was talking about. One would go in and say, 'What do I wear to go on safari in Kenya?' and Tommy would make one an absolutely correct safari suit, a proper one with all the pockets in exactly the right place.\n\n'This knowledge extended to such minutiae as the correct wearing of half or full brogues or co-respondent shoes. He was an encyclopaedia of correct, classical male style.'\n\nClients from the hipper purlieus of the aristocracy, from the media, pop stars, and even aspiring teenage dandies from the East End whose ambition, in the early Seventies, was to own a Nutter suit, were drawn to Tommy Nutter not only because of his ineffable sense of style, but also because of his peculiarly ironic personality.\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber was a client and friend. 'He made me a lot of things when one was younger and trendier,' Lloyd Webber said. 'There was a wonderful maroon coat I remember I wore for Ascot - he was always such fun, very much part of my early life when Jesus Christ Superstar was going on - he made clothes for Tim Rice too - we were all great mates'.\n\nNutter was a gentle humorist who had a wide and interesting circle of friends attracted by his enthusiasm, by his gentle, self-mocking personality and his acerbic comments on the vagaries of others, always ending with the expression 'But who am I to talk?' He was a prodigious and witty correspondent and his letters to his many friends are treasured. In addition, he delighted in writing to the serious newspapers on topics as far-ranging as the correct buttoning of the suit on a statue of John F. Kennedy, to the scarcity of deckchairs in Green Park. He was always very ready to spring to the defence if his beloved Savile Row came under attack, as it so frequently did in the anarchic Sixties.\n\nNutter was also a firm believer in the supremacy of the English suit and of English cloth; during the Seventies and early Eighties he took part in huge international fashion shows put on by Reid & Taylor, the Scottish firm of woollen and worsted manufacturers.\n\nWith his untimely death, from complications arising from Aids, London society loses a witty and elegant dandy, whose hand-rolled lapels and insouciant manner masked a serious and continuing purpose; to make sure that the craft and traditions of Savile Row tailoring were preserved for, and valued by, his generation.\n\n(Photograph omitted)"}, {"url": "https://savilerow-style.com/news/tommy-nutter-rebel-cause/", "page_content": "Tommy Nutter, the tailor who ripped up the rules of Savile Row, is remembered in a new biography. Tom Corby reports\n\nJust over a quarter of a century after his untimely death from Aids, the avant-garde Tommy Nutter, like so many creatives of his generation, is still regarded as a legend, remembered as the tailor who single-handedly reconciled the traditions of Savile Row with the male peacock revolution of 1960s swinging London. His contribution to some of the most iconic styles and pop imagery of the 20th century has become part of the history of his trade as he wore down the division between tailoring and fashion. Friends say that a statue ought to be put up of him, like that of Beau Brummel, the archetypal dandy who, in the 18th century, set the bespoke style for generations.\n\nTommy spent his formative years in Edgware, north London, where his father owned a caf\u00e9, catering, in the main, to customers like truck drivers, gas fitters and builders. He was destined to be a plumber but, over the years, emerged as a blue collar boy made good in the class crucible of the 60s; a time when the alchemy of taste, cool, and sheer force of personality could transform lives in ways that would have seemed impossible in years gone by. Tommy, a 6ft 2 inches tall young man with matinee idol looks, arrived right on cue. It all started when, aged 19, he broke free from plumbing to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy. He then landed an apprenticeship with Donaldson, Williamson and Ward, traditional Savile Row tailors, with premises in Burlington Arcade. There, he absorbed the lore and the rules of the English gentlemen\u2019s classic wardrobe. His seven years with the firm gave him a thorough knowledge of his craft, and a lifelong respect for its hierarchy.\n\nIn 1969, Tommy founded his own business, joining up with Edward Sexton, a young cutter with brilliant technical skills. They were financially backed by Tommy\u2019s close friend, the singer Cilla Black, her husband Bobby Willis and others prepared to take a risk. The venture was an immediate success although a writer in the Daily Mirror snarked: \u201cThomas Nutter is opening what he calls a \u2018thoroughly square\u2019 tailoring shop \u2026 in Savile Row next week. Well that will make a change. I mean there can\u2019t be more than a dozen there now. Mr Nutter, who is 26, is weary of \u2018all those Carnaby Street gimmicks\u2019, and thinks that clothes, like hair, are settling down to something more sober \u2026 What, then, of rumours that Ringo Starr has ordered a pair of scarlet PVC trousers from Nutters?\u201d Tommy replied curtly: \u201cThey\u2019ll be very square scarlet PVC trousers.\u201d\n\nSavile Row, with its collection of Royal Warrants, had never seen anything like it when Nutters opened at No. 35a, the story of which has been brought back to life by Lance Richardson in his biography House of Nutter \u2013 The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row. A year on, the Daily Mail was declaring it \u201ca whizz bang success \u2013 the place for men\u2019s clothes\u201d, putting the charismatic Tommy in the class of actor Terence Stamp, photographer Brian Duffy, and hair dresser Vidal Sassoon, all the stylish young Londoners who had shot themselves into the new aristocracy. Clients came in from the hipper haunts of those named in Debrett\u2019s, from the media, pop stars and even aspiring teenage dandies from the East End, whose ambition was to own a Nutter suit, drawn to Tommy not only because of his matchless sense of style, but also because of his personality. He welcomed them all.\n\nLike Hardy Amies, a Savile Row dandy who dressed The Queen, Tommy produced lively, contemporary tailoring, but with roots deeply embedded in the craftsmanship of Savile Row. Amies named Tommy as \u201cthe most exciting tailor on Savile Row in decades.\u201d For three decades, Tommy kitted out the biggest stars on both sides of the Atlantic. He was proud of the fact that, for the cover of the Beatles\u2019 Abbey Road album, three of them wore Tommy Nutter bespoke. George Harrison chose\n\ndenim. Other leading dandies of the period were also his clients, including Sir Roy Strong, then director of the National Portrait Gallery, Mick Jagger and Elton John. Andrew Lloyd Webber was also a client as well as a friend. He has recalled: \u201cThere was a wonderful maroon coat I wore for Ascot \u2013 he was always such fun, very much part of my early life when Jesus Christ Superstar was going on \u2013 Tommy made clothes for Tim Rice too \u2013 we were all great mates.\u201d\n\nMick Jagger sported an eau-de-nil three-piece for his wedding to Bianca Perez-Mora Macias in 1971. He was in another Nutter creation days later on his honeymoon in Venice, fitted so snugly that it left no doubt as to which side he dressed. Celebrity nuptials became something of a thing for Tommy. John Lennon wore cream corduroy for his wedding to Yoko Ono on Gibraltar. For Elton John\u2019s marriage in 1984 Tommy made 20 suits, \u201ctwo of each, in case of mishap\u201d, as he later recalled, \u201cin a wide range of primary colours, including orange and very bright yellow. With each outfit went the appropriate straw boater.\u201d\n\nJohn Reid, Elton John\u2019s manager, has said: \u201cIt was quite an event going to Nutters. You\u2019d write the whole day off. Maybe you\u2019d have lunch and a couple of bottles of champagne.\u201d Tommy has said that when things became \u201cedgy\u201d with Elton he would send out for a bottle of sherry \u201cto smooth things along\u201d. For Elton\u2019s 36th birthday, Tommy made a suit overlaid with 1,009,444 bugle beads, each one painstakingly attached by hand. Tommy also applied his craft to dressing female icons of swinging London, like the red velvet suit for Twiggy which became a celebrated and much copied look when she was photographed wearing it in the early 70s.\n\nPeople were attracted to Tommy not only because of his ineffable sense of style, but because of his ironic personality. He was a humorist with a wide and interesting circle of friends who were attracted by his enthusiasm, his gentle self-mocking personality and his acerbic comments on the vagaries of others, always ending with the expression, \u201cBut who am I to talk?\u201d He was a witty correspondent and his letters to his friends are treasured. In addition, he delighted in writing to the serious newspapers on topics as far ranging as the correct buttoning of the suit on a statue of John F Kennedy, to the scarcity of deckchairs in London\u2019s Green Park.\n\nTommy died of Aids in August 1992, aged 49. \u201cThe saddest thing of all,\u201d he once wrote, \u201cis an in-between look.\u201d No-one could ever have accused him of that. At his memorial service in St George\u2019s, Hanover Square, just up the road from Savile Row, Cilla Black read an abridged excerpt from Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, relating the story of \u201cA true, a perfect gentle Knight \u2026 In dying in his excellence and flower, when he is certain of his high good name; for then he gives to friend, and self, no shame.\u201d\n\nThe final words should go to Nutters loyalist Elton John who said: \u201cTommy completely glamorised Savile Row and made it accessible.\u201d There\u2019s no arguing with that\u2026\n\nHouse of Nutter: The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row by Lance Richardson, published by Chatto & Windus. \u00a325"}, {"url": "https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/designers/tommy-nutter/", "page_content": "Tommy Nutter was a British tailor.\n\nTommy Nutter was born in 1943.\n\nIn his youth Nutter studied at the Tailor and Cutter Academy and worked for traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward.

After the family moved to Kilburn, Nutter and his brother David attended Willesden Technical College. Nutter initially studied plumbing, and then architecture, but he abandoned both aged 19 to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy.\n\nIn the early 1960s, he joined traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward.

They were financially backed by Cilla Black and her husband Bobby Willis, Managing Director of the Beatles' Apple Corps Peter Brown, and lawyer James Vallance-White.\n\nThe business was an immediate success, as Nutter combined traditional tailoring skills with innovative design. He designed for the Hardy Amies range, and then for the man himself. His clients included his investors, plus Sir Roy Strong, Mick Jagger, Bianca Jagger and Elton John.

Nutter went to work for Kilgour French and Stanbury, managing his own workroom. Sexton continued to run Nutters of Savile Row until 1983, when Nutter returned to the row with a ready to wear shop: \"Tommy Nutter, Savile Row\".

At this time, Sexton set up a business in his own name.\n\nIn the 1980s, he described his suits as a \"cross between the big-shouldered Miami Vice look and the authentic Savile Row.\" He created the clothing of The Joker worn by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film Batman.\n\nNutter died in 1992 at the Cromwell Hospital in London of complications from AIDS.

Hardy Amies\n\nTommy Nutter outside his Saville Row shop.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBorn in 1943 in Barmouth, Meirionnydd, Wales, Tommy Nutter was one of the most prolific tailors of London\u2019s Savile Row. Famous for reinventing the Saville Row suit in the 1960s. Raised by his parents Christopher and Dorothy in Edgware, Middlesex, his father ran a local cafe in the high street. The family would later move to neighbouring Kilburn. Tommy initially trained as a plumber but this career dream aside when he was 19, discovered his true passion for tailoring. A love that would cause him to go on to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy.\n\nCut from the Right Cloth\n\nTommy Nutter joined the tailors Donaldson, Williamson and Ward in the early 1960s and after seven years branched out on a joint venture with Edward Sexton to open the tailor\u2019s Nutters of Saville Row at 35a. Financially backed by Cilla Black, her husband Bobby and the lawyer James Vallance-White, the business became an overnight success. Designing outfits for the likes of Mick Jagger, Sir Elton John and George Harrison\u2019s outfit on the cover of the Abbey Road album along with three of the other Beatles in his suits.\n\nA dip in demand in the 1970s, led to Nutter diversifying to ready-to-wear clothing for Austin Reed and growing the Saville Row brand in East Asia and Japan. The Nutters brand continued until 1983 with a number of snooker players such as Jimmy White taking a keen interest in their unique brand of tailoring and design. In the 1980s, their tailoring was a cross between the big-shouldered look of Miami Vice and the traditional Saville Row look. Even Kirk Stevens\u2019s classic white suit from the 1984 Masters was straight off their tailor\u2019s dummy and Jack Nicholson\u2019s role as the Joker in the 1989 film Batman was created by Tommy Nutter.\n\nThe Brand\n\nThe Tommy Nutter brand continues to this day despite losing its creator to complications caused by the cruel disease AIDS in 1992 aged just 49. J&J Crombie now owns the brand. Nutter will be remembered for being the tailor who ripped up the rules of Savile Row and incorporated the vibe of the Swinging Sixties into his clothes. He was the archetypal dandy who attracted Terence Stamp, and Vidal Sassoon to his shop and even the teenage dandies of the East End aspired to own one of his suits. This was a welcoming and inclusive brand that was owned by a humorist and someone who had an ironic personality Elton John once said of Tommy:\n\n\u201cTommy completely glamorised Savile Row and made it accessible.\u201d There\u2019s no arguing with that\u2026\u201d Elton John\n\nTommy Nutter is pictured with his dogs.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b9ac9bc2-4197-11e8-97ce-ea0c2bf34a0b", "page_content": "What is included in my trial?\n\nDuring your trial you will have complete digital access to FT.com with everything in both of our Standard Digital and Premium Digital packages.\n\nStandard Digital includes access to a wealth of global news, analysis and expert opinion.

After seven years, in 1969, he joined up with Edward Sexton, to open Nutters of Savile Row at Number 35a Savile Row. The business was an immediate success, as Nutter combined traditional tailoring skills with innovative design. He designed for the Hardy Amies range, and then for the man himself. His clients included his investors, plus Sir Roy Strong, Mick Jagger, Bianca Jagger and Elton John. Nutter himself was most proud of the fact that, for the cover of The Beatles\" album Abbey Road in 1969, he dressed three out of the four: George Harrison elected to be photographed on the road-crossing in denims. In the 1970s his bespoke business became less successful, but he branched out into ready to wear clothing, marketed through Austin Reed. He also successfully expanded into East Asia, establishing the Savile Row brand in Japan. In 1976 Sexton bought Nutter out of the Business. Nutter went to work for Kilgour French and Stanbury, managing his own workroom. Sexton continued to run Nutters of Savile Row until 1983, when Nutter returned to the row with a ready to wear shop: \"Tommy Nutter, Savile Row\". (This new venture, which traded at Number 19 Savile Row until Tommy\"s death, was backed by J&J Crombie Limited, who continue to own the \"Tommy Nutter\" trademark) At this time, Sexton set up a business in his own name. In the 1980s, he described his suits as a \"cross between the big-shouldered Miami Vice look and the authentic Savile Row.\" He created the clothing of The Joker worn by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film Batman.

He opened his first shop in 1969, joining forces with the master cutter Edward Sexton, and backed by Cilla Black and the Beatles executive Peter Brown.\n\nThe shop attracted rock stars and aristocrats who wanted the mix of innovative styling and traditional made-to-measure tailoring. Huge lapels, velvet jackets with nipped-in waists, Oxford bags and mixed-up tweeds fast became his design signatures.\n\nHighlights from the exhibition, Tommy Nutter: Rebel on the Row, include four of Mick Jagger's suits \u2013 boyish-sized save for the shoulders \u2013 in shades of green and lemon. Elton John's stadium-ready two-tone dinner jackets are striking and tasteless in equal measure.\n\n\"Tommy completely glamorised Savile Row and made it accessible,\" said Elton John, who often visited the shop to be measured up while drinking a glass of sherry.\n\nIn the early 70s Nutter created suits for Bianca Jagger. \"Bianca really wanted a man's suit and not a suit cut for a woman,\" Everest said. \"She asked for the darts to be taken out of her first pistachio green suit to make it sexier.\"\n\nThe exhibition has recreated Nutter's shop, along with its innovative window displays featuring patchouli-soaked stuffed rats wearing diamond chokers, to demonstrate how pioneering his approach to brand image was at the time.\n\nThe tailor stopped working with Sexton at 35a Savile Row in 1976 but returned to the street some years later to set up business again, at No 19. He died aged 49 in 1992."}, {"url": "https://savilerow-style.com/news/tommy-nutter-rebel-cause/", "page_content": "Tommy Nutter, the tailor who ripped up the rules of Savile Row, is remembered in a new biography. Tom Corby reports\n\nJust over a quarter of a century after his untimely death from Aids, the avant-garde Tommy Nutter, like so many creatives of his generation, is still regarded as a legend, remembered as the tailor who single-handedly reconciled the traditions of Savile Row with the male peacock revolution of 1960s swinging London. His contribution to some of the most iconic styles and pop imagery of the 20th century has become part of the history of his trade as he wore down the division between tailoring and fashion. Friends say that a statue ought to be put up of him, like that of Beau Brummel, the archetypal dandy who, in the 18th century, set the bespoke style for generations.\n\nTommy spent his formative years in Edgware, north London, where his father owned a caf\u00e9, catering, in the main, to customers like truck drivers, gas fitters and builders. He was destined to be a plumber but, over the years, emerged as a blue collar boy made good in the class crucible of the 60s; a time when the alchemy of taste, cool, and sheer force of personality could transform lives in ways that would have seemed impossible in years gone by. Tommy, a 6ft 2 inches tall young man with matinee idol looks, arrived right on cue. It all started when, aged 19, he broke free from plumbing to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy. He then landed an apprenticeship with Donaldson, Williamson and Ward, traditional Savile Row tailors, with premises in Burlington Arcade. There, he absorbed the lore and the rules of the English gentlemen\u2019s classic wardrobe. His seven years with the firm gave him a thorough knowledge of his craft, and a lifelong respect for its hierarchy.\n\nIn 1969, Tommy founded his own business, joining up with Edward Sexton, a young cutter with brilliant technical skills. They were financially backed by Tommy\u2019s close friend, the singer Cilla Black, her husband Bobby Willis and others prepared to take a risk. The venture was an immediate success although a writer in the Daily Mirror snarked: \u201cThomas Nutter is opening what he calls a \u2018thoroughly square\u2019 tailoring shop \u2026 in Savile Row next week. Well that will make a change. I mean there can\u2019t be more than a dozen there now. Mr Nutter, who is 26, is weary of \u2018all those Carnaby Street gimmicks\u2019, and thinks that clothes, like hair, are settling down to something more sober \u2026 What, then, of rumours that Ringo Starr has ordered a pair of scarlet PVC trousers from Nutters?\u201d Tommy replied curtly: \u201cThey\u2019ll be very square scarlet PVC trousers.\u201d\n\nSavile Row, with its collection of Royal Warrants, had never seen anything like it when Nutters opened at No. 35a, the story of which has been brought back to life by Lance Richardson in his biography House of Nutter \u2013 The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row. A year on, the Daily Mail was declaring it \u201ca whizz bang success \u2013 the place for men\u2019s clothes\u201d, putting the charismatic Tommy in the class of actor Terence Stamp, photographer Brian Duffy, and hair dresser Vidal Sassoon, all the stylish young Londoners who had shot themselves into the new aristocracy. Clients came in from the hipper haunts of those named in Debrett\u2019s, from the media, pop stars and even aspiring teenage dandies from the East End, whose ambition was to own a Nutter suit, drawn to Tommy not only because of his matchless sense of style, but also because of his personality. He welcomed them all.\n\nLike Hardy Amies, a Savile Row dandy who dressed The Queen, Tommy produced lively, contemporary tailoring, but with roots deeply embedded in the craftsmanship of Savile Row. Amies named Tommy as \u201cthe most exciting tailor on Savile Row in decades.\u201d For three decades, Tommy kitted out the biggest stars on both sides of the Atlantic. He was proud of the fact that, for the cover of the Beatles\u2019 Abbey Road album, three of them wore Tommy Nutter bespoke. George Harrison chose\n\ndenim. Other leading dandies of the period were also his clients, including Sir Roy Strong, then director of the National Portrait Gallery, Mick Jagger and Elton John. Andrew Lloyd Webber was also a client as well as a friend. He has recalled: \u201cThere was a wonderful maroon coat I wore for Ascot \u2013 he was always such fun, very much part of my early life when Jesus Christ Superstar was going on \u2013 Tommy made clothes for Tim Rice too \u2013 we were all great mates.\u201d\n\nMick Jagger sported an eau-de-nil three-piece for his wedding to Bianca Perez-Mora Macias in 1971. He was in another Nutter creation days later on his honeymoon in Venice, fitted so snugly that it left no doubt as to which side he dressed. Celebrity nuptials became something of a thing for Tommy. John Lennon wore cream corduroy for his wedding to Yoko Ono on Gibraltar. For Elton John\u2019s marriage in 1984 Tommy made 20 suits, \u201ctwo of each, in case of mishap\u201d, as he later recalled, \u201cin a wide range of primary colours, including orange and very bright yellow. With each outfit went the appropriate straw boater.\u201d\n\nJohn Reid, Elton John\u2019s manager, has said: \u201cIt was quite an event going to Nutters. You\u2019d write the whole day off. Maybe you\u2019d have lunch and a couple of bottles of champagne.\u201d Tommy has said that when things became \u201cedgy\u201d with Elton he would send out for a bottle of sherry \u201cto smooth things along\u201d. For Elton\u2019s 36th birthday, Tommy made a suit overlaid with 1,009,444 bugle beads, each one painstakingly attached by hand. Tommy also applied his craft to dressing female icons of swinging London, like the red velvet suit for Twiggy which became a celebrated and much copied look when she was photographed wearing it in the early 70s.\n\nPeople were attracted to Tommy not only because of his ineffable sense of style, but because of his ironic personality. He was a humorist with a wide and interesting circle of friends who were attracted by his enthusiasm, his gentle self-mocking personality and his acerbic comments on the vagaries of others, always ending with the expression, \u201cBut who am I to talk?\u201d He was a witty correspondent and his letters to his friends are treasured. In addition, he delighted in writing to the serious newspapers on topics as far ranging as the correct buttoning of the suit on a statue of John F Kennedy, to the scarcity of deckchairs in London\u2019s Green Park.\n\nTommy died of Aids in August 1992, aged 49. \u201cThe saddest thing of all,\u201d he once wrote, \u201cis an in-between look.\u201d No-one could ever have accused him of that. At his memorial service in St George\u2019s, Hanover Square, just up the road from Savile Row, Cilla Black read an abridged excerpt from Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, relating the story of \u201cA true, a perfect gentle Knight \u2026 In dying in his excellence and flower, when he is certain of his high good name; for then he gives to friend, and self, no shame.\u201d\n\nThe final words should go to Nutters loyalist Elton John who said: \u201cTommy completely glamorised Savile Row and made it accessible.\u201d There\u2019s no arguing with that\u2026\n\nHouse of Nutter: The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row by Lance Richardson, published by Chatto & Windus. \u00a325"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/92110/tommy-nutter-the-rebel-tailor-of-savile-row", "page_content": "They say that writing is a solitary pursuit, and no doubt Lance Richardson had anticipated a more sequestered existence while researching the life of Tommy Nutter for his new book, House Of Nutter: The Rebel Tailor Of Savile Row. But what began as a straightforward biography about the audacious designer, who died in 1992, developed into a story that reads more like a work of fiction, pieced together by the personal accounts of more than 70 people, among them The Beatles\u2019 business manager Peter Brown and the venerable lyricist Sir Tim Rice.\n\nThe research process also led the author to forge an unlikely friendship with Tommy\u2019s 81-year-old photographer brother, David Nutter, who unwittingly became the second protagonist in this tale of two siblings who burned bright through tumultuous shifts in social history, from the idealism of the Swinging \u201960s to the heartbreak of the Aids crisis in the 80s.\n\nLegends were made in the 60s, and Tommy and David were at the epicentre of this very real sturm und drang \u2013 freedom of expression, sexual liberation and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll orchestrated by a generation thirsty for disruption. Tommy is credited with having single-handedly changed the face of Savile Row in that decade by reconciling long-held traditions in tailoring with London\u2019s \u2018Peacock Revolution\u2019.\n\n\u201cSimply put, Tommy united tailoring and fashion,\u201d says Richardson. \u201cSavile Row was this bastion of tradition where clothes were exquisitely made, flawless. But these tailors were scared of change, and they became calcified. With the youthquake of the \u201960s you had this enormous groundswell of creativity, but a lot of these new clothes weren\u2019t well made. A few people started to marry quality with fashion, like Mr Fish, but Tommy combined these two things in the heart of the old establishment.\n\nThis was in no small part thanks to his head cutter Edward Sexton, who was, and still is, a master technician. Today, if you see Nutter suits from that era, they are still so radical, so exquisitely made.\u201d\n\nTommy Nutter circa 1974-1975 on Central Park West, New York, by David Nutter\n\nTommy Nutter famously dressed three of The Beatles for the cover of the album Abbey Road and was responsible for the white suit that John Lennon wore for his wedding to Yoko Ono.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThomas Albert Nutter, tailor, born Barmouth Merioneth 17 April 1943, died London 17 August 1992.\n\nTOMMY NUTTER, the avant-garde Savile Row tailor, came to prominence in the late Sixties as a man who singlehandedly reconciled the traditions of Savile Row, laid down in the late 19th century, with the male peacock revolution of the Sixties and the often extravagant demands of his clients, the leading dandies of swinging London.\n\nBorn in Wales in 1943, Nutter spent his formative years in Edgware, north London, where his father was proprietor of a cafe catering to a clientele composed of truckdrivers, gas-fitters and builders. The family moved to Kilburn and Tommy and his brother David had a normal suburban childhood, punctuated by highly enjoyable holidays at Butlin's holiday camps. He attended the Willesden Technical College where, according to his brother, he studied plumbing.\n\nIn the early Sixties, Nutter obtained a position with Donaldson, Williams & Ward, traditional Savile Row tailors with premises in the Burlington Arcade. Here, starting as an apprentice, he absorbed the lore and the rules of the English gentleman's classical wardrobe. His seven years with the firm gave him a thoroughgoing knowledge of his craft, and a lifelong respect for its rules.\n\nIn 1968, Nutter left Donaldson Williams & Ward to found his own business, first at 35a Savile Row, later in its present handsome double-fronted premises at No 19. He was backed by clients including Cilla Black and her husband Bobby Willis, Peter Brown, then Managing Director of the Beatles' Apple Corps, also situated in Savile Row, and by the lawyer James Vallance-White.\n\nThe business was an immediate success for, like Sir Hardy Amies, a Savile Row dandy of a previous generation, Tommy Nutter produced lively, contemporary tailoring whose roots were deeply embedded in the craftsmanship and knowledge of Savile Row. Indeed, he made suits for Amies as well as for newer residents of Savile Row, and in particular the Beatles. He was proudest of the fact that, for the cover of the Beatles' album Abbey Road (1969), he dressed three out of the four (George Harrison elected to be photographed on the road-crossing in denims). Other leading dandies of the period were also his clients, including Sir Roy Strong (then Director of the National Portrait Gallery), Mick Jagger and Elton John.\n\nNutter also applied his craft to dressing female icons of swinging London society at the time, including Cilla Black, a close friend, and Bianca Jagger, who was much photographed at the time in a white dinner jacket with white satin facings. Nutter also made a red velvet suit for Twiggy which became a celebrated and much-copied look when she was photographed wearing it in the early Seventies.\n\nIn 1971 he was elected to the Best-Dressed List in the United States, along with the Earl of Snowdon and Hardy Amies. At the time, American Menswear magazine said of Nutter that he was 'tradition spiced with daring'.\n\n'He never got things wrong about clothes,' said the restaurateur and bookshop-owner Stuart Grimshaw, who was a client of Tommy Nutter's from the late Sixties. 'He really knew what he was talking about. One would go in and say, 'What do I wear to go on safari in Kenya?' and Tommy would make one an absolutely correct safari suit, a proper one with all the pockets in exactly the right place.\n\n'This knowledge extended to such minutiae as the correct wearing of half or full brogues or co-respondent shoes. He was an encyclopaedia of correct, classical male style.'\n\nClients from the hipper purlieus of the aristocracy, from the media, pop stars, and even aspiring teenage dandies from the East End whose ambition, in the early Seventies, was to own a Nutter suit, were drawn to Tommy Nutter not only because of his ineffable sense of style, but also because of his peculiarly ironic personality.\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber was a client and friend. 'He made me a lot of things when one was younger and trendier,' Lloyd Webber said. 'There was a wonderful maroon coat I remember I wore for Ascot - he was always such fun, very much part of my early life when Jesus Christ Superstar was going on - he made clothes for Tim Rice too - we were all great mates'.\n\nNutter was a gentle humorist who had a wide and interesting circle of friends attracted by his enthusiasm, by his gentle, self-mocking personality and his acerbic comments on the vagaries of others, always ending with the expression 'But who am I to talk?' He was a prodigious and witty correspondent and his letters to his many friends are treasured. In addition, he delighted in writing to the serious newspapers on topics as far-ranging as the correct buttoning of the suit on a statue of John F. Kennedy, to the scarcity of deckchairs in Green Park. He was always very ready to spring to the defence if his beloved Savile Row came under attack, as it so frequently did in the anarchic Sixties.\n\nNutter was also a firm believer in the supremacy of the English suit and of English cloth; during the Seventies and early Eighties he took part in huge international fashion shows put on by Reid & Taylor, the Scottish firm of woollen and worsted manufacturers.\n\nWith his untimely death, from complications arising from Aids, London society loses a witty and elegant dandy, whose hand-rolled lapels and insouciant manner masked a serious and continuing purpose; to make sure that the craft and traditions of Savile Row tailoring were preserved for, and valued by, his generation.\n\n(Photograph omitted)"}, {"url": "https://www.mrporter.com/en-us/journal/fashion/meet-the-tailor-who-dressed-the-rolling-stones-538574", "page_content": "A new book by Mr Lance Richardson explores the life and times of rebel Savile Row tailor Mr Tommy Nutter.\n\nHouse Of Nutter by Mr Lance Richardson tells the story of Mr Tommy Nutter, the Savile Row tailor whose work in the 1970s and 1980s changed the way men dress. Mr Nutter used the language of tailoring to express new ideas and his outrageous designs are iconic. When The Beatles were photographed crossing Abbey Road in London for the 1969 album of the same name, three of them were wearing Tommy Nutter suits. When Mr John Lennon married Ms Yoko Ono, he wore a cream-coloured Tommy Nutter corduroy jacket. And when Sir Mick Jagger married Ms Bianca Mac\u00edas in 1971, they both wore clothes made by Mr Nutter. At a time of societal upheaval, Mr Nutter created counter-cultural tailoring.\n\nHis genius seems to have appeared almost fully formed. Born during WWII and brought up in an unremarkable corner of northwest London, Mr Nutter and his older brother, Mr David Nutter, a successful rock photographer and a big part of the book, felt early on that they were destined for a more artistic life. Denied an art school education by his unimaginative father, Mr Nutter\u2019s first job was as a tea boy in the civil service. However, he quickly switched to working at Donaldson, Williams & G Ward, a London tailoring house where he admired the craft, but not the conservatism, of Savile Row.\n\nThe young Mr Nutter was still at Donaldson, Williams & G Ward when he met Mr Edward Sexton, a young pattern cutter who could bring Mr Nutter\u2019s flamboyant designs to life. The pair were encouraged by the popular new appetite for fashion in the late 1960s, as demonstrated by the successful boutiques in Soho, many of which were run by Mr John Stephen, a Glaswegian who came to be known as The King of Carnaby Street because of the string of shops he owned on the thoroughfare. With culturally influential backers in the form of Mr Peter Brown, a member of The Beatles management team, and singer Ms Cilla Black, Mr Nutter and Mr Sexton opened Nutters of Savile Row in 1969. Sir Paul McCartney was at the opening party and the client list quickly grew to include Mr Eric Clapton, Mr Peter Sellers, The Duke of Bedford, Mr David Hockney, Sir Elton John and Prince Rajsinh Rajpipla, the son of an Indian maharaja."}, {"url": "https://edinburghtailoringcompany.com/2023/05/29/who-are-tommy-nutter-and-edward-sexton-and-why-are-they-important/", "page_content": "Edward Sexton and Tommy Nutter are two of the most iconic names in Savile Row tailoring. Renowned for their creativity and skill, these two men were instrumental in revolutionizing the way men dress. Their partnership was known as the \u201cDynamic Duo of Savile Row\u201d, and they left an indelible mark on the fashion world. Through their dedication to fine craftsmanship and eye for detail, Edward Sexton and Tommy Nutter made Savile Row an international hub of bespoke tailoring.\n\nEdward Sexton \u2013 The Rebel Tailor\n\nEdward Sexton is a world-renowned tailor who has made a name for himself by breaking all the rules. His style is modern and sleek, while still maintaining the traditional look of a Savile Row suit. Sexton is the go-to tailor for many celebrities and has even made suits for the likes of Prince Charles and David Beckham.\n\nDespite his rebel status, Sexton is a true craftsman who takes great pride in his work. He is always pushing himself to create the perfect suit and strives to make each one better than the last. Sexton\u2019s style is all about bespoke, handmade garments that are designed to fit the individual wearer perfectly. He is also known for his use of bold and unconventional fabrics, which has helped him to create some truly unique looks.\n\nHe\u2019s worked with some of the biggest names in the music and fashion industry, and his suits are loved for their sharp lines and slim fits. He is known for his impeccable craftsmanship and attention to detail. His work has been featured in many major publications, including Vogue, Harper\u2019s Bazaar, and Esquire. He has also been featured on television shows such as BBC\u2019s The Clothes Show and Channel 4\u2019s How to Look Good Naked.\n\nSexton\u2019s work is truly remarkable, and he is considered to be one of the best tailors in the world. If you are looking for a tailor who can help you to create a truly individual look, then Edward Sexton is the man for you.\n\nTommy Nutter \u2013 The Rockstar Tailor\n\nTommy Nutter was nothing short of a rockstar tailor. He was the son of a Chinese laundryman who arrived in London in the 1950s and found work as a tailor\u2019s apprentice. Nutter quickly rose through the ranks and became one of the most sought-after bespoke tailors in London. His clients included everyone from the Rolling Stones and the Beatles to the royal family.\n\nNutter was known for his flamboyant style and his willingness to take risks. He was the first tailor to put his name on the label of his suits, and he was also the first to use unusual materials like leather and denim. His bold style helped to redefine menswear in the 1960s and 1970s, and his influence can still be seen today.\n\nHe was the youngest of three brothers and began his career working in his father\u2019s tailor shop. In 1966, Nutter moved to New York City and began working as a personal assistant to the Hollywood film producer David O. Selznick. After a few years in New York, Nutter returned to London and opened his own tailor shop on Savile Row. He quickly gained a reputation for his unique style and became known as the \u201cRockstar tailor.\u201d Nutter\u2019s clients included some of the biggest names in the music and fashion industries, such as The Beatles, Mick Jagger, and Twiggy.\n\nNutter\u2019s career came to an abrupt end in 1992 when he died of a heart attack at the age of 49. However, his legacy lives on through his masterpieces.\n\nHow these two came together\n\nWhen two of the most renowned tailors in the world come together, the result is bound to be special. In 1969, two young tailors from Savile Row, Tommy Nutter, and Edward Sexton, joined forces to open a bespoke tailoring business on London\u2019s iconic Bruton Street. Their goal was to create the best tailor-made suits in the world, and they quickly became known for their exceptional craftsmanship and attention to detail.\n\nNutter, who was previously employed by the world-famous Savile Row tailor house Hardy Amies, brought his expert eye for detail and an appreciation for traditional craftsmanship to the partnership. Sexton, on the other hand, was known for his more modern approach to tailoring, which included shorter jacket lengths and bolder colour choices. The combination of Nutter and Sexton\u2019s talents resulted in some of the most iconic looks of the late 20th century. They were responsible for dressing some of the most famous names in the world, including the Beatles.\n\nNutter and Sexton\u2019s designs were sharp and modern, yet still classic and timeless. They were the perfect combination of form and function, and they quickly became the go-to tailors for some of the most famous names in the world. From the Rolling Stones to the Beatles, everyone who was anyone wanted a Nutter or Sexton suit.\n\nNutter and Sexton worked together for over a decade, creating some of the most iconic suits of the 1970s. Sadly, their partnership came to an end in 1980, when Nutter passed away. However, their legacy lives on, and their work continues to inspire fellow tailors and fashion lovers alike, including yours truly here at Edinburgh Tailoring Company.\n\nTheir Legacy and Influence on Fashion\n\nTommy Nutter and Edward Sexton were two of the most influential figures in the world of fashion in the 20th century. As Savile Row tailors, they revolutionized the way men dressed, and their influence can still be seen today. Tommy Nutter was known for his sharp, clean-cut suits, while Edward Sexton was known for his more reckless and experimental style. They were responsible for modernizing the look of Savile Row and helping to make it the world-renowned destination for bespoke menswear that it is today. While their style was very different from one another, both Nutter and Sexton had a profound impact on fashion. Their work helped to make Savile Row the go-to place for stylish and well-made clothing.\n\nBoth men left a lasting legacy in the world of fashion, and their influence can still be seen today. If you\u2019re a fan of Savile Row tailoring, then you owe a debt of gratitude to Tommy Nutter and Edward Sexton.\n\nHow do I get the look?\n\nSavile Row tailors Tommy Nutter and Edward Sexton revolutionized menswear in the 1960s and 1970s. By breaking away from the stuffy constrictions of traditional British tailoring, they created a new look that was fresh, modern, and stylish. Today, their legacy continues to inspire new generations of designers. Here at Edinburgh Tailoring Company, we often receive commissions from clients for tailoring with a difference.

Though most people knew him as the \"Tailor to the Stars\" -- the bon vivant Savile Row designer who dressed everyone from the Beatles and Elton John to Diana Ross and Twiggy -- his private life was where the most interesting things happened. From underground London clubs in the 1960s, before it was even legal to be gay, to the infamous bathhouses -- and trucks -- of hedonistic Manhattan at the height of the sexual '70s, Nutter was there, both witness and participant. His own biography is also, in miniature, the biography of gay life over the second half of the 20th century -- flagrantly joyful, traumatically brutal. In House of Nutter: The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row, Lance Richardson charts the story of one of fashion's most intriguing figures, including the AIDS diagnosis that would bring his life to an untimely end.\n\nThe crowd convened in Fulham's Eel Brook Common, opposite John Galliano's design studio. It was a brisk, blustery Sunday morning in April 1989. Clouds threatened rain with enough conviction that some people had brought their raincoats, though others were committed to their tutus and fairy wings, to showing off rainbow patch pants, Comme des Garcons jackets, antique neck scarves, and brown suede brogues. Roger Dack, the director of Fashion Acts, which had organized the event in London, strolled across the grass with a megaphone rallying his troops. Later, he would describe it as \"the most chic walk ever.\"\n\nMore than 900 marchers had turned up, pledging some PS90,000. The official route threaded up the King's Road, through Knightsbridge and Westminster, all the way over to Covent Garden, where the finish line was a Champagne reception at Tuttons restaurant. Bruce Oldfield stood at the front of the procession, itching to go; Galliano, lingering behind a battalion of strollers, brought up the rear.\n\nBut first, before anyone could take a single step forward, 1,116 red balloons were released into the sky: one for every person in the country who had died from AIDS-related causes.\n\nEarly in the epidemic, AIDS had been dismissed by some members of the British public as \"an American problem\" that would never creep its way across the Atlantic. Of course, it had already arrived; in 1982, a man named Terrence Higgins had collapsed on the dance floor at Heaven and died a few months later from Pneumocystis pneumonia. \"I hope you get very scared today because there is a locomotive coming down the track and it is leaving the United States,\" Mel Rosen, an American AIDS activist, had warned at a conference in London the following year. By late 1985, there were 241 cases of AIDS in Britain, and newspapers were reporting instances of \"scared\" firemen and paramedics who were refusing to perform the \"kiss of life,\" lest they get infected. In 1987, as conservatives talked seriously about compulsory testing of all gay men and possibly even mass quarantine, the science correspondent of the London Times wrote that \"leading specialists believe... between 40,000 and\n\n100,000 people in Britain are now carriers.\"\n\nAs the red balloons drifted into the sky above Fulham, Tommy Nutter took swigs from a hip flask to fortify himself for the long march to Covent Garden.\n\nThe first black spot had appeared on his own leg toward the end of the 1980s: small, dark, refusing to heal.\n\nStewart Grimshaw, one of Tommy's close friends, first noticed it when they were summering together in Saint-Tropez. Others noticed because Tommy drew their attention to it, making light of what the mark could possibly signify. When Carol Drinkwater read an article describing Kaposi's sarcoma lesions, the reddish-purple patches often associated with AIDS, she asked Tommy if he had anything like that. He replied, \"Yeah, yeah,\" indicated his leg, and shrugged away the question. But then the spot got worse, his health took a turn, and ignoring it became impossible.\n\nMany of the gay men Tommy knew went to St. Mary's Hospital, in Paddington, to be screened for sexually transmitted diseases. But Tommy refused; he hated being seen in that environment. Instead, he went to see Stewart, who, Tommy knew, had been actively involved in AIDS awareness since the days it was known as the dreaded \"gay cancer.\" As Stewart recalls, \"He came to me because he had loads of questions, and he thought I'd have all the answers.\"\n\nFor example: How many people get over it?\n\nStewart told him that nobody \"got over it.\"\n\nAnd how long before...?\n\nThat depends on your T-cell count, Stewart said.\n\nAfter Tommy exhausted his inquiry, Stewart convinced him to follow up with a brilliant clinician named Brian Gazzard. Having encountered his first case of what became identified as AIDS back in 1979, Gazzard was one of the leading medical authorities in Britain. He'd already seen hundreds of HIV-positive patients by the mid-1980s, and more recently, he'd been instrumental in setting up the Kobler Centre, a dedicated HIV/AIDS research and outpatient facility funded by a combination of private donations and money from the National Health Service. (Princess Diana opened the day-care wing during a well-publicized visit in 1988; it had been packed with patients ever since.) The Kobler saw \"a never-ending procession,\" Gazzard recalls, and the atmosphere was both depressing -- with up to 10 deaths a week -- and inspiring, because \"people were full of courage and determination.\"\n\nTommy made an appointment to see Dr. Gazzard, but he didn't want to go alone. He asked Stewart to keep him company.\n\nThe doctor sat them down in a quiet office. He told them that some people wanted to hear all the details, while others didn't want to hear any of the details.\n\nTommy said, \"Tell me everything.\"\n\n\"But that's not really what he wanted,\" Stewart recalls.\n\nWhat Tommy would have been told is something like this: That there is no easy way to break bad news. That, according to his test results, he was HIV-positive, with a very low CD4 cell count. That he already had opportunistic infections, and there was a good chance he would contract even more. That the treatments available to him were limited -- AZT, perhaps, though its effectiveness at prolonging life was finite and accompanied by side effects. That most types of treatment would focus on infections rather than the virus itself, which could not be cured. That there would be ways forward, however, to remain in control of the situation. Because that was the most frightening thing for patients newly cognizant of their status: the prospect of losing control.\n\nStewart listened carefully and understood exactly what was going to happen to his friend.\n\nTommy also listened, silent until the doctor finished and asked him if there was anything further he wanted to know.\n\nTommy thought for a moment. Then, Stewart remembers, he said, \"Yes, there is one thing I'd like to know. I'd like to know when Mack and Mabel is opening in the West End.\"\n\nMack and Mabel was an American musical by Michael Stewart and Jerry Herman that had premiered on Broadway in 1974, but thus far failed to transfer to London, except for a one-off charity performance at Drury Lane, in 1988. It told the tragic \"true\" (heavily fictionalized) story of Mabel Normand, a working-class girl who became a glamorous star of silent cinema before sliding into scandal and ultimately dying from pulmonary tuberculosis at the premature age of 37. Tommy had acquired a cast recording, and declared to several friends that it was his new favorite show.\n\nThe doctor stared at Tommy.\n\n\"I truly think he thought that Tommy already had dementia,\" Stewart recalls.\n\nWhen Tommy arrived home that evening, he telephoned Carol Drinkwater, whom he'd known since they met at a nightclub called La Douce in the early 1960s.\n\n\"What is it?\" Carol asked. She was standing in her upstairs bedroom.\n\n\"I've got AIDS,\" Tommy said.\n\nCarol took a deep breath. \"Tommy, you've got to be positive.\"\n\n\"I just said that,\" he snapped. \"I am 'positive.' \"\n\nOnce Tommy knew for sure that he had HIV, his first response was to make jokes, and his second was to adopt a kind of optimistic denial. \"In the first six months, he was very sure that something would be done and that he would be OK,\" recalls Tim Gallagher, one of the salesmen in Tommy's Savile Row emporium who had also become a close friend. \"I think he took it very well indeed.\" Occasionally, Tommy called up Stewart to ask some more questions: What about that new drug mentioned in the newspaper? What about this experimental form of treatment? But mostly he preferred not to discuss the situation at all, carrying on as though absolutely nothing had changed. Which is not to say, however, that he wasn't affected. His assistant, Wendy Samimi, spent enough time with Tommy to notice cracks in the carapace. Despite his demeanor of cool unconcern, she could tell that he was rattled. \"Would it affect his brain? Would he get all the sarcomas? It could manifest in so many different ways -- that's where his demons were about it.\"\n\nThese demons manifested most clearly whenever it came time for another doctor's appointment, now regular and essential. Visiting the Kobler meant Tommy could not pretend that everything was just the same; it forced him, for a few hours each month, to confront the full spectrum of AIDS, from patients like him with mild ailments right through to those in terminal stages -- his probable future, given it was still more than five years before the life-saving cocktail would be released.\n\nThe days leading up to his treatments were \"awful,\" Wendy recalls, \"because he'd be hell at work. You could see it: ginning himself up to go. Really didn't want to go. Probably a bit angry. A bit hard on people, which was not like him.\"\n\nAdapted from Lance Richardson's 'House of Nutter: The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row,'available now through Crown Archetype."}, {"url": "https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/designers/tommy-nutter/", "page_content": "Tommy Nutter was a British tailor.\n\nTommy Nutter was born in 1943.\n\nIn his youth Nutter studied at the Tailor and Cutter Academy and worked for traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward. He soon became inspired by changes in popular culture of the 1960s. In 1969 he opened his own shop, House of Nutter, in Savile Row, London.

{"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/tommy-nutter/", "page_content": "Tommy Nutter (17 April 1943 \u2013 17 August 1992) was a British tailor, famous for reinventing the Savile Row suit in the 1960s.\n\nBorn in Barmouth, Meirionnydd to Christopher Nutter and Dorothy (formerly Banister), he was raised in Edgware, Middlesex, where his father owned a local High Street Cafe. After the family moved to Kilburn, Nutter and his brother David attended Willesden Technical College. Nutter initially studied plumbing, and then architecture, but he abandoned both aged 19 to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy.\n\nIn the early 1960s, he joined traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward. After seven years, in 1969, he joined up with Edward Sexton, to open Nutters of Savile Row at No 35a Savile Row. They were financially backed by Cilla Black and her husband Bobby Willis, Managing Director of the Beatles' Apple Corps Peter Brown, and lawyer James Vallance-White.\n\nThe business was an immediate success, as Nutter combined traditional tailoring skills with innovative design. He designed for the Hardy Amies range, and then for the man himself. His clients included his investors, plus Sir Roy Strong, Mick Jagger, Bianca Jagger and Elton John. Nutter himself was most proud of the fact that, for the cover of The Beatles' album Abbey Road in 1969, he dressed three out of the four: George Harrison elected to be photographed on the road-crossing in denims.\n\nIn the 1970s his bespoke business became less successful, but he branched out into ready to wear clothing, marketed through Austin Reed. He also successfully expanded into East Asia, establishing the Savile Row brand in Japan. In 1976 Sexton bought Nutter out of the Business. Nutter went to work for Kilgour French and Stanbury, managing his own workroom. Sexton continued to run Nutters of Savile Row until 1983, when Nutter returned to the row with a ready to wear shop: \"Tommy Nutter, Savile Row\". (This new venture, which traded at No 19 Savile Row until Tommy's death, was backed by J&J Crombie Limited, who continue to own the \"Tommy Nutter\" trademark.) At this time, Sexton set up a business in his own name.\n\nIn the 1980s, he described his suits as a \"cross between the big-shouldered Miami Vice look and the authentic Savile Row.\" He created the clothing of The Joker worn by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film Batman.\n\nNutter died in 1992 at the Cromwell Hospital in London of complications from AIDS. In 2018 House of Nutter: The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row a biography of Nutter, with reminiscences by his brother David, a New York celebrity photographer, was published; it was written by Lance Richardson."}]}
