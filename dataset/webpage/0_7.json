He followed and developed Hughlings Jackson\u2019s original ideas about positive and negative neurological symptoms. His approach to patients was holistic at a time when more objectively defined notions of illness dominated medicine. He wrote on vertigo, and about criminal lunacy, and his book The Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, Nerves and their appendages was a major text of the period.\n\nWell versed in poetry, philosophy, art, and music, he was widely admired. He became President of the Royal College of Physicians.\n\nLike the great Sir Jonathan Hutchinson and other Victorians of privileged stock, Sir John Russell Reynolds (1828\u20131896) (Figure 1) never attended school. His father, a nonconformist minister at Romsey in Hampshire, educated him personally. His grandfather Henry Revell Reynolds (1745-1811), FRS, was an illustrious physician at the Middlesex and St Thomas\u2019s Hospitals and Physician to George III.\n\nFigure 1: Sir J Russell Reynolds. [Published in British Medical Journal, 6 June 1896)\n\nAs a nonconformist he was excluded from Oxford and Cambridge* and read Medicine at University College London, graduating with a gold medal in physiology, comparative anatomy, and medicine in 1851 [1]. An impecunious young doctor, he sought a living, practicing in Leeds where his brother was a Minister of the East Parade Mission Chapel, and his brother-in-law a journalist on the Leeds Mercury.\n\nA year later his former teacher Marshall Hall, FRS. (1790-1857), a physician and brilliant experimental physiologist persuaded him to return to London [2], where at modest cost Hall let him live in his home at 38, Grosvenor Street and join his Consultant practice, mainly in nervous diseases.\n\nOnly four years after graduating Russell Reynolds\u2019 outstanding ability led to his appointment as assistant physician at the Hospital for Sick Children and to the Westminster and University College Hospitals. There he became Holme Professor of Clinical Medicine in 1862, and in 1867 succeeding Sir William Jenner as Professor of Medicine. Just five years after the opening of the National Hospital for the Relief and Cure of Paralysis and Epilepsy, Russell Reynolds showed his interest in neurology and was appointed to its staff. He was elected FRS on 3rd June 1869.\n\nAt this time neurology began to flourish; he worked with many distinguished early neurologists. They included Hughlings Jackson (1835-1911), Jabez Ramskill (1825-1897), Charles Bland Radcliffe (1822\u20131889) who succeeded Brown\u2013S\u00e9quard in 1863, and published Lectures on Epilepsy, Pain, Paralysis, and certain other disorders of the Nervous System, 1864, and articles in Reynolds\u2019s System of Medicine. His brother John Netten Radcliffe (c. 1830-1884), a pioneering epidemiologist, was also Medical Superintendent of the Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic.\n\nNo man works in a vacuum. Marshall Hall, (who in spite of his acknowledged distinction [3] surprisingly had failed to get an academic post in London) inspired and encouraged Reynolds. Amongst contemporary and subsequent notable physicians he influenced were: the erudite Charlton Bastian (1837-1915); Charles Edward Beevor, (1854-1908); Howard Tooth (1856-1925); James Taylor, (1859-1946) editor of Jackson\u2019s Selected Writings; and the punctilious Thomas Buzzard (1831-1919), his neighbour in Grosvenor Street, and friend of both Hughlings Jackson and David Ferrier (1843-1928).\n\nSuch was Reynolds\u2019s reputation that he was rewarded with both the Lumleian and the Harveian lectures at the Royal College of Physicians of London, becoming President from 1893\u20131895. Like his grandfather, he was physician to the royal household in 1879 and was made a baronet in 1895. He was president of the BMA until his death.\n\nA popular and fluent lecturer, he was shy and serious but had a quiet humour and a \u2018directness of speech that was no respecter of persons.\u2019 Described as courteous, shrewd, and kind, his approach was holistic \u2013 long before it became fashionable:\n\nNot to merely make a diagnosis, much less to write a prescription, but to advise the individual patient what he or she should best do to regain their health\u2026 and what changes in the environment, mental, emotional, or physical were most likely to achieve this end. [2]\n\nMedical works\n\nRussell Reynolds is often remembered for his descriptions of epilepsy, eclamptic convulsions, and febrile convulsions in children [4,5]. He also used electrotherapy in various nervous diseases [6].\n\nInterestingly, he is widely quoted for commending the \u201cgreat value of Cannabis indica\u201d in migraine, epileptic conditions, depression, and asthma. In 1890 he prescribed a cannabis tincture for the menstrual cramps suffered by Queen Victoria. He noted in The Lancet:\n\nWhen pure and administered carefully, [cannabis] is one of the most valuable medicines we possess. [7]\n\nOf greater import was his 1861 paper (Figure 2) that espoused the concept of positive and negative neurological symptoms [5,8]. Positive symptoms were abnormal behaviours that included not only clonic jerking and abnormal movements but also hallucinations and paranoid delusions.\n\nSome symptoms are negative, i.e. they consist in the negation of vital properties. Of this kind are paralysis, anaesthesia, and the like\u2026Other symptoms are positive, i.e. they consist in excess or alteration of vital properties. Of this kind are spasms, pain, convulsions and the like\u2026 (p.9-12, 28)\n\nUnfortunately, he failed to write further on this theme. Like Jackson, Russell Reynolds shrewdly noted that the lesion did not directly cause the symptoms observed.\n\nThe origins of positive and negative symptoms were inextricably intertwined with Herbert Spencer\u2019s ideas of dissolution and evolution of the nervous system [9]. Hughlings Jackson extended Spencer\u2019s idea to patients\u2019 symptoms, both positive and negative. Jackson believed that negative symptoms related to the dissolution of neural function while positive symptoms resulted from excitation or the release of lower levels from higher inhibitory control:\n\nSpeaking of the physical side, there are degrees of loss of function of the least organized nervous arrangements with conservation of function of the more organized. There is in each reduction to a more automatic condition; in each there is dissolution, using this term as Spencer does, as the opposite of evolution. [10]\n\nFigure 2. Reynolds: Epilepsy, its symptoms, treatment and relation to other chronic convulsive diseases. 1861\n\nRussell Reynolds wrote his first book on Vertigo. In 1856 he examined legal pleas for insanity in his Criminal Lunatics: are they Responsible? He believed that epilepsy could be a distinct or \u2018idiopathic\u2019 disease, a controversial view well expressed in The Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, Nerves and their appendages in 1855 (dedicated to Marshall Hall), This was later contradicted by Kinnier Wilson who stated that all epileptic events were symptoms, whether or not any underlying pathology could be demonstrated [11].\n\nAlways inclined to a broad approach he described the interictal symptoms of 62 patients with idiopathic epilepsy. He found about one-third had mild impairment of recent memory and a similar proportion had moderate to severe psychopathological findings. His interpretation of epileptic activity (well described by Eadie) [12] was in large measure approved by Hughlings Jackson.\n\nHe edited and wrote many chapters in A system of medicine (London: Macmillan, in five volumes from 1866 to 1879), a major text rivalled only by John Cooke\u2019s Treatise in Nervous Diseases, published in two volumes, in 1820 and 1823, the second volume of Bright\u2019s Reports of Medical Cases 1831, and Romberg\u2019s Manual of the Nervous Diseases of Man 1840 [13].\n\nRussell Reynolds practiced at a time when neurology was in its infancy. It relied on clinical description and elementary pathology. In this morass of evolving knowledge, Reynolds formulated a classification of neurological diseases that remains the kernel of modern systems. His work in neurology linked the highly original physiological and clinical works of his mentor, Marshall Hall, to Hughlings Jackson\u2019s intellectual explorations of the brain\u2019s complex functions and hierarchies, and to the more systematic descriptive neurology of William Gowers [12]. His students included Charlton Bastian (1837-1915) and Sir William Gowers (1845-1915), whose writings often reflect his influence.\n\nLegacy\n\nHe was well versed in poetry, philosophy, art, and music. He was married, first, to Margaret Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances Crespigny, but left no children. He died aged 68 of \u2018pulmonary congestion\u2019 at his home in 1896.\n\nThe scholarship and clinical advances made by Reynolds can be seen as important influences on contemporary and also later notable neurologists at the National Hospital. He bridged the eras of Victorian Neurology with that of the dawning 20th century.\n\nHe was noted as:\n\nA man of scholarship and wisdom, in his presidential address in 1894, in a spirit of prophecy he warned the subject-ridden student of to day of the danger of becoming entangled in the net of an ill-considered and misunderstood technical phraseology, and of juggling with words when he ought to be dealing with concrete things. [2]\n\nAnd Eadie characterised him as:\n\nA most eminent, scholarly, and influential physician who was greatly respected and admired by his contemporaries\u2026the sort of man whose ideas would not readily be discarded because it might almost seem disrespectful to do so unless a better alternative could be clearly demonstrated to exist. [12]\n\n* So-called dissenters (Catholics, Jews, and Quakers) were denied admission because their religious beliefs prevented their taking an oath to adhere to the 39 articles of the Anglican Church. This was abolished by the Universities Tests Act in 1871.\n\nWomen had studied at Oxford since the 1870s. But until 1921, they were not entitled to claim the degrees they had earned. Cambridge followed in 1947.\n\nReferences\n\nBrown GH. Munk\u2019s Roll. Lives of the Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians of London (1826-1925).

His father gave him the greater part of his general education and University College, London, his medical training. He graduated in 1851 as University scholar and gold medallist in physiology, comparative anatomy and medicine. For so outstanding a student, a great future seemed assured. But his means were slender and he decided to begin practice in Leeds where he had relatives. However, his old teacher Marshall Hall persuaded him to return to London, offering him his house in Grosvenor Street on favourable terms. His enterprise was rewarded by appointments as assistant physician to the Hospital for Sick Children in 1855, the Westminster Hospital in 1857 and University College Hospital in 1859. After a further three years, he became full physician and Holme professor of clinical medicine at University College, and in 1867 he succeeded Jenner in the chair of medicine.\n\nReynolds gave distinguished service to the Royal College of Physicians, being Lumleian Lecturer in 1867, Harveian Orator in 1884, Censor, and finally, from 1893 to 1896, President. He was chosen as Physician to the Royal Household in 1879 and, with his friend, J. E. Erichsen, created a baronet in 1895. He was president of the B.M.A. at the time of his death. But he made his mark in the profession chiefly by his early writings on nervous diseases \u2014 he was one of the first to propound the possibilities of electricity as a therapeutic agent \u2014 and by his editorship of the System of Medicine, published in five volumes between 1866 and 1879. He was a fluent and popular lecturer and a careful and sympathetic physician. Somewhat shy and grave of mien, he could reveal both a quiet humour and a directness of speech that was no respecter of persons. Painting and music were his recreations, and he was well read in literature. He was married, firstly, to a Miss Ainslie and, secondly to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street.\n\nG H Brown\n\n[Lancet, 1896; B.M.J., 1896; D.N.B., xlviii, 52]"}, {"url": "https://archive.org/details/pub_saturday-review", "page_content": "eye Title Creator\n\nThe Saturday Review 1907-01-12: Volume 103 , Issue 2672.

He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851 he graduated M.B. in the university of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852 he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a fellow of the college in 1859. In the same year he was appointed assistant physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, assistant physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 assistant physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865 he became professor of the principles and practice of medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed physician-in-ordinary to the queen's household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 vice-president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian oration in 1884, and was elected president in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a baronet. In the winter of 1895\u20136 he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as president of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, to Miss Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children.\n\nThe Reynolds Baronetcy, of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds. The title became extinct on his death.\n\nReynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an Essay on Vertigo; in 1855 Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves, as well as Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity; in 1872 The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the System of Medicine, in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write\u2014compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe. Reynolds was a tall man, with dark hair, with a dignified delivery and some oratorical power.\n\nReynolds died in London."}, {"url": "https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1901_supplement/Reynolds,_Henry_Robert", "page_content": "\u200bREYNOLDS, HENRY ROBERT (1825\u20131890), congregational divine, born at Romsey in Hampshire on 26 Feb. 1825, was the grandson of Henry Revell Reynolds [q. v.], and the elder son of John Reynolds (1782\u20131862), congregational minister, by his second wife, Sarah (d. 1868), daughter of Robert Fletcher of Chester and sister of Joseph Fletcher (1784\u20131843) [q. v.] Sir John Russell Reynolds [q. v.] was his younger brother. Henry was educated chiefly by his father, and in September 1841 he entered Coward College, London (now incorporated in New College, South Hampstead) to prepare for the ministry. He matriculated at London University in the same year, obtaining the university mathematical scholarship in 1844 and graduating B.A. in 1848. In the same year he was made a fellow of University College, London.\n\nIn April 1846 he became pastor of the congregational church at Halstead in Essex, receiving permission to curtail his course at Coward College at the urgent request of the congregation. He was ordained on 16 July 1846. Among his congregation was the future missionary, Matthew Atmore Sherring [q. v.], whose father was one of Reynolds's deacons. In 1849 Reynolds accepted a call to be minister of the East Parade chapel at Leeds, entering on his new duties on 28 March. The ten succeeding years were probably the most strenuous in his life. He took a keen interest in theological controversies of the day, and made an especial study of the writings of Auguste Comte, on whom he published a criticism in the 'British Quarterly Review' in April 1854. In 1855 his health gave way, and the labours of the next five years were diversified by visits to Egypt, Italy, and the south of France, and broken by frequent illness. During this period he and his brother, John Russell Reynolds, wrote a novel dealing with the intellectual and religious questions of the time, which was published anonymously in 1860 with the title 'Yes and No.'\n\nIn June 1860 Reynolds accepted the post of president of Cheshunt College, whither he removed in August. Besides fulfilling the duties of principal of the college and pastor of the college chapel and village churches, he was professor of dogmatic theology, ecclesiastical history, and New Testament exegesis. In addition to these he undertook serious literary labours. From 1866 to 1874 he was co-editor with Henry Allon [q. v. Suppl.] of the 'British Quarterly Review,' and from 1877 to 1882 he edited the 'Evangelical Magazine.' In 1870 and 1871 he edited two series of essays on church problems by \u200bvarious writers, entitled 'Ecclesia' (London, 8vo), and in 1874 he published lectures on 'John the Baptist' in the new series of 'Congregational Union Lectures.' They reached a third edition in 1888. He wrote frequently for the 'Expositor,' and contributed to the 'Dictionary of Christian Biography.'\n\nIn 1869 Reynolds received the honorary degree of D.D. from Edinburgh University, and in the years immediately following he was engaged on the project of enlarging the Cheshunt College buildings, in celebration of the centenary of the institution. This work was completed in 1872. In 1888 appeared his most notable work, the 'Introduction' and 'Exposition' on the Gospel of St. John, contributed to the 'Pulpit Commentary.' In November 1894 failing health compelled him to resign the presidency of Cheshunt College, and in May 1895 he withdrew to Broxbourne in Hertfordshire. He died at Broxbourne on 10 Sept. 1896, and was buried in Cheshunt cemetery on 15 Sept. On 17 Dec. 1840, at Walworth chapel, he married Louisa Caroline (d. 11 Oct. 1895), only surviving daughter of Silas Palmer of Newbury, Berkshire. They had no children.\n\nOn 21 Sept. 1882 Reynolds's portrait, painted by Mr. Sydney Hodges, was presented to Cheshunt College by the past and present students. A replica was presented to Mrs. Reynolds.\n\nBesides the works already mentioned, Reynolds was the author of: 1. 'The Beginnings of the Divine Life: a Course of Seven Sermons,' London, 1859, 8vo. 2. 'Notes on the Christian Life: a Selection of Sermons,' London, 1865, 8vo. 3. 'The Philosophy of Prayer and Principles of Christian Service; with other Papers,' London, 1881, 8vo. 4.

As his HR analytics guru, Kelly Smith, points out, that risks upsetting\u2013and maybe even losing\u2013some of the \u201cbig billers\u201d (rainmakers) who were heavily rewarded under the current system that motivated individual, \u2018entrepreneurial\u2019 efforts to win business. Frustrated by the current system\u2019s shortcomings, including failing to provide clients with the teams they needed for increasingly advisory work and affording junior consultants an opportunity to adequately apprentice, Murphy was worried that the current compensation system was holding RRA back from executing on his growth strategy intended to help RRA\u2013a top 5 search firm\u2013recapture market share lost to its competitors since the great recession. He had tried many attempts, over multiple years, to change the culture through other means, but only with tepid success. Now he had to decide whether to pull the trigger on a large-scale effort to adjust RRA\u2019s discretionary bonus system after hearing concern\u2013and even anger\u2013over the proposal from some of his top 20 consultants.\n\n\n\nTo permit students to analyze the situation, they have access to detailed, real performance and compensation data for all RRA consultants in 2015 (in the supplementary (C) case spreadsheet), along with the modeling RRA did to forecast the effect of the compensation system changes on each person. Students can therefore analyze how a more collaborative approach to compensation might positively impact some consultants and adversely impact others, assessing the benefits and risks of the dislocation.\n\n\n\nBy asking students to decide whether Murphy should move forward with the new compensation system, or whether an alternative might be better, students will wrestle with the role of compensation systems in driving intended behaviors, such as collaboration, and thus in supporting or warping organizational culture, performance, and growth. By analyzing the dislocation to employees\u2019 variable compensation due to a change, students will learn the challenges of changing and calibrating compensation systems. Finally, by exposing students to the various tradeoffs involved in designing a compensation system and the \u201czero sum\u201d nature of their implications, students will internalize the complexity involved in attempting to drive organizational change through changes to a compensation system (i.e., \u201calign incentives\u201d is not as easy to do as it is to say).\n\n\n\nFor faculty members seeking to expose students to the internal functioning of professional services firms (and/or specifically executive search firms), the case context permits an uncharacteristically transparent look inside one firm, although the lessons about compensation of the case discussion extend to organizations more generally.\n\n\n\nThe (A) case describes the dilemma faced by the firm and its CEO in 2015, and it concludes by asking students to make a decision about RRA\u2019s compensation system design going forward. The (B) case describes the decision the firm made, how the changes were communicated and rolled out, the impacts (both intended and unintended) on consultant behavior and results, and reflections on what worked and didn\u2019t work (updated as of 2021). The (C) case supplement is a spreadsheet that provides real performance and compensation data for all ~350 RRA consultants at the time the decision was being made (in 2015), and comparable performance and compensation data for those consultants in 2018 (to pair with the (B) case) is available to faculty separately as part of the Teaching Note.\n\nKeywords\n\nCitation"}], "John Russell Reynolds wrote several books on Shakespeare, including The Mystery of William Shakespeare (1848) and The Authorship of Shakespeare (1875).": [{"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/shakespeare-computers-and-the-mystery-of-authorship/89F8AEF655C5FFD3D73E500870C71972", "page_content": "Review of the hardback:' \u2026 Shakespeare, Computers, and the Mystery of Authorship deserves to become a landmark in its field.

Writers such as Milton, Dryden, Pope, Dr Johnson, Keats, Coleridge, Charles Lamb, Henry James and Virginia Woolf have all addressed the Shakespeare conundrum in one way or another. Additionally, since the millennium, there have been several new books devoted to Shakespeare\u2019s life and work by scholars as diverse as Peter Conrad, Stephen Greenblatt, James Shapiro and Stanley Wells.\n\nTo write in this genre, I knew I would be putting myself at some risk. But I had a story to tell. In my mind, Shakespearean was inspired by watching a controversial Public Theatre production of Julius Caesar in June 2017 in New York which nightly staged the assassination of Donald Trump. From the moment the Roman dictator (in a Maga baseball cap) bounded on to the stage in Central Park wearing a white shirt and long red tie, I asked myself: how did a young man who grew up in rural Warwickshire, who did not go to university, and who died at the age of 52, far from court or cloister, become not merely \u201cShakespeare\u201d but also the global icon for the quality we call \u201cShakespearean\u201d? How, to put it another way, does he remain so effortlessly modern more than 400 years after his death?\n\nBy chance, the historical disruption that inspired this book only worsened from 2017 to 2020, culminating in the outbreak of the modern plague, coronavirus. Our times were turning out to be more Shakespearean than I had anticipated. There was also this literary dividend: Shakespeare left about 1m words of poetry and prose; he also bequeathed the legacy of his influence: novels, stories and essays inspired by his work. Here is my selection.\n\n1. A Dictionary of the English Language by Dr Samuel Johnson\n\nIf Shakespeare is famous for one thing, it\u2019s his innovative brilliance with the English language, as many as 1,800 new words, including lacklustre, amazement, assassinate, hobnob and barefaced. These all appear in Johnson\u2019s dictionary, which makes a point of using Shakespeare citations to establish English usage.\n\n2. Moby-Dick by Herman Melville\n\nMelville did not just want to identify with Shakespeare \u2013 he wanted to compete with him, as an American. \u201cIf Shakespeare has not [yet] been equalled,\u201d he wrote, \u201che is sure to be surpassed by an American born now, or yet to be born.\u201d Melville\u2019s edition of the complete works has about 500 passages marked for special study; and the writing of Moby-Dick became an extraordinary effort of literary oneupmanship.\n\nHuckleberry Finn \u2026 an American Hamlet. Photograph: Moviestore Collection / Rex Features\n\n3. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain\n\nTwain\u2019s masterpiece offers a double-shot of Shakespearean influence. His comic duo of confidence men, the \u201crightful duke of Bridgewater\u201d and his sidekick \u201cthe King of France\u201d \u2013 two characters who could have stepped from The Merry Wives of Windsor or Falstaff\u2019s Eastcheap \u2013 were inspired by the young Twain\u2019s experience of wild west culture as a reporter during the California gold rush. Secondly, Twain\u2019s famous parody of Hamlet (\u201cTo be or not to be; that is the bare bodkin\u201d) displays an American master spoofing brilliantly at the top of his bent.\n\n4. A Thousand Acres by Jane Smiley\n\nMany US novelists have been bitten by the Shakespeare bug: Toni Morrison (Desdemona), John Updike (Gertrude and Claudius) and Arthur Phillips (The Tragedy of Arthur) from contemporary fiction. More popular, perhaps, is Smiley\u2019s modernisation of King Lear, in which Shakespeare\u2019s plot and characters are relocated to the midwest. Smiley says that her novel grew out of her response to \u201cthe ways in which I found the conventional reading of Lear frustrating and wrong\u201d. Part of Shakespeare\u2019s eternal youth is that he always invites us to find new responses to his work.\n\n5. A Room of One\u2019s Own by Virginia Woolf\n\nThis landmark in feminist thought was inspired by Woolf\u2019s recollection of an old academic declaring that \u201cwomen cannot write the plays of William Shakespeare\u201d. Her portrait of \u201cJudith Shakespeare\u201d becomes a polemical fiction about a woman who, like Woolf herself, had to stay home, watch her brother go to school, and become imprisoned in domesticity. Eventually, Judith is shamed into a marriage of convenience. Her brother flourishes, while Judith\u2019s genius remains unfulfilled. The poet\u2019s sister eventually kills herself, but enables Woolf to review the creative beginnings of some great literary examplars, including Jane Austen, George Eliot, and the Bront\u00eb sisters.\n\nEternal youth \u2026 1890 German illustration imagining Shakespeare reciting Hamlet to his family in Stratford. Photograph: The Picture Art Collection/Alamy\n\n6. Shakespeare\u2019s Wife by Germaine Greer\n\nIn a kind of homage to Woolf, Greer starts with a woman about whom almost nothing is known, married to a great poet, and reimagines the story of the Hathaway-Shakespeare marriage in its context, treating Anne (or Agnes) with the greatest sympathy. Greer rescues her life story from oblivion with wit and scholarship. It\u2019s a good companion to Hamnet, below.\n\n7. Hamnet by Maggie O\u2019Farrell\n\nThe 2020 winner of the Women\u2019s prize for fiction, this poignant meditation on grief is characterised by O\u2019Farrell\u2019s outstanding immersion in the Elizabethan Stratford of the 1590s. Shakespeare is unnamed, and O\u2019Farrell focuses on his wife Agnes (as Anne was known) to explore the death of their son Hamnet from plague in 1596. The luminous magic of this novel lies as much in what it omits as what it depicts, but the scene in which Agnes lays out her son\u2019s body is one that few readers will forget.\n\n8. The Lodger, Shakespeare on Silver Street by Charles Nicholl\n\nNicholl made his reputation as a writer with The Reckoning, his brilliant investigation into the death of Christopher Marlowe, Shakespeare\u2019s contemporary and rival. In a second foray into the court records of the age, Nicholl takes a forgotten lawsuit in which Shakespeare appeared as a witness (the only occasion on which his actual spoken words were recorded). In an enthralling weave of metropolitan social history, Shakespeare commentary and the Jacobean domestic romcom surrounding the marriage of Marie Mountjoy and Stephen Belott, Nicholl once again breathes new life into some very dusty archives. A delight.\n\n9. Nothing like the Sun by Anthony Burgess\n\nBurgess\u2019s fascination with Shakespeare was a lifetime\u2019s obsession. His first foray into Shakespeare\u2019s world occurred in 1964 with this exuberant novel about Will the poet\u2019s love life, partly driven by the claim that Shakespeare\u2019s imagination was inspired by syphilis. This became a film script, The Bawdy Bard, never produced, which morphed into his brilliant biographical essay, Shakespeare (1970).\n\n10. Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being by Ted Hughes\n\nShakespeare was obsessed with risk and originality, the key to drama. Hughes was also fascinated by the wellsprings of creativity. He devoted much of his life to rereading the complete works, and signed the contract for this magnum opus towards the end of his life. It was to offer the reader \u201ca sort of musical adaptation\u201d, a majestic song in which the plays become \u201ca single titanic work, like an Indian epic\u201d. Shakespeare and the Goddess became Hughes\u2019s most sustained prose work, a book he claimed nearly killed him. On publication in 1992, it was poorly received, but is now becoming recognised as his prose masterpiece."}, {"url": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/potsawee/wiki_bio_gpt3_hallucination", "page_content": "\"John Russell Reynolds (1820\u20131876) was an English lawyer, judge, and author.

Reynolds was born in Romsey, Hampshire, as the son of John Reynolds, an independent minister, and the grandson of Dr. Henry Revell Reynolds. He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851, he graduated M.B. in the University of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852, he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a Fellow of the College in 1859. In the same year, he was appointed Assistant Physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 Assistant Physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865, he became Professor of the Principles and Practice of Medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen's Household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 Vice-President of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian Lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian Oration in 1884, and was elected President in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a Baronet. In the winter of 1895\u201396, he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as President of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, to Miss Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children. The \"Reynolds Baronetcy\", of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds. The title became extinct on his death. Reynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an \"Essay on Vertigo\"; in 1855 \"Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves\", as well as \"Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain\"; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 \"Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity\"; in 1872 \"The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity\"; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the \"System of Medicine\", in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write \u2013 compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a \"Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe\".

By 1594 he was apparently a rising playwright in London and an actor in a leading theatre company, the Lord Chamberlain\u2019s Men (later King\u2019s Men); the company performed at the Globe Theatre from 1599.\n\nThe order in which Shakespeare\u2019s plays were written and performed is highly uncertain. His earliest plays seem to date from the late 1580s to the mid-1590s and include the comedies Love\u2019s Labour\u2019s Lost, The Comedy of Errors, The Taming of the Shrew, and A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream; history plays based on the lives of the English kings, including Henry VI (parts 1, 2, and 3), Richard III, and Richard II; and the tragedy Romeo and Juliet.\n\nThe plays apparently written between 1596 and 1600 are mostly comedies, including The Merchant of Venice, The Merry Wives of Windsor, Much Ado About Nothing, and As You Like It, and histories, including Henry IV (parts 1 and 2), Henry V, and Julius Caesar.\n\nApproximately between 1600 and 1607 he wrote the comedies Twelfth Night, All\u2019s Well That Ends Well, and Measure for Measure, as well as the great tragedies Hamlet (probably begun in 1599), Othello, Macbeth, and King Lear, which mark the summit of his art.\n\nAmong his later works (about 1607 to 1614) are the tragedies Antony and Cleopatra, Coriolanus, and Timon of Athens, as well as the fantastical romances The Winter\u2019s Tale and The Tempest.\n\nHe probably also collaborated on the plays Edward III and The Two Noble Kinsmen. In 2010 a case was made for Shakespeare as the coauthor (with John Fletcher) of Double Falsehood.\n\nShakespeare\u2019s plays, all of them written largely in iambic pentameter verse, are marked by extraordinary poetry; vivid, subtle, and complex characterizations; and a highly inventive use of English. His 154 sonnets, published in 1609 but apparently written mostly in the 1590s, often express strong feeling within an exquisitely controlled form.\n\nShakespeare retired to Stratford before 1610 and lived as a country gentleman until his death. The first collected edition of his plays, or First Folio, was published in 1623. As with most writers of the time, little is known about his life and work, and other writers, particularly the 17th earl of Oxford, have frequently been proposed as the actual authors of his plays and poems."}, {"url": "https://interestingliterature.com/2015/07/the-best-books-about-shakespeare/", "page_content": "Our pick of the ten best biographies and other books about the Bard which everyone should read \u2013 selected by Dr Oliver Tearle\n\nWe thought it was time we offered our pick of the best books about William Shakespeare: the best introductions to his life and his work. The following is not designed to be an exhaustive list, but many of these books were written by leading Shakespeare scholars and each contains something which every fan of the Bard should know.\n\nJonathan Bate, The Genius of Shakespeare . This book, published in 1997, examines the legacy of Shakespeare\u2019s work, the way it has inspired others (from Romantic poets and novelists to twentieth-century postcolonial theorists), and how Shakespeare\u2019s writing is constantly reinvented and recast by each new generation. It\u2019s a hugely readable book, since Bate is happy to speculate \u2013 drawing on what evidence is available \u2013 as to many of the great mysteries of Shakespeare\u2019s life and work, such as the identity of the \u2018Mr W. H.\u2019 to whom the 1609 printing of the Sonnets was dedicated. It has been called \u2018the best modern book on Shakespeare\u2019 (by RSC founder Sir Peter Hall) and is essential reading for anyone interested in the Bard. Also well worth the read is Bate\u2019s biography of the Bard\u2026\n\nJonathan Bate, Soul of the Age: The Life, Mind and World of William Shakespeare . This, from 2008, is a sort of \u2018intellectual biography\u2019 of Shakespeare which uses Jaques\u2019 \u2018Seven Ages of Man\u2019 speech from As You Like It as a conceit or structure through which to examine some of the widely held assumptions about Shakespeare\u2019s life. Did Shakespeare really retire from London and return to Stratford-upon-Avon to live out his last years with his family, following his \u2018curtain call\u2019 on the London stage, his 1611 play The Tempest? Bate also suggests a highly plausible candidate for the \u2018rival poet\u2019 referred to in the Sonnets; his analysis here is compelling. Another must-read.\n\nStephen Greenblatt, Will In The World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare . Greenblatt\u2019s book (from 2004) forms a valuable companion to Bate\u2019s two books, especially Soul of the Age. Greenblatt is the founder of the school of criticism known as New Historicism, which, put crudely and simply, examines literary works in their original context through particular focus on the network of writings that were being produced at the time the literary text was produced. New Historicism also uses specific events \u2013 including anecdotes \u2013 from the period to shed light on the social and political background out of which the literature was written. Greenblatt is especially interested in the idea of Shakespeare as a careful and cautious man, a businessman shoring up his earnings from his share in the theatres he worked for, and his property investments, for his retirement. But Greenblatt is also frequently brilliant about the plays themselves: his discussion of the shift that took place in Shakespeare\u2019s writing in around 1600 (when he wrote Hamlet) is fascinating. In short, in plays such as Hamlet, King Lear, and Othello, Shakespeare draws on existing source material for these stories but removes obvious motives for characters\u2019 actions (e.g. Iago\u2019s motive for making mischief, Lear\u2019s reason for testing his daughters), resulting in more psychologically and morally complex and ambiguous drama.\n\nCaroline Spurgeon, Shakespeare\u2019s Imagery and What It Tells Us. This landmark work of literary analysis was first published in 1934, and is a fascinating study of Shakespeare\u2019s writing and well worth reading. Spurgeon examines the images of Shakespeare\u2019s plays in order to find out what sorts of images he most frequently draws on and what this might tell us about him, especially in terms of his relation to his contemporaries. It is a good study of what makes Shakespeare so peculiar alongside his fellow Elizabethan and Jacobean writers.\n\nFrank Kermode, Shakespeare\u2019s Language . One of the best books on Shakespeare\u2019s language, and a handy companion volume to Spurgeon\u2019s older, groundbreaking study of the Bard\u2019s imagery. Kermode was often a superb close-reader of poetry and a very clear-headed critic, and this shines through here. Highly readable.\n\nJames Shapiro, 1599: A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare . If you fancy an in-depth study of one particular moment in Shakespeare\u2019s life, Shapiro\u2019s book is for you. Annobiographies (to coin a term), or biographies/cultural histories of one particular year are all the rage (for other fascinating studies of particular years, see Michael North\u2019s Reading 1922: A Return to the Scene of the Modern and Nicholas Freeman\u2019s 1895: Drama, Disaster and Disgrace in Late Victorian Britain (Edinburgh Critical Studies in Victorian Culture) ), and the advantage here is that Shapiro can really zoom in on the year in which the Globe Theatre was built in London and Shakespeare began to move towards that new phase of his career that was ushered in with Hamlet. His forthcoming book on 1606 will doubtless prove similarly compelling.\n\nHarold Bloom, Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human . This was one of the first of the recent popular books on Shakespeare written by an academic: although it was published a year after Bate\u2019s The Genius of Shakespeare , in 1998, it purportedly sold 100,000 copies in hardback (perhaps as a result of the success of Shakespeare in Love in cinemas that year) and, despite some contentious claims, showed publishers that lots of readers had an appetite for books on the Bard.\n\nA. C. Bradley, Shakespearean Tragedy: Lectures on Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth (New Penguin Shakespeare Library) . In 1904, this immeasurably influential study of Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies appeared. It is still in print \u2013 as an affordable Penguin Classics edition \u2013 and although Bradley sometimes treats the characters a little too much as though they were real people rather than imaginary constructions, there\u2019s a raft of lucid insights into the plays to be had.\n\nBill Bryson, Shakespeare: The World as a Stage (Eminent Lives) . This is our choice for a popular book on Shakespeare written by a non-Shakespearean. It\u2019s short, light, engaging, humorous, with its distinct approach being to discount as much of the speculation about Shakespeare\u2019s life as possible, and instead focus solely on the facts of his life that we definitely (or at least pretty definitely) know.\n\nHelen Vendler, The Art of Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets (Belknap) . Written by one of the greatest living critics, this book is perhaps the best one on the Sonnets. A remarkable close reader of poetry, Vendler provides detailed commentaries on all of the 154 sonnets and, like Spurgeon and Kermode, has some particularly astute things to say about the poems\u2019 language. It\u2019s a little pricier than most of the other books on this list, but it\u2019s big, so it\u2019s worth the extra money.\n\nOf course, any list purporting to select the \u2018best books on Shakespeare\u2019 is going to be subjective and even tendentious \u2013 so do please leave us your suggestions for other titles below.\n\nIf you enjoyed this list, check out our pick of the 10 best books about literature and our interesting facts about the Bard.

Dates of baptisms, marriages, deaths, and burials; wills, conveyances, legal processes, and payments by the court\u2014these are the dusty details. There are, however, many contemporary allusions to him as a writer, and these add a reasonable amount of flesh and blood to the biographical skeleton.\n\nEarly life in Stratford\n\nThe parish register of Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, shows that he was baptized there on April 26, 1564; his birthday is traditionally celebrated on April 23. His father, John Shakespeare, was a burgess of the borough, who in 1565 was chosen an alderman and in 1568 bailiff (the position corresponding to mayor, before the grant of a further charter to Stratford in 1664). He was engaged in various kinds of trade and appears to have suffered some fluctuations in prosperity. His wife, Mary Arden, of Wilmcote, Warwickshire, came from an ancient family and was the heiress to some land. (Given the somewhat rigid social distinctions of the 16th century, this marriage must have been a step up the social scale for John Shakespeare.)\n\nStratford enjoyed a grammar school of good quality, and the education there was free, the schoolmaster\u2019s salary being paid by the borough. No lists of the pupils who were at the school in the 16th century have survived, but it would be absurd to suppose the bailiff of the town did not send his son there. The boy\u2019s education would consist mostly of Latin studies\u2014learning to read, write, and speak the language fairly well and studying some of the Classical historians, moralists, and poets. Shakespeare did not go on to the university, and indeed it is unlikely that the scholarly round of logic, rhetoric, and other studies then followed there would have interested him.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Where and exactly when are not known, but the episcopal registry at Worcester preserves a bond dated November 28, 1582, and executed by two yeomen of Stratford, named Sandells and Richardson, as a security to the bishop for the issue of a license for the marriage of William Shakespeare and \u201cAnne Hathaway of Stratford,\u201d upon the consent of her friends and upon once asking of the banns. (Anne died in 1623, seven years after Shakespeare. There is good evidence to associate her with a family of Hathaways who inhabited a beautiful farmhouse, now much visited, 2 miles [3.2 km] from Stratford.) The next date of interest is found in the records of the Stratford church, where a daughter, named Susanna, born to William Shakespeare, was baptized on May 26, 1583. On February 2, 1585, twins were baptized, Hamnet and Judith. (Hamnet, Shakespeare\u2019s only son, died 11 years later.)\n\nHow Shakespeare spent the next eight years or so, until his name begins to appear in London theatre records, is not known. There are stories\u2014given currency long after his death\u2014of stealing deer and getting into trouble with a local magnate, Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecote, near Stratford; of earning his living as a schoolmaster in the country; of going to London and gaining entry to the world of theatre by minding the horses of theatregoers. It has also been conjectured that Shakespeare spent some time as a member of a great household and that he was a soldier, perhaps in the Low Countries. In lieu of external evidence, such extrapolations about Shakespeare\u2019s life have often been made from the internal \u201cevidence\u201d of his writings. But this method is unsatisfactory: one cannot conclude, for example, from his allusions to the law that Shakespeare was a lawyer, for he was clearly a writer who without difficulty could get whatever knowledge he needed for the composition of his plays."}, {"url": "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/to-be-or-not-to-be-shakespeare-127247606/", "page_content": "Even if you're a regular visitor to London, it's probably never occurred to you to stop in to see William Shakespeare's original manuscripts at the British Museum or Library. That's just as well. There are no original manuscripts. Not so much as a couplet written in Shakespeare's own hand has been proven to exist. In fact, there's no hard evidence that Will Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon (1564-1616), revered as the greatest author in the English language, could even write a complete sentence.\n\nIs it any wonder that controversy swirls around the authorship of the 154 sonnets and some 37 plays credited to him? Skeptics have long belittled the notion of a barely educated small-town boy who moves to London to work as an actor and is suddenly writing masterpieces of unrivaled beauty and sophistication. Henry James wrote to a friend in 1903 that he was \"haunted by the conviction that the divine William is the biggest and most successful fraud ever practised on a patient world.\" Other doubters have included Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, Sigmund Freud, Orson Welles and Sir John Gielgud.\n\nAt heart, the Shakespeare debate is about more than missing records. It's driven by an unquenchable need to slip past Shakespeare's verses and locate the real-life artist behind them, whoever he or she might be. Little is known about Dante or Chaucer either, but somehow that isn't as nettlesome. \"If Shakespeare hadn\u2019t been metamorphosed into a god, nobody would think it was worth having an authorship controversy about him,\" says Jonathan Bate, a Shakespeare expert at the University of Warwick, not far from Stratford.\n\nIt's certainly curious that the creator of such vivid, recognizably human characters as Falstaff, Lear and Hamlet should himself remain as insubstantial as stage smoke. The most detailed description of the man left to us by someone who actually knew him, it seems, is a less-than-incisive sentence from his friend and rival, the playwright Ben Jonson: \"He was, indeed, honest, and of an open and free nature.\" That covers a lot of ground. As for Shakespeare's appearance, none of his contemporaries bothered to describe it. Tall or short? Thin or chubby? It's anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nAn exhibition about the visual side of this quest\u2014the desire to see William Shakespeare's face, literally\u2014is on view through September 17 at the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, Connecticut. \"Searching for Shakespeare\" brings together eight images of the Bard (six paintings, one engraving and one sculpted bust)\u2014only one of which was likely done from life\u2014along with rare theatrical artifacts and documents. Rendered by long-forgotten artists, each of the six painted portraits surfaced after the playwright's death, in some cases centuries later. \"There's something about Shakespeare that connects with those big human issues\u2014who we are, why we feel the way we do, love, jealousy, passion,\" says Tarnya Cooper, who curated the exhibition at London's National Portrait Gallery, where the portraits exhibit opened last March. \"In looking for a portrait of Shakespeare, we want to see traces of those passions in the portrait's face.\"\n\nUnfortunately, as a flesh-and-blood human being Will Shakespeare of Stratford remains stubbornly out of reach. He was born to an apparently illiterate glove maker and his wife early in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. At 18, he married the pregnant Anne Hathaway, who was eight years his senior. By 21, he had fathered three children. He turns up in the documentary record next at age 28 in London\u2014apparently without his family\u2014working as an actor. He's later listed as a member of a prominent acting troupe, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, and later, the King's Men. His name appears on the title pages of plays printed for popular consumption beginning in his mid-30s. Records show he retired around 1613 and moved back to Stratford, where he died in relative obscurity three years later at 52. And that's about it.\n\nThe sketchy paper trail from Shakespeare's life hasn't stopped the publishing industry from issuing a stream of biographies filled with phrases like \"may have\" and \"could have.\" Last year in the New York Times Book Review, editor Rachel Donadio mused whether Stephen Greenblatt's 2005 biography of the Bard, Will in the World, should be on the fiction or the nonfiction bestseller list.\n\n\"There are documents from William Shakespeare's life that concern his career as an actor and theater manager and so on, but there's nothing that suggests a literary life,\" says Mark Anderson, author of \"Shakespeare\" by Another Name, an examination of the plays' authorship. \"That's what\u2019s so damning about the documentary record. The greatest manhunt in literary history has turned up no manuscripts, no letters, no diaries.\" The only definitive examples of Shakespeare's handwriting are six signatures, all on legal documents. Of course, few letters or diaries of commoners from that time have survived.\n\nDoubters over the years have proposed some 60 candidates as the real Shakespeare, among them Sir Walter Ralegh, Christopher Marlowe and Queen Elizabeth herself. The popular favorite among skeptics of the 19th and early 20th centuries was Francis Bacon, philosopher and writer. Some Baconians maintained that secret codes sprinkled throughout Shakespeare's plays pointed to the works' true author. (For example, by counting the difference in total words in two passages from Henry IV, Part 1, multiplying that by the number of hyphenations, then using the result to move up or maybe down a page somewhere else, you can begin to extract hidden messages in the plays, such as \"shak'st...spur...never...writ...a...word...of...them.\") Other contenders were decidedly far-fetched\u2014a long-dead member of Henry VIII's court; a cabal of Jesuits\u2014but the very proliferation of theories demonstrated how deeply unsatisfying many people found the Stratford story to be. In recent decades, the debate has largely settled down to a dispute between two opposing camps. On one side are the mainstream defenders of the status quo, known as Stratfordians. The anti-Stratfordian movement, meanwhile, backed by books, Web sites and conferences, has coalesced mainly around a single candidate: Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford (1550-1604).\n\nOxfordians, as they are known, dismiss Will of Stratford as a frontman for the ink-stained earl who used his name as a pseudonym. (More or less. Will's surname was often Shakspere but sometimes Shaxspere, Shagspere or Shaxberd, though variants on the spelling of names were hardly uncommon at the time.)\n\n\"Shakespeare the writer, whoever he was, was one of the most broadly educated authors in English literature,\" says Anderson, an avowed Oxfordian. The poet-playwright was steeped in the classics and drew on source texts that hadn\u2019t yet been translated into English. His working vocabulary of more than 17,000 words\u2014twice that of John Milton's according to lexicons compiled for both men in the 19th century\u2014includes nearly 3,200 original coinages. Could such erudition, Anderson asks, really come from a man with, at most, an English grammar-school education?\n\nThere is other circumstantial evidence against \"the Stratford man,\" as Oxfordians condescendingly call Shakespeare. Neither his wife nor his daughter Judith, it appears, were sufficiently literate to write their own names. The man himself is not known to have traveled beyond southern England, yet his plays suggest a firsthand knowledge of the Continent\u2014Italy especially. In Stratford he was known as a businessman and property owner with some connection to the theater, not as a writer. His death attracted no notice in London, and he was buried\u2014beneath a marker that bore no name\u2014in Stratford.\n\nThe glimpses of Shakespeare's character afforded by the few surviving legal documents from his life, moreover, don't square with the current popular notion of a wise and lofty-minded poet. He apparently sued over debts as small as two shillings. A London acquaintance once sought his arrest, along with that of some other men, \"for fear of death.\" And in 1598, he was accused of hoarding grain in Stratford during a famine, prompting a furious neighbor to demand that he and his fellow profiteers be \"hanged on gibbets at their own doors.\" Then there is his will (a centerpiece of the Yale exhibition), in which he bequeathed to his wife his \"second best bed.\" As poet and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote in 1850, \"Other admirable men have led lives in some sort of keeping with their thought, but this man in wide contrast.\"\n\nThe two portraits of Shakespeare that have been widely accepted as authentic have probably contributed to the doubts. The best-known\u2014an image instantly recognizable today\u2014is a posthumous engraving made by Martin Droeshout, a none-too-talented Dutch artist of the early 1600s. It appeared on the title page of the First Folio, the massive compilation of plays by Mr. William Shakespeare published by John Heminges and Henry Condell, fellow actors and longtime friends of the Bard, in 1623, seven years after his death (see \"Folio, Where Art Thou?\"). In Droeshout's anatomically awkward rendering, which he likely copied from a life portrait that no longer exists, the subject looks distant and slightly uncomfortable, as though he'd rather not be posing at all. The second generally accepted portrait, also posthumous, is a memorial bust in Stratford's Trinity Church, which many find even more disconcerting than Droeshout's engraving. Critic J. Dover Wilson likened the well-fed, vacant-looking man in the carving to \"a self-satisfied pork-butcher.\" The two portraits, Wilson wrote in his 1932 biography The Essential Shakespeare, are \"so obviously false images of the greatest poet of all time that the world turns from them in disgust.\" Wilson seems to have been overstating matters, for evidently both likenesses were acceptable to Shakespeare's own friends and family.\n\nIn the years following these two early efforts at depicting him, Shakespearean portraiture became something of a cottage industry. \"New portraits turn up quite often,\" says curator Tarnya Cooper in London. \"In the last three months, I've had three.\" So far, all have been deemed fabrications or portraits of someone else. Last year, a scientific examination revealed that one of the most familiar likenesses of the playwright, the Royal Shakespeare Company's so-called Flower portrait\u2014once thought to have been done in the Bard's lifetime and to have perhaps been the source of the Droeshout engraving\u2014was actually concocted in the 19th century. In 1988, the subject of another rendering, the Folger Shakespeare Library's Janssen portrait, inscribed with the date 1610, proved to be hiding a full head of hair; the subject's domelike forehead was a paint-over added in the 17th or 18th century.\n\nThough Cooper can't affirm that any of the \"Searching for Shakespeare\" portraits were painted from life, she labels as \"pretty high\" the odds that a living, breathing William Shakespeare posed for the National Portrait Gallery's own Chandos portrait, which she calls \"our Mona Lisa.\" The undated painting is attributed to an obscure English artist and possible bit actor of Shakespeare's day named John Taylor. A succession of owners since the mid-1600s have deemed it an authentic portrait of Shakespeare, and it was the first work the gallery acquired at its founding in London in 1856. The portrait's swarthy, somewhat lugubrious subject didn't look sufficiently \"English\" to a few of the Bard's early admirers, however. \"Our author exhibits the complexion of a Jew, or rather of a chimney-sweeper in the jaundice,\" complained an 18th-century editor named George Steevens.\n\nThe search for an authentic image of Shakespeare, like the search for revelations about his life, is guided in part by what we hope to find: we hope he flirted with Queen Elizabeth, but he probably didn't. We hope he didn't hoard grain, but he probably did. This may explain the popularity of two of the eight highlighted portraits in the exhibition. Both the Grafton portrait (1588) and the Sanders portrait (1603) depict sensuous young men, neither of whom has any substantial claim to being Shakespeare. For the frontispiece of The Essential Shakespeare, J. Dover Wilson chose the Grafton, confessing that he couldn't help but wish that \"the unknown youth of the wonderful eyes and the oval Shelley-like face\" was in fact the young poet. And literary critic Harold Bloom announced in Vanity Fair in 2001 that he preferred the \"livelier\" Sanders to traditional portraits.\n\nBut \"Searching for Shakespeare\" includes one portrait about which there is no doubt whatsoever: it is of Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford. That he appears a more dashing and self-assured figure than any of the Shakespeares on display is not, of course, why Oxfordians find him the more plausible candidate\u2014though it probably doesn't hurt. Fourteen years Shakespeare's senior, Oxford was an urbane, multilingual dandy, well educated, well traveled and well connected. At 12, when his father died, he was taken in by William Cecil, later Lord Burghley, who for more than 40 years was Queen Elizabeth's most trusted adviser. He became Oxford's father-in-law when Oxford, at 21, married Burghley's daughter, Anne Cecil. At court, he won attention as a jousting champion, clotheshorse and ladies' man. \"The Queen's Majesty delighteth more in his personage and his dancing and his valiantness than any other,\" another young aristocrat, the future Earl of Shrewsbury, wrote of the 21-year-old earl.\n\nOxford's many enemies, however, described him variously as a whoring, hot-tempered bully, a dissolute spendthrift and a flatulent pederast. At 17, he used his sword to kill an under-cook in Burghley's household (supposedly in self-defense). And at 24, he abandoned his wife for the Continent for more than a year. As for his poetry, Oxford biographer Alan H. Nelson, emeritus professor of English at the University of California at Berkeley and a Stratfordian, ranks it \"from absolutely dreadful to middling.\"\n\nIn his own time, at least, Oxford's poetry won praise. So did his skill as a playwright, though none of his dramas survive. Some modern-day advocates claim that it would have been unseemly for a high-ranking nobleman to write plays openly for the hugely popular, sometimes rowdy Elizabethan public theater. And, they say, playwrights who satirized the powerful too obviously could find themselves jailed or worse.\n\nRichard Whalen, author of Shakespeare\u2014Who Was He? (which answers its title's question as, unquestionably, the Earl of Oxford), allows that the earl's identity as the real Shakespeare had to have been known to a number of theater-world insiders, among them an accommodating Will. Nonetheless, Whalen argues, one needn't posit the existence of a grand conspiracy that concealed Oxford's role. \"His authorship was probably an open secret,\" says Whalen, who, like his fellow Oxfordian Mark Anderson, is unaffiliated with a university. The powers that be could pretend they didn't know a nobleman was stooping to farce and, worse, critiquing his peers. As for the general public, he says, \"They weren't all that interested in who wrote the plays they went to.\"\n\nLinks between Oxford and Shakespeare are not hard to find. The oldest of Oxford's three daughters was once offered in marriage to the 3rd Earl of Southampton, to whom Shakespeare dedicated his two long narrative poems, \"Venus and Adonis\" and \"The Rape of Lucrece.\" (He declined.) Another daughter was married to one of the two earls to whom the First Folio was dedicated.\n\nOxford supporters find other evidence in the plays themselves. In Hamlet and King Lear, for example, they hear the voice of an aristocrat, not a commoner. \"The plays demonstrate a keen, intimate knowledge of how people in a royal court or a government bureaucracy think and operate,\" says Whalen. \"Yes, great writing is always a creative process, but a writer's best works are products of their own experiences. Think of Tolstoy, who wrote about what he knew best: his family, Russia, war. I would argue the Earl of Oxford's life fits the profile of someone you would expect to have written the works of Shakespeare.\"\n\nOxfordian Mark Anderson finds other clues in Shakespeare's settings, plots and characters. He discerns in Hamlet, for instance, elements drawn from Oxford\u2019s life. \"Polonius is a caricature of Oxford's father-in-law, Lord Burghley, who was known to be rather prolix and tedious,\" he says. \"Burghley, like Polonius, once sent spies to check up on his own son.\" Ophelia is Burghley's daughter, whom Oxford/Hamlet woos, and so on.\n\nAs persuasive as their case may be, even the most ardent Oxfordians must admit there isn't a scrap of real evidence tying their man to Shakespeare's work. And how to explain Ben Jonson's eulogy of the \"Sweet Swan of Avon,\" in the First Folio? \"...Soule of the Age! The applause! delight! the wonder of our Stage!...Thou art a Monument, without a tombe, / And art alive still, while thy Booke doth live, / And we have wits to read, and praise to give.\"\n\nBy and large, orthodox Stratfordians\u2014a group that includes the vast majority of historians and English professors with an interest in Shakespeare\u2014dismiss Oxford's champions as wishful thinkers who ignore or misread historical evidence. It's natural, they say, that we yearn for traces of our most revered writer\u2014a signed love sonnet on parchment, at least, if not a complete first draft of Macbeth. But finding their absence suspicious, they say, reveals basic misunderstandings about life during the English Renaissance.\n\n\"In his own time, Shakespeare wasn't thought of as a universal genius,\" says Marjorie Garber, professor of English and visual studies at Harvard University and the author of several books on Shakespeare, including Shakespeare After All (2004). \"Nobody was about to save a laundry list he wrote so they could sell it on eBay. It wasn't that kind of culture.\" Paper, typically handmade in France, was scarce and expensive; when it was no longer needed, it was reused\u2014to line a baking dish, perhaps, or stiffen a book cover. Letter-writing and diary-keeping were unusual, especially for commoners. As for play manuscripts, Garber says, \"Once they were set in type, there was certainly no reason to save them.\" Even in print, plays were considered something less than literature. When Thomas Bodley set up the Bodleian library at Oxford University in Shakespeare's time, she points out, he refused to include play texts. \"These were considered trash, like pulp fiction.\"\n\nOne by one, mainstream scholars knock down the Oxfordians' debating points. No, Stratford wasn't an uncultured backwater; a lord mayor of London and an archbishop of Canterbury had both come from there. No, a Stratford grammar-school graduate wasn't akin to a seventh-grade dropout of today. The Greek and Latin classics echoed in the plays were a standard part of the grammar-school curriculum. Shakespeare may never have visited Italy, but neither he nor anyone else during the Renaissance ever set foot in ancient Greece or Rome either, and that did not rule out the Classical world as a popular setting for poetry and drama. And no, you didn't have to be a nobleman to write about kings and queens. Writers of every stripe did so\u2014it's what the Elizabethan public demanded.\n\n\"In the end, what sets Shakespeare apart from his contemporaries is the sheer range of his style and his subject matter,\" says the University of Warwick's Jonathan Bate. \"He was great in comedy and tragedy and history. He could write about the court, and he could write about ordinary people.\" A play doesn\u2019t have to be autobiographical, Bate suggests, any more than a sonnet has to be confessional. \"Shakespeare always kept himself well disguised. He didn't insert his own opinions, and he steered away from the topical controversies of the day. That's why it's so easy for directors and filmmakers today to make his plays contemporary. It's the key to his endurance.\"\n\nNor, Bate adds, is it necessary to believe that Shakespeare began writing masterpieces as soon as he picked up a quill. \"There is good evidence that he started by rewriting the works of other dramatists. Lots of his early plays are either collaborative works, where he's a kind of junior partner working with more established dramatists, or they're reworkings of older plays.\" Even the mature plays like Hamlet and King Lear, Bate says, drew on existing works for their plots. \"In his time, originality wasn't especially valued.\"\n\nAs for England not mourning his death, that's not surprising either. By 1616, Shakespeare was, after all, a middle-class retiree living far from London, and his plays were no longer the latest fashion. \"In his own lifetime and for some time after, Shakespeare is certainly admired and respected, but he's not thought of as unique,\" says Bate. Which is why later writers felt justified in \"improving\" on him. British poet laureate John Dryden shortened Troilus and Cressida in the late 1600s by excising what he called \"that heap of Rubbish, under which so many excellent Thoughts lay wholly bury'd.\" An unnamed critic in the following century scolded Shakespeare \"for ignoring the ancients, for violating decorum by resorting to tragicomedy and supernatural characters, and for using puns and blank verse.\"\n\n\"The idea that he was a completely different order of genius from all his contemporaries only begins in the mid-18th century, with the British Empire taking off and literacy growing,\" says Bate. The apotheosis became official with actor David Garrick's lavish Shakespeare Jubilee, held in Stratford in 1769. For today's public, of course, Shakespeare is to literary genius what Mozart is to music and Leonardo to painting. The authorship debate, says Bate, is a natural consequence of a cult of Shakespeare now deeply rooted in our culture.\n\nHarvard's Marjorie Garber takes an unusually tolerant view of the long-running dispute. \"A lot of people, especially writers, prefer the mystery to an answer,\" she says. Any answer is going to be simply a human of a particular time and place. We regard Shakespeare today, she believes, the way his friend Ben Jonson did in his First Folio tribute\u2014\"He was not of an age, but for all time!\"\u2014and asks whether we really want to see him reduced to an ordinary mortal. \"Many people prefer to keep the idea of a transcendent, universal Shakespeare,\" she says. Garber likes to cite a remark Charles Dickens made to a friend in 1847: \"The life of Shakespeare is a fine mystery, and I tremble every day lest something should turn up.\"\n\nMassachusetts freelancer Doug Stewart wrote about the destruction of Pompeii in the February 2006 issue of SMITHSONIAN.\n\nGet the latest Travel & Culture stories in your inbox."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Shakespeare/Shakespeares-sources", "page_content": "Shakespeare\u2019s sources\n\nWith a few exceptions, Shakespeare did not invent the plots of his plays. Sometimes he used old stories (Hamlet, Pericles). Sometimes he worked from the stories of comparatively recent Italian writers, such as Giovanni Boccaccio\u2014using both well-known stories (Romeo and Juliet, Much Ado About Nothing) and little-known ones (Othello). He used the popular prose fictions of his contemporaries in As You Like It and The Winter\u2019s Tale. In writing his historical plays, he drew largely from Sir Thomas North\u2019s translation of Plutarch\u2019s Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans for the Roman plays and the chronicles of Edward Hall and Holinshed for the plays based upon English history. Some plays deal with rather remote and legendary history (King Lear, Cymbeline, Macbeth). Earlier dramatists had occasionally used the same material (there were, for example, the earlier plays called The Famous Victories of Henry the Fifth and King Leir). But, because many plays of Shakespeare\u2019s time have been lost, it is impossible to be sure of the relation between an earlier, lost play and Shakespeare\u2019s surviving one: in the case of Hamlet it has been plausibly argued that an \u201cold play,\u201d known to have existed, was merely an early version of Shakespeare\u2019s own.\n\nShakespeare was probably too busy for prolonged study. He had to read what books he could, when he needed them. His enormous vocabulary could only be derived from a mind of great celerity, responding to the literary as well as the spoken language. It is not known what libraries were available to him. The Huguenot family of Mountjoys, with whom he lodged in London, presumably possessed French books. Moreover, he seems to have enjoyed an interesting connection with the London book trade. The Richard Field who published Shakespeare\u2019s two poems Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, in 1593\u201394, seems to have been (as an apprenticeship record describes him) the \u201cson of Henry Field of Stratford-upon-Avon in the County of Warwick, tanner.\u201d When Henry Field the tanner died in 1592, John Shakespeare the glover was one of the three appointed to value his goods and chattels. Field\u2019s son, bound apprentice in 1579, was probably about the same age as Shakespeare. From 1587 he steadily established himself as a printer of serious literature\u2014notably of North\u2019s translation of Plutarch (1595, reprinted in 1603 and 1610). There is no direct evidence of any close friendship between Field and Shakespeare. Still, it cannot escape notice that one of the important printer-publishers in London at the time was an exact contemporary of Shakespeare at Stratford, that he can hardly have been other than a schoolmate, that he was the son of a close associate of John Shakespeare, and that he published Shakespeare\u2019s first poems. Clearly, a considerable number of literary contacts were available to Shakespeare, and many books were accessible.\n\nThat Shakespeare\u2019s plays had \u201csources\u201d was already apparent in his own time. An interesting contemporary description of a performance is to be found in the diary of a young lawyer of the Middle Temple, John Manningham, who kept a record of his experiences in 1602 and 1603. On February 2, 1602, he wrote:\n\nAt our feast we had a play called Twelfth Night; or, What You Will, much like The Comedy of Errors, or Menaechmi in Plautus, but most like and near to that in Italian called Inganni.\n\nThe first collection of information about sources of Elizabethan plays was published in the 17th century\u2014Gerard Langbaine\u2019s Account of the English Dramatick Poets (1691) briefly indicated where Shakespeare found materials for some plays. But, during the course of the 17th century, it came to be felt that Shakespeare was an outstandingly \u201cnatural\u201d writer, whose intellectual background was of comparatively little significance: \u201che was naturally learn\u2019d; he needed not the spectacles of books to read nature,\u201d wrote John Dryden in 1668. It was nevertheless obvious that the intellectual quality of Shakespeare\u2019s writings was high and revealed a remarkably perceptive mind. The Roman plays, in particular, gave evidence of careful reconstruction of the ancient world.\n\nThe first collection of source materials, arranged so that they could be read and closely compared with Shakespeare\u2019s plays, was made by Charlotte Lennox in the 18th century. More complete collections appeared later, notably those of John Payne Collier (Shakespeare\u2019s Library, 1843; revised by W. Carew Hazlitt, 1875). These earlier collections have been superseded by a seven-volume version edited by Geoffrey Bullough as Narrative and Dramatic Sources of Shakespeare (1957\u201372).\n\nIt has become steadily more possible to see what was original in Shakespeare\u2019s dramatic art. He achieved compression and economy by the exclusion of undramatic material. He developed characters from brief suggestions in his source (Mercutio, Touchstone, Falstaff, Pandarus), and he developed entirely new characters (the Dromio brothers, Beatrice and Benedick, Sir Toby Belch, Malvolio, Paulina, Roderigo, Lear\u2019s fool). He rearranged the plot with a view to more-effective contrasts of character, climaxes, and conclusions (Macbeth, Othello, The Winter\u2019s Tale, As You Like It). A wider philosophical outlook was introduced (Hamlet, Coriolanus, All\u2019s Well That Ends Well, Troilus and Cressida). And everywhere an intensification of the dialogue and an altogether higher level of imaginative writing transformed the older work.\n\nBut, quite apart from evidence of the sources of his plays, it is not difficult to get a fair impression of Shakespeare as a reader, feeding his own imagination by a moderate acquaintance with the literary achievements of other men and of other ages. He quotes his contemporary Christopher Marlowe in As You Like It. He casually refers to the Aethiopica (\u201cEthiopian History\u201d) of Heliodorus (which had been translated by Thomas Underdown in 1569) in Twelfth Night. He read the translation of Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses by Arthur Golding, which went through seven editions between 1567 and 1612. George Chapman\u2019s vigorous translation of Homer\u2019s Iliad impressed him, though he used some of the material rather sardonically in Troilus and Cressida. He derived the ironical account of an ideal republic in The Tempest from one of Montaigne\u2019s essays. He read (in part, at least) Samuel Harsnett\u2019s Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostors and remembered lively passages from it when he was writing King Lear. The beginning lines of one sonnet (106) indicate that he had read Edmund Spenser\u2019s poem The Faerie Queene or comparable romantic literature.\n\nHe was acutely aware of the varieties of poetic style that characterized the work of other authors. A brilliant little poem he composed for Prince Hamlet (Act V, scene 2, line 115) shows how ironically he perceived the qualities of poetry in the last years of the 16th century, when poets such as John Donne were writing love poems uniting astronomical and cosmogenic imagery with skepticism and moral paradoxes. The eight-syllable lines in an archaic mode written for the 14th-century poet John Gower in Pericles show his reading of that poet\u2019s Confessio amantis. The influence of the great figure of Sir Philip Sidney, whose Arcadia was first printed in 1590 and was widely read for generations, is frequently felt in Shakespeare\u2019s writings. Finally, the importance of the Bible for Shakespeare\u2019s style and range of allusion is not to be underestimated. His works show a pervasive familiarity with the passages appointed to be read in church on each Sunday throughout the year, and a large number of allusions to passages in Ecclesiasticus (Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach) indicates a personal interest in one of the deuterocanonical books."}, {"url": "https://www.shakespeare.org.uk/explore-shakespeare/shakespedia/william-shakespeare/shakespeare-authorship-question/", "page_content": "Created in collaboration with Warwick Business School, University of Warwick as part of our Massive Open Online Course, 'Shakespeare and His World'.\n\nTranscript\n\nReid: Hi, I'm Jennifer Reid, and I am the course mentor on Shakespeare and His World. I'm here today with Jonathan [Bate] to talk about the authorship question. We're in week one of Shakespeare and His World, and it's bound to have come up by now. So we'd like to just address the question in person and put it to bed once and for all.\n\nBate: OK, thanks very much, Jen. Yeah, this is the one that if you're a Shakespeare scholar, and you get in a taxi anywhere in the world, the first question is, \"So, was Shakespeare really Shakespeare? Was it the man from Stratford?\" Well, the answer to that is yes.\n\nThe thing about any kind of scholarship is that you begin with the evidence. And there is ample evidence that William Shakespeare, a man from Stratford-upon-Avon, and born in this place, became an actor, became a playwright, then eventually returned to Stratford and died.\n\nBehind me on the wall is a facsimile of his bust in Holy Trinity Church here in Stratford, in which he's got his hand on a piece of paper. In the other hand, there would have been a quill, although, over time, the quill tended to be stolen and had to be replaced. And underneath that bust, there's also an inscription. This was the bust put there - his monument above his grave - very soon after his death. And on that inscription, it describes him as having the greatest intellect since Socrates in ancient Greece, and being the greatest poet since Virgil in ancient Rome.\n\nThere's pretty strong evidence that Stratford, his family, his neighbours, remembered him as a great writer. And there's so much more evidence than that, that the writer was the actor, the actor was the man from Stratford.\n\nI've got In front of me here a facsimile of the First Folio. We'll be talking more about Shakespeare in print and the First Folio throughout the course. But early on in the book is a wonderful poem in praise of Shakespeare by Ben Jonson. Ben Jonson; friend, rival, fellow actor, fellow playwright. And he describes Shakespeare there, in that poem, as \"the sweet swan of Avon.\"\n\nHe makes it clear that his fellow writer, the author of these 36 plays is a writer from by the river Avon. Shakespeare, known as a man from Stratford. And what's more, Jonson was very involved in the production of the First Folio. He worked closely with Shakespeare's fellow actors, John Heminges and Henry Condell, the leading surviving actors from his time. They're the ones who put together the First Folio, and they talk about Shakespeare as a writer. Indeed, Jonson talks in his conversations with other writers in his notebooks about Shakespeare's techniques of writing.\n\nOf course, Heminges and Condell, the fellow actors, are remembered in the will of Shakespeare, the man from Stratford. So there's a tight nexus of relationships between these people. There are all sorts of other local details as well. For example, the fact that Shakespeare got into print with \"Venus and Adonis\", his narrative poem, the most popular poem of the age, the poem that made his name.\n\nThat was printed by Richard Field, a fellow schoolboy from the grammar school here in Stratford.\n\nReid: The First Folio was published after Shakespeare's death. Are there any references to him during his lifetime by other authors?\n\nBate: Yes, indeed. Throughout his life, there are a range of people who refer to Shakespeare as a writer, and indeed as a great writer. I've got a fascinating book here. It's called Wits Commonwealth. It was published in 1598, so quite early in Shakespeare's career, by a man called Francis Meres, who was very keen on literature. He wanted to give a sense of the greatness, the dignity, of all the new English literature being written in the 1590s, in his time. He wants to say that British writers are as good as those of classical antiquity.\n\nSo we find him here, for example, saying that just as the Latin tongue, the Latin language was glorified by great writers like Virgil, and Ovid, and Horace, so the English language has been glorified by the wonderful poetry of Sir Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser, Samuel Daniel, Michael Drayton, William Warner, Shakespeare, Marlowe, and Chapman.\n\nSo Shakespeare there, in the company of other writers. And indeed, Meres goes on a few pages later to say that \"The greatness of Shakespeare as a writer was the range of his work.\" Not only his poems, which Meres suggests are like those of the Roman poet Ovid, but also his comedies and tragedies.\n\n\"Shakespeare, among the English, is the most excellent in both kinds for the stage\", both comedy and tragedy. \"For comedy, witness his Two Gentlemen of Verona, his Comedy of Errors, Love's Labours Lost, Love's Labours Won\" (that's a lost play) \"Midsummer Night's Dream, Merchant of Venice. And for tragedy, his Richard II, Richard III, Henry IV, King John, Titus Andronicus, and Romeo and Juliet.\"\n\nNow, you might say, if you're a conspiracy theorist, well, that's only saying that these works were performed and published with the name William Shakespeare on the page. Maybe he was just a stooge, just a front man, and someone else actually wrote them. And, of course, over the years there have been a number of theories of this sort. People like Christopher Marlowe and, indeed, a variety of aristocrats, Lord Bacon, the Earl of Oxford, have been proposed as the true author of Shakespeare. But the intriguing thing about Meres is that he does mention Christopher Marlowe, Francis Bacon, the Earl of Oxford, elsewhere as writers. Yes, these other men did write. But Meres, who seemed to know everybody in the London literary world, is quite clear that they're different people from Shakespeare.\n\nSo the evidence of Meres, and, as I say, a number of other people publishing books in Shakespeare's lifetime praising his poetry, make the connection with the actor, with the man from Stratford.\n\nReid: So what is the strongest piece of evidence we have that Shakespeare the actor from Stratford-upon-Avon was the Shakespeare that wrote the plays?\n\nBate: OK, well, we've seen the evidence from Stratford itself -- the bust. We've seen the evidence of his fellow actors. But in terms of external verification -- again, scholarship always looks for external verification. That's a way of obviating the idea that, oh, it was all a conspiracy, and Ben Jonson and Shakespeare's family were all in on it. But I think the most fascinating piece of external verification is the combination of these two things, a document and a book.\n\nAs we'll discover later in the course, Shakespeare was very concerned with the fact that his father's reputation had decayed as a result of financial problems. And Shakespeare was very keen to restore the good name of his family. So acting on behalf of his family, he managed to get a coat of arms for the family so he could call himself a gentleman. And there's a long process, getting a coat of arms. You had to go to an office called the heralds' office. But he duly got it, and the coat of arms is reproduced here. But one of the officials in the heralds' office who gave out these coats of arms said that various people from vulgar backgrounds, sort of insufficiently high-class people, were getting coats of arms. And among them, he said, was Shakespeare the player.\n\nNow, there were two other men in the heralds' office who disagreed, and they defended Shakespeare's right to have a coat of arms on the grounds that his father and mother had a good pedigree in Stratford-upon-Avon. So the complaint about the coat of arms for Shakespeare the player is intimately linked to the references back to Stratford. So nobody doubts that Shakespeare the player, came from Stratford, was the son of John Shakespeare and Mary Arden.\n\nBut the really interesting thing is that one of the two men in the heralds' office who defended Shakespeare the player's right to a coat of arms also spoke about Shakespeare the writer, Shakespeare the poet and dramatist. And what's more, that man was William Camden, one of the most learned men in England. And he'd been Ben Jonson's schoolmaster at Westminster School. He knew the literary scene inside out. And in one of his books, which is a kind of overflow from his history of England \u2013 it was called \"The Remains of a Greater History\" \u2013 he talks about the great writers, the pregnant wits, as he calls them, of his own time. And there's a list of the writers there, and William Shakespeare is bang in the middle of it.\n\nCamden defending Shakespeare the player, coat of arms, Camden saying Shakespeare the writer. That's the golden bullet.\n\nReid: Well, you certainly convinced me. If there is such strong evidence, why is there this controversy, and when did it start?\n\nBate: Well, that's a great question. I think the way to begin an answer to that is to think about other conspiracy theories. Was there a second gunman assassinating John F. Kennedy? Was Marilyn Monroe secretly murdered? I think the answer is wherever there is great fame and a kind of cult, then inevitably, heresies, alternative views, conspiracy theories tend to emerge. Elvis is alive and well, and that kind of idea.\n\nSo if we ask \u2018When did this begin\u2019, the idea that Shakespeare, the actor from Stratford, was not the author of the plays, the answer is round about the Victorian period. That's to say, for over 200 years after Shakespeare's death, nobody questioned that Shakespeare, the man from Stratford, Shakespeare the player, was Shakespeare the writer. For 200 years the question didn't occur to anybody. Nobody had any doubts. What then happened in the Victorian period is there was a rather eccentric American lady called Delia Bacon who became convinced that Shakespeare couldn't have been Shakespeare, and that maybe someone called Francis Bacon, a famous writer, a famous politician, was Shakespeare. And she started finding all sorts of hidden codes that led her to believe that Bacon was Shakespeare.\n\nShe ended up in a private lunatic asylum not far from Stratford, actually. She had hoped to dig up Shakespeare's bones and find some secret document. But that was sort of where it began. And then it was really in the early twentieth century that other theories emerged. There was a schoolmaster called Thomas Looney who accepted it wasn't Bacon, but again thought; how could this grammar schoolboy from the provinces have known so much about courts and aristocracy?\n\nSo he suggested that it was Edward de Vere, the Earl of Oxford. And then all sorts of other people came forward. Maybe it was the sixth Earl of Derby, or the fifth Earl of Stanley, and so the list goes on. Or even people suggesting maybe Queen Elizabeth or King James wrote the works of Shakespeare.\n\nI'm rather disappointed in both Delia Bacon and Thomas Looney. Delia Bacon was an American. She came from a country where it was supposed to be possible to go from a log cabin to the White House. And equally, Looney was a schoolmaster. And he should have known that the great grammar school education that was available to Shakespeare in Stratford, as it was to other middle-class boys in Shakespeare's time, meant that you could become a great and sophisticated writer without going to university. How did Shakespeare know about the life of the court? Because the acting companies were invited to perform at the court. That was the very rationale of having acting companies.\n\nSo it does seem that a lot of the arguments come down to a kind of snobbery-- the idea that such a great mind could not have come from such a humble background. But I do also think that the other factor is to do with the Romantic movement of the nineteenth century. That's to say, it was with the Romantic poets, with people like Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, John Keats, that you got the idea that a great poet must have a rather glamorous, romantic kind of life.\n\nThe evidence about Shakespeare's actual life is really rather boring. There are all these documents concerning property transactions, a sort of Shakespeare the businessman. For the Romantics, that wasn't really glamorous enough. You know in the Romantic period, the most famous poet in Europe was Lord Byron. And so I think it sort of became inevitable that people would think well, we need Shakespeare to have a bit of glamour, to be a lord.\n\nSo in a way, I think it's a kind of off-shoot of the Romantic movement. Because, of course, it was with the Romantics that the great cult of Shakespeare took off. It was the Romantics who were the first to say, Shakespeare is the greatest genius there has ever been. So in a way, I think the authorship controversy emerged out of a kind of disappointment that the hard evidence of the documents didn't quite have the colour and the glamour to go with the idea of Shakespeare as the quintessential genius.\n\nI think by the later twentieth century, the phenomenon, the controversy was dying away. But then, of course, with the advent of the internet, it came back in a big way. Because, marvellous thing that the internet is, the problem is that there isn't a system of independent verification where you can discover which websites are actually based on evidence, and which are based on conspiracy theory.\n\nSo I'm afraid it's not going to go away. But from our point of view, from the point of view of the course, we feel, on the basis of the evidence we've laid out, other evidence that's available in a number of books that we'll be listing on the course site, the matter is settled. And it's not a matter that we want to discuss further, either within the films or in the forum.\n\nWatch: Prof Carol Rutter and Prof Stanley Wells discuss the authorship question in a video conversation.\n\nListen: Guest speakers on a range of topics in our 60 Minutes with Shakespeare podcast."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/09/john-russell-brown", "page_content": "John Russell Brown, who has died aged 91, was a distinguished Shakespearean scholar who was also involved in practical theatre \u2013 he was a close associate of the director Peter Hall at the National Theatre for 15 years from 1973 \u2013 but was paradoxically opposed to directors filtering the plays though their own ideas, concepts and interpretations.\n\nIn one of his many books, Free Shakespeare (1974), he advocated the primacy of Shakespeare\u2019s musical language in contemporary production, the aspiration of an Elizabethan style of spontaneity in performance and unostentatious decor. He seemed not to see the irony in adopting so idealistic and conceptual an approach himself; his advocacy turned Hall into a reformed classicist and led to austere and unexciting NT productions of Hamlet and Macbeth, both starring Albert Finney, in 1976 and 1978.\n\nAt least he was consistent, seeing no division at all between his response to Shakespeare when he read the plays, taught them in a classroom, saw them in performance, or worked on them in the theatre. As well as his books on Shakespeare\u2019s comedies, tragedies and dramatic style, he prepared new editions of The Merchant of Venice and of John Webster\u2019s two masterpieces, The Duchess of Malfi and The White Devil, and directed productions of the plays in Britain, New Zealand and the US.\n\nIn his field, he was regarded as a pioneer; he took forward the work of Allardyce Nicoll, who in 1951 founded the Shakespeare Institute in Stratford-upon-Avon with a view to working closely with Barry Jackson, who was then running the Shakespeare Festival in the Memorial Theatre in Stratford. This relationship between the academic world and the Royal Shakespeare Company \u2013 exemplified in the career of Russell Brown\u2019s friend and successor, Stanley Wells, who became a governor and vice-chairman of the RSC \u2013 has varied in intensity but is undergoing a renewal in Gregory Doran\u2019s artistic directorship. The Nicoll revolution was to consider Shakespeare not just as text, but as text in performance.\n\nRussell Brown\u2019s scholarly articles in publications such as Shakespeare Survey, Critical Quarterly and the Tulane Drama Review were always worth reading. His 1957 book Shakespeare and His Comedies was one of the first to take the comedies seriously, and his more recent editions Directors\u2019 Shakespeare (2008) and Actors\u2019 Shakespeare (2011) \u2013 with essays by Wells on Judi Dench and Paul Edmondson on Harriet Walter \u2013 are essential documents of the contemporary theatre.\n\nHe edited the Oxford Illustrated History of the Theatre (2001), one of the outstanding books of its kind, with definitive essays by Martin Esslin (on modern theatre 1890-1920), Peter Holland (18th century), Oliver Taplin (Greek theatre) and Peter Thomson (English Renaissance and Restoration drama), Russell Brown himself providing a magisterial, international overview of theatre since 1970. Unlike many Shakespearean scholars, he kept up to date, supporting Hall in his championing of Edward Bond, Howard Brenton and David Hare at the National, and he remained well informed on developments across Europe and in America and Japan.\n\nHe was the second son of Russell Alan Brown, a first world war veteran and pork butcher, and his wife, Olive (nee Golding), a teacher. The family lived above the shop in Gloucester Road, Bristol, and the boys, David and John, were educated at Monkton Combe school, near Bath. David was destined for the church \u2013 he became, eventually, bishop of Guildford. John left school aged 15 and joined the family business but caught the theatre bug at seaside pier shows. When the second world war broke out in 1939, he joined the Fleet Air Arm and was transferred to Scotland, where he serviced Spitfires and luckily avoided a posting on a ship that sank with all hands on board.\n\nAfter the war, he found his way to Keble College, Oxford, where he read English and tutored undergraduates in Anglo-Saxon, supervised by JRR Tolkien. His academic career started at the Shakespeare Institute, where he was a fellow (1951-55), followed by 10 years as an English lecturer at Birmingham University, becoming professor and head of drama and theatre arts at Birmingham from 1964 to 1971. Ever active, ever busy, he was professor of English at Sussex University (1971-82) during his time with Hall. When Richard Eyre succeeded Hall at the NT and appointed Nicholas Wright as his literary manager, Russell Brown concentrated on his writing and was professor of theatre at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (1985-97).\n\nFor Hall, he regarded himself as \u201ca resident researcher and critic in search of plays that surprise me\u201d, and he directed one or two of them himself, including Alegrio Alonso\u2019s Crossing Niagara at the ICA in 1975, Peter Handke\u2019s They Are Dying Out at the Young Vic in 1976 and Barry Collins\u2019s Judgement in the NT\u2019s Cottesloe in 1977, the last of these a searing monodrama for a cannibalistic Russian army officer, played by Ben Kingsley.\n\nTall, affable, industrious and encouraging \u2013 and a keen gardener \u2013 Russell Brown represented the best of the scholar/practitioner/teacher tradition he helped establish in British theatre.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Hilary (nee Baker), whom he married in 1961 when she was a student of his at Birmingham, their three children, Jasper, Alice and Sophie, and nine grandchildren."}]}
