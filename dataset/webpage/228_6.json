That certainly helped fuel them in the regular season, as they went 60-22, tied with the Milwaukee Bucks for the second-best record in basketball.\n\nThe best record belonged to the 68-14 Boston Celtics, who were re-invigorated by a core of Dave Cowens, John Havlicek, and Jo Jo White.\n\nThanks to a first round upset by the Golden State Warriors, the Lakers did not have to see the Bucks during the playoffs, instead breezing through to the NBA Finals. Out East, the Celtics fought it out in a tough seven-game series, but ultimately lost to the New York Knicks.\n\nThis meant it would be Knicks and Lakers for the second straight year. And while it could have been a well-fought series, the Knicks ensured they would not lose again, needing just five games to get past L.A. and win their second title in franchise history.\n\nRoster\n\nNBA regular season statistics\n\nNBA regular season schedule and results\n\nNBA playoffs statistics\n\nNBA playoffs schedule and results"}, {"url": "https://vallely.com/johnvallely.htm", "page_content": "John Vallely:\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nBy Tom Vallely\n\n\n\nJohn Vallely was an All American basketball player at UCLA and was a first round draft choice of the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA in 1971.

During his college days, John was a member of the UCLA Bruins basketball team and participated in two National Championship seasons, 1969 and 1970, under legendary coach John Wooden. John and wife Karen met during college and were married in 1970, the year John graduated with a degree in sociology. The couple had two children: a son, Eric, and a daughter, Erin.

John says he uses Wooden\u2019s Pyramid of Success strategy to deal with his cancer. Wooden\u2019s philosophy, according to Vallely, focuses on success rather than winning. \u201cI have no conflict in my heart about knowing that I am the best I can be and so I have peace of mind,\u201d John says. \u201cSuccess is the absence of conflict. Actually it\u2019s harder to do than winning. It\u2019s possible to win a game without doing your best. But knowing have been the best husband, the best father, the best patient I can, is all I can do.\u201d\n\nSurviving With Strength\n\nA Former UCLA Basketball Star Writes About Dealing with the Loss of a Daughter from Cancer, and Then, Fighting His Own Battle with Lymphoma\n\nBy John Vallely\n\n\n\nA random attack of cancer strikes fear in anyone. Why me? Am I going to die? What did I do wrong? Why did this have to strike my daughter at such a young age? It\u2019s not possible to answer these questions. What matters most, is our response to these life challenges.\n\n\n\nMy experience with cancer began in 1988. My 9- year-old daughter Erin was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma. Surgeons removed a cantaloupe- sized tumor from her abdomen, but were unable to get the entire growth. Until her death in 1991, she endured multiple s u r g e r i e s , chemotherapy and radiation that severely burned her already ill body. I learned so much from her. I miss her.\n\n\n\nIn April 2002, at 53 years old, I was diagnosed with lymphoma. I cannot tell you how astonished I was to learn of my condition. How could this be? Haven't we had enough? My wife and I had already experienced our child dying in our arms. What could be next for us? What about our son Eric? Again I was filled with fear, but once we all began to fight back it gradually subsided.\n\n\n\nThe first step of each patient\u2019s process is correct diagnosis. I believe you must have at least two opinions regarding pathology. If a patient is incorrectly diagnosed, the treatment will not attack their disease. I have spoken with patients who were disappointed with treatment outcome. They later learned that the course of medications would have been different had they researched their circumstances more thoroughly. Consensus on diagnosis is good. Differing opinions lead to better decisions, so patient and family must be proactive and explore options. The relationship with the medical system should be considered a partnership.\n\n\n\nThe next step is launching a plan of attack. After all, this is War! Most things, including my cancer, are not simply about winning and losing. My disease is about the process. I believe it is important to have a positive attitude. Mine is: \"I will be the best I can be. I will do all that I can do to get well and to help my loved ones. I will follow all of the doctor\u2019s directions. I will do everything in my power to give myself and loved ones every chance to survive this disease. And then I will pray!\"\n\n\n\nI believe \"hope\" is important. One can benefit from faith in something. The mental, physical and spiritual obstacles related to cancer are severe. A positive outlook may not have the power to heal -\u2014 but, then again, it might. I believe, at the very least, it can make the process more manageable. Hope and faith are very personal. I was broken-hearted and disappointed when God did not heal my daughter. Yet, I believe she is in heaven. When I was diagnosed, I was angry with God. My lonely walks on the beach brought on another series of questions: What kind of God are you? Do you care? What do you want with my family? Even so, I never gave up my trust that God is watching over Erin.\n\n\n\nMy journey forward has been steady but difficult. It requires a willingness to participate on so many levels and I\u2019m always seeking answers. I believe that the process will lead to living my life at the highest level, regardless of the outcome. Prayer and reflection are part of my daily vigilance. I am grateful that doctors, nurses, chemotherapy, and other drugs are available. I consider these to be gifts from God. I also believe this is part of a grand plan that will give me, the cancer patient, an opportunity to fight and a chance to get well.\n\n\n\nWhen our daughter Erin died my wife, Karen, and I made our decision to fight back. We joined with others in an organization called the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation (PCRF) to raise funds for research aimed at curing pediatric cancer. I\u2019m a past president of PCRF, and currently a member of the PCRF board of directors. Karen spends countless hours on the PCRF Holiday Card Program \u2014 their major fund raising activity for the last 20 years. Our family shares the goals of PCRF.\n\n\n\nRaising funds to support research will help fight this terrible disease. Over the last 20 years the survival rate for children with cancer has more than doubled because of research. Regardless of the outcome of my disease, I know that we are making a difference in this big battle, that we are committed until cancer is defeated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links John Vallely Motivates\n\nLatest News Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "http://www.vallely.com/johnvallely.htm", "page_content": "John Vallely:\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nBy Tom Vallely\n\n\n\nJohn Vallely was an All American basketball player at UCLA and was a first round draft choice of the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA in 1971.

BOTTOM: Henry Bibby, Terry Schofield, Andy Hill.\n\nJohn Vallely Today\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Vallely, age 53, was raised in Orange County and now lives in Newport Beach. During his college days, John was a member of the UCLA Bruins basketball team and participated in two National Championship seasons, 1969 and 1970, under legendary coach John Wooden. John and wife Karen met during college and were married in 1970, the year John graduated with a degree in sociology. The couple had two children: a son, Eric, and a daughter, Erin. When Erin was 9 years old she was diagnosed with cancer, and eventually lost her battle, at the age of 12, in 1991. Since then, John and Karen have been committed to fighting pediatric cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, John is completing treatment for his own illness, lymphoma, and is very optimistic about his recovery. John says he uses Wooden\u2019s Pyramid of Success strategy to deal with his cancer. Wooden\u2019s philosophy, according to Vallely, focuses on success rather than winning. \u201cI have no conflict in my heart about knowing that I am the best I can be and so I have peace of mind,\u201d John says. \u201cSuccess is the absence of conflict. Actually it\u2019s harder to do than winning. It\u2019s possible to win a game without doing your best. But knowing have been the best husband, the best father, the best patient I can, is all I can do.\u201d\n\nSurviving With Strength\n\nA Former UCLA Basketball Star Writes About Dealing with the Loss of a Daughter from Cancer, and Then, Fighting His Own Battle with Lymphoma\n\nBy John Vallely\n\n\n\nA random attack of cancer strikes fear in anyone. Why me? Am I going to die? What did I do wrong? Why did this have to strike my daughter at such a young age? It\u2019s not possible to answer these questions. What matters most, is our response to these life challenges.\n\n\n\nMy experience with cancer began in 1988. My 9- year-old daughter Erin was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma. Surgeons removed a cantaloupe- sized tumor from her abdomen, but were unable to get the entire growth. Until her death in 1991, she endured multiple s u r g e r i e s , chemotherapy and radiation that severely burned her already ill body. I learned so much from her. I miss her.\n\n\n\nIn April 2002, at 53 years old, I was diagnosed with lymphoma. I cannot tell you how astonished I was to learn of my condition. How could this be? Haven't we had enough? My wife and I had already experienced our child dying in our arms. What could be next for us? What about our son Eric? Again I was filled with fear, but once we all began to fight back it gradually subsided.\n\n\n\nThe first step of each patient\u2019s process is correct diagnosis. I believe you must have at least two opinions regarding pathology. If a patient is incorrectly diagnosed, the treatment will not attack their disease. I have spoken with patients who were disappointed with treatment outcome. They later learned that the course of medications would have been different had they researched their circumstances more thoroughly. Consensus on diagnosis is good. Differing opinions lead to better decisions, so patient and family must be proactive and explore options. The relationship with the medical system should be considered a partnership.\n\n\n\nThe next step is launching a plan of attack. After all, this is War! Most things, including my cancer, are not simply about winning and losing. My disease is about the process. I believe it is important to have a positive attitude. Mine is: \"I will be the best I can be. I will do all that I can do to get well and to help my loved ones. I will follow all of the doctor\u2019s directions. I will do everything in my power to give myself and loved ones every chance to survive this disease. And then I will pray!\"\n\n\n\nI believe \"hope\" is important. One can benefit from faith in something. The mental, physical and spiritual obstacles related to cancer are severe. A positive outlook may not have the power to heal -\u2014 but, then again, it might. I believe, at the very least, it can make the process more manageable. Hope and faith are very personal. I was broken-hearted and disappointed when God did not heal my daughter. Yet, I believe she is in heaven. When I was diagnosed, I was angry with God. My lonely walks on the beach brought on another series of questions: What kind of God are you? Do you care? What do you want with my family? Even so, I never gave up my trust that God is watching over Erin.\n\n\n\nMy journey forward has been steady but difficult. It requires a willingness to participate on so many levels and I\u2019m always seeking answers. I believe that the process will lead to living my life at the highest level, regardless of the outcome. Prayer and reflection are part of my daily vigilance. I am grateful that doctors, nurses, chemotherapy, and other drugs are available. I consider these to be gifts from God. I also believe this is part of a grand plan that will give me, the cancer patient, an opportunity to fight and a chance to get well.\n\n\n\nWhen our daughter Erin died my wife, Karen, and I made our decision to fight back. We joined with others in an organization called the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation (PCRF) to raise funds for research aimed at curing pediatric cancer. I\u2019m a past president of PCRF, and currently a member of the PCRF board of directors. Karen spends countless hours on the PCRF Holiday Card Program \u2014 their major fund raising activity for the last 20 years. Our family shares the goals of PCRF.\n\n\n\nRaising funds to support research will help fight this terrible disease. Over the last 20 years the survival rate for children with cancer has more than doubled because of research. Regardless of the outcome of my disease, I know that we are making a difference in this big battle, that we are committed until cancer is defeated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links John Vallely Motivates\n\nLatest News Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.stadiumtalk.com/s/1980-us-olympic-hockey-team-then-now-b0603bc7cb2a4f48", "page_content": "Where Are They Now: 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team You won't believe what happened to the \"Miracle On Ice\" players after they won the gold.\n\nWhere Are They Now: 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team Is there a greater team accomplishment in sports history than what the U.S. Olympic hockey team did at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York?

Eruzione played one season in the IHL and one season in the AHL before the Olympics, but went undrafted by the NHL and never played professionally after the gold medal.

Chief among them was the void that then three-time NBA Champion, Michael Jordan, left after the three-time NBA Finals MVP unceremoniously retired from the league following a personal tragedy that prompted the Chicago Bulls star to take a temporary hiatus from the sport that had become synonymous with him.\n\nWho won the NBA Championship in 1994 and 1995? The Houston Rockets won the NBA Championship in 1994 and 1995. The Rockets were led by Hakeem Olajuwon.\n\nIn His Airness\u2019 absence, teams, especially the top contenders, scrambled on realizing that the league\u2019s top prize was anyone\u2019s for the taking after having firmly been in Jordan\u2019s and the Bulls\u2019 vice-like grip for the previous three seasons. No team capitalized on this power vacuum more than the Houston Rockets, who led by Hall of Fame center Hakeem \u201cThe Dream\u201d Olajuwon, went on to win the 1993-94 and 1994-95 NBA World Championships against the New York Knicks and Orlando Magic respectively.\n\nBefore going ahead, we wanted you to look at some of the recommendations we\u2019ve picked for NBA fans. These are NBA essentials that all NBA fans should have. You can check out and buy these products from the NBA Store.\n\nGrowing Pains\n\nFor many years, the Houston Rockets were at best considered a second-tier NBA team. Their fortunes however took a turn for the better after selecting highly-touted center Hakeem Olajuwon as the first pick of the 1984 NBA draft. In Olajuwon, the Rockets had identified a centerpiece worth building a championship team around and he, alongside fellow big Ralph Sampson, would form arguably the largest frontcourt duo in NBA history dubbed the \u201cTwin Towers.\u201d\n\nHouston\u2019s decision to bring Hakeem onboard paid dividends immediately and after an impressive rookie season where the ex-University of Houston standout finished second in the NBA Rookie of the Year voting and an even more impressive second season, the Rockets made it to the 1986 NBA Finals where they lost to the Larry Bird-led Boston Celtics in six games.\n\nOlajuwon would continue to get better every year and lead the league in rebounds and blocks per game on numerous occasions, joining the exclusive company of NBA greats Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton as the only players in the league to have done so by that point. Houston would however struggle to find their footing in an ultra-competitive western conference and fail to make it past the first round in four of the five playoff appearances they made since losing to the Celtics in the 1986 NBA Finals.\n\nFrom \u201cChoke City\u201d to \u201cClutch City\u201d\n\nBy the end of 1991-92 season, Olajuwon had admittedly become frustrated with the Rockets for a number of reasons including a bad contract that underpaid him for a player of his stature and Houston\u2019s unwillingness to break bank and surround him with the necessary talent to get them over the hump. The Nigerian-American\u2019s relationship with the franchise deteriorated to the point that it was rumored that the Rockets were actively pursuing a trade on account of the differences, which Olajuwon\u2019s agent had gone on record to describe as \u201cirreconcilable\u201d at the time.\n\nHouston however came to their senses and rather than lose a once in a generation talent like The Dream, opted to make a coaching change by bringing in tactician Rudy Tomjanovich. The Rockets also made some much-needed adjustments to their roster. These decisions paid off and elevated both Olajuwon\u2019s and the team\u2019s play enabling them to set a new franchise record with 55 wins in the 1992-93 season. Houston also made it deeper into the playoffs than in previous seasons with Hakeem, who was entering his prime, finishing second in the regular season MVP voting behind Phoenix Suns legend Charles Barkley.\n\nThe Rockets started their 1993-94 campaign as one of the league\u2019s top contenders, comfortably cruising through the regular season and securing themselves a playoff berth. Their resolve would nevertheless be tested in the second round where after having effortlessly dispatched the Portland Trailblazers 3-1, fell 0-2 to perennial conference rivals, the Phoenix Suns, earning the moniker \u201cChoke City\u201d from local publication The Houston Chronicle.\n\nMotivated by this blatant insult, Olajuwon and company rallied to beat the Suns in seven games earning the nickname \u201cClutch City\u201d from their detractors and a date with the Utah Jazz in the conference finals, who they beat in just five games to secure their first NBA Finals appearance in almost a decade. In the finals, The Rockets lived up to their new label and after a hard-fought seven game series against the New York Knicks, who were led by point guard John Starks and Hakeem\u2019s long-time rival Patrick Ewing, clinched their franchise\u2019s first NBA World Championship.\n\nOlajuwon led the way with 26.9 points per game on 50% shooting and outclassed Ewing in every game to earn the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player award \u2013 the cherry on top of the championship trophy and an acknowledgment of Hakeem\u2019s on-court brilliance.\n\nDouble Clutch\n\nIn an interview with CBS at the beginning of the 1994-95 season, Olajuwon said, \u201cLast year, it was Clutch City. This year, if we win, it will be Double Clutch.\u201d These prophetic words would define Houston\u2019s mission to repeat the fete they had accomplished the previous season and they appeared on course to do just that after opening their campaign with an impressive 9-0 record.\n\nThis development inadvertently made the defending champions complacent to the point that they forgot that they had the proverbial bull\u2019s eye on their backs. What followed was a shocking slump in which the Rockets were simply outworked by their opposition night in and night out culminating in a shocking loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, who then had the worst record in the league.\n\nRecognizing that they were at a crossroads between salvaging their season and possibly failing to even make the playoffs, coach Rudy Tomjanovich went against his initial decision to run it back with his championship-clinching squad as was then constituted and pulled off arguably the biggest trade in franchise history to bring in marksman Clyde \u201cThe Glide\u201d Drexler mid-season from the Portland Trailblazers. This move was initially met with opposition by the old guard who felt a little betrayed after their fellow teammates were traded away for a player in Drexler who unlike them, had yet to prove he could win the big one at his former team. Only long-time friend and fellow University of Houston alum, Olajuwon, appeared sold on the breath of fresh air the shooting guard would bring.\n\nDrexler quickly put those doubts to rest and hit the ground running returning the Rockets to championship form with performance after spectacular performance. The Glide continued to silence his doubters after his fellow \u201cPhi Slama Jama\u201d teammate, Olajuwon, was temporary sidelined by injury by keeping the Rockets afloat en route to clinching the sixth seed with a 47-35 regular season record.\n\nThe postseason provided the Rockets an opportunity to focus on their season-long goal of winning back-to-back championships, which they seized despite facing stiff competition in the western conference. Houston first sent the Utah Jazz packing in five games after being down 2-1 after the first three games then beat the Phoenix Suns in seven games despite trailing 3-1 after four games. The underdogs would then meet top-seeded bitter rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, led by the then just-crowned regular season MVP, David Robinson, in the conference finals. Olajuwon would go on to record arguably his best performance in a playoff series and absolutely dismantle Robinson and his Spurs in six games to book their ticket back to the NBA Finals.\n\nIn the finals, the Rockets squared off against up-and-comers, the Orlando Magic, led by their young dynamic duo of center Shaquille O\u2019Neal and playmaker Penny Hardaway. Their championship experience ultimately proved to be the deciding factor and with Olajuwon\u2019s and Drexler\u2019s undeniable presence coupled with timely performances from guards Kenny \u201cThe Jet\u201d Smith, Sam Cassell and Mario Elie and forward Robert Horry, Houston beat Orlando 4-0 to clinch their second title in just as many seasons.\n\nWith the victory, the Rockets set four NBA records establishing them as one of the best teams in the league\u2019s history. Houston became the first defending NBA champions to keep their title with a sweep and the first team to lose all their playoff home games and still advance on to the next rounds by winning all their road games.\n\nAdditionally, the two-time NBA World Champions also became the first team to bag the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy without home-court advantage in the four playoff rounds since the NBA introduced the 16-team format in 1984 and the first team to beat four 50-win teams in a single postseason in their quest for a championship."}, {"url": "https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/history/timeline/80s-decade.html", "page_content": "1980s: All Eyes Focus on Space Shuttle\n\nAnna Heiney\n\nNASA's John F. Kennedy Space Center\n\nDuring the 1980s, Kennedy Space Center made a critical shift in focus. Instead of moving relatively quickly from one human spaceflight program to another, as in the fast-paced 1960s and 1970s, the spaceport's workforce and facilities now were geared toward preparing and launching a revolutionary new spacecraft that would further advance our capabilities in orbit: the space shuttle.Kennedy was tasked with the vital role of maintaining the \"processing flow\" -- refurbishing and preparing each vehicle between flights, launching it safely, ensuring the safety of orbiter and crew after landing, and returning it to Kennedy's orbiter processing facility to begin the process again. During this decade, the Kennedy team launched 32 flights of the space shuttle, then known as the Space Transportation System (STS).Commander John Young and Pilot Bob Crippen flew aboard Columbia on the Space Shuttle Program's first mission, STS-1.\"Before we did STS-1, there had been some, I guess, things going on in the (United) States that -- the morale of the United States, I don't think, was very high,\" recalled Crippen, who later served as director of Kennedy.\"It was truly a morale booster for the United States, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was welcomed by what I would call our allies abroad. So it was obvious that it was a big deal,\" Crippen said.As 1980 began, work already was well under way readying Columbia for the STS-1 mission, still months away. But at the same time, teams at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station were preparing for the spaceport's first NASA launch of the decade. The Solar Maximum Mission, or \"SolarMax,\" was lofted into space by a Delta rocket Feb. 14, 1980, embarking on a flight to study our sun during the peak of the solar cycle.The first launch of the space shuttle on April 12, 1981, became an iconic moment for NASA and for the nation. Columbia's launch plume was a welcome sight to the Kennedy workforce who had labored for years to reach this point. Liftoff came after a precise, on-schedule countdown.\"Everything was going good. The weather was looking good. About one minute to go, I turned to John. I said, 'I think we might really do it,' and about that time, my heart rate started to go up,\" Crippen said. \"And sure enough, the count came on down, and the main engines started. The solid rockets went off, and away we went.\"Columbia stayed aloft for two days as Young and Crippen kept busy verifying the spacecraft's systems. The final test came April 14 when the orbiter and crew completed the program's first deorbit burn, decelerated out of orbit and glided to a landing, kicking up dust as its main landing gear made contact with the dry lake bed at Edwards Air Force Base in California.The flight's success garnered worldwide attention, even intersecting with early-1980s pop culture. Canadian rock band Rush was so inspired by Columbia's first launch, the group recounted the experience in \"Countdown,\" the closing track on the trio's \"Signals\" album.MTV kicked off its first broadcast at 12:01 a.m. August 1, 1981, with footage of Columbia's countdown and liftoff, the Apollo 11 launch, then the landing on the moon as an astronaut saluted the MTV flag and a voice-over announced, \"Ladies and gentlemen: rock and roll.\"The \"firsts\" ticked by one after another as the Space Shuttle Program progressed. The STS-2 mission marked the first reuse of a space vehicle, as Columbia made its second flight. Sally Ride became the first American woman in space when she flew aboard Challenger in 1983; the next mission was the first to launch and land at night, and included the first African-American astronaut, Guion \"Guy\" Bluford. Challenger was the first orbiter to come home for landing, touching down on Kennedy's Shuttle Landing Facility in 1984 to conclude the STS-41B mission.Another major \"first\" took place on the very next flight, STS-41C, when the crew of Challenger successfully captured, repaired and redeployed the SolarMax spacecraft, prolonging its life in orbit.NASA developed the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite system in order to provide reliable communications for the space shuttle and other spacecraft in low Earth orbit. Today, a total of nine TDRS satellites have been placed in orbit, including six deployed during space shuttle missions and three carried aloft aboard Atlas IIa rockets.Kennedy kept pace as shuttle missions flew with increasing frequency, from only two flights in 1981 to nine in 1985.Then, the nation received a sharp reminder that spaceflight is never routine.Jan. 28, 1986, dawned bitterly cold. Temperatures hovered just a few degrees above freezing as space shuttle Challenger and its seven astronauts lifted off on the STS-51L mission. The flight ended just 73 seconds later when an O-ring in the right solid rocket booster failed, causing a fireball that led to the loss of the vehicle and crew: Commander Francis Scobee, Pilot Michael Smith, Mission Specialists Judith Resnik, Ellison Onizuka and Ronald McNair, and Payload Specialists Gregory Jarvis and Sharon Christa McAuliffe, a teacher.The Kennedy family grieved along with the nation. With a new center director, Forrest S. McCartney, at the helm, the workforce focused its efforts on preparing space shuttle Discovery for the next mission, STS-26. Brevard County roads were packed with spectators on Sept. 29, 1988, as Discovery lifted off on the first flight after the Challenger accident, returning the space shuttle to flight after two-and-a-half years.\"It was a privilege and honor to have been a part of the Kennedy Space Center team during the Return to Flight activities following the Challenger accident,\" McCartney said. \"The KSC shuttle workforce was a world class group of professionals that made their mark on space flight history. I will always be grateful to them for letting me join their team.\"The space shuttle paved the way for scientific research across a wide variety of disciplines, including biology and materials science. The reusable Spacelab research module, Spacelab pallet or Spacelab Multipurpose Experiment Support Structure flew in the payload bay to further expand the vehicle's capacity for in-orbit science.Kennedy closed out the 1980s as busy as ever, with five shuttle missions launched in 1989. On two of those flights, Atlantis deployed spacecraft that made a lasting impact on our understanding of our planetary neighbors: the Magellan spacecraft to Venus and the Galileo probe to Jupiter.President Ronald Reagan set the stage for the future of U.S. human spaceflight in his State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 1984, when he challenged NASA to develop an international, permanently crewed space station.\"A space station will permit quantum leaps in our research in science, communications, and in metals and lifesaving medicines which could be manufactured only in space,\" Reagan stated. \"We want our friends to help us meet these challenges and share in their benefits. NASA will invite other countries to participate so we can strengthen peace, build prosperity, and expand freedom for all who share our goals.\"The experiences and triumphs achieved at Kennedy during the 1980s helped put the agency on course to make Reagan's vision a reality in the decades to come."}, {"url": "https://elitesportsny.com/2018/01/15/new-york-arrows-nassau-coliseum-sports-dynasty/", "page_content": "The New York Arrows run of four straight Major Indoor Soccer League titles started in 1979, one year before the Islanders Stanley Cup dynasty began.\n\nWhen you think about the 43-year pre-renovation history of the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum , the Islanders\u2019 run of four straight Stanley Cups from 1979-80 through 1982-83 is certainly one of the first things that come to mind. That team was loaded with superstars like Mike Bossy, Denis Potvin, Bryan Trottier, Billy Smith, Clark Gillies and Billy Smith.\n\nBut the Islanders weren\u2019t the only dynasty that called the Coliseum home during that era.\n\nA year before the Islanders first championship, the New York Arrows of the brand new Major Indoor Soccer League commenced play during the 1978-79 season.\n\nThe Arrows arrived on the New York area sports scene while the Cosmos were in the middle of their glory days in the original North American Soccer League playing in front of huge crowds at Giants Stadium. So the concept of soccer being played indoors on top of a hockey rink was new to local fans.\n\n\u201cIndoor soccer at the start of the MISL was a monumental shift in the landscape of professional soccer in this country,\u201d said former Arrows goalkeeper Shep Messing. \u201cWe had played an exhibition game in front of a sold-out crowd in Philadelphia the previous year, a USA all-star team against the Russian Army team.\u201d\n\nAfter that successful showcase game, the Major Indoor Soccer League was born and Messing, who had previously played with the Cosmos and won a Soccer Bowl with Pele in 1977, jumped at the chance to return to New York. The league needed a name player that would help spark interest, especially in the biggest market in the country.\n\n\u201cI became the first player signed to join the league,\u201d recalled Messing who left the Cosmos to join the Oakland Stompers in 1978. \u201cThe Arrows meant coming home to New York after playing in Oakland and joining a new league that I believed in.\u201d\n\nMessing was already a familiar name to local sports fans but he would soon have company in that category. The Arrows named Don Popovic as their first ever coach and he put together one of the greatest clubs in American soccer history with players like Messing, Steve Zungul and Branko Segota.\n\nThe Arrows made their debut against the Pete Rose-owned Cincinnati Kids on Dec. 22, 1978, in front of 10,386 fans at the Nassau Coliseum. With the Islanders on the precipice of being a championship team, the Arrows fit right in on Long Island and finished the regular season in second place with a record 16-8. They would go on to beat the Philadelphia Fever in the finals to win the league\u2019s first championship.\n\nZungul quickly became the Arrows\u2019 version of Mike Bossy with a scoring touch second to none. He was the league\u2019s best player and an unstoppable scoring machine. Sports Illustrated would later call him \u201cLord Of All Indoors\u201d and when he was on the field, you paid attention to number seven like you would have when Pele graced the outdoor pitches all over the world.\n\nHe was simply amazing.\n\n\u201cZungul was a gifted player with all the physical tools to become the best player ever to play in the MISL,\u201d said Messing. \u201cQuick, smart, left and right foot, good in the air and instinctual goal scorer.\u201d\n\nZungul was a quiet superstar but certainly lit up the Coliseum scoreboard and was considered a great teammate. However, after that first championship win over Philadelphia, Zungul was not named the finals MVP. That honor went to Messing and Zungul was furious. In fact, things got pretty heated on the bus ride home to Long Island.\n\n\u201cAs a teammate, he was competitive beyond belief,\u201d recalled Messing. \u201cZungul got into a shouting and shoving fight with me saying that he deserved the award. (He was) pretty funny, but a competitor to say the least.\u201d\n\nZungul provided so many memorable moments for the Arrows but the most exciting was when he scored the game-winning goal in the 1981 MISL Championship Game at St. Louis. His tally with thirty seconds left stunned the crowd and gave the Arrows a 6-5 win over the Steamers for title number three.\n\nIt was one of Messing\u2019s favorite moments along with the first championship and any road game that the Arrows played against their biggest rival.\n\n\u201cChampionship in Philly, Championship in the Checkerdome in St. Louis and every game against the Blast in Baltimore,\u201d said Messing regarding the moments he will remember most.\n\nMessing also cherishes the fact that he had Popovic as his head coach. He was to the Arrows what General Manager Bill Torrey and Head Coach Al Arbour were to the Islanders. He was the architect and leader of one of the greatest soccer teams ever assembled.\n\n\u201cDon Popovic was a genius and the perfect man to lead the Arrows to four consecutive MISL championships,\u201d said Messing.\u201d \u201cHe understood the game and created systems to benefit from the rules including changing players on the fly.\u201d\n\nThe nucleus of the Arrows was mainly intact during their run of four straight MISL titles but they also tweaked the roster each year. After the second title, the Arrows were fortunate to add a gifted forward in Frantz St. Lot, now an assistant men\u2019s soccer coach at NYIT on Long Island. A veteran of the NASL, the talented Haitian was excited to join what was already a championship club.\n\nHe also had a feeling that the NASL wasn\u2019t going to be around much longer.\n\n\u201cI knew the league was going to be going under because the money that I wanted I couldn\u2019t get it, said St. Lot. \u201cCoach Popovic spoke with my agent and the next thing you know he says listen they are very very interested in you to play for the New York Arrows. That team was one of the best teams that money can buy.\u201d\n\nThe Arrows also would hire a former Cosmos executive who actually tried to get the two local championship soccer teams to square off against each other.\n\nIn 1981, Krikor Yepremian, the brother of former NFL kicker Garo Yepremian, resigned as the Cosmos Vice-President and General Manager and a week later joined the Arrows as President and General Manager. After Yepremian joined the Arrows, there was a proposal made for the two local clubs to play a home and home series, one game at the Nassau Coliseum and one game on Cosmos turf, presumably at the Meadowlands Arena.\n\n\u201cWe challenged them,\u201d said St. Lot. \u201cIf they want to play us, we got the building. We could play one game at home and one away. There was no response to that.\u201d\n\nThe Cosmos would eventually dabble in the indoor game but there was never a head to head matchup with the Arrows who simply focused on winning games and championships. They combined with the Islanders to spoilsports fans on Long Island with eight titles over a five-season period between 1979 and 1983.\n\nWhile the Coliseum was known as \u201cFort Neverlose\u201d because of the Islanders\u2019 success there, you could have said the same thing about the Arrows time in the barn. It\u2019s not often that two sports teams playing in the same building can enjoy so much success at the same time.\n\nBut the Arrows and Islanders enjoyed dynasties at just about the same time.\n\n\u201cIn that building, what we achieved and what the Islanders achieved I don\u2019t think there could ever be two championship teams like this ever,\u201d said St. Lot.\n\nOne of the neat things about that era was that you could see players from both teams out and about in the community. You might be having dinner at a restaurant and see one of the players from either team or you might run into one of them just walking down the street because they might have lived in your neighborhood.\n\nAs it turns out, the Arrows and Islanders spent some time interacting with fans in the community but also the players from both teams did so much winning and shared so much in common that they forged plenty of friendships along the way.\n\n\u201cThe Islanders and Arrows dominating at the Nassau Coliseum those years was one of the greatest times for Long Island pro sports,\u201d said Messing. \u201cI became friendly and trained with many of those great Islanders like (Bryan) Trottier, (Mike) Bossy, (Clark) Gillies, (Bobby) Nystrom, and Billy Smith. Several of us competed in the ABC \u201cSuperstars\u201d competition in the Bahamas after the season and some of those friendships are lasting today.\u201d\n\nOverall, the Arrows played six seasons in the Major Indoor Soccer League, but their last two campaigns weren\u2019t nearly as successful as the first four.\n\nAfter the fourth championship in 1982, the team was sold and then in January of 1983, the cash-strapped franchise traded Zungul to the San Jose Earthquakes. The Arrows finished in fourth place during their final two seasons and they folded in 1984.\n\nTwo years later, indoor soccer returned to the Coliseum for the 1986-87 MISL season with the expansion New York Express. Shep Messing was a co-owner of that club and he also played but the Express didn\u2019t produce the same magic as the Arrows. They began the season 0-10 and they were 3-23 when they folded at the All-Star break because of financial problems.\n\nOver three decades later, maybe it\u2019s time to give indoor soccer another shot on Hempstead Turnpike.\n\n\u201cI would be the happiest person,\u201d said St. Lot. \u201cI would love to see soccer get back.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not crazy to think it could happen.\n\nAfter the Islanders left the Coliseum for Brooklyn in 2015, the old barn went through a massive renovation and the arena reopened in April 2017 as \u201cNYCB Live, home of the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. The renovated Coliseum has hosted concerts and family shows, Long Island Nets basketball games, one Islanders pre-season game, college basketball and college hockey.\n\nThere\u2019s been some chatter about the Islanders returning to play some if not all of their games over the next few seasons while the Belmont Park Arena is built. It\u2019s also possible that an AHL franchise eventually calls the Coliseum home and there are rumors of an Indoor Lacrosse team coming to Long Island.\n\nIf Messing has his way, there will be another indoor soccer team as well.\n\n\u201cI am still looking to resurrect an indoor pro team on Long Island,\u201d said Messing. \u201cStay tuned.\u201d\n\nIndoor soccer is just the type of sport that could work at NYCB Live. It would be affordable family entertainment and the sport is already part of the Coliseum\u2019s DNA. If and when a new team arrives, it would be cool to have a retro night to honor the Arrows and maybe even retire a few numbers like \u201cMessing-1,\u201d \u201cZungul-7,\u201d and \u201cSegota-20.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s hoping the rocket red ball or any color soccer ball eventually makes its way back to the Coliseum."}, {"url": "https://www.stadiumtalk.com/s/most-nba-playoff-games-a76699fe36cc4e3a", "page_content": "Most Playoff Games in NBA History These players delivered the goods in the postseason.\n\nMost Playoff Games in NBA History There's a big difference between the regular season and playoffs in the NBA. Every possession is magnified in the postseason, and the pressure mounts each game. Some players rise to the challenge and win championships. But it takes more than superstars to get rings in the NBA. The franchises that rack up titles have strong role players on the roster and household names. These players played the most playoff games in NBA history and almost always delivered the goods. They have the glory to prove it.\n\n30. Al Horford \u2014 167 Playoff Games (Tie) Position: Power Forward College: Florida NBA career: 16 seasons (2007-present) Teams: Atlanta Hawks (2007-16), Boston Celtics (2016-19, 2021-present), Philadelphia 76ers (2019-20), Oklahoma City Thunder (2020-21) Height/weight: 6-foot-9, 240 pounds Career highlights: Five-time NBA All-Star (2010, 2011, 2015. 2016. 2018), All-NBA Team (2011), NBA All-Defensive Team (2018), NBA All-Rookie Team (2008), Five-time NBA All-Star (2010, 2011, 2015. 2016. 2018), All-NBA Team (2011), NBA All-Defensive Team (2018), NBA All-Rookie Team (2008) Bottom line: Al Horford has been a steadying presence for NBA teams over the last 20 years. Horford, the son of former NBA forward Tito Horford, has been in the postseason with every team he's played on except the one season he spent with the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2020-21. One thing still missing for Horford? An NBA championship.\n\n30. Sam Perkins \u2014 167 Playoff Games (Tie) Sam Perkins, right, is one of the few players on this list to never win an NBA title. Position: Forward/center College: North Carolina NBA career: 17 seasons (1984-2001) Teams: Dallas Mavericks (1984-90), Los Angeles Lakers (1990-93), Seattle SuperSonics (1993-98), Indiana Pacers (1998-2001) Height/weight: 6-foot-9, 235 pounds Career highlights: NBA All-Rookie Team (1985) Bottom line: Sam Perkins had game. Part of the legendary NCAA championship team at North Carolina in 1982 alongside James Worthy and Michael Jordan, \"Big Smooth\" was snakebit when it came to winning a title in the NBA. Perkins played in the NBA for 17 seasons and and made it to the playoffs 15 times, averaging double figures in points in 12 postseasons. He made the NBA Finals three times, with three different teams, but lost each time.\n\n29. Michael Cooper \u2014 168 Playoff Games Michael Cooper won five NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers. Position: Shooting guard College: New Mexico NBA career: 12 seasons (1978-90) Teams: Los Angeles Lakers Height/weight: 6-foot-5, 175 pounds Career highlights: Five-time NBA champion (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1988), NBA Defensive Player of the Year (1987), eight-time All-NBA Defensive Team (1981-88) Bottom line: Michael Cooper found the perfect fit with the Los Angeles Lakers after an All-American career at the University of New Mexico. He carved out a role as a defensive stopper on some of the greatest teams in NBA history, making eight All-NBA Defensive Teams and being named NBA Defensive Player of the Year in 1987. He also could score when needed and was on the receiving end of many Magic Johnson alley-oop passes during the Showtime era, making the Coop-a-Loop world-famous.\n\n26. Danny Green \u2014 169 Playoff Games (Tie) Position: Shooting guard/small forward College: North Carolina NBA career: 14 seasons (2009-present) Teams: Cleveland Cavaliers (2009-10, 2023-present), San Antonio Spurs (2010-18), Toronto Raptors (2018-19), Los Angeles Lakers (2019-20), Philadelphia 76ers (2020-22), Memphis Grizzlies (2022-23), Cleveland Cavaliers (2023-present) Height/weight: 6-foot-6, 215 pounds Career highlights: Three-time NBA champion (2014, 2019, 2020), NBA All-Defensive Team (2017) Bottom line: Danny Green is one of the biggest winners in basketball history over the last 20 years, first winning an NCAA championship at North Carolina before embarking on a 14-year NBA career that has seen him win three NBA championships with three different teams. Green has never been a passive bystander on those championships and was a key player for the San Antonio Spurs in 2014, Toronto Raptors in 2019 and the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020.\n\n26. Kevin McHale \u2014 169 Playoff Games (Tie) Kevin McHale was named to the NBA's 50th Anniversary Team. Position: Power forward College: Minnesota NBA career: 13 seasons (1980-93) Teams: Boston Celtics Height/weight: 6-foot-10, 210 pounds Career highlights: Three-time NBA champion (1981, 1984, 1986), seven-time NBA All-Star (1984, 1986-91), All-NBA (1987), six-time All-NBA Defensive Team (1983, 1986-90), two-time NBA Sixth Man of the Year (1984, 1985), NBA All-Rookie Team (1981), NBA 50th Anniversary Team Bottom line: Kevin McHale's moves in the post were so hard to stop that opponents called guarding him \"The Torture Chamber.\" He was a key piece on three NBA championship teams for the Boston Celtics in the 1980s. McHale also was one of the NBA's greatest defensive players during his era, making the All-NBA Defensive Team six times.\n\n26. Dennis Rodman \u2014 169 Playoff Games (Tie) Dennis Rodman, left, was one of the greatest defensive players and rebounders in NBA history. Position: Power forward College: Southeastern Oklahoma State NBA career: 14 seasons (1986-2000) Teams: Detroit Pistons (1986-93), San Antonio Spurs (1993-95), Chicago Bulls (1995-98), Los Angeles Lakers (1999), Dallas Mavericks (2000) Height/weight: 6-foot-7, 228 pounds Career highlights: Five-time NBA champion (1989, 1990, 1996-98), two-time NBA All-Star (1990, 1992), two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year (1990, 1991), two-time All-NBA (1992, 1995), eight-time NBA All-Defensive Team (1989-96) Bottom line: Dennis Rodman is one of the greatest defensive players in NBA history and one of the greatest rebounders of all time as well. That success extended to the postseason, where he first made his mark with the Detroit Pistons on the infamous \"Bad Boys\" teams that won back-to-back NBA titles in 1989 and 1990. Rodman one-upped that by joining the Bulls and winning three straight NBA titles from 1996 to 1998.\n\n24. Horace Grant \u2014 170 Playoff Games (Tie) Horace Grant, right, was drafted No. 10 overall by the Chicago Bulls in 1987. Position: Power forward College: Clemson NBA career: 15 seasons (1987-2002) Teams: Chicago Bulls (1987-94), Orlando Magic (1994-99, 2001-02), Seattle SuperSonics (1999-2000), Los Angeles Lakers (2000-01, 2003-04), Orlando Magic (2001-02) Height/weight: 6-foot-10, 215 pounds Career highlights: Four-time NBA champion (1991-93, 2001), NBA All-Star (1994), four-time NBA All-Defensive Team (1993-96) Bottom line: One of the greatest NBA drafts of all time for any single franchise came in 1987 when the Chicago Bulls selected Horace Grant and traded for draft pick Scottie Pippen \u2014 two players who were cornerstones for their dynasty in the 1990s. Grant won three titles with the Bulls in the early 1990s, had playoff success with the Orlando Magic and won another title with the Lakers in 2001.\n\n24. Paul Pierce \u2014 170 Playoff Games (Tie) Paul Pierce should have been nominated for an Emmy for Best Actor for his histrionics in the 2008 NBA Finals. Position: Small forward College: Kansas NBA career: 19 NBA career (1998-2017) Teams: Boston Celtics (1998-2013), Brooklyn Nets (2013-14), Washington Wizards (2014-15), Los Angeles Clippers (2015-17) Height/weight: 6-foot-7, 235 pounds Career highlights: NBA champion (2008), NBA Finals MVP (2008), 10-time NBA All-Star (2002-06), four-time All-NBA (2002, 2003, 2008, 2009), NBA All-Rookie Team (1999) Bottom line: Paul Pierce had one of the best nicknames in NBA history \u2014 \"The Truth.\" And no one in the NBA had more of a green light than him during his first decade in the league. The biggest reason for that was the Celtics didn't surround Pierce with very much talent early in his career. When they did, he thrived. Pierce teamed with Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett to win the 2008 NBA title, bringing home Finals MVP honors.\n\n23. Ray Allen \u2014 171 Playoff Games Ray Allen was one of the greatest shooters to ever step on a basketball court. Position: Shooting guard College: Connecticut NBA career: 18 seasons (1996-2014) Teams: Milwaukee Bucks (1996-2003), Seattle SuperSonics (2003-07), Boston Celtics (2007-12), Miami Heat (2012-14) Height/weight: 6-foot-5, 205 pounds Career highlights: Two-time NBA champion (2008, 2013), 10-time NBA All-Star (2000-02, 2004-09, 2011), two-time All-NBA (2005, 2011), NBA All-Rookie Team (1997) Bottom line: Ray Allen's jump shot was truly a work of art and made him one of the greatest 3-point shooters in NBA history. The reason Allen wound up with so many misses was because he had the absolute green light to put up shots on any team he was on. His corner 3-pointer against the San Antonio Spurs in Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals is one of the most clutch shots in NBA history.\n\n22. John Havlicek \u2014 172 Playoff Games John Havlicek, with ball, was one of the greatest winners in the history of North American professional sports. Position: Guard/forward College: Ohio State NBA career: 16 seasons (1962-78) Teams: Boston Celtics Height/weight: 6-foot-5, 203 pounds Career highlights: Eight-time NBA champion (1963-1966, 1968, 1969, 1974, 1976), NBA Finals MVP (1974), 13-time NBA All-Star (1966-78), 11-time All-NBA (1964, 1966, 1968-76), NBA All-Rookie Team (1963), NBA 50th Anniversary Team Bottom line: John Havlicek was the first true swingman in NBA history \u2014 a player who was indistinguishable from a guard or a forward because he did everything on the floor for both positions. His eight NBA titles trail only teammates Bill Russell and Sam Jones for the most in league history, and he also won an NCAA title playing for Ohio State in 1960.\n\n19. Andre Iguodala \u2014 166 Playoff Games (Tie) Andre Iguodala shocked the world when he was named NBA Finals MVP in 2015. Position: Small forward/shooting guard College: Arizona NBA career: 19 seasons (2004-present) Teams: Philadelphia 76ers (2004-12), Denver Nuggets (2012-13), Golden State Warriors (2013-19, 2021-present), Miami Heat (2020-21) Height/weight: 6-foot-6, 215 pounds Career highlights: Four-time NBA champion (2015, 2017, 2018, 2022), NBA Finals MVP (2015), NBA All-Star (2012), two-time NBA All-Defensive Team (20111, 2014), NBA All-Rookie Team (2005) Bottom line: Andre Iguodala has played almost two decades in the NBA, and when his career is over, it'll be his play in the postseason that people point to first as the biggest part of his legacy. Iguodala caught lightning in a bottle with the Golden State Warriors, where he has won four NBA titles and played in the NBA Finals six times, including winning NBA Finals MVP in 2015. Iguodala made it back to the NBA Finals in 2020 with the Miami Heat.\n\n19. Rasheed Wallace \u2014 177 Playoff Games (Tie) Rasheed Wallace, right, was a force on the basketball court. Position: Power forward College: North Carolina NBA career: 18 seasons (1995-2013) Teams: Washington Bullets (1995-96), Portland Trail Blazers (1996-2004), Atlanta Hawks (2004), Detroit Pistons (2004-09), Boston Celtics (2009-10), New York Knicks (2012-13) Height/weight: 6-foot-10, 230 pounds Career highlights: NBA champion (2004), four-time NBA All-Star (2000, 2001, 2006, 2008), NBA All-Rookie Team (1996) Bottom line: Rasheed Wallace might be a surprising name to see on this list, but he played in 14 postseasons and made the NBA Finals twice, winning once with the Detroit Pistons in 2004. Wallace set the NBA record for technical fouls in a single season with 41 in 2000-01, but he was much more than a hothead with a quick fuse. He had an all-around game and great basketball IQ and became something of an elder statesman for teams in the second half of his career.\n\n19. Dwyane Wade \u2014 177 Playoff Games (Tie) Dwyane Wade was named NBA Finals MVP in 2006. Position: Shooting guard College: Marquette NBA career: 15 seasons (2003-18) Teams: Miami Heat (2003-16, 2018-19), Chicago Bulls (2016-17), Cleveland Cavaliers (2017-18) Height/weight: 6-foot-4, 224 pounds Career highlights: Three-time NBA champion (2006, 2012, 2013), NBA Finals MVP (2006), 13-time NBA All-Star (2005-16, 2019), eight-time All-NBA (2005-07, 2009-13) Bottom line: Dwyane Wade is one of the greatest NBA players of all time, making the All-Star team 13 times in 15 seasons and winning three NBA titles with the Miami Heat. Wade won NBA Finals MVP in 2006 teamed with Shaquille O'Neal, then paired up with LeBron James and Chris Bosh to win two more NBA titles in 2012 and 2013.\n\n18. Michael Jordan \u2014 179 Playoff Games Michael Jordan commissioned a documentary called \"The Last Dance\" that was simply wonderful. Position: Shooting guard College: North Carolina NBA career: 14 seasons (1984-93, 1995-98, 2001-03) Teams: Chicago Bulls (1984-1993, 1995-1998), Washington Wizards (2001-2003) Height/weight: 6-foot-6, 210 pounds Career highlights: Six-time NBA champion (1991-93, 1996-98), six-time NBA Finals MVP (1991-93, 1996-98), five-time NBA MVP (1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1998), 14-time NBA All-Star (1985-93, 1996-98, 2002, 2003), three-time NBA All-Star Game MVP (1988, 1996, 1998), 11-time All-NBA (1985, 1987-93, 1996-98), NBA Defensive Player of the Year (1988), nine-time All-NBA Defensive Team (1988-93, 1996-98), NBA Rookie of the Year (1985) Bottom line: Michael Jordan was a scoring machine his entire career, but in the first six NBA career of his career, almost every offensive possession for the Chicago Bulls ran through His Airness. When Jordan started shooting less and getting his teammates involved more, the Bulls were unstoppable and won six NBA titles. Jordan's playoff games total was impacted somewhat by missing one entire postseason in his prime to play professional baseball.\n\n17. Dennis Johnson \u2014 180 Playoff Games Dennis Johnson died of a heart attack in 2007. Position: Guard College: Pepperdine NBA career: 14 seasons (1976-90) Teams: Seattle SuperSonics (1976-80), Phoenix Suns (1980-83), Boston Celtics (1983-90) Height/weight: 6-foot-4, 185 pounds Career highlights: Three-time NBA champion (1979, 1984, 1986), five-time NBA All-Star (1979-82, 1985), two-time All-NBA (1980, 1981), nine-time All-NBA Defensive Team (1979-87) Bottom line: Dennis Johnson was known as a troublemaker during his time in college and the early part of his NBA career \u2014 but he was also known as a winner. Johnson won an NBA championship with the Phoenix Suns in 1979 and then two more with the Boston Celtics in the mid-1980s as a reliable veteran. Johnson, who died of a heart attack in 2007, was also one of the greatest defensive players in NBA history.\n\n16. John Stockton \u2014 182 Playoff Games John Stockton is the NBA's all-time leader in assists. Position: Point guard College: Gonzaga NBA career: 19 seasons (1984-2003) Teams: Utah Jazz Height/weight: 6-foot-1, 170 pounds Career highlights: 10-time NBA All-Star (1989-97, 2000), NBA All-Star Game MVP (1993), 11-time All-NBA (1988-97, 1999), five-time All-NBA Defensive Team (1989, 1991, 1992, 1995, 1997), NBA 50th Anniversary Team Bottom line: John Stockton played his entire NBA career with the Utah Jazz, teaming with power forward Karl Malone to lead the team to the only two NBA Finals appearances in franchise history. Stockton owns two NBA records by large margins that could never be broken \u2014 career assists (15,806) and steals (3,265). He also was a member of the famed 1992 U.S. Olympic Dream Team.\n\n15. Byron Scott \u2014 183 Playoff Games Byron Scott missed the NBA playoffs just once in 14 seasons. Position: Shooting guard College: Arizona State NBA career: 14 seasons (1983-97) Teams: Los Angeles Lakers (1983-93, 1996-97), Indiana Pacers (1993-95), Vancouver Grizzlies (1995-96) Height/weight: 6-foot-4, 205 pounds Career highlights: Three-time NBA champion (1985, 1987, 1988), NBA All-Rookie Team (1984) Bottom line: Byron Scott won three NBA titles in his first five seasons in the league, all with the Los Angeles Lakers. He only missed the playoffs once in 14 seasons, during his one season with the Vancouver Grizzlies in 1995-96. Scott was also an NBA head coach for 15 seasons, making the NBA Finals in two of his first three seasons with the New Jersey Nets.\n\n14. Robert Parish \u2014 184 Playoff Games The Boston Celtics got Robert Parish in one of the all-time draft heists in NBA history. Position: Power forward College: Centenary NBA career: 21 seasons (1976-97) Teams: Golden State Warriors (1976-80), Boston Celtics (1980-94), Charlotte Hornets (1994-96), Chicago Bulls (1996-97) Height/weight: 7-foot-1, 230 pounds Career highlights: Four-time NBA champion (1981, 1984, 1986, 1997), nine-time NBA All-Star (1981-87, 1990, 1991), two-time All-NBA (1982, 1989), NBA 50th Anniversary Team Bottom line: Robert Parish's 1,611 career games are the most in NBA history, and he was also at the center of one of the greatest trades in NBA history. Celtics president Red Auerbach swapped his No. 1 overall pick in 1980 for Parish and the No. 3 overall pick. The Warriors took all-time draft bust Joe Barry Carroll No. 1, and the Celtics took Hall of Famer Kevin McHale at No. 3. Parish, also known \"The Chief,\" and McHale and company in Boston then helped the Celtics win three NBA titles in the 1980s.\n\n13. Magic Johnson \u2014 190 Playoff Games Magic Johnson could do anything with a basketball. Position: Point guard College: Michigan State NBA career: 13 seasons (1978-91, 1996) Teams: Los Angeles Lakers Height/weight: 6-foot-9, 220 pounds Career highlights: Five-time NBA champion (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1988), three-time NBA Finals MVP (1980, 1982, 1987), three-time NBA MVP (1987, 1989, 1990), 12-time NBA All-Star (1980, 1982-92), two-time NBA All-Star Game MVP (1990, 1992), 10-time All-NBA (1982-91), NBA All-Rookie Team (1980), NBA 50th Anniversary Team Bottom line: Magic Johnson is many things. The greatest point guard of all time. One of the most exciting, dynamic players in NBA history. And a global sports icon. Magic's rivalry with Boston Celtics forward Larry Bird, which started in the 1979 NCAA championship game between Michigan State and Indiana State put the NBA on the path to becoming the global behemoth it is today, generating approximately $8 billion in revenue annually.\n\n11. Karl Malone \u2014 193 Playoff Games (Tied) Karl Malone, left, never won an NBA title. Position: Power forward College: Louisiana Tech NBA career: 19 seasons (1985-2004) Teams: Utah Jazz (1985-2003), Los Angeles Lakers (2003-04) Height/weight: 6-foot-9, 250 pounds Career highlights: Two-time NBA MVP (1997, 1999), 14-time NBA All-Star (1988-98, 2000-02), two-time NBA All-Star Game MVP (1989, 1993), 14-time All-NBA (1988-2001), four-time All-NBA Defensive Team (1988, 1997-99), NBA All-Rookie Team (1986) Bottom line: Karl Malone had the great luck of spending almost his entire career playing alongside point guard John Stockton, a player who could create offense for other players in a variety of ways. Stockton was a perfect complement to the hard-running Malone, who was almost impossible to stop with a head of steam. But Malone, like Stockton, never won an NBA title, losing to the Chicago Bulls in back-to-back seasons in 1997 and 1998.\n\n11. Danny Ainge \u2014 193 Playoff Games (Tied) Danny Ainge played three seasons in the majors before deciding to switch sports and play in the NBA. Position: Shooting guard College: BYU NBA career: 14 seasons (1981-95) Teams: Boston Celtics (1981-89), Sacramento Kings (1989-90), Portland Trail Blazers (1990-92), Phoenix Suns (1992-95) Height/weight: 6-foot-5, 190 pounds Career highlights: Two-time NBA champion (1984, 1986), NBA All-Star (1988) Bottom line: No player in NBA history had the ability to get underneath the skin of his opponents like Danny Ainge. The shooting guard won two NBA titles with the Boston Celtics and played in the NBA Finals two more times with the Portland Trail Blazers and Phoenix Suns. Ainge actually played three years of Major League Baseball with the Toronto Blue Jays before deciding to switch sports and play in the NBA.\n\n10. Scottie Pippen \u2014 208 Playoff Games Scottie Pippen was the NBA's equivalent of Robin to Michael Jordan's Batman. Position: Small forward College: Central Arkansas NBA career: 17 seasons (1987-2004) Teams: Chicago Bulls (1987-98, 2003-04), Houston Rockets (1998-99), Portland Trail Blazers (1999-2003) Height/weight: 6-foot-8, 228 pounds Career highlights: Six-time NBA champion (1991-93, 1996-98) Bottom line: The perfect complement to Michael Jordan during the Chicago Bulls dynasty of the 1990s, Scottie Pippen was also one of the greatest defensive players in NBA history. Pippen and Jordan's Batman and Robin routine produced six championships in nine full NBA seasons together. The run cemented both players as two of the greatest of all time.\n\n9. Shaquille O'Neal \u2014 216 Playoff Games Why was Shaquille O'Neal guarding Hakeem Olajuwon out at the three-point line?

The behemoth center teamed up with Kobe Bryant to win three consecutive NBA titles from 2000 to 2002 and got another title with Dwyane Wade and the Miami Heat in 2006. O'Neal captured one NBA MVP trophy in his career, in 2000, and also won three consecutive NBA Finals MVP trophies.\n\n8. Manu Ginobili \u2014 218 Playoff Games Manu Ginobili didn't play in the NBA until he was 25 years old. Position: Shooting guard College: None NBA career: 16 seasons (2002-18) Teams: San Antonio Spurs Height/weight: 6-foot-6, 205 pounds Career highlights: Four-time NBA champion (2003, 2005, 2007, 2014), two-time NBA All-Star (2005, 2011), two-time All-NBA (2008, 2011), NBA Sixth Man of the Year (2008), NBA All-Rookie Team (2003) Bottom line: Manu Ginobili's career playoff games total would be much higher had he not played the first seven seasons of his career overseas. Ginobili was a sensation once he joined the NBA in 2002, at 25 years old, winning three NBA titles in his first five seasons with the San Antonio Spurs.\n\n7. Kobe Bryant \u2014 220 Playoff Games Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter accident on Jan. 26, 2020. Position: Shooting guard College: None NBA career: 20 seasons (1996-2016) Teams: Los Angeles Lakers Height/weight: 6-foot-6, 212 pounds Career highlights: Five-time NBA champion (2000-02, 2009, 2010), two-time NBA Finals MVP 2009, 2010), NBA MVP (2008), 18-time NBA All-Star (1998, 2000-16), four-time NBA All-Star Game MVP (2002, 2007, 2009, 2011), 15-time All-NBA (1999-2013), 12-time NBA All-Defensive Team (2000-04, 2006-12) Bottom line: The late Kobe Bryant's legacy was defined by him being a winner. He won five NBA titles in 20 seasons. He also missed the playoffs five times. In the final game of his career, Bryant scored 60 points on 22-of-50 shooting in a 101-96 win over the Utah Jazz, including 10-of-12 from the free-throw line and 6-of-21 from beyond the three-point arc.\n\n6. Tony Parker \u2014 226 Playoff Games Tony Parker started playing professional basketball in France when he was 17 years old. Position: Point guard College: None NBA career: 18 seasons (2001-19) Teams: San Antonio Spurs (2001-18), Charlotte Hornets (2018-19) Height/weight: 6-foot-2, 185 pounds Career highlights: Four-time NBA champion (2003, 2005, 2007, 2014), NBA Finals MVP (2007), six-time NBA All-Star (2006, 2007, 2009, 2012-14), four-time All-NBA (2009, 2012-14), NBA All-Rookie Team (2002) Bottom line: Tony Parker played two seasons of professional basketball in his native France before joining the San Antonio Spurs in 2001 at just 19 years old. Parker never missed a postseason in 17 seasons with the Spurs and won four NBA championships, earning NBA Finals MVP in 2007. Parker was also married to the Spurs' greatest celebrity fan of all time, actress Evan Longoria, from 2007 to 2010.\n\n5. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar \u2014 237 Playoff Games Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won his first NBA title with the Milwaukee Bucks. Position: Center College: UCLA NBA career: 20 seasons (1969-1989) Teams: Milwaukee Bucks (1969-1975), Los Angeles Lakers (1975-1989) Height/weight: 7-foot-2, 225 pounds Career highlights: Six-time NBA champion (1971, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1988), two-time NBA Finals MVP (1971, 1985), six-time NBA MVP (1971, 1972, 1974, 1976, 1977, 1980), 19-time NBA All-Star (1970-77, 1979-89), 15-time All-NBA (1970-74, 1976-81, 1983-86), 11-time All-NBA Defensive Team (1970, 1971, 1974-81, 1984), NBA Rookie of the Year (1970), NBA 50th Anniversary Team Bottom line: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar made the playoffs in 18 out of his 20 seasons. The two seasons he missed were inexplicably in his prime and in back-to-back years \u2014 his last season with the Milwaukee Bucks and first season with the Los Angeles Lakers. Abdul-Jabbar won six NBA titles to go with three NCAA championships at UCLA and is the NBA's career leading scorer with 38,387 points.\n\n4. Robert Horry \u2014 244 Playoff Games Robert Horry hit a lot of big shots in his career. Position: Forward College: Alabama NBA career: 16 seasons (1992-2008) Teams: Houston Rockets (1992-96), Phoenix Suns (1996-97), Los Angeles Lakers (1997-2003), San Antonio Spurs (2003-08) Height/weight: 6-foot-9, 240 pounds Career highlights: Seven-time NBA champion (1994, 1995, 2000-02, 2005, 2007), All-NBA Rookie Team (1993) Bottom line: No player in NBA history \u2014 not a single one \u2014 has built their reputation on the ability to hit clutch shots more than Robert Horry, who won seven NBA titles with three different teams in 16 seasons. Horry first established himself as \"Big Shot Rob\" on back-to-back title teams with the Rockets, three consecutive titles with the Lakers and two more titles, just for good measure, to close out his career with the Spurs.\n\n3. Tim Duncan \u2014 251 Playoff Games Tim Duncan's nickname was \"The Big Fundamental,\" and it was very fitting. Position: Forward/center College: Wake Forest NBA career: 19 seasons (1997-2016) Teams: San Antonio Spurs Height/weight: 6-foot-11, 250 pounds Career highlights: Five-time NBA champion (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2014), three-time NBA FInals MVP (1999, 2003, 2005), two-time NBA MVP (2002, 2003), 15-time NBA All-Star (1998, 2000-11, 2013, 2015), 15-time All-NBA (1998-2009, 2013), 15-time NBA All-Defensive Team (1998-2010, 2013, 2015), NBA Rookie of the Year (1998) Bottom line: Arguably the greatest power forward in NBA history, Tim Duncan won five NBA titles with the Spurs in his 19-year career. Duncan's offensive workload was made much easier to bear with the addition of guards Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili, and Duncan's 50.6 career field-goal percentage speaks to his efficiency. That the Spurs never missed the playoffs once with Duncan speaks to his greatness.\n\n2. Derek Fisher \u2014 259 Playoff Games Derek Fisher won five NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers. Position: Point guard College: Central Arkansas NBA career: 18 seasons (1996-2014) Teams: Los Angeles Lakers (1996-2004, 2007-12), Golden State Warriors (2004-06), Utah Jazz (2006-07), Oklahoma City Thunder (2012, 2013-14), Dallas Mavericks (2012) Height/weight: 6-foot-1, 200 pounds Career highlights: Five-time NBA champion (2000-02, 2009, 2010) Bottom line: The term \"glue guy\" seems to have been in part defined by Derek Fisher's 18-year NBA career, one in which he played in the NBA Finals eight times and won five championships. Fisher's career numbers are not that impressive \u2014 8.3 points, 2.1 rebounds and 3.0 assists. Especially for a point guard. But he found his way onto winning teams and stuck, which speaks to a value that goes beyond the statistical columns."}, {"url": "https://www.statscrew.com/basketball/stats/p-vallejo01", "page_content": "John Vallely\n\nJohn Stephen Vallely\n\nBorn: October 3, 1948\n\nPosition: G\n\nHigh School: Corona Del Mar\n\nCollege: UCLA, Orange Coast JC\n\nDrafted: 1970, Round 1 Pick 14, #14 Overall\n\nHeight: 6'3\"\n\nWeight: 180\n\nCareer: 1970-71-1971-72\n\n\n\nJohn Vallely averaged 3.6 points, 0.7 rebounds and 0.8 assists per game in his 100-game career with the Atlanta Hawks and Houston Rockets.
