{"Ayn Rand achieved fame with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead.": [{"url": "https://aynrand.org/novels/the-fountainhead/", "page_content": "HOWARD ROARK Expelled from a prestigious architectural school for his unconventional designs \u2014 denied work because of his refusal to compromise his creative principles \u2014 opposed by the architectural critics, his professional colleagues, his whole society \u2014 reduced, at one point, to laboring in a granite quarry \u2014 is Howard Roark a selfless martyr to an artistic ideal? Or does he embody a new concept of self-interest \u2014 one that places nothing above the rational judgment of his independent mind? Will Roark\u2019s unbreachable integrity lead him to sacrifice his goals to his creative vision, or will it prove to be the means by which he ultimately achieves his goals in his career and life? In the story of Howard Roark and his struggle against a tradition-worshipping society, Ayn Rand offers, as she puts it, \u201ca demonstration of how the principles of egoism and altruism work out in people and in the events of their lives.\u201d\n\nPETER KEATING Peter Keating and Howard Roark room together in architecture school, and set off on their careers at the same time. But they couldn\u2019t be more different in their motives and choices. Affable, yet desperate for social approval, Keating covets fame and wealth, and is willing to do whatever it takes to get them. Scheming and backstabbing, Keating manipulates his way to the top of his firm and the architectural profession, attaining everything he ever sought. But what has he achieved when he finally gets there? By conventional standards, Keating is the archetype of selfishness. But what is the essence of his self? What is the real nature of his ambition? What does he actually want in life? What does he truly value, of his own accord? And is there something mistaken about our conventional notion of selfishness, if Peter Keating seems to be its paragon?\n\nELLSWORTH TOOHEY Ellsworth Toohey is an influential columnist and architectural critic, whose praise or censure can make or break an architect\u2019s career. He recognizes that Peter Keating is, at best, a mediocrity, while Howard Roark is an innovative genius. So why does Toohey do everything in his power to boost Keating\u2019s career while plotting and scheming to destroy Roark\u2019s? An arch-exponent of the morality of altruism, Toohey preaches self-sacrifice and service to others at every opportunity. What does that have to do with architecture \u2014 or with literature, theater or other artistic fields with which Toohey also concerns himself? By the end of The Fountainhead, you\u2019ll discover what it is that Toohey is really after, and understand why he is Ayn Rand\u2019s embodiment of collectivism \u201cnot in politics, but in man\u2019s soul.\u201d\n\nGAIL WYNAND Gail Wynand is publisher of the New York Banner, and the owner of a powerful media empire. Brilliant and tireless, he rose from the slums of Hell\u2019s Kitchen to wealth and influence. He has the discernment to appreciate artistic greatness but the success and influence of his newspapers were achieved by pandering to the public taste, feeding the public\u2019s hunger for vulgarity and sensationalism. In Wynand\u2019s view, a man\u2019s only choice in life is to rule or be ruled, and he has dedicated himself to the pursuit of power over men by establishing his newspapers as the voice of public opinion. What will happen when Wynand meets Roark and tries to fight for something he sincerely believes in?

When I asked around to see who had actually read any of her work, I found only a few, but lots of opinions about Rand herself. Often those comments ascribed beliefs to Rand that were at opposite poles of the spectrum, from conservative to radical, individualist to Nazi fascist. Obviously another case of what I call the \u201cDe Toqueville syndrome,\u201d where everyone pretends to have read a famous book and to know what the author stood for, but has no firsthand reading knowledge. Her biography revealed a complex and very interesting individual, so it was time to dig into her works personally.\n\n\n\nThe Fountainhead tells the story of Howard Roark, an architect. Thrown out of Stanton School of Architecture for his refusal to adhere to the standards of the past (the dean views Roark as a rebel who opposes all the rules of architecture and his society\u2019s view of art that is representation of what has been revered in the past) and for turning in assignments that represented a complete break from the past. The conversation with the dean, who tried to persuade Roark to come back into the fold, represents the central theme of the book, the conflict between those who are realitycentered against those who define their lives through the eyes of other people. Roark seeks employment with Cameron, an architect whose designs tried to incorporate using the advantages of new materials, e.g., a skyscraper should look tall, not just like a twenty-story brick building trying to look like a renaissance house. Cameron began to design buildings the way he wanted rather than how his clients demanded. His business dwindled to nothing, but he was sought out by Roark.\n\n\n\nFollowing Cameron\u2019s retirement, Roark seeks employment as a draftsman in a large architectural firm, where he gets a break by sketching a house that breaks with tradition completely but is just what the client wants. Roark is a brilliant but struggling iconoclast, while his rival and former classmate Peter Keating rises to the top of his profession by using obsequiousness, manipulation, and deception. His primary concern is how he is perceived by others. He designs by copying from the past, never thinking independently. Both men are in love with Dominique Falcon, a brilliant, passionate woman, who falls in love with Roark, admires his genius, but who is convinced his genius has no chance in a corrupt world. The villain of the book is Ellsworth Toohey, an architectural critic of note, who denounces Roark for his failure to adhere to the accepted standards of the day. Toohey believes that the individual must sacrifice his independence to the will of others, i.e. society or the group. Toohey is employed by Gail Wynand, a publisher whose paper caters to the lowest common denominator to gain power. He comes to admire Roark and must then decide whether he will continue to pander to popular taste or live according to his higher standards. Rand and her novels have been vilified by the left-wing as reactionary and praised by conservatives as brilliant and influential.\n\n\n\nFrankly, I cannot understand how conservatives can be so enamored of this work that celebrates independence and the rejection of tradition and \u201cnormal\u201d morality. She celebrated atheism, a kind of free love, very strong women, and a rejection of parental values and social norms. She abhorred the subordination of reason to faith, of surrendering one\u2019s own thinking to the beliefs of others. She despised the religious believer who without questioning adopts the religious beliefs of his parents, conforming without thinking. Morality becomes something practical and relative. For example, Roark dynamites a government building project that has been altered, so he can gain access to the courts since the government cannot be sued. Roark really doesn\u2019t care what other people think. He has such strong personal will that he will just do what he thinks is right. He also pals around with one of the construction workers who admires him because he is the only architect that understands construction, and, indeed, Roark makes the point that he loves engineering and building.\n\n\n\nThat sounds more like sixties liberalism than what I hear conservatives espouse. Rand is clearly a romantic who believed that man can live up to an ideal, and reason can help them achieve the independence and the happiness that depends on that independence. What infuriates liberals, as far as I can gather, was her unfailing adherence to capitalism. I suppose conservatives latched on to her vigorous rejection of collectivism, no doubt related to her childhood experiences under Communism. This is not to say Rand celebrates nonconformity for its own sake. That is simply another form of conformity because it\u2019s living one\u2019s life in reaction to the standards of others. The conformist must learn the beliefs of others to adhere to them; the nonconformist must learn the standards so as to avoid adhering to them. Both groups are psychological dependents. Rand celebrates the independent thinker, the individualist who lives on his own terms. The individualist creates his own standards and adheres to them regardless of what others do or think. He has a commitment to reason and facts. Roark represents the great innovator struggling against a profoundly conservative society against the traditionalist who says, \u201cIt was never done this way, so it can\u2019t be good.\u201d The climax of the book is Roark\u2019s speech to the court when he is on trial. \u201cI wish to come here and say that I am a man who does not exist for others. . . The world is perishing from an orgy of self-sacrificing.\u201d He represents a complete rejection of altruism, \u201cthe doctrine which demands that man live for others and place others above self.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s truly a shame when books and authors get labeled as \u201cconservative\u201d or \u201cliberal,\u201d \u201ccommunist\u201d or \u201cdemocrat\u201d and then judged on the basis of the label.

She is known for her fiction and for developing a philosophical system she named Objectivism. Born and educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926. She wrote a play that opened on Broadway in 1935. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead.

Afterward, until her death in 1982, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays.\n\nRand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge; she rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral[5][6] and opposed collectivism, statism, and anarchism. Instead, she supported laissez-faire capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights, including property rights. Although Rand opposed libertarianism, which she viewed as anarchism, she is often associated with the modern libertarian movement. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas and classical liberals.\n\nRand's fiction received mixed reviews from literary critics.[ Although academic interest in her ideas has grown since her death, academic philosophers have generally ignored or rejected her philosophy because of her polemical approach and lack of methodological rigor.[4] Her writings have influenced some libertarians and conservatives politically. The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings"}, {"url": "http://awardsandwinners.com/winner/?mid=/m/0h25", "page_content": "Quotes\n\nI am leaving it as I found it.
