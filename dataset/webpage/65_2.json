She most recently played for Turbine Potsdam in the German Bundesliga and Seattle Reign FC of the National Women's Soccer League. Deines was a fourth round pick (23rd overall) of the Atlanta Beat of Women's Professional Soccer in the 2012 WPS Draft of college seniors on January 13, 2012. The WPS Board of Governors voted to suspend the 2012 season on January 30 citing pending legal issues. Subsequently, she was free to sign with other teams and rejoined the Seattle Sounders Women, the organization she had previously played for from 2007 to 2009. After the formation of the National Women's Soccer League in late 2012, Deines played for the Seattle Reign during the league's first two seasons. She was traded to FC Kansas City in late 2014 but announced her retirement from professional soccer on March 31, 2015, before the 2015 season began.\n\nEarly life\n\nDeines was born in Portland, Oregon, on September 17, 1989, to Matt and Betsy Deines. As a freshman at Issaquah High School, Deines helped lead the soccer team to its first state championship final since 1988 and first *le ever. Deines led the team to four consecutive conference championships from 2004 to 2007 and four state *le games, winning three of them. Issaquah's lone runner-up finish was in 2005 when Deines was forced to miss the championship game to join the United States Youth Soccer *ociation Olympic Development Program in Boca Raton, Florida following the semifinal. Issaquah went on undefeated the next two years with Deines in the lineup.\n\nDeines capped off her high school career by scoring the game-winning goal in the 71st minute of the 2007 state final, a 1\u20130 victory over Seattle Prep.\n\nDeines finished with a total of 76 goals and was named to the all-state team four times and chosen as the state's Gatorade Player of the Year twice. During her senior year she was named to the Parade and NSCAA/adidas Girls High School All-America teams.\n\nDeines has played soccer with the Seattle Sounders Women since joining the team in 2007 while still in high school.\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\nDeines was a four-year starter for the Washington Huskies, starting a school-record 86 games and scoring 21 goals. She was named to the Pac-10 All-Freshman First Team and was a four-time All-Pac-10 selection and a two-time NSCAA Scholar All-American.\n\nAs a freshman at the University of Washington, Deines helped the Huskies return to the NCAA Tournament after a three-year absence. She played a leading role as team captain during her junior year. She converted two key penalty kicks, including the game winner, during an epic penalty shoot-out in a shocking upset of the No. 2 overall seed University of Portland in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The Huskies would eventually go on to the Elite Eight where they were eliminated in an overtime loss at Boston College.\n\nPlaying career\n\nClub\n\nDrafted to the Atlanta Beat, 2012\n\nDeines was selected as a fourth round pick (23rd overall) by the Atlanta Beat in the 2012 WPS Draft of college seniors on January 13, 2012; however, the league suspended operations before play began.\n\nFrom Seattle to Iceland, 2012\n\nAfter the WPS folded in 2012, Deines signed with the Seattle Sounders Women.

The team won the Icelandic Women's Cup after a 1\u20130 win over Valur. Of her time in Iceland, Deines said, \"Even though it was a spur of the moment decision to play overseas in Iceland, I believe my three month stint helped in my development as a player. Icelandic soccer was not nearly as technical or tactical as soccer in the United States but the extreme physicality of our practices and games challenged me to play with a whole new level of aggression. Playing professionally in Iceland also allowed me an opportunity to keep practicing and playing games on a daily basis which would not have been the case if I would have stayed in the United States.\"\n\nSeattle Reign FC, 2013\u201314\n\nIn February 2013, Deines signed with the Seattle Reign FC as a free agent for the inaugural season of the NWSL.

The University of Washington recruit and national team player led Issaquah to state titles her freshman and junior seasons. Dan DeLong/Seattle Post-Intelligencer Issaquah's Kate Deines, a University of Washington soccer recruit, perfects her headers by practicing with tennis balls. Scott Eklund/Seattle Post-Intelligencer\n\nISSAQUAH -- Three hours before every game, Kate Deines' mother tosses about 100 tennis balls into the air. Her daughter, an all-state midfielder for the Issaquah High School, locks onto each ball and thwacks it across the driveway with her head.\n\n\"If you can hit a tennis ball, when it comes time to heading a soccer ball it seems so much easier just because of the size,\" said Deines, a University of Washington recruit and the senior leader of Issaquah's undefeated soccer team, ranked seventh in the nation by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America.\n\nDeines (pronounced DINE-us) wasn't always a skilled airborne attacker, but the two-time state champion spent countless hours perfecting one of the sport's most difficult skills.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nNow the Eagles' co-captain is so fearless in the air that when she goes up for a ball \"all you can do is impede her and pray,\" Bellevue coach Jon Anderson said.\n\n\"There's no one in the air better. She gets a foot taller than everybody else.\"\n\nSmacking soccer balls isn't the only way Deines uses her head. In addition to leading KingCo 3A in scoring each of the past two seasons, she has a 3.9 grade-point average and considered top academic schools such as Stanford and Harvard before deciding on Washington.\n\n\"She's a brilliant kid, and I think that translates onto the soccer field,\" Issaquah coach Tom Bunnell said. \"When we're talking strategy or whatever, she knows. She understands.\"\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nDeines has been a star at Issaquah since she set foot on campus four years ago. The Eagles won the state championship her freshman year in 2004, and finished first again last season when Deines was named Gatorade State Player of the Year.\n\nSandwiched between the two crowns was a runner-up finish in 2005. Deines missed the state championship game that year because of a conflict with her under-16 U.S. national team, which began practicing in Boca Raton, Fla., the same day as the state final. Without Deines, the Eagles lost 2-0 to Camas.\n\n\"We don't like to talk about that,\" Deines said.\n\nThis season, Deines has the Eagles soaring with their sights set on a third state title in four years. Issaquah is 6-0-1 and riding a 28-game unbeaten steak after Thursday's 4-1 victory over Mount Si in which Deines scored three times for her second hat trick of the season.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nDeines is again leading the conference in scoring, netting 10 goals with one assist. The defense has given up one goal all season.\n\nBecause of a change in scheduling, Deines' national team responsibilities have ended for the year. That means for the first time in her high school career, she won't have to worry about missing any portion of Issaquah's state tournament run.\n\n\"It's really fortunate I get to go and represent my country, but at the same time this team is close to my heart,\" Deines said of the Eagles. \"It's hard leaving when you work and you work and you work to get to that point, yet you have to miss it.\"\n\nThat kind of commitment is precisely what makes Deines so likable, teammates said.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\"She's probably the most humble person I've ever met,\" said Issaquah senior Elissa King, who also plays club ball with Deines for Eastside Futbol Club.\n\nAway from the pitch, Deines is like many other 18-year-olds. She's the school's student government assembly director and enjoys watching \"America's Next Top Model.\"\n\nOn the field and under the lights, Deines has an incredibly well-rounded game. She's fast, she's strong, and she can find the net with either foot. She also stands 5 feet 9, which allows her to see the field and read each play as it develops, giving her a huge advantage when it comes time to fly high.\n\n\"If you can be the most dominant team in the air you're going to have a lot of success because if you can win those balls, you're already off to the races,\" Deines said.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\"It's also intimidating for another team when your opponent's going up strong and winning all of the air battles. It's kind of shocking, especially in the women's game, because heading is definitely a weakness.\""}, {"url": "https://gohuskies.com/news/2017/4/27/womens-soccer-where-are-they-now-kate-deines.aspx", "page_content": "Kate Deines was a member of the Huskies from the 2008 to 2011 seasons, and ended her career as one of the top midfielders in program history.

After the formation of the National Women's Soccer League in late 2012, Deines played for the Seattle Reign during the league's first two seasons.

The University of Washington recruit and national team player led Issaquah to state titles her freshman and junior seasons. Dan DeLong/Seattle Post-Intelligencer Issaquah's Kate Deines, a University of Washington soccer recruit, perfects her headers by practicing with tennis balls. Scott Eklund/Seattle Post-Intelligencer\n\nISSAQUAH -- Three hours before every game, Kate Deines' mother tosses about 100 tennis balls into the air. Her daughter, an all-state midfielder for the Issaquah High School, locks onto each ball and thwacks it across the driveway with her head.\n\n\"If you can hit a tennis ball, when it comes time to heading a soccer ball it seems so much easier just because of the size,\" said Deines, a University of Washington recruit and the senior leader of Issaquah's undefeated soccer team, ranked seventh in the nation by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America.\n\nDeines (pronounced DINE-us) wasn't always a skilled airborne attacker, but the two-time state champion spent countless hours perfecting one of the sport's most difficult skills.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nNow the Eagles' co-captain is so fearless in the air that when she goes up for a ball \"all you can do is impede her and pray,\" Bellevue coach Jon Anderson said.\n\n\"There's no one in the air better. She gets a foot taller than everybody else.\"\n\nSmacking soccer balls isn't the only way Deines uses her head. In addition to leading KingCo 3A in scoring each of the past two seasons, she has a 3.9 grade-point average and considered top academic schools such as Stanford and Harvard before deciding on Washington.\n\n\"She's a brilliant kid, and I think that translates onto the soccer field,\" Issaquah coach Tom Bunnell said. \"When we're talking strategy or whatever, she knows. She understands.\"\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nDeines has been a star at Issaquah since she set foot on campus four years ago. The Eagles won the state championship her freshman year in 2004, and finished first again last season when Deines was named Gatorade State Player of the Year.\n\nSandwiched between the two crowns was a runner-up finish in 2005. Deines missed the state championship game that year because of a conflict with her under-16 U.S. national team, which began practicing in Boca Raton, Fla., the same day as the state final. Without Deines, the Eagles lost 2-0 to Camas.\n\n\"We don't like to talk about that,\" Deines said.\n\nThis season, Deines has the Eagles soaring with their sights set on a third state title in four years. Issaquah is 6-0-1 and riding a 28-game unbeaten steak after Thursday's 4-1 victory over Mount Si in which Deines scored three times for her second hat trick of the season.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nDeines is again leading the conference in scoring, netting 10 goals with one assist. The defense has given up one goal all season.\n\nBecause of a change in scheduling, Deines' national team responsibilities have ended for the year. That means for the first time in her high school career, she won't have to worry about missing any portion of Issaquah's state tournament run.\n\n\"It's really fortunate I get to go and represent my country, but at the same time this team is close to my heart,\" Deines said of the Eagles. \"It's hard leaving when you work and you work and you work to get to that point, yet you have to miss it.\"\n\nThat kind of commitment is precisely what makes Deines so likable, teammates said.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\"She's probably the most humble person I've ever met,\" said Issaquah senior Elissa King, who also plays club ball with Deines for Eastside Futbol Club.\n\nAway from the pitch, Deines is like many other 18-year-olds. She's the school's student government assembly director and enjoys watching \"America's Next Top Model.\"\n\nOn the field and under the lights, Deines has an incredibly well-rounded game. She's fast, she's strong, and she can find the net with either foot. She also stands 5 feet 9, which allows her to see the field and read each play as it develops, giving her a huge advantage when it comes time to fly high.\n\n\"If you can be the most dominant team in the air you're going to have a lot of success because if you can win those balls, you're already off to the races,\" Deines said.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\"It's also intimidating for another team when your opponent's going up strong and winning all of the air battles. It's kind of shocking, especially in the women's game, because heading is definitely a weakness.\""}, {"url": "https://www.plu.edu/resolute/fall-2016/kate-deines/", "page_content": "Deines said she has always loved soccer. She grew up playing in the Seattle area, joining the Seattle Sounders Women when she was still in high school. She played for the University of Washington while completing her undergraduate degree in communication and media.\n\nIn 2012, she was named UW\u2019s Female Athlete of the Year and awarded the Tom Hansen Pac-12 Conference Medal \u2013 for the student athlete who displays performance and achievement in leadership, academics and athleticism.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t stop there. \u201cI always wanted to play professionally,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter graduating from UW, Deines found herself with nowhere to play because the United States Women\u2019s Professional Soccer League disbanded. \u201cIt was a sad time for women\u2019s soccer,\u201d she said.\n\nSo, like many others in that situation, Deines played abroad. She joined Stjarnan FC in Iceland, helping her team win the Icelandic Cup, among other accomplishments.\n\nDeines later joined the Seattle Reign FC in 2013, after the formation of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League (NWSL), and played two seasons before retiring in 2015.\n\nDuring that time she continued to play abroad in the offseasons, playing for FFC Turbine Potsdam located just outside Berlin, Germany. They became the top team in the Frauen-Bundesliga, the country\u2019s women\u2019s soccer league.\n\n\u201cFinance was never even on my radar,\u201d Deines said. She said she felt she had already achieved everything she wanted to achieve in soccer, and she was drawn to finance because it focuses on long-term goals. She said soccer, on the other hand, focused on what needed to happen each day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a competitive person, and I was ready for something else,\u201d she said. \u201cAs I near graduation and get ready to work for a firm, the idea that I am hopefully working my way up to the top motivates me. I enjoy thinking about what climbing that next rung looks like and how there\u2019s no ceiling to what you can accomplish.\n\n\u201cThe fact that finance has no limits \u2013 that in and of itself is definitely a big motive.\u201d\n\nAn old family friend and PLU alumna, Darcy Johnson, referred her to the MSF program.\n\n\u201cWhen I visited PLU I had a really good feeling and I could envision myself here,\u201d Deines said. \u201cI always wanted to achieve financial security and I had a really good gut feeling that PLU would be a good fit.\u201d\n\nDeines said she likes the opportunity to help others reach their financial goals. As far as the Women of Influence Award, she said she was pleasantly surprised with the honor. In some ways, she said, the award is a sort of validation, or a sign of heading in the right direction.\n\nMSF program director Cynthia Smith said she was not at all surprised that Deines got the award."}, {"url": "https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/washington/districts/bellevue-school-district/newport-senior-high-school-20734", "page_content": "Overview of Newport Senior High School Newport Senior High School is ranked fourth within Washington.

Compared to other schools in the district, the way they handle IEPs is amazing! If you need something, they'll give it to you. No fighting for it, no waiting, barely any resistance. It's all about the students here! There are some flaws in this school, but other than those flaws this school is ideal, not just as a STEM school but as a high school altogether! The ASB has way more power than other schools, which makes the bigger idea that this school is 100% for the students rather than more of the traditional school. I suggest bringing your kids here, the staff here is nice and so are the majority of the students that currently attend here.

Since the student is a minor, KIRO 7 is only identifying him by his initials, \u201cC.A.,\u201d and his parents by their first names, Paige and Ben, as requested by the family.\n\nC.A. and his family say he is innocent, but is seen as a villain by the community.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared to go to school still, even today,\u201d C.A. said. The Newport High School junior says he\u2019s been dealing with bullying and harassment every day for about nine months.\n\n\u201cNotes, people telling me they\u2019re going to beat the crap about of me, telling me to not come around them, telling me to kill myself,\u201d C.A. said. \u201cConstantly dealing with things like people making comments about me, people laughing at me behind my back,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a nightmare,\u201d said Ben, C.A.\u2019s dad. \u201cTo have a shadow cast on you that\u2019s completely undeserved is a feeling I would hope no one ever has to go through,\u201d he said.\n\nScroll down to continue reading\n\nMore news from KIRO 7\n\nDOWNLOAD OUR FREE NEWS APP\n\nThe lawsuit the family filed against the Bellevue School District on Tuesday says, \u201cThe district did everything it could to avoid its legal duty to provide a safe learning environment.\u201d The complaint accuses the district of violating the Washington law against discrimination, violating the Public Records Act and failure to protect a minor student.\n\nNow the family is looking for changes.\n\n\u201cTo make it clear that harassment and bullying will not be tolerated,\u201d said Yvonne Ward, the family\u2019s attorney.\n\nAll of this started last year when the lawsuit says an ex-girlfriend accused C.A. of physical assault and that he \u201conce hit her arm and pushed her,\u201d something his family says never happened.\n\n\u201cInvestigations found that found my client was innocent,\u201d Ward said, \u201cand they did nothing.\u201d\n\nKIRO 7 checked with the Bellevue Police Department and the King County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The police department said officers conducted an investigation and sent the evidence to the King County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office for review. A spokesperson said prosecutors went through the case and did not believe there was a crime committed. No charges were filed.\n\nHowever, the accusation, plus cases at other schools in the district, led to student walkouts and protests at Newport High School, Sammamish High School and Interlake High School, all in the Bellevue School District.\n\nC.A. says it\u2019s changed his life.\n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s been a lot of fear for myself and my future,\u201d he said.\n\nKIRO 7 reached out to Bellevue School District.

However, she said in an email, \u201cThe district takes Title IX and harassment, intimidation, and bullying allegations very seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis year, BSD students led the school community in constructive and productive conversations that highlight the opportunity to improve processes. Our students, educators, and school leaders are continuing to listen to each other and work together to learn and develop more transparent processes that support, honor and empower them and their families,\u201d Thorn said in the email.\n\nThe district shared some of its recent changes in a school blog and YouTube video post in April, and shared the process it has gone through working with students and the community to update policies.\n\nC.A.\u2019s family says none of that has helped them.\n\n\u201cI think every day we hope it will go away. But the problem is, people know some false narrative and it won\u2019t go away. So we\u2019re trying to get the truth out,\u201d said Paige, C.A.\u2019s mom.\n\nKIRO 7 also spoke with the attorney of the ex-girlfriend referenced in the lawsuit. The attorney is currently not named in this article to help protect the identity of the teen, who is also a minor. The attorney calls the complaint \u201cvictim blaming and shaming\u201d and says there are many \u201cuntruths\u201d in the suit.\n\nIf the civil case against the Bellevue School District goes to trial, that\u2019s currently set one year from now."}]}
