The main door was very, very large(well, so it seemed to a 4 year old!)The main corridor seemed endless and on the right hand side stood glass cases that housed stuffed animals and birds (a thing I still hate to see to this day).At the end of the long, long corridor was a massive staircase that went up to the dorms. my first bed waas in the \"Babies\" section that was housed above the Chapel. In this room there were several beds and a fireplace with a huge old fashioned firegaurd surronding it.The Orphange was sectioned into two halves, boys section and girls section.I was only allowed to go to see my brother once a week.We were taught how to do housework and and laundrywork.We went to Church on Sundays to Pype Hayes and then to Chapel in the Orphanage on Sunday Evening. My wonderful Grandparents tried to be there every Sunday night and if they couldn't make it I would cry!!The orchards were my favourite place, I would love to wonder among the trees on my own and dream that I was there by mistake and my parents would come and find me.............childish dreams.The children there were not all \"Orphans\", many had one parent and many had both parents and many had no parents. All of us were there for one reason or another and we became each others family.We went down the huge play ground to the day school to be taught (Alberta.remember Mr Shillito?)I used to think I was hard done by as I grew older but now I realize that I was proberbly very fortunate to have been raised in a place that taught me to be a good citizen and to try my best to live up to the school motto"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/josiah.mason/3731303", "page_content": "Josiah Mason\n\nIndustrialist philanthropist\n\nFebruary 23, 1795 (age 86) Mill Street, Kidderminster, England, United Kingdom\n\nHe founded Mason Science College in 1875, which later became the University of Birmingham. He began life as a street hawker of cakes, fruits and vegetables. After trying his hand in his native town at shoemaking, baking, carpentering, blacksmithing, house-painting and carpet-weaving, he moved in 1816 to Birmingham. Here he found employment in the gilt-toy trade. In 1824 he set up on his own account as a manufacturer of split-rings by machinery, to which he subsequently added the making of steel pens.

In 1874 the business was converted into a limited liability company. Besides his steel-pen trade Mason carried on for many years the business of electro-plating, copper-smelting, and India-rubber ring making, in conjunction with George Elkington.

In 1858 he opened almshouses in Station Road, Erdington, Birmingham, for spinsters and widows over 50 and orphan girls, providing accommodation in furnished rooms 14ft x 11ft with coal, gas and a small annual income provided.\n\nThis huge, Italianate building, dominated by three tall towers, cost \u00a360,000 to build and was endowed to the tune of \u00a3200,000. After differences of opinion with Anglican supporters, who were less keen than Josiah Mason on helping poor children, Josiah Mason decided to go it alone and found all this money, which amounted to a huge fortune in those days, himself. Later a new wing was added to enable a total of 500 children to be accommodated\u2026\n\nIn 1870 Josiah Mason embarked upon his greatest charitable project, drawing up trust deeds for a college of science. This being intended to equip its graduates to serve local industry, the curriculum was confined to maths, physics, chemistry, natural sciences, physiology and engineering. Literature and theology were specifically excluded.\n\nThe college, which was situated in Paradise Street in the city centre, cost Mason \u00a3170,000 in building costs and endowments. It was opened in Two of its earliest alumni - Stanley Baldwin and Arthur Neville Chamberlain were to become prime ministers.\n\nIn 1882 Mason\u2019s College absorbed the medical faculty of the older Queen\u2019s College, and in 1888 it became Mason\u2019s University College. This institution in turn became the University of Birmingham in 1900. The university having been established on a site at Edgbaston, in 1964 the old Mason\u2019s College buildings were knocked down to make way for the new central library\u2026\n\nEven after he had given almost \u00a3500,000 to his various charitable projects, his estate was still worth \u00a356,000. These were, of course, vast sums of money at the time.\n\nThe Sir Josiah Mason Trust is still active today.\n\nHere he found employment in the gilt toy trade.

Already pushing forward the boundaries of research in medicine and the sciences, Birmingham was beginning to change the world.\n\nThe early days\n\nThe University grew out of Mason College, which can trace its roots back to the medical education seminars of Mr John Tomlinson in 1767-68. He was \u2018First Surgeon\u2019 to the Birmingham Workhouse Infirmary and his 28 weekly lectures on anatomy were the first to be held outside London or south of the Scottish border. Mason Science College was founded by Kidderminster-born Josiah Mason in 1875. From humble beginnings, Mason made his fortune by mass-producing key rings, pens, pen nibs and electroplating.\n\nHe became one of the country\u2019s most esteemed industrialists and philanthropists and was knighted for his generosity in establishing a great orphanage in the suburb of Erdington. The College became Mason University College in 1898 with the Rt Hon Joseph Chamberlain MP becoming the President of its Court of Governors.\n\nThe socio-political landscape\n\nTo set the scene, at this time, England\u2019s only other independent universities were in Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and London. While compulsory education had been introduced in 1880 for children between the ages of five and ten years old, most of the population entered work by the age of 14.\n\nJoseph Chamberlain was acutely aware of these limiting factors when he proposed the establishment of the University of Birmingham. He sought to provide \u2018a great school of universal instruction\u2019, so that \u2018the most important work of original research should be continuously carried on under most favourable circumstances\u2019. It was his ambition that \u2018the individual trades of the new University [would] forever associate their name and their industry with this new institution\u2019. Many aspects of Chamberlain\u2019s vision continue to inspire and guide the University today, including our continuing responsibilities to, and aspirations within, our region; providing a skilled, professional workforce and ground-breaking research that benefits regional industries.\n\nEstablishing the University\n\nChamberlain\u2019s impact on the city of Birmingham, beyond the establishment of the University, was immense, particularly in his improvements to living conditions and education. Thanks to Chamberlain's tireless work, the University was granted a Royal Charter by Queen Victoria on 24 March 1900 - and with the generous donation of land and funds, the University of Birmingham was born. Since then we have led the way with research discoveries and Nobel Prize-winners.\n\nPreserving and researching our history\n\nWhile we highlight Chamberlain\u2019s legacy in terms of the impact on establishing our University as a centre of education for the many, we are committed to encouraging our expert historical researchers to reflect on our past and acknowledge contested narratives."}, {"url": "https://www.lookandlearn.com/blog/26302/josiah-mason-founded-the-college-which-later-became-the-university-of-birmingham/", "page_content": "Posted in British Cities, Education, Historical articles, History, Industry, Philanthropy on Monday, 5 August 2013\n\nClick on any image for details about licensing for commercial or personal use.\n\nThis edited article about Josiah Mason originally appeared in Look and Learn issue number 358 published on 23 November 1968.\n\nAbout a hundred years ago, an elderly man, neatly but inexpensively dressed, called at the rectory attached to St. Martin\u2019s, the parish church of Birmingham.\n\nThe Rector, a rather crusty character, kept his visitor waiting before seeing him in his study. The caller, he then noted irritably, looked so insignificant. He had probably come to beg.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to be brief,\u201d the Rector snapped, \u201cas I\u2019m very busy. I have my sermon to prepare and correspondence to attend to . . . what was it, now?\u201d\n\nThe old man took no offence.\n\n\u201cI wondered whether I might have your advice. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes. No doubt you did, and you may have it within reasonable limits. But, as I\u2019ve told you, I cannot spare much time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted,\u201d continued the visitor, patiently, \u201cto give some money towards the building of an orphanage.\u201d\n\n\u201cA very laudable idea, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said the Rector, hardly treating the offer seriously, \u201cbut I can assure you that \u00a320 or \u00a350 wouldn\u2019t go very far.\u201d\n\n\u201cI quite realise that,\u201d said the visitor. \u201cI was thinking of giving \u00a3100,000.\u201d\n\nAt this point it was the parson\u2019s turn to feel uncomfortable.\n\nThen the conversation turned to what sort of orphanage to build, where to build it and how the orphans were to be chosen.\n\nThe parson was more concerned with the prestige of his church. He wanted the orphanage to admit only members of the Church of England, and for theological tuition to be based entirely on his church\u2019s teachings.\n\nJosiah Mason would have none of it. He was a mild-mannered man, but where principle was concerned, he wouldn\u2019t budge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the happiness and future of the children that counts,\u201d he insisted, \u201cand I don\u2019t care whether they\u2019re Jews or Catholics, or Anglicans or Hottentots. They need and deserve love and support, whatever they are.\u201d\n\nSo, leaving the parson fuming over his unfinished sermon, Mason departed to establish his own orphanage at Erdington, in a splendid building which could house in comfort three hundred children. It cost him \u00a360,000, and another \u00a3200,000 was invested to provide enough income to maintain the orphanage in perpetuity.\n\nThat was vastly more than the \u00a3100,000 Mason had originally intended to spend, but he liked giving money away for useful purposes. He himself lived simply, with absolutely no interest in luxury. Indeed, few people dreamed that he was wealthy. Yet this unassuming man not only founded one of the best orphanages in the country, but Birmingham University as well. His life is a model of what can be done if you have courage, a firm character, a capacity for hard work and a good heart.\n\nJosiah came of a poor but respectable family, and his childhood was hard. His father was a weaver in Kidderminster \u2013 a badly-paid trade \u2013 and at the age of eight Josiah was helping to swell the family income and support his crippled brother by selling pies and cakes in the street. He quite enjoyed the street life, and people admired the cheerful lad who never grumbled, although he was out for long hours in all weathers, in snow and rain, wind and cold, in his shabby clothes.\n\nHaving saved up enough, Josiah bought a donkey, which he called Admiral Rodney (after the famous British seaman) and sold fruit and vegetables. From then on, he had an astonishing variety of jobs and seems to have given satisfaction in them all. He worked for a shoemaker, in a bakery, as a carpenter, blacksmith, housepainter and carpet-weaver.\n\nHowever, Kidderminster\u2019s traditional trade of carpet-weaving did not appeal to him. He had seen too much of his family\u2019s poverty to want to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps, so he went to work for an uncle in Birmingham who made gilt toys. The uncle treated him badly, and after seven years, Josiah found himself unemployed.\n\nWhile he was wondering what to do next, chance made up his mind for him. He met a man called Harrison who made split rings (like those used to hold keys). He joined him, and when Harrison retired, he sold Mason the business for \u00ac\u00a3500. It was a small sum for such a thriving concern, but Harrison liked him.\n\nThe business continued to prosper, and Mason, who saved money carefully, looked around for profitable investments.\n\nAgain fate played into his hands. For centuries people had used goose quills for writing. Now, thanks to the industrial revolution and the increasing interest in the education of ordinary people, the amount of writing done \u2013 of accounts kept, letters written, records and documents prepared \u2013 had increased to vast proportions. If every goose in Britain had been robbed of its feathers, there wouldn\u2019t have been enough quills to go round!\n\nIn 1780, fifteen years before Josiah Mason was born, the split-ring manufacturer Samuel Harrison had made a steel pen for the famous scientist Dr. Joseph Priestley, and from 1803 onwards various makers of steel pens began to operate. Josiah Mason had seen Harrison\u2019s invention. In the 1820s, makers in London and Birmingham were trying to outdo each other in design, and when Mason bought some nibs made by Perry, a famous London stationer, he wrote to him pointing out their faults and suggesting improvements.\n\nAfter that, Mason made all Perry\u2019s nibs. They carried Perry\u2019s name and hardly anybody knew that Mason made them. For the same reason, they did not realise how wealthy Mason was becoming.\n\nIn 1829, Perry sold only thirty boxes of a gross of nibs each. Years later he was selling 32,000 gross a week and Josiah Mason, who made them all, was employing a thousand men in his factory. The nibs sold not only in Britain but all over the world.\n\nLater, Mason took an interest in electroplating, teaming up with the famous George Elkington of Birmingham and joining with him in the ownership of a copper-smelting works in South Wales. Mason was also one of the earliest town planners, for, to attract workpeople to the lonely Welsh site, he built houses and schools.\n\nTowards the end of his life, Mason, who was childless, remembered his early poverty and the frustrations he had suffered in being uneducated. The orphanage he founded was a kind of memorial to his crippled brother, whom he had loved and nursed.\n\nThen he thought of his great educational project.\n\nAt that time Birmingham, although a thriving industrial centre, was lagging behind Manchester and Liverpool in its educational facilities. Mason decided, therefore, to build a college entirely at his own expense.\n\nHis first intention was to make the college a sort of technical institution where people could learn the skills chiefly required in Birmingham; but then he agreed that it should become a more general college.\n\nAs in the case of his orphanage, however, Josiah Mason insisted that religion could not be made a condition of admittance. A person\u2019s religion, he insisted, was his private concern.\n\nDesigning the college and finding the land to build it on took a long time, but in due course the great Gothic building, somewhat like a cathedral in red brick, was completed. It was opened in 1879, on Josiah\u2019s eightieth birthday.\n\nThe project cost Mason \u00a3200,000, but it made him very happy to know that the city he loved, and in which by hard work and honesty he had made his fortune, had become an important provincial centre of learning.\n\nMason College became the nucleus around which grew the University of Birmingham. Today, as he fervently wished, the good work begun by the humble pie-pedlar still goes on."}, {"url": "https://www.sjmt.org.uk/sir-josiah-mason-trust", "page_content": "Sir Josiah Mason Trust was found in 1868 by Josiah Mason, a Victorian industrialist and philanthropist.\n\n\u200b\n\nSir Josiah was born in 1795 in Kidderminster, a 'self-made man with no advantages of birth, or connections, or education, or means'. Born 17 years before Charles Dickens began to write about the poverty of the Victorian era, Josiah taught himself to write and joined a unitarian Sunday School as they could provide him with a basic education. He went on to build a vast fortune from self taught engineering skills and astute business knowledge.\n\n\u200b\n\nFrom an early age, Josiah showed an entrepreneurial flare and tried his hand at many inventions, trades and business ventures before moving to Birmingham in 1816. By 1824, he invested the savings he had earned into a business which manufactured split rings. It was here that he improved the machinery that made the rings so that it was bevelled, hence the modern day key ring. He later went on to become the largest manufacturer of steel pens and pen nibs in the World and contributed heavily to the Birmingham pen trade. He also improved the machinery to make the split pen nib.\n\n\u200b\n\nJosiah, most likely influenced by his childhood experiences was an extremely caring and generous man who went on to do many charitable works, including the founding of schools, a dispensary and Mason Science College, the forerunner of the University of Birmingham. He was knighted for his good works in November 1872.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Trust\n\nIn 1858, Josiah built the first Almshouses in Station Road, Erdington for 30 'spinsters and widows' over 50 years old and rooms for 20 orphan girls. These Almshouses were demolished in 1974.\n\n\u200b\n\nIt was 10 years later that the Trust was officially founded on the 29th July 1868, in readiness for the opening of a second, larger orphanage in Bell Lane (now Orphanage Road), Erdington, with rooms for 26 women and dormitories for 300 children. It cost \u00a360,000 to build and was endowed to the sum of \u00a3200,000. All of this was financed by Sir Josiah and it amounted to a huge fortune at this time. Later a new wing was added to enable a total of 500 children to be accommodated. The orphanage was eventually re-designated as a school, but by the 1960's the cost of upkeep had become prohibitive, leading the Trustees to close it in 1960.\n\nThe Trust retained ownership of a small part of the Orphanage site which contained 36 Almshouses built in the 1920's and which are now called Mason Cottages. It then went on to build further Almshouses on our sites in Shirley in 1974 and Olton in 1979 and started providing care services in the 1980's.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Trust has continued to grow and evolve over the years and the need for the Trust is as real today as it was 150 years ago. We now enter an exciting and ambitious new phase of development in which we aim to improve the lives of many more people living in Birmingham and Solihull."}, {"url": "https://www.sueyounghistories.com/2009-11-12-josiah-mason-1795-1881/", "page_content": "November 12, 2009\n\nSir Josiah Mason 1795 - 1881 was an English pen manufacturer, Philanthropist, Trustee and member of the Management Committee, and major sponsor of the Birmingham Homeopathic Hospital, and the Co-founder of the Mason Science College in Birmingham, which evolved into the University of Birmingham,\n\nJosiah Mason was a close friend and homeopathic patient of James Gibbs Blake and Edward Wynne Thomas, Josiah Mason was also a close friend of Alexander Parkes, Joseph Priestley,\n\nat the end, James Gibbs Blake \u2019watched him day and night\u2019)\u2026 The procession, which left Norwood House, the residence of the deceased, consisted of James Gibbs Blake and Dr. J C Huxley, who attended Sir Josiah during his illness; the coffin, borne by eight servants and workpeople; and the following mourners\u2026\n\nOn 12.12.1870, James Gibbs Blake, Josiah Mason and George James Johnson executed the Foundation Deed of the University of Birmingham:\n\nFrom http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Birmingham#History On February 23, 1875, Josiah Mason, the Birmingham industrialist and philanthropist, who made his fortune in making key rings, pens, pen nibs and electroplating, founded Mason Science College.

After differences of opinion with Anglican supporters, who were less keen than Josiah Mason on helping poor children, Josiah Mason decided to go it alone and found all this money, which amounted to a huge fortune in those days, himself. Later a new wing was added to enable a total of 500 children to be accommodated\u2026\n\nIn 1870 Josiah Mason embarked upon his greatest charitable project, drawing up trust deeds for a college of science. This being intended to equip its graduates to serve local industry, the curriculum was confined to maths, physics, chemistry, natural sciences, physiology and engineering. Literature and theology were specifically excluded.\n\nThe college, which was situated in Paradise Street in the city centre, cost Mason \u00a3170,000 in building costs and endowments. It was opened in Two of its earliest alumni - Stanley Baldwin and Arthur Neville Chamberlain were to become prime ministers.\n\nIn 1882 Mason\u2019s College absorbed the medical faculty of the older Queen\u2019s College, and in 1888 it became Mason\u2019s University College. This institution in turn became the University of Birmingham in 1900. The university having been established on a site at Edgbaston, in 1964 the old Mason\u2019s College buildings were knocked down to make way for the new central library\u2026\n\nEven after he had given almost \u00a3500,000 to his various charitable projects, his estate was still worth \u00a356,000. These were, of course, vast sums of money at the time.\n\nThe Sir Josiah Mason Trust is still active today.\n\nHere he found employment in the gilt toy trade. In 1824 he set up on his own account as a manufacturer of split rings by machinery, to which he subsequently added the making of steel pens.\n\nOwing to the circumstance of his pens being supplied through James Perry, the London stationer whose name they bore, he was less well known than Joseph Gillott and other makers, although he was really the largest producer in England, contributing heavily to the Birmingham pen trade.\n\nIn 1874 the business was converted into a limited liability company. Besides his steel pen trade Mason carried on for many years the business of electro plating, copper smelting, and India rubber ring making, in conjunction with George Elkington.\n\nMason was almost entirely self educated, having taught himself to write when a shoemaker\u2019s apprentice, and in later life he felt his deficiencies keenly. It was this which led him in 1860 to establish his great orphanage at Erdington, near Birmingham.\n\nUpon it he expended about \u00a3300,000, and for this munificent endowment he was knighted in 1872.\n\nHe had previously given a dispensary to his native town and an almshouse to Erdington. In 1880 Mason College, since incorporated in the University of Birmingham, was opened. The total value of the endowment was about \u00a3250,000.\n\nIn commemoration of him, his bust stands at the centre of the roundabout at the junction of Chester Road & Orphanage Road in Erdington.

The greatest benefit China has received from the foundation was their construction of the best hospital in China called Beijing(or Peking) Union Medical College. Soon after the Foundation was established, the Rockefellers sent a group of people to China in order to make a careful survey on China's society, including the aspect of education, sanitation and medical school and hospitals.\n\nThe Rockefellers' connection with China dates back to 1900s.\n\nFather of David Rockefeller, John Davison Rockefeller Jr. (1874 - 1960), had been thinking about building a high-quality university in China to educate talented people from all sectors. He sent people to China to make in-depth surveys three times from 1908 to 1915, the result of which made him realize the importance of introducing medical education in China. Afterwards, the Rockefeller Foundation made the pledge to build a high-quality medical college hospital to integrate education, practice and researches in Beijing, China's capital.\n\n\n\nThree members of the Rockefeller Foundation Made Survey in China.\n\nIn 1915, the Foundation spent 200 thousand dollars to purchase the former Peking Union Medical College as the university's main campus. To uplift its standard in scale, it spent another 125 thousand dollars buying a nearby palace of the Qing Dynasty. On Sept. 16, 1921, the newly built university held a grand opening ceremony and important officials from both the Chinese and American government came to the celebration with their congratulations and wishes. Known scholar Hu Shih also attended the ceremony. He wrote in his diary, \"Today's ceremony was solemn, attended by more than 100 scholars in uniforms, the solemnity of which we have not seen since Beijing came into being. Rockefeller made a good speech.\"\n\nOn Oct. 26 of the same year, the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research made the following report:\n\n\"Beijing's early autumn was beautiful with the alley not dusty as usual, the stores look like pictures and even the hawkers and beggars' shouting sounded sweet, while weddings and funerals service were held on the greatest scale. Through the clean air, the green Western Hills stood in the distance. The nearby hills were decorated with beautiful towers.\n\nThe previous palace of the Qing Dynasty with its green glass roof, which stands as the newly built medical college and hospital, could even be compared with the magnificent imperial wall, the golden roof of the Forbidden City.\n\nThe academic team, which was comprised of excellent scholars, was impressive, and scientists, from the East to the West, were wearing Western uniforms and walked slowly by the high green roofs, modern laboratories, the ancient water truck, the row of Western medicine students, the wondering labor force in groups and beggars. Passing by the noisy street, the team slowly entered into the modern auditorium of Chinese style to the musical piece \"March\" from a new organ.\"\n\nThe Foundation spent a great amount of money and a great span of time in building the Beijing Union Medical College. In 1921, a total of 14 buildings were completed and the equipment were mainly imported from the United States, making the overall quality of the buildings extremely great according to the world's top standards. Though the original budget for the project was 1 to 1.5 million dollars, it cost $7.5 million in the end.\n\n\n\nJohn Davison Rockefeller Jr. with co-workers helping in building the Beijing Union Medical College.\n\nBefore the establishment of the medical college, no Chinese university had met its expectations in the field of medical education. As a result, the Foundation donated to 13 universities, helping them to improve their education proficiency over the period of 8 years and the greatest beneficiary was China's world-class Peking University.\n\nAccording to the report of the Times, in the beginning of the decade since May of 1913, the Rockefeller Foundation spent nearly 10 million dollars and the greatest gift was given to the building of Beijing Union Medical College. According to a statistics in 1956, the Foundation had put in more than 48 million dollars in developing the college.\n\nThe college has raised a group of famous Chinese doctors, such as Lin Qiaozhi who honored as the mother of infants, Wu Jieping and Zhe Futang, and built the modern system to train medical talents in China. Each one of those elite medical talents can open up one or more hospitals or schools, becoming the foundation for China's modern medical education.\n\n\n\nStudents are working in the Library in the Peking Union Medical College.\n\nToday, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Beijing Union Medical College are working closely together. The hospital wrote: \"Rockefeller's family scattered a seed of Western medical education in the beginning of 20th century in China, which has lasted for a hundred years and benefited many people. Thanks to their contribution to Chinese medical education, the hospital will work closely with China Medical Board to creat a new history of glory.\"\n\nTranslated By: Alvin"}, {"url": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Josiah_Mason_a_biography.html?id=j44BAAAAQAAJ", "page_content": "When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me: Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.

He was a man of many trades, manufacturing dip pens and other goods, but his true gift was his ability to see beyond the present and into the future. Mason's foresight allowed him to establish the Mason Science College in 1875, which would eventually become the prestigious University of Birmingham.\n\nMason's journey began in 1795 in the charming town of Kidderminster, where he was born into a working-class family. Despite his humble beginnings, Mason's natural curiosity and entrepreneurial spirit set him on a path of success. He became an accomplished businessman, and his pen manufacturing business quickly rose to become one of the most successful in England. But Mason's ambition was not limited to profit; he recognized the importance of education and the role it played in shaping society.\n\nMason's belief in education was not only evident in his philanthropic endeavors, but also in his personal life. He was an avid reader and collector of books, and his extensive library was a testament to his love for knowledge. Mason's passion for learning was infectious, and he inspired those around him to strive for academic excellence.\n\nBut Mason's legacy extended far beyond his personal interests. His commitment to education and philanthropy was unparalleled, and he used his wealth to make a difference in the world. He established the Mason Orphanage in 1869, which provided housing, education, and support for disadvantaged children. Mason also donated generously to medical research and was a strong advocate for public health.\n\nMason's vision and philanthropy were recognized during his lifetime, and he was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1872. His impact on society continued even after his death in 1881. The statue created in his honor by Francis John Williamson in 1885 may have been destroyed, but the memory of his legacy lives on in the Mason Science College, the University of Birmingham, and the countless lives he touched.\n\nIn conclusion, Sir Josiah Mason was a remarkable man who embodied the spirit of innovation, philanthropy, and commitment to education. His legacy serves as a shining example of what can be accomplished through hard work, determination, and a commitment to making the world a better place.\n\nBiography\n\nJosiah Mason's life began in humble beginnings, as the son of a carpet-weaver, born in Mill Street, Kidderminster. He was a man of many talents, trying his hand at various trades such as shoemaking, baking, carpentering, blacksmithing, house-painting, and carpet-weaving in his hometown. However, his thirst for success led him to move to the bustling city of Birmingham in 1816, where he found employment in the gilt-toy trade.\n\nAfter eight years of hard work, Mason set up his own business in 1824 as a manufacturer of split-rings by machinery, later adding the production of steel pens. Though he was the largest producer of steel pens in England, his name was not as well known as other makers due to his pens being marketed through James Perry, founder of Perry & Co., the London stationer whose name they bore.\n\nApart from his steel-pen trade, Mason carried on with other businesses such as electro-plating, copper-smelting, and India-rubber ring making in partnership with George Elkington. Despite his commercial successes, Mason felt keenly aware of his lack of formal education, having taught himself to write when he was a shoemaker's apprentice.\n\nIn 1860, he founded a great orphanage in Erdington, near Sutton Coldfield, about 6 miles from Birmingham, which he funded with about \u00a3300,000. His munificent endowment led to him being knighted in 1872. Before this, he had already given a dispensary to his hometown and an almshouse to Erdington.\n\nMason's philanthropy did not end with the orphanage. In 1880, he opened Mason College, which was later incorporated into the University of Birmingham. The total value of his endowment was about \u00a3250,000.\n\nMason's accomplishments were celebrated even after his death. His bust, made by William Bloye from a marble statue by Francis John Williamson in 1885, stands at the center of a roundabout at the junction of Chester Road and Orphanage Road in Erdington. Though the marble statue has been destroyed, the bronze bust is still adorned with festive decorations during special occasions and seasonal holidays.\n\nIn conclusion, Josiah Mason's life is an inspiring story of a man who rose from being a street hawker to becoming a successful businessman and philanthropist. He lived a life of purpose, leaving a lasting legacy that has continued to inspire generations."}, {"url": "https://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/A-look-inside-San-Antonio-s-future-women-s-16978619.php", "page_content": "This is a carousel.

Over the years, other San Antonio institutions tried unsuccessfully to build a free-standing pediatric hospital.\n\nUniversity of Texas Health Science Center proposed building a children\u2019s hospital with for-profit operator Baptist Health System, but that deal eventually fell through in 2013 when ownership of the Baptist system was sold by Vanguard Health Systems to Tenet Healthcare Corp.\n\nThat same year, Christus closed adult services at its downtown hospital, making way for renovations and the opening of the Children\u2019s Hospital of San Antonio.\n\nNow, as the county judge serves his last term in office before retirement, he can\u2019t help but feel like everything worked out best for the taxpayer-funded hospital system.\n\nOn ExpressNews.com: University Health System is ever-challenged \u2014 and expanding\n\n\u201cThe more we thought about it, we decided to build a women\u2019s and children\u2019s hospital,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cI think this made a lot more sense than some free-standing hospital off by itself.\u201d\n\nWolff credits Hernandez, who came on board as CEO in 2005, for turning around the county-owned system.\n\nThree years ago, health care consulting firm Blue Cottage conducted a market analysis for the Bexar County Hospital District and found that the system needs to acquire property in different areas to keep up with population growth.\n\nIn September, University Health announced plans to spend $10.4 million on 68 acres of land to build a hospital on the county\u2019s southwest side near Texas A&M University-San Antonio.\n\nThere are at least two other sites in mind for future hospitals: an 80-acre tract on the Northwest Side on Loop 1604 and Shaenfield Road and a 42.5-acre tract on the Northeast Side on Retama Parkway and Lookout Road.\n\nlaura.garcia@\n\nexpress-news.net"}]}
