No way were viewers of the ABC soap going to let him go. And he wouldn\u2019t be all that eager to let go himself, either.\n\n\u201cThe role allowed for the creation of a character that was fresh and different for daytime television as a sort of intriguing\u2026 mysterious type,\u201d he recalled for That\u2019s Awesome in the fall of 2020. \u201cAs [Robert] was involved with the incredibly popular supercouple Luke and Laura, the fans really embraced my character and me.\u201d\n\nSo much so that Rogers couldn\u2019t go anywhere without being more than recognized, mobbed. \u201cBeing a part of such a wildly popular show at the time came with sacrificing privacy and made it almost impossible for me to do something as simple as going to a store without security,\u201d he told the website. \u201cThank goodness it was a time without social media!\n\n\u201cWhile I would not trade a minute of it,\u201d he hastened to add, \u201cI did not realize that this two-day shoot would turn into a role that would explode the way it [did] and one that I would play for decades.\u201d\n\nOver the years, Rogers has appeared on loads of primetime series and even other soaps, most notably The Young and the Restless, where he imbued Colin Atkinson with an enviably cheeky charm. (That\u2019s him with leading lady Jess Walton as Jill below.) But it\u2019s Robert Scorpio for which he\u2019ll always be best known.\n\nNonetheless, Rogers doesn\u2019t regret his decision to leave General Hospital in 1992. \u201cI kind of had to get away from it,\u201d he explained to Soap Opera Digest in 2019. \u201cI was very unhappy being on the show at that time\u2026 I had a real yearning to do something else.\u201d\n\nSo he did a whole lot of \u201csomething else,\u201d from Showtime\u2019s NASCAR-racing drama Fast Track to Babylon 5 (pictured below) to voice work on animated shows such as Captain Planet and the Planeteers and Batman Beyond. Finally, after making a few \u201cspectral\u201d returns to General Hospital, Rogers raised Robert from the grave in 2006.\n\nSo today, on the anniversary of our introduction to his iconic character, why not celebrate by looking through the below photo gallery, which reviews his life and many, many loves in Port Charles?"}, {"url": "https://www.tvinsider.com/people/tristan-rogers/", "page_content": "Actor\n\nBirth Date: June 3, 1946\n\nAge: 77 years old\n\nBirth Place: Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\n\nIn 1980, Australian actor Tristan Rogers landed a small role on what was then the most popular soap opera in the world, \"General Hospital,\" (ABC, 1963- ), having no idea he would become the first of many hunky Australian exports to set American hearts aflutter.

The character was first introduced in December of 2010, and was played by Tristan Rogers on and off over the years, last being seen in 2019. Colin started off devious before softening somewhat, but the guy has always been trouble!\n\nColin Atkinson arrived in Genoa City fresh out of an Australian prison and got cozy with Jill Abbott who told him all about Cane Ashby not realizing he was his father. Colin eventually confronted his son and ordered Cane to return to Australia to take his rightful position in their organized crime family or he\u2019d tell Lily Winters and Jill all about his past. Colin also used memories of Cane\u2019s dead sister, Samantha, to torment him further. But Colin was heartbroken when Cane was shot and killed by his henchman, Blake, and plotted to kidnap his grandchildren. He summoned Cane\u2019s twin brother, Caleb, to town, but it was soon revealed that Caleb was the one who had been murdered, and Cane was pretending to be his twin while working with his mother, Genevieve!\n\nAfter everything was exposed, Colin had to work to win back Jill\u2019s affection but was ultimately successful.

He tried to help her solve the mystery of Katherine Chancellor\u2018s music box, and when it led to a valuable necklace, Colin tried to steal it to pay off some mobsters he was in debt with. When he came clean about his theft to Jill, she agreed to make a forgery to give to the criminals instead.\n\nBut Colin was still shady, and when he found out that Devon Hamilton and Hilary were having an affair, he blackmailed Devon for millions of dollars to keep his mouth shut. He also took Neil\u2019s money to set Devon up with a stripper the night before his wedding to Hilary. He also nearly told Jack that Billy was having an affair with his wife, Phyllis, but Jill convinced him to keep quiet.\n\nAfter some time away, Colin followed Jill back to Genoa City in 2017 and she accused him of stealing her fortune. In her rage, Jill suffered a heart attack and Colin felt terrible. Although prohibited from seeing Jill, he was determined to get her money back and upon discovering a key in Katherine\u2019s music box, Colin opened the safety deposit box to find an emerald ring that more than made up for what he\u2019d taken. Eventually, Jill forgave Colin, and they left on an around-the-world trip to check some things off of Jill\u2019s bucket list.\n\nComplicated was just one way to describe Colin and Jill\u2019s marriage!

Confronted, Colin claimed that his son was behind stealing Katherine\u2019s fortune, though Cane denied any involvement. Colin disappeared and took the money with him, so Cane left Genoa City to go after him and make things right.

According to Soap Opera Digest, Colin will be seen on two episodes beginning Thursday November 21.\n\n\u2013 Candace Young"}, {"url": "https://soaps.sheknows.com/the-young-and-the-restless/news/36027/tristan-rogers-returning-to-the-young-and-the-restl/", "page_content": "Tristan Rogers Returning To The Young And The Restless\n\nBack to Y&R on the 9th.

The latest twist in the Chancellor will contestation has Cane (Daniel Goddard) inheriting Katherine\u2019s billions, not Devon (Bryton James).\n\nIt would appear that the sudden appearance of the will plot was a quickie way to send off Cane, as we know that Goddard is leaving the show. What better way to depart Genoa City than as a billionaire?\n\nWhat if this latest will, which shows Cane as the lucky party, is also a sham? If so, it may be enough to send Cane running for the hills with all of his ill-gotten gains.\n\nThere are two reasons why Colin could be involved in these shenanigans. First, he\u2019s Cane\u2019s dad, so presumably he would stand to get a good chunk of the fortune if Cane were so inclined. After all, what\u2019s a few million between father and son?\n\nBolstering this theory, Jill (Jess Walton) tells a secret to Cane that involves Colin. She tells him that she has a sneaking feeling that Colin could be behind the switch-up that results in Cane being the beneficiary, not Devon.\n\nAn emblem on the document envelope looked to be from a hotel in the Maldives, a locale Colin wanted to visit. Cane thinks it could all be a coincidence, but Jill knows what the con man is capable of. She vows to hunt Colin down, presumably to bring him to justice.\n\nAlso bolstering the theory that Colin could be making an appearance is the fact that Amanda referenced working for an old jerk.\n\nWe hate to be rude, and those are her words, not ours, but Colin could fit this harsh description in the eyes of many!\n\nIs Colin the old jerk behind all of this turmoil that could end up being the reason Cane ditches town?\n\nBe sure to tune in and find out!\n\nThe Young and the Restless airs weekdays on CBS."}, {"url": "https://dailysoapdish.com/2019/11/young-and-the-restless-spoilers-what-happened-to-colin-atkinson-tristan-rogers-on-yr/", "page_content": "\u2018Young and the Restless\u2019 (Y&R) Spoilers is asking if you have been thinking what we have about Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers) on \u2018Young and the Restless\u2019? What happened to him? Where is he and what is going on with him? We can fill you in on what has happened and what we know about the character and actor.\n\n\u2018Young and the Restless\u2019 Spoilers: Flashback to Colin\n\nIf you haven\u2019t caught up on \u2018Young and the Restless\u2018 in awhile, you have missed quite a lot. Let\u2019s talk about Colin. He first came onto the show in December 2010. When he first came onto the show, he was played by Tristan Rogers. The last time we saw him was in 2017 and we knew him as someone who was always in deep water!\n\n\u2018Young and the Restless\u2019 Spoilers: All about Colin Atkinson\n\nWhen he got to Genoa City, he had escaped from prison in Australia. Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) was the object of his affection for quite a few years. Then he met Cane Ashby, who ended up being Colin\u2019s son. Colin got into hot water again and with Jill this time. He was deported all the way back to Australia once Jill set him up.\n\n\u2018Young and the Restless\u2019 Spoilers: Colin Gets Back to Genoa City\n\nAustralia couldn\u2019t keep Colin away from Genoa City and the love of his life, Jill. Colin got deeper in debt and deeper into the mob ties and life of being a criminal. This always seemed to be his chosen path though. Jill tried the best she could to help, but in the end, never really wanted to become his accomplice.\n\nWhen Jill suffered from her heart attack, Colin did everything in his power to see her and to apologize for his ways in the past. She did forgive him eventually and he knew that he could rest well knowing that her hatred for him had passed. The marriage that these two had was incredibly complicated and we know that we miss these two together. We can still see Jill on \u2018Young and the Restless\u2019 and we hope to see Colin show up again sometime soon! Perhaps we will see him make a guest appearance on the show as part of the Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard) exit angle.\n\nFor any other soap opera and entertainment news, please visit Daily Soap Dish."}, {"url": "https://www.soapcentral.com/young-and-restless/news/2019/1114-tristan_rogers_returning.php", "page_content": "Posted Wednesday, November 13, 2019 4:53:00 PM\n\nMany The Young and the Restless fans are mourning the imminent loss of Daniel Goddard, who will soon be exiting the canvas as Cane Ashby.
