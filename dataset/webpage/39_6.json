{"Hilda Kuper was a founding member of the International Council of Women of the Darker Races.": [{"url": "https://muse.jhu.edu/article/774533", "page_content": "The International Council of Women of the Darker Races of the World (ICWDR) was founded in 1922 by prominent members of the National Association of Colored Women (NACW). This exclusive council, initially comprising eighteen well-educated and highly respected middle-class African American women, was actively engaged in a variety of political agendas and social reform efforts locally and nationally. Situating discrimination of African Americans across the United States into the larger context of ongoing global European and American racialized colonial oppression and imperialist interventionism, this group of women pursued a Pan-Africanist agenda promoting \u201cracial uplift\u201d by \u201cundermin[ing] American racism within larger global processes of racism, imperialism, and eventually decolonization\u201d (Materson 2009: 36). More specifically, these reformers directed their energies toward a transnational endeavor of raising the racial consciousness of women of \u201cdarker complexions\u201d across the globe by creating reading and conversation groups. These groups would \u201cstudy any question or all questions in a systematic way, relative to the darker races. No matter whether these races are races willing to be affiliated with us or not,\u201d as member Margaret Murray put it, with the aim of fostering solidarity based on shared history as oppressed people \u201cof the darker races\u201d (Washington 1923).\n\nAlthough a majority of the founding members\u2014women such as Mary [End Page 271] Church Terrell; Addie W. Hunton; Mrs. Booker T. Washington, Margaret Murray Washington; Maggie L. Walker; and Mary B. Talbert\u2014were also actively involved in other women\u2019s rights groups such as the International Council of Women, International Alliance of Women / International Women\u2019s Suffrage Alliance, Women\u2019s International League for Peace and Freedom, and the National Association of Colored Women. As Black women they recognized the necessity and importance of a transnational forum that would highlight the shared oppressions of racialized minority women, a focus that existing women\u2019s organizations had yet to address. Expanding W. E. B. Du Bois\u2019s Pan-Africanist approach to include gender as a political issue and organizing strategy, the ICWDR\u2019s members were ambitious and optimistic about the organization\u2019s ability to unify women on a global level and to garner international support for progressive social change that would improve the disadvantaged status of African-descended women worldwide (Rief 2004: 218).\n\nUnfortunately, their membership exclusivity based on social class, along with the extensive responsibilities of council members already committed to various personal, professional, and political causes, ultimately led to the ICWDR disbanding sometime in the early 1940s.1 Nonetheless, although the organization itself faded away, the ideological principles on which it was founded acted as a \u201ctransition site between nineteenth-century strategies of racial uplift and newer global race consciousness ideas, [and] was an antecedent to the women of color feminism that would emerge in the late twentieth century\u201d (Materson 2009: 36). The ICWDR archival piece that follows highlights how the internationalist, feminist, antiracist and decolonizing orientations of the council employed strategies that unified, advanced, and sought to address the disadvantaged condition of women of the \u201cdarker races\u201d globally.

However, their roles have rarely been highlighted. Often due to sexism, or bias towards male perspectives the contributions of women have been given a raw deal. Women that we should have been reading about in our history textbooks were pushed into oblivion. There are even instances of men taking credit for women\u2019s work. From ancient times to recent history, many contributions of women have been discounted and even neglected by the patriarchal society.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us look at a few women in history who have changed the world in more ways than one:\n\n\n\n\n\nDra. Paulina Luisi:\n\n\n\n\n\nBorn to Argentinian parents, Dra. Paulina Luisi was the first woman in Uruguay to earn the equivalent of a bachelor\u2019s degree. As the first female medical student, she had to face a lot of harassment from her own classmates. Paulina founded the Uruguayan branch of the National Women\u2019s Council in 1916. Uruguay became the second Latin American country to grant full voting rights for women. Luisi, who was in Europe at that time, came back to Uruguay to fight elections. By the 1940s, she was the most important female voice of the Socialist party. She spoke in favour of women\u2019s rights- legal and political.\n\n\n\n\n\nHilda Kuper:\n\n\n\n\n\nBorn in Bulawaya, Rhodesia, and growing up in Johannesburg, South Africa, Kuper\u2019s fieldwork was on the impact of liquor laws on Black women in Johannesburg. Her research expanded to Swaziland and Indian communities in Durban. Her marriage with Leo Kuper and subsequent involvement in non-violent apartheid protests changed the course of her life. She became one of the founders of the Liberal Party which resulted in her being shunted out of South Africa. She worked as a Professor of Anthropology at UCLA. Based on her research, she theorised that Westernization weakened Swazi and Indian South African women.\n\n\n\n\n\nKittur Rani Chennamma:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Indian Queen of Kittur became a symbol of the independence movement in India because of her rebellion against the British forces. She married Raja Mallasaraja at the age of 15. Chennamma's husband died in 1824 leaving behind a son and an unstable kingdom. Her son also passed the same year, which is when she adopted Shivalingappa as an heir to the throne.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Doctrine of Lapse, if the ruler of a state dies childless, then the right to rule goes to the State. Chennamma sent a letter to the British pleading her case, but it was turned down. War broke out. Both the forces lost a lot of men, and during the second attack, Chennamma was captured by the British and sent to prison for life. She died on February 2, 1829.\n\n\n\n\n\nBegum Royeka :\n\nShe was a Bengali feminist thinker and political activist from British India (present day Bangladesh). She is considered as a pioneer of women\u2019s liberation in South Asia. She believed that the lack of education for women was the reason for their poor economic standing. Royeka established the first school aimed at Muslim girls in Kolkata. In 1916, she founded the Muslim Women\u2019s Assocation.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was deeply involved in debates, conferences and speeches regarding the rights of women. BBC ranked Royeka number 6 in BBC\u2019s poll of the \u2018Greatest Bengali of all time.\u2019 She wrote a number of poems, essays, novels, short stories, etc., in which she urged women to fight against atrocities and break the cycle of discrimination.\n\n\n\n\n\nJeannette Rankin:\n\nShe was an American women\u2019s rights advocate and politician, and the first woman to hold federal office in the United States. In 1941, she was the only member of Congress who voted against the declaration of war on Japan after the Pearl Harbor incident. She introduced legislation which eventually became the 19th Constitutional Amendment which granted unrestricted voting rights to women in the US. Rankin strongly believed that the corruption prevalent in the United States government during her time was because of the lack of women\u2019s participation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese women deserve to be better known, and more importantly, deserve to occupy the annals of history with more prominence. Their contributions have been unfairly neglected and downplayed for a long time. Let these stories inspire you to fight for future generations of women. You can counteract the overshadowing of these important women by reading about them and discussing them with your peers."}, {"url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781315306476/shona-ndebele-southern-rhodesia-hilda-kuper-hughes-van-velsen", "page_content": "Routledge is proud to be re-issuing this landmark series in association with the International African Institute.

Anthony, May Wright Sewell, and Frances Willard, among others, the ICW held its first convention March 25\u2013April 1, 1888, in Washington, D.C. Nine countries\u2014England, Ireland, France, Norway, Denmark, Finland, India, Canada, and the United States\u2014sent 49 delegates. Though the council\u2019s primary goal was the advancement of women, it did not demand woman suffrage so as not to alienate the more conservative members. A constitution was drafted with international assemblies to be held every five years and national meetings occurring every three. The early international conferences were extensively covered by the press, especially the 1899 meeting in which Anthony met Queen Victoria.\n\nIn the 1920s the ICW and its standing committees worked with the League of Nations, and following World War II it became a consultant to the United Nations. With more than 70 member countries, the ICW has been headquartered in Paris since 1963. Officers are elected by delegates from national boards at triennial international congresses. The council is affiliated with numerous agencies, including, from 1981, the World Health Organization."}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Hilda_Kuper", "page_content": "What we do.
