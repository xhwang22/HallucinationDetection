It was soon generally applied to the writers who concerned themselves with Spain\u2019s heritage and its position in the modern world. Never an organized movement or school, the Generation of 1898 worked in diverse fields and styles and rarely agreed on approaches or solutions to Spain\u2019s problems, but all had in common a desire to shake the Spanish people out of what they saw as apathy and to restore a sense of national pride.\n\nJoaqu\u00edn Costa, \u00c1ngel Ganivet, and Miguel de Unamuno are generally considered precursors of the Generation of 1898, but many literary historians consider Ganivet and, usually, Unamuno as members of the group proper.

Perhaps it is even possible that, now that you have children, you have to study it again with them so that they learn it. If so, then you have come to the right place because we are going to tell you about it.\n\nAnd if not, it is always good to remember part of the history of Spain, specifically the literary part, since it is the authors who were part of the Generation of 98 were very important in their time and had an impact, not only in Spain, but in many more parts of the world. Stay and know more about them.\n\nHow the Generation of '98 emerged\n\nThe Generation of '98 is actually the name of a group of writers who came together at a time with the aim of facing a situation that all of them were going through, characterized by a moral, social, political and economic crisis. in Spain, the result of the loss of Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines.\n\nWe speak specifically of the year 1898, At a time when, due to the decline of the Spanish empire and the signing of a treaty by which several Spanish-American colonies were lost, society was plunged into an atmosphere of unease and indignation, which many authors channeled and exhibited in their own works.\n\nAt first, the group was formed only by three authors: P\u00edo Baroja, Azor\u00edn and Ramiro de Maeztu, known as \"The Three\", nickname by which they signed the articles published in the media of that time. But little by little they increased in number, adding many more authors, up to more than 20 personalities from the literature of that time: \u00c1ngel Ganivet, Miguel de Unamuno, Enrique de Mesa, Antonio and Manuel Machado, Ricardo Baroja, Ram\u00f3n Mar\u00eda del Valle- Incl\u00e1n, Gabriel y Gal\u00e1n, Manuel G\u00f3mez Moreno, Miguel As\u00edn Palacios, Francisco Villaespesa, Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal, Jacinto Benavente, Carlos Arniches, Joaqu\u00edn and Seraf\u00edn \u00c1lvarez Quintero.\n\nGeneration '98 Characteristics\n\nThese authors, upset by what had happened, began a \"campaign\" of social protest characterized by a series of conditions that governed their writings. These are:\n\nFlaunt Spain\n\nDefending her and expressing his love for her. Therefore, for them the \"homeland\" and the essence of the country are important. For them, the need for regeneration, not only social, political, but also artistic is a priority.\n\nThey reject the bourgeoisie\n\nConsidering that this social class is only one defeatist and failed society that it does not serve the common good (and much less for Spain).\n\nThey are very critical\n\nOn the political situation and the social norms that govern the country, sometimes opposing them, especially if those norms clashed with his patriotistic values \u200b\u200bor love of Spain.\n\nThey created new forms of literature\n\nFollowing their own dictates, in which literature also needed a \"change,\" they were the pioneers in offering a new literature, as for example the absurdity, a branch of the theater; or the impressionist novel.\n\nTo give you an example, Azor\u00edn was perhaps one of the first authors of the time in Spain who decided that his characters should take a trip back in time, when that was unthinkable.\n\nIn turn, they decided to bring literature much closer to readers, make it more understandable, so they began to use simple phrases, with careful language but that everyone understood. And short; with a sentence of just a few words they were able to convey a large body of opinions or make people reflect on what they had just read.\n\nThe main authors of the Generation of '98\n\nAs we have seen before, the Generation of '98 was not a matter of just three authors. There were many more and it is worth commenting a bit about the main authors, starting with the group of 'The Three'.\n\nPio Baroja\n\nBaroja, along with the following two authors, was one of the pillars of the Generation of '98. At that time, his works were influenced by the characteristics of this movement, where pessimism and restlessness were present in his literary works.\n\nIn this case, Baroja used his critical and sarcastic humor to talk about the reality of Spain, but at the same time he was trying to make readers wake up and see that the best thing for the country was to regenerate itself, to change to have a better one.\n\nIt must be said of P\u00edo Baroja that he was a very pessimistic and sullen man. Perhaps the most \"incendiary\" of the whole group since he was quite nonconformist and one of the first to be predisposed to \"be noticed\".\n\nAzorin\n\nIn the case of Azor\u00edn, or his real name, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Ruiz, had access to publications due to his status as a journalist. For this reason, by being in the \"front line\" of the information, he was able to see the social and economic problems that the loss of the colonies posed to Spain, and how a change should be brought about in the country so that it would regenerate and emerge again.\n\nIn the case of Azor\u00edn, he is the complete opposite of Pio Baroja. In the sense that he was more calm and observant, very sensitive and able to appreciate even the smallest details that were put before him.\n\nFor this reason, his passion for Spain, for landscapes, transience and the passage of time characterized all of his work.\n\nRamiro de Maeztu in the Generation of '98\n\nMaeztu, in addition to being a writer, was a journalist. Thanks to his profession, he had the media more at hand and was able to publish many articles related to the defense of the Homeland (Spain) and Hispanic values, trying to get more people to identify with his country.\n\nEven though at first it was quite impulsive and radical, with the passage of time his writings were more conservative, always in the same vein, but with a more appeasing message.\n\nMiguel de Unamuno\n\nUnamuno joined the Generation of 98 shortly after it was created since he shared his same way of thinking with other authors and reflected it in his works, where very similar characteristics to this group are seen.\n\nTo Miguel de Unamuno he is recognized as a kind of \"leader\" of the group due to that fighting and rebellious spirit that, even in advanced age, he knew how to keep intact. For him, both Spain and human life were the most important thing in the world, and he tried to influence everyone who wanted to listen to him or read him."}, {"url": "http://www.zarzuela.net/writ/arniches.htm", "page_content": "\n\nCarlos Arniches\n\n(1866 - 1943)\n\nBorn into an Alicante family of modest means on 11th October 1866, Arniches became the most prestigious writer of one-act sainetes and g\u00e9nero chico zarzuelas in the early decades of the 20th Century. Although he was undisputed successor to the great saineteros such as Ramon de la Cruz and Ricardo de la Vega, his background was far removed from the Madrid literary coffee houses and tertulias that bred so many of the capital's celebrated stage writers. He left home aged 14 for a post in a Barcelona bank, later working in a sewing machine factory. A benevolent maiden aunt covered the costs of a mutual move to Madrid in 1885, though she soon retired to Valencia and left him to his own financial devices. Penury forced him to move back to Barcelona, but one clever idea - a Rhyming Alphabet based on incidents from the life of Alfonso XII, dedicated to his young son and heir Alfonso XIII - won the heart of the Queen, who ordered its use in all Spanish schools. Arniches returned to Madrid, this time for good. His first short play Casa editorial was written with Gonzalo Cant\u00f3, and performed at the Teatro Eslava in 1888. Altogether he wrote over 200 stage pieces, many with other writers. Many of these earlier works are sainetes in one or two acts, with or without music, full of costumbrismo (popular life and customs) and written in the fresh, colourful and buoyant style which was his trademark. Later on he developed a new dramatic form, the tragi-comic tragedia grotesca, often farcical in action but trenchant in social commentary: the full-length plays La se\u00f1orita de Trev\u00e9lez (1916) and Es mi hombre (1921) are amongst the most potent of these. His spoken dialogue (other writers often wrote the sung lyrics) is fluent but far from vapid, sparkling with keen wit. His texts have a moral framework which allays any suspicion of frivolity. Arniches' scripts were in great demand with virtually all the leading composers and writers of the day. A mere handful may be singled out, though many more will be found in the Zarzuela Index. For Chap\u00ed he penned three notable works with Cant\u00f3 which cemented his reputation - Ortograf\u00eda (1888); La leyenda del monje (1890); and Las campanadas (1892) - two with Celso Lucio, El reclamo (1893) and V\u00eda libre (1893) - one with Asensio Mas, El pu\u00f1ao de rosas (1902) - and unaided La cara de Dios (1899) and El maldito dinero (1906). For Caballero he wrote Los aparecidos (1892), and the evergreen El cabo primero (1895, with Lucio); for Chueca, Los descamisados (1893) and El coche correo (1896), both with Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Silva. Of his many sainetes for Torregrosa El santo de La Isidra and La fiesta de San Ant\u00f3n (both 1898) retain their popularity; as does El pobre Valbuena (1904) with music by Torregrosa and Quinito Valverde, and lyrics by Enrique Garc\u00eda Alvarez. Arniches and Garc\u00eda Alvarez also enjoyed great success writing sainetes for the young Serrano such as El pollo Tejada (1906); the brilliant Alma de Dios (1907); and El trust de los tenorios (1910). La alegr\u00eda del batall\u00f3n (1909) was written for the same composer with F\u00e9lix Quintana. Alone, he wrote El amigo Melquiades (1914, music by Serrano and Quinito Valverde). A collaboration with Antonio Estremera, Don Quint\u00edn el amargao (1924), a sainete in two acts with a substantial music score by Jacinto Guerrero, proved one of his biggest music theatre successes. No less than three films were made of the play, two of them directed by no less than Luis Bu\u00f1uel (1935 and 1951), who amplified Arniches hints of surrealism in his treatment of the \"embittered\" anti-hero and his gangster sidekicks. Perhaps his heyday was the brilliant period between 1916 and 1926, when he was a nationally known and loved figure. His work rate later declined considerably - until the onset of the Civil War, when he moved to Argentina and resuscitated his career in theatre, radio and cinema. Unhappy away from his beloved Madrid, he and his wife returned home in the early 1940's, only to find the capital changed beyond recognition. Loved and respected for his personal virtues as well as his sainetes, Arniches died in Madrid on 16th April 1943, from heart failure brought on by news of the sudden death of his daughter Rosario. **See also El pud\u00edn negro de Stornoway (December 28th 1904), \"by Torregrosa and Quinito Valverde, to a libretto by Carlos Arniches\"**\n\n\n\n[Back to top of page]"}, {"url": "https://www.classicspanishbooks.com/20th-cent-generation-of-98.html", "page_content": "The Generation of '98 overview\n\n\"Generation of '98\" is the name used to bring together a group of Spanish writers, essayists and poets that were profoundly affected by the moral, social and political crisis in Spain caused by the military defeat against the US and which meant the loss of Cuba, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Philippines in 1898. This generation of writers made a great contribution to the Spanish language, and they're still considered some of the best writers of the 20th century.\n\nSpanish Generation of '98\n\nThis group was started by what was called \"The Group of Three\", composed by Baroja, Azor\u00edn and Maetzu, who started to write with a heavy left winged and critical view but who moderated their ideals as time went on and evolved to a more traditional concept of good and bad. The name \"Generation of '98\" caused some polemic: Baroja and Maetzu denied the existence of such a generation, but Pedro Salinas affirmed it after a thorough investigation.\n\nAt least at the beginning of the movement, the authors shared a deep friendship for one another, and they all agreed in their opposition to the Restoration. Although they each had their distinctive style, they do share some points:\n\nThey made a clear distinction between the real squalid Spain and the false official Spain . They were worried about the identity of the country, which stemmed from the debate known as \"Ser de Espa\u00f1a\" (Being Spanish) that would continue in the coming generations.\n\n.

They tried to bring Spain up to date with the philosophical movements that were popular in Europe , particularly the ones of Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard and Bergson.\n\n, particularly the ones of Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard and Bergson. Pessimism is quite common in these writers, as well as a critical and dissatisfied attitude that helps them sympathize with Romantics like Larra.\n\nThey all share the thesis of Regenerationism, which consisted in investigating, in a scientifically and objectively correct manner, the causes of Spain's decline as a nation.\n\nThese authors of the Spanish Generation of '98 had several places in which they gathered to talk about literature, politics and whatever they had in mind. Because Madrid was the epicenter of the literary activities in Spain, all of their literary gatherings took place in the capital, where most of the writers lived or at least spent some time. Benavente and Valle-Incl\u00e1n presided the gatherings in Caf\u00e9 Madrid, which Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, Maeztu and Baroja attended. A bit later they started meeting in the Cervecer\u00eda Inglesa, while Valle-Incl\u00e1n, the Machado brothers, Azor\u00edn and P\u00edo Baroja went to Caf\u00e9 de Fornos. Valle-Incl\u00e1n, a man of great prestige in his time, ended up presiding the gathering at Caf\u00e9 Lyon d'Or and at Caf\u00e9 de Levante, which was, without doubt, the most attended literary meeting.\n\nRegenerationism\n\nRegenerationism was a reformist movement that began in Spain after the Disaster of '98 and lasted until the beginning of Primo de Rivera's dictatorship (1923). The loss of the colonies and the insecurities within the Peninsula brought on some deep and bitter attacks against the Government. Regenerationism wanted to internally transform people so that these changes would project on to the rest of the human activities. The writers of the Spanish Generation of '98 had much in common with those who approved of Regenerationism, and they usually met with one another to discuss Spain's problems.\n\nSpanish schools in Spain were thought of as the main tool through which this could be achieved. Culturally, it was a great time for Spain, almost comparable to the Golden Age, which is why it was named \"The silver Age of Spanish literature\". Although the implemented economic changes were quite successful, the same can't be said for the political ones: several periods of crisis made it impossible for the Restoration to work, and it finally led to Primo de Rivera's dictatorship."}, {"url": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Carlos_Arniches", "page_content": "This category has the following 2 subcategories, out of 2 total.\n\nMedia in category \"Carlos Arniches\"\n\nThe following 6 files are in this category, out of 6 total."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Generation-of-1898", "page_content": "Generation of 1898, also called Generation of \u201998, Spanish Generaci\u00f3n del 1898 or Generaci\u00f3n del \u201998, in Spain, the novelists, poets, essayists, and thinkers active at the time of the Spanish-American War (1898), who reinvigorated Spanish letters and restored Spain to a position of intellectual and literary prominence that it had not held for centuries.\n\nThe shock of Spain\u2019s defeat in the war, which left it stripped of the last vestiges of its empire and its international prestige, provided an impetus for many writers and thinkers to embark on a period of self-searching and an analysis of Spain\u2019s problems and its destiny.\n\nMore From Britannica Spanish literature: The Generation of 1898\n\nThe term Generation of 1898 was used loosely at the turn of the century but was elaborated by the literary critic Azor\u00edn in critical essays that appeared in various periodicals and were collected in his Cl\u00e1sicos y modernos (1913).
