{"In 1963, Hope Cooke met Palden Thondup Namgyal, the Chogyal of Sikkim, while he was on a visit to the United States.": [{"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hope_Cooke", "page_content": "Hope Cooke (born June 24, 1940) was the \"Gyalmo\" (Tibetan: \u0f62\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f63\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f7c\u0f0b, Wylie: rgyal mo) (Queen Consort) of the 12th Chogyal (King) of Sikkim, Palden Thondup Namgyal.[1] Their wedding took place in March 1963. She was termed Her Highness The Crown Princess of Sikkim and became the Gyalmo of Sikkim at Palden Thondup Namgyal's coronation in 1965.[2]\n\nAmerican wife of the last king of Sikkim (born 1940)\n\nQuick facts: Hope Cooke, Queen consort of the 12th Chogyal... \u25bc\n\nPalden Thondup Namgyal eventually was the last king of Sikkim as a protectorate state under India. By 1973, both the country and their marriage were crumbling; soon Sikkim was merged into India. Five months after the takeover of Sikkim had begun, Cooke returned to the United States with her two children and stepdaughter to enroll them in schools in New York City. Cooke and her husband divorced in 1980; Namgyal died of cancer in 1982.[3]\n\nCooke wrote an autobiography, Time Change (Simon & Schuster 1981) and began a career as a lecturer, book critic, and magazine contributor, later becoming an urban historian. In her new life as a student of New York City, Cooke published Seeing New York (Temple University Press 1995); worked as a newspaper columnist (Daily News); and taught at Yale University, Sarah Lawrence College, and Birch Wathen, a New York City private school.[4]"}, {"url": "https://www.historyofroyalwomen.com/the-royal-women/last-gyalmo-sikkim-hope-cooke/", "page_content": "\u201cThe Fairytale Turned Nightmare?\u201d reads the headline of the New York Times from May 1981 referencing to a lesser known American woman who married into a royal family. That woman was Hope Cooke. It was based on her autobiography.\n\nIt spoke about how the American media was enamoured with an American marrying Crown Prince Palden Thondup Namgyal of Sikkim in 1963. The press always heavily followed any trips of theirs to the United States. Vogue wanted to know her beauty secrets. What the media did not know was that this so-called fairy tale was anything but.\n\nHope Cooke was born on 24 June 1940 in San Francisco, California to John J. Cooke and Hope Noyes. When Hope was not yet two, her mother died in a single person plane crash in 1942. Her father then moved her and her sister, Harriet, to New York City with him to an apartment that was across the hall from their maternal grandparents (who Hope claimed were aloof and refused to talk about her mother). Hope and Harriet were raised by governesses; one beat the future royal with a coat hanger when she could not remember the Lord\u2019s Prayer. Their grandfather died when Hope was 12, and their grandmother passed away just three years later when Hope was 15.\n\nFrom then, Hope and Harriet lived with their maternal aunt and uncle; the latter was the former US Ambassador to Iran and Peru. Hope studied at both the Chaplin School in New York and the Madeira School in Virginia. She completed her high school education in Iran.\n\nShe chose to continue her studies and head to university. She enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College in 1959 where she majored in Asian Studies. One summer she travelled to India with her later recalling, \u201cI\u2019ve never been so happy \u2026 India! My heart explodes \u2026 The East is my home\u2026\u201d It was in Darjeeling that she met the recently widowed Palden Thondup Namgyal, Crown Prince of Sikkim.\n\nThey became engaged two years later, in 1961, after bonding over what the New York Times called the \u201csimilar isolation of their childhoods.\u201d The couple did not marry until 1963 due to astrologers claiming 1962 was a bad year for marriages.\n\nThe Crown Prince and Hope wed after the latter had renounced her American citizenship, in a Buddhist monastery on 20 March 1963; their ceremony was officiated by 14 lamas \u2013 the title for a high priest in Tibetian Buddhism. Although the wedding was a Buddhist ceremony, Hope never converted from Christianity. However, she was known to have practised Buddhism from an early age.\n\nTogether, they had two children: Prince Palden Gyurmed Namgyal and Princess Hope Leezum Namgyal. Hope gained three stepchildren (Prince Tenzing Kunzang Jigme Namgyal, Prince Tobgyal Wangchuk Tenzing Namgyal and Princess Yangchen Dolma Namgyal) from the union who she adored. She vowed that her children would know happiness and not grow up with the sad family life like both their parents.\n\nJust two years after their nuptials, the Crown Prince was proclaimed Sikkim\u2019s monarch (Chogyal or King) on 4 April 1965. His reign would be short, as he was deposed ten years later on 10 April 1975. He was put under house arrest in the palace. Not long after, Hope and Palden separated with Hope returning with their two children to the United States.\n\nHope later described her ex-husband as a heavy-drinker, sexist and philanderer. He continued his affair that started before he married Hope with a Belgian woman during their marriage. However, she was not innocent as she was also having an affair with an American man.\n\nHer popularity waned with Newsweek even calling her the Himalayan Marie-Antoinette after Sikkim was annexed into India. A US Representative and US Senator co-sponsored a bill to give Hope her American citizenship back, but the bill would not pass until the language was altered to only give her permanent residence status. President Ford signed it in 1976. She and the Chogyal divorced in 1980. He died just two years later of cancer.\n\nIn 1983, she married for a second time to Mike Wallace, but this union did not last. She resided in London for a time, but she eventually returned to the United States. Hope now works as a writer and lecturer and lives in Brooklyn, New York."}, {"url": "https://theprint.in/pageturner/excerpt/when-hope-cooke-the-american-socialite-wife-of-sikkim-king-asked-for-return-of-darjeeling/659102/", "page_content": "On the demise of Tashi Namgyal in 1963, his second son, Palden Thondup Namgyal, took over as the twelfth ruler of the Namgyal dynasty of Sikkim. Thondup was originally slated to be ordained as a Buddhist monk, and was trained as such till he was eleven, having been recognized as a reincarnated Rinpoche. In 1941, he was enthroned as the Maharaja Kumar, replacing his elder brother, Paljor, who died in a plane crash while serving as an officer in the Royal Indian Air Force.\n\nPalden Thondup married twice. His first wife, Samyo Kushoe Sandeki, was from the Tibetan aristocracy and died in 1957. Sandeki was a popular figure in Sikkim and was widely respected by the people. Palden met a young American socialite, Hope Cooke, in Darjeeling and married her in 1963. His coronation as the Maharaja took place on an astrologically determined auspicious date, 4 April 1965, although he had taken over as ruler on 2 December 1963 after his father\u2019s death. The coronation was a grand ceremony, covered by American and European media that were attracted by another American marrying royalty, following the wedding of Hollywood actress, Grace Kelly, with the ruling Prince of Monaco.\n\nAlso read: For over 10 years, this Sikkim man has kept a lake litter-free at 12,406 ft\n\nPalace intrigue\n\nHope Cooke was ambitious and allowed her naivet\u00e9 to overcome the reality of her position as an \u2018outsider\u2019. She was caught early in the web of palace intrigues and shallow politicking. When my wife and I made our first call on the Chogyal and Gyalmo (queen consort), our initial impression of Hope Cooke was of a young person who had adopted the outward poise of Tibetan aristocracy, reducing the soft tones in which Tibetan ladies expressed themselves to a mostly incomprehensible whisper. She obviously did not realize that she was not taken as seriously as she thought she was by senior courtiers. What is more, she was at the receiving end of Palden Thondup\u2019s favourite sister, Princess Pema Tsedeun, also known as Kukula. Kukula was urbane and politically savvier than her brother. There was an immediate clash of personalities between her and Hope Cooke, with each in her own way trying to exert her influence on the ruler.\n\nOur first meeting with the Chogyal\u2014whose request to be addressed as such and not Maharaja had been acceded to by the Indian government\u2014and the Gyalmo took place in an intimate private sitting room at the palace. It was just the four of us around cups of tea and cakes from Calcutta\u2019s Swiss bakery and cafe, Flurys, along with an array of Sikkimese snacks. The Chogyal was his charming self, ready to discuss everything including politics. It was clear to me that he was trying to gauge whether I would be useful to him in the games he indulged in, of sharpening differences between officials of the political office and the political officer.\n\nThe same attempt was also in play where the relations between the political officer and the divisional commander of the 17th Mountain Division, were concerned. Prior to the visit, I had discussed the call with my boss, N.B. Menon, who let me have his insight into the mind of the Chogyal and his ways. I had little difficulty in reading his motives and the ideas that lay behind them. He was intent on creating confusion that he could take advantage of, in order to achieve his political ambition.\n\nAlso read: The sordid underbelly of \u2018golden state\u2019 Sikkim \u2014 it\u2019s India\u2019s suicide capital\n\nI managed to convey, indirectly, that I would not be part of any political game-playing, suggesting that given the norms of protocolary behaviour as first secretary (I was yet to be promoted to that status), I would of course be in touch with his principal secretary, Jigdal Densappa, and the concerned officials at the Sikkim secretariat. Palden Thondup took the hint and soon thereafter arranged for Karma Topden, the son of his political confidante, Martem Topden, a senior politician and legislator from the Sikkim National Party, to be the one to interact with me on political issues. This was, of course, along with Jigdal Densappa, who was Karma\u2019s mentor.\n\nKarma Topden had been trained in intelligence and was part of the so-called Study Group that was the backup in both political and socio-economic spheres to serve the ruler\u2019s ambitions and interests. It was also the think-tank that advised the Chogyal on all matters related to India. Hope Cooke was involved in broader policy formulations that emerged out of the deliberations of the Study Group that had Jigdal as its administrative head. It was this group, along with a set of legal advisors, that fed the Chogyal\u2019s ambitions to the point where he tended to fail to realistically evaluate the possible.\n\nOne of the outcomes of the deliberations of this group, where Hope Cooke had taken the lead, was to resurrect the controversy surrounding the grant of Darjeeling to the East India Company, adding the twist of asking for its return from India. What lay behind this attempt was the supposition that by placing the Indian government under this kind of pressure, it could force Delhi to negotiate a fresh treaty with Sikkim where in return for a settlement on Darjeeling, Sikkim would ask to be treated as an independent state in a special relationship with India.\n\nAlso read: Coercion, not accommodation \u2014 India and China need a new compact for 3,488-km border\n\nExpanding ambition\n\nTo grant credence to this ambition, Hope Cooke published an article in 1967, putting forward the claim that all land within the territory of Sikkim belonged to the ruler in eternity and as such could only be held in trust till he sought its return. She demanded the return of Darjeeling and its surrounds to the kingdom of Sikkim,1 suggesting that this was what her husband was seeking by revoking the trust deed that had granted Darjeeling to the East India Company. This article contributed to the atmosphere of distrust between the Chogyal and the Indian government, and it was felt that Hope Cooke was a \u2018trojan horse\u2019 planted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Sikkim. It was also a wake-up call to the mandarins in South Block, both at the prime minister\u2019s office and the ministry of external affairs.\n\nThe Chogyal was informed in no uncertain terms that this attempt at muddying issues was unacceptable and that his wife was stepping into dangerous waters. Hope Cooke, of course, was also playing to the gallery. By bringing Darjeeling into the Sikkim\u2013India equation, she felt that both the Bhutia and the Gurkha elements of the Nepali population would ensure that they endorsed her husband and his will to get a revision of the Treaty of 1950. In this endeavour she was unsuccessful, as the bulk of the Nepali and many among the Bhutia hierarchy were suspicious of her. This was also part of the palace politics and intrigues let loose by Kukula against her sister-in-law, the Gyalmo.\n\nEven among the top Sikkimese bureaucracy, there were quite a few who resented Hope Cooke\u2019s attempts to interfere and put barriers in the way of their dealings with the palace on matters of administration and policy. This resentment was to reach a climax when a pliant Indian Civil Service officer, I.S. Chopra, was selected by Foreign Secretary T.N. Kaul to take over the post of the principal administrative officer in Gangtok. Chopra, falling under the blandishments of Palden Thondup, accepted the title of \u2018Sidelong\u2019, a Tibetan title equivalent to the designation of \u2018prime minister\u2019. He in turn bent before the Chogyal and Hope Cooke\u2019s wishes to the point where he pressurized the chief secretary to divert plan funds provided by India in favour of projects that benefitted the Bhutia interests adding to the feelings of alienation of the Nepali majority.\n\nI.S. Chopra was unfit for the job entrusted to him. He was protocol-conscious and attempted to undercut N.B. Menon, who may have been junior to him in the foreign service but was the senior interlocutor between Delhi and the Chogyal. P.N. Haksar as the principal secretary to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had no confidence in Chopra, describing him as someone who had \u2018no loyalties to anything and least of all to his own country. But he was a friend of the Foreign Secretary (T.N.Kaul) and has always been a smooth operator. Having become the Dewan of Sikkim, he could not care less what happened to Indo-Sikkimese relations.\u2019"}, {"url": "https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/01/30/Palden-Thondup-Namgyal-king-of-Sikkim-dies/8485381214800/", "page_content": "NEW YORK -- The deposed King of Sikkim, who captured the world's imagination with his fairy-tale wedding to New York socialite Hope Cooke but then was forced from his birthright throne, died Friday night.

Picture it: The year is 1963. The place is Sikkim, which is currently one of India\u2019s states but which was once a little more complicated. Per Wiki:\n\nSikkim is a state in northeastern India. It borders Tibet in the north and northeast, Bhutan in the east, Nepal in the west, and West Bengal in the south. Sikkim is also close to India\u2019s Siliguri Corridor near Bangladesh. Sikkim is the least populous and second smallest among the Indian states. A part of the Eastern Himalaya, Sikkim is notable for its biodiversity, including alpine and subtropical climates, as well as being a host to Kangchenjunga, the highest peak in India and third highest on Earth\u2026.The Kingdom of Sikkim was founded by the Namgyal dynasty in the 17th century. It was ruled by Buddhist priest-kings known as the Chogyal. It became a princely state of British India in 1890. Following Indian independence, Sikkim continued its protectorate status with the Union of India after 1947, and the Republic of India after 1950. It enjoyed the highest literacy rate and per capita income among Himalayan states. In 1973, anti-royalist riots took place in front of the Chogyal\u2019s palace. In 1975, after the Indian Army took over the city of Gangtok, a referendum was held that led to the deposition of the monarchy and Sikkim joining India as its 22nd state.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like marrying a prince and then getting deposed \u2014 as the rulers at the time of the deposition of said monarchy were our bride and groom here, Palden Thondup Namgyal and Hope Cooke. She took the kids and went to New York five months into her husband\u2019s subsequent house arrest and basically never came back. They were having issues anyway, as they both had had affairs and he also seems like he was somewhat difficult \u2014 at one point, he threw her record player out a window, and he had a drinking problem. He shortly thereafter ODed on barbiturates, but did not die, and they eventually got divorced in 1980. I STRONGLY recommend you read this New York Times review of her autobiography, which I now want to read, as it is eyebrow-raisingly interesting. Hope Cooke has led a life right out of a Judith Krantz novel. (She\u2019s still alive and kicking around Brooklyn \u2014 or at least she was as of 1993, per this ALSO very interesting New York Times piece about her walking tours.) (I mean, she is definitely still alive. She simply may have moved.)\n\nThe short background: Her family was awful; Her mother died when the plane she was piloting solo crashed (perhaps intentionally) and her father subsequently bailed, so Hope and her sister and a series of extremely mean governesses lived across the hallway from Hope\u2019s (also mean!) grandparents. She and the Crown Prince met and fell in love when she went on a summer trip to India at 19. They bonded, it is implied, because they were both sort of sad souls; he was a widower whose childhood was also fraught, in no small part because, as Wiki puts it, \u201chis plans to study science at Cambridge were dashed when his elder brother, the crown prince, a member of the Indian Air Force was killed in a plane crash in 1941.\u201d (Surely their shared history of family plane crash tragedy helped bond them, if nothing else.) After the wedding, she was embraced as \u2014 as the NYT puts it \u2014 the \u201cGrace Kelly of the Himalayas\u201d until the deposition of the monarchy, at which point Newsweek allegedly switched the metaphor to Marie Antoinette. (A burn that I\u2019ve read reported in various articles in other publications but couldn\u2019t find in its original source; I do feel confident that the turn of events upending the monarchy in Sikkim was probably not wholly about her spending.)\n\nThe Washington Post, in a very interesting piece dating from around the divorce, writes of the wedding:\n\nFrom the beginning, though, it was the oddness that danced a dark shadow over her chances for happiness. Bad enough that her husband waltzed his other conquests in front of her on their wedding day, worse still was her sister-in-law, the elegantly beautiful, haughty Cocoola, who remarked on the eve of her wedding how inauspicious it would be if anything were to break, and then broke a saucer, scattering the millet seed it contained, a bad sign in itself. \u201cWorse still,\u201d Cooke writes in her autobiography, \u201cTime Change,\u201d \u201cthe more I look[ed] at the brocade pattern of my wedding dress, the more it seem[ed] that it had been stitched with the wrong side exposed. In Sikkim, a sign of death. Still, she lit the butter lamps in front of the images of Buddha and Guru Padmasambhava and offered a long white scarf to her father-in-law while 12 ambassadors, including John Kenneth Galbraith, and half the world\u2019s press looked on. The wedding festivities lasted a week.\n\nYou can see that ritual with the scarf here:\n\nThere aren\u2019t a ton of photos of this wedding beyond these two, which is a shame, as it looks like it was a very interesting ceremony. There is however, British newsreel footage that feels pretty comprehensive:\n\nIf only it were in color!\n\n[Photos: Shutterstock]"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/palden_thondup.namgyal/2119676", "page_content": "Palden Thondup Namgyal\n\npolitician\n\nMarch 23, 1923 (age 58) Gangtok, East Sikkim district, India\n\nAt six, Namgyal became a student at Saint Joseph\"s Convent in Kalimpong, but had to terminate his studies due to attacks of malaria. Namgyal served as adviser for internal affairs for his father, Sir Tashi Namgyal, the 11th Chogyal, and led the negotiating team which established Sikkim\"s relationship to India after independence in 1949.

In 1975, as the result of a referendum, Sikkim became a state of India and the monarchy abolished. He opposed the referendum and the annexation to India.

Upon returning to New York, Miss Cooke, an orphan, told her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Selden Chapin, who had reared her, that she was in love with a prince.\n\nFor nearly a decade after their marriage, the King and his gyalmo, or consort, sought to bring the 20th century to Sikkim. He built schools, roads and hospitals and he encouraged establishment of small handcraft industries, such as rug-making and scarf manufacturing. Among his enthusiasms was an experimental tea plantation. The Chogyal 's downfall came as a result of his increasingly cool relations wit h India and with antiroyalist political leaders in Sikkim itself . In 1973, India, which had always considered Sikkim of strategic imp ortance because of its China border, apparently decided that the Chog yal had gone far enough in his campaign for Sikkimese autonomy.\n\nThere have been conflicting versions of how the King was stripped of his power and reduced to a figurehead in 1973. The Indian Government of Indira Ghandi called it a coup staged by the Chogyal's Sikkimese political opponents. India said it had merely not opposed the coup and had sent in paramilitary police forces at the Chogyal's own request to maintain order in a land that was its official protectorate. Indians Called Invaders\n\nBut loyalists contended that there had been no internal coup, and that the King had been forced by Indian officials to sign papers surrendering his power. The loyalists said the Indian troops had, in effect, been an invasion force."}]}
