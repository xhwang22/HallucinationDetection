Yet, the late Pistols manager got one thing right: punk has never shied away from duking it out with mainstream politics. After all, if we recall punk\u2019s original manifesto, wasn\u2019t one of the main principles meant to be the adoption of an anti-establishment stance and a rejection of the political idealism of the day?\n\nPublic enemies\n\nCertainly, a strong political content is a common thread that weaves itself through the history of punk since the genre emerged as a musical force on both sides of the Atlantic during the mid-to-late 70s. Starting as they meant to go on, Sex Pistols immediately put the wind up the authorities by swearing on prime-time TV on the Today show, and they effectively became Public Enemy No.1 after the police shut down their infamous River Thames jubilee boat cruise in June 1977.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Pistols\u2019 legendary singles \u201cAnarchy In The UK\u201d and \u201cGod Save The Queen\u201d remain the clearest manifesto of punk politics on record, drawing the blueprint for virtually every political punk song of value, while The Clash\u2019s self-titled 1977 debut contained Summer Of Hate-era classics \u201cCareer Opportunities,\u201d \u201cLondon\u2019s Burning,\u201d and their smart punky reggae cover of Junior Murvin\u2019s \u201cPolice & Thieves,\u201d dealing with issues such as unemployment, civil unrest, and police oppression \u2013 all topics which have since become political punk footballs.\n\nPunk also aligned itself with socio-political movements early on, with The Clash, The Ruts, Tom Robinson Band, Sham 69, and Stiff Little Fingers playing gigs in support of Rock Against Racism in the UK in 1978-79. Indeed, even as punk began to fragment into differing factions, those informed by punk\u2019s ethics often retained a political focus, with The Slits, The Raincoats, and Gang Of Four tackling questions of consumerism and gender politics, and the growing political awareness of The Jam\u2019s leader, Paul Weller, leading him to pen classic songs such as \u201cMr Clean,\u201d \u201cDown In The Tube Station At Midnight,\u201d and \u201cEton Rifles,\u201d in which he addressed political issues including right-wing-related violence and the British class system.\n\nThe Jam - Down In The Tube Station At Midnight\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nChanging political regimes in both the US and UK in the 80s also impacted on punk. Californian punk trailblazers Dead Kennedys\u2019 first two singles, \u201cCalifornia \u00dcber Alles\u201d and \u201cHoliday In Cambodia,\u201d attacked political targets at home (Californian governor Jerry Brown) and abroad (Cambodian dictator Pol Pot), but, during the 80s, the band led the charge against America\u2019s new conservative Republican president, Ronald Reagan, releasing brilliantly satirical albums such as Plastic Surgery Disasters and Frankenchrist, and organizing a series of Rock Against Reagan concerts.\n\nHow does it feel?\n\nThe era\u2019s domestically repressive regime also helped spawn a newer breed of harder, faster \u201chardcore\u201d punk acts such as California\u2019s Black Flag, blistering Washington DC punk-reggae fusionists Bad Brains, and the same city\u2019s Minor Threat, who advocated a \u201cstraight edge\u201d mentality, abstaining from drink, drugs and eating meat \u2013 a philosophy akin to the UK punk collective Crass, whose anarcho-punk philosophy also put the emphasis on animal rights, feminism and ecological issues, while openly rejecting the methods of the mainstream music industry.\n\nBlack Flag - Rats Eyes - (Live at the Bierkellar, Leeds, UK, 1984)\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nThe punk politics of Crass and the UK\u2019s other leading anarcho-punk outfits, such as Poison Girls and Conflict, also stood in vehement opposition to the British Conservative government, led by Margaret Thatcher, as did other pacifist-inclined UK punks such as Discharge and Charged GBH, who played a faster, more aggressive brand of punk (often now referred to as \u201cUK82\u201d) influenced by metal pioneers Mot\u00f6rhead.\n\nDuring the 80s, punk politics also led the charge in response to the UK\u2019s brief but devastating war with Argentina over the Falklands Islands. Though coming from very different ends of the spectrum, new wave star Elvis Costello\u2019s yearning \u201cShipbuilding\u201d (performed by Robert Wyatt) and Crass\u2019 seething anthem \u201cHow Does It Feel (To Be The Mother Of A Thousand Dead)?\u201d were among the most resonant responses to the conflict. Later in the decade, punk-era luminaries such as Paul Weller, Billy Bragg and Tom Robinson also threw their weight behind a collective called Red Wedge, designed to foster support for the Labour Party against the Margaret Thatcher-led Conservatives in the UK\u2019s 1987 election.\n\nIn the US, President George HW Bush failed to inspire the same level of rage as Ronald Reagan, though, in January 1991, punk played a major part during a memorable Gulf War protest concert staged in front of the White House while he was in residence. Organized by Washington DC activist collective Positive Force and headlined by ex-Minor Threat mainstay Ian MacKaye\u2019s second legendary punk outfit, Fugazi, the event attacked both America\u2019s burgeoning homelessness problem and North America\u2019s involvement in Iraq.\n\nFormidable agents of change\n\nDuring the 90s\u2019 alt.rock revolution, US bands such as Green Day, Rancid, and The Offspring inadvertently dragged punk politics back into the mainstream. However, after the horrific events of 9/11, President George W Bush came to represent everything that was wrong with US politics, and the country\u2019s punks protested en masse in the early years of the 21st Century.\n\nRecalling Dead Kennedys\u2019 Rock Against Reagan shows, punk outfit NOFX organized a series of Rock Against Bush concerts and compilations which drew widespread support from the contemporary punk community. A little later, in 2004, punk politics again hit the headlines when Green Day\u2019s outspoken American Idiot album (written partially in response to the band\u2019s view that the media was brainwashing the US public) arrived in a sleeve with artwork inspired by Chinese Communist propaganda, yet went on to sell six million copies in the States and reignited the band\u2019s popularity with a younger generation.\n\nThe digital age has made grassroots punk activism easier to organize, and punk as a potent political force continues to rear its head. In 2012, Russian feminist punk collective Pussy Riot became household names after three of their members were sent to prison for \u201chooliganism motivated by religious hatred\u201d following their arrest during a guerrilla gig at Moscow\u2019s Cathedral Of Christ The Saviour. Elsewhere, Icelandic punk turned politician Jon Gnarr formed the Best Party in the wake of the country\u2019s financial meltdown, in 2008, and, after he was elected mayor of Reykjavik, his party of ex-punks successfully ran the country for four years, employing ideals based upon Crass\u2019 anarcho-punk philosophy.\n\nAnti-Flag - American Attraction\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nIn the US, too, the country\u2019s most politically-aware alt.rockers remain vigilant in the age of fake news and alternative facts. To this end, punk-influenced grunge stars Pearl Jam recently donated 90 percent of the profits from their Seattle stadium shows to helping the city\u2019s homeless, while acts such as Pittsburgh punks Anti-Flag and incendiary rap-punk crossover supergroup Prophets Of Rage continue to speak eloquently against injustice.\n\nNone of it will take us back to 1977 for a second time, but the best of our politically-motivated punk bands have it in them to be formidable agents of change.\n\nListen to the best punk music on Spotify."}, {"url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/nofx-break-up-2023-1234586045/", "page_content": "NOFX will call it quits in 2023. \u201cFat Mike\u201d Burkett, singer and bassist of the punk rock group, announced the pending split in a reply to an Instagram comment on an unrelated post, noting that next year \u201cwill be our last year.\u201d Rolling Stone has confirmed the news.\n\nAsked why the band doesn\u2019t come to Canada more often, Fat Mike replied, \u201cActually, we love Canada, it\u2019s just that next year will be our last year.

With the Republican National Convention one week away, this inaugural column explores the many ways in which punk has inserted itself into presidential politics.\n\nSince its inception in the 1970s, punk rock has never shied from jumping into the ring with mainstream politics. The genre (or the movement, if you prefer) positioned itself as a rejection of political idealism from the outset, whether it was the Sex Pistols hijacking Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s Silver Jubilee or Dead Kennedys using the occasion of their first single to declare California Governor Jerry Brown a fascist pig.\n\nRelated Video\n\nAs punk evolved over the years, it split into subgenres with different ideologies and approaches to politics. In the \u201880s, DIY hardcore bands such as Fugazi and the Minutemen took a more ground-level view, their rigid ethical stance based less on getting out the vote than on playing safe, affordable shows at non-corporate venues. Other American punk bands, such as New York City\u2019s Reagan Youth and Michigan\u2019s Crucifucks, took a different tack, aggressively (and often hilariously) confronting national movements such as the Young Republicans and the Christian Right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the years passed and the White House swapped residents, punk saw its place in the national political conversation shift, too. The \u201890s brought the rise of pop punk and emo, subgenres that predominantly cast politics aside in favor of a more palatable brand of male romanticism. Bands such as Green Day and enterprises such as the Vans Warped Tour solidified punk\u2019s connection with mainstream culture, giving the genre more of a platform but making it harder to take seriously.\n\nRage Against the Machine and other outspoken groups counteracted this trend somewhat, but they also had to work from within an uncomfortably corporate framework to spread their radically progressive, anti-consumerist ideas (\u201cKnow Your Enemy\u201d, right?). The disastrous presidency of George W. Bush gave punk bands an easy target in the 2000s, but the genre was growing into an easier target itself.\n\nThese days, it\u2019s difficult to tell what role punk rock has in shaping political narratives. In light of the Black Lives Matter movement and the growing focus on racial inequality, hip-hop and R&B seem like the more potent vehicles for social change. While artists such as Kendrick Lamar and Beyonc\u00e9 steer the national conversation toward more progressive issues (and take legitimate risks in doing so), punk is hanging out on the fringes, a traditionally white, traditionally male genre searching for a new injection of relevancy. Groups such as Downtown Boys and G.L.O.S.S. are a good start, as is, surprisingly, the newly formed supergroup Prophets of Rage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the Republican National Convention and its attendant dunghill set to invade Cleveland next week, the US is on the brink of what once seemed unthinkable: a presidential election starring combustible potato sack and progressive Public Enemy No.1 Donald J. Trump. If Trump\u2019s positions on immigration (kick \u2018em out), foreign policy (kill \u2018em all), and civil liberties (take \u2018em away) aren\u2019t enough to get punk engine\u2019s back into full swing, nothing will be. Fortunately, it looks as if things are already headed that way, according to rumors that Prophets of Rage may attempt to crash the RNC and kick off a presidential season in which punk may actually mean something.\n\nIn light of this development, and in honor of scumbag politicians everywhere, let\u2019s look back on the past five commanders-in-chief and consider what the prominent punk musicians of the time had to say about them. This is by no means an exhaustive history, but hopefully it functions as a reminder of a time in presidential politics when punks weren\u2019t content to sit on the sidelines.\n\nThe Reagan Era (1981\u20131989)\n\nRock Against Reagan concert flyer\n\nPunk may have been born under Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, but it came of age during the Reagan years. Swept into office on a wave of hardcore conservatism, Ronald Reagan was the direct result of white Americans feeling scared about an influx of minorities and trying desperately to hold onto a way of life rooted in a steep economic advantage over everyone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis, of course, was the exact way of life punks at the time were so intent on rebelling against. Black Flag released \u201cWhite Minority\u201d in 1980, the same year Reagan successfully ran for office, and the song\u2019s lyrics drip with sarcasm. \u201cGonna be a white minority!,\u201d screams Latino vocalist Ron Reyes, stoking the fears of white suburbanites and revealing the underlying racism fueling Reagan\u2019s campaign.\n\nDead Kennedys also led the charge against Reagan, helping to organize a series of concerts called \u201cRock Against Reagan\u201d in cities such as San Francisco, Washington, DC, and Dallas. Joined by MDC and other political punk bands featured on singer Jello Biafra\u2019s independent Alternative Tentacles label, Dead Kennedys drew headlines with public, provocative performances at Dolores Park and DC\u2019s National Mall.\n\nPerhaps the best way to calculate punk\u2019s response to Reagan, however, is simply to look at the artwork that dominated punk singles and LPs at the time. The Gipper inspired an impressive amount of obscene and hilarious illustrations, several of which poked fun at his penchant for jellybeans and others which made no qualms about comparing him to hate groups such as the KKK and Hitler\u2019s Nazis. Flyers everywhere advertised bands with names like Reagan Youth, Domino Theory, Agnostic Front, and Capitol Punishment, all expressing their distaste for the neoliberal policies that dominated the Reagan era.\n\nThe George H. W. Bush Era (1989\u20131993)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFugazi at the White House // Photo via Dischord Records\n\nThe milquetoast George H. W. Bush failed to inspire the same level of rage as his predecessor, but punk maintained a healthy stance of opposition throughout his short presidency. No event embodies the punk spirit of this era more fully than the Gulf War protest concert staged in front of the White House on January, 12, 1991. Organized by the activist collective Positive Force and headlined by DIY post-punk legends Fugazi, the event was initially conceived as a response to America\u2019s homelessness problem. It morphed into something more geopolitical in scope when Bush announced the beginning of Operation Desert Storm.\n\nThanks to the genre\u2019s rise in mainstream culture, other punk bands were pulled into Desert Storm in ways they had never intended. The Clash\u2019s \u201cRock the Casbah\u201d \u2014 a song loosely inspired by Iran\u2019s ban on Western music \u2014 was reportedly the first song Armed Forces Radio chose to broadcast during the operation, which probably isn\u2019t what the band had envisioned. In any case, punk remained a vital force throughout the first years of the \u201890s, as evidenced by the rise of riot grrrl, an explicitly politicized feminist movement with origins in DC\u2019s self-publishing culture.\n\nThe Clinton Era (1993\u20132001)\n\nAlbum Cover: Fugazi \u2013 In on the Kill Taker (1993)\n\nIf you think a Democratic president might incite less ire among the punk community than a Republican, you\u2019re both right and wrong. Bill Clinton\u2019s election in 1993 was less of a reaction against conservatism than it was an indictment of Bush\u2019s ineffectual first term, and the new president was about the furthest from revolutionary a politician could be. Punks gave Clinton some time to prove them wrong, but they responded with vigor once they realized he was more of the same. A case in point: Rage Against the Machine hosted a radio broadcast in Los Angeles on the night of Clinton\u2019s second Presidential inauguration, inviting other musicians and political commentators to voice their displeasures over a rigged political system. Later, the band would hold a free concert at the 2000 Democratic National Convention to usher in a tumultuous end to the Clinton era.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, the Clinton years are defined more by general angst than by a direct movement opposed to the sitting President. While punk shifted to a more pop-friendly sound in the mid-\u201990s, popular bands such as Green Day, Blink-182, and The Offspring steered away from controversy by writing more or less apolitical songs. Bands such as Rage and Fugazi carried the mantle, with the former attempting to fly the American flag upside down on SNL in protest of Republican presidential nominee Steve Forbes and the latter releasing two of their most politicized records, 1993\u2019s In on the Kill Taker and 1995\u2019s Red Medicine, during Clinton\u2019s first term as President.\n\nThe George W. Bush Era (2001\u20132009)\n\nGeorge W. Bush gave punk rock the easiest, juiciest target since Reagan, and bands took the bait with a level of enthusiasm that hadn\u2019t registered since the late \u201880s. Presiding over one of the most disastrous presidencies in US history in the aftermath of 9/11, Bush came to represent everything wrong with American politics, from the corporate greed that led to the invasion of Iraq to the Christian conservatism that led to a radically right-wing remake of the Supreme Court (and thus restricted rights for gays and women).\n\nThe biggest punk pushback against the Bush presidency came in the form of the Rock Against Bush and Punk Voter projects, both founded by Fat Mike of NOFX and Fat Wreck Chords. A direct descendant of the Rock Against Reagan campaign of the \u201880s, Rock Against Bush consisted of a series of concerts and compilation albums conceived in opposition to the Iraq War and the Bush presidency in general. The compilations featured entries from the likes of Alkaline Trio, Sum 41, Descendents, and other hugely popular punk bands that weren\u2019t exactly known for taking a strong stance on anything beyond their current love life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is probably what made Rock Against Bush so impactful; whether Fat Mike knew it or not, he was mobilizing the punk community in a way that hadn\u2019t been seen in over a decade. All of this in spite of the rising emo trend, which showered itself in eyeliner and male insecurity and threatened to push punk rock permanently into joke territory. Thankfully, Drive-Thru Records and the like didn\u2019t succeed.\n\nFat Wreck Chords, on the other hand, had a goddamn field day with Bush. Aside from the comps, the label featured some of the most pointed Bush criticism of the era. Against Me!\u2019s 2005 album, Searching for a Former Clarity, stands apart as the best of the label\u2019s anti-Bush screeds (it even features a bizarro love song for Condoleezza Rice). Against Me! have obviously come to symbolize the struggle for gender equality, but before that, the band did everything they could to position themselves as a force in presidential politics. Hence their appearance in a PSA for Rock the Vote in the lead-up to the 2008 presidential election, which met with mixed reviews from the true believers but probably did end up getting some butts off the couch.\n\nThe Obama Era (2009\u2013Present)\n\nLooking around America circa 2008, it would have been difficult to find any progressive voices \u2014 punk or otherwise \u2014 criticizing Barack Obama. The moderate liberal US Senator from Illinois rode into the office on a wave of goodwill, promising sweeping changes from the way things had been under Bush. Not everyone from the punk community bought into Obama immediately, though. In an open letter posted to the Alternative Tentacles website, Biafra voiced his hesitance:\n\nYou are the first president in my lifetime to have a bona fide grassroots movement behind you and ready to rock. I hope those crowds\u2019 hope and urgency has penetrated deeply enough that you won\u2019t let that bridge be washed away.\n\nI remember another person who had the audacity to exploit and toss aside people\u2019s hope, and his name is Bill Clinton. Democrats fail time and again when they shirk responsibility and settle for being dealmakers instead of leaders. As important as it is to find common ground and build consensus for change, our situation is so dire we cannot afford any more dealmakers. The people voted for a leader. Anything less risks breaking the hearts of an entire galvanized generation who may then decide it is not worth it to get involved and participate any more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther politically outspoken punk musicians took a softer stance on Obama, including Fat Mike, who hailed his second election in 2012 as a \u201cslam dunk\u201d and sent Punk Voter to an early grave. Punk music in general has lost a great deal of its anti-establishment mojo in the years since Obama came into office, partially because the critics have become less outspoken and partially because, well, punk may not be the prescription we need anymore.\n\nJust look at the 2016 election and its most vocal progressive candidate, Bernie Sanders. Though Sanders bowed out of the race this week, his campaign was notable for inspiring a level of support among the music community that had never been seen before. The 74-year-old Vermont senator\u2019s democratic socialist platform inspired events such as Brooklyn Is Berning and the Red Hot Chili Peppers\u2019 Feel the Bern concert in LA. Smaller punk benefits have been held in cities across the country, but prominent punk voices have largely been muted. The sexier and/or more vocal endorsements \u2014 Killer Mike, Lil B, Jenny Lewis \u2014 came from other genres (though punk notables, including Biafra and Mike Watt, did sign an endorsement on Sanders\u2019 website).\n\nDesign by Mark Mendez and Rob Campbell\n\nSanders may no longer be an option, but the punk community needs to get its political act together in a hurry. Whatever Prophets of Rage are planning for the RNC next week may serve as a catalyst or invitation for punk voices to return to mainstream politics. But it\u2019s just as likely to register as a blip, an aberration in an era when punk and alternative music don\u2019t hold the same cultural sway they once did. For the sake of the genre and the country\u2019s health, it\u2019s high time that punk rock started fucking shit up again."}, {"url": "https://www.lyricsondemand.com/n/nofxlyrics/thepunksonglyrics.html", "page_content": "Am I supposed to do things right?

Crass Records Formed in England 1977, Crass were one of the founders of political punk and the founders of the anarcho-punk movement. The band picked up many ideals from bands from the \u201860s, and in addition to spreading their anarchist beliefs, the band advocated feminism, anti-racism, environmentalism and animal rights. While the band\u2019s political beliefs are easy to lay out, their sound is not. It\u2019s often confusing to the uninitiated. Angry rants are laid out alongside heavy blasts of hardcore guitar and drum noise and interspersed with tape loops and sound collages.

Fat Wreck Chords A relatively recent arrival to the political punk scene, Anti-Flag is still one of the most political, standing up against war and capitalism, and addressing such issues as fascism in the punk scene, American foreign policy and racism. Their anti-capitalist position attracted a lot of criticism when they signed with RCA Records. Detractors said the band had sold out and would lose its passion and voice. Anti-Flag\u2019s best defense against this was to simply not tone down their message or stance, and to let their music speak for itself.

Minor Threat frontman Ian MacKaye has gone on to front many other influential groups, most notably Fugazi, and to co-found Dischord Records, a label with a strong identity and DIY ethics. Essential album: Complete Discography\n\nTrademark political song: \"Straight Edge\"\n\nAgainst Me! Searching For a Former Clarity. Fat Wreck Chords Arguably one of the most popular modern anarchist bands, Against Me! has helped bring anarchist ideals to the masses, as well as the ever-popular anti-war, anti-Bush stance. The band combines elements of the original anarcho-punk movement and folk rock, and ends up coming across as a band less focused on a genre, and more intent on expressing their ideas effectively through simply making great music. Essential album: Searching For A Former Clarity\n\nTrademark political song: \"White People For Peace\"\n\nNOFX Punk In Drublic. Epitaph Records The clown princes of political punk rock, NOFX veers toward satire with their politics. Nobody is safe from Fat Mike\u2019s sarcasm, and the band has, over the years, targeted political, social, religious and gender-based issues. NOFX also makes a point of avoiding mainstream media and major record labels. They made few videos, and would not let them air on MTV or similar music channels. Fat Mike founded Fat Wreck Chords, the label responsible for the Rock Against Bush compilations. He is also the man behind Punk Voter, an organization focused on getting America\u2019s youth registered to vote and educated on political issues. Essential album: Punk In Drublic\n\nTrademark political song: \"The Brews\"\n\nPropaghandi Less Talk, More Rock. Fat Wreck Chords A Canadian anarchist band, Propaghandi is another band that managed to be overtly political, while still maintaining a hook and not sounding overly preachy. Although recent releases have found the band exploring more metal-based influences, their earlier records were pop-punk explosions that attacked racism, capitalism and just about any other -ism the band could think of. Chris Hannah and Jord Samolesky, founders of Propaghandi, also founded the now-defunct record label, G7 Welcoming Committee, a label focused on giving a voice to bands and political speakers who had radical points of view. Essential album: Less Talk, More Rock\n\nTrademark political song: \"And We Thought That Nation-States Were a Bad Idea\" (Free Download)\n\nRise Against The Sufferer & The Witness. Geffen Recordings While this Chicago hardcore band\u2019s \u201cpet issue\u201d is animal rights and vegetarianism (along with their open support of PETA), and speaking out against sport hunting, factory farming and other animal rights-related issues, Rise Against, especially vocalist Tim McIlrath, is openly liberal in many other areas, speaking out for human rights (as well as animal) and against the current political administration. Their video for \u201cReady to Fall\u201d was a sometimes disturbing look at environmental issues and the way they affect wildlife, and animal cruelty in general. It can be viewed here. Trademark political song: \"Drones\"\n\nDead Kennedys Fresh Fruit For Rotting Vegetables. Cleopatra Records A major player in the \u201880s hardcore scene, the Dead Kennedys were critical of \u201880s capitalism and culture, taking aim at the Reagan administration and economic policies, and the commercialization of punk rock music. In 1986, the band was brought up for obscenity charges based on a Giger poster included with their album Frankenchrist. The band was eventually acquitted, though they disbanded during the trial, due to legal costs. After the band\u2019s breakup, frontman Jello Biafra went to become a spoken word activist, politician and a co-founder of Alternative Tentacles, a label with a partial political focus. Essential album: Fresh Fruit For Rotting Vegetables\n\nTrademark political song: \"California Uber Alles\"\n\nI Object! Teaching Revenge. Alternative Tentacles One of the most fiercely political hardcore bands running at the moment, upstate New York\u2019s I Object! stands behind the straightedge vegan lifestyle. Fronted by Barb Object, the band tackles a wide range of issues, from abortion to healthcare to prison reform, and presents issues in a positive way, motivating for change. A refreshing part of the band\u2019s politics that sets them apart from many similar bands is their ideal that veganism and straightedge are personal decisions, and that preaching either way of life or being militant about it simply makes people uncomfortable and causes division in the punk scene.
