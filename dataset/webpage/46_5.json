During Lombardi's nine years as coach of the Packers, Lionel Aldridge was the only rookie to start a season opener.\n\nAlthough Aldridge might have been more steady than spectacular over the course of his career, Lombardi's early faith in him was a tribute in itself. In fact, Aldridge started the first 45 games of his career under Lombardi before missing the fourth game of the 1966 season with an ankle injury.\n\nAfter the Packers won a second consecutive NFL championship in 1962, Lombardi traded veteran Bill Quinlan and created an opening at right defensive end with no obvious heir apparent. Veteran free agent Urban Henry, who wasn't re-signed by the Los Angeles Rams after missing the 1962 season with a neck injury, and No. 1 draft pick Dave Robinson were considered the frontrunners heading into camp. However, the Packers decided to play Robinson at linebacker when he reported late following the College All-Star Game and Aldridge beat out Henry.\n\nAldridge came into his own when the Packers won an unprecedented three straight NFL championships under the league's playoff format from 1965 to 1967. He started all eight postseason games during that stretch and then continued to hold forth at right end until midway through the 1971 season.\n\nOver his eight-and-a-half years as an established starter, Aldridge missed only three games, a notable achievement when you consider he broke his leg once and had some ankle issues. The worst of his injuries occurred in a mid-August preseason game in 1967 when Aldridge broke a bone in his lower left leg. He missed only the first two regular-season games, didn't start but appeared in the third, and then played roughly three-quarters of the game in a hard-fought victory over Detroit in Week 4. Lombardi, who had little compassion for injured players and rarely saluted them when they played hurt, heaped praise on Aldridge after the game. \"Aldridge deserves a lot of credit for the way he came back so fast from his injury,\" Lombardi said."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-10-27-sp-16847-story.html", "page_content": "Times Staff Writer\n\nAs professional athletes 20 years ago, Lionel Aldridge and Willie Davis were the defensive ends on one of the great football teams of all time, Vince Lombardi\u2019s Green Bay Packers, winners of Super Bowls I and II.\n\nYears later, out of football, they wound up traveling widely divergent paths.\n\nBy 1977, Davis was a millionaire. Aldridge was well on his way to becoming a bum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith a business school background at the University of Chicago--pursued during his Packer off-seasons--Davis had become, as he continues to be, one of the most successful beer distributors and radio entrepreneurs in the West.\n\nA former sociology major at Utah State, Aldridge launched an equally impressive career in radio broadcasting and network TV--in the midst of which he was abruptly knocked down, and almost out, by mental illness.\n\nAldridge is a paranoid schizophrenic. But at first, his doctors diagnosed the wrong illness and treated him with the wrong medicine. Within months, he was into the wretched life of a vagrant.\n\nIn the flop houses and rescue missions of America, Aldridge\u2019s nightmare lasted for a ghastly decade, costing him his wife and family, his jobs in radio and television, other jobs, most of his friends, his money, and eventually his self-respect.\n\nIf the people who once knew him best thought of him at all in those days, they thought, very wrongly, that Aldridge was a classic manic depressive--on the loose.\n\nWillie Davis, who runs his many businesses from an office in South-Central Los Angeles, only heard about the nightmare when Aldridge called one day after hitch-hiking into Skid Row downtown, where he touched up his old buddy for $3. Davis gave him $300 and got him a hotel room, from which Aldridge promptly dropped from sight.\n\nThen two years ago, Aldridge telephoned again, this time from Milwaukee. The nightmare was over. He was taking the right medication, Aldridge said. And he was working again, as an account representative at the Milwaukee post office and part-time in radio.\n\nHe was also in a cheerful, new eighth-floor apartment overlooking Lake Michigan on the city\u2019s fashionable East Side.\n\n\u201cLionel had come back from the gates of hell,\u201d Davis said the other day, recalling that phone call in 1985. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a conversation with anyone that affected me that much.\n\n\u201cFor weeks afterward, I would catch myself whistling or humming to myself, and I\u2019d ask, \u2018Why the hell am I feeling so good?\u2019 Then I\u2019d remember: Lionel is back.\u201d\n\nOne day last month at a community college in Milwaukee, Aldridge spent his noon hour away from the post office--as he so often does--on a speaking engagement.\n\nTalking to a roomful of students at Milwaukee Area Technical College, he said:\n\n\u201cI could be mad at somebody because I got sick. It was society that allowed me to become a bum and pull cigarette butts off the streets and out of ash trays.\n\n\u201cAnd I could be angry at God for giving me this disease.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve made a decision not to be bitter. I have done it for one reason. I didn\u2019t get well until I quit blaming God and society--and took the responsibility for myself myself.\n\n\u201cHere I am, a black man, (lecturing) white college students, but I feel very deeply about this. You--all of you--are responsible for you. Nobody is going to ride up and rescue you. . . . I know. . . . I\u2019ve made it back because I learned to lean on myself--and because I learned to like myself.\u201d\n\nHis text, Aldridge said, was from St. Paul\u2019s letters to the Philippians. Reciting a lengthy verse from memory, he said: \u201cWhatsoever things are true, . . . honest . . . just . . . pure . . . lovely . . . think on these things.\u201d\n\nThink on the beautiful, he said, not the untrue.\n\n\u201cOne way to be a winner is to be honest,\u201d Aldridge continued, speaking softly. \u201cHonesty never loses.\n\n\u201cI had a setback, but I never had a drug problem. I gave up for a while, but there was a doctor who believed in me. Now I\u2019m putting it together again--at a pace I\u2019m comfortable with.\u201d\n\nThough Aldridge changes the lyrics each time, the music is always the same. And after this particular 23-minute speech, 18 or 20 listeners came up, as they always do, and crowded around, drawing Aldridge out on his themes of self-esteem and self-responsibility.\n\nAt 6 feet 4 inches and 300 pounds, he was the biggest man in the room, and one of the neatest in slacks and a long-sleeved white shirt. The tie was blue, the jacket light blue, the expression pleasant and dignified. At 46, Aldridge has the bearing and baritone voice of a cultured talk-show host.\n\nHe\u2019s also a working man, though. Looking at his watch, he smiled and said goodby.\n\nDriving back to the post office in his red Pontiac Firebird--\u201dIt fit me till last January, when I quit smoking and gained 50 pounds\u201d--Aldridge said:\n\n\u201cThere is no known cure for paranoid schizophrenia, but I am one of the lucky ones. The disease is in remission. I have largely recovered.\n\n\u201cI have been given some time--and I\u2019m going to use it to help others. And to help reduce the stigma of mental illness. And to encourage the commitment of more money and resources to (mental illness) research.\u201d\n\nWhat about his personal commitments?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a girlfriend right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI go out once in a while--but to manage a steady would take more time than I have to give.\n\n\u201cMy ex-wife . . . none of this is her fault. She\u2019s about to be remarried . . .\n\n\u201cI see my children now and then. The younger one is a soccer player in (a Milwaukee) high school. The older one is a freshman at (the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee). I love them dearly . . . \u201c\n\nThe subject was painful, and he changed it.\n\n\u201cI feel that I must give as much of me as I can to the post office, to WTMJ, and to the speeches (before youth groups and at mental-illness meetings).\u201d\n\nWTMJ is Milwaukee\u2019s big radio-TV complex. Aldridge worked there before the nightmare and the station has welcomed him home as its Saturday morning sports announcer.\n\nIn addition, after Packer games, he doubles as analyst and talk-show host on still another WTMJ program.\n\nDuring the week, he\u2019s on full time at the post office, where, as an executive in technical sales, he helps the government fight its many private-sector competitors for the nation\u2019s mail and parcel business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun, but it\u2019s a full schedule,\u201d he said.\n\nAt times it even gets hectic.\n\n\u201cThis year we\u2019ve called on Lionel to make all of our television commercials,\u201d said Mike Mahnke, the post office\u2019s division communications manager. \u201cHe does a first-rate job, too.\u201d\n\nAt his desk in a large sales room, Aldridge seems as fond of his co-workers as they are of him.\n\nOnce a week, he said, he is \u201cvisited by the support people from the hospital. . . . And the doctor sees me twice a month.\u201d\n\nPsychiatrists disagree on what causes Aldridge\u2019s kind of mental illness. They say it may stem either from heredity or environment, according to Dr. Charles William Wahl, clinical professor of psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cSome think a predisposition . . . is in the (genes),\u201d Wahl said. \u201cOthers, like myself, feel it\u2019s a reaction to the traumas of early life. It may be partly both.\n\n\u201cStress is usually a factor. Stress . . . can make or break you. As Nietzsche said, \u2018Those things that do not kill me make me stronger.\u2019\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of variation in the prognosis, and there are no guarantees, but a cooperative and motivated patient has a better (chance).\u201d\n\nCooperative, motivated. And helpful, sincere, caring. Unselfish. Glad to be alive. As he looks into the blank face of the future, Aldridge, now, is all of those.\n\nA LIFE OF TENSION AND TURMOIL\n\nAn orphan figuratively if not literally, an only child, he grew up in other people\u2019s homes, the homes of relatives who had big families of their own. Then for nine years in pro football, he came under the influence of a dominating, uncompromising individual, the Lombardi of the legends. Indeed, Lionel Aldridge has known stress.\n\nThe Louisiana Years: The world began for Aldridge in the disheartening, steaming fields of the rural South. Born in Evergreen, La., he was the baby in the home of his grandfather, Aaron Compton, a sharecropper.\n\nOne of the Compton daughters, Bessie Blackman, Aldridge\u2019s aunt, said: \u201cLionel was born in our house one night. There were 10 (children) in our family, 8 girls and 2 boys--and Lionel made 11.\u201d\n\nEveryone shared equally, as Aldridge tells it. \u201cBut I was on edge all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were good to me. There was a lot of love there. But I walked a tightrope every day.\u201d\n\nEarly on, his mother left town, following his father to the Midwest.\n\n\u201cLionel was lucky in his grandmother,\u201d Blackman said. \u201cShe even made his pants, and that isn\u2019t easy. She would sew all night so we\u2019d have a dress to wear in the morning. Then she\u2019d go out and work all day in the fields.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d wake up to the smell of beans cooking at 4 o\u2019clock in the morning. She was always up and making sure we\u2019d have something to eat for breakfast.\u201d\n\nLionel hated field work. His one big interest was school. He made good grades and, as a sixth-grader, he decided that he would go to college some day. He can\u2019t remember who influenced him. In Louisiana, though, he never missed an hour of school until the afternoon that disaster struck.\n\n\u201cLionel had been out playing in the rain,\u201d said Norma Lawson, another aunt. \u201cHe came in and said in a shaky voice, \u2018Papa, a snake bit me.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a phone or a car in those days, so his grandfather ran all the way to town to get the doctor. The leg was so swollen by the time they got back that Lionel barely survived. He couldn\u2019t walk for weeks.\u201d\n\nHe cried much of the time.\n\n\u201cThere were rumors that I\u2019d died,\u201d Aldridge remembers.\n\nLawson said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t dying that worried him. The thing that made him cry was missing school.\u201d\n\nThen real trouble hit. When he was 15, his grandfather died, and Lionel was bundled off again, this time to far away Pittsburg, Calif., near San Francisco, to live with his Aunt Bessie, who had moved from the South.\n\nThe Pittsburg Years: On his second morning in California, despondency drove Aldridge back to bed.\n\n\u201cI finally got it out of him,\u201d Blackman said. \u201cHe felt bad because he didn\u2019t know how to comb the children\u2019s hair. He wanted to help me, but couldn\u2019t. . . . We loved him, but he thought he was imposing on us.\u201d\n\nAnd in a sense, of course, he was. The Blackmans, Bessie and Benjamin, had six children of their own. \u201cI saw them all off to college,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery one.\u201d\n\nShe and her husband also raised 8 other children, or 14 in all, most at the same time.\n\n\u201cTwo of my sisters came to live with us, then two nephews, three nieces, and Lionel,\u201d she said. \u201cThey slept all over the house. We started with three bedrooms and had to add two more, and close in the patio.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Blackman, a retired millwright at U.S. Steel, remembers that Lionel had been in the Pittsburg household only a few days when he came around and asked to be sent back to Louisiana.\n\n\u201cHe thought I had too many children already,\u201d his Uncle Benjamin said. \u201cI knew he didn\u2019t want to go. There was no place for him to go. So I told him I wouldn\u2019t send him.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I can\u2019t give you much, but I\u2019ll give you what my family have.\u2019\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018I only have three rules here. First, go to school. Second, pick out nice friends--nobody carries a big knife around me. And third, don\u2019t ask for my car.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAldridge never felt really comfortable in Pittsburg. For one thing, everybody expected him to go out for the high school football team because he was the biggest kid in town.\n\nTrouble was, he\u2019d never played football. In his first 16 years, he\u2019d hardly even seen a football, let alone a game.\n\n\u201cSo I taught him,\u201d his Uncle Benjamin said. \u201cI\u2019d never played football myself, either, but I\u2019d watched it on the TV. I took him out back and taught him.\u201d\n\nAlmost every night after that, after school, Lionel came home from football practice with his stomach hurting. Once or twice, the pain was so intense that he couldn\u2019t sleep.\n\n\u201cI decided to drive by and see what the hell kind of a football team that was,\u201d Blackman said. \u201cAnd there was Lionel, the biggest guy on the team, running around blocking everybody with his stomach.\n\n\u201cSo I had to give him one more lesson,\u201d Blackman said.\n\nWithin a week, Aldridge was the team\u2019s best player.\n\nThe College Years: If he could go back and do it again, Aldridge would doubtless choose a different school. In the early \u201860s, he wasn\u2019t ready for mostly white Utah State, which was in mostly Mormon, mostly white, Logan, Utah.\n\nHis high school coach, however, had taken a job there and immediately arranged a scholarship for Aldridge. And there he was, a curiosity symbol in a radically different culture.\n\n\u201cKids saw me coming, they\u2019d say, \u2018Here comes the chocolate man,\u2019 \u201d Aldridge remembers.\n\nMore tension. And still more to come.\n\nHank Stoddard, sports director at WTMJ, one of Wisconsin\u2019s most prominent radio personalities and one of Aldridge\u2019s steadfast friends in Milwaukee, has tried to put himself in Aldridge\u2019s shoes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 1960,\u201d Stoddard said. \u201cWho do you date at Utah State? How many colors are there?\u201d\n\nAldridge first saw her in a sociology class, the sunny, young, white Mormon woman who was to become his wife.\n\n\u201cOur relationship put us under a lot of pressure,\u201d Vicky Aldridge told Milwaukee magazine later, describing the turmoil at Utah State, and the reaction of her parents, who at first refused to speak with her.\n\n\u201cMy father was very religious, and the dean of the school was a personal friend of my father\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cHe used to call us into his office and threaten to kick us out of school if we didn\u2019t break (up).\u201d\n\nStoddard gives Lombardi the credit for making life bearable for Lionel and Vicky in Green Bay, where blacks are few, even today, and inter-racial couples were practically unheard of in the \u201860s.\n\n\u201cLombardi told them, \u2018I\u2019m with you guys,\u2019 \u201d Stoddard recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018If anybody gives you a hard time, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNonetheless, according to Vicky Aldridge, the NFL tried to block their wedding. That was after Lionel was drafted by the Packers but before they\u2019d taken their case to Lombardi.\n\n\u201cThe NFL commissioner, Pete Rozelle, didn\u2019t want us to get married because he feared an adverse reaction in the press,\u201d she told Milwaukee magazine. \u201cHe even flew to Green Bay to try to talk us out of it.\u201d\n\nNobody could talk them out of it. \u201cNothing could break them up,\u201d Stoddard said.\n\nThe Lombardi Years: In 1963, for a fourth-round draft choice with a white wife, life wasn\u2019t a bowl of cherries in Green Bay. It would have been tough enough for a fourth-round bachelor. The Packers were by then a veteran championship team. Lombardi had already coached them to two of the five NFL titles they won in that decade.\n\nWhat saved Aldridge was his talent. As a defensive player, he proved to be one of the best of his era, one of the most valuable of the champion Packers.\n\n\u201cWillie Davis was flashier,\u201d said Dan Devine, who coached the Packers later. \u201cNobody was steadier than Lionel Aldridge.\u201d\n\nEvery down was like the Super Bowl to Aldridge, teammates said. There was a day in Los Angeles, for instance, when he kept coming in the final minutes of a game that the Packers were losing by a runaway score.\n\nIt was third and two, and as Ram running back Willie Ellison started around end--on the hottest afternoon of the year in the Coliseum--Aldridge went after him. Most of the other Packers had plainly quit for the day, and even Aldridge was running out of gas, but he kept chasing Ellison until he caught him at the sideline after a gain of less than a yard.\n\n\u201cConsidering the circumstances, that was one of the 10 greatest plays I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Devine said afterward.\n\nStill, it\u2019s in the record that as a rookie, Aldridge had come to Green Bay as the youngest of the Packers. And he had brought his gentle nature with him. Some say that he might have been too young and too gentle for that tough, veteran team.\n\nOn rookie night at his first training camp, he was obviously uncomfortable as most of the new players clowned around and sang comical, off-key versions of their school songs.\n\nWhen the veterans called on Aldridge, he stood stiffly, hands at his sides, eyes straight ahead, and gave a serious rendition of a Utah State song in an all but inaudible voice.\n\nWillie Davis, recalling that night, said: \u201cI asked myself, what\u2019s a serious one like this guy doing here?\u201d\n\nThe team found out a week later, when Lombardi made it clear that there was a place for either Aldridge or a Packer veteran, Urban Henry. Not both. That upset Henry\u2019s buddies.\n\n\u201cAlmost everybody resented me except Lombardi,\u201d Aldridge said. \u201cAnd Lombardi overpowered me. Just walking into a room, he scared me.\u201d\n\nAldridge learned that he, and not Henry, had made the team when he read it in the paper.\n\nDoubting whether to believe it, he was walking into the Packer dormitory that night, eyes lowered, when he felt a tap on the shoulder.\n\nTurning, he looked squarely into the face of Lombardi, who told him: \u201cNobody ever came up here and made the club the way you did.\u201d\n\nSpeechless at the time, Aldridge said later: \u201cAt that moment, I needed that. And (Lombardi) knew it. He knew exactly how to manipulate his players--his success wasn\u2019t an accident. But he was scary to play for.\u201d\n\nIN THE GRIP OF A CRUEL DISEASE\n\nSchizophrenia: \u201cA major mental disorder of unknown cause typically characterized by . . . a distortion of reality accompanied by delusions, hallucinations (and) bizarre behavior, etc., often with no loss of basic intellectual functions.\u201d --Webster\u2019s New World dictionary\n\nIn the days when Aldridge was still on the farm and going to grade school in Louisiana, a teacher asked him a question one day in class.\n\nReplying politely, he said: \u201cI ain\u2019t sittin\u2019 on nan part of the chair.\u201d\n\nThe other kids all laughed, and Aldridge squirmed. \u201cIt was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life,\u201d he said later.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t realized that my grandfather had his own language. I thought everybody talked that way.\u201d\n\nAldridge vowed then to learn proper English. \u201cI made it my first priority,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough, of course, I didn\u2019t know what a priority was in those days.\u201d\n\nHe does now. And he has become the good speaker he wanted to be.\n\n\u201cLionel is known for that God-given voice,\u201d said Shirley Leonard, a Packer spokeswoman.\n\nDan Devine said: \u201cOne thing everybody notices about Lionel is that he\u2019s as well-spoken as he is soft-spoken.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he is obviously a professional, a natural, on either radio or TV. As a commentator, Aldridge comes right to the point, and when he does, he has something to say.\n\n\u201cLionel is one of the top football analysts,\u201d Stoddard said. \u201cHe has a knack for it. Getting a chance (as a commentator) is his problem.\u201d\n\nIt is now. It wasn\u2019t before mental illness struck him down. One day he was a rising professional, appearing on network television. The next he was out on the streets, hallucinating, behaving strangely. Considering the kind of ability he had shown in the communications field, he could hardly have been attacked by a more disastrous disease.\n\nThat is the nature of paranoid schizophrenia. Most serious illnesses are dreadful. This one torments in a particularly cruel way.\n\n\u201cWhen you feel perfect, when you feel as good as you can feel, that\u2019s when you\u2019re getting into trouble,\u201d Aldridge said. \u201cFor a (schizophrenic), happiness is the dawn of real trouble.\u201d\n\nFeeling well often leads the patient to abandon therapy. \u201cYou feel so good that you know you don\u2019t need any more medication,\u201d Aldridge recalls sadly.\n\nAt UCLA, Dr. Wahl said that treatment consists of talk therapy as well as medication.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand your past if you are to change it,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019re just covering up the problem (with medicine). Of course, medication is (essential).\u201d\n\nAldridge is one of the many who can attest to that. For he was on and off medication several times--and had been burned every time he got off it--before he bowed to his illness.\n\n\u201cToday, any time I start to feel I\u2019ve got it together, I throttle it down,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to learn a whole new ballgame. When I was on the bum, I felt great.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/lionel.aldridge/2162636", "page_content": "Lionel Aldridge\n\ngridiron football player\n\nFebruary 14, 1941 (age 56)\n\nHe earned an athletic scholarship and played college football at Utah State University in Logan, and was a co-captain of the team and an All-Skyline Conference tackle.

At least once, he picked it up and slammed it against the sidewalk. The dog was injured but not killed. Aldridge had missed his 5:15 and 6:15 radio shows.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I did that,\u201d Aldridge recalled, \u201cit was something I thought I needed to do, because I was listening to voices.\u201d\n\nAldridge knew he was in trouble, but he left the hospital after a week and returned to work. Things went badly. He took many leaves from WTMJ and had many relapses.\n\nAs a player, he never drank or used drugs of any kind, but now he was hearing voices unheard by others, and the best way to drown them out was to drug them into silence.\n\nOn a fall weekend in 1978 the Packers were in San Diego for a game against the Chargers.\n\nThe night before the game, well past midnight, Milwaukee Journal writer Dave Begel was startled by a thunderous banging on his door. \u201cI opened it,\u201d said Begel, \u201cand there was Lionel, holding a bottle of Scotch and a handful of pills.\n\nHe walked through the room, out to the balcony, and sat there drinking and taking pills.\n\n\u201cWhen he said anything, it was just gibberish, like some foreign language. He wasn\u2019t talking to me. Then he came in and sat on the bed and watched TV. I sat there and waited and waited.\n\n\u201cThe sun was coming up when he got up and said, \u2018I\u2019m going now,\u2019 and left. I saw him an hour before game time and he was okay and did his job. But he was obviously very disturbed.\u201d\n\nAldridge hung on to his job for a while, but by 1981 he was down and out, having plummeted from the heights of the Super Bowl to the depths of the gutter.\n\nOne night on a nondescript city street, he carefully removed his three-diamond Super Bowl ring, put it in his pocket and went to sleep. The ring was the most valuable possession he owned. In the morning it was gone.\n\nHe checked himself in and out of hospitals. A suicide attempt failed. He hitch-hiked across the country, looking for work and sometimes finding it.\n\nThere was a counseling job at a Utah prison; he couldn\u2019t handle it. Arriving after the football season started at his Alma Mater Utah State, he was given a job as an assistant coach.\n\nIt lasted only until the season ended. He continued to drift, doing odd jobs when they came his way.\n\nHis wife had divorced him and taken the children to California. That was all right with him. He wanted some distance between them and him as long as he was in this condition. He did not know how long that would be."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/lionel-aldridge", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nLionel Aldridge was born on 14 February, 1941 in Evergreen, Louisiana, USA, is an Actor.

Harding became President. Previously a U.S. Senator, Lieutenant Governor, and Ohio State Senator, Harding was a popular President. But many scandals plagued his short administration (he died in office after 2 and a half years), including the revelations of one of his mistresses and the Teapot Dome scandal. Historically, Harding is rated as one of the worst Presidents.\n\nIn 1942, at the age of 21 years old, Azelle was alive when on November 28th at 10:15p, a nightclub in Boston, the Cocoanut Grove, caught fire. The origins of the fire are unknown but it killed 492 people - the deadliest nightclub fire in U.S. history. Hundreds more were injured. The disaster was so shocking that it replaced World War II in the headlines and lead to reforms in safety standards and codes.\n\nIn 1974, at the age of 53 years old, Azelle was alive when on July 30th, the House Judiciary Committee adopted three articles of impeachment against President Nixon. He was charged with obstruction of justice, failure to uphold laws, and the refusal to produce material subpoenaed by the committee. In order to avoid impeachment, Richard M. Nixon announced that he would resign on August 8th, the first President to do so.\n\nIn 1982, this person was 61 years old when on September 14th, Princess Grace of Monaco (American actress Grace Kelly), 52, died of injuries when her car plunged off a mountain road. Her 17 year old daughter, Stephanie, was also in the car and suffered serious injuries but recovered. It's believed that the accident was caused when Princess Grace, who was driving, had a mild stroke.\n\nIn 1996, at the age of 75 years old, Azelle was alive when on April 3rd, Theodore Kaczynski (nicknamed the Unabomber) was arrested. His mailed or hand-delivered bombs, sent between 1978 and 1995, killed three people and injured 23 others. Diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, Kaczynski is serving 8 life sentences without the possibility of parole."}, {"url": "https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AldrLi20.htm", "page_content": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen was Lionel Aldridge born?\n\nLionel Aldridge was born on February 14, 1941.\n\nWhere was Lionel Aldridge born?\n\nLionel Aldridge was born in Evergreen, LA.\n\nHow tall was Lionel Aldridge?\n\nLionel Aldridge was 6-3 (190 cm) tall.\n\nHow much did Lionel Aldridge weigh when playing?\n\nLionel Aldridge weighed 254 lbs (115 kg) when playing.\n\nIs Lionel Aldridge in the Hall of Fame?\n\nLionel Aldridge has not been elected into the Hall of Fame.\n\nHow many games did Lionel Aldridge play?\n\nLionel Aldridge played 147 games over his career.\n\nHow many sacks did Lionel Aldridge have?\n\nLionel Aldridge had 69.5 sacks over his career.\n\nHow many Super Bowls has Lionel Aldridge won?\n\nLionel Aldridge won 2 Super Bowls.\n\nWhen did Lionel Aldridge retire?\n\nLionel Aldridge last played in 1973."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/194808585/lance-channing-aldridge", "page_content": "There is a problem with your email/password.\n\nWe\u2019ve updated the security on the site.

During Lombardi's nine years as coach of the Packers, Lionel Aldridge was the only rookie to start a season opener.\n\nAlthough Aldridge might have been more steady than spectacular over the course of his career, Lombardi's early faith in him was a tribute in itself. In fact, Aldridge started the first 45 games of his career under Lombardi before missing the fourth game of the 1966 season with an ankle injury.\n\nAfter the Packers won a second consecutive NFL championship in 1962, Lombardi traded veteran Bill Quinlan and created an opening at right defensive end with no obvious heir apparent. Veteran free agent Urban Henry, who wasn't re-signed by the Los Angeles Rams after missing the 1962 season with a neck injury, and No. 1 draft pick Dave Robinson were considered the frontrunners heading into camp. However, the Packers decided to play Robinson at linebacker when he reported late following the College All-Star Game and Aldridge beat out Henry.\n\nAldridge came into his own when the Packers won an unprecedented three straight NFL championships under the league's playoff format from 1965 to 1967. He started all eight postseason games during that stretch and then continued to hold forth at right end until midway through the 1971 season.\n\nOver his eight-and-a-half years as an established starter, Aldridge missed only three games, a notable achievement when you consider he broke his leg once and had some ankle issues. The worst of his injuries occurred in a mid-August preseason game in 1967 when Aldridge broke a bone in his lower left leg. He missed only the first two regular-season games, didn't start but appeared in the third, and then played roughly three-quarters of the game in a hard-fought victory over Detroit in Week 4. Lombardi, who had little compassion for injured players and rarely saluted them when they played hurt, heaped praise on Aldridge after the game. \"Aldridge deserves a lot of credit for the way he came back so fast from his injury,\" Lombardi said."}, {"url": "https://www.packersnews.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2017/09/15/lionel-aldridge/541006001/", "page_content": "Chad Burkholder\n\nFAST FACTS\n\n\u00bb Fourth-round draft choice out of Utah State in 1963\n\n\u00bb Was the only Packers player under coach Vince Lombardi to become a starter in his rookie season\n\n\u00bb Played in 123 regular-season games and was a standout defensive end for teams that won three straight NFL titles and two Super Bowls\n\n\u00bb Entered sports broadcasting after his playing career ended in 1973 and called some Packers game in 1975\n\nInterested in building the ultimate team of Packers Hall of Famers?

Homeless for a time in part due to misdiagnosis, he eventually reached a form of equilibrium. He became an advocate for the homeless and the mentally ill until his death in 1998.

Aldridge was well on his way to becoming a bum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith a business school background at the University of Chicago--pursued during his Packer off-seasons--Davis had become, as he continues to be, one of the most successful beer distributors and radio entrepreneurs in the West.\n\nA former sociology major at Utah State, Aldridge launched an equally impressive career in radio broadcasting and network TV--in the midst of which he was abruptly knocked down, and almost out, by mental illness.\n\nAldridge is a paranoid schizophrenic. But at first, his doctors diagnosed the wrong illness and treated him with the wrong medicine. Within months, he was into the wretched life of a vagrant.\n\nIn the flop houses and rescue missions of America, Aldridge\u2019s nightmare lasted for a ghastly decade, costing him his wife and family, his jobs in radio and television, other jobs, most of his friends, his money, and eventually his self-respect.\n\nIf the people who once knew him best thought of him at all in those days, they thought, very wrongly, that Aldridge was a classic manic depressive--on the loose.\n\nWillie Davis, who runs his many businesses from an office in South-Central Los Angeles, only heard about the nightmare when Aldridge called one day after hitch-hiking into Skid Row downtown, where he touched up his old buddy for $3. Davis gave him $300 and got him a hotel room, from which Aldridge promptly dropped from sight.\n\nThen two years ago, Aldridge telephoned again, this time from Milwaukee. The nightmare was over. He was taking the right medication, Aldridge said. And he was working again, as an account representative at the Milwaukee post office and part-time in radio.\n\nHe was also in a cheerful, new eighth-floor apartment overlooking Lake Michigan on the city\u2019s fashionable East Side.\n\n\u201cLionel had come back from the gates of hell,\u201d Davis said the other day, recalling that phone call in 1985. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a conversation with anyone that affected me that much.\n\n\u201cFor weeks afterward, I would catch myself whistling or humming to myself, and I\u2019d ask, \u2018Why the hell am I feeling so good?\u2019 Then I\u2019d remember: Lionel is back.\u201d\n\nOne day last month at a community college in Milwaukee, Aldridge spent his noon hour away from the post office--as he so often does--on a speaking engagement.\n\nTalking to a roomful of students at Milwaukee Area Technical College, he said:\n\n\u201cI could be mad at somebody because I got sick. It was society that allowed me to become a bum and pull cigarette butts off the streets and out of ash trays.\n\n\u201cAnd I could be angry at God for giving me this disease.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve made a decision not to be bitter. I have done it for one reason. I didn\u2019t get well until I quit blaming God and society--and took the responsibility for myself myself.\n\n\u201cHere I am, a black man, (lecturing) white college students, but I feel very deeply about this. You--all of you--are responsible for you. Nobody is going to ride up and rescue you. . . . I know. . . . I\u2019ve made it back because I learned to lean on myself--and because I learned to like myself.\u201d\n\nHis text, Aldridge said, was from St. Paul\u2019s letters to the Philippians. Reciting a lengthy verse from memory, he said: \u201cWhatsoever things are true, . . . honest . . . just . . . pure . . . lovely . . . think on these things.\u201d\n\nThink on the beautiful, he said, not the untrue.\n\n\u201cOne way to be a winner is to be honest,\u201d Aldridge continued, speaking softly. \u201cHonesty never loses.\n\n\u201cI had a setback, but I never had a drug problem. I gave up for a while, but there was a doctor who believed in me. Now I\u2019m putting it together again--at a pace I\u2019m comfortable with.\u201d\n\nThough Aldridge changes the lyrics each time, the music is always the same. And after this particular 23-minute speech, 18 or 20 listeners came up, as they always do, and crowded around, drawing Aldridge out on his themes of self-esteem and self-responsibility.\n\nAt 6 feet 4 inches and 300 pounds, he was the biggest man in the room, and one of the neatest in slacks and a long-sleeved white shirt. The tie was blue, the jacket light blue, the expression pleasant and dignified. At 46, Aldridge has the bearing and baritone voice of a cultured talk-show host.\n\nHe\u2019s also a working man, though. Looking at his watch, he smiled and said goodby.\n\nDriving back to the post office in his red Pontiac Firebird--\u201dIt fit me till last January, when I quit smoking and gained 50 pounds\u201d--Aldridge said:\n\n\u201cThere is no known cure for paranoid schizophrenia, but I am one of the lucky ones. The disease is in remission. I have largely recovered.\n\n\u201cI have been given some time--and I\u2019m going to use it to help others. And to help reduce the stigma of mental illness. And to encourage the commitment of more money and resources to (mental illness) research.\u201d\n\nWhat about his personal commitments?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a girlfriend right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI go out once in a while--but to manage a steady would take more time than I have to give.\n\n\u201cMy ex-wife . . . none of this is her fault. She\u2019s about to be remarried . . .\n\n\u201cI see my children now and then. The younger one is a soccer player in (a Milwaukee) high school. The older one is a freshman at (the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee). I love them dearly . . . \u201c\n\nThe subject was painful, and he changed it.\n\n\u201cI feel that I must give as much of me as I can to the post office, to WTMJ, and to the speeches (before youth groups and at mental-illness meetings).\u201d\n\nWTMJ is Milwaukee\u2019s big radio-TV complex. Aldridge worked there before the nightmare and the station has welcomed him home as its Saturday morning sports announcer.\n\nIn addition, after Packer games, he doubles as analyst and talk-show host on still another WTMJ program.\n\nDuring the week, he\u2019s on full time at the post office, where, as an executive in technical sales, he helps the government fight its many private-sector competitors for the nation\u2019s mail and parcel business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun, but it\u2019s a full schedule,\u201d he said.\n\nAt times it even gets hectic.\n\n\u201cThis year we\u2019ve called on Lionel to make all of our television commercials,\u201d said Mike Mahnke, the post office\u2019s division communications manager. \u201cHe does a first-rate job, too.\u201d\n\nAt his desk in a large sales room, Aldridge seems as fond of his co-workers as they are of him.\n\nOnce a week, he said, he is \u201cvisited by the support people from the hospital. . . . And the doctor sees me twice a month.\u201d\n\nPsychiatrists disagree on what causes Aldridge\u2019s kind of mental illness. They say it may stem either from heredity or environment, according to Dr. Charles William Wahl, clinical professor of psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cSome think a predisposition . . . is in the (genes),\u201d Wahl said. \u201cOthers, like myself, feel it\u2019s a reaction to the traumas of early life. It may be partly both.\n\n\u201cStress is usually a factor. Stress . . . can make or break you. As Nietzsche said, \u2018Those things that do not kill me make me stronger.\u2019\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of variation in the prognosis, and there are no guarantees, but a cooperative and motivated patient has a better (chance).\u201d\n\nCooperative, motivated. And helpful, sincere, caring. Unselfish. Glad to be alive. As he looks into the blank face of the future, Aldridge, now, is all of those.\n\nA LIFE OF TENSION AND TURMOIL\n\nAn orphan figuratively if not literally, an only child, he grew up in other people\u2019s homes, the homes of relatives who had big families of their own. Then for nine years in pro football, he came under the influence of a dominating, uncompromising individual, the Lombardi of the legends. Indeed, Lionel Aldridge has known stress.\n\nThe Louisiana Years: The world began for Aldridge in the disheartening, steaming fields of the rural South. Born in Evergreen, La., he was the baby in the home of his grandfather, Aaron Compton, a sharecropper.\n\nOne of the Compton daughters, Bessie Blackman, Aldridge\u2019s aunt, said: \u201cLionel was born in our house one night. There were 10 (children) in our family, 8 girls and 2 boys--and Lionel made 11.\u201d\n\nEveryone shared equally, as Aldridge tells it. \u201cBut I was on edge all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were good to me. There was a lot of love there. But I walked a tightrope every day.\u201d\n\nEarly on, his mother left town, following his father to the Midwest.\n\n\u201cLionel was lucky in his grandmother,\u201d Blackman said. \u201cShe even made his pants, and that isn\u2019t easy. She would sew all night so we\u2019d have a dress to wear in the morning. Then she\u2019d go out and work all day in the fields.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d wake up to the smell of beans cooking at 4 o\u2019clock in the morning. She was always up and making sure we\u2019d have something to eat for breakfast.\u201d\n\nLionel hated field work. His one big interest was school. He made good grades and, as a sixth-grader, he decided that he would go to college some day. He can\u2019t remember who influenced him. In Louisiana, though, he never missed an hour of school until the afternoon that disaster struck.\n\n\u201cLionel had been out playing in the rain,\u201d said Norma Lawson, another aunt. \u201cHe came in and said in a shaky voice, \u2018Papa, a snake bit me.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a phone or a car in those days, so his grandfather ran all the way to town to get the doctor. The leg was so swollen by the time they got back that Lionel barely survived. He couldn\u2019t walk for weeks.\u201d\n\nHe cried much of the time.\n\n\u201cThere were rumors that I\u2019d died,\u201d Aldridge remembers.\n\nLawson said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t dying that worried him. The thing that made him cry was missing school.\u201d\n\nThen real trouble hit. When he was 15, his grandfather died, and Lionel was bundled off again, this time to far away Pittsburg, Calif., near San Francisco, to live with his Aunt Bessie, who had moved from the South.\n\nThe Pittsburg Years: On his second morning in California, despondency drove Aldridge back to bed.\n\n\u201cI finally got it out of him,\u201d Blackman said. \u201cHe felt bad because he didn\u2019t know how to comb the children\u2019s hair. He wanted to help me, but couldn\u2019t. . . . We loved him, but he thought he was imposing on us.\u201d\n\nAnd in a sense, of course, he was. The Blackmans, Bessie and Benjamin, had six children of their own. \u201cI saw them all off to college,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery one.\u201d\n\nShe and her husband also raised 8 other children, or 14 in all, most at the same time.\n\n\u201cTwo of my sisters came to live with us, then two nephews, three nieces, and Lionel,\u201d she said. \u201cThey slept all over the house. We started with three bedrooms and had to add two more, and close in the patio.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Blackman, a retired millwright at U.S. Steel, remembers that Lionel had been in the Pittsburg household only a few days when he came around and asked to be sent back to Louisiana.\n\n\u201cHe thought I had too many children already,\u201d his Uncle Benjamin said. \u201cI knew he didn\u2019t want to go. There was no place for him to go. So I told him I wouldn\u2019t send him.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I can\u2019t give you much, but I\u2019ll give you what my family have.\u2019\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018I only have three rules here. First, go to school. Second, pick out nice friends--nobody carries a big knife around me. And third, don\u2019t ask for my car.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAldridge never felt really comfortable in Pittsburg. For one thing, everybody expected him to go out for the high school football team because he was the biggest kid in town.\n\nTrouble was, he\u2019d never played football. In his first 16 years, he\u2019d hardly even seen a football, let alone a game.\n\n\u201cSo I taught him,\u201d his Uncle Benjamin said. \u201cI\u2019d never played football myself, either, but I\u2019d watched it on the TV. I took him out back and taught him.\u201d\n\nAlmost every night after that, after school, Lionel came home from football practice with his stomach hurting. Once or twice, the pain was so intense that he couldn\u2019t sleep.\n\n\u201cI decided to drive by and see what the hell kind of a football team that was,\u201d Blackman said. \u201cAnd there was Lionel, the biggest guy on the team, running around blocking everybody with his stomach.\n\n\u201cSo I had to give him one more lesson,\u201d Blackman said.\n\nWithin a week, Aldridge was the team\u2019s best player.\n\nThe College Years: If he could go back and do it again, Aldridge would doubtless choose a different school. In the early \u201860s, he wasn\u2019t ready for mostly white Utah State, which was in mostly Mormon, mostly white, Logan, Utah.\n\nHis high school coach, however, had taken a job there and immediately arranged a scholarship for Aldridge. And there he was, a curiosity symbol in a radically different culture.\n\n\u201cKids saw me coming, they\u2019d say, \u2018Here comes the chocolate man,\u2019 \u201d Aldridge remembers.\n\nMore tension. And still more to come.\n\nHank Stoddard, sports director at WTMJ, one of Wisconsin\u2019s most prominent radio personalities and one of Aldridge\u2019s steadfast friends in Milwaukee, has tried to put himself in Aldridge\u2019s shoes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 1960,\u201d Stoddard said. \u201cWho do you date at Utah State? How many colors are there?\u201d\n\nAldridge first saw her in a sociology class, the sunny, young, white Mormon woman who was to become his wife.\n\n\u201cOur relationship put us under a lot of pressure,\u201d Vicky Aldridge told Milwaukee magazine later, describing the turmoil at Utah State, and the reaction of her parents, who at first refused to speak with her.\n\n\u201cMy father was very religious, and the dean of the school was a personal friend of my father\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cHe used to call us into his office and threaten to kick us out of school if we didn\u2019t break (up).\u201d\n\nStoddard gives Lombardi the credit for making life bearable for Lionel and Vicky in Green Bay, where blacks are few, even today, and inter-racial couples were practically unheard of in the \u201860s.\n\n\u201cLombardi told them, \u2018I\u2019m with you guys,\u2019 \u201d Stoddard recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018If anybody gives you a hard time, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNonetheless, according to Vicky Aldridge, the NFL tried to block their wedding. That was after Lionel was drafted by the Packers but before they\u2019d taken their case to Lombardi.\n\n\u201cThe NFL commissioner, Pete Rozelle, didn\u2019t want us to get married because he feared an adverse reaction in the press,\u201d she told Milwaukee magazine. \u201cHe even flew to Green Bay to try to talk us out of it.\u201d\n\nNobody could talk them out of it. \u201cNothing could break them up,\u201d Stoddard said.\n\nThe Lombardi Years: In 1963, for a fourth-round draft choice with a white wife, life wasn\u2019t a bowl of cherries in Green Bay. It would have been tough enough for a fourth-round bachelor. The Packers were by then a veteran championship team. Lombardi had already coached them to two of the five NFL titles they won in that decade.\n\nWhat saved Aldridge was his talent. As a defensive player, he proved to be one of the best of his era, one of the most valuable of the champion Packers.\n\n\u201cWillie Davis was flashier,\u201d said Dan Devine, who coached the Packers later. \u201cNobody was steadier than Lionel Aldridge.\u201d\n\nEvery down was like the Super Bowl to Aldridge, teammates said. There was a day in Los Angeles, for instance, when he kept coming in the final minutes of a game that the Packers were losing by a runaway score.\n\nIt was third and two, and as Ram running back Willie Ellison started around end--on the hottest afternoon of the year in the Coliseum--Aldridge went after him. Most of the other Packers had plainly quit for the day, and even Aldridge was running out of gas, but he kept chasing Ellison until he caught him at the sideline after a gain of less than a yard.\n\n\u201cConsidering the circumstances, that was one of the 10 greatest plays I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Devine said afterward.\n\nStill, it\u2019s in the record that as a rookie, Aldridge had come to Green Bay as the youngest of the Packers. And he had brought his gentle nature with him. Some say that he might have been too young and too gentle for that tough, veteran team.\n\nOn rookie night at his first training camp, he was obviously uncomfortable as most of the new players clowned around and sang comical, off-key versions of their school songs.\n\nWhen the veterans called on Aldridge, he stood stiffly, hands at his sides, eyes straight ahead, and gave a serious rendition of a Utah State song in an all but inaudible voice.\n\nWillie Davis, recalling that night, said: \u201cI asked myself, what\u2019s a serious one like this guy doing here?\u201d\n\nThe team found out a week later, when Lombardi made it clear that there was a place for either Aldridge or a Packer veteran, Urban Henry. Not both. That upset Henry\u2019s buddies.\n\n\u201cAlmost everybody resented me except Lombardi,\u201d Aldridge said. \u201cAnd Lombardi overpowered me. Just walking into a room, he scared me.\u201d\n\nAldridge learned that he, and not Henry, had made the team when he read it in the paper.\n\nDoubting whether to believe it, he was walking into the Packer dormitory that night, eyes lowered, when he felt a tap on the shoulder.\n\nTurning, he looked squarely into the face of Lombardi, who told him: \u201cNobody ever came up here and made the club the way you did.\u201d\n\nSpeechless at the time, Aldridge said later: \u201cAt that moment, I needed that. And (Lombardi) knew it. He knew exactly how to manipulate his players--his success wasn\u2019t an accident. But he was scary to play for.\u201d\n\nIN THE GRIP OF A CRUEL DISEASE\n\nSchizophrenia: \u201cA major mental disorder of unknown cause typically characterized by . . . a distortion of reality accompanied by delusions, hallucinations (and) bizarre behavior, etc., often with no loss of basic intellectual functions.\u201d --Webster\u2019s New World dictionary\n\nIn the days when Aldridge was still on the farm and going to grade school in Louisiana, a teacher asked him a question one day in class.\n\nReplying politely, he said: \u201cI ain\u2019t sittin\u2019 on nan part of the chair.\u201d\n\nThe other kids all laughed, and Aldridge squirmed. \u201cIt was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life,\u201d he said later.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t realized that my grandfather had his own language. I thought everybody talked that way.\u201d\n\nAldridge vowed then to learn proper English. \u201cI made it my first priority,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough, of course, I didn\u2019t know what a priority was in those days.\u201d\n\nHe does now. And he has become the good speaker he wanted to be.\n\n\u201cLionel is known for that God-given voice,\u201d said Shirley Leonard, a Packer spokeswoman.\n\nDan Devine said: \u201cOne thing everybody notices about Lionel is that he\u2019s as well-spoken as he is soft-spoken.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he is obviously a professional, a natural, on either radio or TV. As a commentator, Aldridge comes right to the point, and when he does, he has something to say.\n\n\u201cLionel is one of the top football analysts,\u201d Stoddard said. \u201cHe has a knack for it. Getting a chance (as a commentator) is his problem.\u201d\n\nIt is now. It wasn\u2019t before mental illness struck him down. One day he was a rising professional, appearing on network television. The next he was out on the streets, hallucinating, behaving strangely. Considering the kind of ability he had shown in the communications field, he could hardly have been attacked by a more disastrous disease.\n\nThat is the nature of paranoid schizophrenia. Most serious illnesses are dreadful. This one torments in a particularly cruel way.\n\n\u201cWhen you feel perfect, when you feel as good as you can feel, that\u2019s when you\u2019re getting into trouble,\u201d Aldridge said. \u201cFor a (schizophrenic), happiness is the dawn of real trouble.\u201d\n\nFeeling well often leads the patient to abandon therapy. \u201cYou feel so good that you know you don\u2019t need any more medication,\u201d Aldridge recalls sadly.\n\nAt UCLA, Dr. Wahl said that treatment consists of talk therapy as well as medication.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand your past if you are to change it,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019re just covering up the problem (with medicine). Of course, medication is (essential).\u201d\n\nAldridge is one of the many who can attest to that. For he was on and off medication several times--and had been burned every time he got off it--before he bowed to his illness.\n\n\u201cToday, any time I start to feel I\u2019ve got it together, I throttle it down,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to learn a whole new ballgame. When I was on the bum, I felt great.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.deseret.com/2000/5/27/20776846/elder-h-aldridge-gillespie-biography", "page_content": "Family: Born May 22, 1935, in Riverside, Calif., to Lionel Aldridge and Amelia Eileen Baird Gillespie.

At least once, he picked it up and slammed it against the sidewalk. The dog was injured but not killed. Aldridge had missed his 5:15 and 6:15 radio shows.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I did that,\u201d Aldridge recalled, \u201cit was something I thought I needed to do, because I was listening to voices.\u201d\n\nAldridge knew he was in trouble, but he left the hospital after a week and returned to work. Things went badly. He took many leaves from WTMJ and had many relapses.\n\nAs a player, he never drank or used drugs of any kind, but now he was hearing voices unheard by others, and the best way to drown them out was to drug them into silence.\n\nOn a fall weekend in 1978 the Packers were in San Diego for a game against the Chargers.\n\nThe night before the game, well past midnight, Milwaukee Journal writer Dave Begel was startled by a thunderous banging on his door. \u201cI opened it,\u201d said Begel, \u201cand there was Lionel, holding a bottle of Scotch and a handful of pills.\n\nHe walked through the room, out to the balcony, and sat there drinking and taking pills.\n\n\u201cWhen he said anything, it was just gibberish, like some foreign language. He wasn\u2019t talking to me. Then he came in and sat on the bed and watched TV. I sat there and waited and waited.\n\n\u201cThe sun was coming up when he got up and said, \u2018I\u2019m going now,\u2019 and left. I saw him an hour before game time and he was okay and did his job. But he was obviously very disturbed.\u201d\n\nAldridge hung on to his job for a while, but by 1981 he was down and out, having plummeted from the heights of the Super Bowl to the depths of the gutter.\n\nOne night on a nondescript city street, he carefully removed his three-diamond Super Bowl ring, put it in his pocket and went to sleep. The ring was the most valuable possession he owned. In the morning it was gone.\n\nHe checked himself in and out of hospitals. A suicide attempt failed. He hitch-hiked across the country, looking for work and sometimes finding it.\n\nThere was a counseling job at a Utah prison; he couldn\u2019t handle it. Arriving after the football season started at his Alma Mater Utah State, he was given a job as an assistant coach.\n\nIt lasted only until the season ended. He continued to drift, doing odd jobs when they came his way.\n\nHis wife had divorced him and taken the children to California. That was all right with him. He wanted some distance between them and him as long as he was in this condition. He did not know how long that would be."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/38961586/lionel-aldridge", "page_content": "\n\nLionel Aldridge gained fame as a professional American football player for the Green Bay Packers in the 1960s.

Then mental illness and violence tore them apart. But their criss-crossing paths were far from over.\n\nUpstairs in her two-story house in Milwaukee\u2019s pleasant Story Hill neighborhood, Vicky Aldridge is sitting on her bed, and she is looking at an 1876 centennial collector\u2019s rifle.\n\nIt\u2019s pointed at her forehead, and she knows it\u2019s loaded, because she just watched the man holding it shove in the bullets.\n\nHe cocks it.\n\nAnd now, he has something to tell her.\n\nShe knows the baritone voice well. It belongs to Lionel Aldridge, her husband, and yet at this moment, not her husband at all. The Lionel she married was a funny charmer and brave protector, a man she so loved that she risked losing her family for him. He had played football for the Green Bay Packers, adjusting so well to Vince Lombardi\u2019s discipline that he started as a rookie. Lombardi had never started rookies.\n\nAldridge helped Green Bay win the first Super Bowl, then three days later, on Jan. 18, 1967, he married Vicky. And by saying yes, she undid the tightest of ties to her small-town Utah family, who couldn\u2019t comprehend their white daughter and sister being with a black man.\n\nBut Aldridge\u2019s talents went beyond football. During Packers downtime, he was a sports anchor on WTMJ, a man with such presence and promise that NBC put him on national broadcasts soon after his playing career ended. The charm that attracted Vicky also won viewers over. But TV screens revealed only so much, offering no clue Aldridge was tiptoeing on the edge of sanity, or that he was beating his wife.\n\nMinutes before Lionel levels that rifle at her head, Vicky is in the final stages of putting an end to those beatings. The plan is simple, if sketchy. She\u2019ll pack up some bags, then go pick up her two young daughters from school, and they\u2019ll head for the bus station. She\u2019ll select a route, and they\u2019ll go wherever her small amount of cash can get them. Not back home to her family in Utah. With the biracial children, she still can\u2019t go there. But somewhere.\n\nThe bags are on her bed and packed. All she needs to do is leave. But before she can, he arrives home. He sees what she\u2019s doing. He retrieves the rifle and loads it. He smashes its butt into the luggage and throws the crushed bags downstairs. He puts the rifle between her eyes and tells her, point-blank, \u201cIf you ever try to leave me, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that stopped me,\u201d Vicky says, now some 40 years removed from the peril. She gives a nervous chuckle. \u201cYeah, he could get very scary. And I\u2019m sure that was his mental illness coming more and more.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t know he\u2019d someday be diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Or that he\u2019d inadvertently solve her domestic violence problems by embarking on his own brain-addled cross-country sojourn, or that he was destined to join the ranks of the homeless. She didn\u2019t know of the comeback that awaited him, that his destructive illness would someday serve constructive purposes, that she and so many others would never stop loving a man born on Valentine\u2019s Day. She, who knew him so well, still didn\u2019t know so much about Lionel.\n\nNobody did.\n\nThe handsome black Utah State University football player, with the short hair and sparkling eyes, broad smile and broader shoulders, has been asking Vicky Wankier for a date. He often sees her while working his side job of cleaning a gym, because that\u2019s where Vicky practices with her Aggiettes dance squad. After a few rounds of hard-to-get, the lithe and lively girl with the long chestnut hair finally says yes.\n\nShe tells him to just come to her dormitory lobby, where they\u2019ll sit and have a good talk. He laughs into the phone. \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d She protests, wondering why not. \u201cJust trust me,\u201d he says.Yes, Lionel Aldridge, a wisened junior in the spring of 1962, knows straightaway what they are getting into. You could count the number of black men at Utah State on two hands, and they don\u2019t get to stay by making eyes at white women in their dorm lobbies. Vicky, just a freshman and still naive to racial realities, would get wise soon enough.\n\nBarely integrated though it was, Utah State was still the most multiracial experience Vicky had ever known. She was born in August 1943, and she grew up in Levan, the tiniest of central Utah towns. And of course, she was raised Mormon, just like everyone else in her hometown.\n\nHer family bonds \u2013 with father Farrell Wankier and mother Thela, older brother Farrell Jr. and older sister Norine \u2013 were country strong. And nine years the youngest child, she was every bit daddy\u2019s little girl, even into her teens. He had one glass eye and terrible peripheral vision, so when she drove him around town, Vicky had a job. She\u2019d name the person they were driving past and tell him which direction to wave. So in this way, the successful sheep farmer, shopkeeper and future Levan mayor could call out a personalized hello.\n\nWhen Vicky went to Utah State for a teaching degree, the Wankiers knew she\u2019d be in good hands. Farrell Sr. was old friends with Daryl Chase, the school\u2019s president. She\u2019d practically have family there.\n\nFor Aldridge, the closest thing to family in Utah was the Aggies\u2019 football team, because his actual family was scattered far and wide. Born in 1941 in Evergreen, La., he grew up fully immersed in the era\u2019s southern brand of racism. He was a grandson of sharecroppers and son of a father he never really knew. His mother also left when he was young, called to Detroit to care for family, leaving Lionel with his grandparents. She could never afford to return, and poor though they were, the grandparents gave him as good a life as they could. He helped in the fields, but wanted no part of such grueling work for a lifetime, so he poured himself into school, hell-bent on getting to college.\n\nWhich didn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t some rebel in him. His path to the school for black children took him past an all-white school, and black kids had to walk on the other side of the road. One afternoon on his way home, young Lionel sprinted across the street and slapped one of the white school\u2019s buses. He kept on sprinting, spurred on by an incensed mob of white children. But none were in sight when he arrived home, a hint of his budding athleticism.\n\nAnd yet, he never played organized sports in Louisiana. That didn\u2019t come until he was 15, when his grandfather\u2019s death prompted Lionel\u2019s move to live with an uncle and aunt in Pittsburg, Calif. It was a different world in the San Francisco suburb, and at Pittsburg High School, Lionel excelled at track, basketball and football. Then Pittsburg\u2019s football coach took a job at Utah State and convinced Lionel to follow.\n\nAldridge turned into a standout for the Aggies, but it still wasn\u2019t easy for a black man in Logan. The racial slurs he\u2019d grown up with in Louisiana and been distanced from in California became common again. And as his relationship with Vicky grew into an open secret, he got even more unwelcome attention.\n\nOne day, Chase called Vicky into his office, then called her father\u2019s phone number by memory. \u201cI think your daughter has something to tell you,\u201d the school president told Farrell, and handed the receiver to Vicky. \u201cHi Dad,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m dating Lionel Aldridge. He\u2019s black.\u201d\n\nFarrell\u2019s reply was succinct. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right there.\u201d Lionel was soon summoned, and the kids were told just how bad this relationship was for both of them. They agreed to end it, never truly intending to do so.\n\nChase tasked a dean with watching her closely, but she was too far down the path with Lionel to be swayed by protests from her family or anyone else. She didn\u2019t see what the big deal was with race, and couldn\u2019t understand why others didn\u2019t understand.\n\nVicky and Lionel were careful to do things under the radar and off campus. Lionel would borrow a friend\u2019s car, and they\u2019d drive to nearby Logan Canyon. In time, their love grew serious. For her devotion, she was called nigger-lover, and no sorority would have her. For his temerity, once his four years of football eligibility were up, so was his welcome at Utah State. School officials said it was grades. Vicky remains convinced it was their relationship, an example of how Lionel risked his career while she risked her family.\n\nSo he didn\u2019t graduate, and Vicky recalls that when Aldridge was invited to prestigious college all-star games like the East-West Shrine Game, Utah State wouldn\u2019t give him a helmet. He had to borrow one from his high school.\n\nNone of that dissuaded a certain bespectacled NFL coach from spending a fourth-round draft pick on him in 1963.\n\nLionel Aldridge is in Vince Lombardi\u2019s office, a place you generally don\u2019t want to be, an invitation impossible to decline. And although the 1966 season has been another good one for the 6-foot-4, 245-pound defensive end, he\u2019s not in here for a pat on the back.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers coach has heard through the grapevine that Aldridge is, with regularity, bringing a white woman into town. He wants an explanation. So Lionel begins to tell him about Vicky.\n\nThey\u2019d secretly gotten engaged back in 1963. At the end of Aldridge\u2019s rookie season, he flew Vicky to San Francisco for Green Bay\u2019s finale against the 49ers. He and teammate Dave Robinson had some people in their hotel room before the game, and Lionel pulled her into the bathroom. He produced a one-carat diamond ring. She\u2019d kept it hidden away for her last two years at Utah State. Not long after her graduation in 1965, they decided she should move to Milwaukee.\n\nVicky knew that, as far as her family was concerned, crossing the Mississippi River meant crossing the Rubicon. While she\u2019d held out hope her family would come around on Lionel, they were equally hopeful she\u2019d come to her senses and ditch him. But moving to Milwaukee ended her family\u2019s hopes and, for the most part, her close relationship with them. Years later, she\u2019d find out just how deep an impact this had back in Levan.\n\nSo, Aldridge explains to Lombardi, he\u2019s not just bringing some floozy up to Green Bay. This is the woman he\u2019s wanted to marry for years, only now, he\u2019s afraid to do so. Not because of what her family will think. Not even because of what his teammates will think. After all, Aldridge was the rookie who\u2019d heard a fellow Packer utter the word nigger, then threw him up against a wall and declared an end to that word in the locker room.\n\nNo, Aldridge is reluctant to marry Vicky because he knows what happened to Cookie Gilchrist. A black running back who drew comparisons to Jim Brown, Gilchrist was blackballed from the NFL because he married a white woman and relegated to the Canadian Football League. Aldridge doesn\u2019t want the same thing happening to him.\n\nLombardi\u2019s response, as related by Robinson, showcases the coach\u2019s famed combination of gruff compassion and equanimity. \u201cVince told him, \u2018Listen, I want you to marry her and make an honest woman out of her,\u2019\u201d Robinson recalls. \u201c\u2018You do what\u2019s right and let me worry about the rest of it.\u2019 Lionel said he couldn\u2019t wait to go home and tell Vicky.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t quite the end of it. At some point, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle came to town and told Lombardi the marriage would be bad for the league. Lombardi pretty much told Rozelle where to go. \u201cHe said, \u2018This is my team,\u2019\u201d Vicky recalls. \u201c\u2018You can\u2019t tell me how to run it.\u2019\u201d Were Aldridge on any other team, she believes, he couldn\u2019t have married her and stayed in the league. Only Lombardi could stand up to Rozelle.\n\nThey had the wedding at a little chapel in Las Vegas, not wanting to run afoul of any interracial marriage laws elsewhere. They stayed at the Tropicana and caught Bill Cosby\u2019s stand-up act. Three days earlier, Green Bay had won the inaugural Super Bowl, and Lionel\u2019s champion status earned him a measure of fame \u2013 and some primo seats.\n\nAt the table next to them were teammates from a different Pack \u2013 Rat Pack stars Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr. Lionel whispered to Vicky, wondering if he should ask for autographs. Seconds later, Lawford leaned over. \u201cCould I get your autograph?\u201d he asked Lionel.\n\nAldridge didn\u2019t hesitate to oblige, then whispered something else to Vicky. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m gonna ask for one now.\u201d\n\nDave Robinson and Lionel are about to fight. The Packers roomies are best of friends, with linebacker Robinson the perfect easy-going complement to Aldridge\u2019s moodiness. But the battle is imminent.\n\nLionel has arrived upset because Vicky\u2019s been slighted by another player\u2019s spouse. Although Vicky has a foot in with the black wives because of Lionel and another foot in with the white wives, she hasn\u2019t been fully accepted by either camp. Her latest issue has so angered Lionel that he\u2019s poised to confront the offending wife\u2019s husband. Robinson tries curtailing Aldridge\u2019s vendetta. Lionel tells him to mind his own business. Robinson presses further into it.\n\n\u201cYou are my business,\u201d Robinson says. He tells Aldridge the team can\u2019t risk losing him over some brouhaha that stems from their wives\u2019 spats. So, he\u2019s going to stop Lionel. \u201cIf we have to fight, we\u2019ll fight.\u201d Lionel takes a long look at Robinson. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d Aldridge says. They have a good laugh, and Aldridge admits Robinson\u2019s right.\n\nIf Lombardi\u2019s blessing unlocked the NFL\u2019s interracial marriage barrier, it wasn\u2019t a panacea for the Aldridges. The ramifications were felt not so much in the locker room, but up in the stands or during social gatherings, where Vicky often felt excluded from the cliques.\n\nThe wives had a tradition of rotating watch parties at their homes when the Packers were on the road. The first time Vicky\u2019s turn came, she laid out a fanciful spread, but when game time arrived, none of her guests did. She called around and heard various excuses \u2013 illness, busy, what have you \u2013 but the message was clear.\n\nAnother time, at a home game, Vicky went to her seat among some black wives, including Willie Davis\u2019 wife, Ann, and Elijah Pitts\u2019 wife, Ruth. Vicky found they\u2019d given it away. \u201cGo find a seat someplace else,\u201d Ann said. Some white wives, including Jim Grabowski\u2019s spouse, Kathy, overheard, and Kathy invited Vicky to sit with them. At this, Ann told Vicky they\u2019d make room for her. Vicky told her to F-off and sat next to Kathy, who would become a cherished friend and remembers Vicky being \u201cfriends with everybody she could be.\u201d\n\nIn time, Pitts would also grow close to Vicky. During the season, they lived in the same Green Bay apartment complex, one of the few local places that rented to blacks. She saw all that Vicky endured, and during a team party, the two were in the ladies\u2019 restroom.\n\n\u201cVicky,\u201d Pitts recalls saying, \u201cI am really sorry if us black girls have done anything to make you uncomfortable. I apologize for everybody.\u201d Tensions eased, and Vicky embraced her dearest friends because she had no family support. She kept calling Utah every Sunday, especially to speak with her father, but conversations were perfunctory.\n\nStill, Vicky could enjoy some perks that life as a Packers wife provided. There were the parties, meeting celebrities and sharing the love showered upon the players. This was, after all, a golden era in Green Bay. From 1965-67, the Packers were nothing but kings, winning the last NFL championship and the first two Super Bowls.\n\nMeanwhile, the Aldridge family was growing into their Story Hill home. On Dec. 28, 1967, daughter Angela was born in Milwaukee. Lionel drove down from Green Bay to see mother and baby, but he couldn\u2019t stay long. On Dec. 31, he had to play in the Ice Bowl.\n\nTwo weeks later, with Vicky and Angela still in Milwaukee, the Packers won Super Bowl II in Miami. Lionel called home saying some guys wanted to celebrate in the Bahamas, and he wondered if she\u2019d mind. She was breastfeeding when the call came, and stopped long enough for Lionel to hear Angela crying. \u201cDoes it sound like you can go to the Bahamas for a week?\u201d she asked.\n\nHe came home.\n\nAs the 1960s come to an end and the birth of their second daughter approaches, Vicky notices subtle changes in Lionel. The longer he\u2019s played football, the angrier he\u2019s become.\n\nLooking back on it today, she wonders whether all those football hits took too big a toll. She\u2019s heard from Lionel\u2019s teammates how he\u2019d get \u201cdinged\u201d in the head and return to the huddle, not knowing where he was. And she knows modern scientists are edging toward a direct relationship between concussions, mood changes, domestic violence and mental health issues.\n\nBut on a day in the fall of 1969, all Vicky knows is that Lionel is somehow different, and she\u2019s about to learn the extent. She returns to their Green Bay apartment one afternoon, running behind schedule, and Lionel accuses her of being late because she\u2019s having an affair. Lionel\u2019s teammates had always treaded lightly around Vicky at parties, knowing that if they looked at her too long, his jealousy and temper might flare. But before Vicky can get over her surprise at this accusation, Lionel slaps her.\n\nThere is no affair, she says, but the violence puts her beyond discussing it. She collects Angela and drives to their Milwaukee home, wondering what just happened. They\u2019d been through so much together, made so many sacrifices for each other, all for the sake of love. Now this? \u201cIt was something I never expected from him,\u201d she says.\n\nHe calls Vicky and apologizes, promising to never do it again. She acquiesces, neither expecting nor believing the violence will continue. Instead, it worsens.\n\nMichelle is born in February of 1970, but the presence of a second beloved child cannot stem the mounting malaise inside the Aldridge home. Visits from friends become scarce. Lionel keeps hitting Vicky, and sometimes, the only way she can get him to stop is calling Angela into the room. When the little girl enters, he relents. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have involved her,\u201d Vicky says today, \u201cbut I just didn\u2019t know what to do. I had tried everything.\u201d She\u2019d call the police, but to no avail. \u201cBecause of who he was,\u201d Vicky says, \u201cthey would just pat his head and tell him to not do that anymore.\u201d\n\nWhen Vicky\u2019s mother dies in September 1971, it\u2019s the impetus for a true reconciliation with her father. Despite the thaw, however, she knows biracial children won\u2019t be welcome back in Utah, so returning there isn\u2019t an option.\n\nAfter the \u201971 season, slumping Green Bay trades an aging Aldridge to San Diego, where he\u2019ll play two more years. His paranoia progresses, and he often accuses Vicky of trying to poison him. A Chargers teammate suggests he try transcendental meditation, and he does, sometimes for 20 minutes, sometimes for hours on end. The 1973 season concludes, and so does Aldridge\u2019s NFL career. But he\u2019s had a plan for life after football, and now, it\u2019s ready to blossom.\n\nBack in Milwaukee, a full-time broadcasting job with WTMJ awaits. Since the mid-1960s, he\u2019s done offseason work for the TV and radio stations, steadily honing his natural talent. Robinson remembers a diligent Lionel working to drop his southern accent, reading books in their room and repeating phrases like \u201chow now brown cow.\u201d The newly retired Aldridge continues doing sports anchor work on local newscasts. But now that he can work during football season, TMJ puts him on Packers radio broadcasts, pairing him with the singular play-by-play talents of Jim Irwin. It\u2019s not long before NBC tabs him as an analyst for national TV games.\n\n\u201cHe had a future at the network level,\u201d says Hank Stoddard, then TMJ\u2019s sports director. Stoddard compares Aldridge\u2019s analytical acumen, and his ability to communicate it, to the modern-day skills of Cris Collinsworth and Troy Aikman. \u201cHe was destined to become that type.\u201d\n\n\n\nAldridge\u2019s slide from sanity comes at an ever-quickening pace.\n\nStoddard is 80 years old now and living near the Pacific Ocean in San Juan Capistrano, Calif. Over a morning cup of coffee, he reminisces on Lionel while gazing out a window. He notes how the fog hides his view of the water, and he laments the fog that so enveloped Lionel.\n\nHe\u2019d started seeing troubling signs at work. The friendly cameraman who complained about Lionel\u2019s attitude. Aldridge asking why he had to go to Green Bay when the baseball reporter needed only drive to County Stadium. But one day, the problems crystallize.\n\nAldridge is supposed to do the 5 p.m. broadcast, but as the time approaches, he\u2019s at his desk just staring at the wall. Stoddard looks at the script in his typewriter: \u201cMy name is Lionel Aldridge, and I can do anything.\u201d That\u2019s it. Stoddard tells the news director Aldridge can\u2019t go on and ad-libs the 5 p.m. broadcast himself. Aldridge is driven home.\n\nThe slide from sanity comes at an ever-quickening pace. It includes blanking out while broadcasting a game, leaving Irwin hanging without an analyst. It includes a rifle pointed at his wife\u2019s head. It leads to a nervous breakdown in February 1975, a misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder, and a monthlong stay at Milwaukee Psychiatric Hospital. It leads him to the care of Dr. Alan Reed, then something of a celebrity psychologist in Milwaukee, but who Vicky and friends say only made things worse. Indeed, years later, Reed would lose his state license amid allegations that he had sex with a patient.\n\nReed isolates Lionel for weeks, refusing to let Vicky or anyone else see him, even Aldridge\u2019s mother, who\u2019s traveled from Detroit. Reed later tells Lionel he should divorce Vicky, and for years, she\u2019d have done anything to get away from him. But when finally given this exit route, she doesn\u2019t want it, feeling she shouldn\u2019t abandon Lionel in his current state. Aldridge moves out anyway, still far from stable. The clearest indication comes in August 1977.\n\nDespite the separation, Lionel visits his old house often, so when he shows up one evening, it\u2019s not surprising. But what he does next is surreal.\n\nAs he\u2019s leaving, Lionel picks up Charlie, the family\u2019s little white mutt, and walks outside. Vicky follows, asking where he\u2019s taking the dog. Lionel doesn\u2019t answer. Instead, he walks into the driveway, raises Charlie over his head, and hurls the dog to the ground. Horrified, Vicky screams at Lionel and tries pushing him away, but to no avail. He kicks the dog, then walks to the corner and sits on the curb, waiting for the police to arrive. The dog will soon die.\n\n\u201cI think it was his way of just crying out, saying somebody has got to find out what\u2019s wrong with me,\u201d Vicky says now. \u201cThe kids, luckily, were in bed, and luckily, it wasn\u2019t me he picked up and smashed.\u201d He spends another month hospitalized, this time at the Milwaukee County Mental Health Complex. Vicky warns Reed to stay away. She knows he\u2019s been unfaithful to his wife and threatens to tell her. It works. Lionel is diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. For the first time, he\u2019s medicated with Haldol.\n\nIt stops the voices but leaves him feeling like a zombie, so he doesn\u2019t always take it.\n\nAldridge struggles to continue his broadcasting career, and his TMJ co-workers support him, allowing time off when necessary. But it\u2019s too great a battle. One night, unable to go on the air, he sobs in his boss\u2019 office. Despite the protests of his colleagues, in 1979, he resigns. He still won\u2019t take his medication regularly.\n\nHe is at a loss, and now, he\u2019ll become lost. The voices tell him to start driving, so he starts wandering aimlessly about the country, the gasoline bills always sent home to Vicky. At first, she pays them, but soon cancels the credit card. She has to make ends meet for the kids, and her job as a radio station ad sales rep only pays so much. As it turns out, former Packer Willie Davis owns the station, WLUM, but she won\u2019t learn this until running into him at the office Christmas party.\n\nShe files for divorce in 1980, but it\u2019s delayed and delayed because Lionel can\u2019t be found. Finally, in 1982, the divorce goes through without his presence. Vicky and the kids leave for California to start a new life.\n\nFarrell Wankier Sr., who has remarried after Thela\u2019s death, is heading to Las Vegas with his second wife, and their path takes them through a southwestern Utah town called Beaver. They stop at a diner for a bite to eat, and in the midst of their repast, a man takes a seat next to them.\n\n\u201cHello, Farrell,\u201d the newcomer says. It is, through an astronomical coincidence, Lionel, who is hitchhiking through the area. Farrell barely recognizes him, but offers to buy his meal, and he accepts. Farrell also offers him a ride, and Lionel declines. They go their separate ways, and Farrell relays the amazing encounter to Vicky.\n\nThroughout the early 1980s, Lionel\u2019s cross-country wanderlust has taken him everywhere and nowhere, from Florida to Oregon, and seemingly all points in between. He\u2019s gone to the places he once lived \u2013 Louisiana, Utah, California \u2013 and to places he\u2019d never known. Many of those places, he\u2019s reached on foot, after selling his car for $100 in Florida. He\u2019s gotten work, and then left it behind. He\u2019s slept in a field near Salt Lake City, and left a Super Bowl ring behind.\n\nWith its loss, the lone tangible connection to his Packers past is a battered old Bible he\u2019d kept from his playing days.\n\nHis path eventually winds toward Milwaukee, but he gets stranded in Sidney, Neb. A charitable agency buys his bus ticket for the rest of the trip, and he settles in at the Milwaukee Rescue Mission. Back in the city that had been home for so long, he makes the medical breakthrough that\u2019s eluded him for so long. Dr. Melvin Soo Hoo finds a minimal medication level that works for Lionel, and he starts taking it with far more regularity. In January 1985, the 18th anniversary of that first Super Bowl, Aldridge learns his former teammates are chipping in to replace his lost championship ring. Lionel also lands work with the post office, then returns to broadcasting part time, and he gets an East Side apartment.\n\nBy 1986, Vicky and the kids are back in Milwaukee, too. The California plans haven\u2019t worked out, and Davis offers Vicky her old job back. She accepts, and comes home not just with daughters Angela and Michelle, but a granddaughter, too. Angela had gotten pregnant at age 17 and gave birth to Monica in 1985.\n\nVicky remarries in 1987 to a gentleman named Joe Nelson, who also happens to be black, and their wedding is at Milwaukee\u2019s All Saints Cathedral. She loves his quiet confidence and steady nature, and he bonds well with her daughters. He also supports Vicky\u2019s encouragement that Angela and Michelle forge a relationship with Lionel. She warns that if they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll someday regret it, knowing how much it meant to rebuild things with Farrell before his death in 1994.\n\n\u201cShe never spoke a bad word about [Lionel], and she could\u2019ve,\u201d Michelle says. \u201cShe never made us feel like he didn\u2019t love us. She just said that he was sick and not able to have a relationship.\u201d\n\nMichelle, now 44 and living with her husband in Kentucky, tears up remembering the first time she saw the new Lionel. \u201cHe just looked completely different. He looked good, but didn\u2019t look the same as I remembered him. A little awkward. But it was good.\u201d\n\nBy then, Lionel had stabilized enough to become a spokesman for mental health issues. He gives a speech at Michelle\u2019s high school, telling his own story so that others might learn from it. And in addition to his local mental health advocacy, he gives speeches nationwide on behalf of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. To this day, NAMI bestows the annual Lionel Aldridge Award at its national convention to a person living with mental illness, recognizing their \u201ccourage, leadership and service.\u201d\n\nTime, and time spent together, slowly bridges the gap between father and daughters. He brings them Christmas gifts. They share meals, either at his favorite George Webb or at his apartment, where he serves up broiled chicken and white rice. They check on him often to make sure he\u2019s OK, and to make sure he\u2019s on his medication. \u201cYou could always tell when he\u2019d not taken it because he would begin to swear more,\u201d Michelle says.\n\nWhen he\u2019s too far off his meds, the girls must persuade him to go to the hospital, molding their tactics to whatever personality he exhibits. Sometimes, he\u2019s like a little boy, and they tempt him with promises of ice cream. Sometimes, he\u2019s a mean man, and they must meet him with firm and forceful language. But he never gets violent with them.\n\nVicky also reconnects with Lionel, and she says Joe never questions nor feels threatened by it. And Lionel is re-embraced by his football roots. He\u2019s inducted into the Packers Hall of Fame in 1988. He\u2019s named to Utah State\u2019s All-Century Team in 1993.\n\nA few years later, Aldridge has a car accident that requires a tracheotomy, and Vicky makes regular hospital visits, reading to him and making sure he\u2019s well-cared for. He weighs some 400 pounds, and the doctor tells him if he doesn\u2019t lose 50 pounds, he\u2019ll be dead in a year.\n\nVicky takes the opportunity to tell Lionel something, too. He can\u2019t speak, so it\u2019s her chance to share just how much trouble and angst he\u2019d caused, and she doesn\u2019t have to worry about him talking back. He gives a muffled laugh, and she follows through on the promise, unloading all those years of pent-up pain and frustration. He absorbs it all without flinching.\n\n\u201cWhen I left him,\u201d Vicky remembers, \u201che mouthed, \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d\n\nDuring the late afternoon of Feb. 12, 1998, Michelle arrives at Lionel\u2019s apartment near Estabrook Park, where they\u2019d so often shared broiled chicken with rice. But this is not a dinner date, just another check-in.\n\nWhen she knocks on the door, Lionel doesn\u2019t answer. It\u2019s locked, but through a window, she can see him sitting at a desk. She knocks on the glass to get his attention, and though she thinks she can see him breathing, he doesn\u2019t respond. She pounds harder. Still nothing.\n\nNow she is getting frantic. She runs to another apartment and knocks on the door for help. A woman answers and is on the phone, and even though Michelle is panicked and screaming, the woman will not get off the phone. She goes to another door and a man answers. She tells him her father is dying or dead.\n\nThe man lets her in, and by now, Michelle\u2019s mind is racing so much she can\u2019t remember the number for 911. The man calls it for her, and rescuers are dispatched. Vicky is also notified, and she arrives, as does the boyfriend who\u2019d later become Michelle\u2019s husband. Police get through the window and into Lionel\u2019s apartment. They won\u2019t let Michelle in. They tell her he\u2019s dead.\n\nIt is two days before Lionel\u2019s 57th birthday. The medical examiner\u2019s report, according to a New York Times story, lists him at 408 1/2 pounds. His heart, so strong for so long, finally failed, the doctor\u2019s ominous prophecy come true.\n\nJoe Nelson plans the Feb. 16 funeral at All Saints Cathedral, and it is massive. Hundreds fill the church to capacity. \u201cIt seemed,\u201d Michelle says, \u201clike thousands.\u201d\n\nThe audience reflects the full spectrum of Lionel\u2019s journey. Vicky and Joe, other family and friends from Milwaukee and afar, city officials and mental health professionals, people in the media and people who were homeless. And, of course, a slew of Green Bay Packers, Willie Davis, Jerry Kramer, Bob Long and Dave Robinson among them. Michelle and Angela give eulogies, as does Monica, Lionel\u2019s 12-year-old granddaughter.\n\n\u201cLionel affected a lot of people in his life, whether he knew it or not,\u201d Vicky says. \u201cIt was quite a tribute.\u201d And because he had no insurance to handle the bill, those who shared in so much of his life give his family one more gift. His Packers\u2019 teammates pick up the tab.\n\nLooking back, it was never a question. \u201cHe was one of ours. He was a Green Bay Packer,\u201d Robinson declares. \u201cHis troubles were our troubles.\u201d\n\nNot long after Lionel\u2019s death, Vicky and Monica are in Utah visiting Norine, Vicky\u2019s sister. It\u2019s a sign of how far their once-cold relationship has come. Norine produces some letters that she and their mother, Thela, exchanged shortly after Vicky left Utah. Vicky and Monica sit on their bed, reading through them in chronological order. Tears stream down Vicky\u2019s face.\n\nYour dad is lying here on the couch in the dark. He hasn\u2019t eaten in a couple of days. We\u2019re not talking to anybody. How could she do this to us?\n\nThe content of the letters haunts Vicky, and the next morning, Norine admits to wondering whether she should\u2019ve let Vicky see them. Vicky gives Norine a long hug and apologizes for leaving with Lionel. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t to cause any pain or hurt,\u201d she says. \u201cI just fell in love.\u201d\n\nThe ladies go out to get their nails done, and Vicky tries to pay, but Norine won\u2019t have it. She won\u2019t let her pay for anything else, either. When it\u2019s time to go, she thanks Norine for all the hospitality. \u201cI was so mean to you for so many years,\u201d Norine says. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of making up to do.\u201d It cements their renewal.\n\nVicky remembers back to the night she was reading those letters with Monica, and what Monica had told her while taking her hand: \u201cOh Grandma, your mom and dad loved you,\u201d Monica said. \u201cYou were just ahead of your time.\u201d\n\nRuth Pitts doesn\u2019t know why she selects this particular prayer shawl. She goes through 10 or 20 of them, finally settling on a crocheted piece with warm brown tones and the merest hint of gold and green. Yes, she decides, this is it. The ladies at her United Methodist Church in Palm Springs, Calif., make the shawls, which are blessed and mailed out monthly to people needing prayer and comfort. In November of 2011, Pitts knows Vicky Aldridge Nelson needs both.\n\nDaughter Angela has died at age 43, unable to overcome years of her own drug and alcohol addiction. Like Lionel\u2019s memorial service, her funeral is at All Saints Cathedral. In the weeks and months afterward, Vicky comes to cherish the shawl, wearing it every day.\n\nIn the autumn of 2014, Vicky clutches the shawl even tighter. After living a life full of years both good and bad, she\u2019s in the midst of a particularly rough stretch. Stoddard, still friends with Vicky, had long ago nicknamed her the Unsinkable Molly Brown. Lately, she\u2019s had to be.\n\nIn September, her 81-year-old brother, Farrell Jr., dies in Salt Lake City. When Vicky was a child and he\u2019d come home on leave from the Army, she\u2019d leap into his arms, and he\u2019d produce a teddy bear. Then came the estrangement, which later gave way to their gradual knitting of the breach. Once, during Lionel\u2019s lost years of wanderlust, Farrell Jr. gave him money when he showed up unannounced. And when Vicky married Joe, it was Farrell Jr. who walked her down the aisle.\n\nThen in October, Vicky\u2019s mourning load doubles. Granddaughter Monica dies at age 28, and like her mother, addiction plays a role. Vicky deplores the continued stigma of addiction, how most don\u2019t think of it as a disease, mirroring the public\u2019s still-stigmatized perception of mental illness. All Saints hosts yet another Aldridge funeral.\n\nOn top of it all, Joe is starting to have health issues. His arteries need stents. He\u2019s in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Vicky\u2019s shawl is ever-present. And now, her Utah family wants to be, too.\n\nNorine and Farrell Jr.\u2019s widow, Deanna, beg Vicky to move to Utah with Joe, beg her to let them help lighten the load. When Vicky and Joe were at Farrell\u2019s funeral, they visited Salt Lake City\u2019s picturesque Liberty Park. Joe struck up a conversation with a passing black man, asking where he gets his hair cut. The man told him about a nearby barbershop, and how much he enjoyed living in the city.\n\nAnd so, in November, a once-cozy Milwaukee home is full of boxes. Vicky Aldridge Nelson is shipping them to Utah, where she was once ostracized for marrying a black man. Now, she will return there with husband Joe, and accept the warm and abiding embrace of family.\n\nHowie Magner is a senior editor at Milwaukee Magazine.
