A U.S. release date for the effort has not yet been announced.\n\nTHE DAMNED THINGS made its live debut on June 1, 2010 at the Knitting Factory in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nThe band's setlist was as follows:\n\n01. Ironiclast\n\n02. Excellent Time\n\n03. Bad Blood\n\n04. A Great Reckoning\n\n05. Handbook For The Recently Deceased\n\n06. Fazer (QUICKSAND cover)\n\n07. Grave Robber\n\n08.

We were both interested in putting together a heavy/classic-rock, blues-oriented, riff-based band while trying to stay away from what makes that sound generic and overplayed.\"\n\n\"We're trying not to over-think it,\" chimes in Ian. \"Nobody's arm is being twisted to be here. We're just doing it as we go along, and this is the natural progression. We're able to do things exactly how we want to do them by keeping it simple and comfortable for everyone.\"\n\nWith Trohman and Caggiano handling the production duties, the group began writing and recording songs mostly in Brooklyn, Chicago, and Buffalo (where Buckley resides). The template began to take shape, combining those elements of classic rock with the heavier aspects of ANTHRAX and EVERY TIME I DIE, and the hook-laden choruses of FALL OUT BOY.\n\nAccording to Buckley, THE DAMNED THINGS name was inspired by the lyrics in RAM JAM's '70s version of LEDBELLY's \"Black Betty\".\n\nWhile they've all experienced a degree of success, every member of THE DAMNED THINGS acts like there's something still to prove, and part of the exhilaration of it is starting over, going back to the reasons they first started playing music.\n\n\"I feel like I'm giving birth,\" laughs Trohman. \"It's painful and necessary at the same time for me to get this record made. It's really coming together the way I envisioned it in my head.\"\n\n\"This is still all so new to us,\" says Scott. \"There's no baggage yet. We're still very much in the honeymoon period. I remember what it was like to be in ANTHRAX back in 1984. It's just really exciting to get to do that again. I'm in a new band again. It's a blast.\"\n\nTHE DAMNED THINGS is:\n\nKeith Buckley: Lead Vocals\n\nScott Ian: Rhythm Guitar, Vocals\n\nRob Caggiano: Rhythm, Lead Guitar, Vocals\n\nJoe Trohman: Rhythm, Lead Guitar, Vocals\n\nAndy Hurley: Drums, Percussion\n\nJosh Newton: Bass\n\nFan-filmed video footage of THE DAMNED THINGS' June 6, 2010 concert in Brussels, Belgium can be viewed below."}, {"url": "https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/andy-hurley-33226.php", "page_content": "He studied anthropology and history in college as making a serious career in music wasn\u2019t on his mind at that time. Ever since he was a kid, he followed the belief that humans are supposed to live the way they used to live thousands of years ago, in their primitive state, but as he grew up, most of his beliefs faded.\n\nAndy Hurley was born Andrew John Hurley in Wisconsin on 31st May 1980 and lost his father when he was just 5. His mother took care of him for the rest of his childhood and teenage. Andy had saxophone as his very first musical instrument that he learned playing well and along with that, he also played percussion in his school\u2019s marching band.\n\nRecommended Lists:\n\nCareer\n\nAndy\u2019s introduction to professional music happened back when he was in the high school and was slowly gaining interest in playing drums. The year was 1996 and Andy was searching for opportunities to play with some big bands and in the pursuit of his dreams, he became part of several hardcore punk and heavy metal bands such as Killtheslavemaster, Racetraitor, Project Rocket and The Kill Pill. He was unable to find his true calling and kept trying different bands during this time.\n\nThe hardcore metal was getting popular in the late 90s and Andy\u2019s drumming skills got him gigs here and there but nothing concrete was coming across his way. However, things changed for the best in the year 2003, when one of his best high school friends Pete Wentz invited Andy to be a part of their band which was called the Fall Out Boy as they were in dire need of an additional drummer due to some troubles with their previous one, and it didn\u2019t take Andy much time to become a regular with Fall Out Boy.\n\nHis association with the band was extremely successful and despite the fact that this was the fourth band Andy was in, he got the fame in such a short time which he wasn\u2019t able to achieve through his previous stints in more than 5 years. Andy recorded the album \u2018Take This To Your Grave\u2019 with the band Fall Out Boy in 2003 to a mega universal success which helped Andy to become one of the hottest drummers around.\n\nIt was the first album by the band which was considered to be an actual hit and the band was reported by the media outlets to be the next big thing. The success continued with their next album titled \u2018From Under the Cork Tree\u2019, which climbed at the 9th spot in the Billboard 200 chart and the band spent the year 2005 touring around with their new found success. The album later went on to earn a Grammy nomination for the best New Artist.\n\nThe next two studio albums by the band titled \u2018Infinity on High\u2019 and \u2018Folie a Deux\u2019 also went on to achieve mega success in their concerts and digital downloads. However, Wentz faced severe emotional trouble during that time which also included a failed suicide attempt. It was being said that he is unable to handle the new found success the band was having and that, among several other things, led the band to take a break for some time in 2009.\n\nAndy got himself busy with several other projects and played for different bands such as a heavy metal band The Damned Things. The band was mostly a collaborative effort and featured members from Fall Out Boy, Anthrax and Every Time I Die and released their very first album titled \u2018Ironiclast\u2019. Enabler, another hard core band, hired Andy and in summer 2012, Enabler released their first album with Andy as a drummer titled \u2018All Hail the Void\u2019.\n\nLater in 2012, Andy joined a straight edge hard rock band named FocusedXminds, and during that time, media speculations were ripe about Fall Out Boy making a comeback and it was said that Andy will leave FocusedXminds when that happens. Fall Out Boy made a reappearance onto the musical sky in 2013, but Andy continued his association with FocusedXminds."}, {"url": "https://infofamouspeople.com/famous/andy-hurley.htm", "page_content": "35 years 35 years\n\nAndy Hurley's About \u270e]\n\nAndy Hurley was born on May 31, 1980 (age 43) in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, United States.

If you said nothing, you, my friend, are so very wrong. Heavy Metal supergroup The Damned Things return with their second opus, and first in nearly nine years, High Crimes, which arrives Friday, April 26, 2019, thanks to Nuclear Blast Records.\n\n\n\nSure, supergroups have a curious history of not always being quite so super, but The Damned Things merely scoff at this notion. The inception of the band began in 2008 when Fall Out Boy\u2019s Joe Trohman and Anthrax\u2019 Scott Ian sat down and began writing music together. With the seeds planted, the project grew to involve Trohman\u2019s bandmate Andy Hurley, Every Time I Die frontman Keith Buckley and his former bandmate Josh Newton, and Ian\u2019s former bandmate Rob Caggiano (of Volbeat). Together, the band released their debut, Ironiclast, in 2010, rocked the festival circuit, and then, most unfortunately, being forced to be super elsewhere got in the way of their collective fun.\n\n\n\nAfter a lengthy hiatus thanks to their pesky day jobs, the boys are back with a slight line-up twist: both Caggiano and Newton have departed, while Alkaline Trio\u2019s Dan Andriano has stepped in on bass \u2014 making The Damned Things even more super. For those keeping score, the Heavy Metal supergroup is now comprised of Vocalist Buckley, Guitarists Ian and Trohman, Bassist Andriano, and Drummer Hurley.\n\n\n\nTheir latest, the 10-song High Crimes, is the band\u2019s sophomore disc, produced by Jay Ruston (Anthrax, Stone Sour), and sees the group continuing their Blues and riff-oriented approach to a classic, heavy rocking sound. In the most Punk Rock sense, many of the songs are short suckerpunches that deliver maximum oomph, always with a nod to yesteryear\u2019s bluesier, grittier form of Rock-n-Roll.\n\nHigh Crimes opens to the heavy Nirvana influence of \u201cCells,\u201d a grungy Alt Rocker with some schnazzy guitar work, moments of melody, and a light-hearted look at the oxymoronic nature of life. Next, they amp up the wit on \u201cSomething Good,\u201d which opens to the gang chant \u201cY-E-L-L / All of my friends are going to hell.\u201d A funktastic beat anchors this catchy rocker about a relationship that has fallen apart.\n\n\n\nThe swagger of \u201cInvincible\u201d parades through some seriously bluesy, hard rockin\u2019 1970s influences. In fact, the band\u2019s backstory involves a whole lot of Thin Lizzy love, which is apparent on tracks such as this. True to their influences, this classic approach continues into the bass-heavy licks of \u201cOmen,\u201d before Buckley and the boys explode into the raucous licks of \u201cCarry a Brick.\u201d Here, they meander through a multitude of sounds to build into melodic, rocking choruses.\n\nAt nearly six minutes, \u201cStorm Chaser\u201d provides High Crimes\u2019 most epic offering. A sludgy, bluesy stomp, the track sees the band firing on all cylinders to craft an offering that is a delicious nod to a more masterful time in Metal. While it might not be the album\u2019s most catchy or radio-ready offering, it\u2019s certainly a killer representation of what The Damned Things are all about.\n\n\n\nThey amp it back up for the raucous pace of the groovin\u2019 \u201cYoung Hearts,\u201d a truly catchy rocker that prepares them to dip back into the sludge for the vicious cycle of \u201cKeep Crawling.\u201d Next, the boys present \u201cLet Me Be (Your Girl).\u201d (Yes, you read that correctly.) An explosion of gritty guitars, The Damned Things go all out for the oft psychedelic licks of the deeply grooving rocker. Ultimately, they end with the suckerpunch of \u201cThe Fire Is Cold.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf you step into High Crimes expecting a band that sounds like a schizophrenic cross between the members\u2019 other projects, then you\u2019re going to be seriously disappointed. The Damned Things have a definite classic Metal/Hard Rock vibe that blends with some smoky Psychedelia to author a dirty Punk Rock good time. Certainly, you can\u2019t question their musicianship, particularly the killer guitar antics of Ian and Trohman, and Buckley\u2019s signature vocal swagger. So, now that The Damned Things have put the \u2018super\u2019 back into the supergroup, Cryptic Rock give High Crimes 4.5 of 5 stars.\n\nPurchase High Crimes :\n\n[amazon_link asins=\u2019B07NS33MK4\u2032 template=\u2019ProductCarousel\u2019 store=\u2019crypticrock-20\u2032 marketplace=\u2019US\u2019 link_id=\u20197ebdd88b-76aa-4dbe-9241-c9a7b9b4902d\u2019]\n\nRelated posts: No related posts."}, {"url": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/fall-out-boys-andy-hurley-for-a-long-time-i-had-doubts-that-i-could-play-drums-anymore", "page_content": "Fall Out Boy first emerged from the early 2000s hardcore punk scene in Chicago.\n\nThe band - formed by bassist Pete Wentz, guitarist Joe Trohman and guitarist/singer Patrick Stump - stood head and shoulders above the competition with their extraordinary melodies, gigantic hooks and Stump\u2019s incredible vocal.\n\nPeople really started to take note with the release of debut album Take This To Your Grave in 2003, the first Fall Out Boy music to feature straight-edge, heavy metal-loving Andy Hurley on drums. The album was a pop-punk masterpiece that established Hurley as a force to be reckoned with behind the kit - equal parts Travis Barker and Dave Lombardo.\n\nThe band went on to achieve monumental success with follow-up album From Under The Cork Tree, which spawned mega hit Sugar We\u2019re Goin Down, followed by Infinity On High and Folie \u00e0 Deux.

What were the circumstances surrounding that?\n\n\u201cI was in hardcore bands with Pete [Wentz] for years. At the time I was going to college and playing in three bands. That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t ask me to join when they first started, but they needed someone to fill in for a tour and then they were recording some demos.\n\n\"The guy producing it, Sean O\u2019Keefe who also produced Take This To Your Grave, asked if I could play on them. I loved the music they were making. The music being written for the demos, which became Take This To Your Grave, was the best stuff I had ever been a part of.\u201d\n\nHow would you describe your drumming at the time?\n\n\u201cI think I reached my peak back then and I\u2019ve been coasting on that for 15 years! Not really. I think that\u2019s probably when I started coming into my own as a drummer, being in bands and figuring out how to play with a band. Joining Fall Out Boy was the best education for that.\u201d\n\nDid you have much recording experience before Take This To Your Grave?\n\n\u201cI\u2019d recorded with a few projects, but never anything like that. We recorded a lot of it in Madison, at Butch Vig\u2019s studio [Smart Studios]. It was the biggest studio and the biggest thing we\u2019d done. There was a microphone that Kurt Cobain used in that studio! Everything I\u2019d done [before that] was with friends, or in much smaller studios.\u201d\n\nWhat did you learn from the experience?\n\n\u201cConfidence. For a long time, even on From Under The Cork Tree and Infinity On High, I had doubts that I could play anymore. From Under The Cork Tree was the first major label record we did, so that was an even bigger thing than Take This To Your Grave. I guess Take This To Your Grave was the beginning of finding comfort - of knowing what I\u2019m doing and not over thinking it.\u201d\n\nFrom collaborating so much I\u2019m better at hearing what the core DNA rhythm is in a song\n\nBetween Take This To Your Grave and Mania, Fall Out Boy\u2019s sound has evolved. Would you say your drumming has developed in tandem with that?\n\n\u201cMaybe a little. After the hiatus there was a bigger tweak. I think it follows with being in a band with songwriters who have specific ideas. Both Joe [Trohman] and Patrick [Stump] have certain things they want accented on the drums, so every aspect of every song is a collaborative thing.\n\n\"I might have an idea for a kick pattern and it totally goes against the vocal pattern. I think the evolution is just being more subservient to what the song requires. On Mania, it\u2019s the most real drums you\u2019ll hear on songs in the modern Fall Out Boy era. On the last couple of records there\u2019s drums for the whole thing, but a lot of times they\u2019re mixed with drum loops or cut up.\u201d\n\nFrom Under The Cork Tree and Infinity On High are the band\u2019s biggest-selling albums. What do you remember about the writing and recording and did you have an inkling they were going to be hits?\n\n\u201cI think we knew that we\u2019d written some great songs and a great album, but I don\u2019t think we had any idea it would be as big as it was. I think it was just a belief that this is the best work we\u2019ve done to this point. You can rally behind that.\n\n\u201cThere was a moment in the recording of Sugar We\u2019re Goin Down where Patrick did a take of a harmony or something and there was just a look when he came into the booth where we were like, \u2018This is a hit!\u2019 He\u2019s got an amazing voice and I think that is a big reason for our success. He\u2019s just so talented. Obviously, that\u2019s all bluster and jokes in the studio; you have no idea if anyone will care.\u201d\n\nDid those two albums come together fairly easily?\n\n\u201cCork Tree... and Infinity... took work. Sugar\u2026 went through a lot of different iterations before it became the song that it was. The original verse I remember I hated. The idea for what the verse became happened last minute, right before recording. That saved it for me.\n\n\"There was a lot of stuff that we had to hash out in the rehearsal space for both albums. I don\u2019t really hear the songs until I\u2019m in the studio now. It\u2019s become much more on the fly, which I really love. I think different ideas come to me more than if I had the time to do what I\u2019d normally feel like doing. It\u2019s more instinctive.\u201d\n\nThe drum parts are a key element of Fall Out Boy\u2019s sound. How much input comes from the other guys?\n\n\u201cPatrick is a drummer and so he\u2019s big on specific rhythms and patterns. And Joe, with The Damned Things stuff - there were a lot of specific things he wanted. Other bands I\u2019ve played in recently have had people who were either drummers or really adept at writing drum parts in their demoing.\n\n\"I really like when there\u2019s a specific thing that someone wants to hear. I think that from collaborating so much I\u2019m better at hearing what the core DNA rhythm is in a song to begin with.\u201d\n\nDo you remember a point at which things were getting noticeably bigger for Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cI guess it was the Warped Tour in 2005, the year From Under The Cork Tree came out. That was us and My Chem. It was the year where it was getting pretty crazy. Even the year before, we had a show on some really small stage, I think it was in Detroit, and the crowd was too big and they knocked the fence down.\n\n\"There were a few shows like that here and there, but that year of Warped Tour was where every show felt like that.\u201d\n\nThen things went stratospheric! You seem a fairly private guy. How comfortable did you feel with the limelight?\n\n\u201cIt was something you get used to. I definitely don\u2019t like photoshoots, but I\u2019m pretty comfortable with it now. For stuff like [drum magazines] it\u2019s just me, but with the full band it\u2019s a little easier because I can be the fourth person in the group and don\u2019t necessarily have to carry it. That\u2019s usually Pete. He\u2019s really photogenic and good at that stuff.\u201d\n\nThe size of gigs changed dramatically too...\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing Sect shows during any off-time from Fall Out Boy. The weekend before we came out here I was in the midwest for three shows. We played a VFW [Veterans of Foreigh Wars] hall, a basement and a small club.\n\n\"To be honest, that actually makes me more nervous than playing an arena. I\u2019m used to [big shows]. I can\u2019t focus on any one person. A basement show, where there\u2019s going to be at most 50 people, I can see everyone and any mistakes are bigger because I\u2019m right in front of them.\n\n\"I\u2019m more comfortable because I feel more plugged into something at a smaller show, but I also feel like I have to play better. Actually, I don\u2019t have to worry about a lot of stuff at a show this size, whereas I worry a lot about the Sect shows because I have to make sure I have a kit, bring a snare and cymbals. I\u2019ll confess, I\u2019ve forgotten sticks once before! That\u2019s all coming from a situation where I don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d\n\nWhich drum parts would you say define your playing in Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cTake This To Your Grave is the one where I was trying to emulate Travis Barker and guys like that the most. I was playing more beats that go around the kit.\n\n\"I think there\u2019s stuff on Mania in terms of fills or just a stripped-down beat that I\u2019m most proud of. Last year my big inspiration in terms of drumming was Danzig\u2019s Chuck Biscuits. I think he\u2019s just one of the best drummers because he\u2019s so hard hitting. He\u2019s playing exactly what\u2019s needed.\n\n\"His fills, while simple, are better than a fill I would choose to do. I was a Dave Lombardo-influenced drummer growing up, so I tried to call Chuck\u2019s spirit into my playing more on Mania.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve played on plenty of hardcore and metal albums too. What do you consider to be your drumming highlights outside of Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cI think the Enabler record has a lot of stuff I\u2019m really proud of. Sect is probably the highlight of my musical career. The last record we did, which came out last year, is called No Cure For Death. Stylistically, what\u2019s being played is really fun, it\u2019s fast and fill-y and double bass-y and blast beat-y. But it\u2019s also about the people in it.\n\n\"There\u2019s a guy from Earth Crisis, who were one of my favourite bands growing up. The singer was in Cursed, which is my favourite hardcore band. They\u2019re also a vegan straight-edge band, which is important to me.\u201d\n\nFall Out Boy took a break between 2010 and 2012, during which time you stayed busy with a number of different music projects. Was it important to do things that were completely removed from FoB?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the impetus was that it needed be different, I think it was just about doing stuff. The hiatus was really difficult because you become so institutionalised to having a schedule laid out for a year and a half to two years. When you don\u2019t have anything, at that time it was really difficult for me. It was depressing.\n\n\"You spend all this time on tour being like, \u2018I just wish I was home and had nothing to do.\u2019 Then you have nothing to do for two weeks and you\u2019re like, \u2018I have no idea what to do with my life.\u2019\n\n\u201cA lot of cool opportunities came. That\u2019s where I met Earth Crisis through a mutual friend who was managing them and I filled in on a tour. Then I did the Enabler record and some tours with that. The Damned Things was the big one. That was awesome. I think that more just speaks to the fact that heavy metal and hardcore is the kind of music I grew up with.\u201d\n\nDid you take time to work on your playing during that period?\n\n\u201cNo. I met Tomas Haake from Meshuggah and asked him what he does to warm up or practise at home. He said, \u2018Nothing\u2019. When he\u2019s off he goes fishing. He doesn\u2019t touch drums. That\u2019s the case for me.\n\n\"On the hiatus I was playing a lot more with friends\u2019 bands and staying busy with that. Tomas said that he got to a place where he could play what he wants to play and then coasted, I guess.\n\n\"I can play all the kinds of music I want to play and that\u2019s what I love about music. I\u2019ve never been a dude who\u2019s practising every day to play crazier stuff.\n\n\u201cMy drum tech, Brandon, plays in this band Misery Signals. He\u2019s the best drummer I know. He\u2019s so technically proficient. He practises every day for two hours. He\u2019s always pushing himself to be better. I\u2019ve just never had that drive. But that\u2019s not to say that when there\u2019s something I want to play in a band and I\u2019m not able to nail it I won\u2019t practise and really work on things.\u201d\n\nDid you return to Fall Out Boy with renewed vigour?\n\n\u201cTotally. We couldn\u2019t come back putting out the same records and we wouldn\u2019t want to. That challenge to evolve with the times is fun and it keeps things interesting. I definitely think the break cleared my palette so I could plug in to the new form that Fall Out Boy existed in easier than if I wasn\u2019t doing these projects that let me loose.\n\n\u201cOn the Sect and Enabler records I\u2019d do takes of just fills - just filling through a whole song and figuring out what works best. It\u2019s interesting because coming back from hiatus, that\u2019s what I did for Fall Out Boy. I\u2019d do takes of just the beat that\u2019s going to be mixed with a loop or whatever and then we\u2019d do takes of fills, just to see if something comes out of it.\u201d\n\nA lot of bands that came up at the same time as Fall Out Boy are no longer about. You guys are still releasing Number 1 albums and selling out big venues. What do you think it is that keeps people coming back for more?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really thankful for the opportunity and the fact that people still care. I don\u2019t really fully understand why. We try to evolve and push our boundaries, because we want to and because it\u2019s a challenge to us to do something different every time while maintaining the DNA that makes us who we are. Maybe that\u2019s something that speaks to people, the fact that we\u2019re still inspired to make music that we love.\u201d\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t joined Fall Out Boy, what would you be doing today?\n\n\u201cI just watched an interview with [Star Wars actor] John Boyega on Desus and Mero\u2019s podcast. It\u2019s called Bodega Boys. They just talk about pop culture stuff. They asked John Boyega what he\u2019d be doing if he wasn\u2019t acting and he said, \u2018This is what I\u2019d be doing\u2019. This was his one option, there was no plan B. I feel the same way. If I\u2019m not doing this I\u2019ll be dead. If I wasn\u2019t in this band I\u2019d be in another band, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://blabbermouth.net/news/the-damned-things-we-ve-got-a-situation-here-video-released", "page_content": "\"We've Got A Situation Here\", the first video from THE DAMNED THINGS \u2014 the new band featuring members of FALL OUT BOY (Joe Trohman, Andy Hurley),ANTHRAX (Scott Ian, Rob Caggiano) and EVERY TIME I DIE (Keith Buckley, Josh Newton) \u2014 can be viewed below. The clip was written and directed by Brendon Small, the co-creator of Adult Swim's \"Metalocalypse\".\n\nTHE DAMNED THINGS will release its debut album, \"Ironiclast\", in North America on December 14 (one day earlier internationally) via Island/Def Jam.\n\n\"Ironiclast\" track listing:\n\n01. Handbook For The Recently Deceased\n\n02. Bad Blood\n\n03. Friday Night (Going Down In Flames)\n\n04. We've Got A Situation Here\n\n05. Black Heart\n\n06. A Great Reckoning\n\n07. Little Darling\n\n08. Ironiclast\n\n09. Grave Robber\n\n10. Blues Having The Blues\n\nCheck out the song \"Little Darling\" using the audio player below.\n\nRegarding the track, Buckley told AbsolutePunk.net, \"'Little Darling' may have been the most instinctually oriented song on the record as far as the lyric writing was concerned.\n\n\"I remember when Joe and Rob and I sat down to go over possible melodies, the first line was the 'example' we gave as to the vocal cadence of the verse. I remember saying, 'OK, so something that SOUNDS like 'little darling',' and went to the drawing board. After nothing really felt right, I realized that those two words were perfect from the beginning. It set the tone for the entire rest of the song which is essentially just a letter of apology for being so absent from certain people's lives.\"\n\nTHE DAMNED THINGS will perform on the Thursday, January 13 episode of ABC-TV's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" (which will actually air the morning of Friday, January 14).\n\nTHE DAMNED THINGS made its live debut on June 1, 2010 at the Knitting Factory in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nWhile each individual in the band has experienced their own successes, THE DAMNED THINGS' debut CD, which combines their love of classic rock anthems and powerful melodies with a heavy metal intensity, turns out to be much more than the sum of the separate parts.\n\n\"This is an amalgam of three very different bands,\" explained FALL OUT BOY guitarist Joe Trohman, who was first introduced to ANTHRAX's Scott Ian three years ago, when the two became fast friends and immediately began writing together. \"It seemed unlikely, but it turned out we were on the same page musically. We were both interested in putting together a heavy/classic-rock, blues-oriented, riff-based band while trying to stay away from what makes that sound generic and overplayed.\"\n\n\"We're trying not to over-think it,\" chimed in Ian. \"Nobody's arm is being twisted to be here. We're just doing it as we go along, and this is the natural progression. We're able to do things exactly how we want to do them by keeping it simple and comfortable for everyone.\"\n\nWith Trohman and Caggiano handling the production duties, the group began writing and recording songs mostly in Brooklyn, Chicago, and Buffalo (where Buckley resides). The template began to take shape, combining those elements of classic rock with the heavier aspects of ANTHRAX and EVERY TIME I DIE, and the hook-laden choruses of FALL OUT BOY.\n\nTHE DAMNED THINGS is:\n\nKeith Buckley: Lead Vocals\n\nScott Ian: Rhythm Guitar, Vocals\n\nRob Caggiano: Rhythm, Lead Guitar, Vocals\n\nJoe Trohman: Rhythm, Lead Guitar, Vocals\n\nAndy Hurley: Drums, Percussion\n\nJosh Newton: Bass"}]}
