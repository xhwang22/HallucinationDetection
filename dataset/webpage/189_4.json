making him eligible for the national team.\n\nThis also brought him the new name of Jiang Guangtai under citizenship.\n\nHis nine appearances for the Chinese national team have followed up his youth level appearances for England U21's.\n\nJeffrey Monakana\n\nMonakana started his professional career with Preston following his release from Arsenal following a decade stint in their youth ranks.\n\n40 appearances across two years scoring four goals, with a loan spell at Colchester in between earned him a move to Brighton as part of their development squad.\n\nSince then he has found himself posted at various spots in the United Kingdom from Aberdeen to Mansfield, failing to impose himself during those loan appearances, before eventually stepping down to join Sutton United on a permanent basis in 2016.\n\nYet even at National League level he couldn't settle with spells at Margate and Welling Town before he finally found relatively successful homes at Wealdstone and Dulwich Hamlet.\n\nA career sauntering through non-league looked like Monakana's destiny but evidently that was not in his plans and he now plies his trade in the Icelandic second division with Magni Greniv\u00edk.\n\nSimon Makienok\n\nThe former Danish international looked like a positive addition when he joined on loan from Italian side Palermo in 2016, following his goal-scoring exploits in his homeland with Brondby.\n\nBut as with most on this list, he wasn't able to consistently deliver in front of goal despite a hat-trick in the EFL cup against then-Premier League Bournemouth.\n\nA permanent move to Deepdale was not forthcoming so he switched his parent club in Italy for Utrecht of the Netherlands, replacing Sebastian Haller as the club's main forward.\n\nJust two games into his Eredivisie spell he tore his anterior cruciate ligament leaving him out for a lengthy spell which summed up his three years at the club making just nine appearances in that time.\n\nThat left him looking for another chance to reinvigorate his career, this time with German second division side Dinamo Dresden but a sending off seven minutes into his debut did little to endear himself to the support - relegation that campaign saw him released.\n\nHe now plays for FC St Pauli in the same division Dresden were relegated from and has finally been able to put together his first consistent spell of form since he left North End with five goals in 27 appearances.\n\nMarnick Vermijl\n\nAnother in a long line of former Manchester United players made the move to Deepdale, this time on loan from Sheffield Wednesday.\n\n28 appearances in that loan spell earned him a permanent contract, but two seasons into his time saw him out of favour and out on loan at Scunthorpe United.\n\nMVV Maastricht was his next loan destination and the second division Dutch club saw enough in him to end his four year Lancashire stint on a permanent basis.\n\nMuch like his permanent move to Preston following on from his loan, he failed to kick on and MVV quickly moved him on to Belgian Amateur division side Thes Sport where he currently resides.\n\nJuvhel Tsoumou\n\nThere is hardly a club this man hasn't played for following his time at Deepdale.\n\nMoving from Aachen to North End in 2011 after a successful trial, he was one of a long list of strikers who failed to make the grade at the club with just 16 appearances and three goals seeing him quickly shipped off to Plymouth Argyle on loan.\n\nAnother change in scenery at Austrian side TSV Hartberg came next with six goals for them in one season before a move to Slovakia.\n\nIt looked like Tsoumou had finally found some stability after 29 goals in two seasons in the fourth tier of German football but the jetsetter that he is, he played in Cyprus, China and Romania where he played for European giants Steaua Bucharest on two occasions.\n\nTsoumou now plays for Moroccan side Wydad AC, but judging by his current career path, there will be many more travel destinations to tick off for the Congo international.\n\nDownload the LancsLive app for free on iPhone here and Android here .\n\nDon't miss a thing from the club you love!

They have since shaped the future direction of the Trust with the launch of an innovative and forward-thinking three-year strategy that aims to build a safer, stronger and more resilient community, by utilising the power and appeal of Preston North End and football as a whole.\n\nUnder the stewardship of Tom and Harriet, the Trust won the North West Football Awards\u2019 \u2018Community Club of the Season \u2013 All Other Leagues\u2019 prize for 2019/20 season, receiving the award for the first time and being recognised for its \u2018creative and innovative\u2019 approach.\n\nPNECET Chair of Trustees and Preston North End Football Club Finance Director Kevin Abbott said: \u201cThe Board of Trustees unanimously felt that the time was right to make this change following the continued development of the Trust under Tom and Harriet\u2019s guidance for the past year or so.\n\n\u201cBoth the Board of Trustees and the senior management team of the football club are very proud of the work that the Trust delivers in the local community, particularly the support that has been provided throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe promotions of Tom and Harriet into these newly created roles demonstrates our confidence in their ability to continue to drive the Trust forward and help it to thrive.\u201d\n\nTom Drake added: \u201cI am proud to be continuing to lead Preston North End Community and Education Trust in the new role of Chief Executive Officer of the Trust.

Richard Wright\n\nWe all know the story of Richard Wright, the man who spent the final years of his career sitting on the bench, earning a lovely pension courtesy of Manchester City and Sheik Mansour.\n\nWright joined Preston North End from Ipswich Town after enjoying a successful spell at Arsenal and being touted as the next England number one.\n\nHe had only played once for Ipswich prior to his Deepdale move in July 2012 but within a week had claimed he was \"homesick\" and left for the promise of quite a lot more money.\n\nHow much did he earn whilst at City? \u00a34.1m. How many games did he play? 4.1m less than that.\n\n2. Juvhel Tsoumou\n\nIn fairness to Juvhel, he came into the squad at a time when Neil Mellor and Iain Hume were expected to be starting, although trusting in the fitness of the latter may have been an error.\n\nSigned from second division German side Alemannia Aachen, where he had played just six times, Congoloese striker Juvhel Tsoumou was an absolute disaster.\n\nTsoumou was shipped off on loan to Plymouth and then sold to Austrian outfit TSV Hartberg in 2012 when the club had a major clear out.\n\nHe played just 16 times for the Lilywhites.\n\n(Image: Bongarts/Getty Images)\n\n3. Veli\u010de \u0160umulikoski\n\nFrom Turkish side Bursaspor to Ipswich Town to Preston North End and then back off to obscurity and Russian minnows.\n\nVeli\u010de \u0160umulikoski was touted as a midfield mastermind from Macedonia but ended up being a flop.\n\nThe eastern European played just 15 times under Alan Irvine, having limited impact before being released early from his contract.\n\nThe Macedonian Gerrard, he was not.\n\nHe currently plays in the Czech Republic.\n\n4. David Amoo\n\nThe first Graham Westley signing on this list and certainly not the last. We could do a full list on Westley. In fact, we did.\n\nDavid Amoo failed to do anything of real significance at Deepdale, proviing further evidence, if it was ever needed, that Westley's squad overhaul could be considered 'inconsistent'. He did equalise against Bamber Bridge in a pre-season friendly that saw Westley repeatedly question the competence of the fourth official. In a friendly. Against Bamber Bridge.\n\nAmoo was only 20-years-old when he arrived at Preston in May 2012 but was highly-rated having spent most of his life playing at Liverpool's academy.\n\nLargely unproven, the youngster failed to score in his 17 appearances at Deepdale and moved to Carlisle before moving onto Patrick Thistle in Scotland.\n\n5. Neal Trotman\n\nWho? Strong centre-back who played for the Lilywhites between 2008 and 2011?\n\nTrotman arrived at Deepdale in January 2008 for a fee of \u00a3500,000 and soon after suffered an injury that kept him out of the side for the rest of the season.\n\nA lack of fitness and form saw the Englishmen sent out on loan to Wigan, Huddersfield, Colchester and Southampton before his painful stay at Preston finally came to an end in 2011.\n\nRochdale snapped up Trotman after he was released by North End, he played a total of four games in three years for the Lilywhites.\n\n(Image: Aldershot News and Mail)\n\n6. Andy Smith\n\nAndy Smith arrived at Preston with a scorching scoring record, netting 31 in 64 games for Northern Irish side Glenavon.\n\nUnsurprisingly, prolific scoring is hard to transfer from a largely semi-professional league to the Championship and Andy Smith failed to score in his 15 appearances at Deepdale.\n\nHe was shipped off on loan three times where he also failed to score before finally leaving for Bristol City in 2007.\n\nGiven Preston's current record of developing talent, you can at least see where they were coming from with this one.\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\n7. Habib Sissoko\n\nA brief flash in the pan, French-born Malian forward Habib Sissoko played just seven times for Preston North End in 1998.\n\nFor reasons known only to future Manchester United legend David Moyes, he took on Sissoko in January 1998, buying him from French fifth division side Louhans-Cuiseaux FC.\n\nSissoko was released at the end of the 1998 season and Moyes went on to forge his managerial career at Deepdale, leaving only vague memories behind.\n\nThe Malian played for nine more clubs after the Lilywhites.\n\n8. Rhys Taylor\n\nAnother Westley signing, Rhys Taylor was a youth product at Chelsea who was brought in as part of that squad overhaul in 2012.\n\nThe keeper was only 22-years-old at the time but he made no appearances for the Lilywhites and was shipped out to Macclesfield Town before the end of 2013.\n\nA keeper, signed by Westley, who never played for North End before getting sold - where have we heard that before? At least we got Stuckmann in the end.\n\n9. Aaron Brown\n\nPreston North End was just another stop in Aaron Brown's winding and uninteresting journeyman career.\n\nThe centre-back Brown has played for a total of 19 clubs in just ten years with the Lilywhites being the most prestigious by far.\n\nLeaving then League Two side Aldershot Town in January 2012 after playing 10 times for the Shots, Brown made the move to Deepdale, having been signed by, guess who, Westley.\n\nHe joined the Lilywhites in Febraury played for them four times and was released in May, joining Maltese club (yeah Maltese club) Floriana aged 28.\n\n10. Seyfo Soley\n\nWhat can we say about Seyfo Soley?\n\nThe Gambian midfielder was signed in the summer of 2007 from Belgian side Genk after spending six season in the country doing the square root of nothing.\n\nHe featured six times in white, did very very little, was sent packing after refusing a deal and failed to find another professional contract for four years.\n\nSoley last played for Cyprian team Doxa Katokopias in 2011."}, {"url": "https://www.theofficialboard.com/biography/david-taylor-g5943", "page_content": "Which links about David Taylor are irrelevant and thus should be deleted?\n\nHow does this work?\n\n\n\nOur links are provided by our members and by our search technology.

The result was a 272 page football book like never before.\n\nTurning the camera from the pitch to the stands PNE Forever \u2013 Stories from the fans of Preston North End provides a fascinating history as 116 fans share their memories and stories of supporting the Lilywhites.\n\nFrom the \u201830s to the present, fans recall the days of rattles and rosettes, \u201854 and \u201964, Finney\u2019s farewell, the Black Prince, Nobby\u2019s heroes, and the goals of Elwiss, Fuller and Garner. Their memories are our memories; relegation, re-election, re-birth, promotion, the plastic pitch and play-offs galore.\n\nAmongst the memories lay a variety of personal and entertaining stories: Nicking Moysie\u2019s shorts; a phone call from Shankly; Maradona\u2019s barber; climbing Hartlepool\u2019s floodlights; a lift from Sir Tom; days in the Crazy Corner; and a half-time marriage proposal. It\u2019s all there!\n\nArranged into twelve chapters including Senior Whites, Away Days, Whites in Exile, and Prized Possessions, each interview resonates with the next to produce a unique history of a proud club.\n\nThroughout the interviews the words family, passion, and community, often arise to highlight the enduring bond between city and club. And in turn this exhibition shows not only fans of Preston North End but also a snapshot of our proud community.\n\nArun Patel\n\n\u201cRemember Torquay at home when Moore got sent off for throwing a punch? The last match on plastic \u2013 that was something! My family used to have a shop on Inkerman Street and I worked there from the age of 17 to 47. The morning after the game, I went to open up at 6am and there were pieces of plastic pitch scattered all over the street. I thought, what the hell is going on? Then outside the shop was a massive piece so I took it inside and I\u2019ve kept it ever since!\u201d\n\nBev Taylor\n\n\u201cI was brought up on Deepdale Road and more or less lived opposite the ground which explains why I\u2019m a massive fan. My earliest PNE memory is of seeing Alex Bruce scoring and, over the years, I\u2019ve loved watching players like Gareth Ainsworth and Grezza. For me, my favourite players have always been the ones who show some passion, those who put the shirt on and make that connection with us in the stands.\u201d\n\nChristian Wainman\n\n\u201cMany years ago my Sister, Melissa, played for PNE Ladies under twelves where my Dad, Steve, was the coach. As I got older, I became more interested in football and Dad would take me along to watch the games. Then in 2000, the under twelves held a fundraiser event at Deepdale and as soon as I entered the ground I was hooked! At the event, I was lucky enough to win the raffle and was presented with the prize at PNE\u2019s next home game. That Saturday, I was wheeled onto the pitch and received a shirt signed by David Lucas. It was my first ever match at Deepdale, and I\u2019ve only missed nine home games since!\u201d\n\nDavid Hodkinson\n\n\u201cAs kids, we used to sit on the railings at the match and I remember having a rattle which made a heck of a racket! We also used to play footy on the area outside the old West Stand. That was our pitch. We\u2019d use the West Stand gates as goals but those gates were so big, if you were in goal you\u2019d no chance of saving anything! Tommy Docherty was one of my favourites back then. He lived on Lincoln Street near us and would always be very generous when we put our Guy Fawkes out on Peel Hall Street. Bobbie Beattie was another favourite along with Willie Cunningham and of course Sir Tom.\u201d\n\nPhoto: David & Anne Hodkinson\n\nDorothy Alice Dawson\n\n\u201cMy first ever match at North End I went on the Spion Kop. I can see it now.\n\nOh, it was magical!\n\nI had a regular spot on the Kop on one of the corners where they put the half-time scores up. I used to perch myself on top of the railings. It was a handy spot. The best I ever saw was Tom Finney. He was magic. They used to say, \u2018Give it to Tom, he\u2019ll score!\u2019 Bill Shankly was great too. I remember chasing him for his autograph. He lived on Deepdale Road by the County Arms. I got it too! I used to chase them all for autographs. I was football mad.\u201d\n\nEmma Price\n\n\u201cWembley 2015 is one of the stand-out games for me for obvious reasons but, other than that, it is really difficult to pick just one game. I think one of the reasons I enjoy going to football matches, especially away days, is for the atmosphere and the day out, sometimes more than the football itself. So, for that reason, my favourite games are Blackburn in 2016, and Fulham away in 2017 when it was Gentry Day.\n\nGentry Day is such a special part of being a Preston fan, and to have hundreds of North End fans dressed to the nines with their bowler hats and singing through London was such a brilliant day.\u201d\n\nPhoto (L to R): Megan Price, Emma Price, Matthew Price.\n\nGary Johnson\n\n\u201cWhen I was young, some friends started taking me on Deepdale with them and that\u2019s how I began.\n\nMy first game was in 1970 when I was aged eight. I sat in front of the old West Stand at the edge of the pitch on the cinder path with all the other kids. It was November and freezing. We were chucking the cinders onto the pitch when my mate threw one of my shoes on. I ran on to get it and the next thing I knew a Policeman had grabbed hold of me. \u2018You\u2019re not allowed on the pitch, son!\u2019 He shouted, \u2018we\u2019ll chuck you out next time that happens!\u2019 Ha! It wasn\u2019t a great start.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Gary with grandson, Jayden.\n\nJayden Sutcliffe: Frontispiece \u2013 PNE Forever\n\nHarry Billington\n\n\u201cIn them days, your Grandmother or someone would knit you a scarf, and everybody had these rattles which were really redundant stock from the war. They were from the ARP Wardens who would go round the streets spinning the rattles telling people to get inside or into the air raid shelters. They must have had thousands in stock. Now they\u2019d be a lethal weapon. Oh, they were a noise; my Dad used to say, \u2018Stop that in house!\u2019\n\nAt the cup final there were 100,000 fans, so imagine all the rattles. Oh, the noise!\u201d\n\nJacob Baker\n\n\u201cFor me, supporting PNE is not only a pastime, but a passion. There is truly no better experience than a cold floodlit Deepdale on a rainy Tuesday night. The atmosphere is unbeatable with tackles flying in and shots forcing goalkeepers into magnificent saves. Following PNE is to be immersed into a nail-biting world of goals, cards and excitement, unless it\u2019s a nil-nil draw, but every team has them. Ha! I love watching PNE; they play a huge part in my life and give me hope and ambition.\u201d\n\nJohn Devey\n\n\u201cLast year, my now-ten-year-old Daughter went on her first ever home game having refused until then. It was Lukas Nmecha\u2019s debut and, at the end of the game as he walked off, she asked for his shirt and he threw it to her! She was buzzing. \u2018Will I get a players shirt every time, Dad?\u2019 she asked. He didn\u2019t really turn out to be a great loan signing for us but his kind gesture ignited the spark and, although she may never get a player\u2019s shirt again, my Daughter has definitely got the PNE bug.\u201d\n\nJonny Richardson\n\n\u201cMy first away game was in 1984 at Plough Lane, and I loved it. By the early 90s, we started to exploit away trips by jazzing them up, staying over in random places or taking major detours just because we could. It all began with Plymouth away in 1993 when my mate, Paul and I spontaneously took our passports and a significant detour by boarding the overnight ferry from Portsmouth to Le Havre on a Thursday night. We sailed back from France on the Friday night, arriving exhausted at Plymouth to see PNE lose 4-0 on the Saturday. But despite the defeat, we were buzzing at what we\u2019d achieved, and PNE Ferries, as a concept, was born.\u201d\n\nJoyce & Olive Watson\n\n\u201cIn those days not many women really went to football, let alone play it. It was a couple of years before Tom Finney finished. Dad went in the old West Stand and we\u2019d go in the Paddock. The Brindle Brass band used to sit in front of the Paddock on a long bench. We were so small we could barely see over the railings and the band members used to lift us over and sit us with them on the bench. If there wasn\u2019t enough room, we\u2019d sit on their knees! They used to play \u2018Margie\u2019 when the team came out. That was the main one, and they\u2019d march up and down the pitch\u201d\n\n.\n\nKara Lee\n\n\u201cFor my 10th birthday my Grandad paid for me to be a mascot at the PNE v West Brom game on the 2nd December 2019. Sadly, we lost 1-0 as they scored a penalty in the final minutes but the evening was great. I got a tour of the stadium, went in the dressing rooms and met nearly all the players. The ones I didn\u2019t see, I saw after the game as we waited outside for them. And I got to walk out on the pitch with Jayden Stockley. I asked him for one of his shirts afterwards and he gave me one with a message on it. It was the best PNE experience and even losing didn\u2019t make me disappointed.\u201d\n\nLucy Crompton\n\n\u201cWhen he was older, the company Grandad worked for used to work together with Tom Finney\u2019s company at Marks & Spencer stores all over Lancashire. One day, Grandad\u2019s boss told him to be ready outside Moor Park Avenue on Garstang Road to be picked up for a lift to Kendal. It\u2019s 7:15am, he\u2019s waiting patiently and sees this car coming down the road and thinks, I know that car, it\u2019s Tom Finney\u2019s. The car stops and Tom Finney asks, \u2018Are you going to Kendal?\u2019 Grandad says, \u2018Yes\u2019 and Finney says, \u2018well, I\u2019m taking you.\u2019 And that was it. Tom Finney drove my Grandad all the way to Kendal and apparently never spoke of football once, nothing at all! Imagine.\u201d\n\nPhoto (L to R): David Williams, Lucy Crompton.\n\nLuke \u2018Tomo\u2019 Thompson\n\n\u201cI\u2019m at high school now but I became a ball boy when my primary school teacher recommended me and my friend to Michael Aspinall who runs the ball boys. My teacher knew I was a North End nut. Before I was a ball boy, I used to go on with my Grandad, my Uncles and my Dad. The whole family supports PNE. I love everything about the club and my dream is to play for North End. I used to play centre-mid but I\u2019m more of a winger now, a bit like Barkhuizen. Supporting PNE and being a ball boy means everything to me. I don\u2019t know what I would do every other week without it. It\u2019s a big honour. I\u2019m very lucky.\u201d\n\nMavis Penswick\n\n\u201cThe photo was taken before the semi-final against Sheffield Wednesday at Maine Road in Manchester. Oh, it was a good day, a good day! Especially winning.\n\nI can\u2019t remember much about the game to be honest, but afterwards it was funny. We went on the upstairs of the bus and I had this rattle which you can see in the photo, and I was hanging out of the window rattling it and I dropped it! Luckily we were stopped in a queue of traffic coming out of Maine Road, and some kind soul picked it up and brought it back on the bus.\u201d\n\nPaul Eastham\n\n\u201cThe game that stands out for me is the semi at Villa Park in torrential rain. It seems like yesterday. It was hammering down from the moment we set off to the moment we got back. They wouldn\u2019t have played today in that rain and mud. It would\u2019ve been called off. Anyway, Villa went a goal up and Dawson equalised with a penalty. Then late on, the ball was cleared from a corner and Singleton, from about forty yards out, booted the ball back. Whether he was really going for goal, I don\u2019t know, but we were right behind the goal and just watched it sail into the net. Incredible! I don\u2019t think he got many, but that was a great one.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Margaret & Paul Eastham\n\nStephanie Lambert\n\n\u201cYou had two choices in our house: support North End, or pack your bags!\n\nI\u2019m one of three sisters and we\u2019re all keen supporters. Dad took us all to Deepdale as kids and my Mum has been to her fair share. Mum is from Chelsea, and I think it would be fair to say Dad converted her to the cause too. Dad actually left his wedding reception to be with his first love: PNE. Mum obviously has the patience of a saint. It was 1987, home to Doncaster Rovers, and we lost 2-1. Mum likes to say, \u2018He won me, what more could he want?\u201d\n\nTom Metcalfe\n\n\u201cGoing on PNE is its own cultural institution, its own little world.\n\nI remember when we were kids and someone saying, \u2018Yeah, my dad\u2019s letting me swear, but only for the Blackpool game!\u2019\n\nFollowing your local team, it\u2019s more like a religion \u2013 you don\u2019t get a choice. I know some people from Preston support Liverpool and so on and just watch Match of the Day, but they\u2019re not really fans. I\u2019d call them hobbyists. It\u2019s not the same as going and supporting your local team. I learnt very early in life there are people who are just interested in football and then there are football fans, and I\u2019m a football fan, and I follow PNE, do you know what I mean?\u201d\n\nTom Wright\n\n\u201cMy favourite home game is the famous Blackpool match in August 2013. There\u2019s plenty to choose from but it\u2019s got to be the North West derby. It was such a special occasion for me given the importance of bragging rights (living there myself) and the sheer passion and rivalry between the fans. We hadn\u2019t played each other in a few seasons and they\u2019d had the better few years compared to us, so to bring them back down to earth and let them know we\u2019re superior and the Pride of Lancashire made it so much better.\n\nPNE means the world to me. It\u2019s a family club, and through it I\u2019ve met the best people I could ever have hoped to meet!\u201d\n\nTrevor Johnson\n\n\u201cDavid Nugent\u2019s bowler hat, remember that? Well it wasn\u2019t David Nugent\u2019s bowler, it was mine, and still is. But it\u2019s the one he wore after scoring away at Watford. I lobbed it onto the pitch when he was celebrating and he duly picked it up and popped it on. Incidentally, I bumped into Nuge in Sharm El-Sheikh many years later in a bar. We got chatting and I said, \u2018Do you remember wearing the bowler hat at QPR?\u2019 And he quite rightly put me right and said, \u2018Nah, mate, it was Watford away.\u201d\n\nVipul Patel\n\n\u201cGrowing up, we were a cricketing family and never went to watch PNE but I always used to wonder what being on the terraces was like. The first match I actually went on was with my eldest son, Raj, when he was four. It was against Oldham and I remember the buzz around the ground before the match and how excited Raj was at being able to go inside the ground. It was a 1-0 win so a great start for our North End experience.\n\nI believe PNE is a family-orientated club which is inclusive of everybody. I\u2019m proud to support them. The club and its players are so involved with charity and community work and give a lot back to Preston.\u201d\n\nPhoto (L to R): Aaryan, Bhim (top), Vipul, Raj.\n\nWendy Skerritt\n\n\u201cIn 2000, I was on the Flag Market after we\u2019d won Division 2 under David Moyes, celebrating with thousands of other PNE fans, when I received a message from a friend working in the Harris asking if me and my friends would like to come up to where the players and VIP guests were gathered on the top steps. So we explained to the Police who were manning the barriers that we\u2019d been invited up. They lifted us over the barriers and threw us in the back of a Black Maria (everyone thought we\u2019d been arrested) and drove us to the side door where we gained entry. It was fantastic, and I got my photo taken with Moysie and the Cup!\u201d\n\nMark Naylor\n\n\u201cI discovered my connection with PNE when I began researching my family history. Whilst scanning the local papers for a photo of my Grandfather, Sidney Naylor \u2013 who sadly died in World War 1 in 1918 \u2013 I came across an article in the Lancashire Daily Post, dated the 30th January 1905, which gave details on the death of Sidney\u2019s Father, my Great Grandfather, William Naylor. In the article it stated William was one of a group of cricketers who moved from \u2018the marshes\u2019 \u2013 now the Strand Road area \u2013 to Moor Park to play their matches. It would be members of this group of cricketers who would go on to become founders of PNE and make Deepdale its home ground!\u201d\n\nMichael\u2019s website\n\nMichael\u2019s twitter\n\nMichael\u2019s Instagram"}, {"url": "https://www.lep.co.uk/sport/football/preston-north-end/when-lee-ashcrofts-hat-trick-saw-preston-north-end-overcome-kevin-keegans-fulham-3470681", "page_content": "At the time the Cottagers were in the early days of being owned by Mohamed Al-Fayed who was started to pump money into them.\n\nBut for all their riches, they had no answer to Preston boy Ashcroft who netted a hat-trick as PNE ran out 3-1 winners in this Second Division clash.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nNorth End even gave their visitors from the capital a goal start, roaring back through Ashcroft\u2019s treble to halt a run of four successive home defeats in the league.\n\nNorth End Manager Gary Peters congratulates hat-trick hero Lee Ashcroft\n\nPost-match, Preston boss Gary Peters described it as a victory for \u2018passion over money\u2019.\n\nPeters was delighted to finally put points on the board from a home game \u2013 it had been nearly two months since that had happened.\n\nThings didn\u2019t go to plan to start with, North End falling behind in the sixth minute.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nMark Blake\u2019s pass down the right wing was collected by Paul Peschisolido who took the ball beyond left-back Dean Barrick.\n\nKevin Keegan signing autographs for the Preston fans at Deepdale\n\nPeschisolido sent over a low cross into the box which PNE centre-half Michael Jackson stretched to cut out.\n\nBut he succeeded only in directing the ball into the path of Rob Scott who found the net at the near post.\n\nThe Lilywhites were level by the 11th minute and what a cracker it was too.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nBarrick won possession and fed the ball to Michael Appleton who played a neat one-two with Rankine before finding Ashcroft with a pass.\n\nAshcroft spun just inside the box and curled a superb finish into the top corner past keeper Maik Taylor.\n\nWith their tails up, PNE went on the attack with Appleton seeing a shot saved by Taylor.\n\nTony Lormor put a header wide, while Gary Parkinson was off target with a shot.\n\nNorth End went 2-1 ahead in the 69th minute.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAshcroft got possession in the box and was clipped by Neil Smith as he attempted to turn past the Fulham man.\n\nReferee Eddie Lomas pointed to the spot, Ashcroft picking himself up to beat Taylor with the penalty.\n\nThe striker\u2019s hat-trick was completed seven minutes from time.\n\nBarrick\u2019s pass found Rankine down the left hand side of the box.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nRankine pulled the ball back to Ashcroft who took it across the face of the box before drilling a shot into the bottom corner.\n\nAshcroft was to admit that his hat-trick almost didn\u2019t happen as he had started to feel his hamstring tighten.\n\nHe had delayed signalling to the bench, though, and was glad to have kept quiet.\n\nWhen his third goal hit the back of the net, Ashcroft did alert the bench and got a big hug from Peters as he left the pitch for a well-earned rest, Michael Holt replacing him up front.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAshcroft\u2019s treble had taken his goal tally to five in the last five games, all of them when he had Lormor partnering him up front.\n\nIt was his first hat-trick in PNE colours, this his second spell at the club.\n\nAnother treble had come earlier playing for West Bromwich Albion.\n\nEven at 3-1 and with Ashcroft\u2019s feet up in the dugout, North End pushed on looking to increase their lead.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nSean Gregan, who had been outstanding in midfield, saw a shot in stoppage time take a coat of paint off the bar as it travelled inches too high."}, {"url": "https://www.lep.co.uk/sport/football/preston-north-end/preston-north-end-transfer-rumours-lilywhites-linked-striker-could-join-birmingham-city-instead-nottingham-forest-man-could-join-divisional-rivals-3338649", "page_content": "Preston North End's new season got off to a nightmare start last weekend, as they were blown away by newly-promoted Hull City who claimed a shock 4-1 win at Deepdale.\n\nThe Lilywhites were ahead after just eight minutes, with ex-Denmark youth international Emil Riis opening the scoring, but a 35th-minute equalising goal from opposition star Keane Lewis-Potter was a sign of things to come, with Preston's opponents going 2-1 up on the hour mark, before scoring a further two goals late on.\n\nSpeaking after the game, Preston skipper Alan Browne said: \u201cIt was a dream start, it felt like what we thought it would going into it.\n\n\u201cWe got the early goal, took the pressure right off us and then for whatever reason, we just folded after that.

Following lockdown, they slipped from sixth to ninth before starting the new season in terrible form at home, losing five on the bounce.\n\nThe names of two Bens, Davies and Pearson would probably have featured inside Neil\u2019s secret envelope. But with their contracts ending in a few months\u2019 time and neither wanting to renew, one more than quadrupled his wages by joining champions Liverpool and the other was allowed to sign for Bournemouth in the most recent transfer window, along with Darnell Fisher who went to Middlesbrough.\n\nDavies, playing for Preston in September, joined Liverpool for around \u00a31.6 million in January (Photo: Kevin Barnes/CameraSport via Getty Images)\n\nThe end of January and beginning of February was a hectic period at Deepdale. Preston were the busiest club in English football\u2019s top four divisions. Lots of players came, lots of players went. Seventeen transfers were sanctioned in total: eight signings, eight departures; 11 of the deals were loan agreements.\n\nWith that, Neil\u2019s side \u2014 which was already missing goalkeeper Declan Rudd and commanding central defender Patrick Bauer owing to long-term injuries \u2014 lost a sense of itself.\n\nSeven of the next 11 matches ended in defeat. A loss at home to Luton Town last Saturday sent Preston down to 16th position in the Championship table. It was a result that leaves them nine points above the nearest team in the relegation zone, but Rotherham have four games in hand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeil is a manager in a permanent state of mixed furrowed expression who tends not to open up a great deal. Yet there was a startling admission after the Luton defeat.\n\n\u201cPeople talk about you knowing your best team and I used to get criticised for having my best team and playing it more often than people thought I should have done,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m being brutally honest at the moment, I haven\u2019t got a Scooby-Doo what my best team is.\u201d\n\nNever in their history had Preston sacked a manager this late in the season. Managers had left before in March but that had been of their own volition: 19 years ago, David Moyes joined Everton, and in 1986, with the team at the wrong end of the bottom of the Football League, Brian Kidd \u2014 who later became an assistant at both of the Manchester clubs \u2014 offered his resignation.\n\n\u201cWith your best team you know what you are getting from them week in, week out,\u201d Neil continued. \u201cWhat I get from one week to the next, God knows.\u201d\n\nIt sounded like Neil had lost control of Preston\u2019s future. The next morning, he was told his \u00a31 million a year contract was being terminated.\n\nIn November 2019, Preston were top of the Championship. Stoke City, meanwhile, may have been bottom but the promise of greater resources to play with, as well as a better contract, meant Neil rather fancied the opportunity to jump between clubs at the opposite ends of the table.\n\nIn the end, Preston reported Stoke to the EFL for making an alleged illegal approach and Neil stayed but in the meantime, Preston quietly went about assessing their options. Peter Ridsdale\u2019s official title is an advisor to the owner Trevor Hemmings but the day-to-day responsibilities are with him rather than the billionaire.\n\nAmong the club\u2019s considerations as Neil\u2019s potential replacement was Lee Bowyer, who would have made an interesting appointment given Ridsdale\u2019s connections with the then Charlton Athletic boss from their time together at Leeds United.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBowyer, of course, only recently departed Charlton for Birmingham City, so that rules him out as Neil\u2019s successor for now. The Athletic understands Preston have had more than 50 serious applications for a role that only received interest from five managers when Graham Westley was appointed in 2012.\n\nFor the time being, Neil\u2019s assistant Frankie McAvoy has been named as the interim head coach until the end of the season. McAvoy\u2019s title is a departure from Neil\u2019s, who was the firmly the manager. Although it has been suggested that Preston might look to hire a sporting director this summer and alter their structure, club sources have told The Athletic it is currently more likely that Ridsdale will work closely with another manager but without directly replacing Joe Savage, who was head of recruitment until he joined Hearts in December.\n\nMcAvoy, pictured in September 2018, has been named Preston\u2019s interim head coach (Photo: Chris Vaughan/CameraSport via Getty Images)\n\nSavage\u2019s responsibilities have partly been filled by the arrival this month of James Beet from Barnsley as a recruitment analyst. While this reinforces the influence of Ridsdale and any future manager, it also shows the club is embracing an approach driven by data.\n\nLike McAvoy, Savage had worked with Neil at Hamilton and Norwich City. In each of his jobs, Neil developed a reputation for making reasonable profits from cheaper signings and this had been possible to some degree because of Savage\u2019s judgment as well as his contacts.\n\nThe biggest sales at Preston during Neil\u2019s three-and-a-half-year spell in charge came from purchases that pre-dated his arrival but Savage was known within the North West as a tireless worker whose advice had previously helped Preston get more signings right than wrong.\n\nSavage, however, had wanted to leave Preston for almost a year. Hearts were offering him a promotion as sporting director and he will have more of a say on the Scottish club\u2019s entire transfer policy. At Preston, he was tasked with providing lists of players that the club could sign within its small budget. From there, it was the board\u2019s decision what happened next. Savage was not involved in negotiating any contracts or transfer fees \u2014 that fell with Ridsdale, who then presented Hemmings with the sign-offs.\n\nSavage had long thought that much of his work was going to waste. Inside Preston, there is some regret that Savage was given a title that suggested his role would encompass greater variety and heightened responsibility when perhaps chief scout would have been more befitting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe roadblocks in front of him at Preston, as well as his ambition, meant he did not want to be viewed any longer merely as a scout. Hearts also suited him because it allowed him to live closer to his wife and his young daughter, as well as his brother who is now recovering from treatment for a serious illness.\n\nSavage\u2019s exit nevertheless meant Preston entered their busiest period of transfer activity in years without one of the three primary elements of their recruitment department. Savage might not have been involved in the business end of deals but he did open doors to the agents who were significant figures in brokering them.\n\nThe contract situations of Davies, Pearson and Fisher meant Preston had to do something. Despite being owned by a billionaire, their economic world is a real one. The money from sales creates the revenues to replenish the squad. Had all three left in the summer for nothing, Preston would have effectively started a rebuild without the sort of funds that would allow them to target anything but free transfer signings.\n\nIt is believed that there was some urgency inside the club to start this process last summer but in the middle of a pandemic other clubs didn\u2019t consider it prudent to pay decent fees for players that would soon enough be available for nothing.\n\nNeil speaks to the media after Preston\u2019s 4-0 defeat at Cardiff in February (Photo: Nick Potts/PA Images via Getty Images)\n\nRidsdale and Neil\u2019s offices had been on the same corridor. They got on well and were regularly on the road together looking at potential signings. Figures at other clubs respect Ridsdale\u2019s worth ethic because he is always at games, making introductions. \u201cUsually the recruitment staff do the sort of donkey work, \u201d says one Football League manager, \u201cbut at Preston it seems to be a bit different.\u201d\n\nAn agent with extensive connections in the game has been impressed by Ridsdale as an operator: \u201cHe\u2019s very hands-on. Rarely will you speak to him about a player and he doesn\u2019t have a clue who he is.\u201d A source at Preston suggests the responsibilities that lie with Ridsdale are loosely defined; that Hemmings trusts him implicitly. \u201cMr Hemmings draws up the budget and each season it\u2019s up to Peter to manage it sensibly.\u201d\n\nAcross January and the earliest days of February, the pressure on Ridsdale and Neil was increasing. For other agents, Neil has always been the point of contact. \u201cEverything was going through the manager\u2026\u201d says one, while another suspects that the focus on coaching and matches sometimes got in the way of the most basic discussions. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t always great at getting back to you.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNeil was involved heavily in every decision,\u201d a club source confirms.\n\nFor a long time, Preston\u2019s wage budget has been one of the lowest in the division. \u201cYou certainly don\u2019t sign for Preston if you are after big money,\u201d says a former player. Yet the club has been attractive to players at unfashionable, overachieving League One teams as the next step. \u201cThere isn\u2019t the pressure of immediate success but the culture, as well as the facilities, are good,\u201d says a different agent.\n\nExcept, this time that immediate pressure was there. Ben Whiteman had been captain at Doncaster Rovers, pushing for promotion to the Championship, but he has not so far been able to replicate the form that got him a \u00a31.6 million move.\n\nBy the start of February Preston did not have their first-choice goalkeeper, their two best central defenders or a combative midfielder in Pearson who was a fans\u2019 favourite, although he too had missed chunks of the season already through injury. Untested players at Championship level were trying to prove themselves as worthy replacements midway through a campaign where the side was learning about itself all over again. Several players who had served the club for longer still had faith in Neil, with midfielder Ryan Ledson attaching the blame for Preston\u2019s slump on the players rather than the manager.\n\n\u201cI want him to stay,\u201d said Ledson last week. \u201cI know all the lads want him to stay; I feel sorry for him.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been good enough. He must be standing on the line thinking \u2018What more can I do?\u2019 He works so hard every day, he\u2019s in from seven in the morning and doesn\u2019t leave until five or six at night. And we\u2019ve let him down. I can\u2019t stress enough that it\u2019s been nowhere near good enough.\u201d\n\nThe words of a training ground source reinforce Ledson\u2019s view: \u201cAlex could not have worked any harder to put things right. There will always be one or two players who don\u2019t fancy a manager in any squad but generally, he was well respected.\u201d\n\nRidsdale liked Neil a lot on a personal level, but he is said to have asked himself whether he has been too patient over a 16-month period where the team\u2019s performances got worse and worse. Hemmings and his advisor are acutely aware of the stories from the Championship clubs that have struggled to bounce back following relegation \u2014 it is now Sunderland\u2019s third year in League One and Ipswich are facing the same prospect if they don\u2019t go up this season. Ultimately, they decided to remove Neil because the prospect of Preston joining them matters more than any decent working relationship.\n\nDeepdale is a modern football stadium that would not look out of place in the Premier League. It is owned by the club and the land on which it is located is under a 125-year lease from the local council. Meanwhile, Preston\u2019s new training ground in Euxton might have had two previous owners in Bolton Wanderers and Wigan Athletic but it has been described by the managers and players that have used it as \u201cstate of the art\u201d.\n\nPreston, however, have not been in English football\u2019s top flight since 1961. Some fans wonder whether Hemmings will have one last push at it because he will be 86 this year. An indication that he knows time is against him came in the summer of 2019 when he appointed his son Craig to the club\u2019s board.\n\nLater that year, he circulated a document to potential buyers which likened the club\u2019s potential to nearby Burnley, citing its value at around \u00a350 million. Preston were top of the Championship at the time but intermediaries have told The Athletic that the owner was merely testing the water, \u201cto see whether anyone nibbles \u2014 he certainly wasn\u2019t hellbent on selling up\u201d.\n\nHemmings bought Preston 11 years ago and has since run the club with the same sense of responsibility as the other businesses that generated his wealth, the richest of which are in the property sphere. Yet sources have told The Athletic that Hemmings accepts that football is unlike his other companies.\n\n\u201cHe realises that a profit does not matter if the team ends up getting relegated,\u201d says one. \u201cSome years, the accounts will look better than in other years because it\u2019s bloody hard continuing to sell your best players while putting a successful team out on the pitch. But he also believes in sustainability, which is always viewed over a longer period of time.\u201d\n\nHemmings with the Queen\u2019s granddaughter Zara Phillips at Cheltenham races in 2018 (Photo: Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images)\n\nIn February 2020, it was revealed that the 2018-19 season had been one of Preston\u2019s worst financially. The pre-tax loss of \u00a314.3 million was explained partly, however, by the rising cost of competing at a level that is the gateway to the Premier League. Their accounts were in keeping with the environment in which they were swimming.\n\nOnly a year before, clubs across the Championship had made an accumulative pre-tax loss of \u00a3307 million and some of them risked infringing league regulations. Preston later entered the red mainly because of a lack of player sales, with figures falling from \u00a39.7 million to just \u00a3149,000 in the space of a year. This underlines why it was so important to move Davies, Pearson and Fisher on more recently, even if they were for modest fees.\n\nIn October 2019, Ridsdale tried to increase the club\u2019s revenue streams \u2014 which were among the lowest in the Championship \u2014 by appointing a new head of commercial partnerships. The pandemic has since meant that Hemmings has had to cover shortfalls with several cash injections across 2020 and into 2021 although, because shares are issued each time, the money does not count as debt.\n\nThe Athletic understands the vast majority of Championship clubs have deferred payments to the Inland Revenue during the pandemic and there is pride at Deepdale that Preston are not one of them. Although one player has been in dispute with the club because of disciplinary matters and this has led to mediation from the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, Preston have met the rest of their contractual obligations in full during a period in which several of their rivals have also deferred wages to their squads or failed to pay players on time.\n\nIt says much about the landscape of football that the richest English owner in the North West is in charge of a club outside the Premier League. Hemmings might be above Sir Paul McCartney on the Sunday Times\u2019 Rich List but he is only the third most affluent English owner in the Championship, behind Stoke\u2019s Peter Coates and Bristol City\u2019s Steve Lansdown.\n\nPreston are one of the Football League\u2019s founding members and the original \u2018Invincibles\u2019, having gone the 1888-89 season unbeaten, but if Hemmings took them back to the promised land using his savings, he would still prop up the table in terms of his own wealth when judged against any of his new competitors.\n\nA long-serving former player who served Preston for many years says he only encountered Hemmings once. \u201cHe is quiet and unassuming,\u201d he says. \u201cHe keeps himself to himself even when he is at the club. You never saw him at the training ground.\u201d From his home in the Isle of Man, he lets Ridsdale do his thing. He is loyal to the people that are good to him and that creates continuity.\n\nDespite the team\u2019s form, there was some shock attached to Neil\u2019s departure because it was the first managerial sacking in just over eight years. While Neil had served for three and a half seasons, his predecessor Simon Grayson lasted four before choosing to leave for Sunderland.\n\nThere are not many owners of football clubs left with backgrounds like Hemmings, who has a black and white photograph in his study of himself as a young man in bricklaying uniform ready to go to work. He was born in London and can remember the sight of barrage balloons during the Blitz, where his family would lock themselves into Anderson shelters or take refuge in tube stations to escape the bombs. His uncle Paddy died. In 1940, Hemmings\u2019 father Monty uprooted the family and took a job at the Chorley Ordnance Factory near Preston.\n\nHemmings had three paper rounds and worked as a petrol pump attendant. He\u2019d carry groceries around on a horse and cart. After four years as a bricklayer, he started his first building business in 1960 with \u00a312 and it was sold 10 years later for \u00a31.5 million. He took over the holiday camp Pontins before selling it to Coral. There were pubs, hotels, casinos and Blackpool Tower. His primary interest in sport was racing and three of his horses have won the Grand National. Each morning, he has his breakfast wearing a cloth cap. In 2016, he told the Racing Post: \u201cIt stands for the working man in the North.\u201d\n\nAfter Hemmings\u2019 purchase of Preston in 2010, the appointment of Ridsdale raised eyebrows. Hemmings spoke to people at Barnsley, Cardiff City and Plymouth Argyle where Ridsdale worked after Leeds and liked most of the information coming back. When Ridsdale was disqualified from operating as a director of any company in 2012 following an inquiry by the Insolvency Service, Hemmings kept him on, albeit his name was no longer listed among the club\u2019s directors.\n\nFor nearly a decade, the relationship has worked. Twenty years ago, Ridsdale developed a reputation for being gung-ho but with Hemmings\u2019 caution, club insiders say they often meet somewhere in the middle, \u201cbut invariably somewhere closer to Trevor\u2019s way of thinking\u201d.\n\nIn 2017, Ridsdale said of Hemmings: \u201cOf all the businessmen I\u2019ve worked with in football, he is the best. All of the money he\u2019s put into this club has been his own. But what he doesn\u2019t do is misspend it. He wants to pay 50 pence for every pound. He wants value for money. It\u2019s the right way to be.\u201d\n\nFigures at rival Championship clubs say they\u2019d be surprised if Preston went down. The decision to let go of Neil, however, shows that Hemmings is willing to avoid that possibility at all reasonable costs. Ultimately, he has proven himself capable of being as ruthless as anyone else in his position when faced by the same threat.\n\nAdditional reporting: Jordan Campbell\n\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Tom Slator)"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59918634", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Championship\n\nScott Hogan is Birmingham's leading scorer this season with seven goals\n\nScott Hogan's late equaliser rescued a point for Birmingham to end Preston boss Ryan Lowe's winning league start.\n\nThe hosts took a deserved lead when Alan Browne drilled a low shot which Patrick Bauer got a touch to on its way into the bottom corner.\n\nPreston missed a host of chances to seal a third straight league win for Lowe, with Blues goalkeeper Neil Etheridge twice denying Ched Evans a second.\n\nAnd Hogan met a Ryan Woods cross at the near post to head in an equaliser just a few moments after coming off the bench.\n\nIt was just a third league game for Lowe since his appointment on 7 December after a string of Covid-related postponements, and his side were good value for their half-time lead.\n\nAndrew Hughes nodded Ben Whiteman's cross just wide, while Emil Riis headed a Greg Cunningham cross straight at Etheridge and then saw another blocked before the breakthrough.\n\nBlues had their best chances either side of the break as Gary Gardner volleyed over when found unmarked by Jeremie Bela's corner, before Jordan James' goalbound strike was deflected behind after he was teed up by Norwich loanee Onel Hernandez.\n\nThe Lilywhites threatened on the break as the visitors pushed for an equaliser and grabbed a point when Hogan struck with only City's fourth goal in their past 10 away trips.\n\nBoth sides went close in stoppage-time, Etheridge keeping out Bauer's header before Gardener steered a shot wide from six yards.\n\nPreston drop to 15th, while Birmingham are without a win in six matches and remain 18th.\n\nPreston boss Ryan Lowe told BBC Radio Lancashire:\n\n\"We are 60% of where I want us to be in terms of on a Saturday afternoon or Tuesday evening.\n\n\"Throughout the week, it's been fantastic with the build-up and the sessions we've been doing, but we've got to bring that to the party on a Saturday afternoon.\n\n\"We've had 15 penalty box entries in their half and seven shots maybe and seven shots blocked so you can see we're doing it.\n\n\"But it's that little clinical edge, that little more fine quality (is needed), and if you get that you'll score more goals.\"\n\nBirmingham manager Lee Bowyer told BBC Radio WM:\n\n\"I have to give the players full credit for keeping going and pushing to the end like that.

However, they have not won a major trophy since 1938.\n\nPreston North End are a professional football team based in Preston, Lancashire. They play in the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football. North End was founded in 1863 as a cricket club before switching to becoming a football club in 1880.\n\nThe Lilywhites were a founding member of the Football League in 1888. They were the first team to achieve the 'Double' in English soccer, as well as going unbeaten in all matches, becoming 'The Invincibles'.\n\nPreston play at Deepdale and have done since their inception, making the stadium football's oldest ground in terms of continuous use by a major league club.\n\nDuring their long history, North End have had some legendary players turn out for them. The list includes Tom Finney, Bill Shankly, Tommy Docherty, Alan Kelly Sr. and Graham Alexander.\n\nPreston North End early history\n\nBefore becoming a football team, North End were both a cricket and rugby club. The Lilywhites were one of the first professional clubs in England after hiring players from Scotland known as the Scotch Professors. In 1887, they beat Hyde 26-0 in the first round of the FA Cup, which remains an English first-class record to date.\n\nIn 1888, they were founding members of the Football League and in the first league season of 1888/89, Preston became the first league champions, as well as becoming the first team to win the league and FA Cup 'double'. They remain to date the only team that has gone through an entire season unbeaten in both the top flight and the FA Cup becoming 'The Invincibles'.\n\nPreston North End won the title again in 1889/90, but they have not won the title since. In 1938, Preston won the FA Cup with a team featuring Bill Shankly, Andy Beattie and George Mutch. It was Mutch who scored the winning goal in a 1-0 victory over Huddersfield Town to clinch the trophy.\n\nThe same year North End won the FA Cup, their most famous player, Tom Finney, joined the club as teenager but due to World War Two he did not make his debut until 1946. Nicknamed the 'Preston Plummer' (due to his business) Finney became the club's top goalscorer with 187 goals in 433 appearances. He also played 76 times for England, scoring 30 international goals.\n\nNorth End have not won a major trophy since 1938. They have come close numerous times, finishing runners-up in the FA Cup five times and runners-up in the top flight six times.\n\nPreston North end and late 20th century decline\n\nA year after Finney retired, PNE were relegated from the First Division, a league they have not played in since. Finney leaving marked a steady decline for the club.\n\nAfter the 1969/70 season, Preston North End were relegated once again. Although they bounced back immediately, the fabric of the club had already been significantly changed. Preston had gone from powerhouses of British football to a club which bounced between the divisions, never quite rising to the upper echelons of the Football League system.\n\nSince 1970, the Lilywhites have spent 28 of 49 seasons in the bottom two divisions of English football. In 1985/86, Preston finished 23rd in the Fourth Division and had to seek re-election into Football League structures. This was a new low for the club and a sign of an institution which had all but been stripped of its proud identity.\n\nDavid Moyes revival and modern era\n\nUnder John McGrath, Preston won promotion to the Third Division the following year, but they were back in the Fourth Division from 1993 to 1996. Preston had slightly better fortunes under the ownership of heating manufacturer Baxi from 1994 to 2002 than they had previously.\n\nUnder Baxi, Deepdale went under a massive change, being upgraded to a modern stadium. The new stadium was built in four parts with the last stand opening in 2008.\n\nAged 34, former central defender David Moyes switched from playing to management at Preston under the Baxi-controlled board, taking charge of the club in February 1998.\n\nMoyes gained promotion by winning the third tier championship in 2000. The following year, Preston made the play-off final in their bid for promotion to the Premier League. However, they were beaten by Bolton Wanderers.\n\nMoyes left for Everton in 2002 and Preston were stable in the Championship for some time until their relegation to League One in 2011. They were promoted once more via the play-offs in 2015 and have remained in the second tier of English football since then.\n\nIn May 2021, Preston appointed Frankie McAvoy as manager after a successful interim period at the end of the 2020/21 season.\n\nHe was replaced by former Plymouth manager Ryan Lowe in December 2021.\n\nPreston's fanbase\n\nOutside the Sir Tom Finney Stand at Deepdale is a statue of the man himself, which is a sign of the extent to which he is still revered at Preston North End among the fans. The statue was sculpted by Preston-born Peter Hodgkinson.\n\nPreston's stadium, Deepdale, can fit 23,404 supporters at present.\n\nPreston's rivalries\n\nPreston North End's fiercest rivalry is with Blackpool, a club which is in close proximity to them geographically.\n\nThere are also strong rivalries with the likes of Blackburn Rovers, Burnley, Bolton Wanderers and Wigan Athletic.\n\nPreston North End's finances\n\nBritish billionaire businessman Trevor Hemmings held a controlling stake at Preston North End since 2010 until his death in October 2021.\n\nHis son Craig took over ownership and has publicy stated that they are open to selling the club.\n\nPreston posted losses of over \u00c2\u00a316m for the year 2022, an increase of \u00c2\u00a31.4m on the previous year, mainly due to compensation paid to Plymouth for Ryan Lowe and residual payments to a number of players at the end of their contracts."}, {"url":

at Wembley.\n\nWhen Dave Seddon and I went through our team, some of it seemed pretty self explanatory but we also felt that we wanted to give a better explanation of why we chose who did, in a bigger space than we were afforded in the picture based format we used.\n\nSo, I'm going to go through the team one by one and explain why them, and why not somebody else.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nIf you missed the team itself, it's here.Firstly, it's worth prefacing that generally, we judged players on what they did this decade for PNE, so players like Graham Alexander and David Nugent who had their best years in the 'noughties' were discounted.\n\nGoalkeeper\n\nWhen it came to goalkeepers we felt there were only really three options.\n\nThere was the eventual choice of Jordan Pickford, Declan Rudd and Andrew Lonergan to consider, all who have done very good jobs in PR1.\n\nLonergan only really played six months with North End and Rudd could have also been a choice to be in the team.\n\nIn the end, we had to go with Pickford.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nEven in his short spell at the club, he was generally a class above, he was kicking with pinpoint accuracy on either foot, had a commanding presence about him in his area and was still only 21.\n\nHe was an international just a year after leaving Deepdale and was recalled initially by Sam Allardyce, going swiftly into the Sunderland first team in the Premier League.\n\nHonourable Mentions: Declan Rudd, Andrew Lonergan.\n\nDefence\n\nSome of these choices were no-brainers, Tom Clarke is right back having been with the club throughout most of the decade and captaining the club to promotion at Wembley.\n\nHe put the ball in the Blackpool net and has been very reliable wherever he has played, he's a massive presence in the changing room and is as tough as they come.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nPaul Huntington alongside him can share many of the compliments, he's been a commanding presence at the hear of the PNE back line for the last eight years.\n\n'The Cumbrian Cannavaro' is beloved by North End fans as is the skipper, with 15 years combined service, they were always going to be selected.\n\nAlongside 'Hunts' is Ben Davies, the first choice that has come on pure quality.\n\nThough he hasn't been in the side too long, in his third season, he is arguably the best central defender we have seen at Deepdale in quite some time.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nHis is never over-awed by the situation, is extremely calm and composed on the ball and can't be bullied either.\n\nFew defenders are a complete package but with Davies' pace, technical ability, reading of a game and willingness to get stuck in, he's very close.\n\nHim being left footed is a nice bonus too.\n\nLastly, at left back is Greg Cunningham, who was a smart pick up on a free transfer from Bristol City.\n\nCunningham quickly established himself on the left side of North End's back line and was a big miss when he was ever unavailable.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nHe would offer an attacking outlet down the left but was also reliable in defence, he was a big part, alongside Clarke and Huntington, in establishing PNE back in the Championship before moving to Cardiff for \u00a34m last summer.\n\nHonourable Mentions: Darnell Fisher, Sean St Ledger, Bailey Wright, Scott Laird.\n\nMidfield\n\nI'm going to start with the most controversial pick, Tom Barkhuizen on the right side of midfield.\n\nWe fully understand the want for Aiden McGeady to be in the side, and this was the position we had the most discussion on, but we felt Barkhuizen just edged him.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nThis was more my pick than Dave's, but I went off stats a little bit as well as how long he's been doing it now.\n\nMcGeady was sensational in his season in Preston, one of very few players in memory that had the ability to create something form absolutely nothing and win or change a game in a moment.\n\nTom Barkhuizen joined the club and was an instant and surprise hit, winning both Championship player of the month and goal of the month in his first six months, scoring six and setting up three in 17 games as he stepped up from League Two.\n\nHe's been the go-to man for managers since his arrival for his diligence in defence, and then for his blistering pace.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nIf his run recently at home to Barnsley didn't show it, he can be unplayable at time - with an eye for the spectacular like his goal against Blackburn Rovers.\n\nThe midfield pair is as predictable as it comes but they simply have to be in there: Paul Gallagher and Ben Pearson.\n\n'Gally' seems timeless, having initially joined on loan in League One, he's played wide in midfield and has settled into his 'quarterback' role in Alex Neil's side.\n\nHis ability to pick passes is sorely missed when he's not involved and he often ranks very highly for key passes, especially in the opposition half.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nThen comes the set pieces, a sensational delivery, Gallagher has turned games on their head over the past seven years, either from crosses or direct free kicks. Not to mention his trademark penalties.\n\nAnother leader in this side, alongside Tom Clarke and Paul Huntington, Gallagher will go down as a PNE legend.\n\nNext to the grace of Gallagher is the industry of Ben Pearson.\n\nSimilar to Ben Davies, he's one the best we've seen at Deepdale for some time; the industry is not in favour of quality on the ball, far from it.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nPearson has shown time and time again that he is capable of controlling games, he puts out fires in front of the back line, is deceptively quick and never over complicates.\n\nHe's a perfect foil to Gallagher, collecting the ball and supplying his partner to make the incisions.\n\nHis disciplinary record aside, which has improved a lot of late, there's barely been a drawback to his game since his emergence following a 2-0 win over Aston Villa at Deepdale.\n\nOn the left is Callum Robinson, the most recent player to depart, leaving to the Premier League for \u00a37m to Sheffield United.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nProbably the player to have developed the most whilst at Deepdale, he had his critics at times but proved all of them wrong and was a key player for PNE just prior to his move.\n\nAble to play all the way across the front line, Robinson spent half of the decade at Preston and scored 12 times, despite missing months, in his final campaign.\n\nHe had progressed to be one of the best forwards int he division and capable of making something out of nothing with his tireless work ethic, shown in the opening goal against Ipswich Town back in April.\n\n\u200bHonourable Mentions: Aiden Mcgeady, John Welsh.\n\nStrikers\n\nAnother area of the pitch where there could only really be two choices.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nJoe Garner and Jermaine Beckford's goal scoring exploits will long be remembered as the pair helped fire PNE up from League One, breaking the play-off curse, and into the Championship.\n\nJordan Hugill was another possible inclusion and he did deliver in the Championship for PNE, that Beckford and Garner could not, but the form of the pair we chose just couldn't be ignored.\n\nJoe Garner was signed from Watford and took a little while to get going, but once he did, he really did.\n\nGarner hit 24 and 27 goals in all competitions as Preston reached the play-off semi final and the final, winning player of the year in League One in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nHis celebration in winning a corner at Wembley still gets replayed now and alongside him on the day, and taking most of the headlines, was Beckford.\n\nSimply a brilliant January loan signing, banging in 18 goals in just 31 games including that treble under the arch.\n\nGarner's volley in the play-off semi final will be many peoples favourite goal, but Beckford's 40-yarder against Chesterfield to seal North End's place at Wembley will run it close.\n\nIt was a pair that worked perfectly and massively contributed to getting PNE to where they are now."}, {"url": "https://www.lancs.live/sport/football/football-news/how-preston-north-end-sold-24130507", "page_content": "It's a Wednesday night in October and Ryan Lowe is sat in the stands at a ram-packed Deepdale, laying low, watching his beloved Liverpool progress through the EFL Cup - though it hadn't been easy for them.

We'll get this full...\" were his words. That hadn't been achieved for some time in these parts, and yet there was not a hint of doubt about North End's new boss.

He won on Gentry Day.\n\nThere was a fight and pride about Preston North End against Liverpool on that October evening, something which hadn't been seen anywhere near enough at the time. Lowe has brought a pride and passion back among the terraces and 10,500 season cards sold as of June 2nd is some going. With a couple of months until the new campaign starts, PNE have stormed past the typical final figure of seven-to-eight thousand.\n\nHow have they done it? Firstly, the early bird offer for the forthcoming season has proven to be a masterstroke. It's something that supporters have asked for in recent years and for whatever reason, North End never went through with it. This manager and \u00a312 per match was always going to be a recipe for success.\n\nThe season card promotion video featuring the voice of Preston's own Andrew Flintoff was magnificent. There are new members of staff on board now, who Lowe has clearly been instrumental in bringing to the football club. The Community department is thriving. And while there are no new signings just yet, the noises around summer recruitment are all positive. All those factors have made this new era at Deepdale one that people want to be a part of.\n\nThen, you come to supporters giving up their own time, to hand out thousands of season card leaflets. North End fans, out on foot, chipping in, doing their bit for the good of their club. That is what PNE is all about. One supporter named Chris spent four hours delivering 400 leaflets around Clayton Brook; another called Steve touched in with local businesses in Freckleton, as well as posting through letterboxes in St Anne's. One North End supporter was chased down the road by a Blackpool fan; another saw a Seasiders fan rip one down in a supermarket state of fury.\n\nJohn, from PNE Online, delivered 2000 leaflets across Wyre. It was a street in Garstang where he recalls a Bloomfield Road season ticket holder sprinting after him: \"What's the hell is this? What's this about?' he shouted. 'It's marketing' I replied, to which he responded 'well you certainly need it'. I reminded him of the score in April; always nice to wind them up a little.\"\n\nAnother season ticket holder, Tom, had \"That's my car!\" screamed at him by a Burnley fan, who was not appreciative of this particular post given the Clarets badge on the rear window of his vehicle. It was moments of humour like that which made the experience of posting 300 leaflets in the Chorley and Coppull region - all with the help of an excited son of three-years old.\n\nThere was a recent thread on Twitter, where the distance travelled on match day by season card holders became a topic of discussion - prompted by one fan. The engagement was terrific and we did a little bit more digging into the stories of those who travel far and wide.\n\nAyden, who is in his early twenties, had to move down to London around 10 years ago with his family. The price helped him massively this year and allowed him to buy his own season card for the second time, so it'll be train up from Euston at 10:30am, a few hours in the Vic and pre-match chat with whichever fans are in ahead of the game. It's a pie and pint for 15 minutes before kick-off and a train home in time to catch EFL highlights on TV.\n\nStephen was a ball boy up until the age of 14 and then kept his season ticket when he moved away to University. He's down in the capital too but will either make the four-hour drive, or park-up at Milton Keynes station and get a two-and-a-half-hour train up to Preston. \"Despite us having no goalkeeper as I write this, I just have a feeling that something special could happen next season, which I don't want to miss,\" he told LancsLive. \"Don't get me wrong, the early bird pricing and lots of derby matches help, but I am optimistic Ryan Lowe can get me feeling as I did during the peak Billy Davies and Alex Neil seasons.\"\n\nElsewhere, Dom has lived in South Shields his whole life and travels from Newcastle station at 8am, before changing at Carlisle and getting into Preston. It's a 11pm arrival home but, having been first taken on as a nine-year-old by his Grandad, wouldn't have it any other way. Jon has lived in Lincoln all his life and fell in love with PNE in August, 200, when he went away to Grimsby Town with the Lilywhites - back then, as a groundhopper. He relocated to London for work in 2004 and is now in his third year as a season ticket holder, which entails a train trip from Kent at 9am and arriving home over 12 hours later. His two young children love the journey and getting something to eat in town before kick-off.\n\nWork in London and Devon means that Ed also travels up via the Tube and Euston after leaving his house at half-eight in the morning. He's used to the long travel, having held a season ticket for 10 years while living in Newcastle previously. \"Due to midweek games mainly, it was costing me more money than I\u2019d save,\" he told LancsLive. \"Add in the 2-3 games a season that were moved and the extra cost just wasn\u2019t viable. I haven\u2019t had a season ticket for about six seasons now, always doing about 10 away games and 6/7 home games. This season, with the price, atmosphere at the club and optimism, I\u2019ve gone for it again.\"\n\nDownload the LancsLive app for free on iPhone here and Android here .\n\nDon't miss a thing from the club you love!

For those who have followed the team for longer, Alan Kelly Snr was of course chosen.\n\nBut Nash was quite the player and rightly got his fair share of praise, despite the sour nature of his exit. A colossus of a figure on the goal line, he wore the gloves 94 times for the Lilywhites and featured in play-off campaigns of 2005 and 2006. In 05/06, he played every league game.\n\nNash joined from Middlesbrough in the prime years of his goalkeeping career, at 31-years-old, and kept a remarkable 41 clean sheets - with PNE winning 42 of the games he spent in net.\n\nGranted Nash was 33 when he moved on, but how on earth did a player of that quality go on to only make a further 14 professional appearances after leaving Deepdale?\n\nHis departure was an ugly one, with the 6ft 5\" man-mountain suddenly desperate to jump ship after two-and-a-half outstanding years on an individual note - and not half-bad ones on a collective either.\n\nHe played 31 times for PNE in the first half of the 2006/07 campaign - a season in which North End would go on to finish 7th under Paul Simpson, after the back-to-back top six finishes under Billy Davies. The Lilywhites ended up missing out on the play-offs, but they weren't a million miles away and in fact sat third in the table when Nash's transfer request came in.\n\nInterest from Fulham, who were in the top flight, turned Nash' head with the goalie saying at the time: \"I want to play in the Premiership again, I'm 33 and I'm not getting any younger.\n\n\"Preston are third in the Championship and flying high, but there are still no guarantees we are going to get promoted. I just see this as a great opportunity for me and a good thing financially for the club as well. It's been a real struggle for me over the last six months or so being separated from my family.\n\n\"I hope the clubs can sort something out.\"\n\nManager Simpson fell out with the number 22 and told the press: \"It is very disappointing that I have to deal with disruptions like the situation with Carlo Nash that surfaced today.\n\n\"Carlo has once again chosen to air his views publicly, so I would like to set the record straight. Up until recently Carlo, and his advisor, were trying to negotiate a two-year extension to his contract to stay at Preston - and at no time were there any concerns raised about wanting to be with his family during our negotiations.\"\n\nPrivate lives of footballers are often left unconsidered and nobody could argue with a player missing his fianc\u00e9e, but the mixed-messages at the time, the clear success of the team again, the popularity of Nash, but his lack of belief over anything, all left fans with a feeling of resentment.\n\nNash wanted to move to the Cottagers, who were plotting a \u00a3500k move for a player North End were said to have paid under \u00a3200k for in 2005. In the end, he moved 20 miles down the road to Wigan, whom he joined on an emergency one-month loan in February 2007 and then permanently in the summer for \u00a3300k. Nash played one game for the Premier League club in over two years.\n\nDuring his time with the Latics, he was loaned out to Stoke City - then of the Championship - in March 2008. Nash's time there is as good as it got after life at PNE, as he played his part in the final 10 games of the season to help the Potters on their way to promotion to the Premier League.\n\nNash would be back at Stoke in 2010, but only after one-year with his boyhood club Everton - whom he played one game for, in a Europa League group match against BATE Borisov.\n\n\"It was good during my time at Everton because I felt like we had a degree of success, not with trophies, but we were in Europe and got to the FA Cup final,\" Nash told the Liverpool ECHO last year. \"Even the surrealness of the whole thing, it was fantastic.\n\n\"We had just moved to Finch Farm and they were the best training facilities I ever had as a player throughout my career. It was the excitement of all that and having the facilities to do everything right and to enjoy training, it was a massive pull.\"\n\nThat sounds like a character who had got to the point where game time wasn't the priority, but Nash argued against that.\n\nHe added: \"Wherever I've been, I've always wanted to play, and it has kind of annoyed me throughout my career that you get fans and people who don't really know that much about the real game say I was happy to sit on the bench. That was never the case.\n\n\"I always wanted to play and I always believed I was good enough to play wherever I went. I think that motivation drove me on. It's not an easy position, being a number two, and it is a lot harder than being a number one in certain respects.\n\n\"When I was second-fiddle, I always played under a very good goalkeeper.\"\n\nAfter Merseyside, it was then back to the Potteries for three years, with Nash adding one Stoke appearance in that time and then moving to Norwich - where he didn't play - for the final season of his playing career.\n\nRetirement in 2014 saw him move into the coaching world and he was Oldham's goalkeeping coach up until 2018, before moving to Salford City - where he remains - to carry out the same role.\n\nHindsight is a wonderful yet wicked thing and nobody truly knows whether Nash would've been able to help North End reach a third successive play-off campaign.\n\nNash left PR1 to better his career and personal life, but things would never be as good on the pitch as they were during his days at Deepdale. And North End ever since have been striving to match the levels, instill the same hope in the fans, and get as close as the fantastic squad that Nash was a key part of managed to."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64332378", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Preston\n\nRyan Lowe took over at Preston North End after Frankie McAvoy's sacking in December 2021\n\nPreston North End made a loss after tax of \u00a316.8m for the year 2021-22, up from a \u00a315.4m loss from the previous financial year.\n\nThe increase was due to payments to an ex manager as well as players at the end of their contracts, the club said.\n\nIn addition, the club owed compensation to Plymouth Argyle after recruiting manager Ryan Lowe in December 2021.\n\nClub owner Trevor Hemmings also died during the 2021-22 season, with son Craig Hemmings taking over as chairman.\n\n\"The season 2021-22 was a difficult one for a number of reasons,\" Hemmings said.\n\n\"It was the first full season back with crowds into Deepdale following all of the Covid-19 restrictions, and, as was felt across the whole of the football pyramid, we experienced the nervousness of some fans returning to stadiums.\n\n\"In the first half of the season we changed managers, as results on the pitch were just not good enough.

If Rangers' surrender of a two-goal lead to draw with Hearts on Saturday handed fresh impetus to Celtic, a worse fate seemed destined to befall Gordon Strachan's team here.\n\nHaving led through Scott McDonald's goal, the visitors found themselves trailing after Francisco Sandaza's double strike. The equaliser arrived from an unlikely source, Lee Naylor volleying home nine minutes from time.\n\n\"It was a terrific game,\" said Strachan. \"Anyone who finds a negative from that must be warped. We weren't professional at the start of the second half and paid the price but I always thought the equaliser would come \u2013 we created enough chances.\"\n\nCeltic's lead over their great rivals remains at three points, then, with nine matches left.

It was however a transfer which was not originally met with universal approval from the Bhoys support.\n\nNaylor had spent all his career at Wolves and following soon after the dismal failure of Mo Camera, a free transfer from Burnley, the Celtic support were not pleased at the club looking once more towards the English Championship in their bid to solve the problematic left-back position.\n\nFor his part, Naylor was delighted to have secured a move to Parkhead, and his enthusiasm and obvious joy at joining Celtic was evident in his early interviews as well as his performances on the pitch. Indeed within weeks of arriving, Naylor had won over most of the Celtic support with his energetic and tenacious play.\n\nAn over-lapping full back, Naylor was an asset in both attack and defence. Eager to get forward and get a cross into the box, Naylor also ensured he didn\u2019t neglect his primary role and worked hard in curtailing opposition attacks. Although his performances dipped by the end of that season he had done enough to be nominated as a candidate for the SPFA Player of the Year Award 2006/07.\n\nCracks had however began to appear in his play and as the new season began, Naylor appeared to be a different player from the one that impressed during his first six months at the club. His distribution was dire, good opportunities were squandered by over-hit crosses and misplaced passes. Defensively he was often caught out of position and looked uncomfortable when players ran at him with the ball\n\nLess than a year after giving hope that Celtic\u2019s search for a quality left-back could be over, it appeared that Naylor, like many before him, was not the answer. He did however retain a regular starting spot \u2013 scoring his first goal in a vital win over Hibs (s cracker of a goal he scored v Hibs was to everyone\u2019s surprise but more than deserving of all the plaudits that came his way after it) \u2013 as Celtic dramatically battled back to claim the 2007/08 championship and their third title in a row.\n\nSeason 2008/09 saw Celtic surrender their grip on the league title and once more Naylor\u2019s performances were frequently criticised by the support. A seemingly likeable character off the pitch, Naylor, despite his obvious failings on the park, he never gave anything less than his all in the Hoops but the fact remained that the left-back slot remained a significant weakness within the Celtic team.\n\nThe arrival in July 2009 of the highly rated Danny Fox from Coventry \u2013 ironically another Championship team \u2013 appeared to spell the end of Naylor\u2019s days as the first choice left-back at Parkhead. Naylor made a number of cameo appearances filling in for Fox when the ex-Sky Blues man was injured.\n\nWhen Danny Fox surprisingly exited Parkhead prematurely in the January transfer window, Bhoys boss Tony Mowbrary underlined his reluctance to use Naylor by bringing in Dutch internationalist Edson Braafheid on loan from Bayern Munich. The Dutchman disappointed, and following the departure of Mowbray the interim Celtic manager Neil Lennon recalled Naylor to the starting line-up. Patience from Naylor had paid off.\n\nTo Lee Naylor\u2019s credit he came good, and to the surprise of most he played a strong part and put the Dutch internationalist in the shade (where notably Braafheid later played in the World Cup final at the end of the season). Admittedly no stunning performances, but he still managed to hit the jackpot and grab a goal against Rangers in the final league derby match in May 2010. Something that he will prize. It may have been a deflection from his free-kick but it was still one more goal than Danny Fox scored this season from free-kicks (and Danny Fox was meant to be a free-kick specialist). Naylor had caught the eye of sections of the support and all were happy for him.\n\nHowever, with a new manager to come, the squad had to be refreshed and Lee Naylor had been in and out for the last couple of seasons.

But the bad news seeped out late last night. Yes, Lee Naylor has left Celtic Football Club. There will be no more pointless, headless runs down the wing and those in the bottom tier can rest easy that attempt crosses will never threaten their bovrils again.\n\nHe can leave with his head held high.

Either bow to player pressure and let some of their top stars depart, leaving them open to outrage from supporters had they then failed to win the league, or keep them at Celtic against their will, and put the house on men who were anything but all in for the cause.\n\nIn the end, they went with the latter course of action, knowing they would have been crucified had they allowed the likes of Odsonne Edouard or Kristoffer Ajer to jump ship if their hopes of making history were sunk. In the end, a resurgent Rangers torpedoed their hopes in any case, with Celtic\u2019s ragtag bunch unsurprisingly lacking the stomach for the fight.\n\nFor Lee Naylor, the former Celtic full-back who has now become an agent, alarm bells were already ringing in the early part of last summer. Not only was he hearing of the unrest in the dressing room, he was concerned over the recruitment process, having pitched potential signings and been rebuffed not by former teammate Neil Lennon, but by head of football operations Nicky Hammond.\n\nFor Naylor, the 10 in-a-row dream didn\u2019t die during Celtic\u2019s winter of discontent, but right there and then.\n\n\u201cThe only positive is now knowing who to get rid of,\u201d Naylor told the Celtic Huddle Podcast. \u201cOn the pitch there\u2019s nothing much they can take but at least now they can rebuild. They\u2019ll know who wants to be at Celtic and they can clear out those who don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThe signs were there at the start of the season. When you have that many people who are wanting to leave, subconsciously you can\u2019t do it on the pitch.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s interest in that many players, the time was right to make change then. We tried to keep hold of too many players to get 10 in a row and it ended up hurting us.\n\n\u201cAs a club you should be preparing for the future. Celtic have always had two or three coming though from the youth ranks and putting their foot in the deep water with the first time.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d then have three or four signings in the summer coming on to strengthen the side.\n\n\u201cYou can cope with one or to wanting to leave and you can get through the season.\n\n\u201cBut when you have five or six who want out the door, there\u2019s no way you can recover.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, players coming in have been well below par, so you are always heading for a downfall.\u201d\n\nNaylor could scarcely believe what he was seeing both the park from Celtic this term, with the team showing none of the characteristics he associates with the successful Celtic sides of the past.\n\n\u201cYou need players that can step in at any time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had that but it\u2019s not seemed that way this season and they\u2019ve paid the price.\n\n\u201cWhen we played we had an urgency about us. I remember [Gordon] Strachan showing us a video of when we lost the ball while attacking. He paused it half way through and asked us, what\u2019s going on here?\n\n\u201cHe had every player on the pitch sprinting back \u2013 that was the fear of Celtic losing.\u201d\n\nOff the park, it has been a similar story, with Naylor disappointed to see supporters protesting outside Celtic Park and calling for former teammate Neil Lennon\u2019s sacking back in December of last year.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the Celtic I know,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see fans gathering outside the club in so much disappointment.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t nice to see. I obviously don\u2019t condone bad behaviour or violence, but that was the real low point for me.\u201d\n\nNaylor is hoping though that a fresh start can revive Celtic\u2019s fortunes next term, and if Eddie Howe is indeed the man to come in, he has tipped him to re-establish that identity which has been lost along the way during the last nine tumultuous months.\n\nBut he has warned that just as Celtic will need to adapt to suit the demands of their new manager, so must he to suit the demands of the club.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good young manager,\u201d he said. \u201cHe won\u2019t be used to what it takes to be a manager in Glasgow because you need to win every single game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll bring identity to the club again on the pitch in the way we play.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been needing that for a while.

Photograph: Stephen Pond/PA\n\nRangers strengthened their hold on the Scottish Premier League after Kevin Thomson's first-half strike gave the leaders an Old Firm win at Ibrox to take them six points clear of Celtic at the top of the division and still with a game in hand.\n\nThomson scored out of the blue when he started and finished a fantastic move at the end of a scrappy first half and thereafter Celtic never really created enough clear-cut opportunities to get back into the match. Scott Brown had earlier missed a presentable opportunity for the visitors when his close-range shot was saved by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and he subsequently hit the post from an improbable angle but, with the interval approaching, Thomson hared into the Celtic penalty area, worked a superb one-two with Jean-Claude Darcheville, and slotted past Celtic goalkeeper Artur Boruc to bring the home fans to their feet.\n\nAlthough Rangers welcomed back Barry Ferguson, Allan McGregor, Christian Dailly and Lee McCulloch, all of whom missed Scotland's friendly against Croatia on Wednesday night, they struggled to press home their advantage against a determined Celtic lineup, which manager Gordon Strachan decided to deploy without striker Scott McDonald in favour of an untried starting strike partnership of Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and Georgios Samaras.\n\nThe huge punt aimed towards Vennegoor of Hesselink straight from kick-off indicated how the visitors were set to play \u2013 his clumsy foul on Weir setting the tone for the opening exchanges. A frantic, disjointed and mostly aerial battle ensued with the ball seeing little of the grass as it sped from corner to corner and end to end. Amid the early chaos, Vennegoor of Hesselink stabbed an Aiden McGeady cross past the near post after six minutes and, a minute later, McCulloch came close at the other end when he climbed high at the back post to head Thomson's free-kick just wide of Boruc's left-hand post.\n\nBrown missed a chance to break the deadlock when he glided on to a clever chip from Samaras deep inside the Rangers penalty area, but the ball would not sit up well enough for the former Hibernian midfielder to allow good contact on his shot, allowing McGregor to save comfortably. It was all getting messy with Vennegoor of Hesselink, Thomson and Dailly picking up yellow cards before Brown struck the outside of McGregor's post from an acute angle. With half-time looming Thomson was rewarded for his initiative when he set off on an incisive run, received Darcheville's return pass and calmly dispatched it right-footed past Boruc.\n\nWithin three minutes of the re-start Nakamura picked out Vennegoor of Hesselink with a pinpoint free-kick but again McGregor saved with ease. Lee Naylor's booking for dissent in the 57th minute \u2013 which took the yellow card tally to five \u2013 was more evidence that the tide had turned in the Ibrox side's favour but there was little to keep either goalkeeper occupied.\n\nCeltic gradually pushed forward with increasing confidence, earning several corners and putting the hosts on the back foot for prolonged periods. In the 64th minute Andreas Hinkel was denied by McGregor after he cut inside and unleashed a ferocious 30-yard drive which McGregor tipped wide with a full-stretch dive to his left.\n\nCeltic were growing increasingly frustrated as the prospect of slipping to their fourth consecutive Old Firm defeat and, worse still, almost certainly relinquishing their title to their dreaded rivals, and both McManus and Naylor were fortunate not to see a second yellow card as referee Stuart McDougal showed some leniency.\n\nAs the game became more fraught substitute Steven Naismith found his way into McDougal's notebook, while Thomson, the goalscorer, was stretchered off after falling awkwardly after being challenged on the edge of the penalty area. As the clock ticked down Celtic resorted to hopeful long punts into the Rangers penalty area in the hope of a lucky break but it was Rangers who came closest to scoring in the dying seconds, Boruc tipping Charlie Adam's powerful effort over the bar after a delightful defence-splitting pass by Nacho Novo.\n\nThe honours went to Rangers, who must now be strong favourites to wrest the title away from Celtic even if there are still two more Old Firm derbies before the end of the season.\n\nRangers 1-0 Celtic\n\nBy David Sharp\n\nKevin Thomson celebrates scoring for Rangers\n\nThe outstanding Kevin Thomson scored the crucial winning goal\n\nKevin Thomson picked an opportune moment to score his first goal for Rangers as they went six points clear of Celtic at the top of the SPL.\n\nCeltic settled first and Scott Brown squandered two superb chances when his control deserted him in the box.\n\nOn 44 minutes, Thomson played a clever one-two with Jean-Claude Darcheville before tucking the ball under Artur Boruc to give the home side the lead.\n\nAllan McGregor made a terrific save from Andreas Hinkel's goal-bound drive.\n\nMcGregor, Barry Ferguson, Christian Dailly and Lee McCulloch all returned from injury after missing Scotland's friendly against Croatia in midweek.\n\nFrenchman Jean-Claude Darcheville made his Old Firm debut as the lone striker.\n\nBut his striking counterpart Scott McDonald was left on the bench by Celtic manager Gordon Strachan, with Georgios Samaras partnering Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink up front.\n\nStraight from kick-off, Boruc launched a huge punt aimed at the head of Vennegoor of Hesselink as Celtic indicated how they were set to play.\n\nIt was a typically frantic, disjointed and mostly aerial battle from the start, with both sides engaging in an extended game of heady tennis.\n\nVennegoor of Hesselink failed to connect with Aiden McGeady's menacing cross, while McCulloch flashed a header just wide at the other end.\n\nCeltic were enjoying marginally the better of the early possession without posing any real threat until Samaras threaded a neat ball into the path of Brown in the Rangers box.\n\nThe midfielder found himself clean through on McGregor.\n\nBut, as he attempted to shoot, the ball got caught under his feet and the Rangers goalkeeper did well to scramble the ball away.\n\nBrown ghosted in at the Rangers back-post after 32 minutes, latching on to Samaras' weak header, but he was again thwarted by McGregor.\n\nRangers were dangerous on the counter-attack and created a flurry of chances in the space of the four minutes approaching half-time.\n\nFirst, Carlos Cuellar had a header cleared off the line then Ferguson's snap-shot from 12 yards was saved by Boruc.\n\nA quick Celtic break saw Brown in space inside the Rangers box, but again his touch let him down and Rangers punished the mistake, countering at speed.\n\nThe impressive Thomson gathered the ball on the edge of the Celtic penalty area and ran towards goal.\n\nHe prodded the ball through to Jean-Claude Darcheville, who timed his return pass to perfection.\n\nThomson ran on to it and swept the ball low under Boruc for a classy finish.\n\nThe Ibrox side were spraying the ball about with confidence after the break as Celtic struggled to get possession.\n\nBut Hinkel brought out an athletic save from McGregor after 64 minutes when he unleashed a rising left-foot shot from 25 yards.\n\nMcGregor leapt to tip the ball over the bar to retain Rangers slender advantage.\n\nRangers substitute Nacho Novo twice broke clear in the final 10 minutes, but Boruc was equal to his rifled efforts.\n\nCharlie Adam should have put the match beyond Celtic with minutes to go but his shot lacked conviction and Boruc again saved easily.\n\nRangers: McGregor, Broadfoot, Cuellar, Weir, Whittaker, Dailly, Thomson (Adam 77), Davis (Naismith 80), Ferguson, McCulloch, Darcheville (Novo 68).\n\nSubs Not Used: Alexander, Boyd,

Rangers again this year but the Celtic left-back isn't lying awake at night worrying about the fact he isn't.\n\nNot when he knows he's got the best view in the stadium every week of the young man he believes should be the Player of the Year going about his business.\n\nNaylor plays directly behind Aiden McGeady and can only watch in wonder at the tricks, flicks and finally the end product he has added to his game this season in the shape of eight goals and far more assists.\n\nThe Englishman believes the Scots-born Irishman can help Celtic overcome the four-point deficit on Rangers, starting tonight against Inverness Caledonian Thistle where a victory will be vital if their rivals slip up at Tynecastle.\n\nFormer Wolves defender Naylor insists Celtic aren't feeling the pressure of trailing in the title race but concedes while neutrals might be delighted it is not the one-horse canter it was last term he would rather it was.\n\nHe said: \"I would have preferred if the league table was the same as last year. I'm sure as a spectacle it is good to watch but as a player you want it to be more easy going. We just go into every game knowing we need to win.\n\n\"As it is playing out it looks like it is going to come down to the Old Firm games.We have two of them at home, which is to our advantage.\n\n\"I would prefer it was over well before the end of the season but we have to overcome the situation we are in and hopefully when it comes to it we can rise to the challenge.\n\n\"I wouldn't say I am feeling pressure. I am enjoying the challenge not feeling pressure. I can't see any strain on any of the boys, apart from wanting to go out and win games. It is just the usual pressure of playing for Celtic. We have to win games, it is as simple as that.\"\n\nNaylor believes Celtic will come from behind to win the title because they have attacking players he reckons can pierce any defence in the country.\n\nHe added: \"I have always had a belief since I joined Celtic that we are going to win games. No matter how long is gone I have a belief, and the team has a belief, we are going to win every game.\n\n\"It is a good habit to have and it is brilliant going into matches feeling like that.\n\n\"Confidence is high. We have a top scorer who is flying in the league (Scott McDonald) and we have our player of the year, Aiden McGeady, who is in incredible form so far.\"\n\nMore of McGeady later but before Walsall-born Naylor got on to the winger's wonderful season he paid tribute to a striker who has divided the Celtic support but who he reckons deserves as many plaudits as McDonald has received for his goalscoring exploits.\n\nHe said: \"For me Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink is top, top drawer. He is just as important as anybody else in the team.\n\n\"He has provided Scott with a lot of the ball, flick-ons and the runs he makes. They work together and their partnership is credit to both their goals.\"\n\nMany of which have been created by McGeady, a player he believes is destined for one of the big four in the Premiership at some point in his career. But Naylor hopes that will be later rather than sooner.\n\nHe added: \"Being selfish, I hope he stays here. If he keeps doing the things he is doing he is going to have big teams looking at him. That is what is happening.\n\n\"I don't think anybody could sway him away from Celtic apart from one of the big four down south.\n\n\"It might be his personal choice to go to Spain but I think he should stay at Celtic although the Premiership would suit him better than Spain. That is my view.\n\n\"Aiden is something else. He has gone up a notch this season.\n\n\"He has been top drawer and worked hard at his game and is reaping the rewards. He is scoring goals and creating them and that is all credit to him.\n\n\"He is up there with the top players in the Champions League. He is direct and I think he has become even more direct this season and that hurts defenders.\n\n\"There is nothing worse than somebody always running at you and with the pace he has it can be one of the most frightening things.\n\n\"He has found out how to hurt people and now does it.\n\n\"I tend to stay away from him in training. When you do come up against him you think please don't go running down that line.\n\n\"He has been brilliant this season. I can't say enough about him.\"\n\nMcGeady has added a work ethic to his game, tracking back to lend Naylor a hand when needed.\n\nBut the left-back prefers to see the winger's back as he hurtles away from him to create problems at the other end of the park. He said: \"I like to leave him to what he does best. That is running, attacking and taking on defenders.\n\n\"It is good when he tracks back and helps me but we have a relationship where I let him go and do what he does best and I try to give him all the confidence in the world. I don't think I can give him any more than he already has.\""}, {"url": "https://www.67hailhail.com/news/ex-celtic-man-lee-naylor-was-left-stunned-by-november-protests/", "page_content": "Ex-Celtic man Lee Naylor was left stunned by November protests\n\nBy Euan Davidson May 18, 2021\n\nThere was a point this season where Celtic managed just one win in 11 games. In all competitions, the Bhoys were floundering. Protest filled the winter air, as fans congregated [Herald] outside Paradise on two occasions.\n\nIt was an unusual sight. Admittedly, small protests against the board, via tifos and literature had become commonplace. However, an actual revolt was a sight to behold. In a decade of dominance, there were still rumblings of discontent, but this was mutiny.\n\nAnd it was quite reasonable. This season was utterly dismal, and we\u2019ll be counting the cost of the board\u2019s inaction for a while yet. Even if normal service resumes in 21-22, the scars of this campaign will take a while to heal. If, that is, they heal at all.\n\nReflecting on this season, Lee Naylor joined Mark Wilson and Simon Donnelly for a chat on the Celtic Huddle Podcast. What\u2019s more, he didn\u2019t hold back when talking about the failures of 20-21.\n\nSpeaking about the awful form and the protests outside Paradise, Naylor said [Celtic Huddle Podcast]:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not Celtic. That\u2019s not the Celtic I know, anyways. I never thought in my time that I\u2019d see Celtic fans gathering outside the club, in that much disappointment.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t nice to see, obviously I don\u2019t condone bad behaviour and violence, but that was the lowest point for me, to see that.\n\nAsked about whether there were any positives to this season, Naylor curtly replied:\n\n\u201cKnowing who to get rid of.\n\n\u201cAt least now you can rebuild, and rebuild to know who wants to be at Celtic. Clear out who wants to be there and who doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n\nLee Naylor doesn\u2019t hold back, but nor should he: Celtic let supporters down this season\n\nEssentially, just so he isn\u2019t misconstrued, what Naylor is saying is that he didn\u2019t expect fans to be so disappointed by the club, that they\u2019d (rightly) protest. Just so we\u2019re on the same page.\n\nIt\u2019s clear Naylor took a lot from being at Celtic. Across the whole podcast, the former Wolves man drops \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d throughout. Signed by Gordon Strachan in 2006, Naylor was shortlisted for the Player of the Year honours in 2007 [BBC].\n\nOver 4 years and 100 appearances, Naylor established himself as Strachan\u2019s first-choice left-back, before his contract expired in 2010.\n\nAnd, on this evidence, he\u2019s clearly hurt by what the supporters have been through this season. Clearly, he counts himself in that number."}]}
