We'll get to see what that still-developing Middle-earth landscape looks like, and so far, it looks pretty great.

While the storylines and character performances do an incredible job at drawing viewers in, the technical aspects are also some of the best on television. The visual effects, production design, and artwork help establish Middle Earth\u2019s epicness, and illustrator/concept artist John Howe is a big part of creating the sweeping scale of that story.\n\nWe sat down with Howe at Dragon Con 2022 and discussed his work on the new Amazon series, The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings films, and more. Check it out below.\n\nYou have such a cool job. Can you give an overview of what you do?\n\nJohn Howe: A concept artist is a person who is there to help the showrunners or the director, the art director, and the whole team to visualize the universe in which they\u2019re going to have to live and work for the duration of a project. So that\u2019s the basic answer.\n\nIt\u2019s all about establishing a form of parallel credibility in order for the public to be able to suspend disbelief the time that they are watching and let themselves go and just go with whatever is proposed. And it\u2019s very exciting. It\u2019s sound and vision.\n\nWalk me through your introduction to Lord the Rings initially. How did you become a fan before working on the properties?\n\nJohn Howe: I started with the wrong book. Because I was in my teens, or I think I was 12 or so, and I couldn\u2019t buy the books. So, I\u2019d got them from the local library, and the Fellowship of the Ring was never on the shelf. And I waited and waited and waited, and I got impatient. And so I read The Two Towers.\n\nSmart, wasn\u2019t it? And then The Return of the King made no sense. And I finally read The Fellowship of the Ring. So, I ruined my first pass through Middle Earth. But I did go back and read them in the right order later on. But it was a very adolescent reading because I can only recall the battles and the extraordinary landscapes. However, after that, I\u2019ve gone back to read them properly.\n\nIt is a landscape that rolls itself out in front of you. And that sums up precisely the job that I try to do. I have a pedestrian approach because I like to start from a ways off and draw what I see and then I\u2019ll walk a bit closer and draw what I see. And eventually, you end up in the city or the place that you\u2019re headed for. And that gives me the time to actually understand where I\u2019m going.\n\nIt\u2019s very much like a pilgrimage. If you imagine you\u2019re going to, and you can see it from afar, but you can\u2019t quite make it out. Every step brings you a clearer revision of it. And the only difference is that you\u2019re making it up as you go on.\n\nPhoto Credit: John Howe / Prime Video\n\nWith the artwork, have you found inspiration specifically in New Zealand, like specific locations? Where should LOTR fans go to see what has inspired what they see on screen?\n\nJohn Howe: I mean, I can confess to a great vulnerability when faced with the landscape. Because every time, it makes my heart either want to explode or collapse when I see something that I could not have imagined myself but is simply there in front of me. And that happened endless times in New Zealand, part of the most beautiful landscapes in the world, I believe. It\u2019s concentrated, very concentrated.\n\nAnd I think the most moving part of that is with The Rings of Power, we are finally on the ocean. We\u2019re finally on the coast, and the New Zealand coastline is one of the most beautiful in the world. I spent a lot of time hiking along beaches in Middle Earth. And I have parts of the world, which, for me, are very intimately associated with portions of Middle Earth. And to give you an example, I can\u2019t use the Canadian Rockies that I know very well for anything in Middle Earth.\n\nThey don\u2019t work for me. Other mountain chains do work. There are coastlines and landscapes, which for me, say Middle Earth. And it\u2019s a mix of real places that I know, and this mythological superposition of Tolkien on top of the New Zealand landscape suddenly enhances the landscape itself.\n\nAnd so, of course, you can take the movie tour and see all those places. But I think you could also imagine, let\u2019s go somewhere in Middle Earth that I want to discover and leave your mind open to that simple beauty. It\u2019s beautiful because it doesn\u2019t need us. It makes us disappear. And to stand anywhere on the edge of anything means that you are somewhere. What you can see is where you can\u2019t go. And to me, those are the most poetic and beautiful places in the world. And they are literally everywhere. So, they are the embodiment of the nature of inspiration to me. You don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to come out of the woods and suddenly bite you. And it happens all the time.\n\nI use a lot of Swiss landscapes because I live in Switzerland. But I\u2019ve pulled from a number of different travels I\u2019ve had the opportunity to do. Suddenly something will say to me, oh, there you go. That\u2019s perfect. There is your reference. So, it\u2019s something I cannot, I refuse, to analyze, and I could not define, but that is how inspiration is supposed to work.\n\nNew Zealand is one of these sunset countries, one of these early morning countries. And when I was living in Wellington and Auckland, I used to get up before dawn, sometimes on the weekend. I\u2019d already have a spot I picked, and I go up and wait for the sun to come up. And you think this is literally the dawn of the world. It happens every day. It\u2019s there if we just make an effort to get up and see it. And it\u2019s a reminder that we are very small in a very beautiful and amazing universe. It\u2019s extraordinary because it\u2019s simply something that\u2019s a part of what makes us human. I get all kinds of worked up when I think about it. But these are the simple things, and they are truly extraordinary in a landscape like New Zealand\u2019s.\n\nFor Rings of Power specifically, what was the most challenging part of your job on this project?\n\nJohn Howe: I think part of the challenge was the fact that this is not a universe we had never visited, and it doesn\u2019t entirely belong to anyone. It belongs to everyone. The expectations are very high to go back into the universe and offer new ideas and new things you\u2019re aware of. People already know what things look like or believe they do. So, it\u2019s quite complex. It\u2019s a real challenge to try and find those sources of inspiration once again. This inspiration which has brought us close to the text in the past. And then to come back out of that with a visual interpretation. And we\u2019re in the same world, but it\u2019s different.\n\nSo, in that sense, it\u2019s quite a challenge because inevitably, you fall back on what you\u2019ve done and what you know. And that\u2019s the greatest danger. And for me, as we said, I\u2019m delighted it\u2019s finally come out because all of the work I did was a long time ago, and I\u2019m already thinking well past season one into season two.\n\nTo see the actual project come to fruition with the work of literally thousands of people and the dedication that they all share, to me, I think it\u2019s wonderful. So, I can watch, but I think, for all visual artists, there is this LA time lapse between the work you do and when it appears. And you\u2019re already thinking past that, years ahead.\n\nI often have books that come out. And I\u2019m like, oh yeah. Oh, that book, oh yeah. I remember working on that, and it was eight months ago, and I hadn\u2019t forgotten. But I moved on along to other things.\n\nBut we are very aware that for the population in the world, this is new. We\u2019re hoping that this series will accompany them back into Middle Earth. Not only in Middle Earth that they know and love, but a Middle Earth they have yet to meet.\n\nBe sure to catch The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power on Amazon Prime Video!

Tolkien as well as working on both The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film series. Most recently he has worked as a concept artist for The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power television series. [1]\n\nJohn Howe was born in Vancouver, Canada.[2] He graduated from the \u00c9cole des Arts D\u00e8coratifs of Strasbourg[2] in 1981, having obtained a Diploma in Illustration.[3] He now lives in Neuchatel with his wife Fataneh and his son Dana.[2]\n\nHowe first read The Lord of the Rings in high school, borrowing them from his school library. He started with The Two Towers, because \"everyone who started the first volume never got any further\" and The Fellowship of the Ring was rarely available to borrow.[4] He was inspired by artwork from The Brothers Hildebrandt to start creating illustration of Tolkien's works.[4]\n\nHowe's version of Boromir is based on his own face.[5]\n\nInvolvement in Peter Jackson's Middle-earth film series [ edit | edit source ]\n\nJohn Howe and Alan Lee worked as the chief conceptual designers on The Lord of the Rings trilogy.[6] Howe is also credited as a carpenter in the first two films.[6] [7] He has a cameo as one of the nine Kings of Men in the Prologue of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Howe and Lee returned to work as conceptual designers for The Hobbit film series. They both make an uncredited appearance as a men-musicians of Laketown in The Desolation of Smaug.[8]\n\nArtwork theft [ edit | edit source ]\n\nIn the night of 18 May 1997, 11 of Howe's originals were stolen from the M\u00e9diath\u00e8que of Sedan in Belgium. The thief's father contacted the M\u00e9diath\u00e8que a couple weeks later promising to try to retrieve the stolen works from his son. 8 originals were finally returned, one (Minas Tirith) was damaged beyond repair. \u00c9owyn and the Nazg\u00fbl, Gandalf the Grey, and The Uruk-hai were never recovered.[9]\n\nPublished Artwork [ edit | edit source ]\n\nHowe is one of HarperCollins' most used artists, and his cover art is frequently featured on translations as well.\n\nMultiple editions [ edit | edit source ]\n\nCalendars and books [ edit | edit source ]\n\n\"Illustrating Tolkien means treading warily, dipping one's brush in shadow and rinsing them in light.

It's almost even more fun to have a location imposed upon you, because you really have to get down to brass tacks and figure it out, imagine it on paper.

Instead we have to rely on the brilliant work of artists to render these fantastic worlds for us. One hugely important figure in the fantasy art world is the artist John Howe. With a much-loved body of work and perhaps best known for his concept art work on The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film series, Howe's career is marked with an array of interesting experiences that have resulted in some truly astonishing fantasy art pieces.\n\nImage source\n\n\"Illustration is a proposition, a spontaneous exploration not only of the theme to hand, but also the deeper currents that make imagery necessary.\"\n\nHowe was born isbut educated in France, and after completing his degree in Strasbourg he then went on to study at the\n\nWhilst grateful for the opportunity to study at excellent schools, Howe concedes that his understanding was at odds with his limited language ability. Regardless, he was always drawing. After learning to sketch with his mother's help, a young Howe quickly grew frustrated by what he considered to be his limited ability. He had always endeavoured to be better and had seemingly harnessed this impulse to constantly improve his illustrations. After being muscled out of over-booked art classes in school, Howe instead found ways to apply his artistic talents in other places. In biology class he would draw images of microscopic creatures \u2013 renderings that his classmates struggled with \u2013 and would give these drawings to them, for a small fee that is. However, now because of his success, fifty cents for an original John Howe is a steal!\n\nThat said, Howe says that anything that was not passed on to others is not likely to have survived up to today. Constantly looking to improve his sketches, he says that he would go over them so many times that eventually there would be nothing left at all, forcing him to start something new. Howe paints a picture of a boy who feels pressure and concern that he is not good enough to succeed. One form of solace Howe did find, however, was in books. Most notably was his reading of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings series, a work that would have a profound influence on the rest of his life and career.\n\nHowe has a confession regarding these titles though. Due to The Fellowship of the Ring being constantly checked out of the library, he instead opted to skip it and start with the perennially available The Two Towers instead. He naturally followed that with The Return of the King, before finally circling back and reading the first instalment last.\n\nHe admits this may not have been the best choice but makes it clear that he has since re-read the series, this time in the correct sequence. This was probably essential, especially since his appointment (alongside Alan Lee) as a concept artist for Peter Jackson's film trilogy.\n\nThis is Howe's most high-profile appointment to date, allowing him to work on a fictional world he had been enamoured with since boyhood. When the production for The Hobbit film trilogy began, Howe was once again brought on board to detail Tolkien's Middle Earth.\n\nHe has also worked on other big series, such as the movie adaptation of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; a limited edition cover for George R. R. Martin's A Clash of Kings; as well as illustrations for the hugely popular card game Magic: The Gathering.\n\nBut like any artist, Howe should not be reduced simply to his work on pre-established franchises. Drawing from a wide range of influences across world mythology, Howe has steadily built up an impressive portfolio of images. His work has involved interpreting tales from classics such as Beowulf, as well as creating jaw-dropping worlds built purely from his powerful imagination. Click here to browse all 2478 images in his online portfolio.\n\nA recurring point of interest for Howe has always been dragons. Appearing across a wide selection of canons and subject to a vast array of interpretation, dragon art is something that Howe has long expressed a love for.\n\n\"They span the spectrum from devilry to divinity, from blackest evil to boundless good. They come in all configurations, they speak or they make our minds reel with the power of their thoughts, they squat athwart hoards of treasure untold. They are story. They are dragons.\"\n\n\n\nWe were over the moon when Howe agreed to write the foreword for our book Dragon Art. Covering the appearance of dragons through the course of time and how their representation differs across cultures, there is no better expert to speak on the subject than Howe. Building upon his stellar introduction we were able to craft a book packed with curated images of the highest quality, depicting all sorts of incredible dragon images. Available in print or as an iBook, we're proud to have made a book that Howe himself approves of.

Zhang, founder and CEO of NFT art consultancy Concept Art House, started his career as a concept artist at LucasArts, the studio behind the Star Wars video games.\n\nConcept Art House launched 14 years ago with a mandate to provide art to video game companies, and in that time the company has helped ship over 1,000 games, Zhang said. But in 2021, the company honed its focus to exclusively serve customers building web3 video games as Zhang kept identifying opportunities at that very intersection.\n\n\u201cOver the last two years, we have had a total pivot into web3, and there\u2019s kind of no looking back,\u201d Zhang said.\n\nConcept Art House has worked with both creative brands looking to build a presence through web3 video gaming and crypto-native companies that lack experience in gaming and art creation, according to Zhang. The company has worked on projects with NFT giant Dapper Labs, the company behind NBA Top Shot, and comic book creator Frank Miller, best known for writing and illustrating \u201cThe Dark Knight Returns.\u201d Last October, it raised $25 million from investors, including Animoca Brands, and from angels such as Axie Infinity creator Jeff \u2018Jiho\u2019 Zirlin.\n\nBut despite Concept\u2019s initial wins in web3, the crypto bear market has hit NFTs particularly hard in the past few months, making its work much more difficult. Zhang said crypto winter has had three main effects on his business \u2014 first, that low token prices have caused people to be more careful about what NFTs they buy; second, that venture funding has to last longer; and third, that new token launches are no longer a major catalyst for growth in the NFT space.\n\nOne of Zhang\u2019s main areas of focus these days is on helping artists monetize their skills within web3.\n\n\u201cWe want to create a really powerful artists\u2019 network that can credential and identify who an artist is and what they\u2019ve worked on in web2 and web3. So instead of creating one [piece of] IP, we want to create a platform that\u2019s really friendly for artists in web3,\u201d Zhang said.\n\nCompensation for the artists behind NFTs has been a controversial topic, with artists such as Seneca, who illustrated the images in the Bored Ape Yacht Club project, speaking up about not being compensated in a lucrative way.\n\nZhang sees both sides of the issue, saying artists in general are both \u201cunderpaid, and they\u2019re paid what they\u2019re currently worth\u201d based on market value. He thinks artists have some agency to improve how they\u2019re compensated and sees web3 as a tool that can help them in that process.\n\n\u201cThe artists who are more financially savvy, who understand community, have more power. They need less agents, less middlemen. That\u2019s kind of the promise of blockchain,\u201d Zhang said.\n\n\u201cI think in the future, you will see this fork for most professional artists \u2014 do you want to try to understand finances more, your role in it, your role in the community, your role in technology and contribute as a highly skilled artist? Or do you want to just paint and draw really well?\u201d\n\nYou can listen to the full episode to hear more of Zhang\u2019s thoughts on how artists can position their skill sets in web3, as well as how he thinks about intellectual property and ownership issues in the NFT world."}]}
