Originally the St. Louis native enrolled in Princeton University to become a lawyer. In her junior year, Shelton signed up for a \u201chands on summer film course at NYU, where she quickly discovered her passion for directing. While at NYU, Shelton received the Willard T.C.

Kelly and Mary J. Blige, along with episodes of The Flash, 30 Rock, Ballers, Scandal, Black-ish, and several other TV shows. But she doesn\u2019t have a single body of work that\u2019s her favorite.\n\n\u201cI see fault in everything I direct,\u201d Shelton explains. \u201cWhen I don\u2019t, then I will retire.\u201d\n\nA few do stand out, including American Crime, The Flash, Black-ish, and Men of a Certain Age. One of the highlights of Shelton\u2019s career was being the first African-American woman to earn a Primetime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series with 2009\u2019s 30 Rock episode \u201cApollo, Apollo.\u201d The plot revolved around Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) turning 50 and featured the Muppets and Adam West.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still bummed that I didn\u2019t win! I honestly don\u2019t think about being one of the few African-American female directors while I\u2019m on-set. I think it would be too depressing. I focus on the job and the craft. I want to be the best director possible \u2014 period,\u201d Shelton says. \u201cIt was an honor to be nominated but very sobering to realize that I was the first one and it was 2009! One day, I plan to win that damn Emmy.\u201d\n\nShelton with Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson on the set of Ballers. Courtesy Millicent Shelton\n\n\u201cWhen I returned to Princeton, [Sitney] taught me almost everything I know to this day about film theory,\u201d Shelton says.\n\nHer first job in the film industry was as a wardrobe production assistant on 1989\u2019s Do the Right Thing, written and directed by Spike Lee, who was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nWorking on the film was a transformative experience. Shelton slept on the floor of her sister\u2019s Brooklyn brownstone and worked for nothing until earning a promotion to production assistant (\u201ca very small paycheck, but it at least put food in my mouth,\u201d she says). \u201cI had never been on a film set before or with \u2018real\u2019 actors. It was amazing to see Ossie Davis transform into Da Mayor as he walked down the street to the set,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI learned so much \u2014 and it was the hottest summer in New York City!\u201d\n\nAfterward, Shelton co-wrote a script with music producer Hurby Azor for hip-hop duo Kid \u2019n Play. Although it was never completed, the project led to her directing the videos for two Salt-n-Pepa songs, \u201cExpressions\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About Sex.\u201d She eventually founded her own production company and directed almost 100 music videos.\n\nShelton wrote and directed the 1998 comedy feature Ride. However, the script was changed in pre-production without her knowledge, souring her experience on the project and disillusioning her with the film industry. Actor Dean Cain \u201988, a friend and classmate, encouraged her to try directing television.\n\nSince then, she\u2019s directed more than 60 TV episodes, spanning drama, comedy, and action. \u201cI think the knowledge of all three has made me a better director,\u201d she says. \u201cI can bring heart to a comedy, momentary lightness to a drama, and both to an action show. It keeps everything fresh for me.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.awardsdaily.com/2022/09/12/end-of-the-road-director-millicent-shelton-on-working-with-queen-latifah-and-the-importance-of-inclusion-in-storytelling/", "page_content": "Millicent Shelton started her career as a wardrobe production assistant on Spike Lee\u2019s 1989 classic Do the Right Thing. That opportunity served as a springboard to a directing career of her own across music videos, television, and film. Her direction of the 30 Rock episode \u201cApollo, Apollo\u201d would make her the first Black woman to receive an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series.\n\nWith Netflix\u2019s End of the Road (currently streaming), Shelton again works with star and producer Queen Latifah. In the film, Latifah plays Brenda, a recently widowed mother who loses her home in Los Angeles. After deciding to move home to Houston, Brenda travels across the Southwest with her brother (Ludacris) and two children (Mychala Lee, Shaun Dixon). On the journey, they run afoul of a major crime boss thanks to a bag of money that holds the potential to change their lives. The film asks viewers to experience the world through the eyes of this troubled Black family as they hold together in the face of traumatic danger.\n\nHere, in an interview with Awards Daily, Millicent Shelton talks about what drew her to the project and what it\u2019s like to work with Queen Latifah both in front of and behind the camera. She talks about the film\u2019s vivid color palate and the joyous luck in finding four actors who held so much natural chemistry together. Finally, she talks about the importance of inclusivity and the recent conversation around two major television series \u2014 HBO\u2019s House of the Dragon and Amazon Studio\u2019s The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power \u2014 who cast Black actors in major roles within the series.\n\nAwards Daily: I\u2019d like to start with recent controversies related to specific audiences rejecting inclusive efforts on such major projects as Rings of Power and House of the Dragon. How do you as a filmmaker react to that in a modern filmmaking environment? Does it make you even more determined to pursue inclusive projects?\n\nMillicent Shelton: It does. I tend to be a little bit of a rebel. I like to push against what people perceive as the norm. So the perception we have had in television and cinematically has been very Caucasian. Not only are white Americans used to that, but so are Black Americans or Asian Americans or Latino Americans. That\u2019s how a lot of body dysmorphia happens to Black girls and Latino girls and Asian girls. They don\u2019t see people like them represented as images of beauty. There\u2019s a movement now to change that.\n\nI honestly think that\u2019s what our country fought for \u2014 to have representation and freedom. If we\u2019re going to truly embrace what we say this country is about which is about embracing diversity and about the melting pot, then we should embrace that in front of and behind the camera as well. I honestly believe that we are stronger when we are like that. To me, diversity is not making an all Black film, not that I\u2019m against that. I think diversity is a mix of everybody, and it\u2019s not just different colors. It\u2019s also different religions. It\u2019s different sexual preferences. It\u2019s diversity of all, and that\u2019s what makes us as a country stronger because we get to experience a lot of different people\u2019s perspectives. I think that our creativity is better that way.\n\nIn this film, we had a mix of everyone in all key positions. We really functioned that way. I like to say that we were a crew that went through a lot of strenuous situations. We survived it as a team, and we survived it as a family. We were a very diverse family, but we survived it as a family.\n\nAD: So you have a Brazilian production designer and an Asian American cinematographer. The film has a very international visual flair. The roadside motel, in particular, doesn\u2019t look like any I\u2019ve ever seen. In fact, the entire color palate for the film is incredibly vibrant and bursting with deep, vivid colors.\n\nMS: [The motel room] is my Brazilian production designer. It\u2019s interesting because we kept looking for motel rooms, and we could not find them. They\u2019re all too little. So we decided to build it, but we had seen a reference for this one in a motel that doesn\u2019t exist anymore. It had cherubs on the wall, and that was it \u2014 Lucio\u2019s [Seixas, production designer] brain started to go. Our whole vision for this film was exaggerated reality. I wanted to push it outside of the realm of just playing on normal. So the idea of making these rooms a little over the top I embraced. We embraced the color too because we wanted extreme colors. That was kind of tough because we were shooting in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and a lot of the buildings there are beige. So, we found a gas station with a lot of color and a motel with a lot of color. Then, we added the neon tubes all around. Some people are freaked out by the color palette in this movie, but as an artist, I think sometimes we should push the boundaries of what people find to be regular.\n\nAD: The film offers this theme of the lack of connectivity, that lack of civilization, where the characters are left to their wits that have been dulled by modern technology. What was it about End of the Road that attracted you as a director?\n\nMS: What originally attracted me was the opportunity to work with Queen Latifah again. We\u2019ve sort of known each other from music videos in New York for a while, worked together on Star, and then the opportunity to work with her again\u2026 I just love working with her. Since this movie, we\u2019ve worked together on an episode of Equalizer. She\u2019s a wonderful talent. I read the script because she was attached to it. When I read it, I could relate to this woman who was reeling from the loss. The family was torn apart and found their way back to each other. From adversity, the family actually becomes stronger, and I could relate to that story. I wanted to tell that story, particularly about a Black family but it\u2019s not a story that\u2019s unique to a Black family. However, what they face going through these desolate areas with the racism that happens, both covert and overt, is something that Black people experience in the United States whether anybody wants to admit it or not. That\u2019s something that\u2019s our reality, and I wanted to be able to show that.\n\nAD: As you\u2019ve mentioned, you have worked with Queen Latifah multiple times. What was it like working with her as both an actress and as a producer on this film?\n\nMS: She functions primarily as an actress. She doesn\u2019t throw the weight of the producer title on you. She comes in with a pure heart, and she really is in the state of mind of an actress. When we got into post-production, then she went into producer mode and was really helpful in supporting me through getting this film done. So, it actually worked really well. But as an actress, she shows up prepared, and she\u2019s willing to get feedback. She\u2019s willing to give feedback, which I think is great. I love to get feedback from actors because I really admire what actors bring to the table as they bring a different sensibility than even the writers or the director brings because they live through the spirit of a character. When I hear what their thoughts are about the words and what\u2019s happening to that character, I really take that to heart. I find that it makes all the scenes better.\n\nAll the times in the movie where she makes reference to her dead husband, that\u2019s all Latifah. I lost my mother a month before we went into prep on this movie, and so I was reeling from that loss. She said, \u2018You know, when you lose somebody, you talk to them. They stay with you.\u2019 And so we talked about it. We picked moments in the film when Brenda would say something to her husband. That\u2019s how those moments came alive. That\u2019s all from the actor having a thought about the spirit of the character.\n\nAD: The film rises on those moments of that core family group. How did you work with those four actors to build that incredible chemistry that really comes across on screen?\n\nMS: The chemistry actually was there naturally. It\u2019s interesting. Queen Latifah actually recommended Ludacris for the role of Reggie. After the first time I talked to him, I was like he\u2019s Reggie. He\u2019s not really Reggie in real life, but when we were talking about it, he understood Reggie. The next person that we cast was Mikayla, who plays the daughter, and she just stood out amongst everybody. She\u2019s a wonderful actress. I just actually got to work with her again on a couple of episodes of Truth Be Told for Apple. We did a lot of chemistry test reads with her and the potentials for the brother, and Shawn read and it was just immediately chemistry. You just saw brother and sister. They went at it. They were ad libbing, and they just went at it. It was just like another brother and sister. Then, we had a cast dinner a few nights before the first day of shooting. It was just those four characters, and we had a really lovely long dinner. We just were all talking about our lives and our dreams and kind of where we came from. They started to bond as a family, and the rest was just magic. They really felt like a real family. They had nicknames for each other and everything.\n\nAD: Last question for you: let\u2019s say you have the keys to the kingdom. You\u2019ve worked in television, you\u2019ve worked in streaming, you\u2019ve worked in film, and you\u2019ve worked in music videos. You\u2019ve done a little bit of everything. If there were no barriers and budget wasn\u2019t a concern, then what would be your dream project?\n\nMS: I have a dream project right now I want to do. I want to do a limited series about Josephine Baker starring Ruth Negga. That\u2019s what I want to do.\n\nEnd of the Road is now streaming exclusively on Netflix."}, {"url": "https://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/millicent-shelton/credits/3030583558/", "page_content": "Join or Sign In\n\nSign in to customize your TV listings\n\nContinue with Facebook\n\nContinue with email\n\nBy joining TV Guide, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy."}, {"url": "https://www.zimbio.com/Millicent+Shelton", "page_content": "Overview\n\nFind the latest news, pictures, and opinions about Millicent Shelton.\n\n\n\nMillicent Shelton is a mother, writer, and musician whose husband is a journalist and has done a podcast about her life.\n\n\n\nShe spoke to us about her life with her husband (both musicians), relationships, and the future of music and writing....\n\nBorn: St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.\n\nOccupation: Film director, music video director and television director\n\nYears active: 1989\u2013present\n\nThis content is based on data from multiple web sources.

I was completely surprised to learn that you're the first Black woman to get a nod in this category.\n\nMILLICENT SHELTON: I was surprised too! I was told that pretty early on and I thought that can't be the truth, there has to be somebody else. I had a lot of people do some fact checking; the Director's Guild and the Academy checked then confirmed the news. It's a dilemma on how to feel about being the first one because although it's a great honor, at the same time it's depressing and sad that it took until 2009 for an African-American female to be nominated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nESSENCE.COM: Is there not enough of us in these roles, what's the deal?\n\nSHELTON: Yeah, there's a small pool of women in these positions.

I think the reason why I've been able to do what I do is because I stick my head in the sand and move forward. I always believed my mother who said I could do whatever I wanted as long as I believed and worked hard enough. It's a naivet\u00e9 that works on my behalf.
