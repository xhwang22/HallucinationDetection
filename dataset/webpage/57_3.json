Those dreams became reality in 2012 when she got as close as she could get to advancing to the 100m breaststroke final in London, losing a swim-off for the eighth spot in the final to Jamaica\u2019s Alia Atkinson. Van Beilen also competed in the 200m breaststroke after winning the event at the Canadian Trials, knocking world record holder Annamay Pierse off the Canadian Olympic team in the process. Van Beilen had competed at the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010, winning three medals including gold in the 100m breaststroke. Her multi-sport competition experience includes the 2011 and 2013 Universiades, where she won a pair of silver medals in her first appearance. Van Beilen made her FINA World Championship debut in 2013. She has been part of four straight CIS championship teams with the UBC Thunderbirds.\n\nGETTING TO KNOW\u2026\n\nFamily: Parents Harry and Sharon Van Beilen\u2026 Older brother Nathan\u2026 Younger sister Marya\u2026 Uncle Wayne Van Dorp is a former NHL player\u2026 Cousin Joel Reinders is a CFL offensive lineman\u2026 Getting into the Sport: Learned to swim at age 5 in the backyard pool because she was a chubby child\u2026 Started swimming competitively at age 9\u2026 Was disqualified from her first meet for moving her toes\u2026 Outside Interests: Kinesiology major at the University of British Columbia\u2026 Enjoys baking and cooking\u2026 Played piano for 10 years\u2026 Odds and Ends: Nicknames: Teddy, TVB\u2026 Athlete ambassador for KidSport\u2026 Collects magnets during her travels\u2026 Favourite motto: Do my best, let God do the rest\u2026 Likes to eat yogurt-covered raisings before competing\u2026 Has a maple leaf tattoo on her toe, making it the last thing she sees before diving off the blocks\u2026\n\nINTERNATIONAL RESULTS\n\nFINA World Championships: 2013 \u2013 28th (100m breaststroke), 21st (200m breaststroke)\n\nYouth Olympic Games: 2010 \u2013 GOLD (100m breaststroke), SILVER (200m breaststroke), BRONZE (4x100m freestyle relay), 4th (4x100m medley relay)\n\nPan Pacific Championships: 2014 \u2013 12th (100m breaststroke), 12th (200m breaststroke)\n\nCommonwealth Games: 2014 \u2013 6th (100m breaststroke), 9th (200m breaststroke), BRONZE (4x100m medley relay)"}, {"url": "https://www.ubyssey.ca/sports/tera-van-beilen-swim-queen/", "page_content": "A young girl walks across the deck of a pool in Oakville, Ontario. She\u2019s eight years old, in that chubby phase every kid goes through, swimming her first novice swim practice ever without any goggles. When she finishes, the first thing she says to her mum, after asking to get some goggles, is when the next swim practice is. All it took was one swim practice to get her hooked, and she hasn\u2019t looked back since.\n\nTera Van Beilen is an unbreakable force in the pool. In a solid 15-year career, she\u2019s made waves in the world of competitive swimming. She has been a part of four CIS championship teams with the UBC Thunderbirds, participated in the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010 and won a pair of silvers at the 2011 and 2013 Universiades. Most notably, she qualified for her first Olympic Games in 2012 in the 100m and 200m breaststroke events.\n\nBut after 15 years of furious training and competing, Van Beilen has decided to hang up her suit and goggles, and retire from competitive swimming after missing the qualifying standard for the Rio 2016 Olympic games. This can be a heavy hit for most athletes, but Tera was smiling and positive when she spoke to us.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little shocked to be going through as much joy as I am now. I love the sport so much, and I will miss it \u2026 Swimming teaches you how to deal with these situations and making the best of what comes about and I think that's been really important in this transition phase,\u201d Van Beilen said.\n\nThis was not an easy decision either. After devoting years of her life to this sport, she reflects on her career and has no regrets.\n\n\u201cI didn't want to go into Olympic Trials thinking \u2018If I don't make the Olympics, life is over\u2019. I wanted to go in with confidence that I could potentially make it, and at the end of the day I actually swam the fastest that I ever had in four years and I have no regrets about the way I swam and the training and the last year. It's just the other girls were faster.\u201d\n\nVan Beilen isn\u2019t unfamiliar with this change in dynamics and \"passing the torch\". When she qualified for the Olympics back in 2012, she beat out reigning Canadian champion and record holder Annamay Pierse for the gold medal and the elusive spot on the Canadian team.\n\n\u201cMaking the Olympics was something that I actually didn't think I would realistically do in 2012, I thought it would be more of a 2016 goal and ended up doing it. In the moment after touching the wall, it was still something that was so surreal. Now, looking back on it, I will forever be an Olympian.\u201d\n\nYou could argue that she owes a bit of her success to the time that she\u2019s spent in Vancouver, especially at UBC. Despite receiving offers for full-ride scholarships from many American colleges, Van Beilen made the \u201chardest choice of her life.\u201d She decided to attend UBC to pursue her Olympic dreams.\n\n\u201cThe head coach of the Vancouver (High Performance) Centre flew to my house for dinner, and told me everything about UBC, and I was like it's a no-brainer. I need to come to this school. I would be training with Joseph Nagy, who's one of the best breaststroke coaches in the world, and putting myself in a tough environment where most of the members of the team had qualified for international competitions, all while earning a degree. Really, there\u2019s no other choice that seemed as perfect as UBC,\u201d said Van Beilen.\n\nAfter five years of gruelling high-performance training \u2014 including 10 two-hour swim practices a week alongside five hours of dryland training and balancing full-time schooling \u2014 Van Beilen feels blessed to have had this opportunity.\n\n\u201cI came [to UBC] because I wanted to make the Olympic team, that was my dream since I was a little kid. So I said whatever is going to get me there, I'm going to do. To get a degree at the same time too? It was tough, but I'm glad it did it,\u201d Van Beilen said.\n\nAs she heads into her final months at UBC, Van Beilen is finishing up her kinesiology degree and hopes to hit the pool again sometime soon. More importantly, she\u2019s looking towards the future with bright eyes, a positive attitude and some valuable life lessons under her wings.\n\n\u201cThere are flips and flops in swimming, and that's what is so exciting. You win and you lose. Here I am now, happy and excited,\u201d said Van Beilen.\n\nWho knows what\u2019s next for this Olympian, but we\u2019re sure it won\u2019t be the last we see of Tera Van Beilen."}, {"url": "https://wikiborn.com/tera-van-beilen/", "page_content": "Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest 0 Shares\n\nTera van Beilen is a well-known celebrity and her real name is Tera van Beilen.

She was the family\u2019s most enthusiastic user of the backyard pool (she remembers summer days with her sister, Marya, dropping marbles into the deep end, seeing who could come up with the most).\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a Eureka moment. Tera liked swimming enough to make it a regular thing. She got pretty good at it pretty fast. The coaches on hand pressed the Van Beilens to intensify Tera\u2019s twice-a-week training schedule.\n\nBut through grade school it remained a hobby and a physical outlet, rather than an obsession.\n\nToday, Van Beilen, a distinctly unchubby 18-year-old, is headed to the London Olympics, a surprise medal contender in the 100m and 200m breaststroke.\n\nGenetics must have something to do with this. Her uncle, Wayne Van Dorp, played for the Blackhawks and the Penguins. Her cousin, Joel Reinders, is an offensive tackle with the New York Giants.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the one protecting Eli Manning. Or is it Peyton Manning? I\u2019m not sure. One of the Mannings,\u201d Van Beilen said.\n\nThe illusion of athletic effortlessness is also a family thing. Reinders played only eight games of football at any level before being signed by the Cleveland Browns.\n\nLike her gargantuan cousin, Van Beilen\u2019s progression is proof to parents everywhere that a child can master a sport without sacrificing every other thing it means to be a child.\n\n\u201cThey let me have swimming and still have school. I had both worlds,\u201d Van Beilen says.\n\nRight into high school, Van Beilen played other sports. It wasn\u2019t until age 15 that she made swimming her focus.\n\nA great many athletic stories \u2014 both amateur and pro \u2014 start precociously early and are filled with nothing from then on but practice and competition. In an extreme example, 10-year-old Alexander Ovechkin played in a hockey tournament the day after his brother died.\n\nVan Beilen went to a regular school \u2014 Oakville\u2019s Kings Christian Collegiate \u2014 rather than a sporting academy. On Friday nights, she watched Say Yes to the Dress with her mom. She went out with friends on Saturdays. She attended the birthright of all typical teens \u2014 the prom.\n\nEven after swimming became her job, she treated it like one \u2014 a Monday-to-Friday thing. However, it was an exhausting Monday to Friday thing.\n\nShe was cut a few breaks at school. Teachers would occasionally let her go out to her car and sleep through a class. Her mother, Sharon, an administrator at the school, set up a quiet room for Van Beilen to nap through her spares.\n\nShe graduated last year. She now attends Swimming Canada\u2019s branch office in Vancouver, the University of British Columbia. Five of Canada\u2019s pool Olympians were studying and training at UBC last year.\n\nA year ago, the Olympics were a dream for Van Beilen. Literally. She began having dreams about touching the wall, looking up at the clock and seeing herself qualified. She has a picture of the rings pasted over her bed at home and at school.\n\nBut that\u2019s all they were. At that point Van Beilen was ranked 18th in the world in the 100-metre event, and 23rd in the 200-metre. That put her 5th and 3rd, respectively, on Canada\u2019s depth chart in events where only two competitors qualify.\n\nIn February, hope began to turn to belief when she finished first in the 100-metre at the CIS Championships and a narrow second to UBC teammate and fellow Olympian Martha McCabe in the 200.\n\n\u201cThat was when I began to say to myself, \u2018I know I can do this\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn March, she went to the Olympic trials in Montreal. She first qualified in the 100-metre by placing second, a mild surprise. But it was her performance in the 200-metre that brought her to global attention.\n\nVan Beilen finished first in the 200-metre final, pushing third-place finisher and current world record holder Annamay Pierse off Canada\u2019s Olympic team. Her time of 2:24:03 was, at that point, the second fastest in the world this year.\n\nThe day after qualifying, she flew back to Vancouver to sit a physiology exam she had very purposely put out of her mind while she concentrated on the trials. She got a 57.\n\n\u201cMom, I got a 57!\u201d Van Beilen excitedly told her mother. Sharon was less excited.\n\nShe looks pretty excited now, snapping pictures of Star photographer Steve Russell while he takes pictures of Tera sitting on the diving board of that family pool. Sharon\u2019s wearing a Team Van Beilen t-shirt. Tera\u2019s childhood trophies are piled up in boxes in the hallway of their Oakville cottage. They\u2019ve just returned from display at Tera\u2019s grade school.\n\nFather Harry, an executive with Tim Hortons, drifts in on his lunch hour to take in the scene. The Van Beilens didn\u2019t push their daughter into sport, but they\u2019re enjoying watching her flower in that world.\n\n\u201cI think Tera likes it, too,\u201d Harry says, in that teasing way a father says things within earshot of his children.\n\n\u201cLikes what?\u201d Tera says.\n\n\u201cThe attention,\u201d Harry says.\n\n\u201cRight, dad,\u201d Tera drawls sarcastically, 18 going on 13 for just a moment. They catch each other\u2019s eye and smile. This has the feel of a family routine that\u2019s been perfected over many years.\n\nNobody made Tera Van Beilen do anything. Left to her own youthful devices, she has put herself on the cusp of something that will last long after youth has faded.\n\nRELATED\n\nProfile: Diver Jennifer Abel\n\nProfile: Swimmer Julia Wilkinson\n\nProfile: Mountain biker Catharine Pendrel\n\nProfile: Rowing\u2019s Lesley Thompson-Willie\n\nLondon Olympic quiz\n\nKEY COMPETITORS\n\nRebecca Soni, U.S.A.100 and 200 No woman in the world dominates a single stroke the way Soni dominates breaststroke. She has three Olympic medals, has held four world records and is the defending world champion at both the 100m and 200m distance. Soni is the clear favourite in both of Van Beilen\u2019s events.\n\nJessica Hardy, U.S.A.100 The world\u2019s dominant breaststroker until a doping suspension cost her an appearance in Beijing, where Soni eclipsed her. She\u2019s the defending U.S. champion at this distance and the current world record holder.\n\n\u201cOther than those two, it\u2019s pretty close afterward. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s game,\u201d says Van Beilen. \u201cWhoever can deal with the pressure at that moment can succeed. And that\u2019s one thing I think I\u2019m pretty good at.\u201d\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://popularbio.com/tera-van-beilen/", "page_content": "Updated On April 30, 2023\n\nTera van Beilen estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
