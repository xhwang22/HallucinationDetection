{"Tom Wise was born in London.": [{"url": "https://prabook.com/web/thomas.wise/3763095", "page_content": "Thomas Wise\n\nActor playwright\n\nMarch 23, 1865 (age 62) Faversham, England, United Kingdom\n\nHe began to act at eighteen, picking up what jobs he could on the coast, in variety shows. On August 27, 1883, while he was traveling with \"Ingham's Combination Troupe\" (seven people), the coach which carried them rolled down an embankment in the mountains. In 1885 William Gillette saw him act in San Francisco, and brought him east in The Private Secretary, but he got no nearer Broadway than the Grand Opera House on Eighth Avenue. He did not reach Broadway till 1888, when he appeared there in Lost in New York. From that time, he was a familiar figure in the New York theatre, filling a niche of his own, in farce-comedy especially. During the nineties he was often seen in the farces of George Broadhurst, and in 1899 appeared in The Wrong Mr. Wright in London. Among the plays he acted in during this decade were Gloriana (1892), On the Mississippi (1894), The War of Wealth, The House That Jack Built, and Are You a Mason? In 1901 he acted with Arnold Daly at Wallack's Theatre. The appearances with Daly were followed by Vivian's Papas (1903), Mrs. Temple's Telegram and The Prince Chap (1905), and The Little Cherub (1906), with Hattie Williams. In 1907 he was in a musical comedy called The Lady from Lane's, and the following season in Miss Hook of Holland. In 1908 he appeared as co-star with Douglas Fairbanks in a play written by himself and Harrison Rhodes, A Gentleman from Mississippi, a political comedy. He then wrote, again with Rhodes, and acted in a play called An Old New Yorker (1911). In the same year he and Rhodes wrote and produced a play called The Greatest Show on Earth, which was followed by a revival of Lights o' London. In the autumn of 1911 he acted with John Barrymore in Uncle Sam, in 1912 in Captain Whittaker's Place, by Joseph Lincoln, in 1913 in The Silver Wedding, and in 1914 in Edward Sheldon's dramatization of The Song of Songs. In 1916 he was back in a more congenial play, taking the place of James K. Hackett as Falstaff in The Merry Wives of Windsor, when Hackett, who had produced the play with elaborate sets by Joseph Urban, fell ill. After co-starring with William Courtenay in 1917 in Lee Dodd's Comedy, Pals First, in September 1918 he realized an ambition to impersonate P. T. Barnum, in a play called Mr. Barnum, written by himself and Harrison Rhodes. Later appearances were in Cappy Ricks (1919), as Sir Oliver in the Players' Club revival of The School for Scandal (June 1923), as Sir Anthony in The Rivals, with Mrs. Fiske (1924 - 1925), in The Adorable Liar (1926), and with Eleanor Painter in The Nightingale (1927). His later years were made difficult by illness. He made his last appearance in Chicago, in Behold This Dreamer, on October 31, 1927. He died on March 21, 1928, in New York."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/tom-wise/", "page_content": "Tom (Thomas) Harold Wise (born 13 May 1948 in Bournemouth) was an Independent and UKIP Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the East of England. A former police officer, he was elected in 2004 as a member of the UK Independence Party but later had the whip withdrawn when allegations of misuse of parliamentary expenses surfaced in The Sunday Telegraph. Following an inquiry carried out by the European Anti-Fraud Office, Wise was formally charged with false accounting and money laundering by Bedfordshire Police. After initially pleading not guilty, he admitted the charges and was sentenced in November 2009 at Southwark Crown Court to a two-year term of imprisonment. He is thought to be the first MEP to be jailed for expenses fraud. Sentencing him, the judge said that Wise had engaged in \"deliberate and blatant dishonesty\" and had set about to defraud the European Parliament almost as soon as he was elected.\n\nEarly career\n\nBorn in Bournemouth on 13 May 1948, Wise attended Bournemouth School between 1959 and 1965, before completing a Diploma in Public Speaking in 1967. He served with Dorset Police before embarking on a career in the food distribution and processing industry. He became the UK Managing Director of a German herbs and spices company. From 1981 to 1989 he was a member of the Liberal Party.\n\nPolitical career\n\nUKIP\n\nWise joined the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) in 1997. He served as office manager to Jeffrey Titford MEP, during this period he worked on the rules governing MEPs' expenses and gained an expertise in the system which he would later use to his advantage. He was the fourth-placed candidate on UKIP's candidate list in for the European Parliament elections in 1999, and also stood as the party's candidate in the 1997, 2001 and 2005 general elections for the South West Bedfordshire constituency. In the 2005 general election, he came fourth with 4.2% of the votes cast.\n\nHe was elected as an MEP for UKIP in the 2004 European elections. He was UKIP's official spokesman on the Culture, Youth, Media and Sport Committee until his suspension by the party in February 2007. In his first speech to the Committee on 4 October 2004, Wise criticised the proposed budget and drew allusions with Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. In his maiden speech to the Parliament on 16 December 2004, Wise blamed the European Union for creating unacceptable conditions for the transit of animals around Europe. Wise also spoke out against the Proposed directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions\n\nIndependent\n\nAfter losing the party whip in March 2007, Wise continued as an Independent within UKIP's Independence/Democracy parliamentary grouping pending the outcome of the fraud inquiry.\n\nDuring his time as an MEP, Wise disputed the genuine nature of the September 11th attacks. and labelled Russia-based businessman Alisher Usmanov a \"gangster and racketeer\"\n\nFollowing the decision to press criminal charges against him, Wise decided not to contest the 2009 European Parliament elections. He has however said that he wants to stand as an MP in the 2010 General Election.\n\nFraud conviction\n\nExposure\n\nOn 23 October 2005, a reporter for the Sunday Telegraph, Daniel Foggo, published an article accusing Wise of claiming \u00a336,000 a year from the European Parliament in the name of his researcher, Lindsay Jenkins, while only passing on about a sixth of that amount to her. According to now-repealed Rules governing the payment of expenses and allowances to Members of the European Parliament, MEPs could claim up to \u00a3125,000 per year for assistants' wages, but this money must be paid either directly to the employees or to a third-party agent. The rules did not allow the funds to pass directly through the hands of MEPs themselves.\n\nFoggo later reported that Wise had supplied the European Parliament's Payments Office with a \"contract\" including her name and details, which stipulated that the \u00a336,000 allowance should be paid into an account named \"Stags\". This account, held with the Co-operative Bank, was in fact Wise's own business account and its full name was \"T Wise trading as Stags\". The actual agreement between Wise and Jenkins stated that she would receive monthly \"retainer\" payments of \u00a3500 for advice and statistical research, with any extra work to be paid on top. Bank documents obtained by Foggo showed that between November 2004 and October 2005, Wise had paid \u00a339,100 to this account, out of which Jenkins received \u00a313,555. These funds were the only monies coming into the account. In another breach of the payment regulations, some of the \u00a313,555 paid to Jenkins represented work done on behalf of other UKIP members, including party leader Nigel Farage who had agreed to fund the publication of a eurosceptic pamphlet by Jenkins. A further \u00a319,000 was transferred from the account, some of which to pay off credit cards.\n\nOn 29 October, Wise admitted to breaching the rules and, to head off a scandal, agreed to repay \u00a325,230. An internal UKIP inquiry was launched after the Parliament became aware of the affair, but no action was taken and the results of the investigation were kept secret. As Daniel Foggo later reported, UKIP's former leader, Roger Knapman, halted the inquiry after it uncovered serious wrongdoing, believing that the European Parliament would clear Wise. Farage told reporter Daniel Foggo that Wise \"had committed a simple, silly error by making himself a \"paying agent\" for his own staff.\"\n\nSuspension from UKIP\n\nOn 23 February 2007, party sources at UKIP discovered that the European Parliament had passed the affair to OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office. A UKIP meeting was convened in Brussels on 28 February 2007 at which Wise formally admitted to having spent \u00a36,500 from the allowance on a dark green Peugeot 406 which he still drove, but refused to disclose how he had spent a further \u00a313,000 of the funds. After a heated discussion, a decision was taken to remove the whip; both Knapman and fellow MEP Mike Nattrass challenged the decision and threatened to reconsider their futures in the party. Farage emphasised that, if cleared by the OLAF investigation, Wise would be welcomed back into the party, adding that he thought \"there is a great deal of public sympathy for us.\" Wise was however suspended by the party.\n\nFollowing his suspension, Wise spent a further \u00a38,000 of the allowance in legal fees in contemplation of a libel case against Greg Lance-Watkins who had published claims on the Internet relating to Wise's activities. No action was ultimately brought against Lance-Watkins.\n\nNews of the World sting\n\nIn May 2008, the News of the World published details of a sting involving Tom Wise. A female reporter posing as a work experience student recorded Wise brazenly admitting in a Belgian bar that he had little idea of what his job as a Member of the European Parliament entailed, adding \"I don't know what an MEP's job is. No one's ever given me a job description. I've no idea what an MEP should or shouldn't do. So you make it up as you go along.\" He boasted of fiddling the Parliament's expenses system, stating \"Yes, I am milking the system [...] I have a simple philosophy. You and your parents are paying for me. Sorry, tough!\" The newspaper used its leading article to call for a change in the rules governing MEPs' expenses following the expos\u00e9.\n\nArrest and charges\n\nOn 20 June 2008, Wise was arrested by Bedfordshire Police's Economic Crime Unit on suspicion of making a false instrument, obtaining money by deception by transfer and converting criminal property. He was bailed until 29 October. Bedfordshire Police made the arrest after having been contacted by OLAF.\n\nOn 20 April 2009 the Crown Prosecution Service advised Bedfordshire Police to charge both Wise and Jenkins with one count each of false accounting contrary to the Theft Act 1968 and one count each of money laundering contrary to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Both were scheduled to appear before the City of Westminster Magistrates' Court on in April 2009 to face the charges. Wise indicated that he was innocent and would fight the charges which carry a maximum 14-year jail term. He is thought to be the first MEP to face criminal charges over the misuse of parliamentary funds, and the second former UKIP MEP after Ashley Mote to have faced criminal charges during a parliamentary session.\n\nTrial and conviction\n\nWise appeared in court on 27 April 2009 and spoke only to confirm his name and plead not guilty. Jenkins also denied the charges. District Judge Daphne Wickham released both on conditional bail until 8 June. The case was transferred to Southwark Crown Court and charges specified: that Wise and Jenkins \"falsified a document, namely a contract for provision of services, an application for secretarial assistance allowance and invoices\". Also, that they used funds \"received from the European Parliament intended for use as payments for secretarial services.\"\n\nThe three-week trial began on 2 November 2009. Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC heard the prosecution argue that Wise channelled parliamentary funds into an account he secretly controlled so that he could pay credit card debts and buy fine wines. He made separate payments of \u00a32,228 and \u00a31,260 to wine importers, and maintained the deception by asking Jenkins to sign blank documents which he completed later. But for his exposure, Wise would, according to prosecutors, have claimed up to \u00a3180,000.\n\nOn the third day of the trial, just before Nigel Farage was due to give evidence against him, Wise began several hours of negotiations with his legal team after which he changed his plea to guilty and said he was entirely to blame for the fraud. This resulted in Jenkins being acquitted. He was sentenced on 10 November 2009 to two years imprisonment, the sentence having been reduced by one year on account of his guilty plea. In sentencing him, Judge Geoffrey Rivlin declared that:\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that you had hardly got your feet beneath your desk as an MEP before you were planning to defraud the parliament to which you were elected and the people you were elected to serve. This was very deliberate and blatant dishonesty. You did not fall into this offence as a result of some unfortunate combination of unforeseen circumstances which happened to suddenly present you with temptation. You knew the system of expenses inside out and this was a claim you devised and planned with some care.\n\nThe judge added that, in addition to jail, Wise would also have to pay \u00a330,000 towards the prosecution's costs.\n\nPersonal life\n\nWise is married to Janet and, until his imprisonment, lived in Linslade near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire. He has two grown-up children.\n\nWise has a developed interest in wines, having followed courses arranged by the Wine & Spirit Education Trust and has reached \"the level just below Master of Wine\". He has spoken of having a wine cellar containing 1,000 bottles of wine."}, {"url": "https://happyhappybirthday.net/en/age/tom-wise-person_uqeqalx", "page_content": "Tom Wise\n\nBritish politician (born 1948) \u2013 Tom Wise was born in Bournemouth (town in the ceremonial county of Dorset, England) on May 13th, 1948 and is 75 years old today.\n\nAge How old is Tom Wise? 75 Tom Wise is 75 years old.\n\nBiographical data\n\nTom Wise\n\nBirthday When was Tom Wise born?

He was the son of Henry Wise and his first wife Mary Trollopp, who were married at St Aldate's Church on 29 April 1697. For more details about his parents and siblings, see the biography of his father, who was himself three times Mayor of Oxford.\n\nIn January 1722/3 when he was aged 16, Thomas was apprenticed as a mercer to his father.\n\nLeft: Portrait of Alderman Thomas Wise (wrongly dated 1738: perhaps 1758?),\n\nwhich hangs in the Council Chamber of the Town Hall\n\nIn September 1738 Thomas Wise (31) was chosen Mayor\u2019s Child by the new Mayor, William Ives\n\nOn 3 September 1738 Wise was admitted free, and he later had his own mercer\u2019s shop in Cornmarket.\n\nIn 1739 he was appointed a cloth-searcher; and in September 1741 he was elected Senior Bailiff.\n\nThomas's father Henry Wise died on 9 October 1741.\n\nAt some point Thomas Wise married a woman called Deborah, but the marriage has not been found. They do not appear to have had any children.\n\nIn July 1746 Wise was chosen as one of the eight Assistants, and in September that year he was elected Mayor of Oxford (for 1746/7), selecting John Phillips as his Child and William Cherry as his Chamberlain.\n\nOn 3 October 1755 Wise was elected an Alderman.\n\nBy 1758 Wise had moved from his Cornmarket shop: Jackson\u2019s Oxford Journal reports that a Mrs Fowler had moved into his house in Cornmarket that year, and in 1760 that Henry Smith, mercer (former apprentice of John Austin, another Mayor) had opened at the shop in Cornmarket that was formerly kept by Alderman Wise.\n\nOn 20 September 1762 Thomas Wise was elected Mayor again, but refused to accept the office, paying the City Treasurer \u00a350 as a fine for not serving.\n\nIn 1766 the City got into such debt that the council tried to sell its two parliamentary seats. As a result, the Mayor and ten councillors (including Alderman Wise) were committed to Newgate Prison in London for four days; they were discharged with a reprimand from the Speaker of the House of Commons on 10 February 1768.\n\nWise\u2019s widowed sister, Mrs Elizabeth Lowe of Headington Hill, died on 2 October 1766.\n\nIn 1771, Thomas Wise was again chosen Mayor, but again refused, paying another fine of \u00a350.\n\nBy 1772 Thomas Wise was living in a house in New Inn Hall Street. In that year a survey of every house in the city was taken in consequence of the Mileways Act of 1771, and according to H. E. Salter, the house of Alderman Wise, which had a frontage of 43 yards, 0 ft. and 10 in., occpied the site of the present 42, 44, 46, 48, and 50 New Inn Hall Street; and he also had a \u201cgarden, &c\u201d on the site of 21 New Inn Hall Street, with a frontage of 12 yards, 2 ft. and 6 in.\n\nThomas Wise died in August 1772 at the age of 65. The plaque below says that he died on 13 August, but as he is recorded as having been buried inside the St Peter-in-the-East Church on 29 August, one of these dates may be wrong. He left all his estate to his wife Deborah.\n\nHis widow Deborah Wise died on 24 April 1777 at the age of 63 at her house in New Inn Hall Street and was buried with him on 1 May.\n\nAlthough they did not live in St Peter-in-the-East parish, they were buried inside that church with other members of Thomas Wise's family.

J. Wise will mean little to those outside the lofty world of rare books: it appears in passing in the details of an \u2018incredibly rare\u2019 set of handwritten poems by Emily Bronte which was to have been auctioned at Sotheby\u2019s next month.\n\nThe poems \u2014 along with further Bronte notes, sketches, letters and books \u2014 are part of the Honresfield library, a collection of literary treasures amassed by Victorian industrialists, which also includes letters from Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra.\n\nSo important is the haul that the sale has been temporarily put on hold to allow a consortium led by Friends of the National Libraries, including Oxford\u2019s Bodleian, the British Library and the National Library of Scotland, to try to raise \u00a315 million to save the manuscripts for the nation.\n\nThomas J. Wise, born in 1859, had an international reputation as a bibliographic scholar and collector of rare books - perhaps the pre-eminent authority on book collecting and valuing modern first editions\n\nSo the future of the trove remains uncertain: not so the reputation of the man who plays his own part in this literary drama. Wise owned a number of Bronte manuscripts \u2014 works by Charlotte, Emily, Branwell and Anne \u2014 but his skill as a collector and dealer has long been lost to his notoriety.\n\nHis name now serves as a reminder of one of the greatest literary scandals of the 20th century.\n\nWise was at the centre of a bibliographic whodunnit of the highest order, a tale of class, money and hubris in which the ingenuity of a couple of young scholars destroyed the reputation of one of the most respected men of their age.\n\nThe early 20th century was a golden era of book collecting, when some of the foundations of the British Museum\u2019s unparalleled collection of rare books were laid.\n\nBook collecting had been a game for the wealthiest aristocrats, seeking out priceless copies of works by Shakespeare or Chaucer.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, attention shifted to rare editions of what would now be called \u2018modern classics\u2019 \u2014 works by the Romantic poets and 19th-century novelists.\n\nThomas J. Wise, born in Gravesend, Kent, in 1859, was at the epicentre of this new and growing world.\n\nFor most of his career, Wise had an international reputation as a bibliographic scholar and collector of rare books \u2014 perhaps the pre-eminent authority on book collecting and valuing modern first editions. He became president of The Bibliographical Society and a trustee of the British Museum. He sat on the consultative committee of the Bodleian Library and became an Honorary Fellow of an Oxford college.\n\nHowever, a rogue comma revealed him as a forger, a thief and a cheat. Throughout his career, Wise had been 'discovering' and selling valuable 'first editions' that had never actually existed\n\nHe was also regarded as an expert on authenticating rare books and detecting fraud.\n\nBut just three years before the end of his long life \u2014 when he could reasonably have expected to be borne into posterity amid universal acclaim \u2014 Wise\u2019s world imploded. He was revealed as a forger, a thief and a cheat. This head gamekeeper was, it turned out, the worst poacher of all.\n\nThroughout his career, Wise had been \u2018discovering\u2019 and selling valuable \u2018first editions\u2019 that had never actually existed.\n\nHe had staged phoney auctions to establish high prices for his own forgeries. He ripped out and stole pages from valuable books in the British Museum\u2019s permanent collection to cannibalise them into the equivalent of what used-car dealers call \u2018cut-n-shut\u2019 jobs, before selling them to wealthy patrons in America.\n\nIt should be added here that there are no questions over the authenticity of the Bronte trove.\n\nWhy did he do it when his legitimate talents had already brought him a long way? Though Wise liked to hint that he was descended from Irish aristocracy, he was born into poverty.\n\nHe shared a poky home with his widowed father and two brothers and, as far as is known, never attended school, let alone university. Yet his late mother had left him with a love of the Romantic poets \u2014 Shelley in particular.\n\nAs a boy, he walked instead of taking a bus so he could save pennies to buy books. He hustled his way into the book world via the Shelley Society and made his name arranging for (legitimate) facsimile first editions to be printed.\n\nHe went on to seek out and supply rare books to America\u2019s so-called robber barons \u2014 ruthless and highly successful industrialists who wanted to acquire their own libraries.\n\nThe name T. J. Wise appears in passing in the details of an \u2018incredibly rare\u2019 set of handwritten poems by Emily Bronte (pictured) which was to have been auctioned at Sotheby\u2019s next month\n\nHe was damned good at it. As Joseph Hone, an academic writing a biography of Wise, describes it, \u2018he was a serious, and a seriously good, collector\u2019. And yet that wasn\u2019t enough. He cheated, too. His confirmed forgeries include editions of everyone from Dickens and Tennyson to George Eliot and Wordsworth.\n\nNemeses arrived in the form of two young book dealers. While Wise had elbowed his way into the establishment by force of personality and low cunning, these two were definitely to the manor born.\n\nJohn Carter had breezed from Eton scholarship to a double first at King\u2019s College, Cambridge. Even in his 20s he wore a monocle, and is reputed to have supplied James Bond\u2019s creator Ian Fleming with the recipe for the perfect dry martini.\n\nGraham Pollard was more roguish: Oxford-educated, he barely scraped a third and didn\u2019t even bother to collect his degree. A member of the aristocratic student drinking club the Hypocrites, he boasted of having beaten Evelyn Waugh to a half-blue in competitive spitting.\n\nCarter and Pollard became friends through a group of young booksellers known as the Biblio-boys, who met often to gossip over sherry.\n\nTheir interest was piqued when rumours began to circulate that there might be something not quite kosher about a much sought-after 1847 edition of Sonnets From The Portuguese, written by Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\n\nThe forgery had followed Wise\u2019s by now standard modus operandi: print a copy of a genuine text and change the publication date, to imply it was a limited edition that had been circulated privately before the main printing. In an instant, you have a valuable property \u2014 and one that is very hard to prove is fake. Any comparators would be assumed to be squirrelled away in some other private collections.\n\nThe sale has been temporarily put on hold to allow Friends of the National Libraries, including Oxford\u2019s Bodleian, the British Library and the National Library of Scotland, to try to raise \u00a315 million to save the manuscripts (pictured) for the nation\n\nYet Carter, who had been asked to secure one by a client, smelled a rat. He ended up comparing notes with Pollard, who was onto an equally fishy edition of Ruskin. The two got together and started an investigation that was as pitiless as it was ingenious.\n\nForensic work on the history of type established, for example, that there was a special aspect of the lower case \u2018f\u2019 that could only be found after 1880.\n\nTheir analysis of a forged edition of George Eliot\u2019s poem Agatha turned on such minutiae as the hyphenation in \u2018garden-gate\u2019, a comma after the word \u2018behind\u2019, and the stray letter \u2018s\u2019 turning \u2018thing\u2019 into \u2018things\u2019.\n\nThey were the first to do serious chemical analysis of paper, anticipating work done on other notorious frauds such as the Hitler Diaries in the 1980s.\n\nDiscovering that certain types of wood pulp were used only after the 1880s or 1890s, they persuaded a librarian at Harvard to let them analyse a sliver of the Browning edition in their collection \u2014 and lo and behold, the paper turned out to come from much later than the date on the title page.\n\nWhen they tumbled to what Wise had been up to, it was, as Carter put it: \u2018...as if the Bank of England had been caught issuing counterfeit money\u2019.\n\nHe and Pollard steadily built their case, and in 1934 they dropped their neutron bomb on the book world. An essay entitled An Enquiry Into The Nature Of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets might sound somewhat dull, but its impact was devastating \u2014 a forensic work of genius that systematically debunked dozens of valuable 19th-century editions as outright fakes.\n\nAnd what did those editions have in common? They had all been authenticated by Thomas J. Wise.\n\nThe authors delicately avoided ever accusing their man of fraud. They did not need to. Bibliophiles are good at reading between the lines. Wise died in disgrace.\n\nHere was a man who wrote the standard bibliographies for swathes of 19th-century writers \u2014 and inserted references to his own forgeries.\n\nHe introduced them into the permanent collections of the British Museum and craftily seeded a mention of that 1847 edition of Sonnets From The Portuguese into an account of the Brownings\u2019 honeymoon.\n\nAround 100 of his forgeries have been found, though Hone suspects there are more. \u2018We\u2019re still reckoning with Wise\u2019s legacy,\u2019 he says.\n\nAnd in a twisted way, Wise \u2014 this Robert Maxwell of the antiquarian book world \u2014 might be amused."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Tom-Wise", "page_content": "Thomas Harold Wise (born 13 May 1948) was an Independent and UKIP Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the East of England. A former police officer, he was elected in 2004 as a member of the UK Independence Party but later had the whip withdrawn when allegations of misuse of parliamentary expenses surfaced in The Sunday Telegraph. Following an inquiry carried out by the European Anti-Fraud Office, Wise was formally charged with false accounting and money laundering by Bedfordshire Police. After initially pleading not guilty, he admitted the charges and was sentenced in November 2009 at Southwark Crown Court to a two-year term of imprisonment. He is thought to be the first MEP to be jailed for expenses fraud. Sentencing him, the judge said that Wise had engaged in \"deliberate and blatant dishonesty\" and had set about to defraud the European Parliament almost as soon as he was elected.\n\nEarly career\n\nBorn in Bournemouth, Wise attended Bournemouth School between 1959 and 1965, before completing a Diploma in Public Speaking in 1967. He served with Dorset Police before embarking on a career in the food distribution and processing industry. He became the UK Managing Director of a German herbs and spices company. From 1981 to 1989 he was a member of the Liberal Party.\n\nUKIP\n\nWise joined the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) in 1997. He served as office manager to Jeffrey Titford MEP, during this period he worked on the rules governing MEPs' expenses and gained an expertise in the system which he would later use to his advantage. He was the fourth-placed candidate on UKIP's candidate list in for the European Parliament elections in 1999, and also stood as the party's candidate in the 1997, 2001 and 2005 general elections for the South West Bedfordshire constituency. In the 2005 general election, he came fourth with 4.2% of the votes cast.\n\nHe was elected as an MEP for UKIP in the 2004 European elections. He was UKIP's official spokesman on the Culture, Youth, Media and Sport Committee until his suspension by the party in February 2007. In his first speech to the Committee on 4 October 2004, Wise criticised the proposed budget and drew allusions with Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. In his maiden speech to the Parliament on 16 December 2004, Wise blamed the European Union for creating unacceptable conditions for the transit of animals around Europe. Wise also spoke out against the Proposed directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions\n\nIndependent\n\nAfter losing the party whip in March 2007, Wise continued as an Independent within UKIP's Independence/Democracy parliamentary grouping pending the outcome of the fraud inquiry.\n\nDuring his time as an MEP, Wise disputed the genuine nature of the September 11th attacks. and labelled Russia-based businessman Alisher Usmanov, who is a shareholder of Arsenal F.C. a \"gangster and racketeer\"\n\nFollowing the decision to press criminal charges against him, Wise decided not to contest the 2009 European Parliament elections. He has however said that he wants to stand as an MP in the 2010 General Election.\n\nExposure\n\nOn 23 October 2005, a reporter for the Sunday Telegraph, Daniel Foggo, published an article accusing Wise of claiming \u00a336,000 a year from the European Parliament in the name of his researcher, Lindsay Jenkins, while only passing on about a sixth of that amount to her. According to now-repealed Rules governing the payment of expenses and allowances to Members of the European Parliament, MEPs could claim up to \u00a3125,000 per year for assistants' wages, but this money must be paid either directly to the employees or to a third-party agent. The rules did not allow the funds to pass directly through the hands of MEPs themselves.\n\nFoggo later reported that Wise had supplied the European Parliament's Payments Office with a \"contract\" including her name and details, which stipulated that the \u00a336,000 allowance should be paid into an account named \"Stags\". This account, held with the Co-operative Bank, was in fact Wise's own business account and its full name was \"T Wise trading as Stags\". The actual agreement between Wise and Jenkins stated that she would receive monthly \"retainer\" payments of \u00a3500 for advice and statistical research, with any extra work to be paid on top. Bank documents obtained by Foggo showed that between November 2004 and October 2005, Wise had paid \u00a339,100 to this account, out of which Jenkins received \u00a313,555. These funds were the only monies coming into the account. In another breach of the payment regulations, some of the \u00a313,555 paid to Jenkins represented work done on behalf of other UKIP members, including party leader Nigel Farage who had agreed to fund the publication of a eurosceptic pamphlet by Jenkins. A further \u00a319,000 was transferred from the account, some of which to pay off credit cards.\n\nOn 29 October, Wise admitted to breaching the rules and, to head off a scandal, agreed to repay \u00a325,230. An internal UKIP inquiry was launched after the Parliament became aware of the affair, but no action was taken and the results of the investigation were kept secret. As Daniel Foggo later reported, UKIP's former leader, Roger Knapman, halted the inquiry after it uncovered serious wrongdoing, believing that the European Parliament would clear Wise. Farage told reporter Daniel Foggo that Wise \"had committed a simple, silly error by making himself a \"paying agent\" for his own staff.\"\n\nSuspension from UKIP\n\nOn 23 February 2007, party sources at UKIP discovered that the European Parliament had passed the affair to OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office. A UKIP meeting was convened in Brussels on 28 February 2007 at which Wise formally admitted to having spent \u00a36,500 from the allowance on a dark green Peugeot 406 which he still drove, but refused to disclose how he had spent a further \u00a313,000 of the funds. After a heated discussion, a decision was taken to remove the whip; both Knapman and fellow MEP Mike Nattrass challenged the decision and threatened to reconsider their futures in the party. Farage emphasised that, if cleared by the OLAF investigation, Wise would be welcomed back into the party, adding that he thought \"there is a great deal of public sympathy for us.\" Wise was however suspended by the party.\n\nFollowing his suspension, Wise spent a further \u00a38,000 of the allowance in legal fees in contemplation of a libel case against Greg Lance-Watkins who had published claims on the Internet relating to Wise's activities. No action was ultimately brought against Lance-Watkins.\n\nNews of the World sting\n\nIn May 2008, the News of the World published details of a sting involving Tom Wise. A female reporter posing as a work experience student recorded Wise brazenly admitting in a Belgian bar that he had little idea of what his job as a Member of the European Parliament entailed, adding \"I don't know what an MEP's job is. No one's ever given me a job description. I've no idea what an MEP should or shouldn't do. So you make it up as you go along.\" He boasted of fiddling the Parliament's expenses system, stating \"Yes, I am milking the system [...] I have a simple philosophy. You and your parents are paying for me. Sorry, tough!\" The newspaper used its leading article to call for a change in the rules governing MEPs' expenses following the expos\u00e9.\n\nArrest and charges\n\nOn 20 June 2008, Wise was arrested by Bedfordshire Police's Economic Crime Unit on suspicion of making a false instrument, obtaining money by deception by transfer and converting criminal property. He was bailed until 29 October. Bedfordshire Police made the arrest after having been contacted by OLAF.\n\nOn 20 April 2009 the Crown Prosecution Service advised Bedfordshire Police to charge both Wise and Jenkins with one count each of false accounting contrary to the Theft Act 1968 and one count each of money laundering contrary to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Both were scheduled to appear before the City of Westminster Magistrates' Court on in April 2009 to face the charges. Wise indicated that he was innocent and would fight the charges which carry a maximum 14-year jail term. He is thought to be the first MEP to face criminal charges over the misuse of parliamentary funds, and the second former UKIP MEP after Ashley Mote to have faced criminal charges during a parliamentary session.\n\nTrial and conviction\n\nWise appeared in court on 27 April 2009 and spoke only to confirm his name and plead not guilty. Jenkins also denied the charges. District Judge Daphne Wickham released both on conditional bail until 8 June. The case was transferred to Southwark Crown Court and charges specified: that Wise and Jenkins \"falsified a document, namely a contract for provision of services, an application for secretarial assistance allowance and invoices\". Also, that they used funds \"received from the European Parliament intended for use as payments for secretarial services.\"\n\nThe three-week trial began on 2 November 2009. Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC heard the prosecution argue that Wise channelled parliamentary funds into an account he secretly controlled so that he could pay credit card debts and buy fine wines. He made separate payments of \u00a32,228 and \u00a31,260 to wine importers, and maintained the deception by asking Jenkins to sign blank documents which he completed later. But for his exposure, Wise would, according to prosecutors, have claimed up to \u00a3180,000.\n\nOn the third day of the trial, just before Nigel Farage was due to give evidence against him, Wise began several hours of negotiations with his legal team after which he changed his plea to guilty and said he was entirely to blame for the fraud. This resulted in Jenkins being acquitted. He was sentenced on 10 November 2009 to two years imprisonment, the sentence having been reduced by one year on account of his guilty plea. In sentencing him, Judge Geoffrey Rivlin declared that:\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that you had hardly got your feet beneath your desk as an MEP before you were planning to defraud the parliament to which you were elected and the people you were elected to serve. This was very deliberate and blatant dishonesty. You did not fall into this offence as a result of some unfortunate combination of unforeseen circumstances which happened to suddenly present you with temptation. You knew the system of expenses inside out and this was a claim you devised and planned with some care.\n\nThe judge added that, in addition to jail, Wise would also have to pay \u00a330,000 towards the prosecution's costs.\n\nPersonal life\n\nWise is married to Janet and, until his imprisonment, lived in Linslade near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire. He has two grown-up children.\n\nWise has a developed interest in wines, having followed courses arranged by the Wine & Spirit Education Trust and has reached \"the level just below Master of Wine\". He has spoken of having a wine cellar containing 1,000 bottles of wine."}, {"url": "https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/frederick-henry-wise-24-1313yqp", "page_content": "This database contains family trees submitted to Ancestry by users who have indicated that their tree can be viewed by all Ancestry subscribers.These trees can change over time as users edit, remove, or otherwise modify the data in their trees.
