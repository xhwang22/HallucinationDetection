Fauve artists used pure, brilliant colour aggressively applied straight from the paint tubes to create a sense of an explosion on the canvas.\n\nThe Fauves painted directly from nature, as the Impressionists had before them, but Fauvist works were invested with a strong expressive reaction to the subjects portrayed. First formally exhibited in Paris in 1905, Fauvist paintings shocked visitors to the annual Salon d\u2019Automne; one of these visitors was the critic Louis Vauxcelles, who, because of the violence of their works, dubbed the painters fauves (\u201cwild beasts\u201d).\n\nBritannica Quiz Ultimate Art Quiz\n\nThe leader of the group was Henri Matisse, who had arrived at the Fauve style after experimenting with the various Post-Impressionist approaches of Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, and Georges Seurat. Matisse\u2019s studies led him to reject traditional renderings of three-dimensional space and to seek instead a new picture space defined by movement of colour. He exhibited his famous Woman with the Hat (1905) at the 1905 exhibition. In this painting, brisk strokes of colour\u2014blues, greens, and reds\u2014form an energetic, expressive view of the woman. The crude paint application, which left areas of raw canvas exposed, was appalling to viewers at the time.\n\nThe other major Fauvists were Andr\u00e9 Derain, who had attended school with Matisse in 1898\u201399, and Maurice de Vlaminck, who was Derain\u2019s friend. They shared Matisse\u2019s interest in the expressive function of colour in painting, and they first exhibited together in 1905. Derain\u2019s Fauvist paintings translate every tone of a landscape into pure colour, which he applied with short, forceful brushstrokes. The agitated swirls of intense colour in Vlaminck\u2019s works are indebted to the expressive power of van Gogh.\n\nThree young painters from Le Havre, France, were also influenced by Matisse\u2019s bold and vibrant work. Othon Friesz found the emotional connotations of the bright Fauve colours a relief from the mediocre Impressionism he had practiced; Raoul Dufy developed a carefree ornamental version of the bold style; and Georges Braque created a definite sense of rhythm and structure out of small spots of colour, foreshadowing his development of Cubism. Albert Marquet, Matisse\u2019s fellow student at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in the 1890s, also participated in Fauvism, as did the Dutchman Kees van Dongen, who applied the style to depictions of fashionable Parisian society. Other painters associated with the Fauves were Georges Rouault, Henri Manguin, Charles Camoin, and Jean Puy.\n\nFor most of these artists, Fauvism was a transitional, learning stage. By 1908 a revived interest in Paul C\u00e9zanne\u2019s vision of the order and structure of nature had led many of them to reject the turbulent emotionalism of Fauvism in favour of the logic of Cubism. Matisse alone pursued the course he had pioneered, achieving a sophisticated balance between his own emotions and the world he painted."}, {"url": "https://www.theartstory.org/movement/fauvism/", "page_content": "\"I try to condense the meaning of this body [of a woman] by drawing its essential lines.

The Fauves (\"wild beasts\") were a loosely allied group of French painters with shared interests. Several of them, including Henri Matisse, Albert Marquet, and Georges Rouault, had been pupils of the Symbolist artist Gustave Moreau and admired the older artist's emphasis on personal expression. Matisse emerged as the leader of the group, whose members shared the use of intense color as a vehicle for describing light and space, and who redefined pure color and form as means of communicating the artist's emotional state. In these regards, Fauvism proved to be an important precursor to Cubism and Expressionism as well as a touchstone for future modes of abstraction.\n\nKey Ideas & Accomplishments\n\nOne of Fauvism's major contributions to modern art was its radical goal of separating color from its descriptive, representational purpose and allowing it to exist on the canvas as an independent element. Color could project a mood and establish a structure within the work of art without having to be true to the natural world.\n\nAnother of Fauvism's central artistic concerns was the overall balance of the composition. The Fauves' simplified forms and saturated colors drew attention to the inherent flatness of the canvas or paper; within that pictorial space, each element played a specific role. The immediate visual impression of the work is to be strong and unified.\n\nAbove all, Fauvism valued individual expression. The artist's direct experience of his subjects, his emotional response to nature, and his intuition were all more important than academic theory or elevated subject matter. All elements of painting were employed in service of this goal.\n\nOverview of Fauvism\n\nBorn to a family of weavers, and growing up in Bohain-en-Vermandois, as a child Henri Mattise was influenced by the bright colors and patterns of local textiles. His primal feeling for color (the very basis of Fauvism) was reawakened when, as a young man he returned home to convalesce from appendicitis, and his mother gave him a paint box. He later said, \"From the moment I held the box of colors in my hands, I knew this was my life. I threw myself into it like a beast that plunges toward the thing it loves.\" Beginnings and Development Concepts, Trends, & Related Topics Later Developments and Legacy\n\nArtworks and Artists of Fauvism\n\nProgression of Art\n\n1904 Luxe, Calme et Volupte Artist: Henri Matisse This early work by Matisse clearly indicates the artist's stylistic influences, most notably Georges Seurat's Pointillism and Paul Signac's Divisionism, in the use of tiny dabs of color to create a visual frisson. What sets this work apart from these more rigid methods, however, is Matisse's intense concentrations of pure color. The oranges, yellows, greens, and other colors all maintain their own discrete places on the picture plane, never quite merging to form the harmonious tonality that both Seurat and Signac were known for, and instead heighten the almost vertiginous effect created by the striking dots of paint. Matisse took this work's title, which translates as \"luxury, peace, and pleasure,\" from Charles Baudelaire's poem L'Invitation au Voyage (Invitation to a Voyage). Oil on canvas - Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne, Paris 1906 The River Seine at Chatou Artist: Maurice de Vlaminck This scene depicts the portion of the Seine that runs through Chatou, the Paris suburb where de Vlaminck and Derain shared a studio beginning in 1901. For The River Seine, de Vlaminck used impasto (a technique practiced by many Fauves): thick daubs of paint applied directly from the tube, then brushed together in short strokes to create the effect of movement. For the water and sky, de Vlaminck used a range of blues and greens, as well as dazzling white highlights applied in choppy dabs; the two red-and-orange trees at the left provide a lively contrast. The finished effect is one of brightness and vibrating motion; detail and traditional perspective matter far less than a sense of buoyant pleasure. As de Vlaminck said, \"I try to paint with my heart and my guts without worrying about style.\" Oil on canvas - The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York 1907 Pin\u00e8de \u00e0 Cassis (Landscape) Artist: Andr\u00e9 Derain Derain famously claimed to use \"color as a means of expressing my emotion and not as a transcription of nature.\" In this painting (just as in his famous Mountains at Collioure (1905)) Derain used long, isolated brushstrokes, influenced by Divisionist painting, to structure the trees and ground of his landscape. The colors are indeed non-representational, even unnatural: the trees' trunks are almost green, and the landscape is abstracted in patches of bright yellow and orange. The pulsing brushwork and jarring contrasts of these colors suggest the shimmering heat of a Mediterranean summer. By rejecting chiaroscuro and spatial depth, Derain keeps the viewer's attention fixed on this effect of light and on the life force that seems to ripple through every element of the landscape. Oil on canvas - Mus\u00e9e Cantini, Marseille Artwork Images 1905 Portrait of Henri Matisse Artist: Andr\u00e9 Derain Derain painted this portrait of Matisse during the artists' shared summer in Collioure, when the two men were experimenting side-by-side in their work. As in most Fauvist portraiture, a detailed likeness of the subject was not the artist's goal. Derain's chief focus was to express a state of mind through the use of visible brushwork and fluid lines, both of which accentuated his applications of pure color. The sitter's right side is shadowed in violet and turquoise, and the left side of his face is highlighted in broad strokes of pink and red; this non-naturalistic use of saturated color underscores the figure's direct, intense gaze. While the background is painted in thin, vertical strokes, Matisse's head emerges more strongly in impasto brushwork, as if Derain were building it up from the paint itself, rather than through the traditional use of shading or perspective. Oil on canvas - Collection of the Tate, United Kingdom 1905-06 Le Bonheur de Vivre Artist: Henri Matisse The Joy of Life, possibly Matisse's best-known Fauvist work, was created in response to the negative critical reactions that followed Matisse's contributions to the 1905 Salon d'Automne. Although the subject of merry-making figures within a pastoral setting is a venerable one in Western art, Matisse's daring use of non-natural color to structure this enigmatic world, and his free delineation of its inhabitants, gave a fresh update to this imagery. Matisse's nudes perform activities of sensual bliss: dancing, making music, and embracing. They are connected to each other and to the vividly colored landscape by a sinuous network of curving lines and by the artist's radical use of the same pure colors for all the elements of his composition. Pairings of complementary colors (red and green, purple and yellow) produce strong visual contrasts that almost seem to vibrate, and the traditional means of suggesting depth and lighting have been eliminated. This idyllic scene unites thematic and visual influences from the Renaissance to Art Nouveau to Persian miniature painting, but it does so in a way that is undeniably modern. The Joy of Life was as influential as another large figurative canvas, Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), in its expressive reimagining of the human figure and its surroundings. Oil on canvas - The Barnes Foundation, Merion, PA Artwork Images c. 1905 Yacht at Le Havre Decorated with Flags Artist: Raoul Dufy Following in the footsteps of Claude Monet and Eugene Boudin, Dufy painted numerous scenes of Le Havre, a port town located on France's northwestern coast. This view includes several docked ships against a background of local architecture. Although this imagery is largely naturalistic, Dufy's rejection of traditional perspective and his unconventional paint application are avant-garde. The abrupt diagonal line of the wharf at left, for example, has a destabilizing effect. The scene is painted in a stylized notation of quick brushstrokes: a scattering of small curved dabs for the waves, tiny blocks of color for the quayside buildings, and rough, abbreviated strokes for the forms of passing pedestrians. From the ship's mast at the center of the composition dances an array of nautical flags; each one is a small abstraction of color and shape. However, Dufy's apparently unpolished brushwork and the bare edges of the canvas do not detract from the work; instead, they evoke an overall mood of breeziness and gaiety. Oil on canvas - Mus\u00e9e d'art moderne Andre Malraux, Le Havre 1907 Paysage \u00e0 La Ciotat Artist: Othon Friesz Achille \u00c9mile Othon Friesz, a native of Le Havre, moved to Paris to study art in 1898 and became part of the circle that included Matisse, Rouault, Marquet, and Dufy. He frequently traveled in search of landscapes, and from 1906 to 1907 a trip to L'Estaque and La Ciotat in southern France with his friend Braque yielded several important Fauvist works. For this view of the town, Friesz used warm and light yellow tones which he accentuated by touches of green. Although he was a devoted Fauvist for as long as any of his contemporaries, Friesz's approach to the canvas was far more traditional, his color choices were more deliberate, and his application of paint was more methodical. In this sense, Friesz painted an Impressionist-style landscape using Fauvist color. Oil on canvas Artwork Images 1907 Jeanne dans les fleurs Artist: Raoul Dufy In the early stages of his career, newly inspired by a visit to the 1905 Salon d'Automne, Dufy painted several garden scenes inspired by his family's home in Le Havre. However, this is the only one from that period that contains a human figure. Like the Impressionists, Dufy was fond of painting gardens and flowers, but this scene of his family's garden, composed in a shallow, tightly cropped space, was a more expressive work of art. His ambiguous mingling of foreground and background through the curves of the foliage, his raw brushwork, and his non-naturalistic use of color (even in the skin of his model, his sister Jeanne) exemplify Fauvism's freedom from literal physical appearances and its new stress on color's intrinsic emotional power. Oil on canvas - Mus\u00e9e d'art moderne Andre Malraux, Le Havre, France Artwork Images 1907 At the Circus (The Mad Clown) Artist: Georges Rouault A student of Moreau and a friend of Matisse, Rouault brought a more somber, psychologically observant approach to his early Fauvist works like At the Circus. Although he shared the other Fauvists' use of impasto application and dense brushwork, he preferred darker colors that echoed his intense observation of human suffering. Like \u00c9douard Manet and Honor\u00e9 Daumier in the 19th century and his contemporary Pablo Picasso in the early-20th century, Rouault chose the subject of the circus performer. His clowns and acrobats, always shown offstage, reveal the inner pain and loneliness behind their colorful makeup. Rouault was criticized for focusing his attention on the wretched individuals at the margins of society (he also depicted prostitutes, wanderers, and physical laborers). His spiritual and artistic interests soon led him in a different direction than his fellow Fauvists: he began to paint more satirical scenes of societal inequality and the corrupt abuse of power. Oil on cardboard - The Philadelphia Museum of Art 1908 Le Viaduc \u00e0 L'Estaque Artist: Georges Braque Between 1905 and 1908, Braque painted the landscapes of L'Estaque (a setting also favored by C\u00e9zanne) in different color palettes. This 1908 composition reveals Braque's combination of Fauvist color and simplification of form with a nascent interest in volume and multiple perspective: the rounded arches of the ancient viaduct connect both sides of the landscape in the distance, but the foreground is a carefully arranged stack of boxy houses and vigorously brushed greenery. Le Viaduc a l'Estaque foreshadows Braque's future role in the development of Cubism, the next major modern movement of the 20th century. Oil on canvas 1910 La Danse Artist: Henri Matisse Dance and its pendant Music were two of Matisse's late Fauvist works, the culmination of his work in this style. These large-scale canvases were commissioned by the Russian merchant Sergei Shchukin, a major patron of avant-garde art in that period. The arrangement of figures in a circular dance is a centuries-old motif, often used to suggest a golden age of harmony and leisure. However, by simplifying and distorting his dancers' anatomy for expressive purposes, and painting them in a vibrant, non-naturalistic red against a flat ground of blue sky and green earth, Matisse emphasized the primordial aspect of dance. The figures' extremities brush the edges of the composition, as if their dynamism were barely contained by the canvas. When it was first exhibited publicly, at the Salon d'Automne of 1910, Dance puzzled and shocked the audience. Oil on canvas - The Hermitage. St. Petersburg, Russia 1911 The Red Studio Artist: Henri Matisse In The Red Studio, Matisse dismantled the conventional distinctions between foreground and background, figure and space. Color and perspective are both non-naturalistic in this work: the canvas is one broad field of saturated crimson. When asked about this choice of color, Matisse commented, \"Where I got the color red - to be sure, I just don't know. I find that all these things...only become what they are to me when I see them together with the color red.\" The delicate, pale outlines of furniture and walls are actually underpainting revealed from behind the red, and they are not consistent with any traditional perspectival system. Instead, space is flattened and exaggerated so that the viewer seems to be looking down into the studio from a raised vantage point. While this expressive use of color and space is Fauvist, the simplification of forms and static quality of The Red Studio point the way from Matisse's Fauvist phase to his growing interest in non-Western sources and his eventual association with the \u00c9cole de Paris.\n\n\n\nWestern masters from Rembrandt to Courbet had painted their own studios, but instead of showing himself at work as they did, Matisse evoked his creative process and inner vision. The Red Studio also includes an assortment of the artist's Fauvist paintings, as well as sculptures and ceramics, a box of pencils or pastels, a wineglass, and a potted plant that brings a note of the natural landscape into this interior setting. Ironically, the works of art appear more \"real\" than the abstracted room where they have been created. Certain omissions also reinforce the idea that this \"studio\" is a state of mind as well as an actual physical location: the left rear corner of the room lacks any defining line, and the grandfather clock has no hands to tell time. Oil on canvas - The Museum of Modern Art, New York\n\nBeginnings of Fauvism\n\nIn the opening years of the twentieth century, Post-Impressionist painters working in France such as Van Gogh, Gauguin, Seurat, and C\u00e9zanne were considered leaders in avant-garde art. Their collective experiments with paint application, subject matter, expressive line, and pure color were advances that fed the emergence of Fauvism. Symbolism, with its emphasis on the artist's internal vision, was another important influence. From another source, the European reassessment of African sculpture as art rather than an anthropological curiosity introduced new ideas of form and representation to the European modernists.\n\nMatisse as Fauvist Pioneer\n\nHenri Matisse is generally considered the principal founding artist of Fauvism. Like many of his contemporaries, Matisse was greatly influenced by Moreau's teaching that personal expression was among the most important attributes of a great painter. Also of considerable importance to the young Matisse were the techniques and systematic visual language of Pointillism, which had been spearheaded by his fellow countrymen Georges Seurat, Paul Signac, and Henri-Edmond Cross. Although Matisse did not apply Pointillist theory directly to his own work, the application of tiny dots of paint in varying colors to create a harmonious visual tone was something that fascinated Matisse. His observation of this technique led him to develop \"color structure,\" or large, flat areas of color that established a deliberate, decorative effect and sense of mood. He was also very aware of the Post-Impressionist work of Paul Gauguin, Pierre Bonnard, and \u00c9douard Vuillard, whose integration of solid color and design was a departure from the flickering, momentary effect of Impressionist painting.\n\nSynthesizing all these ideas, Matisse turned away from using subtle hues of mixed paints and began working with bright color, directly from the tube, as a means of conveying emotion. He had been working outdoors since the mid-1890s, and his travels to Corsica and the south of France in 1898 increased his interest in capturing the effect of strong natural light. A summer spent working alongside Signac and Cross at Saint-Tropez on the French Riviera in 1904 gave him a further opportunity to witness their techniques.\n\nFellow Fauves: Derain and de Vlaminck\n\nDuring the same years as Matisse's initial experimentation with Post-Impressionist techniques, the two painters Andr\u00e9 Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck met in 1901 and began sharing a studio in Chatou, a western suburb of Paris. Working closely together, they developed their new mutual interest in bold color and directional brushwork.\n\nMatisse met Derain in 1899, and two years later, through Derain, he met de Vlaminck. As an older and more established artist, he supported and encouraged these two kindred spirits, even introducing them to prospective dealers. In 1905 Matisse visited the studio in Chatou, where he was strongly impressed by de Vlaminck's use of pure color. Matisse invited Derain to spend the summer of 1905 with him in Collioure, a port and fishing town located on the southern coast of France. The two men spent this breakthrough summer working and refining their styles and techniques, producing numerous significant paintings during a crucial four-month period of collaboration.\n\nThe 1905 Salon d'Automne\n\nLater that year, the Salon d'Automne exhibition was held at the Grand Palais in Paris. Matisse, Derain, and de Vlaminck all exhibited works in this show; they were joined by other former students of Moreau, including Henri Manguin and Albert Marquet. The paintings on display were quite distinctive in their use of vivid, saturated color and spontaneous brushwork. Also included in the exhibition was a more traditional-looking sculptural bust by Albert Marque, and this figure's proximity to the garishly colored, energetically executed paintings prompted the critic Louis Vauxcelles to describe the scene as \"Donatello parmi les fauves\" (\"Donatello among the wild beasts\"). The term \"Fauves\" was thus coined for these artists; although it was pejorative in its original context, it endured.\n\nFauvism: Concepts, Styles, and Trends\n\nAn Expanding Circle\n\nDespite initial hostility from critics, many of the Fauves enjoyed commercial success following the Salon d'Automne exhibition of 1905. Their art was featured at additional exhibits held over the following years, notably at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in 1907, where the main attraction was a large room dubbed \"The Fauves' Den.\" Meanwhile, other artists began to join the central trio of Matisse, Derain, and de Vlaminck. The expanding group of Fauves (all based in France) eventually included Othon Friesz, Georges Rouault (another student of Gustave Moreau), Kees van Dongen, Georges Braque, and Raoul Dufy. These artists traveled together, shared studios, and exchanged ideas freely during the rather brief heyday of Fauvism.\n\nThe Primacy of Color\n\nAll the Fauves were intensely preoccupied with color as a means of personal expression. Color and the combination of colors constituted the intrinsic subject, form, and rhythm of their work. A sky could be orange, a tree could be blue, a face could be a combination of seemingly clashing colors; the end result was a wholly independent product of the artist's perception, rather than a faithful depiction of the original physical form. Additionally, compositional elements were built up through the placement of color, rather than through perspectival systems or draftsmanship.\n\nSubject and Style\n\nIn their shared preoccupation with expression through color and form, these artists were generally less concerned with the novelty of their subject matter. Whereas the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists had depicted scenes of modern, urban life, such as the boulevards, caf\u00e9s, and concert halls of Paris, the Fauves took more traditional subjects as their starting points. Their subject matter drew from the world around them and included portraits, landscapes, seascapes, and figures in interiors, but the visual impact of the color composition took primacy over any possible narrative or symbolism. Instead, they used their subjects as vehicles for the acts of observation and painting, with their active brushwork and non-naturalistic color as means of leading the viewer into their inner, creative journeys.\n\nLater Developments - After Fauvism\n\nThe Fauves' tendency to distort form and color in order to express inner sensations was a strong influence on the Expressionists, whose own artistic movement proved much longer-lived and more cohesive. The German Expressionists, led by such artists as Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, employed a similarly aggressive use of color in their bustling Berlin street scenes and frequently grotesque portraiture.\n\nC\u00e9zanne and Cubism\n\nIn a sense, Fauvism's demise can be also attributed to a renewal of interest in C\u00e9zanne. A C\u00e9zanne exhibition held in Paris in 1907 revived attention in the artist's work, particularly his emphasis on natural order and structure. Georges Braque, for example, began to favor a more restricted color palette, focusing more on subtle gradations of color and scale. This approach led Braque to fill his canvases with a crowded yet carefully ordered abundance of shapes and forms, as in his 1908 work Road near L'Estaque, which is unmistakably a crucial precursor to the artist's development of the Cubist style.\n\nAfrican Art\n\nIn another interesting crossover during this era, the Fauves' and Pablo Picasso's circles were both interested in African art. Matisse's travelled to Morocco acquired new ideas about color and pattern that surfaced in works like The Green Line (Portrait of Madame Matisse) (1905) and Blue Nude (Souvenir of Biskra) (1907), with their radically simplified features and angular limbs inspired by African sculpture. This use of non-Western artistic sources also had a profound influence on the younger Picasso; he began to incorporate African and Iberian masks into his own work, including in a number of self-portraits and in the iconic Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907).\n\nBy 1908 the Fauves were individually venturing in separate directions: Braque began developing Cubism alongside Picasso, Derain briefly flirted with Cubism as well, and de Vlaminck darkened both his palette and subject matter. Meanwhile, other artists in the group, such as Marquet, Dufy, and Rouault, had begun to work in other styles.\n\nAftermath\n\nUltimately, the Fauves joined together for a short but highly consequential episode, rather than a fully defined school. Although they never produced a group manifesto outlining their artistic aims, Matisse's \"Notes of a Painter,\" written in 1908, formalized many of their shared concerns and goals, including their commitment to personal expression and individual instinct, their use of color as an independent visual element with an emotional effect, and their rethinking of composition as pictorial surface. Even after the dissolution of the group, nearly as soon as it gained its infamous nickname, Fauvism's ideas and landmark works would continue to influence art for decades to come.\n\nUseful Resources on Fauvism\n\nSimilar Art"}, {"url": "https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/fauv/hd_fauv.htm", "page_content": "Fauvism was the first of the avant-garde movements that flourished in France in the early years of the twentieth century. The Fauve painters were the first to break with Impressionism as well as with older, traditional methods of perception. Their spontaneous, often subjective response to nature was expressed in bold, undisguised brushstrokes and high-keyed, vibrant colors directly from the tube.\n\nHenri Matisse (1869\u20131954) and Andr\u00e9 Derain (1880\u20131954) introduced unnaturalistic color and vivid brushstrokes into their paintings in the summer of 1905, working together in the small fishing port of Collioure on the Mediterranean coast (1975.1.194; 1982.179.29). When their pictures were exhibited later that year at the Salon d\u2019Automne in Paris (Matisse, The Woman with a Hat, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art), they inspired the witty critic Louis Vauxcelles to call them fauves (\u201cwild beasts\u201d) in his review for the magazine Gil Blas. This term was later applied to the artists themselves.\n\nThe Fauves were a loosely shaped group of artists sharing a similar approach to nature, but they had no definitive program. Their leader was Matisse, who had arrived at the Fauve style after earlier experimenting with the various Post-Impressionist styles of Van Gogh, Gauguin, and C\u00e9zanne, and the Neo-Impressionism of Seurat, Cross, and Signac. These influences inspired him to reject traditional three-dimensional space and seek instead a new picture space defined by the movement of color planes (1999.363.38; 1999.363.41).\n\nAnother major Fauve was Maurice de Vlaminck (1876\u20131958), who might be called a \u201cnatural\u201d Fauve because his use of highly intense color corresponded to his own exuberant nature. Vlaminck took the final step toward embracing the Fauve style (1999.363.84; 1999.363.83) after seeing the second large retrospective exhibition of Van Gogh\u2019s work at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in the spring of 1905, and the Fauve paintings produced by Matisse and Derain in Collioure.\n\nAs an artist, Derain occupied a place midway between the impetuous Vlaminck and the more controlled Matisse. He had worked with Vlaminck in Chatou, near Paris, intermittently from 1900 on and spent the summer of 1905 with Matisse in Collioure. In 1906\u20137, he also painted some twenty-nine scenes of London in a more restrained palette (1999.363.18).\n\nOther important Fauves were Kees van Dongen, Charles Camoin, Henri-Charles Manguin, Othon Friesz, Jean Puy, Louis Valtat, and Georges Rouault. These were joined in 1906 by Georges Braque and Raoul Dufy.\n\nFor most of these artists, Fauvism was a transitional, learning stage. By 1908, a revived interest in Paul C\u00e9zanne\u2019s vision of the order and structure of nature had led many of them to reject the turbulent emotionalism of Fauvism in favor of the logic of Cubism. Braque became the cofounder with Picasso of Cubism. Derain, after a brief flirtation with Cubism, became a widely popular painter in a somewhat neoclassical manner. Matisse alone pursued the course he had pioneered, achieving a sophisticated balance between his own emotions and the world he painted (1984.433.16).\n\nThe Fauvist movement has been compared to German Expressionism, both projecting brilliant colors and spontaneous brushwork, and indebted to the same late nineteenth-century sources, especially the work of Vincent van Gogh. The French were more concerned with the formal aspects of pictorial organization, while the German Expressionists were more emotionally involved in their subjects."}, {"url": "https://www.artlex.com/art-movements/fauvism/", "page_content": "What is Fauvism?\n\nFauvism was an art movement that flourished in France from 1905 to 1908. It was led by Henri Matisse (1869 \u2013 1954) and Andr\u00e9 Derain (1880 \u2013 1954). Other important Fauvists were Maurice de Vlaminck, Henri Charles Manguin, Othon Friesz, Kees van Dongen, Georges Braque, and Raoul Dufy. Their work was characterized by painterly qualities, a saturated color palette, and simplified forms. Pure, vivid colors were fiercely applied to the canvas with short brush strokes, providing a strong and immediate visual impression of the work. The name Fauvism comes from a derogatory comment of art critic Louis Vauxcelles after he saw paintings by Matisse and his fellow artists at the 1905 Salon d\u2019Automne in Paris. Vauxcelles described their works and the unconventional use of paint and brushwork akin to the \u201cwild beast\u201d (\u201cles fauves\u201d in French).\n\nNotable Fauvist Artworks\n\nCharacteristics of Fauvism\n\nInitially, Fauvism was inspired by the Post-impressionism of Van Gogh and Paul C\u00e9zanne and the Neo-impressionism of Seurat and Signac. The Fauvists adopted their painterly approach to painting directly from nature and their extensive use of complementary colors. However, unlike their predecessors who were engaged in the color theory exploring optical effects of colors, the Fauvists were less interested in science and representation and more in communicating the artist\u2019s emotional response to subjects through color. They experimented with the expressive potential of color using bright, unblended colors applied thickly to the canvas, often directly from the paint tube, in an arbitrary manner with spontaneous, short brush strokes. They simplified forms and distorted perspectives creating a new pictorial space that was defined by anti-naturalism.\n\nMatisse and Derain introduced this new painterly approach in the summer of 1905 while working together in a small village called Collioure in the South of France. They exhibited their works at the Salon d\u2019Automne in Paris the same year and shocked the visitors with the new painting style. On this occasion, the term \u201cfauves\u201d was first used by Louis Vauxcelles to describe the unconventional art he saw. Although derogatory, the painters proudly accepted the name.\n\nFauvism\u2019s Contribution to Modern Art\n\nFauvism was the first of the avant-garde movements of the twentieth century that pushed art away from naturalistic representation. Fauvists separated color from its descriptive purpose and instead emphasized its emotional value, allowing it to exist as an independent element within the painting without being true to nature. They were also one of the first painters to make a move towards abstraction. These developments paved the way for a series of subsequent art movements such as Cubism, Expressionism, and Abstract Art. After 1908, some of the Fauvists, like Braque and Derain, headed towards Cubism, while Vlaminck turned to Expressionism. Only Matisse, the leader of the movement, remained faithful to the Fauvist sensibility for the rest of his career.\n\nNotable Fauvists\n\nAlbert Aurier (1865\u20131892)\n\nAlbert Gleizes (1881\u20131953)\n\nAlbert Marque (1872\u20131939)\n\nAlbert Marquet (1875\u20131947)\n\nAlice Bailly (1872\u20131938)\n\nAmedeo Modigliani (1884\u20131920)\n\nAndr\u00e9 Derain (1880\u20131954)\n\nAndr\u00e9 Lhote (1885\u20131962)\n\nB\u00e9la Iv\u00e1nyi-Gr\u00fcnwald (1867\u20131940)\n\nCharles Camoin (1879\u20131965)\n\nErnst Ludwig Kirchner (1880\u20131938)\n\nEug\u00e8ne Carri\u00e8re (1849\u20131906)\n\nFrancis Picabia (1879\u20131953)\n\nGeorges Braque (1882\u20131963)\n\nGeorges Rouault (1871\u20131958)\n\nGustave Moreau (1826\u20131898)\n\nHenri Manguin (1874\u20131949)\n\nHenri Matisse (1869\u20131954)\n\nHenri Ottmann (1877\u20131927)\n\nHenriette Tirman (1875\u20131952)\n\nIon Theodorescu-Sion (1882\u20131939)\n\nJ\u00e1nos Mattis-Teutsch (1884\u20131960)\n\nJean Dufy (1888\u20131964)\n\nJean Metzinger (1883\u20131956)\n\nJean Puy (1876\u20131960)\n\nJulian Hatton\n\nKarl Schmidt-Rottluff (1884\u20131976)\n\nKees van Dongen (1877\u20131968)\n\nLouis Valtat (1869\u20131952)\n\nMaggie Laubser (1886\u20131973)\n\nMarc Chagall (1887\u20131985)\n\nMarcel Mouly (1918\u20132008)\n\nMaurice de Vlaminck (1876\u20131958)\n\nMildred Bendall (1891\u20131977)\n\nNade\u017eda Petrovi\u0107 (1873\u20131915)\n\nOthon Friesz (1879\u20131949)\n\nPaul Gauguin (1848\u20131903)\n\nPaul Ranson (1861\u20131909)\n\nPaul S\u00e9rusier (1864\u20131927)\n\nPaul Signac (1863\u20131935)\n\nRaoul Dufy (1877\u20131953)\n\nRobert Antoine Pinchon (1886\u20131943)\n\nRobert Delaunay (1885\u20131941)\n\nRussell T Clement\n\nSonia Lewitska (1880\u20131937)\n\nRelated Art Terms\n\n"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/jean.hugo/3743152", "page_content": "Jean Hugo\n\nartist designer illustrator writer\n\nNovember 19, 1894 (age 89) Paris, France\n\nJean Hugo is mainly known as the author of a great number of sketches and oil or gouache paintings, which are often small sized. He also created illustrations for books, designed theatre sets, and costumes as well as produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo's first published illustration appeared in 1918. It was a monogram for La Sir\u00e8ne publishing house. Then he also illustrated Les Joues en Feu by Raymond Radiguet, Bernouard, in 1920; Pommes d'Anis by Francis Jammes, Emile-Paul, 1923; Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel by Jean Cocteau, NRF, and Les Amis Nouvel by Paul Morand, Au Sans Pareil, both in 1924; Rom\u00e9o et Juliette by Shakespeare, Au Sans Pareil, in 1926, among others. Jean Hugo\u2019s paintings were unique in the artistic world of the 20th century. They maintained an authentic originality while recalling certain avant-garde themes of metaphysical painting or magical realism. At the start of the 1930s, in between various theatrical projects, including Jean Cocteau\u2019s Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel, he produced a series of masterful artworks, such as Solitude (1933). He was interested in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. Many of his paintings were based on the sketches that he created all the time. He used to say that \"inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it.\" L'Imposteur (1931) was a conclusion of Jean Hugo's first artistic period. Around this time he moved from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, after the death of his grandmother. His painting of that period was a masterful assembly of the most important insights he had acquired so far. The lessons of the Italian primitives, of Poussin, of Henri Rousseau, and Picasso, were among the sources of inspiration on which he was constantly drawing. In the middle of the 1930s, Jean Hugo started to use oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. The artist's work witnessed his intention to work outside of present-day currents and fashionable theories. He never took part in the artistic debates and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public. The artist illustrated many limited edition books published between 1948 and 1984 by Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Benoit (PAB), collaborating with such writers as Ren\u00e9 Char, Marcel Jouhandeau, Tristan Tzara and Ren\u00e9 Crevel. Jean Hugo's artworks were widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the United States. Among the most prominent of them were: Jean Hugo and Max Jacob at the Claridge Gallery, London, 1929; Jean Hugo '77 at the Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977; Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau at Sotheby's, London, 1981; Jean Hugo: 1894-1984 at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985; Jean Hugo: a Retrospective at the Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996; Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne at the Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001; Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien at the Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014, etc."}, {"url": "http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/fauvism.htm", "page_content": "Famous Fauvist Painters\n\nThe most important Fauvist Painters were Henri Matisse and Andre Derain (1880-1954), who had both studied together in 1897, together with Derain's close friend Maurice de Vlaminck (1876-1958). Other members of the group - nicknamed fauvettes by Vauxcelles - included the Dutch-born figurative painter Kees van Dongen (1877-1968), the lyrical artist Georges Rouault (1871-1958), the painter of 'waterways' Albert Marquet (1875-1947), the delicate colourist Raoul Dufy (1877-1953), the Cubist-in-waiting Georges Braque (1882-1963), the Le Havre artist Othon Friesz (1879-1949), the Neo-Impressionist Louis Valtat (1869-1952), the versatile Henri-Charles Manguin (1874-1949), the Impressionistic Charles Camoin (1879-1964) another friend of Matisse from Moreau's class at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, and Jean Puy (1876-1960) a participant at the original 1905 Salon d'Automne show.\n\nCharacteristics of Fauvism\n\nA late example of Post-Impressionist painting, Fauvism was the first real avant-garde art of the 20th century, although it had no agenda, no manifesto, no agreed set of aesthetics: just a wide group of friends with similar ideas about painting. Matisse, the eldest, became the leading figure of the group, not least because of his innovative painting Luxe, Calme et Volupte (1904). Its decorative composition and emancipated employment of colour made it (in the words of Raoul Dufy) \"a miracle of imagination produced by drawing and colour.\" In fact the painting borrows heavily from the Neo-Impressionism of Paul Signac (1863-1935) and his predecessor Georges Seurat (1859-91), but it signalled the beginning of a more unrestrained use of colour. Matisse and Derain followed this up with a number of works (landscapes and portraits) painted in Collioure, a small town in the South of France, attracting other artists with their vivid palette (brighter and more direct than anything Pointillism had to offer), and their strong belief in the expressive power of pure colour to evoke emotional feeling.\n\nHistory and Influences\n\nNaturally, Matisse and his friends were not working in a vacuum. First and foremost, they owed a considerable debt to Monet's Impressionism, whose non-naturalist colour schemes had caused such a scandal in the mid-1870s. Without the pathfinding work of Impressionist painters, it is doubtful that Fauvism could have happened in the way it did.\n\nSymbolism, too, was a contributing factor. Many Fauvists had studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts under the great symbolist teacher Gustave Moreau (1826-1898), whose originality had already ruffled their artistic complacency. Neo-Impressionism was another influence, except that Fauvist painters found it too restrained and replaced its harmony with a bolder, more primitive form of expression. Thus the dotted motif was replaced with freely applied wide chunky brushstrokes of pure colour, and compositions were relatively simple, sometimes abstract.\n\nThe work of Paul Gauguin (1848-1903) - still largely unknown to the public - was another important influence, especially for the flat areas of pure colour associated with the style of Synthetism, which he had developed at the Pont-Aven school during the late 1880s, and which he had developed further during the 1890s in his art of the South Seas. Gauguin's seminal retrospective at the 1906 Salon d'Automne was hugely influential on the development of Fauvist-style expressionism. Fauvists also borrowed from Gauguin's primitivism, as well as from both African sculpture and Oceanic art: Matisse, Derain and Vlaminck were among the first painters to collect African statuettes and masks. Vincent van Gogh (1853-90) was another influence, especially on Maurice de Vlaminck. The Dutchman's use of pure colour, allied to a spontaneous rough style of brushwork, soon found its way into Fauvist praxis: an example being Matisse's seminal painting Woman with a Hat (1905), famous for its frenzied brushstrokes and vibrant, unnatural colours.\n\nNOTE: To see how non-naturalist painting like Fauvism opened the door for abstract art, see: Realism to Impressionism (1830-1900).\n\nThe Most Fashionable Style of Painting\n\nAt its famous launch in the Salon d'Automne of 1905, the new style caused shock and incredulity among the art critics and public, but collectors and dealers were much more enthusiastic, and Fauvist paintings rapidly became the most fashionable and desirable works on the market. In addition to French dealers like Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) and Berthe Weill, the new style attracted large foreign buyers including the Russians Ivan Morozov (1871-1921) and Sergei Shchukin (1854-1936): one reason why there are so many Fauvist works in the Hermitage Gallery in Russia.\n\nBy 1906, Fauvism was seen as the ultimate refinement in French painting, and another reminder that Paris remained the undisputed centre of world art. Derain produced a set of London landscapes - featuring the bridges and docks of the River Thames - after similar works by Claude Monet. Except that, while Monet's London paintings had been all about light and atmosphere, Derain's were an unrestrained celebration of colour. Other Fauves, like Kees van Dongen and Albert Marquet began producing some of their best work, while Vlaminck painted his greatest landscapes."}, {"url": "https://study.com/academy/lesson/fauvism-definition-art-characteristics.html", "page_content": "Fauvism was a painting movement focused on personal expression that developed in France during the early 20th century.

The world focused on technology, and since then, cell phones evolved into smart phones, the Internet brought the world closer together, and videos became high definition.\n\nThe start of the 2000s wasn't the first time radical change overtook the world.

But can a group of painters known as wild beasts create paintings you would ever call art?\n\nThe movement in painting that led the charge toward well-known 20th-century painting styles, such as Cubism and Expressionism, was Fauvism. Fauve is French for 'wild beasts,' a name which stuck among the critics who viewed their work. Fauvism was inspired by Post-Impressionism, a 19th-century movement back toward form in painting, and away from the optical realism created by Impressionism. Fauvism was started as a group of loosely associated painters who sought to bring personal expression into their paintings.\n\nOne of the greatest inspirations for the Fauvists was the Post-Impressionist artist Paul Gauguin (1848-1903). Take a look at Gauguin's The Spirit of the Dead Keeps Watch (1892). Do you see how the artist uses color and form to define the woman in the bed? Gauguin believed color could be used to translate emotions beyond words and into objects in paintings.\n\nPaul Gauguin, The Spirit of the Dead Keeps Watch, 1892\n\nOther influences on Fauvism include Post-Impressionist artists Vincent van Gogh and Paul C\u00e9zanne."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-hugo", "page_content": "The great-grandson of Victor Hugo, Jean Hugo was a French painter, illustrator, theatre designer and author.

Painting in Europe no longer had to represent external reality through a series of pictorial conventions \u2013 historical events could be accurately recorded instead through the newer media of photography and film. Changes in the structure of the art market, too, away from the grand public \u2018Salons\u2019 to a system of private galleries and collectors, meant that paintings could be smaller, more personal and more experimental. Artists could respond to the changing reality around them and could also aim to be \u2018modern\u2019: to produce paintings that were innovative and exciting, full of radical new effects and new meanings.\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbolism\n\nSymbolism was a broad artistic movement that encompassed painting, literature, music and theatre in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n\nPost-Impressionist Ideas\n\nPainting associated with the Symbolist movement, such as that by French painter Maurice Denis (1870\u20131943) and his compatriot Paul Gauguin (1848\u20131903), was often based on literary themes, myths and legends, but also on personal fantasy and dream. Denis philosophized that the need for realism in art could be downplayed in favour of the effects of line and colour. His paintings were of recognizable subjects \u2013 religious scenes, women in forest settings, bathers \u2013 but depicted in heightened, unreal colours bounded by flowing, decorative contours.\n\nGauguin, too, became increasingly dissatisfied with the purely visual emphasis of the Impressionist movement, and tried to introduce a greater degree of symbolism and spirituality into his work. He used strong, contrasting colours and dark outlines around the different elements of his compositions, drawing attention away from the subject depicted and towards the artist\u2019s use of paint. Inspired by Japanese prints, he also developed a new style, coupling bold splashes of bright, unmixed colour with simplified, linear designs. Van Gogh (1853\u201390), as mentioned in our previous blog, was another leading Post-Impressionist painter who, like Gauguin, used colours symbolically rather than naturalistically. His emotionally charged works, bold simplifications of form and rejection of the Impressionist observational style helped pave the way for Expressionist art.\n\nArt over Reality\n\nA striking tendency within Symbolist works was a move away from narrative in favour of the evocation of a mood or feeling. A common motif in Symbolist painting is a group of figures who do not interact in any straightforward way, whose eyes do not meet and whose gestures and gazes suggest that each one is lost in their own private reverie. The arrangement of a Symbolist composition can thus seem more artificial than truthful. In the works of Gauguin and Denis, this sense of artificiality is heightened by an emphasis on colour and line and on the ways in which different parts of the painting relate to one another within an overall \u2018pattern\u2019.\n\nFauvism\n\nThe Symbolist interest in colour as an evocative element in its own right was crucial to the development of the young French painter Henri Matisse (1869\u20131954).\n\nLuxe, calme et volupt\u00e9\n\nA dominant figure in the Fauvist movement, Matisse learned a great deal from Gustave Moreau (1826\u201398), a Symbolist painter with a taste for exotic colouring. After trips to the Mediterranean, Matisse began to employ more vivid colours in his own paintings; using them to create an emotional impact, rather than simply to transcribe nature. He met the artists Andr\u00e9 Derain (1880\u20131954) and Maurice de Vlaminck (1876\u20131958) in 1899, and they gradually evolved a style that involved a radical and often savage use of contrasting colours. In the autumn of 1905, an exhibition of their works earned them the name \u2018Fauves\u2019 or \u2018wild beasts\u2019. This term, coined by the art critic Louis Vauxcelles (1870\u20131943), was intended as derogatory, a response to what he saw as a spontaneous and reckless handling of paint and use of colour. Matisse\u2019s painting Luxe, calme et volupt\u00e9 caused a great stir when it was exhibited at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in 1905, and is now seen as one of the key Fauvist works. The piece took its title from a refrain in a poem by Charles Baudelaire (1821\u201367), who was himself a Symbolist. The subject matter was ostensibly serene and restful \u2013 a lunch party on the beach \u2013 but Matisse\u2019s handling of the paint and treatment of the human figure were expressive and almost violent.\n\nExpression Through Colour\n\nFauvism was characterized by a primitive style in which intense colours were used, often to create deliberate clashes. This technique completely freed colour from its depictive role, so that it could be truly expressive. Derain produced landscapes full of striking contrasting colours, reds and greens, which appeared to have been painted very freely and quickly, while Vlaminck aimed to express himself instinctively, after the model of Van Gogh. The Fauves generally chose traditional subject matter in their paintings \u2013 landscapes, nudes and portraits \u2013 which they made modern through their radical treatment. A powerful example of this is Matisse\u2019s 1905 portrait of his wife, whose composition is brought to life by a bold green stripe extending down from her forehead and along her nose.\n\nExpressionism\n\nPersonal and Emotive\n\nThe move into Expressionism signified a shift towards the subjective experience of a piece of art \u2013 paintings became immensely expressive psychological profiles, rather than realistic, objective depictions. Their content involved skewed forms, emotive imagery, and fertile ground for individual interpretation. One early painter associated with the changing focus was James Ensor (1860\u20131949), whose work marked the transition from Symbolism to Expressionism. He was an early contributor to the Symbolist aesthetic through his use of corpses, grotesque masks and skeletons painted in garish colours, and his painting Christ\u2019s Entry into Brussels in 1889 is widely considered as a precursor to Expressionsim.\n\nThe Norwegian painter Edvard Munch (1863\u20131944) was a leading figure of the Expressionist movement. He studied in Christiania (now Oslo) and travelled in Germany, Italy and France before settling in Oslo. During his time in Paris (1908) he came under the influence of Gauguin and had immense sympathy for Van Gogh due to the bouts of mental illness that both of them suffered. Life, love and death are the themes that he endlessly explored in his paintings, rendered in an Expressionist symbolic style. His use of swirling lines and strident colours emphasize the angst that lies behind his paintings.\n\nDie Br\u00fccke\n\nThe movement known as Die Br\u00fccke (\u2018the Bridge\u2019) took its inspiration from the work of Van Gogh and Munch, as well as from the art of African cultures. The group was formed in 1905 by the German artist Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880\u20131938) and his fellow students Erich Heckel (1883\u20131970) and Karl Schmidt-Rottluf (1884\u20131976).\n\nThe group sought to give direct expression to human feelings, and the name signified the fact that they spanned the art of the past and present, and derived inspiration from a variety of disparate sources. They painted portraits and landscapes in bright colours with large, simplified forms, and were drawn to depictions of nudes in outdoor settings, suggesting a return to nature and to basic origins.\n\nThe term \u2018Expressionism\u2019 was first used in 1911, primarily in relation to art in France, and then to refer to the painters of Die Br\u00fccke, who by 1913 had drifted apart. It would continue to be applied to the work of artists like the Austrian Oskar Kokoschka (1886\u20131980) and the German painter Max Beckmann (1884\u20131950). Beckmann translated his traumatic experience during the First World War into distorted self-portraits and figure scenes, such as his disturbing vision of torture and murder The Night (1918\u201319). His later paintings depicted circus performers, with himself as clown or king, reflecting the anxiety caused by the social events that surrounded him. The artist Egon Schiele (1890\u20131918) developed a particularly stark style of Expressionism \u2013 distinguished by figures, often naked and usually emaciated \u2013 with harsh outlines, filling the canvas with contorted limbs and anguished features. A disciple of Sigmund Freud, Schiele sought to explore the deeper recesses of the human psyche, especially the sexual aspects.\n\nDer Blaue Reiter\n\nThe use of painting as a means of communicating personal experience and emotion \u2013 a central aim of the Expressionists \u2013 was manifested in a more subtle and controlled way in the work of the painters of the Munich-based group Der Blaue Reiter (\u2018the blue rider\u2019). In an almanac published in 1912, the Blauer Reiter artists, including Franz Marc (1880\u20131916), Wassily Kandinsky (1866\u20131944) and Paul Klee (1879\u20131940), put forward their vision of new ways of self-expression, including art, design, poetry and music. Kandinsky\u2019s painting, inspired by Fauvism, began to focus less on subject matter than on the lyrical force of colour and the strokes of his brush, seeking to communicate with the viewer in a direct and spontaneous way in the manner of a piece of music. Kandinsky\u2019s works of 1910 to 1914, such as Improvisation No. 23, are considered to be the first abstract paintings of the twentieth century.\n\nConfrontational, personal and emotive, Expressionist paintings and their roots in the ideals brought by Symbolism and Fauvism mark an exciting journey towards Modern Art. If you\u2019re interested in the radical works that helped shape the Expressionist movement, then be sure to take a look at our luxury journals: our selection includes Egon Schiele\u2019s Seated Woman, Van Gogh\u2019s Sunflowers, and of course, Munch\u2019s iconic Scream (see here).\n\nLinks"}], "Jean Hugo was associated with the art movement of Cubism.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/Cubism", "page_content": "Hear art curator William S. Rubin discussing seminal influences on Cubism, especially as developed by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso See all videos for this article\n\nCubism, highly influential visual arts style of the 20th century that was created principally by the artists Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in Paris between 1907 and 1914. The Cubist style emphasized the flat, two-dimensional surface of the picture plane, rejecting the traditional techniques of perspective, foreshortening, modeling, and chiaroscuro and refuting time-honoured theories that art should imitate nature. Cubist painters were not bound to copying form, texture, colour, and space. Instead, they presented a new reality in paintings that depicted radically fragmented objects.\n\nCubism derived its name from remarks that were made by the critic Louis Vauxcelles, who derisively described Braque\u2019s 1908 work Houses at L\u2019Estaque as being composed of cubes. In Braque\u2019s painting, the volumes of the houses, the cylindrical forms of the trees, and the tan-and-green colour scheme are reminiscent of Paul C\u00e9zanne\u2019s landscapes, which deeply inspired the Cubists in their first stage of development (until 1909). It was, however, Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon, painted by Picasso in 1907, that presaged the new style; in this work, the forms of five female nudes become fractured, angular shapes. As in C\u00e9zanne\u2019s art, perspective is rendered through colour, with the warm reddish-browns advancing and the cool blues receding.\n\nBritannica Quiz Everything in Art and Design (Part Three) Quiz\n\nThe movement\u2019s development from 1910 to 1912 is often referred to as Analytical Cubism. During this period, the work of Picasso and Braque became so similar that their paintings are almost indistinguishable. Analytical Cubist paintings by both artists show the breaking down, or analysis, of form. Picasso and Braque favoured right-angle and straight-line construction, though occasionally some areas of their paintings appear sculptural, as in Picasso\u2019s Girl with a Mandolin (1910). They simplified their colour schemes to a nearly monochromatic scale (hues of tan, brown, gray, cream, green, or blue were preferred) in order not to distract the viewer from the artist\u2019s primary interest\u2014the structure of form itself. The monochromatic colour scheme was suited to the presentation of complex, multiple views of the object, which was reduced to overlapping opaque and transparent planes. These planes appear to move beyond the surface of the canvas rather than to recede in depth. Forms are generally compact and dense in the centre of an Analytical Cubist painting, growing larger as they diffuse toward the edges of the canvas, as in Picasso\u2019s Portrait of Ambroise Vollard (1909\u201310). In their work from this period, Picasso and Braque frequently combined representational motifs with letters; their favourite motifs were musical instruments, bottles, pitchers, glasses, newspapers, and the human face and figure.\n\nInterest in this subject matter continued after 1912, during the phase generally identified as Synthetic Cubism. Works of this phase emphasize the combination, or synthesis, of forms in the picture. Colour assumes a strong role in these works; shapes, while remaining fragmented and flat, are larger and more decorative. Smooth and rough surfaces may be contrasted with one another, and frequently foreign materials, such as newspapers or tobacco wrappers, are pasted on the canvas in combination with painted areas. This technique, known as collage, further emphasizes the differences in texture and, at the same time, poses the question of what is reality and what is illusion.\n\nWhile Picasso and Braque are credited with creating this new visual language, it was adopted and further developed by many painters, including Fernand L\u00e9ger, Robert and Sonia Delaunay, Juan Gris, Roger de la Fresnaye, Marcel Duchamp, Albert Gleizes, and Jean Metzinger. Though primarily associated with painting, Cubism also exerted a profound influence on 20th-century sculpture and architecture. The major Cubist sculptors were Alexander Archipenko, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, and Jacques Lipchitz. The adoption of the Cubist aesthetic by the Swiss architect Le Corbusier is reflected in the shapes of the houses he designed during the 1920s."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/jean.hugo/3743152", "page_content": "Jean Hugo\n\nartist designer illustrator writer\n\nNovember 19, 1894 (age 89) Paris, France\n\nJean Hugo is mainly known as the author of a great number of sketches and oil or gouache paintings, which are often small sized. He also created illustrations for books, designed theatre sets, and costumes as well as produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo's first published illustration appeared in 1918. It was a monogram for La Sir\u00e8ne publishing house. Then he also illustrated Les Joues en Feu by Raymond Radiguet, Bernouard, in 1920; Pommes d'Anis by Francis Jammes, Emile-Paul, 1923; Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel by Jean Cocteau, NRF, and Les Amis Nouvel by Paul Morand, Au Sans Pareil, both in 1924; Rom\u00e9o et Juliette by Shakespeare, Au Sans Pareil, in 1926, among others. Jean Hugo\u2019s paintings were unique in the artistic world of the 20th century. They maintained an authentic originality while recalling certain avant-garde themes of metaphysical painting or magical realism. At the start of the 1930s, in between various theatrical projects, including Jean Cocteau\u2019s Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel, he produced a series of masterful artworks, such as Solitude (1933). He was interested in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. Many of his paintings were based on the sketches that he created all the time. He used to say that \"inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it.\" L'Imposteur (1931) was a conclusion of Jean Hugo's first artistic period. Around this time he moved from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, after the death of his grandmother. His painting of that period was a masterful assembly of the most important insights he had acquired so far. The lessons of the Italian primitives, of Poussin, of Henri Rousseau, and Picasso, were among the sources of inspiration on which he was constantly drawing. In the middle of the 1930s, Jean Hugo started to use oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. The artist's work witnessed his intention to work outside of present-day currents and fashionable theories. He never took part in the artistic debates and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public. The artist illustrated many limited edition books published between 1948 and 1984 by Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Benoit (PAB), collaborating with such writers as Ren\u00e9 Char, Marcel Jouhandeau, Tristan Tzara and Ren\u00e9 Crevel. Jean Hugo's artworks were widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the United States. Among the most prominent of them were: Jean Hugo and Max Jacob at the Claridge Gallery, London, 1929; Jean Hugo '77 at the Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977; Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau at Sotheby's, London, 1981; Jean Hugo: 1894-1984 at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985; Jean Hugo: a Retrospective at the Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996; Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne at the Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001; Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien at the Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014, etc."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-hugo", "page_content": "The great-grandson of Victor Hugo, Jean Hugo was a French painter, illustrator, theatre designer and author.

It was the first big, big change. It confused people: they said, 'Things don't look like that!'\"\n\n\"Whether it is Juan Gris taking objects apart, Picasso replacing them with objects of his own invention, or another who replaces conical perspective by a system based on the relations between perpendiculars, all that only goes to show that Cubism was not at all born out of an authoritative theory [mot d'ordre]; that it only marked among a few painters the will to be finished with an art that never ought to have survived the condemnation pronounced upon it by Pascal.\"\n\n\"Enormous enlargements of an object or a fragment give it a personality it never had before, and in this way, it can become a vehicle of entirely new lyric and plastic power.\"\n\n\"It was a tradition to represent a dancer frozen in a chosen position, like a snapshot.

If you go higher, things will look different; if you go lower, again they will look different. It is a point of view.\"\n\nSummary of Cubism\n\nCubism developed in the aftermath of Pablo Picasso's shocking 1907 Les Demoiselles d'Avignon in a period of rapid experimentation between Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Drawing upon Paul Cezanne\u2019s emphasis on the underlying architecture of form, these artists used multiple vantage points to fracture images into geometric forms. Rather than modelled forms in an illusionistic space, figures were depicted as dynamic arrangements of volumes and planes where background and foreground merged. The movement was one of the most groundbreaking of the early-20th century as it challenged Renaissance depictions of space, leading almost directly to experiments with non-representation by many different artists. Artists working in the Cubist style went on to incorporate elements of collage and popular culture into their paintings and to experiment with sculpture.\n\n\n\nA number of artists adopted Picasso and Braque's geometric faceting of objects and space including Fernand L\u00e9ger and Juan Gris, along with others that formed a group known as the Salon Cubists.\n\nKey Ideas & Accomplishments\n\nThe artists abandoned perspective, which had been used to depict space since the Renaissance, and they also turned away from the realistic modeling of figures.\n\nCubists explored open form, piercing figures and objects by letting the space flow through them, blending background into foreground, and showing objects from various angles. Some historians have argued that these innovations represent a response to the changing experience of space, movement, and time in the modern world. This first phase of the movement was called Analytic Cubism.\n\nIn the second phase of Cubism, Synthetic Cubism practicioners explored the use of non-art materials as abstract signs. Their use of newspaper would lead later historians to argue that, instead of being concerned above all with form, the artists were also acutely aware of current events, particularly World War I.\n\nCubism paved the way for non-representational art by putting new emphasis on the unity between a depicted scene and the surface of the canvas. These experiments would be taken up by the likes of Piet Mondrian, who continued to explore their use of the grid, abstract system of signs, and shallow space.\n\nOverview of Cubism\n\nFrom 1907 to 1914 Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso worked so closely together, they dressed alike and joked that they were like the Wright brothers who invented the airplane - Picasso even called Braque \"Wilbourg.\" Braque said, \"The things that Picasso and I said to one another during those years will never be said again, and even if they were, no one would understand them anymore. It was like being roped together on a mountain,\" as the two spearheaded the development of the movement. Beginnings and Development Concepts, Trends, & Related Topics Later Developments and Legacy\n\nArtworks and Artists of Cubism\n\nProgression of Art\n\n1907 Les Demoiselles d'Avignon Artist: Pablo Picasso Picasso's painting was shocking even to his closest artist friends both for its content and for its formal experimentation. The subject matter of nude women was not in itself unusual, but the fact that Picasso painted the women as prostitutes in aggressively sexual postures was novel. Their blatant sexuality was heightened by Picasso's influence from non-Western art that is most evident in the faces of three of the women, which are rendered as mask-like, suggesting that their sexuality is not just aggressive, but also primitive. The unusual formal elements of the painting were also part of its shock value. Picasso abandoned the Renaissance illusion of three-dimensionality, instead presenting a radically flattened picture plane that is broken up into geometric shards. For instance, the body of the standing woman in the center is composed of angles and sharp edges. Both the cloth wrapped around her lower body and her body itself are given the same amount of attention as the negative space around them as if all are in the foreground and all are equally important.\n\n\n\nThe painting was widely thought to be immoral when it was finally exhibited in public in 1916. Braque is one of the few artists who studied it intently in 1907, leading directly to his later collaboration with Picasso. Because it predicted some of the characteristics of Cubism, Les Demoiselles is considered proto or pre-Cubist. Oil on canvas - The Museum of Modern Art, New York 1908 Houses at L'Estaque Artist: Georges Braque In this painting, Braque shows the influence of Picasso's Les Demoiselles of the previous year and the work of Paul C\u00e9zanne. From C\u00e9zanne, he adapted the uni-directional, uniform brushwork, and flat spacing, while from Picasso he took the radical simplification of form and use of geometric shapes to define objects. There is, for example, no horizon line and no use of traditional shading to add depth to objects, so that the houses and the landscape all seem to overlap and to occupy the foreground of the picture plane. As a whole, this work made obvious his allegiance to Picasso's experiments and led to their collaboration. Oil on Canvas - Hermann and Margrit Rupf Foundation, Bern 1909 Violin and Palette Artist: Georges Braque By 1909, Picasso and Braque were collaborating, painting largely interior scenes that included references to music, such as musical instruments or sheet music. In this early example of Analytic Cubism, Braque was experimenting further with shallow spacing by reducing the color palette to neutral browns and grays that further flatten out the space. The piece is also indicative of Braque's attempts to show the same item from different points of view. Some shading is used to create an impression of bas-relief with the various geometric shapes seeming to overlap slightly. Musical instruments such as guitars, violins, and clarinets show up frequently in Cubist paintings, particularly in the works of Braque who trained as a musician. By relying on such repeated subject matter, the works also encourage the viewer to concentrate on the stylistic innovations of Cubism rather than on the specificity of the subject matter. Oil on Canvas - The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York 1911 Tea Time Artist: Jean Metzinger When this painting was shown at the 1911 Salon d'Automne, the critic Andre Salmon dubbed it \"The Mona Lisa of Cubism.\" While Picasso and Braque were dematerializing figures and objects in their works, Metzinger remained committed to legibility, reconciling modernity with classicism, thus Salmon's nickname for the work. Despite the realism of the painting, like other Cubists, Metzinger abandons the single point of view in use since the Renaissance. The female figure and the still life elements are shown from differing angles as if the artist had physically moved around the subject to capture it from different points of view at successive moments in time. The teacup is shown in both profile and from above, while the figure of the centrally positioned woman is shown both straight on and in profile. The painting was reproduced in Metzinger and Gleizes's book Du Cubisme (1912) and in Apollinaire's The Cubist Painters (1913). The work became better known at the time than any work by Picasso or Braque who had removed themselves from the public by not exhibiting at the Salon. For most people in the 1910s, Cubism was associated with artists like Metzinger, rather than its originators Picasso or Braque. Oil on Cardboard - The Philadelphia Museum of Art Artwork Images 1911-12 Ma Jolie Artist: Pablo Picasso Picasso ups the ante in this work, pushing his experiments in new directions. Building on the overlapping, geometric shapes, Picasso moves further away from the Renaissance illusion of three-dimensionality and towards abstraction by reducing color and by increasing the illusion of low-relief sculpture even further than Braque did in Violin and Palette. Most significantly, however, Picasso included painted words on the canvas.\n\n\n\nThe words, \"ma jolie\" not only flatten the space further, but they also liken the painting to a poster because they are painted in a font reminiscent of that used in advertising. This is the first time that an artist had so blatantly used elements of popular culture in a work of high art. This melding of high and low culture may have been influenced by the late-19th-century posters of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. Though they were made as advertisements for various entertainment venues, Toulouse-Lautrec's posters were appreciated as high art, perhaps because he was himself also a painter. Further linking Picasso's work to pop culture and to the everyday, \"Ma Jolie\" was also the name of a popular tune at the time as well as Picasso's nickname for his girlfriend. Oil on Canvas - The Museum of Modern Art, New York Artwork Images 1912 Still Life with Chair Caning Artist: Pablo Picasso By 1912, Picasso and Braque had exhausted their experiments with monochromatic color and with the illusion of low-relief sculpture across the surface of the canvas. In Still Life with Chair Caning, Picasso reintroduces color and goes further into experimentation with multiple perspectives. The image depicts a tabletop at a caf\u00e9; Picasso shows various objects on the table from multiple points of view including the knife, pieces of fruit, and wine glass that are in the top right of the image. Combining both paint and collage, Picasso also incorporates a piece of oilcloth (a cheap tablecloth) that resembles chair caning to reference to the type of seating common in a traditional caf\u00e9. The work is playful in that Picasso conveys the transparent quality of the tabletop by making it appear as if the caning of the chair can be seen through the glass. The spacing in the image, however, is even flatter than in previous works with no shading of objects, thus the caf\u00e9 table is not depicted illusionistically as if in three dimensions, but conceptually.\n\n\n\nFinally, Picasso paints the words \"JOU\" that are both the first three letters of the French word for newspaper (Journal), thus referring both to the act of reading a newspaper at a caf\u00e9 (the folded newspaper itself can be seen on the left), and also spell the first letters of the French word for \"play\", signifying the playfulness and experimental quality of the image. Not only is this the first time that collaged elements were included in a work of high art, but it has been argued that the bits of collaged newspaper reference the unstable political situation in Europe and perhaps Picasso's own anarchist tendencies. Even though this work is now synonymous with Cubist experiments, it was seen by few people at the time because Picasso did not show his works at public exhibits, but rather displayed his ideas to like-minded (avant-garde) collaborators. Oil on canvas - The National Gallery, London 1912 Maquette for Guitar Artist: Pablo Picasso Picasso's experiments with collaged elements encouraged him to reconsider sculpture as well. Rather than a collage, however, Maquette for Guitar is an assemblage (or three-dimensional collage). While traditional sculpture was made up of a mass (or solid) surrounded by a void, using a material such as wood or marble that was then shaped by the hand of the artist, Picasso here takes pieces of cardboard, paper, string, and wire that he then folded, threaded, and glued together. This is the first time that a sculpture had been assembled from disparate parts. Rather than being a solid material, it fluidly integrates mass and its surrounding void. Picasso translated the Cubist interest in multiple perspectives and geometric form into a three-dimensional medium.\n\n\n\nThe work is also groundbreaking in the history of 20th-century sculpture in part because of Picasso's use of non-art materials that, like Ma Jolie, challenge the distinction between high art and popular culture. Paperboard, paper, thread, string, twine, and coated wire - The Museum of Modern Art, New York 1913 Conquest of the Air Artist: Roger de la Fresnaye La Fresnaye's colorful and optimistic paintings did much to popularize Cubism before World War I. In The Conquest of Air, his most famous work, he depicts himself with his brother Henri, sitting at a table outdoors. The yellow hot-air balloon in the distant background likely refers to the oldest balloon race in the world, the Gordon Bennett cup, which took place annually from 1906 to 1938, with breaks during the war years. The race alternated between European cities, but was held first in Paris in 1906 and again in 1913. A French crew won the race in 1912, adding to their national honor in this arena as the French had invented the hot-air balloon in 1783, no doubt explaining the celebratory French flag in the painting.\n\n\n\nLa Fresnaye's work shows influence from both traditional Cubism in its use of geometrical forms and also from Delaunay's Orphism in its bright color and use of the circle. He was a member of La Section d'Or Cubists from 1912-1914, but after the war became a well-known proponent of more traditional realism. Oil on Canvas - The Museum of Modern Art, New York (Not on Display) Artwork Images 1914 Electric Prisms Artist: Sonia Delaunay Robert and Sonia Delaunay exhibited with the Salon Cubists, and later founded the Orphism movement that was heavily influenced by Cubism. Like all Cubists, they used geometric forms and flattened perspective to show visual manipulation of their subject, but the Delaunays in particular had metaphysical interests in color and concept, often overlapping multiple scenes and views to suggest a fourth dimension. This multiplicity of scenes (or so-called theory of simultaneity) proposed that events and objects are \"inextricably connected in time and space.\" Electric Prisms uses the sphere to represent this idea of overlap. In the work, different spheres convene into large concentric circles that are arranged to depict dynamic movement of electricity. Orphism was a short-lived movement but was a key phase in the transition from Cubism to non-representational art. Oil on canvas - Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris 1915 Still Life with Open Window, Rue Ravignan Artist: Juan Gris Of the Salon Cubists, Juan Gris' work is often considered closest to that of Picasso and Braque with whom Gris was in close contact beginning in 1911. By 1914, Gris had developed collage techniques in which he pasted elements from newspapers and magazines onto deconstructed, abstract scenes. His works were sometimes actual collages, but could also be paintings that resembled collages as in Still Life with Open Window. In this work Gris combined interior and exterior views through interlocking elements and subtle shifts in color, including an intense blue that suffuses the work and, like Synthetic Cubism, reintroduces color to the Cubist style. A still life in the foreground features traditional elements such as a book, a carafe, and a bottle of wine on an upturned tabletop. These objects are refracted through shafts of colored light from the open window that bring the neighboring houses and trees into the composition; the interior electric light contrasts with the moonlit scene outside the window. Gris's compositions were more calculating than those of other Cubists. Every element of the grid-like composition was refined to produce an interlocking arrangement without unnecessary detail. Within the grid, Gris balances different areas of the work: light to dark, monochrome to color, and lamplight inside the room to moonlight outside. The viewer has a sense of the still life as it exists in its surroundings. Oil on canvas - National Gallery, Washington DC Artwork Images 1921 Three Women Artist: Fernand L\u00e9ger In Three Women, L\u00e9ger updates the traditional theme of the reclining nude into a modern vocabulary that combines his various influences from Cubism and Futurism. The geometric forms of the figures indicate his Cubist sources, while his reliance on machine-like imagery is borrowed from Futurism. His pristine and colorful geometric forms are, however, much different from the faux low-relief sculptural effects used in Analytic Cubism. The shapes that make up the figures and objects, for example, do not overlap in the foreground, but are used to create an illusion of three-dimensionality. Thus, the furniture, the bodies of the women, and the spaces between them are easily distinguished.\n\n\n\nL\u00e9ger's polished forms can be tied to the interest in classicism or \"return to order\" that was widespread in French art after the chaos of World War I. The machine-like precision and solidity of the objects and figures suggest L\u00e9ger's faith in the modern world and the hope that technological advances and the machine age would together remake the world. L\u00e9ger was badly injured in WWI, yet nevertheless presents a cheerful scene that relies on primary colors to convey his positive mindset about the benefits of modernity and technology, ultimately expressing his faith in the future. Oil on Canvas - The Museum of Modern Art, New York\n\nBeginnings of Cubism\n\nA watershed moment for the development of Cubism was the posthumous retrospective of Paul C\u00e9zanne's work at the Salon d'Automne in 1907. C\u00e9zanne's use of generic forms to simplify nature was incredibly influential to both Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. In the previous year, Picasso was also introduced to non-Western art: seeing Iberian art in Spain, and African-influenced art by Matisse, and at the Trocadero anthropological museum. What drew Picasso to these artistic traditions was their use of an abstract or simplified representation of the human body rather than the naturalistic forms of the European Renaissance tradition.\n\nThe Breakthrough: Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\n\nThese varying influences can be seen in Picasso's groundbreaking work of 1907, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, which is considered a work of proto or pre-Cubism. In its radical distortion of figures, its rendering of volumes as fragmented planes, and its subdued palette, this work predicted some of the key characteristics of later Cubism.\n\nBraque, on seeing Picasso's Les Demoiselles at his studio, intensified his similar explorations in simplification of form. He made a series of landscape paintings in the summer of 1908, including Houses at L'Estaque in which trees and mountains were rendered as shaded cubes and pyramids, resembling architectural forms. Cubism was introduced to the public with Braque's one-man exhibition at Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler's gallery on the rue Vignon in November 1908. It was this exhibit that led French art critic Louis Vauxcelles to describe them as \"bizarreries cubiques,\" thus giving the movement its name.\n\nThe experiments of Picasso and Braque owe much to Kahnweiler, who was the major supporter of their work. Picasso and Braque were both quite poor in 1907 and Kahnweiler offered to buy their works as they painted them, thus freeing the artists from worrying about pleasing patrons or receiving negative reviews. After the 1908 exhibit, with few exceptions, the two artists exhibited only in Kahnweiler's gallery.\n\nThe Cubism of Picasso and Braque\n\nThe close collaboration between Picasso and Braque beginning in 1909 was crucial to the style's genesis. The two artists met regularly to discuss their progress, and at times it became hard to distinguish the work of one artist from another (as they liked it). Both were living in the bohemian Montmartre section of Paris in the years before and during World War I, making their collaboration easy.\n\nIn 1912, Kahnweiler gave his first public interview on Cubism, no doubt in response to growing public interest in (and some recognition of) the movement. When World War I began, Kahnweiler, as a German, was exiled from France. During the war, L\u00e9once Rosenberg became the main dealer for Cubist art in Paris (including those of the Salon Cubists) with his brother Paul Rosenberg serving as Picasso's dealer during the interwar years.\n\nThough Picasso and Braque returned to Cubist forms periodically throughout their careers and there were some exhibitions of work up until 1925, the two-man movement did not last much beyond World War I.\n\nSalon or Section d'Or Cubism\n\nThe Salon Cubists, so-called because they showed their works at public exhibits such as the Salon d'Automne, did not work closely with Picasso and Braque but were influenced by their experiments. It was through the work of the Salon Cubists that the movement became widely known to the public in the early 1910s. These artists included Robert Delaunay, Albert Gleizes, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Juan Gris, Henri Le Fauconnier, Roger de La Fresnaye, and Jean Metzinger. Metzinger and Delaunay, who had been friends at least since 1906, began collaborating with Gleizes as a result of the yearly Salon d'Automne. It was through Gleizes that they met Le Fauconnier who had published Note sur la peinture (1910) in which he praised Picasso and Braque for their \"total emancipation\" of painting.\n\nThese artists exhibited together at the 1911 Salon des Independants, introducing Cubism to the general public. The Independants was a non-juried exhibition where public reaction depended on how and where paintings were hung. The Cubists got control of the hanging committee from the Neo-Impressionists so that their works could be hung together in one room as a coherent school. The paintings created a stir, as Gleizes noted: \"While the newspapers sounded the alarm to alert people to the danger, and while appeals were made to the public authorities to do something about it, song writers, satirists and other men of wit and spirit provoked great pleasure among the leisured classes by playing with the word 'cube', discovering that it was a very suitable vehicle for inducing laughter which, as we all know, is the principle characteristic that distinguishes man from the animals.\"\n\nIn addition to showing their works in large exhibitions, the Salon Cubists were also distinct from Picasso and Braque in that they often worked on a large scale, leading one art historian to coin the term 'Epic Cubism' to distinguish their work from the more intimate paintings of Picasso and Braque. While they broke apart objects and bodies into geometric forms like those of Picasso and Braque, the Salon Cubists did not challenge Renaissance conceptions of space to the same extent nor did they embrace the monochromatic color of Analytic Cubism or the collage elements of Synthetic Cubism.\n\nAt the end of 1911 Gleizes and Metzinger, who lived closely together in the Parisian suburbs, and others in the group began meeting in Puteaux, a suburb where the painter and engraver Jacques Villon and his brother, the sculptor Raymond Duchamp-Villon had their studios (leading to them sometimes being called the Puteaux group). It is likely as a result of these meetings that the main ideas for Metzinger and Gleizes' On Cubism (1912) were formalized; it was the first published statement about the style.\n\nThe next year the group also planned the launch of the Salon de la Section d'Or (1912) that would bring together the most radical currents in painting. The term Section d'Or was a name the Salon Cubists adopted to show their attachment to the golden mean, i.e. the belief in order and the importance of mathematical proportions in their works that reflected those in nature. The Section d'Or exhibit was held after the 1912 Salon d'Automne at the Galerie La Boetie. It was at this exhibit that the poet and art critic Guillaume Apollinaire coined the term Orphism to refer to the work of Delaunay. The next year Apollinaire published Aesthetic Meditations: The Cubist Painters (1913). These many exhibits and publications were calculated to make an impact, both in Paris and abroad.\n\nAs with the Cubism of Picasso and Braque, the Salon or Section d'Or group did not continue coherently after WWI, having only sporadic exhibits between 1918 and 1925.\n\nSalon Cubism Movement Page\n\nCubism: Concepts, Styles, and Trends\n\nThe various stages of development in the Cubist style are based on the work of Picasso and Braque rather than on those of the Salon Cubists. The exact names and dates of the stages are debated and continually reframed to this day.\n\nEarly Cubism (1908-09)\n\nThis early phase of the movement came in the wake of the Paul C\u00e9zanne retrospective in 1907 when many artists were reintroduced or introduced for the first time to the work of C\u00e9zanne, who had been living in Aix-en-Provence in the south of France before his death and had not exhibited in Paris for many years. Several artists who saw the retrospective were influenced by his lack of three-dimensionality, the material quality of his brushwork, and his use of uniform brushstrokes. Braque's Houses at L'Estaque (1908) is a good example of this type of Cubism.\n\nAnalytic Cubism (1910-12)\n\nIn this phase, Cubism developed in a highly systematic fashion. Later to be known as the Analytic period of the style, it was based on close observation of objects in their background contexts, often showing them from various vantage points. Picasso and Braque restricted their subject matter to the traditional genres of portraiture and still life and also limited their palette to earth tones and muted grays in order to lessen the clarity between the fragmented shapes of figures and objects. Although their works were often similar in appearance, their separate interests showed through over time. Braque tended to show objects exploding out or pulled apart into fragments, while Picasso rendered them magnetized, with attracting forces compelling elements of the pictorial space into the center of the composition. Works in this style include Braque's Violin and Palette (1909) and Picasso's Ma Jolie (1911-12).\n\nTowards the end of this stage of Cubism, Juan Gris began to make contributions to the style: he maintained a sharp clarity to his forms, provided suggestions of a compositional grid, and introduced more color to what had been an austere, monochromatic style.\n\nAnalytic Cubism - Definition Page\n\nSynthetic Cubism (1912-14)\n\nIn 1912 both Picasso and Braque began to introduce foreign elements into their compositions, continuing their experiments with multiple perspectives. Picasso incorporated wall paper that imitated chair caning into Still Life with Chair-Caning (1912), thus initiating Cubist collage, and Braque began to glue newspaper to his canvases, beginning the movement's exploration of papier-colle. In part this may have resulted from the artists' growing discomfort with the radical abstraction of Analytic Cubism, though it could also be argued that these Synthetic experiments touched off an even more radical turn away from Renaissance depictions of space, and towards a more conceptual rendering of objects and figures. Picasso's experiments with sculpture are also included as part of the Synthetic Cubist style as they employ collaged elements.\n\nSynthetic Cubism - Definition Page\n\nCrystal Cubism (1915-22)\n\nAs a response to the chaos of war, there was a tendency among many French artists to pull back from radical experimentation; this inclination was not unique to Cubism. One art historian has described this stage of Cubism as the \"end product of a progressive closing down of possibilities.\" In L\u00e9ger's Three Women (1921), for example, the depicted subjects are hard-edged rather than resembling overlapping bits of low-relief sculpture; L\u00e9ger also did not attempt to show objects from various angles. Crystal Cubism is associated with Salon Cubism as well as with the works of Picasso and Braque. Crystal Cubism is part of the larger trend known as a Return to Order (also known as Interwar Classicism) that was associated with artists in the School of Paris.\n\nLater Developments - After Cubism\n\nCubism spread quickly throughout Europe in the 1910s, as much because of its systematic approach to rendering imagery as for the openness it offered in depicting objects in new ways. Critics were split over whether Cubists were concerned with representing imagery in a more objective manner - revealing more of its essential character - or whether they were principally interested in distortion and abstraction.\n\nThe movement lies at the root of a host of early-20th century styles including Constructivism, Futurism, Suprematism, Orphism, and De Stijl. Many important artists went through a Cubist phase in their development, perhaps the most notable of whom was Marcel Duchamp whose notorious Nude Descending a Staircase (1912) garnered much attention and many negative reviews at the 1913 Armory Show in New York City.\n\nThe ideas in the movement also fed into more popular phenomena, like Art Deco design and architecture. Later movements such as Minimalism were also influenced by the Cubist use of the grid, and it is difficult to imagine the development of non-representational art without the experiments of the Cubists. Like other paradigm changing artistic movements of 20th-century art, like Dada and Pop, Cubism shook the foundations of traditional artmaking by turning the Renaissance tradition on its head and changing the course of art history with reverberations that continue into the postmodern era.\n\nUseful Resources on Cubism\n\nSimilar Art"}, {"url": "https://artincontext.org/cubism-art-movement/", "page_content": "Although you may not be familiar with the intricacies of the Cubism art movement, you are bound to be aware of its key players like Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and Robert Delaunay. The beginning of the 20th century saw an explosion in artistic exploration, with Cubism playing an influential role in this process. In this article, we will attempt to present a Cubism definition, explore the roots of the Cubist movement, trace its developments over the first half of the 20th century, and get to know some of the most influential Cubist artists and their work.\n\nWhat Is Cubism?\n\nCubism is an art movement that emerged out of a collaboration between Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in France at the turn of the 20th century. Building on the geometric abstraction of the Fauvism movement , Cubism broke many of the rules of traditional western art styles. Fauvism had already laid the groundwork by experimenting with bright and unexpected colors, a great example being the paintings of Franz Marc.\n\nThe Cubism art movement remains incredibly influential today, boasting more books on its subject than any other art movement. Cubism was and is a revolutionary movement, and you will find that its influences reach as far as architecture and sculpture.\n\nThe Features of Cubist Paintings\n\nThe two most distinct features of Cubist paintings are the use of an abstract, \u201cfour-dimensional\u201d perspective and the fragmentation of scenes and people into geometric shapes.\n\nWhen you look at a photograph or a scene in real life, you are viewing the scene from a single perspective. All of the objects within the frame fit together relative to this single perspective. The traditional western style of painting has long attempted to mirror this single perspective perfectly, giving the viewer the impression that they are looking directly at the scene behind the work of art. Traditional artists use shading and highlights to mirror the depth of the three-dimensional scene on the two-dimensional canvas.\n\nStill Life before an Open Window, Place Ravignan (1915) by Juan Gris; Philadelphia Museum of Art, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe most distinct feature of Cubism is that it completely disregards this single three-dimensional perspective. The objects within the scene are fragmented into a multitude of different geometric components, each representing the objects from a slightly different perspective (from the left, the right, the top, or the bottom). The artists then arrange each fragment on the canvas to present the subject of the painting from many different perspectives at the same time.\n\nIf you take Picasso\u2019s Weeping Woman, for example, you can see that you are looking at a woman\u2019s face and that she is crying, but you cannot quite determine the direction from which you are looking at her. Are you looking at her head-on or from one side?\n\nCubist paintings represent a multitude of different perspectives within one picture. Rather than representing three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional canvas, cubist artists represent what is called the \u201cfourth dimension.\u201d\n\nAnother distinct feature of the cubist art movement is the hard-edged geometric shapes that make up the compositions. Deriving its name from the Latin word for a cube, Cubism breaks images and objects down into fragments of squares, cones, spheres, pyramids, and other geometric shapes. There are three distinct periods within the Cubism art movement: Analytical Cubism, Synthetic Cubism, and Orphic Cubism.\n\nStill Life with a Guitar (1913) by Juan Gris; Juan Gris, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe History of the Cubism Art Movement\n\nPablo Picasso is often regarded as the father of the Cubism movement, beginning with his painting, Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon, which he finished in 1907. This piece depicts the fragmented bodies of five prostitutes. A lot of the influence for this piece came from African tribal art, which Picasso had seen at the Palais du Trocadero, an ethnographic museum in Paris. This period of Picasso\u2019s artistic career was known as his \u201cAfrican phase\u201d and the work he did here was integral to the Cubist movement. This piece also took influence from the work of Paul C\u00e9zanne, whom Picasso had studied intently.\n\nGeorges Braque met Picasso in 1907, and initially, he did not like Les Demoiselle d\u2019Avignon. However, over the next year, Braque and Picasso realized that their works from the past few years were becoming increasingly similar. The two artists began a close collaboration that lasted until 1915, in which they worked together to establish Cubism as a distinct art movement.\n\nIt was in 1908 that Louis Vauxcelles, an art critic, first used the word \u201ccubist\u201d to describe one of Braque\u2019s paintings. Although used rather mockingly, the name stuck, and the Cubism art movement was born.\n\nNature morte aux pommes (\u2018Still life with basket of apples\u2019, c.1906) by Georges Braque. According to art historians, seven paintings from 1906 have been destroyed by Braque, making this still life especially rare.\u200b The work\u2019s composition is a tribute \u200bto\u200b C\u00e9zanne\u2019s The Basket of Apples (1893), which has been a critical influence on Braque\u2019s artistic development; Emmanuel benador, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nAnother influential artist by the name of Andre Derain took an interest in the collaboration between Picasso and Braque. While much like Braque\u2019s initial reaction to Picasso\u2019s Demoiselle d\u2019Avignon, people did not respond positively to this new genre at first, it was soon that several artists including Robert Delaunay, Fernand Leger, and Marcel Duchamp, began to call themselves \u201cCubists.\u201d\n\nEach artist influenced the Cubism art movement with their unique style, with some members moving so far towards total abstraction that even Picasso and Braque did not approve.\n\nJuan Gris, a studio neighbor of Picasso, began to take an active interest in Cubism in 1911. Alongside Braque and Picasso, Gris was influential in the sub-genre of synthetic Cubism. Gris, however, attempted to take a more theoretical approach to Cubism than either Picasso or Braque.\n\nThe Cubism art movement did not last long, however, gradually dissolving at the start of the First World War in 1914. Many of the key artists, including Braque and Derain, were recruited for military service, and in 1915, Braque was the victim of a brain injury. Although he survived, the injury caused the breakdown of his and Picasso\u2019s collaboration and friendship.\n\nAlthough Picasso and Braque are typically the most well-known proponents of the Cubism art movement, it continued to be developed by several other artists. Artists like Juan Gris, Marcel Duchamp, Jean Metzinger, Roger de la Fresnaye, Fernand Leger, as well as Sonia and Robert Delaunay continued to experiment with Cubist ideas.\n\nJean Metzinger (1906) by Robert Delaunay; Robert Delaunay, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Analytical Cubism Period\n\nThe analytical Cubism period represented the early phases of the Cubism art movement between 1908 and 1912. The term originates from the organized dissection of the subject of study by viewpoint. The resulting pieces consist of fragmented imagery, with overlapping planes and multiple viewpoints. The focus moved away from cubes, and Braque, Picasso, and Gris began to focus more on small surfaces and planes that were slightly overlapped and delineated by black, white, or colored lines.\n\nOften the image was much denser at the center of the canvas, and the fragments were more scattered towards the edges. The color pallet was much more basic and muted during these early years so as to ensure the viewer was still able to see the image on the canvas. The bright and bold colors that many people associate with the Cubism art movement only began to develop later. An example of an analytical cubist artwork is Glass on a Table, which was completed by Braque in 1910.\n\nDuring the analytical Cubism period, Picasso experimented with material collages using wood, sand, and other textiles. While some sources view these works as part of the synthetic Cubism period, others see them as the first steps towards the mixed media that characterized this later period.\n\nThe Synthetic Cubism Period\n\nAlthough this period of the Cubism art movement lasted for only two years, from around 1912 to 1914, it is distinct from the analytic period before it in several ways.\n\nThe works produced within the synthetic Cubist phase had little pictorial depth, moving away from fragmenting and reassembling a single object. In contrast, artists began to use fragments of different and unrelated subjects to create new and very abstract images.\n\nAnother stark difference to analytic Cubism was the use of bright and bold colors. Juan Gris\u2019 A Pot of Geraniums, which was painted in 1915, demonstrates this shift in the pallet. Finally, the use of mixed-media collages increased dramatically. Using anything from playing cards, cigarette boxes, and sheet music to newsprints, the artists added yet another dimension to the Cubist style.\n\nThe Orphic Cubism Period\n\nThe term \u201cOrphic Cubism\u201d was coined by Guillaume Apollinaire, a French poet, in 1912. This offshoot from the Cubism art movement, spearheaded by Robert Delaunay, was by far the most abstract. Orphism took significant influence from Fauvism in its use of bright, bold, and varied colors.\n\nThe forms in Orphic Cubist paintings were mostly circular, and the compositions combined warm and cold, complementary, and contrasting colors. You can also see a greater focus on the light within these paintings. Many of the Orphic designs were purely abstract and did not consist of any concrete subjects. You can see the distinct style of Orphic Cubism in the works of Sonia and Robert Delaunay.\n\nRythme, Joie de vivre (1930) by Robert Delaunay; Robert Delaunay, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nSix Famous Cubist Artists and Their Work\n\nDue to the relatively short life of the Cubism art movement, there are a relatively small number of influential artists. You may know many of their works but little about the artist behind the brush. Here, we present the six most famous artists within the Cubism art movement and will explore some of their paintings.\n\nPablo Picasso, 1881-1973\n\nOf course, we have to start with Picasso because when you think of Cubism, Picasso is the first thing that comes to mind. Pablo Picasso was born in Malaga, Spain at the end of 1881. His country\u2019s history and culture were a significant influence on Picasso throughout his life and artistic career.\n\nPicasso started his artistic career at a young age, with his first exhibition at around 20 years of age, following exposure to the art trends of the day at the Cafe Els Quatre Gats. Before this exhibition, he attended the Academy of Fine arts in La Lonja.\n\nEarly in Picasso\u2019s career, he was predominantly a post-impressionist artist, and remnants of his impressionist style carried over into his later works. Before Picasso entered his Cubist period in 1908, his style varied from his Blue Period to his Rose Period.\n\nWhile the Cubism art movement is known to have faded out at the start of the First World War, Picasso continued to refine his Cubist style. Guernica, a piece that protested the bombs dropped on villagers in Spain, was completed in 1937 and is commonly thought to represent the pinnacle of Picasso\u2019s Cubist style.\n\nA tiled version of Picasso\u2019s Guernica painting; Tony Hisgett from Birmingham, UK, CC BY 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nPortrait of Ambroise Vollard (1909)\n\nA perfect example of analytic Cubism, this was one of the first Cubist paintings completed by Picasso in 1909. The painting portrays a fragmented and melancholic man in shades of gray and brown, with a touch of yellow in the face.\n\nThe man\u2019s face is most visible in the center, an example of the clustering that is typical of analytic Cubism. Many people failed to recognize Ambroise Vollard as the subject of the painting. A young boy who was the son of Vollard\u2019s friend is said to have recognized the man immediately, however, indicating that despite the abstract form of the painting, Picasso managed to artfully portray the likeness of Vollard.\n\nPortrait of Fernande Oliver (1909)\n\nAnother piece of analytic Cubist portraiture, Picasso also finished this work in 1909. The picture combines the mountain forms influenced by the time he spent there with his mistress with the face of Fernande Oliver. The color pallet of greys and browns is, again, typical of the analytical Cubist style.\n\nGuitars (1912-1914)\n\nGuitars were a fixation for Picasso between 1912 and 1914. Many art historians believe that this series, which included both paintings and sculptures, represents a transition between analytic and synthetic Cubist styles for Picasso.\n\nStill Life with Chair Caning (1912)\n\nThe first of many collages for Picasso, this oval canvas includes a piece of oilcloth with the weave of a cane chair. When you first look at this piece, it is difficult to determine whether this pattern is painted or indeed glued on. Picasso artfully painted over the edges of the printed cloth with his style of Cubism paint, bringing together traditional painting and modern multi-media techniques.\n\nGeorges Braque, 1882-1963\n\nBraque was born in France a year after Picasso in 1882. For much of his youth, Braque took influence from the traditional French styles. His time at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in his late teens reinforced his early impressionist style.\n\nAfter moving to Paris, Braque was influenced dramatically by Fauvian artists, and his shift in style was evident in his 1906 exhibition. During his first solo show in 1908, he first crossed paths with Picasso and so began their close collaboration, which lasted until 1914 when he was drafted for the war effort and received a head injury.\n\nAfter the war, Braque worked alone to develop his style, which was much less structured. During his later years, Braque worked in Paris painting for ballet displays, making lithographs and jewelry while his health remained strong.\n\nStill Life with Glass and Newspaper (1913) by Georges Braque; Richard Mortel from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, CC BY 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nViolin and Jug (1910)\n\nCompleted in 1910, this example of analytical Cubism presents a fragmented composition of a violin and a jug. The multitude of different perspectives is emphasized by the light that hits each fragment from a different angle. As with the original works of Picasso, the color pallet consisted entirely of shades of ochre and brown.\n\nFruit Dish and Glass (1912)\n\nNot a painting but a charcoal drawing, Braque finished this piece in 1912. Braque overlaid the original charcoal drawing with strips of wood-grain wallpaper and letters, making this a perfect example of the move towards synthetic Cubism.\n\nJuan Gris, 1887-1927\n\nBorn Jose Gonzales-Perez in 1887, Juan Gris was a little younger than his peers within the Cubism art movement. Originally, Gris planned a career doing mechanical drawings for growing industries and spent three years studying at the Escuela de Artes y Manufacturas in Madrid.\n\nAfter a brief time spent with the artist Jose Maria Carbonero, Gris started to consider more artistic forms of painting in 1905. Gris moved to Paris a year later, and it was here that he met the likes of Picasso and Braque and started to dabble in Cubism.\n\nIn the lead-up to World War One, Gris spent much of his time with Picasso, Braque, Leger, and Raynal. By 1912, Gris had clearly developed his own Cubist style, and Leonce Rosenberg and D.H. Kahnweiler both sponsored his paintings. Unfortunately, Gris\u2019 artistic flair was short-lived as he died from bad health in the middle of 1927.\n\nPortrait of Pablo Picasso (1912) by Juan Gris; Juan Gris, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nPortrait of Pablo Picasso (1912)\n\nPainted in 1912, Juan Gris\u2019 portrait of Pablo Picasso is a clear example of the analytic Cubist style. A muted color pallet of blues, greys, and pinks brings to life an image of Picasso holding a pallet constructed of different geometric shapes. The portrait of Picasso was one of Gris\u2019 last analytical Cubist works, as from 1913 he began to focus on the synthetic style. Well-known pieces from this period of his career include Harlequin with Guitar, Fantomas, and The Blind.\n\nPaul Klee, 1879-1940\n\nBorn in 1879, Paul Klee was a Swiss-German artist with a distinct artistic style. Taking influence from Cubism, Expressionism, and Surrealism, Klee went on to explore color theory extensively.\n\nKlee was born to a family of Swiss musicians, and music heavily influenced his style throughout his life. Klee entered an exhibition in 1911 which brought him into contact with Picasso, Braque, and Delaunay. Before a 1914 trip to Tunisia, however, Klee had not experimented much with color.\n\nLike the other artists in the Cubism movement, WWI put a stop to much of Klee\u2019s work. By 1920 however, Klee began to work as a teacher at the Bauhaus, a school of art, architecture, and design. Klee\u2019s work was influential until he fled Germany in 1933 as a result of the Nazis. Klee spent the last seven years of his life in Switzerland.\n\nDie Vase (1938) by Paul Klee; Paul Klee, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nDie Vase (1938)\n\nIt was towards the end of his life that Klee\u2019s artwork became thoroughly Cubist. Die Vase, completed in 1938 two years before his death, depicts the classic features of Orphic Cubism. Bright colors of blue and yellow contrast with brown and black. The forms are rounded, circular, and abstract.\n\nAlbert Gleizes, 1881-1953\n\nOriginally destined for material fabrication as a result of his childhood in a fabric design studio, French artist Albert Gleizes proclaimed himself to be the founder of the Cubism art movement. After spending some time in the military until 1905, Gleizes discovered painting and was soon exhibiting his art. By 1906, he was working in Paris in a commune with other artists until 1908.\n\nBy 1912, Gleizes was an influential co-author of Du Cubism, but the plans were sadly interrupted by the beginning of the war. After the war, Gleizes\u2019 style became increasingly abstract, and he created a second artist\u2019s commune in 1927. Gleizes remained an influential figure in the Cubism art movement, continuing to exhibit throughout the 1930s until he died in 1953.\n\nPortrait de Florent Schmitt (Le Pianiste) (1914-1915) by Albert Gleizes; Albert Gleizes, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nLa Femme aux Phlox (1910)\n\nCompleted in 1910, this work by Gleizes is a prime example of early analytical Cubism. The scene shows a woman with flowers, fragmented into geometric shapes. The color pallet of muted greys, browns, and whites confirms its place as a piece of analytical Cubism.\n\nPaul C\u00e9zanne, 1839-1906\n\nAlthough he passed away at the dawn of the Cubism art movement, Paul C\u00e9zanne is a renowned artist and is credited with being the founder of modernism. Producing his first paintings in 1861, C\u00e9zanne began as a post-impressionist artist, later exploring abstraction through the use of different brush strokes, shadows, and highlights. C\u00e9zanne is also known for experimenting with form and color to create abstract and visually striking scenes.\n\nC\u00e9zanne is possibly most well-known for the influence of his work on the Cubist artists who flourished after his death. Unfortunately, he was never able to see his real success as he died in 1906, which was before the Cubism art movement had taken off.\n\nLe gar\u00e7on au gilet rouge (\u2018The Boy in a Red Vest\u2019, 1888-1890) by Paul C\u00e9zanne; Paul C\u00e9zanne, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nBoy in a Red Vest (1888-1890)\n\nThis painting, although completed almost 20 years before Picasso and Braque formalized Cubism as a movement, is an influence for these later works. The boy figure in the painting is seated with his head resting in his hand. Although you cannot see the geometric fragmentation that is characteristic of the Cubist style, the brush strokes that C\u00e9zanne used break up the flow of areas that should be soft and smooth, adding an interesting dimension to the painting.\n\nRecommendations for Books on the Cubism Art Movement\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about the Cubism movement and the artists who were involved in it, then we recommend the following books.\n\nAd Parnassum (1932) by Paul Klee; Paul Klee, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nCubism (Movements in Modern Art)\n\nThis book by David Cottington provides some historical context to the development of the Cubism art movement in the period before the First World War. Through an in-depth analysis of Cubist paintings by Braque, Picasso, Delaunay, and many other artists, Cottington traces the role of Cubism in the development of modern art.\n\nA Cubism Reader: Documents and Criticism, 1906-1914\n\nWritten by Mark Antliff and Patricia Leighten, this book offers an anthology of documents ranging from poetry to political manifestos, reviews, exhibition prefaces, and theoretical explorations of the cultural milieu from which the Cubist movement emerged. This is a wonderful book for those interested in the philosophical and cultural basis of the Cubism art movement as well as Cubist paintings.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat Is Cubism?\n\nIt can be difficult to provide a Cubism definition because the movement was so varied, and each artist had their unique style. Beginning at the start of the 20th century, the Cubism art movement is one of the most influential of the modern era. Cubism was a radical break from traditional western painting styles in the way it attempts to portray multiple dimensions of space on a two-dimensional canvas. Cubist paintings are characterized by geometric shapes, overlapping planes, bright colors, and later, multi-media collages.\n\nHow Are Cubist Paintings Created?\n\nThere is a fair amount of variation in the mediums used to create Cubist paintings. Depending on the era, artists used the following mediums to create their Cubism paint: Textiles, newspaper, wallpaper, cigarette boxes, and other mixed-media materials.\n\nWho Are the Cubism Artists?\n\nThe most famous Cubism painter is undoubtedly Pablo Picasso, but he worked alongside many other Cubists including Georges Braque and Juan Gris. Paul C\u00e9zanne was a predecessor to the Cubism art movement. Sonia and Robert Delaunay were particularly influential in the Orphic Cubism offshoot.\n\nIs Picasso a Cubist?\n\nYes, Picasso is arguably the most well-known artist in the Cubist movement. When you think of Picasso, Cubism is the first thing that comes to mind. It was the abstract and geometric works of Picasso that set the stage for the Cubist paintings of Gris and many others."}, {"url": "https://mymodernmet.com/what-is-cubism-art/", "page_content": "Since its emergence over 100 years ago, Cubism has been regarded as one of modern art\u2018s most famous and fascinating art movements. Cubism is closely associated with iconic artists like Pablo Picasso, whose avant-garde approach to everyday subject matter turned art history on its head.\n\nFeaturing fractured forms and topsy-turvy compositions, Cubism abandoned the figurative portrayals found in genres of art and moved toward total abstraction. This aspect\u2014along with its unique evolution and lasting influence\u2014has made Cubism one of the 20th century's most celebrated forms of art.\n\nWhat is Cubism?\n\nCubism is an art movement that made its debut in 1907. Pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, the style is characterized by fragmented subject matter deconstructed in such a way that it can be viewed from multiple angles simultaneously.\n\nHistory\n\nAt the turn of the century, Post-Impressionism and Fauvism\u2014movements inspired by the Impressionists\u2018 experimental approach to painting\u2014dominated European art. French painter, sculptor, printmaker, and draughtsman Georges Braque (1882-1963) contributed to the Fauvist movement with his polychromatic paintings of stylized landscapes and seascapes.\n\nIn 1907, Braque met Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, and designer Pablo Picasso (1881-1973). At this time, Picasso was in his \u201cAfrican Period,\u201d producing primitive works influenced by African sculpture and masks. Like Braque's Post-Impressionist paintings, these pieces played with form (and sometimes color), but remained figurative.\n\nAfter they met, however, Braque and Picasso began working together, deviating further from their previous styles and collaboratively creating a new genre: Cubism.\n\nPhases of Cubism\n\nProto-Cubism\n\nBefore the movement was underway, both Picasso and Braque applied elements of the soon-to-be style to their respective genres. This fascinating transition into Cubism is especially apparent in two of their works: Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) and Viaduct at L'Estaque (1908).\n\nLes Demoiselles d'Avignon is perhaps Picasso's most famous piece from his African Period. Dated 1907, it was created on the cusp of Primitivism and Cubism, as evident in the figures' mask-like faces and the fragmented subject matter.\n\nViaduct at L'Estaque depicts Braque's interest in playing with perspective and breaking subjects into geometric forms\u2014key Cubist traits.\n\nAnalytic Cubism\n\nThe first official phase of the movement is known as Analytic Cubism. This period lasted from 1908 through 1912 and is characterized by chaotic paintings of fragmented subjects rendered in neutral tones.\n\nThe fractured forms often overlap with one another, displaying the subject from multiple perspectives at once.\n\nPicasso also applied the principles of Analytic Cubism to his sculpting practice, culminating in a collection of busts and figures that emphasize the phase's experimental approach to perspective.\n\nAt this time, other artists interested in the avant-garde joined Picasso and Braque, including Spanish painter Juan Gris (1887-1927).\n\nGris would go on to become another well-known Cubist painter, particularly known for his role in Synthetic Cubism.\n\nSynthetic Cubism\n\nSynthetic Cubism is the movement's second phase, emerging in 1912 and lasting until 1914. During this time, Picasso, Braque, Gris, and other artists simplified their compositions and brightened their color palettes.\n\nSynthetic Cubism showcases an interest in still-life depictions, rendered as either paintings or collage art.\n\nFamous Cubist Artists\n\nPablo Picasso (1881\u20131973)\n\nWith a career that spanned 79 years and included success in painting, sculpting, ceramics, poetry, stage design, and writing, Pablo Picasso is one of the most important artists of the 20th century. While most artists are known for one iconic style, Picasso's changed several times during his lifetime. Some of his most distinct periods include the Blue Period, Cubism, and Surrealism.\n\nFamous works of art: Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), Guernica (1937)\n\nGeorges Braque (1882\u20131963)\n\nFrench artist Georges Braque was a pioneer of the Fauvist and Cubist art movements. During the latter, he worked closely with Picasso, developing a signature style that featured geometric shapes and simultaneous perspectives. His most notable works were still lifes and landscapes made within the Cubist aesthetic. While he was integral to the development of Cubism, his art was largely overshadowed by Picasso's worldwide fame.\n\nFamous works of art: Still Life with Metronome (Still Life with Mandola and Metronome) (1909), Violin and Candlestick (1910)\n\nJuan Gris (1887\u20131927)\n\nSpanish-born artist Juan Gris was another integral member of the Cubist art movement. His earlier works fit into Analytical Cubism, standing apart from Braque and Picasso for their distinctly vibrant color palette\u2014a trait that was partially inspired by the colors of Matisse's paintings. Due to his emphasis on color and simplified geometric shapes, he was integral to the development of the style.\n\nFamous works of art: Portrait of Picasso (1912)\n\nArt Movements That Influenced Cubism\n\nGiven the popularity of Post-Impressionism and Braque's own relationship with Fauvism, it is no surprise that both movements played a pivotal role in shaping Cubism.\n\nPost-Impressionism\n\nCubists borrowed several artistic elements employed by Post-Impressionist painters\u2014namely, Paul C\u00e9zanne.\n\nThese include flat planes of color, geometric forms, and, most significantly, a distorted sense of perspective. \u201cThe hard-and-fast rules of perspective which it succeeded in imposing on art were a ghastly mistake which it has taken four centuries to redress,\u201d Braque explained to The Observer in 1957. \u201cC\u00e9zanne, and after him Picasso and myself, can take a lot of credit for this. Scientific perspective forces the objects in a picture to disappear away from the beholder instead of bringing them within his reach as painting should.\u201d\n\nFauvism\n\nIn addition to Post-Impressionism, Cubist art was inspired by Fauvism.\n\nOn top of Braque's association with the movement, this influence was strengthened by Picasso's relationship with Matisse, an artist renowned for using blocks of artificial color and repeating patterns to compose a scene. \u201cYou have got to be able to picture side by side everything Matisse and I were doing at that time,\u201d Picasso recalled in the 1960s. \u201cNo one has ever looked at Matisse's painting more carefully than I; and no one has looked at mine more carefully than he.\u201d\n\nLegacy of Cubism\n\nLike other modern art movements, Cubism would eventually influence\u2014and even spawn\u2014several other genres of art.\n\nFuturists found inspiration in Cubism's energetic compositions, while Surrealists adopted and adapted collage art. Similarly, the idea of deconstructing subjects into fragments influenced artists associated with the Dada, De Stijl, Bauhaus, and Abstract Expressionist movements.\n\nIn addition to these modern genres, Cubism's influence is also evident in contemporary art. From Cubist tattoos to graffiti inspired by Picasso's portraits, these playful pieces showcase the timeless aesthetic, captivating compositions, and lasting legacy of Cubism.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is Cubism?\n\nCubism is an art movement pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, characterized by fragmented subject matter deconstructed in such a way that it can be viewed from multiple angles simultaneously.\n\nWhat are four characteristics of Cubism?\n\nCubist art features a single viewpoint, emphasis on overlapping geometric forms, fragmented subjects, and rejection of traditional techniques, such as modeling.\n\nWhat are three different styles of Cubism?\n\nThere were three primary phases of Cubism: Proto-Cubism, Analytical Cubism, and Synthetic Cubism.\n\nThis article has been edited and updated.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nIconic Artists Who Have Immortalized Themselves Through Famous Self-Portraits\n\nYou Can Now Explore Every MoMA Exhibit Since 1929 for Free Online\n\nStunningly Colorful Cubist Tattoos Inspired by Picasso\n\nSimple Line Tattoos Inspired by Surreal Artists Like Picasso"}, {"url": "https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-cubism-shattered-convention-alter-course-art-history", "page_content": "Dec 11, 2018 9:34PM\n\nIn 1907, a young French painter named Georges Braque visited Pablo Picasso\u2019s studio in Montmartre, Paris. What he saw upon entering the space would have a profound and lasting impact on him\u2014and on the entire history of Western art. There, Braque first laid eyes on the Spanish artist\u2019s latest painting, Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon (1907), a monumental canvas depicting five aggressively angular nude women with mask-like faces, standing in a shallow space. Every surface in the painting\u2014bodies, furniture, even walls\u2014is composed of fractured, geometric planes, almost as if looking into a smashed mirror. \u201cThis is the beginning of Cubism,\u201d Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, an art dealer who worked with Picasso and Braque, later wrote in his 1920 book The Rise of Cubism (Der Weg zum Kubismus), \u201cthe first upsurge, a desperate titanic clash with all of the problems [of painting] at once.\u201d In his analysis, Kahnweiler zeroed in on one of the most perplexing aspects of the composition. A table featuring a bowl of fruit at the center of the painting is tilted dramatically upward, giving the viewer a skewed perspective. One has the sensation of looking down upon the table, while simultaneously looking directly ahead at the women in the room. Picasso also provides the viewer with concurrent views of the crouching woman\u2019s back and front; as her body faces one way, her head is turned impossibly to look confrontationally at the viewer. Gone was any vestige of realistic representation or perspective. Gone was the female nude as a submissive, demure object for consumption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time, Braque had been painting in the radically colorful style of the Fauvists. But Picasso\u2019s painting, with its dynamic, off-kilter, and convention-exploding perspective and form, quickly turned Braque in a new direction. He soon began work on a series of landscapes in which the picture plane was similarly fractured into pieces. He exhibited the work at Kahnweiler\u2019s Paris gallery in November 1908, earning a caustic review from the notoriously outspoken art critic Louis Vauxcelles in the literary periodical Gil Blas. \u201c[Braque] has contempt for form,\u201d Vauxcelles wrote, and \u201creduces everything\u2014places and figures and houses\u2014to geometrical patterns, to cubes.\u201d Vauxcelles\u2019s review is widely credited as the first use of the term \u201ccubes\u201d to describe this style, which eventually led to the movement\u2019s name: Cubism. Picasso and Braque would go on to experiment with the style in every genre: figural works, landscapes, and still lifes, and it would ultimately be viewed as one of\u2014if not the\u2014most influential artistic movements of the 20th century. Indeed, many understand Cubism as the beginning of a new page in Western art history\u2014when the illusionistic representation of objects and figures in space gave way to pure abstraction.\n\n\n\nWhat is Cubism? Cubism underwent several stylistic shifts, but at its core, the artists associated with the movement distilled forms down to their essential elements. Although neither Picasso nor Braque ever explicitly linked Cubism to any theoretical texts or artistic precedents, both artists were fascinated by semiotics, politics, and theories of visual perception, as well as the poetry of St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 and the work of many of their artistic predecessors and contemporaries, especially Paul C\u00e9zanne, as well as Neo-Impressionists Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. Cubism began in two-dimensional media\u2014primarily drawing and painting\u2014and later grew to encompass collage and sculpture. The first phase of Cubism, sometimes referred to as \u201cAnalytic Cubism\u201d (from 1908 through 1912), was deeply indebted to the work of the modernist master C\u00e9zanne, famous for his compositions of Mont Sainte-Victoire, which portray a mountain view as a patchwork of discrete brushstrokes. Like C\u00e9zanne, Picasso and Braque rejected prevailing approaches to the representation of mass, space, and volume, emphasizing instead the flatness of the canvas itself.\n\nBy 1910, Cubism had evolved to become even further abstracted. Forms were represented by overlapping planes of geometric shapes, rendered primarily in grays, browns, and blacks, and were now nearly impossible to identify. Take Braque\u2019s 1910 painting Violin and Candlestick, for instance, in which the candle is discernible from little more than a circle at the center of the canvas\u2014an abstract stand-in for the halo of light it emits. Picasso and Braque reduced objects to their most basic characteristics: A guitar is represented by its headstock and tuning pegs, while a newspaper is recognizable only through the distinctive font of the masthead. By 1912, any reference to three-dimensional space was eliminated as both artists began to create mixed-media collages, called papiers coll\u00e9s, incorporating drawing, painting, and mass-produced materials\u2014such as pre-printed oilcloth, newspaper fragments, cigarette packages, and labels from bottles of liquor. This period of Cubism is often referred to as \u201cSynthetic Cubism,\u201d referring to the artists\u2019 synthesis of a variety of materials. In Still Life with Chair Caning (1912), one of Picasso\u2019s best-known Synthetic Cubist works, he painted a still life over an industrially produced sheet of oilcloth, printed with a pattern of chair caning. An actual piece of rope stretches around the edges of the canvas. In this work, Picasso challenges the primacy of painting and drawing\u2014considered \u201chigh\u201d art\u2014over mass-produced materials.\n\n\n\nThe icons of Cubism\n\nPicasso and Braque were close friends and intense rivals. Although little correspondence between the two artists survives, Picasso once described their relationship to the French painter, critic, and author Fran\u00e7oise Gilot: \u201cAlmost every evening, either I went to Braque\u2019s studio or Braque came to mine. Each of us had to see what the other had done during the day,\u201d he recounted. \u201cWe criticized each other\u2019s work. A canvas wasn\u2019t finished unless both of us felt it was.\u201d This close collaboration led to works with such great visual and stylistic similarity that it became nearly impossible to attribute authorship to many of them. Adding to this puzzle of authorship, many Cubist works are not signed on the front, perhaps because a signature would interfere with their formal construction, as well as add a personalized note to its composition. In a 1935 essay published in the literary journal Transition, Braque recalled: \u201cPicasso and I were engaged in what we felt was a search for the anonymous personality. We were inclined to efface our own personalities in order to find originality.\u201d Picasso and Braque\u2019s artistic partnership came to an end when Braque enlisted with the French Army in 1914, though their working relationship remains one of the most celebrated in art history. But there were others who had touched and shaped the movement, drawn to the radical new style that the two had pioneered. In 1911, Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Henri Le Fauconnier, Robert Delaunay, Fernand L\u00e9ger, and Marie Laurencin, who moved in separate but overlapping circles with Picasso and Braque, exhibited a controversial group of works at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, an annual independent art exhibition that took place in Paris. (Robert Delaunay\u2019s wife, Sonia Delaunay, also made an important contribution to the movement, though she didn\u2019t exhibit at the 1911 salon.)\n\nJean Metzinger Femme au flacon assise \u00e0 la fen\u00eatre BAILLY GALLERY Pablo Picasso Femme assise dans un fauteuil (Woman Sitting in an Armchair), 1910 Fondation Beyeler\n\nThe group had been meeting informally for several years in Puteaux, an area in the western suburbs of Paris, and in Montparnasse, a neighborhood on the left bank of the Seine, along with Marcel Duchamp, his brothers Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Jacques Villon, Juan Gris, Alexander Archipenko, and Roger de la Fresnaye. This group is sometimes referred to as the \u201cPuteaux Group\u201d or the \u201cSalon Cubists,\u201d due to their interest in exhibiting in organized exhibitions. They also worked in a Cubist style, though they sought a broader definition of Cubism than the narrow stylistic constraints of the work produced by Picasso and Braque. Inspired by color theory, mathematics, and philosophy, the Salon Cubists often incorporated bright hues into their compositions, infusing their works with a greater sense of movement. Metzinger\u2019s Danseuse au caf\u00e9 (Dancer in a Caf\u00e9) (1912), for instance, features two arcs of color\u2014one yellow, one blue\u2014that appear in the upper left corner of the canvas, giving the impression of flashing lights, while a pair of disembodied, clasped hands underscores Metzinger\u2019s efforts to portray the density, movement, and excitement of the crowd as they applaud the end of the performance. The famous salon of 1911 was not well-received, but it sent shockwaves through the art world and amplified the work Picasso and Braque had been doing over the previous four years, extending their influence far beyond Paris.\n\n\n\nWhy does Cubism matter?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBegun in 1907 with Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon, Cubism would come to an end in 1914, at the onset of World War I. Despite its brevity, the movement\u2019s innovations had lasting implications for nearly every avant-garde movement of the 20th century, including Futurism, Dada, Surrealism, Constructivism, and De Stijl. The Cubists\u2019 rejection of traditional means of representing space and volume, and their stylistic innovations in reducing objects to their essential geometric forms, laid the foundation for everything that was to come. Their use of collage and the juxtaposition of mass-produced materials with the \u201chigh\u201d art of painting and drawing had a profound impact on Dada and Surrealism. Such challenges to the hierarchy of the arts led to the rise of the \u201creadymade\u201d and raised essential theoretical questions about the role of the artist, issues still being grappled with today.\n\nAlison Chang"}, {"url": "https://www.artchive.com/art-movements/cubism/", "page_content": "Cubism is an avant-garde art movement characterized by the breaking down of forms into geometric shapes to the point where representation confronts abstraction. Often this had an uneasy effect and had as a result of the establishment of multiple viewpoints within a single work. At first, this was done on the flat two-dimensional surface but later encompassed three dimensions.\n\nThe movement is typically held to have begun around the middle of the first decade of the 20th century in Paris in the studios of Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso, who also collaborated together. Depending on the art historian\u2019s interpretation, the movement lasted from around 1905 until at least the First World War, with some maintaining that it remained at the forefront of the avant-garde into the 1920s. Indeed, some Cubists persisted with the aesthetic of the movement much later, well into the 1930s.\n\nBroadly speaking, there were two schools within the movement of Cubism: those of the Picasso/Braque collaboration and the Salon Cubists. This latter group began exhibiting extensively in Paris from around the year 1911. From the art history of the former school (that of Picasso and Braque), two stages were held to define the evolution of the Cubist movement: the analytic stage and the synthetic stage. However, other means of understanding the growth of Cubism have been suggested.\n\nIn the mid to late 19th century, innovations in art that we would now recognize as revolutionary were already underway with the advent of Impressionism, as well as other later movements, in France. The artist Paul C\u00e9zanne influence was by far the greatest modern influence on the entire Cubist movement, however. This impulse for pictorial novelty among artists persisted into the early 20th century. Yet, combined with this drive toward modernity, was the inspiration of the older artworks of cultures outside of Europe.\n\nSome of the major artists of the Cubist movement include its pioneers, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Juan Gris, Robert Delaunay, and Fernand Leger.\n\nA few of the major artworks associated with Cubism include Les Desmoiselles d\u2019Avignon, Guernica, and The Weeping Woman by Pablo Picasso, Cubist Self-Portrait by Salvador Dali, and Portrait of Pablo Picasso by Juan Gris.\n\nIn the sections below we will outline the history of Cubism; the influence of Paul C\u00e9zanne on the Cubist artists; the characteristics of Cubist art; describe several leading artists of the movement as well as some of the primary artworks; compare the respective aesthetics of Cubism and art movements like Surrealism, Impressionism, and Futurism; and describe which art movements both influenced and were influenced by Cubist art.\n\nHistory of Cubism\n\nThe exact dates of the first Cubist paintings are a matter of debate but what is certain is that around the years 1907 and 1908 they were being produced by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso in Montmartre, Paris. Which of these two artists are to be called the sole originator is also uncertain, as they collaborated on their Cubist work together.\n\nThe first Cubist pictures that followed the Proto-Cubist work Les Desmoiselles d\u2019Avignon by Pablo Picasso are part of what is termed analytic Cubism. Analytic Cubism was typified by the fragmentation of the picture space, or the fracturing of the objects depicted. In this sense, the objects and the pictorial space were broken down or \u2018analysed\u2019 in such a way as to furnish the viewer with a three-dimensional view or views on the two-dimensional surface.\n\nAt the end of the analytic phase of Cubism in around 1911-2 came the so-called \u2018synthetic\u2019 phase. This synthetic Cubism was marked by the use of papier coll\u00e9 and collage elements. Papier coll\u00e9 is a type of collage where pieces of paper were affixed to the flat surface as part of the composition. Collage includes this but also refers to materials other than paper being glued to the surface.\n\nSynthetic Cubism included works like Pablo Picasso\u2019s Glass and a Bottle of Suze of 1912, which uses glued paper, labels and cardboard; and George Braque\u2019s Still Life on a Table from 1913, which makes use of pasted paper as well as the more traditional pencil, gouache, charcoal, and ink.\n\nSynthetic Cubism brought the realm of high art in touch with the low, the seemingly worthless cast off materials of everyday life. Accordingly, it brought into question the status of the art object.\n\nThe art movement of Cubism did not simply end at a convenient date for the art historian to show. But at its height of influence, its heyday could be dated from about 1910 0r 1911 until the 1920s. However, Pablo Picasso, one of its originators, returned to this style time and time again long after the 1920s when its avant-garde status was superseded. New directions in art occurred in the 1920s, such as: Futurism and Surrealism. These movements took inspiration from Cubism but pursued their own aesthetic and became the torch-bearers for new innovation.\n\nC\u00e9zanne and Cubism\n\nThe works of Paul C\u00e9zanne (1839-1906), particularly his later works executed mostly in the environs of Aix-en-Provence in the south of France, had a profound influence on the early Cubists. Paintings like his many views of Mont Sainte-Victoire and Pyramid of Skulls from c.1901 had a formative impact on Picasso and Braque, among other Cubists.\n\nAlthough usually C\u00e9zanne is called a Post-Impressionist, his oeuvre is uncategorizable. His work fused Impressionist elements with Romanticism but later on his obsessive concern with volumetric balance and \u2018pure vision\u2019 separated him from any specific movement. The singular radicalism of his art, as well as his actual style, made a deep impression on the early Cubists. In terms of his style, C\u00e9zanne has been described as a bridge or transition from Impressionism to Cubism.\n\nThe elements of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s style that are relevant to Cubism are: his subversion of rational single-point perspective, the reduction of objects to their basic geometric shapes, his exhaustive observation of nature and objects, and his simultaneous views of a single object.\n\nC\u00e9zanne rejected the mathematical receding perspective in place since the Renaissance and he reduced or cancelled illusionistic space. In place of this, he chose to concentrate on the possibilities of binocular vision, or the representation of objects from several visual perspectives at once. This equally would become a primary concern of Cubism and became known as simultaneity.\n\nThe simultaneous viewpoints that C\u00e9zanne worked on chimed directly with the Cubists who aimed to portray all angles of a given object.\n\nAnalytic Cubism\n\nAnalytic Cubism is characterized by fragmented objects, multiple viewpoints, muted colors, and a strong sense of line.\n\nBy 1910-12, Analytic Cubism was at its height and this phase would last until about 1912. The collaboration of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque was already bearing fruit with works like Braque\u2019s Le Portugais (1911) and Picasso\u2019s \u2018Ma Jolie\u2019: Woman with a Guitar or Zither (1911). These works are of similar style and use monochrome browns and greens, as well as both works\u2019 centralisation of the deconstructed objects on the vertical plane.\n\nIn Pablo Picasso\u2019s picture \u2018Ma Jolie\u2019 (\u2018My Pretty\u2019) there are trace indications of the figure and objects: the hands playing the instrument, the instrument itself, and rounded shapes such as that of the body of the guitar and perhaps drinking glasses in the left middle all bordered in thick lines. The context is a public caf\u00e9 perhaps and, in this light, we can even sense that the lighter side of the picture to the right could suggest a window with its shifting patterns of reflection especially visible on the upper right.\n\nSynthetic Cubism\n\nSynthetic Cubism had evolved by 1912 and was to last several years. By this time the circle of Cubists began to expand, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque being joined by Juan Gris (1887-1927) in Paris. By then Cubism had become synthetic.\n\nCharacteristics of synthetic Cubism include: the use of non-traditional materials like newspaper and cardboard, collage elements, the introduction of brighter colors, and a flattening of the picture space.\n\nThe collage technique implied the gluing onto the canvas of the everyday materials hitherto not associated with visual art.\n\nSalon Cubism\n\nSo-called Salon Cubism was a phenomenon within the movement that was established by 1910-1 and lasted until the First World War. The term \u2018Salon Cubists\u2019 was used after their exhibition at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants of 1911 in order to differentiate between their group and the \u2018gallery Cubists\u2019, or Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Picasso and Braque worked under the aegis of art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, and this afforded them the luxury of developing their Cubist style in private without worrying about payment.\n\nNotable Salon Cubists working from 1910 through 1913 included Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Robert and Sonia Delaunay, Juan Gris, and Marcel Duchamp. It was the frequent exhibitions of the Salon Cubists from 1910 which first publicized the new art movement in Paris and beyond.\n\nThe Salon Cubists built on the example set by Picasso and Braque but also expanded these pioneers\u2019 vision. Whereas Picasso and Braque painted and made works that were on a small scale, in monochrome largely, the Salon Cubists introduced vibrant colors in works that were on a more monumental scale. Also, their subject-matter \u2013 far from being still life and domestic or scenes from Parisian caf\u00e9 culture \u2013 was more ambitious. Depicting scenes more epic or allegorical subjects, these Cubists performed a fusion of the traditional classicism and the resolutely modern.\n\nThe Salon Cubists were informed theoretically also. They drew from the ideas of the French philosopher of the time, Henri Bergson, the notion of simultaneity and the fluidity of time. But they also, and perhaps primarily, were inspired by mathematics. The mathematician Maurice Princet was a friend of the group and interested them with his demonstrations of four-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional surface.\n\nProminent Salon Cubist paintings include Woman with Phlox by Albert Gleizes from 1910, Woman with a Horse by Jean Metzinger from 1911-2, and The City of Paris by Robert Delaunay from 1912.\n\nCrystal Cubism\n\nCharacteristics of Crystal Cubism include: the emphasizing of the flatness of the picture plane and overlapping geometrical structures. These works usually use a bedrock of geometric forms onto which or into which figures, and objects are placed. In Crystal Cubism there is a clarity and an almost classical sense of order.\n\nThe high point for Crystal Cubism was between 1917 and 1920 but it emerged around the beginning of the First World War in 1914. It was practiced by most of the Salon Cubists, particularly those under contract with art dealer L\u00e9once Rosenberg. These artists included Jean Metzinger, Juan Gris, and Albert Gleizes.\n\nArtworks that are prime examples of Crystal Cubism are: Soldier at a Game of Chess (1914-5) by Jean Metzinger, and Portrait of Josette Gris (1916) by Juan Gris.\n\nJean Metzinger\u2019s Soldier at a Game of Chess (1914-5) is a study where observed reality meets abstract geometry. Perhaps a self-portrait, the calculations of the soldier in the playing of the game are analogous to the rigorous decision-making on the part of Metzinger the artist in the construction of his composition. There are multiple perspectives here, as the chess pieces are seen side on while the chess board is impossibly raised towards us. This, combined with the overlapping planes of color lends the image a dynamic movement, as if the motive force of thought is rendered visible.\n\nJuan Gris\u2019s Portrait of Josette Gris (1916) is a portrait of the artist\u2019s partner. But far from making a true likeness or a psychological portrait, Gris is concerned with mathematics and how it permeates the world. The stable, pyramidal composition lends solidity but the light and sometimes transparent geometric forms that are laid over the sitter makes for a spectral presence. Primacy is afforded to the pure form and color is relegated to a monochromatic neutrality.\n\nCharacteristics of Cubism\n\nCharacteristics of Cubism include: the broken picture plane, multiple perspectives, three-dimensional rendering, analysis and synthesis, and simultaneity.\n\nThe Broken Picture Plane\n\nCubism\u2019s broken picture plane avoided the sheer surface and highly polished finish of the Academic art of the 19th century. The Cubist forms seem to alternately jut out into the world of the viewer and recede from it. There is no \u2018all-over\u2019 consistency of texture, with fragmented forms in a syntactical relationship with the gaps and omissions of space.\n\nMultiple Perspectives\n\nCubism\u2019s multiple perspectives subverted the single-point perspective that had been an artistic convention since the Renaissance. Even though earlier artists like Manet and C\u00e9zanne similarly rejected linear perspective, the Cubists did so idiosyncratically as their analysis of space and objects allowed multiple views not only of the object at once but within each plane and angle that composed it.\n\nThree Dimensions\n\nCubism\u2019s three dimensional rendering is related to its multiple perspectives. The object or figure is painted with such faceting that it, and the picture itself, seem to possess a tactile solidity for all the flux of shifting views.\n\nAnalysis and Synthesis\n\nCubism\u2019s analysis and synthesis is related to the process of construction. The Cubist object is not as it appears in the visible world but it is not simply broken up (analyzed). It is broken up into parts and then reassembled (synthesized) in order to re-imagine it.\n\nSimultaneity\n\nCubism\u2019s simultaneity is related to time. The partial objects, traces of hands, analyzed heads all convey the blur of movement and request of the viewer in his own time and place to complete the holistic perception of the work. Just as these works show a convergence of different angles, shapes, and textures, so they also mark a convergence of time through the union of their various \u2018moving parts\u2019.\n\nCubist Artists\n\nSome of the major Cubist painters and makers include: Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, and Juan Gris.\n\nPablo Picasso\n\nPablo Picasso (1881-1973) was born in Spain but spent most of his working life in Paris where he, along with Georges Braque developed Cubism in the middle of the first decade of the 20th century. Picasso and Braque would subsequently be seen as the leaders of this new art movement. This was despite the fact that they operated in private under the patronage of art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler for these crucial years.\n\nPablo Picasso\u2019s Cubism of his analytic phase is virtually indistinguishable from that of Georges Braque, so closely did they work together. They painted quiet studies of forms broken up and reassembled in three dimensions in shallow space, and with muted colors. But one detectable difference between the two is the modeling. Picasso\u2019s analytic forms are broadly more sculptural and solid, while those of Braque are more airy, ethereal presences.\n\nHowever, in terms of the immediate inspiration for the new style, Picasso\u2019s Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon of 1907 was of singular significance. That image was itself influenced by Iberian sculpture and African masks but Picasso became the forerunner of Cubism with his sharp angles and the disorientation of scale and space.\n\nPablo Picasso\u2019s Cubism evolved over time, from the early analytic Cubism through the synthetic phase towards his later combination of Cubism with irrational Surrealist elements. From his early analytic still lifes and portraits when collaborating with Georges Braque, the two artists entered the stage of synthetic Cubism and used extraneous materials in their painting. This stage, a more tactile Cubism, straddled the line between painting and sculpture as well at that between the aesthetic and the everyday.\n\nMajor works by Picasso include Seated Nude (1909-10), Girl with a Mandolin (Fanny Tellier) (1910), The Aficionado (1912), and Weeping Woman (1937).\n\nGeorges Braque\n\nGeorges Braque (1882-1963) spent most of his working life in Paris. With Pablo Picasso, Braque had a fundamental role in the foundation of the new Cubist style in the first decade of the 1900s.\n\nWhile Picasso had a wide variety of influences, from Iberian sculpture, African art, and Paul C\u00e9zanne, Georges Braque focused largely on the aesthetic legacy of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s multiple perspectives. In his Cubism, Braque is more calm and meditative than Picasso. Despite this, in large degree in the analytical cubism phase which was typified by an extremely close mutual influence, it is difficult to differentiate between a lot of their pictures. However, Georges Braque was more dismissive of color than Pablo Picasso until much later in his career. Another difference was that Braque was apolitical in his Cubism, concentrating mostly on still lifes containing musical instruments and drinking vessels. Picasso by contrast frequently included social and political references.\n\nSome major works by Georges Braque include Fruit Dish (1908-9), Pitcher and Violin (1909-10), The Guitar (1909-10), and Violin and Candlestick (1910).\n\nJean Metzinger\n\nJean Metzinger (1883-1956) was living in Paris during the development of his Cubism. As an artist but also as an influential theorist, Metzinger occupied an important role in Salon Cubism, or those Cubists who exhibited frequently in Paris at the beginning of the 1910s, unlike Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque.\n\nMetzinger\u2019s theoretical studies informed a more regimented approach to his art. Especially, he made use of geometry, faceting and multiple perspectives. It is his geometric forms that placed mathematics at the center of his efforts, particularly in his Crystal Cubist phase when he distilled form into a purity of geometric shape without veering entirely into abstraction.\n\nJean Metzinger\u2019s early Cubism was analytic but his forms were more mobile and muscular than those of his forebears, Picasso and Braque. Much like the analytic period of Picasso and Braque, Metzinger\u2019s Cubism is often difficult to single out when it is compared to that of his own artistic (and theoretical) partner, Albert Gleizes.\n\nIn contrast to the Cubism of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, Jean Metzinger (and Albert Gleizes) were more influenced by artistic tradition, with the subject-matter being often classical or at least allegorical. Metzinger and Gleizes jointly published their manifesto of Cubism, Du Cubisme in 1913. In this book, the two authors outline a classical Platonic concept of the relation between form and idea: \u201c\u2026to discern a form is to verify a pre-existing idea\u2026\u201d\n\nFrom about 1912, Jean Metzinger began to place equal emphasis on color and form, whereas beforehand he focused on form. In his Crystal Cubist phase, he developed overlapping and intersecting planes and furthered his purification of abstract structures. His forms were simplified by now and he abandoned what the contemporary art critic Maurice Raynal called \u201cartifices of the palette,\u201d meaning painterly effects.\n\nSome major works by Jean Metzinger include: Standing Nude (1910-1), Le Go\u00fbter (1911), At the Cycle-Race Track (1912), and Soldier at a Game of Chess (1914-5).\n\nAlbert Gleizes\n\nMuch of what is said about Jean Metzinger\u2019s Cubism can be said of Albert Gleizes (1881-1953), his close associate in Paris. Gleizes shared Metzinger\u2019s rigorous approach to Cubism in terms of mathematics and fashioned his art accordingly, concentrating on form rather than on colour in much of his work.\n\nAlbert Gleizes deployed intersecting and overlapping shapes to produce a dynamism in his pictures reminiscent of much of Picasso\u2019s Cubism. However, Gleizes\u2019s art was more rationally structured than Picasso\u2019s. Even in works with quiet subject-matter like Woman with Phlox from 1910 Gleizes achieves through his method a panoramic movement and a mobile perspective that belies the anchoring of the seated woman in the center.\n\nIn The Bathers of 1912, Albert Gleizes participates in the traditional classical theme of women bathing. Both he and Metzinger aimed to contribute to the classical tradition and even saw in their art its culmination. For instance, Jean Metzinger\u2019s Standing Nude can be compared to The Bathers by Gleizes.\n\nJean Metzinger\u2019s nude is faceless, intimating a universal humanity, as well as de-emphasizing or ridding the picture of psychological significance. His angular forms serve a stylized muscularity. The influence is clearly classical antique statuary but in terms of tone and color the figure is hardly distinguished from its ground. The umber and muted greens show the relationship of humanity to nature as inextricably intertwined or perhaps not a relationship at all but an essence revealing itself in varied modes of being. Metzinger\u2019s image has for a theme the ahistorical and the permanent.\n\nThe Bathers (1912) by Albert Gleizes has the similar subject of the female nude. But in this work, nature serves more as a backdrop in front of which the foreground scene of the women bathing is placed. Gleizes\u2019s figures are more complete or conventional than Metzinger\u2019s nude and the artist deploys much less angularity in the articulation of the limbs. Unlike Metzinger\u2019s nude, Gleizes\u2019s women have facial features, if only rudimentary: these are individual women. In The Bathers, there is also a clash between the classicising subject-matter and the background of factory chimney stacks. This juxtaposition of the traditional and the modern is a visual exemplar of the objective of the Salon Cubists: the completion of the western tradition in art. There is more a sense in this painting than that of Metzinger of the influence of history upon which the Cubist artist acts and builds. Where with Metzinger there is the absence of history, Gleizes reveals the aesthetic and historical mission of his Cubism here.\n\nSome major works by Albert Gleizes include: Woman with Phlox (1910), The Bathers (1914), Woman with Animals (1914), Composition for \u201cJazz\u201d (1915), and Woman with Black Glove (1920)\n\nJuan Gris\n\nBorn in Madrid, Juan Gris spent most of his artistic career in Paris where he was associated with both Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque on the one hand, and the Salon Cubists on the other. By 1906, Gris was living in Paris where he became friendly with Henri Matisse, Georges Braque, Jean Metzinger, and then Pablo Picasso. Gris took up painting in 1911, after years of working as a satirical cartoonist.\n\nWhen Juan Gris saw Jean Metzinger\u2019s work Le go\u00fbter in 1911 he had an epiphany, and came to realize the centrality of mathematics, according to art historian John Richardson. This realization was to permeate the subsequent art of Gris who developed a characteristic grid structure to bring order to his representations.\n\nThe art historian Peter Brooke maintained that Juan Gris\u2019s art had a more \u201crational and measurable quality\u201d than the analytical Cubism of both Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. This is certainly true, but Gris\u2019s Cubism evolved from a not-yet mathematical treatment of form in works like Houses in Paris (1911) in which shading and painterly effects are minimized. After his analytic phase, Gris also developed a concern for color, especially in bright harmonics, which was influenced by the Fauvism of his friend Henri Matisse.\n\nBy 1916-7, Gris had entered his Crystal Cubist period. At this time, he refined his mathematical approach, painting simple geometric forms and fusing objects and figures with their ground. His geometry was the starting point for his representations and the foundation for his union of disparate elements through a flattening of the picture space.\n\nSome major works by Juan Gris include Houses in Paris (1911), Portrait of Picasso (1912), and Woman with a Mandolin, after Corot (1916).\n\nCubist Artwork\n\nSignificant cubist artwork includes Guernica by Pablo Picasso,\n\nGuernica by Pablo Picasso\n\nGuernica by Pablo Picasso has as its theme the suffering and death of warfare. It is an imagined scene of the experience of war by innocent civilians (with the exception of the dead soldier) who inevitably suffer the most. This picture was painted as a reaction to the bombing of the Spanish city of Guernica by German and Italian planes in April 1937 at the instigation of the Spanish nationalists during the country\u2019s civil war.\n\nWhile Guernica is a response to a particular wartime atrocity, it also symbolises a revulsion to war in general through a documenting of its horrors.\n\nThe picture shows a claustrophobic and shallow space that is seemingly as inescapable as the anguish caused by violence. A mutilated and dismembered dead soldier lies on his back in the left foreground, his severed arm holding a broken sword out of which blooms a flower that is perhaps the single note of hope in the painting. A bull that is perhaps the symbol for Spain looks out at a presumably desolate landscape to the left. The fact that its tail doubles as smoke points to a pessimism about the destiny of the country racked by civil war. There is a horse screaming in agony, a lamenting mother holding her dead child in her arms, the haunted head of a woman (which may be a surrogate for the artist, or the viewer) peering in at this scene of devastation from the window to the right, and a woman with arms outstretched enveloped in stylised flames in the shape of knives on the extreme right. Overhead, there is a bald light bulb in the shape of an eye that references either the apathy, or the powerlessness of God in the face of such pain.\n\nThe Cubist forms of broken surfaces and shapes is an apt means of representing such a subject which denotes physical mutilation and social dislocation. At the center of the picture where there is a chaos of flailing limbs and forms is the passage that is most densely and analytically Cubist, the overlapping shapes of the horse and the soldier speaking of physical injury and confusion.\n\nHowever, this dense Cubism does not apply to the picture in general. On either side of the central passage, Picasso employs a more visually coherent figuration. He balances the fracturing and distortions of the piece with drawing that more faithfully relates the scene, which arouses shock and pity. It is the confluence of Cubist forms, the unnatural distortions and suffering, and the evocative monochromatic color scheme that mark this image as overwhelming. Perhaps it is the picture\u2019s Cubism that makes it, if not visually realistic, psychologically realistic.\n\nIn terms of the significance of Guernica for the development of Cubism, the picture was painted long after the high point of Cubism in the 1900s and 1910s. It can be seen as a mature reflection and distillation of Pablo Picasso\u2019s earlier experiments in the Cubist style. But the picture counterbalances the demands of Cubism with the extreme emotivity of the portrayal of the scene. Instead of the earlier exclusive focus on the fracturing of form and multi-perspectival vision, Picasso tempers this with an accurate account of human agony.\n\nLes Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon by Pablo Picasso\n\nLes Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon (1907) by Pablo Picasso depicts five nude women who are prostitutes in a brothel in Barcelona. Three of the women stare blankly and maybe aggressively out at the viewer. Although these women have facial features, Picasso neutralizes any psychological reading other than the fact that the figures are vaguely menacing.\n\nThe figure on the extreme left has features traceable to perhaps an islander of the South Seas of the Pacific and reflects the influence of Micronesian art. The heads of the two figures to her immediate right show the forms of Iberian sculpture and the influence of primitivism on Picasso at this time. Alternatively, the heads of the two figures on the right are obvious references to the forms of African masks that contrast with the pink hues of their bodies.\n\nThe overall effect is jarring for the viewer, with the sharp angles of the upraised arms, of the facial features, and of the drapery. In addition, the disjunctures of the drawing of the respective faces from different traditions as well as the arguable dehumanisation of the stylised figures (which are compared to the still life of the right foreground) are salient. This bears a relation to the Cubist concern of the succeeding years with the figure as an object to be deconstructed in the name of re-imagining the world.\n\nThe visual dislocations of the scene, the provocative poses, and the drawing of the figures and facial expressions are shocking, particularly as these traits contribute to a radical lack of pictorial unity, or self-containment, which was a traditional prerequisite for painting.\n\nThis picture\u2019s Cubist characteristics include: its sharp angularity, uncertain perspective, and its jagged and fragmented forms. However, Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon differs from outright Cubism in that the women\u2019s bodies are not \u2018analyzed\u2019 in the Cubist sense as they have visual integrity, for all of Picasso\u2019s distortions.\n\nThis work was the immediate springboard for the analytic Cubism of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque and has been described accordingly as the example of \u2018Proto-Cubist\u2019 art. Although Braque was initially negative in his reaction (as were most of Picasso\u2019s coterie), he made an extensive study of it and his Cubism was formatively affected by it.\n\nCubist Self-Portrait by Salvador Dal\u00ed\n\nCubist Self-Portrait (1923) by Salvador Dal\u00ed shows the seemingly disembodied head of the artist with its gaunt angularity and prominent eyebrows. The head does not have a mouth, signaling silent observation, perhaps a self-conscious recognition of his recent study and foray into Cubism. The figure\u2019s body is suggested subtly by the convex structure that runs down the center of the composition and flares out toward the foot of the painting.\n\nThe picture\u2019s Cubist characteristics include the fact that the structures are ordered but fragmented as if there is a cascade of glasslike shards. This is redolent of the analytic phase of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque of a decade and a half earlier. Yet, Dal\u00ed is also making use of the collage technique of synthetic Cubism here. Accordingly, we could categorize the work as a synoptic fusion of the two canonical stages of Cubism. Therefore, the picture functions as a visual history of the art of Cubism through formal and technical rather than narrative means. Also, the basic likeness of the artist confidently places him within this esteemed and historic avant-garde movement.\n\nAs this picture dates from 1923, when Dal\u00ed was 19, it was painted long after the high point of Cubism. However, it is evidence of Cubism\u2019s continued aesthetic appeal for ambitious artists. Notable also is the fact that Dal\u00ed glued the paperboard to a wooden panel, making the image a collage on top of a collage that suggests an infinity of technical possibilities for Cubism and for the artist\u2019s creativity.\n\nThe Weeping Woman by Pablo Picasso\n\nThe Weeping Woman (1937) by Pablo Picasso (61 x 50cm, oil on canvas, Tate Modern, London) depicts on a small scale a grieving woman with her handkerchief raised to her face. This picture was painted during the Spanish Civil War in the same year as Guernica which also foregrounded feminine anguish. Including drawings, Picasso produced 36 works based on this theme in 1936-7. Whereas in Guernica the subject is immediately pain and horror, The Weeping Woman is more a study of intimate and quiet grieving in the wake of horror. As such the work can be seen as a companion piece to Guernica, especially as Picasso made of weeping women allegorical figures for Spain. In this way, The Weeping Woman is both personal and political.\n\nThe portrait is a highly distorted rendition of Dora Maar, a Surrealist photographer, and lover and muse of Picasso at this time. The weeping figure could reference the abusive relationship of the two artists or Maar\u2019s own oft-cited melancholic temperament.\n\nIn terms of the picture\u2019s Cubist characteristics, it is more conventionally ordered than in outright Cubism: the scene is a readily recognizable room with a readily recognizable woman. But here are Cubist elements like the improbable angle of the wall\u2019s paneling in the left background. The clothing of the sitter, too, shows such moments, like the crumples of the garment on the figure\u2019s shoulders. These are exploited and rendered in typically Cubist faceting and \u2018moving\u2019 shapes, as if the woman is trembling. Also, the sharp and complex geometry of the handkerchief and the seeming mobility of the face entailed by the uncertain position of the nose are quintessentially Cubist.\n\nYet the image is not purely Cubist. The influence of Surrealist distortion is also evident. The non-naturalistic, one could say irrational, colors of the face (green, yellow and blue) could be read as a rational link to the sickly state of the experience of sorrow. The irrational colors Pablo Picasso uses here are conceptually appropriate for an outpouring of emotion. Surrealist also is the willful, almost automatic treatment of the face, with the eyes counter-intuitively not on the level and the nose being loosely associated with the rest of the visage.\n\nIn terms of the significance of the picture for the development of Cubism, The Weeping Woman by Pablo Picasso evinces a new kind of synthesis, this time of Cubism and Surrealism. By this time, Cubism had had its heyday as a leading force in the avant-garde. Surrealism and Futurism had emerged in the 1920s as the guiding lights of modern art of the 20th century. In response to these developments, Picasso here amalgamates Cubist motifs with a Surrealist sense of extreme emotion, a certain arbitrariness of forms, and the irrationalism of the piece.\n\nPortrait of Pablo Picasso by Juan Gris\n\nPortrait of Pablo Picasso (1912) by Juan Gris was painted towards the end of Gris\u2019s analytic phase. It depicts Pablo Picasso, a pioneer of the Cubist art movement, in a monumental style given that the figure of Picasso occupies most of the picture space.\n\nCharacteristics of Cubism that this work by Juan Gris shares include: the subdivision of the picture space into, in this case, regular shapes; the muted colors of the canonical works of the analytic phase; and an emphasis on the genre of portraiture. Usually, Gris painted pictures with bright and warm color under the influence of his friend Henri Matisse but for this work he uses muted and cool silver and blue. Perhaps this could refer to the calm intellect of his sitter, who helped to originate this movement that was seen by many as highly intellectual.\n\nThe picture space here is not so much fractured as strictly organized with strong structural diagonals. Also, the figure of Picasso is painted with blocked rectangles and, on the arm, cylinders. The diagonals of the setting, as if shafts of light cascading down on the figure, add up to a visual pun on Picasso being an \u2018enlightened\u2019 figure as a pioneer of Cubist art. His body\u2019s orientation sitting back bisects at a right angle the careful geometry of the diagonal \u2018shafts\u2019 and provides a stable equilibrium and, given the bulk of the figure, a certain monumentality.\n\nIn terms of the significance for the development of Cubism, Portrait of Pablo Picasso exhibits a high point in the Salon Cubist style. The mathematical approach of Jean Metzinger\u2019s Le Go\u00fbter, such a strong influence on Juan Gris, is evident. However, when these two images are compared, Gris shows a more regularized formalism and uses fewer variations of shape. Aside from this, his work reveals just as rigorous a geometric bent.\n\nThis picture was painted by Juan Gris towards the end of his own analytic phase. In his subsequent Crystal Cubist phase, Gris was to increasingly conflate the figure and the background. Here, however, he only makes them interpenetrate, with differentiation between figure and ground occurring through different colors and counterbalancing angles.\n\nCubism vs. Surrealism\n\nSurrealism developed in the 1920s in France and by 1924 Andr\u00e9 Breton had published a self-styled manifesto for the burgeoning movement. At its core, Surrealism had the aim of liberating the unconscious mind and bringing it into contact with the external world. According to Breton, its purpose was to \u201cresolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality.\u201d\n\nBoth Cubism and Surrealism share characteristics. Both brought about innovations in the pictorial field, and both made a challenge to conventional visuality and traditional means of representation in art. Also shared is a transgression of the compartmentalization of the traditional media, for example the use of collage by the synthetic Cubists and the Surrealist amalgamation of drawing, painting, sculpture, photography, film and philosophy. Two instances of an overlap are The Weeping Woman by Pablo Picasso and Cubist Self-Portrait by Salvador Dal\u00ed, the first picture combining Cubist forms with Surrealist irrational colors while the second is a foray into Cubism by an artist that would become a leading light of the Surrealist movement.\n\nWhere the two movements differ is on politics and on the role of reason. Cubism was primarily an aesthetic innovation without a politically concerted revolutionary impulse. unlike Surrealism. Cubism was essentially rationalist in its deconstruction of objects and figures into forms and shapes. It also had as a goal the re-creation of perception in an organized picture-world. Cubism made conscious artistic choices that avoided the automatism or the irrationalism that Surrealism embraced. For the Cubists, there was the primary importance of the aesthetic object \u2013 each image is the culmination of its painstaking processes. On the other hand, the Surrealists (with some exceptions) prioritized the experimentation itself, with the art merely as (in the word of Breton) \u201cartifacts\u201d of this experimentation.\n\nSurrealist artists include: Max Ernst, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, and Man Ray.\n\nThe time period for Cubism at its height is from c.1908 until the mid-1920s, while that of Surrealism was from the 1920s up until the 1950s.\n\nCubism vs. Impressionism\n\nThe Impressionist art movement emerged in the 1870s, with many locating the date of its first occurrence to 1872 and Impression: Sunrise by Claude Monet. At the heart of this new art was a concern with visual perception and its techniques were revolutionary and controversial.\n\nBoth Impressionism and Cubism share the objective of new ways of seeing and the making of works that portray the world beyond the conventions of the prevailing Academic art that inherited an earlier classicism. In a further rejection of tradition, both movements often equalize the subject or object painted with the ground or setting, with the result of representing a broader reality outside of any hierarchy of composition.\n\nBoth movements sought to portray movement, but their solutions were opposite: Impressionism\u2019s vague and rapid painting opposed Cubism\u2019s exacting analysis. The two art movements were also mostly devoted to modernity and novelty, with their modern subject-matter necessitating their novel techniques.\n\nHowever, while Impressionism reveled in painterly effects that its artists tried to use to portray the changing quality of light conditions, Cubism restricted the painterly and instead focused on the structural with a precision that contrasts with the often-nebulous character of the work of the Impressionists. There is in Impressionism a spontaneity and the arbitrary application of paint that is entirely lacking in Cubism which adopted a more studied method.\n\nImpressionist artists include Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Edgar Degas.\n\nImpressionism lasted from its inception in the early 1870s towards the close of the 20th century.\n\nCubism vs. Futurism\n\nOriginally, Futurism emerged in Italy at the end of the first decade of the 20th century, almost as early as Cubism. 1909 saw the publication of the Manifesto of Futurism by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, a poet and leader of the movement who intended to outline the scope and ambitions of the group. Later, this phenomenon spread to other countries, notably Russia.\n\nIn both Cubism and Futurism there was the aim of making art that reflected and contributed to the rapidly changing artistic landscape. The simultaneity of certain Cubist (especially Salon Cubist) works was taken on by the Futurists as a central tenet of their admittedly diffuse style.\n\nThe Futurists were obsessed with technology and the fast-paced growth of modern industry, with Marinetti even writing: \u201cWe want no part of it, the past.\u201d Their aims were not merely artistic but also political and had as a goal the nationalist unfettering of Italy from its onerous past. This was to be done by a depiction of exclusively modern subjects and by the deployment of technically experimental methods. In Futurism, technology was glorified and asserted as a symbol of humanity\u2019s victory over nature.\n\nIn Futurist theory, it was maintained that objects were not separate from each other and, accordingly, Futurist artworks began to fuse and intersect objects, figures, and the background in a portrayal of the flux of modern life. This element of their art harks back to the analytic Cubist work of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque where parts of objects were rendered as fragmented forms.\n\nIn 1911, prominent Futurist Gino Severini visited Paris and was profoundly struck by the Cubist style and would adopt it for his work. Many Futurists were to follow suit and felt that Cubist structures were ideal for the relation of dynamic energy that was central to their aesthetic and theory of life. Another Futurist, Umberto Boccioni, was as influenced by Henri Bergson\u2019s theory of the fluidity of time as the Salon Cubists like Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger were and made use of Cubist forms.\n\nCubism was hugely significant for the development of Futurist art and theory which adapted its forms for a different purpose. While Cubism was concerned with the re-combination of objects and figures in novel ways in order to suggest new ways of perceiving, Futurism more explicitly allied the Cubist style to a specific philosophical and political agenda that encompassed nationalism and a cult of the modern society.\n\nSome Futurist artists include: Gino Severini, Umberto Boccioni, and Giacomo Balla.\n\nFuturism emerged at the end of the first decade of the 20th century and exerted influence in art well into the 1930s.\n\nWhat Art Movements Influenced Cubism?\n\nThe art movements that influenced Cubism were African and Iberian art, Impressionism, and Paul C\u00e9zanne.\n\nIn terms of the influence of African masks and Iberian sculpture, the Proto-Cubist work by Pablo Picasso entitled Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon is most emblematic. As such, they are perhaps a more indirect influence on the starting point of Cubism but no less integral. West African Dogon, or Ngil masks from Gabon and Cameroon bear striking similarities to several faces in Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon, while pre-Roman Iberian sculpture with all of its inscrutable and emotionless monumentality is similarly responsible for the painting\u2019s impact. Sculptures from both of these traditions were witnessed in person by Picasso at the Museum of the Trocad\u00e9ro in Paris in the early 1900s.\n\nIn its rebellion against the authority and aesthetic of the prevailing 19th-century Academic style of painting, Impressionism was a forerunner of Cubism. Impressionism dispensed with classical linear perspective and the closed composition. This latter component Cubism both explored and contravened along with the Impressionists while it utterly upended the conventional one-point perspective in the name of either multiple or moving viewpoints.\n\nPaul C\u00e9zanne, who is broadly uncategorizable in the history of art of the latter 19th century, was a major influence on most of the Cubists. In particular, his idiosyncratic modulation or manipulations of form and space beyond the directly seen was instrumental and powerful for the Cubists. Also, C\u00e9zanne\u2019s three-dimensional effects and his seemingly \u2018sculptural\u2019 rendering of objects in multiple or moving perspectives proved formative.\n\nWhat Art Movements were Influenced by Cubism?\n\nOf the many art movements that were influenced by Cubism were: Orphism, Futurism, Suprematism, and Art Deco.\n\nOrphism was a movement that lasted from around 1912 until 1915 in France. Its use of Cubist fragmented forms was this time devoted to the capture of the often-kaleidoscopic effects of light and color. Orphism used the Cubist analytical philosophy to move further towards a purer abstraction as a result. Foremost among its practitioners were Robert and Sonia Delaunay.\n\nIn Futurism, which lasted from 1909 until the 1930s, also there was the adoption of the Cubist deconstruction of forms and objects in order to relate and exemplify, rather than describe the flux and speed of modern and usually modern life. Prime Futurists, all under the sway of Cubist analysis, were Giacomo Balla, Umberto Boccioni and Gino Severini.\n\nSuprematism lasted from 1913 until around 1924 when Stalinist restrictions began to make themselves felt on the freedom of artistic expression in Russia. It developed a more fundamental geometry than most Cubism but owes a debt to Crystal Cubism most of all. Its founder, Kasimir Malevich wrote of the \u201csupremacy of pure artistic feeling\u201d over the object and so differentiated himself from the purely analytic Cubism of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque while seeking a similar alteration to preconceptions about the perception of reality. Major Suprematists included: Kasimir Malevich, Liubov Popova, and Olga Rozanova.\n\nArt Deco, which lasted from the 1910s until the Second World War, embraced visual art, architecture, design. Its emphasis was on craftmanship with opulent materials but made use of Cubist-inspired basic geometric forms. Similar to early Cubism, Art Deco fused syncretic influences, from African to Oceanic art. Eug\u00e8ne Grasset, a major proponent of Art Deco, asserted the importance of a pared-back geometry and emphasized the square and the circle as fundamental to composition. This is directly a result of the study of late C\u00e9zanne and Cubism. Among the leading Art Deco artists and designers were the Christofle crystal firm, the jeweler Louis Cartier, and the interior designer Ren\u00e9 Lalique.\n\nMore Cubism Artwork on Artchive"}, {"url": "https://www.rem.routledge.com/articles/overview/cubism-revised-and-expanded", "page_content": "Overview Cubism [REVISED AND EXPANDED] By Kolokytha, Chara DOI: 10.4324/9781135000356-REMO20-2 Published: 18/04/2019 Retrieved: 09 June 2023, from https://www.rem.routledge.com/articles/overview/cubism-revised-and-expanded\n\nOverview\n\nAbstract Cubism is an art movement that emerged in Paris during the first decade of the 20th century. It was a key movement in the birth and development of non-representational art. The term was established by Parisian art critics, derived from Louis Vauxcelles, and possibly Henri Matisse\u2019s description of Georges Braque\u2019s reductive style in paintings of 1908. It soon became a commonplace term and was widely used to describe the formalist innovations in painting pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Braque from 1907 to 1914. Influenced by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, artists such as Fernand L\u00e9ger (Les Fumeurs, 1912), Juan Gris (Grapes, 1913) and Robert Delaunay (Windows, 1912) developed their own distinctive cubist styles. They introduced new ways of working with colour, geometry, and elements of abstraction (L\u00e9ger, Contraste de formes, 1913). Alternative cubist perspectives were also introduced by painters such as Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, Roger de La Fresnaye, Andr\u00e9 Lhote, and sculptors such as Jacques Lipchitz and Henri Laurens. Cubism\u2019s influence was not limited to painting and sculpture but extended to architecture, poetry, music, literature, and the applied arts.\n\nCubism is an art movement that emerged in Paris during the first decade of the 20th century.

The nearly monochromatic palette (Picasso, Still Life with a Bottle of Rum, 1911) of early cubist painting, in addition to its emphasis on geometry, can be alternatively viewed as a reaction against the pure, bright colours of the Fauves and the spontaneous colour treatment of the impressionists. Cubist art was largely influenced by the later work of Paul C\u00e9zanne and the study of primitive art and, more precisely, African religious masks, statuettes, and artefacts. Picasso\u2019s Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon (1907) and Braque\u2019s Maisons \u00e0 l\u2019Estaque (1908) are considered the first manifestations of proto-cubist painting.\n\nInfluenced by Picasso and Braque, artists such as Fernand L\u00e9ger (Les Fumeurs, 1912), Juan Gris (Grapes, 1913) and Robert Delaunay (Windows, 1912) developed their own distinctive cubist styles.

Photo Scala, Florence\n\nPicasso, Pablo (1881-1973): Still Life with the Cane Chair, 1911-1912 close\n\nConceptual and perceptual Cubism Cubism gained worldwide recognition from the second decade of the 20th century onwards. As its influence spread, a large number of cubist styles emerged that differed substantially from those of Picasso and Braque. This variation mainly resides in the perceptual, either quasi-figurative (Lhote, L\u2019Escale, 1913) or purely abstract cubist perspective that several artists brought forward (Delaunay, Fen\u00eatres ouvertes simultan\u00e9ment, 1912). In addition to the emphasis on solid geometry, a number of artists replaced Picasso and Braque\u2019s use of greys, browns, and blacks with a more vivid palette (La Fresnaye, The Conquest of the Air, 1913). In fact, the style was never homogenous but raised controversy among its agents. This became evident in 1911, with the emergence of the so-called Puteaux Group (1911\u201313) of cubist artists, including Alexander Archipenko, Gleizes, Metzinger, Frank Kupka, Marcel Duchamp, and L\u00e9ger, who frequented the studios of Jacques and Raymond Duchamp-Villon in the western suburbs of Paris. The group\u2019s art can be viewed as a reaction against the conceptual approach of Picasso, Braque, and Gris, who were generally called the Montmartre cubists. A similar reaction is manifested in the works of several other artists such as Lhote and La Fresnaye who practised a perceptual and quasi-figurative style. Although most of these artists taught Cubism in private art academies and had exhibited their compositions since 1911 at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants (Salle 41) and the Salon d\u2019Automne, the generators and leaders of this style (Picasso, Braque, Gris, L\u00e9ger) worked largely in private under the patronage of the German-Jewish art dealer Daniel Henri Kahnweiler who invested in their works for his stock. Clearly, this fact not only contributed to the popularisation of the perceptual and the geometrically abstract cubist technique in the following decades, but also reflects the over-simplified and legible repertoire of most of these artists in opposition to the constant experimentation and renovation of the artists Kahnweiler supported. Major works by Picasso, Gris, and Braque were kept in Kahnweiler\u2019s stock, which, at the outbreak of the First World War, was confiscated as enemy property and was sold at auctions between 1920 and 1923. The stock contained more than 800 works most of which were presented to the public for the first time at auction, generally fetching low prices. This incident was considered a blatant attack against the aesthetic of Cubism. expand Sculpture by O. Gutfreund, \"\u00dazkost (Anxiety)\" Source: Photograph courtesy of Sotheby's Sculpture by O. Gutfreund, \"\u00dazkost (Anxiety)\" close Despite the fact that it is referred to as a movement, the heterogeneity of Cubism is an oft-quoted reality. In Les Peintres Cubistes (1913), Guillaume Apollinaire observed the co-existence of four cubist tendencies, only two of which were developed in a parallel and pure way: scientific Cubism, physical Cubism, instinctive Cubism and orphic Cubism. According to Apollinaire, scientific Cubism, practised by Picasso, Braque, Metzinger, Gleizes, Laurencin, and Gris, is a pure tendency. Physical cubism, practised by Le Fauconnier, is not pure art since it confounds subject with images. The instinctive tendency derives from French Impressionism and has met significant expansion throughout Europe. It is practised, however, by artists who are not necessarily cubist representatives such as Henri Matisse, Georges Rouault, Andr\u00e9 Derain, Raoul Dufy, Jean Puy, Kees Van Dongen, Gino Severini, Umberto Boccioni, and others (ibid. 2013, 84). Finally, orphic Cubism is the second pure tendency, which is practised by artists who do not depend on virtual reality but who create a reality of their own. Representatives of this pure tendency are Picasso, Delaunay, Francis Picabia, L\u00e9ger, and Marcel Duchamp. To his own disappointment, Lhote was not listed among the cubists in the book. Lhote attempted to establish his own division among cubist artists. Commenting on the 31st Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in 1920, he identified two cubist schools: There are four nuances of cubism: two absolutely opposite currents lead, by the opposed roads of painters and sculptors, towards two goals, which are united only by their antagonism \u2026 There is plenty of talent in both camps, and talent alone will decide the final selection. I simply desire to define as precisely as I can the attitude of those whom I call, for my purposes only, cubists a priori or pure cubists, and the cubists a posteriori or emotional cubists. Lhote identified himself with the first group which included Braque, Gris, Maria Blanchard, Metzinger, Marcoussis, Severini, Hayden, Lipchitz, and Laurens. He named the second group cubists-impressionists, referring to the art of Gleizes, Delaunay, Fresnaye, Le Fauconnier, and L\u00e9ger.\n\nAnalytic and synthetic Cubism Due to its complexity, Cubism became subject to several formal and stylistic categorisations and even philosophical interpretations. Its division into the two phases \u2018analytic\u2019 and \u2018synthetic\u2019 has been widely used, although it is chronologically flexible and has been questioned by scholarship as it was not literally accepted by cubist artists. The terms were introduced by Kahnweiler who used them to classify the stylistic experimentations of Picasso and Braque. Analytic Cubism, also referred to as \u2018hermetic Cubism\u2019, is a term used to describe the early achievements of the cubist stylistic innovations and extends approximately from 1910 to 1912. It concerns the simultaneous depiction on a two-dimensional surface of several sides of a three-dimensional object-subject (Picasso, Portrait of D.-H. Kahnweiler, 1910). Although this technique may be seen as abstract it is, in reality, essentially figurative but aims to re-treat and reinterpret the conventional composition. Therefore, the depicted objects are mainly still lives that tend to become easily recognisable as they draw inspiration from everyday life (bottles, tables, musical instruments, books, newspapers, etc.), often accompanied by letters or words that describe them. Synthetic Cubism extended from 1912 to 1914 and introduced the collage technique, the use of vivid colours and different types of materials, mainly paper (wallpaper, papiers coll\u00e9s, paper cut-outs, textiles, etc.), that contribute to the maintenance of the solid structure of the composition and render it legible through the creation of an architectonic illusion of space and volume. This phase exerted considerable influence over the surrealist treatment of the object.\n\nCubism and tradition Although Cubism was initially viewed as a total break with traditional composition, in due course the movement\u2019s critical reception and interpretation was transformed. The cubist artists-theoreticians Gleizes and Metzinger had published texts on Cubism and tradition in Parisian journals between 1911 (Paris-journal) and 1913 (Montjoie). Mark Antliff (1992) argues that Gleizes\u2019 association of Cubism with the Gothic era reflects his leftist allegiances and the formulation of a Celtic nationalism as opposed to right-wing nationalism and its attachment to the Greco-Latin tradition identified with French race. In order to normalise cubist practice, Gleizes and Metzinger published Du Cubisme, establishing a theoretical framework for Cubism which stressed the movement\u2019s connection to Realism: To understand C\u00e9zanne is to foresee cubism. Henceforth we are justified in saying that between this school and previous manifestations there is only a difference of intensity, and that in order to assure ourselves of this we have only to study the methods of this realism, which, departing from the superficial reality of Courbet, plunges with C\u00e9zanne into profound reality, growing luminous as it forces the unknowable to retreat. La Section d\u2019Or, which eventually published only one number dedicated to the 1912 show. According to the note that appeared on the front page of the journal, the artists chose the title The Golden Section since they did not consider themselves isolated in art but sought to re-establish their links with tradition. In October of the same year, the Salon de la Section d\u2019Or [Salon of the Golden Section] was organised at the Galerie La Bo\u00e9tie in Paris in collaboration with the cubist art dealer L\u00e9once Rosenberg. The show presented 185 cubist works by 31 artists. It was accompanied by lectures delivered by Guillaume Apollinaire, Maurice Raynal, and Ren\u00e9 Blum. Metzinger, Gleizes, Gris, and Picabia were principal contributors among less influential artists such as Auguste Agero, R\u00e9na Hassenberg, Sonia Lewiska, Tobeen, and others. Picasso and Braque were absent from the show. The group intended to publish its own journal,, which eventually published only one number dedicated to the 1912 show. According to the note that appeared on the front page of the journal, the artists chose the titlesince they did not consider themselves isolated in art but sought to re-establish their links with tradition. In Les Peintres Cubistes , Apollinaire also stressed the parallels between Cubism and tradition, notably by comparing the geometry of Renaissance art with non-Euclidean geometry and the \u2018fourth dimension\u2019. Although the references to the imperceptible \u2018fourth dimension\u2019 gradually vanished from writings on Cubism in the years that followed, it appears that it was a portmanteau term in the 1910s. Apollinaire\u2019s discussion of the concept is somewhat ambiguous. Although he employed the term in his text, he noted that the fourth dimension is the manifestation of the aspirations, the inquietudes of a large number of young artists who looked at Egyptian, Negro and Oceanic sculptures, meditated scientific works, anticipated a sublime art to which today more of an utopian expression rather than a historical interest may be attached. L\u2019\u00c9lan, which published ten numbers until the termination of its publication in 1916. The journal sought to disassociate Cubism from the German tradition and reconnect it to the French. In \u2018Notes sur le Cubisme\u2019 (L\u2019\u00c9lan, 10 December 1916), Ozenfant presented Cubism as the natural continuation of the work of Ingres, Cezanne, Seurat, and Matisse. The same year, Apollinaire, in his article \u2018L\u2019Art et la guerre: \u00e0 propos d\u2019une exposition interalli\u00e9e\u2019 (Paris-Midi, 9 December 1916), declared that Cubism and Futurism belonged to the Latin tradition, highlighting the movement\u2019s French origins. Similar positions were clearly articulated in the content of SIC, a journal focusing on Cubism and Futurism edited by Pierre Albert-Birot, which published 54 issues between 1916 and 1919. The interpretations that sought to reconnect Cubism with tradition vary from one decade to another. Prior to the Great War, Cubism was identified by its adversaries as a purely German invention and was met with hostility by the advocates of the naturalist tradition in France. However, Germany never claimed Cubism as a national achievement. In 1915 Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant launched the journal, which published ten numbers until the termination of its publication in 1916. The journal sought to disassociate Cubism from the German tradition and reconnect it to the French. In \u2018Notes sur le Cubisme\u2019 (, 10 December 1916), Ozenfant presented Cubism as the natural continuation of the work of Ingres, Cezanne, Seurat, and Matisse. The same year, Apollinaire, in his article \u2018L\u2019Art et la guerre: \u00e0 propos d\u2019une exposition interalli\u00e9e\u2019 (, 9 December 1916), declared that Cubism and Futurism belonged to the Latin tradition, highlighting the movement\u2019s French origins. Similar positions were clearly articulated in the content of, a journal focusing on Cubism and Futurism edited by Pierre Albert-Birot, which published 54 issues between 1916 and 1919. In Cubisme et Tradition (1920, 12), L\u00e9once Rosenberg discussed Cubism in terms of an \u2018orderly\u2019 break with tradition stressing the idealist aspects of the movement: \u2018Similar to the primitives, also impelled by the synthetic spirit, the cubists, start from visual reality to reach ideal reality.\u2019 In 1927 Rosenberg further developed his ideas. He maintained that the cubist synthetic style drew parallels from the Middle Ages. Although Renaissance art imposed analytical doctrines, 20th-century art recovered the medieval aspect of synthesis. He wrote: This is how humanity evolves, the Picassos, L\u00e9gers, Valmiers, are the Cimabues of contemporary art. Without cubism, the passage from static to dynamic, instant to permanent, concrete to abstract, neutral to radiant, flat to volume, local to universal, was impossible. New York Herald Tribune, 14 June 1925, 3). However, Gothic style was treated as a universal style. Rosenberg equally favoured the influential strength of Cubism around the world. A few years earlier, the dealer had declared in the American press that although there were several French schools of painting at the present time, there was only one Cubism the world over, an international style, a religion (, 14 June 1925, 3). Others connected Cubism to Picasso\u2019s own national identity. The American novelist and cubist champion, Gertrude Stein insisted that Cubism is a southern phenomenon originating in Spain: Cubism is part of daily life in Spain, it is in Spanish architecture \u2026 Nature and man are opposed in Spain, they agree in France and this is the difference between French cubism and Spanish cubism and it is a fundamental difference. Cahiers d\u2019Art (1926\u201360) also stressed the parallels between Cubism and Southern European identity supporting a small group of young Spanish artists who were working in Paris under the influence of Cubism and Fauvism (Francisco Bor\u00e9s, Hernando Vi\u00f1es, Cossio, Ismael de la Serna, Joaquin Peinado, Mateo Hernandez). In this sense, the modernist magazine(1926\u201360) also stressed the parallels between Cubism and Southern European identity supporting a small group of young Spanish artists who were working in Paris under the influence of Cubism and Fauvism (Francisco Bor\u00e9s, Hernando Vi\u00f1es, Cossio, Ismael de la Serna, Joaquin Peinado, Mateo Hernandez). Following the pre-First World War debates over the German identity of Cubism, the German collector Wilhelm Uhde identified in Picasso et la tradition Fran\u00e7aise (1928) two distinct schools of Parisian Modernism. The first, inherent to French tradition, was analytic in style and found expression in Impressionism, Renoir, and finally Matisse. The second tendency was synthetic and owed much to the German tradition. Although it was introduced by C\u00e9zanne and Seurat, it achieved a total break with national tradition through the work of Picasso.\n\nCubist exhibitions Braque\u2019s proto-cubist paintings of Estaque were exhibited by Kahnweiler in 1908. These works literally constitute the first cubist landscapes. Apollinaire signed the text for the catalogue without reference to \u2018Cubism\u2019 since the term was established shortly afterwards. According to Kahnweiler, Vauxcelles invented the name after Matisse told him that Braque sent to the Salon d\u2019Automne in 1908 paintings \u2018avec des petits cubes\u2019, referring to Braque\u2019s landscapes of l\u2019Estaque, which were rejected by the jury. Kahnweiler did not approve of the name: From Matisse\u2019s word \u2018cube\u2019 Vauxcelles then invented the meaningless \u2018Cubism\u2019 which he used for the first time in an article on the 1909 Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, in connection with two other paintings by Braque, a still life and a landscape \u2026 the name \u2018Cubism\u2019 endured and entered colloquial language, since Picasso and Braque \u2026 cared very little whether they were called that or something else. A Picasso solo exhibition followed in the dealer\u2019s Parisian gallery in 1909. The works of the so-called Salon cubists (Archipenko, Delaunay, Duchamp, Le Fauconnier, Gleizes, L\u00e9ger, Lhote, Metzinger) were first presented at the 26th Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in 1910. The Salle 42 at the 27th Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in 1911 hosted the first organised cubist show in the history of the movement. That same year, the Salon cubists also presented their work at the ninth Salon d\u2019Automne with Kupka among them, while they also gave a second show at the Parisian Galerie d\u2019Art Contemporain supported by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Normande de Peinture Moderne. Cubist architecture was introduced at the decorative arts section of the 1912 Salon d\u2019Automne with the construction of the Maison Cubiste [Cubist House]. The facade was designed by Raymond Duchamp-Villon with the interior attempting to adapt cubist painting to bourgeois life (Salon Bourgeois). The construction not only introduced cubist art to the domestic environment, but also established the foundations for the emergence of Art Deco design. The installation was also presented the following year at the Armory Show (New York, Chicago, Boston) which introduced Cubism to an American audience. It is worth noting, however, that the term \u2018Cubism\u2019 did not appear in the catalogue\u2019s description of the work. Works by Parisian cubists were exhibited in Germany at the beginning of the century. The third Sonderbund westdeutscher Kunstfreunde und K\u00fcnstler [Separate League of West German Art Lovers and Artists] that was held in Cologne presented to the German public a significant sample of Parisian Modernism as early as 1912. The exhibition was mainly aimed at museum directors who intended to purchase modern works for museum collections. In fact, the first work by C\u00e9zanne (Le Moulin sur la Couleuvre, 1881) that entered a museum collection was acquisitioned in 1897 by Hugo von Tschudi for the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin. The increasing number of exhibitions and theoretical texts on Cubism indicate by and large the expansion of the movement\u2019s reputation and the popularisation of its aesthetic principles. Following the first Salon de la Section d\u2019Or in 1912, the artists belonging to the named group organised two more shows after the First World War. The second Section d\u2019Or exhibition was also held with the support of Rosenberg at his Parisian gallery in 1920. However, Cubism was grouped this time with De Stijl and Bauhaus artists, constructivists and futurists, artists promoted by the art dealer at his gallery. The show did not draw positive attention. Cubism was considered outdated and became the target of attack by dadaists. The third show, mainly a retrospective, was held at the Galerie Vavin-Raspail in 1925. The exhibition Cubism and Abstract Art organised by Alfred Barr at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1936 is a milestone in the history of the movement. The diagram printed on the front cover of the exhibition catalogue established a genealogy for Cubism which is presented as the legitimate offspring of the formal simplification of primitive art and the heroic progenitor of abstraction. The catalogue confirmed that Cubism was by that time a historical movement, claiming the right to institutionalisation.\n\nAfter Cubism The influence of Cubism extends well beyond the first two decades of the 20th century. Although many artists and critics declared the \u2018end\u2019 of the movement at the beginning of the 1920s, Lhote remained faithful to the C\u00e9zannesque formula, maintaining that it had \u2018defined painting for a century or two, and perhaps for longer still\u2019. The artist lent a sympathetic eye to the naturalist turn of Cubism after the war, which brought the movement closer to the French tradition. He was convinced that Cubism still had a long way to go until it reached its end. Lhote declared: to discover a definitive formula too soon would be to confuse death with stability, and not to understand that the intoxication one experiences in constructing a work of art has after all some resemblance to a departure for distant adventures. Apr\u00e8s le cubisme, which literally condemned the decorative turn of Cubism and proposed a pure pictorial language as opposed to the \u2018formalist impressionism\u2019 of the cubists. The book constitutes by and large a Purist manifesto including ideas that were further developed in L\u2019Esprit Nouveau (1920\u201325), a magazine dedicated to modern aesthetics in painting, architecture, and literature. The purists presented themselves as dignified successors of Cubism with their vital role being to restore the pure formal qualities that Cubism introduced in painting. A few years earlier, Ozenfant and the Swiss architect Le Corbusier published the book, which literally condemned the decorative turn of Cubism and proposed a pure pictorial language as opposed to the \u2018formalist impressionism\u2019 of the cubists. The book constitutes by and large a Purist manifesto including ideas that were further developed in(1920\u201325), a magazine dedicated to modern aesthetics in painting, architecture, and literature. The purists presented themselves as dignified successors of Cubism with their vital role being to restore the pure formal qualities that Cubism introduced in painting. In 1921 the Italian Gino Severini, stressed the transition from Cubism to Classicism in his book Du cubisme au classicisme: esthetique du compass et du nombre. The post-futurist artist thought that sensibility in contemporary art led to painterly deformation. He proposed instead a return to the classic canon and the union between science and art. \u2018Art is humanised science\u2019, he declared. Severini denied any classic qualities in the work of C\u00e9zanne, arguing that \u2018we do not become classic through sensation, but through spirit\u2019 (1921, 19). Cubism was viewed by many as \u2018a tragic image of a transitional era\u2019, as J.J.P. Oud wrote in 1923. Perhaps the most systematic effort to revitalise the movement\u2019s influence between the wars was marked by Rosenberg with his Galerie de l\u2019Effort Moderne and the homonymous bulletin that published 40 issues between 1924 and 1927. The cubist art dealer promoted the idealist aspects of cubist painting although he did not approve of Picasso\u2019s turn to classical form in the period 1917\u201325 as much as his brother Paul Rosenberg, who signed a contract with the artist. To a certain extent, his positions were in keeping with those of the cubist champion Maurice Raynal. The Bulletin de l\u2019Effort Moderne became a meeting point for artists who sought to take the lesson of Cubism further, including essays on Neoplasticism, the mechanist aesthetic, and geometrical abstraction. It also reproduced texts by De Stijl artists and other abstractionists. Rosenberg was principally concerned with keeping alive the influence of the movement and advocated tendencies that were regarded with scepticism by the more conservative supporters of Cubism. By 1928 Cahiers d\u2019Art, an influential Parisian art magazine with strong attachments to Picasso, had announced the end of Cubism. Christian Zervos founded the magazine in 1926 seeking to direct and influence the course of contemporary art after Cubism. His collaborator, T\u00e9riade, confirmed in his 1928 book on L\u00e9ger the \u2018end of an era in the evolution of painting, the moment when results and consequences begin to appear\u2019. In a series of articles entitled \u2018Documentaire sur la jeune peinture\u2019, the art critic named the various abstract tendencies that had Cubism as a point of departure but, to his own disappointment, misinterpreted the essential formal values of its aesthetic. T\u00e9riade literally condemned the artists who wished to develop or continue cubism. In art, he maintained, nothing is to be continued (\u2018Cons\u00e9quences du cubisme\u2019, Cahiers d\u2019Art 1, 1930, 17\u201327).\n\nWorks Pablo Picasso, Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon [The Young Ladies of Avignon], oil on canvas, 1907, Museum of Modern Art, New York.\n\nGeorges Braque, Maisons \u00e0 l\u2019Estaque [Houses at l\u2019Estaque], oil on canvas, 1908, Museum of Fine Arts, Bern.\n\nPablo Picasso, Portrait of Daniel-Henri Kahnweiler , oil on canvas, 1910, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nGeorges Braque, Clarinet and Bottle of Rum on a Mantelpiece , oil on canvas, 1911, Tate Gallery, London.\n\nGeorges Braque, Portuguese , oil on canvas, 1911, Kunstmuseum Basel, Basel, Switzerland.\n\nPablo Picasso, Still Life with a Bottle of Rum , oil on canvas, 1911, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\n\nFernand L\u00e9ger, Les fumeurs [The Smokers], oil on canvas, 1912, Solomon R.

Cubism in its various forms inspired related movements in music, literature and architecture. Cubism has been considered to be among the most influential art movements of the 20th century. The term is broadly used in association with a wide variety of art produced in Paris (Montmartre, Montparnasse and Puteaux) during the 1910s and extending through the 1920s.\n\n\n\nThe movement was pioneered by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso, joined by Andre Lhote, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand L\u00e9ger and Juan Gris. One primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of Paul C\u00e9zanne. A retrospective of C\u00e9zanne's paintings had been held at the Salon d'Automne of 1904, current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 Salon d'Automne, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907. In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form\u2014instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context.\n\n\n\nThe impact of Cubism was far-reaching and wide-ranging. In other countries Futurism, Suprematism, Dada, Constructivism, De Stijl and Art Deco developed in response to Cubism. Early Futurist paintings hold in common with Cubism the fusing of the past and the present, the representation of different views of the subject pictured at the same time, also called multiple perspective, simultaneity or multiplicity, while Constructivism was influenced by Picasso's technique of constructing sculpture from separate elements. Other common threads between these disparate movements include the faceting or simplification of geometric forms, and the association of mechanization and modern life.\n\n\n\nHistorians have divided the history of Cubism into phases. In one scheme, the first phase of Cubism, known as Analytic Cubism, a phrase coined by Juan Gris a posteriori, was both radical and influential as a short but highly significant art movement between 1910 and 1912 in France. A second phase, Synthetic Cubism, remained vital until around 1919, when the Surrealist movement gained popularity. English art historian Douglas Cooper proposed another scheme, describing three phases of Cubism in his book, The Cubist Epoch. According to Cooper there was \"Early Cubism\", (from 1906 to 1908) when the movement was initially developed in the studios of Picasso and Braque; the second phase being called \"High Cubism\", (from 1909 to 1914) during which time Juan Gris emerged as an important exponent (after 1911); and finally Cooper referred to \"Late Cubism\" (from 1914 to 1921) as the last phase of Cubism as a radical avant-garde movement. Douglas Cooper's restrictive use of these terms to distinguish the work of Braque, Picasso, Gris (from 1911) and L\u00e9ger (to a lesser extent) implied an intentional value judgement.\n\n\n\nCubism began between 1907 and 1911. Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon has often been considered a proto-Cubist work. Georges Braque's 1908 Houses at L\u2019Estaque (and related works) prompted the critic Louis Vauxcelles to refer to bizarreries cubiques (cubic oddities). Gertrude Stein referred to landscapes made by Picasso in 1909, such as Reservoir at Horta de Ebro, as the first Cubist paintings. The first organized group exhibition by Cubists took place at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in Paris during the spring of 1911 in a room called 'Salle 41'; it included works by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Robert Delaunay and Henri Le Fauconnier, yet no works by Picasso or Braque were exhibited.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a part of the Wikipedia article used under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA).

Andr\u00e9 Breton, who later founded the Surrealist movement, adopted the term for the Manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme (1924), and his definition is translated as \u201cpure psychic automatism, by which it is intended to express\u2026the real process of thought. It is the dictation of thought, free from any control by the reason and of any aesthetic or moral preoccupation.\u201d The word surreal became a part of everyday language in subsequent decades and entered the Merriam-Webster dictionary in 1967. The dictionary defines it as \u201cmarked by the intense irrational reality of a dream.\u201d\n\nSurrealism grew principally out of the earlier Dada movement, which, before World War I, produced works of anti-art that deliberately defied reason. Surrealism\u2019s emphasis, however, was not on negation but on positive expression. It did not inherit Dada\u2019s nihilistic, antirationalist critiques of society and its unrestrained attacks on formal artistic conventions. However, Surrealism did adopt Dada\u2019s preoccupation with the bizarre, the irrational, and the fantastic as well as Dada artists\u2019 reliance on accident and chance.\n\nSurrealism has no unified style, but, in painting, one can distinguish a range of possibilities falling between two extremes. At one pole, the viewer is confronted by a world that is completely defined and minutely depicted but that makes no rational sense: realistically painted images are removed from their normal contexts and reassembled within an ambiguous, paradoxical, or shocking framework. It is exemplified in the works of such artists as Ren\u00e9 Magritte and Salvador Dal\u00ed . At the other pole, variously called organic, emblematic, or absolute Surrealism, the viewer is confronted with abstract images, usually biomorphic, that are suggestive but indefinite. This approach is exemplified by artists such as Jean Arp , Max Ernst , and Joan Mir\u00f3 .\n\nSurrealism was a movement in visual art and literature that flourished in Europe between World Wars I and II. The movement represented a reaction against what its members saw as the destruction wrought by the \u201crationalism\u201d that had guided European culture and politics previously and that had culminated in the horrors of World War I . Drawing heavily on theories adapted from Sigmund Freud , Surrealists endeavoured to bypass social conventions and education to explore the subconscious through a number of techniques, including automatic drawing, a spontaneous uncensored recording of chaotic images that \u201cerupt\u201d into the consciousness of the artist; and exquisite corpse, whereby an artist draws a part of the human body (a head, for example), folds the paper, and passes it to the next artist, who adds the next part (a torso, perhaps), and so on, until a collective composition is complete.\n\nSurrealism , movement in visual art and literature , flourishing in Europe between World Wars I and II . Surrealism grew principally out of the earlier Dada movement, which before World War I produced works of anti-art that deliberately defied reason; but Surrealism\u2019s emphasis was not on negation but on positive expression. The movement represented a reaction against what its members saw as the destruction wrought by the \u201crationalism\u201d that had guided European culture and politics in the past and that had culminated in the horrors of World War I. According to the major spokesman of the movement, the poet and critic Andr\u00e9 Breton , who published The Surrealist Manifesto in 1924, Surrealism was a means of reuniting conscious and unconscious realms of experience so completely that the world of dream and fantasy would be joined to the everyday rational world in \u201can absolute reality, a surreality.\u201d Drawing heavily on theories adapted from Sigmund Freud , Breton saw the unconscious as the wellspring of the imagination. He defined genius in terms of accessibility to this normally untapped realm, which, he believed, could be attained by poets and painters alike.\n\nIn the poetry of Breton, Paul \u00c9luard , Pierre Reverdy , and others, Surrealism manifested itself in a juxtaposition of words that was startling because it was determined not by logical but by psychological\u2014that is, unconscious\u2014thought processes. Surrealism\u2019s major achievements, however, were in the field of painting . Surrealist painting was influenced not only by Dadaism but also by the fantastic and grotesque images of such earlier painters as Hieronymus Bosch and Francisco Goya and of closer contemporaries such as Odilon Redon , Giorgio de Chirico , and Marc Chagall . The practice of Surrealist art strongly emphasized methodological research and experimentation, stressing the work of art as a means for prompting personal psychic investigation and revelation. Breton, however, demanded firm doctrinal allegiance . Thus, although the Surrealists held a group show in Paris in 1925, the history of the movement is full of expulsions, defections, and personal attacks.\n\nSurrealist artists\n\nWith its emphasis on content and free form, Surrealism provided a major alternative to the contemporary, highly formalistic Cubist movement and was largely responsible for perpetuating in modern painting the traditional emphasis on content. The work of major Surrealist painters is too diverse to be summarized categorically. Each artist sought his or her own means of self-exploration. Some single-mindedly pursued a spontaneous revelation of the unconscious, freed from the controls of the conscious mind, while others, notably the Catalan painter Joan Mir\u00f3 (though he never officially joined the group), used Surrealism as a liberating starting point for an exploration of personal fantasies, conscious or unconscious, often through formal means of great beauty.\n\nA range of possibilities falling between the two extremes can be distinguished. At one pole, exemplified at its purest by the works of the French artist Jean Arp, the viewer is confronted with images, usually biomorphic, that are suggestive but indefinite. As the viewer\u2019s mind works with the provocative image, unconscious associations are liberated, and the creative imagination asserts itself in a totally open-ended investigative process. To a greater or lesser extent, the German artist Max Ernst, French painter Andr\u00e9 Masson, and Mir\u00f3 also followed this approach, variously called organic, emblematic, or absolute Surrealism.\n\nBritannica Quiz Ultimate Art Quiz\n\nAt the other pole the viewer is confronted by a world that is completely defined and minutely depicted but that makes no rational sense: fully recognizable, realistically painted images are removed from their normal contexts and reassembled within an ambiguous, paradoxical, or shocking framework. The work aims to provoke a sympathetic response, forcing the viewer to acknowledge the inherent \u201csense\u201d of the irrational and logically inexplicable. The most direct form of this approach was taken by Belgian artist Ren\u00e9 Magritte in simple but powerful paintings such as that portraying a normal table setting that includes a plate holding a slice of ham, from the centre of which stares a human eye. Spanish artist Salvador Dal\u00ed, French painter Pierre Roy, and Belgian artist Paul Delvaux rendered similar but more complex alien worlds that resemble compelling dreamlike scenes.\n\nFrench-born American painter Yves Tanguy\u2019s style was somewhere between the two poles. He often painted with painstaking detail ambiguous forms, which resemble marine invertebrates or sculpturesque rock formations, and set them in barren, brightly lit landscapes that have an infinite horizon."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/jean.hugo/3743152", "page_content": "Jean Hugo\n\nartist designer illustrator writer\n\nNovember 19, 1894 (age 89) Paris, France\n\nJean Hugo is mainly known as the author of a great number of sketches and oil or gouache paintings, which are often small sized. He also created illustrations for books, designed theatre sets, and costumes as well as produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo's first published illustration appeared in 1918. It was a monogram for La Sir\u00e8ne publishing house. Then he also illustrated Les Joues en Feu by Raymond Radiguet, Bernouard, in 1920; Pommes d'Anis by Francis Jammes, Emile-Paul, 1923; Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel by Jean Cocteau, NRF, and Les Amis Nouvel by Paul Morand, Au Sans Pareil, both in 1924; Rom\u00e9o et Juliette by Shakespeare, Au Sans Pareil, in 1926, among others. Jean Hugo\u2019s paintings were unique in the artistic world of the 20th century. They maintained an authentic originality while recalling certain avant-garde themes of metaphysical painting or magical realism. At the start of the 1930s, in between various theatrical projects, including Jean Cocteau\u2019s Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel, he produced a series of masterful artworks, such as Solitude (1933). He was interested in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. Many of his paintings were based on the sketches that he created all the time. He used to say that \"inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it.\" L'Imposteur (1931) was a conclusion of Jean Hugo's first artistic period. Around this time he moved from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, after the death of his grandmother. His painting of that period was a masterful assembly of the most important insights he had acquired so far. The lessons of the Italian primitives, of Poussin, of Henri Rousseau, and Picasso, were among the sources of inspiration on which he was constantly drawing. In the middle of the 1930s, Jean Hugo started to use oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. The artist's work witnessed his intention to work outside of present-day currents and fashionable theories. He never took part in the artistic debates and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public. The artist illustrated many limited edition books published between 1948 and 1984 by Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Benoit (PAB), collaborating with such writers as Ren\u00e9 Char, Marcel Jouhandeau, Tristan Tzara and Ren\u00e9 Crevel. Jean Hugo's artworks were widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the United States. Among the most prominent of them were: Jean Hugo and Max Jacob at the Claridge Gallery, London, 1929; Jean Hugo '77 at the Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977; Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau at Sotheby's, London, 1981; Jean Hugo: 1894-1984 at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985; Jean Hugo: a Retrospective at the Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996; Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne at the Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001; Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien at the Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014, etc."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-hugo", "page_content": "The great-grandson of Victor Hugo, Jean Hugo was a French painter, illustrator, theatre designer and author.

Others have wanted to depict dream worlds or hidden psychological tensions.

In many instances, these artists have turned to political activism. In this way, the revolutionary concepts encouraged by Surrealism has led the movement to be seen as a way of life.\n\nSince its inception, the ideas and art associated with Surrealism have been disseminated, embraced and re-imagined through international networks of exchange and collaboration.

It is an unrelenting revolt against a civilization that reduces all human aspirations to market values, religious impostures, universal boredom and misery.\"\n\n\"[the contribution was in their determination] to tap the creative and imaginative forces of the mind at their source in the unconscious and, through the increase in self-knowledge achieved by confronting people by their real nature, to change society.\"\n\n\"Surrealism had a great effect on me because then I realized that the imagery in my mind wasn't insanity.

Disdaining rationalism and literary realism, and powerfully influenced by psychoanalysis, the Surrealists believed the rational mind repressed the power of the imagination, weighing it down with taboos. Influenced also by Karl Marx, they hoped that the psyche had the power to reveal the contradictions in the everyday world and spur on revolution. Their emphasis on the power of personal imagination puts them in the tradition of Romanticism, but unlike their forebears, they believed that revelations could be found on the street and in everyday life. The Surrealist impulse to tap the unconscious mind, and their interests in myth and primitivism, went on to shape many later movements, and the style remains influential to this today.\n\nKey Ideas & Accomplishments\n\nAndr\u00e9 Breton defined Surrealism as \"psychic automatism in its pure state, by which one proposes to express - verbally, by means of the written word, or in any other manner - the actual functioning of thought.\" What Breton is proposing is that artists bypass reason and rationality by accessing their unconscious mind. In practice, these techniques became known as automatism or automatic writing, which allowed artists to forgo conscious thought and embrace chance when creating art.\n\nThe work of Sigmund Freud was profoundly influential for Surrealists, particularly his book, The Interpretation of Dreams (1899). Freud legitimized the importance of dreams and the unconscious as valid revelations of human emotion and desires; his exposure of the complex and repressed inner worlds of sexuality, desire, and violence provided a theoretical basis for much of Surrealism.\n\nwas profoundly influential for Surrealists, particularly his book, (1899). Freud legitimized the importance of dreams and the unconscious as valid revelations of human emotion and desires; his exposure of the complex and repressed inner worlds of sexuality, desire, and violence provided a theoretical basis for much of Surrealism. Surrealist imagery is probably the most recognizable element of the movement, yet it is also the most elusive to categorize and define. Each artist relied on their own recurring motifs arisen through their dreams or/and unconscious mind. At its basic, the imagery is outlandish, perplexing, and even uncanny, as it is meant to jolt the viewer out of their comforting assumptions. Nature, however, is the most frequent imagery: Max Ernst was obsessed with birds and had a bird alter ego, Salvador Dal\u00ed's works often include ants or eggs, and Joan Mir\u00f3 relied strongly on vague biomorphic imagery.\n\nOverview of Surrealism\n\nArtworks and Artists of Surrealism\n\nCarnival of Harlequin (1924-25) Artist: Joan Mir\u00f3 Mir\u00f3 created elaborate, fantastical spaces in his paintings that are an excellent example of Surrealism in their reliance on dream-like imagery and their use of biomorphism. Biomorphic shapes are those that resemble organic beings but that are hard to identify as any specific thing; the shapes seem to self-generate, morph, and dance on the canvas. While there is the suggestion of a believable three-dimensional space in Carnaval d'Arlequin, the playful shapes are arranged with an all-over quality that is common to many of Mir\u00f3's works during his Surrealist period, and that would eventually lead him to further abstraction. Mir\u00f3 was especially known for his use of automatic writing techniques in the creation of his works, particularly doodling or automatic drawing, which is how he began many of his canvases. He is best known for his works such as this that depict chaotic yet lighthearted interior scenes, taking his influence from Dutch 17th-century interiors. Oil on canvas - Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York The Human Condition (1933) Artist: Ren\u00e9 Magritte The iconic and enigmatic Ren\u00e9 Magritte's works tend to be intellectual, often dealing with visual puns and the relation between the representation of something and the thing itself. In The Human Condition a canvas sits on an easel before a curtained window and reproduces exactly the scene outside the window that would be behind the canvas, thus the image on the easel in a sense becomes the scene, not just a reproduction of the landscape. There is in effect no difference between the two as both are fabrications of the artist. The hyperrealist painting style often used by Surrealists makes the odd setup seem dreamlike. Oil on canvas - Los Angeles County Museum of Art Mama, Papa is Wounded! (1927) Artist: Yves Tanguy The most pivotal moment for Tanguy in his decision to become a painter was his sighting of a canvas by Giorgio de Chirico in a shop window in 1923. The next year, Tanguy, the poet Jacques Pr\u00e9vert, and the actor and screenwriter Marcel Duhamel moved into a house that was to become a gathering place for the Surrealists, a movement he became interested in after reading the periodical La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste. Andr\u00e9 Breton welcomed him into the group in 1925. Tanguy was inspired by the biomorphic forms of Jean Arp, Ernst, and Mir\u00f3, quickly developing his own vocabulary of amoeba-like shapes that populate arid, mysterious settings, no doubt influenced by his youthful travels to Argentina, Brazil, and Tunisia. Despite his lack of formal training, Tanguy's mature style emerged by 1927, characterized by deserted landscapes littered with fantastical rocklike objects painted with a precise illusionism. The works usually have an overcast sky with a view thatseems to stretch endlessly.\n\n\n\nMama, Papa is Wounded depicts Tanguy's most common subject matter of war. The work is painted in a hyperrealist style with his distinctive limited color palette, both of which create a sense of dream-like reality. Tanguy often found the titles of works while looking through psychiatric case histories for compelling statements by patients. Given that, it is difficult to know if this work is relevant to his own family history as he claimed to have imagined the painting in its entirety before he began it. His brother was killed in World War I and the bleakness of the landscape may refer generally to losses suffered in the war by thousands of French families. De Chirico's influence on Tanguy's work is obvious here in his use of falling shadows and a classical torso in the landscape. Oil on Canvas - The Museum of Modern Art, New York Artwork Images The Accommodations of Desire (1929) Artist: Salvador Dal\u00ed Painted in the summer of 1929 just after Dal\u00ed went to Paris for his first Surrealist exhibition, The Accommodations of Desire is a prime example of Dal\u00ed's ability to render his vivid and bizarre dreams with seemingly journalistic accuracy. He developed the paranoid-critical method, which involved systematic irrational thought and self-induced paranoia as a way to access his unconscious. He referred to the resulting works as \"hand-painted dream photographs\" because of their realism coupled with their eerie dream quality. The narrative of this work stems from Dal\u00ed's anxieties over his affair with Gala Eluard, wife of artist Paul Eluard. The lumpish white \"pebbles\" depict his insecurities about his future with Gala, circling around the concepts of terror and decay. While The Accommodations of Desire is an expos\u00e9 of Dal\u00ed's deepest fears, it combines his typical hyper-realistic painting style with more experimental collage techniques. The lion heads are glued onto the canvas, and are believed to have been cut from a children's book. Oil and cut-and-pasted printed paper on canvas - The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Artwork Images The Palace at 4 a.m. (1932) Artist: Alberto Giacometti Giacometti was one of the few Surrealists who focused on sculpture. The Palace at 4 a.m. is a delicate construction that was inspired by his obsession with a lover named Denise the previous year. Of the affair he said, \"a period of six months passed in the presence of a woman who, concentrating all life in herself, transported my every moment into a state of enchantment. We constructed a fantastical palace in the night - a very fragile palace of matches. At the least false movement a whole section would collapse. We always began it again.\" In 1933, he told Breton that he was incapable of making anything that did not have something to do with her.\n\n\n\nThe work includes representations or symbols of his love interest as well as perhaps of his mother. Other imagery, such as the bird, is less easy to interpret. Thus, the work is characterized by its bizarre juxtaposition of objects and a title that is seemingly unrelated to the constructed scene, giving the piece an undercurrent of mystery and tension as if something frightening is about to occur. The work, in its child-like simplicity, captures the fragility of memory and desire. Giacometti's postwar interest in Existentialism is already evident here in how he represents the isolation of the various figures. Wood, glass, wire, and string - The Museum of Modern Art, New York Artwork Images Battle of Fishes (1926) Artist: Andr\u00e9 Masson Masson was one of the most enthusiastic followers of Breton's automatic writing, having begun his own independent experiments in the early 1920s. He would often produce art under exacting conditions, using drugs, going without sleep, or sustenance in order to relax conscious control of his art making so that he could access his unconscious. Masson, along with his neighbors Joan Mir\u00f3, Antonin Artuad, and others would sometimes experiment together. He is best known for his use of sand. In an effort to introduce chance into his works, he would throw glue or gesso onto a canvas and then sand. His oil paintings were made based on the resulting shapes.\n\n\n\nBattle of the Fishes perhaps references his experiences in WWI. He signed up to fight and after three years, was seriously injured, taking months to recover in an army hospital and spending time in a psychiatric facility. He was unable for many years to speak of the things he witnessed as a soldier, but his art consistently depicts massacres, bizarre confrontations, rape, and dismemberment. Masson himself observed that male figures in his art rarely escape unharmed. Battle of Fishes has subdued color, but the fish seem involved in a vicious battle to the death with their razor-like teeth and spilled blood. Masson believed that the use of chance in art would reveal the sadism of all creatures - an idea that he could only reveal in his art. Oil on canvas - The Museum of Modern Art, New York Object (1936) Artist: Meret Oppenheim Oppenheim was one of the few women Surrealists whose work was exhibited with the group. Like Giacometti she worked primarily with objects. This work, also known under the title Luncheon in Fur, with its unsettling juxtaposition of a domestic object and animality, is a quintessential example of Surrealist ideas. The artist makes strange a teacup, saucer, and spoon purchased at typical department store - objects that were familiar are made disturbingly off-putting as the viewer must imagine drinking tea from a fur-covered cup. Fur-covered cup, saucer, and spoon - The Museum of Modern Art, New York Artwork Images The Barbarians (1937) Artist: Max Ernst Max Ernst was known for his automatic writing techniques including frottage, grattage, and collage. Here he uses grattage, which requires taking a painted canvas, placing it on a textured surface, and scraping off paint. The method introduces elements of chance and unpredictability to the work as the artist is forced to release some control of the creative process. The grattaged canvas was then used by Ernst as inspiration for further imagery. The Barbarians is typically Surrealist as it is fraught with bizarre juxtapositions, mysterious figures, and dream-inspired symbols. The bird imagery is one of the staples of Ernst's work - he experienced a childhood trauma related to the death of his pet bird and as an adult developed a bird alter ego named Loplop. Oil on wood with painted wood elements - The Museum of Modern Art, New York Artwork Images Mannequin (1938) Artist: Man Ray Mannequin depicts Andr\u00e9 Masson's mannequin at the Exposition International du Surrealisme, Galerie des Beaux-Arts, in Paris 1938. Joan Mir\u00f3, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Maurice Henry, and others also designed these weird mannequins to fill a room with uncanny female forms that looked both monstrous and sexually alluring. Man Ray photographed them all as discreet characters, of which this is one example. He repeatedly photographed his assistant, artist Lee Miller, and many other women, both living and inanimate. Like Hans Bellmer, an artist peripherally associated with the group, Ray was obsessed with the female form as the perfect embodiment of male desire, and sought to capture it formally in fantastical ways. Man Ray also pioneered many photographic techniques, including rayographs, named after himself, that incorporate elements of chance and in which subjects appear to glow in dream-like silver auras. Assemblage of wood, oil, metal, board on board, with artist's frame - National Gallery of Australia Artwork Images Birthday (1942) Artist: Dorothea Tanning Birthday is a self-portrait that Dorothea Tanning painted to commemorate her 30th birthday. Viewed up close, one notices the infinite rooms recessing into the background, symbolizing Tanning's unconscious mind. Many Surrealists felt architectural imagery was well-suited to expressing notions of a labyrinthine self that changes and expands over time; Birthday is one of the best examples of this. Also notable is the gargoyle at the subject's feet. Tanning said this was her rendition of a lemur, which has been associated with death spirits. Tanning juxtaposed natural imagery, like the skirt made of roots, against objects representing high culture, like fancy apparel and interior design, to pay homage to culture as well as to express nature and wilderness as a feminine construct. Oil on canvas - The Philadelphia Museum of Art\n\nBeginnings of Surrealism\n\nSurrealism grew out of the Dada movement, which was also in rebellion against middle-class complacency. Artistic influences, however, came from many different sources. The most immediate influence for several of the Surrealists was Giorgio de Chirico, their contemporary who, like them, used bizarre imagery with unsettling juxtapositions (and his Metaphysical Painting movement). They were also drawn to artists from the recent past who were interested in primitivism, the naive, or fantastical imagery, such as Gustave Moreau, Arnold Bocklin, Odilon Redon, and Henri Rousseau. Even artists from as far back as the Renaissance, such as Giuseppe Arcimboldo and Hieronymous Bosch, provided inspiration in so far as these artists were not overly concerned with aesthetic issues involving line and color, but instead felt compelled to create what Surrealists thought of as the \"real.\"\n\nThe Surrealist movement began as a literary group strongly allied to Dada, emerging in the wake of the collapse of Dada in Paris, when Andr\u00e9 Breton's eagerness to bring purpose to Dada clashed with Tristan Tzara's anti-authoritarianism. Breton, who is occasionally described as the 'Pope' of Surrealism, officially founded the movement in 1924 when he wrote \"The Surrealist Manifesto.\" However, the term \"surrealism,\" was first coined in 1917 by Guillaume Apollinaire when he used it in program notes for the ballet Parade, written by Pablo Picasso, Leonide Massine, Jean Cocteau, and Erik Satie.\n\nAround the same time that Breton published his inaugural manifesto, the group began publishing the journal La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste, which was largely focused on writing, but also included art reproductions by artists such as de Chirico, Ernst, Andr\u00e9 Masson, and Man Ray. Publication continued until 1929.\n\nThe Bureau for Surrealist Research or Centrale Surr\u00e9aliste was also established in Paris in 1924. This was a loosely affiliated group of writers and artists who met and conducted interviews to \"gather all the information possible related to forms that might express the unconscious activity of the mind.\" Headed by Breton, the Bureau created a dual archive: one that collected dream imagery and one that collected material related to social life. At least two people manned the office each day - one to greet visitors and the other to write down the observations and comments of the visitors that then became part of the archive. In January of 1925, the Bureau officially published its revolutionary intent that was signed by 27 people, including Breton, Ernst, and Masson.\n\nSurrealism: Concepts, Styles, and Trends\n\nSurrealism shared much of the anti-rationalism of Dada, the movement out of which it grew. The original Parisian Surrealists used art as a reprieve from violent political situations and to address the unease they felt about the world's uncertainties. By employing fantasy and dream imagery, artists generated creative works in a variety of media that exposed their inner minds in eccentric, symbolic ways, uncovering anxieties and treating them analytically through visual means.\n\nSurrealist Paintings\n\nThere were two styles or methods that distinguished Surrealist painting. Artists such as Salvador Dal\u00ed, Yves Tanguy, and Ren\u00e9 Magritte painted in a hyper-realistic style in which objects were depicted in crisp detail and with the illusion of three-dimensionality, emphasizing their dream-like quality. The color in these works was often either saturated (Dal\u00ed) or monochromatic (Tanguy), both choices conveying a dream state.\n\nSeveral Surrealists also relied heavily on automatism or automatic writing as a way to tap into the unconscious mind. Artists such as Joan Mir\u00f3 and Max Ernst used various techniques to create unlikely and often outlandish imagery including collage, doodling, frottage, decalcomania, and grattage. Artists such as Hans Arp also created collages as stand-alone works.\n\nHyperrealism and automatism were not mutually exclusive. Miro, for example, often used both methods in one work. In either case, however the subject matter was arrived at or depicted, it was always bizarre - meant to disturb and baffle.\n\nSurrealist Objects and Sculptures\n\nBreton felt that the object had been in a state of crisis since the early-19th century and thought this impasse could be overcome if the object in all its strangeness could be seen as if for the first time. The strategy was not to make Surreal objects for the sake of shocking the middle class a la Dada but to make objects \"surreal\" by what he called d\u00e9payesment or estrangement. The goal was the displacement of the object, removing it from its expected context, \"defamilarizing\" it. Once the object was removed from its normal circumstances, it could be seen without the mask of its cultural context. These incongruous combinations of objects were also thought to reveal the fraught sexual and psychological forces hidden beneath the surface of reality.\n\nA limited number of Surrealists are known for their three-dimensional work. Arp, who began as part of the Dada movement, was known for his biomorphic objects. Oppenheim's pieces were bizarre combinations that removed familiar objects from their everyday context, while Giacometti's were more traditional sculptural forms, many of which were human-insect hybrid figures. Dal\u00ed, less known for his 3D work, did produce some interesting installations, particularly, Rainy Taxi (1938), which was an automobile with mannequins and a series of pipes that created \"rain\" in the car's interior.\n\nSurrealist Sculpture - Movement Page\n\nSurrealist Photography\n\nPhotography, because of the ease with which it allowed artists to produce uncanny imagery, occupied a central role in Surrealism. Artists such as Man Ray and Maurice Tabard used the medium to explore automatic writing, using techniques such as double exposure, combination printing, montage, and solarization, the latter of which eschewed the camera altogether. Other photographers used rotation or distortion to render bizarre images.\n\nThe Surrealists also appreciated the prosaic photograph removed from its mundane context and seen through the lens of Surrealist sensibility. Vernacular snapshots, police photographs, movie stills, and documentary photographs all were published in Surrealist journals like La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste and Minotaure, totally disconnected from their original purposes. The Surrealists, for example, were enthusiastic about Eug\u00e8ne Atget's photographs of Paris. Published in 1926 in La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste at the prompting of his neighbor, Man Ray, Atget's imagery of a quickly vanishing Paris was understood as impulsive visions. Atget's photographs of empty streets and shop windows recalled the Surrealist's own vision of Paris as a \"dream capital.\"\n\nDada & Surrealist Photography - Movement Page\n\nSurrealist Film\n\nSurrealism was the first artistic movement to experiment with cinema in part because it offered more opportunity than theatre to create the bizarre or the unreal. The first film characterized as Surrealist was the 1924 Entr'acte, a 22-minute, silent film, written by Rene Clair and Francis Picabia, and directed by Clair. But, the most famous Surrealist filmmaker was of course Luis Bu\u00f1uel. Working with Dal\u00ed, Bu\u00f1uel made the classic films Un Chien Andalou (1929) and L'Age d'Or (1930), both of which were characterized by narrative disjunction and their peculiar, sometimes disturbing imagery. In the 1930s Joseph Cornell produced surrealist films in the United States, such as Rose Hobart (1936). Salvador Dal\u00ed designed a dream sequence for Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound (1945).\n\nSurrealist Film - Movement Page\n\nThe Rise and Decline of Surrealism\n\nThough Surrealism originated in France, strains of it can be identified in art throughout the world. Particularly in the 1930s and 1940s, many artists were swept into its orbit as increasing political upheaval and a second global war encouraged fears that human civilization was in a state of crisis and collapse. The emigration of many Surrealists to the Americas during WWII spread their ideas further. Following the war, however, the group's ideas were challenged by the rise of Existentialism, which, while also celebrating individualism, was more rationally based than Surrealism. In the arts, the Abstract Expressionists incorporated Surrealist ideas and usurped their dominance by pioneering new techniques for representing the unconscious. Breton became increasingly interested in revolutionary political activism as the movement's primary goal. The result was the dispersal of the original movement into smaller factions of artists. The Bretonians, such as Roberto Matta, believed that art was inherently political. Others, like Yves Tanguy, Max Ernst, and Dorothea Tanning, remained in America to separate from Breton. Salvador Dal\u00ed, likewise, retreated to Spain, believing in the centrality of the individual in art.\n\nLater Developments - After Surrealism\n\nAbstract Expressionism\n\nIn 1936, the Museum of Modern Art in New York staged an exhibition entitled Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism, and many American artists were powerfully impressed by it. Some, such as Jackson Pollock, began to experiment with automatism, and with imagery that seemed to derive from the unconscious - experiments which would later lead to his \"drip\" paintings. Robert Motherwell, similarly, is said to have been \"stuck between the two worlds\" of abstraction and automatism.\n\nLargely because of political upheaval in Europe, New York rather than Paris became the emergent center of a new vanguard, one that favored tapping the unconscious through abstraction as opposed to the \"hand-painted dreams\" of Salvador Dal\u00ed. Peggy Guggenheim's 1942 exhibition of Surrealist-influenced artists (Rothko, Gottlieb, Motherwell, Baziotes, Hoffman, Still, and Pollock) alongside European artists Mir\u00f3, Klee, and Masson, underscores the speed with which Surrealist concepts spread through the New York art community.\n\nAbstract Expressionism Movement Page\n\nFeminism and Women Surrealists\n\nThe Surrealists have often been depicted as a tightly knit group of men, and their art often envisioned women as wild \"others\" to the cultured, rational world. Work by feminist art historians has since corrected this impression, not only highlighting the number of women Surrealists who were active in the group, particularly in the 1930s, but also analyzing the gender stereotypes at work in much Surrealist art. Feminist art critics, such as Dawn Ades, Mary Ann Caws, and Whitney Chadwick, have devoted several books and exhibitions to this subject.\n\nWhile most of the male Surrealists, especially Man Ray, Magritte, and Dal\u00ed, repeatedly focused on and/or distorted the female form and depicted women as muses, much in the way that male artists had for centuries, female Surrealists such as Claude Cahun, Lee Miller, Leonora Carrington, and Dorothea Tanning, sought to address the problematic adoption of Freudian psychoanalysis that often cast women as monstrous and lesser. Thus, many female Surrealists experimented with cross-dressing and depicted themselves as animals or mythic creatures.\n\nBritish Surrealism\n\nInterestingly, many notable female Surrealists were British. Examples include Eileen Agar, Ithell Colquhoun, Edith Rimmington, and Emmy Bridgwater. Particular to the British interpretation of Surrealist ideology was an ongoing exploration of human relations with their surrounding natural environment and most prominently, with the sea. Alongside Agar, Paul Nash developed an interest in the object trouv\u00e9, usually in the form of items collected from the beach. The focus on the border where land meets the sea, and where rocks anthropomorphically resemble people struck a cord with British identity and more generally, with Surrealist principles of reconciling and uniting opposites.\n\nThe International Surrealist Exhibition (1936) held in London was a particular catalyst for many British artists. Headed by Roland Penrose and Herbert Read, the movement thrived in Britain, creating the international icons Leonora Carrington and Lee Miller, and also spurring on the practice of another important circle of artists surrounding Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth, and Henry Moore. Overall, the privileging of an eccentric imagination and essential rejection of standardized and rational modes of doing things resonated well from the outset. This golden period for art in general in the UK, and more specifically the legacies of British Surrealism continue to influence the country\u2019s art practice today.\n\nUseful Resources on Surrealism\n\nSimilar Art"}, {"url": "https://daily.jstor.org/victor-hugo-surrealist-artist/", "page_content": "French author Victor Hugo completed Les Mis\u00e9rables, his sprawling tome of social injustice, while in political exile on the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey between 1852 and 1870. What many don\u2019t know is that he also created hundreds of ink drawings. The 1862 book is now a classic, adapted into films and one of the most popular musicals of the twentieth century; the art remains obscure. Yet in the use of automatic drawing, and manipulations of ink blots, his artwork anticipates the avant-garde movements that followed.\n\nThe images seem to burble murkily out of the subconscious: shapes of ships tossed by waves, a hanged man suspended in a wash of tawny ink, and abstract forms accented with the author\u2019s own fingerprints. Many were made by allowing ink to move impulsively. Even more playful caricatures used elements of chance in their creation.\n\nHugo used the same materials in art as in writing\u2014ink and a quill, both its nib and feather.\n\n\u201cAmong Hugo\u2019s numerous, varied, and richly inventive drawings are several caricatural graphic meanderings that, in their avoidance of a preappointed image, are harbingers of the automatic drawings developed by the Surrealists,\u201d writes art historian Aim\u00e9e Brown Price in Art Journal.\n\nHugo used the same materials in art as in writing\u2014ink and a quill, both its nib and feather. But unlike his elaborately structured novels, where characters\u2019 lives intersect across years against tableaux of French history, his drawings were a place of fluid experimentation. He drew with his non-dominant hand; he splashed stencils with ink; he incorporated impressions from lace.\n\nArt historian Mignon Nixon notes that the drawings \u201cin which the artist manipulated chance formations of ink by tilting or folding the soaked or spattered sheets, experimented more freely with the very medium that was also the technical support for his poetic scripting.\u201d Nixon cites Georges Hugo\u2019s description of his grandfather at work:\n\nHe scattered the ink haphazardly, crushing the goose quill which grated and spattered trails of ink. Then he sort of kneaded the black blot which became a castle, a forest, a deep lake or a stormy sky; he delicately wet the barb of his pen with his lips and with it burst a cloud from which rain fell down onto the wet paper; or he used it to indicate precisely the mists blurring the horizon.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to make a direct line from Hugo\u2019s art to the automatic drawings of the 1920s Surrealists. In reality, however, Hugo was responding to the free-flowing communication that was part of nineteenth-century Spiritualism. The author attended s\u00e9ances during his exile, and actively kept a diary of dreams.\n\n\u201cIt was above all on the basis of these technical experiments that Andr\u00e9 Breton later declared Hugo one of the forerunners of surrealism,\u201d explains art historian Stefanie Heraeus, as translated by Deborah Laurie Cohen, in History Workshop Journal. \u201cAgainst the background of Hugo\u2019s intensive involvement with dreams and his interest in s\u00e9ances, it seems reasonable to interpret his controlled dialogue with chance as a pictorial strategy intended to evoke unseen forces.\u201d\n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nGet your fix of JSTOR Daily\u2019s best stories in your inbox each Thursday.\n\nPrivacy Policy Contact Us\n\nYou may unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the provided link on any marketing message. \u0394\n\nAside from a few appearances in print, Hugo\u2019s art was not exhibited in his lifetime.

Drawing upon theories in psychoanalysis, this revolutionary art movement reached deep into the psyche. By provoking intense intellectual and emotional inquiry in this way, it changed the face of modern art.\n\nWhat Is Surrealism?\n\nThe word Surrealism refers to an art movement that entered the unsuspecting art world in the mid-1920s. It was officially founded by Andr\u00e9 Breton, a Parisian poet. Surrealism became a formal art movement, with a strong political, philosophical and social undercurrent that defined the methods used to elicit shock and curiosity among its following. Its ground-breaking attempt to cut through the pre-existing norms of the time spread to Europe and the USA in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nSurrealist art was an outcry against the rationality that its proponents saw as a dominating and destructive force in society, and indeed in the minds of people, that was responsible for much of the social ills of the time. Through cinema, art, and literature, Surrealist artists let their unconscious minds take center stage as they used a variety of techniques to map the clockwork of their dreams and innermost imaginings.\n\nWhile Surrealism allowed a platform for the exploration of their unconscious minds, Surrealist artworks also encouraged viewers to explore and evaluate theirs, through distorted and bizarre imagery that was inspired not by logical, rational thinking, but rather the absurd events and images that emerged in the dream-state, or images that were derived simply from uninhibited free-form drawing or painting.\n\nThese shocking, illogical, and challenging compositions were not bound to the confines of the rules and social mores that were seen to govern art and society at the time, and which people might expect from art.\n\nThe Birth of Surrealism Art\n\nThe period surrounding the world wars was fraught with scenes of violence and horror, and it was his own experience as a nurse that inspired Andr\u00e9 Breton to write his first few poems. In 1924, Breton published The Surrealist Manifesto, which summarized answers to the question \u201cwhat is Surrealism?\u201d. The Manifesto covered the range of ideas that underpinned surrealism as a movement that was inextricably linked with psychoanalytic theories of the unconscious as a force that was behind all creative endeavors. His Surrealism art definition was as follows:\n\n\u201cLet us not lose sight of the fact that the idea of Surrealism aims quite simply at the total recovery of our psychic force by a means which is nothing other than the dizzying descent into ourselves, the systematic illumination of hidden places, and the progressive darkening of other places\u2026\u201d\n\nThe movement became notorious for being exclusive and rejecting members because they were not seen to conform to the ideals put described in the manifesto. Breton drew up a revised version of the manifesto in 1930, to describe an updated version of his Surrealism art definition.\n\nRobert Delaunay\u2019s illustration on the cover of Yvan Goll\u2019s Surr\u00e9alisme, Manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme, 1924; Robert Delaunay, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe movement was named after Guillaume Apollinaire, an innovative poet, and art critic, who was the first to use the word \u201csurrealist\u201d as a subtitle for one of his most scandalous plays. He was widely known as an art critic and member of the Cubist art movement and was a source of great inspiration to the next generation of artists whose artwork embodied the characteristics of Surrealism.\n\nThe first Surrealist exhibition to take place was La Peinture Surr\u00e9alist, which was held in Paris. It took place in 1925 in Paris and featured the works of Pablo Picasso, Man Ray, and Paul Klee (among many others).\n\nOriginating in Paris, the Surrealist art movement soon swept through Europe, claiming the imaginations of many artists at the time. And, although Surrealism became notorious for banishing those who were found not to conform to the ideals that defined the movement, it soon took hold of artists in the USA when many of the major Surrealist artists had no other choice but to flee Europe and to move, and exhibit their art and philosophy, in the USA.\n\nThe contagious ideals of this movement that challenged the bedrock of society spread like wildfire in the art world there. Surrealism also influenced artists in South America.\n\nSurreal Influences\n\nSurrealism art was unlike other art movements in the way that it took a step into deeper aspects of the human experience, daring to delve into deeper realms untouched by other artists to summon to the light hidden parts of the human unconscious.\n\nChrist in Limbo (1550) by a follower of Hieronymous Bosch; Follower of Hieronymus Bosch, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nBut it was also multi-faceted in the sense that it was not defined by a specific style or combination of artistic elements. Like most other artforms, Surrealism was influenced by other artists and other art movements. Specifically, it was influenced by, for example, the images brought to life by artists like Hieronymus Bosch and Francisco Goya. Other artists that inspired the Surrealist movement included Odilon Redon and Marc Chagall.\n\nDadaism\n\nSurrealism inherited its fierce opposition to rationality from Dadaism, which was an art movement that shook early 20th century Europe and New York. The Dada movement was created in protest to the war, and the social and cultural structures that were characteristic of the time.\n\nArtists that identified with it used spontaneity, teamwork, and chance or luck to produce their work. Challenging traditional, rigid approaches to art, they focused mainly on creating collage and photomontage rather than the more traditional painting and sculpture to redefine the meaning of art.\n\nCabaret Voltaire (1916) by Hugo Ball; Unknown author Unknown author, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nAlthough there was a definite socio-political flavor to Surrealist art, the heart of the movement lay not in replicating other artworks or ideas, but in being a highly personal project that invited both the artists and the viewers to relinquish all conceptions of what art should be and turn inward. This self-reflection opened up space for what the Surrealists regarded as the ultimate reality to take form through the super-imposition of the conscious with the unconscious, resulting in a creative work that escapes the understanding of the rational mind.\n\nThis experimental entry into the deeper world of the subconscious found its origin in the psychoanalytic works of Freud and perhaps Jungian ideas as well. The role of dreams, therefore, played an inevitable role in defining some of the content that was included in several paintings.\n\nThe Bureau for Surrealist Research\n\nIn addition to the publication of The Surrealist Manifesto in 1924, this year also saw the formation of the Bureau for Surrealist Research in Paris. This was a collection of artists and writers who were concerned with building a portfolio of information relating to how the unconscious mind reveals itself.\n\nCover of La Revolution Surrealiste Magazine, Volume 8, 1926; Collective, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThis information was collected in two ways. Firstly, it was collected through recording dreams. Secondly, a record was kept of the behavior and responses of the people who visited the office. In the same year, the journal La Revolution Surrealiste started being published, which included the writings of Max Ernst and Man Ray.\n\nSurrealist Literature, Sculpture, and Cinema\n\nAlthough art is the most well-known expression of Surrealist ideas, these passionate philosophies, that brought taboo and repressed topics to the fore, had a strong presence in literature, sculpture, and cinema as well.\n\nLobster Telephone (1936) by Salvador Dali; Nasch92, CC BY 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nLiterature\n\nThe first text, Les champs Magnetiques (The Magnetic Fields) that claimed the identity of being associated with \u201cSurrealism\u201d, and which used the technique of automatic writing, was written by Andr\u00e9 Breton and Phillipe Soupault.\n\nNotable Surrealist poets include Andr\u00e9 Breton, Paul \u00c9luard, Louis Aragon, Pierre Reverdy, Michel Leiris, Antonin Artaud, Ren\u00e9 Crevel, and Robert Desnos. The words, through the poets, were the vessels or the conduit for the conscious expression of the unconscious.\n\nPhotograph of Robert Desnos taken in 1924; Menerbes, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nIn addition to Surrealist poetry, a number of journals were published between 1920 and 1940 as well, including La R\u00e9volution Surr\u00e9aliste, Le Surr\u00e9alisme au service de la r\u00e9volution and a magazine called Minotaure.\n\nSculpture\n\nSurrealism sculptures embodied the same principles as the other forms of Surrealism, only they introduced the element of three-dimensionality and touch to the idea of bringing the unconscious to life. This made the artwork more interactive and accessible to the viewer.\n\nFountain (1917) by Marcel Duchamp; Marcel Duchamp, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nSurrealism sculptures may not be as popular as the paintings, but they have had a lasting influence on creative art in the 21st century. Some of the most widely known sculptures include the work of Man Ray and Marcel Du Champ.\n\nCinema\n\nSurrealist cinema is relatively unique when compared to other styles, in its expression of the unconscious, or dream-like state, not only through imagery and story but in the way that it is compiled in an illogical and often unpredictable way. Like Surrealist painting, Surrealist films share a few characteristics in common that relate not so much to content as to the way the films are compiled to bring people out of their comfortable cocoons of ignorance or inactivity.\n\nLuis Bu\u00f1uel is considered one of the key figures in the establishment of Surrealist cinema, which was aimed at stimulating thought and bringing out intense emotional responses, often achieved by playing on people\u2019s fears. The Seashell and the Clergyman (1928) is widely held to be the first official Surrealist film. It was the collaborative brain-child of by Germain Dulac and Antonin Artaud.\n\nFrame from the movie The Seashell and the Clergyman (1928) by Germaine Dulac; Germaine Dulac (1882-1942), Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nSurrealist films contain a considerable dose of shock-value, achieved possibly by bombarding the audience with shocking imagery that may or may not resemble dreams and nightmares, and with the presentation of objects in contexts, one wouldn\u2019t normally associate them with. Add to this, characters who seemingly lack a moral compass and a plot that does not have a chronological flow, and you have a classically Surrealist film.\n\nNotable Surrealist Artists\n\nIn its hey-day, the tenets of Surrealism were represented by many artists from all across the world. Although Surrealism started in Paris, the membership of the Surrealist art movement reflected the cosmopolitanism of Europe itself. Many of the towering figures that bore the Surrealist flag with integrity and flourish were from various cultures, including Spain, Germany, and Holland, not to mention New York.\n\nPhotograph of the Members of the Art et Libert\u00e9 Group, an Egyptian Surrealist group. Front row, left to right: Jean Moscatelli, Kamel el Telmissany, Angelo de Riz, Ramses Younan, Fouad Kamel. Back row, left to right: Albert Cossery, unidentified, Georges Henein, Maurice Fahmy, Raoul Curiel (1941); The Younan Family Archive, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe movement captured the spirit of the tumultuous time after the war, and the feelings in the aftermath transcended international boundaries. Some of the more famous works that have stood the test of time include those of Salvador Dali, Pablo Picasso, Jean Arp, Yves Tanguy, Man Ray, Andre Masson, Leonora Carrington, and Rene Magritte.\n\nSalvador Dali (1904\u20131989)\n\nAssimilating several artistic styles in art school, Spain-born Salvador Dali\u2019s work flew to new heights once he started exploring the works of Freud, and when he started associating himself with the Surrealist movement. These influences are clearly evident in his early work.\n\nHowever, later in his career, his political views started to deviate from those of the Surrealist movement, and, for this reason, he was told to leave. His work started to take on a different flavor, drawing inspiration from artists such as Raphael, the Renaissance artist. The creative blood ran thick through Dali, and he continued to bring his artistic flair to other endeavors like interior decorating for high-end stores and designing jewelry.\n\nPortrait of Salvador Dali, taken in H\u00f4tel Meurice, Paris (1972) by Allan Warren; Allan warren, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nOne of the methods that Dali used to break the shackles of his mind, was to induce a hypnotic state through what he called the \u201cparanoiac-critical method\u201d. This involved him intentionally making himself paranoid, making irrational associations between things that weren\u2019t related, to reach a delusional state that provided the basis for the images that he included in his art. The legend of Dali is still alive in modern culture not only because of his art and method. He had a way of embodying the absurd, of bringing his creativity to life through life itself.\n\nPersistence of Memory (1931)\n\nDali was and still is, known for his wide range of surreal paintings. One of the most famous works that have him etched in the annals of time as one of the predominant figures in the Surrealist movement is The Persistence of Memory. Despite its enormous presence in the history of art and modern culture, the painting is humble in size \u2013 slightly larger than a piece of paper and is exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Dali brought this painting to life at the tender age of 28.\n\nProfile of Time (1984) by Salvador Dali; Julo, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Persistence of Memory is presented as a deserted landscape, interrupted only by melting clocks that are draped over a dead tree. There is also a shape-less flesh-colored object near the center of the painting (which Dali claimed to be a representation of himself), upon which another clock is unceremoniously draped. This landscape has been identified as Dali\u2019s hometown, Catalonia.\n\nPablo Picasso (1881-1973)\n\nPablo Picasso is another artist whose legend remains with us today. The son of an art professor in Spain, Picasso grew up under the wing of his father. Early on in his career, however, he deviated from the traditional art forms that he had come to know as a child.\n\nAlthough Picasso is more often associated with Cubism (being one of the founders of this movement), his later work was influenced by Surrealism in a big way. Never quite an official member of the movement, he was strongly connected with many of the major proponents of the movement, including Breton himself. His art embodied some of the Surrealist ideologies that made the Surrealist movement what it was.\n\nPhotograph of Pablo Picasso taken in 1962; Argentina. Revista Vea y Lea, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nHe spent a period of his life moving between France and Spain. Eventually, though, the colorful bourgeois life of Paris took hold of his imagination after he was swept off his feet by the passion and romance of the intellectual and artistic flair that characterized the Parisian atmosphere in early the early 20th century. He found himself unable to resist the temptation of finding passage to stay in France on a more permanent basis.\n\nAlthough best known for the distorted imagery he brought to life through his painting, Picasso channeled his creativity into sculpting, ceramics, and poetry as well. By the end of his lifetime, he had conjured into existence more than 20,000 pieces of art, including prints, ceramics, and costumes.\n\nPicasso\u2019s painting changed in style considerably over his lifetime. Some of the paintings took on the distorted, almost dreamlike quality of surrealist artists. At other times, though, his style of painting took on the awkward juxtaposition of various geometric shapes to make up everyday objects, figures, and portraits.\n\nMousquetaire, T\u00eate (1967) by Pablo Picasso; Mika58, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nPicasso\u2019s work was, to some extent, defined by the colors he was using during different periods in his life. Some of the early paintings he created in Spain, for example, have been grouped into a category called \u201cthe Blue Period\u201d, as they comprised mostly blues. Upon arriving in France, he took on a more rose-colored tone to his work. Hence, some of his paintings that emerged from the honeymoon phase of his life in France belong to the \u201cRose Period\u201d of his paintings.\n\nAlthough not all of his paintings were political, nor conformed to the Surrealist ideals, Picasso summarizes his opinion of the meaning of creative life: \u201cPainting is not made to decorate apartments. It is an offensive and defensive weapon against the enemy.\u201d\n\nThe Red Armchair (1931)\n\nPicasso had intimate relationships with different women throughout his life, each inspired him. Indeed, changes in his painting style can be seen to correspond with the entry of a new feminine muse into his life.\n\nOne of his famous Surrealist paintings, The Red Armchair is a portrait of Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter, a married woman who was 28 years older than Picasso. It shows a woman sitting on a chair with a frontal and side view of her face.\n\nThis dual perspective is sometimes interpreted as an acknowledgment of their secret affair. This painting was one of many portraits of Walter that were created for an exhibition at Galeries Georges Petit.\n\nIn this painting, Picasso uses industrial house paint (Ripolin) in creative and skillful ways. He was fond of this medium because of the solid finish it gave by pouring it directly onto canvas, and because of its bright colors. In this painting, he mixed the paint with oil to produce interesting effects.\n\nJoan Mir\u00f3 (1893-1983)\n\nBreton described him as one of the best examples of a Surrealist artist. Today, he is considered to be an abstract artist with distinctly Surrealist qualities. Unlike Picasso, Mir\u00f3 did not grow up under the artistic influence of his parents who insisted that he go to commercial college; his father was a watchmaker and goldsmith.\n\nMir\u00f3 had a breakdown after having worked as a clerk for two years. At this point, he started studying art and had a teacher who sympathized with his need for engaging concretely with the subjects he was painting.\n\nEarly on in his artistic career, Mir\u00f3 focused on painting landscapes, portraits, and nudes and was influenced largely by Fauvism and Cubism at that time, but the content of what he painted and the philosophy that underpinned his artistic creations had strong similarities with Dadaism and Surrealism. It was mainly between 1925 and 1928 that his artwork started to metamorphize into true Surrealist paintings in the way that they depicted imaginary scenes that resembled the dream-world. He signed The Surrealist Manifesto in 1924.\n\nLike the other artists, he was also struck by the cultural upsurge in Paris and for many years he, like Dali, traveled between his country of origin and France. Like many other artists of the age, he felt moved by the atrocities of the war as well as the socio-political climate of the time and used art to communicate his political views and mood.\n\nAt a later stage, he started working with Jos\u00e9 Llorens in the pottery world, making artistic choices that challenged people\u2019s expectations of the art form, in a very Surrealist fashion.\n\nDog Barking at the Moon (1926)\n\nThe Dog Barking at the Moon is one of Mir\u00f3\u2019s most well-known paintings. It came into being while he was living in Spain. This painting depicts an animal that vaguely resembles a dog, with a ladder on the left stretching into the night sky. The moon is on the far right of the picture, painted with a red nose and a heart. It is set against a night sky on an eerie surface that, to no small degree, reflects the alien landscape of Catalonia, where the artist grew up. The Surrealist qualities are no mystery in this painting, and it has a humorous quality to it that became characteristic of Miro\u2019s later work.\n\nSurrealist Styles and Techniques\n\nSurreal paintings were defined not so much by recognizable characteristics than by the philosophy that inspired the use of certain techniques to convey the intention of the artwork and allow it to achieve its aims. Some of the Surrealist work of Picasso, for example, is different in style to that of Max Ernst. Artists changed their styles over time and even tended to use different styles and techniques in a single artwork.\n\nLes Voix Int\u00e9rieures (\u2018Inner Voices\u2019, 1985) by Didier Mazuru; Didier Mazuru, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nSome of the techniques used include automatism, collage, frottage, and grattage. To rescue the \u201cobject\u201d from its unfortunate fate of being victim to interpretation in terms of over-familiar contexts, Breton refers to \u201cestrangement\u201d as the process of removing objects from the normal circumstances in which we expect to see them and placing them in an entirely new one. This allows viewers the opportunity to develop a new understanding of that object that is not influenced by culture.\n\nAutomatism\n\nOne of the defining features of the relentless mission of Surrealism to challenge people to peer into their subconscious is referred to as \u201cautomatism\u201d. This practice allowed for creativity to emerge unfiltered by the rational mind and rules that governed traditional artistic pursuit. Automatism is often used in writing, where the writer allows a stream of words to flow uninhibited, and the same process was applied to Surrealist painting.\n\nAutomatic writing demonstrated by the magician William Marriott in 1910; William Marriott, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nFrottage and Grattage\n\nSurrealism is defined more by the underlying philosophy that informs the content that is portrayed, rather than being limited to a certain medium or style. However, some techniques were developed which many artists felt helped to make the artworks entice the viewer into thinking more laterally.\n\nPassage Noir (\u2018Black Passage\u2019, 1923) by Max Ernst; Pedro Ribeiro Sim\u00f5es from Lisboa, Portugal, CC BY 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThese methods were thought to help viewers to explore the recesses of their subconscious mind by allowing them to witness the negative spaces left by techniques like frottage and grattage. Frottage is when the artist creates a textured surface and lightly rubs it with a soft material such as a crayon. Grattage refers to when pieces of paint are removed in some way.\n\nFreeform\n\nSurrealism set the bar for a new type of art that did not conform to any particular style and was rather defined by its philosophy, ideals, and content. The emphasis on the role of the unconscious in creating art, and the blatant anti-rationalism of the movement translated into freeform artistic expression on the canvas. This was in stark contrast to the rigid, highly structured Cubism that was also making waves in the art scene in the early to mid-twentieth century.\n\nAllereerste Gedachten (\u2018First Thoughts\u2019, 2004) by Willem den Broeder; Willem den Broeder, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nSurrealism Today\n\nThe influence of the thought-provoking and sometimes disturbing images that did emerge from the Surrealist artists\u2019 minds continues to capture the attention, prod the curiosity and stimulate the minds of audiences even today. Decades after the movement, it continues to influence the art world. Absurdism, for example, remains strongly inspired by it. The works of Michael Cheval, for example, which grew in popularity in the new millennium, are testimony to the echoes that Surrealism has left in more modern creative minds. Some of the work of Anatole Krasnyansky, an American-Ukrainian water-color artist, also embody the Surrealist content and style.\n\nSurrealism was unlike any art movement that had gone before. As a direct response to the atrocities of war, it challenged the socio-political status quo that was held to be responsible for the social problems of the time. Drawing from theories of the unconscious, its depth was oceanic and transcended the boundaries of space and time. Bold and innovative in its political statements, it shook the art world for decades to come.\n\nTake a look at our Surrealism webstory here!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat Is the Main Idea of Surrealism?\n\nThe Surrealist art movement challenged the rationality that was seen to govern early 20th-century French society. It was based on the idea that true reality, and creativity, came from the unconscious and that, through the exploration of the unconscious, a superior form of reality could be experienced.\n\nHow Is Surrealism Used Today?\n\nSurrealism has affected the art (especially in absurdism) as well as the literary and academic world. The famous works of prominent Surrealist figures continue to provide an avenue for the expression of taboo subjects, feelings, and ideas through two-D and 3-D art, fashion, cinema, and literature.\n\nWhat are the Characteristics of Surrealism?\n\nBeing an abstract art that is not confined to a specific style, Surrealist art can take many forms. You may identify it by the use of distorted images, dreamscapes, symbolism, and the bizarre representation and combination of ordinary objects. It is known for being absurd and provoking a range of responses.\n\nWhat Is an Example of Surrealism?\n\nDuring the early 1920s, several well-known artists belonged to the Surrealist Movement. These included Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso. One of the most famous pieces is The Persistence of Memory by Salvador Dali.\n\nWhat Are Some Techniques Used to Make Surrealism Art?\n\nAutomatism is a popularly used technique that allows the artist to express their unconscious, without their art being defined by the rational mind. Surrealism involves uninhibited artistic expression. Frottage and Grattage are also commonly used, which allows the viewer to see negative spaces and thereby promotes lateral thinking and the exploration of their minds. Frottage is when color is rubbed lightly over a textured surface. Grattage refers to the removal of paint after it has been applied."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiart.org/en/valentine-hugo", "page_content": "Valentine Hugo (1887\u20131968) was a French artist and writer. She was born Valentine Marie Augustine Gross, only daughter to Auguste Gross and Z\u00e9lie D\u00e9melin, in Boulogne-sur-Mer. She is best known for her work with the Russian ballet and with the French Surrealists. Hugo died in Paris.\n\n\n\n\n\nA lover of the theater and music, Hugo's father raised her to share his interests until his death in 1903, which was undetermined as suicide or an accident. After her husband's death, Z\u00e9lie raised her daughter alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nValentine Hugo received schooling in Boulogne-sur-Mer, where she received multiple awards for accomplishments in drawing, until 1907, at which time she entered the L'\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. There she worked in the studio at the Acad\u00e9mie Humbert and exhibited in the Salon of French artists in 1909, and again in 1911. In 1908, Valentine Hugo met the artist Edmond Aman-Jean, who painted her portrait in 1909 and encouraged Hugo's artistic pursuits.\n\n\n\n\n\nHugo's work with the Ballets Russes established her connection with Jean Cocteau, who would introduce her to several important figures in her life, including her future husband French artist Jean Hugo (1894\u20131984), great-grandson of Victor Hugo. She would collaborate with him on ballet designs including Les mari\u00e9s de la tour Eiffel (1921), and in 1926 she executed 24 wood engravings after maquettes by Jean Hugo for Jean Cocteau's production of Rom\u00e9o et Juliette. Her involvement with the ballets provided Hugo many opportunities to progress her artwork. She often drew sketches of the ballets' choreography, and had a particular fascination with dancer and choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky. In 1913 she exhibited her paintings at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-Elys\u00e9es during the premiere of The Rite of Spring.\n\n\n\n\n\nHugo and Cocteau collaborated to create the ballet Parade, which premiered on 18 May 1917. Hugo worked on several other of Satie's ballets, including Le Pi\u00e8ge de M\u00e9duse, Socrate, and Mercure.\n\n\n\n\n\nHugo hosted salons with many artists, writers, and musicians in Paris, including avant-garde leaders such as Pablo Picasso, Andr\u00e9 Breton, and Paul \u00c9luard. She would often sketch her visitors, foreshadowing her portraiture work of the Surrealist leaders later on.\n\n\n\n\n\nHugo met Breton in 1917, before the start of Surrealism, at one of Cocteau's readings. Her friendships with Breton and Eluard would keep her connected to the Surrealists as the movement developed, and help her to form connections with other members, such as Salvador Dal\u00ed and Max Ernst. The three often traveled together, along with other members of the movement, in 1931 and 1932. As the only member of the group who owned a vehicle, Hugo would drive her companions to their destinations.\n\n\n\n\n\nValentine and Jean began living apart in 1926, and eventually divorced in 1932. Her separation from her husband allowed Hugo greater freedom to be involved with the Surrealist group. She moved into the same building as Eluard and Breton in May 1932.\n\n\n\n\n\nHugo joined the Bureau of Surrealist Research and created the Objet \u00e0 fonctionnement symbolique (1931), which was shown during the Exposition surr\u00e9alistic in 1933. She took part in other exhibitions throughout her time with the group, including an exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in 1936.\n\n\n\nThis is a part of the Wikipedia article used under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA).

In The Policeman, Mir\u00f3 derives a childlike image of a mustachioed policeman and his horse from seemingly unplanned stains on the canvas and graffiti-like strokes and squiggles, as if composing without conscious intention.\n\nThe Policeman (How to Make a Surrealist Artwork) Your browser does not support the audio tag. Caitlin: The title \u201cThe Policeman\u201d clues you in that we\u2019re looking for things that are figural and we\u2019ve got the gentlemen with the mustache. Just a really humorously long mustache and two eyes. And then we\u2019ve got in profile a really lovely horse. Jennifer: It really does present a challenge a sort of challenge to authority this idea of a humourous rendering of an absurd looking policeman, his red hand with five fingers coming up as if to say \u201cStop!\u201d Narrator: Surrealists like Joan Miro, sought to discover new and distinctive methods of artistic creation that often involved access to the unconscious. Curator Cailtin Haskell. Caitlin: Pure psychic automatism. I mean that\u2019s the phrase that Breton uses in the Surrealist Manifesto that is what each of these artists is trying to achieve. Narrator: Automatism a type of automatic creation took many forms in Surrealism. You could have automatic writing that created poems built from fragments or collage composed of seemingly random imagery. Caitlin: Or you could have automatic drawing where the artist is not working in the typical authorial way\u2014it\u2019s really the hand doing what it wants to do\u2014and then later on you can go in and lift out certain iconographic elements or make something that seems more pictorial. Narrator: This was a method frequently used by Joan Miro. Research Associate, Jennifer Cohen. Jennifer: So Miro would produce automatic drawings in a journal and he would produce them in various ways, letting his pen wander or characterizing images from his dreams. Narrator: This painting, The Policeman, and other paintings from this period may seem to be done on the fly, but it\u2019s far more meticulous than that. Jennifer: They are in fact in a very traditional way enlarged and reproduced from his sketchbook onto canvas. So you can kind of see in this work the grid that he would have used to create that reproduction. Narrator: Miro, perhaps more than any Surrealist artist, aggressively pushed the limits of painting. Jennifer: He\u2019s famously known as saying that his aim was to kill or assassinate painting, which is a very odd thing to hear him say because he\u2019s painting for his whole career. Narrator: Miro attributes he desire to transcend painting in part to poets, which he discusses in an interview from the 1960s.

Beginning in 1925, he developed numerous new methods for making pictures including frottage, which involved placing paper or canvas on a textured surface and rubbing evenly to create an unpredictable image. In Forest and Sun, the abstract patterns produced by wood grain have been transformed into a cluster of towering forms recalling a forest, a source of fear and fascination for Ernst since his youth.\n\nForest and Sun (How to Make a Surrealist Artwork) Your browser does not support the audio tag. Narrator: An important part of being a Surrealist was discovering new methods for creating artworks. One way the Surrealists did that was by experimenting with placing the creation of the artwork outside the control of the artist. Curator, Caitlin Haskell. Caitlin: And Ernst in particular had some really wonderful ways of making textures, making marks that are totally new and don\u2019t allow him to be completely in control of what\u2019s going to arrive on the surface. Narrator: We can see two such techniques here. One known as frottage, which involved placing paper or canvas on a textured surface, like wood, and drawing over the top of that surface to create shapes and lines. And grattage, technique where you scrape away applied oil paint, creating unexpected patterns. These methods of creation would come to be known as automatism and would be foundational in the creation of many Surrealist artworks. Research Associate, Jennifer Cohen. Jennifer: It originated in poetry, where you would write without stopping. And what they were looking for was something more authentic about themselves. It was a very Freudian exercise where I\u2019m looking for a secret that my conscious mind doesn\u2019t know about itself. Narrator: By accessing the unconscious during the creative process a painting could become a mirror to one\u2019s inner life. Notice for instance the forest. Jennifer: It gets to the heart of who he is. You can see that the petrified forest comes to look like an \u2018M\u2019 and from a distance you can really get a sense that it\u2019s really supposed to be the artist\u2019s signature. Narrator: As in his first name, Max. Ernst, like many Surrealists, wanted to move away from rational thought because they believed this way of thinking had lead society astray. Caitlin: Ernst was someone who had fought in World War I. And you\u2019re at one of these moments you get in the 20th century where there\u2019s a sense that all of the rational might that Europe had, all the forces of civilization had led to something quite tragic and horrific. Narrator: In using automatism, Surrealists believed we could uncover and present something profound about ourselves that rationalism had failed to produce.

The painting presents a view of the world as if seen through multiple film exposure, with at least four faces superimposed over a Mediterranean landscape. The background and foreground appear to merge, with mountain ridgelines functioning as facial contours and seawater doubling as discolored skin. Throughout his career Picabia remained skeptical of stylistic designations, and in 1924 he memorably quipped, \u201cThe only movement is perpetual movement.\u201d\n\nInspired by the biomorphic forms of his colleagues Jean Arp, Max Ernst, and Joan Mir\u00f3, Yves Tanguy developed his own vocabulary of organic, amoebic shapes populating mysterious, dreamlike settings. This painted wooden screen depicts an uncanny vision of a primordial landscape, which can be manipulated when the screen is folded to provide closure within a room or interior space.\n\nWith his wood reliefs made of curvilinear, organic shapes, Jean Arp invented a new stylistic language of \u201cbiomorphic\u201d abstraction that carried titles evoking things in the world. This work, a particularly playful example from this series, is entitled Manicured Relief, suggesting that the gray-green fields might represent painted fingernails. The artwork\u2019s first owner, Mary Reynolds, was a central figure in the Surrealist milieu in Paris and an artist known for her pioneering work in avant-garde bookbinding.\n\nClaude Cahun challenged traditional ideas about gender and sexuality through intimate photographic self-portraits, collages, and sculptures. For Object, Cahun altered a number of seemingly unrelated components\u2014a doll\u2019s hand, a cloud-shaped piece of wood, and a tennis ball painted with a wide-open eye\u2014to produce a startling image. This is the artist\u2019s only sculptural work known to exist in its original form.\n\nObject (How to Make a Surrealist Artwork) Your browser does not support the audio tag. Caitlin: It\u2019s startling for any number of reasons. It\u2019s kind of primal and it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s sort of repulsive. Narrator: Curator, Caitlin Haskell. Caitlin: You\u2019ve got this eye that\u2019s turned verticle, you have a hand, and then you have a base where there\u2019s a text. Narrator: We\u2019ll come back to each of these elements in a second. First, it\u2019s helpful to know that for the artist of this piece, Claude Cahun, contradiction was a frequent interest. Cahun often explored gender expression, playing with social norms of what is masculine and feminine. Caitlin: if you\u2019ve ever seen pictures of Claude, you know, she was a rather petite woman and would kind of be making this gestures like she was a body builder and you know doing very humorously masculine activities. But was also very serious about wanting to escape the social Narrator: In this sculpture, Cahun isn\u2019t confusing gender so much as our senses and desires. Research Associate, Brian Leahy. Brian: And I think the conflation of the eye turned vertical and then the hair confuses the sense of sight and touch. You both want to and don\u2019t want to touch the object. And the hand of course is the other element in the object that is insisting on this other sense. Narrator: The text on the base of the sculpture also fits with this theme of contradiction, though in a more overtly political way. Research Associate, Jennifer Cohen. Jennifer: It consists of two phrases which come from different sources. So the first says \u201cThe Marseillaise is a revolutionary song.\u201d So the first comes from the leader of the French communist party, who in 1935 gave an important speech sort of appropriating the idea of the Marseillaise or the French national anthem as a revolutionary song and not just a nationalist anthem. Narrator: The second phrase comes from Belgian currency and stated a punishment of hard labor for counterfeiting bills. Jennifer: I think that Cahun was very interested in the way that these two phrases came together to produce something poetic. But also the way in which they sort of contradict each other. In the same way that she was interested in deconstructing her own identity and the idea of gender. She was also interested in deconstructing political identities, so the ideas of left and right as well. Narrator: Undermining conventions, expectations, and bringing together numerous contradictions was a useful strategy for making Surrealist artwork, and perhaps no artist does this as evocatively as Claude Cahun.

In Time Transfixed, he transforms a stovepipe into a charging locomotive, situating the train in a fireplace vent so that it appears to be emerging from a railway tunnel. The surprising juxtaposition and incongruous scale of unrelated elements in Time Transfixed brings a sense of mystery to the everyday.\n\nTime Transfixed (How to Make a Surrealist Artwork) Your browser does not support the audio tag. Narrator: When art collector Edward James was choosing where to hang Time Transfixed in his home, the artist, Rene Magritte, provided a suggestion. Curator, Caitlin Haskell. Caitlin: He wanted it to be at the bottom of a staircase so that when viewers were descending it would seem like they were being stabbed by this train coming through the fireplace at them. Narrator: This may seem confusing at first, why would Magritte want you to have this violent experience of the painting? We get a bit of a clue from the original French title of the painting, which is actually quite different from the English title listed here. Caitlin: So in English the title for this work is Time Transfixed, but in French it would be (french phrase), meaning basically time getting stabbed, punctuated in a very violent way. Narrator: This painting is full of these twists of language and metaphor, and is a good example of an approach to painting that Magritte used that he termed Problematology. But he didn\u2019t mean problems in the way that we typically talk about them. Caitlin: He\u2019s trying to evoke a particular idea in his viewer\u2019s mind. So for example in this case you got a fire place and a train, which do not seem connected at all, they are disconnected in terms of their scale: One is domestic, one is industrial, one is moving, one is fixed, but what they share is smoke. And that is what allows this scene to be uncanny as opposed to just absurd. Narrator: Though not every Surrealist used the method of Problematology, evoking a specific idea through unexpected images or metaphors is common throughout Surrealism. It comes back to a foundational concept for many Surrealists that there is truth accessible beyond rational thought that can be brought out of the unconscious through art. OUT Narrator: Magritte is without a doubt one of the great Surrealists, but he was also unique within the movement. In contrast iconic image of the Bohemien, outlandish drug and alcohol crazed French surrealists, Magritte was actually fairly conservative. Caitlin: He would paint wearing a suit, at very regular hours of the day, in his home. And I think he sort of enjoyed the dissonance between being an avant-garde artists and looking like you\u2019re the man in the crowd, not doing anything exceptional.

Poetic assemblages of found objects and materials, these deeply personal and elusive boxes often prompt a dizzying array of associations. Despite the rigid and symmetrical organization of Untitled (Butterfly Habitat), each small compartment holds a paper butterfly suspended with string, allowing for some movement as the work is handled.\n\nRoberto Matta\u2019s best-known painting The Earth Is a Man is a type of imaginative landscape that he referred to as an \u201cinscape.\u201d It represents the culmination of a five-year project in honor of the poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, who was assassinated by agents of Francisco Franco in 1936. Exhibited shortly after its completion in New York City, where Matta had immigrated at the onset of World War II, the mural-size canvas enthralled and influenced a new generation of American artists, who would come to be known as the Abstract Expressionists.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Kurt Seligmann became the first Surrealist to arrive in New York and was instrumental in the emigration of most of the movement\u2019s leading figures to the United States. As an acknowledged expert on magic, he infused his paintings with mythology and esotericism, and in the same year he made this work he published The Mirror of Magic, a history of the occult. The winding forms and mystical quality of this canvas influenced a new generation of American artists, including his student Robert Motherwell.\n\nMarcel Duchamp began his career as a conventional painter, but by 1912 he set out to prove the end of \u201cretinal\u201d art, his term for works created to delight the eye. In its place, he proposed the \u201creadymade,\u201d an ordinary object transformed into a work of art by virtue of the artist\u2019s selection. Duchamp\u2019s Bottle Rack, first realized in 1914 using a mass-produced bottle rack purchased at a French department store, is the earliest work of this type. Duchamp transformed many other common objects into readymades, including a hat rack, a bicycle wheel, and even a urinal, and his counterintuitive invention provided an important precedent for later Surrealist artists.\n\nLearn more about Duchamp\u2019s Bottle Rack on the museum\u2019s blog.\n\nBottle Rack (Porte-Bouteilles) (How to Make a Surrealist Artwork) Your browser does not support the audio tag. This is an interview with Dada artist Marcel Duchamp on the BBC in 1968. Narrator: Where should we begin with this confounding artwork? Maybe the easiest place is explaining what is literally is. Curator, Caitlin Haskell. Catlin: This is actually a functional object. In France people would drink wine and those bottles could be reused. And so after you finished your wine you\u2019d rinse it out and the bottle would need to dry so you would put on one of these spikes. Narrator: Duchamp called these sculptures \u201cReadymades.\u201d In the example we\u2019re looking at, the bottle rack is presented as it was originally manufactured. Caitlin: His hand is not involved in the making of this in the least, but he selected it and he had the idea to put it in the context of an art gallery. And it starts to provoke lots and lots of questions about, well, what is an artwork? Or you sort of find yourself asking \u2018why couldn\u2019t this be an artwork?\u2019 Narrator: What complicates this question even more is that this bottle rack at the Art Institute isn\u2019t the first bottle rack. See, Duchamp was in New York when he fully conceived of the idea of the Readymade, but the bottle rack he has purchased in 1914 was still in his studio in France, which he left in the care of his sister Suzanne, whose work is also discussed on this tour. Research Associate, Jennifer Cohen. Jennifer: And he wrote to his sister about this \u201cso called bottle rack\u201d as he put it and he said that now he was going to call it a Readymade and he said \u201ctake the bottle rack for yourself, I will make it a Readymade remotely you are to inscribe it at the bottom and on the inside bottom ring in small letters painted with a brush in oil, silver/white color with an inscription. He\u2019s trying to distance the act of artistic intentionality to such a degree that he\u2019s having his sister sign the work for him. Narrator: Unfortunately for Marcel, his sister received the letter too late and had already thrown out the bottle rack, assuming it was junk cluttering up the studio. Not one to be discouraged, Duchamp would go on purchase and exhibit multiple bottle racks. This particular bottle rack was ultimately purchased by artist Robert Rauchunberg and signed by Duchamp, which you can see on the inside of the bottom ring. Duchamp\u2019s questioning of originality, artist intention, and what makes something artwork would become central for the Surrealist movement and shaped what it would mean to create a Surrealist artwork.

A translation of these phrases reads: \u201cThe mirror would shatter, the scaffolding would totter, the balloons would fly away, the stars would dim, etc.\u201d Such images and words seemed fitting for artists like Suzanne Duchamp who embraced Dada, an anti-art movement that developed in response to World War I and set the stage for the emergence of Surrealism.\n\nBroken and Restored Multiplication (How to Make a Surrealist Artwork) Your browser does not support the audio tag. Caitlin: This is a painting that I\u2019m just really excited about. It\u2019s by Suzanne Duchamp and it is one of the classic and one of the most important Dada paintings. The painting actually functions at the same time as an abstract artwork and as a concrete poem. It\u2019s talking about the stars are going to fall, the balloons are going to fly away, the mirror is going to break\u2014and so you\u2019ve got this sense of order that\u2019s been upended and sort of rupture and breakage. Narrator: This theme is continued through the visuals of the painting as well. Notice this architectural shape at the center the painting. You probably recognize it, though it\u2019s shown here upside down. It\u2019s the Eiffel Tower. Curator, Caitlin Haskell. Caitlin: For me it\u2019s really productive to think about what the Eiffel Tower symbolized when it was constructed. There was a very idealistic understanding that it would represent this union of art and engineering and science, and that if the artists and the engineers could speak in one language what a perfect modern world we would have. Narrator: When Duchamp made this work 30 years later that idealism had fallen apart. Europe was is in the wake of World War I, during which they witnessed previously unfathomable levels of destruction due to advances in technological warfare. Research associate, Jennifer Cohen. Jennifer: There\u2019s sort of no overestimating that destruction and how it was felt for the French. So many men died, and that was felt by everyone. Narrator: In reaction to this destruction, Dada artists like Duchamp had become skeptical of Western thought and its worship of reason and technological advancement. For them, our strict adherence to this form of thinking had lead us to the brink of extermination. Caitlin: That technology is something that can be used to extremely horrific ends and that there probably isn\u2019t going to be a reintegration of art and science. Jennifer: Logic can only get us so far. So what can breaking apart language, breaking apart ideas, what kinds of opportunities might be there to mine. Narrator: Duchamp\u2019s critique of Western civilization and her combining of poetry and painting anticipate similar experimental artworks by Surrealist artists that questioned authority.

Painted near Vienna a few months before the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany, Inventions of the Monsters is filled with threats of danger, from the menacing fire in the distance to the foreboding hourglass in the foreground. The artist, whose native Catalonia was embroiled in the Spanish Civil War during the creation of this work, depicts anxieties about a world that had indeed allowed for the invention of monsters.\n\nSalvador Dal\u00ed created this anthropomorphic cabinet from a half-size plaster reproduction of a famous marble statue of the ancient goddess of love, the Venus de Milo. As Dal\u00ed described, objects such as this should be created \u201cwholly for the purpose of materializing in a fetishistic way, with maximum tangible reality, ideas and fantasies of a delirious character.\u201d\n\n\n\nVenus de Milo with Drawers (How to Make a Surrealist Artwork) Your browser does not support the audio tag. Narrator: The origin story of this sculpture begins when Dali purchased a reproduction of the famous Venus di Milo. Curator, Caitlin Haskell. Caitlin: So it\u2019s basically like a souvenir. Narrator: Much like the artist Marcel Duchamp, who actually aided with the creation of this work, Salvador Dali alters this found object, turning a tchotchke into a work of art. Jennifer: He drew out this drawers on the sculpture and then his friend Marcel Duchamp assisted him in hiring a cabinet maker in turning these into actual functioning drawers. Caitlin Haskell: We had an amazing day with this artwork. We took it out of its vitrine and we actually removed the different drawers. Each of these pulls that you see on venus is an actual functional drawer. What\u2019s interesting is that Dali has gone in and covered each of them with this fur that is mink or ermine. I don\u2019t know, I just had a totally different psychological relationship with this because you\u2019re going through the fur to find the drawer pull and it\u2019s like oddly akin to like uncovering a nipple on a dog\u2019s belly or something like that. And it\u2019s a really sort of\u2026I don\u2019t know it\u2019s not the type of experience you expect to have with an artwork. Jennifer: And it has a lot to do, I think, with his reading of Freud and the idea that if only we could open up our bodies or minds like we can open a cabinet we could discover secrets.

Photo courtesy MoMA\n\n\u201cSurrealism is based on the belief in the omnipotence of dreams, in the undirected play of thought.\u201d \u2013 Andr\u00e9 Breton\n\nSurrealism definition: what is Surrealism?\n\nDal\u00ed\u2019s melting clock, Magritte\u2019s figures composed from clouds, Frida Kahlo\u2019s self-portrait as a hunted stag\u2026 These are just a few of the familiar images that come to mind when we speak of Surrealism. The art movement, which blossomed in the 1920s with Andr\u00e9 Breton at the helm, rejected the society\u2019s oppressive rationality. Instead, the movement\u2019s followers explored the irrational and the subconscious mind, which they deemed superior to oppressive rationality. Breton was also influenced by the psychoanalytical writings of Sigmund Freud, who posited that the unconscious mind (which expressed itself, for example, through dreams) was the source of creativity. Surrealist artists deployed automatic drawing or writing to unlock ideas from their subconscious, often depicting elements from their dreamscapes.\n\nKey dates: 1924 \u2013 1966\n\nKey regions: Paris, New York\n\nKey words: surrealist, subconscious, irrational, automatism, dreams\n\nKey artists: Andr\u00e9 Breton, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Andr\u00e9 Masson, Rene Magritte, Joan Mir\u00f3, Yves Tanguy, Max Ernst, Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, Meret Oppenheim, Jean Arp, Man Ray, Wifredo Lam\n\nMan Ray, A l\u2019Heure de l\u2019Observatoire: les Amoureux, 1932-1934.

In 1915, the young Andr\u00e9 Breton was already well versed in literature, contemporary art, anarchism and medicine. The First World War was raging in Europe and he was assigned as a nurse in a Nantes military hospital. The horrors of the war made a deep impression on Breton and he wrote his first poems there. He also met two men who were to become his mentors \u2013 Guillaume Apollinaire and Jacques Vache. Both had been admitted to the hospital due to war wounds. Apollinaire was a French avant-garde poet who had coined the word \u201csurrealist\u201d in his play, which was performed in 1917. However, it was Andr\u00e9 Breton who really defined surrealism as an artistic movement in his 1924 Surrealist Manifesto. To him, Surrealism was \u201cpsychic automatism in its pure state, by which one proposes to express, either verbally, in writing, or by any other manner, the real functioning of thought, in the absence of any control exercised by reason, exempt from any aesthetic or moral concern.\u201d\n\nBased on his renewed convictions, Breton opened a designated gallery in Paris, the Galerie Surr\u00e9aliste, and also decided to set up a series of collective exhibitions starting with the first one at Pierre Loeb\u2019s gallery in 1925. It featured pieces by both Surrealist members and other, somewhat related, artists such as Paul Klee, Pablo Picasso, Man Ray, and Marcel Duchamp, considered to be kindred to surrealist artistic aspirations because of the imaginative and provocative qualities of their work. Other shows followed as Surrealism\u2019s fame and influence grew internationally.\n\nKey ideas behind Surrealism\n\nAlthough early Surrealist poets were hesitant about engaging in art production as, in their view, the mechanical act of creating art \u2013 whether it was drawing, painting, or sculpting \u2013 impeded the spontaneous expression of the unconscious, around the mid-1920s the prime theorist of Surrealism Andr\u00e9 Breton, in his seminal Surrealism and Painting, reconsidered the potential of visual arts as a means to unlock the power of the psyche and create absurd imagery, partly humorous and partly ominous: a manifestation of contradictions in everyday life. Few other artistic movements were as cross-sectorial and inclusive as Surrealism. Not defined by any specific medium or style, it spanned all those disciplines capable of manifesting the uncanny side of reality, ranging from Visual Arts to Music, Theatre, and Cinema. It entailed a philosophical approach instead, as \u2013 in artist Joyce Mansour\u2019s words \u2013 \u201cIt is not the technique of painting that is surrealist, it\u2019s the painter and the painter\u2019s vision of life\u201d.\n\nFamous Surrealist Artworks\n\nSalvador Dal\u00ed\u2019s The Persistence of Memory (1931)\n\nArguably Dal\u00ed\u2019s most famous artwork, The Persistence of Memory portrays clocks, otherwise hard objects, becoming inexplicably limp and bendable. Here, time literally bends, and the creature draped across the centre of the canvas seems to be simultaneously melting, sleeping and dying. Dal\u00ed\u2019s \u201chand-painted dream photographs\u201d present his absurd visions and dreams in an unbelievably tangible and realistic manner.\n\nRene Magritte\u2019s The Treachery of Images (1928)\n\nMagritte\u2019s realistic painting of a simple wooden pipe has become one of the most iconic paintings of the Surrealist movement. Beneath the pipe is the inscription \u201cCeci n\u2019est pas un pipe\u201d (\u2018This is not a pipe\u2019). Magritte was inspired by metaphysical philosophy, offering the viewer a paradox. What can be seen is a pipe, but his words contradict this immediate understanding of the painting. If it is not a pipe, then what is it? Magritte inspires the viewer to think about the relationship between language and everyday objects, as well as art versus reality.\n\nRen\u00e9 Magritte, The Treachery of Images, 1928. Photo courtesy LACMA\n\nJoan Mir\u00f3\u2019s The Hunter (Catalan Landscape) (1924)\n\nMir\u00f3\u2019s The Hunter depicts a surrealist landscape inspired by Catalonia, where his family was from. The landscape is saturated with strange triangular shapes, orbs, and disembodied human and animal forms. In fact, the only truly recognisable organisms in the painting are the birds. The forms and figures hover, float, and seem to be in constant motion. In the foreground, the word \u201csard\u201d is written, short for \u201cSardana\u201d, Catalonia\u2019s national dance. The shortened word was inspired by the fragmented words of Dadaist and Surrealist poetry.\n\nFrida Kahlo\u2019s The Wounded Deer (1946)\n\nThis iconic painting depicts Frida Kahlo as a wounded deer, punctured by multiple arrows. She painted the painting after an unsuccessful spinal surgery in New York in 1946. By presenting this self-portrait of herself as a hunted half-stag, half-human, she shares her suffering with the viewer. Her choice to represent herself as a stag, a male deer, might refer to her bisexuality.\n\nFrida Kahlo, The Wounded Deer. Photo courtesy The Art Story\n\nMeret Oppenheim\u2019s Object (1936)\n\nMeret Oppenheim\u2019s Object, a fur-covered cup and saucer, was inspired by a conversation with Pablo Picasso and Dora Maar. Picasso was admiring Oppenheim\u2019s fur-covered bracelet and remarked that one could cover anything with fur. Oppenheim then replied: \u201cEven this cup and saucer.\u201d When Andr\u00e9 Breton asked her to participate in the first Surrealist exhibition of objects, she bought a cup, saucer and spoon and covered them in the fur of a Chinese gazelle. Thus, Oppenheim transformed the delicate, dainty objects into something sensual and sexual.\n\nMan Ray\u2019s l\u2019Heure de l\u2019Observatoire: les Amoureux (1932-1934)\n\nMan Ray\u2019s famous painting depicts the sensual red lips of Lee Miller, his former lover and prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Ray painted it after their relationship ended in 1932. The giant lips float in the sky and also represent the two bodies of Man Ray and Lee Miller.\n\nSurrealism in Europe and America\n\nSurrealism was born in Paris, France, and this remained the main hub for the movement throughout the \u201820s and \u201830s. The main artists associated with the movement in Europe were Andr\u00e9 Breton, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Andr\u00e9 Masson, Rene Magritte, Joan Mir\u00f3, Yves Tanguy, Max Ernst, Meret Oppenheim, Jean Arp, Man Ray and Wifredo Lam. Initially, Andr\u00e9 Breton formed a connection to the Dada movement through correspondence with Tristan Tzara. However, the two severed ties due to various differences and Breton then founded Surrealism in 1924 with his Surrealist Manifesto. During World War II, many Surrealist artists (including Andr\u00e9 Breton and Max Ernst) fled Europe. Many ended up in the United States, where they influenced a whole host of American artists. The chance elements central to surrealist art contributed to the development of a new type of art in America. In particular, the Abstract Expressionists, with their anti-war, spontaneous, unscripted art, owes a great deal to the Surrealists.\n\nWifredo Lam, Rumblings of the Earth, 1950. Photo courtesy Guggenheim\n\nSurrealism in Central and Latin America\n\nAlthough the great Mexican artists Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera were never officially part of the Surrealist movement, they are often associated with Surrealism. Kahlo said: \u201cThey thought I was a Surrealist, but I wasn\u2019t. I never painted dreams. I painted my own reality.\u201d Still, Andr\u00e9 Breton visited Kahlo and Rivera in Mexico. He also organised the Fourth International Surrealist Exhibition in Mexico City, which included works by the two artists. Though not officially tied to the movement, they certainly worked with many Surrealist topics, like the subconscious, dreams, and symbolism. The Cuban-born artist Wifredo Lam (who was of mixed Afro-Chinese-Cuban descent), was another important artist in the Surrealist movement. Lam studied in Madrid and Paris, where he became close friends with Picasso and was introduced to Surrealism. Lam\u2019s paintings reflected on social injustices and spirituality.\n\nSurrealism in Film and Literature\n\nSurrealism was not just limited to the visual arts. On the contrary, since Breton started out as a poet, Surrealism naturally became influential in literary circles. Important proponents of Surrealist literature were Andr\u00e9 Breton, Paul Eluard, Robert Desnos, Georges Bataille, Philip Soupalt, Louis Aragon and Antonin Artaud. In cinema, Luis Bu\u00f1uel made waves with his Surrealist films like Un Chien Andalou (1929, made with Salvador Dal\u00ed). The Surrealists in cinema used new techniques and approaches to free the art of cinema from traditional storytelling. Instead, they wanted to transform the medium into one that could explore and reveal the inner workings of the subconscious.\n\nThe Influence of Surrealism\n\nSurrealism had a profound influence on Abstract Expressionism, and on the unscripted Happenings in the 1950s promoted by Allan Kaprow. The Situationist International in the 1960s is also indebted to Surrealist ideas and methods. Surrealism is considered to have ended with the death of Andr\u00e9 Breton in 1966. However, the movement continues to inspire countless contemporary artists today. Artists like David Lynch, Julie Curtiss and Mary Reid Kelley, to name but a few, work with a great deal of Surrealist imagery and techniques.\n\nRene Magritte, La Decalcomanie, 1966.
