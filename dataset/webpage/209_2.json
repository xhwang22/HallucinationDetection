The designation encompasses the building\u2019s exterior and parcel; it does not include the building\u2019s interior.\n\nHeritage Value\n\nThe heritage value of the Blake House lies in its association with the Blake family, its Georgian influenced architecture, its association with Lieutenant Governor Donald Alexander MacKinnon (1863-1928) and its role in supporting the King Street streetscape.\n\n\n\nThe Blake House has had an interesting history. Like many others in the area, local butcher, Patrick Blake was burned out in the Fire of 1866. The family quickly rebuilt using brick. Tragically, during the construction of the home, labourer, Walter Gaul, fell from the site and died shortly after.\n\n\n\nThe style chosen shows strong Georgian influences with a symmetrical front facade of five bays on the upper two floors with a central doorway on the ground floor. This example is also unique because it has a flat roof. The Georgian style emerged from 18th Century Britain and was intent on expressing confidence, order, and balance. Combined with the solid brick construction of this building, the result was intended to impress. It remains a good example of the style in the City.\n\n\n\nA later resident of the Blake House was Lieutenant Governor Donald Alexander MacKinnon. A 1905 article noted that the newly appointed Lieutenant Governor would be moving from the Blake House to Government House, the Lieutenant Governor\u2019s mansion, after his vacation.\n\n\n\nMacKinnon was a teacher, politician and historian. Early in his career, he had been a public school teacher, however he would go on to practice Law. He was called to the bar in 1887 and granted King's Counsel in 1901. MacKinnon joined Hon. A.B. Warburton in a law partnership in approximately 1897. The two practised from their office in the Cameron Block on Victoria Row. Interestingly, in 1906, the pair wrote a history of Prince Edward Island called, \u201cPrince Edward Island - Past and Present\u201d The book is still a valuable resource for students of PEI history today.\n\n\n\nActive politically, MacKinnon was elected to the Provincial Legislature in 1893 and 1897. He later turned to Federal politics and went on to be elected to the House of Commons in 1900, 1901 and 1921. In between his Provincial and Federal political experiences, MacKinnon was appointed to the post of Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island. He served from 3 October 1904 until 30 May 1910.\n\n\n\nThe Blake House is no longer a private residence but now serves as an apartment building. Located between two wood framed homes, the large, brick Blake House is a prominent addition to the King Street streetscape.\n\n\n\nSources: Heritage Office, City of Charlottetown Planning Department, PO Box 98, Charlottetown, PE C1A 7K2\n\n#1286\n\nCharacter-Defining Elements\n\nThe following character-defining elements illustrate the Georgian influenced heritage value of 100 King Street:\n\n\n\n- The overall massing of the building\n\n- The size and shape of the brick exterior\n\n- The symmetrical placement and style of the windows including, the tall, six over six windows of the front facade with freestone lintels and sills, as well as the bay window of the eastern side of the building\n\n- The placement and style of the centrally placed recessed door, with its transom light and side light\n\n- The bay projection on the east side of the building with its freestone and brick details\n\n- The flat roof with its dentil detailing\n\n- The style and placement of the chimney\n\n- The location as part of the King Street streetscape"}, {"url": "http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/mackinnon_donald_alexander_15E.html", "page_content": "MacKINNON, DONALD ALEXANDER, teacher, lawyer, politician, and author; b. 22 Feb. 1863 in Uigg, P.E.I., son of William MacKinnon and Catherine Nicholson; m. 17 Oct. 1892, in Charlottetown, Adelaide Beatrice Louise Owen (d. 1912) of Georgetown, P.E.I., and they had two sons and one daughter; d. 20 April 1928 in Charlottetown.\n\nDonald A. MacKinnon was of Scots stock: his father had been born in Scotland and his mother was a descendant of settlers who had come to Prince Edward Island in 1803 with the Earl of Selkirk [Douglas*]. Donald attended the Uigg grammar school and, on completing his education there, taught in rural districts, beginning at the age of 14 if not earlier. By 1880 he had enrolled at Prince of Wales College in Charlottetown. After his graduation he received a first-class teaching licence and worked in several locations until 1882 when he began articles with Charlottetown barrister Malcolm McLeod. Taking advantage of changes to legislation which allowed time spent at approved law schools to count as part of the articling period, he attended Dalhousie law school in Halifax from 1885 to 1887 and received an llb. He was called to the Island bar as an attorney in 1887 and as a barrister the following year.\n\nMacKinnon opened a legal practice in Georgetown in 1887 and remained there until 1897, when he moved back to Charlottetown and began a partnership with Alexander Bannerman Warburton. The firm, which had offices in Summerside and Montague Bridge (Montague) as well, was short-lived because Warburton was called to the bench in 1898. Later law partners were Edward Bayfield Williams and Robert Neil McNeill. Named a qc in 1899, MacKinnon became president of the Law Society of Prince Edward Island the following year. He was also law agent for the dominion minister of justice in the province.\n\nMacKinnon\u2019s political career had begun in 1893 when he was elected as a Liberal for 4th Kings in the newly constituted Legislative Assembly [see Neil McLeod*]. Re-elected in 1897, he was named attorney general in the government of Donald Farquharson* in 1899, but when he returned to the electorate that year as a consequence of taking office he was, unusually, opposed and defeated. In 1900 he entered dominion politics and ran in Queens East. Although he received the majority of the votes, the result was declared void for \u201ccorrupt practices\u201d and a new election ordered which took place in March 1901 and which MacKinnon won by a larger majority. He sat until the dissolution but was not a candidate in the 1904 election. In June of that year he had complained to Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier* that his finances were not sufficient for politics and had indicated his desire to be made lieutenant governor of Prince Edward Island. In October 1904 the appointment came to him at the comparatively young age of 41. He held the position until May 1910. MacKinnon was again elected to the dominion parliament in 1921, representing Queens, and he sat until 1925. He did not contest the 1925 election.\n\nIn addition to his legal practice MacKinnon was involved in a number of business ventures, among them the Three Rivers Steamship Company and the Prince Edward Island Electric Company, of which he was president. His interests included the Boy Scouts, an organization he served as provincial commissioner, and writing. He was a contributor to the Prince Edward Island Magazine and in 1906, in partnership with Warburton, he edited Past and present of Prince Edward Island, an encyclopedic volume containing historical essays and biographical sketches. MacKinnon\u2019s contributions included articles on the fisheries, Queens County, geology, and the constitution. The volume continues to be useful for research. It was not, however, mentioned in obituaries, which concentrated on MacKinnon\u2019s political service, specifically mentioning his success in obtaining a branch line of the Prince Edward Island Railway that had benefited his district.\n\nH.

Donald Alexander MacKinnon, M.P. (1863-1928)\n\n\n\nThe Honorable Donald Alexander MacKinnon was born on 22 February 1863, in Uigg, Belfast, Prince Edward Island, to father William and mother Katherine (n\u00e9e Nicholson) MacKinnon.\n\n\n\nDonald first attended the Uigg Grammar School, where we would start teaching at the age of 14. He continued his education at Prince of Wales College, in Charlottetown and received a first class teaching license. In 1882, he became an articling student with Malcolm McLeod, a barrister in Charlottetown. Between 1885-1887, David attended Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia and graduated with a Bachelor of Law.\n\n\n\nIn 1887, Donald was called to the Bar as an attorney and then a barrister in 1888. Upon his return to PEI, Donald opened a legal practice in Georgetown, which he ran from 1887-1897, before moving back to Charlottetown.\n\n\n\nIn Donald\u2019s personal life, he married Adelaide Beatrice Louise Owen, from Georgetown, in 1892. They had one daughter and two sons, Beatrice and Arthur, but sadly their other son did not survive past his early childhood. The family was also part of the Presbyterian church.\n\n\n\nOnce back in Charlottetown, Donald partnered with Alexander Warburton, which only lasted a year, from 1897-1898, since Alexander was called to the bench. Donald then partnered with Edward Williams and Robert McNeill. In 1899, Donald was named Queen\u2019s Counsel and in 1900 became the president of the Law Society of Prince Edward Island.\n\n\n\nDonald became involved in politics when he was elected as a Liberal for the 4th Kings in 1893. In 1899, during the government of Donald Farquharson, he was named attorney general. He was not long in the position as he was defeated the next electoral year. In 1900, Donald ran in Queen's East, where he won the majority of votes but the result was declared void and a new election took place in March 1901, where Donald won by an even larger majority.\n\n\n\nIn October 1904, Donald was appointed as Prince Edward Island\u2019s lieutenant governor, he held this position until May 1910.

Candidates who have successfully completed and met all administrative and program requirements for the Licensing Process, in accordance with By-Law 4 of the Law Society, are eligible to be called to the Bar of Ontario. Candidates must successfully complete the Barrister Licensing Examination and the Solicitor Licensing Examination, fulfill the Experiential Training Component (e.g., Articling or the LPP), file all documents and fees required and be of good character to be called. For some candidates, however, including lawyers transferring from within Canada, and Ontario law deans and professors, completion of some mandatory requirements of the Licensing Process may not be required. These candidates should contact the Law Society for more information.\n\nIn the past, in-person call ceremonies have typically been held in June in Toronto, Ottawa and London. In 2020 the Law Society implemented a more frequent process of licensing lawyer candidates called the administrative call process in order to license candidates expeditiously and without requiring their attendance in person.\n\nAs candidates become eligible for call, Licensing and Accreditation will contact them through their online account to advise them of next steps to complete in order to be called. Candidates who are eligible for a ceremonial call are typically notified approximately one to two months prior to the ceremonial call (depending on the number of ceremonial participants) and provided with direction on the next steps (filing call documents, payment of call and other fees, outstanding documents, etc.). Once candidates submit all call requirements by the stated deadline provided, their file is reviewed by Licensing and Accreditation and placed in queue to be called."}]}
