King Richard, but I call him daddy.\u201d The man in question was Richard Williams, whose story was the subject of King Richard, the new biopic starring Will Smith. With the movie already generating Oscar buzz for Will, many might forget that the man he portrays is the real-life father of two of tennis\u2019 greatest players (and arguably, the greatest of all time in Serena.) For those unfamiliar, here\u2019s what you need to know about Richard Williams.\n\n1. Richard Williams Hails From Louisiana.\n\nRichard Dove Williams was born on Feb. 14, 1942, in Shreveport, Louisiana. \u201cIn Shreveport, my family and I lived in a three-room shack on East Seventy-Ninth Street, next to the railroad tracks. The house was so raggedy a strong wind could have blown it down,\u201d Richard wrote in an excerpt of his book, Black and White: The Way I See It, published by the New York Daily News in 2014. Richard\u2019s father left his mother, Julia, and her five children to survive on their own. \u201cWhen my father never gave anything to me, I decided I was going to give my family everything I had,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe more I worked, the more I helped Mama and my sisters, and the prouder of myself I became.\u201d After graduating from high school, he eventually found his way to California.\n\n2. He\u2019s Been Married Multiple Times.\n\nWhile out in California, Richard met Betty Johnson. Betty had one child from a prior relationship, and after she and Richard married in 1965, they had five children together, per Page Six. They divorced in 1973. Seven years later, he married Oracene Prince. She and Richard had two biological daughters together \u2013 Venus and Serena \u2013 before divorcing in 2002. In 2010, Richard married Lakeisha Juanita Graham, a woman 37 years younger than he was. They welcomed a son, Dylan, in 2012 and divorced in 2017, per Heavy.\n\n3. Richard Had No Background In Tennis\n\nAfter Richard saw Virginia Ruzici receive a $30,000 check on television after she won a tennis tournament, he decided that his next two kids would play the sport, according to Sports Illustrated. \u201cWhen we got started in tennis, it was to go out and make a lot of money. Believe me, we have made tons, and I\u2019ll make even more.\u201d\n\nHe bought books and tapes to learn everything about the sport, taught Oracene \u2013 a gifted athlete \u2013 how to play, and began to coach the three girls from his first marriage, according to a 2018 Serena profile in GQ. When Venus and Serena were 3 and 4, he started them playing at the public courts in Compton, California. Richard also drew up a 78-page training regime. As Venus and Serena developed, Richard moved the family to South Florida, where the daughters \u2013 Serena was 10, Venus was 11 \u2013 could train at Rick Macci\u2019s tennis academy. Richard eventually pulled the girls out of the school and did all the coaching himself at home. It was a successful risk, with Venus and Serena exploding on the scene, racking up wins left and right.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I was really in a bubble, to be honest,\u201d Serena told GQ. \u201cI had friends. And you know, my dad wouldn\u2019t let us be pro full-time until we finished high school.\u201d\n\n4. His Tennis Dreams Were Supported By His Wife\n\n\u201cMy dad at one point was working, and then, he stopped,\u201d Serena said in the Nov. 16 episode of Red Table Talk, per PEOPLE. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018This is what we\u2019re going to do. I\u2019m not going to have a job. I\u2019m gonna go with Venus and Serena and train them every day.\u2019 Now that would be impossible for me if my husband [Alexis Ohanian] were to tell me that.\u201d Serena credited her mother for supporting the family while Richard chased tennis\n\n5. Richard Was Ahead Of His Time, According To Serena\n\n\u201cMy dad was and still is way before his time,\u201d Serena Williams told GQ\u2019s Wesley Lowery for a profile on Will Smith. \u201cYou see, when someone is different\u2014when they don\u2019t act or look how a person assumed they would\u2014the first reaction is often fear. They think, How do we break them? My dad anticipated that, but he would not allow himself or his family to be broken.\u201d Serena also gave praise to Will Smith for the accuracy of his portrayal, telling Lowery that \u201cthere were moments she had to remind herself that it wasn\u2019t actually her father on the screen.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://happyhappybirthday.net/en/age/rich-williams-person_xxassxy", "page_content": "Rich Williams\n\nAmerican rock guitarist \u2013 Rich Williams was born in Topeka (capital of the state of Kansas, United States; county seat of Shawnee County) on February 1st, 1950 and is 73 years old today.\n\nAge How old is Rich Williams? 73 Rich Williams is 73 years old.\n\nBiographical data\n\nRich Williams\n\nBirthday When was Rich Williams born?

On May 15th, the Tower opened to the public - still without working elevators - but around 30,000 visitors still made the climb. The elevators went into operation on the 26th.

I don\u2019t want people to hate me,\u2019\u201d remembers Isha Price, Venus and Serena\u2019s older half sister\u2014a lawyer who, along with Venus and Serena, is credited as an executive producer on the movie.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Daddy, first of all, we would never be a part of anything where people were going to vilify you [just] because they didn\u2019t understand you. But we got to tell the truth.\u2019 He said, \u2018Oh, I always want you to be honest.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdmits King Richard producer Trevor White in a separate interview, \u201cI think there\u2019s a sensitivity to the way in which Richard used to be portrayed in the media, and the family wanted to make sure we weren\u2019t after that kind of false portrayal.\u201d\n\nPrice, the lynchpin between the film and her family, says she was convinced to participate after reading Zach Baylin\u2019s script and realizing that Baylin, Trevor, and fellow King Richard producer Tim White genuinely wanted the family\u2019s cooperation. As Price explained to her family members, \u201cThis is technically our story. But somebody is going to tell it eventually. Why not let us, at least, tell the truth and have our own voice out there and not have it be some fabricated thing about stuff that never happened, or things that people don\u2019t understand? That\u2019s where you get to the vilification of certain people.\u201d\n\nThough Richard stayed removed from the process, the rest of the family got involved. Serena and Venus submitted script feedback; their sister Lyndrea Price worked in the costume department; and Isha helped with everything from choosing the director, Reinaldo Marcus Green, to making sure minute details of her family life were accurately depicted. (\u201cI was mad that the van was dusty,\u201d laughs Isha about one nitpick. \u201cDaddy washed the van every week.\u201d) Isha, Venus, and Williams matriarch Oracene Price also spent considerable time speaking with the filmmakers to make sure that they understood the private side of Richard Williams.\n\n\u201cIn the \u201990s and the early 2000s, when he was much more forward-facing, Richard was a very controversial and contentious figure in the tennis world,\u201d says Baylin. \u201cHe really saw his job as their coach being not just about what was happening on the court, but about being their hype man. At the time, I think people saw that somewhat contentiously. But what was brilliant was he knew that without the resources [to fund Venus and Serena\u2019s tennis training], he was going to have to build up this aura and myth around them to get people to invest in them.\u2026 I think the outward impression was that that bombastic-ness and that contentiousness would\u2019ve been there in the family as well. But it was really the opposite. He was an extremely soft and encouraging father and coach.\u201d\n\nAdds Isha, \u201cThere were a lot of tennis parents out there that were more villainous. The reason that he took us out of\u2014or took Venus and Serena out of\u2014the juniors was because of the way that the parents were acting.\u201d He wanted to protect his daughters from that environment, she says. \u201cWe wanted that to be shown.\u201d\n\nBaylin especially valued input from Oracene, a more private figure who also coached her daughters and committed to the family dream of them becoming world champions."}, {"url": "https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/william-t-rich-birth-1921-death-1995/122309652", "page_content": "Refresh this page to see various historical events that occurred during William's lifetime.\n\nIn 1921, in the year that William T Rich was born, on March 4, Warren G.

He found that atoms had nuclei (a nucleus) and were circled by electrons, much as planets orbit the sun.\n\nIn 1920, by the time he was 16 years old, Italian born factory worker Nicola Sacco and fish peddler Bartolomeo Vanzetti were picked up by police on May 5th in connection with the April 15th murder and robbery of a guard and a paymaster at the Slater and Morrill Shoe Company in South Braintree, Mass. Although in later years they were thought to be innocent, they were anarchists and were convicted of the crime and put to death.\n\nIn 1933, when he was 29 years old, the day after being inaugurated, the new President, Franklin Roosevelt, declared a four-day bank holiday to stop people from withdrawing their money from shaky banks (the bank run). Within 5 days of his administration, the Emergency Banking Act was passed - reorganizing banks and closing insolvent ones. In his first 100 days, he asked Congress to repeal Prohibition (which they did), signed the Tennessee Valley Authority Act, signed legislation that paid commodity farmers to leave their fields fallow, thus ending surpluses and boosting prices, signed a bill that gave workers the right to unionize and bargain collectively for higher wages and better working conditions as well as suspending some antitrust laws and establishing a federally funded Public Works Administration, and won passage of 12 other major laws that helped the economy.\n\nIn 1959, in the year of William Rich's passing, on January 3rd, Alaska became the 49th state of the United States and the first state not a part of the contiguous United States.

Williams lost his right eye in a childhood fireworks accident. He wore a prosthetic eye for many years, but now wears an eye patch instead.\n\nIn the beginning, Williams shared guitar duties with keyboardist/guitarist Kerry Livgren. In the late 1980s, he shared guitar-playing with Steve Morse. After various personnel changes in Kansas, Williams became the band's only guitarist (guitarist Zak Rizvi joined the band in 2016), although David Ragsdale would play the extra guitar parts when the band plays songs with little or no violin, such as \"Portrait (He Knew)\", \"Fight Fire With Fire\", and \"Carry On Wayward Son\". Williams and Phil Ehart are the only two members of Kansas who have never left the band, and have played on all Kansas' albums.\n\nAmong the songs he co-wrote with the band are \"Can I Tell You\", \"No Room for a Stranger\", and the hit \"Play the Game Tonight\".\n\nDiscography"}, {"url": "https://www.guitarworld.com/features/richard-williams-not-to-sound-pompous-but-kansas-pretty-much-gave-birth-to-american-prog-bands", "page_content": "Mention the band Kansas to the average listener, and he or she will instantly name two classic rock staples: Carry On Wayward Son and Dust in the Wind.\n\n\u201cOh, sure, those are the big ones,\u201d says guitarist Richard Williams, who co-founded the progressive rock outfit back in 1970. \u201cI could let it get to me and go, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got a whole body of work,\u2019 but that would be a waste of time. Those are the songs that brought us to the table. Without Wayward Son and Dust in the Wind, we wouldn\u2019t be around today.\u201d\n\nWilliams recalls how in 1976, with the band deep in debt to their record label and facing an uncertain future after their first three albums (Kansas, Song for America and Masque) stiffed, they approached the recording of their fourth album, Leftoverture, with a sense of impending doom.\n\n\u201cIt was a pretty dark time. We were bleeding money pretty seriously,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were signed to Kirshner Records, and our benefactor, Don Kirshner, could have easily said, \u2018Guys, it\u2019s been fun, but you need to find another record company.\u2019 We needed a hit, and thank goodness we came up with Carry On Wayward Son. It saved us so we could go on. And then we had Dust in the Wind. Those songs exploded and our worlds changed forever.\u201d\n\nKansas were in a unique position in the mid Seventies. Not only did they represent the last trace of progressive rock on AM playlists that were suddenly ruled by disco, but they were also one of the very few purveyors of American prog, period.\n\n\u201cNot to sound pompous, but we pretty much gave birth to American prog bands,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is, we did it pretty sneakily. We were playing bars in Topeka, doing all the hits of the day \u2013 Motown, the British Invasion, all that \u2013 but we really wanted to do our own material.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019d slip in one of our own tunes and tell the crowd that we were playing the B-side of Smoke on the Water. We\u2019d stretch songs out and go crazy, and the people loved it. It became our thing.\u201d\n\nWe were playing bars in Topeka, doing all the hits of the day \u2013 Motown, the British Invasion, all that \u2013 but we really wanted to do our own material\n\nOf the seven current members of Kansas, only Williams and drummer Phil Ehart remain from the original crew. Singer Steve Walsh, who ended his on-and-off association with the band in 2014, has been replaced by two co-lead vocalists, Billy Greer and Ronnie Platt, who double on bass and keyboards, respectively.\n\nWilliams\u2019 longtime guitar foil Kerry Livgren, who also served as Kansas\u2019 chief songwriter, split in 2000, and in his place is New Jersey picker Zak Rizvi.\n\n(Image credit: Paul Natkin/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIt feels like a different band sometimes because we\u2019ve got a bunch of newer faces,\u201d Williams says, \u201cbut at the same time, it feels like the original band because we\u2019ve got seven guys who really love to perform and create. Back in the day, we let money and business get in the way. This bunch of guys just wants to make music.\u201d\n\nThe band has a new album out, 2020\u2019s The Absence of Presence, and all told, it sounds like quintessential Kansas: there\u2019s muscular, epic prog-rockers like Throwing Mountains and the eight-minute-plus title track, symphonic power ballads such as Jets Overhead and Memories Down the Line, and there\u2019s even a \u201chow-over-the-top-can-we-go?\u201d instrumental in the form of Propulsion 1.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of always in a state of having to prove ourselves,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWe had to do it on our last album, [2016\u2019s] The Prelude Implicit, because it was our first new music in 16 years, and I think this time we had to prove that we still mean it.\u201d\n\nHe lets out a laugh, then adds, \u201cI imagine on the next one, we\u2019ll have to do the same thing. That\u2019s OK \u2013 I\u2019m used to it.\u201d\n\nBefore the band got started, who were the guitar players that you were really listening to and emulating?\n\n\u201cI was copying anybody who was there. The Yardbirds were pretty big to me. My introduction to blues wasn\u2019t through the Americans; I dug the British guys. John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, Eric Clapton \u2013 Clapton\u2019s first solo album was like Guitar 101 to me.\n\n\u201cInstead of this twangy rhythmic instrument, suddenly here\u2019s this ballsy guitar with a guttural saxophone lead voice. Suddenly, I was hearing blues in a different way. Of course, I also loved Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck \u2013 those guys made a big impression on me. That stuff really formed the basis of my sound and style.\u201c\n\nGrowing up in Topeka, was it easy for you to get good guitars living where you were?\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. I had Marshall amps and Les Pauls. I had a Gibson ES-335, which I still have to this day. Everything that you could buy in Los Angeles you could buy in Topeka. When I was 15, I had a charge account at the local music store. If I wanted something, I\u2019d charge it and make weekly payments on it.\n\n\u201cThis was a pretty cool time. When The Beatles were on Ed Sullivan\u2019s show, Topeka exploded, just like every other town in the country. Everybody had to be in a band. There was a garage band on every block.\u201c\n\nKansas played covers in clubs for a few years. Do you remember when you first heard prog from England and when it started to influence the band?\n\n\u201cIt took a while. For a time it seemed as if only the two coasts were hearing the prog stuff. Gradually the stations in Kansas started playing it \u2013 I guess somebody\u2019s ears were tuned to it. We\u2019d be like, 'Wow, have you heard this band called ELP?' Or 'Have you heard Genesis\u2019 Selling England by the Pound?'\n\n\u201cIt was very exciting to find all these new, creative ways of addressing rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. I don\u2019t even know if 'rock \u2018n\u2019 roll' was the correct term for that music.\u201c\n\nSome bands were resistant to chance, but we embraced it... We cut our teeth on rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. But we were looking to be different\n\nEven so, it didn\u2019t seem as if American bands were jumping on the prog bandwagon. You guys were outliers.\n\n\u201cSome bands were resistant to chance, but we embraced it. I mean, we played Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels-type stuff; we cut our teeth on rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. But we were looking to be different. I remember playing cover songs during our club days. You\u2019d get to a part and be like, 'Man, this song sucks. I hate the middle part.'\n\n\u201cSo we started thinking that we could do some sort of interlude at the beginning, or maybe we could play the song at half-time. We did anything to change it up and put some balls to the music. In hindsight, we were doing something very important: We were learning how to be us.\u201c\n\n(Image credit: Dimitri Hakke/Redferns)\n\nDid it seem as if playing throughout your home state was a dead end? Did the band consider relocating to one of the two coasts to get noticed?\n\n\u201cWell, what happened was, we made a demo tape, and that\u2019s what we sent out to the coasts. One of them wound up on Don Kirshner\u2019s desk. The people at Don\u2019s company loved it \u2013 they really dug the violin \u2013 and they sent a guy named Wally Gold to check us out.\n\n\u201cWe put together a show and did that old free-beer trick: 'Come to the show and the drinks are free.' So Wally showed up and the place was packed; everybody was drunk and partying. So Wally called Don and said, 'Man, there\u2019s something going on here. People are crawling through the windows to get in the place.' That sealed the deal. Next thing you know, we signed a deal with Don Kirshner and were making records.\u201c\n\nLeftoverture [1976] and Point of Know Return [1977] hit one after the other. After being hitless for several years, that must have felt remarkable.\n\n\u201dI\u2019m still here today doing this because of that explosion. We didn\u2019t really know how huge it was at the time. We were just blue-collar guys from the Midwest. I remember arriving at Madison Square Garden in a limo with our manager, and he was going, 'Madison Square Garden! This is so big!'\n\n\u201dWe were like, 'Yeah, yeah, whatever.' We\u2019d been on the road for so long, so to us this was just a natural progression of more and more shows. Today I realize how big it was, but back then we didn\u2019t really see it.\u201d\n\nHow much of Carry On Wayward Son had Kerry written before the band got to dive into it? And how long did it take to work out that intricate guitar and keyboard solo section?\n\n\u201cThat was the last song we did for the album, on the final day or recording. Kerry came in and said he had a new song. We learned the structure of it and got to it. The version you hear on the record is probably the first time we ever played it correctly.\n\n\u201cThe solo thing didn\u2019t take long. My approach to guitar is just wing it. I didn\u2019t really have a planned solo. I just responded to what everybody else was doing and threw stuff out there. I was kind of like, 'I\u2019ll just play stuff. Let me know if it sounds right.'\u201c\n\nFor rock, it\u2019s always best if it\u2019s not perfect. You need an edge to it. I think that\u2019s one thing about Kansas that\u2019s always been cool \u2013 we have that aggression\n\nThe acoustic guitar figure of Dust in the Wind is so recognizable. I understand that Kerry wrote it as a fingerpicking exercise.\n\n\u201cYeah, Kerry didn\u2019t write the song to write a song; he wrote this chord pattern to teach himself fingerstyle guitar. His wife thought it was a song, and he was like, 'No, this isn\u2019t Kansas. The band would never play this.' But he brought it in and we thought it was really nice.\n\n\u201cThe figure was there; it didn\u2019t have the middle section or the violin solo. But it came together fast. I remember when we were listening back to it, somebody said, 'That\u2019s the next single.' Kerry didn\u2019t think so, but the rest of us knew. And sure enough \u2013 boom. The track exploded on the radio.\u201c\n\nThe way you approached the solo section of Wayward Son \u2013 is that still the way you compose leads in the studio? I\u2019m thinking of the title track of the new album, which has a similar solo structure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of the same. What happens is, somebody lays something down and everybody else plays off of it. It\u2019s very collaborative, but not as instant as it was back in the day. Somebody else\u2019s solo will dictate what you\u2019re going to do, and you take inspiration from what they\u2019ve done to go somewhere else.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always fun to do it that way. I\u2019ll lay down the foundation, and then Zak will play something; Tom will do a smoking keyboard part. Sometimes we redo our parts based on what somebody does.\u201c\n\nThe riff in the song Throwing Mountains sounds as tough and mean as early grunge. Did any of that stuff ever make an impression on you?\n\n\u201dNot really at first. I could appreciate the honesty of grunge. It\u2019s like, I loved The Beatles for their polish, but I loved The Rolling Stones for their rawness. You listen to Bob Dylan \u2013 his recordings are very elementary, but they\u2019re honest.\n\n\u201dFor rock, it\u2019s always best if it\u2019s not perfect. You need an edge to it. I think that\u2019s one thing about Kansas that\u2019s always been cool \u2013 we have that aggression. So you mention grunge and that song, sure, I\u2019ll take that. It reminds me of how punk obliterated disco back in the day. Let\u2019s get back to being raw.\u201d\n\nHow are you enjoying playing live with Zak Rizvi?\n\n\u201dOh, I\u2019m loving it. Zak has a deep love and knowledge of the band. He\u2019s a tremendous engineer and guitarist \u2013 just brilliant musically. He\u2019s a real scholar of music. Playing with him and having him in the band is great. There isn\u2019t much he can\u2019t play. I mean, he played trombone in a symphony. I have a blast working with him.\u201d\n\nWhat was it like working with Steve Morse during his time in the band?\n\n\u201dWhat an interesting guy! When he came in, he had just won every guitar award imaginable; they had to invent awards to give him. I\u2019ll be honest: I was a little intimidated at first, but I was pleased to find out that he\u2019s the least intimidating man around. He\u2019s fascinated by everything.\n\n\u201dWe would be on tour, and we would see some crappy band playing at a Holiday Inn or wherever. We would be like, 'Let\u2019s go. This band sucks.' But Steve would say, 'Did you see what that guitar player just did with his on/off switch?' The guitarist wasn\u2019t even that good, but Steve was learning from him anyway.\u201d\n\n\ufeffFor a while you played PRS guitars, but I understand you\u2019ve moved back to Les Pauls now.\n\n\u201dI still play PRS guitars occasionally, but I got my hands on a Les Paul that blew me away. It\u2019s one of the Lee Roy Parnell signature models \u2013 a reissue of the \u201957 Goldtop \u2013 and it\u2019s fabulous.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s got a support in the back of the headstock, so if it falls over it won\u2019t break, and the heel has a cutaway so you can get up the neck a lot easier. I run that through a Fractal Axe-Fx III and I\u2019m good to go. I used to have to spend hours getting tones.

I mean, it was crazy, and there\u2019s little Venus and Serena sitting in there and I\u2019m going, \u2018Jesus, this is like I\u2019m in a movie.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow Macci is in a movie: King Richard, based on the true story of maverick Richard Williams guiding his daughters from working-class Compton, California, to the pinnacle of world tennis \u2013 with the help of that first encounter with Macci in May 1991.\n\nOnce out of the van, they headed for the Williams\u2019s regular tennis courts and were hailed by some basketball players who shouted: \u201cHey, King Richard!\u201d Macci continues: \u201cThey call this guy \u2018King Richard\u2019 in 1991. We go across the basketball court and it parts like the Red Sea.\u201d\n\nFor the first hour of practice, Macci was quite impressed by Venus, then aged 10, and nine-year-old Serena, but no more than that. Once he asked them to play competitive points, however, there was an epiphany. \u201cWhat blew me away was their burning desire to get to the ball. I never saw two young female athletes try so hard to get to the ball. They\u2019d run over broken glass to get a ball.\n\n\u201cI could see the speed, the quickness, and I knew how tall they were going to be. I went right up to Richard and I said, \u2018Let me tell you something. You\u2019ve got the next female Michael Jordan on your hands.\u2019 He puts his arm around me and he goes, \u2018No, brother man, I got the next two.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis prophetic exchange is recreated by actors Will Smith as Williams and Jon Bernthal as Macci in King Richard, now out, directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green and executive produced by Venus and Serena along with their sister, Isha Price.\n\nThe biopic offers a touching portrayal of a family unit and of Williams as a fiercely determined, infuriatingly headstrong man with a plan, willing to shred conventions and upset the rarefied elites of a sport long synonymous with white privilege. It suggests this impulse flows at least partly from his own traumatic childhood in the deep south.\n\nNow 79, Williams, who is African American, was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, in the Jim Crow era of racial segregation. In his autobiography, Black and White, co-authored by Bart Davis, he writes: \u201cHatred fueled Shreveport. I often had to run from whites who tried to beat me up. I was chased with a stick, a bat, guns, and chains.\n\n\u201cMy body had a lot of reminders of the violence I knew as a child. My nose was broken three times and my teeth were knocked out. I limp to this day because, as a child, I was stabbed in the leg with a railroad spike and an ice pick by members of the Ku Klux Klan.\u201d\n\nSmith convincingly portrays a man who still carries that world on his shoulders. In Compton he works unsociable hours as a security guard and, trying to protect his daughters, falls foul of violent gangs. But he and his wife, Oracene (Aunjanue Ellis), are resolved to give their daughters \u2013 Isha, Lyndrea, Tunde, Venus and Serena \u2013 the best possible education and opportunities.\n\nIn one scene, Williams tells them: \u201cThis world never had no respect for Richard Williams, but they are going to respect y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nIn his memoir, this can come over as tough love. Williams writes that Venus and Serena \u201cdidn\u2019t have any choice but to be strong\u201d and, when they were five years old, had to learn taekwondo to protect themselves.\n\nSerena Williams, Will Smith and Venus Williams. Photograph: Matt Baron/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nHe laments about society: \u201cWe\u2019re too soft on ourselves and on our kids. We don\u2019t demand excellence. We don\u2019t train them to work hard from an early age. We want to give them kindergarten and ring-around-the-rosy and nonsense that does not really give you any security. Security comes from knowledge. Knowledge is power. Power is the ability to win.\u201d\n\nWhen Venus and Serena \u2013 played on screen by 15-year-old Saniyya Sidney and 14-year-old Demi Singleton \u2013 emerged as incandescent sporting talents, Williams worked hard to preserve their focus on school, church and fun. Macci witnessed this first-hand after the family moved to Florida so Venus and Serena could join his tennis academy, which had produced stars such as Jennifer Capriati.\n\nSpeaking from Boca Raton, Florida, he recalls: \u201cThat\u2019s why I love the guy, I tell everyone he\u2019s the best father of all time. The public look at this tyrant but he always kept balance in their lives. He wanted them to be kids.\n\n\u201cThey would always bring their books to the court. If it rained, they would go up to my office and study. If they didn\u2019t want to play, they didn\u2019t play; they\u2019d go to the mall or the beach or Disney World. The guy was in no hurry and that\u2019s why I respect him so much.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019s irreverent and mercurial style, and determination to tear up the sporting parents\u2019 playbook, posed challenges for the coach. Macci, who is 66 and still teaches 50 hours a week, says: \u201cAt the end of the day, the guy was amazing, even though I had to work around it. I told many people, \u2018Listen, doing that for four years, I should be in the hall of fame just for that!\u2019 But that\u2019s part of coaching. I had to coach the parents too.\n\n\u201cYou figure out how to do it. It takes a certain personality but I was on a mission. The cost didn\u2019t matter; nothing mattered because the girls were like family. Richard and I were best friends and when you love what you\u2019re doing and you love the people you\u2019re doing it with, you don\u2019t keep score. You find a way to make it happen and the rest is history.\u201d\n\nWill Smith with Demi Singleton, left, and Saniyya Sidney in King Richard. Photograph: Chiabella James/AP\n\nWilliams had no background in the sport and few financial resources but marched to the beat of his own drum, shrugging off media vilification as a brash self-promoter. In Smith\u2019s portrayal he is a visionary unmolested by self-doubt.\n\nMacci comments: \u201cThe guy is bulletproof. He\u2019s one of the most confident people I\u2019ve ever met in my life, and I\u2019ve met a lot of people in all walks of life. He early on instilled that into these two little girls.\n\n\u201cIf any two people would have felt more pressure \u2013 which ruins some people \u2013 it could have been Venus and Serena. It made them stronger because Richard and Oracene prepared them for how the world was going to react and respond. Venus said it best: \u2018We were almost brainwashed to think we were going to be number one.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere is no doubt in Macci\u2019s mind that Serena, who is now 40 years old and has won 23 career grand slam titles, is the greatest female player of all time, with Venus not far behind. He believes that both transcend tennis, and all sport, as role models.\n\nKing Richard depicts another coach earlier in the sisters\u2019 career: Paul Cohen (Tony Goldwyn), who first met them when Venus was seven and Serena six. In an interview from his home in San Rafael, California, the 84-year-old disputed several details in the movie, including its portrayal of Williams repeatedly interfering during a lesson to argue over the girls\u2019 on-court stance.\n\nCohen, who coached star players including John McEnroe, also rejected the film\u2019s telling of how the men parted ways, insisting that he was not fired by Williams but simply relocated with his wife to northern California and so could not continue to coach Venus and Serena.\n\n\u201cRichard and I got along really well,\u201d he says of their three years together. \u201cHe was my assistant coach and he got an A-plus. We never had a disagreement; we were good friends. Venus was like a big sister to my daughter, who was like a little baby.\n\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been a better relationship and he couldn\u2019t have been a nicer guy. They kind of portrayed him as pushy and manipulative. He never was that with me, ever. The girls were perfect students. Whatever I told them to do, they did. We never had an argument.\u201d\n\nWhen Venus was nearly eight, Cohen recalls, she suffered a debilitating condition in her feet. \u201cRichard said, \u2018My baby can\u2019t walk.\u2019 I said, \u2018Richard, that\u2019s the best thing that could ever happen.\u2019 He was shocked. I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to stand there and pitch balls to her underhanded. She\u2019ll stand on the baseline and I\u2019ll create a Michelangelo perfect tennis game.\u2019 We did this for nine months. She couldn\u2019t run and she was in pain but we just did it. Those nine months were the key.\u201d\n\nRichard Williams at Wimbledon in 2007. Photograph: Andrew Parsons/PA\n\nKing Richard culminates with Venus\u2019s debut in a professional tournament and a match against one of the best players in the world. It leaves viewers in no doubt about the historic significance of two young African American women rising to the top of the tennis world.\n\nStacey Allaster, chief executive of professional tennis at the United States Tennis Association, says: \u201cThey definitely helped to break barriers for our sport to be more inclusive of people of colour and of other diversity, and we still have a long way to go. We can\u2019t as a sport say we\u2019re there yet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been given so many gifts from Serena and Venus and Richard and Oracene and the entire family, and one of them has been inspiring other little Black girls and other little Black boys that they could play tennis and they could achieve their dreams.\u201d\n\nAllaster, who is the former chief executive of the Women\u2019s Tennis Association, adds: \u201cRichard knew Venus and Serena were going to shake up the world. They have, and it has transcended just tennis. Sport is a microcosm of society and, whether it was intentional or not, they have used their gifts on court to make a difference in the world.\n\n\u201cIt is one very strong family of courage and love and the film does a wonderful job sharing everything that family has sacrificed and gone through.

Those are the songs that brought us to the table. Without Wayward Son and Dust in the Wind, we wouldn\u2019t be around today.\u201d\n\nWilliams recalls how in 1976, with the band deep in debt to their record label and facing an uncertain future after their first three albums (Kansas, Song for America and Masque) stiffed, they approached the recording of their fourth album, Leftoverture, with a sense of impending doom.\n\n\u201cIt was a pretty dark time. We were bleeding money pretty seriously,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were signed to Kirshner Records, and our benefactor, Don Kirshner, could have easily said, \u2018Guys, it\u2019s been fun, but you need to find another record company.\u2019 We needed a hit, and thank goodness we came up with Carry On Wayward Son. It saved us so we could go on. And then we had Dust in the Wind. Those songs exploded and our worlds changed forever.\u201d\n\nKansas were in a unique position in the mid Seventies. Not only did they represent the last trace of progressive rock on AM playlists that were suddenly ruled by disco, but they were also one of the very few purveyors of American prog, period.\n\n\u201cNot to sound pompous, but we pretty much gave birth to American prog bands,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is, we did it pretty sneakily. We were playing bars in Topeka, doing all the hits of the day \u2013 Motown, the British Invasion, all that \u2013 but we really wanted to do our own material.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019d slip in one of our own tunes and tell the crowd that we were playing the B-side of Smoke on the Water. We\u2019d stretch songs out and go crazy, and the people loved it. It became our thing.\u201d\n\nWe were playing bars in Topeka, doing all the hits of the day \u2013 Motown, the British Invasion, all that \u2013 but we really wanted to do our own material\n\nOf the seven current members of Kansas, only Williams and drummer Phil Ehart remain from the original crew. Singer Steve Walsh, who ended his on-and-off association with the band in 2014, has been replaced by two co-lead vocalists, Billy Greer and Ronnie Platt, who double on bass and keyboards, respectively.\n\nWilliams\u2019 longtime guitar foil Kerry Livgren, who also served as Kansas\u2019 chief songwriter, split in 2000, and in his place is New Jersey picker Zak Rizvi.\n\n(Image credit: Paul Natkin/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIt feels like a different band sometimes because we\u2019ve got a bunch of newer faces,\u201d Williams says, \u201cbut at the same time, it feels like the original band because we\u2019ve got seven guys who really love to perform and create. Back in the day, we let money and business get in the way. This bunch of guys just wants to make music.\u201d\n\nThe band has a new album out, 2020\u2019s The Absence of Presence, and all told, it sounds like quintessential Kansas: there\u2019s muscular, epic prog-rockers like Throwing Mountains and the eight-minute-plus title track, symphonic power ballads such as Jets Overhead and Memories Down the Line, and there\u2019s even a \u201chow-over-the-top-can-we-go?\u201d instrumental in the form of Propulsion 1.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of always in a state of having to prove ourselves,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWe had to do it on our last album, [2016\u2019s] The Prelude Implicit, because it was our first new music in 16 years, and I think this time we had to prove that we still mean it.\u201d\n\nHe lets out a laugh, then adds, \u201cI imagine on the next one, we\u2019ll have to do the same thing. That\u2019s OK \u2013 I\u2019m used to it.\u201d\n\nBefore the band got started, who were the guitar players that you were really listening to and emulating?\n\n\u201cI was copying anybody who was there. The Yardbirds were pretty big to me. My introduction to blues wasn\u2019t through the Americans; I dug the British guys. John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, Eric Clapton \u2013 Clapton\u2019s first solo album was like Guitar 101 to me.\n\n\u201cInstead of this twangy rhythmic instrument, suddenly here\u2019s this ballsy guitar with a guttural saxophone lead voice. Suddenly, I was hearing blues in a different way. Of course, I also loved Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck \u2013 those guys made a big impression on me. That stuff really formed the basis of my sound and style.\u201c\n\nGrowing up in Topeka, was it easy for you to get good guitars living where you were?\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. I had Marshall amps and Les Pauls. I had a Gibson ES-335, which I still have to this day. Everything that you could buy in Los Angeles you could buy in Topeka. When I was 15, I had a charge account at the local music store. If I wanted something, I\u2019d charge it and make weekly payments on it.\n\n\u201cThis was a pretty cool time. When The Beatles were on Ed Sullivan\u2019s show, Topeka exploded, just like every other town in the country. Everybody had to be in a band. There was a garage band on every block.\u201c\n\nKansas played covers in clubs for a few years. Do you remember when you first heard prog from England and when it started to influence the band?\n\n\u201cIt took a while. For a time it seemed as if only the two coasts were hearing the prog stuff. Gradually the stations in Kansas started playing it \u2013 I guess somebody\u2019s ears were tuned to it. We\u2019d be like, 'Wow, have you heard this band called ELP?' Or 'Have you heard Genesis\u2019 Selling England by the Pound?'\n\n\u201cIt was very exciting to find all these new, creative ways of addressing rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. I don\u2019t even know if 'rock \u2018n\u2019 roll' was the correct term for that music.\u201c\n\nSome bands were resistant to chance, but we embraced it... We cut our teeth on rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. But we were looking to be different\n\nEven so, it didn\u2019t seem as if American bands were jumping on the prog bandwagon. You guys were outliers.\n\n\u201cSome bands were resistant to chance, but we embraced it. I mean, we played Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels-type stuff; we cut our teeth on rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. But we were looking to be different. I remember playing cover songs during our club days. You\u2019d get to a part and be like, 'Man, this song sucks. I hate the middle part.'\n\n\u201cSo we started thinking that we could do some sort of interlude at the beginning, or maybe we could play the song at half-time. We did anything to change it up and put some balls to the music. In hindsight, we were doing something very important: We were learning how to be us.\u201c\n\n(Image credit: Dimitri Hakke/Redferns)\n\nDid it seem as if playing throughout your home state was a dead end? Did the band consider relocating to one of the two coasts to get noticed?\n\n\u201cWell, what happened was, we made a demo tape, and that\u2019s what we sent out to the coasts. One of them wound up on Don Kirshner\u2019s desk. The people at Don\u2019s company loved it \u2013 they really dug the violin \u2013 and they sent a guy named Wally Gold to check us out.\n\n\u201cWe put together a show and did that old free-beer trick: 'Come to the show and the drinks are free.' So Wally showed up and the place was packed; everybody was drunk and partying. So Wally called Don and said, 'Man, there\u2019s something going on here. People are crawling through the windows to get in the place.' That sealed the deal. Next thing you know, we signed a deal with Don Kirshner and were making records.\u201c\n\nLeftoverture [1976] and Point of Know Return [1977] hit one after the other. After being hitless for several years, that must have felt remarkable.\n\n\u201dI\u2019m still here today doing this because of that explosion. We didn\u2019t really know how huge it was at the time. We were just blue-collar guys from the Midwest. I remember arriving at Madison Square Garden in a limo with our manager, and he was going, 'Madison Square Garden! This is so big!'\n\n\u201dWe were like, 'Yeah, yeah, whatever.' We\u2019d been on the road for so long, so to us this was just a natural progression of more and more shows. Today I realize how big it was, but back then we didn\u2019t really see it.\u201d\n\nHow much of Carry On Wayward Son had Kerry written before the band got to dive into it? And how long did it take to work out that intricate guitar and keyboard solo section?\n\n\u201cThat was the last song we did for the album, on the final day or recording. Kerry came in and said he had a new song. We learned the structure of it and got to it. The version you hear on the record is probably the first time we ever played it correctly.\n\n\u201cThe solo thing didn\u2019t take long. My approach to guitar is just wing it. I didn\u2019t really have a planned solo. I just responded to what everybody else was doing and threw stuff out there. I was kind of like, 'I\u2019ll just play stuff. Let me know if it sounds right.'\u201c\n\nFor rock, it\u2019s always best if it\u2019s not perfect. You need an edge to it. I think that\u2019s one thing about Kansas that\u2019s always been cool \u2013 we have that aggression\n\nThe acoustic guitar figure of Dust in the Wind is so recognizable. I understand that Kerry wrote it as a fingerpicking exercise.\n\n\u201cYeah, Kerry didn\u2019t write the song to write a song; he wrote this chord pattern to teach himself fingerstyle guitar. His wife thought it was a song, and he was like, 'No, this isn\u2019t Kansas. The band would never play this.' But he brought it in and we thought it was really nice.\n\n\u201cThe figure was there; it didn\u2019t have the middle section or the violin solo. But it came together fast. I remember when we were listening back to it, somebody said, 'That\u2019s the next single.' Kerry didn\u2019t think so, but the rest of us knew. And sure enough \u2013 boom. The track exploded on the radio.\u201c\n\nThe way you approached the solo section of Wayward Son \u2013 is that still the way you compose leads in the studio? I\u2019m thinking of the title track of the new album, which has a similar solo structure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of the same. What happens is, somebody lays something down and everybody else plays off of it. It\u2019s very collaborative, but not as instant as it was back in the day. Somebody else\u2019s solo will dictate what you\u2019re going to do, and you take inspiration from what they\u2019ve done to go somewhere else.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always fun to do it that way. I\u2019ll lay down the foundation, and then Zak will play something; Tom will do a smoking keyboard part. Sometimes we redo our parts based on what somebody does.\u201c\n\nThe riff in the song Throwing Mountains sounds as tough and mean as early grunge. Did any of that stuff ever make an impression on you?\n\n\u201dNot really at first. I could appreciate the honesty of grunge. It\u2019s like, I loved The Beatles for their polish, but I loved The Rolling Stones for their rawness. You listen to Bob Dylan \u2013 his recordings are very elementary, but they\u2019re honest.\n\n\u201dFor rock, it\u2019s always best if it\u2019s not perfect. You need an edge to it. I think that\u2019s one thing about Kansas that\u2019s always been cool \u2013 we have that aggression. So you mention grunge and that song, sure, I\u2019ll take that. It reminds me of how punk obliterated disco back in the day. Let\u2019s get back to being raw.\u201d\n\nHow are you enjoying playing live with Zak Rizvi?\n\n\u201dOh, I\u2019m loving it. Zak has a deep love and knowledge of the band. He\u2019s a tremendous engineer and guitarist \u2013 just brilliant musically. He\u2019s a real scholar of music. Playing with him and having him in the band is great. There isn\u2019t much he can\u2019t play. I mean, he played trombone in a symphony. I have a blast working with him.\u201d\n\nWhat was it like working with Steve Morse during his time in the band?\n\n\u201dWhat an interesting guy! When he came in, he had just won every guitar award imaginable; they had to invent awards to give him. I\u2019ll be honest: I was a little intimidated at first, but I was pleased to find out that he\u2019s the least intimidating man around. He\u2019s fascinated by everything.\n\n\u201dWe would be on tour, and we would see some crappy band playing at a Holiday Inn or wherever. We would be like, 'Let\u2019s go. This band sucks.' But Steve would say, 'Did you see what that guitar player just did with his on/off switch?' The guitarist wasn\u2019t even that good, but Steve was learning from him anyway.\u201d\n\n\ufeffFor a while you played PRS guitars, but I understand you\u2019ve moved back to Les Pauls now.\n\n\u201dI still play PRS guitars occasionally, but I got my hands on a Les Paul that blew me away. It\u2019s one of the Lee Roy Parnell signature models \u2013 a reissue of the \u201957 Goldtop \u2013 and it\u2019s fabulous.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s got a support in the back of the headstock, so if it falls over it won\u2019t break, and the heel has a cutaway so you can get up the neck a lot easier. I run that through a Fractal Axe-Fx III and I\u2019m good to go. I used to have to spend hours getting tones. Now I can just dial in the sound, and boom \u2013 let\u2019s play.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/best-songwriters-2021", "page_content": "2021 has been a phenomenal year for writing. All of the music created by songwriters who spent 2020 killing time, facing down existential angst and penning tunes, filtered through this year.\n\nThe uncertain backdrop and enforced introspection endured by us all during that time did at least reap rich rewards for the writers among us. The competition was stiff then, but here\u2019s who you voted for as the best of the year\u2026\n\n1. Winner, Best Songwriter Guitarist 2021: Ed Sheeran\n\nThe one-man pop chart has run away with our songwriter poll, taking over 36% of the total votes for the 2021 top spot.\n\nThis year he became the first British solo artist to achieve a total of 52 weeks at number one on the singles chart (only The Beatles and Elvis have surpassed that \u2013 and they released a fair few covers).\n\nSheeran\u2019s return single Bad Habits spent 11 weeks in pole position and was only unseated by his own follow-up, Shivers. Meanwhile, fifth album = (equals) went to number one in the UK and US simultaneously and the singer-songwriter has rounded out the year with charity Christmas single, with Elton John.\n\n2. Sam Fender\n\nYou don\u2019t have to look far to find older musicians ranting about younger players\u2019 lack of a political voice or appetite for change. Fender is name you can shove back in their faces. The North Shields songwriter makes being socially conscious and politically aware sound and look good. His 2021 album Seventeen Going Under examined how the headlines hit real people, in his own life and beyond, in the form of heart-aching, pulse racing, personal rock songs.\n\n3. Julien Baker\n\nThe US songwriter\u2019s third album Little Oblivions cemented Baker\u2019s place as a master of introspective songwriting, analysing the minutiae of her thoughts and interactions in touching and surprising ways. It all comes against a musical backdrop that is just as intricate and affecting.\n\n4. Ben Howard\n\nThe songwriter\u2019s first collaboration with producer Aaron Dessner, Collections From The Whiteout, sharpened the experimental instincts found on Howard\u2019s previous record Noonday Dream. The result was an album of richly varied writing, textural experimentation and memorable melodic elements.\n\n5. Marie Ulven (Girl In Red)\n\nUlven\u2019s work as Girl In Red marries the charm from her early DIY efforts with punchy production and an open portrayal of her chaotic inner monologue. It\u2019s a messy yet masterful montage of what it means to be of a teenager and young adult in 2021.\n\n6. John Smith\n\nSmith is heavily influenced by the great British folk guitarists and songwriters. 2021\u2019s The Fray represents a changing stance \u2013 channeling peace and tranquility against a considerably more fraught backdrop, globally and personally. It\u2019s a collected, emotive record \u2013 an exercise in musical meditation.\n\n7. Daniel Donato\n\nDonato\u2019s 2021 collection Cosmic Country & Western Songs is a deftly honed blend of country music and psychedelia. He is a master of country playing techniques and the album is littered with fiery chicken-picking and memorable leads lines, yet it never overshadows the song.\n\n8. Lindsey Jordan (Snail Mail)\n\nSecond albums are often the sound of a songwriter disavowing their roots, Snail Mail\u2019s is the opposite. Valentine was birthed as Jordan sheltered from the pandemic back home in her childhood bedroom. It proved a surprisingly fertile environment for an album that still evolves \u2013 it feels more mature and better paced \u2013 yet benefits from the creative freedom found in a comfortable space.\n\n9. Morgan Wade\n\nThe country songwriter has been endorsed by Jason Isbell and Sadler Vaden. Her debut album Reckless showcases an artist well-acquainted with that unhealthy dose of real life that is deemed so essential to country music, yet it also attempts to reconcile this against a shift to a brighter future, both in and out of music.\n\n10. Beatrice Laus (Beabadoobee)\n\nLaus\u2019 released her debut album as Beabadoobee, Fake It Flowers, in 2020, so fans had to content themselves with the four-track Our Extended Play EP this year. Nonetheless, Laus shows no sign of running out ideas \u2013 it's a remarkably fresh collection of airy 90s-tinted addictive guitar pop that wears its heart on its sleeve."}, {"url": "https://www.guitarworld.com/magazine/dear-guitar-hero-richard-williams", "page_content": "Richard Williams. He\u2019s played on every Kansas album since with the group\u2019s self-titled 1974 debut. But what Guitar World readers really want to know is\u2026\n\nWhy do you think the Seventies produced so many iconic bands? \u2014 Rich Fazio\n\nIt was a time of unrestricted experimentation. In addition to pop-music groups, there were bands that stuck out of the box, and it was allowed by the record companies.\n\nBut the music business squashed that a long time ago. Bands are still playing challenging stuff, but in the popular world of music most of them are never going to see the light of day. The Seventies bands were immediately identifiable, and each had its own stamp.\n\nKansas sold out Madison Square Garden when they played there [June 28, 1978]. What do you remember about that show? \u2014 Carmine D\u2019urso\n\nThree things pop into my head right away. First, riding to the show in a limousine. It was just another arena show for us, because we were so unaffected by our success. In hindsight, though, I thought, Holy shit, we just played the Garden, and it sold out! The second thing that stands out is that, on the way to the show, Jeff Glixman, our road manager then, got pissed off after seeing people on the side streets selling bootleg Kansas T-shirts.\n\nSo he got out of the limo and told some guy to stop selling them, and the guy pointed a pistol at Jeff and told him to get out of his face. The third thing that comes to mind is we wanted to record our live album, Two for the Show, at the Garden. We had the mobile recording track with us at the venue that night, but the American Federation of Musicians wanted to charge us $50,000 to use it, so we told the union we weren\u2019t paying that sum of money and recorded the album in Philadelphia and elsewhere.\n\nAlthough Kansas is best known for \u201cCarry On Wayward Son\u201d and \u201cDust in the Wind,\u201d to me those songs don\u2019t accurately represent the group\u2019s sound. Overall, on the majority of your catalog, Kansas sounds like an American counterpart to European progressive rock bands such as Yes and King Crimson. Would you agree? \u2014 Albert Morris\n\nThe heart of Kansas is in that style of music, but we don\u2019t sound like any of those groups. We\u2019re a ballsy American rock band above all. But those bands were our heroes and made us realize that you could assemble songs in weird time signatures and didn\u2019t have to format music in a traditional manner. Those are the types of influences that, collectively, brought the original members of Kansas together. Personally, I loved early Yes, early Genesis and Gentle Giant, and each of the bands from that genre were completely and uniquely different from each other.\n\nKansas\u2019 level of musicianship is awesome, yet you\u2019ve channeled that virtuosity into many catchy, memorable songs. What makes the band so versatile? \u2014 Mike Sabatino\n\nComing out of Topeka, Kansas, there were a lot of guitarists I knew who were better than me. If music were all about virtuosity and chops, we\u2019d all be listening to very high-brow jazz and the opera and symphonies. Individually, the members of Kansas are all pretty darn good, but collectively, the sum of the parts is incomparable.\n\nOne of the great things about music is that you can sit down and play by yourself, but it\u2019s far more joyful to hear the organic sound of people of like thought playing together. That\u2019s what music is all about. The members of Kansas had a common direction. We were friends who stuck together and created something magical.\n\nI saw the promotional video for Kansas\u2019 documentary, Miracles Out of Nowhere, online. I was happy to see artists as diverse as Brian May and Garth Brooks gush about the band. Why do you think Kansas\u2019 music appeals to not just the public at large but big-name musicians as well? \u2014 John Dinapoli\n\nThere\u2019s an honesty to our music; all people can relate to it. We\u2019re not contrived, we\u2019re not an act, and we\u2019ve never chased fame. We\u2019ve always been a hard-working, blue-collar band. Kansas was the opening act for Queen\u2019s first U.S. tour, and we bonded with those guys. Brian\u2019s appreciation for us has always been heartfelt.\n\nI\u2019ve known for years that Garth was one of our biggest fans. He\u2019s been able to incorporate the rock-concert experience into country music, which I\u2019m proud to say was partly inspired by Kansas and his admiration of us. Regarding the documentary, we just wanted to tell the story of the original band members coming from Topeka and climbing to the top of the mountain.\n\nWhen all the original members were in the band, Kansas could replicate its studio recordings with great clarity and precision onstage. How did you guys pull this off so effortlessly? \u2014 Vincent Macrino\n\nIt was the mindset at the time. Onstage, we\u2019d play our most demanding songs from our albums and pull them off. We\u2019d record the songs as if we were playing them live.\n\nWhat was it like coming from Topeka to New York City to record Kansas\u2019 first album at the Record Plant, where John Lennon and other famous artists also happened to be recording at the time? \u2014 Lauren Glaser\n\nIt was quite an experience. I didn\u2019t get to see John Lennon\u2014I would\u2019ve shit myself had I did\u2014because we were on the graveyard shift in Studio C while the big acts were recording in a different part of the building. The studio was near Times Square, which was not cleaned up like it is today. There were drug dealers, hookers and porn everywhere. It wasn\u2019t safe walking those streets at night.\n\nPeople would approach you and say, \u201cWanna buy some shit?\u201d It was terrifying. As for our first album, it was recorded, mixed and completed in three weeks. I cowrote the opening track, \u201cCan I Tell You,\u201d which was the song that caught [manager/producer] Don Kirshner\u2019s attention and landed us a record deal.\n\nKerry Livgren was Kansas\u2019 primary songwriter during the band\u2019s heyday. How much input did you have on his songs? \u2014 Pete Bedrosian\n\nIt varied. Some songs were written entirely by Kerry, while others were a group effort. He has the remarkable ability to compose songs in his head in an evening; then he\u2019d present them to the band, tell us what to play, and we\u2019d help him arrange the parts and offer our suggestions.\n\nKerry was influenced by classical music, and it shows in his writing. Besides being a superb guitarist and keyboardist, Kerry is a songwriting genius. I mean, here\u2019s a guy who was able to turn a fingerpicking exercise, \u201cDust in the Wind,\u201d into one of the most popular songs of all time! There is and never has been a song like that on the radio.\n\n\u201cIcarus (Borne on Wings of Steel)\u201d is one of the heaviest yet most progressive songs I\u2019ve ever heard. What inspired it? \u2014 Sid Rosenthal\n\nThe song revolves around the whole concept of flight. Kerry was very inspired by aviation. Both he and his father flew planes. The lyrics are about the story of Icarus, and musically the song has many shifts in dynamics. Whenever a band member would bring in a song, it would go through the Kansas \u201cmeat grinder,\u201d in that we would just chew it to pieces. Each member of the band would challenge one another. Dave [Hope, bass], in particular, was brutal. He would say things like, \u201cThat middle section sucks! Crank it up! We need something with more backbone there.\u201d \u201cIcarus\u201d goes over great live. The crowd goes wild when we play it.\n\nCan you talk about the incident that led up to you losing your right eye one Fourth of July in your early teens when a homemade bomb blew up in your face? \u2014 Gary Deleo\n\nIt was the summer between seventh and eighth grade. It was hotter than hell, and I had already blown up all my fireworks. So I took money out of my coin collection and got on my bicycle and rode to the outskirts of town to buy more fireworks. Then I went down to my basement and dumped all the powder from the firecrackers into a glass medicine bottle with a porcelain top with the intention of making a bomb that would make more of a statement than simply blowing up a bunch of firecrackers.\n\nBut when I twisted the lid shut, the friction from the threading on the bottle sparked, and the whole thing exploded and ripped me to pieces, and my parents rushed me to the hospital. I wore a prosthetic eye for a while, but I got rid of it because it wasn\u2019t very comfortable.\n\nWhat inspired you to play guitar, and who are your musical influences? \u2014 Jerry Egan\n\nSeeing the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964 inspired me to want to be in a band. I didn\u2019t begin playing guitar then, but that\u2019s when I wanted to start. The guitarists in the Yardbirds had a huge influence on me\u2014Page, Clapton and Beck contributed greatly to the development of rock guitar. And John Mayall\u2019s Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton was mind blowing. It was an album where guitar was not a background accompaniment; it hit you right in your face. That was \u201cGuitar 101\u201d to me.\n\nPhoto: Neil Zlozower/Atlas Icons"}, {"url": "https://moneyinc.com/richest-guitarists-world/", "page_content": "Building a career in music might be a gamble, but if that gamble pays off, the rewards are huge. Some of the biggest names in music are sat on fortunes worth millions of dollars. Surprisingly, not all of them are singers or frontmen.\n\nThe leader and songwriter might get the lion\u2019s share of a band\u2019s riches, but there\u2019s still plenty left over for the guitarist. If that guitarist also happens to tick the singer, songwriter, and band founder boxes, so much the better.\n\nIf you\u2019re keen to find out which guitarist is the wealthiest of them all, take a look at our list of the 20 richest guitarists in the world.\n\n20. Mark Knopfler \u2013 Net Worth: $95 Million\n\nAs a songwriter, film score composer, guitarist, record producer, lead vocalist, and the founder of Dire Straits, Mark Knopfler is clearly a man of many talents\u2026 and many millions. By the latest reckoning, Knopfler is worth the grand total of $95 million, making him one of the richest men in rock and an easy candidate for our top 20.\n\n19. Tony Iommi \u2013 Net Worth: $140 Million\n\nUp next is Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s long-suffering bandmate, Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath. As one of the pioneers of heavy metal, Iommi\u2019s influence on rock metal can\u2019t be overstated. Widely considered to be one of the greatest guitarists of all time, the techniques he developed during the band\u2019s formative years are credited with changing the shape of music as we know it today. He\u2019s currently estimated to be worth $140 million.\n\n18. Pete Townshend \u2013 Net Worth: $150 Million\n\nAuthor, rocker, vocalist, songwriter, and guitarist Pete Townshend is best known as one of the founding members of the legendary rock group, The Who. In addition to founding the band and playing the keyboard, mandolin, drums, bass guitar, banjo, and almost everything else for them, he also acted as their principal songwriter, penning over 100 songs in total and contributing to the sale of over 100 million albums worldwide.\n\nAcknowledged as one of the greatest guitarists of all time, he\u2019s won numerous awards and accolades over the course of his career, including induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. His current net worth is around $150 million.\n\n17. Angus Young \u2013 Net Worth: $160 Million\n\nScottish-born Australian guitarist and songwriter Angus Young may dress like an overgrown schoolboy, but he\u2019s clearly earning a lot more than just pocket money. These days, the AC/DC frontman and guitarist is worth a massive $160 million. Considering he\u2019s the founding member of the 14th best-selling band of all time, with sales of over 200 million records worldwide, it\u2019s hardly surprising.\n\n16. Jimmy Page \u2013 Net Worth: $180 Million\n\nUp next is Jimmy Page, a man who\u2019s widely considered one of the most versatile and important guitarists in living memory. His work with Led Zeppelin needs little introduction. For those who prefer their music on the mellower side, neither does his contribution to The Yardbirds.\n\nA two-time inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, a regular fixture on every \u2018Greatest Guitarist\u2019 list ever created, and an influence on almost every guitarist and musician born in the last 50 years, Page is clearly a man of immense talent, immense creativity, and, judging by his net worth of $180 million, immense wealth.\n\n15. Dave Gilmour \u2013 Net Worth: $180 Million\n\nYou don\u2019t get to be the leader of one of the most commercially successful bands of all time and not have a decent amount stashed away in the bank. If you need proof, just look at Dave Gilmour, the lead guitarist and, following the death of Roger Waters, frontman of Pink Floyd.\n\nBy all accounts, Gilmour has $180 million squirreled away in real estate, bank accounts, pensions, and other kinds of assets. Considering Pink Floyd has sold over 250 million records, it\u2019s really not surprising.\n\nOther than being very rich, Gilmour has a reputation for being charitable. Over the last few years, his work in raising awareness of climate change, homelessness, and other issues has marked him out as one of rock\u2019s biggest philanthropists.\n\n14. Kirk Hammett \u2013 Net Worth: $200 Million\n\nAccording to Metalhead Zone, Kirk Hammett is the richest metal guitarist in the world. Considering he\u2019s estimated to be worth a mammoth $200 million (a full $40 million more than the next richest, Tony Iommi), it\u2019s not surprising.\n\nRegularly ranked as one of the greatest guitarists of all time (both metal and otherwise), Hammett\u2019s influence on generations of metal fans and bands is hard to deny. Despite a history of substance abuse, Hammett is now clean and a happily married family man.\n\n13. Ronnie Wood \u2013 Net Worth: $200 Million\n\nUp next is the late Rolling Stones, Ronnie Wood. His wealth might not be in the same league as some of his bandmates, but it\u2019s still considerable enough to get him a mention. A multi-instrumentalist who first found fame with the Small Faces, Wood was recruited by The Rolling Stones in 1975 after the departure of guitarist Mick Jones.\n\nDespite being an integral part of the Stones\u2019 success over the coming decade, it would take until 1990 before the band made him an official financial partner. As Celebrity Net Worth notes, until that point, he was still technically an employee and was paid a monthly salary. Even so, his involvement with the Stones still makes up the vast bulk of his equally vast wealth.\n\n12. Brian May \u2013 Net Worth: $210 Million\n\nNo one\u2019s quite sure exactly how many records Queen has sold in total. Some people put it at a conservative estimate of 170 million. Others put it at 300 million. Either way, it\u2019s a lot of records, certainly enough to make them of the world\u2019s best-selling bands of all time.\n\nAnd unlike certain other bands, their popularity never ceases to wane. Today, they\u2019re still selling as many albums as they were doing their heyday, with the result that the fortune of each remaining bandmate continues to swell with each passing year. Guitarist Brian May is doing the best of all the band, with a net worth that\u2019s estimated to be in the region of $210 million.\n\n11. James Hetfield \u2013 Net Worth: $300 Million\n\nJames Hetfield is best known as the co-founder, vocalist, rhythm guitarist, and primary songwriter for Metallica. According to IMDb, Hetfield grew up hunting, playing guitar, and was an ordinary quiet kid. By 1981, he\u2019d clearly had enough of being quiet and ordinary and decided to form Metallica instead.\n\nSince then, he\u2019s gone on to become one of the best known and influential figures on the metal scene, with a net worth that\u2019s currently believed to be around $300 million.\n\n10. Dave Matthews \u2013 Net Worth: $300 Million\n\nIf there\u2019s a job title missing from Dave Matthews\u2019 resume, it\u2019s yet to be found. Singer, songwriter, musician, actor, record label owner, producer, and, of course, frontman, vocalist, and guitarist for the Dave Matthews Band, he\u2019s the very definition of a polymath.\n\nSince forming in 1991, the Dave Matthews Band has enjoyed phenomenal success: according to Wikipedia, they\u2019ve sold more than 20 million concert tickets and a combined total of 38 million CDs and DVDs.\n\nThe band isn\u2019t, however, Matthews\u2019 sole source of income. Believe it or not, he\u2019s one of the largest private landowners in Virginia, with a property portfolio that covers hundreds, if not thousands, of acres around the state. Despite his wealth, he lives a low-key lifestyle, residing in a modest home in Seattle purchased in 2001 for just $360,000.\n\n9. Dave Grohl \u2013 Net Worth: $320 Million\n\nHaving established himself as a drummer with Nirvana, Dave Grohl went on to prove he had more than one string to his bow as the lead singer, guitarist, and primary songwriter for the Foo Fighters. Since then, he\u2019s sold a massive amount of records and accrued an equally massive fortune of $320 million.\n\n8. Toby Keith \u2013 Net Worth: $365 Million\n\nCountry artist Toby Keith is nothing if not prolific. Between 1993 and 2000, he released a new album each year, with each record shifting at least 500,000 copies. But he\u2019s not just hard-working: he\u2019s smart.\n\nIn 1999, his label rejected a bunch of songs from his upcoming album, \u201cHow Do You Like Me Now.\u201d Keith bought back the rights to the album for $93,000, then sold it on to DreamWorks for $200,000. In the end, the album sold over 3 million copies.\n\nHis subsequent albums have proved equally successful, while his 10 percent stake in independent record label Big Machine means that every time the likes of Tim McGraw, Rascal Flatts, and Taylor Swift sell an album, at least a little of that money comes to Keith.\n\n7. Bob Dylan \u2013 Net Worth: $375 Million\n\nBob Dylan may be known best as a songwriter and singer, but it\u2019s as rare to see him on stage without a guitar as it is to see him without a surly expression and his back to the audience.\n\nWhen he swapped his acoustic guitar for an electric one at The Newport Folk Festival in 1965, he changed the face of popular music forever. Since then, he\u2019s sold over 100 million records, earned ten Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe, an Academy Award, a Presidential Medal of Freedom, and even the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nIn December 2020, Dylan sold 100 percent of his song catalog to Universal Music Publishing Group for $300 million. According to TheRichest, the deal increased his already considerable net worth to around $375 million.\n\n6. The Edge \u2013 Net Worth: $400 Million\n\nSurprisingly enough, The Edge wasn\u2019t born \u2018The Edge.\u2019 Neither was he born a multimillionaire. Yet somewhere along the line, the man formerly known as David Evans has managed to gain a new name and a heaving bank account.\n\nAs a founding member of U2, The Edge has won 22 Grammy Awards and sold between 150 and 170 million albums worldwide; as a guitarist, he\u2019s credited as one of the greatest of all time; and as an individual, he\u2019s worth a monster $400 million.\n\n5. Eric Clapton \u2013 Net Worth: $450 Million\n\nWidely considered one of the most influential guitarists and musicians of the last century, Eric Clapton is a three-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, one of the best selling artists in history, a Grammy winner, an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, a Commandeur de Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and a man with a $450 million fortune.\n\nNot all of his wealth comes from music, however: his vehicle assets, real estate, and art collection are all considered \u2018significant.\u2019\n\n4. Keith Richards \u2013 Net Worth: $500 Million\n\nAs a founding member of one of the best-selling rock bands of all time, Keith Richards is obviously not going to be short on cash at this point. And indeed, he\u2019s not.\n\nHaving sold over 200 million records worldwide with the Rolling Stones, performed at sell-out arenas across the world, and somehow managed to survive both one of the most prodigious drug habits in rock and roll and a coconut falling on his head, \u2018Keef\u2019 is now worth the grand sum of $500 million.\n\n3. Bruce Springsteen \u2013 Net Worth: $500 Million\n\nOver the course of his career, Bruce Springsteen has managed to carve out a position for himself as one of rock\u2019s most respected artists. His albums have won both commercial and critical acclaim, winning numerous awards and selling more than 135 million albums worldwide. The result? According to closerweekly.com, a net worth of $500 million.\n\n2. Jimmy Buffet \u2013 Net Worth: $600 Million\n\nJimmy Buffet might rank as one of the richest men in music, but music is by no means his only money-spinner. The global business empire spawned by his particular brand of \u201cisland escapism\u201d music covers several very successful restaurant chains (\u201cCheeseburger in Paradise\u201d and \u201cMargaritaville\u201d), several lines of products launched under the \u201cMargaritaville\u201d name (including Margaritaville Tequila, Margaritaville Records, Margaritaville Brewing, Margaritaville Footwear, and Margaritaville Foods), and even a $1 billion retirement village in Daytona Beach, Florida. With an annual income that\u2019s believed to be around $50 million, Buffet now has a total net worth of $600 million.\n\n1. Paul McCartney \u2013 Net Worth: $1.2 Billion\n\nWho else could top our list other than Paul McCartney? His work with The Beatles needs no introduction, while his work as a solo artist is said to generate around $50-70 million per year in touring, royalties, and licensing fees, both from his own back catalog and those of artists whose portfolios are owned by his publishing company, MPL Communications. As of today, McCartney is worth an incredible $1.2 billion."}, {"url": "https://www.thefamouspeople.com/briton-musicians.php", "page_content": "British Musicians\n\nRight IconThis ranking is based on an algorithm that combines various factors, including the votes of our users and search trends on the internet.\n\nBritain has a rich and varied musical history ranging from Church music to folk music to instrumentation.

A singer/songwriter turned producer, he became an essential part of George Goldner's Rama, End, and Gone Records operations, as well as Morris Levy's Roulette Records, and brought along several legendary groups of the period. He was one of the first successful independent Black record producers and also became a pioneering Black producer on Broadway.\n\nRichard Barrett (then known as Ritchie Barrett) was born and raised in Philadelphia and began singing with an R&B harmony group called the Angels during the early '50s. A charismatic singer with a fine voice, he was also a skilled dancer and choreographer, and had many good ideas about arrangements, even in those early days. Philadelphia in the early '50s wasn't the hotbed of music industry activity that it would become in the second half of the decade. Barrett took off for greener pastures in New York City around 1952 or early 1953, eking out a living as a day laborer, primarily in landscaping, and trying to find a music gig that would pay. He crossed paths with a group called the Dreamers, a local quartet he heard singing at a party, and began talking with them about the idea of joining them; he also presented them with a song that he'd written, \"Summer's Love,\" and the group was so taken with it that they added Barrett to the lineup just to get it. A quick name change to the Valentines seemed to jump-start their new configuration and the quintet began getting noticed locally; one of those who enjoyed the band's sound was Raoul Cita of the Harptones, who arranged an audition for the quintet with Monte Bruce, who was trying to start up a label called Bruce Records. A recording session yielded a tape of \"Summer's Love,\" which Bruce proved unable to release, but it did get airplay from Harlem-based DJ Willie Bryant. With Bryant's on-air help, the Valentines built up a following in Harlem and got a single released of a new version of \"Summer's Love\" backed with \"Tonight Kathleen\" on Old Town Records in November of 1954. Despite the quality of the song and its popularity on the radio, the official release of \"Summer's Love\" never charted, largely owing to Old Town's being a barely established label, but \"Tonight Kathleen\" extended the local popularity that \"Summer's Love\" had already earned the quintet. The group's next stop was George Goldner's Rama Records, another relatively new label, but one with better capitalization and distribution connections.\n\nThe group's debut Rama release, \"Lily Maebelle,\" co-authored by Barrett, was issued in the fall of 1955 and was picked up by DJ Alan Freed, who turned it into a regional hit that, in turn, transformed the Valentines into stars in Harlem. Even then, Barrett had begun pursuing other goals involving music with Rama Records. He was just as interested in the talent and business sides of the music business as he was in performing. He saw his opportunity to learn something and perhaps work in those areas with Goldner, who had five years' success behind him and knew the essentials of the business and then some; Goldner was also entering a field of music -- rhythm & blues -- that was new to Barrett. Goldner, in turn, didn't want to discourage him, recognizing him early on as a potentially serious music talent beyond his singing. Goldner had already enjoyed an unexpected national hit with \"Gee\" by the Crows, and was hoping to find acts that were good for more than a single hit record. Barrett began serving as a chauffeur and jack-of-all-trades at Goldner's office and was soon making suggestions on creative and promotional matters. What's more, even before the Valentines' record was released, Barrett was allowed to bring prospective artists in to audition and, if they were signed, he worked with Goldner producing the recording sessions that followed. Barrett also found that he fit in well working with what became the Rama (and later Gee Records) house band, led by saxman Jimmy Wright, and their method of working up arrangements on the fly.\n\nDuring the second half of 1955, Barrett lived up to Goldner's faith in him when he heard a quintet of Harlem teenagers doing a version of \"Lily Maebelle\" in the street outside of his apartment building. This was his introduction to Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers (as they were later called) and he brought them to Goldner, who duly signed them up. In late November or early December of 1955, the group recorded \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love,\" one of the defining hits of the early rock & roll era and the biggest-selling record that Goldner ever released. Meanwhile, Barrett and his group enjoyed a second local hit in the spring of 1956 with \"Woo Woo Train,\" but their fortunes were clearly on the wane. The group released two more singles without success in 1956, but by the end of that year, Barrett's involvement with the Valentines was receding rapidly as he began concentrating much more on his production activities for Goldner. Most notable was his connection with a newly signed group called the Cleftones, whose vocal arrangements and stage choreography Barrett had a major hand in shaping. Early in 1957, not long before the Valentines disbanded, he brought in another discovery in the guise of the Chantels, a quintet from New York -- whom he'd also heard singing on the street -- who are generally regarded as the first identifiable \"girl group\" in rock & roll history. Barrett became their manager and producer, and their second release, \"Maybe,\" was not only a huge hit, selling in excess of a million copies, but became an enduring classic, second only to \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\" in the Goldner library. That same year, he also produced and arranged both sides of debut single by yet another R&B vocal group, the Channels, for Goldner's Gone Records.\n\nBarrett made one more major discovery, this time within the orbit of Roulette Records -- a successor to the Rama, Gee, End, and Gone labels, formed by Goldner's partner Morris Levy -- in the form of Little Anthony & the Imperials. He finally left Goldner and Levy in 1960 to start his own label, Princeton Records: his major signing was the Veneers, a group similar to the Chantels. The Veneers never sold many records, but having them under contract served Barrett well when Arlene Smith, the Chantels' original lead singer, decided to leave. He tried taking over as lead singer on a pair of singles, \"Come Softly to Me\" and \"Summer's Love,\" but those singles didn't sell; finally, Barrett moved the Veneers' lead singer, Annette Smith, into Arlene Smith's spot in the Chantels, and later moved this version of the Chantels to Carlton and Ludix Records, where they enjoyed more hit singles. He also produced early recordings by the Isley Brothers and Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, and crossed paths with Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff before either was very well-known. After returning to Philadelphia three years later, he began producing the Three Degrees, the most enduring act with which Barrett has ever been associated. They enjoyed hits well into the '70s, including a number one record in 1974 of \"TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia),\" produced in association with Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. Barrett also worked in the late '90s producing the group Rap Machine."}, {"url": "https://www.thefamouspeople.com/american-musicians.php", "page_content": "Famous American Musicians\n\nRight IconThis ranking is based on an algorithm that combines various factors, including the votes of our users and search trends on the internet.\n\nIf you love your Bob Dylan, Jim Morrison and Bob Marley and cannot do without your daily dose of Frank Sinatra, Bruce Springsteen and Stevie Wonder, you have landed in the right page.
