Here is Surrey-White Rock, one of nine ridings in Surrey \u2014 and one the Liberals have won handily for years.\n\n1. Surrey is likely to be referred to as a \"battleground\" during the campaign \u2014 but ridings like Surrey-White Rock make that a bit of a misnomer.\n\nOf the region's nine ridings (up from eight in the last two elections), just three are considered very competitive based on polling station results from 2013: Panorama, Guildford and Fleetwood.\n\nThe rest tilt heavily toward either the B.C. Liberals or the NDP, and Surrey-White Rock is definitely Liberal country.\n\n2. Everything about Surrey-White Rock makes it look like a B.C. Liberal riding...\n\nThe Liberals have won the riding in every election since it was created prior to the 1991 vote. The NDP has never received more than 30 per cent of the vote. The riding's demographics, much older and wealthier than the other Surrey-area districts, favour the Liberals.\n\n\"These are the people who benefit from lower taxes, which is the B.C. Liberals' main theme. They tend to lower taxes for the rich who are earning more. White Rock is one of those ridings where it's an attractive offer,\" said Shinder Purewal, a political science professor at Kwantlen Polytechnic University.\n\n3. ...but there are two reasons the NDP might have a glimmer of hope.\n\nFirst, the longtime MLA for the riding, Gordon Hogg, is stepping down after 19 years in office, depriving the Liberals of the power of incumbency.\n\n\"Let me tell you, Gordie is a great guy. Everyone here loves Gordon Hogg ... find someone with a bad thing to say about Gordon Hogg, they don't know what they're talking about,\" said Don Pitcairn, a community activist who ran for the Green Party against Hogg in 2009 and 2013.\n\nAnd second, in the 2015 federal election, the Conservative Party thought it would be invincible in South Surrey-White Rock with the popular three-term mayor of Surrey Dianne Watts running for them \u2014 but she won by fewer than 1,500 votes. In the portion of that riding which makes up the provincial Surrey-White Rock riding, it was the federal Liberal candidate who received more votes.\n\n4. However, the B.C. Liberals have recruited a strong candidate.\n\nTracy Redies, the former CEO of Coast Capital Savings and current board member at the University of Victoria, was named as the party's nominee in October.\n\n\"I don't think that I'll ever be able to fill [Gordon Hogg's] shoes, but I'm hoping to try,\" she told the Peace Arch News after the announcement.\n\nThe NDP candidate is Niovi Patsicakis, a retired special education teacher and former president of the association of Surrey specialist educators, while the Green Party candidate is William Marshall, a Realtor who ran for the party in Delta North in 2013.\n\n5. Where does the NDP do well?\n\nIt has traditionally succeeded in getting votes in the apartment complexes to the northwest of White Rock Elementary and the area between King George Boulevard and Highway 99.\n\n6. What about the Liberals?\n\nThe areas in South Surrey between the ocean and Sunnyside Acres go to the Liberals in huge numbers, with Hogg regularly getting more than 75 per cent of the vote in polling stations there during his tenure.\n\nWho's running in the 2017 British Columbia election?"}, {"url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/3383494/b-c-election-2017-surrey-white-rock-riding/", "page_content": "Send this page to someone via email\n\nIn 2013, BC Liberal Incumbent Gordon Hogg easily won re-election, beating his NDP challenger by a better-than 2:1 margin (58 per cent \u2013 27 per cent).\n\nIn 2009, Hogg\u2019s margin of victory was even greater (62 per cent \u2013 27 per cent).\n\nThe riding contains the southwest corner of Surrey, White Rock and the Semiahmoo Indian Reserve. This is a safe BC Liberal seat, even with the retirement of Hogg, who has held this riding since the 1997 by-election.\n\nCandidates\n\nBC Liberals\u2019 Tracy Redies currently chairs the University of Victoria Board, and is the Former President and CEO of Coast Capital Savings (2009-2014). Redies is a high-profile female candidate with background in the business world. She has also been a member of the premier\u2019s women\u2019s economic council.\n\nNDP\u2019s Niovi Patsicakis is a retired teacher and self-described advocate for public education and social justice.

While some ridings predictably go left or right in any given election in this politically polarized city and province, Tuesday\u2019s election roughly split the city in half.\n\nTo clarify things, South Surrey and White Rock simply don\u2019t elect NDP MLAs, at the very least not in the past several decades. Surrey-Cloverdale has been a Liberal outpost since its creation in 1991, with MLAs Ken Jones holding it from 1991-96, Bonnie McKinnon from 1996 to 2001, Kevin Falcon from 2001-13, Stephanie Cadieux from 2013-17 and Marvin Hunt winning it for the Liberals on Tuesday night.\n\nCadieux won Surrey South for the Liberals while Surrey-White Rock, held by Liberal MLA Gordon Hogg for 10 years and Liberal MLA Wilf Hurd before him, once again elected a Liberal, Tracy Redies, this week.\n\nThat\u2019s three of 10 local ridings, counting Delta North among them. The seven ridings northeast of the freshly drawn political demarcation line local voters created Tuesday went NDP.\n\nSome are swing ridings. Delta North, for example, has toggled between NDP and Liberal representation. Voters there elected the NDP\u2019s Kahlon on Tuesday. He defeated Liberal Scott Hamilton. The NDP\u2019s Guy Gentner held it before him before retiring from politics. Gentner had defeated Liberal Reni Masi, who had defeated NDP MLA Norm Lortie.\n\nOf Surrey\u2019s ridings, the Surrey-Whalley re-elected NDP MLA Bruce Ralston. That riding has been a solid NDP riding with the exception of Liberal MLA Elayne Brenzinger (2001-05).\n\nLikewise, Surrey-Green Timbers, which is sending NDP-elect Rachna Singh to Victoria, has been held by the NDP with the exception of Liberal Brenda Locke (2001-05). Incumbent NDP Harry Bains handily won in Surrey Newton, again a traditional NDP riding with the exception of Social Credit premier Rita Johnston (1983-91) and Liberal Tony Bhullar (2001-05).\n\nSurrey-Panorama, once called Surrey-Panorama Ridge, has had both NDP and Liberal MLAs. It elected Jinny Sims of the NDP on Tuesday. Surrey-Fleetwood has also had NDP and Liberal MLAs.\n\nOn election night the NDP\u2019s Jagrup Brar defeated Liberal cabinet minister Peter Fassbender in that riding, and the new riding of Surrey-Guildford saw the NDP\u2019s Garry Begg defeat another Liberal cabinet minister, Amrik Virk.\n\nBut rarely have voters split the city in half like they did on Tuesday night, NDP on one side, Liberals on the other.\n\nIs it a case of haves versus have-nots?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one reason,\u201d Ralston said. \u201cThere\u2019s a correlation between income and voter preference, for sure. I think there\u2019s some validity there.\n\n\u201cThe average family income is lower in the north and gradually increases as you head south. The overriding factor was just a very effective campaign and the fact the Liberals were out of touch. They were just out of touch. They didn\u2019t value Surrey as the second biggest city and give it what it needs to thrive and prosper and people sensed that.\u201d\n\nFor example, the Surrey Homelessness and Housing Task Force staged an all-candidates meeting on the topics of affordable housing, homelessness and poverty in Surrey. It was attended by NDP, Greens, and an independent. No Liberal candidate showed.\n\nOn election night, Fassbender has this to say about his personal defeat at the polls: \u201cHaving been the education minister, education was a big issue in Surrey. We need to build more schools. (Bridge) tolls were a polarizing issue and to remove them was a big step with the implications to our credit rating.\u201d\n\nCadieux, who handily won in Surrey South, said the polarization begs review. \u201cI really don\u2019t know at this point (what led to it),\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell. We knew it was going to be close all the way along.\u201d\n\nDoes she think it\u2019s a case of haves versus have-nots?\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to simplify it that much,\u201d Cadieux said. \u201cWe\u2019re one city. The boundaries are really arbitrary, from that persective. I think we have to look though at what the issues were at the door steps.\u201d\n\nSurrey Mayor Linda Hepner, like everyone else, is trying to digest what happened Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cI hope whoever forms government \u2013 because ultimately it\u2019s a bit of a dog\u2019s breakfast right now, and we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to go \u2013 recognizes that we are in a period of tremendous growth and there needs to be particular attention paid to such a significant metropolitan city as Surrey and at the end of the day I would hope that\u2019s the kind of advocacy that we would get from all of our representatives.\u201d\n\nSo why did the south vote right and the north vote left? Hepner doesn\u2019t think growth is the reason.\n\n\u201cSouth Surrey is experiencing tremendous growth,\u201d she noted.\n\nOther than the city core, with its high-rises, she added, South Surrey is where the significant growth is right now.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a bit of real serious concern around the Guildfords and the Newtons and the city centre on the transportation options that are available in the city and I truly believe it has to do with the schools. I really do believe it has to do with the underfunding of schools at a time of significant growth.\u201d\n\nThere are, of course, schools in both the north and south of Surrey.\n\nWhat will Tuesday\u2019s election results mean for city council?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a lot different than in the past,\u201d Hepner said. \u201cWe work with whoever forms government, obviously. And my own party of council, we share a vision for the city of Surrey but we don\u2019t necessarily share the same political leanings, and in my mind that\u2019s what makes, at least at the local level, what makes it work so well.\u201d\n\nHepner sees no concerns with the divide between north and south.\n\n\u201cIs there a specific divide? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any more or less than what you\u2019re seeing in other cities. You see the same thing in Vancouver in various ridings where traditionally you would expect to see this go in a particular direction. And you see the same thing in a Burnaby, or a Coquitlam, there are always areas in a city I think that are defined by a more traditional understanding of who\u2019s going to go where. What I see as being significant is that the shift of seats tells me that the message around paying attention to the City of Surrey is forefront in the minds of the electorate.\u201d\n\nDoes Surrey\u2019s mayor think the provincial election results in her city suggest a gulf between haves and have-nots?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have tremendous haves in the arenas, of the areas of Fleetwood and Fraser Heights. Do I see it as being a have versus have not? No, I think I have pockets of wealth and pockets of poverty throughout the city.\n\n\u201cI knew there were going to be some hard-fought battles, and I knew from talking to residents myself that there was an angst around schooling and around LRT and how long that sort of funding was taking and getting on with the job of connecting our community, and I knew there was big concerns on hospitals. Certainly the messages were all there.\u201d\n\nMike Nielsen, of the Whalley Community Improvement Association, said there are more social issues at play in North Surrey than South Surrey.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of folks have the mindset that the NPD is more focused on change and improvement,\u201d Nielsen said. \u201cPeople felt that four terms was enough, and they sought a change to keep the Liberals honest.\u201d\n\nMichael Musgrove, executive director of Surrey Urban Mission Society, said \u201cperhaps people thought the NDP would be more favourable toward building a social support system that is more effective.\u201d\n\nJonquil Hallgate, a long-time advocate for Surrey\u2019s homeless, suggested boundary changes in Guildford and Fleetwood could have been a factor in why the north part of the city went NDP orange.\n\n\u201cPrior to the last four years those neighbourhoods may have been more Liberal but with the changes, it added some NDP votes into the mix that weren\u2019t maybe part of the equation previously.\n\n\u201cIt just has to do with peoples\u2019 appetite to see things done differently and the government being accountable and responsive.\u201d The spectre of homelessness, Hallgate added, is now having an impact on the middle class and young people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s making people think differently.\u201d\n\nWith files from Amy Reid and Rick

What I see as being significant is that the shift of seats tells me that the message around paying attention to the City of Surrey is forefront in the minds of the electorate.\u201d\n\nDoes Surrey\u2019s mayor think the provincial election results in her city suggest a gulf between haves and have-nots?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have tremendous haves in the arenas, of the areas of Fleetwood and Fraser Heights. Do I see it as being a have versus have not? No, I think I have pockets of wealth and pockets of poverty throughout the city.\n\n\u201cI knew there were going to be some hard-fought battles, and I knew from talking to residents myself that there was an angst around schooling and around LRT and how long that sort of funding was taking and getting on with the job of connecting our community, and I knew there was big concerns on hospitals. Certainly the messages were all there.\u201d\n\nMike Nielsen, of the Whalley Community Improvement Association, said there are more social issues at play in North Surrey than South Surrey.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of folks have the mindset that the NPD is more focused on change and improvement,\u201d Nielsen said. \u201cPeople felt that four terms was enough, and they sought a change to keep the Liberals honest.\u201d\n\nMichael Musgrove, executive director of Surrey Urban Mission Society, said \u201cperhaps people thought the NDP would be more favourable toward building a social support system that is more effective.\u201d\n\nJonquil Hallgate, a long-time advocate for Surrey\u2019s homeless, suggested boundary changes in Guildford and Fleetwood could have been a factor in why the north part of the city went NDP orange.\n\n\u201cPrior to the last four years those neighbourhoods may have been more Liberal but with the changes, it added some NDP votes into the mix that weren\u2019t maybe part of the equation previously.\n\n\u201cIt just has to do with peoples\u2019 appetite to see things done differently and the government being accountable and responsive.\u201d The spectre of homelessness, Hallgate added, is now having an impact on the middle class and young people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s making people think differently.\u201d\n\nWith files from Amy Reid and Rick Kupchuk\n\nSurrey Election Results"}, {"url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/7230550/bc-liberal-mla-tracy-redies-stepping-down-to-become-next-science-world-ceo/", "page_content": "Send this page to someone via email\n\nB.C.

It has also inspired him to foster four young people and to go on and found Night Hoops Basketball, a no-cost community program that helps get youth of the street.\n\nHogg has also earned bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees, and latterly a Ph.D, for which his thesis very much hewed to his passion: \u2018Creating Public Policy in a Complex Society.\u2019\n\nPeace Arch News"}]}
