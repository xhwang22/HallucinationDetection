The CIC \u2013 Central Information Commissio n said that Indian Banks Association qualifies to be a public authority under the RTI Act, 2005 and directed it to designate an official as the CPIO and to comply with Section 4 of the RTI Act. IBA filed a writ petition before the Delhi High Court the order of Central information Commission was stayed by the Court. As per the Court\u2019s observation IBA is an association of banks that has 241 members and only 9 members are from the PSBs.\n\nTake Away from the IBA Case\n\nIdeally, who controls the IBA, the financial contribution to run the IBA and how the positions are held should have been considered. The number of Public Sector banks mentioned was incorrect as there were 16 Public Sector Banks before the merger of 10 PSBs into 4 banks effective from April 1, 2020. More than 50% of management committee members of the Indian Banks\u2019 Association are from PSBs & the amount of money that flows from Public Sector Banks to IBA is not available in the public domain. Moreover, the comparison on the number of PSBs and the private banks is inappropriate. Transparency and accountability in administration is a precondition for a participatory democracy. Hence the government must instruct the Managing Committee of IBA from PSBs to ensure that IBA comes under the RTI Act.\n\nIndian Banks Association [UPSC Notes]:-Download PDF Here\n\nCandidates preparing for the upcoming Civil Services Exam can get the detailed UPSC Syllabus and exam pattern at the linked article.\n\nRelated Links:"}, {"url": "https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/10/17/indian-banks-association-iba/", "page_content": "Topics Covered: Statutory, regulatory and various quasi-judicial bodies.\n\nIndian Banks\u2019 Association (IBA):\n\nContext:\n\nThe managing committee of Indian Banks\u2019 Association (IBA) has elected Union Bank of India\u2019s MD and CEO Rajkiran Rai G. as the association\u2019s chairman for 2020-21.\n\nAbout Indian Banks\u2019 Association (IBA):\n\nFormed in 1946.\n\nIt is a representative body of management of banking in India operating in India \u2013 an association of Indian banks and financial institutions based in Mumbai.\n\nIBA was formed for development, coordination and strengthening of Indian banking, and assist the member banks in various ways including implementation of new systems and adoption of standards among the members.\n\nMembers:\n\nWith an initial membership representing 22 banks in India in 1946, IBA currently represents 237 banking companies operating in India.\n\nInstaLinks :\n\nPrelims Link:\n\nAbout IBA.
