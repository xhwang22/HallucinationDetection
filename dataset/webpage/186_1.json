He was originally from the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City, New York.\n\nRankin was raised in New York and was introduced to music by his mother, who sang at home and for friends. The area of Washington Heights, Manhattan was becoming heavily Latino during his youth, and exposure to street music may have played a part. He began recording at age 17 (1957), eventually working as a songwriter contracted to Columbia Records. Rankin's earliest composition, \"My Carousel\" was written for Carmen McRae, followed by \"A Happy Guy\" for teen idol Rick Nelson. He had already developed a serious amphetamine problem by that time.\n\nHe taught himself classical guitar, at age 24, inspired by the playing of Don Costa, who had started on that instrument before becoming one of the most important arrangers in popular music. He played rhythm guitar on some tracks on Bob Dylan's album Bringing It All Back Home (1965). Rankin developed a considerable following during the 1970s with a steady flow of albums, three of which broke into the Top 100 of the Billboard Album Chart. His liking for jazz was evident from an early age, but the times were such that in order to survive his career had to take a more pop-oriented course, and he cited singer-songwriter Laura Nyro consistently as a major influence.\n\nRankin appeared on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson more than twenty times. Carson was so impressed by him that he wrote the liner notes to Rankin's 1967 debut album Mind Dusters, which featured the single \"Peaceful.\" Rankin's friend Helen Reddy would reach #2 Adult Contemporary and #12 Pop in 1973 with a cover of it, released as her follow-up single to \"I Am Woman\". Georgie Fame also had a hit with this song in 1969, his only songwriting credit to hit the British charts reaching number sixteen and spending 9 weeks on the chart.\n\nRankin's original song \"In the Name of Love\" frequently featured wordless improvisational singing and showed his range and command of articulating lyrics at a blistering waltz tempo, but performed more slowly it had a distinctly Brazilian flavor. Similar to later singer Mandy Patinkin, Rankin's speaking voice was a rich baritone, but his tessitura was an octave higher, with an occasional start at near his speaking timbre, as in \"What Matters Most.\" The timbre of his singing voice most frequently resembled that of a clarinet. His remarkably quick mastery of the guitar allowed him to appear, along with Randy Newman and Joni Mitchell, as one of the few self-sufficient solo acts conveying original material with harmonic richness beyond that of folk and early rock music.\n\nHe was extremely private in his early televised interviews, once stating that personal information distracted from musical performance, and thus even his date of birth was considered anecdotal information. Later, he became more open and stated in interviews that in the 1960s and 1970s he had suffered from serious addictions which affected his career, and he credited his family, and a period of spiritual study while undergoing rehabilitation sessions, for helping him to overcome his drug and alcohol problems by the early 1980s. Some recorded songs on the Little David record label (a subsidiary of Atlantic Records) featured his wife Yvonne and his daughters singing background, as the Rankin Family Band. His album Family featured cover art of Rankin holding his two young daughters. The Rankins also had a son.\n\nOccasionally criticised for poor choice of material, considering his talents, by the 1990s, he was able to angle his repertoire to accommodate his own musical preferences and to please a new audience while still keeping faith with the faithful. Rankin's warm singing style and his soft, nylon-stringed guitar sound might suggest an artist more attuned to the supper-club circuit than the jazz arena, but his work contains many touches that appeal to the jazz audience, especially as he introduced more \"standards\" from the 1930s and 1940s into his performances. Reviews in the periodical Down Beat and later print media increasingly reinforced his jazz credentials.\n\nRankin's song \"Haven't We Met\" was performed by Mel Torm\u00e9 and Carmen McRae, while Stan Getz said of him that he was \"a horn with a heartbeat\". Rankin's accompanists have from time to time included pianists Alan Broadbent, Mike Wofford and trombonist Bill Watrous, and on such occasions the mood slips easily into a jazz groove. But Don Costa's full orchestral arrangements were used to back his voice to critical acclaim, following a trend in the wake of Harry Nilsson with Gordon Jenkins and Linda Ronstadt with Nelson Riddle, to emulate the lush soundscape that some say reached its apogee with Frank Sinatra's Capitol recordings. Rankin was also deeply interested in Brazilian music and his Here In My Heart, on which he used jazz guests including Michael Brecker and Ernie Watts, was recorded mostly in Rio de Janeiro. More contemporary songs were given an airing following his move to Verve Records, including the Beatles' \"I've Just Seen A Face\" and Leon Russell's \"A Song For You.\"\n\nRankin's own unique gift for reworking classic songs such as The Beatles' \"Blackbird,\" which he recorded for his Silver Morning album, so impressed Paul McCartney that he asked Rankin to perform his interpretation of the song when McCartney and John Lennon were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nRankin was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in May 2009. He died in Los Angeles, California - where he had resided for many years - from the disease on June 7, 2009.

Instinctively drawn to jazz, drummers in particular, such as Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich, Joe Morello, Ed Thigpen and Elvin Jones, as a child Vannelli studied drums and music theory for five years. Gino\u2019s first foray into pop music came one afternoon as a group of young drummers stood in line, waiting to take turns to audition for a Montreal East group called the Cobras. The rite of passage involved playing a tune called \u201cWipeout\u201d by the Ventures. Having never heard the song before, Gino made sure he waited to the very last, studying the parts every aspiring drummer played, or was trying to play. That afternoon, Gino came home a little later than usual from school, but as the official drummer for the Cobras. A year later, with his brother Joe holding down the keyboard chair, Vannelli headed up the Motown-influenced Jacksonville 5 (note, this is five years before the Jackson 5 recorded their first record). Along the way there were guitar and piano lessons. The urge to compose words and music followed not long after. At fourteen, Gino began his official singing career when the singer in the band fortuitously couldn\u2019t make the high water mark in a then popular tune by a gritty Welshman, Tom Jones, called \"It\u2019s Not Unusual\".\n\nTo add complication as well as interest to his musical affinities, Gino had fallen in love with classical music\u2014French Impressionism, Italian Opera, and 20th century Russian composers in particular. Attending concerts given by the Montreal Symphony every last Thursday of the month for one semester, had proven to be life-changing (his 2000 release of Canto being testament). \"I seemed to have had a double standard, or at least torn between a few distinct sounds and styles,\" reflects Vannelli. \"I used to defend Charlie Watts and Ringo Starr, insisting they were part of something new and exciting to my purist, jazz-head friends. Yet, when I\u2019d listen to Dave Brubeck\u2019s Time Out, or Miles Davis\u2019s Birth of the Cool, pop would suddenly plead no contest\u2014well, at least for that moment. One Thursday afternoon at Place Des Arts, I remember hearing the Montreal Symphony playing \u201cDaphne and Chloe\u201d by Maurice Ravel. I walked away shaking my head, muttering to myself, \u2018What was that!? I was so deeply moved\u2014bewildered by the sounds I had just heard. It was the moment I discovered to what heights music could draw a man\u2019s soul.\"\n\nBefore his seventeenth birthday, Vannelli had signed with RCA Records of Canada, releasing a single called \u201cGina Bold\u201d under the pseudonym Van-Elli. Ambitious and now bitten by the music industry bug, Gino lived on and off in New York City, making the record company and publisher\u2019s rounds, finally ending up at the foot of the gates of A&M Records in Hollywood three years later. Gino, accompanied by his brother Joe, and down to their last five-dollar bill, made one last ditch effort to get signed before having to trek back to Montreal. Early one morning, Gino headed out to the offices of A&M Records where he waited outside the gates for any sign of company co-owner Herb Alpert. As Alpert was walking through the parking lot hours later, Vannelli ran past the gates, racing by a startled and furious security guard. Before he could be accosted he begged a slightly apprehensive Alpert for a chance to audition. Acting on a hunch, (and much to the guard\u2019s annoyance) Herb was sympathetic, telling the young hopeful to return later that afternoon. Gino proceeded to play songs on his acoustic guitar he had recently written, including \u201cPeople Gotta Move,\u201d \u201cCrazy Life,\u201d \u201cMama Coco,\u201d \u201cPowerful People\u201d and \u201cLady\u201d\u2014songs that would end up on the six albums Vannelli would record for A&M between 1974 and 1978. That very day, Gino was welcomed as a new member of the A&M family.\n\nBillboard & Juno Awards, Gold & Platinum\n\nFive of those six albums made the top 100 Billboard album charts, culminating with Brother to Brother (co-produced by brothers Joe, and Ross) which achieved a coveted Top 10 position in the fall of 1978. \u201cI Just Wanna Stop\u201d made it to the 4th spot on the Billboard singles chart. Forever the impassioned artist, Vannelli\u2019s A&M albums consisted of a range of material: from experimental synthesizer arrangements, live orchestral pieces, jazz inflected tunes, to contemporary R&B inspired songs. Having toured with Stevie Wonder, (which led to Gino\u2019s notable appearance on Soul Train\u2014a first for a white artist) Gino soon became a headlining artist, selling out concerts halls and arenas in Canada and the US by twenty-three years of age. Earning a handful of Grammy nominations, and numerous Juno Awards in his native Canada, Gino had arrived.\n\nIn 1980, Vannelli signed with Arista Records. His sole Arista album, Nightwalker, provided him with a top-ten pop hit, \u201cLiving Inside Myself.\u201d When Vannelli opted to follow it up with a stripped-down, edgier album called Twisted Heart, for the first time in his career he found himself with a less than enthusiastic label, unwilling to release an album. For the next three years, in a move reminiscent to episodes in the careers of George Michael and Prince, Vannelli and his record company engaged in a long battle of creative wills\u2014songs being the sum and substance of the contention. Vannelli comments \"There comes a day when an artist has to make a hard choice between two roads that lie ahead, knowing full well even the one he knows to be right will lead to a dark forest, leastways for the foreseeable future... comes a time when success must be measured by a different yardstick.\u201d\n\nAfter a four-year hiatus, Vannelli had finally come through the dark forest and was released from his Arista contract and in 1985 he released the successful Black Cars album and landmark video in Europe. It soon became Vannelli\u2019s most successful international work to that date. Two years later, he recorded Big Dreamers Never Sleep for CBS, whose single, \"Wild Horses,\" stormed its way to the Top 10 in several countries. A successful North American artist, through some strange twist of fate, had suddenly landed feet first on the world stage. To this day, he continues to have a large, international following, giving concerts from Chicago to Cape Town. By 1990, Vannelli had grown skeptical and weary of the music industry status quo, and the Hollywood mindset. After throwing himself headlong into the study of the humanities, a careful examination of world religions, philosophies, both Eastern and Western, he decided it was time to move his family north to Oregon. \"I decided to pull myself out of the mainstream,\" he explains, \"and roam the banks.\"\n\nSigning with Verve Records, both Vannelli\u2019s commercial outlook and output took a radical swing with the largely acoustic-jazz albums Yonder Tree and Slow Love, released in 1995 and 1997 respectively. Vannelli notes, \"I had finally rounded some of my enduring and obsessive visions of the jazz-pop idiom in these two recordings. To his day I listen to those recordings with a sense of satisfaction, at least as much as the ongoing urge to move forward allows\".\n\nBy the end of the decade his muse was taking him still further afield, toward one of his earliest loves, classical music. Having just produced a CD, called Hitek Hiku for Danish jazz pianist Niels Landoky, Gino had included a song called \u201cParole Per Mio Padre\u201d (A Word to My Father), dedicated to his late father, in the style and tradition of Schubert. It seemed good fortune caught up with Vannelli once more, as one day out of the clear blue, the Vatican called Gino personally, asking him to perform the song for Pope John Paul. Soon after the show had been televised in Europe, the head of BMG Records asked Vannelli to record a contemporary classical CD in the same mode as \u201cParole per Mio Padre\u201d; thus the birth of what many say is one of Gino\u2019s finest musical accomplishments, Canto, released by BMG in 2003. The CD features songs sung in English, Italian, Spanish and French. Singing music from Canto remains one of the highlights of Gino\u2019s present-day live performances.\n\nIn 2005 Gino released These Are the Days under the Universal label. It was a compilation that combined seven of his earlier classic hits with seven new songs, marking the debut of yet another phase of Vannelli\u2019s continually fascinating career and a return to the pop genre that made him an icon. In 2007, forever pursuing new sound images and poetic themes, Gino spent long periods in the Netherlands, taking in the culture, listening to Dutch musicians and forming new associations. It culminated in the 2009 release of a CD/poetry book entitled, A Good Thing. \"It began by doing nothing other than watching and listening, which eventually ended in the urge to lay my thoughts to poetry. By the time I got to fifty or so poems, the instinct to put music to the verse led to A Good Thing. New methods bring new music.\"\n\nIn late 2009, amidst a very busy touring schedule, Gino managed to find the time to re-record many of his better known songs for a CD entitled, The Best & Beyond. \"True, some may consider The Best & Beyond simply a modernization or update of my older material, but I feel it is much more a statement of my present-day musical mindset, not to mention some incredible musicianship by a few Portland musicians\".\n\nGino\u2019s First Published Book\n\nWhen Gino was asked to write liner notes for The Best & Beyond, he found himself more eager to share personal information than what was originally needed. The notes grew into his first published book called, Stardust in the Sand\u2014a historical and candid account of life and times culminating into the songs on The Best & Beyond included in the back flap. The last chapter entitled, Godlings and Feet of Clay is a humorous telling of chance encounters with famous musicians, including Sting, Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder, and Marvin Gaye, to name a few.\n\nWhether performing piano-voice concerts in theaters, singing before symphony orchestras in concert halls, big bands or a pop ensemble to throngs of enthusiastic fans, Gino remains impassioned and true to his art as ever. Gino Vannelli\u2019s standing as a powerful and innovative live performer, his well hewn musical skills as composer, poet, producer and arranger, his engaging persona notwithstanding, keep his career rising to greater heights. \"The best works lie in the wake of reaching.\""}, {"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gino-vannelli-mn0000948061/biography", "page_content": "While it's indisputable that Gino Vannelli was truly prominent within a specific 12-year period, there is also no doubt that he has been one of the most dynamic and enduring artists since his 1970 debut. The singer, songwriter, arranger, and producer is in what must be a small class of musicians who have scaled the upper reaches of Billboard's pop, rock, adult contemporary, R&B, club, jazz, and classical charts. He hit his stride in the mid '70s with a succession of bold albums appealing to all of those audiences and more, as they integrated a multitude of styles in a way that exemplified fusion in the truest sense, and centered his lithe, soaring, and virtuosic vocals with total conviction. A hot streak of gold records in Vannelli's native Canada culminated in Brother to Brother (1978), a platinum album featuring the Canadian number one hit \"I Just Wanna Stop,\" also a Grammy-nominated Top Ten U.S. hit. Since the '80s, during which he scored a second Canadian platinum album with Black Cars (1984), Vannelli has moved steadily from one unpredictable project the next. Among these are Yonder Tree (1995), a primarily acoustic jazz date; Canto (2002), a classical pop recording with lyrics in four languages; and Wilderness Road (2019), his third album to land on the jazz chart.\n\nGino Vannelli started on drums as a young jazz enthusiast in his hometown of Montreal. Well before his teens, he successfully auditioned for a local band called the Cobras, having learned the Ventures' \"Wipeout\" on the spot by listening to the hopefuls before him. Shortly thereafter, he formed the Motown-inspired Jacksonville Five -- years before the emergence of the Jackson 5 -- starting on drums and moving to lead vocals when Tom Jones' \"It's Not Unusual\" proved too much a challenge for the band's singer. In 1970, still a teenager, Vannelli debuted under the name Vann-Elli with a one-off RCA Victor single consisting of \"Gina Bold\" and \"Never Cry Again,\" songs he wrote and co-arranged that flitted between bubblegum pop and blue-eyed soul. The A-side registered on the Canadian pop chart at number 92.\n\nFurther pursuance of a music career in New York was unfruitful. However, during a West Coast trip with his brother Joe -- who had played keyboards in the Jacksonville Five -- Vannelli approached trumpeter and A&M co-founder Herb Alpert in the A&M Records parking lot, performed a few songs for the label boss later that day, and secured a contract. Enriched by his musical theory studies at McGill University and possessing a cache of original material, Vannelli was primed for artistic and commercial breakthroughs but didn't achieve them until the follow-up to his Alpert-produced 1973 LP debut Crazy Life. Driven by the lead single \"People Gotta Move\" (number 21 pop in Canada, number 22 U.S.), 1974's Powerful People was Vannelli's first gold seller in his native country. That year, Vannelli toured with Stevie Wonder and became one of the first white acts on Soul Train, two years behind Dennis Coffey and months ahead of Elton John and David Bowie.\n\nThrough 1978, Vannelli continued to release ambitious and eclectic studio albums for A&M, all with extensive help from Joe Vannelli, and most with younger brother Ross, on an annual basis. With one exception, Storm at Sunup, The Gist of the Gemini, A Pauper in Paradise, and Brother to Brother each earned gold or platinum certifications in Canada. The last of those went platinum in Canada and the U.S. Altogether, these LPs spawned six charting singles highlighted by the Brother to Brother ballad \"I Just Wanna Stop,\" which sent Vannelli to the top of the Canadian pop chart (number four in the U.S.) and prompted another Soul Train visit. Moreover, \"I Just Wanna Stop\" was nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Pop Vocal Performance. Vannelli twice won the Juno Award for Best Male Artist during this run.\n\nVannelli moved to the Arista label and collected another gold disc with Nightwalker, a 1981 arrival featuring another big ballad, the number 13 hit (number six U.S.) \"Living Inside Myself.\" Vannelli and siblings Joe and Ross were Grammy-nominated together for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocals. Arista refused to release Vannelli's divergent follow-up, Twisted Heart, resulting in a protracted battle between the artist and label. After he was released from his contract, Vannelli returned in 1984 with Black Cars, issued on Polydor in Canada and CBS Associated in the States. Vannelli's eighth album, it produced the rocking number four Canadian hit title song, the number 14 ballad \"Hurts to Be in Love,\" and went platinum. Vannelli kept to a triennial release schedule with Big Dreamers Never Sleep in 1987 and Inconsolable Man in 1990. A hometown concert in 1990 was documented the next year with Live in Montreal.\n\nOpting to no longer concern himself with commercial demands, Vannelli retreated from the music industry for a few years before resurfacing during the latter half of the '90s. Yonder Tree and Slow Love, released on Verve Forecast respectively in 1995 and 1998, shifted Vannelli's focus to understated ballads with primarily acoustic backing. They were his first two albums to enter Billboard's jazz chart. He then dove headlong into another early and longstanding love, classical music. Among his contributions to pianist Niels Lan Doky's 2001 album was the Schubert-inspired piece \"Parole Per Mio Padre,\" which he subsequently performed for Pope John Paul. This led to a deal with BMG that resulted in Canto, a 2002 recording that reached Billboard's classical and classical crossover charts. Throughout the remainder of the decade, Vannelli revisited his back catalog and simultaneously looked forward. These Are the Days was split between new songs and a selection of hits dating back to the mid '70s. That 2005 release was followed four years later by A Good Thing, an album and poetry book facilitated by time spent in the Netherlands. Also in 2009, Vannelli revisited his back catalog with The Best and Beyond, which covered hits and deeper cuts alike, from \"I Just Wanna Stop\" to \"Wheels of Life,\" with support from musicians based in Vannelli's adoptive Oregon. The album was also bundled with Vannelli's 2010 memoir Stardust in the Sand.\n\nDuring the 2010s and into the next decade, Vannelli performed in a wide variety of settings that enabled him to continue showcasing his versatility and eagerness to keep moving forward. He also worked as a music educator. He released Live in LA in 2015, and followed it four years later by Wilderness Road, his first album of original material in over ten years. An expanded edition of A Good Thing, titled (More Of) A Good Thing, landed two years later. These three later works, all co-produced by Gino and Ross Vannelli, were issued by SoNo Recording Group."}, {"url": "https://www.last.fm/music/Gino+Vannelli/+wiki", "page_content": "Gino Vannelli (born 16 June 1952 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada) is a Canadian singer/songwriter of Italian ancestry.\n\nFrom a musical family, his father was a big band musician.

Once described as the \u201cYang to Bob Dylan\u2019s Yin, equaling him in richness and profusion of imagery,\u201d Mitchell, like her 1960s contemporary, turned pop music into an art form.\n\nMitchell studied commercial art in her native Alberta before moving to Toronto in 1964 and performing at local folk clubs and coffeehouses. After a brief marriage to folksinger Chuck Mitchell, she relocated to New York City, where in 1967 she made her eponymous debut album (also known as Songs to a Seagull). Produced by David Crosby, this concept album was acclaimed for the maturity of its lyrics.\n\nBritannica Quiz Who Said It? Women Musicians, Artists, and Writers\n\nWith each successive release, Mitchell gained a larger following, from Clouds (which in 1969 won a Grammy Award for best folk performance) to the mischievous euphoria of Ladies of the Canyon (1970) to Blue (1971), which was her first million-selling album. By the early 1970s Mitchell had branched out from her acoustic base to experiment with pop, rock, and jazz, notably on Court and Spark (1974), which ultimately became her best-selling album. The Hissing of Summer Lawns (1975) further indicated a transition to a more complex, layered sound. Whereas earlier albums were more confessional in their subject matter, The Hissing of Summer Lawns, on which she satirized the role of the 1970s housewife, showed Mitchell\u2019s movement toward social observation. Although she had a number of pop hits, especially in 1970 with \u201cBig Yellow Taxi\u201d and \u201cWoodstock\u201d (this song about the famous festival spawned three hit cover versions by other artists), Mitchell\u2019s impact was as a long-term \u201calbum artist.\u201d With its carefully precise yet improvisational feel, her music is at times difficult to listen to. She does not opt for straight melody or satisfying conclusions. \u201cMy music is not designed to grab instantly. It\u2019s designed to wear for a lifetime, to hold up like a fine cloth,\u201d she once said.\n\nWith Hejira (1976) and Don Juan\u2019s Reckless Daughter (1977), she continued to disregard commercial considerations, while Mingus (1979) was considered by many as beyond the pale. An album that began as a collaboration with the jazz bassist Charles Mingus ended up as a treatment of his themes after his death. Mitchell moved ever further beyond her own experience, delving not only deeper into jazz but also into Black history; the album was as much a voice for the dispossessed as it was a biography of Mingus. Though fans were confused, Mingus remains a brave homage that does not fit neatly into either the rock or jazz genre.\n\nHaving proved that she could make commercially successful albums and win critical acclaim, Mitchell became a prestige artist. Moreover, because her songs had become hits for others, she was a source of considerable publishing revenue for her record companies. As a result, they went along with her musical experiments. After Mingus, however, Mitchell stood back a little from the pop world. From the beginning of her career she had illustrated her own album covers, so it was not surprising that in the 1980s she began to develop her visual art, undecided about whether to concentrate more on painting or music.\n\nAlthough not as prolific as in the 1960s and \u201970s, Mitchell continued to create penetrating imaginative music, from the Thomas Dolby-produced Dog Eat Dog (1985) to the more reflective Night Ride Home (1991) and the Grammy Award-winning Turbulent Indigo (1994). Having dealt with international political and social issues such as Ethiopian famine on Dog Eat Dog, she returned by the early 1990s to more personal subject matter\u2014singing about true love, for instance, on Turbulent Indigo. Though unworried about pop chart trends, in 1997 she enjoyed major success with a new, younger audience when Janet Jackson sampled from Mitchell\u2019s \u201cBig Yellow Taxi\u201d for the massive hit \u201cGot \u2019Til It\u2019s Gone.\u201d In 1997 she published a new collection of her work, Joni Mitchell: The Complete Poems and Lyrics.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

She covered standards on Both Sides Now (2000) and reworked a wide-ranging selection of her oeuvre on Travelogue (2002). On Shine (2007), her first album recorded for the Starbucks coffee chain\u2019s music label, she returned to themes of environmental and social justice. Mitchell also issued several retrospective compilations, including The Beginning of Survival (2004), Dreamland (2004), Songs of a Prairie Girl (2005), and the 53-song omnibus Love Has Many Faces: A Quartet, A Ballet, Waiting to Be Danced (2014). Her continuing influence was shown by the release of the tribute album Joni 75: A Birthday Celebration (2019), on which such artists as Chaka Khan, Diana Krall, Rufus Wainwright, Norah Jones, James Taylor, and Emmylou Harris performed Mitchell\u2019s songs.\n\nOne of the first women in modern rock to achieve enviable longevity and critical recognition, Mitchell was a major inspiration to everyone from Bob Dylan and Prince to a later generation of female artists such as Suzanne Vega and Alanis Morissette. Although she regularly collaborated with producers and arrangers\u2014such as Jaco Pastorius, Mike Gibbs, and Larry Klein\u2014Mitchell maintained coproducer credit and always had control over her material. Her songs were covered by a range of stars, including Dylan, Fairport Convention, Judy Collins, Johnny Cash, and Crosby, Stills and Nash. Mitchell was awarded the Polar Music Prize by the Royal Swedish Academy of Music in 1996, and she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. In 2002 she won a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement, and two years later she was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. In 2021 Mitchell received a Kennedy Center Honor, and two years later she was named the recipient of the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song."}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/musicians/joni-mitchell", "page_content": "(1943-)\n\nWho Is Joni Mitchell?\n\nIn 1968, Joni Mitchell recorded her first, self-titled album. Other highly successful albums followed. Mitchell won her first Grammy Award (best folk performance) for her 1969 album, Clouds. She has won seven more Grammy Awards since then, in several different categories, including traditional pop, pop music and lifetime achievement.\n\nEarly Life and Music Career\n\nSinger-songwriter Joni Mitchell was born Roberta Joan Anderson on November 7, 1943, in Fort Macleod, Canada. At the age of 9, Mitchell contracted polio, and it was during her recovery in the hospital that she began performing and singing to patients. After teaching herself how to play the guitar, she went off to art college and quickly emerged as one of the leading folk performers of the late 1960s and '70s.\n\nAt the beginning of her career, Mitchell's compositions were highly original and personal in their lyrical imagery. It was this style that first attracted attention among folk-music audiences in Toronto while she was still in her teens. She moved to the United States in the mid-1960s, and in 1968, she recorded her first album, Joni Mitchell, produced by David Crosby.\n\nSongs and Albums\n\nOther highly successful albums followed. Joni Mitchell won her first Grammy Award (best folk performance) in 1969, for her sophomore album, Clouds. Her third album, Ladies of the Canyon, was a mainstream success for the folk singer, becoming her first gold album, which included the hits \"The Circle Game\" and \"Big Yellow Taxi.\" It was during this time she was already starting to experiment with pop and rock genres.\n\nHer album Court and Spark (1974) signaled her foray into jazz and jazz fusion and was lauded by critics; it ended up becoming her most commercially successful project to date and was nominated for four Grammy Awards, of which Mitchell won for best instrumental arrangement accompanying vocalist(s).\n\nOver the past four decades, Mitchell has garnered several Grammys in various categories, including traditional pop, pop music and lifetime achievement. Her other notable successful recordings include Blue (1971), The Hissing of Summer Lawns (1975), the highly experimental Hejira (1976) and Turbulent Indigo (1994).\n\nMitchell wasn\u2019t the only one making hits with the songs she wrote. Other musicians have recorded successful covers of her songs, including Judy Collins; the Counting Crows; and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.\n\nREAD MORE: The Heartbreak and Vulnerability Behind Joni Mitchell's Iconic 'Blue' Album\n\nLater Work\n\nMitchell's later albums include Taming the Tiger (1998), Both Sides Now (2000) and the compilation albums Dreamland (2004) and Songs of a Prairie Girl (2005). In addition to her own extensive body of work, she has been an enormous influence on several other artists with her unique guitar styling and expressive lyrics.\n\nMitchell was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nRetirement and Health Issues\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone in 2002, Mitchell announced she was retiring due to her frustration with the music industry, referring to it as a \"cesspool.\" However, she didn't adhere to her statement, as she became busier than ever with the release of various compilations consisting of her earlier works.\n\nIn 2007 she released Shine, her first album of new songs in almost a decade. Politically charged and environmentally conscious, the album was a Billboard success and was Mitchell's nineteenth and final studio album.\n\nBesides claiming her voice has faltered from complications due to polio and a compressed larynx, Mitchell then dealt with other health issues. She sought treatment for Morgellons disease, which is described as \u201can uncommon, unexplained skin disorder characterized by sores, crawling sensations on and under the skin, and fiber-like filaments emerging from the sores,\u201d according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nIn 2015, Mitchell experienced another health crisis. News broke in late March that the singer had been hospitalized. Some reports later indicated that she was in a coma, but a spokesperson for the singer corrected that error. Leslie Morris, a friend of Mitchell's, was appointed her conservator by a California judge in May.\n\nThat June, singer David Crosby claimed that Mitchell was unable to talk in an interview with the Huffington Post. Morris, through JoniMitchell.com, released a statement to clarify Mitchell's condition. She acknowledged that the singer had suffered an aneurysm, but was expected to make a \"full recovery.\" Morris also addressed Crosby's comment, saying that \"Joni is speaking, and she's speaking well. She is not walking yet, but she will be in the near future as she is undergoing daily therapies. She is resting comfortably in her own home and she's getting better each day.\"\n\nPersonal Life\n\nWhile an art student in college, Mitchell got pregnant and gave birth to Kelly Dale (renamed Kilauren) Anderson in 1965. The birth father refused to marry Mitchell, and she felt she had no choice but to give her daughter up for adoption. The adoptive parents renamed the baby girl Kilaruen Gibb. After keeping her daughter a secret and being separated from her for over 30 years, Mitchell reunited with her in 1997.\n\nA few weeks after giving birth to Kilaruen, Mitchell met American folk singer Chuck Mitchell and married him 36 hours after meeting him. The couple left for Michigan where they had an official ceremony in June 1965 and she took his last name. They divorced two years later.\n\nIn 1982, Mitchell married bassist Larry Klein, who worked on her album Wild Things Run Fast. Klein soon became an established music producer and worked on a number of Mitchell's albums throughout the late '80s and early '90s. While the couple worked on Turbulent Indigo, they eventually divorced in 1994. The following year Turbulent Indigo won a Grammy for best pop album.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Joni Mitchell\n\nBirth Year: 1943\n\nBirth date: November 7, 1943\n\nBirth City: Fort Macleod\n\nBirth Country: Canada\n\nGender: Female\n\nBest Known For: Singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, responsible for hits such as 'Both Sides Now' and 'Big Yellow Taxi,' is widely considered 1960s and '70s folk royalty.\n\nIndustries\n\nPop\n\nAstrological Sign: Scorpio\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: Joni Mitchell Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/musician/joni-mitchell\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E; Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: December 14, 2020\n\nOriginal Published Date: April 3, 2014\n\nQUOTES"}, {"url": "https://jonimitchell.com/", "page_content": "When Joni mesmerized the Newport Folk Festival audience last summer with a surprise performance, she 'breathed new meaning into some of her most famous lyrics' (New York Times).

That\u2019s what she does. Never in a hurry, it seems, she still manages to inhabit the persona of the ultimate troubadour.\n\nShe has been a muse for many \u2013 Graham Nash, James Taylor, Stephen Stills, Bob Dylan and Robert Plant spring to mind \u2013 but she doesn\u2019t owe them. Her key albums are dotted across six decades, from 1968\u2019s Song To A Seagull to 2007\u2019s Shine, which she said would be her last foray into a business with which she shares a love-hate relationship.\n\nIf so, she has gifted us enough classic songs: \u2018Chelsea Morning\u2019, \u2018Both Sides, Now\u2019, \u2018Big Yellow Taxi\u2019, \u2018You Turn Me On, I\u2019m A Radio\u2019, \u2018Free Man in Paris\u2019 \u2013 all tell a story, and Mitchell\u2019s narrative skills are as famous for their grace as the artist herself. Leaving Canada for New York \u2013 and, later, the West Coast \u2013 she developed from a coffeehouse hopeful into a musician who has worked with Jackson Browne, Stephen Stills, David Crosby, Larry Carlton, Willie Nelson, and the jazz giant who inform her later work, notably Herbie Hancock, Pat Metheny, Charles Mingus, and Weather Report\u2019s Wayne Shorter and Jaco Pastorius. Mitchell\u2019s albums have won her nine Grammy Awards, Companion Of The Order Of Canada and induction into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (she didn\u2019t attend). When she was given the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, in 2002, the citation pointed out she is \u201cone of the most important female recording artists of the rock era\u201d and \u201ca powerful influence on all artists who embrace diversity, imagination and integrity\u201d. She, however, describes herself as \u201ca painter derailed by circumstance\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRoberta Joan Anderson comes from Norwegian and Celtic stock but was born in Alberta, in 1943 \u2013 though she claimed Saskatoon as her hometown. Mixing passions for music and art, she dropped out of college to pursue a folk career. Seeing Buffy Sainte-Marie in 1964 convinced her to follow the folk path to Toronto, then Detroit, New York City and, eventually, California \u2013 travels that informed her first album, 1968\u2019s Song To A Seagull.\n\nProduced by David Crosby, the album made some surprising omissions of songs Mitchell had already written, notably \u2018Both Sides, Now\u2019 and \u2018Chelsea Morning\u2019 (hits for Judy Collins and Dave Van Ronk), \u2018The Circle Game\u2019 (Tom Rush) and \u2018Eastern Rain\u2019 (Fairport Convention). The following year\u2019s Clouds was a more assured affair, with Doors producer Paul A Rothchild at the board and Stephen Stills playing bass and guitar. This time the immaculate \u2018Both Sides, Now\u2019 and her paean to New York City, \u2018Chelsea Morning\u2019, were included, and helped develop a cult following that turned Joni into a star once Ladies Of The Canyon emerged. One of the most important albums of 1970, if only for \u2018Big Yellow Taxi\u2019 and \u2018Woodstock\u2019, this is where the rock and jazz crowd began to take notice.\n\n1971\u2019s Blue was the turning point. Ever-expanding her palette, Mitchell used an Appalachian dulcimer and was backed by Stills (again), James Taylor, \u201cSneaky Pete\u201d Kleinow and Russ Kunkel. This time around her lyrics became more personal and intense, and she experimented with alternative tuning \u2013 and detuning \u2013 on her acoustic as a means of forcing her vocals to fly into territory not usually associated with standard pop. The most poignant example is \u2018Little Green\u2019, about the daughter she gave up for adoption in 1965.\n\nThe following year\u2019s For The Roses gave Mitchell the first hit in \u2018You Turn Me On, I\u2019m A Radio\u2019, a backhanded allusion to a company request to write more commercial material, but it\u2019s \u2018See You Sometime\u2019 that nails the wars of love on the head. Elsewhere, love songs and social commentary abound.\n\nReleased in 1974, Court And Spark remain her most successful album. With Joni backed by The Crusaders, Robbie Robertson, Cheech And Chong, Wayne Perkins and Jose Feliciano, it elevated her to the status of a West Coast jazz-folk-pop goddess. \u2018Help Me\u2019, \u2018Free Man In Paris\u2019 and the meandering melodic structure of \u2018Down To You\u2019 stood out and helped the album go double platinum.\n\nThe live 2LP Miles Of Aisles was further evidence of her moving closer to jazz, performing live with Tom Scott and Robben Ford from LA Express, and then she went further out for The Hissing Of Summer Lawns, an album that has been compared to Blood On The Tracks for its importance, and been widely praised. Prince was such a fan of the album that he sent Mitchell love letters (and he would go on to reference \u2018Help Me\u2019 in \u2018The Ballad Of Dorothy Parker\u2019 and cover \u2018A Case Of You\u2019 many times on stage throughout his career). The masterpieces on \u2026 Summer Lawns are \u2018In France They Kiss On Main Street\u2019 and \u2018Shades Of Scarlett Conquering\u2019, but everything has a widescreen cinematic impact with resonations and ruminations on art, the drug world, the music business and the modern metropolis.\n\nHejira, featuring Jaco Pastorius, Larry Carlton and Neil Young, repeats the trick and includes the wry \u2018Coyote\u2019, on which Bob Dylan\u2019s 1975\u2019s Rolling Thunder Revue (which, for a brief moment, picked Mitchell up) gets a none-too-favourable mention.\n\nDon Juan\u2019s Reckless Daughter and Mingus are where Mitchell really parts company with the mainstream world of rock. While the former features JD Souther, Glenn Frey and Chaka Khan, it can\u2019t disguise Mitchell\u2019s diva status. Mingus, meanwhile, was a collaboration with the great composer and jazz musician, recorded shortly before his death. Taking on \u2018Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\u2019, \u2018A Chair In The Sky\u2019 and \u2018The Dry Cleaner From Des Moines\u2019, it sees Joni become something of a grande dame in waiting, but sales were better than expected.\n\nMoving to Geffen for her next four albums \u2013 Wild Things Run Fast, Dog Eat Dog, Chalk Mark In A Rain Storm and Night Ride Home \u2013 she worked up more pop-orientated material which featured her producer and soon-to-be-husband and producer Larry Klein. Nodding to the likes of Talking Heads, The Police and Steely Dan, Mitchell began to concentrate on her rhythm section but also hung with a different crowd. Guests in this era include Willie Nelson, Tom Petty and Peter Gabriel.\n\nReturning to Reprise for Turbulent Indigo (marked by its artwork, a self-portrait homage to Van Gogh), Mitchell\u2019s fortunes enjoyed an upturn which the compilations Hits And Misses capitalised upon. Though towards the end of the 90s she would start hinting at retirement, Taming The Tiger emerged in 1998 and Mitchell set out on a co-headlining tour with Dylan and Van Morrison. It reignited her love for performance and, in 2000, she released the ambitious concept disc Both Sides Now. Featuring orchestral reinterpretations of evergreen classics from Rube Bloom, Rodgers and Hart, Harold Arlen and Sidney Clare (\u2018You\u2019re My Thrill\u2019 set the standard), it won her two Grammy Awards and glowing praise.\n\nIn a similar vein, 2002\u2019s Travelogue reworked her catalogue to great effect and even includes a newly minted \u2018The Last Time I Saw Richard\u2019, a song which originally featured on Blue and was about her brief marriage to Richard Mitchell.\n\nA series of compilations of Mitchell\u2019s latter-day career \u2013 The Beginning Of Survival, Dreamland and Songs Of A Prairie Girl \u2013 coincided with an onset of bad health. In 2006, she announced that her next album, the following year\u2019s Shine, would be her last. She\u2019s in fine form on it, however, and the song \u2018One Week Last Summer\u2019 won her the 2008 Grammy Awards for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.\n\nIn 2015, Mitchell suffered a brain aneurysm but appears to be on the mend. Allaying fans\u2019 fears, her old friend, peer and ally Judy Collins, reported, \u201cJoni is walking, talking, painting some, doing much rehab every day.\u201d\n\nMany singer-songwriters have been said to have changed the music business, but few with the impact that Joni Mitchell has had. She\u2019s lived an epic life. The 4CD box set she compiled, Love Has Many Faces: A Quartet, A Ballet, Waiting To Be Danced, pays testimony to a remarkable person. Her hejira \u2013 her journey \u2013 is not yet over.\n\nMax Bell\n\nUK English Format:UK English"}, {"url": "https://www.cbc.ca/music/read/joni-mitchell-20-things-you-didn-t-know-about-one-of-canada-s-greatest-musicians-1.5060897", "page_content": "For over half a century, Joni Mitchell has stood out as one of the most distinctive voices in Canadian music, and one that Rolling Stone called \"one of the greatest songwriters ever.\"\n\nShe has been showered with honours and awards from Grammys to the Order of Canada to a spot in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and her songs have been covered by dozens of musicians, among them Sarah MacLachlan, Tori Amos, k.d. lang, Cee Lo Green and Herbie Hancock. In 2007, Canada Post even featured her on a postage stamp. To celebrate the one and only Joni, here are 20 things you might not know about the beloved Canadian musician.\n\n1. Joni Mitchell was born Roberta Joan Anderson in Fort Macleod, Alta., on Nov. 7, 1943. Her father was a former Royal Canadian Air Force officer who managed a grocery store; her mother was a school teacher. \"My mother was a romantic woman,\" Mitchell told the Washington Post in 1969. \"She raised me on Shakespeare as other parents quoted from the Bible. She encouraged me in old-fashioned things. I kept pressed-flower scrapbooks.\"\n\n2. Mitchell was particularly close to her maternal grandmother, Sadie McKee, and she dedicated her first album to McKee, whom Mitchell described as a lady who \"loved Robbie Burns and minor-key music and married a farmer who didn't understand.\"\n\n3. In 1951, when she was eight years old, Mitchell contracted polio during an epidemic in Canada \u2014 the same one that struck Neil Young. Mitchell was bedridden for weeks and faced the very real threat of having to live in an iron lung for the rest of her life.\n\n4. Mitchell later said it was during that winter in hospital that she became interested in singing. \"They said I might not walk again, and that I would not be able to go home for Christmas. I wouldn't go for it. So I started to sing Christmas carols and I used to sing them real loud.... The boy in the bed next to me, you know, used to complain. And I discovered I was a ham.\"\n\n5. From early on, Mitchell had a love of trains. As a child, growing up in what she called the \"two-block, one-church, one-hotel town\" of Maidstone, Sask., she would sit in bed and watch the morning train go by. \"The weird thing is that years later my parents met the conductor of that train at a party,\" remembered Mitchell in an interview. \"He said, 'All I remember of your town is a house with Christmas decorations and a kid that used to wave at me.'\"\n\n6. Mitchell's first paid gig was on Halloween night in 1962 at the Louis Riel coffee house at 725 Broadway Ave. in Saskatoon. She was just shy of her 19th birthday. The building is currently a restaurant called Calories.\n\n7. From a young age, Mitchell was interested in music. She took piano lessons for a few years and taught herself to play the guitar with the help of a Pete Seeger instruction book. She later studied commercial art at the Alberta College of Art and Design in Calgary, but became disillusioned by \"meaningless\" and \"not particularly creative\" courses, and left at the end of her first year to try her luck as a folk singer in Toronto. During the three-day trip from Calgary to Toronto on the Canadian Pacific Railroad, she wrote her first song, \"Day After Day\", a ballad set to the clacking of the train wheels.\n\n8. Mitchell couldn't afford the requisite membership in the musicians' union, so she worked as a salesgirl at a Toronto Simpsons\u2013Sears department store until she scraped together enough for the $140 entrance fee. She eventually started singing at small folk clubs such as the Riverboat in Yorkville, then a bohemian neighbourhood.\n\n9. In fall of 1964, Mitchell became pregnant by her ex-boyfriend Brad MacMath, and was forced to give her daughter up for adoption because she was too poor to raise her. Writing about her song, \"Moon at the Window\", Mitchell said, \"My daughter's father left me three months pregnant in an attic room with no money and winter coming on and only a fireplace for heat. The spindles of the banister were gap-toothed fuel for last winter's occupants. He left behind a doodle of a pregnant woman seated at a window, looking at a crescent moon and on it he wrote, 'The thief left it behind, the moon at the window.' The song, other than this Zen saying, has nothing to do with that incident.\"\n\n10. In 1967, Jimi Hendrix attended one of Mitchell's concerts at Le Hibou in Ottawa after playing a concert at the Capitol Theatre. With Mitchell's permission, Hendrix recorded her performance. Unfortunately, both Jimi's recorder and the tapes were stolen several days later.\n\n11. Mitchell got her name when she married Chuck Mitchell, a singer and cabaret performer from Detroit who was another regular on the Toronto folk circuit. They married in June, 1965, reportedly just 36 hours after they met. The pair moved to Detroit, where they often performed together.\n\n12. After a year, the marriage ended, and Joni Mitchell moved to New York, where she continued her career as a solo artist. She later said she did not plan to remarry. \"I feel like I'm married to this guy named Art,\" she said in an interview. \"I'm responsible to my Art above all else ... my family consists of pieces of work that go out into the world. Instead of hanging around for nineteen years they leave the nest early.\"\n\n13. And while Mitchell's primary love was art, she did find romance with other high-profile musicians, among them David Crosby, James Taylor, Graham Nash, Leonard Cohen and Jackson Browne. \"The rock 'n' roll industry is very incestuous,\" she told MacLean's. \"We have all been close at one time or another, and I think that a lot of beautiful music came from it. A lot of beautiful times came from it, too, through that mutual understanding. A lot of pain, too, because, inevitably, different relationships broke up.\"\n\n14. A lifelong collaborator, Mitchell has performed and recorded with a host of artists \u2014 but not all of them made the cut. Recounting the recording of her song \"Ladies Man\", Mitchell said, \"I invited Don Henley to come and sing with me on this one. After he left, when I was playing it back, I was amazed at how similar our voices sounded. It took a while to even notice that a new singer had been introduced. So I went across the hall to where Lionel Richie was recording and I conscripted him. There was the contrast I wanted, so I replaced Don with Lionel. The old cutting room floor routine.\"\n\n15. Mitchell's musical styles and themes have shifted dramatically over time. As she told the LA Times, \"My first four albums covered the usual youth problems \u2014 looking for love in all the wrong places \u2014 while the next five are basically about being in your 30s. Things start losing their profundity; in middle-late age, you enter a tragedian period, realizing that the human animal isn't changing for the better. In a way, I think I entered straight into my tragedian period, as my work is set against the stupid, destructive way we live on this planet. Americans have decided to be stupid and shallow since 1980. Madonna is like Nero; she marks the turning point.\"\n\n16. Although she has always been best known for her music, Mitchell is also a gifted visual artist, and many of her works were featured on her album covers. \"All through this,\" she told the Globe and Mail, \"I have always thought of myself as a painter derailed by circumstance.\"\n\n17. In 2002, Mitchell was appointed a companion of the Order of Canada. \"It's a beautiful award,\" she later told Reader's Digest. \"But my two highest honours came from black people. In the green room at the Grammys, the door flew open and in came this black girl. She threw her arms out at said, 'Girl, you make me see pictures in my head. Give me a hug.' Now that's an honour. The other one was a blind black piano player named Henry Butler who said to me, 'You make raceless, genderless music.'\"\n\nJoni Mitchell is appointed the Order of Canada. (Chris Wattie/Reuters)\n\n18. Mitchell has never been shy about expressing her opinions about politics, religion and even fellow musicians. In a particularly outspoken interview with the LA Times in 2010, Mitchell stirred controversy with some unexpected remarks about artists from Madonna to Bob Dylan. \"Bob is not authentic at all,\" she said. \"He's a plagiarist, and his name and voice are fake. Everything about Bob is a deception.\"\n\n19. Mitchell released her last album of original material, Shine, in 2007, and quit touring. The album entered the charts at number 14, the highest position since Hejira, which she had released 30 years earlier.\n\n20. When asked in an interview how she could retire from something that was such a primary part of her life, Mitchell replied, \"Easy. It's just like a wind that blew through me, that stopped blowing. It's gone.\""}, {"url": "https://www.thisisdig.com/feature/joni-mitchell-songwriter-life-and-legacy/", "page_content": "If you\u2019d seen Joni Mitchell in the early 60s, playing in small coffeehouses and nightclubs in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, you may have assumed she was one of many other wannabe folk singers, with her delicate voice and gentle guitar numbers. Would it have been possible to imagine just how rich and varied a career she would have as a songwriter?\n\nCertainly, there were some people present in the early years who recognised the promise Roberta Joan Anderson had \u2013 not least other folk musicians \u2013 including Judy Collins, Fairport Convention and Tom Rush \u2013 who heard her self-penned songs, including Chelsea Morning, The Circle Game and Both Sides, Now, and knew the value of what they heard. Mitchell\u2019s songwriting talent alone would draw intrigue, and lead to her signing to Reprise for her debut album, Song To A Seagull.\n\nA love for words: setting the bar\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a perfect start. The album, produced by The Byrds\u2019 David Crosby, suffered from tape hiss, the poor audio quality underselling Joni\u2019s talent and taking some of the shine off the pearls within. Reprise didn\u2019t realise that the birds on the album cover spelt out the title, Song To A Seagull, and cut the sleeves too small, leaving first pressings reading \u201cSon To A Seagu\u201d.\n\nStill, it didn\u2019t Joni hold back. The beautiful sleeve design \u2013 one of the best 60s album covers \u2013 would set the bar for all Mitchell\u2019s subsequent records. And if there\u2019s one thing fans should note, it\u2019s the credit she gives on the album to her English teacher: \u201c\u2026 dedicated to Mr Kratzmen, who taught me to love words\u201d. Because by 1968, we had barely seen Joni\u2019s love of words.\n\nLady of the canyon: a flourishing songwriter\n\nWith a work ethic like no other, Joni Mitchell managed to find the words for almost an album a year from the late 60s and throughout the 70s, her songwriting flourishing across 1969\u2019s Clouds and 1970\u2019s Ladies Of The Canyon \u2013 the latter of which brought about some of Mitchell\u2019s first great songs, including Rainy Night House, Ladies Of The Canyon and Morning Morgantown, as well as Big Yellow Taxi."}, {"url": "https://www.thisdayinmusic.com/artists/joni-mitchell/", "page_content": "Photo: Joel Bernstein\n\nJoni Mitchell, (Roberta Anderson), was born on 7th Nov, 1943. Mitchell is one of the most important and influential female recording artists of the late 20th century. Ask any female singer from Tori Amos, to Sheryl Crow and newbies like Adel who their favorite female singer songwriter is and all will say Joni. Led Zeppelin sang about her in \u201cGoing To California\u201d so did Prince in \u201cThe Ballad Of Dorothy Parker\u201d. Even Madonna cited Mitchell as the first female artist that really spoke to her as a teenager.\n\nPlenty have covered her songs, some better than others, and here\u2019s why so many fail \u2013 she plays the guitar and sings like no other artist, so to \u2018cover\u2019 a Joni song and do it justice is a difficult task. Judy Collins\u2019s 1967 recording of \u201cBoth Sides Now\u201d became a top 10 hit, Matthews Southern Comfort did a great job with their version of \u201cWoodstock\u201d, Counting Crows succeeded with their version of \u201cBig Yellow Taxi\u201d, but many have failed.\n\nJoni Mitchell is Neil Young playing folk music on weird guitar tunings who got drunk at a jazz club. And like her fellow countryman Young, Joni has played it her way, never looking for hit records (she\u2019s only ever had one US top 10 hit). Her early albums have become timeless classics; just listen to Ladies Of The Canyon, Blue and Court And Spark.\n\nSo, what do we know about Joni? She was stricken with polio at the age of eight and while recovering in a children\u2019s hospital, she began her performing career by singing to the other patients. She later taught herself to play guitar with the aid of a Pete Seeger instruction book, she went off to art college, and became a fixture on the folk music scene around Alberta, Canada. After relocating to Toronto, she married folksinger Chuck Mitchell in 1965, and began performing under the name Joni Mitchell.\n\nAfter performing in Coffee Houses and clubs in Ontario, Joni spread her wings and ventured south. One night when she was performing at a club in Coconut Grove, Florida, David Crosby walked in and was immediately struck by her ability and her appeal as an artist. He took her back to Los Angeles, where he set about introducing her and her music to his friends. Crosby convinced a record company to agree to let Mitchell record a solo acoustic album without all the folk-rock overdubs that were in vogue at the time, and his clout earned him a producer\u2019s credit in March 1968, when Reprise Records released her debut album, alternately known as Joni Mitchell or Song To A Seagull.\n\nMitchell announced in October 2002 that she had made her last ever record; she\u2019d grown tired of the industry. She told W magazine that she intended to retire. She also claimed she would never sign another corporate label deal and in Rolling Stone magazine blasted the recording industry for being \u201ca cesspool.\u201d\n\nShe has received eight Grammy Awards during her career, with the first coming in 1969 and the most recent in 2008. She received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002, with the citation describing her as \u201cone of the most important female recording artists of the rock era\u201d and \u201ca powerful influence on all artists who embrace diversity, imagination and integrity.\u201d\n\nOn March 31, 2015, Joni Mitchell was found unconscious in her Los Angeles home. She regained consciousness in an ambulance on her way to hospital, but was taken to intensive care for tests. On May 29, 2015, it was confirmed that Mitchell had suffered a brain aneurysm and that while speech was difficult, Mitchell had been communicating with others.\n\nSince 2015 Mitchell has made several recent public appearances as she recovers, according to some reports she is still learning to walk again, and she has not spoken in public. She appeared on stage on 7 November 2018 at the conclusion of Joni 75, a benefit performance in honor of her birthday at LA\u2019s flagship performing arts destination, the Music Center."}, {"url": "https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/joni-mitchell-her-art-and-life-in-33-songs/", "page_content": "Joni Mitchell Shifts the Weather\n\nWhen Joni Mitchell first appears in Martin Scorsese\u2019s 1976 concert film The Last Waltz, she\u2019s in silhouette offstage, adding vocals to Neil Young\u2019s \u201cHelpless.\u201d Young stands in the spotlight with the Band\u2019s Robbie Robertson and Rick Danko; grinning like fools, they look like they\u2019re in on some off-topic joke. Mitchell, on the other hand, is serious, listening intently. Her features are obscured in shadow, the clean lines of her long neck and strong chin reinforcing the posture that always makes her seem to be bound skyward, like an egret.\n\nLike Young, Mitchell grew up in a chilly part of Canada, and the stark dreaminess of \u201cHelpless,\u201d its evocation of a place where creativity grows from lonely ground, is hers, too. When Mitchell enters the song with her high, nearly wild yet perfectly modulated wail, it doesn\u2019t blend; instead, her voice hits the others like a weather event, an intangible and irresistible current. Kept out of the spotlight, she still claims it\u2014yet she also charts her own path, beyond anyone else\u2019s grasp.\n\nI often think about this moment when trying to comprehend Mitchell\u2019s central, singular role in rock\u2019s evolution. When she began her career in the mid-1960s as part of the folk revival, rock was a game dominated by roguish white boys competing with each other for girls, glamour, and, eventually, social significance. Leading a new cohort of more openly poetic and introspective peers\u2014Young, James Taylor, Jackson Browne, Carole King\u2014Mitchell turned rock into an adult pursuit, and folk into a personal one. From breakthrough ballads like \u201cBoth Sides, Now\u201d to irreducible epics like \u201cCoyote\u201d and \u201cPaprika Plains,\u201d she showed that songs in the rock and soul era could be both deeply idiosyncratic and vastly observational. They could move through blues tunings, jazz changes, Latin and African rhythms, torch-song intimacies, and prophetic declarations.\n\nMitchell is a painter, and she creates in shades and planes of perception; she is a cinematic thinker perfecting every detail in her mise en sc\u00e8ne. In the 1970s, when she defined the singer-songwriter position, plenty of people were mining their love affairs for lyrics, or trying new guitar tunings, or blending plain conversation with high-flying metaphor; they might\u2019ve also been thinking, however casually, about how their songs might add up to something bigger than just radio jingles. But no one\u2014except, perhaps, in nearby worlds, Nina Simone or Stevie Wonder or David Bowie\u2014did all of these things with such depth and commitment and inventiveness."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Joni_Mitchell", "page_content": "Roberta Joan \"Joni\" Mitchell (n\u00e9e Anderson; born November 7, 1943) is a Canadian-American musician, producer, and painter. As one of the most influential singer-songwriters to emerge from the 1960s folk music circuit, Mitchell became known for her starkly personal lyrics and unconventional compositions which grew to incorporate pop and jazz elements.[1] She has received many accolades, including ten Grammy Awards and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. Rolling Stone called her \"one of the greatest songwriters ever\",[2] and AllMusic has stated, \"When the dust settles, Joni Mitchell may stand as the most important and influential female recording artist of the late 20th century\".[1]\n\nCanadian-American singer-songwriter (born 1943)\n\nQuick facts: Joni Mitchell CC, Born, Other names, Cit... \u25bc\n\nMitchell began singing in small nightclubs in Saskatoon and throughout western Canada, before moving on to the nightclubs of Toronto. She moved to the United States and began touring in 1965. Some of her original songs (\"Urge for Going\", \"Chelsea Morning\", \"Both Sides, Now\", \"The Circle Game\") were recorded by other folk singers, allowing her to sign with Reprise Records and record her debut album, Song to a Seagull, in 1968.[3] Settling in Southern California, Mitchell helped define an era and a generation with popular songs like \"Big Yellow Taxi\" and \"Woodstock\". Her 1971 album Blue is often cited as one of the best albums of all time; it was rated the 30th best album ever made in Rolling Stone's 2003 list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\",[4] rising to number 3 in the 2020 edition.[5] In 2000, The New York Times chose Blue as one of the 25 albums that represented \"turning points and pinnacles in 20th-century popular music\".[6] NPR ranked Blue number 1 on a 2017 list of Greatest Albums Made By Women.[7]\n\nMitchell began exploring more jazz-influenced ideas on 1974's Court and Spark, which featured the radio hits \"Help Me\" and \"Free Man in Paris\"[8] and became her best-selling album. Mitchell's vocal range began to shift from mezzo-soprano to that of a wide-ranging contralto around 1975.[9][10][11] Her distinctive piano and open-tuned guitar compositions also grew more harmonically and rhythmically complex as she melded jazz with rock and roll, R&B, classical music and non-Western beats. Starting in the mid-1970s, she began working with noted jazz musicians including Jaco Pastorius, Tom Scott, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, and Pat Metheny as well as Charles Mingus, who asked her to collaborate on his final recordings.[12] She later turned to pop and electronic music and engaged in political protest. She was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards in 2002.[13]\n\nMitchell produced or co-produced most of her albums and designed most of her own album covers, describing herself as a \"painter derailed by circumstance\".[14] A critic of the music industry, she quit touring and released her 17th and last album of original songs in 2007. She would give occasional interviews and make appearances to speak on various causes over the next two decades, though the rupture of a brain aneurysm in 2015 led to a long period of recovery and therapy. A series of retrospective compilations were released over the time period, culminating in the Joni Mitchell Archives, a project to publish much of Joni's unreleased material from her long career. She returned to public appearances in 2021, accepting several awards in person, including a Kennedy Center Honor in 2021.[15] She performed live for the first time in 9 years, with an unannounced appearance at the June 2022 Newport Folk Festival, and is scheduled to perform a headline show on June 10, 2023."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/joni-mitchell", "page_content": "Singer, songwriter, guitarist\n\nStruck Down by Polio\n\nBanging on Stardom\u2019s Door\n\nRecognition in the 1990s\n\nPolio Returns\n\nSelected discography\n\nSources\n\nThe pop arena is a harsh world, really, \u201cmused Joni Mitchell in an interview with Nicholas Jennings for Maclean\u2019s. \u201d It moves you up and down arbitrarily, regardless of the quality of your work. \u201cMitchell\u2019s comments reflect the sometimes bittersweet nature of her long and varied musical career. Hailed by the New Rolling Stone Record Guide as\u201d the most significant of the confessional singer/songwriters\u201dafter the release of her first few albums, Mitchell saw her critical and popular audience trickle away during the mid-1970s and 1980s. Yet by the mid-1990s she had come full circle, boosted by the strength of two new albums and a critical reevaluation of much of her \u201970s output.\n\nMitchell was born Roberta Joan Anderson on November 7, 1943, in a remote town on the cold, windswept plains of northwestern Canada. The artist remembers where her family lived in the hardscrabble hamlets of Alberta, bereft of creature comforts. \u201cEvery house was weathered-out and derelict-looking with no paint on it,\u201d she told Billboard contributor Timothy White. \u201cDrinking water was delivered, and bathing water was captured off the eaves of the houses. The only recreation I had was waving from our living-room picture window in Maidstone to the steam locomotive that blew its whistle at the bend in the track as it entered town\u2014but at least that gave me a curiosity about going places.\u201d\n\nMitchell\u2019s childhood, though, was a troubled one, for she was beset by a series of ailments that battered her small body. \u201cAt three my appendix burst, and they rushed me to the hospital,\u201d she told White. \u201cThen I had German measles and red measles, one of which nearly killed me. At eight I had chicken pox and scarlet fever, plus the arbitrary tonsillitis.\u201d The darkest shadowthatfell over her childhood, though, was polio, and as she indicated to Vogue writer Charles Gandee in 1995, the specter of that disease continues to haunt her. \u201cI had polio at the age of nine. My spine was twisted up like a train wreck. I couldn\u2019t walk. I was paralyzed. Forty years later it comes back with a vengeance. It\u2019s like multiple sclerosis. It means your electrical system burns out and your muscles begin to atrophy. It means impending paraplegia.\u201d\n\nAfter an excruciatingly painful recovery, Mitchell attended high school. Her mediocre academic performance was offset to some degree by her blossoming passion for music, painting, and art. \u201cI was always the school artist,\u201d she told People contributor Michael Small. \u201cI did the backdrops for plays [and] illustrated the yearbook and the school newspaper.\u201d After graduating from high school, she enrolled at the Alberta College of Art in\n\nFor the Record \u2026\n\nBorn Roberta Joan Anderson, November 7, 1943, in Fort Macleod, Alberta, Canada; daughter of William A. (a grocery store manager) and Myrtle M. (a teacher; maiden name, McKee) Anderson; married Chuck Mitchell (a musician), June 1965 (divorced c. 1967); married Larry Klein (a musician and producer), 1982 (divorced 1992); children: one daughter. Education: Attended Alberta College of Art, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nWorked as a singer in folk clubs while living in Toronto, Detroit, and New York City, 1964-69; released first album, Joni Mitchell, 1968; first chart single, \u201cBig Yellow Taxi,\u201d released in 1970 on Ladies of the Canyon; released Blue, 1971; turned increasingly to jazz-influenced work, late 1970s; returned to public performance after six years, 1994.\n\nSelected awards Grammy Award for best folk performance, 1970, for Clouds; two Grammy Awards (including best pop album), 1995, for Turbulent Indigo; Orville H.

She left Calgary a year later and headed east, eventually landing in Toronto. Shortly after Mitchell made her first tentative appearances on the city\u2019s fledgling folk music circuit, an unplanned pregnancy proved to be a jarring interruption in her life. \u201cI was twenty,\u201d she told White, \u201cand it was a crush with a fellow painter, and I got pregnant immediately. To be pregnant and unmarried in 1964 was like you killed somebody.\u201d She subsequently met Chuck Mitchell, an older folksinger, who said he would \u201ctake us on,\u201d she said in her interview with Gandee. \u201cI was kind of railroaded\u2026. We were never suitable. I went down the aisle saying, \u2018I can get out of this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe couple, who married a month after they met, subsequently took up residence in Detroit, but the marriage disintegrated within about two years. Emotionally drained and financially bare, Mitchell also gave up her daughter for adoption. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the child since, although I\u2019ve always thought of her,\u201d she later told White. \u201cFor years I didn\u2019t talk about this because of my parents, although I did leak little things, little messages into my songs for the child, just to let her know I was thinking about her.\u201d\n\nMitchell moved to Manhattan, where she threw herself into establishing a place on the local music scene. Her reputation grew, but work was still sometimes elusive. \u201cThe year Dylan went electric (1965) the folk clubs started closing all over the country,\u201d she told Susan Gordon Lydon in the New York Times. \u201cIt was like an epidemic.\u2026In those days, if you only played acoustical guitar, club owners treated you as though you were a dinosaur.\u201d\n\nShe persevered, though, and with the help of Byrds vocalist David Crosby she eventually signed with Reprise Records. Her debut album, 1968\u2019s Joni Mitchell, was produced by Crosby, although Mitchell concedes that his influence was actually fairly minimal. The album, a simple affair that featured Mitchell\u2019s soaring singing voice and skillful acoustic guitar work, garnered immediate attention. Clouds, her second album, explored the same terrain as her first work: romanticism, emotional confusion, and other affairs of the heart.\n\n\u201cA major impetus for Mitchell\u2019s work at this time,\u201d contended Dave Laing and Phil Hardy in the Encyclopedia of Rock, \u201cwas the struggle to make sense of a personal failure to find lasting satisfaction in any of her well-publicized relationships.\u201d Mitchell\u2019s 1970 release, Ladies of the Canyon, showed that she was continuing to develop musically. While her daring vocals and crisp acoustic guitar playing continued to anchor her sound, additional instrumentation effectively complemented several of the album\u2019s songs.\n\nWith 1971\u2019s Blue, Mitchell\u2019s already shining critical reputation took another giant step forward. The album featured such classics as \u201cThe Last Time I Saw Richard,\u201d \u201cCalifornia,\u201d \u201cThis Flight Tonight,\u201d and the title track, and stunned reviewers marveled at the honesty, longing, and intelligence that underpinned the entire effort. Rolling Stone reviewer Timothy Crouse wrote that on Blue, Mitchell has \u201cmatched her popular music skills with the purity and honesty of what was once called folk music and through the blend she has given us some of the most beautiful moments in recent popular music.\u201d White later commented that \u201cthe resoundingly intimate Blue stretched the tape measure for unfathomed personal inquiry until it snapped free of the spool. The deeper Mitchell delved, the higher her untethered singing flew, trembling with tortured liberty.\u201d\n\nThe subject matter of Mitchell\u2019s songs, though\u2014and their inevitable coupling to her romantic relationships with such well-known artists as Jackson Browne, James Taylor, and Graham Nash\u2014led some magazines to pay greater attention to her personal life than her musical output. Mitchell began to explore different musical directions and less introspective subjects for her songs, only to find her visibility in the entertainment world slowly ebb away. Albums such as For the Roses (197\u20192), which featured the hit \u201cTurn Me On, I\u2019m a Radio\u201d ; Court and Spark (1974), which included \u201cHelp Me\u201d and \u201cFree Man in Paris\u201d ; and Hejira (1976) received hearty words of appreciation, but others were treated less kindly. Rolling Stone even called Mitchell\u2019s 1975 release, The Hissing of Summer Lawns, the worst record of the year.\n\nBold and creative experiments, such as her tribute to dying jazz great Charles Mingus on Mingus (1979), met with indifference or critical barbs from many quarters, and by the early 1980s Mitchell\u2019s popularity had fallen significantly. \u201cI lost some people when I went from singing / to singing you. I lost some people when I added a band,\u201d she explained to Gandee. \u201cAnother thing was that in the eighties we moved into a particularly unromantic period in music. Videos had just begun, and they had a tendency to feature cold women with dark lipstick and stilettos grinding men\u2019s hands into the ground. It was an antilove period, and my work\u2014Wild Things Run Fast, in particular\u2014was a joyous celebration of love, which basically made people sick.\u201d Ironically, though, her fading in the public eye served to liberate Mitchell. \u201cOnce I realized that I had fallen from favor, I decided to stretch out\u2026. I can\u2019t pander to public opinion. Besides, the fact is no matter how talented you are, you fall out of favor.\u201d Indeed, Mitchell never appeared to question the value of her output; as she told Gandee, Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen are \u201cmy real peers. We\u2019re the poets of that generation.\u201d\n\nIn 1982 Mitchell married record producer Larry Klein, and over the course of the decade she released three fine albums on Geffen Records\u2014 Wild Things Run Fast, Dog Eat Dog, and Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm\u2014 that were largely ignored. Undeterred by the tepid reception of each album, Mitchell continued to explore new musical avenues while also indulging her lifelong passion for painting. (A number of Mitchell\u2019s albums feature her own artwork on covers or inner sleeves.) Night Ride Home, Mitchell\u2019s 1991 release, received warm reviews. The album seemed to spark a slow stir in the music community as some people questioned the songwriter\u2019s long exile in the musical wilderness. Three years later, Mitchell unveiled Turbulent Indigo, the seventeenth album in her long and varied career. Entertainment Weekly contributor Linda Sanders echoed the sentiments of many when she called the album \u201cthe distilled essence of everything she\u2019s done before.\u201d As critics raved about the musical and lyrical depth of the album, Mitchell assumed a visibility in the industry she had not seen since the mid-1970s.\n\nIn retrospect, critics returned to Mitchell\u2019s earlier albums, and some began to give greater thought to her place in pop music history. Sanders, for example, conceded that \u201call she\u2019s really managed to deliver in the course of sixteen albums is one of the most vivid and delicious chronicles of a woman\u2019s life that\u2019s ever been produced in any medium anytime, anyplace.\u201d In Guitar Player, Martin Simpson called her \u201cperhaps the most influential female guitarist of the century,\u201d and a huge influx of young female singer/songwriters cited the impact of Mitchell\u2019s music on their lives. When asked about many of these artists, though, Mitchell is blunt. \u201cThere are dozens of them, but I don\u2019t hear much there, frankly,\u201d she remarked to Simpson. \u201cWhen it comes to knowing where to put the chords, how to tell a story, and how to build to a chorus, most of them can\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\nThe early 1990s were transitional years for Mitchell in many ways. While recognition of her talent ascended once again, her personal life was rocked by several blows. She divorced Klein in 1992, though she noted in her interview with Gandee that their relationship endures, albeit in a different form. \u201cWe\u2019ve come through this thing. It\u2019s poignant sometimes. We went out the other night. He was playing with Shawn Colvin, and they invited me to come down and sit in. You have to readjust. I imagine that it will be a lifetime friendship.\u201d\n\nMitchell\u2019s childhood bout with polio also returned to haunt her. She admitted to White in 1995 that she suffers from post-polio syndrome, a malady wherein \u201cthe wiring in my central nervous system is overtaxed, and when I don\u2019t conserve my energy, the disease manifests itself in loss of animation. Last year and the year before I was experiencing a lot of muscle aches, joint aches, and extreme sensitivity to temperature changes.\u201d\n\nDespite her physical difficulties, however, Mitchell has launched a cautious return to concert performing. In 1994 she performed at the Edmonton Folk Festival, playing her first full-length set in six years before an appreciative audience of fans and relatives. \u201cIt had a homecoming kind of feeling,\u201d remarked Mitchell in Guitar Player. She has turned to a variety of medical treatments to stave off her illness, and she remained defiant about her chances in the mid-1990s. \u201cThe polio survivor is a stubborn creature. I\u2019m in good spirits, and high spirits is how I beat it before,\u201d she told Gandee.\n\nIn the mid-1990s Mitchell received several notable awards, further indication that she had come full circle in the eyes of the music community. She won two Grammys (including one for best pop album) for Turbulent Indigo and the 1996 Royal Swedish Academy of Music\u2019s Polar Music Prize. Late in 1995, Mitchell was named the recipient of Billboard magazine\u2019s Century Award. The magazine cited Mitchell as particularly deserving of the honor, a sentiment echoed by award presenter Peter Gabriel. In his introduction of Mitchell during the award ceremony, Gabriel noted: \u201cThis writer\u2019s work has been a regular inspiration\u2026. With her melodies, harmonies, guitar tunings, lyrics, extraordinary voice, and arrangements, she has continuously and courageously experimented, putting substance before style, passion before packaging, and all the time creating wonderful pictures with her songs\u2026. When I think of her music, I think of imagination, invention, intelligence, and most important, a lot of soul.\u201d\n\nJoni Mitchell, Reprise, 1968.\n\nClouds, Reprise, 1969.\n\nLadies of the Canyon, Reprise, 1970.\n\nBlue, Reprise, 1971.\n\nFor the Roses, Asylum, 1972.\n\nCourt and Spark, Asylum, 1974.\n\nMiles of Aisles, Asylum, 1974.\n\nThe Hissing of Summer Lawns, Asylum, 1975.\n\nHejira, Asylum, 1976.\n\nDon Juan\u2019s Reckless Daughter, Asylum, 1977.\n\nMingus, Asylum, 1979.\n\nShadows and Light, Asylum, 1980.\n\nWild Things Run Fast, Geffen, 1982.\n\nDog Eat Dog, Geffen, 1985.\n\nChalk Mark in a Rain Storm, Geffen, 1988.\n\nNight Ride Home, Geffen, 1991.\n\nTurbulent Indigo, Reprise, 1994.\n\nHits, Reprise, 1996.\n\nMisses, Reprise, 1996.\n\nBooks\n\nHardy, Phil, and Dave Laing, Encyclopedia of Rock, Schirmer Books, 1988.\n\nMarsh, Dave, and John Swenson, New Rolling Stone Record Guide, Random House, 1983.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nBillboard, December 9, 1995; December 16, 1995.\n\nEntertainment Weekly, March 1, 1991.\n\nGuitar Player, February 1995, p. 55.\n\nMaclean\u2019s, June 1974; October 31, 1994.\n\nNew York Times, April 20, 1969; November 7, 1982.\n\nPeople, December 16, 1985.\n\nRecord World, March 6, 1976.\n\nRolling Stone, August 5, 1971; October 15, 1992; December 15, 1994.\n\nTime, November 28, 1994.\n\nVogue, April 1995, p. 191.\n\n\u2014Kevin Hillstrom"}], "Chaka Khan is a music artist.": [{"url": "https://www.biography.com/musicians/chaka-khan", "page_content": "(1953-)\n\nWho Is Chaka Khan?\n\nBorn on March 23, 1953, in Great Lakes, Illinois, singer Chaka Khan achieved great success as part of the soul-funk band Rufus, delivering hits like \"Tell Me Something Good,\" \"Sweet Thing\" and \"Hollywood.\" She embarked on a solo career in the late '70s and made waves on the charts again with tunes like \"I'm Every Woman,\" \"I Feel for You,\" \"This Is My Night\" and \"Through the Fire.\" A phenomenal vocalist, Khan has won numerous Grammy Awards.\n\nEarly Singing Career\n\nChaka Khan was born Yvette Marie Stevens on March 23, 1953, in Chicago, Illinois.

While her style is rooted in R&B, she has explored a number of different genres throughout her career.\n\nSince her debut album released back in 1978, Chaka Khan has experimented with jazz and funk elements along with soulful vocals. Her sound was further shaped by the 1980s when dance-pop production started to take hold. She embraced this new approach as well as emerging technologies such as synthesizers and drum machines.

The song peaked at number-one on Billboard\u2019s Hot Soul Singles Chart that year and also earned Chaka a Grammy nomination for Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Female Artist.\n\nChaka Kahn\u2019s influence can still be felt today in modern music as many artists have covered her hit single including Whitney Houston and Christina Aguilera. Both versions were released to critical acclaim and reached the top 10 of Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart; however neither could match up to Chaka Khan original version which is often regarded as the definitive version of this classic track.\n\nSince its release, \u201cI\u2019m Every Woman\u201d continues to serve as an inspiration for female singers everywhere who want to make empowering statements through their lyrics.

It performed on CBC TV in the children's show 'Canadian Brass' (29 Mar 1976), the special 'Brass-A-Ma-Tazz' (28 Nov 1976), and the popular children's program 'Sesame Street' (1979), and it also appeared on 'The Muppet Show,' 'The Tonight Show,' and in other TV specials of its own. In the summer of 1976 it opened the Jeunesses Musicales of Canada Orford Art Centre festival.\n\n1978-86\n\nFor its Toronto Symphony debut in 1978, Canadian Brass performed Gary Kulesha's transcription of Handel's Organ Concerto in F, Opus 4, no. 4. For its New York debut, 6 Feb 1979 at the Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, it premiered Flashbacks by Michael Colgrass. On other occasions it premiered works written for it by Peter Schickele (Hornsmoke, 1976; Five of a Kind, 1979). In 1976 it gave a performance before the Governor General at Rideau Hall, Ottawa. In the summer of 1980 it made its first appearances at the Edinburgh Festival. In the course of the 1980s Canadian Brass toured Japan (1980, 1982) and Europe (1985), toured throughout North America (including Alaska) and in Australia, and became the first Canadian ensemble to perform in Saudi Arabia. In 1982 it began to perform in Christmas concerts with the New Swingle Singers at Roy Thomson Hall. In 1985 it performed at tricentennial Bach festivals in Toronto and Edmonton and presented some 75 concerts in the USA, including four appearances at Carnegie Hall. Also in 1985 it performed in the film All That Bach (Rhombus Media). In 1986 it appeared at Expo '86 in Vancouver and toured Canada and the Far East, including performances in Singapore, Australia, Indonesia, and Hong Kong.\n\n1990s - Present\n\nIn 1990 Canadian Brass teamed up with the comedy troupe Royal Canadian Air Farce for a successful Canadian tour.\n\nAs of 1991 the ensemble was based in the US (its home base later reverted to Canada.) Its US and European engagements greatly outnumbered those at home. In the mid-1990s, it was performing typically 90 concerts annually in the US and 35 in Europe.\n\nCanadian Brass continue to devote time to educating young musicians. It has been resident ensemble at the University of Toronto (1998-2003) and the Music Academy of the West (California) 2001-5. In the 1990s it began publishing method books and brass quintet repertoire through the Hal Leonard Corporation.\n\nThe matched gold-plated instruments on which Canadian Brass plays were made by Renold Schilke.\n\nRepertoire and Recordings\n\nCombining disciplined performance and informal deportment with a lively and engaging sense of humour, and a repertoire encompassing several centuries and styles as disparate as renaissance and ragtime, Canadian Brass quickly established itself as one of Canada's (and indeed the world's) most popular touring groups. Its trademark stage footwear is running shoes; the members often appear in wigs and costumes for comedic effect, to aid in their stated aim: to demystify the concert experience.\n\nOver the years, Canadian Brass has pioneered the expansion of repertoire for brass quintet by creating its own arrangements of orchestral music, music for solo instruments, jazz and pop standards, and many arrangements of a surprising or experimental nature. Although the members remain first-class classical instrumentalists, they toss aside assumptions about musical boundaries, and are equally at home playing Dixieland jazz and Lennon-McCartney pop tunes. Arrangers whose work the ensemble has performed include Gary Kulesha, Howard Cable, Chris Dedrick, Luther Henderson and Don Sebesky. The cross-genre appeal of Canadian Brass has led to the establishment of many other brass ensembles.\n\nCommissioned Compositions for Brass Quintet\n\nCanadian Brass has commissioned dozens of classical and jazz works. Some of the composers it has recently commissioned works from include Malcolm Forsyth, Bramwell Tovey, William Bolcom, and Michael Kamen.\n\nThe following list shows the titles it commissioned from Canadian composers (all covered in EMC) between 1971-8 alone.

That year, as the Pucker and Valve Society Band, it extended its range with an LP of novelty compositions and arrangements by Ben McPeek. After making recordings for Boot and the CBC, it signed in 1980 with RCA, in 1982 with the CBS Masterworks label, and in 1989 with Philips. It has also recorded with Sony Classical and other labels. By 2004, Canadian Brass had released over 50 recordings (see Discography). That year, it began working with Opening Day Recordings.\n\nCanadian Brass received a Juno award in 1985 as instrumental artists of the year. Its video Home Movies was nominated for a Grammy award, as was the recording Take the \"A\" Train. Its recordings have been listed on Canadian pop radio charts (\"Very Merry Christmas\") and jazz charts (Swingtime) in addition to classical and crossover charts.\n\nRecognition and Tributes\n\nThe quintet was selected in 1981 as the ensemble of the year by the Canadian Music Council; a year earlier it received an achievement award from the Broadcast Executives Society. It delivered the SOCAN MacMillan Lecture at the University of Toronto in 1996. Canadian Brass has been recognized with awards from the US Music Educators National Conference, Switzerland's Golden Rose Festival, the Global Classical Music Poll, and other bodies eg in the US and Germany."}, {"url": "https://www.allaboutjazz.com/musicians/canadian-brass", "page_content": "Five tremendous brass musicians--each a virtuoso in his own right--form the legendary Canadian Brass.

On their travels around the world, they often pause for masterclasses and are more than happy to work with students and young audiences. Canadian Brass was Chamber Quintet-in-Residence for many years at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, California, and has created an innovative brass summer course at the Eastman School of Music. Their support of education is also clearly viewed in their outreach and interaction with El Sistema, the acclaimed global music education program in Venezuela.\n\nIn conjunction with the Hal Leonard Corporation, the Canadian Brass have made available their extensive library of brass music for performers of all levels as well as learning tools.

What set Canadian Brass apart from all other performing artists in 1970 was the relentless search for repertoire that was both loved by its performers and embraced by a growing brass audience.\n\nThe musical experiences of the members along with the interests and wishes of audiences informed the programs that the group created ranging from Bach, Handel, Vivaldi, Joplin, Gershwin and Ellington, to ballet, opera and Schickele. The ensemble never ignored an opportunity to relate to its audience which brought the Brass to international attention. They were at first criticized for talking to audiences and now take pride in seeing the entire concert world embracing engagement as a fundamental element of performance.\n\nThe Brass has averaged two and a half full length recordings per year of its 52 years of existence for a total of 138 recordings. They have received a combined total of 24 Grammy and Juno nominations and won the German Echo Award for Goldberg Variations. A North American group taking Bach back to Europe and winning approval at the highest level was a crowning achievement! Most recently during the Covid era the Brass created another award-winning recording, Canadiana. The album features unique arrangements of many Canadian superstars including Joni Mitchell, k.d. lang, Bruce Cockburn, Drake and DeadMau5.\n\nEducation continues to be at the forefront of Canadian Brass\u2019 yearly activities. There are over one million Canadian Brass quintet repertoire books in the hands of students in every country with a strong brass tradition. Between Hal Leonard Music Publishing distributing its 800 unique individual brass titles and SmartMusic now making available some 76 titles for mixed ensemble use, the Brass continues to shape the future of chamber music ventures.\n\nFor a comprehensive Canadian Brass biography, blend together the complete history of any random five musician ensemble and it will yield a year in the world of Canadian Brass. \u201cWe\u2019ve created ballets, played Carnegie Hall, toured China during its 1977 reopening, and performed in front of five prime ministers, but most importantly performed for more than ten million friends, family and audiences worldwide so far.

Founding member Chuck Daellenbach (tuba) and Jeff Nelsen (horn) talk about why and how the world\u2019s most well-known brass ensemble created this all-Canadian album.\n\nHow does this album reflect the transformation of the Canadian Brass throughout the years?\n\nDaellenbach: \u201cWe realize this is the first recording that was entirely Canadian and Canadian Brass. We've been playing German, South American and American music. This is the first 100 percent Canadian album. That is the evolution of the group, and it seems that the quality of playing is sky high.\u201d\n\nHow are these popular works arranged?\n\nNelsen: \u201cWe have a genius arranger in the group, composer Brandon Ridenour. We were discussing what our favorite Canadian songs were for longer than a year or two, and we thought we should do these tunes. We finally found a space to do it. We collected a list of our top 200 tunes and started passing them to Ridenour who started sending charts.\n\n\u201cHe would disappear after concerts and then, all of a sudden, have a new chart to try. The album is an amazing weaving of Canadian Brass style and ideas with well-known Canadian music. The music also had to survive the test of the lack of lyrics. The pieces have incredible lyrics and an amazing story, but the music's pretty good, too, with the lyrics that worked.\u201d\n\nWhich pieces did each of you contribute to the album?\n\nThe Canadian Brass has been recording and performing music since 1970. Courtesy of artist\n\nDaellenbach: \u201cI'd go one step further. We picked our favorite music artists. I'm really enjoying deadmau5. He is a unique artist who created a place for electronic music. They even created an award at the Grammys because of his success. Everybody would expect when you see deadmau5, you're going to hear something pretty pointless and electronic sounding. But it's probably the most smooth and beautiful brass piece. The underlying music is so strong, and I think we display deadmau5 in a different perspective than people would normally think of him. We're hoping that he agrees that this really shows the sensitive and creative side of his wonderful artistry.\u201d\n\nNelsen: \u201cWe get to perform it with double quintet. It's just an amazing brass choir piece. I chose k.d. lang because I'm from Alberta, like her. She studied with someone who sang with my parents and that connection goes way back, which is why we are playing \u2018Constant Craving.\u2019 It's just such an amazing song, and there's an accordion!\u201d\n\nWhy did it take so long to celebrate Canadian artists as the Canadian Brass?\n\nDaellenbach: \u201cFrom my point of view, I started realizing that we grew up as a group. We grew up with these artists in our environment. We certainly weren't collaborating directly with them, but we were always doing similar things, and we really felt that they were a part of our soundscape as we were growing. We wanted to highlight the lifetime of our ensemble, which is why there are current artists like Drake and deadmau5 alongside earlier artists like Joni Mitchell.\n\n\u201cThis is our heritage, as well. You can take a piece by Bach that's very wonderful and dress it up with new clothes. We can do the same thing with pop music that people are aware of and might be slipping out of the domain. Classical has an opportunity to really preserve music and, in a way, give it a new function. Canadian people might not know that it's Canadian music until we mention it.\u201d\n\nWhat was the most difficult piece to perform?\n\nDaellenbach: \u201cThe piece by Rush. The notes we put in that are rushed. We're playing it faster than Rush as a challenge. It's quite amazing and our guitarist friend Sean Kelley, who can play about everything a guitarist can, helped us out. He was really our connection to get the feeling and sounds in order to bring the mood of the piece alive. We were just playing the notes. That was a challenge for me.\u201d\n\nNelsen: \u201cOur first track, \u2018Je Me Souviens,\u2019 by Laura Fabian, which we have been playing on our tour in Europe, is the most difficult. It's such a gorgeous lyrical piece, and the way Ridenour has us weaving in and out of each other's sounds is beautiful. Everything is such a wonderful challenge as a classical musician. To bring that French style in with the pacing of that tune at the climax is just a really nice challenge. We were pleasantly surprised by the response from the European audience. They just loved the piece.\u201d\n\nResources\n\nCanadian Brass \u2014 Canadiana (Amazon)\n\nCanadian Brass \u2014 Canadiana (Linus Store)\n\nCanadian Brass (official site)"}, {"url": "https://canadianbrass.com/about/awards/", "page_content": "The Canadian Brass were presented the Tri-M Music Award at the MENC National Convention in Phoenix, Arizona, in April 1998.\n\nThe following is the presentation speech given by Donna Stark Fox, National Chair.\n\n\u201cIt is an honor to stand before you today to introduce you to the Tri-M Music Honor Society.
