Both Communication type articles and Full paper type articles can be published under this format. Although there is no formal page limit, authors should report their work in a succinct way. Lengthy introductions, extensive data, excessive experimental details and non-experiment based conjecture should not be included in the main text.\n\nAuthors are encouraged to include a brief experimental section containing key and representative experimental procedures in the main text. Additional repeated information and characterization data should be included in the electronic supplementary information by citing the typical or general procedure in the main text.\n\nAuthors are encouraged to use the article templates from the Royal Society of Chemistry website to prepare Research articles. However, the use of the template for submission is not essential.\n\nReviews\n\nCritical reviews\n\nReviews provide a critical and in-depth discussion of a particularly relevant or interesting topic in organic chemistry. They aim to provide the reader with an authoritative, balanced and up-to-date overview, not a comprehensive list of all possible references. Authors should aim to identify areas in the field where further developments are needed. Critical reviews do not describe any unpublished results.\n\nCritical reviews are normally invited by the editorial board or the editorial office of Organic Chemistry Frontiers; however, direct submissions from authors are also welcome. All reviews undergo rigorous and full peer review and must meet the high standard of the journal to be accepted for publication.\n\nHighlights\n\nHighlights are short, easy-to-read articles that focus on important new developments in the field of organic chemistry. They highlight and provide insight into the significance of the chosen topic, as well as speculating on the future potential and challenges of that field. Highlights are generally four-five journal pages in length, and new results should not be presented.\n\nHighlights are generally contributed by leading experts in organic chemistry, discussing the state of the art and prospects for significant progress in a specific subject area. Direct submissions from authors are also welcome. All Highlights are subject to a rigorous and full peer review procedure.\n\nTutorial accounts\n\nTutorial accounts describe recently established methodologies or protocols that lead to new compounds, chemistry or theories with wide and strong interest in the field of organic chemistry. The authors should provide a concise and practical account of their previously established methodologies, chemistry or theories and instruct the readers on how to reproduce those reactions on larger scales if synthetically related. At least one of the described reactions in a Tutorial account should be at the level of 10 mmol. Reactions on a scale of 10 grams are strongly encouraged.\n\nIt is recommended that a comprehensive graphic demonstration is presented at the beginning of a Tutorial account to provide an overview of the reported chemistry. Suggestions or comments concerning optimal conditions for reactions, purification of reagents, etc, are welcome in the main text. Further uses and advances in the chemistry reported since the original publication should be discussed. Experimental details of the key and representative reactions should be included.\n\nTutorial accounts should be as succinct as possible. It is expected that the articles will be three journal pages in length and contain up to four graphics. Authors are encouraged to use well-designed graphics to provide information in a concise and easy-to-read format. Any unusual apparatus involved in the experiments should be described using both text and photos. Special techniques and hazards associated with the experimental procedure must be clearly indicated.\n\nTutorial accounts are invited by the editor-in-chief of Organic Chemistry Frontiers. All Tutorial accounts are subject to full peer review and must meet the high standards of the journal for publication.\n\nMethods\n\nA Method is a different article type from the current Tutorial account, being technical notes that focus on the practicality of previously published methodologies. Use of unpublished results should be extremely limited. Methodologies in the field of synthetic organic chemistry, natural products purification, spectroscopy, chemical modification and assembly of organic molecules are encouraged as this article type.\n\nReported methods should be of wide application in the relevant research field and of general interest to the broad readership in related areas. A brief introduction is thus required for the associate editor or referees to judge the importance of very original methods or the significant advantages of the reported methods over competing or earlier protocols.\n\nMethods are designed to assist with practical manipulation. Therefore every aspect of the experiments should be explained explicitly. Authors should include the following details in the paper:\n\nApparatus\n\nThe author should indicate the types of glassware and how they are equipped. The types and parameters of any equipment (for example, microwave reactor, glove box, mass spectrometer, etc) should also be listed when they are able to affect the reproducibility of the reactions. A photo of the complete apparatus should be provided.\n\nReagents\n\nFor any commercially available reagent, authors should indicate the purchase source and CAS number. If there is any purification or activation procedure employed, this should also be clarified.\n\nReaction & manipulation\n\nAuthors should give as many details as possible when describing a reaction process. The required information includes but is not limited to the following.\n\nDuration, pressure and temperature\n\nSensitivity to air or moisture\n\nThe amount and order of addition of reactants\n\nAny phenomena observed during the reaction (such as change of color, temperature, the evolution of gases, etc.)\n\nThe monitoring process (for example, if the reaction is monitored via TLC, the Rf and the corresponding solvent system; these should be indicated for products, reactants and significant byproducts or intermediates)\n\nThe workup procedure\n\nPurification & characterisation\n\nAuthors should indicate how the products and significant byproducts are isolated, as well as their physical properties and spectroscopic data (NMR, IR, mass and UV if applicable) and X-ray structures. For the sake of accuracy, the given yield (\u00b13%), as well as other characterisation data, should be reproduced by chemists in the same group and submitted as electronic supporting information.\n\nNote: Authors are not required to include very long discussions in Methods; succinct and straightforward instructions and troubleshooting of experimental procedures are favored and can be included as notes. Authors should mark in the main text where a note is employed. Relevant notes will be placed close to where they are first mentioned. In this section, authors are expected to include any supplementary explanations that do not fit into the introduction and experimental part. For instance, when a reagent is added at an extremely slow speed or in excess, authors should explain why such a procedure is favored and how it will affect the reaction.\n\nElectronic supplementary information\n\nAuthors are required to complete the characterization checklist upon submission of supporting materials. Please note that it is a must to include copies of NMR spectra for any desired compound.\n\nPhotos & videos\n\nPhotos of the reactor should be submitted. Inclusion of videos is also strongly encouraged to record the manipulation and any change of appearance of the reactions. These should be supplied as electronic supplementary information (ESI).\n\nChemistry frontiers\n\nChemistry frontiers are concise, peer-reviewed, forward-looking articles published upon invitation from the editorial office. Authors of Chemistry frontiers will be leading scientists in their research fields. Current hot topics of great interest to the community should be discussed, and personal viewpoints looking forward to the future of the respective research fields are encouraged.\n\nChemistry frontiers can be speculative and controversial in nature. Some new unpublished results may be included but the amount should be minimized. The suggested length is fewer than four journal pages.\n\nProfiles\n\nProfiles are one- or two-page interviews of top-tier chemists. Videos will also be included where appropriate and will be published as electronic supplementary information. From these articles, readers will learn about the academic career and the most important scientific contribution (in the form of well-designed chemical equations/schemes) of the interviewees, as well as some background information about their personal life.\n\nComments\n\nComments and Replies are a medium for the discussion and exchange of scientific opinions between authors and readers concerning material published in Organic Chemistry Frontiers.\n\nFor publication, a Comment should present an alternative analysis of and/or new insight into the previously published material. Any Reply should further the discussion presented in the original article and the Comment. Comments and Replies that contain any form of personal attack are not suitable for publication.\n\nComments that are acceptable for publication will be forwarded to the authors of the work being discussed, and these authors will be given the opportunity to submit a Reply. The Comment and Reply will both be subject to rigorous peer review in consultation with the journal\u2019s Editorial Board where appropriate. The Comment and Reply will be published together."}, {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02410-0/", "page_content": "Susan D\u2019Agostino is a mathematician and science-writing fellow at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Her forthcoming book, How to Free Your Inner Mathematician , is expected to be published by Oxford University Press in March 2020.\n\nAdapted from Getty\n\nIf you\u2019re an early-career researcher, you might not hear much from mentors about the prospect of joining a scientific editorial board for an academic journal or a volume of peer-reviewed research papers. Your mentors might even discourage board membership out of concern that your time would be better spent on research.\n\nHowever, a board-member position could confer large, lasting dividends. The role typically requires a few hours each month (more just before publication deadlines) on tasks such as consulting with editors, recruiting authors or reviewing papers.\n\nThese positions are usually unpaid, but they offer important benefits. Your network will expand to include fellow editorial-board members around the country and the globe, and they could provide leads on professional opportunities or introduce you to new contacts in your discipline. You\u2019ll also gain an insider\u2019s view of publication dos and don\u2019ts, which could accelerate your publication efforts with other journals and boost your marketability for hiring and promotions.\n\nAs a mid-career mathematician with editorial-board experience, I can attest to these benefits. From 2017 to 2019, I was editor-in-chief and editorial-board member of A Celebration of the EDGE Program\u2019s Impact on the Mathematics Community and Beyond, a volume of peer-reviewed mathematics papers in Springer\u2019s Association for Women in Mathematics Series. (Springer Nature publishes Nature.) These appointments, although unpaid, helped me to reach several longtime professional goals.\n\nTime management for scientists\n\nFor example, I secured a sit-down meeting with an editor at my dream publisher only after I\u2019d mentioned my editorial-board position to him. Soon after that meeting, I won a contract for the general-interest book that I had long wanted to write \u2014 a book that I expect will generate royalties and speaking engagements. That contract led to further opportunities, including a fellowship that helped me to make the career move into maths and science writing that I\u2019d been mulling over for a decade. I also won an international grant with funding for travel and writing support, and access to the invitation-only Heidelberg Laureate Forum this September in Germany, so that I can write about this meeting in mainstream publications such as Quanta and The Washington Post. At the forum, I\u2019ll interview \u2018rock stars\u2019 in my field, such as Fields medallists and Abel prizewinners \u2014 a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a mathematician\u2013writer like me.\n\nMy editorial-board-member colleagues report similar career enhancements. One colleague, who had been a postdoc when she became a board member, landed a tenure-track position at her top-choice institution during her term on the board. During her interviews, hiring-committee members mentioned how impressed they were with her editorial-board service. Another colleague was nominated for a faculty scholarship award at her university as a result of serving on our editorial board, a distinction that will be noteworthy in her future applications for promotion. Yet another fellow board member landed a paid editing job with a prestigious publisher that she works for \u2014 and enjoys \u2014 alongside her visiting assistant professorship.\n\nHow did I land my position? It took little more than speaking to a publisher\u2019s representative, and a phone call to the president of my professional association (the Association for Women in Mathematics in Providence, Rhode Island).\n\nTips on how to join an editorial board\n\nIdentify a target publication or two on whose editorial board you would like to serve. Read your target publications to familiarize yourself with the topics, format, tone and length of accepted articles. Look at the credentials of those on the editorial board to determine whether any match \u2014 or could soon match \u2014 your own.\n\nNetwork with the editors of your target journal and with editorial-board members at professional conferences, where they often hold board meetings. Although their meetings will probably be closed to non-members, you might be able to attend other panels or talks in which the members participate. Find their names on the journal\u2019s inside cover or website. Then, cross-reference the names with lists of conference speakers and attendees.\n\nAt the conference, introduce yourself and ask prepared questions. These could include: \u201cHow did you obtain your editorial-board position? What are your responsibilities? How much time do you spend on editorial duties each week or month? When\u2019s the next call for new board members?\u201d Talk to more than one member of each board to get a full picture.\n\nIf you can\u2019t talk to an editorial-board member at a conference, conduct an informational phone interview. After you have identified an editor or board member, send them an e-mail requesting a 30-minute phone conversation about board membership. Most people enjoy talking about their work, so don\u2019t worry that you\u2019re intruding. During the phone call, ask your prepared questions.\n\nLook for calls for new editorial-board members in your target journal. Be aware, however, that some volunteer positions might be filled through word of mouth from the current board\u2019s network \u2014 even more reason to communicate your interest to a current board member, as noted above.\n\nApply for open editorial-board positions promptly when they are advertised. After all, you can\u2019t be appointed to a scientific editorial board without requesting formal consideration.\n\nUnderstand the value you bring to an editorial board if you identify as a woman, or are a member of a minority ethnic group. Research on maths and science editorial-board demographics is rare, but a 2017 PLoS Biology study1 found that more than two-thirds of environmental-biology-journal editors hail from the United States or the United Kingdom, and most other editors come from other financially privileged countries. \u201cNow is the time to challenge the status quo,\u201d a 2018 Lancet paper on gender inequities in scientific publishing urges2.\n\nExplicit and implicit biases are real. There is a growing awareness in academic publishing that homogeneous editorial boards conflict not only with journals\u2019 values but also with scientific progress. If you would bring a diverse perspective, communicate that in your search for a position.\n\nConsider alternative routes to editorial-board service. During my first board stint, I spoke to a publisher\u2019s representative about editing a volume from my research community. I left that conversation with the editor\u2019s contact information in hand and a sense of what she sought in a new board recruit. Fast-forward a few months: I was appointed.\n\nApply again if your first attempt is not fruitful. Strategize about ideas for target journals, or people whom you might contact, during your commute or before falling asleep at night. Seek advice from trusted mentors. Persist until you succeed."}, {"url": "https://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/about-journals/chem-soc-rev/", "page_content": "Tutorial Reviews\n\nTutorial Reviews are concise, accessible and authoritative overviews of important contemporary topics in the chemical sciences.
