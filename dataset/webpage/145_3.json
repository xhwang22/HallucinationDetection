{"Catherine Johnson has written plays for the Royal Court Theatre, the National Theatre, and the Royal Shakespeare Company.": [{"url": "https://royalcourttheatre.com/about/history/", "page_content": "\u2018The most important theatre in Europe\u2019 \u2014 New York Times\n\nOn 8 May 1956, John Osborne\u2019s Look Back in Anger opened at the Royal Court on Sloane Square. It was the third production of the new English Stage Company, under Artistic Director George Devine, and is now considered the play that marks the beginning of modern British drama.\n\nGeorge Devine aimed to discover \u2018hard-hitting, uncompromising writers\u2019, and create a company that would challenge and stimulate British theatre. In January 1956, he placed an advert in The Stage calling for scripts and received over 700 submissions. The one that stood out was Look Back in Anger, a play already rejected by Laurence Olivier, Terence Rattigan and Binkie Beaumont. Look Back in Anger opened to empty houses and mostly terrible reviews (with the exception of Kenneth Tynan in the Observer), but Devine stood by both the playwright and the play, which expressed the anger and frustration of the younger generation in the 1950s.\n\nThe Royal Court was Britain\u2019s first national theatre company, and has held firm to its vision of being a writers theatre. Its plays have challenged the artistic, social and political orthodoxy of the day, pushing back the boundaries of what was possible or acceptable. Throughout the 1960s the Royal Court regularly came into conflict with the Lord Chamberlain Office (the official censors of the London stage). Three plays were refused a license to be performed at all (Osborne\u2019s A Patriot for Me and Edward Bond\u2019s Saved and Early Morning). These battles led to the abolition of the Lord Chamberlain Office in 1968.\n\n\u2018Absolute proof of the power of live theatre\u2019 \u2014 Observer\n\nIn 1969, the Royal Court opened the 60-seat Theatre Upstairs, one of the first black box studios opened by a mainstream theatre. Early productions included The Rocky Horror Show by Richard O\u2019 Brien and Owners by a new writer for the stage, Caryl Churchill, who went on to write 17 plays for the Royal Court.\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s expanded and consolidated the Royal Court\u2019s reputation. Writers such as Peter Gill, Christopher Hampton, Athol Fugard, Howard Brenton, David Hare, David Storey, Joe Orton, Ann Jellicoe, Wole Soyinka, David Edgar, Sam Shepard and Mary O\u2019 Malley all cut their teeth at the Royal Court. Plays such as Saved by Edward Bond, The Philanthropist by Christopher Hampton and The Kitchen by Arnold Wesker are now staples of the British stage.\n\nThe Young People\u2019s Theatre was set up in 1966 to develop and produce the best new writing by young people under 25, encouraging writers from all sections of society to find their voice. This led to the first Young Writers Festival in 1973, which was a regular event for the next two decades.\n\n\u2018The undisputed epicentre of new writing in this country\u2019 \u2014 Time Out\n\nMax Stafford-Clark became Artistic Director in 1979 and steered the Royal Court through the turbulent 1980s. In a period of funding cuts and rising costs, he nurtured a new group of emerging playwrights such as Andrea Dunbar, Hanif Kureishi, Sarah Daniels and Jim Cartwright and presented seminal productions including Victory by Howard Barker, Insignificance by Terry Johnson, Our Country\u2019s Good by Timberlake Wertenbaker and Rat in the Skull by Ron Hutchinson.\n\nThe heart of George Devine\u2019s vision was to bring the nation to the stage and to produce plays that examined the challenges and possibilities of the time. One play that realised this vision was Top Girls by Caryl Churchill, which opened in 1982 and captured the spirit of the age. Throughout the 1980s, the Royal Court swam against the tide of lavish West End musicals and comfortable comedies, staging writers who questioned and challenged.\n\nThe 1990s recaptured the fury of the 1950s. Stephen Daldry\u2019s Royal Court was young, angry and noisy. Sarah Kane, Joe Penhall, Jez Butterworth, Anthony Neilson, Martin McDonagh and Mark Ravenhill wrote visceral plays, which confronted audiences with an increasingly violent and isolated society.\n\nHowever, by the early 1990s, the theatre was on the brink of contravening health and safety regulations and guidelines. In 1995, the Court was told that, within eighteen months, the building would be forced to close. In the same week as the New York Times described the Royal Court as the most important theatre in Europe, The Times called the building a \u2018dump\u2019.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s hard not to rave about the Royal Court\u2019 \u2014 Guardian\n\nThe theatre\u2019s lighting system was old and untrustworthy with an increasing number of sockets becoming dangerous; two similar wooden grids, at the Haymarket and Strand theatres, had recently broken, thus leaving the Court\u2019s at the top of the danger list. The job of putting on shows had become more difficult and more and more costly. Moreover the drains, which Granville Barker hated in the early 1900s, still flooded the stalls and understage; the creak of the seats which Bernard Shaw got irate over in 1906 infuriated Harold Pinter in 1994 and the dressing rooms which Laurence Olivier said were \u2018slightly worse than Blackpool\u2019s were in 1932\u2019, were all in a sorry state. The office space had ceased to be functional. Audience facilities had become unacceptable.\n\nIn 1995, with the advent of the National Lottery, the Royal Court had a once in a lifetime opportunity to restore its crumbling stage and make safe the structure of the building. However, it also realised that there was a rare opportunity to address the wider issues of accessibility and the theatre\u2019s position within the community. Therefore, it undertook a feasibility study of the entire building, its operation and the structure and management of company. Subsequently, a bid was submitted to the Arts Council of England for capital development. In the first wave of grant awards, the Court was awarded \u00a316.2 million.\n\nRedevelopment work began on the Royal Court Theatre on 24 March 1996. The building work touched all parts of the original building; however, the major features of the facade and the intimate auditorium have been preserved. The new theatre has significantly improved the quality of the building\u2019s facilities for performers and theatre-goers. In particular, the theatre includes facilities for people with disabilities and, for the first time in its history, is fully accessible for audience members, performers and staff.\n\nWhile the Royal Court was forced to close for rebuilding, it took its message to the heart of the West End, taking over two theatres; the Theatre Downstairs found a home at the Duke of York\u2019s on St Martin\u2019s Lane and the Theatre Upstairs moved into an adapted Ambassadors on West Street. From these two theatres, the English Stage Company expanded its work, staging more and more plays not only from Britain, but from around the world. Continuing Devine\u2019s vision of a truly international theatre, the International Programme was founded to find new voices in other countries and bring their work back to London. The renamed Young Writers Programme continues to discover new writers in communities up and down the country.\n\n\u2018The most stylish, welcoming & imaginatively designed theatre in town\u2019 \u2014 Daily Telegraph\n\nThe new Royal Court, which opened its doors in February 2000, was a powerhouse: a confident, vigorous company still committed to its founding ideals.\n\nAnd today, after 60 years, writers, directors, actors and audiences still look to the Royal Court for the classics of the future. Plays that were once considered subversive, immoral or blasphemous are now studied in schools and performed all over the world. George Devine wanted to create a \u2018vital, modern theatre of experiment\u2019. 60 years on, that theatre stands at the centre of a vigorous, renewed culture of playwriting.\n\nARTISTIC DIRECTORS\n\n2013 to present Vicky Featherstone\n\n2007 \u2013 2013: Dominic Cooke\n\n1998 \u2013 2006: Ian Rickson\n\n1992 \u2013 1998: Stephen Daldry\n\n1979 \u2013 1992: Max Stafford-Clark\n\n1977 \u2013 1979: Stuart Burge\n\n1975 \u2013 1977: Robert Kidd and Nicholas Wright\n\n1972 \u2013 1975: Oscar Lewenstein\n\n1969 \u2013 1972: William Gaskill, Lindsay Anderson and Anthony Page\n\n1965 \u2013 1969: William Gaskill\n\n1956 \u2013 1965: George Devine"}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/prospero/2021/01/12/the-royal-court-takes-inspiration-from-the-federal-theatre-project", "page_content": "IN A RECENT newspaper interview Vicky Featherstone, the artistic director of the Royal Court Theatre in London, discussed the problem covid-19 poses to playhouses: \u201cHow do we get 500 people through the door, to the toilet, to get a drink and sit down at the same time?\u201d It\u2019s a prosaic question, but an urgent one. More than most businesses, theatre depends on getting bodies into buildings. Livestreamed digital performances are a poor substitute, and socially distanced productions are the worst of both worlds: busy enough that every cough in the audience sets the teeth on edge, but too empty to hear ripples of laughter or collective gasps of shock. In Britain, successive lockdowns have ruled out even those attenuated forms of drama.\n\nThe loss is significant. Especially at moments of crisis, theatrical storytelling allows societies to process events collectively. The \u201cpurpose of playing,\u201d as William Shakespeare put it, is to \u201chold the mirror up to nature\u201d. That is not to mention the extensive ecosystem of actors, writers, designers, stage managers, technicians and choreographers who have been left out of a job. Many are freelancers without access to the pandemic relief funds doled out to institutions.\n\nIn response to this predicament, the Royal Court has turned to an American precedent for inspiration: the Federal Theatre Project (FTP), a programme of stage and radio plays set up during the Depression of the 1930s as part of the New Deal. The causes of theatre\u2019s problems were different back then. Economic disaster brought to a head decades of artistic stagnation, partly caused by the need to compete with cheap movies and radio. Directors were paralysed, self-defeatingly clinging to tired formats with dwindling appeal, such as vaudeville. Yet the resulting problems were familiar: lots of unemployed theatre workers and the diminishment of cultural life.\n\nThe FTP was designed to solve the first of these problems. It was explicitly a relief measure, never aiming at commercial success; tickets to two-thirds of its productions were free. But it ended up tackling the second issue, too. The FTP drew on the talents of Orson Welles, Marlon Brando and Arthur Miller, staging forward-thinking productions influenced by the European avant-garde. Its plays squarely addressed the issues of the day, often in the form of openly political left-wing invective. \u201cLiving Newspapers\u201d, from which the new Royal Court show takes direct inspiration, adapted newspaper clippings about unequal housing or agricultural policy into polemical drama, informing audiences and critiquing those in power.\n\nThe FTP also stridently pushed for racial equality and diversity, funding branches for black theatre-makers and kicking out managers who attempted to segregate workers. For its trouble\u2014and despite considerable critical success\u2014the FTP was defunded in 1939 by the Un-American Activities Committee of the House of Representatives, on the grounds that it promoted racial integration and a communist agenda.\n\nThe Royal Court\u2019s \u201cLiving Newspaper\u201d is not on the same scale as the FTP\u2019s, which cost $46m at the time\u2014hundreds of millions in present-day terms. But its stated aims are consistent with its predecessor: \u201cto give as many people as possible work, to bring our theatre back to life and to create something which is urgent, dynamic, political and disruptive\u201d. The theatre estimates that more than 200 freelance artists will work on the programme. Made up of sketches, monologues, installations and dance sequences staged around the Royal Court\u2019s building in Sloane Square, the \u201cLiving Newspaper\u201d was meant to be created and performed weekly, before the latest lockdown paused the schedule.\n\nThe second edition, recorded and streamed online, upholds the tradition of racial inclusivity in its diverse cast and writers, as well as in its content. One playlet features Cantonese aunties teaching protest strategies developed on the streets of Hong Kong; another rails against lurid media coverage of police violence against black people. As for political invective, the opening performance is a grime protest song by Jammz, a rapper, who is accompanied by singers belting out a chorus riff of \u201cTory scum\u201d. Regrettably, despite targeting everything from ambulance waiting times to the mendacity of Brexit campaigners (hardly a hot-off-the-press political issue), the song fails to land truly meaningful blows. Instead, with the closing shouts of \u201cyou will not survive the revolution!\u201d it comes to feel a bit silly.\n\nVastly more successful are the scenes which approach politics obliquely. The best is a monologue by Emteaz Hussain, a playwright, told from the perspective of a newly homeless mother of young children. The drudgery of grinding poverty is laid bare: tortuous household calculations over tins of beans or nappies and rehearsals of times-tables in cramped emergency accommodation. A monologue directly addressing the audience isn\u2019t a new theatrical format. But in the hands of a talented writer, it can still be an extraordinarily powerful one.\n\nThe first two editions of \u201cLiving Newspaper: A Counter Narrative\u201d had their premiere in December 2020. The project will continue after the current national lockdown"}, {"url": "https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/museum-life/discovering-the-royal-court-theatre-archive", "page_content": "Volunteer, Julia Rank, shares some of her discoveries while working on the Royal Court Theatre Archive in the Department of Theatre and Performance.\n\nAs a student on the V&A and Royal College of Art\u2019s History of Design MA (taking the specialist Performance Pathway) and a volunteer in the Theatre and Performance department, my first project, alongside my classmate Dorothy Hill, has been the task of sorting through boxes donated by the English Stage Company of the Royal Court Theatre. We\u2019ve filled over 120 archive boxes so far and that\u2019s only the first stage of the process! Among the financial records, building maintenance documents and varied correspondence, a few items in particular have caught our attention.\n\nFirst night telegrams\n\nRoyal Shakespeare Company chief Peter Hall and his then-wife Leslie Caron sent this first night telegram in January 1962, when Tony Richardson\u2019s production of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream took place. This design seems to have been the standard festive telegram of the early 1960s. This production was something of a family affair, featuring Richardson\u2019s then-brother and sister-in-law Corin and Lynn Redgrave as Lysander and Helena (the bit when the spell makes Lysander fall for Helena must have been a bit awkward\u2026). Sketches of Jocelyn Herbert\u2019s fairy costumes for the production held by the V&A can be found here. Peter Hall staged his own Dream a few months later, starring Judi Dench as Titania.\n\nScripts, scripts, scripts\n\nThe Royal Court is known as the \u2018Writers\u2019 Theatre\u2019, organising numerous events, workshops and mentoring schemes. In 1984. Billy Connolly (pictured) was a mentor on the Young Writers\u2019 Programme. Alumni of this programme have included Laura Wade (Posh), Lucy Prebble (Enron) and Polly Stenham (That Face). A large part of the recent addition to the archive came from the Royal Court\u2019s literary department and includes many scripts, some of which are annotated, and others show a sequence of revisions.\n\nCalling Mark Rylance\n\nThis mobile phone is one of the only objects in the donation, and was used in Jez Butterworth\u2019s multi award-winning play Jerusalem, one of the Royal Court\u2019s biggest hits of recent years. It\u2019s probably the one featured in the scene in which Mark Rylance\u2019s Johnny Byron\u2019s ex, Dawn, asks to borrow his phone to call her new partner. This Nokia device appears charmingly retro now and was probably on its way to obsolescence in 2009, two years after the first iPhone was released.\n\nThe Royal Court\u2019s favourite actor?\n\nIt\u2019s exciting to find names such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Daniel Craig and Sally Hawkins pre-film stardom. However, amongst production cast lists, one name appears repeatedly: Linda Bassett. I must admit that it probably wouldn\u2019t have been so obvious to me if I didn\u2019t absolutely adore her marvellous performance as the no-nonsense and golden-hearted Nurse Crane on Call the Midwife, prior to which she was probably best known for her role as Ella Khan in East is East, which she originated at the Royal Court in 1996 and then reprised on film (for which she was nominated for a BAFTA). A regular performer in the plays of Caryl Churchill, Bassett was hailed by Susannah Clapp in the Observer as \u2018one of our greatest and least anointed actors\u2019 for her performance in Churchill\u2019s Escaped Alone (2016).\n\nDisillusioned of Twickenham\n\nThe Royal Court isn\u2019t a theatre that tends to offer \u2018a fun night out\u2019 in the traditional sense. I Licked a Slag\u2019s Deodorant (Jim Cartwright) is probably the least appealing title I\u2019ve ever heard; the show reports for Shopping and Fucking (Mark Ravenhill) suggest that there was scarcely a performance without a walk-out, and Sarah Kane\u2019s Blasted made a number of critics sympathise with Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells. When David Storey\u2019s play Home (1970) starring Sir Ralph Richardson and Sir John Gielgud failed to deliver the \u2018exhilarating entertainment\u2019 that Mrs Alice Palmer expected, she wrote directly to Sir Ralph to request a refund for this \u2018technical presentation of a most distressing theme\u2019. In spite of Mrs Palmer\u2019s \u2018shattering disillusionment\u2019, Home went on to win the New York Drama Critics\u2019 Circle Award for Best Play, and was nominated for a Tony award.\n\nThe catalogue to the Royal Court Archive can be viewed online here and recent additions to the archive will be added to this listing in due course.

His tenure, still some way from finished, will be a tough act to follow.\n\nBut the National is scarcely the only game in a town that \u2014 far more than New York \u2014 all but demands turnover at the top as a way of allowing a succession of voices their place at the cultural table.

Although still dependent on the Arts Council for its core funding, during this time, a significant amount of sponsorship for the Court across this period was received from American donors. Importantly, the National Theatre (NT) Studio also provided vital opportunities and space, particularly during the rehearsal period, to support the programming of new plays at the Court. Under Sue Higginson\u2019s leadership, the NT Studio, which was housed in the Old Vic Annex, continued to develop new plays both at the National and through co-productions with other theaters. It was through a co-production with the NT Studio that the Royal Court was able to produce six of the plays by new writers programmed in the Theatre Upstairs between the autumn of 1994 and early 1995. The studio provided the rehearsal space and covered the cost of the actors, director and stage manager for the entirety of the rehearsal period, which effectively halved the cost of production for the Royal Court.Footnote 27\n\nIn addition to the NT Studio collaboration, further financial aid was acquired through the establishment of a new scheme for emerging playwrights. In a partnership between the Jerwood Charitable Foundation and the Royal Court that continues today, Jerwood New Playwrights (JNP) was launched in 1994 to support the production of work by early-career playwrights.Footnote 28 JNP continues to contribute to the annual production of three plays produced across the Royal Court\u2019s two stages, but, in its inaugural year, the scheme supported five of the six young writers programmed as part of the 1994\u20131995 season of new plays. Penhall\u2019s Some Voices, which opened the season in September 1994, was the first play to benefit from the JNP initiative. Other JNP beneficiaries for the 1994\u20131995 season were Upton for Ashes and Sand along with Kane\u2019s debut play Blasted. Two of the plays to feature in the 1994 Young Writers\u2019 Festival were also awarded JNP funding, with Grosso\u2019s Peaches and Wynne\u2019s The Knocky completing the inaugural cohort of JNP recipients. The collaboration between the Royal Court, NT Studio and Jerwood Foundation during this time, therefore, can be regarded as a valuable alliance that allowed for Daldry\u2019s ambitious plans for the Court to reach fruition.\n\nThe regional attention in the eighteen-month build-up to the 1994 Young Writers\u2019 Festival had focused on young playwrights based in the London area and, for the first time, in Northern Ireland. There, playwriting workshops were conducted in Derry, Coleraine and Belfast. The decision to take the work of the Young Writers\u2019 Festival to Northern Ireland in 1993\u20131994, at the beginning of the Peace Process which aimed to put an end to almost twenty-five years of the Troubles, presents an underlying political motivation to the Festival\u2019s work. In a report to the English Stage Company Council, Tickell writes how he is \u201cparticularly excited about the range of young people who have attended our workshops,\u201d and that \u201ca very wide range of ages, cultural and ethnic backgrounds and levels of experience\u201d had been involved in the process.Footnote 29 The director further states how it was the responsibility of the Young Peoples\u2019 Theatre \u201cto ensure that the Festival was able to accommodate and celebrate this diversity in the productions\u201d as it prepared for performances in both the Theatre Upstairs in October and in Northern Ireland the following month.Footnote 30 The emphasis on diversity here is a feature that has been inherent in the YPT\u2019s work for some time: the commitment to staging work by young writers of diverse age, race, ethnicity, class and sexuality had been carefully considered by each of the YPT\u2019s directors since the scheme\u2019s inception.\n\nThe autumn of 1994 to the spring of 1995 marked a season that brought an influx of young writers to the Royal Court stage. Reflecting on the program of work produced over this period in the 1994 Young Writers\u2019 Festival\u2019s accompanying play text, Daldry notes \u201cthe huge success of the season,\u201d stating that \u201cit pays testimony to the fact that there is a growing urgency in young people to express themselves through dramatic writing.\u201dFootnote 31 The Artistic Director concludes his preface to the Coming on Strong published play text by crediting the important work of the Young Peoples\u2019 Theatre for its role in producing young playwrights, writing:\n\nI am delighted that the writers who have emerged through the Young Peoples\u2019 Theatre, and in particular the Young Writers\u2019 Festival, are now being published. I sincerely hope that you share our enthusiasm for these plays and, just as importantly, appreciate the process by which they have emerged.Footnote 32\n\nThere is an element of irony in the fact that Daldry has chosen to highlight his appreciation for the Young Writers\u2019 Festival\u2019s process in his foreword. Indeed, Rebecca Prichard has noted the benefit of having \u201caccess to the writing workshops\u201d and how this allowed for time to \u201cexperiment with ideas and see what was working dramatically.\u201dFootnote 33 But as has been alluded to throughout this chapter, the Festival\u2019s process-led methods are at direct odds with the Daldry/Whybrow mantra of producing work \u201cwithout a process.\u201dFootnote 34 What\u2019s more, the plays that evolved from the Festival follow a recognizable pattern of development that was also visible, during the same period, in the Court\u2019s acquisition of work by other previously identified writers such as Kane, Ravenhill and Kahn-Din. The YPT\u2019s methods of developing aspiring playwrights through the use of process, therefore, can be seen as a continuing influence on the Court\u2019s ability to successfully and consistently produce young writers during this day. However, as the notion of process became increasingly suppressed in the broader narrative of the Royal Court in the 1990s, the idea that many of their plays were staged without the need for prior dramaturgical support or without sustained engagement with the writers has evolved to become one of many falsehoods that has perpetuated the mythology that surrounded the Court during this decade.\n\nBefore their plays were selected for production, Wynne and Prichard had been part of the London workshops, while Coyle had participated in the Festival\u2019s workshops in Derry. London-born Grosso was a member of the YPT\u2019s writers\u2019 group and his play Peaches had been developed under the tutelage of Andrew Alty. Prior to Peaches , Grosso\u2019s first piece, a monologue titled Mam Don\u2019t, had been produced by the Young Peoples\u2019 Theatre and performed at the Commonwealth Institute in 1993. Elaine Aston characterizes the four plays produced as part of Coming on Strong as being linked \u201cby a dramatic world in which people struggle to make sense and purpose out of difficult times or empty lives.\u201dFootnote 35 Out of these works emerged the early signs of individual styles and original voices that, in the case of Prichard, Wynne and Grosso, would go on to feature on both the Royal Court and British stages in the future. Each of the plays expresses a \u201cpolitics of the individual\u201d theme, described by Daldry as a central feature of many of the plays that emerged across the decade.Footnote 36 Evidence of this can been seen through ideas of sexuality as explored through Grosso\u2019s Peaches and Coyle\u2019s Corner Boys and in the sharp comedy and dialogue of Prichard\u2019s Essex Girls , a portrayal of teenage girls approaching adulthood. Wynne\u2019s The Knocky owes a debt to Chekhovian tradition and to Daldry\u2019s production of J. B. Priestley\u2019s An Inspector Calls in 1992 with its vivid perception of growing up on a council estate in England. These plays were programmed alongside other plays by young, unknown writers, which focused on mental illness, violence and the effects of war. Both Jacqueline Bolton and Aleks Sierz have previously suggested links between the 1950s and the 1990s Royal Court,Footnote 37 and echoes of the 1950s Royal Court plays ring within these works too, as \u201csceptical, frustrated and disempowered\u201d voices once again occupied the theater\u2019s stages.Footnote 38\n\nJoe Penhall had also come through the writers\u2019 group at the Young Peoples\u2019 Theatre in the late 1980s. His short play Wild Turkey was produced at the Old Red Lion as part of the 1993 London New Play Festival while he was still a member of the YPT, after which he wrote Some Voices:\n\nI wrote a long play, which was Some Voices. I offered it to the Bush, and they didn\u2019t want it, and I offered it to the National Theatre and they didn\u2019t want it, and I offered it to Hampstead and they didn\u2019t want it, and I offered it to the Royal Court and Stephen Daldry rang me up at work and said: \u201ccome in and talk to me.\u201dFootnote 39\n\nDuring his involvement with the YPT, Penhall\u2019s writing potential had first been spotted by the writers\u2019 group\u2019s tutor April De Angelis, who, in turn, forwarded a sample of his work to the literary department at the Royal Court: \u201cI said, \u2018look I just think this person has really got something.\u2019\u201dFootnote 40 Although the Court had initially overlooked Penhall\u2019s talent\u2014as De Angelis recalls \u201cwe just got a no back\u201d\u2014the writer\u2019s potential was recognized again by Daldry, who, after an initial reading of the play at Battersea Arts Centre in 1993, selected Some Voices to open the new season at the Royal Court.Footnote 41 As a young writer, Penhall\u2019s experience within the YPT and his reception at the Royal Court by two artistic directors is illustrative of wider change within the structures of the theater. According to Whybrow, the Royal Court prior to Daldry\u2019s appointment had been regarded by emerging writers as a \u201cfortress\u201d impenetrable to new writers.Footnote 42 Penhall\u2019s initial rejection was transmuted within a matter of months to full production\u2014an indication of the shift in attitudes taking place at the theater. Where Penhall had emerged through the YPT writers\u2019 group, Judy Upton had been \u201cencouraged to write for the stage\u201d during her participation in the workshop phases of the Young Writers\u2019 Festival held in Sussex in 1990.Footnote 43 Like Penhall, Upton\u2019s first play, Everlasting Rose, premiered at the Old Red Lion in 1992, also as part of the London New Play Festival for that year. Through their involvement in the initiatives offered by the Young Peoples\u2019 Theatre, both Penhall and Upton are likely to have been known by the Royal Court. Indeed, that their plays were produced as part of the London New Play Festival in the two years prior to their programming by the Royal Court is further evidence of the \u201cstrategic tracking\u201d of new writers carried out by Daldry and Whybrow in the early 1990s.Footnote 44\n\nIn the aftermath of Coming on Strong , three writers, Prichard, Grosso and Wynne, were commissioned to write a second full-length play for the Royal Court. For Grosso, this commission materialized as Sweetheart (1996), but neither Wynne\u2019s nor Prichard\u2019s second plays were produced on a Royal Court stage. Wynne did not return to the Royal Court until 2002, when his play The People Are Friendly was produced in the Theatre Downstairs.Footnote 45 Prichard\u2019s return was more prompt, as Fair Game , her third play, opened at the Duke of York\u2019s, where the Court\u2019s Theatre Upstairs had been relocated as part of an ongoing reconstruction project of the theater on Sloane Square, in October 1997. The play was deemed particularly contentious as it featured the gang rape of a thirteen-year-old girl and the Court\u2019s decision to cast the play using actors all under the age of seventeen fueled outrage from some audience members.Footnote 46 Carl Miller, who had succeeded Dominic Tickell as the YPT director, states that in order \u201cto deal with the flack of putting this on with young performers [it was] produced by the Young Peoples\u2019 Theatre.\u201dFootnote 47 Although it was a professional production in which the actors were paid, Fair Game is regarded by Ola Animashawun, the then current YPT\u2019s youth drama worker, as the \u201clast public act of the youth theatre.\u201dFootnote 48 Within a year, the YPT had been reconceived to offer a complete focus on playwriting, and the Young Writers\u2019 Programme was born.\n\nComing on Strong represents a significant turning point in the history of the Young Peoples\u2019 Theatre, which demonstrates its own substantial contribution to a defining moment in British theater. It is important to note here that another YPT alumni Jonathan Harvey and his third play for the Royal Court, Babies, occupied the Theatre Downstairs at the same time that Penhall\u2019s Some Voices opened in the Theatre Upstairs, illustrating, for the first time, two Young Peoples\u2019 Theatre playwrights on both stages of the Royal Court.Footnote 49 What emerged at the end of 1994, therefore, was a consistent contribution by the Young Peoples\u2019 Theatre, as a result of their work with young writers, to seasons of work at the Royal Court. This outcome confirms that the process-led Young Writers\u2019 Festival, which aimed to allow for the extended support of young writers across the country, along with the YPT writers\u2019 group offered a significant contribution toward the production of a new generation of playwrights in the mid-1990s and proved to be an invaluable platform in the provision of young writers to the Court at this time."}, {"url": "https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/royal-court-theatre/", "page_content": "If there were an Eddie the Eagle award for theatre \u2014 to recognise large reputations built on minuscule achievements \u2014 it would go to the Royal Court. Sixty years ago the English Stage Company arrived at \u2018the Court\u2019 determined to amaze the world with a new generation of thrusting young geniuses.\n\nIt won instant notoriety with John Osborne\u2019s Look Back in Anger. This sour bedsit melodrama earned the noisy support of a cabal of reviewers led by Kenneth Tynan who used it to advertise their powers of artistic foresight. Osborne\u2019s next play, The Entertainer, was a cheerless and cumbersome allegory of Britain\u2019s imperial decline, which lacked even the merit of prophecy. It was just a dramatised rehash of the previous decade\u2019s headlines. But the critics were not about to surrender their new-won status as oracles and they hailed it as an entirely original dramatic form, the state-of-the-nation play.\n\nMost popular Brendan O\u2019Neill Prince Harry the Tyrannical\n\nThe Court has been looking for new specimens ever since. The idea rests on the assumption that the \u2018nation\u2019 is a doddery, half-deaf old patriarch who needs to have his sins recounted to him by smart alecs shouting a bit too loud. In the 1950s that may have been true but by the 1960s the old dodderer had been reborn as a hip young groover leading a worldwide revolution in music and fashion. At this point the state-of-the-nation play should have expired but for literary scribblers it was too valuable a theory to abandon altogether so they just plugged the old boy into a life-support machine and kept him going. The motor wheezes on to this day.\n\nOver the decades the Court has blooded countless young writers who are celebrated by the theatrical elite but whose names mean zilch to the general public. And it continues to ape the stale conventions laid down six decades ago. The Court favours fashionable controversy and it adores plays that set out to \u2018provoke debate\u2019 at the restaurant afterwards even though, as we all know, this merely licenses the gobbiest member of the party to bore the rest with his garden-shed perspective on history.\n\nThe current leadership doggedly pursues this arid ritual but on a worldwide canvas. The boss, Vicky Featherstone, stages dramas that illuminate neglected injustices in every corner of the globe, and her artistic programme reads like a commissioning long-list for Dispatches or Panorama. There is no tyranny, no epidemic, no atrocity and no genocide so remote or obscure that it cannot be transformed into a two-hour wrist-slasher to keep the angst-ridden billionaires of Belgravia awake at night.\n\nThe best things in life are free (for a month) Unlock a month\u2019s worth of unlimited online and app access by subscribing today for free.

But publicity for the production prompted angry complaints about Jewish stereotyping. In response, the famous venue on Sloane Square in London has now apologised and agreed to change the name, admitting that it was \u201cunconscious bias\u201d that had led to the Silicon Valley billionaire in the work being given this identity.\n\nIn an official statement, the theatre management added that the character in Smith\u2019s play, Rare Earth Mettle, which stars former Doctor Who actor Arthur Darvill, is not Jewish and that there is no reference to his faith or Jewishness in the show.\n\nAmong those to question the planned use of the name Hershel Fink were Adam Lenson, the director and producer, and David Baddiel, the writer and comedian.\n\n\u201cThe Royal Court claims they didn\u2019t realise \u2018Hershel Fink\u2019 was a Jewish name. Hmmm. Somehow it just sounded so right for a world-conquering billionaire,\u201d Baddiel posted on Twitter. This February, Baddiel\u2019s new book, Jews Don\u2019t Count, argued that antisemitic bias is the one prejudice that remains largely unpoliced in the \u201cculture wars\u201d.\n\nLenson was also critical on Twitter about the Royal Court taking \u201ca character so clearly based on Elon Musk\u201d and giving him \u201can obviously Jewish name\u201d. He added: \u201cCasually making a Silicon Valley billionaire Jewish perpetuates antisemitic stereotypes and will cause ideological harm.\u201d\n\nLaura McGrady, who is a writer, questioned the venue\u2019s claim to be unaware of the connotations of the name. \u201cIf I\u2019m believing that no one noticed the problem here \u2026 which, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not believing that at all. Then am I supposed to believe that writers give characters names from specific cultures or origins without even noticing? Seems a reach to me.\u201d\n\nSet on a salt flat in South America, Rare Earth Mettle is a campaigning piece about the damage inflicted by powerful tech industries. The original Fink character was the chief executive of an electric car company and has been compared to Elon Musk in interviews with Smith.\n\nThe Royal Court said: \u201cWe are grateful to the members of the Jewish community who got in touch with the Royal Court to communicate the name of one of the characters in Rare Earth Mettle is antisemitic.\n\n\u201cFor clarification, the character is not Jewish and there is no reference to being Jewish in the play. We acknowledge that this is an example of unconscious bias and we will reflect deeply on how this has happened in the coming days. We and the writer are deeply sorry for harm caused. In response to our learning the writer has changed the name, as of last night.\u201d\n\nSmith, who has written for Holby City and EastEnders, as well as for radio, penned the recent acclaimed ambulance service-based series of dramas, Life Lines, for BBC Radio 4. He said that he had deliberately aimed at a wide array of targets while writing Rare Earth Mettle, covering racism as well as many of the challenges facing both the global economy and ecology.\n\nBaddiel ironically paraphrased Smith\u2019s ambition on Twitter: \u201cI\u2019ve written a play. Everything \u2013 particularly now and particularly about ethnicity \u2013 gets relentlessly discussed. Except as regards one ethnicity apparently.\u201d And he commented: \u201cIt\u2019s still a very instructive Jews Don\u2019t Count episode.\u201d\n\nBut Baddiel later recognised that the theatre and playwright had subsequently done the correct thing in responding to public dismay and changing the name."}]}
