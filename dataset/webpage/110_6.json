This is especially important as we move from the pandemic.\u201d\n\nAs a signatory of several free trade agreements, including the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), Ng said there are also a lot of markets for Malaysia to tap into.\n\n\u201cWith the prime minister just returning from Beijing, we hope there are more things that we can export to China. We are not just looking at bringing investments from China into Malaysia, but also explore how Malaysian businesses can tap into China\u2019s market,\u201d he added.\n\nAs an agency under MITI, Matrade\u2019s objectives, among others, are to introduce Malaysian companies to foreign importers seeking Malaysian suppliers, and to undertake activities to promote the export of Malaysian goods and services in overseas markets.\n\nReezal, 50, was the former MP for Kepala Batas.

He later served as deputy foreign minister between 2015 and 2018.\n\nDuring his tenure as deputy foreign minister, Malaysia assumed the chairmanship of Asean in 2015 and led the formal realisation of the regional economic integration of the 10 Asean member states. This facilitated the free flow of trade and investments in the region with a population of over 600 million people, and with a combined GDP of over US$3 billion.\n\nHe was appointed Youth and Sports minister in 2020, and Housing and Local Government minister in 2021."}, {"url": "https://politikus.sinarproject.org/persons/reezal-merican-naina-merican", "page_content": "Dato' Sri Reezal Merican bin Naina Merican is a Malaysian politician, and currently serving as Minister of Youth and Sports since 10 March 2020\n\nAlina Cheong is the Private Secretary I to Reezal Merican, Youth and Sports Minister\n\nSpecial Officer to Minister of Youth and Sports, Reezal Merican\n\nSpecial Function Officer to Minister of Youth and Sports, Reezal Merican\n\nSpecial Function Officer to Minister of Youth and Sports, Reezal Merican\n\nSpecial Function Officer to Minister of Youth and Sports, Reezal Merican\n\nPolitical Secretary to Minister of Youth and Sports, Reezal Merican\n\nPress Secretary to Minister of Youths and Sports, Reezal Merican\n\nPrincipal Private Secretary to Minister of Youth and Sports, Reezal Merican\n\nHisham Ahmad Sabri is the Private Secretary II to Reezal Merican, Youth and Sports Minister\n\nProcurement Infrastructure Projects\n\nCited on Issues\n\nSubject has been cited for issues for the following known sources.\n\nThese are sources, and not weighted on strength to make a case for this subject.
