Its basic elements diverged significantly from the reforms that Qu\u00e9bec and other provinces had proposed several months earlier.\n\nA provincial united front on the Constitution had unravelled as the provinces had come to believe that the sovereigntist government of Qu\u00e9bec, led by Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, would not agree to any constitutional patriation plan.\n\nCP PHOTO/Bill Grimshaw\n\nThe basic elements of Canada\u2019s new Constitution were proposed through a secret provincial initiative hastily constructed in an Ottawa hotel on Nov. 4, absent of both L\u00e9vesque and Trudeau and containing little room for revision.\n\nThe prime minister, with palpable unhappiness, accepted it.\n\nFirst Nations were outraged that recognition of Indigenous rights were not included. This was a painful result for Indigenous groups; they had been a part of the constitutional negotiations, albeit at side tables, and had expected Indigenous rights to be recognized as a fundamental limitation on federal and provincial powers and included in the new Constitution.\n\nWomen\u2019s organizations were angry over the failure to include the guarantee of absolute gender equality that they had advocated for and had thought had been accepted by governments as a key element of a modern human rights regime.\n\nBitterness created\n\nThe protests over the absence of Indigenous rights and gender equality were resisted briefly by the provinces but, within weeks, these two categories of rights were added to the accord.\n\nHowever, their initial absence created bitterness and confirmed the suspicion that a provincial power grab was truly fuelling the constitutional reform process \u2014 not a genuine desire for constitutional modernization.\n\nCP PHOTO/Carl Bigras\n\nThe sense that provincial self-motivation was the driving force of constitutional reform was strengthened by the provinces\u2019 attack on the proposed Charter of Rights and Freedoms \u2014 one that enjoyed broad public support.\n\nRead more: 40 years later: A look back at the Pierre Trudeau speech that defined Canada\n\nThe premiers made their agreement for constitutional reform conditional upon Ottawa agreeing to include a section in the Charter \u2014 now known as the notwithstanding clause \u2014 that would allow provincial legislatures to override its most fundamental human rights.\n\nTrudeau again accepted this condition reluctantly and unhappily. It was an alteration of the announced constitutional accord of the most fundamental kind; it occurred without notice or public consultation \u2014 and it was Canada\u2019s constitutional surprise.\n\nCanadian federalism weakened\n\nThe constitutional reform plan adopted in November 1981 has produced resentments and weaknesses in national relations that linger to this day.\n\nToday, Canada\u2019s historic tradition of effective political unification is profoundly tested. Courtesy and trust among the provinces and towards Ottawa have been eroded. We\u2019ve seen countless fights between provinces and the federal government over equalization, environmental regulations and climate change policy and even over the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe events of the night of Nov. 4, 1981, were significant contributions to this decline. What happened then was simple ambush politics led by several provinces to construct a constitutional reform plan that they recognized the prime minister would not be able to reject; national sovereignty and constitutional rights and freedoms had been his battle cry, after all.\n\nReaching a deal under terms of partial defeat was clearly preferable to Trudeau than complete failure and the continuation of Canada\u2019s constitutional morass.\n\nThe cost of constitutional success\n\nAnd so constitutional failure was avoided. But constitutional success has cost Canada and its political integrity.\n\nThe specific acceptance by Trudeau\u2019s government of the constitutional bargain ironically eroded commitment to, and confidence in, the federal government.\n\nCP PHOTO/Fred Chartrand\n\nQu\u00e9bec has not forgotten its exclusion from Canada\u2019s constitutional renewal. The dominant Canadian trope of two nations becoming one was destroyed. Instead, Canada returned to being two nations, and Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s unique manner of engaging in national politics since then underscores the growing difficulty of managing the Canadian state.\n\nThe consequence has been pressure on the federal government for 40 years to act without resolve when faced with nationalist Qu\u00e9bec interests.\n\nGranted, this is not markedly different from the attitude of a number of other provinces during the same period, but unlike other regions of the country, Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s nationalist policies are viewed as the legitimate protection of its distinct culture. Nonetheless, a country is weakened through inattention and indifference to national cohesion.\n\nThe manner in which the Canadian Constitution was created in 1981 following last-minute negotiations has had consequences. The process contributed to weakened national solidarity and has made governing the country more precarious due to insistent demands to accommodate the political wills of provinces."}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/quebec-referendum-1980", "page_content": "L\u00e9vesque founded the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, whose main objective was Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty (Canapress). PreviousNext\n\nPolitical Context\n\nIn the late 1950s and the early 1960s, several organizations were established to promote or achieve Qu\u00e9bec independence. Some of them, such as the Rassemblement pour l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance nationale (RIN; see Pierre Bourgault) also tried their luck in the province\u2019s political arena. On 13 October 1968, a political party was founded that was to continue to have an impact on Qu\u00e9bec and Canadian politics for many years to come. The Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, created by the merger of the Mouvement souverainet\u00e9-association, led by Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, and the Ralliement national, led by Gilles Gr\u00e9goire, also received the support of the militant base of the RIN, which was dissolved at about the same time. As a new, pro-independence political party, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois soon became the rallying point for almost all nationalist movements and associations in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nAfter enjoying moderate success on the political scene, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois won the Qu\u00e9bec general election of 15 November 1976, defeating the Liberals under Robert Bourassa. This victory was attributable to a political manoeuvre, carefully orchestrated by Claude Morin, in which the party promised that it would hold a referendum on sovereignty-association during its first term in government.\n\nJoe Clark at the PC Convention at which he won his party's leadership (photo by John de Visser).\n\nOn 22 May 1979, the federal Liberal Party, led by Pierre Elliott Trudeau, lost the Canadian general election. Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque would now be dealing with a federal minority government led by Joe Clark, a prime minister who had little influence in Qu\u00e9bec. Thus conditions had at last become favourable for the date of the referendum to be announced. On 21 June 1979, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque told Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s National Assembly that the referendum would be held in the spring of 1980. In November 1979, the PQ government published La nouvelle entente Qu\u00e9bec-Canada (known in English as the White Paper on Sovereignty-Association), in which it asserted that \u201csovereignty is indissociable from association.\u201d The wording of the referendum question was announced on 20 December 1979:\n\nThe Government of Quebec has made public its proposal to negotiate a new agreement with the rest of Canada, based on the equality of nations; this agreement would enable Quebec to acquire the exclusive power to make its laws, levy its taxes and establish relations abroad \u2014 in other words, sovereignty \u2014 and at the same time to maintain with Canada an economic association including a common currency; any change in political status resulting from these negotiations will only be implemented with popular approval through another referendum; on these terms, do you give the Government of Quebec the mandate to negotiate the proposed agreement between Quebec and Canada?\n\nIn the meantime, in early December, the political calculus had changed again, when Joe Clark\u2019s government lost a vote of confidence on its first budget. New federal elections were set for 18 February 1980. This time, the Liberals won, taking 74 out of 75 ridings in Qu\u00e9bec, and Pierre Trudeau \u2014 who had returned as party leader \u2014 now formed a majority government ( see Elections of 1979 and 1980 ). He promised that his government would reform federalism and that a No vote in the upcoming Qu\u00e9bec referendum would not be a vote for the status quo.\n\nPierre Trudeau, speaking in 1968. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau speaks for the federalist side, during the campaign for the 1980 Quebec Referendum on sovereignty. PreviousNext\n\nResults of the Referendum\n\nWhen the referendum was held on 20 May 1980, the plan for sovereignty-association was rejected by 59.56% of the votes cast, with a participation rate of 85.61%. An estimated 50% of francophone voters had supported this option. Some observers attributed part of this support, especially among women, to a clumsy comment by Lise Payette, Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Minister of State for the Status of Women. In a speech in the National Assembly on International Women's Day (8 March 1980), she had decried the stereotypical character of Yvette, who still appeared in Qu\u00e9bec elementary school readers as the good little girl who helped around the house. At a partisan meeting the following day, Payette said that Claude Ryan, the leader of the No camp, wanted women to remain \u201cYvettes,\u201d and she then insulted his wife by saying that he was married to one. Liberal Party activists wasted no time in exploiting the minister\u2019s blunder. They held a massive \u201cBrunch des Yvettes\u201d in Qu\u00e9bec City, followed by several others, including one in Montr\u00e9al that attracted over 15,000 female supporters of the No camp. The \u201cYvettes\u201d movement may well deserve credit for reversing the initial trend that showed 47% in favour of the Yes option.\n\nDespite the democratic reforms and intellectual revival that Ryan brought to the Qu\u00e9bec Liberal Party, his leadership was seriously questioned and he resigned in the fall of 1982 (Canapress).\n\nIn the days following the referendum defeat, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois reaffirmed that sovereignty was still the only viable option for Qu\u00e9bec and would one day win majority support. This hope was already palpable in the speech that Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque gave on the night after the referendum, when he said, \u201cIf I have understood you correctly, you are telling us, \u2018until the next time.\u2019\u201d\n\nConstitutional Talks Resume\n\nIn the aftermath of the referendum, intensive negotiations took place between the federal government and the 10 provincial governments (see also Constitutional History), but were suspended when the provincial representatives rejected the federal proposals to patriate the Canadian Constitution. Later, all of the provinces except Qu\u00e9bec embraced this idea.\n\nIn April 1981, despite its loss in the referendum, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was re-elected, with 80 seats in the National Assembly and 49.2% of the votes (an increase of more than 8% in popular support compared with the election of 1976).\n\nHer Majesty Queen Elizabeth II with Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau signing the Constitution, 17 April 1982.\n\nConstitutional Accords Rejected and Second Qu\u00e9bec Referendum Held\n\nIn September 1984, a Conservative federal government was elected, led by Brian Mulroney, and constitutional discussions between the federal and Qu\u00e9bec governments resumed. In May 1985, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois announced the conditions that the government of Qu\u00e9bec would require in order to support patriation. They included recognition of Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s distinct status and its right to either veto federal-provincial agreements or to opt out of them with adequate financial compensation if they were reached without Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s consent (see Federal-Provincial Relations).\n\nThe talks continued beyond the December 1985 Qu\u00e9bec general election, in which Robert Bourassa\u2019s Liberals were returned to power. In June 1987, an agreement was reached. Known as the Meech Lake Accord, it recognized Qu\u00e9bec as a \u201cdistinct society,\u201d comprised other constitutional changes as well, and was conditional on approval by the House of Commons and the provincial legislatures. At the end of the day, the agreement (see Meech Lake Accord: Document) was not adopted.\n\nIn October 1992, a Canada-wide referendum was held on another agreement, the Charlottetown Accord (see Charlottetown Accord: Document). This agreement was rejected by 54.3% of the voters. In October 1995, a Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government held another referendum on Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty (see Qu\u00e9bec Referendum (1995)), which the No side won by a very slim majority: 50.58% of the votes. The participation rate was also very high: 93.25% of all Quebecers participated in this democratic exercise.\n\nAs of this writing, some two decades since this second referendum, the achievement of political sovereignty for Qu\u00e9bec is still part of the program of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. A second party in Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s National Assembly, Qu\u00e9bec Solidaire, has also taken a position in favour of the principle of sovereignty for Qu\u00e9bec."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wilfrid-Laurier", "page_content": "Wilfrid Laurier, in full Sir Wilfrid Laurier, (born November 20, 1841, Saint-Lin, Canada East [now Quebec, Canada]\u2014died February 17, 1919, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada), the first French Canadian prime minister of the Dominion of Canada (1896\u20131911), noted especially for his attempts to define the role of French Canada in the federal state and to define Canada\u2019s relations to Great Britain. He was knighted in 1897.\n\nEarly life and education Laurier was born of French Canadian parents and studied at the college at l\u2019Assomption, where he received literary training under Catholic priests. He then studied law at McGill University in Montreal and was called to the bar in 1864. His bicultural education, most unusual at the time, may have played a part in his lifelong dedication to Canadian unity. While at McGill, he became a leading member of the Institut Canadien, a political club of advanced liberals (Les Rouges) with anticlerical and republican views. Later he joined the law offices of one of the leading Rouge politicians and contributed a number of articles to radical newspapers, one of which he edited for a few months in the mid-1860s. In 1866, for reasons of health, Laurier moved to Athabaska, where he opened his own law practice. In 1868 he married Zo\u00eb Lafontaine of Montreal, and, despite a long relationship with Emilie Lavergne, his law partner\u2019s wife, his childless marriage seems to have been a happy one. In 1871 he was elected to the opposition benches of the provincial legislature of Quebec, where his first speech, an eloquent plea for educational reform, attracted much attention. In 1874 he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons, of which he was to be a member until his death.\n\nRise to leadership As Laurier gradually rose to become minister of internal revenue (1877\u201378) and eventually to leadership of the opposition Liberal Party in 1887, he persistently sought to bring together his countrymen on the issues that have since been recognized as the dominant themes of modern Canadian politics: the relations of church and state, the bicultural entente between French- and English-speaking Canadians, and the country\u2019s association with the British Empire and relations with the United States. One of the political highlights of these years for Laurier was his famous speech on Liberalism delivered in 1877 in the city of Quebec. In that speech he set himself against both the Quebec politicians who attempted to form a Catholic party and the extremist elements in his own group who sought to exclude the clergy from all political activity. Because of his skillful statesmanship, the cold antagonism between conservative churchmen and liberal politicians gradually began to thaw; after 1896 no anticlerical ever attained important public office and no cleric officially interfered in politics. In 1885 Laurier became a national figure when he delivered a moving plea of clemency for Louis Riel, who had led a rebellion of the M\u00e9tis (people of mixed French and Indian extraction) in Manitoba and whose death sentence provoked violent outbursts between the French Catholic nationalists in Quebec and the Britannic groups in Ontario. Showing great courage, Laurier, though not condoning Riel\u2019s actions, charged the government with mishandling the rebellion. Although he did not succeed in saving Riel, he established his reputation as a man of principle and high ideals. Throughout his political life, he emphasized moderation and compromise and gradually became recognized as the only leader able to effect a national reconciliation. At the same time, he was turning his personal magnetism into a valuable political weapon. Between 1887 and 1896 he perfected his party\u2019s organization, refined Liberal strategy, made political alliances, assessed local partisans, and judiciously applied his personal charm to winning over Conservative adversaries and dissident Liberals. He infused new life into his party, for instance, by campaigning vigorously for unrestricted reciprocity, the grant of mutual commercial privileges, with the United States. After the policy had served its purpose, however, he dropped it from his platform in 1893. Between 1895 and 1896 he spoke at between 200 and 300 meetings, thus personally reaching some 200,000 voters. In mid-1896, with the Conservative government divided and disorganized, he easily carried the Liberal Party to victory in the general election.

Each of the 125 Members of the National Assembly (MNAs), elected according to the single-member plurality system, represents a constituency of approximately 40,000 voters. In the past, the province also had a Legislative Council (or Senate), but the latter was abolished in 1968.\n\nSince establishing the Parliament in 1791, Quebec follows the British tradition whereby the majority party (with 63 or more elected MNAs) forms the government and its leader becomes the province's premier. The remaining elected MNAs form the opposition. The party which houses the second highest number of elected members becomes the Official Opposition and its leader, the leader of the Opposition.\n\nSince 2013, the elections are held on a fixed date: every four years, on the first Monday in October. However, if he or she considers it justified, the premier can request the lieutenant-governor to dissolve the National Assembly before the end of term of the Legislature.\n\nChauveau, Ouimet, de Boucherville, de Lotbini\u00e8re, Chapleau, Mousseau, Ross, Taillon, Mercier, Flynn, Marchand, Parent, Gouin, Taschereau and Godbout: 1867-1936\n\nA minimal state\n\nWhile French Canadians were a minority during the negotiations leading to the creation of Canada, they succeeded in imposing the idea of a federation to the anglophone centralists. As a result, the Constitution Act of 1867 was created to split the fields of jurisdiction into two areas: the economic sphere and the social and cultural sphere. The central government is responsible for sovereign duties (diplomacy, defence, national security, law and justice, currency, customs), banking, postal services, fishing and railways, among others. The provincial governments oversee health care, education, civil rights and public lands, to name a few fields.\n\nWhen Quebec first became one of the four provinces of the Dominion of Canada, sources of direct revenue were scarce. By 1867, politicians from Quebec and other provinces were advocating \u201cautonomism\u201d, in other words, increased powers. They were moderately successful until 1960.\n\nAt first, Quebec\u2019s financial freedom was largely reduced. Namely, the State\u2019s expenses in 1900 totalled $4.5 million: 1,000 times less than the present-day amount in inflation-adjusted dollars. During the second half of the 19th century, the rise of ultramontane ideology (the Catholic Church\u2019s interference in public affairs) and that of the classic liberal ideology (economic laissez-faire) led the provincial government to shift away from a large part of its social activities to the benefit of religious institutions. The Catholic Church was thus able to position itself strategically at the head of several schools, hospitals, recreational services and charitable organizations. This clericalism resulted in Quebec being called a \u201cpriest-ridden province\u201d by English Canadians.\n\nOver the last quarter of the 19th century, while industrialization and urbanization reshaped the population, Quebec\u2019s government sought to prevent French Canadians from emigrating outside the province. To achieve this, the government promoted agriculture and encouraged young Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois to explore lands that had not yet been cleared. Since the 20th century, the province has been working to attract foreign assets (from Europe and the Unite States) and help economic development by highlighting Quebec\u2019s natural riches: pulpwood, mining products and hydroelectric energy.\n\nDuplessis and Godbout: 1936-1959\n\nSince the Patriotes movement, French Canadians dreamed of a different political arena from the one established by the traditional parties who, in their opinion, were too quarrelsome and corrupted. Honor\u00e9 Mercier, Quebec\u2019s premier from 1887 to 1891, had claimed that he would have wanted the interests of the country to be placed above those of the party.\n\nDuplessism\n\nThis dream made its way back into the political scene in Quebec during the Great Crash of 1929 which struck the province with full force. By the 1935 elections, the Liberal Party, in power since 1897, had been weakened by the strategic alliance between the Conservative Party under Maurice Duplessis and the Action lib\u00e9rale nationale, a new party formed by dissident members of the Liberal Party. The alliance became a new party named the Union nationale and was led by Maurice Duplessis. It rose to power in 1936 and remained there until 1960, except for the period between 1939 and 1944. Quebec\u2019s time under the Union nationale regime became known as the Grande noirceur (Great Darkness).\n\nMaurice Duplessis maintained the political ways of the previous liberal governments, but he put more emphasis on autonomism. He drew closer to the Catholic Church and to right-wing nationalists. He opposed federal intervention in provincial matters. For example, in 1954, he passed the Provincial Income Tax Act to create some tax room for Quebec. Four years prior, the fleurdelys\u00e9 flag was adopted by Quebec as its provincial flag, under a Ministerial Order.\n\nDid you know?\n\nAll Canadian women did not acquire the right to vote simultaneously. The Constitutional Act of 1791 granted some landowners and tenants the right to vote. The Act referred to eligible voters as \u201cpersons\u201d, making no distinction between male and female constituents. This oversight allowed women in Quebec who met the stipulated requirements to vote until 1849, when they were formally forbidden from doing so. In 1892, the National Assembly passed legislation allowing widows and single land-owning women to vote at municipal and school elections. In 1918, women gained the right to vote in federal elections. In Quebec, the Alliance canadienne pour le vote des femmes au Qu\u00e9bec (Canadian Alliance for the Women\u2019s Vote in Qu\u00e9bec) and the Ligue des droits de la femme (League for Women\u2019s Rights) took matters into their own hands. Led by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Casgrain, the battle endured until victory on 25 April 1940. However, Indigenous women had to wait until 1960 before they could vote at the federal level, and until 1969 at the provincial level. Today, any Canadian citizen aged 18 or above who has lived in Quebec for at least six months can vote in Quebecois elections.\n\nSauv\u00e9, Barrette, Lesage, Johnson (father), Bertrand, Bourassa and L\u00e9vesque: 1959-1981\n\nA lengthy Quiet Revolution\n\nThe death of Maurice Duplessis in 1959 and the election of Jean Lesage in 1960 marked the beginning of the Quiet Revolution (see also Women and the Quiet Revolution). The nationalist politicians steered away from the French-Canadian angle and defined Quebec as the main target of their efforts, including international relations (namely with France).\n\nQuebec\u2019s politicians welcomed Keynesian economics. In other words, they encouraged the State\u2019s active intervention in the economy and monetary policies. Many public institutions and social policies were created, including CEGEPs (public schools which provide students with the first level of post-secondary education), the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec, Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec and the R\u00e9gie de l\u2019assurance maladie. The State\u2019s budget skyrocketed: it quadrupled over the span of a decade (1959-1969). Quebec, until then the most right-winged province in Canada, became the most left-winged. A moral revolution transformed Quebec\u2019s cultural landscape.\n\nThe election of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in 1976 confirmed the triumph of the nation state and the welfare state. In 1977, Bill 101 (Charte de la langue fran\u00e7aise) declared French the official language of Quebec. During its first term, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois enacted other important laws, namely the Act to Govern the Financing of Political Parties. During the referendum on the sovereignty-association of 1980, the No camp won with 60 per cent of the votes.\n\nL\u00e9vesque, Johnson, Bourassa, Johnson (son), Parizeau, Bouchard, Landry and Charest: 1981-2005\n\nNeoliberal adjustments\n\nThe unilateral patriation of the Constitution of 1982 gave rise to fierce constitutional debates. Many federalist Quebecois politicians viewed the failure of the Meech Lake Accord as the result of treason. In the second referendum of 1995, the Yes camp was narrowly defeated. Jacques Parizeau, premier at the time, expressed his outrage the same night: \u201cIt\u2019s true that we were defeated. By what, really? Essentially, by money and by ethnic votes.\u201d\n\nThe 1981-1982 recession exacerbated the economic decline of Quebec because the province had relied on industries and manufactures which were now downgraded. More than ever, Quebec was perceived as the province most overcome by taxes and debt.\n\nIn 1983, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque\u2019s government took measures to rebuild the province\u2019s public finances. Robert Bourassa\u2019s rise to power in 1985 confirmed this milestone. Bourassa appointed a previous upper-rung leader of supermartket chain Provigo as chair of the Conseil du tr\u00e9sor. The latter believed that the government should immediately slash spending, like what was being done under Ronald Reagan in the United States and under Margaret Thatcher in Great Britain. Thus sprung the term \u201c\u00c9tat-Provigo\u201d (\u201cProvigo State\u201d), referring to the government\u2019s will to manage the State as an entrepreneur would a business.\n\nWhile establishing new social policies (grants for childcare centres, public pharma care plan), premier Lucien Bouchard (1996-2001) continued with efforts to improve public finances.\n\nIn 2003, Jean Charest was elected after promising to \u201cre-engineer\u201d the State. His government committed to both decrease the state\u2019s interventions and increase the state\u2019s efficiency. If it failed, Quebec would face economic catastrophe. The collective Pour un Qu\u00e9bec lucide (\u201cFor a Clear-Eyed Vision of Quebec\u201d) manifesto was published in 2005 and opens with the line: \u201cWith demographic decline and global competition threatening our future, Qu\u00e9bec cannot allow itself to be the status quo republic.\u201d\n\nCharest, Marois, Couillard and Legault: 2005-2018\n\nPeaceful management\n\nDuring the civil society outcry, Jean Charest withdrew or moderated his reform propositions. Over almost a decade (2003-2012), he simply maintained a healthy management of the province. One of the main concerns of the government was the reform of the health care system, considered expensive and inefficient, because it was responsible for an ageing society.\n\nWhile Jean Charest was in power, corruption allegations resounded more and more clearly. In 2004, the federal government established the Gomery Inquiry whose mandate was to investigate public activities and fraud cases linked to the sponsorship program the federal government created following the 1995 referendum. For its part, the provincial government created the Bastarache Commission (an inquiry commission on the process for appointing judges) in 2010 and the Charbonneau Commission (an inquiry commission charged with investigating collusion and corruption suspicions in the construction sector). In 2010, the Maclean\u2019s magazine sported the front page headline \u201cThe most corrupt province in Canada [\u2026] Why so many political scandals happen in Quebec\u201d. The Quebec Press Council blamed Maclean\u2019s for lacking in rigour and spreading biases.\n\nThe Maple Spring of 2012 \u2013 the longest student strike of the history of North America \u2013 forced the liberal government to call for an early election during which it was defeated by the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. However, the latter formed a minority government under Pauline Marois, first female premier of Quebec. Its mandate was marked by the debate on adopting the Quebec Charter of Values (an aborted attempt), a long discussion about reasonable accommodation launched in 2006.\n\nEighteen months later, in 2014, Pauline Marois\u2019 government was defeated and the liberal party under Philippe Couillard took over. The latter resumed his liberal predecessors\u2019 efforts and focused on improving access to health care and accelerating the deficit reduction.\n\nLegault: 2018-\n\nDuring the 2018 elections, the traditional parties\u2019 support collapsed and both the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and the Parti lib\u00e9ral obtained the worst numbers in their respective histories. Meanwhile, two new parties made significant breakthroughs: Qu\u00e9bec solidaire, a left-wing party founded in 2006, secured ten seats; Coalition avenir Qu\u00e9bec (CAQ), a centre-right party founded in 2011, secured 74 seats and formed a majority government.\n\nUnder the CAQ government, a number of nationalist laws touching on identity politics were passed. These include the Act Respecting the Laicity of the State (see Bill 21) and Bill 96. Bill 21 prohibits persons in positions of authority (namely judges, prosecutors, police officers and public school teachers) from wearing religious symbols while exercising their functions. The government also pushed an important reform to the Charter of the French Language through Bill 96. The latter limited the number of students able to study in anglophone CEGEPs. It also imposed French as the common language at work to medium-sized companies. Moreover, it made French the exclusive language used by the Quebec government. Controversially, both Bill 21 and Bill 96 employ the notwithstanding clause to bypass certain rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nThe CAQ's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic was controversial. Compared to the rest of Canada, Quebec suffered the highest number of deaths linked to COVID-19. For some critics, Legault's government reacted to the pandemic through particularly heavy-handed measures. It implemented multiple lockdowns and a vaccine passport for patrons accessing certain events and restaurants. Perhaps most controversially, the government introduced two curfews during the pandemic. Other critics felt that the government was not doing enough, notably by reopening schools at certain points of the pandemic. The management of long-term care centres, or CHSLDs, early on in the pandemic was also heavily criticized.\n\nSince its election, the government under Fran\u00e7ois Legault has continued to top the polls. On one hand, support for sovereignty is on a consistent decline (from 50 per cent in 2005 to less than 30 per cent in 2019) and Quebec\u2019s population is seemingly becoming weary of constitutional debates. The CAQ\u2019s autonomist ideology, which promotes the Quebecois nation without advocating independence, seems to befit the present context. On the other hand, the provincial economy is experiencing a favourable cycle. Unemployment has plummeted to its lowest rate in 50 years and the State is reading record budget surpluses.\n\nThe 2022 campaign debate mainly focused on the immigration and French language, the health system and inflation. Fran\u00e7ois Legault\u2019s CAQ was the undisputable winner of the October 2022 elections, despite some critical voices who deemed the party\u2019s election campaign rather weak. The CAQ won almost 41 per cent of the vote and elected 90 members of the National Assembly out of 125. This is the best elections result of a political party in Quebec\u2019s recent history. Compared to the CAQ, the Quebec Liberal Party elected only 21 members with 14.4 per cent of the vote while the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois barely elected 3 members with 14.6 per cent of the vote. Qu\u00e9bec solidaire managed to get 11 members elected, obtaining 15.5 per cent of the vote. \u00c9ric Duhaime\u2019s Conservative Party of Quebec received 12.9 per cent of the vote but did not get any seat in the National Assembly."}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/patriation-of-the-constitution", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nTrudeau\u2019s Referendum Campaign Promise\n\nSince the 1920s, Canadian governments had been trying and failing to agree on a way to patriate (take back from Britain) and amend (change) the country\u2019s original Constitution (the British North America Act). Six decades later, constitutional reform became one of several major Liberal initiatives. It was also the federal government\u2019s immediate response to the ongoing Quebec referendum campaign.\n\nTwo key factors predated the patriation battle of 1980\u201381. First, the failings of a half-century of diplomacy between the federal and provincial governments made negotiations between them tense and difficult. (See also Federal-Provincial Relations.) Second, the unexpected victory by Pierre Trudeau and the Liberal Party in the federal election of February 1980 ensured that a committed federalist would be leading the charge on patriating the country\u2019s constitution.\n\nIn the campaign leading up to the Quebec referendum on 20 May 1980, Trudeau\u2019s Justice Minister, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, lobbied against the wishes of Quebec separatists. He made campaign stops in small towns across the province. Meanwhile, Trudeau gave four major speeches, promising Quebecers that, \u201cWe will immediately take action to renew the Constitution and we will not stop until we have done that.\u201d His statements were vague enough to defy definition, yet inspiring enough to help swing the tide in favour of federalism.\n\nAfter conceding defeat in the referendum, Quebec Premier Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque immediately demanded that Trudeau fulfil his constitutional promise. Trudeau quickly dispatched Chr\u00e9tien to arrange a meeting with all the premiers.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharter of Rights\n\nAt this point, it was unclear how much provincial support Trudeau needed to patriate and amend the Constitution. Legally, any change required the approval of the British Parliament. By political custom and convention, however, the more the provincial governments supported the federal patriation process, the better.\n\nTrudeau assembled a group of constitutional advisers. He also drafted a set of federal demands for new, centralized powers over the economy. He wanted what he called a \u201cpeople\u2019s package\u201d added to the Constitution; it would include a new Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Trudeau also called on the premiers not to use the constitutional talks to bargain for new provincial powers; he said the talks and the Charter itself were not matters for tawdry political trade-offs.\n\nThe premiers, however, wanted to preserve or even expand provincial powers. (See Distribution of Powers.) They responded angrily to Trudeau\u2019s tactics. Still, they agreed to set in motion a uniquely Canadian event \u2014 a summer constitutional roadshow. A series of meetings were held across Canada between Cabinet ministers, senior officials and political aides. They explored the 12 agreed-upon agenda items. A formal First Ministers\u2019 conference was then held in early September.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrudeau\u2019s Ultimatum\n\nThe First Ministers conference began on 8 September 1980. It was the 10th round of negotiations on the reform of Canada\u2019s Constitution since 1927. By the time it started, the battle lines had already begun to harden. On the eve of the conference, L\u00e9vesque quietly gave the premiers a leaked copy of Ottawa\u2019s 64-page, top-secret negotiating strategy. It was known as the Kirby Memorandum, after its chief compiler, Michael Kirby, secretary to the Cabinet for federal-provincial relations. The document was leaked to the press on the second day of the conference. This further soured an already bitter mood of distrust.\n\nDuring four days under hot television lights, the premiers and the prime minister expressed (at times impressively) widely different visions of Canada. These were also discussed in private meetings. However, their intractable views led to the inevitable failure of the conference. On 2 October, following consultations with his caucus and Cabinet, Trudeau announced, to little surprise, that Ottawa would make a unilateral request to the British Parliament. Trudeau would recall Parliament early and press the resolution through by Christmas before significant opposition could be mounted.\n\nThe New Democratic Party, under leader Ed Broadbent, gave tentative approval to the plan, though it split his caucus essentially along east-west lines. The federal Conservatives, under leader Joe Clark, strongly opposed the plan. They used every procedural device at their disposal to halt the resolution; it finally went before the Supreme Court in late spring 1981. When the Liberals invoked \u201cclosure\u201d on the resolution to move it into the committee stage in Parliament, a handful of Tories rushed the Speaker\u2019s chair with fists waving, demanding to be heard.\n\nThe constitution fight offered Clark an explosive issue around which to rally his flagging leadership. It also gave him the chance to advance his view of the country as a \u201ccommunity of communities.\u201d But his position underscored a rift between the federal Tories and their influential Ontario cousins. Ontario Premier Bill Davis and New Brunswick Premier Richard Hatfield, both Conservatives, backed the prime minister\u2019s plan.\n\nPrime Minister Pierre Trudeau speaks for the federalist side, during the campaign for the 1980 Quebec Referendum on sovereignty.\n\nGang of Eight\n\nThe constitutional resolution, with the new Charter of Rights and Freedoms as its centerpiece, was offered to a special joint parliamentary committee for study. It was harshly criticized. The first parliamentary committee to have its sittings televised, it was petitioned by 914 individuals and 294 groups. It sat for more than 65 days. Largely because of its deliberations, the first Charter was significantly redrafted five times. The revisions included adding provisions on Indigenous peoples\u2019 rights; sexual equality; and equal rights for the disabled. The Conservative Party called for the addition of property rights. The Liberals rejected this proposal because of the opposition to it by their allies, the NDP.\n\nThe six provinces most strongly opposed to the plan \u2014 Quebec, Alberta, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and British Columbia \u2014 united to form a common front. The group was led by the strong-willed premiers of Quebec (Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque), Alberta (Peter Lougheed) and Manitoba (Sterling Lyon). The group eventually was joined by Saskatchewan (Allan Blakeney) and Nova Scotia (John Buchanan). This Gang of Eight mounted challenges against the resolution in provincial courts of appeal in Manitoba, Quebec and Newfoundland. They also launched a public-relations campaign against it both in Canada and in Great Britain, where they strenuously lobbied Members of Parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Courts Weigh In\n\nMeanwhile, the Patriation Reference case was weaving its way through the Supreme Court. In February 1981, the Manitoba Court of Appeal decided 3\u20132 in favour of Ottawa. In April, the Quebec Superior Court of Appeal also supported Ottawa in a 4\u20131 decision. Both courts decided that the federal government had the legal right to patriate and amend the Constitution, without provincial consent.\n\nHowever, just weeks earlier, the three justices of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland had voted unanimously against the federal procedure. The Newfoundland judgement was handed down as the House of Commons was tied in procedural knots by the Conservative opposition. At the same time, the Gang of Eight were preparing for their own conference to sign an alternative constitutional accord. Promoted largely by Lougheed, it would limit the request to Britain to simple patriation with a different amending formula.\n\nTrudeau suddenly agreed to submit his resolution to the Supreme Court for judicial settlement. But he would not meet the Gang of Eight when they arrived in Ottawa on 16 April 1981. Trudeau ridiculed their \u201cApril Accord,\u201d in which Quebec\u2019s L\u00e9vesque had agreed to an amending formula that did not provide a specific veto for his province.\n\nSupreme Court Decision\n\nOn 28 September 1981, the Supreme Court brought down its judgement. (See Patriation Reference.) It found that Ottawa was legally allowed to make this request of the British Parliament. The justices decided that the resolution offended the constitutional conventions developed in Canada over the years, but that it was not legally enforceable to prevent Ottawa from acting unilaterally. The court held by a 7\u20132 majority that no legal limit \u201cto the power of the Houses [the House of Commons and the Senate] to pass resolutions\u201d existed.\n\nHowever, the court also ruled by a 6-3 majority that any proposed amendments that would reduce provincial powers would require a \u201cconsensus\u201d of the provinces. To do otherwise would be a breach of constitutional convention. Although such practice was a matter of convention rather than law, the court argued that such conventions are of great significance. In the words of the court, \u201cConstitutional convention plus constitutional law equal the total constitution of the country.\u201d\n\nThis split decision was interpreted as a messy win for both sides. It sparked a final round of hurried negotiations and what the prime minister came to call \u201cthe one last time\u201d conference. It began in Ottawa on 2 November 1981.\n\nThe statue Justicia in front of the Supreme Court of Canada building, overlooking the Peace Tower of Parliament in Ottawa.\n\nFour Dramatic Days\n\nOn the first day of the four-day conference, the federalist side appeared to take the initiative. Premiers Bill Davis (Ontario) and Richard Hatfield (New Brunswick) offered compromise proposals. Davis proposed foregoing Ontario\u2019s traditional veto over constitutional change. Hatfield proposed holding off on implementing parts of the Charter of Rights in New Brunswick for two years. After an opening round of public statements, the first ministers and their key lieutenants continued their discussions in a private room on the top floor of the conference centre. The rancour returned on the second day; the formal conference broke up at noon. It reconvened the following day.\n\nThe Gang of Eight were in their suite at the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier hotel, across the street from the conference center. They debated a vague compromise plan put together by British Columbia Premier Bill Bennett. The plan suggested waiting to adopt much of the Charter of Rights until it could be examined by a commission. The commission would report back with recommendations at a later date. Bennett, Lougheed and Buchanan took the scheme to Trudeau. He rejected it in an angry confrontation.\n\n\u201cThe proposal by the Gang of Eight would not fly,\u201d wrote Howard Leeson, an advisor to Saskatchewan Premier Allan Blakeney. \u201cIt was general discouragement at this point that anything would ever be agreed to.\u201d\n\nA glum mood settled over some of the provincial delegations. Premiers Davis and Blakeney and their officials ran into each other that night at an Ottawa restaurant; they continued private discussions through the evening. The two groups \u2014 Ontario allied with Trudeau; Saskatchewan allied with the Gang of Eight \u2014 at least agreed, wrote Leeson, \u201cthat we must find some way to prolong the talks in order that they might succeed, but there were very few ideas.\u201d\n\nOn the third day, Manitoba Premier Sterling Lyon left the conference for the campaign trail. L\u00e9vesque also talked of leaving to attend Quebec\u2019s National Assembly. That same day, Blakeney put forth his own proposal. It was discussed around the conference table but made no real progress. Meanwhile, an off-the-cuff remark by Trudeau that perhaps only a referendum could resolve the stalemate was well received by L\u00e9vesque. This surprised the other Gang of Eight premiers. Nearly all day was then devoted to discussing a possible referendum. Trudeau emerged in the afternoon to announce to the press somewhat facetiously that there was a new Quebec\u2013Ottawa alliance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Kitchen Accord\"\n\nIn the meantime, various ministers and advisors from the different provinces had been meeting privately to discuss other options. By the end of the third day, the broad lines of a possible compromise agreement were emerging. What followed was a complex series of manoeuvres. Several individuals played key roles at crucial points.\n\nThe first step was a private meeting between three attorneys general \u2014 federal Justice Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien, Saskatchewan\u2019s Roy Romanow and Ontario\u2019s Roy McMurtry. They had traded notes earlier that morning. In the mid-afternoon, Chr\u00e9tien and Romanow slipped away to an unused kitchen pantry in the Ottawa conference center to examine some ideas. They pulled McMurtry into the room partway through the discussion. The resulting \u201ckitchen accord,\u201d as it became known, was not recorded in a formal written agreement; it was scratched by the men in rough notes on two pieces of paper.\n\nMost of the other provinces did not know about it. The accord was significant in that it shaped the expectations of the governments of Canada, Ontario and Saskatchewan. It also helped bridge the divide between the Gang of Eight and the federal government. Chr\u00e9tien, the principal federal negotiator, committed to a compromise that included a \u201cnotwithstanding clause.\u201d This would limit the force of a new Charter of Rights by allowing provinces to exempt their laws from certain Charter rights. This became a crucial element in winning enough provincial consent to forge a deal.\n\nBlakeney learned about the accord from his attorney general, Roy Romanow, on Wednesday. When the formal conference adjourned that day, Blakeney invited his Gang of Eight colleagues to meet privately later that night to discuss the matter and flesh out a more complete package. At the same time, Ontario Premier Bill Davis offered to discuss aspects of the accord, as well as various other points, with Trudeau.\n\nPage 1 of the \"Kitchen Accord,\" drafted in the kitchen of the National Conference Centre in Ottawa on 4 November 1981 by Jean Chr\u00e9tien, Roy Romanow and Roy McMurtry.\n\nPage 2 of the \"Kitchen Accord,\" drafted in the kitchen of the National Conference Centre in Ottawa on 4 November 1981 by Jean Chr\u00e9tien, Roy Romanow and Roy McMurtry.\n\nThe \u201cNight of the Long Knives\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford and his officials had prepared a draft proposal. It contained some of the ideas already floated at the conference. (See Editorial: Newfoundland\u2019s Contribution to the Patriation of the Constitution.) That night, 4 November, officials from six provinces (Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, PEI, Saskatchewan, Alberta and BC, including at times some of the premiers themselves) worked in Saskatchewan\u2019s hotel suite to refine a proposal based on the Peckford document. Items from the kitchen accord were added to make the proposal acceptable to Ontario and Ottawa. Ontario and the federal government were at this point unaware of the Newfoundland draft. At the same time, many members of the Gang of Eight did not yet know about the kitchen accord or the origins of its compromises. Despite that, vital clauses from each were melded into a single proposal.\n\nProvincial delegations that weren\u2019t represented at the meeting, including Manitoba and Ontario, were notified about the draft late that night. Ontario Premier Bill Davis was even pulled from his bed after midnight by Blakeney, who called Davis to get his support for the package.\n\nL\u00e9vesque founded the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n\nCrucially, the Quebec delegation, staying at a hotel across the Ottawa River in Quebec, was not notified during the night. It\u2019s unclear whether an attempt was made to reach L\u00e9vesque or his advisors by phone. Peckford says attempts were made, but that calls were not answered. Others say no attempt was made. \u201cThe general conclusion,\u201d according to Howard Leeson\u2019s notes, \u201cwas that Quebec could never agree with anything, and specifically would not agree to this package\u2026 Nevertheless, it was agreed that the proposal must be put to Quebec at the already scheduled 8 a.m. meeting of the Gang of Eight.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe failure to reach L\u00e9vesque that night \u2014 and instead, to present him with the completed package at a breakfast meeting on the final day of the conference \u2014 prompted L\u00e9vesque to claim that he was betrayed by the English-speaking premiers. L\u00e9vesque said they plotted against him on what became known in Quebec nationalist circles as the \u201cnight of the long knives.\u201d That portrayal would be used to fuel separatist sentiment in Quebec for years to come.\n\nPeckford presented the draft agreement to the Gang of Eight premiers at breakfast, and later to the prime minister and the other premiers at the formal conference table. After some minor adjustments, the federal government, Ontario and New Brunswick signed on, and the deed was done. L\u00e9vesque complained bitterly. He was ultimately the only premier who did not sign the deal. He tried in vain to press Trudeau to embrace the earlier referendum option.\n\nConstitution Act, 1982\n\nBy 5 November 1981, the constitutional fight was essentially over. In the next few weeks, Indigenous peoples and women\u2019s groups lobbied successfully to reinstate certain clauses that had been dropped in the late-night compromise. The resolution was sent to England for relatively quick approval through the British Parliament. Queen Elizabeth II came to Canada to proclaim the new Constitution Act at a rainy ceremony on Parliament Hill on 17 April 1982.\n\nEarlier, L\u00e9vesque had left the conference in Ottawa predicting dire consequences for Confederation. \u201c\u2019The Canadian Way,\u2019\u201d he said, mocking the phrase his fellow premiers had used to trumpet their compromise, was \u201cto abandon Quebec at the moment of crisis.\u201d\n\nIt was another five years before an agreement was reached to bring Quebec into the constitutional accord. By then the players had changed \u2014 including Quebec\u2019s premier, now Robert Bourassa and Canada\u2019s prime minister, now Brian Mulroney. However, their deal to put a Quebec premier\u2019s signature on the Constitution ultimately failed.

L\u00e9vesque founded the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, whose main objective was Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty (Canapress). PreviousNext\n\nRen\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, premier of Qu\u00e9bec 1976-85, politician, journalist, nationalist (born 24 Aug 1922 in Campbellton, NB; died 1 November 1987 in Montr\u00e9al, QC). A prominent member of Jean Lesage's Liberal Cabinet during the Quiet Revolution, L\u00e9vesque later founded the Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ), eventually bringing it to power in 1976. The PQ's main objective was Qu\u00e9bec independence, and for 15 years L\u00e9vesque was the leading champion of that ideal \u2014 holding and losing the province's first referendum on sovereignty in 1980.\n\nGasp\u00e9 Childhood\n\nL\u00e9vesque grew up in the remote, coastal town of New Carlisle, among the fishermen and farmers of the Gasp\u00e9 peninsula. Because there was no hospital there in 1922, he was born in nearby Campbellton, New Brunswick, the eldest child of Dominique L\u00e9vesque, a prominent lawyer, and Diane Dionne. Although the L\u00e9vesques were well-to-do, poverty was dire in the Gasp\u00e9 at that time. Ren\u00e9 became aware at a young age that most of the French Canadians were poorer, with smaller homes and more wretched schools, than the English Canadian families \u2014 descendants of Loyalists who had fled the American Revolution \u2014 who were the self-appointed elites of the region.\n\nA bright student who impressed his Jesuit teachers, L\u00e9vesque resolved early on at the S\u00e9minaire de Gasp\u00e9 that he was destined to be a leader. He idolized his father, who introduced him to politics, and to French and English literature \u2014 giving the boy a bilingual upbringing. When L\u00e9vesque was 14, however, his father died in hospital at the age of 48. His mother quickly remarried, the family relocated to Qu\u00e9bec City, and L\u00e9vesque drifted away from both his family and his studies.\n\nExpelled from the Coll\u00e8ge des J\u00e9suites Saint Charles Garnier for low marks, he finished his formal schooling at the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec and enrolled in the law school at Universit\u00e9 Laval, but gave up on his studies before obtaining a degree.\n\nJournalism\n\nL\u00e9vesque had discovered radio journalism in 1938, his last summer in New Carlisle. In Qu\u00e9bec City he worked at CBV, a regional Radio-Canada station. When the Second World War broke out, he was keen to get into the action, not as a soldier but as a war correspondent. Radio-Canada refused to send him, so in 1944 L\u00e9vesque found a position in London with the French section of the United States government service, Voice of America \u2014 thereby avoiding conscription by the Canadian military. He didn't get to the front lines until February 1945, joining the American armies as they crossed the Rhine and swept through the devastated remains of Germany. He was among the first US correspondents to see the horrors of the Dachau concentration camp following its liberation.\n\nThe war instilled in L\u00e9vesque a fondness for Americans (versus English Canadians), and a deep awareness of the barbarism that can flow from the extremes of nationalism. It wasn't enough to erase his own nationalist impulses, but it did temper them; he was committed throughout his life to democracy.\n\nAfter the war L\u00e9vesque returned to Radio-Canada, becoming an announcer for La voix du Canada, a news program broadcast out of Montr\u00e9al to French-speaking countries around the world. He quickly established himself as an engaging and widely-followed foreign newsman, reporting from the Korean War in 1951 and the Soviet Union in 1955. From 1956 he hosted the television series \"Point de mire\" (Focal Point) and became one of Qu\u00e9bec's most influential TV commentators. Short, balding and chain-smoking, L\u00e9vesque lacked the good looks for this emerging visual medium, but his intelligence and wit, and his ability to explain world events to a domestic audience, enabled him to become one of Qu\u00e9bec's first TV stars.\n\nIn 1947, L\u00e9vesque married Louise L'Heureux, his fianc\u00e9e from before the war, with whom he wouldhave two sons and a daughter. Surrounded by admirers in the broadcasting world, L\u00e9vesque wasn't a faithful husband, and the couple would divorce in 1978.\n\nIn 1959, L\u00e9vesque became actively involved in a strike by Radio-Canada producers, who wanted to form a union. He was dismayed by the indifference of the Diefenbaker government in Ottawa, and of his English CBC colleagues, towards the strikers' goals, which only hardened his views towards English Canada and fuelled his political aspirations. He decided journalism wasn't enough \u2014 it was time to stop covering the world, and start changing it instead.\n\nLesage Cabinet\n\nL\u00e9vesque joined Jean Lesage's Liberals in the provincial election of 1960, becoming a Member of the Legislative Assembly for Montr\u00e9al and helping to defeat the old Union nationale government. It was the beginning of the Quiet Revolution, and L\u00e9vesque became one Lesage's most popular and energetic Cabinet ministers \u2014 helping to modernize Qu\u00e9bec, to encourage its French-speaking majority to become \"masters in our own house,\" and to help ease the province away from the oppressive influence of the Roman Catholic clergy.\n\nAfter a brief stint as minister of water resources and public works, in which he fought corruption in the civil service, L\u00e9vesque was appointed minister of natural resources in 1961. He became point-man for the controversial but ultimately successful effort to nationalize the province's private electric utilities and fold them into what became the energy colossus of Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec. If Francophone Qu\u00e9becers didn't own or control big business interests in their province, L\u00e9vesque insisted, they would at least control its vast natural resources, via their government.\n\nParti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\n\nIn 1966, the Lesage government was defeated and L\u00e9vesque \u2014 increasingly nationalistic, and critical of his party's relations with the federal government \u2014 quit the Liberals the following year to found the Mouvement souverainet\u00e9-association, which in October 1968 became the Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. The move was hardly surprising. Through the 1960s, even as a Liberal minister, L\u00e9vesque had made his views on independence increasingly clear, telling the Anglophone media in Canada that he wouldn't be upset if Qu\u00e9bec separated. At the 1967 Qu\u00e9bec Liberal Party convention he had even tabled an incendiary resolution, largely unsupported by other delegates, titled \"A sovereign Quebec within a Canadian economic union.\" Meanwhile, he grew increasingly antagonistic with Pierre Trudeau, who entered federal politics in 1965 advocating a very different vision.\n\nHaving managed to unite the various groups promoting independence and a new political status for Qu\u00e9bec, L\u00e9vesque's party won 23 % of the vote in the 1970 provincial elections \u2014 although he himself failed to win a seat. Then the October Crisis erupted, and Trudeau, now prime minister, invoked the War Measures Act. L\u00e9vesque joined a coalition of prominent Qu\u00e9becers in condemning what they saw as Ottawa's anti-democratic response to the crisis. At the same time, L\u00e9vesque and his friends failed to unequivocally condemn the terror kidnappings of the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ) and the group's subsequent murder of Pierre Laporte. This allowed the PQ's critics to publicly equate the party with the FLQ, costing the PQ considerable support.\n\nIn the 1973 provincial election the Liberals won a landslide victory, and L\u00e9vesque once again failed to win himself a seat. The PQ, however, managed to become the official Opposition.\n\nPQ Comes to Power\n\nIn the next election, in 1976, L\u00e9vesque and his party faced off against the now-unpopular Liberal regime of Robert Bourassa, weary after years in power and beset by scandal and accusations of nepotism. L\u00e9vesque promised good government. He also downplayed the PQ's essential goal \u2014 sovereignty \u2014 while reassuring Qu\u00e9becers that a PQ government would commit to holding a referendum on the issue first, rather than declaring sovereignty unilaterally. The PQ won a majority of 71 seats, including one for L\u00e9vesque, who became the province's 23rd premier. He headed the first Qu\u00e9bec government committed to breaking up Confederation. The rest of Canada was stunned.\n\nDuring its first term, the new government passed several progressive measures concerning automobile insurance, rezoning of agricultural lands and the abolition of secret electoral funding. One of the most important and controversial pieces of legislation was Bill 101, the Charter of the French Language, which formalized the status of French as the official language of Qu\u00e9bec. Proclaimed lawin 1977, Bill 101 excluded English from the provincial legislature and courts, and restricted access to English schools to anyone other than children whose parents had attended English schools in Qu\u00e9bec. French schooling became compulsory for English-speaking immigrants, even those from other Canadian provinces.\n\nAlthough strongly supported by the public and the PQ, the law triggered an exodus of more than 130,000 Anglophones from the province between 1976 and 1981 . As well, a number of Montr\u00e9al-based companies, including Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, relocated their head offices to Toronto. In the ensuing years, court rulings would strike down many of the law's measures as contrary to the Constitution, including the ban on English in the legislature and courts. Eventually, children whose parents had attended English schools elsewhere in Canada, were allowed into English schools in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n1980 Referendum\n\nIn the fall of 1979, as time was running out on his government's mandate, L\u00e9vesque finally introduced in the National Assembly a plan for sovereignty-association \u2014 a politically independent Qu\u00e9bec, still economically tied to Canada. A referendum on the question was scheduled for 20 May 1980, only months after the defeat of Joe Clark's Conservatives in Ottawa, and the return to power of L\u00e9vesque's nemesis Pierre Trudeau.\n\nAfter an emotional campaign led on the \"non\" side by Liberal Opposition leader Claude Ryan and federal Cabinet minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien (with key support from Trudeau), and on the \"oui\" side by L\u00e9vesque and his ministers, the sovereigntists won only 40 percent of the vote, failing to capture even a majority of the Francophone vote. It was the hardest defeat of L\u00e9vesque's career. If there was any consolation, L\u00e9vesque believed the vote had at least legitimized the right of Qu\u00e9becers to determine their own future regarding Confederation. Ottawa had recognized that fact through its active participation in the campaign.\n\nConstitution Battle\n\nAgainst all expectations, the PQ was re-elected in 1981, with L\u00e9vesque heading his second majority government. The party may have been helped at the polls by the emergence of new battle lines pitting L\u00e9vesque and other provincial premiers against Trudeau, who had announced his intention to repatriate the Constitution from Britain and to proceed unilaterally if the provinces opposed him.\n\nTrudeau had made the vague promise, during the 1980 referendum campaign, of \"renewing\" the Constitution. Now his government was proposing new, centralized federal powers over the economy, a constitutionally-entrenched Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and a new constitutional amending formula. After months of political debate and grandstanding among Trudeau, L\u00e9vesque and the other premiers, the First Ministers, as they were called, assembled in Ottawa in November, 1981, in a final bid to settle their differences.\n\nL\u00e9vesque was one of several powerful and strong-willed premiers (along with Alberta's Peter Lougheed) \u2014 together comprising eight provinces, or the Gang of Eight \u2014 who opposed Trudeau's plans and had fought them through the courts. But huddled together in Ottawa that November, the seven English-speaking premiers in the coalition were won-over by the promise of a \"notwithstanding clause\" in the new Charter \u2014 limiting its power over provincial authority. The compromise was not enough for L\u00e9vesque, who had also insisted on constitutional recognition of Qu\u00e9bec as a \"distinct society,\" and on a constitutional veto for Qu\u00e9bec. He accused his fellow premiers of abandoning \"Qu\u00e9bec at the moment of crisis.\"\n\nWith the agreement of nine provinces, Trudeau pressed ahead. The repatriated Constitution was signed by Queen Elizabeth in the spring of 1982 \u2014 with the support of all the premiers except L\u00e9vesque, whose government represented the second-most populous province in the country. It was a detail that would bedevil the country and its First Ministers for years to come.\n\nFinal Years in Office\n\nL\u00e9vesque returned to the National Assembly to face the hard task of governing. Confronted with economic recession and spiralling provincial deficits, his government met with considerable opposition and public disapproval, including illegal public-sector union strikes, when it attempted to reduce spending to solve its grave financial problems.\n\nThere was also turmoil inside the PQ and growing doubts about L\u00e9vesque's leadership. In 1984, a party crisis erupted when L\u00e9vesque announced his intention of not fighting the next election on the issue of independence, while maintaining sovereignty-association as the party's official raison d'\u00eatre. Several important ministers resigned in protest, but the party reaffirmed L\u00e9vesque's leadership at a special convention in January 1985. Still, exhausted by years of struggle \u2014 and the defeat of his fondest political goals \u2014 L\u00e9vesque, at 62, fell into depression and was even hospitalized against his will. In June 1985 he resigned as premier.\n\nLegacy\n\nL\u00e9vesque enjoyed two years of retirement, before his heart gave out on 1 November, 1987. In that time he wrote his memoirs, which proved hugely popular. Upon his death, he was remembered across the country, by friends and foes alike, as a giant of Canadian politics.\n\nL\u00e9vesque's mark on Qu\u00e9bec, and Canada, is as indelible as any leader that province has produced: as a journalist he opened the minds of Francophone Qu\u00e9becers and awakened them to the wider world; he was a central figure of the Quiet Revolution; a creator of the energy powerhouse that became Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec; founder of the PQ and leader of Qu\u00e9bec's first openly separatist government; the angry, intransigent torch-bearer of the \"distinct society\" ideal, who refused to endorse the 1982 Constitution, leaving an open wound in the federation that festers still.\n\nThrough it all, L\u00e9vesque acknowledged that whatever injustices Qu\u00e9becers suffered inside Confederation, Canada was still a free and decent country. \"Canada's federal system,\" he once said, \"is not excessively oppressive or anything like a gulag.\" He was never the most ardent nationalist or separatist of his time, yet he fanned the flames of nationalist sentiment in pursuit of his aims. His insistence on wanting to break up the nation, in spite of the Canadian virtues he admired, are what made him such a perplexing \u2014 and often hated \u2014 figure in the minds of English-speaking Canadians, both inside Qu\u00e9bec, and elsewhere."}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/meech-lake-accord", "page_content": "Quebec and the Constitution\n\nIn 1981, the separatist Quebec government of Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque and the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois refused to sign the Constitution Act, 1982. It was patriated from Britain by the government of Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. (See Patriation of the Constitution.) L\u00e9vesque\u2019s decision, and his betrayal by the other premiers, estranged Quebec from the Canadian \u201cconstitutional family.\u201d\n\nHowever, a new political climate emerged in the mid-1980s. The Liberal government of Robert Bourassa was elected in Quebec. The Progressive Conservative government in Ottawa was led by Brian Mulroney. This new dynamic offered hope of ending the impasse. Mulroney opened discussions with all the provinces. Quebec made a series of proposals that, if accepted, would have led to its formal endorsement of the Constitution.\n\nQuebec was as legally bound as any province by the Constitution Act, 1982. The Quebec proposals would have amended this Act. As a result, they took on great significance. The Quebec proposals could be divided into two parts. The first dealt with the distinctiveness of Quebec in the Canadian federation. The second addressed various other matters. These tended to enhance the role of the provinces in their relationship with the federal government.\n\nAll the provinces initially agreed to the package under a principle of \u201cjuridical equality.\u201d This proposal became known as the Meech Lake Constitutional Accord of 1987. It was named after the lake north of Ottawa in the forested Gatineau hills. The premiers and federal leaders reached the agreement at a government retreat there named Wilson House.\n\nDistinct Society\n\nThe Accord recognized Quebec as a distinct society within Canada. It also recognized both the anglophone minority in Quebec and the francophone minority elsewhere as fundamental parts of Canada.\n\nProvincial Powers\n\nFor the first time, the provinces were given a formal role in nominating people to serve in certain federal institutions. Chief among them were the Senate and the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nFor some time, social programs falling within provincial jurisdiction (health care, for example) had largely been financed by the federal government. (See also Distribution of Powers.) Since the central government held greater taxing power, it had greater spending ability than the provinces. However, the provinces expressed concern over the conditions that were often attached to this funding. So, under the Accord, a province would be allowed to opt out of one of these programs so long as it established its own program that was compatible with the national objectives. In such a case, the federal government would finance the new provincial program with reasonable compensation.\n\nUnder the Constitution Act, 1867, the provinces and the federal government were given shared power over immigration. This led to a series of agreements on the settlement of new Canadians. The Accord gave constitutional status to those agreements. The Accord also made the federal-provincial consultative process constitutional by requiring at least one First Ministers Conference each year. The Accord also required that the issues of Senate reform and the fisheries be discussed at those meetings.\n\nConstitutional Amending Formula\n\nThe Accord slightly changed the existing method for amending (changing) the Constitution. Before the Accord, two formulas existed. The general formula required the consent of the Senate, the House of Commons and the legislatures of two-thirds (seven) of the provinces, so long as those provinces made up 50 per cent of the population of Canada. (This is the so-called 7/50 rule.)\n\nFor some specialized matters, consent was required from Parliament and all the provincial legislatures. A third section listing other specialized matters existed as well; these matters required only the general amending formula.\n\nThe Accord took this latter list of specialized matters, added a number of other issues, and moved them to the first list of specialized matters. As a result, all specialized matters (such as changes to the Senate and the creation of new provinces) would require the unanimous consent of Parliament and the provinces.\n\nReaction\n\nOpinion polls showed the Accord was popular with a majority of Canadians after it was unveiled in 1987. There was a general sense of relief in the country that Quebec would soon be brought, politically, into the constitutional fold. Many hoped this might soften separatist attitudes in that province towards the rest of Canada.\n\nIn the next three years, however, as votes on the Accord were taken in various provincial legislatures, critics emerged to savage the agreement. They were especially critical of the ways in which, in their estimation, the Accord would weaken federal power. ( See Distribution of Powers.) The most notable opponent was Pierre Trudeau. He came out of retirement to lead the attack on the Accord. He accused Mulroney of having \u201csold out\u201d to the provinces. Many in English Canada also grew uncomfortable with the \u201cdistinct society\u201d clause. They argued it would give Quebec special status in Confederation, rather than make it one of 10 equal provinces.\n\nBecause the Accord had been negotiated behind closed doors by the First Ministers \u2014 \u201c11 men in suits,\u201d as they were described \u2014 it became an unwelcome symbol of backroom political deal-making. As opposition piled up, the Accord lost favour with the public. Meanwhile, there were fears that the Accord\u2019s failure could create a backlash in Quebec, where the deal was still popular. It could therefore lead to serious national unity problems.\n\nRatification\n\nTo become law, the Accord had to be ratified within three years by Parliament and the legislatures of all 10 provinces. This was in keeping with section 41 of the Constitution Act, 1982. Quebec\u2019s National Assembly was the first to pass the required resolution of approval; it did so on 23 June 1987. The Accord then had until 23 June 1990 to receive unanimous ratification by the provinces.\n\nIn early June of 1990, all premiers finally agreed to ratify the Accord on the condition that there be further constitutional discussions on issues such as an elected Senate, the amending formula itself, equality, and Indigenous issues. Despite this agreement, the Accord unravelled on the final ratification date.\n\nIn Manitoba, all political parties had finally agreed to endorse the Accord. However, it still required public hearings. The legislature could dispense with such hearings if it had the unanimous consent of all members. But one member, Elijah Harper, withheld his consent. As a result, the Accord did not come to a vote in that province.\n\nOn the same day, wishing to give Manitoba extra time, the federal minister responsible for federal-provincial relations suggested extending the ratification date by three months. But this would require re-ratification in Quebec. This approach frustrated Premier Clyde Wells of Newfoundland and Labrador. The Newfoundland legislature had ratified the Accord in 1988. But Wells came to power the following year and became an outspoken critic of the Accord. He insisted on putting it to another vote in his legislature, or to a plebiscite in his province. In 1990, the Manitoba delay gave Wells an excuse to avoid bringing the issue to a vote. This delivered yet another blow to the Meech Lake Accord and ensured its disintegration.\n\nLegacy\n\nIn 1990, Lucien Bouchard, Mulroney\u2019s environment minister and Quebec lieutenant, walked out on the Progressive Conservative government. He was angry that the political consensus around the Accord had come apart. He was joined by a handful of disenchanted backbench Members of Parliament from Quebec. They had all been with either the PC or Liberal Party. Together, they formed the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a political party dedicated to pursuing Quebec\u2019s interests in the House of Commons.\n\nBouchard\u2019s decision was a political blow for Mulroney. At the same time, the prime minister\u2019s popularity was falling as public opinion in English Canada hardened against the Accord. This was due in part to its negative image as a deal negotiated in political backrooms. Canadians had also grown weary of the many years of constitutional wrangling. In spite of this, Mulroney pushed ahead after the death of the Meech Lake Accord. He began a new round of constitutional talks aimed at winning Quebec\u2019s consent \u2014 this time, after an exhaustive series of public consultations. The result was the Charlottetown Accord of 1992. This second agreement was eventually defeated in a national referendum.\n\nOne further attempt at constitutional change was made in 2017. Quebec\u2019s Liberal premier, Philippe Couillard, proposed having Quebec sign the constitution that year as part of Canada\u2019s sesquicentennial celebrations, Canada 150. Couillard published a 177-page proposal that echoed the points former premier Robert Bourassa had pursued in the Meech Lake Accord. However, his efforts were flatly rejected by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who replied, \u201cWe are not opening the Constitution.\u201d\n\nSee also: Meech Lake Accord: Document; Constitution of Canada; Constitutional History; Constitutional Law; Constitutional Monarchy; Constitution Act, 1867; Constitution Act, 1867 Document; Patriation Reference; Constitution Act, 1982; Constitution Act, 1982 Document; Patriation of the Constitution."}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/laurier-levesque/biography", "page_content": "Laurier L\u00e9vesque Biography\n\nCanadian politician\n\nLaurier L\u00e9vesque (October 13, 1929 \u2013 September 7, 2005) was a Canadian educator and a politician in the Province of New Brunswick.\n\nA graduate of St. Joseph's College in Memramcook and the New Brunswick Teachers' College in Fredericton, Laurier L\u00e9vesque taught school before entering political life.

Courtesy Library and Archives Canada, C-001971\n\nEducation and Early Career\n\nWilfrid Laurier studied law at McGill University. While there, he established close ties with radical members of the Parti Rouge. This included one of his professors, Toussaint-Antoine-Rodolphe Laflamme. Laurier also became vice-president (1864\u201366) of the Institut canadien; a literary society with Rouge links.\n\nAfter graduating from McGill in 1864, Laurier briefly practiced law in Montreal. In 1866, he went to live in L\u2019Avenir and then in Arthabaska, Quebec, where he ran the newspaper Le D\u00e9fricheur. Like the Liberals of Canada East (present-day Quebec), Laurier opposed Confederation. He argued that the federal government would have too much power and that French Canadians would be overwhelmed.\n\nIn 1871, the Catholic Church in Quebec, led by Bishop Bourget, was ferociously attacking the Rouges and liberalism. In response, Laurier became the Liberal member for Drummond-Arthabaska in the Quebec legislature. Earlier, he had embraced radical liberalism; but now he became more moderate. He hoped this would be more acceptable to the Catholic clergy. (See also Wilfrid Laurier Speech: Parliamentary Debut, 1871.)\n\nLike many other Liberals, Laurier also decided to accept Confederation as a fait accompli and to work within the new system. In 1874, he resigned his provincial seat and ran for election to the House of Commons. He held his seat in Ottawa uninterrupted for some 45 years.\n\nWilfrid Laurier, as an MP in 1874. (courtesy William James Topley/Library and Archives Canada/PA-026430)\n\nFederal Politics\n\nIn October 1877, months after giving a vigorous speech in defence of liberalism, Laurier was appointed minister of inland revenue in Alexander Mackenzie\u2019s Cabinet. Laurier was the most prominent Liberal from his province. He became the recognized leader of the Quebec wing of the party. However, his party\u2019s defeats in the elections of 1878 and 1882 curbed his ambitions. He was re-elected in Qu\u00e9bec-Est; but he took less interest in political debate.\n\nIn 1885, Laurier\u2019s ardour was aroused by the hanging of Louis Riel. He vigorously defended the cause of the M\u00e9tis leader and the need to unite the French and English in Canada. (See also Wilfrid Laurier Speech: In Defence of Louis Riel, 1874.) In 1887, Edward Blake was disappointed by the recent electoral defeat. He chose Laurier to succeed him as leader of the Liberal Party, despite the opposition of various eminent Liberals. They believed Laurier was too easygoing and too physically weak to be an effective leader. (Laurier suffered from chronic bronchitis for much of his life.) They also feared that Ontarians would associate him with Riel, and that Catholic clergy in Quebec still viewed him as a radical.\n\nWilfrid Laurier, 1882. Library and Archives Canada / C-001965 | (courtesy Library and Archives Canada / C-001965)\n\nLeader of the Liberal Party\n\nFrom 1887 on, Laurier devoted himself to building a truly national party and to gradually regaining power. His efforts were divided into two distinct phases. In the first and less successful, 1887\u201391, he pursued the policy of unrestricted reciprocity with the United States. Announced in 1888, the program was rejected in the 1891 general election. Laurier was perceived as a continentalist and as anti-British. He was rejected by the Canadian electorate; but for the first time since 1874, Liberals won a majority of the seats in Quebec.\n\nThe second more fruitful phase took place between 1891 and 1896. This was the period when Laurier, more sure of himself, built a strong national Liberal Party. At the time, the Conservatives were mired in difficulties after the death of Sir John A. Macdonald. In 1893, Laurier organized an impressive political convention in Ottawa; there, the party approved a new program and the basis for a truly national structure.\n\nIn the 1896 election, the education rights of the Catholic minority in Manitoba became an important issue. In 1890, Manitoba Liberals had established a uniform school system in place of the separate school system enjoyed to that point. This prompted protest from the Catholic minority. (See Manitoba Schools Question.) Laurier avoided taking a definite stand; but French Canadians believed he would be more supportive of minority rights than the Conservatives. On 23 June 1896, Canadians chose Laurier over Conservative Charles Tupper to lead the country as prime minister. (See also Wilfrid Laurier Speech: \u201cSunny Ways,\u201d 1895.)\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister of Canada\n\nContrary to the expectations of many French Canadians, Laurier did not champion the minority rights of Catholics in Manitoba. Instead, his focus as prime minister was on the country\u2019s development and on healing the wounds to national unity. In 1896, he signed the Laurier-Greenway agreement. It decided the fate of educational rights for Manitoba\u2019s Catholic minority. This group would never again have the separate schools it enjoyed prior to 1890; although it would be possible to obtain religious instruction during the last half-hour of the school day and instruction in a language other than English. (See also History of Education; Francophone-Anglophone Relations; Francophones of Manitoba.)\n\nIn the name of national harmony and the politics of the \u201clesser evil,\u201d Laurier launched his policies of compromise. (See Sir Wilfried Laurier: The Politics of Compromise.) This approach kept him in power for many years. But it never completely redressed the wrongs committed against the Catholic minority.\n\nLaurier adopted a similar approach to relations with Britain. Shortly after becoming prime minister, he began to reorganize the immigration system with Clifford Sifton. With William Fielding, he finalized the details of a tariff policy based on imperial preference. In 1897, Laurier went to London, England, to participate in his first colonial conference. He also received a knighthood.\n\nA statue of Sir Wilfrid Laurier (the seventh Prime Minister of Canada from July 11, 1896, to October 7, 1911) shot against the roof of the east wing of the parliament buildings in Ottawa.\n\nGuided by his desire for Canada\u2019s independence, Laurier resisted every effort Britain made toward federation of the empire in political, economic, or military terms. (See also Commonwealth.) Nonetheless, in 1899, he agreed to help defray the costs of transportation and mat\u00e9riel of Canadians wishing to fight for England in the South African War. This conciliatory stance was criticized by French Canadians who were fiercely opposed to any participation. However, Laurier and his Liberals easily won the 1900 election. They were well supported by Quebec; it gave the Liberals 57 of its 65 seats. Laurier\u2019s personal popularity in Quebec likely played a key role in this result.\n\nAfter this victory at the polls, Laurier led his country forcefully. Within cabinet, he directed policy and did not hesitate to push aside dissenters; these included the powerful Isra\u00ebl Tarte, who was forced to resign in 1902. That same year, Laurier also commanded attention outside the country. At the colonial conference in London, he again opposed all proposals to unify the Empire. In 1903, shortly after the failure of the Alaska Boundary discussions with the US, Laurier revealed the most important policy of his second term; the construction of a second transcontinental railway.\n\nSir Wilfrid Laurier (courtesy Library and Archives Canada / C-015568).\n\nThe Transcontinental Railway\n\nThe Grand Trunk Pacific Railway would build the section from Winnipeg westward. The federal government would undertake the construction of a line (called the National Transcontinental) from Moncton and Quebec City to Winnipeg. Laurier was so optimistic about the nation\u2019s progress that he allowed the Canadian Northern Railway to build a third transcontinental line. By agreeing to multiple railways, much of it at public expense, Laurier mortgaged the future with a heavy financial burden. At the peak of his prestige, he allowed nothing to check his ambitions. Canadians re-elected him with a comfortable majority on 3 November 1904. (See also Wilfrid Laurier Speech: Canada\u2019s Century, 1904.)\n\nThe Creation of Alberta and Saskatchewan\n\nIn 1905, Laurier succeeded in adding two new provinces to the Dominion of Canada: Alberta and Saskatchewan. (See also Wilfrid Laurier Speech: Let Them Become Canadians, 1905.) However, the addition of these provinces also meant that a decision had to be made regarding the educational rights of the Catholic minority. Once again, Laurier yielded to pressure from anglophones and Protestants. But in deferring to the status quo of one uniform school system, he deprived a minority group of separate schools. As a result, the last chance to establish genuine cultural duality throughout Canada was lost.\n\nOffended by this retreat, French Canadian nationalists bitterly criticized Laurier. His prestige in Quebec began to fade. This led to the progressive decline of the Laurier government. In the years that followed, Laurier mainly sought to counter accusations of corruption and patronage within his administration and to rebuild his Cabinet.\n\nIn the 1908 general election, Canadians once again entrusted him with their destiny. His party\u2019s majority was somewhat reduced, but it was still quite strong in Quebec. After 1908, Laurier focused his attention primarily on two bills. They ultimately led to his defeat.\n\nSir Wilfrid Laurier, campaigning.\n\nControversial Policies and Defeat at the Polls\n\nIn 1910, the Naval Service Act established a Canadian navy of five cruisers and six destroyers. They would be ready to fight with Great Britain anywhere in the world. However, this was insufficient in the eyes of English Canadian imperialists. French Canadian nationalists led by Henri Bourassa, meanwhile, considered it excessive. This moderate measure would cost Laurier precious support, especially in Quebec.\n\nThe second bill concerned reciprocity with the US; the old Liberal dream of 1891. Brought to the Commons early in 1911, it permitted the free trade of most natural products; but only a small number of manufactured products. Despite the attractions of the plan, it raised the ire of Canadian industrialists. As such, it provided a weakness for the Conservative Party under Robert Borden to exploit. They accused the Liberals of disloyalty toward England and of leading the country toward political annexation. To settle the issue, Laurier called a general election. On 21 September 1911, he suffered a bitter defeat.\n\nLaurier ran successful campaigns for prime minister in 1896, 1900, 1904 and 1908. (courtesy Library and Archives Canada/C-5598)\n\nLeader of the Opposition\n\nLaurier proved to be an energetic and vigilant leader of the Opposition. He failed to adapt his liberalism as progressive Liberals would have wished; but he kept his troops united until at least 1916. He also relentlessly attacked the Borden government\u2019s failure to address problems such as the rising cost of living. (See Standard of Living.)\n\nLaurier achieved some success in rebuilding the Liberal Party. Prior to 1914, he fought mainly against the emergency contribution of $35 million offered to Great Britain to help strengthen its navy. He also opposed the financial assistance given to the Canadian Northern Railway. In 1916, he defended the rights of Franco-Ontarians to bilingual instruction in schools. This increased his popularity among French Canadians. (See also Wilfrid Laurier Speech: Faith Is Better than Doubt and Love Is Better than Hate, 1916.)\n\nOut of personal conviction, Laurier vigorously supported Canadian participation in the First World War. He ardently promoted voluntary enrolment and proposed a political truce. In 1915\u201316, at age 75, he held several recruiting meetings. In 1917, the country was plunged into national crisis following the imposition of military conscription. Laurier again turned to compromise. To save Canada\u2019s threatened unity, he refused to support this measure, which was so repulsive to Quebec; instead, he proposed a referendum and continued voluntary enlistment. This time, however, his proposal was not supported by the majority of English Canadians. The formula collapsed in general bitterness.\n\nLaurier was opposed by English Canadians and idolized by French Canadians; he became a symbol of division within the country. His own party disintegrated when several eminent English Canadian Liberals crossed the floor to join the Union Govenment. Laurier refused to participate. In the general election of December 1917, he was overwhelmingly defeated by Borden\u2019s Unionist Party. The vote was divided along distinctly cultural lines.\n\nAfter the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918 and the First World War came to an end, Laurier began his attempts to restructure his party and to rebuild Canadian unity; but he died on 17 February 1919.\n\n\n\n\n\nLegacy\n\nUnder Laurier\u2019s leadership, Canada successfully continued to industrialize and urbanize. It was strengthened by the addition of two provinces and two million inhabitants. A clever and eloquent politician, Laurier was a true legend in his time. He has been judged in a variety of ways. For some, he was the spiritual successor to Sir John A. Macdonald, who pursued and consolidated Confederation. For others, Laurier, in the name of national unity and necessary compromise, too often sacrificed the interests of French-Canadian Catholics to those of the majority. Conversely, some think he too often governed the country with only Quebec\u2019s interests in mind. Support for each of these opinions can be found in Laurier\u2019s actions in Ottawa; but the last view is most open to argument.\n\nSee also Canada\u2019s Century: Sir Wilfrid Laurier\u2019s Bold Prediction; Wilfrid Laurier House National Historic Site of Canada; Collection: Sir Wilfrid Laurier; Timeline: Sir Wilfrid Laurier; Education Guide: Sir Wilfrid Laurier; Timeline: Elections and Prime Ministers.\n\n\n\n"}]}
