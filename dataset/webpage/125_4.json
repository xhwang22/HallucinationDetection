At last, the Second City can chant \u2018We\u2019re No. 1\u2032 without fear of flying too high.\n\nWith only a few minutes \u2014 but no doubt \u2014 left in the game, the bitterly cold streets up north in Chicago began to fill with warm bodies and the sound of car horns. Fans across the city gravitated toward the Rush Street area, and once the game was over, auto traffic on the Near North Side was at a standstill. Pedestrian traffic was little better.\n\nIn the Loop, those who braved the frozen Daley Plaza danced in the cold as the \u201cSuper Bowl Shuffle\u201d played larger than life on the giant screen behind them.\n\n[ Paul Sullivan: The Chicago Bears\u2019 Super Bowl XX victory may be their last championship, but their fans set the template on how to celebrate ]\n\nBears' head coach Mike Ditka was speaking of them \u2014 and hundreds of thousands of other people like them, football players and fans alike \u2014 when he told his victory press conference that \"A lot of dreams have been fulfilled, and a lot of frustrations have ended.\"\n\nThe Bears, once hoisted aloft, can simply put one foot on the Picasso, another on the Sears Tower and step right up to the Chicago cloud, where team founder George Halas will be waiting. Or they can go the route linebacker Mike Singletary has mapped out.\n\n\"I'm so happy,\" Singletary said, \"I feel like I could jump on top of the Superdome.\"\n\nChicago can jump for joy, knowing the only thing that risks being overturned is the applecart that said professional football was supposed to be a serious game. Even the Super Bowl became no more than a laugh and an \"arf\" for the Grabowskis of the Midway.\n\n\"I'm supposed to be on top of the world,\" said quarterback Jim McMahon, \"but I just feel like it's another ballgame.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs thousands of Chicagoans among the sellout crowd of 73,818 barked their encouragement, the Bears were able to turn the headline event on America's sporting program into just another dog-and-pony show. What other Super Bowl was followed by fans boogeying in stadium aisles as their team's music video was played on a giant screen above one end zone?\n\n\"I'll be doing a little shuffling myself tonight,\" McMahon said.\n\nSuperlatives will rain down on the Bears like the shredded paper the city has collected for Monday's parade in downtown Chicago. Yet Super Bowl XX can still be remembered as much for a rolling Refrigerator and a quarterback whose headbands unwittingly let us know what planet he is from.\n\n\"Pluto\" read one of the headbands McMahon wore, to honor a friend with that nickname. Moving the proceedings to outer space seemed only fitting, because this football team is plainly out of this world.\n\nTheir \"Star Wars\" defense, also known as the \"46,\" reduced the Patriots to puppy chow. The offense underlined the defense's contribution by putting the same magic number on the scoreboard. Added together, the Bears played like a million.\n\n\"Today history was set,\" Singletary said. \"I think we're one of the best teams of all time.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey finished the season with an 18-1 record, matching the 1984 San Francisco 49ers for the second-best mark in league history. Only a loss to Miami kept them away from invincibility in the record books. Only a fool would dare deny their invincibility on the field.\n\nThis is a team for Chicago and a team for the ages.\n\n\"Defense is what makes Chicago teams,\" said defensive end Richard Dent, the Super Bowl's Most Valuable Player after forcing two fumbles and getting in on 1 1/2 of the team's 7 sacks. \"If we're not one of the best teams of all time, I'd like to see the others.\"\n\n\"I don't think the 1963 defense, as good as it was, could stand up to these guys,\" said Ditka, an end on Chicago's last championship football team. The Bears set Super Bowl records for most points scored, biggest margin of victory and fewest yards allowed rushing. Seven yards is what New England gained on the ground.\n\n\"We're the best of all time,\" said Bears' safety Dave Duerson. \"Just look at the total yards (408-123).\"\n\nThe Bears also drove starting New England quarterback Tony Eason to the sidelines. \"Neither injury nor sickness,\" said the official report on Eason, who had been suffering with an intestinal virus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExpand Autoplay Image 1 of 14 With an escort from Otis Wilson (55), Bears' Wilber Marshall (58) steams into the endzone in the fourth quarter after scooping up a fumble 52 yards upfield during the NFC Championship game with the Los Angeles Rams at Soldier Field on Jan. 12, 1986. (Bob Langer / Chicago Tribune)\n\nIt was simply time for him to leave, because only a man with a strong stomach could bear to watch what Buddy Ryan's defense was doing to him.\n\nNew England's first six possessions, the ones with Eason at quarterback, gained zero, minus-10, minus-7, minus-5, minus-1 and minus-13 yards. By then, late in the second quarter, the score was 20-3 and Steve Grogan was being fed to Danimal and Ming the Merciless and the rest of the Junkyard Dogs.\n\n\u201cI was ready for Bourbon Street in the third quarter,\u201d said Bears\u2019 defensive tackle Steve McMichael.\n\n\"We made them look better than they are today,\" Grogan said.\n\nFew could bear looking at the pounding Grogan took. The defensive highlights of this game are unsuitable for viewing by children. A Sam Peckinpah movie doesn't have as much violence.\n\n\"The Monsters of the Midway have really returned,\" said National Football League commissioner Pete Rozelle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey came back in the guise of \"Grabowskis,\" an ethnic identity created by Ditka as contrast to the waspy, button-down image projected by the NFL. They put a major appliance at running back and a headband case at quarterback and whistled a loony tune as they worked their way to the top of the heap.\n\nBest of all, they refused to change their tune in either the week leading up to Super Bowl or the game itself.\n\nWilliam \"the Refrigerator\" Perry, the defensive tackle who landed on the nation\u2019s consciousness with the full force of his 305 pounds, added another dimension to his ever-growing legend by trying a pass.\n\nSo what if Perry was sacked as he swept right? It was the first time in history a Refrigerator had rolled out without wheels.\n\nPerry also was used as a decoy, sort of like sneaking a mouse by a cat, as McMahon carried for the first of his two touchdown runs. The Fridge got his chance to carry the load \u2014 himself and the football \u2014 on a 1-yard touchdown run in the third quarter.\n\nWilliam Perry gets ready to spike the ball after scoring a touchdown during Super Bowl XX. (Ed Wagner/Chicago Tribune)\n\nJust think of that a minute. Walter Payton didn't score in the Super Bowl, but the Refrigerator did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo did McMahon, making points for both the team and his esteem. He chose to wear a variety of headbands promoting worthy causes, including the Juvenile Diabetes Fund, POW-MIA, Children's Hospital, and United Way. His last,\n\n\"Pluto,\" was for his best friend, Dan Plater, whose football career was ended by a head injury.\n\nMcMahon wasn't entirely out of character, though. He played with the same gloves in the indoor arena that he had worn to combat the elements in the two playoff games at Soldier Field.\n\n\"It was fun in the huddle,\" McMahon said.\n\nIt was fun everywhere for the Bears. Reggie Phillips and Henry Waechter, both rarely-used reserves, made their way into the Super Bowl record book by, respectively, returning an interception for a touchdown and getting a safety. \"This is great for Chicago fans,\" Ditka said. \"They have been shellshocked for a number of years.\"\n\nThis time, only the opposition felt that way. New England saw stars. The Bears reached them."}, {"url": "https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/bears-beat-patriots-in-super-bowl-xx", "page_content": "On January 26, 1986, in New Orleans, Louisiana, the Chicago Bears score a Super Bowl record number of points to defeat the New England Patriots, 46-10, and win their first championship since 1963.\n\nLed by Coach Mike Ditka, a tight end for the Bears during their 1963 NFL Championship win, Chicago won 17 of 18 games to reach the championship match-up with the Patriots, who became only the fourth wild-card team in history to advance to the Super Bowl. After Tony Franklin kicked a 36-yard field goal only one minute and 19 seconds into the game, New England took the quickest lead in Super Bowl history. It was mostly downhill for the Patriots from there, as the Bears built a 23-3 lead by halftime, gaining a total of 236 yards, compared with New England\u2019s minus 19. The young Patriots quarterback, Tony Eason, had zero completions in six passes, was sacked three times and fumbled once before being replaced by Steve Grogan near the end of the first half.\n\nThe mighty Bears defense made a crucial impact on the game, causing six Patriot turnovers (four of which led to touchdowns) and holding New England to a total of only seven rushing yards all game. The Bears were hot on offense as well, as quarterback Jim McMahon completed 12 of 20 passes for 256 yards and no interceptions. Defensive tackle William \u201cThe Refrigerator\u201d Perry had one of the game\u2019s most memorable moments, running in a one-yard touchdown and spiking the ball in celebration. The celebrated Chicago running back Walter Payton carried 22 times for 61 yards but did not score, the one disappointment in an otherwise triumphant game for the Bears.\n\nWhen the game was over, the Bears had set a new NFL record for margin of victory (36 points), bettering the mark of 29 set by the Los Angeles Raiders when they beat the Washington Redskins 38-9 in Super Bowl XVIII. The Bears' defensive end Richard Dent, who contributed one and a half of Chicago\u2019s record seven sacks, was named the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl XX, becoming only the fourth defender to win the honor."}, {"url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/history/ct-vintage-chicago-tribune-newsletter-chicago-bears-super-bowl-1986-20220210-v5k4paerzjebllnjghsvt7gvbq-story.html", "page_content": "Thank you for supporting our journalism.

After Arizona's last game, Thayer drove from Phoenix to Platteville, Wis., to begin training camp with the Bears.\n\nII: The Bears spent three days during the first of two weeks between the NFC Championship Game and Super Bowl practicing indoors at the University of Illinois in Champaign.\n\nIII: The Bears taped \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\" at the Park West in Chicago on Tuesday, Dec. 3, hours after landing in Chicago following their only loss of the season, a 38-24 defeat on Monday Night Football in Miami. Walter Payton and Jim McMahon taped their portions later via a green screen in a racquetball court at Halas Hall. \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\" sold more than half a million copies and was nominated for a Grammy Award.\n\nIV: The Bears opened the season 12-0, but they were nearly 0-1. They trailed the Buccaneers 28-17 at halftime of their season opener at Soldier Field before rallying for a 38-28 victory. Early in the second half, Leslie Frazier intercepted a pass that was deflected by Richard Dent and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown to fuel the comeback.\n\nV: After William Perry rushed for two touchdowns and caught a TD pass during the regular season, the Bears gave the Fridge a chance to throw a touchdown pass in the Super Bowl. On second-and-goal from the 5 late in the first quarter, Perry took a handoff from Jim McMahon and rolled to his right. But seeing that tight end Emery Moorehead was well covered in the end zone, Perry wisely pulled down the ball and was tackled for a one-yard loss.\n\nVI: Running back Tony Collins led the Patriots in rushing in Super Bowl XX with four yards on three carries. The Bears held New England to seven yards on the ground, a Super Bowl record that still stands.\n\nVII: Tony Eason became the first starting quarterback in Super Bowl history who didn't complete a pass. He was replaced by veteran Steve Grogan after going 0-of-6 with three sacks.\n\nVIII: The '85 Bears sent a franchise-record nine players to the Pro Bowl in Jimbo Covert, Richard Dent, Dave Duerson, Dan Hampton, Jay Hilgenberg, Jim McMahon, Walter Payton, Mike Singletary and Otis Wilson. Because they flew directly from New Orleans to Hawaii, the Bears' Pro Bowlers were unable to participate in the team's championship parade in Chicago.\n\nIX: Three members of the 1985 Bears defense became NFL head coaches: Linebackers Ron Rivera and Mike Singletary and cornerback Leslie Frazier. The total increases to four if you count Jeff Fisher, who spent the '85 season as a pseudo assistant under defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan while on injured reserve.\n\nX: In Super Bowl XX, the Patriots gained positive yards on only one of their first 16 plays, a 3-yard run by Craig James. The 15 plays that failed to produce positive yards consisted of three sacks, seven incomplete passes and five runs for zero or negative yards.\n\nXI: Four members of the 1985 Bears later played for the arch rival Green Bay Packers: Quarterbacks Jim McMahon (1995-96) and Mike Tomczak (1991), defensive tackle Steve McMichael (1994) and linebacker Jim Morrissey (1993). McMahon won a Super Bowl ring with Green Bay in 1996 as Brett Favre's backup but wore his Bears jersey to the White House when the Packers were honored by President Bill Clinton.\n\nXII: Seven starters on the 1985 Super Bowl championship team were selected by the Bears in the 1983 NFL Draft: Tackle Jimbo Covert and receiver Willie Gault in the first round, cornerback Mike Richardson in the second, safety Dave Duerson in the third, guard Tom Thayer in the fourth, and defensive end Richard Dent and guard Mark Bortz in the eighth.\n\nXIII: The Patriots took the quickest lead in Super Bowl history on Tony Franklin's 36-yard field goal with just 1:19 elapsed. The kick came after New England had recovered a Walter Payton fumble on the second play of the game. Ironically, the Bears broke the record 21 years later when Devin Hester returned the opening kickoff of Super Bowl XLI for a touchdown.\n\nXIV: Coordinator Buddy Ryan named his famous \"46\" defense after the jersey number worn by hard-hitting safety Doug Plank. But Plank's eight-year career with the Bears ended in 1982 and no member of the 1985 championship team wore No. 46.\n\nXV: Cornerback Leslie Frazier was just entering his prime in 1985, when the 26-year-old led the Bears with six interceptions. But Super Bowl XX would be the last game of Frazier's career; he blew out his left knee after taking a handoff from Keith Ortego on a punt return late in the second quarter. As defensive backs coach with the Colts in 2006, Frazier won a second ring when Indianapolis defeated the Bears in Super Bowl XLI.\n\nXVI: During a media session a few days before the Super Bowl, William Perry told reporters that he had declined an offer to star in a movie with singer Cyndi Lauper. The script called for Lauper to play a wrestler and the Fridge to be her bodyguard.\n\nXVII: While the Patriots had a nightly curfew in New Orleans, Bears players didn't have to be in their hotel rooms by a certain time until the night before the Super Bowl. \"We intend to party a bit,\" defensive lineman Dan Hampton said upon arriving in town. \"That's part of the reward of getting here. We're going to come down here, have fun and try to win a football game.\"\n\nXVIII: Bears defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan had already won a Super Bowl ring 16 years earlier as defensive line coach with the New York Jets, who shocked the heavily-favored Baltimore Colts behind brash quarterback \"Broadway\" Joe Namath in Super Bowl III.\n\nXIX: The '85 Bears were so popular that the team's offensive line and key reserves had their own posters entitled \"The Black and Blues Brothers\" and \"Second to None,\" respectively."}, {"url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/1985-bears-win-super-bowl-xx/", "page_content": "By Chris Emma--\n\n(CBS) It was 30 years ago Tuesday that the 1985 Bears reached immortality.\n\nOn Jan. 26, 1986, the Chicago Bears pounded the New England Patriots, 46-10, at the New Orleans Super Bowl to win Super Bowl XX, the franchise's first Super Bowl victory.\n\nThe Bears finished the regular season nearly unblemished at 15-1, showing their dominance along the way. The sensational season culminated with one of the most lopsided victories in Super Bowl history.\n\nThe Patriots struck first with a field goal, but the Bears answered with six points from Kevin Butler. From there, it was all Chicago. Fullback Matt Suhey ran 11 yards for a touchdown at the end of the first quarter, and quarterback Jim McMahon added a two-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. The rout was on from there.\n\nUp 37-3 in the third quarter, coach Mike Ditka elected for William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry to take it in from a yard out and a seminal Super Bowl moment. Fittingly, the defense had its say, too, when Henry Waechter sacked Steve Grogan in the end zone for a safety.\n\nIn the end, the Super Bowl XX final score stated Bears 46, Patriots 10, a score that represented the greatness of one of the NFL's most unstoppable teams.\n\nNow 30 years later, the legends of that team still live on in Chicago.

(Mitch Friedman/Chicago Bears)\n\nYou can probably remember at least one thing about some of the Chicago Bears who played on the 1985 team \u2013 Walter Payton, Mike Singletary, Kevin Butler and William \u201cRefrigerator\u201d Perry. But what happened to them and their coaches after they won Super Bowl XX on Jan. 26, 1986?\n\nSome are enduring debilitating conditions as a result of injuries during their playing days. One has turned to medical marijuana to ease his lingering pain. Another has agreed to donate his brain to science after death. One became a doctor who specializes in treating patients in rehabilitation and has consulted on the care for his former teammates. Several players have become coaches themselves - the most unexpected being a guy who was on injured reserve the entire 1985 season, Jeff Fisher. Another coached in Super Bowl 50. And whatever happened to the lesser-known men on the team from that season? One reconstructs bridges in Dallas, and another restores roofs in Grapevine, Texas.\n\nHere they are in alphabetical order:\n\n(Mitch Friedman/Chicago Bears)\n\nBrad Anderson - #86\n\nWide receiver (injured reserve)\n\nYears with the Bears: 1984-1985\n\nAppeared in 15 games, mostly on special teams.

His family filed a lawsuit in February 2012 against the NFL alleging that the league had known for decades that concussions from football cause brain damage but concealed that information.

The Bears won the Super Bowl 46-10 in an awesome display of football encompassing all the joy and fury of an awesome season. Their destruction of the New England Patriots was so complete it went beyond Super Bowl proportions and recalled only their record 73-0 victory by the Bears in the 1940 NFL championship game. The Bears have a tradition that transcends Super Bowls and Sunday they ended years of frustration for their city and themselves and showed a nation they play better than they talk or sing.\"\n\nBernie Lincicome, Chicago Tribune\n\nComments: \"No more tears. Only laughter. Tomorrow is a friend. A Chicago team can keep a promise. Mission accomplished. Say it was only a football game. Say it was the football game. It was more. It was redemption, it was vindication, it was a great civic aspirin. All the years, all the wait, all the alibis. Gone. Stomped into the lint of the Superdome, stuffed into the three-cornered hat of a Yankee imposter that drew the short straw in the Super Bowl, way down yonder, down on the levee, the day Chicago lived.\"\n\nBob Verdi, Chicago Tribune\n\nComments: \"In the end, their bite was even better than their bark. And they weren't just a bunch of hot dogs selling hamburgers. And that bit of shuffling they did a month ago was destiny, not a distraction. In this place that invented jazz, the fat lady sang early Sunday, before halftime. In this town with all the one-way streets, the Bears paved another Sunday. With only a roof separating them from a full moon, the best team in football, perhaps one of the best teams ever in football, won Super Bowl XX.\"\n\nRay Sons, Chicago Sun-Times\n\nComments: \"If heaven has cures for an old man's hips, George Halas surely must be dancing a jig upstairs.
