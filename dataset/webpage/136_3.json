{"Paul Caddis was named in the PFA League One Team of the Year in 2012\u201313.": [{"url": "http://www.swindon-town-fc.co.uk/Person.asp?PersonID=CADDISPA", "page_content": "\n\nThen captain of the Scotland under-21 team, Caddis joined the Town on a three-year deal in August 2010, after Swindon agreed an initial combined fee of \u00a3350,000 for the defender and Simon Ferry with Celtic after an initial offer, was turned down - the deal including clauses that could potentially have taken the fee up to \u00a3600,000. The capture of Caddis ended an eight-month pursuit by manager Danny Wilson, who had attempted to sign him during the previous transfer window in January, and again on loan before the season was out.\n\n\n\nAfter sitting out the first game of the season, Caddis made his Town debut in the Carling Cup against Leyton Orient, before making his league bow in a 2-2 draw at Hartlepool that Saturday, with Swindon coming back from two down to draw 2-2. Battling for the right-back berth with Kevin Amankwaah, Caddis remained in the side until the end of August, when he missed a goalless draw at Carlisle whilst on international duty. When he returned, initially he found himself dropped to the bench, before returning the following weekend for a win at Walsall in a central midfield role. At the beginning of August, Caddis played on the right-side of midfield at Dagenham - before his final under-21 appearance for Scotland again saw him dropped to the bench, though he soon returned. Wilson seemed to prefer Caddis in a midfield position - despite an injury to Amankwaah keeping him out of the side, youngster Nathan Thompson and Scott Cuthbert (usually a centre back) were both played at right-back, with Caddis in midfield or out of the side completely. After spending the whole of November on the bench - a period in which he was called up to the Scotland senior side for the first time - Caddis finally returned to a right-back role at the end of the month for an FA Cup tie at Crawley, and after giving a good performance, he kept this position right through until the end of January, when defeat at fellow relegation candidates Bristol Rovers prompted Wilson to make wholesale changes to his lineup. Two games later, Caddis was recalled - and he netted his first senior goal in a 3-2 defeat at Bournemouth, with a good solo effort.\n\n\n\nFrom that point on, Caddis was ever-present until the end of the season - and despite the Town slumping to the bottom of the table, the Scot was one of the more consistent performers - picking up the Supporters' Club Away Fans Player of the Year award. Over the close-season, new boss Paolo di Canio also hailed his consistency, and naming Caddis as one of his four 'leaders' on the pitch - di Canio also praised Caddis' versatility, hinting that he might utilise him further up the pitch in midfield. This proved not to be the case though - instead, Caddis was almost ever-present in the right back position, and he was joined on the right side by Matt Ritchie, who switched over from the left flank - and the two linked up superbly, the pairing arguably the most feared in League Two. After initially missing out on the captaincy to Oliver Risser, di Canio handed it to Caddis after injury to Risser early in September - when the Namibian returned though, di Canio announced that Caddis would retain the role for the rest of the season.\n\n\n\nThe Caddis and Ritchie partnership was crucial as Swindon climbed the League Two table after a poor start and also progressed in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy - Caddis himself getting in on the act with a couple of superb goals in December - the first an equaliser at Southend in the JPT which won the 'Ultimate Finish Award' for the best goal of the round, which was followed up the following Saturday with a superb forty yard run and low strike against Bristol Rovers. With the transfer window looming, Ipswich were rumoured to have made a double bid for both Caddis and Ritchie - a suggestion that chairman Jeremy Wray was quick to quash. Caddis netted his third goal in a month at the beginning of January with a curled free-kick against Wimbledon, then in February, Swindon reached the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final - Caddis stating that leading the Town out at Wembley would be one of the highlights of his football career.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn't to be - after Caddis netted his fourth of the season from the penalty spot at Hereford, and a ten match winning run was brought to an end by local rivals Oxford, Caddis limped out just fifteen minutes into the Town's next match against Dagenham - and though initial scan results on an ankle injury suggested that it wasn't too serious, he suffered a setback after returning to light training. In total, Caddis missed eight games over almost six weeks - and though the Town recorded five victories and six clean sheets without him, his absence was notable, particularly for Matt Ritchie - without the support down the right flank, the Town's attacking play was missing a dimension - and also at Wembley, where the Town were defeated by Chesterfield.\n\n\n\nWhen Caddis did return in mid-April, he came back into a side on the brink of promotion - and a narrow victory over Plymouth in his first game left the Town needing just a point to confirm their ascent to League One. For a moment, it looked like it would be Caddis who sealed it - 1-0 down at Aldershot, the Town skipper netted an equaliser from the penalty spot in front of 1,200 travelling fans - only for the Shots to win the game. Promotion was eventually assured on the following Saturday, despite a 3-1 defeat at Gillingham - Caddis dedicating the promotion to the Town's 'amazing' support. As Swindon went on to seal the championship, Caddis was named in the PFA League Two Team of the Year alongside Matt Ritchie, before agreeing an extension to his contract until the end of the 2013/14 season.\n\n\n\nIncredibly though, Caddis had played his last game for Swindon. After featuring throughout the Town\u2019s pre-season campaign, di Canio stripped him of the captaincy the week before the new season started - accusing the Scot of \u201cnot being the same player\u201d after becoming a new father over the summer - and then left him out of the squad for the season\u2019s opening games. At the end of August, a deal was agreed to allow him to join Championship side Birmingham on a season long loan, with Adam Rooney moving in the opposite direction - but though Caddis initially impressed at St. Andrews, he was soon sidelined with a shoulder injury. When he returned to action sooner than anticipated, Caddis took a side-swipe at di Canio - stating that maybe it \u201cwas not so bad\u201d that he had fallen out with the Italian, as there would have been no chance that he could have got back to fitness so quickly at the County Ground, as the facilities at the Championship side were so much better. Di Canio soon retaliated, saying that he \u201ccan\u2019t accept stupid comments from a player who hasn\u2019t proved anything yet in football\u201d, suggesting that Caddis \u201cdidn\u2019t even know how to stretch\u201d when he had joined the club - soon after, it was revealed that di Canio had donated his image rights so that the club could benefit from treatment at an Italian rehabilitation center among the best in the world.\n\n\n\nBy the end of December, it seemed certain that Caddis would join the Blues on a permanent deal - but although a price was agreed, Birmingham pulled out of the deal as it was decided that they couldn\u2019t afford the fee - and a deal was still not in place by the time the defender\u2019s loan deal expired. By this time, a new board was in place at Swindon, di Canio had resigned and was replaced by Kevin MacDonald - the new supremo stating that he expected Caddis back for pre-season, and that he would not be sold on the cheap - Caddis himself seemed bemused at how his situation had worked out, having previously stated that he would \u201clove\u201d to stay at St. Andrews, he admitted that he had expected to have been transferred. Though Caddis started the pre-season campaign - even captaining the side at Forest Green Rovers - he found himself on the sidelines after a Swindon Advertiser interview in which he declared he didn\u2019t know what his future held, or which direction the club was trying to go in - as new bids from Birmingham and Blackpool in the region of \u00a3120,000 were rejected. After the season started, Caddis revealed details of a meeting with new Town chairman Jed McCrory in which he was told, as one of the club\u2019s highest earners, his wage would be an issue - going on to accuse the club of not playing him as they wanted him sold. He also stated that both Millwall and Birmingham had agreed to take on his contract on a loan deal - McCrory retorted by saying that he had been disappointed that Caddis had not agreed to return to Swindon to participate in the play-offs the previous season, and that the Scot had told him he wanted to play in the Championship and was looking for a new club. When a bid from Blackpool was eventually accepted, Caddis could not agree personal terms - the contract only marginally better than his Town deal, but dependent on the number of minutes he played. The saga finally came to an end at the beginning of September, when the Town accepted a bid of \u00a3150,000 from Birmingham, and Caddis moved to St. Andrews on a three-year deal.\n\n\n\nSix years later, Caddis was back in Town, training with the side but seemingly unlikely to get a contract to play, with manager Richie Wellens suggesting that Town\u2019s finances meant they couldn\u2019t make the Scot an offer after the signings of Gabriel Zakuani and Dion Donohue. In mid-November, Caddis signed a short term deal after Donohue departed.\n\n\n\nStill aged only 31, Caddis had played over 200 games across spells at Birmingham, Bury, Blackburn Rovers and Bradford since leaving, and his short hair had turned grey - perhaps he\u2019d been following Swindon in his absence. He was a different player to the one who had left Swindon; a little less pace and, perhaps partially due to not having Matt Ritchie to link up with, less of an attacking threat, but far more canny at managing a game and still able to cross brilliantly from the right.\n\n\n\nAfter a last minute substitute role at Salford, he started his first game back at the County Ground in November and almost made the perfect return, his curling left footed shot hitting the inside of the post and bouncing clear. Manager Richie Wellens shifted Rob Hunt over to the left back position to accommodate Caddis and the two would retain the full back positions through the rest of the shortened season. Caddis signed an extended contract through to the end of the 2020/21 season in January, and became the first player in Town\u2019s history to win League Two twice when Wellens\u2019 side were declared champions on a points-per-game ruling after the season had been suspended by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, in his second season back, Caddis added being relegated from League One to his list of things he\u2019d done in both spells at Town. He returned to pre-season training below ideal fitness levels and with Town often playing with wing backs, rather exposing his ageing legs, his performances tailed off. He made 28 appearances over the season, which was still the third highest amongst Town defenders in a deeply unsettled squad, and was far from the worst performer in an at times dreadful Town squad under boss John Sheridan.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the season, with his contract expiring, Caddis appeared as one of thirteen names on the released section of Town\u2019s retained and released list, with only a cursory \u201cthank you for your efforts\u201d by the club. It was the second sad departure for a man who played 139 times for Swindon over his two spells, scoring eight goals and being promoted twice.\n\n\n\nPLAYING RECORD: Season LEAGUE FA CUP LEAGUE CUP OTHER TOTAL Played Gls Played Gls Played Gls Played Gls Played Gls '20/'21 24 (+2) 1 1 - - - 1 1 26 (+2) 2 '19/'20 18 (+1) - - - - - - - 18 (+1) - '13/'14 - - - - - - - - - - '12/'13 - - - - - - - - - - '11/'12 39 4 4 - 2 - 5 1 50 5 '10/'11 36 (+2) 1 1 (+1) - 1 - (+1) - 38 (+4) 1 TOTAL 117 (+5) 6 6 (+1) - 3 - 6 (+1) 2 132 (+7) 8\n\n\n\nTRANSFER INFORMATION: DATE IN/OUT TRANSFER DETAIL 2 AUG 2010 IN Celtic\n\nUndisclosed fee (double deal with Simon Ferry, believed to be a initial combined fee of \u00a3300,000, rising to a potential \u00a3600,000 depending on clauses) 31 AUG 2012 OUT Birmingham City\n\n(loan) 5 MAY 2013 IN Birmingham City\n\n(loan return) 2 SEP 2013 OUT Birmingham City\n\nUndisclosed fee (believed to be around \u00a3150,000) 15 NOV 2019 IN Bradford City\n\n(unattached) 14 MAY 2021 OUT (released)"}, {"url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-celtic-caddis-rowett-25582260", "page_content": "Anyone with even a passing knowledge of events at Birmingham City will remember Paul Caddis as the man who saved the club from a whole heap of heartache. Perhaps not quite so commonly known is there was also a time in his Blues career when he was a self-confessed \u2018pain in the backside\u2019.\n\nFor the uninitiated, on the final day of the 2013/2014 season Caddis, all 5ft 7ins of him, scored an injury time header against Bolton Wanderers that gave Blues a 2-2 draw and kept the club in the Championship. That moment, allied with the shirt-whirling, pastey-chested, pitch-length celebration has become the emblem of The Saviour\u2019s time at St Andrew\u2019s.\n\nHowever, that legendary match at the Reebok Stadium was only one of the 160 he played for the club, a four-season period of his career he now considers to be the pinnacle of his time in professional football.\n\nREAD: Jude Bellingham sends message to Birmingham City after England World Cup heroics\n\nREAD: The 'least' Blues would bank from Jude Bellingham transfer amid \u00a3100m Liverpool claims\n\nIt started in August 2012 with a deadline day loan that saw Adam Rooney sent to Swindon as the little Scot moved up from the County Ground. It ended four years later after a shoulder injury, a disagreement over his conditioning and the cancellation of his contract in the first few weeks of Gianfranco Zola\u2019s tenure.\n\nIn between Caddis wrote his name not only into Birmingham City Football Club\u2019s history books but on to nearly every one of Lee Clark and Gary Rowett\u2019s team-sheets and into the hearts of every grateful Bluenose out there. More of that later.\n\nFirst, his football journey started in North Ayrshire and took him to Celtic Park where he lived out a boyhood dream. And not just any old dream, the one where you go to sleep thinking one day you\u2019ll play in the Champions League against mighty Barcelona and wake up marking global superstar Ronaldinho in your first home match.\n\n\u201cI remember it like it was yesterday,\u201d the 34-year-old told BirminghamLive. \u201cI don\u2019t get nervous at football games, I never have, I always see the bigger picture, there\u2019s worse things in life and hand on heart I genuinely wasn\u2019t nervous that night.\n\n\u201cI knew no matter what I was a 19-year-old rookie, if I did well brilliant and if I didn\u2019t, I was exactly that, a 19-year-old rookie. The closest I got to these guys was playing them on the PlayStation or seeing them on TV so it was surreal just standing in that tunnel.\n\n\u201cFirst of all I was a Celtic fan so it was a boyhood dream for me to play for Celtic, to do it in the Champions League, that alone regardless of who the opposition was amazing for me and my family.\n\n\u201cThen looking across and seeing Messi, Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Eto\u2019o, Deco was ridiculous. It probably didn\u2019t sink in until I finished my career 18 months-two years ago.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\n\u201cI was marking Ronaldinho, at that time he was the man, everyone knew about Messi, he was coming but at that time it was Ronaldinho. He had the strongest backside I ever played against. \u201cThere was one moment early on in the game where I have made a sliding tackle and it\u2019s gone off him out for our throw and I remember him looking at me and giving me the nod of approval, like \u2018Well done\u2019. That for me was unbelievable, he was meant to be my enemy on the pitch.\u201d\n\nMessi scored a late winner to give the Catalans a 3-2 victory and that game would go on to become one of just 24 he would play for the Bhoys. After that he spent the second half of the 2008/2009 campaign on loan with Dundee United.\n\nPlaying week in week out for Craig Levein he learned that regular football would be the thing he craved above everything, more so than the kudos of belonging to one of the biggest clubs in Britain.\n\n\u201cI would have loved to have stayed at my boyhood club and played every week but at the same time I wanted to get to a stage where I wanted to be a first team footballer.\n\n\u201cThere were lads who stayed at Celtic until they were 22-23 years old and they had no first team experience at all, they were just there for the facilities and for the \u2018I play for Celtic\u2019 tag. I wasn\u2019t about that.\u201d\n\nAnd so, in August 2010 as an ambitious 22-year-old he set off \u2018down the road\u2019 to sign for Danny Wilson\u2019s Swindon. Eight months later the Robins had been relegated and Caddis was a League Two player, having literally swapped Deco and Ronaldinho for Dagenham & Redbridge.\n\nWilson had resigned and West Ham and Lazio great Paolo Di Canio arrived, quickly naming Caddis captain. It would be a shrewd move. Together the pair guided Swindon to the League Two title at the first attempt and Caddis was named in the PFA League Two Team of the Year. He was also awarded a new contract.\n\nBizarrely, just three months later he was sent to Blues, first on loan and then permanently as his relationship with the volatile Italian ran aground.\n\n\u201cHe was a livewire,\u201d Caddis recalled. \u201cEverything you could possibly think of, he was energetic, he was one hundred miles-per-hour, he was intense. I didn\u2019t have a great relationship with him at the end, that\u2019s how I ended up at Birmingham but he was a very good manager, he knew football inside out, from goalkeeper to striker, he knew everything.\n\n\u201cIt took him a little bit of time to adapt to League Two but to work under on the football pitch he was brilliant, off the football pitch he was a nightmare, an absolute nightmare, he wanted to live your life for you. It was difficult, he would be up at boys who were 34-35-years-old telling them not to take milk in their coffee \u2013 just things like that.\n\n\u201cYou think \u2018The guy is 34-years-old with three kids and a house, you can\u2019t tell him not to take milk in his coffee\u2019. We knew when he left Swindon that he would struggled at Sunderland. We had to do it, we had no option at League Two but to follow his rules.\n\n\u201cWhereas we knew when he went to the Premier League with guys in \u00a360, 70, 80-90,000 a week, they are not going to miss a week\u2019s wages or an appearance fee on a Saturday because they fell out with the manager.\u201d\n\nIt was Clark who offered Caddis a way out, one he appreciates to this day. \u201cI absolutely loved it, honestly it gives me goosebumps just thinking about it. I remember the first day going up and being up in the box waiting for everything to be confirmed, looking out on to the stadium and the pitch.\n\n\u201cI had a great times at Swindon but in my opinion Birmingham was my highest level I played at. I absolutely loved playing in front of those supporters. I had a connection straight away, I knew when I came straight in from League Two I needed to hit the ground running and win the supporters over. \u201cAnd I think you saw from the off I was one hundred per cent all in, they got that from me and I got that from them as well.\u201d\n\nCaddis played 27 league games in his first season, 38 in his second, which culminated in the day for which he is best known. \u201cOne thing that sticks with me is we had the player awards night the following night and I knew Garry Pendrey, he was the assistant manager at Celtic, and he came up to me and said \u2018Cadds, one bit of advice, your life as a Birmingham player will now change\u2019. That stuck with me.\n\n\u201cI was aware it was a huge, important goal but not until people were coming up, people who worked at the stadium saying \u2018You have saved my mortgage, my house, my marriage\u2019. This was literally do or die. We didn\u2019t know that at first, seeing the joy in people\u2019s faces and the relief.\n\n\u201cSomeone asked me recently what it was like in the dressing room and it was probably only for 30 seconds but it felt like five minutes, you could not hear a pin drop. It was silent after the game. The relief, the sigh of \u2018Thank God we have stayed up, we have rewarded the fans\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe fans stuck with us the full season, we had a lot of loan players, it was difficult, the manager was asked to cut the wage bill by a significant amount. We were made up of League One and Two players fighting in a division that was made up of Premier League players, it was a horrible season but an unbelievable ending.\u201d\n\nClark\u2019s tenure ended 14 games into the 2014/2015 campaign, Rowett succeeding the Geordie and overseeing a remarkable turnaround in fortunes. He took a team that had lost 8-0 the previous week and then went to Wolves and battled out a 0-0 draw.\n\nCaddis would go on to play all but one match in that campaign as Blues moved up from 21st to tenth. As the team\u2019s penalty taker he ended the season with seven goals and a highly productive partnership with right winger David Cotterill.\n\nIt would be a similar story in 2015/16 as Caddis monopolised the right back berth. However, things changed for both club and player soon after. In August 2016 Rowett cited Caddis\u2019 conditioning as the reason for leaving him out. A month later Caddis told BirminghamLive he wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable \u2018losing a stone\u2019. A month after that he dislocated his shoulder trying to prove himself to Rowett in a game for the Under 23s.\n\nBy Decemeber Rowett had been sacked, Zola was installed and the Blues love affair came to a juddering halt.\n\nREAD: John Eustace has five things to sort out during Birmingham City\u2019s World Cup break\n\nREAD: Manchester United's 'forgotten figure' heading for January exit after Birmingham City loan\n\n\u201cGary Rowett and I still speak but there were a couple of moments,\u201d Caddis admitted. \u201cGreg Stewart when he first signed for Birmingham, he sat down in Gary Rowett\u2019s office and Gary Rowett said \u2018I wouldn\u2019t sit in that seat\u2019 and Greg was looking at him like \u2018What do you mean?\u2019. And Gary said \u2018That\u2019s Cadds\u2019 seat, he is never out of here\u2019.\n\n\u201cI had an unbelievable relationship with Gary Rowett, he was very honest with me, I was very honest with him. I\u2019ll be honest, I hated the gym, I hated doing running sessions but my point to him was \u2018I guarantee you I will never miss training or ever miss a session\u2019. And I never did.\n\n\u201cAfter four-five months he pulled me into the office and he said \u2018You know what, you are making me learn as a manager. I am going to stand up and I am going to say until you miss a training session or until I see your conditioning slip then I will turn a blind eye to you because what you are doing is working\u2019.\n\n\u201cI played under him all the time, he gave me a new deal. So it wasn\u2019t all sour, there were probably times when I was a pain in the backside. I will admit that. But I was one of those ones, I hated not playing \u2013 hated it.\n\n\u201cThere was a point where I said to him \u2013 and it was wrong, I regret it, \u2018I would rather be in the stand than on the bench. I hate being on the bench, I would rather play or not be involved\u2019. He was the manger and rightly enough he went \u2018Do you know what? Don\u2019t be involved\u2019. He was right, he was spot on.\n\n\u201cBut when I started at Fleetwood he was the first one to text, he invited me into Millwall to go and watch some of the sessions to get what it\u2019s like behind the scenes as a manager. So as much as I was a pain in the backside I probably helped him!\u201d\n\nWhich is where he now finds himself, boots firmly hung up but with cones and clipboard in hand. The \u2018pain in the backside\u2019 now has managerial aspirations of his own.\n\n\u201cNo question I want to be a manager but it\u2019s a new career, you are learning a new trade as a coach, completely different. I am happy with doing what I am doing at the moment.\n\n\u201cI am working with the Under 16s, which I quite enjoy, that\u2019s quite a sensitive age in terms of the next level is professional football so you are preparing people for professional football.\n\n\u201cI was honest when I went into Fleetwood that I could do 11-12-13-year-olds. I want to work at a stage where it actually means something, you can get after them if you need to, you can prepare them for what first team football is like.\n\n\u201cWe have got a boy who just came on at the weekend and he was in my Under 16s last year, it just shows you how close it is. I have got a good relationship and played with the manager [Scott Brown] at Celtic so that\u2019s helped a lot in terms of I can go and watch the first team and go and learn of him.

A year earlier, nearly every single one of their top players had been killed in the Superga air disaster, which had wiped out Il Grande Torino. The head of the Azzurri selection committee, Ferruccio Novo, was also president of Torino, only missing the flight by chance; he understandably lobbied for a journey by sea; he understandably got his way. Problem was, the two-week cruise wasn\u2019t particularly conducive to athletic improvement. So with little training done, Italy rolled off the boat on to dry land at S\u00e3o Paolo and, knackered and out of condition, immediately lost their first game to a Sweden side who were without all their best players in Gunnar Gren, Gunnar Nordahl and Nils Liedholm. The result effectively meant Italy fell at the very first hurdle, 90 minutes of red-faced effort ending their 16-year possession of Coupe Jules Rimet. A farce, you would say, though one which could be put down to an unfortunate and unavoidable combination of circumstances. Until you realise the players were then allowed to fly back home.\n\nApart that is from striker Benito Lorenzi, who preferred a month-long return by boat which only just got him back in time for pre-season training.\n\nThe Fifa museum site also features a history of squad journeys to the finals and recalls a boat-based element of South Korea\u2019s 1954 odyssey: \u201cOn 10 June, they took a long train ride from Seoul to Busan, where they boarded a ship for Japan. In Tokyo, they found that the plane wasn\u2019t big enough \u2013 so 12 players and the coach flew to Zurich via Calcutta (where there was a delay for propeller repairs) and Italy. The other nine members went to Bangkok to catch a flight to Europe on 13 June. That aircraft was also too small, and the story goes that two players would have been left behind if an English couple hadn\u2019t given up their seats.\u201d Knackered, they lost their opening match 9-0 to Hungary and their second to Turkey, 7-0. Then it was back on to the long plane home.\n\nTurkey putting South Korea to the sword at the 1954 World Cup. Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images\n\nReader Alex von Fintel points out that \u201cthe German team at the 2014 World Cup travelled to and from every match by boat. \u200eIt was just a ferry across a bay, which was the only way to and from the hotel, but they did use a boat.\u201d\n\nLuck of the Aalborg\n\nLast week we looked at teams both getting relegated at the end of the same match.

He then made his first start just six days later against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park in the Scottish Cup. He assisted Scott McDonald for the first goal in the 5\u20131 victory. Caddis made his home debut on 20 February against Barcelona in the Champions League last 16 first leg fixture. He went on to play 17 times in the Scottish Premier League for Celtic.\n\nCaddis appeared in Celtic's 3\u20133 Europa League draw with Rapid Vienna in December 2009.\n\nDundee United (loan)\n\nOn 2 February 2009, Caddis joined Dundee United on loan until the end of the season. He made his debut against Inverness CT on 14 February playing the full 90 minutes on the right wing as the game ended 1\u20131. He returned to Celtic after playing his last game for the Tangerines in a 3\u20130 defeat to Rangers on 24 May, having made 11 appearances for the club.\n\nSwindon Town\n\nIn August 2010, Caddis and fellow Celtic youth team graduate Simon Ferry joined English League One club Swindon Town for an undisclosed fee. The 22-year-old, who said he left Celtic for regular first-team football, signed a three-year contract. Manager Danny Wilson commented favourably on his versatility, and played him in midfield as well as at full back. He made his debut in the Football League Cup against Leyton Orient, and made 42 appearances during the 2010\u201311 season as Swindon were relegated to League Two.\n\nCaddis remained at Swindon for the 2011\u201312 season in League Two despite a number of players leaving the club after the relegation. Swindon began the season with new addition Oliver Risser as captain, but Caddis took the armband after Risser suffered an injury. Despite Risser's return to fitness, manager Paolo di Canio decided to name Caddis as captain for the remainder of the season. He was ever-present for most of the season, missing a handful of games in March and April \u2013 including the Football League Trophy final defeat \u2013 due to an ankle injury. He and Matt Ritchie were named in the League Two PFA Team of the Year as Swindon were promoted as champions. At the end of the season, he agreed an extension to his contract until 2014.\n\nBirmingham City\n\nOn the last day of the August 2012 transfer window, Caddis joined Championship club Birmingham City on loan for the season. Birmingham striker Adam Rooney moved in the other direction, on loan for the season with a view to a permanent transfer. He produced a man-of-the-match performance on his debut the following day, in Birmingham's first league win of the season at home to Peterborough United. A dislocated shoulder sustained during his third game kept him out until late November.\n\nIn April 2013, BBC Sport reported that Birmingham's offer of \u00a3125,000 down and a further \u00a3125,000 in instalments had been rejected by Swindon because they were looking for around \u00a3275,000 cash. When Birmingham right-back Neal Eardley injured a knee just before the end of the summer transfer window, the club made a further bid for Caddis, who had remained out of favour at Swindon. The bid, reportedly in the region of \u00a3150,000 was accepted, and Caddis signed a three-year contract with Birmingham on 2 September. He became a regular in the side, and scored his first goals for Birmingham on 30 November in the first half of the league match at Barnsley, with a 25-yard (23 m) drive and a penalty. On the last day of the season, Birmingham needed at least a draw away at Bolton Wanderers and for other results to favour them to avoid relegation to League One. Two goals down with 12 minutes left, Nikola \u017digi\u0107 scored, and three minutes into stoppage time, his close-range header was cleared off the line to Caddis, who produced what he thought was his first ever headed goal to preserve Birmingham's second-tier status.\n\nCaddis missed only one match in all competitions in 2014\u201315 \u2013 his 48 appearances were more than any of his teammates \u2013 he was the regular penalty-taker, and he captained the team when Paul Robinson was unavailable. The Birmingham Mail rated him one of the best attacking full backs in the division, praising his \"delivery, support play and ability with a dead ball\", and suggested that his assertiveness in defence was starting to improve. In 2015\u201316, Caddis lost the team captaincy to Michael Morrison, and was not an automatic selection at right back, but he still started 37 of the 46 league matches. At the start of the 2016\u201317 season, manager Gary Rowett told Caddis he would not be involved with the first team until his fitness levels were good enough \u2013 an assessment with which the player disagreed. He played with the development squad to prove his fitness, but dislocated a shoulder while doing so, underwent surgery, and was out for three months. In January 2017, new manager Gianfranco Zola told Caddis he rated him behind Jonathan Spector and the youngster Josh Dacres-Cogley, but that if he wanted to stay at Birmingham and fight for his place it was his decision. On 26 January, his contract was cancelled by mutual consent.\n\nBury\n\nCaddis signed a short-term contract with EFL League One club Bury on 25 February 2017. He went straight into the starting eleven for that day's 1\u20130 win away to Charlton Athletic, a result that continued a winning streak for Lee Clark, under whose management Caddis had been a first-team regular at Birmingham.\n\nInternational career\n\nCaddis with Scotland under-21 side in 2009\n\nCaddis played for the Scotland under-19 team and won 13 caps for the Scotland under-21s.\n\nIn March 2013, he was called into the senior squad as a late replacement to cover for the injured Russell Martin for the World Cup qualifier away to Serbia, but remained an unused substitute.\n\nCaddis was next called up for a friendly against the Czech Republic on 24 March 2016, again as a late replacement. This time, he made his senior debut as an 88th-minute substitute for goalscorer Ikechi Anya as Scotland completed a 1\u20130 win.\n\nPersonal life\n\nCaddis is the younger brother of former Ayr United striker Ryan Caddis and older brother of former Alloa Athletic midfielder Liam Caddis and former Kilmarnock goalkeeper, Dylan. As of July 2016, all of his brothers were playing together at Scottish junior club Ardrossan Winton Rovers.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nClub\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League National Cup League Cup Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Celtic 2006\u201307 Scottish Premier League 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2007\u201308 Scottish Premier League 2 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 4 0 2008\u201309 Scottish Premier League 5 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 7 0 2009\u201310 Scottish Premier League 10 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 13 0 Total 17 0 3 0 2 0 2 0 24 0 Dundee United (loan) 2008\u201309 Scottish Premier League 11 0 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 11 0 Swindon Town 2010\u201311 League One 38 1 2 0 1 0 1 0 42 1 2011\u201312 League Two 39 4 4 0 2 0 5 1 50 5 2012\u201313 League One 0 0 \u2014 0 0 \u2014 0 0 Total 77 5 6 0 3 0 6 1 92 6 Birmingham City (loan) 2012\u201313 Championship 27 0 1 0 0 0 \u2014 28 0 Birmingham City 2013\u201314 Championship 38 5 2 0 2 0 \u2014 42 5 2014\u201315 Championship 45 6 1 0 2 1 \u2014 48 7 2015\u201316 Championship 39 4 0 0 1 0 \u2014 40 4 2016\u201317 Championship 0 0 0 0 1 0 \u2014 1 0 Total 149 15 4 0 6 1 \u2014 159 16 Bury 2016\u201317 League One 9 0 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 9 0 Career total 263 20 13 0 11 1 8 1 295 22\n\nHonours\n\nClub\n\nSwindon Town\n\nFootball League Two: 2011\u201312\n\nIndividual"}], "Paul Caddis was appointed captain of Swindon in 2013.": [{"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19293570", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nDefender Paul Caddis says he has been left \"hurt\" and \"disappointed\" after being replaced as Swindon Town captain.\n\nManager Paolo Di Canio said the 24-year-old right-back had \"changed his attitude\" during pre-season and opted to make Alan McCormack his skipper.\n\n\"My attitude has never been questioned before,\" he told BBC Wiltshire. \"I've always been praised for my professionalism.\n\n\"To have that called in to question was really hurtful.\"\n\nHe added: \"I don't understand why, but he's got his opinion and he's entitled to that.\"\n\nThe Scotsman took over as captain in October, replacing Oliver Risser who, like Caddis, was dropped from the role by Di Canio.\n\nCaddis led Town to the League Two title and made 50 appearances during the campaign.\n\nBut his relationship with Di Canio became fractured during pre-season, and the Italian has since claimed the player's enthusiasm had disappeared since becoming a father over the summer.\n\nBut the Scotsman insists: \"There's not a problem with my kid, with sleeping or anything like that.\n\nquote He's not the same player, not the same attitude, so it's time to make the decision\n\n\"One thing that really disappointed me was the mention of my baby.\n\n\"You start hearing through people that me and my Mrs can't cope.

Caddis will officially take charge from 1st May 2023.\n\n\n\nAlthough new to management, Caddis brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to his new role after a successful playing career that spanned over 15 years, in which time he made over 400 senior appearances in the game.\n\n\n\nA former Scottish international, Caddis started his professional career at Celtic FC, making his home debut in a final 16 round Champions League fixture against Barcelona.\n\nCaddis went on to play for clubs in England, including Swindon Town, Birmingham City, and Blackburn Rovers. He has also played for Bury and Dundee.\n\nHaving retired from professional football in 2021, Caddis has been making a name for himself as a coach and has been involved in coaching roles at various clubs, including Swindon Town and most recently, Fleetwood Town, where he\u2019s been working in the Academy set up, and in coaching Fleetwood Town\u2019s International side (FTIFA).\n\nSpeaking following his appointment, Caddis said: \u201cI am thrilled to step into the role of manager. It\u2019s an exciting opportunity for me, and I am committed to leaving no stone unturned in order to achieve the success and progression that this club deserves.\n\n\u201cI will work tirelessly and around the clock to build a team that the Hereford supporters and wider community can be truly proud of. Our team will embody character, desire, and a strong work ethic that mirrors the passion of our fantastic supporters.\u201d\n\nBulls\u2019 Chairman, Chris Ammonds, said:\n\n\u201cI am hugely excited by this appointment. Paul\u2019s obvious hunger for an opportunity and vision for our club impressed at both stages of the interview process. His enthusiasm and ambition shone through in his interviews and the desire to learn and improve he demonstrated was infectious. He has been chomping at the bit to be given a chance at the right club.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he was made captain of many of the teams he featured in during his impressive playing career shows his leadership qualities and it\u2019s clear he demands high standards of everyone around him. He wants to build a team that plays football on the front foot and has emphasised the point that he will expect his players to be the fittest in the league.\n\n\u201cHe has been building his coaching experience over the past few years and explained in detail that we are exactly the type of chance he has been looking for. I am very pleased that we are able to give him this opportunity and I am really looking forward to seeing him develop at Edgar Street.\n\n\u201cFinally, I would like to say that I believe we are indebted to Yan, his coaching staff and the players for their effort and commitment over the past few months. Yan very much remains in post as first team manager until the end of the season so let\u2019s hope we can build on last weekend\u2019s excellent win at Peterborough and end the season with a flourish.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/paul-caddis", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nPaul Caddis was born on 19 April, 1988 in Irvine.
