King said, \u201cThat\u2019s just him.\u201d\n\nThey talk about his easygoing personality and how he allows the players their freedom. Calvin de Haan said recently, \u201cKinger\u2019s come in, said the right things, I believe, and he\u2019s got a real down-to-earth mentality and personality. He\u2019s been fun to talk to and fun to be around in the locker room. I think he\u2019s kind of letting us steer the ship to a certain extent.\u201d\n\nThey mention his unselfishness and say how good of a person he is. Dallas Eakins, who played and coached with King, said, \u201cBack when we\u2019re playing, like one of the call-up guys wouldn\u2019t have a car here. \u2026 He\u2019s like, can I give you a ride? It\u2019s who he is, and I just can\u2019t say enough about him. \u2026 Like 10 out of 10, this is a guy you\u2019d want as your friend. You\u2019d want him as your father. You\u2019d want him as your son-in-law.\u201d\n\nThey describe how he\u2019s content wherever he is, which allows him to do the job at hand and is why he seemed to be the ideal candidate for interim head coach. Rockford IceHogs president of hockey operations and general manager Mark Bernard said, \u201cIf I asked him his five-year plan, it was going to be, \u2018Well, to be in Rockford five years. I just want to come in and I want to help the future players in the Blackhawks.\u2019 He didn\u2019t have an agenda where, \u2018Well, I\u2019d like to be in Rockford for two years and then I want to move up to the NHL as assistant and then I want to move up as a head coach.\u2019 He was quite adamant that he could be in Rockford for the rest of his career and to develop players and be happy with that.\u201d\n\nWhat about when he isn\u2019t happy?\n\nAnders Sorensen, IceHogs interim head coach and King\u2019s former assistant, provided some intel on a seldom-seen but very effective King facial expression that seems to get his players\u2019 attention.\n\n\u201cI joke around, I like when he gets his angry Scottish face on,\u201d Sorensen said. \u201cHe can really stare a guy down with the best of them. His eyes go all black and he gives you the death stare. I\u2019ve seen it a few times. I think guys definitely respect that. It\u2019s not a daily thing at all, so you know when he does it, he means it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether the 54-year-old King will be the long-term choice for the Blackhawks as head coach is unknown. Interim general manager Kyle Davidson has already stated the search for a permanent head coach won\u2019t begin until the offseason. The search could begin and end with King. He\u2019ll have at least a 70-NHL game sample size to analyze at that point.\n\nBut for now, he is the Blackhawks head coach, and for many who have played and coached with and for him, he\u2019s the perfect person for the Blackhawks at this moment.\n\n\u201cWhen times are tough up top there, those guys feel the pressure,\u201d said Cody Franson, who played for King when King was an IceHogs assistant and head coach. \u201cSometimes when you get a new coach, it can provide that spark on its own. But I think what Kinger\u2019s going to bring to those guys is a guy who played, a guy who understands it. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to go in there and try and change everything overnight. But I think Kinger\u2019s going to be a guy that naturally guys want to play for and try and have success for.\n\n\u201cI went through coaching changes midseason in Toronto, so I\u2019ve been through it, too. There\u2019s different elements that come into play. But Kinger\u2019s one of those personalities that guys gravitate to. He\u2019s the kind of guy who wants to make you run through a wall for because he shows you respect when you deserve it and he manages a group really well and gets a good feel of his guys and tries to do everything he can to help guys win. He\u2019s very much a guy that\u2019s trying to work with the guys and doesn\u2019t want his room divided and that kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nDerek King began considering coaching at the end of his own long and successful playing career.\n\nKing produced 612 points in 830 career NHL games. There was a three-season stretch with the New York Islanders in the early 1990s where he scored 108 goals. He wrapped up his NHL playing days with the 1999-2000 season and kept playing elsewhere for a few seasons. He went to Germany and then returned to North America to play for the Grand Rapids Griffins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Griffins attracted him with an interesting proposal \u2014 be a player and a coach for them.\n\n\u201cHe was always a guy who had a good head for the game,\u201d said Danton Cole, who was the head coach of the Griffins at the time and is now Michigan State\u2019s men\u2019s head coach. \u201cWe talked to him about a lot of stuff anyhow, so it was a good kind of progression there. It was something that made our spot interesting for him. He was still playing, and I\u2019ve had player-assistants before; you try to involve them in certain parts and give them a flavor of what coaching is like. It\u2019s a lot different than what we think of as a player.\u201d\n\nKing mainly assisted on special teams and provided insight into what he was seeing on the ice. He remained player-assistant for two seasons, but there wasn\u2019t a full-time coaching position available after that.\n\nAfter the 2003-04 season, he permanently moved to Arizona, where he owned some real estate properties. He coached his eldest son, D.J., occasionally helped out at some pro camps and golfed. He and his wife later had twin sons while living in Arizona.\n\n\u201cAnd then my twins came and my golf game went pfft,\u201d King said.\n\nThat was his life and might have remained his life until Dallas Eakins called one day. They had played and roomed together while with the Toronto Maple Leafs and became good friends. When Eakins was hired as Toronto Marlies head coach in 2009, he first sought an assistant with coaching experience and hired Gord Dineen. There were fewer parameters with the second assistant position, and he thought of his old friend.\n\n\u201cDerek King was coaching kids in Scottsdale, like helping kids out, and I just thought he would be an unbelievable coach, even though he had no pro experience, because he had played for so long, he had played for Al Arbour, he had played for Pat Quinn, and I think when you play for great coaches whether you\u2019re cognizant of it or not, you\u2019re learning great lessons from them,\u201d said Eakins, who is now the head coach of the Anaheim Ducks. \u201cAnd then just the way Kinger\u2019s personality was, I just thought he was really going to see the game through the players\u2019 eyes, and I really believe that\u2019s a massive part of the coaching process. And so that\u2019s kind of where it started.\u201d\n\nDerek King was a first-round draft pick by the New York Islanders in 1985. (Getty Images)\n\nKing wasn\u2019t really aware of the impact Arbour and Quinn, who are third and sixth in NHL coaching victories, had on him at the time, but he does recognize it now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI played in a time where the video and the iPads on the bench, there was none of that,\u201d King said. \u201cCoaches coached with feel. They had a feel for the game and they just knew how to manage players, so I had some great coaches that did that. Al Arbour was huge. \u2026 Because he used to ride me, but then when you retire and you start coaching kids, you understand why he was riding me: to make me a better player, better person, so I take stuff from him. Pat Quinn was another guy like that. He just had a way with things. He knew how to push buttons, he knew who to hug, who to kick in the butt, and he was excellent at it. I go to Toronto and I\u2019m getting kicked in the butt and yelled at, and I\u2019m wondering why, but I figured it out: I drove these coaches nuts. Now it\u2019s time for guys to drive me nuts.\u201d\n\nRay Ferraro witnessed Arbour driving King nuts. Ferraro played with King under Arbour while with the Islanders.\n\n\u201cHe was hard on Kinger because he knew Kinger had lots more,\u201d Ferraro said. \u201cHe knew Kinger had more than Kinger thought he had. And so, Kinger got 40 goals for Al. \u2026 Kinger could score, and Al kept pushing him for more because he knew he had it.\u201d\n\nWith Eakins\u2019 Marlies coaching offer, King jumped at the chance. Eakins gave him a lot of responsibility early on and put him in charge of the forwards. King had some things to learn, but he had a lot of coaching instincts already.\n\nKing was Eakins\u2019 assistant for four years with the Marlies. Eakins moved on and King stayed. He was then an assistant under Steve Spott during 2013-14 season and then an associate coach for Dineen for a season.\n\nAfter the 2014-15 season, King was let go by the Maple Leafs while the organization went through staff changes. King took an assistant position with the Owen Sound Attack of the OHL the following season, but he found the team was too far from his home in the Toronto area and only coached there for one season.\n\nMark Bernard and Derek King both grew up in Hamilton, Ontario. King was nearly two years older than Bernard, but they hung out within the same group of hockey players and skated together a lot of summers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBernard and King had kept in touch a bit over the years, so it wasn\u2019t completely out of the blue when King rang Bernard after the 2015-16 season and asked if the Blackhawks were looking for any coaches. King had just left his OHL position.\n\nIt just happened the Blackhawks were searching for a new assistant for the IceHogs. The problem is they had already interviewed a number of people and Stan Bowman, then the Blackhawks general manager, was close to a final decision.\n\n\u201cIn Stan\u2019s mind, he really liked one of the applicants,\u201d Bernard said. \u201cAnd I kind of begged, kind of said, \u2018No, let\u2019s just interview him in Buffalo. We\u2019re going to the draft and he can drive up from Hamilton. Trust me, you\u2019ll love this guy as an applicant.\u2019 Stan held off and we interviewed him before the draft in Buffalo, and it worked out and Stan loved him and he got the job and off we went.\u201d\n\nKing was an assistant under Ted Dent his first season with the IceHogs. It was a trying season for the team, and Dent was fired after it. King was retained and became an assistant for Jeremy Colliton.\n\nUnder Colliton, King had more of a vocal role at times.\n\n\u201cWhen (King) was the assistant coach, Jeremy wasn\u2019t much of a scream and yell guy,\u201d said Tyler Sikura, who played for the IceHogs from 2017-2020. \u201cWhen we needed that, that would be Kinger\u2019s kind of job to step in, make sure everybody\u2019s on their toes. If he wasn\u2019t happy with how things were going, he was going to let you know about it.\u201d\n\nDerek King became the Rockford IceHogs coach early into the 2018-19 season. (Nathan Vestal/IceHogs)\n\nThe IceHogs reached the playoffs that season. Colliton and King returned together for the 2018-19 season. When the Blackhawks fired Joel Quenneville early into the season, Colliton was promoted to head coach of the Blackhawks, and King was made the IceHogs\u2019 interim head coach. King was given the job permanently after the season.\n\nWhile King did know how to push his players\u2019 buttons like his former coaches, he knows where the balance is at and often leans towards keeping the atmosphere light.\n\n\u201cHe knows when it\u2019s time to be serious with them, but at the same time, he puts them at ease where he can talk to them and be one of the guys,\u201d Bernard said. \u201cWhen he was the assistant coach here, he\u2019d go out and play (two)-touch soccer with them before the game. And we used to always laugh because he\u2019d go out to play and come right back. We\u2019d be like, \u2018I thought you\u2019re to play soccer.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, they got me.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen Jeremy got called up to Chicago and Derek took over here, that was my main point of advice for him \u2014 just be yourself, the guys love you. They play hard for you. Just continue to be yourself because that\u2019s what the players love, and he did that, to his credit. The players here in Rockford, I know, all enjoyed playing for him.\u201d\n\nDylan Sikura, another one of King\u2019s former players, did enjoy playing for him, but he also recalled him not leaving the soccer games so graciously.\n\n\u201cDefinitely a players coach,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cKept it very loose around the locker room but demanded a lot from his guys. Was always cracking jokes always, keeping it light. You could tell he got a real joy being around the guys like when he used to play. He would play sewer ball (also known as two-touch soccer) with our team and refuse to get out. I remember one time we were down in a (hockey) game going into the third not playing well at all. In between periods, he said that we\u2019re going back to minor hockey, which meant when you get off the ice you enter in one (bench) door and exit in the other. No lines, no pairs. Whenever you get off, that\u2019s who you would go with. I remember playing some shifts with five forwards or sometimes D playing forward. We ended up coming back and winning.\u201d\n\nCody Franson had come to the decision he wasn\u2019t going to return to the KHL last season and would pursue a team to play for in North America again. He looked at his options and thought immediately about the IceHogs.\n\nFranson had already been through one stint with the IceHogs while under contract with the Blackhawks during the 2017-18 season. Back then, King was an assistant for the IceHogs. With King as the head coach this time around, Franson felt good about returning to Rockford.\n\n\u201cRight away I reached out to my agent and asked him to reach out to Rockford to see if it would work just because I knew Kinger was there,\u201d Franson said. \u201cI loved playing for Kinger. We had a great relationship. Him and Anders took that approach of trying to use the brains around them to potentially bounce things off of, and Colly (Colliton) did the same thing when I was there for the first time. I really enjoyed my role and really enjoyed working with Kinger, Colly and Anders the first time. That just made it very easy to reach out and hope something would happen with Rockford obviously. I had great relationships with everyone that was there, and Kinger was a massive part of that.\u201d\n\nThe 2020-21 season was challenging for the IceHogs. There was everything COVID-related that all teams had to go through, but the IceHogs were also young and inexperienced. Franson had played more pro seasons than nearly all of the IceHogs\u2019 defensemen combined. A 9-4 loss to the Iowa Wild on March 3 gave them a 1-6-1 start to the season.\n\nKing and the IceHogs battled through the ensuing months, continued to focus on development more than anything and finished with a 12-19-1 record.\n\n\u201cI know last year was really tough in Rockford,\u201d Franson said. \u201cThey took a very developmental approach to it and it was a struggle. I think our group last year in Rockford came a long way. At the start, we were a group that was very young and very green and had a ton to learn, a lot more than you usually do with a team. Man, to be able to come out with a record that we came out with, just shows how much work he put in and how good of a coach he is because that wasn\u2019t an easy thing to do to turn that into a respectable season.\u201d\n\nDerek King has been with the Blackhawks organization since 2016. (Scott Powers / The Athletic)\n\nIt helped that King bought into what the Blackhawks were doing developmentally. He wasn\u2019t concerned about wins and losses as some AHL coaches can be when their sights are on becoming NHL coaches.\n\n\u201cObviously I think he wanted to be a head coach, at least in the American League, but I think he\u2019s not a guy who is on a certain track looking to make it to a certain place,\u201d said Tyler Sikura, who was a captain under King. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who enjoys what he\u2019s doing day to day. I think he was enjoying working with some of the younger guys. He has a couple of younger kids. He\u2019d bring them out for practice and things like that. It\u2019s a lot of pressure to be an NHL head coach. Obviously, when everybody\u2019s in this business, you want to have ultimate success, you want to make it there, but I don\u2019t think that was the kind of thing that struck you with him. \u2026 He\u2019s enjoying what he\u2019s doing and he loves being around the game and he loves being around the guys, and that\u2019s kind of his day-to-day approach.\u201d\n\nSorensen and King discussed that very topic during their last few seasons together.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve obviously gotten close over the years, and we\u2019ve had a lot of conversations about this,\u201d Sorensen. said. \u201cSo just being happy where your two feet are right now. Where you are right now, be happy with it and do the best and make the best out of that situation. \u201d\n\nRay Ferraro tuned into Derek King\u2019s introductory news conference as Blackhawks interim coach to see his former teammate.\n\n\u201cI was watching the press conference and Kinger\u2019s up there, he\u2019s fiddling around with the mic and his hands were on the mic, and the way he talked and the way he answered the questions, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, my god, it\u2019s Kinger,'\u201d Ferraro said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same guy. He just got no hair. Because he had a long mane when we played. He didn\u2019t get to shaving it down until much later. But it looks very familiar. I was really happy to see him sitting there. I don\u2019t know. I was just really happy. I saw him out on the ice and he had a toque on. Like, it\u2019s just what I would expect.\u201d\n\nWearing a winter hat during practices is very unique to King.\n\n\u201cThe way he does, no, (I\u2019ve never had a coach do that),\u201d Tyler Sikura said. \u201cThat\u2019s his own style, I would say.\u201d\n\nFranson said while laughing, \u201cI think that Kinger\u2019s thing.\u201d\n\nWhile different, it does speak to King saying true to himself. When King was named Blackhawks interim coach, Eakins called him and reminded him of a few things. The conversation was a lot like what Bernard said to King when he became the IceHogs head coach.\n\n\u201cKinger played what, I don\u2019t know, probably 16 years or more pro, he\u2019s been coaching for a long time, too, so he has this vast amount of experience, as did I, but as much as you\u2019re ready, and you know you\u2019re ready, when you get that first job, there is the first few days like, holy man, I\u2019m a head coach of an NHL team,\u201d Eakins said. \u201cAnd I simply called him to remind him of how many games he played in the NHL, remember Al Arbour, remember Pat Quinn, remember all the lessons you\u2019ve learned along the way, and that he was 100 percent ready for this and to trust his instinct.\u201d\n\nKing doing just that throughout his career path, first as a player and now as a coach, has led to him accumulating a lot of people in his life who wish to see him do well.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of people excited for that man,\u201d Eakins said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how my phone blew up from former staff people in other organizations, former players all, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s unbelievable for Kinger,\u2019 or, \u2018Do you have Kinger\u2019s new cell because the one I have isn\u2019t working.\u2019 It\u2019s amazing to me how much my phone blew up when he got the job. It\u2019s incredible because it\u2019s all people who love him and he\u2019s been able to have a positive effect on and influence. I think in the end, like, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a coach or what you do in your life, when something good is happening for you and people are excited for you, I think that\u2019s a real true mark on what mark you\u2019ve left on their lives.\u201d\n\n(Photo: Bill Smith / NHLI via Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Derek_King_(Australian_footballer)", "page_content": "What we do.

He played his best football at Oakleigh, winning two Association best and fairest awards: the first division's J. J. Liston Trophy in 1975,[1] and then the second division's J. Field Trophy in 1977, when he polled a record 67 votes.[2] he also placed second by a single vote for the Liston Trophy in 1976,[3] and third in 1970.[4] He transferred to first division team Caulfield in 1978,[5] and placed third for the Liston Trophy again in 1980.[6]\n\nOverall, King played 139 VFA games; 85 with Oakleigh and 54 with Caulfield.[7]\n\nKing's father Robert played for VFA club Brighton[7] while his son, Clinton King, was an AFL player at three separate clubs.\n\nHe died from cancer on 28 April 2014, aged 65.[8]\n\nReferences\n\nDerek King's playing statistics from AFL Tables\n\nHolmesby, Russell and Main, Jim (2007).

The club is also known as Spurs. Tottenham's home ground is White Hart Lane. The club motto is Audere est Facere (To dare is to do).\n\nWe were sorry to learn of the passing of our former defender Derek King, aged 73. He made 19 first division appearances for us between 1951 and 1954 during his six year stint as a professional.\n\nAssociated with the club for 11 years during the immediate post war era, initially as a junior and then on our professional staff, Derek featured in approximately 200 competitive matches in our colours, mainly at centre half, until joining Swansea Town in 1956.\n\nBorn at Hackney on August 15, 1929, Derek Albert King attended Glynn Road School, Hackney and trained in the tie and neckwear industry on leaving at the age of 14. He played for Alexandra Palace FC during 1945. A member of Tottenham Juniors he featured at full back when our reserve team reappeared for the 1945-46 season.\n\nHis two year spell of National Service from November, 1947 was spent with the 3rd Battalion Grenadier Guards based at Windsor Castle.\n\nOn joining our full time staff during August, 1950 his first season was spent chiefly with our 'A' team playing in the Eastern Counties League. He made his Football League debut in a 1-0 home win over Fulham on August 20, 1951 but it was not until March, 1953 that he had a sustained run in our senior side.\n\nDerek made his final league outing for us against Charlton Athletic during October, 1954 going on to gain winners medals in the Sudbury & Suffolk Charity Cup of 1954-55 and the 1955-56 Football Combination before joining former team mate Ron Burgess at Swansea. His one season there yielded five league appearances.\n\nAfter his playing career he returned to work in the tie/neckwear business. Derek was associated with Tottenham based firm Dave Mackay Club Ties for a number of years and later worked as a school caretaker until retiring through ill health. He lived at Hoddesdon for many years having previously resided at Enfield and adjacent to our ground on Paxton Road, maintaining his love of football throughout.\n\nDerek had followed his uncle Eddie in wearing our colours. He was a son of Eddie's eldest brother Bert. Eddie's three year spell at Tottenham was ended by injury in 1936. He made one Football League appearance for the club in 1934.\n\nDerek King passed away at a Huntingdon nursing home on June 16. The funeral takes place at City of London Crematorium, South Chapel, at 13.15 on June 30.\n\nHe is survived by his mother Doris, aged 97, three sisters June, Doreen and Valerie, three daughters, Lesley, Toni and Christine, plus grand children.\n\nOur thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad time.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/174275155/derek-albert-king", "page_content": "There is a problem with your email/password.\n\nWe\u2019ve updated the security on the site.

He currently serves the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL as an assistant coach.\n\nNew fans of the ice hockey professional might be eager to learn about him. So, let's get to know more about Derek King and see how he went from playing to coaching in this biography.\n\nAn\u017ee Kopitar Biography - Hockey Player\n\nDerek King Net Worth And Career\n\nIncluding his career as an athlete and a coach, the former left winger has been actively involved in hockey for over 35 years. He must have bagged a massive fortune throughout the years. Likewise, Derek King's net worth must be immense.\n\nThe sportsman was drafted 13th overall by the New York Islanders in the NHL Entry Draft in 1985 and made his NHL debut in the 1986-87 season. He also played for Hartford Whalers, Toronto Maple Leafs, and St. Louis Blues of NHL. In addition, he also competed for different teams in leagues other than NHL. For example, King played for Grand Rapids Griffins in IHL and AHL and Oshawa Generals in the OHL. In his career as an NHL athlete, he played 830 games, scored 261 goals and 351 assists, and earned 612 points.\n\nNow, let's look at some of Derek's playing statistics in the table below:\n\nSeason Team Games Played Goals Scored Points 1996\u201397 New York Islanders 70 23 53 1997\u201398 Toronto Maple Leafs 77 21 46 1998\u201399 Toronto Maple Leafs 81 24 52\n\nTable Source: NHL Official Website\n\nAfter retiring from playing, the Hamilton native started his career as a coach in August 2009, when he became the assistant coach of the Toronto Marlies, the AHL affiliate team of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Five years later, in 2014, he was promoted to associate coach. Then, in July 2015, Derek became the OHL's Owen Sound Attack's assistant coach. However, he left the team in just three months, in October.\n\nFinally, in July 2016, King was named an assistant coach of the Rockford IceHogs of the American Hockey League, which is the minor league affiliate of the Chicago Blackhawks. He was later promoted to the interim head coach of the IceHogs on November 6, 2018. Eventually, he landed his first head coaching position at the end of the 2018-19 season.\n\nThe 1967-born sportsperson became the interim head coach of the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL on November 2, 2021. Just a day later, he earned his first win with the Blackhawks, defeating the Nashville Predators. Sadly, he was let go from the position on June 27, 2022. However, on July 11, 2022, Chicago Blackhawks announced Derek's return as an assistant coach for the 2022-23 season.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, veteran assistant coaches, with little head coaching experience, earn between $500,000 and $700,000 per year. Since King also previously served as a head coach, he must also earn in a similar range. Hence, Derek King's net worth must be a significant amount.\n\nLikewise, John Gibson is another sports celebrity with a massive net worth.\n\nDerek King Is Happily Married\n\nAs the title suggests, the Canadian coach enjoys a blissful marital life with his partner. But unfortunately, little to no information about his beloved spouse is known to the public as of now. Even the name of his missus has not been disclosed yet, making it hard to find her on social media. In addition, Mrs. King completely stays away from the limelight. Perhaps she prefers to keep a low profile.\n\nNonetheless, Derek has talked about his other half a few times in some of his interviews. Once in an interview with Chicago Tribune, while talking about how hectic his NHL schedule is, he revealed that Mrs. King controlled everything and got everything figured out. He also added that she is a huge supporter of his career. Hopefully, we will get to learn more about Derek King's wife in the future.\n\nProud Father Of Three\n\nThe former left winger and his spouse are parents of three lovely boys. Their eldest is D.J. King, who was born on August 7, 2000, in Scottsdale, Arizona. Derek King's son is pursuing a career in hockey and following in his footsteps. He is a professional hockey player who competes in the East Coast Hockey League as a Defense for the Fort Wayne Komets.\n\nDerek King shares three lovely sons with his wife. Image Source: Derek King's Twitter.\n\nDerek King's other children are a set of twins who arrived when he was living in Arizona. But, as in the case of his wife, along with their birth details, the names of his baby boys remain a mystery. Regardless, according to the coach's bio on his Twitter account, his younger kids also love the game of hockey. They often go to the Rockford Hockey Club rink for games and practices. So, could the twins be planning on becoming ice hockey players in the future?\n\nIs From Hamilton\n\nThe coach was welcomed by his parents on February 11, 1967, in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Sadly, information regarding Derek King's mother and father, including their names, has yet to be revealed. Likewise, he has not disclosed much about his other family members. Perhaps, his parents and siblings are people of privacy and want to stay away from the limelight.\n\nFurthermore, not much has been made known about the assistant coach himself. Due to this reason, it is difficult to learn about his childhood. It seems he is also a secretive person and isn't eager to share about his life before starting his hockey career.\n\nWell, it's unfortunate that Derek King has not opened up much about his personal life. Hopefully, we will learn about his parents, wife, and children in the days ahead. Nonetheless, with his fortune likely to grow with his career, he must enjoy a comfortable life. We wish him and his close ones lead a happy and prosperous life in the future.\n\nTrivia And Facts"}, {"url": "https://itsbiography.com/derek-king/", "page_content": "Derek King is a 55-years-old Canadian Athlete from the Trinidad and Tobago. his estimated net worth is $1 Million to $5 Million Approx.

King said, \u201cThat\u2019s just him.\u201d\n\nThey talk about his easygoing personality and how he allows the players their freedom. Calvin de Haan said recently, \u201cKinger\u2019s come in, said the right things, I believe, and he\u2019s got a real down-to-earth mentality and personality. He\u2019s been fun to talk to and fun to be around in the locker room. I think he\u2019s kind of letting us steer the ship to a certain extent.\u201d\n\nThey mention his unselfishness and say how good of a person he is. Dallas Eakins, who played and coached with King, said, \u201cBack when we\u2019re playing, like one of the call-up guys wouldn\u2019t have a car here. \u2026 He\u2019s like, can I give you a ride? It\u2019s who he is, and I just can\u2019t say enough about him. \u2026 Like 10 out of 10, this is a guy you\u2019d want as your friend. You\u2019d want him as your father. You\u2019d want him as your son-in-law.\u201d\n\nThey describe how he\u2019s content wherever he is, which allows him to do the job at hand and is why he seemed to be the ideal candidate for interim head coach. Rockford IceHogs president of hockey operations and general manager Mark Bernard said, \u201cIf I asked him his five-year plan, it was going to be, \u2018Well, to be in Rockford five years. I just want to come in and I want to help the future players in the Blackhawks.\u2019 He didn\u2019t have an agenda where, \u2018Well, I\u2019d like to be in Rockford for two years and then I want to move up to the NHL as assistant and then I want to move up as a head coach.\u2019 He was quite adamant that he could be in Rockford for the rest of his career and to develop players and be happy with that.\u201d\n\nWhat about when he isn\u2019t happy?\n\nAnders Sorensen, IceHogs interim head coach and King\u2019s former assistant, provided some intel on a seldom-seen but very effective King facial expression that seems to get his players\u2019 attention.\n\n\u201cI joke around, I like when he gets his angry Scottish face on,\u201d Sorensen said. \u201cHe can really stare a guy down with the best of them. His eyes go all black and he gives you the death stare. I\u2019ve seen it a few times. I think guys definitely respect that. It\u2019s not a daily thing at all, so you know when he does it, he means it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether the 54-year-old King will be the long-term choice for the Blackhawks as head coach is unknown. Interim general manager Kyle Davidson has already stated the search for a permanent head coach won\u2019t begin until the offseason. The search could begin and end with King. He\u2019ll have at least a 70-NHL game sample size to analyze at that point.\n\nBut for now, he is the Blackhawks head coach, and for many who have played and coached with and for him, he\u2019s the perfect person for the Blackhawks at this moment.\n\n\u201cWhen times are tough up top there, those guys feel the pressure,\u201d said Cody Franson, who played for King when King was an IceHogs assistant and head coach. \u201cSometimes when you get a new coach, it can provide that spark on its own. But I think what Kinger\u2019s going to bring to those guys is a guy who played, a guy who understands it. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to go in there and try and change everything overnight. But I think Kinger\u2019s going to be a guy that naturally guys want to play for and try and have success for.\n\n\u201cI went through coaching changes midseason in Toronto, so I\u2019ve been through it, too. There\u2019s different elements that come into play. But Kinger\u2019s one of those personalities that guys gravitate to. He\u2019s the kind of guy who wants to make you run through a wall for because he shows you respect when you deserve it and he manages a group really well and gets a good feel of his guys and tries to do everything he can to help guys win. He\u2019s very much a guy that\u2019s trying to work with the guys and doesn\u2019t want his room divided and that kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nDerek King began considering coaching at the end of his own long and successful playing career.\n\nKing produced 612 points in 830 career NHL games. There was a three-season stretch with the New York Islanders in the early 1990s where he scored 108 goals. He wrapped up his NHL playing days with the 1999-2000 season and kept playing elsewhere for a few seasons. He went to Germany and then returned to North America to play for the Grand Rapids Griffins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Griffins attracted him with an interesting proposal \u2014 be a player and a coach for them.\n\n\u201cHe was always a guy who had a good head for the game,\u201d said Danton Cole, who was the head coach of the Griffins at the time and is now Michigan State\u2019s men\u2019s head coach. \u201cWe talked to him about a lot of stuff anyhow, so it was a good kind of progression there. It was something that made our spot interesting for him. He was still playing, and I\u2019ve had player-assistants before; you try to involve them in certain parts and give them a flavor of what coaching is like. It\u2019s a lot different than what we think of as a player.\u201d\n\nKing mainly assisted on special teams and provided insight into what he was seeing on the ice. He remained player-assistant for two seasons, but there wasn\u2019t a full-time coaching position available after that.\n\nAfter the 2003-04 season, he permanently moved to Arizona, where he owned some real estate properties. He coached his eldest son, D.J., occasionally helped out at some pro camps and golfed. He and his wife later had twin sons while living in Arizona.\n\n\u201cAnd then my twins came and my golf game went pfft,\u201d King said.\n\nThat was his life and might have remained his life until Dallas Eakins called one day. They had played and roomed together while with the Toronto Maple Leafs and became good friends. When Eakins was hired as Toronto Marlies head coach in 2009, he first sought an assistant with coaching experience and hired Gord Dineen. There were fewer parameters with the second assistant position, and he thought of his old friend.\n\n\u201cDerek King was coaching kids in Scottsdale, like helping kids out, and I just thought he would be an unbelievable coach, even though he had no pro experience, because he had played for so long, he had played for Al Arbour, he had played for Pat Quinn, and I think when you play for great coaches whether you\u2019re cognizant of it or not, you\u2019re learning great lessons from them,\u201d said Eakins, who is now the head coach of the Anaheim Ducks. \u201cAnd then just the way Kinger\u2019s personality was, I just thought he was really going to see the game through the players\u2019 eyes, and I really believe that\u2019s a massive part of the coaching process. And so that\u2019s kind of where it started.\u201d\n\nDerek King was a first-round draft pick by the New York Islanders in 1985. (Getty Images)\n\nKing wasn\u2019t really aware of the impact Arbour and Quinn, who are third and sixth in NHL coaching victories, had on him at the time, but he does recognize it now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI played in a time where the video and the iPads on the bench, there was none of that,\u201d King said. \u201cCoaches coached with feel. They had a feel for the game and they just knew how to manage players, so I had some great coaches that did that. Al Arbour was huge. \u2026 Because he used to ride me, but then when you retire and you start coaching kids, you understand why he was riding me: to make me a better player, better person, so I take stuff from him. Pat Quinn was another guy like that. He just had a way with things. He knew how to push buttons, he knew who to hug, who to kick in the butt, and he was excellent at it. I go to Toronto and I\u2019m getting kicked in the butt and yelled at, and I\u2019m wondering why, but I figured it out: I drove these coaches nuts. Now it\u2019s time for guys to drive me nuts.\u201d\n\nRay Ferraro witnessed Arbour driving King nuts. Ferraro played with King under Arbour while with the Islanders.\n\n\u201cHe was hard on Kinger because he knew Kinger had lots more,\u201d Ferraro said. \u201cHe knew Kinger had more than Kinger thought he had. And so, Kinger got 40 goals for Al. \u2026 Kinger could score, and Al kept pushing him for more because he knew he had it.\u201d\n\nWith Eakins\u2019 Marlies coaching offer, King jumped at the chance. Eakins gave him a lot of responsibility early on and put him in charge of the forwards. King had some things to learn, but he had a lot of coaching instincts already.\n\nKing was Eakins\u2019 assistant for four years with the Marlies. Eakins moved on and King stayed. He was then an assistant under Steve Spott during 2013-14 season and then an associate coach for Dineen for a season.\n\nAfter the 2014-15 season, King was let go by the Maple Leafs while the organization went through staff changes. King took an assistant position with the Owen Sound Attack of the OHL the following season, but he found the team was too far from his home in the Toronto area and only coached there for one season.\n\nMark Bernard and Derek King both grew up in Hamilton, Ontario. King was nearly two years older than Bernard, but they hung out within the same group of hockey players and skated together a lot of summers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBernard and King had kept in touch a bit over the years, so it wasn\u2019t completely out of the blue when King rang Bernard after the 2015-16 season and asked if the Blackhawks were looking for any coaches. King had just left his OHL position.\n\nIt just happened the Blackhawks were searching for a new assistant for the IceHogs. The problem is they had already interviewed a number of people and Stan Bowman, then the Blackhawks general manager, was close to a final decision.\n\n\u201cIn Stan\u2019s mind, he really liked one of the applicants,\u201d Bernard said. \u201cAnd I kind of begged, kind of said, \u2018No, let\u2019s just interview him in Buffalo. We\u2019re going to the draft and he can drive up from Hamilton. Trust me, you\u2019ll love this guy as an applicant.\u2019 Stan held off and we interviewed him before the draft in Buffalo, and it worked out and Stan loved him and he got the job and off we went.\u201d\n\nKing was an assistant under Ted Dent his first season with the IceHogs. It was a trying season for the team, and Dent was fired after it. King was retained and became an assistant for Jeremy Colliton.\n\nUnder Colliton, King had more of a vocal role at times.\n\n\u201cWhen (King) was the assistant coach, Jeremy wasn\u2019t much of a scream and yell guy,\u201d said Tyler Sikura, who played for the IceHogs from 2017-2020. \u201cWhen we needed that, that would be Kinger\u2019s kind of job to step in, make sure everybody\u2019s on their toes. If he wasn\u2019t happy with how things were going, he was going to let you know about it.\u201d\n\nDerek King became the Rockford IceHogs coach early into the 2018-19 season. (Nathan Vestal/IceHogs)\n\nThe IceHogs reached the playoffs that season. Colliton and King returned together for the 2018-19 season. When the Blackhawks fired Joel Quenneville early into the season, Colliton was promoted to head coach of the Blackhawks, and King was made the IceHogs\u2019 interim head coach. King was given the job permanently after the season.\n\nWhile King did know how to push his players\u2019 buttons like his former coaches, he knows where the balance is at and often leans towards keeping the atmosphere light.\n\n\u201cHe knows when it\u2019s time to be serious with them, but at the same time, he puts them at ease where he can talk to them and be one of the guys,\u201d Bernard said. \u201cWhen he was the assistant coach here, he\u2019d go out and play (two)-touch soccer with them before the game. And we used to always laugh because he\u2019d go out to play and come right back. We\u2019d be like, \u2018I thought you\u2019re to play soccer.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, they got me.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen Jeremy got called up to Chicago and Derek took over here, that was my main point of advice for him \u2014 just be yourself, the guys love you. They play hard for you. Just continue to be yourself because that\u2019s what the players love, and he did that, to his credit. The players here in Rockford, I know, all enjoyed playing for him.\u201d\n\nDylan Sikura, another one of King\u2019s former players, did enjoy playing for him, but he also recalled him not leaving the soccer games so graciously.\n\n\u201cDefinitely a players coach,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cKept it very loose around the locker room but demanded a lot from his guys. Was always cracking jokes always, keeping it light. You could tell he got a real joy being around the guys like when he used to play. He would play sewer ball (also known as two-touch soccer) with our team and refuse to get out. I remember one time we were down in a (hockey) game going into the third not playing well at all. In between periods, he said that we\u2019re going back to minor hockey, which meant when you get off the ice you enter in one (bench) door and exit in the other. No lines, no pairs. Whenever you get off, that\u2019s who you would go with. I remember playing some shifts with five forwards or sometimes D playing forward. We ended up coming back and winning.\u201d\n\nCody Franson had come to the decision he wasn\u2019t going to return to the KHL last season and would pursue a team to play for in North America again. He looked at his options and thought immediately about the IceHogs.\n\nFranson had already been through one stint with the IceHogs while under contract with the Blackhawks during the 2017-18 season. Back then, King was an assistant for the IceHogs. With King as the head coach this time around, Franson felt good about returning to Rockford.\n\n\u201cRight away I reached out to my agent and asked him to reach out to Rockford to see if it would work just because I knew Kinger was there,\u201d Franson said. \u201cI loved playing for Kinger. We had a great relationship. Him and Anders took that approach of trying to use the brains around them to potentially bounce things off of, and Colly (Colliton) did the same thing when I was there for the first time. I really enjoyed my role and really enjoyed working with Kinger, Colly and Anders the first time. That just made it very easy to reach out and hope something would happen with Rockford obviously. I had great relationships with everyone that was there, and Kinger was a massive part of that.\u201d\n\nThe 2020-21 season was challenging for the IceHogs. There was everything COVID-related that all teams had to go through, but the IceHogs were also young and inexperienced. Franson had played more pro seasons than nearly all of the IceHogs\u2019 defensemen combined. A 9-4 loss to the Iowa Wild on March 3 gave them a 1-6-1 start to the season.\n\nKing and the IceHogs battled through the ensuing months, continued to focus on development more than anything and finished with a 12-19-1 record.\n\n\u201cI know last year was really tough in Rockford,\u201d Franson said. \u201cThey took a very developmental approach to it and it was a struggle. I think our group last year in Rockford came a long way. At the start, we were a group that was very young and very green and had a ton to learn, a lot more than you usually do with a team. Man, to be able to come out with a record that we came out with, just shows how much work he put in and how good of a coach he is because that wasn\u2019t an easy thing to do to turn that into a respectable season.\u201d\n\nDerek King has been with the Blackhawks organization since 2016. (Scott Powers / The Athletic)\n\nIt helped that King bought into what the Blackhawks were doing developmentally. He wasn\u2019t concerned about wins and losses as some AHL coaches can be when their sights are on becoming NHL coaches.\n\n\u201cObviously I think he wanted to be a head coach, at least in the American League, but I think he\u2019s not a guy who is on a certain track looking to make it to a certain place,\u201d said Tyler Sikura, who was a captain under King. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who enjoys what he\u2019s doing day to day. I think he was enjoying working with some of the younger guys. He has a couple of younger kids. He\u2019d bring them out for practice and things like that. It\u2019s a lot of pressure to be an NHL head coach. Obviously, when everybody\u2019s in this business, you want to have ultimate success, you want to make it there, but I don\u2019t think that was the kind of thing that struck you with him. \u2026 He\u2019s enjoying what he\u2019s doing and he loves being around the game and he loves being around the guys, and that\u2019s kind of his day-to-day approach.\u201d\n\nSorensen and King discussed that very topic during their last few seasons together.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve obviously gotten close over the years, and we\u2019ve had a lot of conversations about this,\u201d Sorensen. said. \u201cSo just being happy where your two feet are right now. Where you are right now, be happy with it and do the best and make the best out of that situation. \u201d\n\nRay Ferraro tuned into Derek King\u2019s introductory news conference as Blackhawks interim coach to see his former teammate.\n\n\u201cI was watching the press conference and Kinger\u2019s up there, he\u2019s fiddling around with the mic and his hands were on the mic, and the way he talked and the way he answered the questions, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, my god, it\u2019s Kinger,'\u201d Ferraro said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same guy. He just got no hair. Because he had a long mane when we played. He didn\u2019t get to shaving it down until much later. But it looks very familiar. I was really happy to see him sitting there. I don\u2019t know. I was just really happy. I saw him out on the ice and he had a toque on. Like, it\u2019s just what I would expect.\u201d\n\nWearing a winter hat during practices is very unique to King.\n\n\u201cThe way he does, no, (I\u2019ve never had a coach do that),\u201d Tyler Sikura said. \u201cThat\u2019s his own style, I would say.\u201d\n\nFranson said while laughing, \u201cI think that Kinger\u2019s thing.\u201d\n\nWhile different, it does speak to King saying true to himself. When King was named Blackhawks interim coach, Eakins called him and reminded him of a few things. The conversation was a lot like what Bernard said to King when he became the IceHogs head coach.\n\n\u201cKinger played what, I don\u2019t know, probably 16 years or more pro, he\u2019s been coaching for a long time, too, so he has this vast amount of experience, as did I, but as much as you\u2019re ready, and you know you\u2019re ready, when you get that first job, there is the first few days like, holy man, I\u2019m a head coach of an NHL team,\u201d Eakins said. \u201cAnd I simply called him to remind him of how many games he played in the NHL, remember Al Arbour, remember Pat Quinn, remember all the lessons you\u2019ve learned along the way, and that he was 100 percent ready for this and to trust his instinct.\u201d\n\nKing doing just that throughout his career path, first as a player and now as a coach, has led to him accumulating a lot of people in his life who wish to see him do well.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of people excited for that man,\u201d Eakins said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how my phone blew up from former staff people in other organizations, former players all, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s unbelievable for Kinger,\u2019 or, \u2018Do you have Kinger\u2019s new cell because the one I have isn\u2019t working.\u2019 It\u2019s amazing to me how much my phone blew up when he got the job. It\u2019s incredible because it\u2019s all people who love him and he\u2019s been able to have a positive effect on and influence. I think in the end, like, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a coach or what you do in your life, when something good is happening for you and people are excited for you, I think that\u2019s a real true mark on what mark you\u2019ve left on their lives.\u201d\n\n(Photo: Bill Smith / NHLI via Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/3901328/2022/11/16/blackhawks-assistant-coach-derek-king/", "page_content": "Practice, practically speaking, ended 10 or 15 minutes earlier, but Derek King was still out there on the ice, feeding one-timers to wingers. It was an optional skate at the Honda Center in Anaheim, and Arvid S\u00f6derblom \u2014 the only goaltender who took the ice \u2014 already was back in the locker room, so the Blackhawks were using a very basic \u201cshooter tutor,\u201d a simple mesh net that filled up most of the goal, with small openings along the top shelf, two more below where the goalie\u2019s glove and blocker would be, and a five-hole slot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Blackhawks \u2014 well, the third- and fourth-liners who didn\u2019t choose to take the option that afternoon \u2014 kept drawing iron or hitting the net. They were making this thing look like Tony Esposito. So King \u2014 a 40-goal scorer 30 years ago \u2014 called for the puck himself, and promptly tucked it into the top-left corner on the first try. The players cheered, and King smiled broadly as he swung around the net, very much in his element.\n\nThis is what King likes doing best \u2014 working with players, teaching and actually coaching. And this is what he didn\u2019t do enough of last season. There was always somewhere else to be, something else to do, someone else to talk to.\n\n\u201cYou look at Luke (Richardson) and he\u2019s doing a good job of it \u2014 he\u2019s coaching, right?\u201d King said following that practice last Friday. \u201cI kind of got away from that last year. I had to do media, or I had to be here, or I\u2019m about to be there, I have to put out fires, I have to get ready and everything. I managed my time maybe not as good as I should have.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that King didn\u2019t enjoy his stint as the Blackhawks\u2019 interim head coach following Jeremy Colliton\u2019s firing in early November last season. Nor is it to say King isn\u2019t proud of the work he did in taking over a moribund team at arguably the nadir of franchise history and almost singlehandedly flipping the vibe around while turning it into a competitive squad. Nor does it mean King didn\u2019t want to keep the job. He very much wanted to keep the job.\n\nBut this is where he\u2019s happiest. This is where he\u2019s doing the most good. This is where he belongs. The title is almost irrelevant.\n\nPerhaps no one else in the league would have accepted an assistant coaching job with the same team for which he was just the head coach.\n\nDerek King. (Bill Smith / NHL I via Getty Images)\n\nBut perhaps no one in the league is quite like Derek King. He\u2019s an anomaly in the NHL. There\u2019s no ego there, no chip on his shoulder, no sneering defiance burning within. Even as head coach, as the voice of the team, there was no spin, no polish, no false veneer to hide behind. He is exactly what he looks like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd what he looks like is a guy who\u2019s really enjoying himself.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what people have said to me \u2014 \u2018Why would you want to do that?\u2019\u201d King said. \u201cThey think I should be like, \u2018Screw you! You don\u2019t think I can coach?\u2019 But that has nothing to do with it. They feel I can help and they wanted to keep me on. And why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nReally, there are plenty of reasons why he wouldn\u2019t. For one, yeah, it\u2019s hard not to be at least a little insulted when a team picks someone else to take your job \u2014 general manager Kyle Davidson gave King \u201cthe old we\u2019re going in a different direction speech,\u201d King said. For another, just about every assistant coach in the league harbors dreams of becoming a head coach in the NHL, King included. And the chances of a demoted former interim coach becoming the head coach of that same team seem awfully slim. Especially when the new coach is just starting a four-year contract and has the kind of long leash that only comes with an openly declared rebuild. Surely, the path back to bench boss would be more navigable as an assistant on another NHL team. Then there\u2019s the ego hit that comes with walking into the same room with the same players as an assistant coach after being the top guy for nearly a full season.\n\nKing shrugged all of that off.\n\n\u201cHaving the opportunity to stay with the organization and be a part of this rebuild, I didn\u2019t hesitate,\u201d King said. \u201cThis is where I started right? This is what I was. I was the assistant coach. I did skills after practice, I worked with guys individually, I got into the video and stuff. So now I\u2019m back doing all that, and I\u2019m really enjoying it. I missed it.\u201d\n\nDavidson knew King was wired differently than most coaches, and he knew he wanted him back on staff. But ultimately, he wasn\u2019t sure King \u2014 or Richardson \u2014 would be comfortable with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even really our call,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cWe said to Luke, \u2018You know what, your staff is your business. But this guy is a great guy, and he\u2019s got a great way with players, and I think he could be a really good counterpoint. But you\u2019ve got to talk to him and you\u2019ve got to feel the same way.\u2019\u201d\n\nRichardson didn\u2019t need much prodding. The two played against each other in the Ontario Hockey League, both broke into the NHL at the same time in 1987-88, had long and successful NHL careers (21 years for Richardson, 13 for King), and then coached against each other in the American Hockey League. They respected each other well enough that Richardson didn\u2019t even need to get mutual buddy Dallas Eakins\u2019 blessing before offering him the job.\n\nFacing both reality and a long-term rebuild, Richardson wanted to build a more modern coaching staff to suit today\u2019s young players \u2014 one built on hands-on teaching and open communication, not fire and brimstone. King fit the mold perfectly, and his knowledge of most of the roster from his time in Chicago and as Rockford\u2019s head coach made it an easy call.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to have a personality as a coaching staff that we can teach and not be yelling and screaming and demanding things that are unachievable at this moment,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cWe wanted to build and teach and learn and work well together and have a calmer demeanor doing that, so we can get that point across. After a while, players just tune that out if you\u2019re always yelling and screaming. And so I thought it was a good fit. I think it\u2019s working out really well.\u201d\n\nWhen Davidson had settled on Richardson and had given King the \u201cdifferent direction\u201d spiel, King asked about his contract. Davidson, hoping that Richardson would indeed want King on his staff, told King not to worry about that just yet, because Richardson was likely to call.\n\nKing spent a couple of days mulling the offer with his wife and three sons. But deep down, he knew what his answer was going to be the moment Richardson made the offer.\n\n\u201cIt was a no-brainer,\u201d King said. \u201cAnd plus, I didn\u2019t have to update my resume and chum it out and make phone calls. I\u2019ve been through that. The fact that he wanted me and management still wanted me, I thought, well, that\u2019s a good thing, right? That\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how Davidson got to essentially hire a coach he really liked, fire a coach he really liked, yet somehow keep both.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not entirely surprised (King accepted the job) because he has no ego,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cAnd I think he genuinely loves being part of the organization, he liked how we do things and how we operate. It\u2019s a testament to the person that he is and the lack of ego that he has that he was willing to do it. He saw that it was a good situation with a good head coach and he could still be involved at the NHL level and really help us push this thing forward. So yes and no. I was a little surprised, but I was relieved that he wanted to stay.\u201d\n\nAnd hey, King might have been demoted, but he got a new three-year contract out of it \u2014 and a raise.\n\n\u201cPretty good deal,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nAssistants are critical to running a successful team \u2014 working on individual skills, running special-teams meetings, cleaning up messes and soothing bruised egos left by the head coach. But unlike coordinators in football, they operate out of the limelight. So assuming his five months as interim coach were his last as head coach of the Blackhawks, King is likely to go down as a mere footnote in franchise history.\n\nBut what he accomplished in those five months shouldn\u2019t be forgotten.\n\nKing arrived from Rockford on a Saturday morning in November to take over a team that entered the season with playoff hopes but started 1-9-2, that had just played one of the worst games imaginable in a pathetic 5-1 loss in Winnipeg, just 11 days after the Jenner & Block report laid bare all the franchise\u2019s sins in one of the darkest days in franchise history.\n\nInto a sullen and embittered locker room walked this soft-spoken, self-deprecating, folksy guy with wacky uncle energy, an arsenal of dad jokes and zero NHL coaching experience. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mood changed dramatically. Instantly. The Blackhawks won their first four games under King. Players started having fun again. They never had a chance of sniffing contention after that horrid start, but King managed to salvage the season to an unlikely degree. He convinced his players to loosen up a bit out there. He reinforced his mantra of \u201chabits protect you,\u201d constantly reminding players that if they have good habits on the ice, their mistakes will be minimal and minimized. He tweaked the way the Blackhawks played in the neutral zone and the defensive zone. He was critical when necessary, but encouraging always. He was unceasingly honest, even when it meant being harsh \u2014 whether he was talking to a player one-on-one or in a press conference.\n\nHe might not have been the biggest Xs and Os guy, but he fundamentally changed the team all the same.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just his personality,\u201d said Reese Johnson, who played for King in Rockford and Chicago. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes him a good coach and gives him a good relationship with the players. He knows when to be critical and he knows when to keep you going. He has good balance. I think Kinger did an unbelievable job going from head coach in Rockford to head coach in Chicago, and now to assistant coach. The one that thing stands out to me the most is throughout those years, he\u2019s just always been himself. He really hasn\u2019t changed throughout his roles.\u201d\n\nKing behind the bench during the 2021-22 season. (Steph Chambers / Getty Images)\n\nBut King had been thrown straight into the deep end, and really, he was just trying to keep his head above water. As head coach in Rockford, he basically managed a staff of one and only had to answer to the local PR guy and Rockford GM Mark Bernard. His job was to develop players; everything else was secondary, even winning. In Chicago, in his own words, \u201cEverybody\u2019s watching, and everybody\u2019s judging.\u201d\n\nSo he leaned on assistant coach and former head coach Marc Crawford \u2014 the only holdover from Colliton\u2019s staff \u2014 to handle much of the job. Crawford often ran practices. Crawford handled a lot of the Xs and Os. Crawford even chose King\u2019s second assistant coach, Rob Cookson, because King didn\u2019t really know anybody around the league. The hours got away from him, he wasn\u2019t getting his own workouts in the way he\u2019d like, and the commute to see his family back in Rockford took a toll on him (and on his wife, who was often dealing with the three boys while King stayed in a place he had in Chicago).\n\nKing loved every second of it. But he felt every second of it, too.\n\n\u201cIt was tiring,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking back on it, King can see what he did right and what he could have done better, how he could have made things easier on himself and had a better work-life balance. But he wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call them regrets. He knows the challenge he faced, and how improbable (if modest) his success was.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of it, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cWould I change things? Sure, I would, knowing what I know now. That\u2019s natural. But going into it, I felt I did what I needed to do, and what I felt was the right thing. So I sleep at night.\u201d\n\nAs that practice in Anaheim wound down, King was one of the last guys off the ice, lingering to work on some skills work with the stragglers. Richardson had long left; the press was waiting, and there were probably a dozen other things he had to handle before heading back to the hotel. It\u2019s Richardson who has to tell guys that they\u2019ll be scratched or sent to Rockford. It\u2019s Richardson who has to delegate assignments to his staff. It\u2019s Richardson who has to meet with Davidson to discuss the depth chart. It\u2019s Richardson who has to sit down with team leaders and get the pulse of the room. It\u2019s Richardson who has to handle the surprisingly sprawling bureaucracy of running an NHL locker room.\n\nIt used to be King who did all that. But now King gets to be the good cop, bucking a player up after the head coach has to break him down a bit. Now King gets to have the time to sit down with a player one-on-one to go over the little details of a botched power play, or to reinforce the habits of a good penalty kill. Now King gets to linger on the ice and fire off one-timers.\n\nIt\u2019s all a little less difficult this season for King. He moved his family to the western suburb of Glen Ellyn; his kids love the high school and his twins play hockey at Johnny\u2019s IceHouse West, just a few blocks from the United Center. He\u2019s found that work-life balance that he never managed last season, not after suddenly being thrust into someone else\u2019s burning house and handed a watering can.\n\n\u201cThe hours are still there, but it\u2019s maybe not quite as stressful,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what I need to do, how I can help. I ask (Richardson) what he needs. I come in the morning, do my stuff, leave and go home. It\u2019s been great. I\u2019m enjoying it.\u201d\n\nWould King love to be the Blackhawks\u2019 head coach? Of course, he would. Does he think he deserved the job? Of course, he does. Will he try to become a head coach in the NHL again? Of course, he will. But while most coaches wouldn\u2019t be caught dead accepting a demotion and would instead defiantly storm off into the unknown in search of another job, King isn\u2019t like most coaches.\n\nHe was offered a job in the NHL. In an organization he knew well. With a roster full of players he cared about. To work for a coach he respected and liked. To do what he loves best \u2014 to teach, to grind, to coach.\n\nAnd what\u2019s so bad about that?\n\n\u201cWhen I was in Rockford, I never even thought about (an NHL job),\u201d King said. \u201cBut once I got it and I got comfortable and it was the end of the year, I\u2019m like, \u2018This ain\u2019t a bad gig.\u2019 So whether it\u2019s as a head guy or as an assistant, it\u2019s the NHL. It\u2019s pretty nice. It\u2019s been great this year, it honestly has. I can\u2019t think of one negative thing about it.\u201d\n\n(Photo of Derek King: John J.

Why not, right?\u2019\n\n\u201cI mean, I was in shock. Had a chat with (interim GM) Kyle (Davidson). And I was just like, \u2018Wow, OK. Yeah, sure, I\u2019ll do it.

After trading for goalie Marc-Andre Fleury and defenseman Seth Jones in the offseason and getting captain Jonathan Toews back after the center missed all of last season because of chronic immune response syndrome, Chicago was 1-9-2 when Colliton was fired. They are 3-0-0 with King as coach heading into their game at the Seattle Kraken on Wednesday (10 p.m. ET; TNT, TVAS, NHL LIVE).\n\nKing had been coach of Rockford, the Blackhawks' American Hockey League affiliate, since the 2018-19 season after being an assistant there from 2016-18. He also has been an assistant with Toronto of the AHL and a player-assistant with Grand Rapids, the Detroit Red Wings' AHL affiliate. Prior to coaching, the 54-year-old played in 830 NHL games over 14 seasons as a forward with the New York Islanders, Hartford Whalers, Toronto Maple Leafs and St. Louis Blues, scoring 612 points (261 goals, 351 assists). He scored 21 points (four goals, 17 assists) in 47 Stanley Cup Playoff games.\n\nKing has a laid-back demeanor and good sense of humor, something that has come through in media sessions and, players say, with them in meetings and practices. His personality is evident in this Q&A with NHL.com, in which he discusses everything from hockey to toques to pet lizards.\n\nAssistant Marc Crawford and player development adviser Chris Kunitz do their share of teaching at the dry-erase board during practice. How much is this a collaborative coaching effort?\n\n\"It's all been. I've relied on those guys tremendously. It's whether I'm on the board doing a drill or 'Crow.' The big thing with Crow and 'Kuny' is the structured stuff. I don't want to tweak anything right now, so a lot of drills they've done, and they know. I don't want to change that. The drills we're using are the drills they know and how they're working on it. A lot of those drills, I've never seen run, so I have to let these guys do their thing. I'm not just going to say, 'You know what, you're not on the board, I'm on the board. We're going to do my drills.' I think it would have just shocked them. So I'm relying on them to guide me in those drills and learn them and we'll see where they go. Maybe coming into December, we have to tweak something, so then we'll sit down and talk about it. But I'm not one to come in here to look and take over and 'You can't tell me what to do.' I'm here to learn, too, and we have to learn from each other. They don't work for me, we work together. I expect them to just fill me with information as we go here, and that's what they've been doing.\"\n\nHow do you feel the Blackhawks are responding thus far?\n\n\"It's easier when you put some wins together. Anytime a coach is fired, the players take it personally. That first game, when the new coach comes, they usually have a lot of energy. And I think that's what happened, but I think they're starting to realize doing it together and playing for each other is actually not a bad thing and they can win some hockey games. The big thing here is to keep the energy level up. That's what I have to do, keep them playing, like a free game where if you make a mistake, that's OK, just try not to make it five times in a row, that's all. That's what I'm trying to do here. We'll give them their structured stuff, we're not going to tweak anything. Crow and Kuny have been great working with what we have and showing me the different systems they're playing. If we need to tweak, then we'll all step in and we'll collaborate and see where we have to be.\"\n\nSeems you wear a different toque at every practice. How many do you have?\n\n\"I'm getting there, I'm building it. I'm always welcoming different colors or what have you, but it's coming. I think I have three or four different ones and three or four ones at the United Center. So I'll wear them.\"\n\nYou had a pretty nice playing career. How much did you enjoy those days, especially your 11 seasons with the Islanders?\n\n\"It was great. you look back, we always have little group chats going and we usually hook up in the summers for golf tournaments in New York and you see old teammates. You start reminiscing about the old days. It was just a huge part of our lives to be able to not see guys for years and years, then when you see them for the first time in a while, it's like you're still in the locker room. It's great. I enjoyed everything. I enjoyed Toronto, even St. Louis and Hartford, even though it was just a cup of coffee (19 games with the Blues in 1999-2000; 12 games with the Whalers in 1996-97), it's a part of it, right? Just great teammates. You don't meet too many bad hockey people. I was fortunate. When I was a kid, you wanted to be an NHLer. Then all of a sudden, you're playing junior, then you get drafted and all of a sudden it happens quick. You never thought you could actually really do it, but I was fortunate, very lucky.\"\n\nLast year, ESPN ranked its best lines over the past 30 years, naming your line with Pierre Turgeon and Steve Thomas the best of the Islanders (1992-93):\n\n\"I did not know that. I always joke that Turgeon made my career. I thank him and hug him every time I see him. I saw him recently, too, so I gave him a big hug. They were great to play with. All three of us were three different style players. Obviously, Turgeon as good as he was, was an awesome player, but all three of us were different and we just seemed to hit it off on the ice and off the ice. It was a blast and those were the good days.\"\n\nYou got into coaching as a player/assistant in Grand Rapids in 2002. How did that come about?\n\n\"I played in Munich (Germany) and I had another year on my contract at the end of that first year and the team was moving to Hamburg. I was ready to go, and I kept in touch with our GM there, [Bob] McNamara, to see how things were going. We started talking and I started telling him that I was looking to get into some coaching. I thought maybe I'd play a couple of more years in Europe and maybe get into coaching there. But he said, 'Hold on, I'll call you back, let me make some phone calls.' He called Detroit's people, called me back two days later and said, 'I've got an NHL contract for you,' -- that's the only way I could get out of my deal -- 'and they'd love to have you as a player-coach and get into the coaching.' So I said 'Yeah,' and that was it. Two years of that and I got hurt a couple of times, so I had the opportunity to get on the bench with (coach) Danton Cole. It was good; you learn a lot. It was August when we were supposed to sit down and talk defining my job coming back there, they had moved some people around and other people were coming in, so the job wasn't there for me. That's when I moved to Arizona.\n\nDid I read correctly that, when you left Arizona for Toronto for an assistant job with the Marlies, you had pet lizards? Do you still have lizards?\n\n\"No, they've passed on since then. But yeah, I had my twins who in 2009 were around 2 years old, and my oldest was 7 or 8. Then I had three Labrador dogs, then I had fish, and we wanted to bring the fish, but I couldn't fit the tank in the back of the truck. So we got rid of the fish but as we were packing up, I looked in the back and there's this towel covering something. I took a peek, and my wife looked at me, said, 'Don't say anything. You're taking it,' and there they were. They were two gecko lizards, Dion and Igor. So they made the trip and they lived for a few years after that. But my wife wasn't letting me leave these lizards. If they were going to bring anything, they were bringing the lizards with them.\"\n\nSo you're definitely an animal lover. Any other interests outside of hockey?\n\n\"Outside of hockey? I have kids. That's my interest. No, I used to golf a lot, but just with the kids, they're busy and I like to be a part of it. As you know, our schedules, whether as a player or coach in the NHL or any league, you're gone a lot, so you miss out on these things. Summertime comes, we have a place in Florida, so we go down there and spend time with each other: bike rides, on the beach, just doing little things like that. We try to spend as much time together as we can. We drive each other nuts but that's what we do.\""}, {"url": "https://ebiographypost.com/sports/coaches/derek-king-bio-net-worth-wife-children", "page_content": "Derek King is a one-time Canadian professional ice hockey player who competed from 1986 to 2000 as a left winger in the National Hockey League. He currently serves the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL as an assistant coach.\n\nNew fans of the ice hockey professional might be eager to learn about him. So, let's get to know more about Derek King and see how he went from playing to coaching in this biography.\n\nAn\u017ee Kopitar Biography - Hockey Player\n\nDerek King Net Worth And Career\n\nIncluding his career as an athlete and a coach, the former left winger has been actively involved in hockey for over 35 years. He must have bagged a massive fortune throughout the years. Likewise, Derek King's net worth must be immense.\n\nThe sportsman was drafted 13th overall by the New York Islanders in the NHL Entry Draft in 1985 and made his NHL debut in the 1986-87 season. He also played for Hartford Whalers, Toronto Maple Leafs, and St. Louis Blues of NHL. In addition, he also competed for different teams in leagues other than NHL. For example, King played for Grand Rapids Griffins in IHL and AHL and Oshawa Generals in the OHL. In his career as an NHL athlete, he played 830 games, scored 261 goals and 351 assists, and earned 612 points.\n\nNow, let's look at some of Derek's playing statistics in the table below:\n\nSeason Team Games Played Goals Scored Points 1996\u201397 New York Islanders 70 23 53 1997\u201398 Toronto Maple Leafs 77 21 46 1998\u201399 Toronto Maple Leafs 81 24 52\n\nTable Source: NHL Official Website\n\nAfter retiring from playing, the Hamilton native started his career as a coach in August 2009, when he became the assistant coach of the Toronto Marlies, the AHL affiliate team of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Five years later, in 2014, he was promoted to associate coach. Then, in July 2015, Derek became the OHL's Owen Sound Attack's assistant coach. However, he left the team in just three months, in October.\n\nFinally, in July 2016, King was named an assistant coach of the Rockford IceHogs of the American Hockey League, which is the minor league affiliate of the Chicago Blackhawks. He was later promoted to the interim head coach of the IceHogs on November 6, 2018. Eventually, he landed his first head coaching position at the end of the 2018-19 season.\n\nThe 1967-born sportsperson became the interim head coach of the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL on November 2, 2021. Just a day later, he earned his first win with the Blackhawks, defeating the Nashville Predators. Sadly, he was let go from the position on June 27, 2022. However, on July 11, 2022, Chicago Blackhawks announced Derek's return as an assistant coach for the 2022-23 season.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, veteran assistant coaches, with little head coaching experience, earn between $500,000 and $700,000 per year. Since King also previously served as a head coach, he must also earn in a similar range. Hence, Derek King's net worth must be a significant amount.\n\nLikewise, John Gibson is another sports celebrity with a massive net worth.\n\nDerek King Is Happily Married\n\nAs the title suggests, the Canadian coach enjoys a blissful marital life with his partner. But unfortunately, little to no information about his beloved spouse is known to the public as of now. Even the name of his missus has not been disclosed yet, making it hard to find her on social media. In addition, Mrs. King completely stays away from the limelight. Perhaps she prefers to keep a low profile.\n\nNonetheless, Derek has talked about his other half a few times in some of his interviews. Once in an interview with Chicago Tribune, while talking about how hectic his NHL schedule is, he revealed that Mrs. King controlled everything and got everything figured out. He also added that she is a huge supporter of his career. Hopefully, we will get to learn more about Derek King's wife in the future.\n\nProud Father Of Three\n\nThe former left winger and his spouse are parents of three lovely boys. Their eldest is D.J. King, who was born on August 7, 2000, in Scottsdale, Arizona. Derek King's son is pursuing a career in hockey and following in his footsteps. He is a professional hockey player who competes in the East Coast Hockey League as a Defense for the Fort Wayne Komets.\n\nDerek King shares three lovely sons with his wife. Image Source: Derek King's Twitter.\n\nDerek King's other children are a set of twins who arrived when he was living in Arizona. But, as in the case of his wife, along with their birth details, the names of his baby boys remain a mystery. Regardless, according to the coach's bio on his Twitter account, his younger kids also love the game of hockey. They often go to the Rockford Hockey Club rink for games and practices. So, could the twins be planning on becoming ice hockey players in the future?\n\nIs From Hamilton\n\nThe coach was welcomed by his parents on February 11, 1967, in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Sadly, information regarding Derek King's mother and father, including their names, has yet to be revealed. Likewise, he has not disclosed much about his other family members. Perhaps, his parents and siblings are people of privacy and want to stay away from the limelight.\n\nFurthermore, not much has been made known about the assistant coach himself. Due to this reason, it is difficult to learn about his childhood. It seems he is also a secretive person and isn't eager to share about his life before starting his hockey career.\n\nWell, it's unfortunate that Derek King has not opened up much about his personal life. Hopefully, we will learn about his parents, wife, and children in the days ahead. Nonetheless, with his fortune likely to grow with his career, he must enjoy a comfortable life. We wish him and his close ones lead a happy and prosperous life in the future.\n\nTrivia And Facts"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/derek.king/2384657", "page_content": "Derek King\n\nAugust 15, 1929 (age 73) London Borough of Hackney, Greater London, United Kingdom\n\nAfter leaving school aged 14 he trained as a tie maker and played his early football for Alexander Palace football club in 1945.

Like I said, he\u2019s just been a role model ever since. We just have a great relationship. It\u2019s just awesome.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day Sunday, D.J. touched base with his dad, but he knew Derek was exhausted from the previous two days.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he needed sleep, D.J. said. \u201cI let him be.\u201d\n\nDerek confirmed he needed just that.\n\n\u201cI passed out,\u201d Derek said of his postgame celebration. \u201cI had an ice-cold drink after and then I passed right out. I slept right through. I was tired. It was good.\u201d\n\nThose couple of days will certainly be forever remembered by father and son.\n\n(Photo: Jonathan Daniel / Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/4-footballers-played-as-both-centre-back-and-defensive-midfielder-successfully", "page_content": "\u201cAttack wins you matches, but defence wins you tournaments,\" goes the popular saying in football.\n\nA good defender is arguably even more important than a good attacking player for deciding a team\u2019s fortunes, because of the simple fact that a team cannot lose if it does not concede a goal. However, not all defenders are similar in their playing style. Some are easy on the ball and good passers, while some are tough tacklers and man-markers.\n\nThe position of a defensive midfielder is very important in today\u2019s football, as no team plays without one. The defensive midfielders shield the backline by thwarting opposition attacks in the midfield. Sometimes, they play as the de facto third centre back and create attacks from the midfield.\n\nIt is not easy for a player to play both as a defensive midfielder and as a centre-back because of the different demands of those two positions. A defensive midfielder has to venture into the opposition half at times, while a centre-back needs to have great positional awareness and anticipation skills.\n\nHere, we take a look at four greats of the game who have played in both the positions:\n\n1. Lothar Matthaus\n\nLothar Matthaus\n\nMatthaus remains one of the greatest and most versatile midfielders in the history of the game. He has played as a DM, CB, box-to-box midfielder and attacking midfielder for his country and clubs.\n\nMatthaus was renowned for his passing and shooting skills, and a stint at the Serie A made him a supreme ball-winner and tackler as well. He earned 150 caps for the German national team and played more than 750 club matches in his incredibly long career, which lasted 20 years.\n\nHe also scored 204 goals in his club career and 23 for his national team.\n\nMatthaus used to play as a defensive midfielder early on in his career and went on to blossom into a more complete player in course of time. He spent four fantastic seasons in the midfield for Inter Milan and played as centre-back for Bayern Munich in the latter part of his career.\n\nHe won seven Bundesliga titles for Bayern and one Serie A for Inter. In the 1999 Champions League final, Manchester United managed to score two goals only after Matthaus was substituted.\n\nMatthaus also played as a sweeper in the World Cup 1998 and Euro 2000 for the German national team, besides playing as a defensive midfielder in the 1986 and 1994 World Cups and as an attacking midfielder in the 1990 World Cup winning team.\n\n2. Marcel Desailly\n\nMarcel Desailly\n\nDesailly is one of the greatest defensive players the game has ever seen, and he too played in both positions.\n\nHe started his career as a DM for Nantes and Olympique Marseille, and became a better player while playing in the glorious AC Milan teams under Arrigo Sacchi and Fabio Capello.\n\nDesailly won one Champions League and one Serie A title for Milan in the five seasons he spent with them. He had also won one Champions League title with Marseille before that. He then moved to Chelsea and played as a centre-back for them for six seasons.\n\nDesailly was a brilliant tackler and very strong in the air, and those traits made him a great defender. He was also very strong physically and never shied away from one-to-one challenges.\n\nHe won the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 with the great French national team while playing as a centre-back. He won 116 caps for France in total.\n\nBoth the Milan side of the early 90s and the French national team of the late 90s were superb defensively, and Desailly was an intrinsic part of both. He also played in more than 600 club matches through his career.\n\n3. Fernando Hierro\n\nFernando Hierro\n\nHierro was a defensive player who scored more than 150 goals in his career, thanks to his prowess in set-pieces. He was easy on the ball and had very good distribution skills.\n\nHierro played as a sweeping centre-back for Real Madrid and as a defensive midfielder for the Spanish national team. Needless to add, he was very successful in both of those roles.\n\nHierro started his career at Valladolid and spent two seasons with the club before being signed by Real Madrid. He played with Real for 13 years and appeared in 610 matches for them. He also won three Champions League and five La Liga titles for them.\n\nHierro could not win any major silverware for the Spanish national side, but played in 89 matches and scored 29 goals for them.\n\nHe was one of the best exponents of the free-kick in his prime. But he was no slouch defensively, and remained a clean tackler throughout his career. He was also very strong in the air.\n\nHierro ended his club career with English club Bolton Wanderers and played as defensive midfielder for them too.\n\n4. Javier Mascherano\n\nJavier Mascherano\n\nMascherano is another player who is blessed with superb tackling and man-marking skills. He is also very brave and fast, and does not often evade challenges.\n\nMascherano started his career in Europe for West Ham and spent one season there. He then moved to Liverpool and played as a defensive midfielder for them.\n\nHe had considerably good ball skills and aided in attacks too. He spent five seasons with Liverpool and scored two goals in 132 matches for them.\n\nBarcelona signed him in 2010 and gradually, he became a centre-back for them. Mascherano\u2019s defensive instincts meant that he would regularly fall back into his own penalty box even while playing as a defensive midfielder. He was also extremely strong in the air and was dependable while defending set-pieces too.\n\nAfter Carles Puyol\u2019s retirement, Mascherano became a regular centre-back for Barcelona, with Gerard Pique as his defensive partner. He played 334 matches for Barcelona in eight seasons and won two Champions League and five La Liga titles with them.\n\nMascherano is the most capped player in the history of the Argentine national team, and won a World cup runner-up medal with them in 2014. He has appeared in four World Cups and played in 147 matches for Argentina. However, for the national side, Mascherano has played as a defensive midfielder throughout his career and been very successful at that too.\n\nPoll : 0 votes"}, {"url": "https://www.thefamouspeople.com/scottish-football-players.php", "page_content": "Famous Scottish Football Players\n\nRight IconThis ranking is based on an algorithm that combines various factors, including the votes of our users and search trends on the internet.\n\nIf you thought football is all about a ball being juggled by twenty players with two goalies trying to restrict its entrance at the ends of an approximately 130-yard pitch, you have been living under the rock for sure!
