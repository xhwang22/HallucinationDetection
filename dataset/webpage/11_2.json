View full image\n\nJust over 125 years ago, on October 30, 1893, the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition was scheduled to end with closing ceremonies after a six-month run in Chicago. Created to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Columbus\u2019s arrival in the New World, the fair was a showcase of American promise and achievement. And presiding over it was the city\u2019s popular mayor, Yale alumnus Carter Harrison Sr. \u201945. But the fair ended early when the mayor was assassinated on October 28.\n\nHarrison, who was related to US presidents William Henry Harrison and Benjamin Harrison, was descended from early Virginia planters. According to the memoir of Carter Harrison Jr. \u201983LLB, who would match his father\u2019s record of five terms as mayor of Chicago, Harrison Sr.\u2019s years in New Haven changed him. \u201cFour years at Yale in a New England anti-slavery environment had confirmed his latent dislike for slavery,\u201d Harrison Jr. wrote. After two years of study and travel abroad, Harrison Sr. sold the 600-acre family plantation in Kentucky. Although he once wrote a relative that \u201cto sell a man is to me one of the most disagreeable things I could possibly do,\u201d Harrison also sold the enslaved people living there.\n\nIn 1855, after completing his law studies at Transylvania University and a honeymoon trip to Chicago, he and his bride \u201cknew where they wanted to live,\u201d in his son\u2019s words. \u201cThey had fallen in love with the lusty lake city.\u201d Harrison mainly devoted himself to Chicago real estate, but from 1874 to 1878 he served in Congress as a Democrat. During that period, in 1876, his wife died; they\u2019d had ten children, though six died early. He was elected mayor in 1879 and served until 1887\u2014the year his second wife died. During the year of the fair, Harrison was elected mayor for a fifth term.\n\nHarrison was known as a \u201ccommon man\u2019s mayor\u201d whose \u201cdoor was always open.\u201d He loved riding his white horse through Chicago neighborhoods, waving and stopping to shake hands. He was very proud of the fair, especially of its gleaming \u201cWhite City,\u201d which introduced neoclassical Beaux Arts architecture to America. (The fa\u00e7ades were painted white, and daylight was reproduced at night by brilliant electric illumination.) The fair also celebrated pioneering efforts to develop the telephone, photography, motion pictures, and the automobile.\n\nOn October 28, a young man called at Harrison\u2019s home. The maid showed him in, and the mayor, just up from an after-dinner nap, greeted his visitor in the hall. The stranger pulled out a gun and fired three times, mortally wounding Harrison.\n\nThe assassin, Patrick Eugene Prendergast, turned himself in at a nearby police station. In The Devil in the White City (2003), Erik Larson writes that Prendergast said he killed Harrison \u201cbecause he betrayed my confidence. I supported him through his campaign and he promised to appoint me corporation counsel. He didn\u2019t live up to his word.\u201d Prosecutors maintained that Prendergast was delusional but not insane. The jury agreed, and the verdict was \u201cguilty.\u201d A last appeal by Clarence Darrow for an inquest to commute the death sentence on grounds of insanity failed. Prendergast was hanged on July 13, 1894.\n\nOn October 29, the celebratory close of the Exposition was canceled for a public memorial service. Harrison\u2019s funeral procession filled the city for an entire day. On the day of his death, Harrison had delivered his last public remarks\u2014at the fair\u2019s \u201cAmerican Cities Day,\u201d said to be the largest-ever gathering of American mayors. This final speech showed his pride in his adopted city: \u201cWhen the fire swept over our city and laid it in ashes in 24 hours, then the world said: \u2018Chicago and its boasting is now gone forever.\u2019 But Chicago said: \u2018We will rebuild the city better than ever\u2019 and Chicago has done it. . . .

After attending Yale College and finishing law school, his disgust with the institution of slavery motivated him to move north, to Illinois. In Chicago, he made his money in real estate.\n\nHarrison was first elected as mayor in 1879 and ran the city with a... personal touch, much like aldermen \"Bathhouse\" John Coughlin, or Edward F. (\"Foxey Ed\") Cullerton did. \"Bathhouse\" Coughlin, for example, was accused of having a profitable interest in the liquor store that supplied all the brotherls in the red light district of his ward.\n\nIn Chicago, the electorate expected a certain amount of corruption. \"Foxey Ed\" once ran on the idea that it was \"better [to] send back the man who has stolen enough already than to send in... a new man.\" On election day, some aldermen would give free drinks to anyone passing through (or passed out) in his district, in exchange for a vote. Still, when times were tough, the same aldermen were handing out free lunches to anyone who needed one, every day of the year.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, many people believed the Republican party to be patronizing and moralistic, and the Democrats more concerned with protecting \"individual liberties.\" Or, as one local pol put it: \"A Republican is a man who wants you to go t'church every Sunday. A Democrat says if a man wants to have a glass of beer he can have it.\" Harrison was a Democrat who let people have more than beer. \"This is a free town,\" he declared, and let the brothels and gambling parlors operate openly in the neighborhood called the Levee. By concentrating all the vice into one district, he checked its spread, and police patrols made sure that the businesses were fair and did not cheat their customers.\n\nHarrison supported and encouraged neighborhood ethnic saloons, local institutions that might function as meetinghouses, post offices and welfare offices in one. The saloon licenses also provided 12% of the city's revenue and paid for the electrical lines, streetcars, sewer pipes, fire and police stations that Harrison built. He was the first mayor to cater to the various ethnic groups in his city. On St. Patrick's Day he wore his finest green. Germans heard about his friendship with Bismarck. With Scandinavians he claimed a Viking heritage, and among blacks he recalled being raised by a \"colored mammy.\" He welcomed everyone to Chicago and did not try to acculturate them into Anglo-American society, the way Charles Hutchinson or Jane Addams did.\n\nEveryone who wanted a word with the mayor could come to his open morning office hours, and he would address their problems. He was a friend of organized labor, and gave health and factory inspector jobs to union leaders. Harrison was known to restrain police from breaking up strikes and supported the eight-hour workday. Because the mayor supported their cause, organizers of the national May Day general strike of 1886 focused on Chicago. Events escalated over the following days and violence broke out at Haymarket Square after the mayor left a rally there. After Haymarket, Harrison's leniency was cited disapprovingly as encouragement to the revolutionaries. He was voted out of office at the end of his fourth term.\n\nThen, as the World's Columbian Exposition was in preparation, Harrison made his comeback. He wanted to be mayor of Chicago for the most important event in its history. In his inaugural speech of 1893, he said:\n\n\"When years ago I stood before you, aldermen of Chicago, and took the oath which fitted me for this high office, Chicago had less than half a million population; to-day it is the sixth city on the face of the globe, the second in America in population, and the first city on earth in pluck, energy, and determination. Standing thus, I feel deep anxiety lest I may not fulfill the expectation of the vast majority of my fellow citizens who have honored me.\"\n\nThe fair was so successful that Harrison tried to keep it open for another season so that millions more people could come visit Chicago. In addition, he hoped the continued employment and infusion of tourist dollars would cushion Chicago from the looming economic depression. Two nights before the end of the fair, Patrick Eugene Joseph Prendergast, a lunatic demanding a city job, entered Harrison's home and shot him dead.\n\nA funeral procession of tens of thousands of Chicagoans followed Harrison's casket to Graceland Cemetery. Half a million stood in the street to watch as uniformed police officers and firemen, postal carriers and city clerks paraded by. Irish, German, Scandinavian, Polish and Italian communities all had representatives who marched. Union leaders mourned, as did the wealthy business elite who were Harrison's poker buddies."}, {"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Harrison_Jr.", "page_content": "Carter Henry Harrison, Jr. (April 23, 1860 \u2013 December 25, 1953) served as Mayor of Chicago (1897\u20131905 and 1911\u20131915).

Harrison served his first four terms around the turn of the twentieth century (1897-1905), with his final term running from 1911 until 1915. Harrison was also Collector of Internal Revenue for the Chicago area during the 1930s and early 1940s.\n\nHarrison's father moved to Chicago in 1855 from Kentucky, shortly after his graduation from Transylvania University (now the University of Kentucky) Law School, and marriage to Sophonisba Preston, Harrison's mother. Upon his arrival in Chicago, Harrison's father invested his money in real estate, and then hung out his shingle as a lawyer and real estate agent. Harrison was born a few years later, on April 23, 1860. In 1873, Harrison's mother was advised to travel to Europe for her health, and Harrison and the rest of the family accompanied her and traveled throughout Germany, Austria, and Switzerland that spring and summer. Harrison's father then returned to Chicago in the fall to tend to his real estate business, but Harrison remained in Germany with his mother and attended school at the Altenberg Gymnasium.\n\nIn 1874, Harrison's father was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, and despite spending much of 1875 in Europe with his family, he was re-elected to Congress in 1876. During this time, Harrison continued his studies at Altenberg, but after his mother died in the fall of 1876 he returned to Chicago.\n\nUpon his return to Chicago, Harrison entered St. Ignatius College (now Loyola University), which was then located near the family's home on Ashland Avenue between Jackson and Van Buren Streets. Harrison graduated from St. Ignatius in 1881, second in a class of two, and then attended Yale University Law School, from which he received a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1883. After law school, Harrison came back to Chicago and practiced law until 1891 when he and his brother, William Preston Harrison, took over the operation of the Chicago Times, which their father had recently purchased.\n\nAfter completing his second term in Congress, Harrison's father was elected mayor of Chicago and served four consecutive two-year terms, from April 1879 to April 1887. He then took a break from politics, including an eighteen month trip around the world, before being once again elected mayor in 1893. Six months after taking office, however, on the final day of the World Columbian Exposition, Harrison's father was assassinated in his home by Patrick Prendergast on October 28, 1893.\n\nIn 1894, Harrison's family sold the Chicago Times, and Harrison focused his energies on his real estate investments until he followed in his father's footsteps and successfully ran for mayor in 1897. Harrison served as mayor from 1897 until 1905, and again from 1911 to 1915. During his first term as mayor Harrison was best known for his bitter, but ultimately victorious, fight against Charles T. Yerkes, the traction railroad baron, who sought a fifty year streetcar concession from the city that Harrison felt was unfair. The traction interests had significant aldermanic support, allegedly obtained through bribery and improper means, and were prepared for Harrison's veto of the proposed ordinance, which they expected to be able to overcome. Harrison, however, went further and took the fight directly to the people, urging them to challenge their aldermen on the issue. Although this move angered some in the Chicago Democratic Party who felt that Harrison had overstepped his bounds, it made Harrison popular with the people, who re-elected him to a second two-year term in 1899.\n\nThe Yerkes battle cemented Harrison's reputation as a man of integrity and one who was not afraid to ruffle a few feathers in order to do what he thought was right. Harrison was re-elected again in 1901 and 1903, but declined to run in 1905, when he was succeeded as mayor by Edward F. Dunne, another Democrat. In 1907, the mayoral term was extended from two years to four and Dunne lost his re-election bid to Republican F. A. Busse. Harrison then re-entered the political scene for the 1911 election, in which he defeated Dunne in the Democratic primary, and Republican Charles E. Merriam, a professor at the University of Chicago, in the general election. During what would prove to be his final term as mayor, Harrison was persuaded that the best way to handle prostitution and gambling was to try to eliminate these practices altogether, instead of treating them as necessary evils and attempting to segregate such vices to particular sections of the city where they could be contained and informally regulated by the police, as Chicago had done for many years. This change in tactics led Harrison to a direct confrontation with long-time allies John J. (\"Bathhouse John\") Coughlin and Michael (\"Hinky-Dink\") Kenna, the aldermen of Chicago's notorious First Ward, which served as the city's main red-light district. Harrison eventually succeeded in shutting down most of Chicago's houses of prostitution and gambling dens, including the infamous Everleigh Club, but these achievements came at a cost. Without Coughlin and Kenna's political support (which, ironically, had been critical years earlier when he stood up against Charles Yerkes), Harrison lost the Democratic nomination to Robert M. Sweitzer in 1915 and moved to the sidelines of Chicago politics, although he remained active in the Democratic Party at the national level throughout the remainder of his life.\n\nWhen America entered World War I, Harrison desperately wanted to participate, but was too old to serve in the military. He lobbied heavily for an appointment to a meaningful position that would allow him to, if not see action, at least be able to \"hear the big guns.\" Eventually, Harrison was made a Captain in the American Red Cross and stationed in Toul, France, a few miles behind the front lines, where he worked to help make life more comfortable for the American troops stationed and recovering at the several field hospitals located there.\n\nFollowing the war, Harrison spent most of the 1920s traveling. He took multiple trips around the world, along with shorter excursions to Europe and Africa. By the early 1930s, however, reversals in the stock market had diminished his personal fortune and Harrison decided to return to work, even though he was now over seventy years old. Relying on his political connections, Harrison was appointed Collector of Internal Revenue for the Northern District of Illinois by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. It was thought that this would be a relatively short-term position, but Harrison ended up holding the post until the end of 1944, when he finally retired from public service for good at the age of 84.\n\nHarrison was a both an outdoorsman and a scholarly patron of the arts. He loved hunting and fishing, and throughout his life went on numerous expeditions into the wilderness in search of big game or the perfect trout stream, including hunting and fishing trips to the Sierra Nevada Mountains, India, Indochina, and Africa. In 1940, when he was eighty years old, Harrison and his long-time friend Oscar Mayer (the Chicago meat-packer), each bagged a 150 pound buck on their annual hunting trip to northern Michigan. Harrison also had somewhat of a reputation as a trencherman, and favored a \"Kentucky Nightcap\" of bourbon before retiring for the day. At the same time, however, Harrison was an avid art collector and regular at the Chicago symphony and opera. Before his death, he donated his substantial art collection to the Art Institute of Chicago, including works by Paul Gauguin, Childe Hassam, Mary Cassatt, Claude Monet, and Toulouse-Lautrec. In recognition of his support, the Art Institute ultimately named Harrison a Benefactor and Governing Life-Member of the museum. According to his daughter, Harrison's \"light-reading\" usually consisted of poetry or the ancient Greek classics, and he read a chapter of the Bible each night throughout his life in fulfillment of a boyhood promise to his mother.\n\nHarrison died on Christmas Day, 1953, at the age of ninety-three. On New Year's Eve of that same year, the Chicago City Council passed a resolution recognizing his accomplishments as mayor, Collector of Internal Revenue, world traveller, and patron of the arts. The resolution stated, in part, that \"from such men as Carter H. Harrison, men of integrity, vision, high civic ideals and unswerving zeal, we shall take example.\" Harrison led a life full of accomplishments and achievements, and appeared to have no regrets. The only disappointment that seemed to stick with him was the failure of his son, Carter H. Harrison V, to have a son that could carry on the family name. Much to Harrison's chagrin, it was his daughter, Edith Harrison Manierre, who bore him two grandsons, while his son gave him four granddaughters."}, {"url": "https://florencekelley.northwestern.edu/legal/mayors/harrisonsr/", "page_content": "Carter Henry Harrison Senior, who served five terms and eight years as Mayor of Chicago until he was assassinated in 1893, came from a family which was, steeped in American history and political involvement dating back to 1635, when the patriarch of the Harrison family was Clerk of the Virginia Council. Carter Henry Harrison\u2019s great grandmother Susannah Randolph was a descendant of Pocahontas. What is remarkable, however, is that in Carter Henry Harrison\u2019s family line one finds a signator of the Declaration of Independence, and two U.S. Presidents. Carter Henry Harrison\u2019s great uncle, Benjamin Harrison not only signed the Declaration of Independence, but also introduced a resolution of independence to congress. One of Benjamin Harrison\u2019s sons, William Henry Harrison went on to become President of the United States in 1841, and President Harrison\u2019s great grandson Benjamin Harrison became President of the United States in 1889.\n\nWhile Carter Henry Harrison Senior\u2019s father\u2019s side was noted for its politicians, his mother\u2019s side was distinguished for its soldiers. Carter Henry Harrison Senior\u2019s mother was Caroline Evalind, whose father, grandfather, and great grandfather were all notable soldiers in their time. Her great grandfather was an officer in the English Army, her grandfather was General William Russell famous for fighting the Indian Wars, and her father Colonel Russell, a cavalry captain, is credited for leading the attack in the Revolutionary War Battle, King\u2019s Mountain.\n\nCarter Henry Harrison Senior was born February 15th, 1825 to Carter Henry Harrison II and Caroline Evalind. Although, Carter Henry Harrison Senior is known as \u201csenior,\u201d he is technically the III in his family to bear the name. He grew up in Elk Hill, Kentucky in a log cabin. His father died, shortly after his birth, and his mother schooled him until he was 15. At this time, he went to Lexington to study under Dr. Lewis Marshall who was the brother of Supreme Court Justice Thomas Marshall. In 1845 he began attending Yale, and after graduating at age 20, studied law at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. After one year of law school, however, he decided to return home to live the life of a farmer on his family\u2019s plantation. In 1851, Harrison traveled Europe for two years where he began to develop an affinity for urban life. When he returned to the states he finished his law degree and graduated in 1853. The same year he married Sophonisba Preston and moved first to St. Louis and then finally to Chicago.\n\nAlthough Harrison intended to open a law office, he became involved in buying and selling real estate. However, a financial storm in 1857 affected him terribly and Harrison spent the next ten years trying to get on his feet financially. During this time, five of his children died in infancy.\n\nIn an attempt to move away from real-estate, Harrison made an unsuccessful attempt at running for the lower house of the State legislature, but it was not until the great Chicago Fire in 1871 that the catalyst for Harrison\u2019s life as politician would emerge. Harrison\u2019s support for the \u201cfire proof ticket,\u201d a ticket composed of both Democratic and Republican nominations for city offices, gained him a nomination and election as County Commissioner. After serving a three-year term as County Commissioner, Harrison decided to run again for congress. He was narrowly elected as the Democratic Representative for 44th National Congress, in March of 1875. Harrison quickly developed a reputation as a skilled orator, and was re-elected for a second term. During his re-election campaign his wife died suddenly of illness and Harrison immersed himself in his work. He served in congress until the end of his second term in 1878, and chose not to seek a third term. Harrison would lament later in life that he never fully enjoyed the life of a congressman. Harrison did not abandon statesmanship all together; in fact, he barely missed a beat. In the spring of 1879, Harrison was elected to be the mayor of Chicago.\n\nHarrison was elected to the office of mayor five times, serving from 1879-1887 and then again in 1893.. The time that Harrison served in office was a time of expansion and development for Chicago. When Harrison arrived in Chicago in 1855 the public revenue for taxation was slightly over $200,000; by the time of his death this number exceeded $15,000,000. Harrison was known, however, as a champion of people\u2019s rights. With railroads being built from one end of Chicago to the other, Harrison continually fought for workers\u2019 rights against the railroad companies that tried to usurp them. Harrison\u2019s commitment to the public is epitomized by his role in the Haymarket Riot. The night of March 4th, 1886 an unknown person threw a bomb at police officers during a workers\u2019 strike organized by local socialist party members. Harrison was quick to speak out against anti-socialist language in the media, not only saying that socialists did not sympathize with the bomb throwers, but also asserting that socialists represented the \u201cworkers, thinkers, and writers\u201d of the United States.\n\nHarrison made an unsuccessful bid for Governor of Illinois in 1884, and was only narrowly re-elected to his 4th term as mayor; he stepped down at the end of that term. Harrison decided he wanted to get back in public life, however, and ran for the mayorship unsuccessfully in 1891. Not to be easily dissuaded, however, he ran again, and was re-elected in 1893 in time to host the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. His term, however, was cut short by assassination. Two days before the World Fair opened, on October 28th, 1893, failed politician Patrick Eugene Prendergast killed Carter Henry Harrison in Harrison\u2019s home. Earlier that day Harrison had announced in a speech \u201cI intend to live for more than half a century! And at the end of that half century London will tremble lest Chicago shall surpass her.\u201d Carter Henry Harrison Senior was the first Chicago Mayor to serve five terms; the next Mayor of Chicago to serve as long a term, was his son Carter Henry Harrison II.\n\nNext: Johnny Powers\n\nSources:\n\nAbbot, Willis John.

Harrison senior was re-elected 1893 for a fifth term, but was assassinated in his home by a failed politician named Patrick Eugene Prendergast on October 28th, 1893. Earlier that day Harrison Senior had announced in a speech \u201cI intend to live for more than half a century! And at the end of that half century London will tremble lest Chicago shall surpass her.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Daley family, (Richard Joseph Daley and Richard Michael Daley) are today noted for their domination of the Chicago political scene, the same can be said for the Harrison family in the late 19th and early 20th century. Both Carter H. Harrison Jr. and senior were elected to five terms in office accounting for 10 of 17 mayoral elections from 1879 until the outbreak of World War I. Carter H. Harrison Jr. greatly respected his father and resembled him in appearance and political policy.\n\nCarter Harrison Jr. was born on April 23, 1860 in Chicago. In 1873 Harrison\u2019s mother, who never took a liking to the Chicago lifestyle, took Harrison Jr. and his brother and sister to Germany. Harrison Jr. stayed in Germany with his brother and sister until his mother\u2019s death in 1876. Upon returning to Chicago, Harrison Jr. enrolled in a Catholic prep school where he received his high school and graduate educations. After graduating, Harrison Jr. chose to attend Yale Law School, the same place his father received his law degree.\n\nAfter Harrison Jr. graduated law school in 1883, he passed his time in Chicago working as a poet, and a journalist under the pseudonym Cecil H. Harcourt. During this time, Harrison developed a great respect for his father, and decided to carry on his legacy and run for the mayor of Chicago. Like his father Harrison appealed to the working class, but his elite upbringing also appealed to the Chicago\u2019s affluent community. He ran on a platform of progressive civic reform which was well received by the City\u2019s population, and in 1897 he was elected the 30th mayor of Chicago.\n\nThe largest controversy Harrison faced in his administration was known as the \u201cTraction Wars,\u201d traction referring to electric streetcar companies. In 1858 the Chicago City Council gave corporate rights to private streetcar companies to carry passengers on Chicago streets for profit. The original contract gave rights for twenty-five years, but in 1865 private companies received a ninety-nine year contract from a corrupt Illinois state legislature. A man named Charles Tyson Yerkes owned most of the streetcars in the city by the time that Harrison Jr. became mayor of Chicago. Yerkes was known to have a number of politicians in his pocket, one of them being state senator named John Humphrey. Humphrey introduced a series of legislation in 1896 which would expand private streetcar rights in Chicago by fifty years. The bills also only mandated minimal compensation from the streetcar companies to the city. Harrison Jr. took an ardent stance against the Humphrey bills and over the next decade fought any franchise expansion. Although Humphrey did very little in leading the fight against the streetcar companies, his visible stance on the issue earned him public approval.\n\nLike his father, Harrison Jr. was an ardent Democrat and believed morality should not be a part of politics. In regards to gambling, prohibition, prostitution and other vices, Harrison adopted a \u201clive and let live\u201d policy. However, the political opposition to vice which surrounded the 1911 mayoral election forced Harrison to use Chicago Police to close several brothels in the city. Ironically, coming down hard on prostitution is what Harrison is most remembered for in Chicago. At the end of his fifth term, Harrison was physically weary from the strain of politics, and after being defeated in the 1915 Democratic primary, he officially retired from politics.\n\nNext: Carter Harrison"}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8704/Carter-Henry-Harrison", "page_content": "There is a problem with your email/password.\n\nWe\u2019ve updated the security on the site.

Harrison was the first cousin twice removed of President William Henry Harrison.\n\nLife and career\n\nBorn near Lexington, Kentucky, to Carter Henry Harrison II and Caroline Russell, he was only a few months old when his father died. He was educated by private tutors and graduated from Yale College in 1845 as a member of Scroll and Key. Following graduation, he traveled and studied in Europe from 1851 to 1853 before entering Transylvania College in Lexington, where he earned a law degree in 1855. Harrison was admitted to the bar in 1855 and commenced practice in Chicago; he came to Chicago because he saw it as a land of opportunity.\n\nHarrison ran an unsuccessful campaign in 1872 for election to the Forty-third U.S. Congress. Beginning in 1874, he served as a member of the board of commissioners of Cook County. He was elected as a Democrat to the Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth Congresses, and was a delegate to the 1880 and 1884 Democratic National Conventions.\n\nHarrison was elected mayor of Chicago for four consecutive two-year terms (in 1879, 1881, 1883, and 1885) and later for a non-consecutive fifth term in 1893. He served as mayor during a period that witnessed many events which brought the city national and international attention. The night of the Haymarket Riot in 1886, which had been sparked by a bomb (reportedly thrown at police by anarchists) that killed seven police officers, Harrison walked unmolested through the crowd of anarchists and advised the police to leave the demonstrators alone. A large reason for this was because while Harrison came from a Protestant background, he appealed to and worked for ethnic white Catholics and labor unions. His administration was considerably more favorable to trade unions and strikes than those of previous Chicago mayors as well as other mayors of the time.\n\nAfter leaving office, Harrison was owner and editor of the Chicago Times from 1891 to 1893, where he continued to advocate for labor unions and the many Catholic and immigrant communities in Chicago. He was re-elected mayor in 1893, in time for the World's Columbian Exposition being held in the city. His desire was to show the world the \"true\" Chicago, and he appointed 1st Ward Alderman \"Bathhouse\" John Coughlin to sit on the reception committee. This appointment was a small part in Harrison's plan to create a centralized Democratic Party machine consisting of empowered Ward Committeemen and precinct captains that would answer to the local Democratic Party. The plan would not be accomplished until Anton Cermak came to power in Chicago politics in the 1920s.\n\nHarrison married Margarette (or Margaret) E. Stearns in 1882, following the death of his first wife in 1876. She was the daughter of Chicago pioneer Marcus C. Stearns.\n\nA Summer's Outing\n\nFrontispiece from A Summer's Outing (1891)\n\nIn 1890, Harrison and his daughter took a vacation trip from Chicago to Yellowstone National Park and Alaska. His letters from the trip were first published in the Chicago Tribune and later compiled into an 1891 book, A Summer's Outing and The Old Man's Story.\n\nAssassination\n\nOn October 28, 1893, a few months into his fifth term and just two days before the close of the World's Columbian Exposition, Harrison was murdered in his home by Patrick Eugene Prendergast, a disgruntled office-seeker who had supported Harrison's re-election under the delusion that Harrison would reward him with an appointment to a post within his mayoral administration. Harrison was buried in Chicago's Graceland Cemetery. A celebration planned for the close of the Exposition was cancelled and replaced by a large public memorial service for Harrison. Prendergast was sentenced to death for the crime and hanged on July 13, 1894.\n\nWhile Harrison died at a time when the elites, Protestants, and Republicans of all kinds greatly disliked him, he never lost his core supporters of labor unions, Catholics, immigrants, and the working class. He was Chicago's first mayor to be elected five times; eventually his son Carter Harrison Jr. was also elected mayor five times.\n\nHarrison's career and assassination are closely connected with the World's Columbian Exposition, and are discussed at some length as a subplot to the two main stories (about the fair and serial killer H. H. Holmes) in Erik Larson's best-selling 2003 non-fiction book The Devil in the White City."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Capt-Carter-Harrison-Sr/325453529870007126", "page_content": "About Capt.

Carter Henry Harrison\u2019s great grandmother Susannah Randolph was a descendant of Pocahontas. What is remarkable, however, is that in Carter Henry Harrison\u2019s family line one finds a signator of the Declaration of Independence, and two U.S. Presidents. Carter Henry Harrison\u2019s great uncle, Benjamin Harrison not only signed the Declaration of Independence, but also introduced a resolution of independence to congress. One of Benjamin Harrison\u2019s sons, William Henry Harrison went on to become President of the United States in 1841, and President Harrison\u2019s great grandson Benjamin Harrison became President of the United States in 1889.\n\nWhile Carter Henry Harrison Senior\u2019s father\u2019s side was noted for its politicians, his mother\u2019s side was distinguished for its soldiers. Carter Henry Harrison Senior\u2019s mother was Caroline Evalind, whose father, grandfather, and great grandfather were all notable soldiers in their time. Her great grandfather was an officer in the English Army, her grandfather was General William Russell famous for fighting the Indian Wars, and her father Colonel Russell, a cavalry captain, is credited for leading the attack in the Revolutionary War Battle, King\u2019s Mountain.\n\nCarter Henry Harrison Senior was born February 15th, 1825 to Carter Henry Harrison II and Caroline Evalind. Although, Carter Henry Harrison Senior is known as \u201csenior,\u201d he is technically the III in his family to bear the name. He grew up in Elk Hill, Kentucky in a log cabin. His father died, shortly after his birth, and his mother schooled him until he was 15. At this time, he went to Lexington to study under Dr. Lewis Marshall who was the brother of Supreme Court Justice Thomas Marshall. In 1845 he began attending Yale, and after graduating at age 20, studied law at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. After one year of law school, however, he decided to return home to live the life of a farmer on his family\u2019s plantation. In 1851, Harrison traveled Europe for two years where he began to develop an affinity for urban life. When he returned to the states he finished his law degree and graduated in 1853. The same year he married Sophonisba Preston and moved first to St. Louis and then finally to Chicago.\n\nAlthough Harrison intended to open a law office, he became involved in buying and selling real estate. However, a financial storm in 1857 affected him terribly and Harrison spent the next ten years trying to get on his feet financially. During this time, five of his children died in infancy.\n\nIn an attempt to move away from real-estate, Harrison made an unsuccessful attempt at running for the lower house of the State legislature, but it was not until the great Chicago Fire in 1871 that the catalyst for Harrison\u2019s life as politician would emerge. Harrison\u2019s support for the \u201cfire proof ticket,\u201d a ticket composed of both Democratic and Republican nominations for city offices, gained him a nomination and election as County Commissioner. After serving a three-year term as County Commissioner, Harrison decided to run again for congress. He was narrowly elected as the Democratic Representative for 44th National Congress, in March of 1875. Harrison quickly developed a reputation as a skilled orator, and was re-elected for a second term. During his re-election campaign his wife died suddenly of illness and Harrison immersed himself in his work. He served in congress until the end of his second term in 1878, and chose not to seek a third term. Harrison would lament later in life that he never fully enjoyed the life of a congressman. Harrison did not abandon statesmanship all together; in fact, he barely missed a beat. In the spring of 1879, Harrison was elected to be the mayor of Chicago.\n\nHarrison was elected to the office of mayor five times, serving from 1879-1887 and then again in 1893.. The time that Harrison served in office was a time of expansion and development for Chicago. When Harrison arrived in Chicago in 1855 the public revenue for taxation was slightly over $200,000; by the time of his death this number exceeded $15,000,000. Harrison was known, however, as a champion of people\u2019s rights. With railroads being built from one end of Chicago to the other, Harrison continually fought for workers\u2019 rights against the railroad companies that tried to usurp them. Harrison\u2019s commitment to the public is epitomized by his role in the Haymarket Riot. The night of March 4th, 1886 an unknown person threw a bomb at police officers during a workers\u2019 strike organized by local socialist party members. Harrison was quick to speak out against anti-socialist language in the media, not only saying that socialists did not sympathize with the bomb throwers, but also asserting that socialists represented the \u201cworkers, thinkers, and writers\u201d of the United States.\n\nHarrison made an unsuccessful bid for Governor of Illinois in 1884, and was only narrowly re-elected to his 4th term as mayor; he stepped down at the end of that term. Harrison decided he wanted to get back in public life, however, and ran for the mayorship unsuccessfully in 1891. Not to be easily dissuaded, however, he ran again, and was re-elected in 1893 in time to host the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. His term, however, was cut short by assassination. Two days before the World Fair opened, on October 28th, 1893, failed politician Patrick Eugene Prendergast killed Carter Henry Harrison in Harrison\u2019s home. Earlier that day Harrison had announced in a speech \u201cI intend to live for more than half a century! And at the end of that half century London will tremble lest Chicago shall surpass her.\u201d Carter Henry Harrison Senior was the first Chicago Mayor to serve five terms; the next Mayor of Chicago to serve as long a term, was his son Carter Henry Harrison II.\n\nNext: Johnny Powers\n\nSources:\n\nAbbot, Willis John.

Harrison senior was re-elected 1893 for a fifth term, but was assassinated in his home by a failed politician named Patrick Eugene Prendergast on October 28th, 1893. Earlier that day Harrison Senior had announced in a speech \u201cI intend to live for more than half a century! And at the end of that half century London will tremble lest Chicago shall surpass her.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Daley family, (Richard Joseph Daley and Richard Michael Daley) are today noted for their domination of the Chicago political scene, the same can be said for the Harrison family in the late 19th and early 20th century. Both Carter H. Harrison Jr. and senior were elected to five terms in office accounting for 10 of 17 mayoral elections from 1879 until the outbreak of World War I. Carter H. Harrison Jr. greatly respected his father and resembled him in appearance and political policy.\n\nCarter Harrison Jr. was born on April 23, 1860 in Chicago. In 1873 Harrison\u2019s mother, who never took a liking to the Chicago lifestyle, took Harrison Jr. and his brother and sister to Germany. Harrison Jr. stayed in Germany with his brother and sister until his mother\u2019s death in 1876. Upon returning to Chicago, Harrison Jr. enrolled in a Catholic prep school where he received his high school and graduate educations. After graduating, Harrison Jr. chose to attend Yale Law School, the same place his father received his law degree.\n\nAfter Harrison Jr. graduated law school in 1883, he passed his time in Chicago working as a poet, and a journalist under the pseudonym Cecil H. Harcourt. During this time, Harrison developed a great respect for his father, and decided to carry on his legacy and run for the mayor of Chicago. Like his father Harrison appealed to the working class, but his elite upbringing also appealed to the Chicago\u2019s affluent community. He ran on a platform of progressive civic reform which was well received by the City\u2019s population, and in 1897 he was elected the 30th mayor of Chicago.\n\nThe largest controversy Harrison faced in his administration was known as the \u201cTraction Wars,\u201d traction referring to electric streetcar companies. In 1858 the Chicago City Council gave corporate rights to private streetcar companies to carry passengers on Chicago streets for profit. The original contract gave rights for twenty-five years, but in 1865 private companies received a ninety-nine year contract from a corrupt Illinois state legislature. A man named Charles Tyson Yerkes owned most of the streetcars in the city by the time that Harrison Jr. became mayor of Chicago. Yerkes was known to have a number of politicians in his pocket, one of them being state senator named John Humphrey. Humphrey introduced a series of legislation in 1896 which would expand private streetcar rights in Chicago by fifty years. The bills also only mandated minimal compensation from the streetcar companies to the city. Harrison Jr. took an ardent stance against the Humphrey bills and over the next decade fought any franchise expansion. Although Humphrey did very little in leading the fight against the streetcar companies, his visible stance on the issue earned him public approval.\n\nLike his father, Harrison Jr. was an ardent Democrat and believed morality should not be a part of politics. In regards to gambling, prohibition, prostitution and other vices, Harrison adopted a \u201clive and let live\u201d policy. However, the political opposition to vice which surrounded the 1911 mayoral election forced Harrison to use Chicago Police to close several brothels in the city. Ironically, coming down hard on prostitution is what Harrison is most remembered for in Chicago. At the end of his fifth term, Harrison was physically weary from the strain of politics, and after being defeated in the 1915 Democratic primary, he officially retired from politics.\n\nNext: Carter Harrison"}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Carter-H-Harrison-IV/6000000003859261957", "page_content": "About Carter H. Harrison IV\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Harrison,_Jr.\n\nCarter Henry Harrison, Jr. (April 23, 1860, Chicago, Illinois - December 25, 1953; buried in Graceland Cemetery) served as Mayor of Chicago (1897\u20131905 and 1911\u20131915). The City's 30th mayor, he was the first actually born in Chicago.\n\nLike his father, Carter Harrison, Sr., Carter Harrison, Jr. gained election to five terms as Chicago's mayor. Educated in Saxe-Altenburg, Germany, Harrison returned to Chicago to help his brother run the Chicago Times, which their father bought in 1891. Under the Harrisons the paper became a resolute supporter of the Democratic Party, and was the only local newspaper to support the Pullman strikers in the mid-1890s.\n\nAs with his father, Harrison did not believe in trying to legislate morality. As mayor, Harrison believed that Chicagoans' two major desires were to make money and to spend it. During his administrations, Chicago's vice districts blossomed, and special maps were printed to enable tourists to find their way from brothel to brothel. The name of one Chicago saloon-keeper of the time supposedly entered the English language as a term for a strong or laced drink intended to render unconsciousness: Mickey Finn.\n\nHowever, Harrison was seen as more of a reformer than his father, which helped him garner the middle class votes his father had lacked. One of Harrison's biggest enemies was Charles Yerkes, whose plans to monopolize Chicago's streetcar lines were vigorously attacked by the mayor. During his final term in office, Harrison established the Chicago Vice Commission and worked to close down the Levee district, starting with the Everleigh Club brothel on October 24, 1911.\n\nHarrison was a hopeful for the 1904 Democratic nomination for President, but was unable to negotiate his way through a tangle of conflicting loyalies to different Party bosses; the nomination went to Alton B. Parker, who was soundly defeated by Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nIn 1915, when Harrison left office, Chicago had essentially reached its modern size in land area, and had a population of 2,400,000; the city was moving inexorably into its status as a major modern metropolis. He and his father had collectively been mayor of the city for 21 of the previous 36 years.\n\nHarrison wrote his autobiography, not once but twice; his wife, Edith Ogden Harrison, was a well-known writer of children's books and fairy tales in the first two decades of the twentieth century.\n\nAncestry\n\nHarrison was a descendant of Robert Carter I, Benjamin Harrison IV, William Randolph, and Isham Randolph of Dungeness."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8704/Carter-Henry-Harrison", "page_content": "There is a problem with your email/password.\n\nWe\u2019ve updated the security on the site.

He came here as a young man from his native Kentucky full of hope and vigor, and it was here that he rose to prominence by winning the city`s highest office, not once but five separate times. It was also here, on an October night in 1893, that he died, at age 68, the victim of an assassin`s bullets.\n\nHarrison was very much a man of his time. As with his adopted city, he was genial, robust and tolerant, a larger-than-life figure who embodied the best and the worst that the burgeoning metropolis had to offer. He was also the most contrary of men. Of aristocratic stock (President Henry Harrison was a relative), he was born in a humble log cabin but later, as mayor, lived in an elegant mansion in the most elite part of town. An honest man, his laissez- faire attitude as mayor helped create, in the words of one critic, ''the Gomorrah of the West.'' A popular politician, he was despised by reformers and the press alike. A worldly sophisticate, he also appealed to the common man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarrison was first elected mayor in 1879, then re-elected in 1881, 1883 and 1885 (mayoral terms then were for two years). He ran again, as an independent Democrat, in 1891 but lost to Republican Hempstead Washburne. Washburne served only one term. As the city prepared for the 1893 World`s Columbian Exposition, held in honor of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus, the citizens began looking for someone to symbolize their verve, celebrate their entrepreneurial success and exude the spirit of the New World. The Republican candidate, Samuel W. Allerton, was perfectly respectable but lacked the necessary spunk. Aware of the worldwide attention the city was about to get, Chicagoans for the fifth time chose the dapper Harrison as their leader.\n\nOn Oct. 28, 1893, Harrison addressed a gathering of big-city mayors who had come to the fair from around the country. Proclaiming a new future he claimed to see on the horizon, he ironically said, ''I intend to live for more than a half-century, and at the end of that half-century London will be trembling lest Chicago shall surpass her.''\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe returned home that evening to his mansion at Ashland Avenue and Jackson Boulevard to enjoy a leisurely dinner with his youngest son, William Preston. Another son, Carter Henry Jr., was still at the fair. After a brief nap, Harrison received a visitor who had gained entry simply by telling a servant that he wished to have a word with the mayor. This was not unusual;\n\nthe mayor`s door was always open to all citizens. The visitor was Patrick Eugene Prendergast, a 25-year-old newspaper carrier who had illusions of becoming the city`s corporation counsel even though he was not a lawyer and his only legal ''training'' consisted of reading a popular legal tome, ''Every Man His Own Lawyer.'' Approaching the mayor and without saying a word, Prendergast pulled a six-shooter from his overcoat pocket and fired three shots at the mayor.\n\nHearing the shots, the family coachman raced into the room and saw Prendergast fire a final round at the mayor. The coachman then ran out to get his own revolver, but by the time he returned, Prendergast had vanished. William Harrison came in next and found his father lying across the doorway of a pantry passageway, moaning and bleeding profusely. W.S. Chalmers, president of the Allis-Chalmers steel company, who had rushed over from across the street upon hearing the shots and the ensuing commotion, helped William carry the mayor to a sofa. ''Chalmers,'' reportedly said the dying Harrison, ''this is death. I am shot over the heart.''\n\nMeanwhile, the assassin ran for several blocks, caught a streetcar, got off it and walked to the Desplaines Street police station, where he calmly told the desk sergeant that he had killed the mayor. Later, in a formal statement, Prendergast justified his action by saying: ''He deserved to be shot. He did not keep his promise to me.''\n\nThe assassination cast a pall over the city. ''Our Carter,'' the man who had been leader to a generation of Chicagoans, was gone. Mourners lined up outside the Harrison mansion into the night, talking, crying, trying to make sense out of a senseless act. At the world`s fair, the closing festivities were canceled, putting a mournful end to what had begun as a joyful celebration.\n\nPrendergast was convicted of murder and sentenced to die by hanging. ''I had no malice against anyone,'' he said as the noose was placed around his neck. The Harrison legacy, however, did not end with the mayor`s death. Mirroring his father`s political career, Carter Henry Harrison Jr. also served five terms as Chicago`s chief executive, establishing a family record unmatched in Chicago`s political history."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/44735502/carter-henry-harrison", "page_content": "He was married on 9 Nov. 1760 in St. James Parish, Goochland County, Va\n\n\n\nCHILDREN 2 living children;\n\nBASED ON\n\n, DOCUMENTED REFERENCES:\n\nCARTER, ROBERT RANDOLPH THE CARTER TREE (available from Etsy)\n\nNAGEL, PAUL C THE LEES OF VIRGINIA\n\nDANIELS, JONATHAN THE RANDOLPHS OF VIRGINIA\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n--WILLIAM A HARRISON m1 Miss\u2014\u2014\u2014-Coupland m2 MARTHA COCKE\n\n--BEN CARTER HARRISON m ELIZA C HARRISON (cousins)\n\nError OMIT CALVERT, HOBBS , CORMAN NOT\n\nBASED ON DOCUMENTED MATERIAL\n\n\n\n===\n\nHe was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and was the author of the \"Resolutions of Independence\"\n\nHe was a member of the Virginia Legislature from 1782 - 1787.\n\nHe was an uncle of Thomas Jefferson.\n\n===\n\nHis home, \"Clifton\", was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.\n\nCarter had at least 6 children. ) I found only 2 I could document \u2014please send your 6)\n\nTwo of his sons, Carter Henry Harrison III and Carter Henry Harrison IV were mayors of Chicago, Illinois.

The land, however, \"lapsed,\" and was later granted to Thomas Randolph in 1722. This area was later included in a tract made up of 2870 acres (11.6 km\u00b2), which later came to be known as \"Clifton.\" But it was this initial purchase of the 670 acres (2.7 km\u00b2) that would form \"The Fork,\" known for its position on the James and Willis Rivers. It would later become Ampthill. In 1724, Randolph sold to Robert \"King\" Carter, then the wealthiest landowner in Virginia.\n\nIn his Will dated 22 August 1726, King Carter willed the 2870 acre (11.6 km\u00b2) tract to his then unborn grandson, with the stipulation that the child carry the Carter name. Some time later, Anne Carter and Major Benjamin Harrison of Berkley Plantation, christened a son, Carter Henry, who later become the owner of the property known as \"Clifton,\" in Cumberland County, Virginia.\n\nCarter Henry Harrison moved to Clifton upon graduation from law school. There he raised his family and wrote the Cumberland Resolutions, which were presented to the community from the steps of the Effingham Tavern. These resolutions were later incorporated into the Virginia Resolutions, which were the basis for the Declaration of Independence, written by Harrison's nephew, Thomas Jefferson.\n\n===\n\nCarter Henry Harrison died in 1793.\n\nIn his Will, Carter Henry willed \"Clifton\" to his son, Randolph, and \"The Fork\" to his son Robert.\n\nRobert sold The Fork to Shadrack Vaughan in 1804. Randolph later repurchased the property in 1815. The Fork was a clapboard structure of no more than three bedrooms.\n\nIn 1815, the decision was made to add an addition to the existing manor.

The land, however, \"lapsed,\" and was later granted to Thomas Randolph in 1722. This area was later included in a tract made up of 2870 acres (11.6 km\u00b2), which later came to be known as \"Clifton.\" But it was this initial purchase of the 670 acres (2.7 km\u00b2) that would form \"The Fork,\" known for its position on the James and Willis Rivers. It would later become Ampthill. In 1724, Randolph sold to Robert \"King\" Carter, then the wealthiest landowner in Virginia.\n\nIn his Will dated 22 August 1726, King Carter willed the 2870 acre (11.6 km\u00b2) tract to his then unborn grandson, with the stipulation that the child carry the Carter name. Some time later, Anne Carter and Major Benjamin Harrison of Berkley Plantation, christened a son, Carter Henry, who later become the owner of the property known as \"Clifton,\" in Cumberland County, Virginia.\n\nCarter Henry Harrison moved to Clifton upon graduation from law school. There he raised his family and wrote the Cumberland Resolutions, which were presented to the community from the steps of the Effingham Tavern. These resolutions were later incorporated into the Virginia Resolutions, which were the basis for the Declaration of Independence, written by Harrison's nephew, Thomas Jefferson.\n\n===\n\nCarter Henry Harrison died in 1793.\n\nIn his Will, Carter Henry willed \"Clifton\" to his son, Randolph, and \"The Fork\" to his son Robert.\n\nRobert sold The Fork to Shadrack Vaughan in 1804. Randolph later repurchased the property in 1815. The Fork was a clapboard structure of no more than three bedrooms.\n\nIn 1815, the decision was made to add an addition to the existing manor. Randolph called upon his cousin, Thomas Jefferson, to design the brick addition that exists today. These plans exist today on file with the University of Virginia.

He served as mayor during a period that witnessed many events which brought the city national and international attention. The night of the Haymarket Riot in 1886, which had been sparked by a bomb (reportedly thrown at police by anarchists) that killed seven police officers, Harrison walked unmolested through the crowd of anarchists and advised the police to leave the demonstrators alone. A large reason for this was because while Harrison came from a Protestant background, he appealed to and worked for ethnic white Catholics and labor unions. His administration was considerably more favorable to trade unions and strikes than those of previous Chicago mayors as well as other mayors of the time.\n\nAfter leaving office, Harrison was owner and editor of the Chicago Times from 1891 to 1893, where he continued to advocate for labor unions and the many Catholic and immigrant communities in Chicago. He was re-elected mayor in 1893, in time for the World's Columbian Exposition being held in the city. His desire was to show the world the \"true\" Chicago, and he appointed 1st Ward Alderman \"Bathhouse\" John Coughlin to sit on the reception committee. This appointment was a small part in Harrison's plan to create a centralized Democratic Party machine consisting of empowered Ward Committeemen and precinct captains that would answer to the local Democratic Party. The plan would not be accomplished until Anton Cermak came to power in Chicago politics in the 1920s.\n\nHarrison married Margarette (or Margaret) E.

View full image\n\nJust over 125 years ago, on October 30, 1893, the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition was scheduled to end with closing ceremonies after a six-month run in Chicago. Created to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Columbus\u2019s arrival in the New World, the fair was a showcase of American promise and achievement. And presiding over it was the city\u2019s popular mayor, Yale alumnus Carter Harrison Sr. \u201945. But the fair ended early when the mayor was assassinated on October 28.\n\nHarrison, who was related to US presidents William Henry Harrison and Benjamin Harrison, was descended from early Virginia planters. According to the memoir of Carter Harrison Jr. \u201983LLB, who would match his father\u2019s record of five terms as mayor of Chicago, Harrison Sr.\u2019s years in New Haven changed him. \u201cFour years at Yale in a New England anti-slavery environment had confirmed his latent dislike for slavery,\u201d Harrison Jr. wrote. After two years of study and travel abroad, Harrison Sr. sold the 600-acre family plantation in Kentucky. Although he once wrote a relative that \u201cto sell a man is to me one of the most disagreeable things I could possibly do,\u201d Harrison also sold the enslaved people living there.\n\nIn 1855, after completing his law studies at Transylvania University and a honeymoon trip to Chicago, he and his bride \u201cknew where they wanted to live,\u201d in his son\u2019s words. \u201cThey had fallen in love with the lusty lake city.\u201d Harrison mainly devoted himself to Chicago real estate, but from 1874 to 1878 he served in Congress as a Democrat. During that period, in 1876, his wife died; they\u2019d had ten children, though six died early. He was elected mayor in 1879 and served until 1887\u2014the year his second wife died. During the year of the fair, Harrison was elected mayor for a fifth term.\n\nHarrison was known as a \u201ccommon man\u2019s mayor\u201d whose \u201cdoor was always open.\u201d He loved riding his white horse through Chicago neighborhoods, waving and stopping to shake hands. He was very proud of the fair, especially of its gleaming \u201cWhite City,\u201d which introduced neoclassical Beaux Arts architecture to America. (The fa\u00e7ades were painted white, and daylight was reproduced at night by brilliant electric illumination.) The fair also celebrated pioneering efforts to develop the telephone, photography, motion pictures, and the automobile.\n\nOn October 28, a young man called at Harrison\u2019s home. The maid showed him in, and the mayor, just up from an after-dinner nap, greeted his visitor in the hall. The stranger pulled out a gun and fired three times, mortally wounding Harrison.\n\nThe assassin, Patrick Eugene Prendergast, turned himself in at a nearby police station. In The Devil in the White City (2003), Erik Larson writes that Prendergast said he killed Harrison \u201cbecause he betrayed my confidence. I supported him through his campaign and he promised to appoint me corporation counsel. He didn\u2019t live up to his word.\u201d Prosecutors maintained that Prendergast was delusional but not insane. The jury agreed, and the verdict was \u201cguilty.\u201d A last appeal by Clarence Darrow for an inquest to commute the death sentence on grounds of insanity failed. Prendergast was hanged on July 13, 1894.\n\nOn October 29, the celebratory close of the Exposition was canceled for a public memorial service. Harrison\u2019s funeral procession filled the city for an entire day. On the day of his death, Harrison had delivered his last public remarks\u2014at the fair\u2019s \u201cAmerican Cities Day,\u201d said to be the largest-ever gathering of American mayors. This final speech showed his pride in his adopted city: \u201cWhen the fire swept over our city and laid it in ashes in 24 hours, then the world said: \u2018Chicago and its boasting is now gone forever.\u2019 But Chicago said: \u2018We will rebuild the city better than ever\u2019 and Chicago has done it. . . .

Harrison II was the 30th mayor of Chicago, in office from 1897-1905 and then again from 1911-1915. His father, Carter H. Harrison, also served as mayor of Chicago from 1879-1887. Harrison senior was re-elected 1893 for a fifth term, but was assassinated in his home by a failed politician named Patrick Eugene Prendergast on October 28th, 1893. Earlier that day Harrison Senior had announced in a speech \u201cI intend to live for more than half a century! And at the end of that half century London will tremble lest Chicago shall surpass her.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Daley family, (Richard Joseph Daley and Richard Michael Daley) are today noted for their domination of the Chicago political scene, the same can be said for the Harrison family in the late 19th and early 20th century. Both Carter H. Harrison Jr. and senior were elected to five terms in office accounting for 10 of 17 mayoral elections from 1879 until the outbreak of World War I. Carter H. Harrison Jr. greatly respected his father and resembled him in appearance and political policy.\n\nCarter Harrison Jr. was born on April 23, 1860 in Chicago. In 1873 Harrison\u2019s mother, who never took a liking to the Chicago lifestyle, took Harrison Jr. and his brother and sister to Germany. Harrison Jr. stayed in Germany with his brother and sister until his mother\u2019s death in 1876. Upon returning to Chicago, Harrison Jr. enrolled in a Catholic prep school where he received his high school and graduate educations. After graduating, Harrison Jr. chose to attend Yale Law School, the same place his father received his law degree.\n\nAfter Harrison Jr. graduated law school in 1883, he passed his time in Chicago working as a poet, and a journalist under the pseudonym Cecil H. Harcourt. During this time, Harrison developed a great respect for his father, and decided to carry on his legacy and run for the mayor of Chicago. Like his father Harrison appealed to the working class, but his elite upbringing also appealed to the Chicago\u2019s affluent community. He ran on a platform of progressive civic reform which was well received by the City\u2019s population, and in 1897 he was elected the 30th mayor of Chicago.\n\nThe largest controversy Harrison faced in his administration was known as the \u201cTraction Wars,\u201d traction referring to electric streetcar companies. In 1858 the Chicago City Council gave corporate rights to private streetcar companies to carry passengers on Chicago streets for profit. The original contract gave rights for twenty-five years, but in 1865 private companies received a ninety-nine year contract from a corrupt Illinois state legislature. A man named Charles Tyson Yerkes owned most of the streetcars in the city by the time that Harrison Jr. became mayor of Chicago. Yerkes was known to have a number of politicians in his pocket, one of them being state senator named John Humphrey. Humphrey introduced a series of legislation in 1896 which would expand private streetcar rights in Chicago by fifty years. The bills also only mandated minimal compensation from the streetcar companies to the city. Harrison Jr. took an ardent stance against the Humphrey bills and over the next decade fought any franchise expansion. Although Humphrey did very little in leading the fight against the streetcar companies, his visible stance on the issue earned him public approval.\n\nLike his father, Harrison Jr. was an ardent Democrat and believed morality should not be a part of politics. In regards to gambling, prohibition, prostitution and other vices, Harrison adopted a \u201clive and let live\u201d policy. However, the political opposition to vice which surrounded the 1911 mayoral election forced Harrison to use Chicago Police to close several brothels in the city. Ironically, coming down hard on prostitution is what Harrison is most remembered for in Chicago. At the end of his fifth term, Harrison was physically weary from the strain of politics, and after being defeated in the 1915 Democratic primary, he officially retired from politics.\n\nNext: Carter Harrison"}, {"url": "https://florencekelley.northwestern.edu/legal/mayors/harrisonsr/", "page_content": "Carter Henry Harrison Senior, who served five terms and eight years as Mayor of Chicago until he was assassinated in 1893, came from a family which was, steeped in American history and political involvement dating back to 1635, when the patriarch of the Harrison family was Clerk of the Virginia Council. Carter Henry Harrison\u2019s great grandmother Susannah Randolph was a descendant of Pocahontas. What is remarkable, however, is that in Carter Henry Harrison\u2019s family line one finds a signator of the Declaration of Independence, and two U.S. Presidents. Carter Henry Harrison\u2019s great uncle, Benjamin Harrison not only signed the Declaration of Independence, but also introduced a resolution of independence to congress. One of Benjamin Harrison\u2019s sons, William Henry Harrison went on to become President of the United States in 1841, and President Harrison\u2019s great grandson Benjamin Harrison became President of the United States in 1889.\n\nWhile Carter Henry Harrison Senior\u2019s father\u2019s side was noted for its politicians, his mother\u2019s side was distinguished for its soldiers. Carter Henry Harrison Senior\u2019s mother was Caroline Evalind, whose father, grandfather, and great grandfather were all notable soldiers in their time. Her great grandfather was an officer in the English Army, her grandfather was General William Russell famous for fighting the Indian Wars, and her father Colonel Russell, a cavalry captain, is credited for leading the attack in the Revolutionary War Battle, King\u2019s Mountain.\n\nCarter Henry Harrison Senior was born February 15th, 1825 to Carter Henry Harrison II and Caroline Evalind. Although, Carter Henry Harrison Senior is known as \u201csenior,\u201d he is technically the III in his family to bear the name. He grew up in Elk Hill, Kentucky in a log cabin. His father died, shortly after his birth, and his mother schooled him until he was 15. At this time, he went to Lexington to study under Dr. Lewis Marshall who was the brother of Supreme Court Justice Thomas Marshall. In 1845 he began attending Yale, and after graduating at age 20, studied law at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. After one year of law school, however, he decided to return home to live the life of a farmer on his family\u2019s plantation. In 1851, Harrison traveled Europe for two years where he began to develop an affinity for urban life. When he returned to the states he finished his law degree and graduated in 1853. The same year he married Sophonisba Preston and moved first to St. Louis and then finally to Chicago.\n\nAlthough Harrison intended to open a law office, he became involved in buying and selling real estate. However, a financial storm in 1857 affected him terribly and Harrison spent the next ten years trying to get on his feet financially. During this time, five of his children died in infancy.\n\nIn an attempt to move away from real-estate, Harrison made an unsuccessful attempt at running for the lower house of the State legislature, but it was not until the great Chicago Fire in 1871 that the catalyst for Harrison\u2019s life as politician would emerge. Harrison\u2019s support for the \u201cfire proof ticket,\u201d a ticket composed of both Democratic and Republican nominations for city offices, gained him a nomination and election as County Commissioner. After serving a three-year term as County Commissioner, Harrison decided to run again for congress. He was narrowly elected as the Democratic Representative for 44th National Congress, in March of 1875. Harrison quickly developed a reputation as a skilled orator, and was re-elected for a second term. During his re-election campaign his wife died suddenly of illness and Harrison immersed himself in his work. He served in congress until the end of his second term in 1878, and chose not to seek a third term. Harrison would lament later in life that he never fully enjoyed the life of a congressman. Harrison did not abandon statesmanship all together; in fact, he barely missed a beat. In the spring of 1879, Harrison was elected to be the mayor of Chicago.\n\nHarrison was elected to the office of mayor five times, serving from 1879-1887 and then again in 1893.. The time that Harrison served in office was a time of expansion and development for Chicago. When Harrison arrived in Chicago in 1855 the public revenue for taxation was slightly over $200,000; by the time of his death this number exceeded $15,000,000. Harrison was known, however, as a champion of people\u2019s rights. With railroads being built from one end of Chicago to the other, Harrison continually fought for workers\u2019 rights against the railroad companies that tried to usurp them. Harrison\u2019s commitment to the public is epitomized by his role in the Haymarket Riot. The night of March 4th, 1886 an unknown person threw a bomb at police officers during a workers\u2019 strike organized by local socialist party members. Harrison was quick to speak out against anti-socialist language in the media, not only saying that socialists did not sympathize with the bomb throwers, but also asserting that socialists represented the \u201cworkers, thinkers, and writers\u201d of the United States.\n\nHarrison made an unsuccessful bid for Governor of Illinois in 1884, and was only narrowly re-elected to his 4th term as mayor; he stepped down at the end of that term. Harrison decided he wanted to get back in public life, however, and ran for the mayorship unsuccessfully in 1891. Not to be easily dissuaded, however, he ran again, and was re-elected in 1893 in time to host the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. His term, however, was cut short by assassination. Two days before the World Fair opened, on October 28th, 1893, failed politician Patrick Eugene Prendergast killed Carter Henry Harrison in Harrison\u2019s home.

Harrison IV\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Harrison,_Jr.\n\nCarter Henry Harrison, Jr. (April 23, 1860, Chicago, Illinois - December 25, 1953; buried in Graceland Cemetery) served as Mayor of Chicago (1897\u20131905 and 1911\u20131915). The City's 30th mayor, he was the first actually born in Chicago.\n\nLike his father, Carter Harrison, Sr., Carter Harrison, Jr. gained election to five terms as Chicago's mayor. Educated in Saxe-Altenburg, Germany, Harrison returned to Chicago to help his brother run the Chicago Times, which their father bought in 1891. Under the Harrisons the paper became a resolute supporter of the Democratic Party, and was the only local newspaper to support the Pullman strikers in the mid-1890s.\n\nAs with his father, Harrison did not believe in trying to legislate morality. As mayor, Harrison believed that Chicagoans' two major desires were to make money and to spend it. During his administrations, Chicago's vice districts blossomed, and special maps were printed to enable tourists to find their way from brothel to brothel. The name of one Chicago saloon-keeper of the time supposedly entered the English language as a term for a strong or laced drink intended to render unconsciousness: Mickey Finn.\n\nHowever, Harrison was seen as more of a reformer than his father, which helped him garner the middle class votes his father had lacked. One of Harrison's biggest enemies was Charles Yerkes, whose plans to monopolize Chicago's streetcar lines were vigorously attacked by the mayor. During his final term in office, Harrison established the Chicago Vice Commission and worked to close down the Levee district, starting with the Everleigh Club brothel on October 24, 1911.\n\nHarrison was a hopeful for the 1904 Democratic nomination for President, but was unable to negotiate his way through a tangle of conflicting loyalies to different Party bosses; the nomination went to Alton B. Parker, who was soundly defeated by Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nIn 1915, when Harrison left office, Chicago had essentially reached its modern size in land area, and had a population of 2,400,000; the city was moving inexorably into its status as a major modern metropolis. He and his father had collectively been mayor of the city for 21 of the previous 36 years.\n\nHarrison wrote his autobiography, not once but twice; his wife, Edith Ogden Harrison, was a well-known writer of children's books and fairy tales in the first two decades of the twentieth century.\n\nAncestry\n\nHarrison was a descendant of Robert Carter I, Benjamin Harrison IV, William Randolph, and Isham Randolph of Dungeness."}, {"url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-10-09-8802060487-story.html", "page_content": "Carter Henry Harrison Sr. and the city he liked to call ''my bride'' were made for each other. He came here as a young man from his native Kentucky full of hope and vigor, and it was here that he rose to prominence by winning the city`s highest office, not once but five separate times. It was also here, on an October night in 1893, that he died, at age 68, the victim of an assassin`s bullets.\n\nHarrison was very much a man of his time. As with his adopted city, he was genial, robust and tolerant, a larger-than-life figure who embodied the best and the worst that the burgeoning metropolis had to offer. He was also the most contrary of men. Of aristocratic stock (President Henry Harrison was a relative), he was born in a humble log cabin but later, as mayor, lived in an elegant mansion in the most elite part of town. An honest man, his laissez- faire attitude as mayor helped create, in the words of one critic, ''the Gomorrah of the West.'' A popular politician, he was despised by reformers and the press alike. A worldly sophisticate, he also appealed to the common man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarrison was first elected mayor in 1879, then re-elected in 1881, 1883 and 1885 (mayoral terms then were for two years). He ran again, as an independent Democrat, in 1891 but lost to Republican Hempstead Washburne. Washburne served only one term. As the city prepared for the 1893 World`s Columbian Exposition, held in honor of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus, the citizens began looking for someone to symbolize their verve, celebrate their entrepreneurial success and exude the spirit of the New World. The Republican candidate, Samuel W. Allerton, was perfectly respectable but lacked the necessary spunk. Aware of the worldwide attention the city was about to get, Chicagoans for the fifth time chose the dapper Harrison as their leader.\n\nOn Oct. 28, 1893, Harrison addressed a gathering of big-city mayors who had come to the fair from around the country. Proclaiming a new future he claimed to see on the horizon, he ironically said, ''I intend to live for more than a half-century, and at the end of that half-century London will be trembling lest Chicago shall surpass her.''\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe returned home that evening to his mansion at Ashland Avenue and Jackson Boulevard to enjoy a leisurely dinner with his youngest son, William Preston. Another son, Carter Henry Jr., was still at the fair. After a brief nap, Harrison received a visitor who had gained entry simply by telling a servant that he wished to have a word with the mayor. This was not unusual;\n\nthe mayor`s door was always open to all citizens. The visitor was Patrick Eugene Prendergast, a 25-year-old newspaper carrier who had illusions of becoming the city`s corporation counsel even though he was not a lawyer and his only legal ''training'' consisted of reading a popular legal tome, ''Every Man His Own Lawyer.'' Approaching the mayor and without saying a word, Prendergast pulled a six-shooter from his overcoat pocket and fired three shots at the mayor.\n\nHearing the shots, the family coachman raced into the room and saw Prendergast fire a final round at the mayor. The coachman then ran out to get his own revolver, but by the time he returned, Prendergast had vanished. William Harrison came in next and found his father lying across the doorway of a pantry passageway, moaning and bleeding profusely. W.S. Chalmers, president of the Allis-Chalmers steel company, who had rushed over from across the street upon hearing the shots and the ensuing commotion, helped William carry the mayor to a sofa. ''Chalmers,'' reportedly said the dying Harrison, ''this is death. I am shot over the heart.''\n\nMeanwhile, the assassin ran for several blocks, caught a streetcar, got off it and walked to the Desplaines Street police station, where he calmly told the desk sergeant that he had killed the mayor. Later, in a formal statement, Prendergast justified his action by saying: ''He deserved to be shot. He did not keep his promise to me.''\n\nThe assassination cast a pall over the city. ''Our Carter,'' the man who had been leader to a generation of Chicagoans, was gone. Mourners lined up outside the Harrison mansion into the night, talking, crying, trying to make sense out of a senseless act. At the world`s fair, the closing festivities were canceled, putting a mournful end to what had begun as a joyful celebration.\n\nPrendergast was convicted of murder and sentenced to die by hanging. ''I had no malice against anyone,'' he said as the noose was placed around his neck. The Harrison legacy, however, did not end with the mayor`s death. Mirroring his father`s political career, Carter Henry Harrison Jr. also served five terms as Chicago`s chief executive, establishing a family record unmatched in Chicago`s political history."}, {"url": "https://chicagology.com/notorious-chicago/harrisonmurder/", "page_content": "Notorious Chicago | 1893 Fair Gallery\n\n\u201cGenius is but audacity, and the audacity of Chicago has chosen a star.

He returned to his residence at 5 o\u2019clook very weary. the exercises at the Fair Grounds having taxed his energies to their utmost. Dinner was served at 6 o\u2019clook, and after the repast the Mayor retired to the back parlor and lay down on a couch. with the remark that he would take a rest, but that he was to be awakened if any person called or any message was received for him. He fell into a\n\npeaceful sleep.\n\nSoon after 8 o\u2019clock the door bell rang, and the maidservant answered it. She found at the door a small-sized, weazen-faced. smooth-shaven man. who asked if the Mayor was at home. In reply to the maid\u2019s interrogatory, he gave his name as Prendergast. As the name was a familiar one to the maid. she admitted the man to the hall way and closed the door. She then went to the rear parlor where the Mayor was sleeping and awoke him. He did not at once enter the hall where Prendergast was waiting, and the maid had returned to tne servants\u2019 quarters in the basement of the house before the tralledy occurred.\n\nCarter H. Harrison residence\n\n231 Ashland Boulevard\n\nThe house is an old-fashioned double brick, with a hall through the centre, on either side of which various rooms open. From the direction taken by the maidservant when she announced him, Prendergast, who was waiting in the hall, knew in which of the rooms the Mayor was. He apparently grew impatient at the delay, and before the Mayor appeared he had started toward the rear of the hall, intending, in all probability. to enter the room, but just as he was approaching the door the Mayor appeared through the doorway.\n\nPrendergast then delibera.tely placed a large-sized revolver close to the Mayor\u2019s body and fired. The shot struck the Mayor in the abdomen, and. he reeled and fell backward, catching at the side of the doorway as he fell. As he was falling the assassin fired a second time, the bullet striking the Mayor just above the ear. The murderer surveyed his work for an instant, and then fired a tnird time at the prostrate body of his victim. The shot this time struok Mr. Harrison in the left hand.\n\nThe three sbots were all fired as quickly as it was possible with the heavy thirty-eight-calibre revolver which Prendergast had in his hand, and before the other peopie in the house could get to the Mayor\u2019s assistance his murderer turned and fled through the hall out the door, down the long walk between the lawns to the gate and out on Ashland Avenue.\n\nAs he ran down the walk to the street, the gardener who had been aroused by the shooting. ran around the side of the house and tried to overtake him. Prendergast saw his danger from this source, and as he ran fired a shot over his shoulder at his pursuer. It went wide of its mark. but it was effective in keeping the gardener at a distance. The murderer was able to make his escape into the darkness.\n\n\u2013\n\nHe ran away at this time in order to avoid being killed by those who were attracted by the shooting. for half an hour later he gave himself up at the Desplaines Street Police Station.\n\nSergt, Frank McDonald was just receiving over the telephone the news of the Mayor\u2019s death. when he was interrupted by the exclamation,\n\nI am the man who did the shooting!\n\nSergt. McDonald started at the appearance of the man. but he qniokly asked bim to stop inside the railing. The man did so. He was trembling with excitement, but to all appearances, except for the agitation, was perfectly sane. He repeated the remark that he had made on entering the station, to those who quickly gathered about him, he said:\n\nI killed Mayor Harrison!\n\n\n\nI worked hard for him during his campaign for the Mayor, and he promised to make me Corporation Counsel He was elected. but he failed to keep his promise, and I have shot him because he didn\u2019t do as he said he would.\n\nPrendergast still carried in his hand the revolver with which he shot the Mayor. It was taken from him by Sergt. McDonald. He appeared to be about twenty-five years old, about 5 feet 7 inches in height, and of slight build.\n\nThe police officers at the station were afraid that as soon as the cause of the Mayor\u2019s death became generally known a mob would collect to avenge him. Prendergast was therefore not placed in a cell at the Desplaines Street Station, but in charge of four policemen was taken in a carriage to another part of the city and locked up to await the judicial inqUirY into his rash act.\n\nThere were no eye witnesses of the brutal, cold-blooded murder. In the house at the time were Preston Harrison, the Mayor\u2019s youngest son; Sophie Harrison. his daughter; the butler, and three maid servants. Preston Harrison and his sister were in the upper part of the house. The servants were all below stairs, the maid who answered the bell being the only person of those in the house ut the time who caught sight of the murderer. Preston Harrisou was the first to reach the side of his father.\n\n\n\nOn his way down stairs Preston Harrison rang the police call twice. The shots made him aware that some desperate deed had been oonsUlnmated. but he did not know as he called the police that he was summoning them to look for the murderer of his own father. He was overcome by horror and grief, but he immediately went up stairs. where he met his sister Sophie, who was preparing to descend, and gently forced her back to her room, where, with as much care as .was possible, he told her of the awful fate of her father.\n\nW. J. Chalmers of 234 Ashland Boulevard. who was standing at the door of his house, directly opposite the Mayor\u2019s residence, heard the shooting. and calling to his wife that there was trouble over the way, he quickly ran across the street in time to Eee the assassin make his escape. He entered the house and met Preston Harrison just as the young man advanced to the doorway in which the prostrate form of the Mayor lay.\n\nLife was rapidly ebbing away. Blood was flowing freely from the three wounds in the Mayor\u2019s body, and the carpet beneath him was saturated with it. The two men picked Mr. Harrison up and carried him to the couch from which he had arisen to meet his murderer.\n\nMr. Harrison said:\n\nI am shot. Preston, and cannot live. Where is Annie?\n\nMr. Harrison hastily left his father\u2019s side and rushed out upon the street in pursuit= of the assassin. In the meantime Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Chalmers. who live across the street, had started for the Harrison residence, as they had heard the shooting. They saw a man running up Ashland avenue and met tho son Preston in pursuit. Young Mr. Harrison stopped long enough to inform his neighbors of the terrible affair and then started in pursuit of the murderer. Mr. and Mrs. Chalmers hastily entered the house, Mr. Chalmers at once making a pillow of his oyercoat which he placed nnder Mr. Harrison\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cI have been shot and oannot live,\u201d said tbe Mayor, as he gasped for breath.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t die.\u201d said Mr. Chalmers.\n\n\u201cYou have only been shot in the abdomen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I have beeu shot in the heart and I know I cannot live.\u201d was the reply.\n\nThose were the last words of Mayor Harrison.\n\nNeighbors gathered about the doorway in great numbers. Only a few of these were admitted to tho house. Thoae within were anxiously waiting the appearance of one other woman, who in a short time was to have become the bride of the man who was at that moment in the throes of death.\n\nMiss Howard hat! been here for several days. She was to have been married to Mayor Harrison Nov. 7 at Biloxi, .Miss., her home. When in this city sho has always visited at the Mayor\u2019s house, and. the two became very much attached to each other. The attachment ripened into love, and early this Summer the engagement was announced. Extensive arrangements were under way for a splendid wedding. A special train was to have borne the party to Biloxi. and fetes were prepared there for their entertainment. Miss Howard came here at this time to finish the preparation of her trousseau. She was to have returned to Biloxi early next week. As usual. she visited at the Mayor\u2019s house, which is presided over by Mrs. Carter H. Harrison, Jr. Miss Howard left tho house after dinner in company with Mr. Carter H. Harrison, Jr. They returned together, but Miss Howard was the first to enter the house. She did so between the files of sympathetic neighbors who had gathered about the house.\n\n\n\nThe unusual crowd and the serious faces of the people in it prepared the two women for some dreadful catastrophe. But up to the time they entered the doorway they had no hint of the real trouble. It would have taken a very callous person to have breathed the story of the crime into their ears at such a time. It was left for the members of the family to break the news. Miss Howard and Mrs. Harrison were met by Preston Harrison at the door, and guided up stairs out of reach of those who had gathered 1n the house. There they were informod of what had taken place. Miss Howard\u2019s grief was pitiable, and Mrs. Harrison fainted away.\n\nNeither Miss Sophie Harrison. Miss Howard, Mrs. Carter Harrison, Jr., nor Carter H. Harrison, Jr., saw Mr. Harrison alive after dinner. Carter H. Harrison. Jr. was down town, and did not return home until the news of his father\u2019s death reached him through the rumors which speedily went flying over the city. Miss Howard and Mrs. Harr1son did not reach the house until after Mayor Harrison had passed away.\n\nThere was the greatest oxcitement all over the city when the news of the murder was bruited about. It raged most hotly in the throng which filled the grounds about the Mayor\u2019s house. This nearly resulted in the lynching of an innocent man. R. Earle Smith, a young wan living at 359 Ashland Avenue. was passing the Mayor\u2019s house just as Prendergast paased in. He noticed Pendergast, and wondered if the man were a politician or somebody who was helping the Mayor in his preparations for his approaching wedding. Just after Mr. Smith had passed the house, he heard two shots, and he felt at once that= the man whom he had seen enter the Mayor\u2019s residence was responsible. He quickly made up his mind to lie in wait for him. and catch him as he came out.\n\nWith this end in view, Smith entered a clump of lilac bushes which adorn the grounds in front of the house on eaeh side of the path leading up to the door. When Prendergast appeared at the door, after killing Mayor Harrison, and ran down the path, Smith sprang from the buahes and attempted to grapple with him.\n\nPrendergast eluded his grasp and, jumping over the fence, ran down Ashland Avenue toward Adams Street. Smith ran after him and followed him as the murderer turned down Adams Street. Smith says that just as be tUrned the corner of Adams Street two more shots were fired in the house. and he turned back, as it seemed impossible for him to cat.ch Prendergast, to see what new trouble was brewing in the ill fated mansion. As he turned into the grounds on his return,. the butler pointed a revolver at him and commanded him to surrender\n\n\n\nSmith tried to explain who he was, but the butler cried out:\n\nHere is the murderer!\n\nThose who ran up took up the cry, and in an instant Smith was surrounded by an angry mob, which, in addition to handling him roughly. threatened him with lynching.\n\nThe police patrol walton which came up in response to Preston Harrison\u2019s call brought several policllmen, one of whom arrested Mr. Smith in spite of his vehement statement that he was only trying to catch the murderer. The policeman finally led\n\nMr. Smith to tho house, where he was readily identified as a neighbor, and his\n\nrelease. of course, followed.\n\nWhen Prendergast was removed from the Desplaines 8treet Police Station he was conveyed in a carriage to the Central Police Station in the City Hall. Here he was taken in charge by Inspector Shea, who at once proceeded to catechise him as to the incidents leading up to the crime.\n\nPrendergast said that he made up his mind to kill the Mayor yesterday. He went out on Milwaukee Avenue and purchased a second-hand revolver at a pawn shop for $5. The revolver was a five-shooter. At 8 o\u2019clock, as nearly as he could remember, he went to the Mayor\u2019s house and rang the bell.\n\n\n\nHow many shots did you fire?\n\n\n\nI fired three shots. That was enough. There was another in the gun.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat is your full name?\n\n\n\nPatrick Eugene Joseph Prendergast. My mother is a good, innocent woman. She lives over at 609 Jane Streut, west of Seymour. We used to live at 357 Ohio Street.\n\n\n\nDid you ever go to school?\n\n\n\nYes. I\u2019m a good Catholic. I studied at St. Patrick\u2019s School. I know a good many big men. Now, there is Archbishop\u2014 \u2014, I forgot his name.\n\n\n\nWhat happened there?\u201d asked the Inspector.\n\n\n\nI told the girl who came to the door that I wanted to see the Mayor. She asked me for my name and I gave it to her, and told her I had particular business with the Mayor.\n\n\n\nWhat happened then?\n\n\n\nWhy the girl went in and told Mr. Harrison that I wanted to see him.\n\n\n\nAnd then?\n\n\n\nI shot him. I didn\u2019t say a word to the Mayor, nor he to me. I shot him and I was justified in doing it.\n\n\n\nBut what did you have against the Mayor?\n\n\n\nI made up my mind to shoot him, and I had some difficulty in doing it. The Mayor failed to fulfill his promise to me to elevate the tracks!\n\n\n\nWhat happened when the Mayor came to the door?\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t remember exactly. I came out and ran away. Men chased me. I jumped on a street car and rode down to Desplaines Street Station. I walked in to the Sergeant\u2019s desk and said, \u2018I have killed the Mayor.\u2019\n\n\n\nWho are your relatives?\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve got one brother John. He\u2019s a clerk in the Post Office. My mother and I used to live at 357 Ohio Street.\n\n\n\nWhere do you work?\n\n\n\nI work as a distributor for The Morning Inter Ocean and Evening Post. I am employed by the city circulators of these these papers. J. H. Johnson is the circulator of the Inter Ocean.\n\n\n\nHow old are you?\n\n\n\nWhy, I\u2019m twenty-five. I think I was justified in shooting the Mayor. If I get a fair trial before a fair jury I\u2019ll be acquitted.\n\n\n\nHave you ever studied law?\n\n\n\nNo, I have never studied or practiced. I just put that pistol in my pocket and went over and shot the Mayor.\n\nAt frequent intervals the prisoner squirmed unoasily in his chair and refused for a moment to proeeed. He is a smooth-faced, hollow-cheeked, weak-looking young man, the most prominent feature of his face being a protruding under lip. His whole appearance indicated a depraved and vicious mind. His nose is sharp and crooked, and his hair cut short, sparsely covers his misshapen head.\n\nThe Mayor took a prominent part in the endeavor to provide employment for the unemployed during the exceedingly dull season of last Summer. He did everything in his power to advance the work on municipal improvements in order that the laborers out of work might be provided with employment cleaning the streets, constructing sewers, and laying gas and water mains. At the meetings of the Commmitte of Two Hundred, whioh was appointed by him to take charge of the entire matter of furnishing food and employment for the unemployed, he was found to be alive to the interests of the poor people of the city, fertile in suggestion, and solicitous that the work of relief and of furnishing employment might be begun without delay. Many of the suggestions which were adopted by the committee with such success were made by him.\n\nThe social duties of the Mayor in connection with the World\u2019s Fair duting the entire Summer have been many and exacting, but through them all he carried himself with a dignity and frankness of spirit and action which won him the respect of Chicago\u2019s guests from abroad and the approval of her citizens. One of the first of these was the reception of and entertainmcnt for some days of the Duke of Veragua and his suite. At public functions as well as in the privacy of his own beautiful home on Ashland Boulevard. Mayor Harrison did his share to make the visit of the descendant of Columbus at the World\u2019s Fair a pleasant one.\n\nOn another notable occasion the Mayor also did the honors as the head of a great city in a wav Which left no cause for complaint. This was on the occasion of the reception and entertainment of the= Spanish Infanta. Mayor Harrison\u2019s gallantry was given full expression on all of the public and private functions at which he appeared as the representative of the city which was entertaining the Princess. In connection with the receptions of prominent people and special days at the World\u2019s Fair, Mayor Harrison was called upon to make some forty speeches, and was always in the best of humor, and his speeches were uniformly well received, though they were often criticized.\n\nIllustrations of Assassination of Chicago\u2019s Mayor Harrison from Harper\u2019s Weekly November 11, 1893, From Sketches by Charles Mente and T.

At 11:48 o\u2019clock yesterday morning the trap of the gallows fell from beneath his trembling feet and the rope put an end to his wretched life. He made no speech. He did not speak a word from the time the death march started from the room where he had passed his last night on earth, save for a whispered sentence to the black robed priest who stood beside him on the scaffold. Aside from the trembling of his limbs and the deep breaths which ended in gasps there was no sign from him to show he feared the end.\n\nHis death must have been without pain, as his neck was broken by the fall of six feet and there was not a perceptible movement after the trap was sprung. A jury of physicians occupied two benches just in front of the gallows. When the trap fell County Physician Fortner, who headed the jury, stood beside the shrouded body to determine when life had become extinct. There was a wait of five minutes when the other physicians were called to aid in the examination. His pulse continued to beat for almost ten minutes, then the last flutter ceased and Prendergast was pronounced dead. Another five minutes was passed and then the rope\u2019s end was loosened, the body lowered into a waiting coffin, and all was over. The law had taken its course.\n\nPrendergast Verdict\n\nDecember 29, 1893\n\nPrendergast\u2019s brother appealed the sentence, saying that Eugene was insane. The attorney for the appeal was not-yet-famous Clarence Darrow. It was Darrow\u2019s first murder case\u2013and the only one he ever lost to the executioner. The appeal was denied, and Eugene Prendergast was hanged on July 13, 1894.\n\nFour years after Harrison\u2019s murder, his son\u2013also named Carter Harrison\u2013became mayor of Chicago. Like his father, the younger Harrison would be elected to the office five times.\n\nNOTE:\n\nThe two times that Chicago held a world\u2019s fair, both times the mayor was shot and killed.\n\nAlmost forty years later, in an attempt to kill President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt, Chicago Mayor, Anton Cermak was shot and killed during a yachting event in Miami, on February 21, 1933, just a few months before the opening of the Century of Progress World\u2019s Fair. The mayor died on March 5th and the murderer, Giuseppi Zangara, was electrocuted on March 20."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Carter-Henry-Harrison-III/6000000020320319036", "page_content": "About Carter Henry Harrison III\n\n\u2022GRAD: 1845 Yale College \u2022Event: Elected BET 1879 AND 1887 Mayor of Chicago, IL \u2022Event: Elected BET 1875 AND 1879 U.S. House of Representatives from Illinois \u2022Event: Elected 1893 Mayor of Chicago, IL\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Harrison,_Sr.\n\nCarter Henry Harrison, Sr. (February 15, 1825 \u2013 October 28, 1893) was an American politician who served as mayor of Chicago, Illinois from 1879 until 1887; he was subsequently elected to a fifth term in 1893 but was assassinated before completing his term.

He was educated by private tutors, and was graduated from Yale College in 1845 as a member of Scroll and Key. Following graduation, he traveled and studied in Europe from 1851 to 1853 before entering Transylvania College in Lexington, where he earned a law degree in 1855. He was admitted to the bar in 1855 and commenced practice in Chicago; Harrison came to Chicago because he saw it as a land of opportunity.\n\nHarrison ran an unsuccessful campaign in 1872 for election to the Forty-third Congress. Beginning in 1874, he served as a member of the board of commissioners of Cook County. He was elected as a Democrat to the Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth Congresses, and delegate to the 1880 and 1884 Democratic National Conventions.\n\nA Summer's Outing\n\nIn 1890, Harrison and his daughter took a vacation trip from Chicago to Yellowstone National Park and Alaska. His letters from the trip were first published in the Chicago Tribune and later compiled into the book (1891): A Summer's Outing and The Old Man's Story.\n\nAssassination\n\nThe night of the Haymarket Riot in 1886, Harrison walked unmolested through the crowd of anarchists and advised the police to leave the demonstrators alone. The riot was sparked by a bomb, reportedly thrown at police by anarchists. After leaving office, Harrison was owner and editor of the Chicago Times from 1891 to 1893. He was re-elected in 1893, in time for the World's Columbian Exposition. His desire was to show the world the true Chicago, and he appointed 1st Ward Alderman \"Bathhouse\" John Coughlin to sit on the reception committee. On October 28, 1893, two days before the close of the Exposition, Harrison was murdered in his home by Patrick Eugene Prendergast, a disgruntled office seeker. Harrison was buried in Chicago's Graceland Cemetery. Prendergast was hanged on July 13, 1894. Harrison was Chicago's first five-time elected mayor; eventually his son, Carter Harrison, Jr., was also elected mayor five times.\n\nHarrison's career and assassination are closely connected with the World's Columbian Exposition, and are discussed at some length as a subplot to the two main stories (about the fair and serial killer H. H. Holmes) in The Devil in the White City. The celebration of the close of the Exposition was cancelled in lieu of a large public memorial service for Harrison."}, {"url": "https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/chicago/peopleevents/p_harrison.html", "page_content": "Carter Harrison, Chicago Historical Society\n\nCarter Harrison was born in a log cabin in Kentucky in 1825. After attending Yale College and finishing law school, his disgust with the institution of slavery motivated him to move north, to Illinois. In Chicago, he made his money in real estate.\n\nHarrison was first elected as mayor in 1879 and ran the city with a... personal touch, much like aldermen \"Bathhouse\" John Coughlin, or Edward F. (\"Foxey Ed\") Cullerton did. \"Bathhouse\" Coughlin, for example, was accused of having a profitable interest in the liquor store that supplied all the brotherls in the red light district of his ward.\n\nIn Chicago, the electorate expected a certain amount of corruption. \"Foxey Ed\" once ran on the idea that it was \"better [to] send back the man who has stolen enough already than to send in... a new man.\" On election day, some aldermen would give free drinks to anyone passing through (or passed out) in his district, in exchange for a vote. Still, when times were tough, the same aldermen were handing out free lunches to anyone who needed one, every day of the year.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, many people believed the Republican party to be patronizing and moralistic, and the Democrats more concerned with protecting \"individual liberties.\" Or, as one local pol put it: \"A Republican is a man who wants you to go t'church every Sunday. A Democrat says if a man wants to have a glass of beer he can have it.\" Harrison was a Democrat who let people have more than beer. \"This is a free town,\" he declared, and let the brothels and gambling parlors operate openly in the neighborhood called the Levee. By concentrating all the vice into one district, he checked its spread, and police patrols made sure that the businesses were fair and did not cheat their customers.\n\nHarrison supported and encouraged neighborhood ethnic saloons, local institutions that might function as meetinghouses, post offices and welfare offices in one. The saloon licenses also provided 12% of the city's revenue and paid for the electrical lines, streetcars, sewer pipes, fire and police stations that Harrison built. He was the first mayor to cater to the various ethnic groups in his city. On St. Patrick's Day he wore his finest green. Germans heard about his friendship with Bismarck. With Scandinavians he claimed a Viking heritage, and among blacks he recalled being raised by a \"colored mammy.\" He welcomed everyone to Chicago and did not try to acculturate them into Anglo-American society, the way Charles Hutchinson or Jane Addams did.\n\nEveryone who wanted a word with the mayor could come to his open morning office hours, and he would address their problems. He was a friend of organized labor, and gave health and factory inspector jobs to union leaders. Harrison was known to restrain police from breaking up strikes and supported the eight-hour workday. Because the mayor supported their cause, organizers of the national May Day general strike of 1886 focused on Chicago. Events escalated over the following days and violence broke out at Haymarket Square after the mayor left a rally there. After Haymarket, Harrison's leniency was cited disapprovingly as encouragement to the revolutionaries. He was voted out of office at the end of his fourth term.\n\nThen, as the World's Columbian Exposition was in preparation, Harrison made his comeback. He wanted to be mayor of Chicago for the most important event in its history. In his inaugural speech of 1893, he said:\n\n\"When years ago I stood before you, aldermen of Chicago, and took the oath which fitted me for this high office, Chicago had less than half a million population; to-day it is the sixth city on the face of the globe, the second in America in population, and the first city on earth in pluck, energy, and determination. Standing thus, I feel deep anxiety lest I may not fulfill the expectation of the vast majority of my fellow citizens who have honored me.\"\n\nThe fair was so successful that Harrison tried to keep it open for another season so that millions more people could come visit Chicago. In addition, he hoped the continued employment and infusion of tourist dollars would cushion Chicago from the looming economic depression. Two nights before the end of the fair, Patrick Eugene Joseph Prendergast, a lunatic demanding a city job, entered Harrison's home and shot him dead.\n\nA funeral procession of tens of thousands of Chicagoans followed Harrison's casket to Graceland Cemetery. Half a million stood in the street to watch as uniformed police officers and firemen, postal carriers and city clerks paraded by. Irish, German, Scandinavian, Polish and Italian communities all had representatives who marched. Union leaders mourned, as did the wealthy business elite who were Harrison's poker buddies."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Capt-Carter-Harrison-Sr/325453529870007126", "page_content": "About Capt.
