He grew up in the loving care and protection of his parents.\n\nStevens was a normal kid who attended school and sold newspapers during his free time.

He became an instant celebrity as many audiences loved his role as Larry Mondello.\n\nRomantic Affairs and Relationships\n\nTheresa Marinelli (Rusty Stevens\u2019 Wife)\n\nStevens is happily married to Theresa Marinelli.

Everybody lost touch with him.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mathers did not lose hope and left no stone unturned to find his old buddy. Finally, he succeeded in finding Stevens, who was in New Jersey, working as a car insurance salesman.\n\nSo, Jerry persuaded Rusty to participate in 1983 Leave It To Beaver reunion movie, and Rusty did three guest spots on episodes of The New Leave It To Beaver, making his final TV role the same as the first. From then on, the pair of best buddies never lost touch again.\n\nRusty Stevens Movies List\n\nMovie Released Year Role The New Leave It To Beaver 1983-1989 Larry Mondello Still the Beaver 1983 Larry Mondello The Rifleman 1963 Melvin Wagon Train 1962 Johnny Perry Mason 1962 Brucie Hillman My Three Sons 1962 Cletus Bleeker National Velvet 1961 Alvy\u2019s Friend The Jim Backus Show 1961 Alexander \u2018Sandy\u2019 Cleaver Angel 1957-1969 Leave It to Beaver 1957-1960 Larry Mondello Shirley Temple\u2019s Storybook 1960 Stuffy Cole/ Gypsy Boy 77 Sunset Strip 1960 Max Cimarron City 1958 Boy Reading Script Cat On A Hot Tin Roof 1958 Sonny Telephone Time 1958 Fat Boy Racket Squad 1951 Detective Steve\n\nControversy\n\nRusty Stevens had gained massive popularity for his role as Larry Mondello. Undoubtedly, he would go on to achieve great heights in his acting career. However, things took an unexpected turn when Rusty\u2019s parents suddenly moved from Burbank to Philadelphia.\n\nIt was in the middle of the 4th season when the show\u2019s producers announced that Rusty would no more appear in the show. This left many of his fans surprised, and they couldn\u2019t understand why he left in the middle of the show.\n\nRusty as Larry Mondello from Leave It to Beaver\n\nLater, Barbara Billingsley, who played June Cleaver in the series, said in a TV Archive interview that Stevens was fired because his overbearing mother caused grief for the producers. She said,\n\n\u201cWe all loved Rusty so much. He was so good in that role, and unfortunately, they had to let him go because his mother was such a pain in the neck.\u201d\n\nHowever, the former child actor later revealed that it was he who had wanted to leave the show. According to Rusty himself, the truth is that as his character Larry Mondello became more popular on the show, he was signed to a contract by the show producers. At that time, aside from the cast members, he was the only other actor to be under contract.\n\nAt first, Stevens loved spending most of his time at the studio. However, he started missing his everyday life, where he would go to school and spend time with his family. Rusty kept the frustration inside for a while, but later, he told his parents that he couldn\u2019t handle it anymore.\n\nRusty said he didn\u2019t know to what length his mother might have gone to help him. But eventually, the show producers released him from his contract.\n\nRusty Stevens Net Worth\n\nRusty Stevens was one of the most famous child artists of the 1950s.

He is wearing white prison overalls and the collar of his shirt is stained with what looks like faded tomato sauce. Curiously, one of the first things he mentions when he starts to speak is the poor quality of the prison food. \"Hotdogs, hamburgers, pork this and pork that,\" he says with a laugh. \"There's quite a bit of pork.\"\n\nHis upbeat demeanour is at odds with his predicament. Nine years into a 144-year jail sentence for assorted charges, including felony escape and embezzlement, Russell is one of the Michael Unit's most notorious and closely guarded inmates. His skin is pale and puffy from the 23 hours a day he spends in solitary confinement and he has almost no contact with the outside world. We have to speak into connected phone receivers to make ourselves heard through the thick screen and the line is crackly and unclear even though he is sitting only two feet away from me. Several months ago, a fellow prisoner shook him by the hand while he was being walked to his cell \u2013 it was the first time Russell had been touched for almost a decade.\n\nAnd yet, despite his desperate situation, Russell insists his story is not a dispiriting tale of crime and punishment. Ask him why he is here, incarcerated and alone, and he will answer without missing a beat that it is because he was a fool for love.\n\n\"This is a love story,\" he says, light and breezy as a chatshow host. \"It's about what a person will do, who is in love, who can't see the forest for the trees.\" He smiles his crooked smile and sits back in his chair. A glimmer of sweat appears on the flesh just beneath his right eye and he wipes it away rapidly with the sleeve of his shirt.\n\nSteven Jay Russell has many other names. As well as the 14 known aliases he used while fabricating bogus credentials and passing himself off variously as a judge, a doctor, an FBI agent and a bar student, he has been nicknamed \"Houdini\" and \"King Con\" for his remarkable ability to escape from prison. From 1992, when he was imprisoned for the relatively minor charge of insurance fraud, Russell managed to escape four times from several different Texan jails over a five-year period. His story has been immortalised in a film starring Jim Carrey: it had its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January and is due to be released in the UK next year. Critics have already called it \"top notch\" and \"an hilarious tragedy\" in the vein of Steven Spielberg's 2002 hit movie Catch Me if You Can, which recounts the real-life story of con artist Frank Abagnale Jr.\n\nLike Abagnale, who successfully stole millions of dollars by posing as a pilot, an attorney and a doctor, Russell's life story is also the stuff of improbable fiction. His escapes were marked by astonishing brazenness that left law-enforcement officials slack-jawed in bafflement. But unlike Abagnale, Russell's shenanigans were driven by his obsessive love for a fellow inmate called Phillip Morris whom he met in jail in 1995. (The escapes always took place on Friday 13th, the day on which Morris was born.)\n\n\"It was lust at first sight,\" says Russell now, in his first interview since the film went into production. \"I didn't think it was possible. I mean, we were in prison! He was softly spoken, with a deep southern accent. I saw him in the law library trying to get a book. He's short \u2013 he's only 5ft 2 and I'm 6ft 2, and I said, 'Hold on, I'll get that for you.' And that was it.\"\n\nI ask Russell to describe the man for whom he experienced such a startling coup de foudre. \"He's very intelligent, he loves fishing and four-wheel driving. He loves music.\" What kind? \"Oh, er, classical, like Bach and Beethoven and Mozart. He's like a little mess. He's a diabetic, but he'll go out and buy 12 doughnuts and eat them all at once.\"\n\nRussell and Morris, who was serving a sentence for failing to return a rental car, were both released on parole in 1995. Setting up home together in Houston, Russell went in search of money to lavish on his lover. He persuaded a medical insurance company to hire him as their chief financial officer on the basis of a greatly exaggerated CV with all references directed back to him. In five months, he embezzled $800,000 from dormant accounts to fund the couple's glamorous lifestyle of Mercedes-Benz cars, jet-skis and matching Rolex watches. Russell even had his teeth capped and plastic surgery on his eyes.\n\nEventually, he was found out and sent back to jail, but not before impersonating a judge over the telephone and demanding his own bail money be lowered from $900,000 to $45,000 (he paid with a cheque that later bounced). Back in captivity, his escapes were from then on shaped by the single, overwhelming desire to be with Morris.\n\nPerhaps, then, it is no surprise the film of Russell's life, which co-stars Ewan McGregor as Morris, is being released with the self-explanatory title, I Love You Phillip Morris. The gay love story at the heart of the film initially put off several American distributors; it was finally acquired in May by Consolidated Pictures Group and is due for release in the US on Valentine's Day next year.\n\n\"I think it's a good title,\" admits Russell. \"I did those things because I wanted to be with Phillip. I was out of control.\" And therein lay his fatal flaw; despite managing repeatedly to outwit the federal authorities, Russell was always caught because, each time he escaped, he would end up beating a path to Morris's door. He claims not to have seen Morris, who now lives in Arkansas, for several years. Does he still love him?\n\n\"Well, I'm not in love with anyone else,\" he says, shrugging his shoulders. \"I miss him. But I'm also realistic. I don't want to ever do anything that would hurt him again and any action I took now would cause him problems. I can't be with him, there's no way they [the authorities] would let that happen.\"\n\nHow does that make him feel? \"It doesn't make any difference how I feel about it,\" he says, his natural ebullience temporarily deserting him. \"You can't feel sorry for yourself. I did this to myself.\"\n\nIn person, the 52-year-old Russell is an engaging, quick-witted conversationalist. He claims to have an IQ of 163 and spends his days reading newspapers and magazines. \"I have a stack this high,\" he says, lifting his hand several feet off the floor. \"I read the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Scientific American, National Geographic and the Economist. You can't be lazy. If you don't keep yourself focused in here, you lose your mind.\"\n\nHe talks in a soft, southern drawl punctuated with high-pitched laughter and looks quite unexceptional: he is bald, broad-shouldered and plump, with stubby fingers. Perhaps his only distinguishing feature is his mouth, which opens to reveal sharp and surprisingly delicate teeth.\n\nBut it is this unmemorable physical exterior that has proven to be Russell's greatest asset. He seems to possess an extraordinary capacity to transform himself and go unnoticed. According to Steve McVicker, the Houston-based journalist who befriended Russell and wrote the book on which the film is based: \"He has lots of different voices and he always makes sure to give a different face in every mugshot.\"\n\nRussell's escapes were never violent \u2013 he claims, even now: \"I didn't break out. They opened the door and let me through\" \u2013 but they were ingenious. Twice, he simply walked through the front gates. In 1993, while languishing in the Harris County Jail in Houston for making a false insurance claim about an injured back, Russell disguised himself as a workman with a walkie-talkie and a pair of women's black trousers stolen from the prison infirmary. \"I tapped on the security gate with my walkie-talkie and the guy let me through,\" he explains, nonchalantly. Was he scared? \"No. And if you are scared, you really mustn't show it. You have to act like you're meant to be there.\"\n\nThree years later, he stockpiled green felt-tip pens from prison art classes, squeezing the ink from the cartridges into a sink of water and dying his overalls the colour of surgical gowns. \"You have to be very careful because if you wring them out, you get streaks in the material,\" he says matter-of-factly. Underneath the makeshift medical clothes, Russell taped several plastic bags tightly to his body so that police dogs would not be able to follow his scent once he was on the run. He picked a moment when the woman manning the front desk was on the telephone and then, unquestioned by prison staff, simply walked out \"dressed like Dr Kildare\".\n\n\"You do get a huge adrenaline rush. I walked to the woods just outside the penitentiary and after about 100 yards, I turned round and went like this [he mimes giving someone the finger with the glee of a naughty child]. I guess it was kind of arrogant.\"\n\nRussell walked to the nearest house, knocked on the door and claimed to be a doctor who had been involved in a car accident and who needed a lift into town. The stranger obliged. \"By the time they had their helicopters and search teams out, I was drinking margaritas in a bar in Houston.\"\n\nBut not for long. Within the year, he was back in jail, this time plotting his most daring escape ever. Over a 10-month period in 1998, Russell began to feign the symptoms of Aids. He ate almost nothing and took laxatives in order to look as emaciated as possible. He wrote up fraudulent health records on the prison library typewriter and sent them to the relevant department in the internal mail system for inclusion in his medical file. Astonishingly, Russell was so persuasive that the Texas authorities never ran their own tests and he was transferred to a nursing home. From there, he posed as his own doctor over the telephone and received permission from parole officers to take part in a non-existent treatment programme. A few weeks later, the bogus doctor called the prison to let them know that, sadly, Russell had died.\n\nIn reality, Russell was very much alive and on his way, once again, to be with Phillip Morris. \"That escape was the most difficult,\" says Russell. \"I had to completely discipline myself to lose the weight and did lots of reading up on the symptoms of Aids. You do whatever you have to do. I get my ideas from studying. I watch, I look for weaknesses. You look the whole way around something and you never let yourself get blocked in.\n\n\"I don't think I'm cleverer than the police, but I managed it because they think anyone who is a criminal is stupid and they're complacent. I think anyone can escape from anywhere.\"\n\nHe says he is convincing at assuming different professional personae because, in each case, he is able to sound like he knows the terminology. \"Most of the time I make it up, it's just bullshit.\" I ask him to demonstrate and he immediately slows his voice down to a deep, languid drawl. \"I, uh, did a bail hearing for Steven Russell this morning. I don't have the computer print-out in front of me but the docket sheet should reflect his lowered bond.\" He grins. \"It's kind of like acting.\"\n\nNo one is quite sure what to make of Russell, a man who possesses as many facets as he does aliases. For Steve McVicker, who visited Russell every Saturday for six months while he was researching his book, it was hard not to warm to him. \"He's a natural-born liar but he's so charming and so funny,\" says McVicker. \"If he ever gets out of jail, I can imagine having dinner with him.\"\n\nTerry Cobbs, the commander of special operations at the Texas Department for Criminal Justice who tracked Russell down after his two last escapes, is less enamoured. \"He's a big guy so full of himself who absolutely loves the attention,\" Cobbs says. \"He's obnoxious. I can't stand to be around him for too long.\n\n\"There's two sides to him: if he's in a group of people who don't know his identity, there's a confident part, a remarkable ability to convince them. The other end of that is when he knows you know who he is and he's like a bowl of mush. All of his confidence goes out of the window, his voice will shake and he is a frightened little man.\"\n\nBut for Jim Carrey, the actor who plays Russell in I Love You Phillip Morris, the truth was more straightforward: \"The bottom line was that he [Russell] wanted to be loved and he felt disenfranchised his entire life.\"\n\nRussell politely dismisses this thesis when I put it to him, but there is much in his background to suggest it might be true. In 1957, Russell was given up for adoption at birth by his mother, who had just divorced his biological father and did not want to raise a child out of wedlock. Russell later tracked her down only to discover that she had remarried his father and given birth to three other children, each of whom was Russell's biological sibling. \"I felt rejected,\" is all he will say now. \"I had a little bit of a problem when I found out.\"\n\nHis adoptive parents, Brenda and Thomas, were a conservative couple who ran one of the largest food produce companies in the state of Virginia. Russell later married and had a daughter, Stephanie. For much of the late 1970s, Russell was a law-abiding citizen who played organ for the local church and, somewhat ironically, volunteered as a deputy police officer.\n\nBut in 1985, the death of his adoptive father triggered a personal crisis. Walking out on his wife and 12-year-old daughter, Russell moved first to Houston, where he began living as a gay man and then, three years later, to Los Angeles.\n\n\"People use the term 'sham marriage', but I don't think it was a sham because there was a sexual attraction towards women, but there was always a stronger attraction towards men,\" he says. \"I finally let go and it became easier to deal with my sexuality because I wasn't trying to hide it.\"\n\nIt was his sexuality that, indirectly, first led Russell into criminal activity. He claims to have been sacked as a sales manager for a food services company in Los Angeles when the chief executive found out he was gay, after which he spiralled into bitterness. \"When I lost my job, that really screwed with my head,\" he says. \"I lost control of my life.\" Soon, he was being arrested for lewd behaviour and false passport applications. When he fraudulently pretended to have hurt his back to claim insurance money, he was sent to jail in 1992 for the first time.\n\nLooking back now, does Russell feel guilty about any of it? There is a long pause. \"Yeah,\" he says finally. \"I feel bad that I've deprived my daughter from seeing me [Stephanie still occasionally visits Russell in jail]. I was a completely different person back then.\" He claims that he is resigned, now, to a future behind bars \u2013 he says that planning escapes was \"exhausting\" and that he no longer suffers from the extreme anxiety he would get while on the run (although he still has nightmares about being chased).\n\nWould he do it all again? \"No. I would never put myself or anyone else through that. Instead of feeling sorry for myself when I lost my job, I would have got another job. I didn't know how to react because I was angry. I'm not angry anymore.\"\n\nIn fact, news of the film's release has made him into something of a celebrity among his fellow inmates and he is occasionally asked for autographs, sometimes even from the prison guards. Although he has not been able to see the movie yet, Russell has managed to download some clips from Google and is struck by the accuracy of Carrey and McGregor's portrayal.\n\nCarrey and Russell have never met, but the actor has heard taped recordings of Russell's voice and Phillip Morris acted as an adviser to the production. \"They've got it down,\" Russell says. \"The way we speak, the mannerisms, the clothes \u2013 everything. It's surreal.\"\n\nYet despite Russell's apparent acceptance of his fate, few around him are convinced. McVicker says he would not be surprised if Russell turned up on his doorstep tomorrow. \"He's just so darn persistent,\" says McVicker. \"If I know Steven, he's in touch with Phillip Morris right now.\" Terry Cobbs remains \"absolutely positive that his little brain is constantly turning\".\n\nAnd it is difficult to believe that Russell, with his finely tuned people-watching skills and his childish delight in getting one over the authorities, does not miss the social interaction of life on the outside. He tells me he is \"pretty happy\", but there is a gap at the end of his sentences, a small exhalation of sadness, a drooping at the corner of his tired eyes that suggests otherwise.\n\nOf course, if he does plan to escape, it will have to be on Friday 13th. Does he know when the next one will fall? \"November,\" he replies, without hesitation and for the briefest instant his face is totally serious, his mouth set in an unsmiling line. Then he catches himself and starts to giggle. Perhaps King Con is not ready to lay down his green marker-pens just yet.\n\nShow us the money - other real-life con artists on film\n\nThe Sting (1973). Starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford as a pair of professional grifters who set out to con a mob boss (Robert Shaw), George Roy Hill's caper movie was inspired by two real-life confidence tricksters, Fred and Charley Gondorff, who were among America's most wanted during the 1930s. The film won seven Oscars.\n\nSix Degrees of Separation (1993). Based on the play by John Guare, Fred Schepisi's film told the cautionary tale of the con artist David Hampton, who fooled New York society into believing that he was Sidney Poitier's son. Melanie Griffith and Calvin Klein were among those Hampton conned into letting him stay in their homes and giving him thousands of dollars. Played in the movie by Will Smith, he died of Aids in 2003.\n\nCatch Me If You Can (2002) Steven Spielberg's comedy-drama starred Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank Abagnale Jr who, before his 19th birthday conned millions of dollars by cashing bad cheques while posing as a Pan Am pilot, a Georgia doctor and a Louisiana attorney, among other aliases. Having sold the film rights to his ghost-written autobiography, the real Abagnale was pleased with the movie. He now works as a consultant for the FBI and runs Abagnale & Associates, a financial fraud consultancy company. Catch Me If You Can has now been adapted into a musical, which opened in Seattle last month.\n\nColour Me Kubrick (2005). John Malkovich's performance was the high point of this film, based on the life of Alan Conway, a man who pretended he was the director Stanley Kubrick for almost two decades. Directed by Brian W Cook, the film followed Conway's exploits as he got his victims to hand over money and sexual favours in return for a part in his next \"film\". A Londoner, Conway ran a travel agency with his wife in the 80s before leaving her for a man and embarking on his career impersonating Kubrick."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/education/dorothy-e-smith-dead.html", "page_content": "While she first applied her approach as a middle-class, educated, heterosexual mother and wrote about it in feminist terms, Dr. Smith saw it as a tool available to anyone marginalized by conventional sociology\u2019s dominant forms of inquiry. And, indeed, subsequent scholars have used her methodology to study things as disparate as the lives of gay men and the way the police treat Black teenagers. It was, she said, \u201ca sociology for people.\u201d\n\nDorothy Edith Place was born on July 6, 1926, in Northallerton, a small town in northern England. Her father, Tom Place, was a timber merchant. Her mother, Dorothy Foster (Abraham) Place, was a university-trained chemist who as a young woman had been active in the women\u2019s suffrage movement. She spent time in jail for breaking windows at Harrods department store in London, alongside Sylvia Pankhurst. When Ms. Place left the movement in the 1920s, her parents bought her a small farm, where she met her future husband.\n\nYoung Dorothy grew up amid a brilliant brood: Her brother Ullin became a renowned philosopher, while another brother, Milner, became a widely published poet. All three, as well as another brother, David, went to boarding school, though Dorothy\u2019s education was primarily to prepare her for motherhood.\n\nShe resisted that path as much as she could. She took a two-year course in social work at the University of Birmingham, then moved to London, where she became active in Labour Party politics. She worked as a secretary for a publishing company. To widen her career opportunities, she applied to study at the London School of Economics. She was 25 when she was accepted.\n\nShe received a bachelor\u2019s degree in sociology in 1955. Along the way she discovered Marxism and the work of the French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty, both of which would greatly affect her work; that same year she married an American, William Smith, who was studying in London on the G.I. Bill.\n\nThey both entered graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, where she received her doctorate, also in sociology, in 1963. She defended her dissertation nine months after giving birth to her second son. Around that time her husband abandoned the family.\n\nWith two children to raise alone, Dr. Smith took a temporary job lecturing in sociology at Berkeley. The only woman on a faculty of about 40, she was often ignored by her colleagues. That imbalance led her to wonder what effect the male dominance of a field, especially a social science, might have on the questions it asks and the methods it uses to answer them. It was the starting point of a nearly 60-year career."}, {"url": "https://search.ancestry.com/search/category.aspx?cat=124", "page_content": "In a few of the marriage collections on Ancestry, you will find the indexes that link to images of actual marriage records.

There was the governor, local assemblymen, international figures such as Oliver North, even Desmond Tutu.\n\nBut there was no photo of his wife, Dorothy. None of her two young children. Indeed, most of the people who knew Miller--including those who worked with him for years--say they did not know he was even married.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeither did saleswoman Jayne Marie Maghy when she met him on a plane in January. And after a six-week romance that included limousine rides and meals at expensive restaurants, she married him in Las Vegas. But soon after the glow of her whirlwind courtship dimmed, the new Mrs. Miller became suspicious of her husband\u2019s business and personal dealings.\n\nWith the help of a private detective she stumbled on to the other Mrs. Miller and on Sept. 15 confronted her husband.\n\nIt was a confrontation that cost her her life, police say. Jayne Miller was shot to death in the Central Florida town where the couple had moved earlier this year. David Miller, 41, is being held in a Sanford, Fla., jail without bail on a charge of murder.\n\nThe killing has sent a wave of astonishment across the Valley and served to pull back the veil that shielded David Miller\u2019s secret life.\n\nMany who thought they knew him now count themselves as victims of a con man. Some wonder if the violent end to David Miller\u2019s double life could have been averted if they had voiced suspicions they had early on.\n\nDorothy Miller said she met David Miller in Granada Hills in 1979. The recently divorced owner of a hair salon was raising two young boys and after she met Miller in an attorney\u2019s office, a romance began.\n\nDorothy Miller said her future husband told her that he had been divorced once and had just moved to the Valley from the Washington area where he had held government jobs, including being an aide in the Nixon Administration. He was raised in Sardis, Ohio, and wore an Ohio University ring. University officials last week confirmed that he attended the school but refused to reveal other information until Miller cleared up financial obligations to the school.\n\nWithin six months, the couple moved in together and later bought a house on Aldea Avenue in Granada Hills. They weren\u2019t formally married until Aug. 11, 1985, when they drove to Las Vegas and were wed in a roadside chapel. Dorothy Miller still has the marriage license. She says there was never any divorce.\n\nAs a Valley-based lobbyist, David Miller initially specialized in representing the printing industry on state legislative issues. In 1987, his reputation as a lobbyist landed him a job as a legislative aide to Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), but McClintock said he fired Miller after six months because of unexplained absences and poor performance. Miller then opened an office called David Miller & Associates in the same building that housed the Granada Hills Chamber of Commerce.\n\nHis firm expanded to include developers as clients, and civic activities had him involved in chamber functions. He served a term as president of the chamber and then as president of the United Chambers of Commerce, an umbrella organization for 20 Valley chambers.\n\nThose who know Miller described him as a name-dropper who drove a Jaguar and stayed at first-class hotels while traveling. He took clients and business acquaintances out for pricey meals and picked up the tabs. Some said Miller told them he was an attorney, though there is no record of him as a member of the California Bar.\n\n\u201cHe was so good at stories,\u201d said a businesswoman who knew Miller for years but who didn\u2019t want to be identified. \u201cThey would get long and complicated. He could tell wonderful stories, but there was always the feeling that that\u2019s what they were, stories.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear why Miller kept his wife away from his business and social interests. Dorothy Miller said that the story her husband told her was that the life he led in California was a front.\n\nHis real work, he said, was for the CIA.\n\n\u201cFrom the day I met him, he always told me CIA stories,\u201d she said in a recent interview from Belle Vernon, Pa., where she now lives. \u201cHe told me it was free-lance work. He was always involved in international incidents. Whatever was in the news.\u201d\n\nThough admittedly embarrassed now, Dorothy Miller said she believed her husband. And there was some evidence that he was traveling abroad. He often brought back souvenirs from foreign countries and there were calls home that were put through by Spanish-speaking operators.\n\nSometimes, he told her of international events that she saw on the news. Sometimes, he told her of events that never hit the news--like the time he came home with a cut leg and said he had been grazed by a bullet.\n\n\u201cIt was convincing,\u201d she said. \u201cHe could explain enough and include enough details to make it believable. When I had questions he just told me I would have to trust him on it. He told me that a lot.\u201d\n\nDorothy Miller said she met few of the people her husband did business with in the Valley and never once set foot in the office because her husband said it would be a security risk. He explained that the business was a CIA front set up to trap a target in a web of unspecified international crime.\n\nBut the trap was apparently never sprung. In 1989, David Miller moved his wife and her two sons to Orlando, Fla. She said he explained that he was closing the California office and selling their house because the family could be in danger.\n\n\u201cHe said it was security reasons,\u201d Dorothy Miller said. \u201cHe said, \u2018You have to trust me.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Millers bought a new house in Orlando and Dorothy got a job at a local hair salon. She said her husband continued to travel, coming home for only a few days at time and always regaling her with tales of international intrigue.\n\nWhat Dorothy Miller did not know was that her husband did not close his Granada Hills office and continued to live in the home they had shared there. And while it is unknown where all of his travels took him, it is clear his business and civic activities in the Valley continued until at least early this year.\n\nBusiness acquaintances said that until early this year Miller was heavily involved in establishing the San Fernando Valley Leadership Program, a 10-month seminar in which citizen activists and business and government officials spend one day a month learning about and discussing an issue of public importance, such as environmental health, transportation or crime.\n\nParticipants in the program, sometimes numbering as many as 30, each paid $700 tuition when it was first instituted by Miller in 1987. The program, deemed a success by alumni such as Richard Alarcon, now Valley deputy for Mayor Tom Bradley, has been repeated every year since and the tuition has risen to $1,200. Inspired by its success, Miller & Associates began efforts to market the concept in other communities across the country.\n\nHeavily involved in the program and also anticipating an increase in his company\u2019s lobbying and business consulting clients, Miller added Ross B. Hopkins, a former public affairs manager for Lockheed Corp., to his firm in November.\n\nBut the anticipated boom went bust, Hopkins said.\n\n\u201cHe overextended,\u201d Hopkins said in an interview. \u201cHe counted on some contracts coming in that didn\u2019t come in.\u201d\n\nMeantime, older sources of revenue--developments on which Miller had consulted--dried up as the work was finished and the contracts completed, Hopkins said. By early 1991, Miller was facing severe financial problems.\n\nOne creditor was Jacklyn Smith, owner of a Glendora firm that sells supplies to printing companies. Smith said she had given Miller, whom she had known for several years, a $17,000 loan that he repaid in January with a check that bounced. He then supplied another check from another bank, which also bounced, she said.\n\nSmith later made a complaint to Los Angeles police, and investigators are attempting to determine if Miller committed fraud by giving her the checks knowing that they would not be covered by his banks.\n\nMarge Russo, owner of a Reseda real estate agency, said that she loaned Miller $6,500 for the purchase of a Palm Springs condominium, but that he also failed to pay her back. She has since filed a lien against him.\n\nAccording to records with the county recorder\u2019s office, Miller stopped making mortgage payments on his home and foreclosure proceedings were begun. Records also show his company failed to make at least $4,500 in tax payments to the state.\n\nThere were other debts as well. Hopkins said Miller stopped paying him and other employees soon after the start of the year. He said that on at least two occasions people came into the office looking for Miller and saying he owed them money.\n\nBut after the first of the year, Miller was rarely in the office to greet clients or creditors. While his financial world was crumbling, his personal life was apparently quite active.\n\nDorothy Miller said her husband spent the Christmas holidays in Orlando with her, but on Jan. 1 said he had to leave on a secret government assignment to South America.\n\nBut acquaintances said Miller actually flew back to his life in California. And while on the plane he met 33-year-old Jayne Maghy, a divorced mother, with whom a romance blossomed as soon as the plane touched down in Los Angeles.\n\nAccording to Jodie Bowen, who describes herself as Maghy\u2019s best friend of 10 years, Miller \u201cwined and dined\u201d Maghy, boasting that he was an attorney worth $4 million. There were front-row seats to \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera,\u201d weekends at expensive bed-and-breakfast inns in Newport Beach, dinners at formal political functions.\n\n\u201cHe was Prince Charming,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cWe had to go out and buy gowns for her so she could go to some of these functions with him. And he was obsessed with her. He called her every day. She was not happy with her job and thought, \u2018Here is someone who can take me away from this life.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMiller and Maghy were married Feb. 16 in a Las Vegas chapel. Bowen was the witness and that weekend the new Mrs. Miller won $3,000 playing video poker, a lucky start to what would be an ill-fated marriage.\n\nDavid Miller did not keep the marriage a secret. Before the wedding, he had announced the marriage plans at a Granada Hills Chamber of Commerce dinner and after taking the vows he promptly called his associates from Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cIt had been difficult getting ahold of him,\u201d Hopkins, his former associate, said of the period. \u201cHe was not in the office and I thought he was out trying to round up clients. Then he called and said, \u2018Guess what? We\u2019re married.\u2019 \u201d\n\nA group of friends and associates gathered at Miller\u2019s office on March 1 for a small reception for the couple. Hopkins said the happiness exhibited for the Millers was tinged with somberness. Some of those toasting Miller had not been paid by him in a month.\n\n\u201cI felt very bad for the staff because they were having problems and here the guy was getting married,\u201d Hopkins said.\n\nAt least one of Miller\u2019s friends believes that some people who knew him were uneasy about his marriage because his financial problems were becoming known. There were also rumors that he was already married.\n\n\u201cThe joke was that he wanted to marry her quick, before she found out the truth about him,\u201d said a woman who worked with Miller on Chamber of Commerce projects. \u201cEverybody knew he didn\u2019t have any money. And I think some people specifically knew he was already married.\u201d\n\nAfter the marriage, Miller\u2019s financial problems quickly escalated, according to financial records and acquaintances. Business associates and creditors said it was increasingly difficult to contact Miller and recalled that in the instances where he was seen, he often became emotionally upset. Miller alternately explained that he was facing financial crisis or said he had cancer.\n\nAlarcon, Mayor Bradley\u2019s Valley deputy, said that at a meeting of representatives of Valley political officeholders Miller tearfully announced that the Leadership Program would be his legacy in the Valley.\n\n\u201cWhen I asked him what was wrong, he told me he had cancer,\u201d Alarcon said.\n\nJohn Dyer, a business consultant who subcontracted with Miller to share office space with him, said that on the occasions that Miller did come to the office, his moods changed noticeably.\n\n\u201cI think it was obvious to everyone who saw him that his state of mind had changed--changed considerably,\u201d Dyer said. \u201cHe would have times of anger--open outbursts. And sometimes, he was open, his friendly old self.\u201d\n\nMiller was finally forced to close his office April 18, Hopkins said. Faced with foreclosure and liens for unpaid debts, he and his new wife signed ownership of the Granada Hills house over to a bail bondsman named Bert Hopper on May 7, according to country records.\n\nThe mortgage foreclosure was withdrawn, but other debt holders said they never got their money. Hopper did not return repeated phone calls for comment on the house transfer.\n\nMiller then moved his new wife to Sanford, Fla., a small town outside Orlando. Dorothy Miller said that by this time her husband had already moved her from Orlando to Belle Vernon, Pa., once again telling her that the move was required as a security precaution.\n\nBut after making the move, Dorothy Miller said her husband stopped his routine of calling her every day. He also stopped making even infrequent visits home and she had no idea where he was. She said years of building suspicion finally got to her and she began making calls.\n\nFirst, she said, the CIA told her David Miller was not an employee, free-lance or otherwise. Next, calls to Chamber of Commerce officials in the Valley revealed that her husband had been active in the area until only a few months earlier--until he had gotten married.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018That\u2019s funny, since I already am his wife,\u2019 \u201d Dorothy Miller said. \u201cBut nobody knew about me there. They thought I was a crazy woman.\u201d\n\nDorothy Miller said that when her husband did finally telephone her in midsummer, she confronted him and he admitted that he had remarried. She said she cut off all communication with him and asked the police in Belle Vernon to investigate.\n\nMeantime, David Miller had taken his new wife and her parents to Europe in June despite his financial burdens. It is unclear how he paid for the trip. Vince Bertolini, also a former United Chambers of Commerce president who had worked with Miller, said he happened to run into his old friend June 26 in the lobby of a hotel in Rome.\n\n\u201cIt was very strange,\u201d Bertolini said. \u201cHe told me he was representing the Kuwaiti government, resolving issues from the Persian Gulf War. It was kind of off the wall.\u201d\n\nBertolini said Miller also acknowledged that he was having financial difficulties and said the experience taught him that \u201cyou really know who your friends are.\u201d\n\nAfter returning from Europe, the marriage of David and Jayne Miller foundered. Police said the two separated after repeated fights and each sought restraining orders against the other. Jayne Miller said in court documents that her husband had repeatedly threatened to kill her.\n\nSuspicious of her husband\u2019s dealings and debts, Jayne Miller next hired private detective Bob Brown to make inquiries. Brown said Jayne Miller told him her husband had claimed to be a tax attorney in California who moved to Florida to work at Disney World.\n\nBrown made routine computer checks and found David Miller\u2019s name linked with the name Dorothy Miller on car and house titles and tax rolls. He found no record of the couple being divorced.\n\n\u201cI told Jayne that it looked like this guy already had a wife,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt looks like he had had two houses, one here and one in California. He had evidently been commuting back and forth between wives.\u201d\n\nUsing Brown\u2019s information and old phone records left behind by her husband, Jayne Miller tracked down Dorothy Miller in Pennsylvania and the two confirmed each other\u2019s existence. Dorothy Miller said Jayne Miller told her that she was determined to confront their shared husband and expose him by going to the media with the story of the high-profile bigamist.\n\n\u201cI told her he was dangerous and warned her to stay away from him,\u201d Dorothy Miller said.\n\nBrown said he gave his client the same warning. And her friend Bowen sent her a plane ticket so that she could move back to California.\n\nBut Jayne Miller would never take the flight. On Sept. 15, according to Sanford police records, Jayne Miller called her husband and told him she was removing his property from a self-storage locker and that he would have to come and pick it up.\n\nBrown believes his client planned to empty her husband\u2019s property out of the locker and then leave before he arrived. She may also have felt less fear of her husband because a month earlier she had insisted that he turn a handgun he owned over to police for safekeeping and he had agreed to do so.\n\nHowever, Jayne Miller was still at the storage facility when her husband arrived. According to police, the couple began arguing about Miller\u2019s other wife and he struck Jayne Miller in the face. When she walked to her car, saying she was going to call the police, David Miller calmly walked back to his car and got a handgun, police said.\n\nMiller walked up to his wife\u2019s car and fired six times through the driver\u2019s side window at her, police said. He then walked around to the other side of the car and fired once more into the car, police said. Two cabdrivers who had been called by David Miller to help him take away his belongings said they witnessed the shooting and tried to aid Jayne Miller, but she was dead. They also held her husband and the gun until police arrived.\n\nSanford Police Chief Steven Harriett said the gun Miller used to kill his wife was the weapon he had checked in at the police station Aug. 27 for safekeeping. However, Miller had reclaimed the weapon three days later. Harriett said the department had no authority to keep the gun from him. \u201cWe had no basis to know what he was going to do with it,\u201d the police chief said.\n\nBrown said he doubted his client knew her husband had retrieved the gun before going to the storage locker.\n\n\u201cShe would never have gone there if she knew he had the gun back,\u201d he said. \u201cShe made a mistake and paid for it.\u201d\n\nHarriett said that while his investigators are aware of the accusations of bigamy and fraud surrounding Miller, they are not actively investigating the suspect\u2019s activities before the killing. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting and intriguing, but not pertinent to our case,\u201d he said.\n\nSome who knew Miller believe that more will remain unknown about him than what is known.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating,\u201d said Dorothy Miller, who is now living on welfare. \u201cDavid did a lot of things nobody can explain or that they thought he would never have been able to do. . . . He\u2019s a bad person and what he did wasn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nThere is also at least some frustration and guilt in the Valley. The woman who worked with David Miller on Chamber of Commerce functions said she believes that there are many who knew him who now wish they had voiced suspicions about his previous marriage and financial problems.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that all of us knew it, but nobody wanted to take responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one wants to be connected with it now. They just say he was a nice guy and they are shocked. Nobody wants to open up and say we should have told poor Jayne.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.publicrecords.com.au/topic/births-deaths-marriages/", "page_content": "Births, Deaths, Marriages & Divorces\n\nSearch births, deaths and marriages records in Australia.

Theresa, drove to Pittsburgh to talk about a job opportunity with Victory Media after his pending retirement and to look at the local housing market. En route, Theresa told Mike, \u201cJust so you know, we are not moving to Pittsburgh.\u201d\n\nThree days later, the two endured a weather-induced nine-hour drive from Pittsburgh back home to Washington, D.C., and the song was a little different: \u201cI think I could live in Pittsburgh,\u201d Theresa reflected.\n\nSo in September 2016, Mike retired from a formidable 33-year Navy career, accepted the Chief Operating Officer position with Victory Media, the parent company of Military Spouse, and the couple prepared for what could be one of their final moves \u2013 surely a new feeling after moving nine times during their 18 years of marriage.\n\nTechnology Improves Communication\n\nThe military lifestyle was not new to Theresa, whose father is a retired Navy chief petty officer and a retired civil service employee with more than 45 years of government service. She shares how her father would write her mother letters that sometimes would take months to arrive; her mother keeps a box of those letters to this day. While Theresa\u2019s father was deployed in Vietnam, he would send his family reel-to-reels that Theresa, her mother and her sisters would listen to together.\n\nDuring Mike and Theresa\u2019s early marriage, Mike would often have to wait in line to make a phone call to Theresa. Communication in the military has been limited. Until now.\n\nTechnology and the resulting improved communication has been among the biggest changes on the military spouse landscape, Theresa says. \u201cSpouses can email and get messages out instantly now with technology and communications,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nTheresa emanates pride as she talks about the eSailor initiative, one of the programs Mike spearheaded as MCPON. The initiative seeks to eliminate pen and paper and instead use e-tablets for communications. \u201cIt brings everything to the 21st century,\u201d she explains. Although change often can be met with resistance, Mike persevered with eSailor.\n\n\u201cMike is a strong person and he did things he knew was good for the sailors,\u201d Theresa continues. \u201cIt takes a strong leader to push things forward to do good things. My husband and I, everything we do is done by our faith in God. Anything Mike does is for the right reason; that\u2019s just the way he does anything. I\u2019m very proud of him.\u201d\n\nAn Artistic Ombudsman\n\nOne of Theresa\u2019s duties as the MCPON\u2019s spouse was that of being the ombudsman for all Navy spouses, advocating for the families and challenges they face. As a conduit between the military families and Chief of Naval Operations, Theresa would provide insight and understanding to the families and propose recommendations to the CNO as to how those challenges might be resolved.\n\nMike and Theresa traveled the world together to talk and listen to military families, as well as answer questions. Mike also reported to the senior leaders what the morale of the force was.\n\nMany of their duties as the voice of Navy families were not tangible or even written on paper. Mike says, \u201cThey are things you just do because you know they need to be done. There was nothing that said we had to go to Bethesda Hospital and visit with wounded warriors of all branches. Spend time with them, thank them, check on their families. Those are things you do because they must be done.\u201d\n\nReflecting back on such times elicits strong emotions remembering visiting with people in some of the most difficult circumstances they could imagine, including terminal illnesses, missing limbs and major accidents. \u201cThey become an enduring part of who you are,\u201d says Mike.\n\nTheresa\u2019s father was an artist and her mother was a professional seamstress, talents Theresa inherited, made her own and now shares with everyone she can. She originally started sewing and owned an embroidery business in Virginia. After Mike received PCS orders, however, she decided to close it because of the difficulties of obtaining business licenses and setting up new taxes in a different state. \u201cShe put my career before her personal interest and shut down the shop,\u201d Mike recollects.\n\nToday, Theresa draws animals, all of which have a heart incorporated somewhere. A drawing she did of Beboo, their nine-year-old Chihuahua, even is encrusted with crystals. She also draws diva girls; all of the ladies have the same mouth but each has a different hairstyle. Beyond drawing, Theresa crafts earrings and tie tacks. \u201cShe\u2019s very talented,\u201d Mike says. \u201cShe loves to draw, design, make things and then, most importantly, give it away.\u201d\n\nMike speaks to Theresa\u2019s compassion and generosity toward all: \u201cTheresa would put together little gift bags for families we would see. When we visited Singapore and several other countries, one entire suitcase she packed was full of gifts she made by hand. She gives something to everybody. It was amazing to watch as we would visit spouses with children whose husband was deployed. She would give them something and then both would start crying. It\u2019s amazing to see her have that impact. It\u2019s just something she does.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore one trip, I told her we needed to pack light and to not worry about bringing something along for everybody. She\u2019d just disregard a direct order and do it anyways,\u201d Mike good-naturedly recalls. \u201cIt\u2019s in her nature.\u201d\n\nAlthough they have retired from active duty, Mike and Theresa are looking forward to continuing their service to veterans and their families through volunteering and all the services offered by Victory Media\u2019s Military Friendly programs."}]}
