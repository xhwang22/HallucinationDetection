The chart illustrates the long-tail effect of streaming: Heat Waves by Glass Animals was released two years ago, but topped the US singles chart in early 2022 after a record-breaking 59-week climb to the top spot.\n\nIt also reveals the benefits of getting a superstar on a remix: Nigerian pop star Fireboy DML released his song Peru in summer 2021, though it found wider success when he released a version with Ed Sheeran six months later; Burns\u2019 Go steadily grew on TikTok from its debut there in 2020, which led to a refreshed version with Sam Smith released this summer. All versions of the same song \u2013 with newly recorded guest verses or remixes \u2013 count towards the original\u2019s chart placing.\n\nGlass Animals: Heat Waves \u2013 video\n\nThe British singles sweep is just one of the booms reported for the UK music scene in 2022 by the BPI. The UK\u2019s recorded music consumption has more than doubled in the past five years, and increased from 147bn audio streams in 2021 to 159bn in 2022.\n\nMore than 3bn audio streams were generated each week in 2022 on average: usually, it takes 1.3m streams to break into the UK Top 40 and a combined 7m audio and video streams to secure a No 1 single. Last year, 159m albums or equivalent streaming units were consumed; this year\u2019s figure is 166.1m.\n\nThe Top 10 albums of the year was also dominated by old releases and greatest hits compilations. Only Styles\u2019 Harry\u2019s House, at No 1, and Taylor Swift\u2019s Midnights, at No 3, were released in 2022. Ed Sheeran\u2019s =, Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s Sour, and the Weeknd and Little Mix\u2019s respective greatest hits collections were released in 2021; similar older compilations from Eminem, Elton John, Fleetwood Mac and Abba filled out the rest of the list.\n\nConsumer ownership of albums has generally plummeted, with digital downloads down by 18.9% from 2021 and physical albums \u2013 on CD, vinyl, cassette and other niche formats \u2013 down by 13.1% overall.\n\nNevertheless, physical sales continue to produce the majority of No 1 albums, accounting for 38 out of 52 weeks in 2022. One physical sale counts as one unit; to calculate album-equivalent sales from streaming figures, the Official Charts Company takes the 12 most-streamed songs from one album, down-weighting the top two songs in line with the rest \u2013 to avoid hit singles skewing an album\u2019s performance \u2013 and then divides the total streams by 1,000 on premium, paid-for services, and 6,000 for free, ad-supported services.\n\nVinyl sales grew for the 15th consecutive year, reaching a high of 5.5m units \u2013 the highest since 1990, when the list was topped by Phil Collins\u2019 \u2026 But Seriously. Unlike in the streaming-dominated singles and overall albums charts, eight of the Top 10 titles were released in 2022, led by Swift\u2019s Midnights, Styles\u2019 Harry\u2019s House and Arctic Monkeys\u2019 The Car.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Sleeve Notes Free weekly newsletter Get music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Swift, Arctic Monkeys and George Ezra\u2019s 2022 album, Gold Rush Kid, sold significant figures on the format. While cassette sales account for a tiny part of the overall market, the format has continued to grow, up 5.2% to 195,000 units, dominated by Florence + the Machine\u2019s Dance Fever, Muse\u2019s Will of the People and west London rapper Central Cee\u2019s 23.\n\nTaylor Swift: Anti-Hero \u2013 video\n\nThe share of the market occupied by independent record labels grew for the fifth consecutive year, from 26.9% in 2021 to 28.6% in 2022. The biggest new independent album was Arctic Monkeys\u2019 The Car, which was beaten to the top spot by Swift\u2019s dominant Midnights in October but achieved 120,000 units; their Domino label mates Wet Leg\u2019s self-titled debut was one of nine independent albums to top the UK albums chart in 2022.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Top 10 most popular singles of 2022\n\n1 Harry Styles \u2013 As It Was\n\n2 Ed Sheeran \u2013 Bad Habits\n\n3 Fireboy DML & Ed Sheeran \u2013 Peru\n\n4 Cat Burns \u2013 Go\n\n5 Ed Sheeran \u2013 Shivers\n\n6 Kate Bush \u2013 Running Up That Hill\n\n7 Glass Animals \u2013 Heat Waves\n\n8 Lost Frequencies and Calum Scott \u2013 Where Are You Now\n\n9 LF System \u2013 Afraid to Feel\n\n10 Sam Fender \u2013 Seventeen Going Under\n\nThe UK\u2019s Top 10 most popular albums of 2022\n\n1 Harry Styles \u2013 Harry\u2019s House\n\n2 Ed Sheeran \u2013 =\n\n3 Taylor Swift \u2013 Midnights\n\n4 The Weeknd \u2013 The Highlights\n\n5 Olivia Rodrigo \u2013 Sour\n\n6 Eminem \u2013 Curtain Call: The Hits\n\n7 Elton John \u2013 Diamonds\n\n8 Fleetwood Mac \u2013 50 Years \u2013 Don\u2019t Stop\n\n9 Little Mix \u2013 Between Us\n\n10 Abba \u2013 Gold \u2013 Greatest Hits"}, {"url": "https://www.bpi.co.uk/news-analysis/british-artists-in-a-historic-clean-sweep-of-2022-s-official-top-10-singles/", "page_content": "Record labels association the BPI today reports that UK artists have made history by claiming a clean sweep of the year\u2019s Top 10 singles for the first time ever, according to its analysis of Official Charts Company data1.\n\nBased on combined streaming and sales activity, all the Top 10 of the UK\u2019s Official Singles Chart of 2022 were by, or featured, domestic artists \u2013 the first time this has happened since the music industry began publishing year-end sales charts more than 50 years ago. This clean sweep was led by Harry Styles\u2019 As It Was and also included hits by Calum Scott, Cat Burns, Ed Sheeran, Glass Animals, Kate Bush, LF System and Sam Fender.\n\nBRITS CLEAN SWEEP OF OFFICIAL SINGLES CHART 2022 \u2013 \u00a9 Official Charts Company\n\nPos/Artist/Title\n\nHarry Styles \u2013 As It Was Ed Sheeran \u2013 Bad Habits Fireboy DML & Ed Sheeran \u2013 Peru Cat Burns \u2013 Go Ed Sheeran \u2013 Shivers Kate Bush \u2013 Running Up That Hill Glass Animals \u2013 Heat Waves Lost Frequencies & Calum Scott \u2013 Where Are You Now LF System \u2013 Afraid To Feel Sam Fender \u2013 Seventeen Going Under\n\nSee Notes for additional Official Charts.\n\nUK artists were also behind 15 of the year\u2019s Top 20 singles and close to 60 (58%) of the year-end Top 100 \u2013highlighting the extent to which streaming is enabling diverse domestic talent from all backgrounds, genres and eras to thrive. This strong homegrown presence is also significantly up compared to 2008, the year before Spotify launched in the UK and when the market was led by digital downloads and CDs. Then, UK artists claimed four of the year\u2019s Top 10 singles, seven of the Top 20 and just over 40% of the Top 100.\n\nThis exceptional performance by domestic artists came as UK recorded music consumption increased for the eighth consecutive year in 2022, with a landmark of more than 150 billion audio streams surpassed in a calendar year for the very first time, while three billion streams in a chart week is now commonplace.\n\nIn total 166.1 million albums or their equivalent were either streamed or purchased across all formats by music fans in the past year2. Overall, Streaming Equivalent Albums (SEA) made up a record 86.1% of the market with over 159 billion individual audio streams generated across the year \u2013 up 8.2% on 2022 and more than double the volume achieved in 2017, when the market had 68.1 billion audio streams.\n\nThe Top 10 clean sweep by domestic artists on the year-end chart reflects a memorable 12 months in which UK artists spent more weeks at No. 1 on the Official Singles Chart than in any previous year this century. Artists from the UK ruled for 36 weeks across the year, led by As It Was (10 weeks at No.1), LF System\u2019s Afraid To Feel (8 weeks at No. 1), Dave\u2019s Starlight (4 weeks at No. 1), Sam Smith\u2019s Unholy (with German artist Kim Petras) (4 weeks at No. 1), and Kate Bush\u2019s Running Up That Hill enjoying a three week No.1 run.\n\nYolanDa Brown OBE DL \u2013 artist, music education campaigner and BPI Chair, said:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see so many exciting new artists breaking through to thrive alongside more established UK artists \u2013 leading the next wave of British talent to global success thanks to the compelling mix of their creativity and artistry, the ever expanding opportunities afforded by streaming and the support of their record labels. I congratulate British artists and their teams on another year of brilliant success.\u201d\n\nCulture Secretary Michelle Donelan said: \"This clean sweep of the UK singles chart by British artists demonstrates the depth of creative talent we have. Everyone on the list has the ability to capture people\u2019s imagination and I would like to congratulate each of them on the achievement.\n\n\"It is amazing to see the breadth of talent from young artists like Ed Sheeran to music legend Kate Bush, showcasing the very best of British.\n\n\"This is fantastic news to kick off the new year and we will carry on backing our artists and musicians so they can continue this success through 2023 and beyond.\"\n\nHarry Styles was also behind 2022\u2019s top album with his Grammy and Mercury shortlisted Harry\u2019s House, making him the first artist since Lewis Capaldi in 2019 with Someone You Loved and Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent respectively to have the year\u2019s top single and album3. Harry\u2019s House led Ed Sheeran\u2019s =, which ranked as the No. 2 album for a second consecutive year, while Taylor Swift\u2019s Midnights was the year\u2019s third biggest album, having become the only album in 2022 to achieve more than 200,000 chart-eligible sales in a single week. UK artists have now provided the year\u2019s top album in 21 of the 23 years this century.\n\nThere were 11.6 million CDs and 5.5 million vinyl LPs purchased across the year, as well as 195,000 cassettes and 3.7 million album downloads. Vinyl LPs represented 31.7% of all physical purchases as sales grew for a 15th consecutive year and reached their highest level in over 30 years (stretching back to 1990).\n\nStreaming consumption averaged more than 3 billion audio streams each week in the UK in 2022\n\nMore than 3 billion audio streams were generated on average every week in 2022, compared to around 1.3 billion each week five years earlier. Over this time, the UK\u2019s audio streaming market has more than doubled in size from 68.1 billion to 159.3 billion audio streams and was last year over 40 times bigger than in 2012 (3.7bn audio streams). It now takes, on average, 1.3 million audio streams to break into the Official Charts Top 40 Singles and a combined 7 million audio and video streams to land a UK Number 1 single.\n\nHarry Styles\u2019 As It Was streamed 180.9 million times to become year\u2019s biggest single\n\nHarry Styles claimed the top single in a calendar year for the first time with As It Was. It spent 10 consecutive weeks at No.1 on the Official Singles Chart (as well as 15 weeks topping the US Billboard Hot 100 \u2013 a record for a UK artist) and became the only track to surpass 180 million streams during 2022.\n\nHaving been 2021\u2019s biggest single, Ed Sheeran\u2019s Bad Habits occupied the runners-up spot in 2022 as the track took its cumulative stream count to 354.3 million, while Sheeran was also at No.3 with his collaboration Peru with Fireboy DML and at No.5 with Shivers, another 2021 hold-out.\n\nDespite not topping the weekly Official Singles Chart, BRITs Rising Star 2023 nominee Cat Burns had the year\u2019s No.4 single overall, biggest debut hit and top single by a female artist with Go, which was first released in July 2020 and peaked at No.2 in June last year. Highlighting a hugely successful year for dance music, it was joined in the all-UK Top 10 by electronic duo LF System\u2019s own breakthrough hit Afraid To Feel and Where Are You Now by Calum Scott (with Belgian DJ and producer Lost Frequencies), alongside hits by Glass Animals (Heat Waves), Kate Bush (Running Up That Hill) and Sam Fender (Seventeen Going Under).\n\nLeon Neville, BPI\u2019s Director of Research & Insight, said:\n\n\u201cAt a time when streaming has created unprecedented competition coming from every corner of the globe, it is astonishing that in 2022 British artists were involved in all of the top 10 calendar year\u2019s biggest hits in the UK. This outstanding achievement is a testament to the rich music talent that continues to emerge from across the UK\u2019s nations and regions, fuelled by the passion, investment and skills of UK record labels.\n\n\u201cWith streaming having led the market to an eighth consecutive annual rise in UK music consumption, this platform is creating new and increased opportunities for labels to connect many thousands of artists with expanding fanbases, while enabling even more of them to succeed.\u201d\n\nDriven by streaming, a hugely diverse range of talent featured among the year\u2019s biggest hits.\n\nMuch of the talent that thrived thanks to streaming was UK based. This included global superstars Adele, Dua Lipa, Elton John and Sam Smith, major pop artists such as George Ezra, Lewis Capaldi, Mimi Webb and Tom Odell, hip-hop/rap acts including A1 x J1, Aitch, ArrDee, Dave, D-Block Europe, SwitchOTR and Tion Wayne, dance talent including Bad Boy Chiller Crew, Becky Hill, Bru-C, Eliza Rose, Jax Jones and Nathan Dawe, and rock bands and artists such as Arctic Monkeys, Coldplay, Sam Ryder and Tom Grennan.\n\nFast-emerging UK singer-songwriter, Tom Speight, who has already amassed over 200 million streams globally alongside a Top 40 hit, said:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such an exciting time to be an artist, with so many ways now to connect with fans around the world thanks largely to streaming and the support of labels in giving artists greater scope to succeed. With a new album out this year, I\u2019m optimistic that streaming will help to make this my breakthrough year.\u201d\n\nStreaming generating new audiences and revenue for classic hits of the past\n\nKate Bush is placed among an end of year Official Singles Chart Top 10 for the first time in her long and distinguished career with Running Up That Hill at No.6 overall after it was heavily featured in the fourth season of the Netflix series Stranger Things. First released in 1985, when it peaked at No.3, the self-penned, self-produced track topped the Official Singles Chart for three weeks in 2022 and was streamed 124 million times in total last year, 997% more than it managed in 2021.\n\nRunning Up That Hill is joined among the Top 40 singles of the year by Tom Odell\u2019s debut single Another Love which, a decade after first being released, returned to the Official Singles Chart Top 20 after building a new audience via Tik Tok. These successes highlight how streaming combined with record label support is generating new audiences and revenue for tracks, sometimes many years after they were first released. Kate Bush\u2019s streaming success this year even saw her break an Official Chart record for the longest time taken for a single to reach Number 1 \u2013 some 37 years after Running Up That Hill\u2019s first chart appearance. Kate also became the oldest female artist ever to score a UK Number 1 single thanks to the song\u2019s new-found popularity on streaming platforms.\n\nIndependents grow their share for the fifth consecutive year \u2013 now pushing at nearly 30% of the market\n\nIndependent record labels\u2019 share of the UK recorded music market increased for a fifth consecutive year in 2022 to 28.6% (AES). This was up from 26.9% in 2021, while the independent share has grown by nearly a third since 2017 when it stood at 22.1%. Nine independently released LPs topped the Official Albums Chart during the year by 5 Seconds of Summer, The 1975, Central Cee, Don Broco, Fontaines D.C., Louis Tomlinson, Stereophonics, Wet Leg and The Wombats, while over 60 indie albums reached the Top 10.\n\nAmong the most noteworthy indie releases of 2022 was Wet Leg\u2019s self-titled album \u2013 one of the most successful debut LPs released in the year. It was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize last summer and has since been nominated at the Grammy Awards in the US, where the group are in the running for Best New Act.\n\nAlthough it did not reach No.1, Arctic Monkeys\u2019 seventh studio set The Car achieved nearly 120,000 chart-eligible sales in its first week of release in October and became 2022\u2019s biggest new independent album. It was joined in the year\u2019s Top 20 by the group\u2019s 2013 release AM.\n\nVinyl hits a three-decade high as 2022 releases dominate top sellers / CDs & Cassettes remain important\n\nSales of vinyl LPs grew for the 15th consecutive year in 2022 to 5.5 million units, their highest level since 1990, when \u2026But Seriously by Phil Collins was the year\u2019s biggest-selling studio album, as brand new releases took a greater share of the market.\n\nEight of the year\u2019s Top 10 titles were released in 2022, led by Taylor Swift\u2019s Midnights, Harry\u2019s House by Harry Styles and Arctic Monkeys\u2019 The Car, which across the year achieved the three highest one-week sales for vinyl LPs this century. Midnights sold nearly 62,000 vinyl LPs in its first week of release, The Car almost 38,000 and Harry\u2019s House just over 36,000. The LP Top 10 of the year also included 2022 albums by Liam Gallagher (C\u2019mon You Know) and Muse (Will Of The People). In 2017, just three of the year\u2019s 10 biggest vinyl LPs were released in the year in question with the top sellers dominated by catalogue titles by artists including The Beatles and Pink Floyd.\n\nMore than 11 million Compact Discs were sold in the calendar year. Although this was a drop of 19.3% on the previous year, a number of albums sold in significant quantities on the format, led by Midnights by Taylor Swift, Gold Rush Kid by George Ezra and Arctic Monkeys\u2019 The Car.\n\nSales of cassettes, whilst still a very small part of the market overall, continued to grow in 2022, up 5.2% year-on-year to 195,000 units. The year\u2019s top sellers included Dance Fever by Florence + The Machine, Muse\u2019s Will Of The People and 23 by Central Cee.\n\nPhysical remains the pivotal \u2018kingmaker\u2019 in No.1 Album Chart Success\n\nPhysical formats again dominated the top of the Official Albums Chart, accounting for a majority of chart-eligible sales of the No.1 title in most weeks (38) in 2022, while in 33 weeks physical comprised more than 70% of chart-eligible sales of the week\u2019s top album.\n\nThis was led by Don Broco\u2019s Amazing Things (97.7% of chart-eligible sales), Robbie Williams\u2019s XXV (96.9%), Paul Heaton & Jacqui Abbott\u2019s N.K-Pop (96.3%), Olly Murs\u2019s Marry Me (92.0%) and Yungblud by Yungblud (91.4%) when they reached No.1. Digital download album sales further declined, down 18.9% Y-O-Y but still contributed 3.7 million units to the market. In a further format shift, rock band Muse became the first artists to top the Official Albums Chart with an album released as an NFT (non-fungible token) as their ninth studio album Will Of The People was released in a limited-edition NFT \u201cdigital pressing\u201d in addition to CD, digital, vinyl, cassette and on streaming services.\n\nDrew Hill MD Proper Music Group/VP Distribution, Utopia Music, said:\n\n\"It's fantastic to see another year where physical sales are driving albums to the top of the Official Charts. With 86% of 2022's No.1 records boasting a majority in physical sales, in their first week at the top, it continues to prove that music fans from across all ages and genres are continuing to desire their favourite music in a tangible form; as something to be cherished and collected as well as played on repeat.\"\n\nNotes\n\n1 The reporting year in 2022 comprises 52 weeks (ending 29 Dec 2022). Consumption data reflects volumes consumed in 2022 (via streaming and purchases) only. Please note that volume growth should not be equated with growth in recorded music revenue \u2013 the 4.3% consumption growth reported may therefore not be the same as any growth in revenues generated by this increase in UK consumption. The BPI will report on UK recorded music revenues for 2022 in Q1/Q2 2023.\n\n2 Album Equivalent Sales (AES) is a standard industry metric enabling sales & streaming volumes to be measured on a comparable basis so that total music consumption can effectively be gauged. This analysis converts all streams & sales data to 'Album Equivalent Sales' (AES). Physical & digital album sales have been included as per the Official Charts database, but the cumulative total for individual track sales has been divided by 10 (to provide a 'Track Equivalent Album' (TEA) figure). Both audio and video streams are now counted in the AES figure, but are weighted according to whether plays are derived from a \u2018premium\u2019 or \u2018ad-supported\u2019 source. Premium plays are divided by 1000 and ad-supported plays are divided by 6000 to comprise the \u2018Streaming Equivalent Albums\u2019 (SEA) portion of Album Equivalent Sales.

Harry Styles leads the pack with his smash hit As It Was, which spent 10 consecutive weeks at number one on the Official Singles Chart and was the only track to surpass 180 million streams during 2022, according to analysis of Official Charts data by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran followed behind with his track Bad Habits coming in second while his collaboration with Nigerian singer Fireboy DML, called Peru, came third.\n\nHarry Styles Credit: PA\n\nSouth London singer Cat Burns placed fourth with her song Go, which went viral on TikTok, Sheeran\u2019s Shivers came fifth and Kate Bush\u2019s 1985 single Running Up That Hill, which enjoyed renewed popularity last year after featuring in the Netflix show Stranger Things, took sixth. Oxford-based Glass Animals sleeper hit Heat Waves was seventh and former Britain\u2019s Got Talent contestant Calum Scott\u2019s collaboration with Belgian artist Lost Frequencies on Where Are You Now finished eighth. Scottish production duo LF System placed ninth with their track Afraid To Feel and North Shields singer Sam Fender rounds off the top 10 with his Ivor Novello-winning song Seventeen Going Under.

YolanDa Brown, musician and chairwoman of the British Phonographic Industry, said: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see so many exciting new artists breaking through to thrive alongside more established UK artists \u2013 leading the next wave of British talent to global success thanks to the compelling mix of their creativity and artistry, the ever expanding opportunities afforded by streaming and the support of their record labels. \u201cI congratulate British artists and their teams on another year of brilliant success.\u201d Leon Neville, BPI\u2019s director of research and insight, added: \u201cAt a time when streaming has created unprecedented competition coming from every corner of the globe, it is astonishing that in 2022 British artists were involved in all of the top 10 calendar year\u2019s biggest hits in the UK. \u201cThis outstanding achievement is a testament to the rich music talent that continues to emerge from across the UK\u2019s nations and regions, fuelled by the passion, investment and skills of UK record labels. \u201cWith streaming having led the market to an eighth consecutive annual rise in UK music consumption, this platform is creating new and increased opportunities for labels to connect many thousands of artists with expanding fanbases, while enabling even more of them to succeed.\u201d\n\nWant a quick and expert briefing on the biggest news stories?

My earliest memory is of listening to the charts with my mum in the early 70s, when I fell in love with music by the Bay City Rollers, the Osmonds, David Cassidy and Motown music in all its entirety. Now, as a Radio 2 listener, I don\u2019t always know what\u2019s top of the charts, or always care, but still have a love of music and can\u2019t go a day without listening to it.\n\nWithout fail, I would listen to the Top 20 charts rundown on a Sunday night, with my radio-cassette player ready to record those songs I liked or loved, ready to listen back to on my Sony Walkman on my cycle to school and back the following week. I remember the countdown for the Christmas No 1 was so important. Sadly, shows like The X Factor killed that. These artists and more formed the soundtrack to my life, and I now love sharing it with my 13-year-old son.\n\nFernando Augusto Pacheco, 36, London\n\nGrowing up in Brazil, I always looked up to the singles chart in the UK. I always thought it was more interesting than the American one. I loved the one-hit-wonders, the appreciation the British had for novelty hits and of course, the Spice Girls. Now, I am a bit older and living in London, still obsessed with the charts, I even have my own podcast about it \u2013 The Global Countdown. I used to follow the Spice Girls\u2019 chart run very closely, and it used to upset me if a favourite hit didn\u2019t reach the Top 10. I used to buy CD singles every week, now I buy on iTunes. I\u2019d rather buy a song than stream it.\n\nHarvey Summers, 58, Southport, Merseyside\n\nThe UK singles chart charted my own developing tastes, independence and first forays into personal spending power. Following toys (received as gifts, mostly) but before clothes, 45rpm singles were the thing I spent my (little bit of) money on, when I had saved enough. From 1972, I would listen to the Top 20 on the radio at 6PM, and jot down the chart. I would do this for the next decade, eventually switching to its first reveal on a Tuesday lunchtime. I actually went home from school for lunch in order to be able to do this.\n\nI remember the excitement of any single entering the chart at No 1 in those days \u2013 a rare occurrence then. Slade having three in one year \u2013 1973 \u2013 was phenomenal. I also remember being disappointed for years that Stevie Wonder had never had a solo No 1, then feeling more disappointed that he achieved it with his worst ever single [I Just Called to Say I Love You]!\n\nPhilip, Scarborough\n\nI don\u2019t think the UK singles chart means anything to me any more. But there was a time, like many others of my generation, when it did. Even if, in the early 80s, there may have been some disdain for the chart acts at the upper end of the Top 40, there was always an interest. I was interested in the numbers and the generated controversy of the charts. How long would Frankie Goes to Hollywood spend at No 1 with Relax? The singles chart was part of the fabric of life. Or, at least, part of the fabric of a teenager\u2019s life. It mattered even when it really didn\u2019t. It had a lot to say about British society at the time and I realised this much more when my family emigrated to North America in the mid-80s.\n\nThe key chart rundowns of my life were the charts of the early to mid-80s. The battles between the new romantic bands that eventually conquered the world: Culture Club, Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet \u2026 Coupled with the growing influence of videos, I was interested in new releases and then wanted to see how these new releases fared compared to the last ones.\n\nLiz Mannion, North Yorkshire\n\nWhen I was at school in the early 80s, the UK singles chart meant everything. Conversations were dominated by what was No 1 and which singles were being bought. Tuesdays were the days when we\u2019d race to listen to the chart rundowns on a transistor radio, secretly so as not to get it confiscated. March 1980 stands out as an exciting chart race \u2013 when the Jam\u2019s Going Underground went straight in at No 1. The excitement was palpable and I\u2019m sure we were impossible to teach that afternoon. We were 15 years old with everything ahead of us. Singles were currency to us, with the highest value ones (in addition to the Jam) being the Police\u2019s Roxanne, the Boomtown Rats\u2019 Rat Trap, and Bowie\u2019s Space Oddity.\n\nGraeme Arthur, 55, Fontainebleau, France\n\nWaiting for the Jam\u2019s Going Underground to be announced as \u201cstraight in at No 1\u201d on a Tuesday in March 1980 was a spectacular vindication of my emergent musical taste. Strange to think that wanting the music I liked to feature high up the charts was even remotely important to me given what I listened to. I\u2019ve still got the 7in of Going Underground \u2013 I might play it later.\n\nI was accompanying a group of 14-year-olds on a climbing trip up Mount Elgon on the Uganda/Kenya border during the Blur v Oasis showdown. The kids were a pretty diverse mixture of mostly Ugandans or kids of south Asian heritage \u2013 few had any English connection, and yet they argued about the merits of the bands. Blur won, as I remember, with choral renditions of their songs being offered to the mountain each day.\n\nCambridge Jones, London\n\nThe UK singles chart did mean everything for much of my youth \u2013 who was up, who was down, who was newly in and no longer in \u2026 and, of course, most importantly who was No 1! The official Top 40 was the only one that mattered because the placement mattered \u2013 so you couldn\u2019t have an unofficial No 10 or No 1 \u2013 what would be the point of that? Buying a single mattered \u2013 you were doing that for posterity. I still have them all, still care!\n\nSandy Burnett, 45, Perth, Australia\n\nLike many institutions, the UK singles chart has lost its significance over the years. Every Tuesday the chart was published. Every record store pulled out the full Top 75 rundown as the double page spread from Record Mirror magazine and taped it to the counter. There you could see what was new, shooting up the charts or sliding down the other way. On Thursday, Top of the Pops showed you what was predicted to be big. Then, come Sunday, you had the comprehensive rundown where every song in the Top 40 would be played. It was possible in those days for non-mainstream [acts] to cross over and achieve some moderate chart success. As a child, I would buy whatever was in the Top 20 in the early- to mid-80s. As I became a teenager, I questioned the authenticity of some pop music. Then I started listening to more left of centre music that rarely got anywhere near the charts."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/27/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s", "page_content": "As the coronavirus lockdown continues, the Guardian\u2019s music desk thought you might be in need of a distraction \u2013 something to send you down memory lane, or to divert the annoyance at your housemates or children on to us.

That takes us up to the Top 20, and from Monday to Friday for four weeks we\u2019ll have standalone celebrations of each remaining song by our team of critics.\n\nThis list, and the songs\u2019 order, was compiled via a politely raging video call between me, chief rock and pop critic Alexis Petridis and deputy music editor Laura Snapes. The ranking isn\u2019t based on sales or longevity, it\u2019s the fruit of that discussion: what we as critics, fans and lifetime listeners think are the most brilliant songs to top the UK charts, and, of those, which are more brilliant than others. The only rule was that an artist could only feature once.\n\nAs such, it is very much open to discussion, which we heartily encourage in the comments section. We\u2019d love to hear what you think of our choices \u2013 whether in agreement or outrage \u2013 and hear your fond or not-so-fond memories of these singles. After we\u2019ve reached No 1, we\u2019ll ask what you think we unforgivably missed out from the overall list, and then publish highlights from your selections.

Rock Around the Clock patently isn\u2019t it, but it was, incontrovertibly, the record that brought rock\u2019n\u2019roll to mainstream attention in the UK: two minutes of music that sounded infinitely more feral than its avuncular artist looked and that changed pop music for ever.

Photograph: Victoria Will/Invision/AP\n\n99\n\nLorde \u2013 Royals (2013)\n\nBy disavowing the hollow opulence and bloated scale of pop\u2019s reigning class, Lorde accidentally ushered in a brand new one: there would be no Billie Eilish if not for her conspiratorial incantations. While she weathered accusations of appropriation for disavowing hip-hop cliches in her obviously rap-influenced delivery, she ultimately echoed the genre\u2019s own move towards unvarnished portrayals of teenage disaffection instigated by a parallel wave of SoundCloud upstarts. As much a generational bellwether as a pop classic. LS\n\n98\n\nLieutenant Pigeon \u2013 Mouldy Old Dough (1972)\n\nRecorded in a Coventry front room, Mouldy Old Dough sounds like pop music made by people who have never actually heard pop music, but have had it described to them by someone who didn\u2019t really know what they were talking about: pub piano, growled vocals, a beat that recalls a drunk doggedly staggering home. The weirdness of 70s Britain in musical form. AP\n\n97\n\nDave and Ansell Collins \u2013 Double Barrel (1971)\n\nIf you wanted evidence of how far out, how unbound by the usual rules reggae was, you could find it at the top of the charts in early 1971: a piano line taken \u2013 sampled if you like \u2013 from Ramsey Lewis; a vocalist who largely grunted and bellowed incomprehensibly in the style of a Jamaican deejay: \u201cI am the magnificent W-O-O-O!\u201d It still sounds fantastic. AP\n\n96\n\nRoy Orbison \u2013 It\u2019s Over (1964)\n\nThe pinnacle of Roy Orbison\u2019s career as rock\u2019s great tragedian: three astonishing, inconsolable minutes during which stars cry, rainbows weep, golden days are sorrowfully recalled and drums beat a leaden funeral march, before it all reaches a terrible climax, Orbison desperately repeating the title as if misery is a kind of catharsis. AP\n\nPostmodern gold \u2026 Duo Geoff Downes and Trevor Horn of the Buggles. Photograph: Pictorial Press/Alamy\n\n95\n\nThe Buggles \u2013 Video Killed the Radio Star (1979)\n\nIt won\u2019t be too much of a spoiler to reveal that this is the only No 1 single in this list that concerns how the brutally uncaring nature of new technology can paradoxically deepen nostalgia while rendering the past irrelevant. Trevor Horn and co turned this material into postmodern gold, building jingles, prog, orchestral pop and more into a screwball fantasy. That cold steady kick drum, meanwhile, is like techno kicking the door down to take over pop culture. BBT\n\n94\n\nDua Lipa \u2013 New Rules (2017)\n\nAfter a fitfully successful start, this was the song to turn the Kosovan-British pop singer into a global star. You can almost feel her clamp a hand on your shoulder as she adopts a stern, schoolmarmish tone to dispense those rules for breakup survival: don\u2019t answer your ex\u2019s calls, let them pop round or even be their friend. She\u2019s not telling us or her mates, though, but rather herself, making for a powerful pop psychodrama. BBT\n\n93\n\nDel Shannon \u2013 Runaway (1961)\n\nBehind the simple, perky rock\u2019n\u2019roll facade \u2013 \u201cthe ultimate fairground anthem\u201d, as writer Bob Stanley put it \u2013 there\u2019s something disturbing about Del Shannon\u2019s biggest hit: an eeriness about the rumble of the opening guitar chords and the echoing keyboard solo, a sense the vocal is slightly too impassioned and pained. The result is as compelling a single as 1961 produced. AP\n\nNancy Sinatra with Lee Hazlewood\n\n92\n\nNancy Sinatra \u2013 These Boots Are Made for Walkin\u2019 (1966)\n\nHad These Boots Are Made for Walkin\u2019 been sung by a man, as its author, Lee Hazlewood, had intended, it would just have been nasty. Sung with insouciant cool by the recently divorced Nancy Sinatra, however, it became something else entirely: camp but tough, funny but fierce, completely irresistible.

First off, it\u2019s an actual Eurobanger (not an Aussie impersonator), and like the Village People\u2019s YMCA, it has a dance routine invented by fans that came to define the song. It\u2019s got an immediately iconic tag (\u201cdee dee da da da!\u201d), plus it was the victor in one of pop\u2019s funniest plagiarism cases: I want some of whatever the person who thinks this sounds like Lindisfarne\u2019s Fog on the Tyne was having.

(2015)\n\nThere will be howls of protestation at Bieber being on this list, a man routinely cited as everything that is facile about pop and celebrity. Well, he\u2019s had his moments, but this is one of his equally frequent triumphs. Taking the Insta-filtered aesthetic of the then-popular tropical house sound and marrying it to a melody that flits like a bird of paradise always coming back to its perch, it has the melancholically fleeting beauty of a package holiday sunset. BBT\n\n89\n\nSugababes \u2013 Freak Like Me (2002)\n\nProducer Richard X gets a lot of credit for the shuddering magnitude of invention behind the Sugababes\u2019 debut UK No 1 \u2013 the first legit single of the 2000s bootleg wave, bringing together Adina Howard and Tubeway Army \u2013 but not all of it. The newly minted trio of Mutya, Keisha and Heidi pull off a more convincing \u201cI\u2019m grown now\u201d transition than any of their American pop peers, thanks to the terrifying nonchalance innate to British teenage girls. It\u2019s got a classic belting \u201cmay-ee!\u201d (that\u2019s \u201cme\u201d in millennial pop terms) and without it, you wouldn\u2019t have Sound of the Underground \u2013 or, even, possibly, whisper it, Toxic.

BBT\n\nAdamski, left, with Seal in 1990.

Most beautiful of all is Seal: half activist, half oracle. BBT\n\n86\n\nThe Tornados \u2013 Telstar (1962)\n\nThe product of producer Joe Meek\u2019s twin obsessions \u2013 space travel and the recording studio as an instrument in itself \u2013 Telstar is otherworldly and breathlessly exciting, piling on layer after layer of sounds so dense with effects it is impossible to work out what instrument is making them. It\u2019s like nothing else, before or since. AP\n\n85\n\nThis will get you thinking, \u201cI miss the old Kanye\u201d \u2013 the rapper\u2019s touristic whirl through Ribena, wags and the epithet \u201crubbish\u201d is full of wit with just a touch of his incoming megalomania.

Photograph: Rex Features\n\n84\n\nGloria Gaynor \u2013 I Will Survive (1979)\n\nDecades of ubiquity have dulled the impact of I Will Survive, but the song only became ubiquitous in the first place because it connected with so many people so directly. The strings soar, the lyrics project defiance in the face of a controlling ex-partner, who\u2019s tried chancing his arm again: \u201cI\u2019m not that chained up little person still in love with you.\u201d AP\n\n83\n\nCher \u2013 Believe (1998)\n\nI Will Survive recast in hi-tech 90s dance-pop, complete with that notorious Auto-Tune wiggle to Cher\u2019s voice. The effect is actually used sparingly, and the song\u2019s wild success \u2013 11m copies sold worldwide \u2013 is not down to anything gimmicky. Rather, it\u2019s all very old-fashioned stuff that ensures Believe will be hollered in cheese nights for evermore: a powerhouse melody Cher uses to dispense a kind of den-mother wisdom.

Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian\n\n82\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t look back,\u201d Robyn insists over and over on her only UK chart-topper, though the racing arpeggiated synths, never resolving to the home key, tell a different story: one of someone doomed to the purgatory of heartbreak, or worse, revelling in it (a Greek chorus of strings charged with Kate Bush\u2019s DNA outlines the tragedy). \u201cAnd \u2013 it \u2013 hurts \u2013 with \u2013 ev \u2013 er \u2013 y \u2013 heart \u2013 beat,\u201d Robyn pants, and you feel it, each syllable landing like a tombstone. LS\n\n81\n\nElton John \u2013 Are You Ready for Love? (2003)\n\nFor someone who admits how hopeless he was at romance, Elton John couldn\u2019t half-sell a love song. Are You Ready for Love? runs the gamut of emotions as he tries to win someone over: he\u2019s casually cool about devotion yet awed by it; grandiose in his overtures, then almost manically overcome by fear that this person might not, in fact, be ready for love. The Thom Bell-assisted Philly soul production festoons John with strings, hand percussion, wah-wah guitar, key changes \u2013 in a sense perfectly echoing the maximalist, hasty approach to seduction that John has said he practised at the peak of his career. It\u2019s extraordinary that it took 24 years and a football advert to make it a hit. LS\n\n80\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the stuff of high-speed swerving grime bars. Instead, Dave and Fredo use steady, perfectly calibrated flows to set themselves apart from the London MCs one generation above them, set to minimalist trap. The effect is of being told something extra clearly, as if you haven\u2019t understood: a brilliantly withering technique. Rap\u2019s status as a core part of British pop culture was consolidated. BBT\n\nOrchestral drama \u2026 Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent. Photograph: Associated Newspapers /Rex\n\n79\n\nThe pop charts were particularly dominated by sweeping, sentimental ballads until the mid-1960s, and there are PhDs to be written on the effect on pop music of a sexually repressed culture of manners. Anyway, many such ballads are suffocatingly schmaltzy, but this one is sublime. It was written by Trent with Tony Hatch, a somewhat forgotten genius of this period who shared Burt Bacharach\u2019s knack for orchestral drama. The pair had an affair, with Hatch leaving his wife and marrying Trent \u2013 this collaboration is full of that impetuous, untameable ardour. BBT\n\n78\n\nThunderclap Newman \u2013 Something in the Air (1969)\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Thunderclap Newman thought they were making a kind of eulogy for 60s counterculture, but that\u2019s how Something in the Air turned out. Its music is ineffably melancholy, its insistence that \u201cthe revolution\u2019s here\u201d, a year after the hippy dream had curdled, sounds desperate and hopeless. Intentional or not, it\u2019s really moving. AP\n\n77\n\nEnya \u2013 Orinoco Flow (1988)\n\nPerhaps it takes not having lived through the 80s heyday of new age, then its subsequent ubiquity and mockery to appreciate Orinoco Flow as the compositional marvel it is. Yes, the lyrics are incredibly silly \u2013 but the layered pizzicato shimmer transforms Enya\u2019s dippy travelogue into a true pop mirage, stoking its allure as her siren song constantly slips further out of reach. LS\n\n76\n\nBaby D \u2013 Let Me Be Your Fantasy (1994)\n\nThe lyrics are essentially a QVC infomercial for the eroto-psychedelic effects of ecstasy \u2013 \u201cLotions of love flow through your hands / See visions, colours every day\u201d \u2013 and the music is shamelessly designed to intensify drug experiences. The junglist breakbeats keep the energy high, while the big piano chords and yearning vocals are like a head massage from some bloke you just met but nevertheless now feel a deeper kinship with than your immediate family.

But the Hammond organ creates a valedictory mood as the drug epiphanies betray their lies \u2013 \u201cAlthough my eyes were open / They might have just as well\u2019ve been closed\u201d \u2013 and the entitlement and rapacity of the now widely hated Worst Generation becomes clear: \u201cI was feeling kinda seasick / But the crowd called out for more.\u201d A funeral hymn, then, but no less beautiful for it.

Young negotiates the middle eight\u2019s key changes with the same sad certainty he negotiates his emotions, choosing self-preservation over a second chance at love. BBT\n\n73\n\nChicago \u2013 If You Leave Me Now (1976)\n\nThe softest of soft rock, If You Leave Me Now doesn\u2019t seem to play so much as glide along, wrapped in a blanket of French horns and strings, the drummer tapping so gently it sounds as if he\u2019s trying not to wake someone up. It\u2019s impossibly lush and beautifully written, but its sadness is pervasive and affecting.

Its \u201cFuck you, I won\u2019t do what you tell me\u201d climax, aimed at authority figures from the police to parents for years, was gleefully beamed at Simon Cowell in a great moment for British democracy.

But it was: in two minutes, 53 seconds, these five women undid tween pop\u2019s raison d\u2019etre \u2013 seducing girls into a life of domesticity via parades of harmless male crushes \u2013 and rewrote it in their own chaotic, girls-first spirit. LS\n\n70\n\nRui Da Silva \u2013 Touch Me (feat Cassandra) (2001)\n\nDance music No 1s almost always bang, but this one pumps: a deep-house anthem of huge subtlety and power. The way the rhythm-guitar line insinuates itself, only to be subsumed by those cut-up strings, mirrors Cassandra\u2019s audible bafflement at being taken over by a love she doesn\u2019t understand. The confusing rush of ecstasy, in every sense, has never been so beautifully evoked. BBT\n\n69\n\nDance-pop in the 90s often traded in profound melancholy \u2013 Haddaway\u2019s What Is Love and Corona\u2019s Rhythm of the Night being other classic examples \u2013 and Rhythm Is a Dancer is one of the saddest of all. With its gospel vocals and cathedral-ready chords, it makes raving feel like a serious spiritual quest rather than something to do on a Friday.

Photograph: Brian Cooke/Redferns\n\n68\n\nDexys Midnight Runners \u2013 Come on Eileen (1982)\n\nPop holds few greater pleasures than seeing a pop song about the power of pop songs take on that kind of lure itself. In Come on Eileen, Kevin Rowland reflects on the sad songs beloved by a downtrodden generation and promises his crush they\u2019ll hum a different tune. Come on Eileen became that song: a romp through wistfulness, bonhomie and knees-up antics that distils the riotous emotional arc of a night in an Irish pub into three-and-a-half perfect minutes. LS\n\n67\n\nBlack Box \u2013 Ride on Time (1989)\n\nMatching disco diva Loleatta Holloway for lung power is near impossible but M People\u2019s Heather Small \u2013 working incognito after Italian producers Black Box were refused a Holloway sample \u2013 blows the house down, and her \u201clet me tell you, what you do to me\u201d is so sexily intense. This is a Terminator of a song, unstoppably delivering a payload of pure euphoria as Chicago house is spliced with Italo disco to create perfect pop. BBT\n\n66\n\nIt\u2019s testament to time\u2019s steady erosion that a song about an obsessive fan who murdered his pregnant girlfriend and killed himself because his favourite rapper didn\u2019t notice him has become a casual byword for effusive devotion. Coming full circle, Stan is worthy of it. It\u2019s the peak of Eminem\u2019s storytelling skill and \u2013 in spite of the clear misanthropy of the titular fan \u2013 profoundly empathetic, as Eminem tempers Stan\u2019s violence by understanding the desperation fuels it.

Photograph: Shinko Music/Getty Images\n\n65\n\nKraftwerk \u2013 The Model (1982)\n\nA depressing economy of sex and power, observed with simmering beta-male jealousy, is sketched in just 12 lines over a melody that has the perfect symmetry of a model\u2019s face. Computer Love, the exquisite other half of this double A-side, is another portrait of loneliness but couldn\u2019t be more different: it is tender and naively yearning. BBT\n\n64\n\nNena \u2013 99 Red Balloons (1984)\n\nToo often discarded as a novelty hit, 99 Red Balloons is the best pop song about cold war anxiety in a field full of try-hard duds, and a chart-topping coronation for the tough, peppy new wave sound being pioneered by the Go-Go\u2019s, the Bangles and the Waitresses. (The original German version is still the best, however.)

AP\n\n62\n\nElvis Presley \u2013 Jailhouse Rock (1958)\n\nJailhouse Rock was intended as a joke by writers Leiber and Stoller, complete with a nudging reference to gay sex. Elvis, however, ignored the comic undercurrent, and sang it with such blazing intensity that the performance almost collapses at 1:14. If you want a No 1 that captures his early, feral power, this is it. AP\n\nDancefloor dreaming \u2026 The Arctic Monkeys. Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer\n\n61\n\nArctic Monkeys \u2013 I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor (2005)\n\nMost mid-00s indie nostalgia is tinged with shame: the polka dots, bad fringes and herky-jerky dancing have not dated well. But Arctic Monkeys\u2019 debut single proper is something to look back on with pride \u2013 not because, as the NME of the era would have it, it represented any kind of jingoistic \u201cvictory\u201d for indie over pop, but because its rattling potency and Alex Turner\u2019s lyrics distil the pleasures of that era worth remembering: \u201cJust bangin\u2019 tunes and DJ sets and / Dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness.\u201d LS\n\n60\n\nAriana Grande \u2013 Thank U, Next (2018)\n\nAfter all that Ariana Grande had been through \u2013 the Manchester Arena bombing, the death of a beloved ex, a broken engagement \u2013 she could have released 10 minutes of primal screaming and still left critics saying: yeah, fair enough. Instead, she changed the game: after the more stateswomanly Sweetener album released earlier that year, surprise return Thank U, Next accelerated pop\u2019s processing speed (particularly liberating female pop stars in the process) and quashed the idea that empowerment is contingent on taking someone else down. Its nimbleness is the sound of Grande\u2019s freedom. LS\n\nMaking it easy \u2026 the Walker Brothers.

The way the choir, timpani, strings, horns, guitars and more all stay meringue-fluffy is arranger Ivor Raymonde just showing off, really. BBT\n\n58\n\nOriginally written for Britney Spears, although it\u2019s inconceivable to imagine her doing it. Umbrella needs swagger and Rihanna had it in spades, turning a stunted beat and a lyric that\u2019s pretty dorky on paper into one of pop\u2019s great come-ons. It\u2019s a skill that earned Rihanna a deserved place in the pantheon of pop icons.

After a labour-intensive recording process featuring endless harmonising and dozens of feet of tape loops, 10cc came away with this work of stubborn beauty: a sublime, shimmering evocation of the ineffable bond between two lovers. It endures in every sense: Stewart and Gloria have been married for more than 50 years. LS\n\nA masterpiece single \u2026 Aaliyah.

Into the producer\u2019s serpentine frameworks stepped a woman whose calm, exacting poise let you come to her rather than she to you. It never gets less wrenching to think what else she might have done. BBT\n\n55\n\nAh, the song of the summer. Its lustre has been dulled by it being played by every wedding band in the western hemisphere (and by Limmy\u2019s eternally funny tweet), but Get Lucky still shines underneath it all.

Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/Alamy Stock Photo\n\n54\n\ntATu \u2013 All the Things She Said (2003)\n\nOn one hand, All the Things She Said is the ne plus ultra of queerbaiting: two straight Russian teenagers cajoled into lesbian cosplay by some dodgy-sounding svengalis. But as ersatz as their ardour was, the duo\u2019s debut UK single was charged with a perfect evocation of the frantic emotional tumult that rages in every closeted, yearning teenager\u2019s head. An industrial cri de c\u0153ur with a brilliantly desperate synth climax, it was the greatest Trevor Horn banger since his mid-80s sweet spot. LS\n\n53\n\nTake That \u2013 Back for Good (1995)\n\nThe boy band \u2013 well, Gary Barlow \u2013 had already shown they could do serious and affecting balladry with A Million Love Songs, and then they perfectly honed that skill for this classic breakup song. There\u2019s real poetry in the verses, which gives way to the devastating plainness of the chorus, like 100 red roses left at a doorstep. Barlow goes for total abasement, though \u2013 \u201cWhenever I\u2019m wrong / Just tell me the song and I\u2019ll sing it\u201d \u2013 so you don\u2019t really fancy his chances. BBT\n\n52\n\nSoft Cell \u2013 Tainted Love (1981)\n\nYou might think using crisp drum machines and eerie synths to cover a northern soul anthem would make it more brittle, but Soft Cell\u2019s version of Gloria Jones\u2019s 1964 song actually has more swing and sensuality. There\u2019s something portentous about those insistent, fateful synth stabs, and Marc Almond adds to the sense of doom with his innate flair for drama. BBT\n\n51\n\nTo watch Top of the Pops as 1987 gives way to 1988 is to watch the freaks taking over the asylum: after MARRS and Bomb the Bass\u2019s earlier acid house hits, S-Express\u2019s sample-heavy track affirmed the sound\u2019s chart coronation, making the Stock Aitken Waterman stable look even more square, and stuck one in the eye of London\u2019s throttlingly cool club scene with its euphoric, queer collage.

Other early house hits had at least come with a song or a hook attached, but this had neither: it may be the most minimal No 1 of all time. It isn\u2019t by any stretch of the imagination the best Chicago had to offer in 1987: as a signal of a vast shift in the way pop music sounded, it\u2019s unbeatable.

From its opening wall of drums to Quatro\u2019s scream of \u201cscratch out her eyes\u201d to its lyrically baffling but indelible chorus, Can the Can is glam-pop perfection.

While Blondie came from the genre\u2019s first wave in New York, their 1979 hit mainlined European electronic pioneers Kraftwerk and Heart of Glass in its brilliant, cycling riff, while Debbie Harry\u2019s rhapsodic vocals owed more to Donna Summer (whose I Feel Love the group had been covering), with a twist of downtown irony.

Which is what, it\u2019s easy to imagine, gave it the edge over Wizzard\u2019s dementedly cheery I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday, the loser in what\u2019s now considered the original festive chart battle, though it cemented glam as the official sound of Christmas.

Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic\n\n32\n\nBritney Spears \u2013 \u2026 Baby One More Time (1999)\n\n\u2026 Baby One More Time wasn\u2019t the first hit from Denniz Pop and Max Martin\u2019s Cheiron Studios \u2013 Backstreet Boys and Robyn predated Britney. But the Louisiana 16-year-old was to Cheiron what Kylie was to Stock Aitken Waterman: the first act with the personality to overwhelm the blueprint (Euro melodies, metal\u2019s impact and club-pop\u2019s sparkle) and make it her own. Rockists accuse Britney Spears of being an empty vessel, but it\u2019s her vocal DNA that shapes every single word of this song into a pop landmark. LS\n\n31\n\nAlthea and Donna \u2013 Uptown Top Ranking (1977)\n\n\u201cNah pop nah style,\u201d sang Althea and Donna, and they had a point. What\u2019s striking about the greatest reggae No 1 of all is how unvarnished its repurposing of an old Alton Ellis it is, the lack of concession to white ears as Althea and Donna riff on the lyrics of Trinity\u2019s Three Piece Suit with blank-eyed teenage insouciance. AP\n\n30\n\nMadonna \u2013 Vogue (1990)\n\nOf Madonna\u2019s 13 No 1s, Vogue is her most poised, agile and sexually intoxicating. It is a portal into a world of glamour \u2013 the litany of classic Hollywood in the middle eight, but also the world of peacocking ballroom culture it was borne from \u2013 where you find Madonna herself presiding over the decadence with her commands and observations. Get up on the dancefloor, indeed. BBT\n\n29\n\nWhitney Houston \u2013 I Wanna Dance With Somebody (1987)\n\nA masterpiece of synthetic production: the gorgeously wrong approximations of horns, bass guitar and piano have their own delirious beauty. But, of course, it\u2019s Whitney who seals it. That final chorus line, \u201cwith somebody who loves me\u201d, is so emphatic in knowing she deserves happiness, creating a paradoxically euphoric song about being lonely. BBT\n\n28\n\nThe Kinks \u2013 You Really Got Me (1964)\n\nThe arrival of You Really Got Me amid the still relatively mild No 1s of the time must have been startling \u2013 it even makes the Beatles sound like squares. One of the all time great riffs, made from only two notes, powers the garage-band energy as the group\u2019s lust builds to a ferocious head. BBT\n\nSoulful \u2026 George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley of Wham! Photograph: Michael Putland/Getty Images\n\n27\n\nGeorge Michael \u2013 Careless Whisper (1984)\n\nJust imagine this being the third song you\u2019d ever written as a band, turning a litany of silly teenage crushes into one of the all-time great ballads (and home to the most arresting sax solo since Gerry Rafferty\u2019s Baker Street). It wasn\u2019t Wham!\u2019s third single \u2013 George Michael astutely parcelled it out later, asserting his soulful, songwriterly bona fides after a raft of more cartoonish hits, and paving the way for a different shade of solo career. LS\n\n26\n\nSneering attitude and glowering negativity \u2013 provoked by everything from radio DJs to TV advertising to a lady declining to have sex with Mick Jagger because she\u2019s on her period \u2013 aligned to the most famous guitar riff in history. Satisfaction is pissed off, provocative, dirty, thrilling; everything great about the mid-60s Rolling Stones condensed into 3 minutes and 45 seconds. AP\n\n25\n\nBee Gees \u2013 Night Fever (1978)\n\nFortysomething years on, the opprobrium occasioned by the late-70s Bee Gees seems utterly baffling: the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack sounds like a masterclass in pop songwriting, as evidenced by Night Fever\u2019s perfect evocation of pre-club anticipation: \u201cOn the waves of the air / There is dancing out there \u2026 We can steal it.\u201d AP\n\nWedding-night blues \u2026 Freda Payne. Photograph: Ron Howard/Redferns\n\n24\n\nFreda Payne \u2013 Band of Gold (1970)\n\nWritten by Motown brains trust Holland-Dozier-Holland, Band of Gold sees Payne sitting in a lonely bedroom, her wedding night gone disastrously unconsummated after some kind of freak-out by the groom. Although the exact details are tactfully veiled by Payne, it\u2019s an unforgettably specific scenario, its horror hammered into your mind with that unyielding snare rhythm and told via a wondrous vocal line. BBT\n\n23\n\nThe KLF \u2013 3am Eternal (1991)\n\nJimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond had already written a book on how to have a No 1 record, The Manual, after their novelty chart-topper Doctorin\u2019 the Tardis. As the KLF, they brought every one of their tricks to bear on this titanic piece of rave: hip-house rapping, gospel choirs, chants about an ancient race of people and a huge synthetic guitar riff. What on earth was it on about? The mystery was the final key to its success. BBT\n\n22\n\nGeorge McCrae \u2013 Rock Your Baby (1974)\n\nOstensibly the first disco No 1 and the product of songwriters Harry Casey and Richard Finch observing what worked on the dancefloors of Miami\u2019s clubs, in truth, Rock Your Baby carved out a shimmering, supple musical space entirely of its own: organ-led, Hi Records-esque Memphis soul, complete with imploring falsetto vocal, over the hissy ticking of a primitive drum machine. AP\n\nImperious-sounding \u2026 T Rex in 1971. Photograph: Araldo Di Crollalanza/Rex Features\n\n21\n\nT Rex \u2013 Get It On (1971)\n\nAny of T Rex\u2019s magisterial run of No 1 singles could be in this list, but Get It On just shades it, by dint of being the most imperious sounding of the lot: the earthy R&B of Chuck Berry recast into a defiantly modern shape, sexually charged in a way no teen pop had previously been. AP\n\n20\n\nCarly Rae Jepsen \u2013 Call Me Maybe (2012)\n\nOn first listen, the song seemed deceptively featherweight. The strings sound like ringtones; the guitar parts as though they were lifted from a PlayStation 2 game. But even the most synthetic production can\u2019t detract from songwriting this ironclad. It is telling that Call Me Maybe was intended as a folk song; it would be catchy played on a kazoo, or underwater. Read our full review here. Elle Hunt\n\nUnstoppable \u2026 Lil Nas X performs at the Grammys in January. Photograph: John Shearer/Getty Images for the Recording Academy\n\n19\n\nLil Nas X \u2013 Old Town Road (remix feat Billy Ray Cyrus) (2019)\n\nOld Town Road was unstoppable, with no apparent end to its appeal. Children rioted in their love for it. Its vast stable of remixes made it a genre-splicing Rosetta stone. But as much as the song is an urtext in how to go viral (until the rules change again), Old Town\u2019s Road\u2019s magic lies in its affirming faith that a sunnier future is just around the next bend, designer Stetson optional. Read our full review here. Owen Myers\n\n18\n\nIan Dury & the Blockheads \u2013 Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick (1979)\n\nDury told chatshow host Michael Parkinson that he wanted his success to dispel society\u2019s discomfort with and patronising attitudes to disability and provide hope to those for whom things hadn\u2019t turned out so well. Today, his best-known tune still sounds fresh and wonderfully off-kilter, a beacon of pop\u2019s ability to embrace oddity and celebrate the other. Read our full review here. Dave Simpson\n\n17\n\nKylie Minogue \u2013 Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head (2001)\n\nThis was always a Kylie classic in the making. Blessed with the perfect pop voice, she delivers each line with just enough blank space for the listener\u2019s own interpretations. Is it about a crush? A recent heartbreak? Does the person Minogue is singing about know about the obsession? What is the dark secret she is harbouring? Even those famous \u201cla, la, las\u201d take on several functions, catalysing an irresistible earworm, a delirious, dancefloor-ready singalong moment and a distraction mechanism for the recently brokenhearted.

Photograph: Alastair Grant/AP\n\n16\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Crazy in Love (2003)\n\nThe announcement of her arrival via those unforgettable blaring horns, sampled from the Chi-Lites\u2019 1970 hit Are You My Woman? (Tell Me So), erred on regal fanfare, inspiring endless struts across makeshift dancefloors-turned-catwalks to this day. Beyonc\u00e9 was auditioning for the part of pop\u2019s new reigning diva, a role she knew she had already secured. Read our full review here. Yomi Adegoke\n\n15\n\nJerry Lee Lewis \u2013 Great Balls of Fire (1957)\n\nJerry Lee still sounds more lascivious than almost anyone. The sensations simply spill out of him \u2013 not only his voice but also his piano playing, too, his right hand sliding down the keys in exhalations of delight. It was the devil\u2019s music, but Great Balls of Fire still sounds like an act of God. Read our full review here. Michael Hann\n\nIndividuality \u2026 Kate Bush.\n\n14\n\nKate Bush \u2013 Wuthering Heights (1978)\n\nThe piano gently heralds the arrival of this haunted tale of lost love and longing, then that tight, high melody reels you in. It loops and lilts, ascending, descending, as Bush\u2019s vocal urges the story on, like Catherine striding across the moors. Wuthering Heights turned Bush into a pop star, the rules of which she continues to bend to her own will: her individuality was set in stone from the very beginning. Read our full review here. Rebecca Nicholson\n\n13\n\nFrankie Goes to Hollywood \u2013 Relax (1984)\n\nWith not only its flagrant innuendo, but its wide-open synths, and swooning, psychedelic disco structure, the song was a complete wildcard \u2013 and the band performing it even more so. At a pivotal, deeply conservative time in Britain\u2019s history, their crowning glory was what they brought out of the shadows and thrust into the light. Read our full review here. Aimee Cliff\n\n12\n\nSin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor \u2013 Nothing Compares 2 U (1990)\n\nBy drawing out the emotional weight that eluded its creator, O\u2019Connor fashioned one of the all-time great cover versions. Time has only cemented Nothing Compares 2 U\u2019s place in the pop pantheon \u2013 three decades on, this haunting, heart-wrenching evocation of the grief of lost love remains peerless.

Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\n11\n\nThe Beach Boys \u2013 Good Vibrations (1966)\n\nGood Vibrations was at once the mumbled inarticulacy and heightened feelings of love, but also the sound of a culture changing \u2013 almost in real time. In this collision of sound and sentiment, Wilson and his bandmates succeeded in capturing the moment when everything we thought we knew about pop songs dissolved. Read our full review here. Laura Barton\n\n10\n\nMarvin Gaye \u2013 Heard It Through the Grapevine (1968)\n\nHere, Gaye would establish himself as the bad boy of Motown, both a figurehead for rising anti-Vietnam sentiment and archetype of the socially conscious songwriter. With I Heard It Through the Grapevine, we find him stepping out into his independence, all potential buoyed on by the force of his first creation. Read our full review here. Ammar Kalia\n\n9\n\nAbba \u2013 Dancing Queen (1976)\n\nIt takes 18 seconds for Dancing Queen to drop into one of the greatest moments in pop. It speaks volumes that the 18 seconds preceding it are pretty wonderful too: that song bursting into life on that impossibly joyous piano glissando, before eight bars of sparkling, effortless mid-tempo pop. Dancing Queen reminds us that having the time of our lives is something that\u2019s always there, and that\u2019s always possible. Read our full review here. Jude Rogers\n\nKeith Flint performing with the Prodigy in 1996. Photograph: Brian Rasic/Getty Images\n\n8\n\nThe Prodigy \u2013 Firestarter (1996)\n\nFirestarter proved that the Prodigy was a squirming, sweating, flesh-bound beast \u2013 the very opposite of the futuristic \u201cbraindance\u201d coming from the electronic vanguard. It was pure boiling animus, doused in petrol and set off to ruin someone\u2019s birthday party. Read our full review here. Chal Ravens\n\n7\n\nThe Human League \u2013 Don\u2019t You Want Me (1981)\n\nDon\u2019t You Want Me stands as a shining example of what can happen when a bunch of relative amateurs with a point to prove and a keen aesthetic eye get down to work. And after all, part of the charm of the Human League and the moment they encapsulated, the experimentalism of post-punk meeting the new possibilities of electronic music technology, is that it was so refreshingly carefree, the sound of synth-pop coming in from the cold. Read our full review here. Luke Turner\n\n6\n\nMichael Jackson \u2013 Billie Jean (1983)\n\nBillie Jean reeks with the paranoia that came to dominate Jackson\u2019s career. It is a hunted, haunted song about a paternity claim, which forsakes the lushness of his earlier work for stark, neurotic future-funk. While Thriller\u2019s title track is cartoonishly scary, Billie Jean is authentically scared. Read our full review here. Dorian Lynskey\n\n5\n\nDead or Alive \u2013 You Spin Me Round (Like a Record) (1984)\n\nYou Spin Me Round (Like a Record) was secretly recorded while they were meant to be working on other songs. By the end of the 14-day session, the band and producers were reportedly \u201cready to murder\u201d each other. It took a 36-hour cocaine-fuelled marathon to finish the song, and 17 weeks for it to journey from No 79 to No 1. But there\u2019s a merciless, exacting energy to You Spin Me Round that would have got it over the line one way or another: it is taut, alien and utterly majestic. Read our full review here. Ben Beaumont-Thomas\n\nChanged the face of club music \u2026 Donna Summer. Photograph: Pictorial Press/Alamy\n\n4\n\nDonna Summer \u2013 I Feel Love (1977)\n\nNot only has I Feel Love never gone out of fashion, it has consistently jumped between genres in the intervening decades with incredible ease. In 1977, Brian Eno charged into the studio while David Bowie was recording, brandishing a copy of I Feel Love, and stated excitedly: \u201cThis is it, look no further. This is going to change the sound of club music for the next 15 years.\u201d His only mistake was one of gross under-exaggeration. Read our full review here. John Doran\n\n3\n\nThe Beatles \u2013 She Loves You (1963)\n\nTo hear She Loves You bursting out of a radio in the last week of August 1963 was to recognise a shout of triumph. Everything the Beatles had promised through the first half of the year found its focus in their fourth single, an explosion of exuberance that forced the world, not just their teenage fans, to acknowledge their existence. She Loves You presented an integrated whole, a sound of collective creativity that demolished the supremacy of solo artists, setting a trend that would dominate pop music for a generation. Read our full review here. Richard Williams\n\n2\n\nThe Specials \u2013 Ghost Town (1981)\n\nIt was the Specials\u2019 biggest hit and one of the biggest-selling singles of 1981. Its sound seems to presage a lot of subsequent music \u2013 you can hear its gloomy echoes everywhere from Massive Attack to Burial \u2013 but you almost never hear it on the radio or TV. Perhaps it\u2019s too bleak, too disturbing, its tone too hopeless: a reminder of something we\u2019d rather forget. It sits in the past, brooding and glowering at us, its remarkable, dark power undimmed. Read our full review here. Alexis Petridis\n\n1\n\nPet Shop Boys \u2013 West End Girls\n\nWest End Girls is a lens on to a glamorous demimonde. Primped young women and hungry young men meet in a corner of London that is starting to gentrify, although still seedy enough to expose the transactions behind the flirtation. You can almost hear their egos rattle as they use each other for sex and drugs, second-hand cool and sly oneupmanship. The result is perfect pop equilibrium that almost made Dusty Springfield crash her car the first time she heard it. Thirty-six years on, their debut single still pulses with beguiling ambiguity \u2013 a heady rush of lust, naivety, disco and opaque references to Lenin. Read the full review here.

On 4 April 1964, The Beatles (UK) matched this feat on the Billboard Hot 100 when they had the entire Top 5 with \"Can't Buy Me Love\" (No.1), \"Twist and Shout\" (No.2), \"She Loves You\" (No.3), \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" (No.4) and \"Please Please Me\" (No.5).\n\nSheeran smashed a number of Spotify records on the day \u00f7 was released (3 March 2017), including most first-day streams of an album (56,727,861, beating 29 million+ for The Weeknd's Starboy), most streams for an artist in 24 hours (68,695,172, beating The Weeknd's 40.3 million) and most streamed track in 24 hours (10 million+ for \"Shape of You\", beating the 7.24 million streams recorded by the same track on 9 January 2017).\n\nAll 16 tracks from the deluxe edition of \u00f7 crashed into Spotify's Global Top 50 streaming chart on 3 March, plus the Top 50 in 12 international markets (Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland and the UK).

Remarkably, \"Shape of You\" was in the Top 5 of all 52 global markets monitored by Spotify.\n\nBefore Sheeran's nine entries, Frankie Laine (UK) held the record for the most simultaneous hits in the UK Top 10.

On the chart dated 11 July 2009, Michael Jackson had 13 tracks in the Top 40 (five in the Top 20) following his death.

Some of pop's most successful stars have come from Wales, and with that in mind, we took a dive into the archives to see how many of them have managed to make it all the way to Number 1 on the Official Singles Chart.\n\nLooking for the full list of every UK Number 1 single by a Welsh artist? It's just a few scrolls away at the bottom of the page, but here are a few highlights:\n\nShirley Bassey\n\nThe legendary dame was the first Welsh artist to go to Number 1 back in 1958 with As I Love You, hitting the top for the second and final time to date three years later with Reach For The Stars/Climb Ev'ry Mountain in 1961. Surprisingly, Dame Shirley's iconic Bond themes Goldfinger, Moonraker and Diamonds are Forever didn't reach Number 1 \u2013 of them all, Goldfinger peaked highest at 21. Nevertheless, Dame Shirley has the most chart toppers of any Welsh female artist and has had a hugely successful career. She performed at Glastonbury in the rain in 2007 to a rapt crowd \u2013 in customised wellington boots of course!\n\nShakin' Stevens\n\nNot only did Shakin' Stevens record one of the most enduring Christmas Number 1s ever, he can also lay can also claim to hitting the top of the Official Singles Chart more than any other Welsh star. Real name Michael Barrett, Shaky has four Number 1s to his name: This Ole House and Green Door from 1981; 1982's Oh Julie; and not forgetting 1985's festive chart-topper, Merry Christmas Everyone.\n\nTom Jones\n\nYou know him now as The Voice UK coach and general grandaddy of Welsh music, but Sir Tom also has the distinction of having the best selling single by a Welsh artist. His 1966 Number 1 The Green, Green Grass of Home \u2013 it's a country cover, so it's not about Wales as such, but it sound like it could be, couldn't it? \u2013 has sold 1.26 million copies!\n\nBonnie Tyler\n\nBonnie hit the top on both sides of the Atlantic in 1983 with dramatic ballad Total Eclipse of the Heart, written by Meat Loaf's longtime collaborator Jim Steinman. She went on to have a Top 5 hit with Shakin' Stevens in 1985 on A Rockin' Good Way, and hit Number 2 in 1985 with Holding Out For a Hero. Bonnie represented the UK in the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest, finishing 19th.\n\n\n\nImage: Rolf Klatt/REX\n\nManic Street Preachers\n\nMost recent multiple chart-toppers \u2013 and one of the few bands on the list \u2013 Manic Street Preachers have two Number 1s, most recently 2000's The Masses Against the Classes.\n\nSian Evans\n\nRemember this banger? To date, Sian's featured slot on DJ Fresh's 2011 Number 1 Louder means that she is the most recent Welsh artist to hit the top spot. Sian is still singing and also acts as lead vocalist for electronic group Kosheen. This means we are long overdue another Welsh act at the top of the charts\u2026 will 2021 be the year it happens again?\n\nEvery Official UK Number 1 single by Welsh acts\n\n*bolded acts in collaborations are the Welsh musicians\n\nYEAR TITLE ARTIST 1958 AS I LOVE YOU SHIRLEY BASSEY 1960 TELL LAURA I LOVE HER RICKY VALANCE 1961 REACH FOR THE STARS/CLIMB EV'RY MOUNTAIN SHIRLEY BASSEY 1965 IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TOM JONES 1966 GREEN GREEN GRASS OF HOME TOM JONES 1968 THOSE WERE THE DAYS MARY HOPKIN 1969 (IF PARADISE IS) HALF AS NICE AMEN CORNER 1970 I HEAR YOU KNOCKING DAVE EDMUNDS 1981 THE OLE HOUSE SHAKIN' STEVENS 1981 GREEN DOOR SHAKIN' STEVENS 1982 OH JULIE SHAKIN' STEVENS 1983 TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE HEART BONNIE TYLER 1985 MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE SHAKIN' STEVENS 1998 IF YOU TOLERATE THIS YOUR CHILDREN WILL BE NEXT MANIC STREET PREACHERS 2000 THE MASSES AGAINST THE CLASSES MANIC STREET PREACHERS 2005 DAKOTA STEREOPHONICS 2008 MERCY DUFFY 2009 ISLANDS IN THE STREAM VANESSA JENKINS & BRYN WEST FT TOM JONES & ROBIN GIBB 2011 LOUDER DJ FRESH FT SIAN EVANS\n\n\u00a92021 Official Charts Company.

Even though his version stays true to the Tracy Chapman original, he really is thanking his foundational fans with this.\u201d\n\nThe song\u2019s crossover appeal is also evident in SiriusXM\u2019s support: Country channel The Highway is playing Combs\u2019 cover, as is pop-focused TikTok Radio.\n\nCombs isn\u2019t the first artist to gas up a charted rendition of \u201cFast Car.\u201d Jonas Blue\u2019s version, featuring Dakota, hit No. 7 on Hot Dance/Electronic Songs, as well as No. 98 on the Hot 100, in 2016.\n\nThose remakes mark the two that have hit the Hot 100 since Chapman took the original to No. 6 in August-September 1988. Until this week, the composition last ranked in the chart\u2019s top 40 (at No. 39) on the list dated that Oct. 1 (as Bobby McFerrin\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Worry, Be Happy\u201d breezed to a second week at No. 1).\n\nWhile country artists aren\u2019t exactly known for redoing pop hits, a few have charted highly since the late \u201880s. Rascal Flatts\u2019 repaved \u201cLife is a Highway\u201d reached No. 18 on Hot Country Songs in 2006, after Tom Cochrane\u2019s original hit No. 6 on the Hot 100 in 1992.\n\nAlabama\u2019s \u201cGod Must Have Spent a Little Time on You,\u201d featuring \u2018N Sync, hit No. 3 on Hot Country Songs in 1999, after \u2018N Sync\u2019s original reached No. 8 on the Hot 100 earlier that year.\n\nAround the same time, Mark Chesnutt scored his most recent of eight Hot Country Songs leaders with his version of Aerosmith\u2019s \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Miss a Thing\u201d in 1999. Aerosmith\u2019s recording of the Diane Warren-penned ballad debuted atop the Hot 100 and dominated for four frames in 1998.\n\nMeanwhile, in the mid-\u201890s, country artist John Michael Montgomery and pop/R&B vocal group All-4-One shared hits simultaneously: In 1994, \u201cI Swear\u201d was a Hot Country Songs No. 1 for the former and an 11-week No. 1 Hot 100 smash for the former. A year later, \u201cI Can Love You Like That\u201d became another Hot Country Songs No. 1 for Montgomery and a No. 5 Hot 100 hit for All-4-One.\n\nBack to the late \u201880s, Rosanne Cash\u2019s update of The Beatles\u2019 \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Spoil the Party\u201d became her most recent of 11 Hot Country Songs No. 1s, in 1989. The Lennon-McCartney original reached No. 39 on the Hot 100 for the Fab Four in 1965 (as the B-side of \u201cEight Days a Week,\u201d which hit No. 1)."}, {"url": "https://www.republicworld.com/sports-news/wwe-news/wwe-nxt-results-highlights-dakota-kai-wins-title-shot-adam-cole-hit.html", "page_content": "NXT Tag Team Champions Imperium defended their titles against the Undisputed Era in the main event of yet another action-packed NXT episode. With all eyes set on NXT Takeover: XXX, most of the storylines during the episode revolved around the flagship event. Rhea Ripley and Dakota Kai started things off with a fine match which was followed by some interesting segments and in-ring action. Here's a recap of the episode and the major segments that went down this week during WWE NXT:\n\nWWE NXT results\n\nDakota Kai beats Rhea Ripley to become No.1 contender for the NXT Women's Championship\n\nWith a chance to face the champ Io Shirai on the line, both women delivered a fantastic opening match to kickstart WWE NXT. Former NXT Women's champion, Rhea Ripley used her strength to her advantage to dominate the early proceedings of the match. The Australian continuously targetted Kai's back and kept punishing her with devastating chops.\n\nEventually, Dakota Kai was able to establish a strong foothold in the match and she even connected with a pump kick for a near fall. Rhea soon began dominating the match. And as soon as it appeared, Ripley would be heading to NXT Takeover: XXX to face Io Shirai, an interruption from Mercedes Martinez allowed Kai to hit the G2K for the three count.\n\nAlso Read | WWE News: 2 More Matches Announced For SummerSlam 2020\n\nDamian Priest vs Oney Lorcan vs Ridge Holland - NXT North American Title Ladder Match qualifier\n\nAnother match, with a title opportunity at stake, Damian Priest was left to face the agility of 205 star Oney Lorcan and the strength of NXT UK's Ridge Holland. Debutant Ridge Holland had a fine showing throughout the match, which could be WWE's way of hinting the UK's rising star would be a mainstay in NXT moving forward. At one point, Holland caught a diving Lorcan only to deliver a devastating T-Bone suplex for a near fall. However, it was Priest who snatched the win after he caught Holland with a sit-out chokeslam and finished Lorcan with the Reckoning for the pin.\n\nDamian Priest joins Dexter Lumis and Bronson Reed, who qualified earlier, in the NXT North American Championship Ladder Match at NXT TakeOver: XXX. However, an injury to Lumis caused him to be dropped from the match, meaning there are still three spots up for grabs in the Ladder match.\n\nAlso Read | WWE News: Hulk Hogan Opens Up On How He And \u2018Macho Man\u2019 Randy Savage Reconciled Before His Death\n\nImperium vs The Undisputed Era for the NXT Tag Team Championship\n\nFabian Aichner started the match for the champs while Kyle O'Reilly took the ring for the challengers. Aichner soon got the upper hand in the match after he connected a sweet Big Boot onto O'Reilly. Undisputed Era's Bobby Fish faced the same fate as he got taken out by a backbreaker from the Italian powerhouse. While both teams got the opportunity to trade blows as the match progressed, Imperium took the win after a ringside confusion allowed them to hit Fish with the European Bomb for the win.\n\nThe highlight of the main event was former NFL star, Pat McAfee, laid out the Undisputed Era's Adam Cole with his signature NFL punt kick. You can watch the confrontation below:\n\nWWE NXT results: Complete match card\n\nDakota Kai beat Rhea Ripley via pinfall to become the No.1 contender for the NXT Women's Championship\n\nBronson Reed beat Shane Thorne via pinfall to qualify for the NXT North American Title Ladder Match\n\nDamian Priest beat Oney Lorcan & Ridge Holland to qualify for the NXT North American Title Ladder Match\n\nNXT Champion Keith Lee beat Cameron Grimes via pinfall\n\nTegan Nox beat Indi Hartwell via pinfall\n\nImperium beat Undisputed Era via pinfall to retain the NXT Tag Team Championship\n\nElsewhere, NXT champ Keith Lee beat Cameron Grimes in a singles match. After the match, Karrion Kross appeared on the screen to send a strong message to the champ. Also, Legado Del Fantasma showed their dominance in NXT by a targetted attack on Breezango's Fandango.\n\nAlso Read | WWE RAW Results, Highlights: Shane McMahon Returns, Rollins Vs Dominik At SummerSlam\n\nAlso Read | Seth Rollins Thinks WWE's Women\u2019s Division \u201cLagging Behind\" Becky Lynch, Charlotte Flair\n\n(Image Credits: WWE Instagram Handle)"}, {"url": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/1996066/how-old-is-dakota-johnson-is-she-dating-chris-martin-who-are-her-parents-and-what-are-the-50-shades-of-grey-stars-hit-movies/", "page_content": "The actress and model is growing evermore popular in Hollywood as she continues to follow in the footsteps of her a-list parents\n\nDAKOTA Johnson was part of the entertainment industry before she was even born - and now she's standing out all on her own.\n\nHere's what you need to know about her career so far, as well as her deep connections to the Hollywood circuit...\n\n4 Dakota Johnson has shot to stardom thanks to Fifty Shades of Grey Credit: Getty Images - Getty\n\nWho is Dakota Johnson?\n\nDakota is the daughter of two Hollywood heavyweights - Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith.\n\nBorn October 4, 1989, Dakota is 29 years old.\n\nRaised in Aspen, Colorado, before moving to California, the star has worked as a model before becoming an actress.\n\nShe has six half-siblings - four from her dad's other relationships, and two from her mothers.\n\nAs her own career began to grow, she was named Miss Golden Globe in 2016.\n\n4 Dakota is the daughter of Melanie Griffith Credit: Getty Images - Getty\n\nWhat films would I have seen her in?\n\nDakota is most known for her role as Anastasia Steele in the film adaptation of E.L.
