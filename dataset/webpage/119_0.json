His father, Roy Beggs, was also a politician, having served as the UUP Member of Parliament (MP) for East Antrim from 1983 to 2005. Beggs Jr served as a local councillor on Carrickfergus Borough Council from 2001 to 2011, during which time he held various positions of responsibility, including Chairman of the District Policing Partnership and Vice-Chairman of the Local Strategic Partnership and of the Community Safety Partnership.\n\nIn 2011, Beggs was elected as Deputy Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, a role he held until 2016. During his time in the Assembly, he served as a member of various committees, including the Social Development Committee, Public Accounts Committee, Health Committee, Environment Committee, Finance Committee, and Agriculture Committee. He is also the UUP spokesperson on Social Development.\n\nBeggs is known for his actions in 2003, when he successfully lobbied Aer Lingus to remove Irish rebel music from their in-flight entertainment. Beggs had complained of the \"blatant promotion of militant, armed republicanism\" on a music channel during a flight from Dublin to Boston. He likened the situation to \"the speeches of Osama Bin Laden being played on a trans-Atlantic Arabian airline.\" Aer Lingus removed the material from their flights immediately, stating that it should never have been on board in the first place.\n\nThroughout his career, Beggs has been known for his commitment to public safety and community development. He has been a strong advocate for increasing funding for mental health services, improving road safety, and promoting economic development in Northern Ireland. He has also been a vocal opponent of political violence and sectarianism, and has worked tirelessly to build bridges between different communities in the region.\n\nOverall, Roy Beggs Jr is a well-respected politician with a long track record of public service. His dedication to the people of East Antrim and Northern Ireland as a whole has earned him the admiration of his constituents and colleagues alike. As he moves on from his role as an MLA, his legacy will continue to be felt throughout the region for many years to come.\n\nElection results\n\nRoy Beggs Jr, a seasoned politician and long-standing member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, suffered a shock defeat in the 2022 election at the hands of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland. This brought to an end his uninterrupted run of electoral successes since 1998.\n\nBeggs Jr had been a force to be reckoned with in the political landscape, having won the popular vote in two separate elections, and had been a key player in the Unionist cause for decades. However, his failure to secure re-election in 2022 has left many wondering where it all went wrong.\n\nDespite starting strong with a 16.1% share of the vote in 1998, Beggs Jr's popularity dwindled over time, with just 10.2% of the vote in 2007. While he had always been a prominent figure in Unionist politics, it seems that his appeal may have waned in recent years.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly is a notoriously volatile arena, with the political landscape shifting rapidly over time. Beggs Jr may have fallen foul of this instability, finding himself out of step with the changing attitudes of the electorate.\n\nOr perhaps it was simply a case of the Alliance Party capitalizing on a moment of weakness, seizing the opportunity to make their mark on the political landscape. Whatever the case, Beggs Jr's defeat is a timely reminder that no one can take electoral success for granted.\n\nIn the cutthroat world of politics, it's important to remain vigilant and adaptable, constantly reassessing one's position and staying on top of the latest trends and developments. Beggs Jr's defeat may be a bitter pill to swallow, but it serves as a valuable lesson for politicians everywhere.\n\nAs for the Alliance Party, they can take heart in their triumph, but they must not rest on their laurels. The political landscape is ever-changing, and they will need to remain vigilant if they hope to maintain their newfound dominance. One thing is certain, the Northern Ireland Assembly will remain a hotly contested arena for many years to come."}, {"url": "https://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2022/05/06/news/assembly-stalwarts-roy-beggs-and-peter-weir-lose-seats-2663430/", "page_content": "The UUP Roy Beggs lost his seat in East Antrim\n\nFor the first time since East Antrim was created as a constituency in 1983, there will nobody from the Beggs family representing the area at either Stormont or Westminster.\n\nUlster Unionist Roy Beggs Jr, a former Stormont deputy speaker and party stalwart, was eliminated early in the voting process for the constituency, which covers the coastal towns of Carrickfergus and Larne.\n\nMr Beggs had been his party's longest serving MLA, having held the seat since 1998.\n\nThe Beggs association with the area is longstanding, with Roy Beggs Sr having been the first MP when electoral boundaries were redrawn to form the constituency area in the early 1980s.\n\nMr Beggs polled only 3,549 first preference votes, well behind the 6,195 for his party colleague John Stewart.\n\nMr Beggs was eliminated on the second count and left the count centre at Ulster University in Jordanstown early.\n\nHis fortunes mirrored those of his party, which has suffered a disappointing election, gaining just over 11% of first preference votes.\n\nHe was not the only high-profile candidate to fall, with former education minister Peter Weir being eliminated in Strangford.\n\nMr Weir had been an MLA since 1998 when the Assembly was first created following the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nThe DUP previously held three seats in the constituency and was always likely to struggle to hold them all, with Mr Weir the casualty.\n\nWith counting continuing late on Friday, the possibility remained that other high-profile politicians could potentially lose their seats, with UUP leader Doug Beattie in Upper Bann, SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon in north Belfast and Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey all under pressure."}, {"url": "https://happyhappybirthday.net/en/age/roy-beggs-person_ffgquff", "page_content": "Roy Beggs\n\nBritish politician (born 1936) \u2013 Roy Beggs was born in Ballyclare (town in County Antrim, Northern Ireland) on February 20th, 1936 and is 87 years old today.\n\nAge How old is Roy Beggs? 87 Roy Beggs is 87 years old.\n\nBiographical data\n\nRoy Beggs\n\nBirthday When was Roy Beggs born?

He held the position until the 2005 general election when he was defeated by Sammy Wilson of the DUP.[6] He was UUP Education Spokesman from 1986 up to and including his last few years in Parliament when he also served as Deputy Leader and Chief Whip of the Ulster Unionist Parliamentary Party.[1]\n\nBeggs was known as one of the more hard-line members of the UUP, being vociferous in his Euroscepticism and his suspicions about the Belfast Agreement - initially involving himself in Union First (a group within the Ulster Unionist Party opposed to the Agreement), although in his final two years in Parliament he appeared publicly supportive of the Agreement and of leader David Trimble. A renowned opponent of \"progressive\" teaching methods and a supporter of maintaining Northern Ireland's grammar schools, he attacked proposals to abolish academic selection in post-primary education in Northern Ireland.\n\nBeggs was also a strong supporter of the Orange Order during their stand-off over Drumcree Church and in 1995 took part in a blockade of the port of Larne as part of a show of solidarity.

He complained of the \"Blatant promotion of opposing points of view\" on a music channel during a flight from Dublin to Boston after seeing that Derek Warfield had a radio channel dedicated to his music Beggs, it was the same as \"the speeches of Osama Bin Laden being played on a transport-Atlantic Arabian airline.\" Aer Lingus removed the material from their flights stating: \"lieutenant is something that should not have been on board and we removed it immediately we became aware of lieutenant\" Beggs Jnr has successfully contested every election for the Northern Ireland Assembly since 1998. In 1998 Beggs Jnr polled 16.1% of the popular vote. 16.7% in 2003. And 10.2% in 2007. Beggs Jnr topped the poll in 1998 and 2003 and the UUP returned two candidates. From 1998-2007 the Ulster Unionist Party have lost 8% vote share."}, {"url": "https://www.roybeggs.co.uk/", "page_content": "PLEASE NOTE: Mr Beggs is no longer a Member of the NI Assembly and the Election Campaign is underway.\n\nI attended my local Glynn Primary School and then Larne Grammar School.

You're 55 and married to Sandra (\"we're of a similar age\"), a former retail manager who now works as a part-time secretary in your constituency office. You have three children - Stewart (26), a dentist; Matthew (24), a civil engineer; and Amy (23), a final year dentistry student. You've been married for 28 years. How did you two meet?\n\nA. Our eyes met on the dance floor at a Young Farmers dance five years before we got married. We went to London and then Malta on honeymoon.\n\nQ. Your father and namesake Roy (81) is a retired school vice-principal and former East Antrim MP, and your (\"slightly younger\") mum Wilma was an administrator before focusing on running the family farm outside Larne. You also have a brother Ian (57), a qualified engineer who works on the farm, and two sisters - Roma (56), a physiotherapist, and Lorraine (53), a dentist. What was growing up like?\n\nA. We'd a happy childhood and we made our own innocent fun. We made tunnels through the hayshed, explored the wild Glynn river valley and returned with sticks which we used to make improvised pole vaults and we filled bran bags full of straw as a landing area. It was fun. I smile when I think about it.\n\nQ. How much influence has your dad had on your career?\n\nA. We have a similar outlook on many issues, but not all. Occasionally I've compared notes with him but the best advice he gave me was to decide for myself because I will have to satisfy myself in the long-term with the decision made.\n\nQ. You're in the rather unusual position of having received death threats from both loyalists opposing the peace process and dissident republicans. Tell us about that.\n\nA. In 1999 we were told there was going to be a hit on one Ulster Unionist MLA one particular weekend, and I was among those approached by police officers acting on specific information. On the other occasion, in the early 2000s, the police had found a list with my name on it...\n\nQ. In 2003 you succeeded in having Irish rebel music removed from Aer Lingus's in-flight entertainment. Was it a tough battle?\n\nA. I was on a flight from Dublin to Boston - at that stage the DUP wouldn't have flown through Dublin - and was surprised to hear music advocating the IRA. I simply asked: \"Would Arabian Airlines be playing music advocating Osama Bin Laden?\" The issue was resolved quickly. It's important that we don't glorify terrorism and do everything we can to prevent young people being drawn into organised crime gangs here.\n\nQ. You're considered to be one of the more hardline members of the UUP. Did your father's suspension from the DUP in 1981 and subsequent defection to the UUP influence your party choice? Was there ever a time you though you might go to the DUP?\n\nA. No, I feel much more at home with the UUP. Their approach to unionism, of reasonable accommodation with our neighbours, is the best method of guaranteeing Northern Ireland's position within the UK, rather than the 'them and us' approach of others.\n\nQ. Do you believe in God? Do you have a strong faith?\n\nA. I do. I was recently appointed as an elder in Raloo Presbyterian Church in Larne. I've also served as a Boys' Brigade officer there for 20 years.\n\nQ. Have you ever lost anyone else close to you, and does death frighten you?\n\nA. Grandparents. As a family we all would have been very close. Death doesn't frighten me - if you're prepared to meet your maker, what's to fear?\n\nQ. You like watching sport, cycling and taking long country walks with your family, and relaxing with the odd glass of red wine. You also used to love playing rugby. How do you relax outside politics?\n\nA. I also help my dad on the farm by way of keeping fit. Before work this morning, for example, I put a lot of silage into a wheelbarrow and fed the cattle with it.\n\nQ. You often hear about the dangers of working with animals. Have you had any close encounters?\n\nA. I've had to jump a gate to get out of a pen after being chased by a cow that had just calved. I was trying to help the calf get onto its first feed when its mother went for me, but I escaped unscathed.\n\nA mother of a young calf is more dangerous than a bull, and statistics prove that.\n\nQ. Have you had any bad experiences with the media?\n\nA. Peter Robinson once called me a \"loathsome creature\" in the Press when I backed David Trimble. That was my first real experience in politics of someone being nasty, but it says a lot more about Peter Robinson than it does about me.\n\nQ. Tell us about the best day of your life so far.\n\nA. My wedding day - October 20, 1989 - when my beautiful wife finally turned up after making me wait a while.\n\nQ. And what about the worst day of your life? What's the most traumatic thing you've been through?\n\nA. The day my son Stewart, who was four, broke his leg in an accident with a link box on the farm. I had to meet him at A&E before he was transferred to hospital.\n\nI remember spending a few nights in a chair at the side of his bed.\n\nHe was very young to be in hospital. He had an operation to have his leg re-set but initially we didn't know how serious it was going to be.\n\nMy dad almost lost his leg when he was in his 20s.\n\nHe was climbing a wall when the top of it fell on him.\n\nSurgeons were recommending amputation at one stage.\n\nQ. Which politician from the so-called 'other side' do you most admire?\n\nA. The SDLP's Mark H Durkan, for his wit.\n\nQ. As the son of a Westminster politician, did you ever foresee a time when there would be no Ulster Unionist MPs? And will there be any in the future?\n\nA. I wouldn't have foreseen that. The current impasse might well result in new political arrangements being made. I suspect the most damaging change has been the St Andrews Agreement, which has created the race to vote for one extreme or the other, which in turn has polarised political representation. Despite RHI and Nama, people believe they have to vote DUP to stop Sinn Fein getting in.\n\nQ. How do you feel about the current stalemate?\n\nA. I'm very frustrated, particularly when receiving complaints from constituents having to wait unreasonably long for health service treatment. There's a wide range of decisions that aren't being made, and we can't continue without ministers in post. There will either have to be devolved ministers appointed, or authority passed to direct rule.\n\nQ. Do you think being an MLA is easy money these days?\n\nA. We aren't doing the full job that we're elected to do and it's time for change.\n\nQ. What's the most important piece of advice you've been given?\n\nA. Decide for yourself, because you-have to live with the long-term consequences of your actions and decisions.\n\nDad gave that to me at a critical time in the peace process. He and I ended up taking different views on a vote prior to going into government in 1999. He had a more hardline approach than me. I ultimately decided to support Trimble in the establishment of the first Executive when IRA decommissioning hadn't yet taken place. We didn't fall out. I did so to apply pressure on Sinn Fein so they couldn't blame unionism for any collapse of the Assembly at that time.\n\nQ. If you were in trouble, who is the one person you would turn to?\n\nA. Probably my dad - and my wife.\n\nQ. Who was your biggest inspiration growing up?\n\nA. My dad. He was a strict disciplinarian; he was the enforcer at Larne High School. He worked hard and looked after us, and he was always very good in company. He knew a lot of people. He and mum are also fantastic dancers.\n\nQ. Who is your best Catholic friend?\n\nA. I was always taught to treat people as you find them. At school I played with a mixed group at lunchtime and on the school teams, as was the case when I played for the Firsts at Larne Rugby Club. We all worked together for whatever team we played on.\n\nQ. What's your favourite place?\n\nA. Castlerock. I had a wee touring caravan and most summers our family usually went there or Benone.\n\nQ. What is your greatest achievement to date?\n\nA. I developed a children and young people's group in Carrickfergus which ultimately was successful in establishing a Sure Start, helping mums and young children in parts of Carrickfergus and Larne.\n\nQ. Have you ever had a nickname?\n\nA. Beggsy\n\nQ. What's the craziest thing you've ever done?\n\nA. When I was 19 a group of us elected to go waterskiing in Newferry in December - which I did without a suitable wetsuit. I remember going for a run afterwards to get warmed up and then subsequently discovering I'd been running with a thorn in my heel, but because it was so cold I couldn't feel it.\n\nQ. You and Sandra live in Glenoe while Stewart works in London, Matthew is \"drilling tunnels under cities in Canada\" and Amy is currently studying in Dundee. You must miss them?\n\nA. I do. I hope they all come back at some point but they're adults and have to decide things for themselves. But it took a while getting used to all three being away.\n\nQ. You went to Glynn Primary and Larne Grammar before spending a year out on company placement and then heading to Queen's to study engineering. Briefly tell us about your career to date.\n\nA. Immediately prior to becoming an MLA I worked as a production manager for five years at (the now closed) Simms and Young.\n\nBefore that I worked for different manufacturing companies in production management.\n\nQ. You became involved in politics at university, joined the Young Unionists and served as secretary of the Ulster Young Unionist Council (UYUC). You were also constituency secretary at your local UUP branch. Was your dad a major influence in your decision to enter politics?\n\nA. There was always some politics discussed over the kitchen table, although I was the only family member actively involved - I helped my dad put up posters at election time.\n\nAt university I took part in the Young Unionist protest march against the Anglo-Irish Agreement from Londonderry to Belfast.\n\nI never made any political ambitions for myself but I originally thought at some point that I might become a councillor.\n\nQ. If the Assembly collapses, what's next for you?\n\nA. More time farming and I'll look for an engineering management role."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/roy-beggs-jr", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nRoy Beggs Jr was born on 3 July, 1962.

A strong supporter of maintaining Northern Ireland\"s grammar schools, he attacked proposals to abolish academic selection in post-primary education in Northern Ireland, whilst also opposing the introduction of tuition fees for university students claiming that the latter discouraged many from entering higher education. Beggs was also a strong supporter of the Orange Order during their stand-off over Drumcree Church and in 1995 took part in a blockade of the port of Larne as part of a show of solidarity. Beggs was charged with Public Order offences for his involvement and was fined \u00a31,350. In March 2001, he apologised in the House of Commons for failing to register a local business interest.

This also enabled me to highlight the vital Larne Line TENS Rail route.\n\nWhen I was an MLA, I was active on a number of All Party Assembly Groups: Chair of the All Party Assembly Group on the Community & Voluntary Sector; Member of the All Party Assembly Group for Children and Young People (chair 2007, 2008 + 2009); and Member of the All Party Construction Group.\n\nPolitically, I have concentrated largely on local constituency issues and \u2018bread and butter issues\u2019. I and my UUP colleagues helped to create a relatively stable Northern Ireland at peace with itself and its neighbours. Now we must concentrate on creating jobs in a sustainable economy with a responsive government for the benefit of all.\n\nI believe that Northern Ireland\u2019s place within the UK is best for all of us. The rights and well-being of everyone in NI can best be protected in a pluralist, tolerant United Kingdom in which everyone is respected."}, {"url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/east-antrim-result-alliance-gains-but-end-of-an-era-for-uup-1.4872542", "page_content": "The Alliance Party\u2019s Danny Donnelly (left) and Stewart Dickson celebrate after their election at Ulster University Jordanstown count centre.

However, these votes if cast in a six-seat STV election across the whole East Antrim constituency would be likely to give the DUP three seats, and the UUP and Alliance one each, with the last most likely to go to the UUP.\n\n2003 Assembly election (26 November; six seats)\n\n*Roy Beggs Jr (UUP) 5175 (16.7%)\n\n#Sammy Wilson (DUP) 4544 (14.7%)\n\nGeorge Dawson (DUP) 3163 (10.2%)\n\n*David Hilditch (DUP) 2856 (9.2%)\n\n*Daniel O'Connor (SDLP) 2428 (7.8%)\n\n*Sean Neeson (Alliance) 2180 (7.0%)\n\n*Ken Robinson (UUP) 2062 (6.7%)\n\nRoy McCune (UUP) 1646 (5.3%)\n\nJack McKee (Ind) 1449 (4.7%)\n\nStewart Dickson (Alliance) 1192 (3.9%)\n\n*Roger Hutchinson (Ind) 1011 (3.3 %)\n\nOliver McMullan (SF) 768 (2.5%)\n\nTom Robinson (UKUP) 564 (1.8%)\n\nCarolyn Howarth (PUP) 534 (1.7%)\n\nRobert Mason (Ind) 364 (1.2%)\n\nJohn Anderson (Ind) 348 (1.1%)\n\nAnne Monaghan (NIWC) 307 (1.0%)\n\nAlan Greer (Cons) 196 (0.6%)\n\nAndrew Frew (Green) 165 (0.5%) DUP 10,563 (34.1%, +11.9%) 3 seats\n\nUUP 8,883 (28.7%, -0.9%) 2 seats\n\nAlliance 3,372 (10.9%, -9.2%) 1 seat Best result for Alliance in Northern Ireland\n\nInds 3,172 (10.2%)\n\nSDLP 2,428 (7.8%, +1.9%)\n\nSF 768 (2.5%, +0.4%)\n\nUKUP 564 (1.8%, -6.2%)\n\nPUP 534 (1.7%, -2.3%)\n\nNIWC 307 (1.0%)\n\nCon 196 (0.6%, -0.1%)\n\nGreen 165 (0.5%) Electorate 55,473\n\nVotes cast 31,343 (56.5%); spoilt votes 391 (1.2%)\n\nValid votes 30,952; quota 4,422\n\n* Member of 1998-2003 Assembly for East Antrim\n\n# Member of 1998-2003 Assembly for East Belfast\n\nReaction: The DUP's vote management got them three seats, gaining from Roger Hutchinson and Daniel O'Connor, with the UUP and Alliance incumbents holding on. The final margin of Dawson over O'Connor was a substantial 796 votes, with Dawson's running mate only 14 votes ahead of him; the gap between them had never been as much as 300 votes. The UUP candidates had balanced even better, with never more than 66 votes separating Robinson and McCune, but the numbers weren't there and McCune was eventually eliminated.\n\n\n\nEast Antrim had lost 10.57% of its electorate in the great electoral register shake-out, varying from 17.96% in the Northland ward of Carrickfergus to 5.27% in Boneybefore, also in Carrickfergus. 10 constituencies lost fewer voters, 7 lost more.\n\n2001 Westminster Election (7 June; 1 seat)\n\nElectorate: 60,897; votes cast: 36,327 (59.6%); spoilt votes: 327 (0.9%)\n\nValid votes: 36,000; UUP majority 128\n\n* outgoing MP\n\n@ member of the Assembly\n\nThis result was a welcome relief to the UUP after several disappointing losses elsewhere, though the narrowness of the result was alarming. If this election had been for six seats to an Assembly, the DUP and UUP would each have won two, and Alliance one; the last seat would have been between a fifth Unionist and the SDLP.\n\n2001 Local Government Election (7 June)\n\nVotes cast in 2001 were as follows:\n\nDUP 10179.5 (29%)\n\nUUP 9280.1 (27%)\n\nAlliance 6219.5 (18%) Best equivalent result in Northern Ireland\n\nSDLP 1320 (4%)\n\nPUP 945.9 (3%)\n\nUUAP 555.9 (2%)\n\nSF 554.3 (2%)\n\nCommunity Candidates 218.2 (1%)\n\nNIUP 216 (1%)\n\nNewtownabbey Ratepayers Association 108.3 (1%)\n\nIndependents 5093.8 (14%)\n\nThese votes if cast in a six-seat STV election across the whole East Antrim constituency would have certainly have given the UUP and DUP two seats and Alliance one.

On the first count it was clear that the UKUP had probably done well enough to take a seat, which in itself was surprising. But as transfers continued, the SDLP candidate, who had started eighth, overtook candidates from first the UUP and then the DUP to take the final place, in an area where he was the SDLP's only local councillor, by 4191 votes to McKee's 4152, a margin of 49 votes, the closest of the whole election.\n\n1997 Local Government Election\n\nUUP 6758 (28%)\n\nDUP 4888.2 (20%)\n\nAlliance 4510.5 (19%)\n\nPUP 991.1 (4%)\n\nSDLP 409 (2%)\n\nLabour 274.7 (1%)\n\nUDP 232.7 (1%)\n\nUKUP 220.0 (1%)\n\nNewtownabbey Ratepayers Association 176.4 (1%)\n\nNorthern Ireland Labour 65.5 (0.27%)\n\nOthers 5,591.3 (23%)\n\nTotal valid 24,117.5 (41% of electorate)\n\n1997 Westminster Election (one seat)\n\n* outgoing MP\n\n\u0192 member of the Forum\n\n1996 Forum Election (five seats)\n\nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) 10,036 (30%); May Steele, Thomas Robinson elected\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) 9,557 (29%); Jack McKee, May Beattie elected\n\nAlliance Party of Northern Ireland (APNI) 3,957 (12%); Sean Neeson elected\n\nProgressive Unionist Party (PUP) 2,254 (7%)\n\nSocial Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) 2,213 (7%)\n\nUnited Kingdom Unionist Party (UKU) 2,041 (6%)\n\nUlster Democratic Party (UDP) 1,141 (3%)\n\nSinn F\u00e9in (SF) 619 (2%)\n\nNorthern Ireland Women's Coalition (NIWC) 323 (1%)\n\nConservative Party (Con) 271 (1%)\n\nGreen Party 224 (1%)\n\nLabour (Lab) 218 (1%)\n\nIndependent Democratic Unionist Party 107 (0.32%)\n\nDemocratic Partnership 102 (0.31%)\n\nUlster Independence Movement (UIM) 86 (0.26%)\n\nIndependent McMullan 81 (0.24%)\n\nWorkers Party (WP) 69 (0.21%)\n\nDemocratic Left (DL) 33 (0.10%)\n\nNatural Law Party (NLP) 14 (0.04%)\n\nIndependent Chambers 5 (0.01%)\n\nElectorate: 57,989; votes cast: 33,403 (57.6%); spoilt votes: 52 (0.1%); valid votes: 33,351\n\nMcKee and Neeson had both been elected to the 1982 Assembly for North Antrim.\n\nResults 1996-2007\n\n\n\nDUP UKUP UUP PUP Oth U Alliance Oth SDLP SF 2007a\n\n45% 2% 22%\n\n1% 16% 3% 6% 4% 2005w 50%\n\n27%\n\n\n\n15% 0% 5% 3% 2005lg 40%\n\n23% 1% 1% 17% 14% 4% 2% 2003a 34% 2% 29% 2% 9% 11% 4% 8% 2% 2001w 36%\n\n36%\n\n2% 12% 3% 7% 3% 2001lg 29%\n\n27% 3% 2% 18% 16% 4% 2% 1998a 22% 8% 30% 4% 7% 20% 1% 6% 2% 1997lg 20% 1% 28% 4% 1% 19% 25% 2%\n\n1997w 19%\n\n39% 5% 7% 20% 3% 5% 2% 1996f 29% 6% 30% 7% 5% 12% 3% 7% 2%\n\nSee also: Full 2003 results from East Antrim | Full 1998 results from East Antrim | The Boundary Commission's Provisional Recommendations | Boundary Commission 2003 | Jim Riley's analysis of votes and seats in the 1998 Assembly election | The constituencies\n\nOther sites based at ARK: ORB (Online Research Bank) | CAIN (Conflict Archive on the INternet) | Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey\n\nYour comments, please!
