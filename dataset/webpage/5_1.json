Having played a handful of T20Is, he found himself completely out of favour with the national selectors for four long years. He was eventually recalled to the national team during the home season of 2017 and promptly made an immediate impact, grabbing career-best figures of four for 47 against the visiting Zimbabweans.

Dananjaya picked up a five-wicket haul in the first innings of the Test match and later finished with a total of six wickets under his belt. He was subsequently reported by the match officials and underwent an independent assessment to check the legality of his bowling action in Chennai on August 29.\n\nThe assessment ruled out that Dananjaya's bowling action was illegal prompting ICC to hand him a 12-month ban.

He impressed the skipper with his performances and grabbed a place in the T20 squad for the ICC World T20 2012.\n\nThough Dananjaya has not had much success in international cricket, he has been in the headlines for his controversial action.

Virat Kohli-led India won the toss and opted to field first. The hosts managed to cobble up 237 runs, which didn\u2019t seem enough. India began the pursuit and was looking to score a runaway win. That is when India was reduced from 108 for 1 to 131 for 7 in no time. The match had turned on its head because of Akila Dananjaya. However, Sri Lanka did not go on to win the match despite being in a position of strength because of great commitment shown by Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Bhuvneshwar Kumar.\n\nBut Akila has announced himself at the world stage. So who is this mystery spinner who nearly polished off India at the blink of an eye?\n\nHere are five startling facts about the new mystery spinner in the block for Sri Lanka:\n\nInternational debut ahead of first class debut: That makes him unique as very few players have done this in the past. He was first spotted and selected for a T20I versus New Zealand, way back in 2012. A year later in 2013, he made his first-class debut for Colts Cricket Club against Ragama Cricket Club.\n\nMahela Jayawardena pushed his case: One of the most impactful batsmen from Sri Lanka, Mahela Jayawardena, was impressed by his set of skills and asked to push for his selection. He used to be a net bowler in the past. It was only on Jayawardena\u2019s request that he was selected for the ICC World T20 in 2012.\n\nA Chennai Super Kings man: Yes, you may not have seen him in the yellow jersey, but he was selected for CSK in 2013 auctions. He was sold for a base price of $20,000, which approximately sums up to Rs. 10.5 Lakh.\n\nThe ball struck on his face: In his debut match against New Zealand, on Akita\u2019s delivery, New Zealand batsman Rob Nicol hit the ball straight back at Akila, who could not react quickly and the ball went on to hit his face. His cheek bone was injured. That is what did not allow him to take further part in the tournament.\n\nAww..

Dananjaya made his international debut in a T20I against New Zealand, picking up two wickets in the spell. Consequently, he made his ODI debut against the same opposition.
