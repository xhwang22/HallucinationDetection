Those dreams became reality in 2012 when she got as close as she could get to advancing to the 100m breaststroke final in London, losing a swim-off for the eighth spot in the final to Jamaica\u2019s Alia Atkinson. Van Beilen also competed in the 200m breaststroke after winning the event at the Canadian Trials, knocking world record holder Annamay Pierse off the Canadian Olympic team in the process. Van Beilen had competed at the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010, winning three medals including gold in the 100m breaststroke. Her multi-sport competition experience includes the 2011 and 2013 Universiades, where she won a pair of silver medals in her first appearance. Van Beilen made her FINA World Championship debut in 2013. She has been part of four straight CIS championship teams with the UBC Thunderbirds.\n\nGETTING TO KNOW\u2026\n\nFamily: Parents Harry and Sharon Van Beilen\u2026 Older brother Nathan\u2026 Younger sister Marya\u2026 Uncle Wayne Van Dorp is a former NHL player\u2026 Cousin Joel Reinders is a CFL offensive lineman\u2026 Getting into the Sport: Learned to swim at age 5 in the backyard pool because she was a chubby child\u2026 Started swimming competitively at age 9\u2026 Was disqualified from her first meet for moving her toes\u2026 Outside Interests: Kinesiology major at the University of British Columbia\u2026 Enjoys baking and cooking\u2026 Played piano for 10 years\u2026 Odds and Ends: Nicknames: Teddy, TVB\u2026 Athlete ambassador for KidSport\u2026 Collects magnets during her travels\u2026 Favourite motto: Do my best, let God do the rest\u2026 Likes to eat yogurt-covered raisings before competing\u2026 Has a maple leaf tattoo on her toe, making it the last thing she sees before diving off the blocks\u2026\n\nINTERNATIONAL RESULTS\n\nFINA World Championships: 2013 \u2013 28th (100m breaststroke), 21st (200m breaststroke)\n\nYouth Olympic Games: 2010 \u2013 GOLD (100m breaststroke), SILVER (200m breaststroke), BRONZE (4x100m freestyle relay), 4th (4x100m medley relay)\n\nPan Pacific Championships: 2014 \u2013 12th (100m breaststroke), 12th (200m breaststroke)\n\nCommonwealth Games: 2014 \u2013 6th (100m breaststroke), 9th (200m breaststroke), BRONZE (4x100m medley relay)"}, {"url": "https://www.thestar.com/sports/olympics/2010/08/20/oakville_swimmer_adds_to_youth_olympics_medal_haul_with_silver.html", "page_content": "SINGAPORE\u2014Canada capped off the swim meet at the Youth Olympics with a silver medal on Friday.\n\nTera Van Beilen of Oakville finished second in the women\u2019s 200-metre breaststroke.\n\nThe eight-member Canadian swim team ends the meet with seven medals: two gold, a silver and four bronze.\n\nEmily Selig of Australia won the 200 breaststroke gold in two minutes 27.78 seconds.

Still I\u2019m not disappointed especially that Tera also got on the podium. It was a really close race and exciting for all of us.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Britain\u2019s David Bolarinwa and Jamaica\u2019s Odane Skeen won their qualifying heats in the 100 metres, setting up a much anticipated final between two sprinters touted as the next Usain Bolt.\n\nBolarinwa blew away the field in his heat, finishing in 10.62 seconds. Skeen got out slowly but surged to run 10.63 seconds to beat Thailand\u2019s Jirapong Meenapra.\n\nThe 17-year-old Bolarinwa has the fastest time this year among 16- and 17-year-olds \u2014 a 10.39 in London this month. Skeen, a 16-year-old whose lanky style has some likening him to his compatriot Bolt, ran a 10.46 in Jamaica.\n\n\u201cI thought let me go there, go hard and see if anyone can go faster,\u201d Bolarinwa said. \u201cIt was a good performance overall.\u201d\n\nSkeen was less thrilled with his performance, blaming his slower time on two false starts by other competitors. But he said come Saturday\u2019s final, he would win.\n\nBolarinwa and Skeen will face each other for the first time and are still sizing one another up. Skeen, for example, was surprised to hear that it was Bolarinwa and not himself who has run the fastest 100 this year. Marvin Bracy of the United States ran the second fastest but is not at the Games.\n\nOrganizers of the first Youth Olympics have emphasized participation rather than winning, but that was lost on Bolarinwa and Skeen, who both predicted they would win Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big showdown,\u201d Bolarinwa said. \u201cHe\u2019s not really a quick starter. We know that already,\u201d Bolarinwa said. \u201cHis pick up is fantastic and so is mine. If I get a good start, he\u2019ll have to take me.\u201d\n\nBolarinwa\u2019s coach John Powell chimed in later: \u201cBring it on.\u201d\n\nBoth boys seemed to relish the comparison to Bolt and their budding rivalry to that of Bolt and Tyson Gay. Told he has been compared to a miniature Bolt, Skeen just smiled and said he one day dreams of surpassing his idol.\n\n\u201cI want to be better than Bolt,\u201d said Skeen, whose goal it is to win gold at the 2012 Olympics in London. \u201cI want to be much more faster.\u201d\n\nBolarinwa enjoyed being likened to the two sprinting greats, but wants to surpass them.\n\n\u201cThese guys are fantastic. You look at what they have done. You want to be better than them,\u201d Bolarinwa said. \u201cBut it\u2019s good to have them in the back your mind to look up to.\u201d\n\nWatching Skeen\u2019s heat, Powell said he saw some of Bolt in Skeen. But he was quick to point out that a lot can change with an athlete by the time they reach adulthood. He noted that Bolt, for example, started out running 200- and 400-metre before exploding on the stage in the 100.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how they will develop, this is the thing,\u201d Powell said of Skeen. \u201cHe\u2019s about 16 and that is two or three years of formative years as an athlete. He could broaden out. He obviously has a good stride. If I looked at him \u2014 not that you can stereotype athletes these days \u2014 I\u2019d say he is a typical 200-metre runner.\u201d\n\nIn other action Wednesday, Lithuania rower Rolandas Mascinskas upset Germany\u2019s two-time world junior champion German Felix Bach to win the junior men\u2019s single sculls gold.\n\nIn the women\u2019s single sculls, Judith Sievers of Germany beat Nataliia Kovalova of Ukraine.
