She most recently played for Turbine Potsdam in the German Bundesliga and Seattle Reign FC of the National Women's Soccer League. Deines was a fourth round pick (23rd overall) of the Atlanta Beat of Women's Professional Soccer in the 2012 WPS Draft of college seniors on January 13, 2012. The WPS Board of Governors voted to suspend the 2012 season on January 30 citing pending legal issues. Subsequently, she was free to sign with other teams and rejoined the Seattle Sounders Women, the organization she had previously played for from 2007 to 2009. After the formation of the National Women's Soccer League in late 2012, Deines played for the Seattle Reign during the league's first two seasons. She was traded to FC Kansas City in late 2014 but announced her retirement from professional soccer on March 31, 2015, before the 2015 season began.\n\nEarly life\n\nDeines was born in Portland, Oregon, on September 17, 1989, to Matt and Betsy Deines. As a freshman at Issaquah High School, Deines helped lead the soccer team to its first state championship final since 1988 and first *le ever. Deines led the team to four consecutive conference championships from 2004 to 2007 and four state *le games, winning three of them. Issaquah's lone runner-up finish was in 2005 when Deines was forced to miss the championship game to join the United States Youth Soccer *ociation Olympic Development Program in Boca Raton, Florida following the semifinal. Issaquah went on undefeated the next two years with Deines in the lineup.\n\nDeines capped off her high school career by scoring the game-winning goal in the 71st minute of the 2007 state final, a 1\u20130 victory over Seattle Prep.\n\nDeines finished with a total of 76 goals and was named to the all-state team four times and chosen as the state's Gatorade Player of the Year twice. During her senior year she was named to the Parade and NSCAA/adidas Girls High School All-America teams.\n\nDeines has played soccer with the Seattle Sounders Women since joining the team in 2007 while still in high school.\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\nDeines was a four-year starter for the Washington Huskies, starting a school-record 86 games and scoring 21 goals. She was named to the Pac-10 All-Freshman First Team and was a four-time All-Pac-10 selection and a two-time NSCAA Scholar All-American.\n\nAs a freshman at the University of Washington, Deines helped the Huskies return to the NCAA Tournament after a three-year absence. She played a leading role as team captain during her junior year. She converted two key penalty kicks, including the game winner, during an epic penalty shoot-out in a shocking upset of the No. 2 overall seed University of Portland in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The Huskies would eventually go on to the Elite Eight where they were eliminated in an overtime loss at Boston College.\n\nPlaying career\n\nClub\n\nDrafted to the Atlanta Beat, 2012\n\nDeines was selected as a fourth round pick (23rd overall) by the Atlanta Beat in the 2012 WPS Draft of college seniors on January 13, 2012; however, the league suspended operations before play began.\n\nFrom Seattle to Iceland, 2012\n\nAfter the WPS folded in 2012, Deines signed with the Seattle Sounders Women. She made 12 appearances for the club, scoring one goal. Following the conclusion of the W-League season, Deines and her Sounders teammate and fellow University of Washington alum, Ver\u00f3nica P\u00e9rez, played for Stjarnan Women in Iceland's top division. The team won the Icelandic Women's Cup after a 1\u20130 win over Valur. Of her time in Iceland, Deines said, \"Even though it was a spur of the moment decision to play overseas in Iceland, I believe my three month stint helped in my development as a player. Icelandic soccer was not nearly as technical or tactical as soccer in the United States but the extreme physicality of our practices and games challenged me to play with a whole new level of aggression. Playing professionally in Iceland also allowed me an opportunity to keep practicing and playing games on a daily basis which would not have been the case if I would have stayed in the United States.\"\n\nSeattle Reign FC, 2013\u201314\n\nIn February 2013, Deines signed with the Seattle Reign FC as a free agent for the inaugural season of the NWSL.

She had her best year as a Husky as she was one of four players to play and start in all 24 games. She played midfield most of the season but started in the back line at the end of the year due to team injuries. She led the team in goals (9), points (19), game-winning goals (3), shot percentage (.265) and penalty kicks (3-3). She also had one assist, 34 shots and 18 shots on goal (.529 SOG %).

She most recently played for Turbine Potsdam in the German Bundesliga and Seattle Reign FC of the National Women's Soccer League. Deines was a fourth round pick (23rd overall) of the Atlanta Beat of Women's Professional Soccer in the 2012 WPS Draft of college seniors on January 13, 2012. The WPS Board of Governors voted to suspend the 2012 season on January 30 citing pending legal issues.[2] Subsequently, she was free to sign with other teams and rejoined the Seattle Sounders Women, the organization she had previously played for from 2007 to 2009. After the formation of the National Women's Soccer League in late 2012, Deines played for the Seattle Reign during the league's first two seasons. She was traded to FC Kansas City in late 2014[3] but announced her retirement from professional soccer on March 31, 2015, before the 2015 season began.[4]\n\nEarly life\n\nDeines was born in Portland, Oregon, on September 17, 1989, to Matt and Betsy Deines. As a freshman at Issaquah High School, Deines helped lead the soccer team to its first state championship final since 1988 and first title ever.[5] Deines led the team to four consecutive conference championships from 2004 to 2007 and four state title games, winning three of them.[6] Issaquah's lone runner-up finish was in 2005 when Deines was forced to miss the championship game to join the United States Youth Soccer Association Olympic Development Program in Boca Raton, Florida following the semifinal.[7] Issaquah went on undefeated the next two years with Deines in the lineup.\n\nDeines capped off her high school career by scoring the game-winning goal in the 71st minute of the 2007 state final, a 1\u20130 victory over Seattle Prep.[8]\n\nDeines finished with a total of 76 goals and was named to the all-state team four times and chosen as the state's Gatorade Player of the Year twice. During her senior year she was named to the Parade and NSCAA/adidas Girls High School All-America teams.[9]\n\nDeines has played soccer with the Seattle Sounders Women since joining the team in 2007 while still in high school.\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\nDeines was a four-year starter for the Washington Huskies, starting a school-record 86 games and scoring 21 goals.[10] She was named to the Pac-10 All-Freshman First Team and was a four-time All-Pac-10 selection and a two-time NSCAA Scholar All-American.[11]\n\nAs a freshman at the University of Washington, Deines helped the Huskies return to the NCAA Tournament after a three-year absence.[12] She played a leading role as team captain during her junior year. She converted two key penalty kicks, including the game winner, during an epic penalty shoot-out in a shocking upset of the No. 2 overall seed University of Portland in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.[13] The Huskies would eventually go on to the Elite Eight where they were eliminated in an overtime loss at Boston College.\n\nPlaying career\n\nClub\n\nDrafted to the Atlanta Beat, 2012\n\nDeines was selected as a fourth round pick (23rd overall) by the Atlanta Beat in the 2012 WPS Draft of college seniors on January 13, 2012; however, the league suspended operations before play began.[14][15]\n\nFrom Seattle to Iceland, 2012\n\nAfter the WPS folded in 2012, Deines signed with the Seattle Sounders Women. She made 12 appearances for the club, scoring one goal.[16] Following the conclusion of the W-League season, Deines and her Sounders teammate and fellow University of Washington alum, Ver\u00f3nica P\u00e9rez, played for Stjarnan Women in Iceland's top division. The team won the Icelandic Women's Cup after a 1\u20130 win over Valur.[17] Of her time in Iceland, Deines said, \"Even though it was a spur of the moment decision to play overseas in Iceland, I believe my three month stint helped in my development as a player. Icelandic soccer was not nearly as technical or tactical as soccer in the United States but the extreme physicality of our practices and games challenged me to play with a whole new level of aggression.
