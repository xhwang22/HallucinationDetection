The club paid Strasbourg a transfer fee of \u20ac3 million for his services. Gameiro was given the number 9 shirt and installed as the club's head striker. He made his club debut on 9 August 2008 playing the entire match in a 1\u20130 victory over Le Mans. Two weeks later, he scored his first goal for the club in a 3\u20131 defeat to Valenciennes. On 25 October, he contributed to Lorient's 3\u20130 rout of Brittany rivals Nantes. The following month, Gameiro scored goals in back-to-back matches on two occasions. Lorient went undefeated in the four matches. In the Coupe de France, Lorient reached the Round of 16. Gameiro scored goals against Alen\u00e7on and Tours in the Round of 64 and Round of 32, respectively. Gameiro continued his consistency during the spring portion of the season scoring goals against Sochaux, Grenoble, Marseille, and Nancy. Gameiro scored a double against the latter club. He finished the season with 39 total appearances and 13 goals. Lorient finished the season in 10th, tied for the club's highest finish ever in the first division.\n\nGameiro continued his rise in French football in the 2009\u201310 Ligue 1 season. He scored on his season debut on 8 August 2009 in a 2\u20131 win over Lille and converted another goal the following week against Montpellier in a 2\u20132 draw. A month later, he scored in back-to-back matches against Nancy and Grenoble as Lorient won both matches. Two weeks later, he scored in Lorient's 4\u20131 victory over Nice and, on 7 November, scored a double in the club's 5\u20130 thrashing of Boulogne.

The draw rose Lorient to 5th in the standings, the club's highest position that late in the season ever. On 27 January 2010, Gameiro scored the only goal in Lorient's upset victory over Lyon in the Coupe de la Ligue. Two weeks later, he scored in Lorient's 3\u20130 humiliation of Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes. The following week, Gameiro scored in a 1\u20131 draw with Toulouse. His consistent form prompted analysts to declare that Gameiro should be considered for the French national team, however, prior to the friendly against Spain on 3 March, Gameiro picked up an injury, which led to coach Raymond Domenech not considering him for the squad. Gameiro finished the 2009\u201310 campaign by scoring seven goals in the final nine league matches. He scored a brace against Saint-\u00c9tienne and converted opening goals in wins over Bordeaux, Grenoble, and Lille. In the six matches he scored in, Lorient won five and ultimately finished the campaign in 7th place; the club's highest finish in Ligue 1 ever.\n\nIn the 2010\u201311 season, Gameiro remained consistent.

Following the international break, Gameiro scored a goal in a 2\u20131 victory over Monaco. On 6 November, he scored both goals in a 2\u20131 win over Saint-\u00c9tienne. In December, he played a part in all three goals in the team's 6\u20133 loss to Lille. Gameiro scored the team's opening goal in the 7th minute, netted his second just before half-time, and assisted on Lynel Kitambala's in the second half. In January 2011, Gameiro was the subject of intense transfer speculation. On 4 January, it was reported that the striker had reached an agreement on a contract with Spanish club Valencia. Despite the reported agreement, Lorient president Lo\u00efc F\u00e9ry declared that while personal terms had been agreed, Valencia had never sent in a transfer fee offer for the player. Later in the month, French media reported that Lorient had accepted a bid from fellow Ligue 1 club Bordeaux. Bordeaux officials, however, revealed that Gameiro's preference was to play for Valencia. Ultimately, Gameiro remained with Lorient following the closure of the transfer window as Fery declared \"our priority has always been to keep Kevin with us\". Despite the speculation of a possible transfer, Gameiro remained potent on the field of play. Beginning in late January, he proceeded to go on a tear scoring seven goals in the team's four ensuing league matches. On 29 January, Gameiro scored both goals in a 2\u20130 win against Brest. In the next two weeks, he scored goals in a home win over Caen and an away defeat to Monaco. The impressive tally of goals culminated on 19 February 2011 when Gameiro scored a hat-trick in a 5\u20131 victory over Bordeaux.\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\nOn 10 June 2011, media reports confirmed that Paris Saint-Germain had reached an agreement with Lorient for the transfer of Gameiro. The striker had previously favored a move to either Paris Saint-Germain or Valencia. Two days later, following a successful medical, the transfer was confirmed by Paris Saint-Germain. Gameiro agreed to a four-year contract and the transfer fee was priced at \u20ac11 million with future bonuses to be added later. Gameiro made his competitive debut for Paris Saint-Germain on 6 August 2011 in the team's opening 1\u20130 league defeat to Lorient. The following week, he scored his first goal for the club in its 1\u20131 draw with Rennes. On 18 August 2011, in Paris Saint-Germain's first leg UEFA Europa League playoff round tie against Luxembourger club Differdange, Gameiro scored the opening goal for the team in a 4\u20130 away win. Three days later, he again scored a goal in a 2\u20131 win over Valenciennes helping Paris Saint-Germain earn its first league win of the season. In the team's next league match against Toulouse, Gameiro netted his third league goal in four matches. Paris Saint-Germain won the match 3\u20131.

Gameiro scored his first goal in 2013 against Toulouse FC, on 23 January, in Coupe de France play. Gameiro scored a notable assist when PSG squared off against Valencia CF in Champions League play, with Gameiro feeding Ezequiel Lavezzi for a 66th-minute goal, bequeathing PSG the aggregate victory. Gameiro's next goal came 29 March against Montpellier; 2013's final Gameiro goals were both scored against Gameiro's former outfit Lorient on 26 May. Given that Gameiro was transferred in the offseason, this occasion marked both his last scoring performance and last match for PSG.\n\nSevilla\n\nOn 25 July 2013, Gameiro signed a contract with Sevilla for a fee of \u20ac10 million, agreeing to a five-year deal for the Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n club.

In the final of the 2013\u201314 Europa League against Portuguese side Benfica on 14 May 2014, Gameiro came off the bench in extra time and scored the game-winning penalty kick to secure a 4\u20132 shoot-out victory for Sevilla.\n\nOn 24 October 2015, Gameiro netted a hat-trick in a 2015\u201316 La Liga home match against Getafe CF, in which Sevilla won 5\u20130, his first La Liga hat-trick.\n\nOn 18 May 2016, just 17 seconds into the second half of the 2016 UEFA Europa League Final against Liverpool, Gameiro scored Sevilla's equalizing goal a metre from the goal line after receiving a low cross from Mariano Ferreira Filho who had burst into the penalty box from the right. That was his eighth 2015-16 UEFA Europa League goal. Sevilla won the match 3\u20131 to become the first team to win the UEFA Cup/Europa League three times in a row. It was their fifth UEFA Cup/Europa League title overall.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico Madrid\n\nOn 30 July 2016, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid reached an agreement with Sevilla for the transfer of Gameiro on a four-year contract for a reported \u20ac32 million rising to \u20ac40 million with add-ons.\n\nOn 18th February 2017, Gameiro scored the fastest La Liga hat trick in over 22 years coming on a substitute against Sporting de Gij\u00f3n in a 4-1 victory.\n\nInternational career\n\nGameiro represented France internationally at the under-18, under-20, and under-21 levels. He made his under-18 debut on 29 October 2004 in a friendly match against Russia. Gameiro made his lone other appearance with the under-18 team in the return match against Russia two days later.

France lost the tie 2\u20131 on aggregate. The negative result ended Gameiro's under-21 career.\n\nIn August 2010, Gameiro was called up to the French senior team for the first time by new manager Laurent Blanc for the team's UEFA Euro 2012 qualification matches against Belarus and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

However, Gameiro downplayed the talk, stating that he \"didn't really have any links to the country\" and that he preferred to represent France.\n\nClub\n\nInternational\n\nHonours\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\nLigue 1: 2012\u201313\n\nSevilla\n\nUEFA Europa League: 2013\u201314, 2014\u201315, 2015\u201316\n\nIndividual\n\nUEFA Europa League Squad of the Season: 2015\u201316"}, {"url": "https://fbref.com/en/players/42276181/Kevin-Gameiro", "page_content": "About FBref.com\n\nFBref.com launched (June 13, 2018) with domestic league coverage for England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and United States.

Il commence sa carri\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9toile Sportive de Marly-la-Ville \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de six ans, club o\u00f9 son p\u00e8re a fini sa carri\u00e8re. Avant d'avoir 13 ans, il choisit de rester dans sa r\u00e9gion et rejoint l'US Chantilly. Gameiro est alors rep\u00e9r\u00e9 par Jacky Dugu\u00e9p\u00e9roux, qui lui recommande de jouer pour le RC Strasbourg. En 2004, il rejoint l'\u00e9quipe des jeunes du club alsacien.\n\nD\u00e9buts au RC Strasbourg (2005-2008) [ modifier | modifier le code ]\n\nIl joue son premier match professionnel le 10 septembre 2005 , \u00e0 18 ans et 4 mois, lors d'une d\u00e9faite 0-1 contre le Paris Saint-Germain. Pour sa premi\u00e8re titularisation, il inscrit un doubl\u00e9 en coupe UEFA face \u00e0 l'\u00c9toile rouge de Belgrade. Apr\u00e8s des d\u00e9buts tonitruants sous le maillot strasbourgeois, il est victime d'une rupture des ligaments crois\u00e9s \u00e0 la suite d'un tacle du joueur troyen Blaise Kouassi le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2006 . Cette blessure le tient \u00e9loign\u00e9 des terrains pendant six mois.\n\nLors de la saison 2007-2008, il participe \u00e0 la quasi-totalit\u00e9 des matches du RCS et inscrit six buts en championnat. Le Racing Club de Strasbourg est dans les derniers de Ligue 1 mais il joue bien et se fait mieux conna\u00eetre. Gameiro est alors l'un des \u00ab chouchous \u00bb de l'exigeant public du stade de la Meinau qui appr\u00e9cie sa constante d\u00e9bauche d'\u00e9nergie.\n\nAu mercato d'\u00e9t\u00e9 2008, le RC Strasbourg redescend en Ligue 2. Le jeune avant-centre est transf\u00e9r\u00e9 au FC Lorient, maintenu en Ligue 1. Le transfert s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 3 millions d'euros. \u00c0 Lorient, Gameiro ne tarde pas \u00e0 confirmer les espoirs plac\u00e9s en lui. Il devient vite l'un des atouts offensifs majeurs des Merlus, en inscrivant 11 buts et en d\u00e9livrant 8 passes d\u00e9cisives en 37 matches de L1. Lorient conna\u00eet des difficult\u00e9s mais finit bien au classement et Kevin Gameiro semble avoir fait un choix judicieux.\n\nLors de sa deuxi\u00e8me saison en Bretagne, Gameiro inscrit 17 buts en 34 matchs de L1, ce qui fait de lui le 2e meilleur buteur du championnat apr\u00e8s l'attaquant marseillais Mamadou Niang (18 buts).\n\nLe 20 d\u00e9cembre 2010 , il annonce son envie de quitter Lorient d\u00e8s l'hiver qui suit[1]. Suivi par les Girondins de Bordeaux[2], il avoue \u00eatre int\u00e9ress\u00e9 par ce challenge. Lorient serait pr\u00eat \u00e0 le laisser partir si le transfert se fait avec 12 millions d'euros. Le Valence CF a fait une offre inf\u00e9rieure (8 millions d'euros) pour s'attacher les services de ce joueur mais le club breton ne le laissera pas partir. Il termine la saison 2010-2011 en tant que second buteur du championnat avec 22 buts marqu\u00e9s. C'est son plus grand nombre de buts inscrits en une saison de Ligue 1. Plusieurs clubs fran\u00e7ais mais aussi \u00e9trangers cherchent \u00e0 le recruter pour la saison 2011-2012[3].\n\nGameiro sous les couleurs du PSG en 2011\n\nAlors courtis\u00e9 par plusieurs clubs tel que le Valence CF[4], K\u00e9vin signe au Paris Saint-Germain le 12 juin 2011 pour une dur\u00e9e de quatre ans. Le transfert avoisine les 14 millions d'euros plus divers bonus[5],[6]. Au PSG, il porte le num\u00e9ro 19. Lors de la 2e journ\u00e9e de la Ligue 1, il ouvre le score et son compteur but \u00e0 Rennes sur un centre de J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez (1-1). Il inscrit son premier tripl\u00e9 de la saison lors de la 10e journ\u00e9e de championnat lors d'une victoire trois buts \u00e0 z\u00e9ro contre l'AC Ajaccio[7],[8]. Sa premi\u00e8re moiti\u00e9 de saison est somme toute raisonnable avec un total de 10 buts inscrits \u00e0 la tr\u00eave. Cependant, avec le d\u00e9part d'Antoine Kombouar\u00e9, conjugu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'arriv\u00e9e de Carlo Ancelotti, K\u00e9vin va perdre petit \u00e0 petit sa place dans le 11 Parisien. Ancelotti lui pr\u00e9f\u00e8re tout d'abord Guillaume Hoarau, puis un syst\u00e8me sans v\u00e9ritable pointe (avec Pastore dans le r\u00f4le d'attaquant axial).\n\n\u00c0 l'aube de la saison 2012-2013, Gameiro est sur le point de quitter le club, mais Ancelotti le convainc de rester. Lors de la r\u00e9ception du FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard au Parc des Princes pour le compte de la 7e journ\u00e9e du Championnat, il signe un doubl\u00e9 pour sa premi\u00e8re titularisation de la saison. Lors de la r\u00e9ception du Stade de Reims pour le compte de la 9e journ\u00e9e du Championnat, il marque le seul but de la rencontre sur un centre de Maxwell. Il marque de nouveau contre \u00c9vian Thonon Gaillard (4-0), le Stade brestois (3-0) et contre le Toulouse FC en Coupe de France (3-1). Le 5 mars 2013 , il joue le premier match de Ligue des Champions de sa carri\u00e8re lors du match retour face \u00e0 Valence CF.

La concurrence d'Ezequiel Lavezzi et Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 ainsi que l'arriv\u00e9e d'Edinson Cavani, l'ont confort\u00e9 dans son choix de quitter le PSG pour aller chercher du temps de jeu ailleurs et relancer sa carri\u00e8re dans l'espoir de participer \u00e0 la Coupe du monde de football de 2014. Malheureusement, il se blesse \u00e0 l'adducteur de la jambe gauche lors de son premier entrainement devant 500 fans venus y assister[9].

The highly talented player is currently 22-years-old and is the star in the FC Lorient formation.\n\nHis youth career started at Marly-la-Ville and then Chantilly, K\u00e9vin made his breakthrough when he was scouted by RC Strasbourg at the age of 13. He worked his way up through the RC Strasbourg youth ranks and after excelling with both the under-16\u2019s and under-18\u2019s. On the 10th of September 2005, he made his debut as a substitute against PSG. Gameiro soon became an essential piece to Jacky Dugu\u00e9p\u00e9roux\u2019s side playing 58 matches and scoring 10 goals.\n\nRC Strasbourg\u2019s relegation from League 1 led to Gameiro\u2019s departure and in 2008, he joined FC Lorient for 3 million euros. While playing for Lorient, Gameiro has shown that his transfer fee was not gone to waste. 61 games later, Gameiro who wears the number 9 jersey, became extremely important player for Lorient with 21 goals to his name. Last season, Gameiro led Lorient to a 10th Ligue 1 finish, their best record yet. Lorient currently sits comfortably at 10th place and Gameiro is leading the goalscoring charts alongside Niang, both having scored 15 times.\n\nNaturally a striker, K\u00e9vin Gameiro can also play on the wings. He may lack height as he is 1.72m, but his biggest asset is his physical attributes, in particular his pace. With first-class technique K\u00e9vin Gameiro is also very proficient at both dribbling and finishing. He is a very determined player who works hard and always fights for the ball. His consistency has gained most of his recognition and is one of the reasons why he is such an important element in Lorient\u2019s team.\n\nInternationally, K\u00e9vin Gameiro has made appearances for the French under-18, under-20 and under-21 sides. In the 2007 Toulon Tournament he scored 5 goals in four matches and was named the player of the tournament, he led his team to victory with a hat trick in the final against China. Despite being eligible for Portugal and Queiroz issuing interest in him, Gameiro does not want to represent the country and opted to play for France. It will not be long before he makes his international debut, possibly in South Africa.\n\nThe striker has been heavily linked with a move within France; the top teams have all expressed interest in him. PSG were set to make a move for him in January, but Bordeuax and Marseille are also keeping a close eye on him. Recently, he has been linked with a move to Italian giants AC Milan amongst other Italian clubs, but Italy would not suit his style. Zidane has recommended Real Madrid to start tracking the highly talented youngster, but then again, who aren\u2019t Real Madrid interested in?\n\nK\u00e9vin Gameiro\u2019s exploits have not gone unnoticed and it is highly likely that he will join a top team within a few seasons as well as becoming a regular for the French national team. His work ethics and pace as well as his versatility could benefit an aging French team who are struggling for form, especially in the attacking sector of the team. With Thierry Henry past his prime and Benzema unable to replicate the form that was produced before his transfer to Real Madird; K\u00e9vin Gameiro may be the perfect solution for Raymond Domenech. His creativity and consistency as well as his ability to shine in big games, would be extremely beneficial.\n\nSo what do you think of K\u00e9vin Gameiro? Should Raymond Domenech give him a surprise call up?"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/kevin-gameiro/", "page_content": "K\u00e9vin Gameiro (born 9 May 1987) is a French professional footballer who plays for Spanish club Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.

In 2004, he moved to the Alsace region to join professional club RC Strasbourg. He made his professional debut in the 2004\u201305 season and appeared in the UEFA Cup with Strasbourg. After three seasons with the club, in August 2008, Gameiro signed a four-year deal with FC Lorient. With Lorient, he finished his first two seasons with the club as top scorer.

He began his football career playing for ES Marly-la-Ville not far from his hometown at the age of six. Prior to turning 13, he opted to remain in the region of Picardie and joined US Chantilly. While excelling at US Chantilly, Gameiro was spotted by former RC Strasbourg player and scout Jacky Dugu\u00e9p\u00e9roux who recommended the player join his former club. In 2004, Gameiro completed his move to the Alsatian club joining as a youth player.\n\nClub career\n\nStrasbourg\n\nUpon arrival, Gameiro was inserted onto the club's reserve team in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth level of French football. He spent the entire 2004\u201305 season playing with the team. Gameiro featured in 20 matches and scored four goals.

Three weeks later, his season was cut short after rupturing ligaments in one of his knees following a tackle from Troyes midfielder Blaise Kouassi. The injury required six months of rehabilitation, which resulted in Gameiro missing the Coupe Gambardella competition, which the Strasbourg under-19 team won, defeating Lyon 3\u20131 in the final at the Stade de France. Overall, Gameiro's season was a success, however, due to the club focusing more on Europe, the team suffered relegation to Ligue 2 for the 2006\u201307 season.\n\nDue to undergoing rehabilitation on his knee, Gameiro made his debut with Strasbourg in Ligue 2 late in the season on 19 September 2006 in the club's 2\u20130 loss to Auxerre in the Coupe de la Ligue. He scored his first goal two months later in a 2\u20130 victory over Istres. Through the rest of the season, Gameiro alternated between the bench and the starting eleven. He only scored two goals, against Gueugnon and Istres, again, for the rest of the season as Strasbourg achieved promotion back to Ligue 1 courtesy of the club's 3rd-place finish. In his first full season as a professional, Gameiro scored six total goals in 36 total appearances. He scored in back-to-back matches during the early portion of the season against Auxerre and Toulouse, but went cold mid-season scoring only two goals. He scored his final two goals for the club in the final two matches of the season against Caen and Marseille. Strasbourg lost both matches., causing Strasbourg to again suffer relegation to Ligue 2.\n\nLorient\n\nGameiro training with Lorient in 2010 Gameiro training with Lorient in 2010\n\nDespite strong interest from Marseille, on 17 June 2008, Gameiro agreed to a four-year deal with Brittany-based outfit Lorient. The club paid Strasbourg a transfer fee of \u20ac3 million for his services. Gameiro was given the number 9 shirt and installed as the club's head striker.

Lorient went undefeated in the four matches. In the Coupe de France, Lorient reached the Round of 16. Gameiro scored goals against Alen\u00e7on and Tours in the Round of 64 and Round of 32, respectively. Gameiro continued his consistency during the spring portion of the season scoring goals against Sochaux, Grenoble, Marseille, and Nancy. Gameiro scored a double against the latter club. He finished the season with 39 total appearances and 13 goals. Lorient finished the season in 10th, tied for the club's highest finish ever in the first division.\n\nGameiro continued his rise in French football in the 2009\u201310 Ligue 1 season. He scored on his season debut on 8 August 2009 in a 2\u20131 win over Lille and converted another goal the following week against Montpellier in a 2\u20132 draw. A month later, he scored in back-to-back matches against Nancy and Grenoble as Lorient won both matches. Two weeks later, he scored in Lorient's 4\u20131 victory over Nice and, on 7 November, scored a double in the club's 5\u20130 thrashing of Boulogne.

On 27 January 2010, Gameiro scored the only goal in Lorient's upset victory over Lyon in the Coupe de la Ligue. Two weeks later, he scored in Lorient's 3\u20130 humiliation of Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes. The following week, Gameiro scored in a 1\u20131 draw with Toulouse. His consistent form prompted analysts to declare that Gameiro should be considered for the French national team, however, prior to the friendly against Spain on 3 March, Gameiro picked up an injury, which led to coach Raymond Domenech not considering him for the squad. Gameiro finished the 2009\u201310 campaign by scoring seven goals in the final nine league matches. He scored a brace against Saint-\u00c9tienne and converted opening goals in wins over Bordeaux, Grenoble, and Lille. In the six matches he scored in, Lorient won five and ultimately finished the campaign in 7th place; the club's highest finish in Ligue 1 ever.\n\nIn the 2010\u201311 season, Gameiro remained consistent. After missing the opening league match of the season, he returned to the team in mid-August. On 28 August, he scored the game-winning goal in a 2\u20130 victory over Lyon.

In December, he played a part in all three goals in the team's 6\u20133 loss to Lille. Gameiro scored the team's opening goal in the 7th minute, netted his second just before half-time, and assisted on Lynel Kitambala's in the second half. In January 2011, Gameiro was the subject of intense transfer speculation. On 4 January, it was reported that the striker had reached an agreement on a contract with Spanish club Valencia. Despite the reported agreement, Lorient president Lo\u00efc F\u00e9ry declared that while personal terms had been agreed, Valencia had never sent in a transfer fee offer for the player. Later in the month, French media reported that Lorient had accepted a bid from fellow Ligue 1 club Bordeaux. Bordeaux officials, however, revealed that Gameiro's preference was to play for Valencia. Ultimately, Gameiro remained with Lorient following the closure of the transfer window as Fery declared \"our priority has always been to keep Kevin with us\". Despite the speculation of a possible transfer, Gameiro remained potent on the field of play.

His family came from Portugal. He began his football career playing for ES Marly-la-Ville not far from his hometown at the age of six. Prior to turning 13, he opted to remain in the region of Picardie and joined US Chantilly.

In the final of the 2013\u201314 Europa League against Portuguese side Benfica on 14 May 2014, Gameiro came off the bench in extra time and scored the game-winning penalty kick to secure a 4\u20132 shoot-out victory for Sevilla.\n\nOn 24 October 2015, Gameiro netted a hat-trick in a 2015\u201316 La Liga home match against Getafe CF, in which Sevilla won 5\u20130, his first La Liga hat-trick.\n\nOn 18 May 2016, just 17 seconds into the second half of the 2016 UEFA Europa League Final against Liverpool, Gameiro scored Sevilla's equalizing goal a metre from the goal line after receiving a low cross from Mariano Ferreira Filho who had burst into the penalty box from the right. That was his eighth 2015-16 UEFA Europa League goal. Sevilla won the match 3\u20131 to become the first team to win the UEFA Cup/Europa League three times in a row. It was their fifth UEFA Cup/Europa League title overall.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico Madrid\n\nOn 30 July 2016, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid reached an agreement with Sevilla for the transfer of Gameiro on a four-year contract for a reported \u20ac32 million rising to \u20ac40 million with add-ons.\n\nOn 18th February 2017, Gameiro scored the fastest La Liga hat trick in over 22 years coming on a substitute against Sporting de Gij\u00f3n in a 4-1 victory.\n\nInternational career\n\nGameiro represented France internationally at the under-18, under-20, and under-21 levels. He made his under-18 debut on 29 October 2004 in a friendly match against Russia. Gameiro made his lone other appearance with the under-18 team in the return match against Russia two days later. He established himself locally for his performance at the 2007 Toulon Tournament with the under-20 team. Gameiro scored five goals in four matches scoring only one goal in the group stage portion of the competition against the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. In the semi-finals, Gameiro scored the only goal in the team's victory over Portugal. In the final against China, Gameiro netted a hat trick, which took only 33 minutes to complete in the team's 3\u20131 victory. Gameiro was named the Player of the Tournament for his performances. He made his under-21 debut on 26 March 2008 in a friendly against the Czech Republic. Gameiro, on his debut, netted the third goal in the team's 4\u20131 victory. Gameiro was called up for the under-21 team's 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification play-offs tie against Germany, but did not feature in either leg. France lost the tie 2\u20131 on aggregate. The negative result ended Gameiro's under-21 career.\n\nIn August 2010, Gameiro was called up to the French senior team for the first time by new manager Laurent Blanc for the team's UEFA Euro 2012 qualification matches against Belarus and Bosnia and Herzegovina. He made his senior team debut in the match against Belarus appearing as a substitute in the second half. On 9 February 2011, Gameiro earned his second career cap in the team's 1\u20130 victory over Brazil. In his next appearance with the team against the Ukraine on 6 June, he scored his first international goal netting the team's opener in a 4\u20131 win. On 7 October 2016, he scored a brace in the 2018 World Cup qualification match again Bulgaria, which France won 4\u20131.\n\nDue to having Portuguese heritage through his paternal grandfather, Gameiro was eligible to represent Portugal at the senior international level. In 2009, then-manager Carlos Queiroz declared that Gameiro was \"an interesting player\" and that he \"would love to talk to him\" regarding representing Portugal. However, Gameiro downplayed the talk, stating that he \"didn't really have any links to the country\" and that he preferred to represent France.\n\nClub\n\nInternational\n\nHonours\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\nLigue 1: 2012\u201313\n\nSevilla\n\nUEFA Europa League: 2013\u201314, 2014\u201315, 2015\u201316\n\nIndividual\n\nUEFA Europa League Squad of the Season: 2015\u201316"}, {"url": "https://sofifa.com/player/176600/kevin-gameiro/070001/", "page_content": "All product names, logos, and brands are the property of their respective owners.\n\nAll company, product, and service names used in this website are for identification purposes only.\n\nTerms Privacy FAQ"}, {"url": "https://sofifa.com/player/176600/kevin-gameiro/220056/", "page_content": "All product names, logos, and brands are the property of their respective owners.\n\nAll company, product, and service names used in this website are for identification purposes only.\n\nTerms Privacy FAQ"}, {"url": "https://sofifa.com/player/176600/kevin-gameiro/210040/", "page_content": "All product names, logos, and brands are the property of their respective owners.\n\nAll company, product, and service names used in this website are for identification purposes only.\n\nTerms Privacy FAQ"}, {"url": "https://sofifa.com/player/176600/kevin-gameiro/230008/", "page_content": "All product names, logos, and brands are the property of their respective owners.\n\nAll company, product, and service names used in this website are for identification purposes only.\n\nTerms Privacy FAQ"}, {"url": "https://sofifa.com/player/176600/kevin-gameiro/170099", "page_content": "All product names, logos, and brands are the property of their respective owners.\n\nAll company, product, and service names used in this website are for identification purposes only.\n\nTerms Privacy FAQ"}, {"url": "https://sofifa.com/player/176600/kevin-gameiro/130034", "page_content": "All product names, logos, and brands are the property of their respective owners.\n\nAll company, product, and service names used in this website are for identification purposes only.\n\nTerms Privacy FAQ"}], "K\u00e9vin Gameiro's club is Valencia CF.": [{"url": "https://fbref.com/en/players/42276181/Kevin-Gameiro", "page_content": "About FBref.com\n\nFBref.com launched (June 13, 2018) with domestic league coverage for England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and United States.
