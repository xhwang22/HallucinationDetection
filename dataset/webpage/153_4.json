We were a little bit short of training, so I didn\u2019t want him to overdo and overpush. In the heats, we had a strategy of just doing the first 100 at about 75-80 percent, get a lead, then cool it and make sure he\u2019s in the top 16 for the semi-finals. I told him that, in the semi-final, the key is still to conserve energy because we are not as fit as we want to be. So (he\u2019ll) swim through and, in the last 20-25 metres, shut it down and make sure that you qualify for the final.\n\nCome second (and) let Laszlo Cseh from Hungary pass you. I had to insist that there was no medal in the semi-final. It was more important that he saved every bit of energy for the final. He listened and he did everything to perfection. George Bovell III (GB): I was preparing myself for the struggle of my life coming up, the 200 (metre) IM. I want to give you a quote, to describe how the 200m IM is. It\u2019s about holding up a heavy weight that gets heavier and heavier with every passing second, and it crushes you.\n\nYou\u2019re maintaining that impossible rhythm of exertion while executing mastery of technique, not one but all four strokes, and the transitions between the strokes. Total exhaustion must come long before the end of the race. You must have a really strong mind to force the body to hold on that rhythm and survive, to keep going, without drowning. That\u2019s what the 200m IM is all about.\n\nIn the heats, I really played it cool. In the semi-final, I\u2019m stacked up against a man I expect to beat to get a medal. Swimming is not only about physical condition, there is a lot of mind games that happen. I could have pushed and beat him. In the home leg, I slowed down and gave him a false sense of power over me, for him to feel like he broke (my spirit). I had to pull out all of the tricks in my book because my body was like 60 percent, because of my shoulder. That was a tactic that paid off well in the final.\n\nBovell III finished third in the second semi-final, in a time of two minutes 0.31 seconds, trailing Cseh (1:59.65) and Brazil\u2019s Thiago Pereira (2:00.07).\n\nAR: George qualified for the final, to be in lane two. We were going against Michael Phelps, (Ryan) Lochte and Cseh. In swimming, you have 25 minutes before the final where they\u2019ll go into a \u2018ready\u2019 room. Just before I was to send him down into the room, I was seeing nervousness. I tried different things but I had to be careful because, in a high-pressure situation, you don\u2019t want to add too much pressure because it will bring negative results. I just wasn\u2019t getting it.\n\n(Roberts called Bahamian swimmer Jeremy Knowles, his teammate at Auburn University). I said, \u2018I want you to talk to George, I need you to get him ready, he\u2019s looking a little nervous\u2019. Jeremy took aside and I went out of earshot. I saw Jeremy take out a marker that he had in his pocket and he drew something on the inside of his right bicep.\n\nWhatever he did, I saw this look of confidence, of self-esteem, of relaxation. George looked at me and I said, \u2018let\u2019s go\u2019. He went and had the swim of a lifetime.\n\nGB: This is everything that you wanted. You have a little voice that comes up in the back of your mind that tells you \u2018don\u2019t mess this up\u2019. Before the final, everyone must go into a room, a very small room where you wait about 20 minutes. It\u2019s very intense in this room. I was preparing myself since I had the injury, to lay my life on the line. A friend of mine came up to me and drew this hammer on my bicep.\n\nI had a reputation (and was) called the \u2018hammer of justice\u2019. If you\u2019re racing against somebody and you are very tired, and you know the other person is very tired too, and you speed up, even though you cannot sustain that acceleration, eventually what starts to happen is that the person you\u2019re racing against, who\u2019s looking over at you, they say \u2018whey boy, George he\u2019s fresh\u2019 and they eventually give up, and you break their spirit.\n\nWhen they have given up and drop back, then you can relax the pace. When you break somebody\u2019s spirit like that, in practice, that\u2019s called \u2018dropping the hammer of justice\u2019. I used to do this to people.\n\nAR: His normal freestyle split could have 28.16, it was 29.0, but it was still good enough to give him that bronze medal. Guess who he beat for the bronze medal? The very said Laszlo Cseh who, the day before, he had allowed him to pass. George made history, it was a proud effort. It was the hammer of justice which was drawn on his bicep by Knowles which brought him into the mental state of readiness, to perform. The hammer of justice represented how George used to train with his teammates when they were under pressure. George\u2019s father was the manager and I was the coach, we fell down in the pool deck, hugging up. All the countries were so happy because they love when small countries get on the podium because, in swimming, it\u2019s very rare. It was a great time and it still goes down in history as the greatest swimming moment for TT. I was so proud of George.\n\nGB: Even though my body was physically weak, I had competed in six races already. I had doubts about my physical strength. When (Knowles) drew that marker on me, it reminded me (that) my soul is strong, I am a warrior. I was ready to lay it all out. I had to pace it, I was physically weak, I was seventh after the first (part). In the backstroke I started to dig, started to put some energy and make up some ground.\n\nI felt so weak at the end of that backstroke and I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening in the final. I had a moment of weakness. In that moment of weakness comes the perfect excuse \u2013 the exhaustion, the injury. I was so tempted to take that excuse and just slow down. I didn\u2019t feel like how I hoped to feel in the Olympics final. I pushed through the pain and I kept accelerating.\n\n(Bovell III admitted that, during the turn and push-off for the breaststroke, he gained a lot of ground on his rivals).\n\nI started to push the breaststroke like a fire burning in my heart. I kept accelerating as if the end of the breaststroke was the end of the race.\n\nI moved up into second at the end of the breaststroke. Laszlo Cseh, the man next to me, I think he expected me to break. I kept my rhythm and it caused him to panic a little bit and lose his composure. I think it\u2019s because of the tactic I played in the semi-final gave me a psychological advantage over him.\n\nMy freestyle was not a strong as usual, so I kept pushing and pushing. An interesting thing happened, when I touched the wall, it showed me in second place and then the clock had me in third place, it switched places with Lochte and myself.\n\nSome people say America owns it because NBC has the tv rights, and a one-two America finish is good for the ratings. I came out of the ball with a headache, but a great sense of relief."}, {"url": "https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/george-bovell.html", "page_content": "About\n\nSwimmer who won Trinidad and Tobago's first Olympic swimming medal when he took bronze at the 2004 games in the 200M individual medley.\n\nBefore Fame\n\nHe attended Auburn University, where he set a school record earning 25 All-American honors.\n\nTrivia\n\nOn March 25, 2004, he set a 200M IM world record, which lasted for more than a year and a half.\n\nFamily Life\n\nHis brother, Nicholas Bovell, also competed at the 2008 Olympics.\n\nAssociated With\n\nWhen he won bronze at the 2004 Olympics, he finished behind silver-medalist Ryan Lochte, and gold-medalist Michael Phelps."}, {"url": "https://olympics.com/en/athletes/george-bovell-iii", "page_content": "Year of Birth\n\nYear of Birth 1983\n\nFirst Olympic Games\n\nFirst Olympic Games Sydney 2000\n\nTrinidad and Tobago\n\nTeam Trinidad and Tobago"}, {"url": "https://infofamouspeople.com/famous/george-bovell.htm", "page_content": "George Bovell's About \u270e]\n\nGeorge Bovell was born on July 18, 1983 (age 39) in Guelph, Trinidad And Tobago.

George is known as the \"Hammer of Justice\" with the Auburn swim team. Then Auburn teammates, Fred Bousquet, Romain Barnier, Mark Gangloff, and Auburn teammate and USA Olympian diver, Ceasar Garcia all came and rallied around George challenging him to bring honor to Auburn swimming.

My younger sister, Alexander and my 2 aunts, Janet Bishop and Annie Vance are here in Athens with my parents supporting me. My brother Nicholas is back home recovering from an ear surgery.

I had doubts in the backstroke, but I pushed through the pain and just looked to bring it home.\"\n\nBovell's leadoff butterfly stroke was a 26.22, which put him in sixth at the first turn. He then turned over to clock a 29.94 in the backstroke, which moved him into third behind eventual gold-medalist and world record holder Michael Phelps of the United States and silver-medalist Ryan Lochte, also an American.\n\nWith 100-meter to go, Bovell registered a 33.95 in the breaststroke leg, the best split in the field, before clocking a 28.64 to out-touch Laszlo Cseh of Hungary by .04 seconds.\n\n\"George did this in a meet where he was struggling. He wasn't performing up to his or our (the Auburn coaches) standards up to this point,\" Auburn coach David Marsh said. \"But he stepped up tonight and got the job done.

Er gewann f\u00fcr sein Land im Jahr 2004 eine olympische Bronzemedaille und ist damit bis heute der erfolgreichste karibische Schwimmsportler. Sein Schwimmtalent wurde ihm offenbar in die Wiege gelegt, sein Vater George war College-Schwimmer und seine Mutter eine Langstrecken-L\u00e4uferin, die bei den Olympischen Spielen 1972 und 1976 f\u00fcr Barbados und Kanada startete. Sein Bruder nahm als Schwimmer bei den Olympischen Spielen 2008 teil. Seinen ersten gro\u00dfen internationalen Erfolg konnte George Bovell bei den Schwimmweltmeisterschaften 2001 in Fukuoka feiern, wo er \u00fcber seine Spezialstrecke 200 m Lagen in 2:01,50 Minuten den vierten Platz erreichte. Zwei Jahre sp\u00e4ter bei den Schwimmweltmeisterschaften 2003 in Barcelona konnte er zwar seine Zeit \u00fcber diese Strecke auf 2:00,06 Minuten verbessern, dennoch reichte es dort nur f\u00fcr einen f\u00fcnften Platz. Bei den Panamerikanischen Spielen 2003 in Santo Domingo konnte er dann zweimal Gold \u00fcber 200 m Freistil und 200 m Lagen sowie zweimal Silber \u00fcber 100 m Freistil und 100 m R\u00fccken erringen. Damit erlangte er allein vier der sieben Medaillen f\u00fcr Trinidad und Tobago bei den Spielen und dabei die einzigen beiden Goldmedaillen. Bei den Olympischen Spielen 2004 in Athen holte er dann v\u00f6llig \u00fcberraschend mit einer Zeit von 1:58,80 Minuten die Bronzemedaille \u00fcber 200 m Lagen hinter den beiden US-Amerikanern Michael Phelps und Ryan Lochte. Von der Silbermedaille trennten ihn dabei gerade mal zwei Hundertstel Sekunden. Seine Medaille war f\u00fcr die Karibik die erste Medaille im Schwimmen bei Olympischen Spielen \u00fcberhaupt und die einzige f\u00fcr sein Land in Athen. Insgesamt war er der neunte Athlet, der f\u00fcr Trinidad und Tobago eine Medaille bei Olympischen Spielen holen konnte, die weiteren Medaillengewinner waren in der Leichtathletik und im Gewichtheben erfolgreich. Mit einer Zeit von 1:53,93 Minuten konnte er am 25. M\u00e4rz 2004 bei den NCAA-Meisterschaften 2004 in einen neuen Kurzbahn-Weltrekord \u00fcber 200 m Lagen aufstellen. Damit war Bovell der erste Schwimmer aus Trinidad und Tobago, der einen Weltrekord verbessern konnte. Der Rekord hielt etwa 20 Monate, bis er von dem Ungarn L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Cseh bei den Kurzbahneuropameisterschaften 2005 in Triest um 47 Hundertstel Sekunden unterboten wurde.

We were a little bit short of training, so I didn\u2019t want him to overdo and overpush. In the heats, we had a strategy of just doing the first 100 at about 75-80 percent, get a lead, then cool it and make sure he\u2019s in the top 16 for the semi-finals. I told him that, in the semi-final, the key is still to conserve energy because we are not as fit as we want to be. So (he\u2019ll) swim through and, in the last 20-25 metres, shut it down and make sure that you qualify for the final.\n\nCome second (and) let Laszlo Cseh from Hungary pass you. I had to insist that there was no medal in the semi-final. It was more important that he saved every bit of energy for the final. He listened and he did everything to perfection. George Bovell III (GB): I was preparing myself for the struggle of my life coming up, the 200 (metre) IM. I want to give you a quote, to describe how the 200m IM is. It\u2019s about holding up a heavy weight that gets heavier and heavier with every passing second, and it crushes you.\n\nYou\u2019re maintaining that impossible rhythm of exertion while executing mastery of technique, not one but all four strokes, and the transitions between the strokes. Total exhaustion must come long before the end of the race. You must have a really strong mind to force the body to hold on that rhythm and survive, to keep going, without drowning. That\u2019s what the 200m IM is all about.\n\nIn the heats, I really played it cool. In the semi-final, I\u2019m stacked up against a man I expect to beat to get a medal. Swimming is not only about physical condition, there is a lot of mind games that happen. I could have pushed and beat him. In the home leg, I slowed down and gave him a false sense of power over me, for him to feel like he broke (my spirit). I had to pull out all of the tricks in my book because my body was like 60 percent, because of my shoulder. That was a tactic that paid off well in the final.\n\nBovell III finished third in the second semi-final, in a time of two minutes 0.31 seconds, trailing Cseh (1:59.65) and Brazil\u2019s Thiago Pereira (2:00.07).\n\nAR: George qualified for the final, to be in lane two. We were going against Michael Phelps, (Ryan) Lochte and Cseh. In swimming, you have 25 minutes before the final where they\u2019ll go into a \u2018ready\u2019 room. Just before I was to send him down into the room, I was seeing nervousness. I tried different things but I had to be careful because, in a high-pressure situation, you don\u2019t want to add too much pressure because it will bring negative results. I just wasn\u2019t getting it.\n\n(Roberts called Bahamian swimmer Jeremy Knowles, his teammate at Auburn University). I said, \u2018I want you to talk to George, I need you to get him ready, he\u2019s looking a little nervous\u2019. Jeremy took aside and I went out of earshot. I saw Jeremy take out a marker that he had in his pocket and he drew something on the inside of his right bicep.\n\nWhatever he did, I saw this look of confidence, of self-esteem, of relaxation. George looked at me and I said, \u2018let\u2019s go\u2019. He went and had the swim of a lifetime.\n\nGB: This is everything that you wanted. You have a little voice that comes up in the back of your mind that tells you \u2018don\u2019t mess this up\u2019. Before the final, everyone must go into a room, a very small room where you wait about 20 minutes. It\u2019s very intense in this room. I was preparing myself since I had the injury, to lay my life on the line. A friend of mine came up to me and drew this hammer on my bicep.\n\nI had a reputation (and was) called the \u2018hammer of justice\u2019. If you\u2019re racing against somebody and you are very tired, and you know the other person is very tired too, and you speed up, even though you cannot sustain that acceleration, eventually what starts to happen is that the person you\u2019re racing against, who\u2019s looking over at you, they say \u2018whey boy, George he\u2019s fresh\u2019 and they eventually give up, and you break their spirit.\n\nWhen they have given up and drop back, then you can relax the pace. When you break somebody\u2019s spirit like that, in practice, that\u2019s called \u2018dropping the hammer of justice\u2019. I used to do this to people.\n\nAR: His normal freestyle split could have 28.16, it was 29.0, but it was still good enough to give him that bronze medal. Guess who he beat for the bronze medal? The very said Laszlo Cseh who, the day before, he had allowed him to pass. George made history, it was a proud effort. It was the hammer of justice which was drawn on his bicep by Knowles which brought him into the mental state of readiness, to perform. The hammer of justice represented how George used to train with his teammates when they were under pressure. George\u2019s father was the manager and I was the coach, we fell down in the pool deck, hugging up. All the countries were so happy because they love when small countries get on the podium because, in swimming, it\u2019s very rare. It was a great time and it still goes down in history as the greatest swimming moment for TT. I was so proud of George.\n\nGB: Even though my body was physically weak, I had competed in six races already. I had doubts about my physical strength. When (Knowles) drew that marker on me, it reminded me (that) my soul is strong, I am a warrior. I was ready to lay it all out. I had to pace it, I was physically weak, I was seventh after the first (part). In the backstroke I started to dig, started to put some energy and make up some ground.\n\nI felt so weak at the end of that backstroke and I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening in the final. I had a moment of weakness. In that moment of weakness comes the perfect excuse \u2013 the exhaustion, the injury. I was so tempted to take that excuse and just slow down. I didn\u2019t feel like how I hoped to feel in the Olympics final. I pushed through the pain and I kept accelerating.\n\n(Bovell III admitted that, during the turn and push-off for the breaststroke, he gained a lot of ground on his rivals).\n\nI started to push the breaststroke like a fire burning in my heart. I kept accelerating as if the end of the breaststroke was the end of the race.\n\nI moved up into second at the end of the breaststroke. Laszlo Cseh, the man next to me, I think he expected me to break. I kept my rhythm and it caused him to panic a little bit and lose his composure. I think it\u2019s because of the tactic I played in the semi-final gave me a psychological advantage over him.\n\nMy freestyle was not a strong as usual, so I kept pushing and pushing. An interesting thing happened, when I touched the wall, it showed me in second place and then the clock had me in third place, it switched places with Lochte and myself.\n\nSome people say America owns it because NBC has the tv rights, and a one-two America finish is good for the ratings. I came out of the ball with a headache, but a great sense of relief."}, {"url": "https://swimswam.com/bovell-tests-out-trinidad-tobagos-aquatics-center/", "page_content": "Four-time Olympian George Bovell was on-hand at a test event held at Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s brand new aquatics center last week. The temporarily-naed National Aquatic Center, situated in Balmain Couva, invited 32-year-old Bovell as its first swimmer to take to the 50m pool\u2019s water. Bovell is cited as a primary inspiration for the facility, which has been in the works for several years now.\n\nThe facility in Trinidad consists of a 50m outdoor warm-up pool, diving well, a fitness room with sauna, Turkish bath, as well as a cold water pool. The site has the ability to permanently seat 700 spectators and is outfitted with scoring and timing, as well as above ground and underwater audio and video systems.\n\nOf his participation in the center\u2019s test event, Bovell commented to Newsday, \u201cIt\u2019s been in the news since 2003 and it\u2019s great that I\u2019ve lived to see this and be able to enjoy it today.\u201d\n\nReflecting on his humble beginnings, the Olympic bronze medalist said, \u201cWhen I now started off swimming you should have seen the pool; green in color, six lanes, just a big hole in the ground. And to now see that we have reached at the highest of the sport internationally with this facility is amazing.\u201d\n\nEver the visionary, Bovell sees the possibility of the aquatics center to act as a growth driver both within the sport of swimming, as well as economically. \u201cWe need to market this to the world,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need to get teams from around the globe to come and enjoy our weather and facility and boost our economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot university and professional teams, around winter time, that spend money to Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Bermuda and sometimes Barbados to train. If we could capture some of that market, it would allow this facility to be sustainable. The money coming in from those visiting teams would allow us to upkeep this at no cost to us. I have traveled around the world and have a long-established network that we can hopefully tap into.\u201d\n\nAn additional revenue opportunity is tied to the naming of the venue, which is still in the works. Minister of Sport Darryl Smith did comment that there is still a possibility of the main pool being named after Bovell.\n\n\u201cI still have to take that proposal to Cabinet but I don\u2019t think it would be a problem naming one of the pools (after him) and some of the other pools in recognition of others who have done well,\u201d said Smith.\n\nSmith also acknowledged the business side of the facility as well, indicating that, \u201cWe have to get revenue so we can maintain and have proper functions happening here. At the end of the day we want to make sure that we maintain this high-maintenance facility because there is really nothing like this in the Caribbean. We want to ensure we have the right people to manage it.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the aquatic center\u2019s name, Bovell conveys that inspiring the next young crop of swimmers is the goal. \u201cThis next generation coming up, not only do they have an example of someone who has gone out there from this six lane hole in the ground pool and done what he has done with the limited resources that he had, but they have the means and the example to follow so I am looking forward to an incredibly bright future for swimming in Trinidad and Tobago,\u201d Bovell said.\n\nBovell will be competing in his 5th Olympic Games this summer in Rio."}, {"url": "https://www.ttoc.org/index.php/tto-athletes/rio-2016-team-tto/202-rio-2016-olympic-games-team-tto-delegation/swimming-men/2666-george-bovell-swimming", "page_content": "Historic 5th Olympic Games, Olympic Bronze Medalist, Greece, 2004; Former World Record Holder; Two-time World Championship Bronze Medalist; Six-time Pan Am Games Medalist (2 Gold, 2 Silver, 2 Bronze); Ten-time World Championship Finalist; 2nd Place Overall, 2012 FINA World Cup (7 gold, 9 silver); Five-time Individual NCAA Champion;\n\nSport: Swimming\n\nEvent: 50m Freestyle\n\nAge: 32\n\nD.O.B: 18/7/83\n\nHeight: 196m\n\nWeight: 93kg\n\nSocial Media: Twitter: @GeorgeBovell; FB: George Bovell"}, {"url": "https://wiki.alquds.edu/?query=George_Bovell", "page_content": "Trinidad and Tobago swimmer\n\nGeorge Richard Lycott Bovell (born 18 July 1983) is an Olympic bronze medalist swimmer and former world record holder from Trinidad and Tobago.

(AFP PHOTO) -\n\nGEORGE BOVELL III was TT\u2019s lone Olympic medallist at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.\n\nBovell III, then 21 years of age, copped bronze in the men\u2019s 200-metre individual medley, becoming the first, and only, TT swimmer, to medal at the Games.\n\nRecently, Bovell III and his coach Anil Roberts spoke about the journey they both shared \u2013 leading up to the 2004 Games, as well as the event itself.\n\nHere is the third and final part of the journey\u2026\n\nAnil Roberts: In 2004, that turned out to be the only medal (for TT). It was really a great moment and it will live on. Young people should go and watch that race, read the interviews and know that George Bovell III was a national hero.\n\nGeorge Bovell III: I always felt like the underdog. These big countries have everything, they have massage therapists, they have the best sports science they\u2019ve got everything and me, coming from Trinidad, we have none of those resources. I felt a sense of pride that we can reach that level despite where we\u2019re coming from because, now, we have the National Aquatic Centre, back then we have very terrible facilities, very Third World. I don\u2019t think at the time I really understood the significance of what it meant to (get) a medal for Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nOnly now, as I\u2019m out of the sport, that I can look back and say \u2018wow, maybe I blazed a trail and inspired many people\u2019. I was hoping at the time that I inspired a lot of people because I see people in Trinidad, the youths especially, and it\u2019s not that we lack opportunities, a lot of times we just lack motivation. They can never imagine that they too could be great. It\u2019s like a mental block.\n\nPeople tend to just accept mediocrity and say \u2018I\u2019m okay with just going to the Olympics\u2019. It\u2019s something I hope would just change the way we think and start to hold ourselves to a higher standard. The irony is that was my last 200 IM. A few months after that, I had a terrible knee injury and it ended my ability to swim the breaststroke properly. I had to face that reality and say either I change and go for something else or retire and say I had a good run.\n\nI bounced back to (get) a World Championship medal (bronze in the 50-metre freestyle in Barcelona, Spain in 2013) and be in an Olympic final, in the 50m freestyle, which is a completely different race. Of course, there are injuries along the way.\n\nI think that the bronze (at Athens), in a way, was a blessing. If I had won the gold medal, I think I would have become too proud. Personally, my belief, along with many other people, I doubt the legitimacy of Michael Phelps. I see the Olympic size of reality tv show and, from my own belief, that number two drop to number three, on that day, I think that with clean, fair and honourable competition, I was the best.\n\nIt does not matter of you\u2019re fighting cancer, taking chemotherapy, you\u2019re struggling to feed your family or competing in sport, life gives you a challenge. And if you have the perfect excuse, as long as you have the mental willpower to resist that excuse and keep pushing, you are a champion."}]}
