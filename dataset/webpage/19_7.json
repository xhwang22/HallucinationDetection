Morgenstein\u2019s unique and dynamic drumming style has led Rod to win many awards, such as the Best Progressive Rock Drummer award in Modern Drummer Magazine\u2019s Reader\u2019s Poll five years in a row. He has worked with such names as the Steve Morse Band and Jordan Rudess, but there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s best known for his work with 80\u2019s multi-platinum hard rockers Winger. The band released three albums before they wrapped it up in late 1993. Each member then went their separate ways to pursue individual goals. Kip Winger has released several solo albums. Reb Beach has worked on many projects and is now a member of the legendary Whitesnake. Paul Taylor did some commercials and projects, and Rod himself became an Associate Professor of Percussion at Berklee College of Music in Boston. He has also been doing different projects all the time. In 2006, Winger announced that the band would be back with the new album \u201cIV.\u201d Winger\u2019s reunion tour reached Finland last October, and then I had a chance to sit down with Mr. Morgenstein himself and ask about the latest news and have a look back at some good old times.\n\nTHE REUNION, NEW LINEUP, AND FUTURE OF WINGER?\n\nTo be honest, I was surprised to hear the new album from you guys after 13 years. I have to ask why just now, why this album wasn\u2019t released right after PULL, and what caused your breakup back in the day?\n\nWell, here\u2019s the thing: I\u2019ve been a professional musician for thirty years. I\u2019ve played with many bands, and the most fun group of guys to tour with is these guys. We didn\u2019t disband because we were fighting or enemies. It\u2019s because Nirvana came on the scene in 1991, and it was essentially over for everyone. Record sales went from the millions down. \u201cPull\u201d sold, and I think 300,000 records in America which by today\u2019s standards, it\u2019s like wow you\u2019re happening, but back then, you had to go gold at minimum. So, what happened was MTV had been pounding our videos from 1988 until the end of 1991.\n\nWhen we came out with \u201cPull,\u201d they said they would play \u201cDown Incognito,\u201d which was nice, but then they said, look, the alternative is in, and it\u2019s just time to go out to pasture. When MTV suddenly stops playing all of the videos from metal bands, it sends a message to the record labels, and the labels say maybe it\u2019s not worth pumping all the money into this music anymore. Then, everything happens at once. All the magazines are interested in Pearl Jam and Nirvana. We said, look, we had a great run. We have other things in music that we do, so let\u2019s just let it end on a high note and see what happens down the road. Kip Winger is one of my best friends, and I\u2019ve worked on his solo records, and then there are this Italian label, Frontiers, which for the last few years has been telling us we\u2019re one of their favorite bands, so when you\u2019re ready to do a record let\u2019s do it. So, the time was right, and we\u2019re all happy we did it. It was a wonderful opportunity to get together again. Four years ago, we got together to do the Poison and Cinderella US tour, which was a lot of fun. We just enjoy being together, and Reb is the funniest guy I know, so you just spend half the time laughing.\n\nWhat kind of expectations do you have regarding the sales of this new album?\n\nWell, we didn\u2019t want any illusions with this record, so we said, let\u2019s just do the record to remind people that Winger was a vital band and had something to say. And if all of our schedules line up and we can do some touring, let\u2019s do it to see how much of our audience is there, to see if it\u2019s even worth keeping it alive.\n\nDo you think this reunion is permanent and that Winger will continue making more albums in the future?\n\nWe\u2019re not trying to think that far ahead. We all hope that will happen in our hearts, but if no people show up to a show, then you know, how much can you bang your head against the wall? But I think that turnouts will be pretty respectable. We\u2019ll see. We have no idea if it\u2019s going to sell a few thousand or even fifty-thousand or more?\n\nWhat happened to Paul Taylor. Why he\u2019s not a part of this reunion?\n\nYeah, he\u2019s taking another path. He wished us all well. He was coming in and hanging out with us while we were recording. Paul\u2019s been very successful writing music for television. He co-wrote the theme for \u201cSabrina, the Teenage Witch,\u201d and he\u2019s making an incredible living off of that, and he\u2019s the one that wrote \u201cMiles Away,\u201d which was our biggest hit. He\u2019s now living in Nashville, pursuing a songwriting career. Yeah, touring is not something he\u2019s interested in right now.\n\nYou have two new members in the band. Let\u2019s start with guitarist John Roth. I know he has toured with you guys before, and he also plays on some of Kip\u2019s solo stuff?\n\nWhen Paul left the band after the second album, we auditioned not many guys, but Johnny came to us through our manager at the time, who was a partner with Bon Jovi, Skid Rod Motley Crue. So Doug was managing us for PULL, and John was involved that Doug was also with, and he told us that he knew the perfect guy. He said he\u2019s a great guitarist, a great singer, and he can also play keyboards. He was exactly what we wanted. One minute into jamming with him, we knew we didn\u2019t want anyone else. The record was done, and we were like, wow, we\u2019ll be touring. So the record was just me, Kip, and Reb.\n\nThen keyboardist Cenk Eroglu, he\u2019s originally from Turkey, right?\n\nThat\u00efs correct.\n\nHow did he end up being in Winger?\n\nYou know originally what happened was, this guy sent an e-mail to Kip saying, \u201cI am from Istanbul, Turkey, and you are my favorite singer, Winger is my favorite band. I have to work with you.\u201d So, I think he sent Kip some of his music, so Kip didn\u2019t want to just fly out to Turkey, not knowing what to expect. But, it turns out he has some fame in Turkey as a performer, but he\u2019s also a successful producer. Kip was actually blown away by some of the music, and then he made some trips to Istanbul, and the two of them were coming up to me with this incredible music that blended eastern and western culture. There were eastern percussion ensembles along with Kip\u2019s voice, so I put the drums down to a bunch of music. They worked so hard on it over two or three years, and in the final analysis, when they got an album\u2019s worth of music, they felt like they didn\u2019t quite meet their mark. So, they want to continue on that path until they hit exactly what their vision was. In the meantime, Cenk used one or two tunes for his solo record, so that\u2019s how that whole thing came about. Cenk played on the new record. He was in Nashville putting down records. But we couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt work out his visa issues for the tour here.\n\nI have heard the new album a couple of times now, and I would say that my first impression is that it\u2019s an even heavier album than \u201cPull\u201d was. Was that on purpose?\n\nYou know, that\u2019s such an easy question to answer. Well, you\u2019re a musician, right? Anyone wants to have a career in music, so in a perfect world, we don\u2019t listen to anything, and we just write music that is 100% what we want to do. But, when you do that, most probably never get a record deal because nobody knows where to fit it or how to market it, so it\u2019s too unique. What most musicians do when they want to have a career is listen to everything that\u2019s happening in the music business and say, is what I feel inside of me somehow compatible with trying to use some of the elements of music that labels are signing now to enable us to get a deal? I think that\u2019s part of how a lot of musicians end up getting record deals. A lot of musicians are into a lot of different kinds of music. My career has spanned so many different styles. I still play with Steve Morse and The Dixie Dregs making this instrumental fusion music. I play with Jordan Rudess, the keyboardist from Dream Theater. We have a duo where we do this over-the-top progressive stuff. I also play in a Jazz Is Dead band, which had Alfonso Johnson and people for many years.\n\nWe would do this jam band Grateful Dead kind of stuff. Then I would play with the bassist from Dream Theater and Ty Tabor from King\u2019s X to do this like power-pop so, what is the music that I love? I love it all! Whether, it\u2019s the heavy metal of Winger or the fusion of the Dregs. The fact is that the first two Winger albums sounded the same, and \u201cPull\u201d was a bit heavier, which is even heavier than that. To me, it\u2019s not that you at one time were doing something that you were not true to, and this is something that you are true to. It\u2019s just that musicians evolve. We go through a lot of changes.\n\nSo are you saying that Winger is heavy metal?\n\nMy career started the day that I got out of college with the Dixie Dregs. Nobody ever knew how to label us because we did rock and fusion and country, and they\u2019d say: what are you guys? We\u2019re just music! Once you put a label on it, everybody has a perception of what it is, and they start throwing the shit at you. Well yeah, most people would say that Winger is heavy metal, but if you hear \u201cBlue Suede Shoes.\u201d That\u2019s not metal. That\u2019s pop! And it almost has some progressive edges to it, but what about this other song? So, I don\u2019t know what to call it anymore. I just want to call it music!\n\nGOLDEN 80\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds WITH BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD\u2026\n\nBack in the 80\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Winger was often called one of the wimpiest bands existing. Why?\n\nYeah, well, I look at those pictures now, and I just laugh. I have great memories of it all, but some of it looks really silly. People have to realize that back then when we were doing it, all those bands were very serious about it. We would go to great lengths to have clothing made and our haircuts and having it permed. It looks funny now; it\u2019s kind of like when you watch movies of England where they\u2019re wearing funny hats. To them, it was very serious, and so back then, we didn\u2019t look any better. We look like a bunch of clowns! Back then, it was what everyone was doing. The audience loved it, and they were buying millions and millions of records, so something was working. I dare say that a lot of it. The guitarists from the metal bands were certainly way better than the guitarists that followed in the alternative bands\u2014Reb Beach, Andy Timmons from Danger Danger, etc. I could just go down lists of these great guitarists.\n\nWhat did you think about the character of \u201cBeavis and Butthead\u201d where they wore a Winger t-shirt?\n\nIt helped nail the coffin shut for our career. I remember watching it and laughing, then suddenly, I saw this nerdy, wimpy character, and he was wearing a Winger shirt. Not only that, but his parents wore Winger shirts! We tried to determine if we did something to the show\u2019s creator, like why he chose us. Out of all the wimpy bands: Winger, Bon Jovi, White Lion, Danger Danger. Why Winger? We were never able to figure it out. Yeah, that really hurt, but it\u2019s also very flattering. It means you mean something when someone chooses you to poke fun at.\n\nBeau Hill produced the first two Winger albums. How was it working with him back in the day?\n\nWell, Beau and Kip were best friends when they were teenagers. Then Beau was in a band called Airborne that had a record deal, but nothing really happened. Somehow, he ended up producing Ratt\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds first album, so he came on the map as a producer. He\u2019s the one that kind of secured the first Winger deal, now that he was a hot producer. He went to Atlantic Records and got us a deal, so he was the logical choice to produce the records. But what happens so often in the music business is you kind of live life, play your gigs, do your records, but you don\u2019t see eye to eye how it should be done. I wasn\u2019t particularly crazy about some aspects of the production, but many of the records were like that. I was just listening to \u201cSeventeen,\u201d and there are no cymbals! And the snare is the loudest thing, and it\u2019s even louder than the vocals.\n\nYou mentioned that he produced Ratt\u2019s first album; I think he produced five of their albums. There are not many cymbals there, either?\n\nIt\u2019s part of his productions. There\u2019s no reverb, and now when you listen to it now, it\u2019s wimpy. I mean, listen to that and then listen to \u201cBack in Black.\u201d For years, Kip has wanted a chance to remix those albums.\n\nPull was produced by Mike Shipley, and that album was something very different?\n\nWe know in some ways that it should have been the first Winger album. It\u2019s not that hindsight is 20/20. It\u2019s just that you kind of wonder: what if this came first? \u201cSeventeen\u201d is the song that put us on the map, and it also has the most jokes made about. The lyrics are stupid! But the music is very cool. It was just, you know, it was sex, drugs, and rock N roll back then. Many bands did songs like that, but that was the one that people made fun of.\n\nMaybe that song is the reason for the whole Beavis and Butthead thing?\n\nMaybe, but it also sold a million albums, so? \u201claughs.\u201d\n\nMEETING SEPULTURA, TOURING WITH SCORPIONS, PLAYING WITH ZENO, AND ALMOST WORKING WITH BLACK SABBATH.\n\nYou have been to Finland a couple of times before. Do you have any memories of those visits? Many people still remember when Winger played in a Giants of Rock festival, and your slot was right after Sepultura.\n\n[Laugh] Yeah, we will never forget that. See, bands like Winger and Sepultura should not be on the same bill. They have a much more hardcore audience. I remember playing \u201cMiles Away\u201d \u201claughs,\u201d and you don\u2019t play a ballad like that for Sepultura\u2019s crowd. They don\u2019t mix. There are a lot of different styles in the rock genre, and we talk about that. We remember that night. The sun was shining, and it was like noon PM-midnight. It was great. It was nice meeting the Sepultura guys because they were fans of the Dixie Dregs, so it was cool for me.\n\nI remember that once you played Finland with the Scorpions?\n\nYeah, that was in 1991. You know what? Scorpions were the first band that Winger ever played with. We weren\u2019t a band that played clubs and eventually got a deal. We were musicians that did demos, our record came out, and suddenly our first show was on tour with the Scorpions in America. That was in September or October 1988.\n\nSpeaking of Scorpions, I\u2019m going to meet with former Scorpions bassist Francis Bucholz in a few weeks. He\u2019s now actually playing in Uli Jon Roth\u2019s band, and we will see them in Sweden.\n\nHe\u2019s playing with Uli?! You\u2019re going to see them? Could you say HI! to both of those guys for me? I used to be in a band with Uli\u2019s brother, Zeno, so it was a real thrill for me. I auditioned for them in New York City, and Uli was there too. I played with them, and that was really cool. So, I moved over to Hannover, Germany, then went to England to do a Black Sabbath tour. But, back then, Black Sabbath was only Toni Iommi. Eric Singer was on drums and Ray Gillen on vocals. Dave Spitz played bass, and there was the keyboard guy, Geoff Nichols. So, we did a tour of the UK with them.\n\nHow was that tour?\n\nIt was good. It was terrific. Zeno was a great man. It was a comedy of errors that made that not happen. They had signed the biggest record deal in the history of music as a new band. That\u2019s how huge it was. I think EMI England, when they signed Zeno, thought that they would be the next Queen. We would drive around London and see billboards for Guinness Beer, and the next one was Zeno\u2019s new album. They were spending huge amounts of money on it, but it just didn\u2019t take.\n\nYou never recorded albums with them?\n\nNo, the record was just about to come out. They had three different drummers and producers on this record. I think that\u2019s what part of the problem was. It was just the three guys in the band, and they just kept plugging in new musicians and different producers, and they recorded all over the world and spent, I don\u2019t know how many hundreds of thousands of dollars on that record. By the time I got there, the writing was on the wall. I thought it was a good record, but who knows what goes on behind the scenes at labels? I\u2019m excited; the last show that Winger is doing is in Nottingham, the UK, at this thing called Fire Fest. It\u2019s a bunch of bands and one of the bands is called Fair Warning and the bass player from Zeno, when I was in the band, is going to be there. I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing him.\n\nHow about Black Sabbath and the album \u201cThe Seventh Star\u201d? You almost ended up joining the band in 1985?\n\nI think that was supposed to be a Tony Iommi solo record, and Glenn Hughes was the singer. You know what, it\u2019s funny; I met Tony and Glenn in Atlanta when they were recording that record, and that\u2019s where I was living. I was friends with Jeff Glixman, who I recently saw again at a Kansas concert in New York City. He used to be their producer. So I was living down in Atlanta in the 80s, and when Tony was recording the album, Jeff said, \u201cHey, you should come in and jam with Tony because I don\u2019t know if Eric will be able to tour with them.\u201d So, I went in and jammed with him, but I know I did a terrible job because I hate to confess this. I didn\u2019t know a single song by Black Sabbath.\n\nWhen I was growing up, I listened to Led Zeppelin, Jethro Tull, Jimi Hendrix, and Cream. Jethro Tull was my favorite. Back then, because I\u2019m very different now, Black Sabbath was too raw and basic. It was much simpler, like, you hear the song, and if you play an instrument, you can figure it out if you listen to it. Jethro Tull takes a lot more work. I was more in that mode of everything having to be complicated. I have really come like I\u2019m going backward in a lot of ways in my older age. Now, I love the more simple, all about the vibe music that\u2019s not just about the notes. So, when I went in to jam with Tony Iommi, I didn\u2019t know anything. Sure I may have heard Ozzy\u2019s voice saying, \u201cI am Iron Man,\u201d you know? That\u2019s all I\u2019d ever heard. Like an idiot, I didn\u2019t even think to listen to Sabbath records before going in. All I thought in my mind was, \u201cOh right; he\u2019s a rock guitarist. I\u2019ll just hit my drums as hard as I can and not even play fills.\u201d So, he was jamming, and I would start playing, and I had all these tom-toms that I wasn\u2019t even using. Then, after the fact, I listened to some records, and Bill Wards uses toms all the time. So, I was clueless, is what I\u2019m saying. I didn\u2019t do my homework. Maybe if I did, I would have had a shot at playing with him. I think Eric Singer was already coming in to do \u201cSeventh Star.\u201d Eric is a great drummer, a great drummer.\n\nHe currently does a great job with KISS and Alice Cooper.\n\nYeah, when Winger toured with KISS, it was with Eric. I was becoming very friendly with him. That was in 1990, fall of 1990. Because then we came to Europe in December and played with Scorpions until 1991.\n\nDIXIE DREGS AND JORDAN RUDESS\n\nHow did your first band Dixie Dregs originally start?\n\nI started in college. We were all music students. I also played keyboards and piano, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be a drummer or piano player. I was in an improvisation class playing the piano. I played with many guitar players and me like fifteen of them. And one of them really stuck out to me. He had long blonde hair, while all of the other guitarists had big fat jazz hollow-body guitars, and there was the one guy who played like a bastardized Telecaster with four pickups and a Stratocaster neck and Gibson frets, and he didn\u2019t sound like a jazz guitarist. The teacher was always yelling at him, saying, \u201cMorse, can\u2019t you sound like everybody else?\u201d And I said this guy is unbelievable. One day he came up to me, and we didn\u2019t know each other at all. He heard that I played the drums, and he told me his drummer had just broken his arm surfing. And he asked to fill in for some rehearsals while he was gone, and I said sure. I went into the first rehearsal, and they were doing Mahavishnu Orchestra covers, which was my favorite band; that band changed my band. I\u2019d never heard anything like that. So we\u2019re doing these covers, and we have an electric violinist there. Steve\u2019s songwriting, I thought I\u2019d died and gone to heaven. Here I was playing my favorite kind of music, and about a month or two later, the other drummer came back, and we started playing as a double drum band. But he was more of a meat and potatoes drummer, so he couldn\u2019t really play in the different time signatures. It just wasn\u2019t his thing. Everybody felt really bad, and we didn\u2019t know what to do. Eventually, he just said, this isn\u2019t my thing, and he left. So, I was the guy.\n\nYou guys have stayed very close?\n\nYeah, we have. The Dregs disbanded, and then Steve started the Steve Morse band, and he asked me to be a part of it. I did that for two records, and then Kansas reformed and asked him to join them. He told me he wanted to check it out, and living in Atlanta, we were all down south. I moved to New York, which is where I\u2019m from originally. Within a year, I met Kip and Reb when they were doing demos and getting rejected from record labels left and right: \u201cYou suck, you suck, no, no, no!. So it was just luck and timing. When I met them, I was up in the offices of a management company. Then, I was leaving, and I didn\u2019t know anybody was still there; Kip and Reb were using some recording gear. I expressed an interest in their music, and they said, okay, we\u2019ll put you on the list of the twenty drummers that want to audition. They called me a few days later and said, \u201cHey, do you want to get together and jam?\u201d Kip had left Alice Cooper by that time. He was doing session work at that time. He played on a Bee Gee\u2019s record and did things like that.\n\nI have understood correctly, lice wanted to change the band\u2019s direction, and that\u2019s why Kip left the band?\n\nI thought Kip just left on his own. They were terrific friends, Kip and Alice.\n\nHow about Jordan Rudess (Dream Theater). You guys have been doing different projects over the years. How did you meet him in the first place?\n\nWell, the Dregs were in the midst of touring in 1994, and our keyboard player wasn\u2019t able to do the last two months of the tour, and none of us had ever heard of Jordan. Until Dream Theater came around, no one had heard of him. He was recommended to us by Jan Hammer, the guy who also made Miami Vice\u2019s music. He\u2019s one of my favorite Keyboard players. So, Jordan sent us one of his solo records, and we were just floored by it. When he came down, we told him that he was in without an audition. Within three days, he learned the whole set just by listening to the songs. He has perfect pitch, he was a child prodigy, and he discovered his genius when he was nine. He came down to Steve Morse\u2019s house, and he played everything perfectly. He would also say things like, \u201cDid you also need me to play the bass line there?\u201d [Laughs] It was unbelievable! The first show that he played with us. We had rehearsed on Thursday, and on Friday, we played a show in Florida. In the middle of the show, the guitar, violin, and bass rigs went down. But, drums can play whether the PA is working or not. And the keyboard PA was still there. So, rather than stop, we just started jamming, and it went on for, I don\u2019t know, five or ten minutes. Everybody\u2019s rigs were then fixed, and we went on to the show. We talked about it afterward and decided that we had to do something together. So, we spent 1995 and 1996 doing the Rudess/Morgenstein CD, which came out at the end of 1997. Every year, he and I managed to do a handful of gigs. Just this past May, we played in Venezuela and Costa Rica. We played with a Brazilian band called Angra, a good band.\n\nThen we headlined in Costa Rica, just keyboards and drums! He is so unbelievable. No keyboard player in the world can do what he does. Almost the entire show is live. It\u2019s not like he presses a button to play a sequence. He programs the keyboard so the sustain pedal knows not to sustain the bass and leaves only the chords. Programs in pitch bends and stuff like that. We\u2019re in the midst of doing another record. We have a lot of it done. So he\u2019s doing that, and he has another Dream Theater and solo record that he\u2019s working on. So, I\u2019ll be doing some of that with him.\n\nI heard a rumor about Dixie Dregs and Kansas going on tour together. Is that true?\n\nThat I have never heard about, the Dregs manager is also the manager of Dream Theater. Actually, I live with him because I\u2019m a professor at Berkley in Boston. He\u2019s been trying for the longest time to get the Dregs out there, hooking us up with bands like King Crimson or something, instead of us doing the clubs\u00ef.\n\nSo that\u2019s not going to happen anytime soon?\n\nNo, it\u2019s not, but that would be awesome.\n\nWell, this will be the very last question. Will you guys be recording any shows from this current Winger tour?\n\nYeah, we were hoping to film a live DVD on this tour, but we\u2019re not good without Cenk. The photo has the five of us, and he\u2019s an essential part of the puzzle. We need to have the keyboards on many tunes plus another vocal because he\u2019s a powerful singer. Our agency is looking for a tour for us in the US where we would have Cenk, and then we could do the live DVD.\n\nThanks for your time Rod!\n\nFOR MORE INFO, GO TO:\n\nWWW.WINGERTHEBAND.COM\n\nWWW.RODMORGENSTEIN.COM\n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO STEFAN FROM ZINK MUSIC AND MIKKO SAUKKONEN FROM BONNIERAMIGO FOR SETTING THIS INTERVIEW UP !!\n\nMORE PICTURES FROM WINGER SHOW IN HELSINKI 2006 !!!"}, {"url": "https://musicxplorer.com/artists/rod-morgenstein-part-two/", "page_content": "Rod Morgenstein\n\nHighlights From Part One\n\nIn Part One, we discussed how Rod met guitarist Steve Morse when he attended the University of Miami in Florida. Steve had everything that Rod was looking for, something different and not doing the standard 4/4 time signature. Rod and Steve eventually formed Dixie Dregs. We also talked about how the band had a rough time getting signed, being turned down, how their music was difficult to market because they were a jazz fusion band with no vocals, odd timing, and that their music combines rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk, and classical influences. The group was finally signed to Capricorn in 1977, and recorded several albums before they temporarily disbanded in 1983. The band has been nominated six times for a Grammy award.\n\nDregs Success and Breakup\n\nIn Part Two, we discuss the ongoing success of the Dixie Dregs, Rod\u2019s career highlights with the band, and funny moments. After the Dregs disbanded in 1983, Rod joined Steve Morse\u2019s new band and stayed for two albums before wanting a musical change. Rod tells us how he came back to the NYC area to look for work and his auditions for George Michael, Billy Idol, Joe Lynn Turner, and others. He talks about being a professor, teaching percussion at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. Recently offering, Drum Set Warm-Ups , touted as the definitive text for developing and improving all aspects of drum-set playing. He is also a columnist for Modern Drummer magazine.\n\nInterview with Rod Morgenstein (Part Two)"}, {"url": "https://www.last.fm/music/Kip+Winger/+wiki", "page_content": "A former bassist of Alice Cooper's band during the mid eighties, Kip Winger went on to form Winger together with guitarist Reb Beach, keyboard/guitarist Paul Taylor and drummer Rod Morgenstein (formerly of Dixie Dregs). Taking the name from its leader, Winger specialized in winning melodic metal formula, with strong influences from bands like Van Halen, AC/DC and Whitesnake\n\nThe band's eponymous debut in 1988 sold over a million copies on the strength of singles like \"Seventeen\" and the ballad \"Headed for a Heartbreak\u201d. Winger\u2019s second album, 1990's \u201cIn The Heart Of The Young\u201d, was slightly more melodic and showed a more mature and technical approach to the songs. It reached an equal success, selling over a million copies and featuring the hit power-ballad \"Miles Away\". Unfortunately the band didn't outlast the post-alternative pop-metal backlash and the group faded away after the release of the critically acclaimed 1993 album \u201cPull\u201d.\n\nAfter Winger went their separate ways, Kip decided to pursue a solo career. He started writing his own songs in a different style than to his previous band and his first album \"Thisconversationseemslikeadream\" was released in 1997, reflecting his new approach to songwriting with a style more akin to Peter Gabriel's music rather than to 80\u2019s Hard Rock.\n\nAn acoustic album of past favourites, \"Down Incognito\" was later released in 1999. Winger followed it with his second studio solo album, 2000's \"Songs from the Ocean Floor\", labelled as \u201cMasterpiece\u201d by several music critics around the world. After another acoustic solo tour Kip started to become involved in several new projects including writing music for movies, singing for Alan Parsons and of course the very successful Winger reunion that materialized in 2006 with the release of \"IV\" and the subsequent world tour.\n\nNow Kip Winger is back with his new solo album \"From the Moon to the Sun\": a true career defining statement and, once again, another cd which witnesses the creative evolution of the American composer.\n\n\u201cI am an artist that will continue to push the envelope into the direction that my ear and abilities are taking me, with no compromise\u201d, says Kip, adding \u201cI worked hard to make this record my best yet. For sure it is musically very diverse\u2026 Hence the title , From the Moon to the Sun\".\n\nThe music offered on the record is truly a flow that has no boundaries, from the fresh rock approach of songs like \u201cEvery Story Told\u201d, \u201cNothing\u201d or \u201cReason To Believe\u201d, to the Pop sensibilities of \u201cWhere Will You Go\u201d and \u201cCalifornia\u201d, to the acoustic mood of \u201cPages and Pages\u201d and \u201cIn Your Eyes Another Life\u201d, down to the unbelievable instrumental piece \u201cGhosts\u201d, \u201cFrom the Moon to the Sun\u201d brings the listener to a journey in a kaleidoscope of different moods.\n\nThe album sees also musical contributions from Rod Morgenstein and Ken Mary on drums, Andy Timmons and Rob Eberhard Young on guitar, Alan Pasqua on piano, Cenk Eroglu on songwriting, keyboards and guitars."}, {"url": "http://www.noplacelikelongisland.com/podcast/2016/6/23/legendary-drummer-rod-morgenstein-on-winger-the-jelly-jam-northport-and-more", "page_content": "How does it work in terms of your scheduling? Do you have your work schedule at Berklee and then plan everything around it?\n\nRM: Part of the high profile of a music college like Berklee, is that it has quite a few staff members who continue to \"live the life.\" What better way is there to inspire young musicians by having them study with active recording and touring musicians?\n\nHow did you wind up being part of the faculty at Berklee?\n\nRM: The Rudess Morgenstein Project was hired to perform at Berklee College of Music in the summer of '97. I received a call from the chairman of the Berklee percussion department a few days after the concert to see if I had ever thought about teaching on a college level and, if so, did I have any interest in filling an open position for the coming year beginning the fall of '97. I decided to check it out, and that one-year position turned out to be a nearly 19-year run, which continues to this day. Teaching at a college was never a part of the \"plan,\" it just happened as a result of playing a concert.\n\nWhat's coming up for your career-wise for the rest of 2016?\n\nRM: The Jelly Jam will release Profit on May 27, and the band will tour beginning mid-July. It will be the first time John Myung, Ty Tabor, and I will be performing on stage together as a band. I'm really looking forward to the experience. Winger will most probably tour in the fall and begin recording a new CD. I will also be back at Berklee come September. In addition, I teach an online class called Rock Drums, which I created for Berklee's online division. It is a three-credit college course and I believe it to be the only course of its kind in the world of cyber teaching.\n\nWhen you're not busy with your work, how do you like to spend your free time?\n\nRM: The nature of being a traveling musician is that you are away from home a good deal of the time. When I am in town, I love hanging at any number of beaches and water settings in this area. And there are quite a few spots to choose from, whether its downtown Northport by the harbor, or at one of the beaches. I love riding my bike to these destinations, as I try to do some kind of physical activity on a regular basis. I am also involved in musical projects outside of the teaching and my bands. And so these activities take up much of my free time. But the thing is, anything music-related to me is more like a hobby, as there is still so much enjoyment involved in creative activities.\n\nDo you have a favorite restaurant on Long Island?\n\nRM: I have so many favorite restaurants because I enjoy most cuisines. So it would be really difficult to choose one favorite. Northport alone has a handful of great places -- the one I'd like to mention, because it has special meaning to me, is The Sweet Shop. Owner Pete Panarites, who is the ex-mayor of the town, makes the most amazing blueberry pancakes.\n\nFinally, Rod, what do you wish more people knew about Long Island?\n\nRM: This is a double-edged sword, as Long Island has so many beautiful destinations, yet there are so many people living here -- probably 5 million or so. And so, in answer to your question, sure, I wish everyone could experience some of the magic Long Island has to offer, but the last thing I think it needs is a larger population.\n\nMy family moved to Plainview just before my first birthday in '53. I moved in '73 when I went to the University of Miami, FL. There, as a music major, I met Steve Morse and The Dixie Dregs who, when we left the college, moved in and around Augusta, GA to get the ball rolling. I moved back up north in '86 when the Dregs and Steve Morse Band went on 'hold until further notice'. In search of the next musical project to get involved with, I moved to NYC, eventually meeting what became Winger. I then moved back to Long Island - Northport - in the fall of '91, where I still reside, because it is the most beautiful town on earth!"}, {"url": "https://ids-water.com/2020/09/07/who-is-in-the-video-headed-for-heartbreak-by-winger/", "page_content": "Who is in the video headed for Heartbreak by winger?\n\nWith Winger, Reb Beach, Patty Harbeck, Rod Morgenstein.

The university was a hotbed of musical activity during this period, playing host to brilliant future talents like Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Danny Gottlieb, T Lavitz and Bruce Hornsby. Playing under the official Studio Music and Jazz curriculum title of Rock Ensemble II, the Dregs honed their fusionesque chops. It was here that the band recorded its classic Great Spectacular album now available on CD.\n\n\n\nThe Dixie Dreg\u2019s music combines rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk and classical influences into rich, ever-changing tapestry of sound. All the while, Rod\u2019s drumming weaves its way seamlessly and colorfully through this swirling musical landscape.\n\n\n\nHis unique, dynamic and musical drumming style has led to Rod\u2019s winning the Best Progressive Rock Drummer award in Modern Drummer Magazine\u2019s Reader\u2019s Poll 5 years in a row (1986-1990) and Best All-Around Drummer (1999), earning him a permanent position in the magazine\u2019s prestigious Honor Roll. The Dixie Dregs, whose last 6 recordings have each received Grammy nominations for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, are best described in the following Philadelphia Inquirer concert review, \u201cThe Dregs have their own unique language and style familiar to bluegrass and country music, refined with classical finesse and delivered with high-powered technology and rock energy. The band is possible the most important, and certainly the most technically advanced, instrumental group in progressive fusion.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen the group temporarily disbanded in 1983, Rod joined forces with Steve Morse who, along with bassist Jerry Peek, formed the Steve Morse Band. Rod remembers, \u201cOne of our biggest breaks came when we had the opportunity to tour for 3 months with Rush on their 1985-1986 Power Windows tour. I felt a surge of popularity, both as a band and as a drummer, as a result of performing night after night in sold out arenas packed with appreciative progressive-rock fans. And it was more than obvious that many of them were drummers.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Steve Morse Band recorded two albums, at which point Rod found himself at a crossroad in his career, as Steve Morse joined the reforming group Kansas. \u201cI was ready for a musical change and to try something both new and challenging.\u201d\n\n\n\nWithin a year of moving to New York City in 1986 after living in and around Atlanta, Georgia, for the previous 11 years, Rod met Kip Winger and Reb Beack, namesake and lead guitarist of the as-of-then-non-existent band Winger. \u201cKip and Reb had been writing and recording demos and forever being rejected by record labels. I met them at a point in their lives where they were completely driven to get signed. Nothing could shake their determination. We got together and jammed, hit it off, and two months later they called to say they got a deal and to see if I\u2019d be interested in doing the record.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe rest is history! Their self-titled debut album in 1988 sold over two million copies worldwide, earning the band a platinum album in the U.S. and gold albums in Japan and Canada. It also led to an American Music Award nomination for Best New Heavy Metal Band. This album was followed by In the Heart of the Young and, once again, platinum and gold awards were in the offing, coupled with non-stop international touring.\n\n\n\nThe band ceased activities in 1993 after touring for the highly acclaimed Pull recording, as dramatic changes were taking place in the music scene. Alternative music had replaced metal as the accepted music of the day.\n\n\n\nAnd so, Kip Winger set out to record his first solo album, This Conversation Seems Like Dream (1997), a dramatic departure from the first three Winger recordings, drawing heavily on world percussive rhythms, dark imagery and heavy grooves. Rod recorded the drum tracks for this album and the more recent Songs From The Ocean Floor (2001) at Kip\u2019s home studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n\n\n1997 also saw the self-titled debut release by the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, an instrumental progressive power-duo, featuring Rod and Dream Theater keyboardist extraordinaire Jordan Rudess. The seed for this project was planted one evening on the Dixie Dregs 1994 Full Circle tour in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when a sudden power failure shut down the guitar, bass and violin rigs. For whatever reason, the keyboards remained unaffected. And what followed was a blistering, 10 minute drum/keyboard power-duo jam, which brought down the house. It was that evening\u2019s events, which inspired Rod and Jordan to form their \u201csmall in numbers yet mighty in sound\u201d band\n\n\n\nOther on-going projects that Rod is involved with are jam band Jazz Is Dead which features creative improvisations of the music by the Grateful Dead. Members of JID have included T Lavitz, Alphonso Johnson, Jeff Sipe, Billy Cobham and Jimmy Herring, with an ever-changing line up. Another project is Platypus, whose two recordings feature John Myung (Dream Theater), Ty Tabor (King\u2019s X) and Derek Sherinian (Planet X). The music is a mix of instrumental and vocal tunes that blend many different styles together. And offshoot of Platypus is Jelly Jam, a power trio featuring Rod, Ty Tabor and John Myung. Their first release is due out in 2001.\n\n\n\nIn addition to his recording and touring credits, Rod is very active in drum education. He is currently an Associate Professor of Percussion at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Mass. Also, his highly recognized instructional materials include videos, audio cassettes and books. His most recent offering is Drum Set Warm-Ups, touted as the definitive text for developing and improving all aspects of drum set playing. Additionally, Rod has been a columnist for Modern Drummer Magazine (U.S.), Rhythm Magazine (UK), Sticks Magazine (Germany) and is an international clinician and involved with product development for Premier Percussion (Rod Morgenstein Signature Drumheads), Sabian Cymbals (Signature Tri-Top Ride), and Vic Firth Sticks (Signature Sticks and Isolation Headphones), with whom he has been and endorser for many, many years.\n\n\n\nRod can be summed up in the following passage from a cover story in Modern Drummer Magazine: \u201cYou can see it in his face; Rod Morgenstein loves what he does for a living. Get him talking about drums and you\u2019ll see those eyes start to crinkle as a warm, sincere smile spreads over his face. Get him behind a set of drums, and the same enthusiasm is evident in the way that he tears into the kit as though he\u2019s been waiting for weeks to get at it. That\u2019s not to imply that his playing is uncontrolled, because he is definitely in charge of everything that is happening on the drum set. It\u2019s just to say that you never get the sense that Morgenstein has lost any of the initial excitement about the drums that makes people become drummers to begin with.\u201d\n\n"}]}
