Erin was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare cancer of the soft muscle tissue.\n\n\u201cAs a result of losing Erin that day, we\u2019ve been giving our time and funds and effort to try to change the world for these children that fight cancer,\u201d Vallely said.\n\nThe UCLA Hall of Famer fought a long battle of non-Hodgkins lymphoma himself in 2003, pulling inspiration from his daughter\u2019s perseverance in his long journey to remission.\n\nAfter undergoing multiple rounds of stem cell treatment, Vallely decided that serving as a longtime member on the board of directors for the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation wasn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201c(Vallely) had this idea,\u201d said Ashley Armstrong, an associate athletic director. \u201cAnd so he brought it to me and (Director of Athletics Dan Guerrero) and talked about wanting to partner with the basketball programs.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Dribble for the Cure debuted as an annual event hosted by UCLA. PCRF, the Cancer Research Program at Mattel Children\u2019s Hospital and UCLA Athletics put on the event for kids, students and families.\n\n\u201c(Guerrero) kind of left it up to me to decide how we wanted to do the event,\u201d Armstrong said. She was the director of student-athlete development at the time.\n\nParticipants receive pledges to raise money for pediatric cancer by dribbling a 1-mile course from Drake Stadium to Pauley Pavilion.\n\nDribble for the Cure has brought in $1,464,350 from 7,425 participants over the past 10 years. Participants raised just over $80,000 in the event\u2019s inaugural year, but has since increased in proceeds each year.\n\nSt. John\u2019s University \u2013 the only other institution that currently hosts the event \u2013 held its eighth Dribble for the Cure on Sept. 22 and has raised over $500,000 since it first ran the event in 2011.\n\nThe money raised is split evenly between PCRF and the Cancer Research Program at Mattel Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nUCLA\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball players have also played an integral role in the event, dribbling the course with the participants and signing autographs at the end.\n\n\u201cOver the last 11 years, we\u2019ve had different coaches (both men\u2019s and women\u2019s),\u201d said Ric Coy, the current director of student-athlete development. \u201cEach coach that we have brought in has totally been happily involved in this event because they see the purpose of it.\u201d\n\nCoy has been assisting Armstrong in Dribble for the Cure since 2008, but took over coordinating duties in 2016. This will be Coy\u2019s third year leading the event.\n\nStudent-athlete participation has also grown. About 100 student-athletes from men\u2019s volleyball, women\u2019s water polo and gymnastics participated in 2017. \u201cThey may not be fundraising,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cBut they\u2019re there to help out with registration, they\u2019re painting faces, they\u2019re handing out goodies, they\u2019re hanging out with the kids and participating some way in the event.\u201d\n\nOther student groups including Bruins Fighting Pediatric Cancer as well as fraternities and sororities have participated in previous years. Armstrong said local middle schools and high schools have also been participating.\n\nUCLA\u2019s 11th annual Dribble for the Cure will be held on Sunday, coincidentally falling on what would have been coach John Wooden\u2019s 108th birthday.\n\nVallely, who came to UCLA as a junior transfer out of Orange Coast College, played on Wooden\u2019s 1969 and 1970 championship teams, and was picked by the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the 1970 NBA Draft.\n\n\u201cCoach (Wooden) taught us that finding the true meaning of success in our lives would be more important than probably anything we would ever do on the basketball court,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cSo I think he would be thrilled that anything was happening in relationship to him as it relates to giving others.\u201d\n\nKids will be given backpacks with the words \u201cHappy Birthday, Coach Wooden\u201d on them to honor the former UCLA coach Sunday.\n\nAs 12 year olds dribble toward Pauley Pavilion this weekend, their efforts will make strides in the fight against pediatric cancer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve managed to help improve the survival rate in children,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cSo it\u2019s kind of cool to know that we\u2019ve had a hand in that.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://uclabruins.com/news/2021/6/29/bruin-athletics-ucla-athletic-hall-of-fame-class-of-2021-revealed.aspx", "page_content": "Eight outstanding Bruins will join the UCLA Athletic Hall of Fame in the Class of 2021.

His thoughts and ideas were professional, educational and inspirational. The thing i liked the most was that he stayed the entire meeting and joined us for every meeting.....as well as social events, getting to know as many of our leaders as possible. I know our team appreciated his thoughts, and i have heard many comments about how everyone was impressed that he hung around for the entire meeting.\u201d Gary Robinette President & CEO\n\nPly Gem Industries, Inc. \u201cIt is with great pleasure and respect that I write a testimonial for Mr. John Vallely. As a fellow Bruin I had the great opportunity to watch John play, and the honor of sneaking in a listen to Coach Wooden whenever I could. As Coach inspired me, and unbeknownst to him gave me a path to follow for my life, I never thought that in my post UCLA days I would ever hear a more eloquent, wise, and thoughtful intellect. I was wrong. John Vallely is a living breathing testimonial on actually living the \u2018Pyramid of Success\u2019. During times of incredible adversity and heartbreak, he and his family have emerged through it all with unbelievable courage and faith, and he gives all who he comes in contact with, that same magnificent gift of hope through purpose. Although his modesty would probably not permit him from believing this, John Vallely to me stands at the apex of The Pyramid of Success, because he truly encompasses the ideal of being the best that he is capable of becoming. Thank you for being a true inspiration. P.S. Thanks to your son Eric who epitomizes your personal success, and is a realization of God\u2019s greatest gift to all of us who are blessed to be fathers.\u201d Gary Barragan Director of Administration/HR \"I've had the pleasure of meeting many great UCLA student-athletes. I have found them to also be great people, many of whom display with abundance such qualities as competitive fire, sportsmanship, heart, inspiration, leadership, and social conscience. Some of them combine all such attributes and employ them in unique and substantive ways. Indeed, the ones that do are the truly special individuals who not only make you proud to watch them, but to know them. These are the superstars who use their athletic achievements as not only building blocks, but as stepping stones to life's grander assignments. John Vallely is one such person, a man who knows how to win in life...the right way. You'll not only enjoy, but be entertained and empowered by his words and message. I am every time\". Dan Guerrero Director of Athletics\n\nUCLA\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this letter is to recommend John Vallely as an excellent public speaker. As a former teammate, I have heard him on a number of occasions, including most recently at his induction into the UCLA Hall of Fame Induction ceremony in October of 2006. He has a good message and story to tell of his own life experiences that tie into his many accomplishments in life. He has experienced many highs athletically and in his personal life, many lows. During his speech at the Hall of Fame Induction one could hear a pin drop to the floor as he covered some of the difficult parts of his life\u2019s journey.\n\n\n\nWhen one has reached the pinnacle of accomplishments athletically in basketball and beach volleyball and seen the lows in life, it is a truly compelling story. He conveys this concisely and articulately in a straightforward manner without needless whining or complaining. It is indeed inspiring to hear\". Lynn Shackelford \u201cI was uplifted by the humble message and giant heart of an athlete who has walked the walk of cancer that stole the life of his precious young daughter, Erin; yet later spared his own.\n\n\n\nI am grateful and forever changed as I journeyed in spirit with the dynamic John Vallely. The depth of his experience and good humor enlightens the struggles, doubt, loss, restored hope, triumphs, and convictions that he and we all may face as we each seek to make sense of life.\n\n\n\nJohn made me cry, he made me laugh, and he touched my soul. Give yourself the warming gift of his message--it's awesome--it will renew you!\u201d Deedreea Rich, DDS Newport Beach, California \u201cJohn's speech at his induction into the UCLA Hall of Fame was one of the most inspirational I have ever heard. It's obvious that John's passion for life and his belief in the \"Pyramid of Success\" has served him well from the glory days at UCLA to the unimaginable pain of losing a child to cancer. He tells his life story with heartfelt candor and wit, including examples of how the many facets of the \"Pyramid\" shape his daily life. I feel honored to have John as a friend, and thank him for one of the most entertaining evenings I have ever experienced.\u201d Dee DeVaney Retired Airline Pilot\n\n\u201cJohn's story moves his listeners to both tears and laughter, and his ability to weave his life's message around John Wooden's Pyramid of Success is masterful. From the pinnacles of athletic success, to the depths of despair over the death of his beautiful 12 year old daughter, to his own two life-and-death struggles with lymphoma, his faith has been shaken, renewed, and then solidified. John's commitment to useing the Pyramid of Success to face and overcome life's adversites is truly inspirational.\u201d Bob Kendall, Self-employed Mathematics Tutor Karen Kendall, School Administrator \u201cNever have I been so proud. You were on fire last night.That was the greatest moment in the history not only of UCLA Basketball but in the history of Western civilization. You have changed my life. You are an unbelievable humanitarian. I want to thank you for everything, John. You are up there with Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu, Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and John Vallely. The list is endless. Oh my gosh! What a performance! Forget the jump shot, forget the rebounds, forget the defense, forget the leadership, what you did last night was the greatest thing that any man has ever done in this world as we know it. Intergalactic transmission is the next order of the day. Please, Lets get it going. I have never been so proud. I have been 6ft 11 since I was 19 yrs old; today I have broken the 7 ft. barrier.

John wove the concept of team building and relationships into everything he said and presented a talk that was interesting and motivational at the same time. Best of all, he did his homework about the group he was speaking to and included specific references about them in his talk. This personalized presentation was impressive. We have already asked him to return for two more events.\u201d Volunteer Endowment for Patient Support MD Anderson \u201cAs the speaker chairman for the Breakfast Club of Newport Beach, I can confidently say that John's presentation deeply touched everyone in our group on many levels. In telling his life's story, his ability to blend his humility, strength and humor was powerful. What our group especially appreciated was the way John wove the principles of the great John Wooden into his own life in a such an honest manner that any one could relate, even a die-hard Trojan like myself. He is truly a terrific communicator of John Wooden's principles and of his own hard won wisdom.\u201d Bob Bernatz, Ph.D. President \u2013 InsightGlobal \u201cI am grateful that John Vallely participated as one of the Distinguished Speaker\u2019s for the Volcom University. His willingness to speak to our employees and share how we may achieve competitive greatness through \u201cThe Pyramid of Success\u201d was both humbling and a learning experience. I appreciated his intimate stories and personal life experiences, proving how successful this tool has been in his life. I truly believe that everyone who attended felt inspired and learned some tips on how they could individually reach competitive greatness at work and in their personal lives. What a terrific and moving message and I would recommend anyone who wants to be motivated to listen to John speak.\u201d Tara Bennett Sr. Director of the People\u2019s Department\n\nVolcom, Inc."}, {"url": "https://amickamookandamic.com/2022/04/john-vallely-2x-ucla-basketball-champion-joins-mick-mook-on-4-13/", "page_content": "Frank & Billy are looking forward to a visit from the legendary UCLA basketball star and a first round pick in the NBA draft, John Vallely, on the April 13th episode of A Mick A Mook and A Mic.\n\nVallely, a former NBA player and 2x NCAA Basketball Champion, was a star and All-American for the John Wooden led UCLA Bruins.
