It's easy to fear your child getting hurt, getting in over their head, being manipulated, or heartbroken, and especially, growing up and leaving the nest. But as uncomfortable or scary as it may feel to consider your child with a romantic life, remember that this is a normal, healthy, and necessary part of any young adult's emotional development.\n\nHow Teen Dating Has Changed\n\nBut what exactly does teen dating even look like these days? The general idea may be the same as it's always been, but the way teens date has changed quite a bit from just a decade or so ago.\n\nClearly, the explosion of social media and ever-present cellphones are two of the biggest influences on the changing world of teen dating\u2014kids don't even need to leave their bedrooms to \"hang out.\"\n\nTruths About Teen Dating\n\nThis quickly morphing social landscape makes it more challenging for parents to keep up, figure out how to talk with their teens about dating, and establish rules that will keep them safe. To help you navigate this unfamiliar territory, there are 12 essential truths every parent should know about the teen dating scene.\n\nTeen Romance Is Normal\n\nWhile some teens start dating earlier than others, romantic interests are normal and healthy during adolescence. Some kids are more overt or vocal about their interest in dating but most are paying attention and intrigued by the prospect of a romantic life, even if they keep it to themselves.\n\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services, dating helps teens build social skills and grow emotionally. Interestingly, teens \"date\" less now than they did in the past. This is perhaps due in part to the influx of cell phones and virtual social interactions and the changing ways teens define their relationships.\n\nIn 1991, only 14% of high school seniors did not date, while by 2013 that number had jumped to 38%. Of kids aged 13 to 17, around 35% have some experience with romantic relationships and 19% are in a relationship at any one time.\n\nBut regardless of when it starts, the truth is that most teens\u2014especially as they make their way through high school and college\u2014are eventually going to be interested in dating. When they start dating, you\u2019ll need to be ready by establishing expectations and opening a caring and supportive dialogue about these topics.\n\nDating Builds Relationship Skills\n\nJust like starting any new phase of life, entering the world of dating is both exciting and scary\u2014for kids and their parents alike. Kids will need to put themselves out there by expressing romantic interest in someone else, risking rejection, figuring out how to be a dating partner, and what exactly that means.\n\nNew skills in the realms of communication, caring, thoughtfulness, intimacy, and independence collide with a developing sexuality, limited impulse control, and the urge to push boundaries. But despite these challenges, your teen is learning how to interact with others.\n\nTeens May Have Unrealistic Expectations\n\nYour teen may also have some unrealistic ideas about dating based on what they've seen online, in the movies, or read in books. Real-life dating doesn't mimic a teen Netflix or Disney movie\u2014or porn and it is important that your teen understands that.\n\nInstead, first dates may be awkward or they may not end in romance. Dates may be in a group setting or even via Snapchat\u2014but the feelings are just as real. Help your teen know what to expect and to not have expectations that are unrealistic.\n\nSocial Media Plays a Role\n\nToday's teens spend a lot of time texting and messaging potential love interests on social media. For some, this approach can make dating easier because they can test the waters and get to know one another online first.\n\nFor those teens who are shy, meeting in person can be more awkward, especially because kids spend so much time tied to their electronics at the expense of face-to-face communication. Understand that early dating is your teen's chance to work on these life skills. They may make mistakes and/or get hurt but ideally, they will also learn from those experiences.\n\nUnderstand the role that social media plays, but also encourage them to hang out with people in person as well. Just make sure they are aware that not everyone is who they say they are online.\n\nYour Teen Needs \"The Talk\"\n\nIt's important to talk to your teen about a variety of dating topics, such as personal values, expectations, and peer pressure. Be open with your teen about everything from treating someone else with respect to your\u2014and their\u2014beliefs around sexual activity.\n\nIt can be helpful to outline for your kids what early dating may be like for them. Even if your perspective is a bit outdated, sharing it can get the conversation started. Ask them what they have in mind about dating and what questions they may have. Possibly share some of your own experiences.\n\nTalk about the basics too, like how to behave when meeting a date's parents or how to be respectful while you're on a date. Make sure your teen knows to show courtesy by being on time and not texting friends throughout the date.\n\nBe Sure to Discuss Consent With Your Teen\n\nGo over the topics of consent, feeling safe and comfortable, and honoring their own and the other person's feelings. Most importantly, tell them what you expect in terms of being respectful of their dating partner and vice versa.\n\nTalk about what to do if a date behaves disrespectfully or engages in abusive or controlling behavior. You also should talk to your child about safe sex and that they (and their partner) have the right to say no.\n\nExpect that your child may feel uncomfortable talking about this stuff with you (and may even be explicitly resistant) but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't try. Offer advice, a caring ear, and an open shoulder.\n\nDon't assume they've learned what they need to know from sex ed, movies, and their friends\u2014tell them everything you think they should know, even the obvious stuff. They probably have questions (but may not ask them), and they've likely picked up misinformation along the way that needs to be corrected.\n\nYour Teen Is Discovering Who They Are\n\nAdditionally, don't assume you know (or should choose) the type (or gender) of the person your child will want to date. You might see your child with a sporty, clean-cut kid or a teen from their newspaper club, but they may express interest in someone else entirely.\n\nThis is their time to experiment and figure out what and who they are interested in. Plus, we all know that the more you push, the more they'll pull. Your child may be interested in someone that you would never pick for them but aim to be as supportive as you can as long as it's a healthy, respectful relationship.\n\nBe open to the fact that sexuality and gender are a spectrum and many kids won't fall into the traditional boxes\u2014or fit the exact expectations their parents have for them. Love your child no matter what.\n\nPrivacy Is Essential\n\nYour parenting values, your teen's maturity level, and the specific situation will help you determine how much chaperoning your teen needs. Having an eyes-on policy might be necessary and healthy in some circumstances but teens also need a growing amount of independence and the ability to make their own choices.\n\nAim to offer your teen at least a little bit of privacy. Don't listen in on phone calls or eavesdrop on private chats, and don't read every social media message. Keep tabs on what you can, especially if you have any concerns about what is going on but allow for space as well. You can certainly follow your child's public posts on social media. You'll need to follow your instincts on how closely to supervise what your child is doing.\n\nInviting your child to bring their friends and dates to your house is another good strategy as you will get a better sense of the dynamic of the group or couple. Plus, if your child thinks you genuinely want to get to know their friends or romantic partners and aren't hostile to them, they are more likely to open up to you\u2014and possibly, less likely to engage in questionable behavior.\n\nYour Teen Needs Guidance\n\nWhile it's not healthy to get too wrapped up in your teen's dating life, there may be times when you'll have to intervene. If you overhear your teen saying mean comments or using manipulative tactics, speak up. Similarly, if your teen is on the receiving end of unhealthy behavior, it's important to step in and help out.\n\nThere's a small window of time between when your teen begins dating and when they're going to be entering the adult world. Aim to provide guidance that can help them succeed in their future relationships. Whether they experience some serious heartbreak, or they're a heart breaker, adolescence is when teens begin to learn about romantic relationships firsthand.\n\nTalk openly with your child about sex, how to know what they're ready for, and safe sex.\n\nYour Teen Needs Safety Rules\n\nAs a parent, your job is to keep your child safe and to help them learn the skills they need to navigate healthy relationships. As your teen matures, they should require fewer dating rules. But rules for your teen should be based on their behavior, not necessarily their age.\n\nIf they aren't honest about their activities or don't abide by their curfew or other rules, they may lack the maturity to have more freedom (as long as your rules are reasonable). Tweens and younger teens will need more rules as they likely aren't able to handle the responsibilities of a romantic relationship yet.\n\n\n\nGet to know anyone your teen wants to date. Establish the expectation that you'll be introduced before a date, whatever you want that to look like. You can always start by meeting their date at your home, say for dinner, before allowing your teen to go out on a date alone.\n\nMake dating without a chaperone a privilege. For younger teens, inviting a romantic interest to the house may be the extent of dating. Or you can drive your teen and their date to the movies or a public place. Older teens are likely to want to go out on dates without a chauffeur or chaperone. Make that a privilege that can be earned as long as your teen exhibits trustworthy behavior.\n\nYour Teen May Meet Their Dates Online\n\nCreate clear guidelines about online romance. Many teens talk online, which can easily develop into a false sense of intimacy. Consequently, they're more likely to meet people they've chatted with, but never met because they don't view them as strangers. Create clear rules about online dating and stay up to date on any apps your teen might be tempted to use, like Tinder.\n\nDiscuss technology dangers, like sexting. Sometimes, teens are tempted to comply with a date\u2019s request to send nude photos. Unfortunately, these photos can become public very quickly and unsuspecting teens can end up hurt, shamed, or embarrassed. Establish clear cellphone rules that will help your teen make good decisions.\n\nMake sure they understand that anything put online is forever and that sending a nude photo can easily backfire\u2014and be shared with unintended recipients.\n\nTeen's Need Boundaries\n\nKnow your teen's itinerary. Make sure you have a clear itinerary for your teen\u2019s date. Insist your teen contact you if the plan changes. If you feel it's needed, you can set up tracking apps on your child's phone so you'll always know where they are.\n\nEstablish a clear curfew. Make it clear you need to know the details of who your teen will be with, where they will be going, and who will be there. Establish a clear curfew as well. Your child may rail against these rules but may also feel comforted by them\u2014not that they will tell you that.\n\nSet age limits. In some states, teens can legally date anyone they want once they reach 16, but in other states, they don\u2019t have that choice until they turn 18. But, legal issues aside, there\u2019s usually a big difference in maturity level between a 14-year-old and an 18-year-old. So, set some rules about the acceptable dating age range.\n\n\n\nKnow who is at home at the other person's house. If your teen is going to a date\u2019s home, find out who will be home. Have a conversation with the date\u2019s parents to talk about their rules.\n\nA Word From Verywell\n\nConsider that how you parent your teen during this new stage can have big ramifications on their future relationships (romantic and otherwise), the lifestyle choices they make, and the mature adult they become. The more open and supportive you can be with them, the better. After all, if something does go awry, you'll want them to know that you're always in their corner."}, {"url": "https://courses.lumenlearning.com/adolescent/chapter/dating/", "page_content": "Teen Dating\n\nHealthy relationships in adolescence can help shape a young person\u2019s identity and prepare teens for more positive relationships during adulthood. Providing adolescents with tools to start and maintain healthy relationships (with romantic partners as well as peers, employers, teachers, and parents) may have a positive influence on young people\u2019s overall development.\n\nThe Role of Healthy Romantic and Dating Relationships\n\nAdolescents tend to become more interested in dating around their mid-teens and become more involved in dating relationships during high school. Although dating does increase during this time, it is also normal for adolescents not to be in a relationship. Nearly two-thirds of teens (ages 13-17) have not been in a dating or romantic relationship. Thirty-five percent of teens (ages 13-17) have some experience with romantic relationships, and 19 percent are currently in a relationship. Older teens (ages 15-17) are more likely than younger teens to have experience with romantic relationships (Lenhart et al., 2015).\n\nAdolescents date less now than they did in the past. This change is most striking for 12th-grade students, where the percentage of youth who did not date increased from 14 percent in 1991 to 38 percent in 2013. Adolescent sexual activity also has decreased from previous decades (Child Trends Databank, 2015). The percentage of U.S. high school students who had ever had sex decreased from 54 percent in 1992 to 40 percent in 2017 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018).\n\nExperiencing healthy dating relationships does have benefits to adolescent development. Knowing how to establish and maintain healthy romantic relationships can help adolescents grow. Healthy dating during the teenage years can be an essential way to develop social skills, learn about other people, and grow emotionally. These relationships also can play a role in supporting youth\u2019s ability to develop positive relationships in other areas, including: in school, with employers, and with partners during adulthood.\n\nBoth male and female youth value intimacy, closeness, and emotional investment in romantic relationships. These relationships can be accompanied by extreme excitement and happiness, but also by disappointment and sadness. However, some youth might go beyond the normal range of emotions and may experience depression.\n\nWhile meeting partners online has been growing in popularity and is becoming more common among adults, few teens meet their romantic partners online. In 2015, only 8 percent of all teenagers had met a romantic partner online. Of course, many teens have never dated anyone, but among those with dating experience, 24 percent dated or hooked up with someone they first met online. Among this 24 percent, half of the teens had met just one romantic partner online, while the other half had met more than one partner online (Lenhart et al., 2015).\n\nTeen Dating Violence\n\nHealthy relationships consist of trust, honesty, respect, equality, and compromise. Unfortunately, teen dating violence\u2014the type of intimate partner violence that occurs between two young people who are, or who were once in, an intimate relationship\u2014is a serious problem in the United States. Teen dating violence can take place in person or electronically, such as repeated texting or posting sexual pictures of a partner online without consent. Unhealthy relationships can start early and last a lifetime. Teens often think some behaviors, like teasing and name-calling, are a \u201cnormal\u201d part of a relationship\u2014but these behaviors can become abusive and develop into serious forms of violence. However, many teens do not report unhealthy behaviors because they are afraid to tell family and friends.\n\nA national survey found that ten percent of teens, 1 in 11 females and 1 in 15 males, had been the victims of physical dating violence within the past year. Approximately 29 percent of adolescents reported being verbally or psychologically abused within the previous year. About 1 in 9 female and 1 in 36 male high school students report having experienced sexual dating violence in the last year. The burden of teen dating violence is not shared equally across all groups\u2014sexual minority groups are disproportionately affected by all forms of violence, and some racial/ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected by many types of violence.\n\nAs for perpetration rates, there are currently no nationwide estimates for who does the abusing, and state estimates vary significantly. In South Carolina, for example, nearly 8 percent of adolescents reported being physically violent to a romantic partner. Interestingly, the rates of reported victimization versus perpetration in the state were similar for boys and girls. However, when it comes to severe teen dating violence \u2014 including sexual and physical assault \u2014 girls were disproportionately the victims\n\nResearch on teen dating violence has found that girls and boys perpetrate the same frequency of physical aggression in romantic relationships. This finding was at odds with common perceptions and the experience of practitioners that work with these youth. Practitioners overwhelmingly report encountering female victims and hear that males are the primary perpetrators.\n\nTeen Dating Violence Requires a Different Framework\n\nBecause teen dating violence has only recently been recognized as a significant public health problem, the complex nature of this phenomenon is not fully understood. Although research on rates of perpetration and victimization exists, research that examines the problem from a longitudinal perspective and considers the dynamics of teen romantic relationships is lacking. Consequently, those in the field have to rely on an adult framework to examine the problem of teen dating violence.\n\nHowever, we find that this adult framework does not take into account key differences between adolescent and adult romantic relationships. Thus, to help further the discussion, we offer in this article a gender-based analysis of teen dating violence with a developmental perspective. We look at what we know \u2014 and what we do not know \u2014 about who is the perpetrator and who is the victim in teen dating violence. We also discuss how adult and adolescent romantic relationships differ in the hope that an examination of existing research will help us better understand the problem and move the field toward the creation of developmentally appropriate prevention programs and effective interventions for teenagers.\n\nVictims and Perpetrators: What the Research Says\n\nIn 2001-2005, Peggy Giordano and her colleagues at Bowling Green State University interviewed more than 1,300 seventh, ninth and 11th graders in Toledo, Ohio. More than half of the girls in physically aggressive relationships said both they and their dating partner committed aggressive acts during the relationship. About a third of the girls said they were the sole perpetrators, and 13 percent reported that they were the sole victims. Almost half of the boys in physically aggressive relationships reported mutual aggression, nearly half reported they were the sole victim, and 6 percent reported that they were the sole perpetrator.\n\nThese findings are generally consistent with another study that looked at more than 1,200 Long Island, N.Y., high school students who were currently dating. In that 2007 survey, 66 percent of boys and 65 percent of girls who were involved in physically aggressive relationships reported mutual aggression (O\u2019Leary et al., 2008). Twenty-eight percent of the girls said that they were the sole perpetrator; 5 percent said they were the sole victim. These numbers were reversed for the boys: 5 percent said they were the sole perpetrator, 27 percent the sole victim.\n\nIn a third study, teen couples were videotaped while performing a problem-solving task. Researchers later reviewed the tapes and identified acts of physical aggression that occurred between the boys and girls during the exercise. They found that 30 percent of all the participating couples demonstrated physical aggression by both partners. In 17 percent of the participating couples, only the girls perpetrated physical aggression, and in 4 percent, only the boys were perpetrators (Capaldi et al., 2007). The findings suggest that boys are less likely to be physically aggressive with a girl when someone else can observe their behavior.\n\nFigure 11.5.1. Statistics on the perpetration of physical teen violence by gender.\n\nConsidered together, the findings from these three studies reveal that frequently there is mutual physical aggression by girls and boys in romantic relationships. However, when it comes to motivations for using violence, and the consequences of being a victim of teen dating violence, the differences between the sexes are pronounced. Although both boys and girls report that anger is the primary motivating factor for using violence, girls also commonly report self-defense as a motivating factor, and boys also commonly cite the need to exert control. Boys are also more likely to react with laughter when their partner is physically aggressive. Girls experiencing teen dating violence are more likely than boys to suffer long-term negative behavioral and health consequences, including suicide attempts, depression, cigarette smoking, and marijuana use.\n\nApplying Adult Perspectives to Teen Dating Violence\n\nWhy do teenagers commit violence against each other in romantic relationships? We have already touched on the existing body of research on perpetration and victimization rates. Nevertheless, there is not a great deal of research that uses a longitudinal perspective or that considers the dynamics of teen romantic relationships. As a result, practitioners and researchers in the field tend to apply an adult intimate partner violence framework when examining the problem of teen dating violence.\n\nA split currently exists, however, among experts in the adult intimate partner violence arena. Some experts hold that men and women are mutually combative and that this behavior should be seen as part of a larger pattern of family conflict. Supporters of this view generally cite studies that use \u201cact\u201d scales, which measure the number of times a person perpetrates or experiences certain acts, such as pushing, slapping, or hitting. These studies tend to show that women report perpetrating slightly more physical violence than men. It is interesting to note that most studies on teen dating violence that have been conducted to date have relied primarily on \u201cact\u201d scales.\n\nAnother group of experts holds that men generally perpetrate serious intimate partner violence against women. They contend that men in patriarchal societies use violence to exert and maintain power and control over women. These experts also maintain that \u201cact\u201d scales do not accurately reflect the nature of violence in intimate relationships because they do not consider the degree of injury inflicted, coercive and controlling behaviors, the fear induced, or the context in which the acts occurred. Studies using \u201cact\u201d scales, they contend, lack information on power and control and emphasize the more common and relatively minor forms of aggression rather than more severe, relatively rare forms of violence in dating and intimate partner relationships. Instead, supporters of this perspective use data on injuries and in-depth interviews with victims and perpetrators.\n\nWe believe, however, that applying either of these adult perspectives to adolescents is problematic. Although both views of adult intimate partner violence can help inform our understanding of teen dating violence, it is important to consider how adolescent romantic relationships differ from adult romantic relationships in several key areas.\n\nHow Teen Dating Violence Differs: Equal Power\n\nOne difference between adolescent and adult relationships is the absence of elements traditionally associated with greater male power in adult relationships. Adolescent girls are not typically dependent on romantic partners for financial stability, and they are less likely to have children to provide for and protect.\n\nThe study of seventh, ninth and 11th graders in Toledo (Giordano, 2007), for example, found that a majority of the boys and girls who were interviewed said they had a relatively \u201cequal say\u201d in their romantic relationships. In cases in which there was a power imbalance, they were more likely to say that the female had more power in the relationship. Overall, the study found that the boys perceived that they had less power in the relationship than the girls did. Interestingly, males involved in relationships in which one or both partners reported physical aggression had a perception of less power than males in relationships without physical aggression. Meanwhile, the girls reported no perceived difference in power regardless of whether their relationships included physical aggression.\n\nIt is interesting to note that adults who perpetrate violence against family members often see themselves as powerless in their relationships. This dynamic has yet to be adequately explored among teen dating partners.\n\nLack of Relationship Experience\n\nA second key factor that distinguishes violence in adult relationships from violence in adolescent relationships is the lack of experience teens have in negotiating romantic relationships. Inexperience in communicating and relating to a romantic partner may lead to the use of poor coping strategies, including verbal and physical aggression. A teen who has difficulty expressing himself or herself may turn to aggressive behaviors (sometimes in play) to show affection, frustration, or jealousy. A recent study in which boys and girls participated in focus groups on dating found that physical aggression sometimes stemmed from an inability to communicate feelings and a lack of constructive ways to deal with frustration.\n\nAs adolescents develop into young adults, they become more realistic and less idealistic about romantic relationships. They have a greater capacity for closeness and intimacy. Holding idealistic beliefs about romantic relationships can lead to disillusionment and ineffective coping mechanisms when conflict emerges. It also seems reasonable to expect that physical aggression may be more common when adolescents have not fully developed their capacity for intimacy, including their ability to communicate.\n\nThe Influence of Peers\n\nWe would be remiss to try to understand teen behavior and not consider the profound influence of friends. Peers exert more influence on each other during their adolescent years than at any other time. Research has confirmed that peer attitudes and behaviors are critical influences on teens\u2019 attitudes and behaviors related to dating violence.\n\nNot only are friends more influential in adolescence than in adulthood, but they are also more likely to be \u201con the scene\u201d and a key element in a couple\u2019s social life. In fact, roughly half of adolescent dating violence occurs when a third party is present. Relationship dynamics often play out in a very public way because teens spend a large portion of their time in school and in groups. For various reasons, a boyfriend or girlfriend may act very differently when in the presence of peers, a behavior viewed by adolescents as characteristic of an unhealthy relationship. For example, boys in one focus group study said that if a girl hit them in front of their friends, they would need to hit her back to \u201csave face.\u201d\n\nConflict over how much time is spent with each other versus with friends, jealousies stemming from too much time spent with a friend of the opposite sex, and new romantic possibilities are all part of the social fabric of adolescence. Although \u201cnormal\u201d from a developmental perspective, navigating such issues can cause conflict and, for some adolescents, lead to aggressive responses and problematic coping strategies, such as stalking, psychological or verbal abuse, and efforts to gain control.\n\nRisk Factors for Teen Dating Violence Victimization\n\nFindings suggest that the frequency and severity of teen dating violence increase with age. In addition, the likelihood of being subjected to violence in a relationship increases for teens who:\n\nExperience stressful life events or show symptoms of trauma (including a history of sexual abuse or prior sexual victimization).\n\nLive in poverty, come from disadvantaged homes, or receive child protective services.\n\nAre exposed to community or neighborhood violence.\n\nParticipate in risky behaviors (e.g., substance abuse, alcohol use, violence).\n\nBegin dating at an early age.\n\nParticipate in sexual activity before age 16.\n\nHave problem behaviors in other areas.\n\nHave a friend involved in dating violence.\n\nParticipate in peer violence or have violent friends.\n\nBelieve that dating violence is acceptable or is more accepting of rape myths and violence against women.\n\nBegin menstruating at an early age (for women).\n\nHave been exposed to harsh parenting, inconsistent discipline, or lack supervision, monitoring, and warmth.\n\nHave low self-esteem, anger, or depressed mood.\n\nUse emotional disengagement and confrontational blaming as coping mechanisms.\n\nExhibit maladaptive or antisocial behaviors.\n\nHave aggressive conflict-management styles.\n\nHave low help-seeking proclivities.\n\nRisk Factors for Teen Dating Violence Perpetration\n\nIn addition to the issues discussed above, there are additional factors that are associated with teen dating violence perpetration include:\n\nBelieving that it is acceptable to use threats or violence to get one\u2019s way or to express frustration or anger.\n\nProblems managing anger or frustration.\n\nAssociation with violent peers.\n\nLow self-esteem and depression.\n\nNot having parental supervision and support.\n\nWitnessing violence at home or in the community.\n\nImpacts of Teen Dating Violence\n\nUnhealthy, abusive, or violent relationships can have severe consequences and short-and long-term adverse effects on a developing teen. For example, youth who are victims of teen dating violence are more likely to experience symptoms of depression and anxiety, engage in unhealthy behaviors, like using tobacco, drugs, and alcohol, exhibit antisocial behaviors, like lying, theft, bullying, or hitting, and think about suicide.\n\nViolence in an adolescent relationship sets the stage for problems in future relationships, including intimate partner violence and sexual violence perpetration and/or victimization throughout life. For example, youth who are victims of dating violence in high school are at higher risk for victimization during college.\n\nIn the case of sexual teen dating violence, it can negatively influence the development of healthy sexuality, intimacy, and identity as youth grow into adulthood. These experiences can increase the risk of physical injury, poor academic performance, binge drinking, suicide attempts, unhealthy sexual behaviors, substance abuse, negative body image and self-esteem, and violence in future relationships.\n\nTeen dating violence can be prevented. Prevention is most successful when there is a focus on reducing risk factors as well as fostering protective factors. Teens should also be empowered through family, friends, and others (including role models such as teachers, coaches, mentors, and youth group leaders) to lead healthy lives and establish healthy relationships. It is crucial to create spaces, such as school communities, where the behavioral norms are not tolerant of abuse in dating relationships. The message must be clear that treating people in abusive ways will not be accepted, and policies must enforce this message to keep students safe.\n\nPrevention Programs\n\nThe ultimate goal of education about youth violence is to stop teen dating violence before it begins. During the preteen and teen years, young people are learning the skills they need to form positive, healthy relationships with others. Therefore, it is an ideal time to promote healthy relationships and prevent patterns of teen dating violence that can last into adulthood.\n\nIn addition to teaching relationship skills, prevention programs can focus on promoting protective factors\u2014that is, characteristics of a teen\u2019s environment that can support healthy development\u2014and positive youth development. These can also be fostered by a teen\u2019s home and community. For example, higher levels of bonding to parents and enhanced social skills can protect girls against victimization. Similarly, for boys, high levels of parental bonding are associated with less externalizing behavior, which in turn is associated with less teen dating violence victimization.\n\nMost of the handful of programs that have been empirically investigated are school-based and use a group format. Program length varies from less than a day to more than 20 sessions. A few programs frame the issue using a feminist perspective, while others use a more skills-based and gender-neutral approach. Teen dating violence prevention programs tend to focus on attitudes about violence, gender stereotyping, conflict management, and problem-solving skills.

The track, a collaboration with Jason Derulo, was a viral hit on TikTok before getting an official single release.\n\nBefore that, Canadian singer-songwriter Shawn Mendes was just 17 and 5 months when his track Stitches hit the top spot. He achieved the feat by knocking Justin Bieber off the summit - an artist who made his UK chart debut aged 15, when One Time peaked at 11 in 2010.

The song came about after Ian, whose Dad was BBC Radio 1 newsreader Pat Doody often brought Ian into the studio. The toddler appeared on-air from time to time, resulting in how Groovy Baby came about.\n\nWould you believe that there has in fact been uncredited vocals on a Number 1 hit from someone less than a year old? Jessica Smith, believed to be around seven months old at the time, holds the record for the youngest person to appear on a UK hit single.\n\nJessica was the baby who played The Sun in the Teletubbies.

For others, instead, it is the result of an ended marriage. In the European Union, divorce rates are rather high in general, but no country gets close to Luxembourg\u2019s odd record. In this small state, in fact, almost nine out of 10 marriages end up in a divorce. An increasing number of divorces often translates into a rising number of children who grow up mainly with one parent . In terms of religious affiliation , Christians worldwide recorded the highest share of people living in single-parent households. Data suggest that single moms were much more numerous than single dads, and that the U.S. had the highest share of single parenting. Moreover, raising children while relying on just one income might prove to be a challenge: in Ireland, for instance, childcare takes up one third of net household income for single parents.As social distancing measures were being taken to contain the spread of COVID-19 all over the world, meeting new people became much more difficult for singles. This resulted in a boom of online dating services , an industry whose revenue were already on the rise. Tinder, the most popular dating app in the world, was downloaded more than six million times in January 2021 alone.

To paraphrase his statements (as I read them in The Washington Post), Obama was making the point that while home runs (scoring a run by hitting the ball) are exciting, singles and doubles (getting on first and second base respectively) can be critical to winning the game even if they don't excite the crowd in the same way.\n\nWhat he means in a broader sense is that his foreign policy isn't flashy and thrilling, but his efforts are intended to make slow, steady forward progress. He is more interested in playing it safe and avoiding errors than he is in impressing people with a show that might not pay off.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention that I think he is implying that displaying aggression and threatening military action is a \"home run\": it is seems strong, virile, and sexy, so there is pressure to behave that way so that our country continues to seem like a superpower. On the other hand, negotiating peaceful relations is our \"singles and doubles\": it is boring and makes us look like a bunch of sissies who can't get things done.\n\nThis is more expressive if you know baseball, because getting players on base makes it more likely that you will score more runs than a team that only hits homers. Having home run hitters is fine, if they can hit them and if they are in the right place in your lineup, but home run attempts are more likely to become outs. It's better strategically to have players who can get base hits (singles, doubles, triples) most of the time than to have players who can hit home runs some of the time."}, {"url": "https://www.funtrivia.com/trivia-quiz/Celebrities/My-Sibling-Had-a-Hit-Single-Too-348571.html", "page_content": "Quiz Answer Key and Fun Facts\n\n1.

But despite the lesser sales, Bad did achieve a feat that not only did Thriller not accomplish, but that no album in history ever had before: It spawned five No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nEach of the set\u2019s first five singles \u2014 Siedah Garrett ballad duet \u201cI Just Can\u2019t Stop Loving You,\u201d storming title track \u201cBad,\u201d strutting love song \u201cThe Way You Make Me Feel,\u201d anthemic power ballad \u201cMan in the Mirror\u201d and rock-infused backstage drama \u201cDirty Diana\u201d \u2014 made it all the way to the Hot 100\u2019s apex, breaking the previous record of four No. 1 hits off the same album, initially set in 1978 by the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. For more than two decades, Bad reigned as the lone album to notch five Hot 100-toppers, until Katy Perry finally tied the achievement in 2011 with her fifth No. 1 off sophomore album Teenage Dream.\n\nSo how did an album that largely failed to live up to commercial expectation manage to do something no blockbuster album had managed before? A lot of the answer can be found through the album\u2019s surrounding context \u2014 in terms of Michael Jackson\u2019s career, in terms of the pop landscape in the late \u201980s and in terms of the Billboard charts of the time.\n\nThough Thriller managed \u201conly\u201d two Hot 100 No. 1s of its own \u2014 \u201cBillie Jean\u201d and \u201cBeat It\u201d \u2014 it raised the bar for how long an album\u2019s shelf life could last. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those few records I can think of with three meaningful Christmas seasons,\u201d says Mayfield. \u201cWhen I was at Billboard [in 1984] it was the third Christmas season for Thriller, and it was still one of the records that retailers cited as a traffic builder for them, and that\u2019s unusual.\u201d\n\nThe album also set new standards for the number of hit singles that could be pulled from the same record, with seven of its nine tracks becoming top 10 hits on the Hot 100 \u2014 a then-record. \u201cHaving seven top 10 hits [on Thriller] was important,\u201d says Larry Stessel, senior VP/marketing for Jackson\u2019s Sony-owned label Epic in the \u201980s. \u201cBecause you had all of those songs that were being played on 98 percent of the radio stations in the country, whether it was some lesser singles\u2026 as long as they\u2019re in the top 10 or top five, they\u2019re going to have a tremendous impact.\u201d\n\nAfter Thriller, albums that previously would\u2019ve only spun off three or four singles were now increasingly likely to have five, six, even seven songs pulled as A-sides before the artist would move on to a next album. Tellingly, Def Leppard\u2019s Diamond-selling Pyromania set, released just a couple months after Thriller in 1983, saw only four songs released as singles, but by the time of 1987 follow-up Hysteria, that LP spawned seven singles \u2014 with the fourth and fifth single in the U.S. (\u201cPour Some Sugar on Me\u201d and \u201cLove Bites\u201d) becoming the set\u2019s biggest Hot 100 hits, reaching Nos. 2 and 1, respectively. \u201c\u2018We should do a rock version of Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller,'\u201d Def Leppard guitarist Phil Collen recalled to Billboard of producer Mutt Lange\u2019s goals for Hysteria.\n\nAlso contributing to these albums\u2019 extended lifespans was the rise of MTV. Albums like Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Born in the U.S.A. (1984) and Janet Jackson\u2019s Control (1986) were able to generate at least five top 10 hits each (seven for Born) in large part because many of their singles were accompanied by captivating music videos that were endlessly promoted on what had become the world\u2019s most influential musical outlet. And Michael Jackson, who had helped the channel go truly global with videos for Thriller\u2018s \u201cBeat It,\u201d \u201cBillie Jean\u201d and the title track, was the station\u2019s unquestioned male lead. \u201cThey were so hungry for Michael Jackson videos that we could\u2019ve put out Michael singing \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 and they would\u2019ve played it,\u201d Stessel recalls.\n\nAnd when Bad was finally ready for release in 1987, a half-decade after Thriller had permanently changed the parameters for pop album scaling, it was given one of the great promotional pushes in record industry history. Walter Yetnikoff, then-CEO of CBS and Sony Music, was behind Jackson fully. At the time, Columbia Records (a CBS division) had mega-selling acts Springsteen, Pink Floyd and Billy Joel on its roster, but it was clear which artist was Yetnikoff\u2019s top priority. \u201cAs much as Walter loved those [other] acts, Michael was the king at the company,\u201d says one former Sony executive. \u201cThe push behind Jackson kept Columbia from getting to No. 1 with their records. They over-aggressively promoted Michael Jackson, because that was what Walter wanted.\u201d (Journey\u2019s Frontiers album on Columbia stalled at No. 2 for nine weeks in 1983, stuck behind Thriller.)\n\nThe Bad album \u2014 whose progress was kept as a secret even to Jackson\u2019s label, Epic Records, until shortly before it was delivered \u2014 was first introduced to a who\u2019s who of radio and retail bigwigs at a private dinner at the pop star\u2019s house in Encino, California. \u201cThe first thing I thought was\u2026 we have to make Michael real to the industry again,\u201d says Jim Caparro, then-head of sales at Epic. \u201cTo make him real again I came up with this wild notion that we should bring all the accounts and big radio people to Michael\u2019s house and have him debut the album to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSony brought in Wolfgang Puck, he was the chef at the house,\u201d recalls Bruce Ogilvie, now the CEO of Alliance Entertainment and the then-owner of the Abbey Road One-Stop distributor, about the summit. \u201cThey had all the Sony senior people there and [manager] Frank DiLeo was there, and so was Janet Jackson. They didn\u2019t spare any expense. They picked everyone up in limousines to bring us there. It floated around the party that Michael Jackson was sleeping upstairs in the oxygen chamber but would come down later.\u201d\n\nBad was brought to the general public via a half-hour special, Michael Jackson: The Magic Returns, which debuted on CBS primetime the night before the album was released. The centerpiece of the special was the \u201cBad\u201d music video, an 18-minute short film helmed by legendary director Martin Scorsese and co-starring a pre-fame Wesley Snipes. \u201cIt was on from 8-8:30 [on CBS] and it was the No. 5 show of the week,\u201d says Stessel, who wrote, produced and directed the program (along with Don Wilson), which also featured a short catch-up film summarizing Michael\u2019s career to that point. \u201cIt was a tremendous coup\u2026 we shipped 4.2 million copies [of the album], and we sold half of it the first week.\u201d\n\nAll of this set the scene for a singles rollout that built on the momentum of Thriller and attempted to take it to new heights. \u201cThe album of your career is always going to put you on a higher plateau than you were before,\u201d Mayfield says. \u201cAnd I would say that Thriller did some of the heavy lifting for Bad just by making his tent larger than it ever could have been prior to that album.\u201d\n\nNot wanting to mess with the successful formula of the latter, the release strategy for Bad closely mirrored that of its predecessor. \u201cI Just Can\u2019t Stop Loving You,\u201d with Siedah Garrett \u2014 the more traditional pop duet without a music video \u2014 was pulled as a single first (as the Paul McCartney collab \u201cThe Girl Is Mine\u201d was from Thriller), followed by two more obvious modern pop knockouts with elaborate visuals to match in \u201cBad\u201d and \u201cThe Way You Make Me Feel\u201d (just like \u201cBillie Jean\u201d and \u201cBeat It\u201d an album earlier). \u201cEverything was about, \u2018Let\u2019s just do everything the Thriller way,'\u201d Stessel recalls.\n\nBut when it came to scoring Hot 100-toppers, Bad had era advantages that Thriller didn\u2019t. The late \u201980s saw a particularly high concentration of singles hitting the top of the Hot 100, with 33 separate singles spending time at No. 1 in 1988 (including three of the five Bad No. 1s), and only one single (Steve Winwood\u2019s \u201cRoll With It\u201d) reigning at the chart\u2019s apex for as many as four weeks. By contrast, only 17 singles reached pole position on the Hot 100 in 1983 \u2014 including both of Thriller\u2018s No. 1s \u2014 and seven separate songs reigned for at least four weeks. It was easier for Jackson to score more No. 1s off Bad, because there were simply more No. 1s to go around in the late \u201980s.\n\nWhy was this? Well, by the late \u201980s, the big labels had largely decided that the duration of their artists\u2019 No. 1 hits was not nearly as important as the volume. \u201cNobody would care if you had a No. 1 for one week or 10 weeks,\u201d explains Michael Ellis, Billboard\u2018s assistant director of charts and author of the weekly \u201cHot 100 Singles Spotlight\u201d column in 1987. \u201cYou just would go down in history that you had a No. 1. So the minute you had your peak position, the labels wanted it out of the way.\u201d Consequently, Ellis says, labels would intentionally cut back on promoting their records shortly after they\u2019d hit their chart peaks: \u201cThey\u2019d work it down to get rid of it, so the next single could come up, whether it was by that artist or another artist that they were trying to get [a hit].\u201d\n\nWhen it came to Bad, CBS execs definitely felt the stress of getting Jackson\u2019s singles to the top spot. \u201cI remember we would sit in sales meetings, and there was a lot of conversation and pressure to get No. 1 store [sales] reports, because Michael was the most important artist on the label,\u201d says Harvey Leeds, CBS\u2019 then-VP promotion and video. \u201cParticularly after a successful monster like Thriller\u2026 Michael got what Michael wanted.\u201d\n\nAnd what Michael wanted was history. \u201cHe always wanted to break the next record,\u201d Leeds recalls. \u201cThat was Michael\u2019s whole thing, to break new ground and to be the first person to do something that no other recording artist had ever done.\u201d\n\nAll of the Bad No. 1s enjoyed these abbreviated chart peaks, with \u201cBad\u201d and \u201cMan in the Mirror\u201d each holding on at No. 1 for two weeks, and the set\u2019s other three chart-toppers spending just a single week on top. But Bad wasn\u2019t alone in this phenomenon: While it was the only album of its era to spawn five No. 1 singles, four other late \u201980s albums \u2014 Whitney Houston\u2019s Whitney (1987), George Michael\u2019s Faith (1987), Paula Abdul\u2019s Forever Your Girl (1988) and Janet Jackson\u2019s Rhythm Nation 1814 (1989) \u2014 spun off four each, a feat matched by only three other albums in the decades since. And for each of these albums, the singles\u2019 reigns at No. 1 were relatively short lived; none spent more than four weeks on top, and many were one- or two-week triumphs.\n\nThe end of this era on the charts came with the introduction of Nielsen SoundScan and BDSRadio technology to Billboard\u2018s chart methodology, which allowed for more accurate tracking of album sales and radio airplay (respectively), and for less label influence in the reporting of those numbers. In 1992, the first full year of Billboard\u2018s Nielsen integration, the number of total No. 1s on the Hot 100 dropped from 27 the year before to just 13.\n\nTellingly, Michael Jackson\u2019s Dangerous album, released in late \u201991 as his Bad follow-up, notched just a single No. 1 on the chart \u2014 though it lasted for seven weeks, far longer than any of his Bad Hot 100 champions. \u201cThey were so nervous \u2014 Sony \u2014 about how this would affect their relationship with Michael Jackson\u2026 They actually flew me from New York to L.A. to meet with him,\u201d Ellis recalls, \u201cand explain the new chart system. So when Sony told him what was going on, he would see that they were not lying to him. That it wasn\u2019t just a weakness in their promotional efforts \u2014 that there really was a new system in place.\u201d\n\nJackson never again threatened Bad\u2018s record for No. 1 singles, but for a long time, neither did anyone else. After the Nielsen data was introduced to Billboard calculations in 1991, it wasn\u2019t until Usher\u2019s Confessions album in 2004 that another album would notch as many as four Hot 100 No. 1s.\n\nAnd then it wasn\u2019t until 2011 \u2014 nearly a quarter-century after Bad first set the chart milestone \u2014 that it would be matched, as Perry\u2019s Teenage Dream album also spawned No. 1s with its first five singles: the Snoop Dogg-assisted \u201cCalifornia Gurls,\u201d \u201cTeenage Dream,\u201d \u201cFirework,\u201d \u201cE.T.\u201d (featuring Kanye West on the single release) and \u201cLast Friday Night (T.G.I.F.).\u201d \u201cWe made an event of every single we rolled out from that album,\u201d says Greg Thompson \u2014 then-executive VP of marketing and promotion at Perry\u2019s label Capitol Records \u2014 of what it took to match Bad\u2018s five No. 1s. \u201cOur job was doing the best possible job on each single and maximizing every opportunity.\u201d\n\nOf course, as many external explanations as there were for Michael Jackson\u2019s unprecedented chart achievement, the biggest might still be the simplest: They were five really good pop songs. \u201cIt was a brilliant record,\u201d Caparro says of Bad. \u201cWhen all is said and done, the only way you get five No. 1 singles from an album is awesome talent \u2014 forget the set-up and the craftmanship to the marketing. We were all holding onto his talent, his awesomeness and his momentum.\u201d\n\nAnd Michael\u2019s shining example made it an honor for Perry to share his historic company. \u201cWhen it was pointed out to me that we were starting to infringe on Michael Jackson territory and it suddenly dawned on us that we could make some history here, we talked to Katy,\u201d Thompson recalls. \u201cTogether we realized it was rarified air to be in the same place as Michael Jackson.\u201d"}], "'Why Do Fools Fall in Love' was Lymon's biggest hit.": [{"url": "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/teen-idol-frankie-lymon-tragic-rise-fall-tells-truth-1950s-america-180967506/", "page_content": "That voice! Those apple cheeks! Arms wide, head back, he radiates joy, even in antique black and white. That beautiful soprano flying high, talent and presence and just enough ham to sell it all. And it was a great story, too: Up from nothing! A shooting star! So when they found Frankie Lymon dead at the age of 25 one February morning in 1968, in the same apartment building where he\u2019d grown up, it was the end of something and the beginning of something, but no one was quite sure what.\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers were five kids from Washington Heights, just north of Harlem. They sang doo-wop under the streetlight on the corner of 165th and Amsterdam. They were discovered by the Valentines\u2019 lead singer Richie Barrett while the kids were rehearsing in an apartment house. A few months later their first record, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d made it to the top of the national charts. It was 1956. Overnight, Frankie Lymon was the hottest singer in America, off on a world tour. He was 13 years old.\n\nThat made him the first black teenage pop star, a gap-toothed, baby-faced, angel-voiced paragon of show business ambition, and a camera-ready avatar of America\u2019s new postwar youth movement. He was a founding father of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll even before his voice had changed. That voice and that style influenced two generations of rock, soul and R&B giants. You heard his echoes everywhere. The high, clear countertenor, like something out of Renaissance church music, found its way from the Temptations to the Beach Boys to Earth, Wind & Fire. Even Diana Ross charted a cover of \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d 25 years after its release. Berry Gordy may not have modeled the Jackson 5 on Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, as is often said, but it sure sounded as if he had.\n\nThat\u2019s the legend, anyway. Truth is, Frankie Lymon grew up too fast in every way imaginable. \u201cI never was a child, although I was billed in every theater and auditorium where I appeared as a child star,\u201d Lymon told Art Peters, a reporter for Ebony magazine, in 1967. \u201cI was a man when I was 11 years old, doing everything that most men do. In the neighborhood where I lived, there was no time to be a child. There were five children in my family and my folks had to scuffle to make ends meet. My father was a truck driver and my mother worked as a domestic in white folks\u2019 homes. While kids my age were playing stickball and marbles, I was working in the corner grocery store carrying orders to help pay the rent.\u201d\n\nA few days before Frankie and his friends from the corner recorded the song that made them famous, Rosa Parks was pulled off a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Less than two years later, Frankie danced with a white girl on a national television show, and the show was swiftly canceled. Another part of the legend.\n\nRace integration in pop music was never going to be simple.\n\n**********\n\nAmerica in the 1950s: postwar economy roaring, a chicken in every pot and two cars in every garage of the split-level house in Levittown, every clich\u00e9 of union-made American middle-class prosperity held to be self-evident.\n\nAnd music was a big part of that. Raucous and brawny, electrified, it felt like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis all fell from the sky at once. Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, with their tight, upbeat harmony, were an important part of it, too. You can trace doo-wop back to the Psalms, hear it bubble up in the a cappella harmonies of Gregorian chant, or, by way of Africa and the Caribbean, from gospel quartets.\n\nIn America, beginning in the 1930s, the Mills Brothers and the Ink Spots were the popularizers of those intricate harmonies we recognize today as proto-rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. Doo-wop was among the inheritors, a thousand street-corner groups and a thousand one-hit wonders. The Spaniels and the Five Satins and the Vocaleers, the Drifters and the Fleetwoods and the Moonglows, the Coasters and the Platters and on to Frankie Valli and modernity. In the 1950s, every high school stairwell in this country was loud with four-part singing. Even today the \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d movie franchise owes its popularity to an a cappella tradition stretching back into pre-electric history.\n\n\u201cWe harmonized every night on the street corner until the neighbors would call the cops to run us away,\u201d Lymon told Ebony. But Frankie wasn\u2019t doo-wop, not really. Doo-wop was group music. \u201cFrankie Lymon was always different than that,\u201d Robert Christgau, great-granddaddy of American rock critics and historians, will tell you. \u201cHe was the star.\u201d\n\nFrankie and his record producers and managers soon agreed he\u2019d be a more profitable solo act, so off he went, leaving behind the Teenagers, and with them friendship and loyalty. He had another, lesser, hit\u2014a recording of \u201cGoody Goody,\u201d sung by Bob Crosby and Ella Fitzgerald before him\u2014before things cooled.\n\nThen came the long, slow slide.\n\nAsk any junkie and they\u2019ll tell what they\u2019re chasing is the feeling they got the first time they got high. But that first-time rush can never be recaptured, whether you\u2019re talking about heroin or cigarettes or hit records.\n\nFrankie was a heroin addict at 15 years old. He tried to kick, tried again and again and got straight for a while. Then his mother died, and he fell hard.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t alone. Heroin was everywhere in New York by then, and methadone clinics run by the city were springing up in neighborhoods all over town. The failure rate was heartbreaking.\n\n\u201cI looked twice my age,\u201d Lymon told Ebony. \u201cI was thin as a shadow and I didn\u2019t give a damn. My only concern was in getting relief. You know, an addict is the most pathetic creature on earth. He knows that every time he sticks a needle in his arm, he\u2019s gambling with death and, yet, he\u2019s got to have it. It\u2019s like playing Russian Roulette with a spike. There\u2019s always the danger that some peddler will sell him a poisoned batch\u2014some garbage.\u201d Here young Frankie knocks on wood. \u201cI was lucky. God must have been watching over me.\u201d\n\nEven now you want to believe him.\n\n**********\n\nFrankie\u2019s neighborhood, just up the bluffs from the long-gone Polo Grounds, feels mostly unchanged even 50 years later. It was poorer then, sure, like the rest of New York City, and in the age before earbuds and headphones it was surely louder. You heard music in the streets.\n\nOutside Frankie\u2019s old address, on West 165th, there\u2019s a \u201cWet Paint\u201d sign on the door this bright autumn morning, and one building over a crew is painting the ancient fire escapes. The whole block smells of solvent, sharp and clean. It\u2019s a well-kept street of five- and six-story apartment houses in a tidy neighborhood of working-class folks who greet each other on the sidewalk, black and white and brown, Latin American and Caribbean immigrants and Great Migration African-Americans and, like the rest of New York, folks from all over.\n\nYoung as he was, Lymon had three wives. He married them in quick succession, and there was plenty of confusion about the paperwork. He may have been married to more than one at a time, or not entirely married to one of the three at all. One of them may have still been married to someone else. Depends whom you ask. (In the 1980s, they all met in court, to settle Lymon\u2019s estate, such as it was, to find out who was entitled to songwriting royalties from best sellers like \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d None got much, but the third wife, Emira Eagle, received an undisclosed settlement from record producers.)\n\nIn 1966, there was a brief glimmer of hope. Fresh out of rehab at Manhattan General Hospital, Lymon appeared at a block party organized by a group of nuns at a Catholic settlement house in the Bronx. He told an audience of 2,000 teenagers, \u201cI have been born again. I\u2019m not ashamed to let the public know I took the cure. Maybe my story will keep some other kid from going wrong.\u201d\n\nOn February 27, 1968, he was booked for a recording session to mark the start of a comeback. Instead, he was found dead that morning on his grandmother\u2019s bathroom floor.\n\n**********\n\nFrankie Lymon was buried in the Bronx, at St. Raymond\u2019s Cemetery: Row 13, Grave 70. It\u2019s 15 minutes by car from the old neighborhood. His headstone is over by the highway. The grass is green and the ground is hard and uneven and on the left his stone is packed tight with the others. On the right there\u2019s a gap like a missing tooth. You can see the towers of two bridges from here, the Bronx-Whitestone and Throgs Neck, and hear the traffic rush past on the Cross Bronx Expressway. Billie Holiday is buried here, and Typhoid Mary. This is where the Lindbergh ransom exchange happened. The wind comes hard off Eastchester Bay and shakes the pagoda trees.\n\nFor years Frankie\u2019s grave was unmarked. In the mid-1980s, a New Jersey music store held a benefit to raise money for a memorial, but it never made it to the cemetery. The headstone gathered dust in the record shop, then moved at last to the backyard of a friend of the owner.\n\nEmira Eagle had the current headstone installed sometime in the late 1990s.In Loving Memory\n\nOf My Husband Frank J. Lymon Sept. 30, 1942 \u2013 Feb. 27, 1968\n\nNot much room to tell his story. And what could anyone say? That the 1950s were long over? That innocence was dead? That by 1968 one America had vanished entirely, and another had taken its place?\n\nOr maybe that Frankie Lymon\u2019s America, doo-wop America, was never simple, never sweet, but was rather an America as complex and wracked by animus and desire as any in history. It was the same America that killed Emmett Till, after all, another angel-faced kid with apple cheeks and a wide, bright smile.\n\nSeen across the gulf of years, what we now think of as the anodyne, antiseptic 1950s America is revealed as an illusion. June Cleaver vacuuming in an organdy cocktail dress and pearls is a television mirage, a national hallucination. We had the postwar world economy to ourselves because so many other industrial nations had been bombed flat. And for every Pat Boone there was a \u201cHowl,\u201d an Allen Ginsberg, a Kerouac, a Coltrane, a Krassner, a Ferlinghetti. There were underground explosions in painting and poetry and music and prose. It was a kind of invisible revolution.\n\nA telling detail of that chaste 1950s mythology: to preserve his image as a clean-cut teenager, Frankie Lymon would pass off the women he dated in different cities as his mother. It gets told and told and told\u2014in fact, he told it himself\u2014that he once got caught by a reporter who went to shows in New York and Chicago and saw that his \u201cmom\u201d was two different women, each twice Frankie\u2019s age. A story too good to fact-check.\n\nIt was in these 1950s that Ralph Ellison wrote Invisible Man, and James Baldwin published Notes of a Native Son. After Rosa Parks was pulled off that bus, Dr. King led the Montgomery bus boycott and changed the trajectory of civil rights in America. The Supreme Court decided Brown v. Board of Education, and then came Little Rock and the lunch counter sit-ins at Wichita and Oklahoma City. What you saw of the \u201950s in America was all about where you stood. And with whom.\n\nWas the short, blinding arc of Frankie Lymon\u2019s career a morality play? A rock \u2019n\u2019 roll cautionary tale? Or just another story of a young man gone too soon?\n\nMaybe it was a reminder that America changes in every instant and never changes at all. Our streets have always been filled with music and temptation; addiction has always been with us, long before \u201cus\u201d was even America, from the Lotus Eaters of The Odyssey to the opium dens of the Wild West to the crack epidemic and on to our own new opioid crisis.\n\nLooking at that headstone, you get to thinking maybe Frankie Lymon was the 1950s, man and myth, the junkie with an angel\u2019s voice, and that the stone stands as a monument to the lies we tell ourselves about America in the time before Frankie flew away.\n\nThe very night Lymon died Walter Cronkite went on the air and said of Vietnam, \u201cWe are mired in a stalemate.\u201d It was clear the center couldn\u2019t hold, and if you felt like the 1950s were five polite young men in matching letter sweaters, the rest of 1968 came at you like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The world lurched and suddenly spun too fast. Tet. My Lai. Chicago. Washington. Baltimore. Riots everywhere. Vietnam the pulse and drumbeat behind and beneath everything.\n\nSo when Frankie Lymon died that February morning you\u2019d have been forgiven for missing it. He was nearly forgotten by then, a five-paragraph item on page 50 of the New York Times, a casualty of the moment the future and the past came apart.\n\nIt was sad, but for a while, arms wide and head back, Frankie Lymon had bridged and bound all those opposing energies. That face! That voice!\n\nMan, he could sing like an angel.\n\nGet the latest History stories in your inbox?

Written by Tina Andrews Produced by Paul Hall and Stephen Nemeth Cast: Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox, Lela Rochon, and Lorenz Tate\n\nAt the tender age of twenty-six, Sixties soul music sensation Frankie Lymon overdosed on heroin. He left the world to its imagination about what could have become of the boy wonder had he lived. The Warner Brothers film Why Do Fools Fall in Love, named after Lymon's biggest hit song, tells his story from the perspective of three people who knew him best-his wives. You see, Frankie Lymon was many things to many people and it was revealed posthumously that he was a husband to three women. Legally speaking, Frankie Lymon had been simultaneously married to Zola Taylor, a glamorous singer in her own right, Elizabeth Waters, a petty thief with a big heart, and Emira Eagle, a southern school teacher with high principles. Four stellar African American actors came together to bring this historic story to film. It is an incredible assemblage of some of Hollywood's brightest stars. The sexy and superbly talented Halle Berry portrays Zola Taylor, the alluring lead singer of the legendary \"Platters.\" Vivica A. Fox brilliantly combines humor with around-the-way edginess to effectively portray Elizabeth Waters, the street-smart woman who stood by Lymon when times were the worst. Lela Rochon adopts Emira Eagle's southern belle persona so fully that it's hard to believe this is the same woman who tantalized us as the Harlem sex goddess, Sunshine, in Harlem Nights. And, finally, as the talented man whose depth and complexity couldn't be reflected by just one woman, the multi-talented Larenz Tate stars as Frankie Lymon.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot:\n\nFall in Love opens in the early eighties when Diana Ross's remake of the title song ruled the airwaves and generated considerable royalties for the Frankie Lymon estate. When it's discovered that Lymon was married to three women, it falls upon the courts to determine which ex-wife is the heir and therefore entitled to the wealth of the estate. During the trial, Frankie Lymon's life story is told through the court testimony of his wives and a corresponding series of flashbacks. We see him as a young adult struggling to get his group, \"The Teenagers,\" a big break. We see his star rise and fall as he succumbs to the pitfalls of drug addiction. We also get an intimate look at the redemption he found in the love of three different women."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1992/11/27/the-long-wait-for-a-hit-to-turn-gold/53c0d6b6-dbda-42ca-b40e-61c06dc307df/", "page_content": "NEW YORK -- The song lasts just a little more than two minutes. The bass comes on like a calliope, followed by a wash of shimmering ooh-wahs. Then the soaring soprano of 13-year-old Frankie Lymon swoops in with lyrics that ask several enduring musical questions: Why do birds sing so gay? Why does rain fall from up above? And, in particular, \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love?\" There's a manic saxophone solo, a lush final chorus, and that's it, over and out.\n\nPeople have been fighting over it in one courtroom or another for more than eight years.\n\nLast week, it looked as if a milestone had been reached in the tangled history of an early rock-and-roll classic. A jury in U.S. District Court found that Jimmy Merchant and Herman Santiago were co-authors of \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love?,\" the Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers hit that rode the charts for 16 weeks in 1956. For Merchant and Santiago, the only surviving Teenagers of the original five, the verdict was sweet vindication.\n\n\"Every time I heard the music on the radio, I used to feel sick,\" Santiago says. He is 51 now, a stagehand when he can find work; he still lives in Washington Heights, where the Teenagers perfected their harmonizing in echoey apartment building hallways. \"We felt we had put that music together and someone else was getting all the money. ... I was always angry.\"\n\nNow, the way looks clear for the two buddies to begin collecting their share of decades of earnings. Their lawyers were mentioning astonishing sums, $2 million, maybe $4 million.\n\n\"I was grateful, and I used my manners,\" recounts Merchant, who's 52, lives in two modest rooms in Queens and drives a cab. \"I got the eye of the jurors as they walked past and had a personal word with each of them. 'God bless you' or 'God thank you.' \"\n\nStories of young recording artists of the '50s and '60s, many of them black and Hispanic, being systematically swindled and flimflammed by the industry that made them idols have become staples of American cultural lore. And the Teenagers (who still perform, mostly at weekend oldies gigs) \"were the youngest kids out there and the most talented and the most popular, and we made more money than anyone,\" says Santiago -- not that they saw much of it. \"So we got beat royally.\"\n\nNaturally, they are celebrating this rags-to-riches-to-rags-to-riches saga. Yet even as Merchant happily decides that he can finally trade in his 1977 Datsun for a 1982 Pontiac (pricier wheels will have to wait until the judge rules on damages), anyone who has followed the litigation that commenced in 1984 has to shudder a bit. When it comes to this song, victories often have proved illusory.\n\n\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love?\" has spawned not only a vast tide of memorandums and depositions, but years of chicanery, feuds, betrayals real or imagined, extremely strange bedfellows, reversals and heartache. A jubilant bit of doo-wop that refuses to die, the song and questions about its authorship and earnings will be the subject of legal wrangles continuing well into next year at the least.\n\nOther old pop and rock hits, more valuable with each recycling into TV commercials and nostalgic boxed CDs, have had their days in court too. \"But none that never seemed to end -- like this,\" says Chuck Rubin, a rock-and-roll bounty hunter who figures prominently in this story. \"And who knows what the future will bring? This thing may go on for 80 years.\"\n\n'I'm Not a Juvenile Delinquent'\n\nThey were all junior high school students when Santiago and Merchant and Sherman Garnes and Joe Negroni -- like half of the kids on 165th Street, it seemed -- formed a vocal group. Santiago and Merchant had come up with several original compositions, they have always maintained, before their knee-high neighbor Frankie Lymon (who was only 12) joined up. One of them was \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love?\"\n\nAt the four-day trial this month, three people testified that they had heard the quartet practicing that number, with Santiago on lead tenor, before Lymon entered the picture. Yet when the Teenagers found their way downtown, to the offices of doo-wop impresario George Goldner, the balance of power shifted for good.\n\nGoldner wanted the charismatic little boy with the adorable grin up front singing the lead. And when Goldner registered the copyright, assuring the kids that he'd handle everything, he listed the song's authors as George Goldner and Frankie Lymon.\n\nStill later, when Goldner sold his interests to one Morris Levy -- also legendary, and even more of a crook -- the copyright was changed again. It read Lymon and Levy, a man none of the Teenagers had even met, Santiago points out, until the year after \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love?\" was released.\n\nPerhaps the long-term issue of authors' royalties would have mattered less if the Teenagers had profited as much as they'd expected to during their brief, incandescent careers as performers. They were phenoms in 1956 and '57, criss-crossing the country on bus tours (along with the Coasters, the Platters, Chuck Berry and other icons), playing 90 one-nighters in a row, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show,\" touring England. Their earnings, they were told, were being held in trust.\n\nBut when they turned 21 and tried to collect, \"there was only a thousand dollars for each of us,\" Santiago says. \"I'd figured it would be $100,000 at least, apiece.\" And by that time the group was kaput. Frankie Lymon had been repackaged as a solo crooner, the Teenagers were recording on their own, and neither ever duplicated the group's early triumphs.\n\nLymon, a charmer and a hustler, a thief and a junkie (despite the fact that one of his hits was titled \"I'm Not a Juvenile Delinquent\"), was dead by 1968 from a heroin overdose. George Goldner and Teenagers Garnes and Negroni have died as well. Levy died in 1990, cheating the FBI of a long-sought victory by succumbing to cancer before he could serve a day of his 10-year federal sentence for extortion. The legal and financial mess involving \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love?\" has outlived them all.\n\n'What Are You, a Moron?'\n\nThe legal battle began in 1984, shortly after Chuck Rubin discovered the existence of one Emira Eagle Lymon, a Georgia schoolteacher. Rubin's company, Artists Rights Enforcements, specializes in shaming, bullying and suing recalcitrant record companies into paying musicians just compensation. Rubin typically takes half the proceeds, which causes suspicious muttering in some quarters, but his client roster remains an honor roll of early rock.\n\nEmira Lymon, it turned out, married Frankie in 1967. As his heir, she (and Rubin) could go after the half of the copyright that the record executives had appropriated. Richard Bennett, the lawyer Rubin had brought into the case, filed suit on Emira's behalf in federal court, charging Morris Levy with fraud and copyright infringement and seeking to establish Frankie Lymon as the author of \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love?\"\n\nMerchant and Santiago, who'd met with Emira Lymon and Bennett in Rubin's office, say they had an unwritten understanding: Emira would be the plaintiff, but she would share any proceeds equally with them. They were, they insisted, the true writers; Frankie \"made a few changes, but his contributions were limited,\" says Santiago. Bennett concurs: \"To this day I am stunned -- stunned -- that she double-crossed these guys.\"\n\nBut Rubin insists that while the Teenagers proposed such an arrangement, Emira Lymon never agreed. Why would she accept a third of the song's value (at the time, Rubin estimated that value at $750,000) and give them a third each, when as the widow she was entitled to half or maybe (if her suit succeeded in gaining Levy's half of the copyright) all of it? \"She's a polite lady, Southern-bred, she's not going to say, 'What are you, a moron?' \" Rubin says. \"She said, 'Let me talk to my lawyer and get back with you.' It was her polite way of saying, 'Get lost.' \"\n\nRubin and Bennett, the lawyer, became bitter enemies over this issue. \"Rubin decided that he could have 50 percent {his typical cut} of the whole song if he played his cards right,\" Bennett says. \"That meant getting rid of these guys and getting rid of me, because I would not go along with cutting out the people who wrote the damn song -- how immoral can you get?\"\n\nBennett was dismissed, replaced by attorney Ira Greenberg. Bennett then filed a second suit in the same federal court, this one claiming that Merchant and Santiago, with Lymon, wrote \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love?\"\n\nBefore either suit could be heard -- hold on, this gets complicated -- the issue of who wrote the song was set aside in favor of a more pressing question: Who was Frankie Lymon's real widow? For two other women had conveniently shown up claiming to have married the charming but unreliable Frankie. Both had been located and had been paid \"advances\" by Morris Levy, who could sit back and watch the assault on his copyright get derailed for several years.\n\nBut not forever. In 1989, after various appeals, Emira was held to be Lymon's widow. She was then in a position to continue her suit against Levy, but she settled instead. She sold her half-interest in the song's copyright in exchange for a six-figure sum and future royalties.\n\nThe Teenagers' suit against Levy continued to wend its way through the courts, however. \"Thirty-one years after the fact they show up, after all the witnesses that could dispute them are dead, and say they wrote it,\" says the incredulous lawyer for Levy's estate, Ira Greenberg (yes, the same fellow who'd earlier sued Levy on Emira Lymon's behalf). He argued that \"there was no hard evidence\" to support Merchant and Santiago's claims, and that in any event the case should be dismissed because of their long delay.\n\nBut the Teenagers' current attorney, Carl Person (Bennett was disqualified, since he was potentially a witness in the case), maintained the delay was caused by \"duress\" -- namely, the Teenagers' longtime fear of Levy and his association with organized crime. \"It's the first thing we thought of, 'We should sue,' \" Merchant explains now. \"But something inside me said, 'You can't do that to these people.' \"\n\nIn the end, the nine jurors believed that Merchant and Santiago were prevented from timelier litigation because they feared for their lives; the jury also believed that the pair were co-authors of the song. Greenberg is ominously predicting a flood of similar lawsuits, given this \"major incentive for people to suddenly show up and say they wrote songs.\" But as it stands, Emira Eagle Lymon will continue to receive her half of the royalties, Frankie's half. The two surviving Teenagers will own the other half of the copyright and its earnings, plus half the royalties dating from 1969.\n\nBut nothing seems to stand for very long when it comes to this doo-wop ditty. Person, the Teenagers' attorney, intends to go back to court to win his clients two-thirds of the copyright instead of half. (Bennett, their previous attorney, insists that the verdict already gives them two-thirds.) Ira Greenberg intends to file motions asking Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald to overturn the verdict. If she declines, the accounting process and trial for damages -- necessary to determine exactly how much the Teenagers stand to pocket -- will go on for months. Followed, it seems certain, by further appeals.\n\n\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love?\" is starting to take on the aura of the cursed jewel in one of those old adventure movies: It's beautiful, it glimmers, and it brings both riches and grief to its possessors. It's probably a good thing that Jimmy Merchant is getting a nice price on that 1982 Pontiac. In lawsuits, \"it ain't over till the lady in the robe sings,\" Chuck Rubin says. But maybe it won't be over even then."}, {"url": "https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/film/082898love-film-review.html?scp=7&sq=frankie%252520lymon%252520and%252520the%252520teenagers&st=cse", "page_content": "By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER\n\nn the raucous, comic \"Rashomon\" of rock-and-roll titled \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love,\" the brief, meteoric career and busy, turbulent marital life of the singer Frankie Lymon furnish the pretext for a trip through time to the 1950s and '60s, when much of a generation fell under the spell of a new kind of music.\n\n\n\n\n\nNicola Goode/Warner Brothers Those were the days: Larenz Tate as the 50's teen-age pop star Frankie Lymon in \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love,\" directed by Gregory Nava.\n\nAt its most mediocre, this post-mortem farce, built around a battle for Lymon's estate among three women, each claiming to be his wife and the heir to his royalties, is compounded of courtroom scenes that will leave lawyers gnashing their teeth, shaky acting, ludicrous lines, unconvincing locations and backgrounds and cliched efforts to evoke nostalgia and achieve psychological depth through grainy montages.\n\nMusically speaking, Frankie Lymon was pretty much of a one-trick pony who was a 13-year-old soprano from Upper Manhattan at the end of 1955, when his recording of \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\" with four neighborhood boys called the Teenagers catapulted them to doo-wop fame.\n\nBy the summer of 1957, after four hits, a cross-country tour, recordings for an Alan Freed film and an appearance at the London Palladium, Lymon had parted company with the rest of the quintet. His solo career was a failure. He drifted into despair and picked up a heroin habit. But he seemed to have overcome it when, just before a scheduled recording date in a comeback effort in 1968, he died of an overdose.\n\nThe film picks up the story in 1985, a few years after the Diana Ross version of \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\" made the song a hit all over again. According to the film, this brought the major women in Lymon's life out of the woodwork: Halle Berry as Zola Taylor, the glamorous lead singer of the Platters, the supposed first wife; Vivica A. Fox as Elizabeth Waters, a shoplifter who met Lymon after his heyday and said she turned to prostitution to try to help him overcome his drug habit, and Lela Rochon as Emira Eagle, the reserved Southern schoolteacher who married Lymon while he was in the Army, settled with him into a serene domestic life, saw him off on his last fatal trip and buried him. All seem to have a good time with their roles, and Larenz Tate, though far less baby-faced than the original, makes an appealing Lymon.\n\nThe indecorous courtroom contest that makes enemies and friends of the three women as their lives with Lymon are depicted in flashback also brings to the stand Little Richard as an irrepressible witness, situates Pamela Reed on the Surrogate's Court bench as the incredulous and incredibly lenient judge and casts Paul Mazursky as the villain of the piece, Morris Levy, the owner of Roulette Records who collected millions in proceeds from the success of Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers.\n\nLymon's career may have been short and sad, but \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\" finds the melodrama of his life in the exciting music of his time and the tumult of his romances.\n\nPRODUCTION NOTES\n\nWHY DO FOOLS FALL IN LOVE\n\nRating: \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\" is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).
