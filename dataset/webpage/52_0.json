In his 27 years directing the Spartan program, 85 percent of his players who completed their eligibility also left with a degree. In the last 22 years, 65 Spartans have received their undergraduate degrees.\n\n\n\nIn 27 seasons, Izzo has returned Michigan State to national prominence, placed his name in the NCAA record books and become a leader among college basketball coaches.\n\nIzzo\u2019s 666 wins are fifth most by any coach in his first 27 seasons in the history of college basketball. In late November 2009, he passed his mentor Jud Heathcote (340 wins) to become MSU\u2019s all-time winningest coach. When the Spartans beat Ohio State in the quarterfinals of the 2019 Big Ten Tournament, Izzo won his 600th career game. He became one of just two Big Ten coaches with at least 300 conference wins when MSU beat Iowa, 78-70, on Feb. 25, 2020. And when the Spartans beat Maryland on March 6, 2022, the victory gave Izzo 663 overall wins for his career, passing Bob Knight of Indiana for the most overall wins by a Big Ten Head Coach.\n\n\n\nIn the NCAA Tournament, Izzo is at his best, winning at a clip of .697 to rank third among all active coaches with at least 10 tournament games coached. His 53 NCAA Tournament wins are the most ever for a Big Ten coach, and rank sixth all-time. He has led MSU to 24-straight NCAA Tournament appearances, the longest active streak among Division I coaches and tied for the longest streak all-time.\n\n\n\nA 2015 inductee into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame, Izzo led MSU to eight Final Four appearances between 1999 and 2019, becoming just the fourth school in college basketball history to do it in any 21-year span, including just the third since the tournament field expanded to 64 teams in 1985. Izzo is one of just two coaches in NCAA history to reach four Final Fours in his first 10 years of coaching, joining Ohio State\u2019s Fred Taylor, and is just the second coach in NCAA history to appear in eight Final Fours in a 21-year span since the tournament expanded to 64 teams. His eight Final Four appearances rank fifth all-time, first among active coaches and first all-time among Big Ten coaches. Two stats stand out in Izzo\u2019s NCAA Tournament success: 1) MSU is 23-7 in the second game of an NCAA Tournament weekend 2) MSU is 15-12 as the lower-seeded team, while the 15 wins are the most in NCAA Tournament history for any coach.\n\n\n\nThrough 27 seasons, Izzo is one of the most successful coaches in Big Ten history. His .679 winning percentage in Big Ten games ranks fourth all-time among league coaches with at least 10 years of service. In all games, Izzo ranks fourth (.714). With 322 conference victories, Izzo ranks second all-time, trailing just Indiana\u2019s Bob Knight (353 wins). In the 2021-22 regular season finale, the Spartans beat Maryland to give Izzo his 663rd win, passing Knight (662) for the most overall wins by a Big Ten Head Coach.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Izzo brings stability to Michigan State basketball. Including 12 years as an assistant, the 2022-23 season is Izzo\u2019s 40th with the Spartans, as he is the longest serving active Big Ten men\u2019s basketball head coach. He is also a leader among his peers, serving as the NABC President from April 2010-April 2011, while currently serving as an emeritus member of the NABC Board of Directors. He\u2019s also held spots on the John R. Wooden Award Board of Governors and the USA Basketball Collegiate Committee.\n\n\n\nOver the past 25 seasons, Izzo has compiled an impressive 633-239 (.726) record. A quick look at other stats further demonstrates the Spartans\u2019 success over that stretch: 304-134 (.694) in the Big Ten; 349-45 (.886) at the Breslin Center, including a Big Ten record 53-game winning streak; 142-126 (.530) against Top 25 teams (including four wins over No. 1-ranked teams); 87-41 (.680) in postseason play and 53-23 (.697) in the NCAA Tournament.\n\n\n\nIndividually, players have excelled under Izzo. Twelve Spartans (Charlie Bell, Mateen Cleaves, Paul Davis, Draymond Green, Gary Harris, Drew Neitzel, Adreian Payne, Morris Peterson, Jason Richardson, Denzel Valentine, Miles Bridges and Cassius Winston) have earned some form of All-America honors. Valentine earned six different National Player of the Year awards in 2016 (Associated Press, Basketball Times, NABC, NBC, Sports Illustrated and USA TODAY Sports), and Green was named National Player of the Year by the NABC in 2012. Chris Hill was a three-time Academic All-American, including being named the Academic All-American of the Year in 2005, while Neitzel also earned Academic All-America accolades. In 2019-20, Winston became the third player in MSU history to earn multiple consensus All-American honors, while Xavier Tillman Sr. was named a Second Team Academic All-American.\n\nForty-two different players have earned all-conference recognition, including 14 different first-team honorees, six Big Ten Players of the Year (Cleaves, Green, Lucas, Peterson, Valentine, Winston), three Big Ten Freshmen of the Year (Gary Harris, Miles Bridges and Jaren Jackson Jr.) and three Big Ten Defensive Players of the Year (Travis Walton, Jackson Jr. and Tillman Sr.).\n\n\n\nOne of the reasons for Izzo\u2019s success is his ability to recruit some of the nation\u2019s most talented high school players. During his time as head coach, Izzo has recruited 16 McDonald\u2019s All-Americans (Mateen Cleaves - 1996, Jason Richardson - 1999, Marcus Taylor and Zach Randolph - 2000, Kelvin Torbert - 2001, Paul Davis - 2002, Shannon Brown and Brandon Cotton - 2003, Keith Appling - 2010, Branden Dawson - 2011, Gary Harris - 2012, Deyonta Davis - 2015, Miles Bridges and Joshua Langford - 2016, Jaren Jackson Jr. - 2017, Max Christie - 2021). In addition, 12 of the last 23 Michigan Mr. Basketball award winners suited up for the Green and White (1999 - Richardson, 2000 - Taylor, 2001 - Torbert, 2002 - Davis, 2004 - Drew Neitzel, 2009 - Derrick Nix, 2010 - Appling, 2012 - Matt Costello, 2015 - Davis, 2016 - Cassius Winston, 2018 - Foster Loyer, 2021 \u2013 Pierre Brooks), while Shannon Brown won the 2003 Illinois Mr. Basketball Award and Gary Harris won the 2012 Indiana Mr. Basketball Award.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps even more important to Izzo\u2019s success is his ability to take young talent and develop a player\u2019s skills, allowing him to grow as a player and go on to play professionally. Under Izzo, Michigan State has had 23 players selected in the NBA Draft, including 22 since 2000, 11 of whom were first rounders (Mateen Cleaves - 2000 first round, Morris Peterson - 2000 first round, Jason Richardson - 2001 first round, Zach Randolph - 2001 first round, Andre Hutson - 2001 second round, Marcus Taylor - 2002 second round, Erazem Lorbek - 2005 second round, Shannon Brown - 2006 first round, Maurice Ager - 2006 first round, Paul Davis - 2006 second round, Goran Suton - 2009 second round, Draymond Green - 2012 second round, Adreian Payne - 2014 first round, Gary Harris - 2014 first round, Branden Dawson - 2015 second round, Denzel Valentine - 2016 first round, Deyonta Davis - 2016 second round, Jaren Jackson Jr. - 2018 first round, Miles Bridges - 2018 first round, Xavier Tillman Sr. - 2020 second round, Cassius Winston - 2020 second round, Max Christie \u2013 2022 second round).\n\nWhile many players were high school All-Americans, Izzo took others who were not ranked in the top-75 coming out of high school and turned them into NBA talent. In addition, Izzo-recruit Charlie Bell played in the NBA during the 2001-02 season after signing a free agent contract. After a successful stint overseas, Bell played seven more seasons in the NBA. Alan Anderson, a member of the 2005 Final Four team, signed a free agent contract and played two years with the Charlotte Bobcats and, after a stint in Europe, returned for five seasons back in the NBA. In more recent years, Kalin Lucas and Bryn Forbes have also played in the NBA after signing free agent contracts, while Aaron Henry signed a two-way contract with the Philadelphia 76ers in 2021. Numerous other former Spartans have enjoyed lucrative professional careers playing overseas.\n\n\n\nIzzo has also emerged as a teacher, not only to his players, but also his assistant coaches. Three current Division I head coaches served as assistants to Izzo, including Brian Gregory (South Florida), Stan Heath (Eastern Michigan) and Dwayne Stephens (Western Michigan). In total, eight former assistants have earned head coaching jobs. Former long-time assistant Mike Garland spent three seasons as head coach at Cleveland State following an initial seven-year stint at MSU, while Stan Joplin was also head coach at Toledo for 12 seasons, Jim Boylen served as head coach at Utah for four seasons, Heath served as head coach at Kent State, Arkansas and South Florida over 13 seasons and Tom Crean was the head coach at Marquette, Indiana and Georgia. The current coaching staff features two former assistants who were head coaches before returning to East Lansing \u2013 Doug Wojcik spent nine seasons between Tulsa and College of Charleston and Mark Montgomery was the head coach at Northern Illinois for 10 seasons.\n\n\n\nThe Spartans finished the 2021-22 season with a 23-13 overall record and were selected to the NCAA Tournament for the 24th-straight season, extending the longest streak in Big Ten history. The 24-year run also ranked tied for the third-longest in NCAA history and was the second-longest active streak in the nation. Izzo tied former Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski for the most consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances and entered the 2022-23 season as the active leader for consecutive appearances.\n\n\n\nMichigan State finished the 2020-21 season with a 15-13 overall record and advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the 23rd-straight season, the longest streak in Big Ten history and the third-longest active streak among Division I schools. In a season shortened to just 28 games due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Spartans opened the season with six-straight non-league wins, including a 75-69 win at Duke in the Champions Classic. After starting the Big Ten Conference season with three-straight losses and a 2-7 record through nine games, MSU finished the season with a 7-4 mark against Big Ten opponents and closed out the regular season with five wins in its last seven games, including wins against No. 5 Illinois, No. 4 Ohio State and No. 2 Michigan.\n\n\n\nThe 2019-20 season finished with Michigan State clinching a share of the Big Ten regular season title for the third-straight year. The Spartans won their last five regular season games and six of the last seven overall, to finish 14-6 and claim a share of the title. While the postseason was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, MSU finished the season with a 22-9 overall record and a 14-6 record in league play. The Spartans opened the season ranked No. 1 in the country in the Associated Press pre-season poll, the first time in program history the team was the top-ranked team in the preseason. MSU finished the season ranked second in the country in assists per game (17.7), while also ranked fourth in field goal percentage defense (37.9 percent) and ninth in total rebounds per game (40.6). Of the 28 20-win seasons in Michigan State history, Izzo has been involved in 25 of them, 20 as a head coach and five as an assistant.\n\n\n\nThe 2018-19 season was among the most memorable in Michigan State history under Izzo. The Spartans finished with a 32-7 overall record, the fifth 30-win season under Izzo, won a share of the Big Ten regular season championship, won the Big Ten Tournament Championship for a conference-record sixth time and reached the Final Four for the eighth time in 21 years and the 10th time in program history. Along the way, MSU won the Las Vegas Invitational, beat Michigan three times, including a 65-60 decision in the Big Ten Tournament Championship, and toppled No. 1 Duke, 68-67, in the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament. MSU finished the year leading the nation in total rebounds (1,580) and total assists (715), while ranking among the top-10 in the country in six other categories: assists per game (3rd, 18.3 apg), total blocks (3rd, 205), field goal percentage defense (3rd, 38.1%), rebound margin (5th, 8.8 rpg), defensive rebounds per game (6th, 29.72 rpg) and blocked shots per game (7th, 5.3 bpg).\n\n\n\nMichigan State finished the 2017-18 season with a 30-5 overall record, the fourth 30-win season under Izzo, advanced to the NCAA Tournament for a Big Ten-record 21st straight season and won the program\u2019s eighth Big Ten regular season championship. The Spartans set a school record for most wins in a regular season (28), won their first outright Big Ten Regular Season title since 2009, won 16 Big Ten Conference games for the first time and had the fewest losses in a regular season since the 2000-01 team went 24-3. The New Year started with MSU moving into the No. 1 spot in the national rankings for the fifth time in program history, and the fourth time under Izzo. The Spartans had win streaks of 14 games and 13 games during the season, earning a No. 3 seed in the Midwest Region of the NCAA Tournament. MSU finished the year leading the nation in assists per game (19.1), blocked shots per game (7.2), field goal percentage defense (36.7%) and rebound margin (+10.7).\n\n\n\nThe 2016-17 season saw Michigan State advance to the NCAA Tournament for a Big Ten-record 20th straight season. It was not an easy road, however, to reach the postseason. Before the season started, the Spartans lost senior forwards Ben Carter and Gavin Schilling to season-ending knee injuries. MSU\u2019s November was arguably the toughest opening month in college basketball history. In addition to games against four ranked opponents, all away from home, the Spartans traveled more than 13,600 miles in 22 days with trips to Hawaii, New York, North Carolina and the Bahamas. In December, the Spartans played seven contests without leading scorer Miles Bridges. Despite all the adversity, including losing a third player, Eron Harris, to a season-ending knee injury in February, the Spartans pulled together and used a 5-2 mark in February to earn their way into the NCAA Tournament. When MSU defeated Miami in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, the Spartans secured their 20th win of the season. It was quite an accomplishment for a team that was one of the least experienced (321st) and shortest (291st) in the nation according to KenPom.com.\n\n\n\nThe 2015-16 season was a milestone year both for Coach Izzo and the Spartans. Michigan State opened the year by winning its first 13 games, establishing a new school mark for best start to a season. When the Spartans defeated Boston College on November 26, Izzo became the 91st coach in NCAA history to record 500 career wins, with at least 10 seasons in Division I, and just the eighth coach to accomplish the feat in his first 21 seasons. He also became just the 18th coach to win 500 career games in his first collegiate head-coaching stop, and was the eighth-fastest coach to reach 500 wins among those who did it all at one school, accomplishing the feat in 699 games.\n\n\n\nOn December 7, MSU rose to No. 1 in the regular-season polls for just the fourth time in school history, and the third time under Izzo. The Spartans would hold the top spot for a school-record four weeks. Following a perfect 13-0 non-conference slate, Michigan State would finish second in the Big Ten with a 13-5 mark. A victory over Northwestern gave Izzo 513 for his career, moving past Purdue\u2019s Gene Keady for second-most wins at a Big Ten School, trailing only Bob Knight (662). In the Big Ten Tournament, the Spartans defeated Ohio State, Maryland and Purdue to become the first school in Big Ten history to hold five conference tournament titles. The Spartans earned a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament, where they were upset by No. 15 Middle Tennessee. MSU finished the season with a 29-6 record, matching the fourth-best win total in school history, as the Spartans\u2019 26 regular-season victories equaled a school record. Izzo\u2019s Spartans were the only team in the nation to win 27 or more games every year from 2011-12 to 2015-16.\n\n\n\nStatistically, the 2015-16 season was one of the most impressive in school history. Michigan State led the nation in 3-point field-goal percentage (.434), rebound margin (+11.4), assists per game (20.5) and total assists (719). The Spartans ranked in the top three in eight different categories, and in the Top 10 in 11 different categories. It marked the fifth time in Izzo\u2019s career that the Spartans led the nation in rebounding margin. MSU also set school single-season records for assists (719), 3-point field goals made (321) and blocked shots (177). The 719 assists were the 22nd-best total in NCAA history, while MSU recorded an assist on a nation\u2019s-best 71.3 percent of its field goals. At 79.8 points per game, the 2015-16 squad was the highest-scoring team of the Izzo era, and the highest-scoring team since 1985-86. In Big Ten Conference games, MSU led the conference in 12 stat categories and was ranked in the top three in 17 of the 21 stats.\n\n\n\nThe 2014-15 Spartans provided a lesson in resiliency and the power of togetherness. MSU opened the season ranked in the polls, but by Christmas, the Spartans had fallen out of the rankings. Following a home loss to Illinois on Feb. 7, the Spartans stood at 15-8, including just 6-4 in conference. MSU closed the regular season by winning six of its last eight games, including a final week that featured a come-from-behind home finale win over Purdue on Senior Day despite a first-half injury to Branden Dawson, and a regular-season finale victory at Indiana without Dawson. In the Big Ten Tournament, MSU defeated Ohio State and No. 8 Maryland before falling to No. 6 Wisconsin in overtime. The Spartans were disappointed to have let a championship opportunity slip away, but entered the NCAA Tournament on a mission.\n\n\n\nHaving entered March just hoping to secure a spot in the NCAA Tournament, the postseason run turned a good season into a great one. As the No. 7 seed, MSU opened with a victory over No. 10 Georgia. In the third round, MSU faced No. 2 Virginia for the second-straight season, defeating the Cavaliers to advance to a nation\u2019s-best seventh Sweet 16 in the last eight seasons. At the East Regional in Syracuse, the Spartans trailed at the half against both No. 3 Oklahoma in the Sweet 16 and No. 4 Louisville in the Elite Eight, before rallying for a pair of victories to reach the Final Four. Making its nation\u2019s-best seventh Final Four appearance in the last 17 seasons, MSU got off to a quick start against No. 1 Duke before falling to the eventual National Champion Blue Devils. MSU would finish 27-12, 12-6 in the Big Ten.\n\n\n\nThe senior class of 2015 finished tied for the second-winningest class in school history with 112 wins. The 2014-15 Spartans established school single-season records for assists (646) and blocks (176), while the 294 made 3-pointers were second-most in school history. Averaging 16.6 assists per game, the Spartans ranked fifth in the nation, while ranking seventh in assist-to-turnover ratio (1.5). Defensively, MSU posted a .396 field-goal percentage defense, marking the fourth-straight season that Spartan opponents shot less than 40 percent from the field.\n\n\n\nThe 2013-14 season was not short of highlights. It started early, with No. 2 MSU knocking off No. 1 Kentucky, 78-74, on Nov. 12 in Chicago, in what was the earliest game ever between No. 1 and No. 2. One week later, MSU ascended to No. 1 in the polls, a position it would hold for three weeks \u2013 establishing a school record at the time for the longest stay at No. 1. In late November, the Spartans captured the Coaches Vs. Cancer Tournament title in Brooklyn, marking MSU\u2019s first regular-season, neutral-site tournament championship since December 1998.\n\n\n\nInjuries proved to be a common storyline during the 2013-14 campaign, as six different players, including each one of MSU\u2019s top four scorers, missed multiple games due to injury or illness for a total of 29 games missed. In 19 of 38 games, including 13 of 18 Big Ten contests, the Spartans were without their full allotment of players due to injury. In nine games, Michigan State was without two of its regular rotation players. In total, 11 different Spartans started at least one game, as Izzo employed 15 different starting lineups. The fluctuation led to inconsistent results through much of the Big Ten slate, but by the end of the regular season, MSU was getting healthy.\n\n\n\nPlaying at full strength, the Spartans played at a different level in the postseason, steamrolling through the Big Ten Tournament. The championship game featured the third meeting of the season between in-state rivals Michigan State and Michigan, marking the first time the Spartans and Wolverines would meet in the conference tournament. Although UM won the two regular-season meetings, this was the first time MSU would feature a complete roster, pulling away early in the second half to capture the fourth tournament championship in school history with a 69-55 victory.\n\n\n\nMSU entered the NCAA Tournament as the No. 4 seed in the East Region, but was also a popular pick to advance to the Final Four and even cut down the championship nets. In the second round, Adreian Payne scored an MSU NCAA Tournament record 41 points to defeat Delaware, 93-78. Two days later, the Spartans advanced to the Sweet 16 with an 80-73 win over Harvard. Playing in the East Regional in New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden, Michigan State defeated No. 1 seed Virginia, 61-59. In the Elite Eight, the Spartans held a nine-point lead in the second half against Connecticut, but the eventual National Champion Huskies would rally for a 60-54 victory.\n\n\n\nThe 2013-14 Spartans finished with a 29-9 record, including 12-6 in the Big Ten, finishing tied for second. The 29 wins tied for the fourth-best total in school history, while MSU established single-season school records for assists (637), made 3-point field goals (307), and blocks (174). Michigan State led the conference in field-goal percentage defense (.397), while ranking second in field-goal percentage (.474) and 3-point field-goal percentage (.392). The Spartans also finished with an all-time low 11.6 turnovers per contest.\n\n\n\nIn 2012-13, the Spartans collected a 27-9 record, including 13-5 in the Big Ten, against perhaps the nation\u2019s most difficult schedule, playing 13 games against ranked opponents. The slate was especially difficult down the stretch as 14 of MSU\u2019s last 18 games (postseason included) were against opponents that participated in the NCAA Tournament. Michigan State advanced to its 16th consecutive NCAA Tournament as the No. 3 seed in the Midwest Region, and advanced to the Sweet 16 for the fifth time in the last six seasons, tied for the most in the nation.\n\n\n\nOn Jan. 16, 2013, Izzo recorded his 200th conference victory against Penn State, joining Mike Krzyzewski (Duke) and Jim Boeheim (Syracuse) as the only active coaches in a power conference with 200 conference wins at their current school. In April, Izzo received the Wayman Tisdale Humanitarian Award, honoring an individual in college basketball who has made a significant impact on society.\n\n\n\nThe Spartans proved to be dominant defensively once again in 2012-13, pacing the Big Ten in field-goal percentage defense (.390) and steals (8.0 spg), while ranking second in scoring defense (59.1 ppg) and third in 3-point field-goal percentage defense (.300). MSU also continued to be strong on the glass, ranking second in the Big Ten and 10th in the nation with a +7.6 rebound margin, marking the 11th time that an Izzo-coached team ranked in the Top 10 in the nation.\n\n\n\nThe 2011-12 season was one of Izzo\u2019s most rewarding as head coach. The Spartans entered the season unranked, returning only two players who averaged more than 20 minutes a game the previous season. MSU opened the year with neutral-site losses to No. 1 North Carolina and No. 6 Duke, but responded with 15 straight victories, including road wins at No. 23 Gonzaga and No. 18 Wisconsin, marking the Spartans\u2019 first win in Madison since 2001. Keyed by a mid-February win at No. 3 Ohio State, MSU would go on to capture a share of the Big Ten regular-season championship, the seventh of the Izzo era, and head to the Big Ten Tournament where it defeated Ohio State to capture the third Big Ten Tournament title in school history, and the first since 2000. Michigan State was rewarded with a No. 1 seed in the West Region of the NCAA Tournament, where it would advance to the Sweet 16 for the 10th time in the last 15 years, good for second most in the nation. MSU would finish with a 29-8 record.\n\n\n\nStatistically, the Spartans finished the 2011-12 season ranked second in the nation in field-goal percentage defense (.379), the best effort by a Spartan squad since 1959. Once again, the Spartans were a dominant presence on the glass, ranking fifth in the nation in rebounding margin (+8.0), and pacing the Big Ten for the 12th time in the last 15 seasons, and the 13th time in his career.\n\n\n\nFor his efforts, Izzo was named the 2012 Big Ten Coach of the Year by both the league\u2019s media and coaches. He also was named Division I National Coach of the Year by the NABC, and was CBSSports.com\u2019s pick for national coach of the year as well.\n\n\n\nThe 2010-11 Spartans finished with a 19-15 mark and advanced to a 14th-straight NCAA Tournament. MSU faced a difficult regular-season schedule that included 18 of 33 games against the RPI Top 50 and 23 of 33 against the RPI Top 100.\n\n\n\nMichigan State turned in another great season in 2009-10, capturing a share of a second-straight Big Ten Championship and advancing to a sixth Final Four in 12 seasons. With MSU\u2019s 106-68 victory over UMass in the sixth game of the season, Izzo recorded his 341st victory, becoming Michigan State\u2019s all-time winningest coach. The Spartans opened Big Ten play with a school-best 9-0 start and captured a share of the regular-season crown with a 14-4 mark. Overall, MSU would finish with a 28-9 record.\n\n\n\nThe Spartans opened the 2010 NCAA Tournament as a No. 5 seed and advanced through the first weekend with narrow victories over New Mexico State (70-67) and Maryland (85-83). In the Midwest Regional, the Spartans won two more close games, defeating Northern Iowa (59-52) and Tennessee (70-69) to advance to the program\u2019s eighth Final Four and the sixth in the last 12 seasons under Izzo. Michigan State led the nation in rebounding margin for the fourth time in Izzo\u2019s career, out-rebounding opponents by a +8.6 margin.\n\n\n\nThe 2008-09 season was one of the best in the history of Spartan basketball. Michigan State advanced to its fifth Final Four in 11 seasons, becoming just the fifth school in the history of college basketball to accomplish that feat. During the regular season, the Spartans won the Big Ten Championship with a 15-3 league record, including a school-best 8-1 mark on the road. MSU won the league title by four games, equaling the second-greatest margin in conference history. Overall, Michigan State finished the season with a 31-7 record, the third-highest win total in school history. For his efforts, Izzo was named Big Ten Coach of the Year for the second time in his career.\n\n\n\nIn the NCAA Tournament, Michigan State advanced through the first weekend with wins over Robert Morris and USC. In the Sweet 16, the Spartans took out defending National Champion Kansas. In the Elite Eight, MSU beat No. 1 seed and No. 1 ranked Louisville, marking just the third victory over the top-ranked team in The Associated Press Top 25 in school history. At the Final Four in Detroit\u2019s Ford Field, the Spartans beat No. 1 seed Connecticut before eventually falling to North Carolina in the title game.\n\n\n\nMichigan State led the nation in rebounding margin for the third time in Izzo\u2019s career, out-rebounding opponents by a +9.3 margin. It marked the eighth time that an Izzo-coached team ranked in the top 10 in the nation. The Spartans also proved to possess a high-powered attack, leading the Big Ten in scoring offense (72.0 ppg).\n\n\n\nIzzo directed Michigan State to a 27-9 record in 2007-08. The season finished with a trip to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament, marking MSU\u2019s seventh trip to the regionals in the last 11 years. The 27 wins marked the fifth-largest total in school history at the time, while the 24 regular-season victories were the then third-largest regular-season total for MSU. The Spartans were a perfect 17-0 at home, good for the first perfect home season since 2001 and the fourth in Breslin Center history.\n\n\n\nThe 2007-08 Spartans led the Big Ten in rebounding margin (+6.8). In league games, MSU paced the conference in field-goal percentage (.474) for the fifth-straight season, becoming the first school in league history to accomplish that feat.\n\n\n\nMichigan State finished with a 23-12 mark in 2006-07. The Spartans had to overcome a large amount of adversity and a very difficult Big Ten schedule to advance to a 10th-straight NCAA Tournament. The Spartans also did something for the first time in school history \u2013 recording Michigan State\u2019s first home win over a No. 1-ranked team, with a 64-55 decision over Wisconsin.\n\n\n\nThe 2006-07 Spartans excelled by getting back to basics \u2013 rebounding and defense. On the glass, the Spartans led the Big Ten in rebounding margin (+7.0). Defensively, MSU allowed opponents just 57.2 points per game, the lowest total since the 1951-52 squad allowed 56.0 points. Opponents also shot just 38.4 percent from the field, the lowest percentage since 1958-59 (.379). Nationally, the Spartans ranked sixth in scoring defense and field-goal percentage defense and eighth in rebounding margin.\n\n\n\nIn 2005-06, Michigan State finished with a 22-12 mark. The Spartans played one of the nation\u2019s toughest schedules, playing more games against teams ranked in the RPI top-25 (13) and top-50 (18) than any other school. In Big Ten games, MSU led the conference in five stat categories including free-throw percentage (.781), field-goal percentage (.469), rebounding defense (30.1), rebounding margin (+4.2) and assists (15.81 apg).\n\n\n\nMichigan State returned to the Final Four in 2005, becoming the only team to appear in four Final Fours between 1999 and 2005. The Spartans finished the season with a 26-7 mark, including 22-5 in the regular season. Since joining the Big Ten, only three Spartan teams finished the regular season with fewer losses.\n\n\n\nIn the NCAA Tournament, MSU defeated No. 1 Duke and No. 2 Kentucky in the Austin Regional, becoming the first team in tournament history to defeat the Blue Devils and the Wildcats in the same year. Despite losing to North Carolina in the Final Four, Izzo was named the 2005 Clair Bee Award winner, recognizing the Division I men\u2019s basketball coach who has made the most significant positive contribution to his sport.\n\n\n\nNot only did the 2004-05 Spartans win, they were also statistically impressive, ranking in the top 15 nationally in six statistical categories, including free-throw percentage (3rd, .777), scoring margin (7th, +13.1), assists per game (10th, 17.1 apg), field-goal percentage (11th, .487), rebound margin (11th, +6.8) and scoring offense (13th, 78.5 ppg). MSU led the Big Ten in scoring for the second-straight year with 78.5 points per game \u2013 its highest scoring average since 1985-86 (83.1 ppg).\n\n\n\nDuring the season, Izzo recorded his 232nd win at MSU, moving past Benjamin Van Alstyne for the second most number of career wins in Spartan coaching history. In the summer of 2005, Izzo traveled to Kuwait to take part in \u201cOperation Hardwood - Hoops With The Troops.\u201d Izzo was one of eight coaches and sports personalities coaching 13-member military basketball teams on Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, from Aug. 27-31. Camp Arifjan defeated the other bases to win the championship under the direction of Coach Izzo. Izzo made a return trip to Kuwait in May 2006.\n\n\n\nIn 2003-04, MSU opened the season with a 5-7 mark after taking on one of the most difficult non-conference schedules in NCAA history. Rather than give up, Izzo and the Spartans rallied to win 12 of the next 15 games, finishing just one game out of first place in the Big Ten at 12-4. For the year, MSU posted an 18-12 mark. Michigan State became the first team in Big Ten history to lead the conference in scoring offense (71.3 ppg), field-goal percentage (.522), 3-point field-goal percentage (.434) and free-throw percentage (.777) in the same season.\n\n\n\nOn Feb. 4, 2004, MSU defeated Iowa, 89-72, as Izzo recorded the 200th victory of his Spartan career, becoming just the third coach in MSU history to accomplish that feat. He also became the eighth head coach in NCAA history to record 200 wins in his first nine seasons. Ten days later, Izzo became just the third coach in Big Ten history to record 100 league wins in his first nine seasons, joining Bob Knight and Gene Keady as MSU defeated Minnesota, 69-58, on Feb. 14.\n\n\n\nThe 2002-03 season was a study in perseverance. Izzo rallied his team to win the final four regular-season games and eight of the last 10 conference games to finish 10-6 in the Big Ten, good for third place in the league. Michigan State made even bigger noise during the NCAA Tournament. The No. 7 seed Spartans easily dismissed Colorado in the first round, setting up a matchup with the No. 2 seed Florida Gators. The Spartans shocked many experts with a 68-46 victory in the Gators\u2019 home state. In the Sweet 16, MSU defeated defending national champion Maryland in a thrilling two-point game, before eventually falling to the No. 1 seed Texas Longhorns in the Lone Star State.\n\n\n\nThe Elite Eight appearance was the fourth for MSU between 1999 and 2003. During that time period, no other school made more than two trips. In fact, since the NCAA Tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, just six programs (Duke, Florida, Kentucky, Michigan State, North Carolina and UNLV) have advanced to four Elite Eights in any five-year period.\n\nThe 2001-02 season may prove to be one of Izzo\u2019s finest. Despite losing 81 percent of the scoring load from 2000-01, and having three key players miss several games with injuries, Izzo led the Spartans to a 10-6 Big Ten mark (19-12 overall), finishing just one game out of first place. MSU won 10 of the last 13 regular-season games and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\n\n\nIn 2000-01, Izzo earned NABC National Coach of the Year and District 11 Coach of the Year honors for leading MSU to its third straight Final Four and fourth straight regular-season Big Ten Championship. MSU became just the fourth school in Big Ten history to win four-straight league titles.\n\n\n\nMSU opened the season by winning its first 12 games to establish the best start in school history. On Dec. 25, 2000, the Spartans earned the top spot in The Associated Press Top 25, marking the first time they held the No. 1 position in the AP Poll since 1979. In Big Ten action, Michigan State posted a 13-3 record to win a share of the league crown. The Big Ten finale vs. Michigan marked Izzo\u2019s 100th Big Ten game. Through his first 100 games, Izzo posted a 72-28 mark, the fifth-best record in Big Ten history.\n\n\n\nIn the 2001 NCAA Tournament, Izzo guided the Spartans to a third-straight Final Four. For a third consecutive season, Michigan State earned a No. 1 seed. MSU won the first three games by double figures, establishing a record with nine straight NCAA Tournament victories by double digits. When MSU defeated Temple, 69-62, in the South Regional Final, the Spartans became just the ninth school to reach three-straight Final Fours and just the third since the NCAA Tournament field expanded to 64 teams in 1985. On the season, MSU finished with a 28-5 record.\n\n\n\nMichigan State led the nation in rebound margin for the second straight season at +15.4 boards per game, tying the fifth-largest margin in Division I history (greatest since 1980). The Spartans also ranked 13th in the nation in scoring defense (61.8 ppg).\n\n\n\nIn 1999-2000, Michigan State captured the second NCAA Championship in school history and its third straight regular season Big Ten Championship. MSU also won at least 30 games for the second straight season, posting a 32-7 mark, becoming just the second Big Ten school to accomplish that feat. The 65 wins over the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 seasons were the greatest two-year total in the history of the Big Ten. MSU also repeated as Big Ten Tournament champions.\n\n\n\nIzzo led MSU to consecutive Final Fours for the first time in school history. For his efforts, Izzo was named USBWA District V Coach of the Year and NABC District 11 Coach of the Year. Izzo also recorded his 100th career victory in a Jan. 11, 2000, 77-71 overtime win over Indiana in the Breslin Center.\n\n\n\nFor the second consecutive season, Michigan State earned a No. 1 seed in the Midwest Region of the NCAA Tournament. After disposing of Valparaiso and Utah in Cleveland, the Spartans moved on to the Sweet 16 at the Palace of Auburn Hills, where they recorded come-from-behind victories versus Syracuse and Iowa State. In the Final Four, MSU defeated Wisconsin for the fourth time that season. The Spartans then captured their second NCAA title in school history, defeating Florida, 89-76.\n\n\n\nIn 1998-99, Izzo directed the Spartans on a magical run to the program\u2019s first appearance in the NCAA Final Four since 1979. Michigan State posted a record of 33-5, establishing a school record for most wins in a season. For his efforts, Izzo was named the Basketball Times National Coach of the Year and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) District 11 Coach of the Year. Throughout the Big Ten season, Michigan State established itself as the class program of the conference. Izzo directed the school to its second-straight Big Ten title. The Spartans followed up a 15-1 Big Ten regular season by capturing their first Big Ten Tournament championship. The 15 league wins tied a school record for most victories in conference play, while the Spartans\u2019 93.8 winning percentage established a school record.\n\n\n\nWhereas MSU\u2019s success in 1998-99 was expected, the Spartans took the college basketball world by storm in 1997-98. Izzo became the first MSU coach to earn Associated Press National Coach of the Year honors, leading MSU to a 22-8 record and a share of the Big Ten title. The Spartans posted a 13-3 mark in conference, earning Izzo Big Ten Coach of the Year honors.\n\n\n\nOver the course of the 1997-98 season, Izzo and his team finished the year ranked No. 10 nationally by USA Today/ESPN, marking the first time the Spartans had finished in the Top 10 since 1995. In addition to his AP award, Izzo was named National Coach of the Year by Basketball News and the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA). Basketball Times selected Izzo as its Mideast Coach of the Year.\n\n\n\nDuring Izzo\u2019s first season as head coach in 1995-96, he directed the Green and White to an overall slate of 16-16, including 9-9 in the Big Ten. Izzo recorded four wins over Top 25 teams. In 1996-97, Izzo guided the Green and White cagers to an overall mark of 17-12, including a Big Ten ledger of 9-9. Izzo led the Spartans to the second round of the NIT in each of his first two seasons.\n\n\n\nIn his 40th season as a member of the MSU coaching staff, Izzo has been with the Spartan program since taking a part-time assistant coaching position in 1983. An assistant coach with the Spartans from 1983-86, Izzo left MSU in May of 1986 to become the top assistant and recruiting coordinator at Tulsa. But, on June 10 of the same year, Izzo returned to East Lansing when Spartan assistant Mike Deane left to become head coach at Siena College.\n\n\n\nKnown as a tireless worker both on the recruiting trail and in the office, his hard work and loyalty were rewarded in July 1990, when Jud Heathcote appointed him associate head coach. His dutiful efforts were further recognized when, on March 30, 1993, then-MSU Athletics Director Merrily Dean Baker recommended both a one-year contract extension for Heathcote through the 1994-95 season and that Izzo be appointed head coach upon Jud\u2019s retirement. The MSU Board of Trustees accepted both recommendations on April 9, 1994.\n\nIzzo originally came to MSU from Northern Michigan, where he had been an assistant from 1979-83. He was named a part-time assistant at MSU in September 1983. When former assistant Edgar Wilson left in November 1983, Izzo became a full-time assistant.\n\n\n\nIzzo played guard for NMU\u2019s basketball team from 1973-77, and was voted the team\u2019s MVP as a senior. He was also a third-team Division II All-America pick that year and established the Wildcat record for most minutes played in a season. Following his graduation from NMU in 1977, Izzo took over as head coach at Ishpeming High School and served in that position for the 1977-78 campaign.\n\n\n\nA native of Iron Mountain, Michigan, Izzo and former NFL head coach Steve Mariucci were Iron Mountain High School teammates in football, basketball, baseball and track. As college roommates at Northern Michigan, Izzo walked on to the basketball team, while Mariucci did the same with football. Both would go on to earn Division II All-America honors. Despite their busy schedules, they remain the closest of friends. For 10 years, they co-hosted a golf tournament in Iron Mountain to raise money for the community, including a fitness center for the high school.\n\n\n\nIn 1990, Izzo was inducted into the Northern Michigan University Hall of Fame and was selected as an inductee into the Upper Peninsula Hall of Fame during the summer of 1998. He was inducted into the National Italian-American Sports Hall of Fame in 2011, and the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 2015. He received the sport\u2019s ultimate honor when his election into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame was announced on April 4, 2016. He was officially enshrined in Springfield, Massachusetts, on Sept. 9, 2016.\n\n\n\nIn 2001, Izzo received honorary degrees from both Northern Michigan and Michigan State, delivering the commencement address at both graduation ceremonies.\n\n\n\nIzzo is also an active volunteer in the community. Among his many efforts, he is very active with Coaches Vs. Cancer, Volunteers of America and Sparrow Hospital. In 2009, Izzo was presented the Coaches Vs. Cancer Champion Award, recognizing his work and leadership in the fight to save lives from cancer.\n\n\n\nIzzo and his wife, Lupe, created the Izzo Legacy Fund in 2019 to formalize their commitment to the Mid-Michigan community. The Izzo Legacy Fund helps to raise money and contributions to charitable causes in the area.\n\n\n\nIzzo was born Jan. 30, 1955. His family includes his wife, Lupe, daughter, Raquel, and son, Steven.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/33346721/michigan-state-coach-tom-izzo-says-college-basketball-get-rid-handshake-line", "page_content": "Any idea to rid college basketball of the traditional postgame handshake line in the wake of Sunday's incident involving Michigan coach Juwan Howard striking an opposing coach in the face would be a \"farce,\" Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said.\n\nThe suggestion to do away with the handshake line has come up after Howard hit Wisconsin assistant coach Joe Krabbenhoft in the face as tempers flared following Sunday's game.\n\n\"That, to me, would be the biggest farce, joke, ridiculous nature of anything I've ever heard of,\" Izzo told reporters Monday. \"We've already taught these poor 18-year-olds that when you're told to go to class and you don't like it, you can leave.

We've already told these kids that it's hard to hold them accountable.\n\n\"And now we're going to tell them to not man up and walk down a line to someone who's kicked your butt and have enough class to shake their hand is utterly ridiculous.

Let's try to do that.\"\n\nHoward was suspended five games -- the remainder of the regular season -- and fined $40,000, the Big Ten Conference said Monday. Wisconsin coach Greg Gard was fined $10,000 for violating the conference's sportsmanship policy.\n\nHoward and Gard exchanged words in the handshake line following the Badgers' 77-63 victory, with Howard putting his finger in Gard's face and grabbing Gard's shirt before being surrounded by several players and coaches. Krabbenhoft then came over in the middle of the scrum and exchanged words with Howard, and Howard then reached out and struck Krabbenhoft's face.\n\nThe incident continued to elevate, with players pushing and shoving. Three players have been suspended after appearing to throw punches during the melee.\n\nBut to do away with one of college basketball's traditions because of one incident would be a mistake, Izzo said.\n\n\"That's not happening here,\" Izzo said. \"So if some team doesn't want to shake hands, you're going to see 15 of my guys walk down and shake air.

Izzo has the most wins in school history and his teams have earned invitations to 23 consecutive NCAA tournaments without a single losing season as a head coach. In addition, MSU set the Big Ten record for the longest home court winning streak between 1998 and 2002. Several of these accomplishments led former ESPN analyst Andy Katz to deem Michigan State the top college basketball program for the decade of 1998 to 2007.\n\nIzzo is currently the longest-tenured coach in the Big Ten Conference, and his teams are often recognized for their rebounding prowess and defensive tenacity. He has won four national coach of the year awards and maintains a considerable coaching tree\u2014several of his former assistants are currently head coaches at other Division I schools. Izzo has won ten regular-season conference titles, the third most in conference history. He has also won the most Big Ten Tournament titles (six) in conference history. Izzo is second all-time in Big Ten wins (311 through 2021), trailing only Bob Knight.\n\nBiography\n\nPlaying career\n\nIzzo, who is of Italian and Finnish descent, was born and raised in Iron Mountain in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, near the border of Wisconsin. In his hometown he met best friend and former NFL head coach Steve Mariucci. Both he and his friend attended Iron Mountain High where they were teammates on the football, basketball and track teams. At Northern Michigan University in Marquette, where they were roommates, Izzo played guard for the men's basketball team from 1973 to 1977. In his senior season, he set a school record for minutes played and was named a Division II All-American.\n\nEarly coaching career\n\nAfter graduating from Northern Michigan, Izzo was head coach at Ishpeming High School for one season. He then took an assistant coaching job at Northern Michigan University from 1979 to 1983. Izzo was then named a part-time assistant at Michigan State in September 1983. After a short two-month stay in 1986 as an assistant coach at University of Tulsa, Izzo returned to Michigan State when assistant Mike Deane left to become head coach at Siena College. Prior to the 1990\u201391 season, then coach Jud Heathcote elevated Izzo to associate head coach. After Heathcote's retirement following the 1994\u201395 season and upon both Heathcote and the Michigan State Athletic Director's recommendation, Izzo was named the new head coach of men's basketball for MSU.\n\nHead coach at Michigan State\n\nHired as head coach at Michigan State in 1995, Izzo is currently the longest-tenured basketball coach in the Big Ten Conference. He became the coach with the most wins in school history after winning his 341st game on November 29, 2009, to surpass Heathcote. In his first two seasons as head coach, Izzo went 9\u20139 finishing 6th and 7th in the conference and failed to make the NCAA Tournament. In 1998, MSU's record in conference improved to 13\u20133 and Izzo won the first of his ten regular-season Big Ten championships. 1998 also saw Michigan State begin a streak of 22 straight NCAA Tournament appearances, which is the 3rd longest current streak among Division I teams. Izzo has a record of 52\u201321 in the NCAA Tournament. In 1999, Izzo won his first of six Big Ten Tournament titles, and went to his first Final Four, the first of three straight Final Four appearances, joining Krzyzewski and Ben Howland as the only three coaches who have made three consecutive Final Fours since the NCAA Tournament bracket expanded to 64 teams in 1985. In the instate rivalry with Michigan, Izzo's official record against the Wolverines is 24\u201314, although Michigan vacated five of their wins in the series at the start of his head coaching career.\n\nIn 2000, Izzo led MSU to its second NCAA national championship with an 89\u201376 win over Florida. Eighty-two percent of his players who completed their eligibility left MSU with a degree. Over the years, Izzo has been pursued by the Atlanta Hawks, Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers, and New Jersey Nets for head coaching jobs. After a brief flirtation with Cleveland, on June 15, 2010, Izzo reported to the Michigan State University's Board of Trustees that he would remain head coach of Michigan State, in which he stated he was \"a Spartan for life.\"\n\nIzzo fell short of obtaining his second national championship in 2009, losing to North Carolina 89\u201372. His streak of three straight Final Four appearances from 1999 to 2001 is the third-longest of all time, and his six Final Four appearances in the years 1999\u20132010 were matched by no other team in college basketball.\n\nIn 2013, Izzo was voted as the fifth angriest coach in college basketball by USA Today Sports, an honor that he cherishes.\n\nOn November 26, 2015, Izzo won his 500th career game, all with Michigan State, with a win over Boston College in the Wooden Legacy.

But before that, it was an honor he received as a player himself.\n\nIzzo played college basketball for Northern Michigan University from 1973-1977. He was a two-time team captain and earned NCAA Division II All-America honors.\n\nHe returned to his alma mater in 1979, serving as an assistant coach with the team until 1983.\n\nHis childhood best friend was former NFL coach Steve Mariucci\n\nTom Izzo met his best friend in high school.\n\nThat friend, who later became Izzo's college roommate, was Steve Mariucci, an NFL analyst and former NFL head coach.\n\nThe two men grew up in Iron Mountain, Michigan then went on together to become college athletes at Northern Michigan University.\n\nMariucci, who played quarterback for the football team, led the Wildcats to a Division II national championship. He went on to coach the San Francisco 49ers and the Detroit Lions.\n\nHe has the most NCAA Tournament wins in Big Ten history\n\nMarch is usually a good month for Tom Izzo.\n\nThe Spartans coach has more NCAA Tournament wins than any other coach in Big Ten Conference history.\n\nIt helps that under Izzo, MSU has made the tournament every single year since the 1997-98 season. That streak includes eight Final Four appearances and a national championship in 2000.\n\nHe once turned down a job with the Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nTom Izzo started as an assistant coach at MSU in 1983, and he's neft the school since.\n\nBut that almost changed in 2010 when Izzo was offered a job to become the head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nLeBron James was still with the Cavs then, but there was already major speculation about him leaving for another team.\n\nAs it turned out, both Izzo and James rejected Cleveland that summer. James signed a deal with the Miami Heat less than a month after Izzo turned down the job.\n\nRead more Michigan State basketball news:"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/tom-izzo", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nTom Izzo was born on 30 January, 1955 in Iron Mountain, Michigan, United States, is an American basketball coach and former player.
