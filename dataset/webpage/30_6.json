At that point the likes of Blackpool, Motherwell, Partick Thistle and St Mirren were vying for his signature, but the 19-year-old's mother was so impressed by the honest approach of the Aberdeen manager David Halliday that the boy heeded her advice to head north-east from his Lanarkshire home to enlist with the Dons.\n\nBaird, who had starred for Strathclyde Juniors alongside the future Rangers luminary Willie Waddell, was an intelligent fellow who nursed ambitions to be an architect, but his football skills had proved impossible to ignore and now he planned to train in the mornings and study for his future career in the afternoons. However, he made a slow start at Pittodrie, struggling for an impact in this new competitive environment, and he was still featuring for the reserves when war broke out in 1939.\n\nNow, all too soon, the youngster who had viewed joining the Dons as a great adventure was to find himself caught up in an expedition of an altogether more daunting nature, one on which failure surely must have carried fatal consequences.\n\nWhile serving in the medical corps for the ill-fated British Expeditionary Force, he missed the evacuation at Dunkirk but managed to board the last ship out of St Nazaire when France fell in summer 1940. Awaiting his return to the war, Baird was stationed at Headingley, Yorkshire's cricket headquarters, and while he was there he guested for Leeds United, facing top performers of the day such as the Everton trio Tommy Lawton, Joe Mercer and Cliff Britton.\n\nThe respite was brief, though, and he was dispatched to North Africa, where he was part of the force which confronted Rommel in the Western Desert. When Tobruk was taken in the summer of 1942, his field ambulance was surrounded by German tanks and he was captured and handed over to the Italians, who placed him in a prisoner-of-war camp near Rimini on the Adriatic coast.\n\nMany of his fellow detainees died in what he described later as \"a filthy hell-hole\" but Baird, who whiled away some of his time by day-dreaming about his life as a footballer, remained resilient and in 1943, after 18 months of incarceration, he and a comrade, Harold Smith, managed to escape. Knowing that the Allies had landed in Italy, and aiming to join them, the pair headed south into the lower reaches of the Appenines. They lived off the land, helped on their way by sympathetic Italian farmers, and when severe winter weather set in Baird was sheltered for some months by a compassionate family, the Pilottis, who found other safe billetts for Smith and another fugitive who had joined the pair on their trek towards freedom.\n\nWith his sharp and lively mind, Baird picked up Italian quickly, enabling him to pose convincingly as the son of his courageous benefactors, to whom he became devoted and with whom he embarked on a lifelong friendship. \"They were real heroes,\" he said years later. \"They looked after me despite knowing the Germans would have shot them if they had found out.\"\n\nEventually, as Hitler's forces pulled out of Italy, Baird rejoined the Allied ranks and returned to Britain, guesting as a footballer for Aldershot and non-League Falmouth before returning to Aberdeen following his demob in September 1945. Vastly matured by his recent experiences, he was now a far more confident character than the tentative youth he had been during his initial Pittodrie sojourn, and he became established rapidly in the Dons' first team.\n\nOperating as an incisive prompter alongside his close pal and fellow inside-forward George Hamilton and the diminutive spearhead Stan Williams, Baird proved hugely influential as Aberdeen won the Southern League Cup, an emergency wartime competition and the precursor to the soon-to-be-launched Scottish League Cup. They beat Rangers 3-2 in a see-sawing final in front of 135,000 fans at Hampden Park in May 1946 to claim the first big prize since the club's formation in 1903.\n\nThere was reward on a wider front, too, with an appearance for Scotland in the Victory international against Belgium that January, the game finishing 2-2. Because it was classed as an unofficial wartime encounter, no cap was awarded, and that proved to be his sole outing for his country. He was immensely unfortunate because he had excelled against the Belgians, keeping his feet deftly in thick snow on a foggy Hampden afternoon, and had been selected for the next fixture, against England, only to be forced out through injury.\n\nA season later Baird was prominent again as the Dons beat highly-fancied Hibernian 2-1 to win the Scottish Cup, thus securing their first senior trophy and emphasising the progress they had made in finishing third in that term's title race behind Rangers and Hibs. They reached the inaugural League Cup final, too, losing 4-0 to Rangers, and faced the future on a tide of optimism.\n\nBaird, with his clever passing, neat ball skill and happy knack of contributing important goals, was seen as a major plank of Halliday's entertaining side, but he was hampered cruelly by knee problems which demanded three operations, and also he suffered a fractured leg. His best extended run was in 1950-51, when he scored 10 times in 40 league and cup appearances, but after barely figuring in 1952-53, the 34-year-old \u2013 whose overall record of 37 goals in 144 games for Aberdeen would have been far more extensive had he been blessed with fitness on a consistent basis \u2013 accepted a transfer to second-tier St Johnstone.\n\nAt McDiarmid Park Baird enjoyed a fruitful Indian summer, moving back to wing-half and missing only a handful of matches as the Saints twice finished in upper mid-table, then narrowly missed promotion to the top flight in 1955-56, his last campaign.\n\nAfter leaving the game, Baird \u2013 who until his death was believed to be Aberdeen's oldest surviving player \u2013 embarked on a fulfilling and packed life as a sports writer for the Scottish Sunday Express and a PE teacher who rose to become assistant head of Hilton Academy in Aberdeen by the time he retired in 1979. Somehow he even chiselled out the necessary time from his crowded schedule to qualify as a glider pilot.\n\nBaird believed passionately in education, achieving degrees in English and Italian through the University of London by correspondence course in the 1960s then teaching his second language at evening class. A warm, gregarious and charming man who had come to love all things Italian, he moved to Italy for a year from 1980, along with his wife Nancy, to teach English there.\n\nHis attachment to journalism was equally deep \u2013 many of his family members were practitioners, including his brother-in-law Magnus Magnusson and Magnusson's daughter Sally \u2013 and he became a popular columnist on the Aberdeen-based monthly magazine Leopard.\n\nArchie Baird was an author, too, penning a moving autobiography, Family Of Four (1989). It was a book in which his love of football was abundantly evident, but which illustrated eloquently his appreciation of its rightful place when he came to consider the more profound values of life.\n\nIvan Ponting\n\nArchibald MacKechnie Baird, footballer, journalist and teacher; born Rutherglen, Lanarkshire 8 May 1919; played for Aberdeen 1938-53, St Johnstone 1953-56; marriedn (one son, one daughter); died Cove, Aberdeen 3 November 2009."}, {"url": "https://www.aberdeenlive.news/sport/aberdeen-footballer-born-day-who-7054265", "page_content": "Inside Forward Archie Baird was born in Rutherglen in 1919.\n\nHe began his playing career with Strathclyde Juniors, quickly catching the eyes of clubs both sides of the border.\n\nBlackpool, Motherwell, St Mirren and Partick Thistle were all fighting for the exciting 19-year-old's signature, however his mother was most impressed with Aberdeen.

He proved to be an inspirational centre half for the Dons, and part of the much-vaunted Allister, Young and Glen half back line that was the sound basis of the Dons success in the 50's. Renowned for his legendary sliding tackle, Young left the Dons in 1958, after a series of injuries had taken its toll. Died - Fortrose, 2nd March 2010 Alec Cheyne\n\nAlexander George Cheyne created his own piece of history when he scored for Scotland against England at Hampden in 1929. His goal, direct from a corner kick in the last minute was the catalyst that started the famous \"Hampden Roar.\" The Scotsman's match report tells us that, due to an injury to Jackson, Cheyne had to patrol his wing alone and that when he scored \"he had greatness thrust upon him\" by a trick of the wind. An Artisticly creative player with a crafty body swerve, he joined Aberdeen from Shettleston in 1925, he was transferred to Chelsea for a club record \u00a36,000 fee. Cheyne also became one of the first Scot to play abroad when he went to France and joined Nimes. He later returned to Chelsea before becoming Chelmsford City coach (1936-1939) and then managed Arbroath from May 1949 til May 1955. Preston North End representatives were at Hampden on Saturday. Were they watching Cheyne? If so, they need not knock at the Pittodrie \"gate,\" as he is not \"for sale.\" Source: Bon-Accord, 28th December 1928 CHEYNE GOES. Dons Internationalist For Chelsea. FEE NOT DIVULGED. Alec Cheyne, the Aberdeen Football Club's Scottish international inside-right was last night transferred to Chelsea. For some time the future of this clever player has been the subject of much speculation, and now all doubts have been put at rest. Cheyne was offered the maximum terms the Aberdeen club is giving its best-paid players, but he refused to accept. Every effort was made to retain him, but the player's mind was firmly made up for a change.

Signed from Dundee in 1904, became a regular right half in the Dons side and was a firm favourite for the \"Black & Golds\". Elevated to club captain in 1907, Halkett was never capped for his country and scored two goals during his five seasons at Pittodrie. \"Alexander Halkett, right-half, is one of the neatest players who ever kicked a ball. He comes of a well-known Dundee family of footballers, and fully keeps up the reputation of it.

Many will regret this players departure, and his finished half-back play will be a distinct loss to the Pittodrie club. Halkett commenced playing for Aberdeen when the club was admitted to the Second Division of the league, there was thus the oldest playing member in the club. He was the sole remaining player of the team which won the Qualifying Cup in 1904-5. Source: Aberdeen Daily Journal, 12th May 1909 Whilst initially it was reported that he was to sign for Portsmouth, the player himself contacted the Dundee Evening Times informing them that this was incorrect. Surprisingly Ecky struggled to find a club during the following months and the 1909-10 season kicked without his name on any team sheet. There was mention of a move to Reading in October 1909, but nothing seems to have come of it. In November 1909 he was to be found training with Dundee Hibs and a prospective move to Bolton Wanderers the following month seems to have failed due to Aberdeen?s requested transfer fee. It would not be until November 1910 that Ecky would again take to the football field when he signed for Forfar Athletic. In August 1911 he would sign for St Johnstone and recapture some of his old form but after two seasons with the Perth club he departed for Breadalbane where he would play one more season before retiring. Mrs. Halkett, Spey Street, Kingussie, received official intimation last week that her husband, Gunner Alexander Halkett, Royal Field Artillery, has fallen in action.

Represented Scotland in wartime internationals, Archie Baird joined St Johnstone at the end of the 1952-53 season. Another link with this football club's past was lost forever on the 4th November 2009, with the sad news that former player and Aberdeen legend, Archie Baird, has passed away. However his memory will always live on at Aberdeen Football Club. Whenever the Scottish Cup comes around, talk will be of the side that carried off the crown in 1947, for the very first time, and Archie Baird's role in it. That will never die. Archie Baird Interview taken from Red Matchday earlier this year Being the oldest known living former Don was not a burden that would have worried Archie Baird; after all he has been through some incredible experiences in what has been a memorable playing career and personal life. Archie had celebrated his 90th birthday on the 8th May and was the only surviving Don from the team that won the Dons first Scottish Cup in 1947. Born in Rutherglen, Archie joined Aberdeen as a youngster of great promise in the summer of 1938. Aberdeen offered Archie a two-year contract which was unusual back then for any young player to be rewarded with more than a year's contract. \"I had offers from Blackpool, Motherwell, St Mirren, Partick and others but my mother influenced my final decision due to the fact that Aberdeen manager Dave Halliday had good, honest eyes that were what clinched my move to Aberdeen. I had always admired the Dons and their style and moving to Aberdeen was a clean break. It all happened so quickly; six months after starting as a Junior I was away to Aberdeen and earning \u00a34 per week with a \u00a320 signing on fee. I set out on my great adventure in July 1938 leaving Buchanan Street station in Glasgow in the company of someone called Willie Waddell but not my right wing buddie from Strathclyde. By a strange coincidence there was another young player of that name with Renfrew and he too had just signed for Aberdeen. Willie was a fine player and we grew to become close friends for many years.\" Archie soon began to realise what being at a football club like Aberdeen was all about as he started out in the reserves. \"We got a taste of full-time training the month before the start of the season. Donald Colman was the trainer at that time; a quiet-spoken intelligent man. He made an immediate impression on me. When he entered the dressing room you could sense he had the respect of the hard-bitten pros. Donald was detailed in everything he did and that rubbed off on the players. He would advise players on their fitness and diet and the importance of living healthy. He was ahead of his time. He also got the best out of players and that was his real strength. Matt Armstrong was struggling to make it at Celtic but Colman transformed him at Pittodrie and he went on to become one of the best forwards ever to play for the Dons. I soon began to realise that I would turn to Donald for guidance as my form began to suffer and I lost confidence. I saw my friend Willie Waddell promoted to the first team and I was delighted for him but things were not going well for me and I was struggling to make an impact.\" It was at that point that events in Europe were soon to have an impact on the whole country as Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939. All football was immediately stopped as every attention turned to the war effort. Events during those difficult times would have a huge bearing on Archie. \"It all happened so quickly. Here I was in Aberdeen and trying to make my way as a professional player and also training to be an architect. A couple of months later I was conscripted and was very soon in France as a member of a medical corps unit with the ill-fated British Expeditionary Force. I missed the evacuation of Dunkirk, and only managed to leave France on the last ship out of St Nazaire. That was in the summer of 1940. By Christmas I was in the Western Desert, and by May 1942 had been captured by the Germans near Tobruk and handed over to the Italians. It was at El Adem when our field ambulance attached to the infantry unit had been surrounded by a squadron of German tanks. We ended up in a camp near Tripoli, called Suani Ben Adem. It was a filthy hell-hole, a huge rectangular strip of oasis surrounded by a wire fence and sentry towers. Prisoners were unable to do anything and many died there. What an eternity those four years seemed and how different from my teenage dreams; my twenty-first birthday spent in a tent 'somewhere in France'; my football confined to games for the unit team, a kick about with the lads and the occasional improvised training session. Since the war broke out I had played only two first class games, both with Leeds United as a guest player while I was stationed at Headingly Cricket Ground awaiting transfer to Egypt. Lying there under the clear Italian sky, I relived the excitement of playing against the pre-war Everton stars; Jones, Britton, Mercer and the great Tommy Lawton. But not even the good memory of scoring a goal for Leeds that day could make me forget the seriousness of my situation.\" Archie spent much of his time during the hostilities as a POW in Italy but it was his story of what happened after his escape that was truly a tale of human courage and compassion. After eighteen months as a captive, Archie and his close friend Harold 'Smudger' Smith escaped to the foothills of the Appenines, free, but still in enemy-occupied territory. They headed south after news of an Allied landing on the Italian coast suggested that would have been their best route. However the journey was an arduous one with German patrols prominent. Their route to safety was achieved by living off the land and the generosity of sympathetic Italian farmers and peasants they met along the way. \"We had encountered many dangers along the way but the local Italian people were humble, generous people.\" It was on that long trek to freedom that Archie came across an Italian family that would go to 'adopt' him as one of their own for several months as the harsh winter set in. The Pilotti family were Italian farmers who looked after Archie as his good friend Harold and Tom who had joined them along the way, found similar families nearby to home the escapees. Archie made life-long friendships during those days and daily news of Allied advances helped raise spirits. Archie also by his association with his new friends managed to speak the language in time. As the German occupation waned by the day and news of the Allied efforts in Italy were successful. \"As we made our way to eventual freedom we could hear gunfire in the distance. The Germans were retreating north and their convoy was an easy target for our fighters and bombers. The activity in the air was increasing as we made our way north. We eventually arrived in a village called Sarnano where it was soon to become Allied occupied territory, my feelings were mixed as the Italian people did not really understand what was happening as the Union flag was raised in their town. \"I came back a completely different person. I went away as a raw young laddie and came back after experiencing a lot, I had more confidence in myself and as far as football was concerned I was thrust straight into the Aberdeen first team so it just developed from there. On my return to Falmouth I had started playing for my unit team and for Aldershot. By early 1945 I was stationed at Edinburgh Castle and playing for Aberdeen when I could get leave arranged. The Scottish Command then selected me for a tour of Orkney Islands and I met up with some players I would face in the coming months. However the most important day for me was stepping out at Pittodrie to face Hearts for the first time in seven years and I was at last, making my first team debut. The war ended in May 1945 and I was demobbed in September.\" It was in January 1946 that Archie gained his one Scotland cap when he played against Belgium at Hampden. \"That game should never have been played as the ground was covered in snow. The game ended in a 2-2 draw but the thick fog made conditions all the more difficult. Jimmy Delaney and Gordon Smith were alongside me in that side. It was not an ideal international to play in but the Victory International against England was something else. It was the last wartime international and was seen as a celebration of the end of hostilities. I was delighted to be selected for the Scotland team. I would be facing some famous names like Frank Swift, Len Shackleton and Billy Wright. The Saturday before the international we were playing Partick at Firhill. I went down in a tackle with Jacky husband and I knew at once that I was seriously injured. On the Monday I had to call off from the Scotland team as the injury worsened. It was a sad day for me although my team mate George Hamilton took my place.\" The highlights of Archie's Pittodrie career came in the Dons Southern League Cup win in May 1946 and the Scottish Cup a year later. \"I had a month to recover from that injury to make it for the final against Rangers. We prepared in Largs for three days before the game and we also had to contend with the butt of all jokes as Aberdeen had never won a national trophy at that time. The game was a real highlight for me personally as I scored a goal in the opening minute. Andy Cowie sent in a long throw and George (Hamilton) flicked the ball on with his head. I managed to leap past George Young to score. When Stan Williams scored just before half time, the big Aberdeen contingent was convinced we had done enough. Rangers back though and the game was tied at 2-2 as we moved into the final minutes. In the last seconds George Taylor popped up with a sensational winner and the cup was ours. \"A year later we took the Scottish Cup as well after beating Hibernian. There was a huge Aberdeen following that day as supporters came from all over, as far away as Orkney and Shetland; a true north east invasion. It was an amazing experience and after we lost a goal in the opening minute we came back to win with Stan Williams scoring the winner. I took up a position at the near post as Stan cut in from the bye-line. I was shouting at Stan to cut the ball back, but he flicked the ball in at the near post for a great goal. Stan later admitted to me that he heard my shout but he noticed Hibernian keeper Kerr move off his line in anticipation.\" Looking back at his playing career, one player stood out from the rest as far as Archie was concerned; \"George Hamilton was the best player to play for the club. George was the complete player and it was a privilege to play alongside him. It was all so different in those days, there wasn't a great deal of influence from the manager regarding tactics or coaching. Any success we had was usually down to us playing off the cuff as it were.\" After finishing his career in 1956 after three seasons with St Johnstone, Archie immediately began working for the Scottish Daily Express as a north east beat reporter. Despite offers to go full time as a journalist, Archie continued with his career as a PE teacher, a profession he had taken up during his time at Pittodrie. \"You have got to look at the whole picture and I count myself lucky to have survived the war. That was the big thing. To have been able to come back and play football again was a great thrill. To be honest I have never looked upon myself as being unlucky during the war and I don't have any regrets.\" Archie Baird - Aberdeen Record Season Apps Goals 1946-47 19 7 1947-48 22 7 1948-49 7 1 1949-50 23 6 1950-51 40 10 1951-52 27 6 1952-53 6 0 Total 144 37 Archie Glen\n\nSigned from Annbank United in 1947, Glen went down in the history of Aberdeen as the player who scored the vital goal that clinched the Dons first championship in 1955. His penalty against Clyde at Shawfield sparked wild celebrations in Aberdeen, as the Dons were proud Champions. Converted into an elegant wing-half, Glen was capped for Scotland and also represented the Scottish League on six occasions. After leaving the Army, Archie, who was a science graduate of Aberdeen University, had made the left half position his own and was made club captain in 1956. Throughout his career he maintained a very high standard of performance and was an excellent tackler. Retired in 1960. Died - Aberdeen, 30th August 1998 Arthur Graham\n\n\"Bumper\" as he was affectionately known by the Dons faithful shot to fame almost immediately with the Dons. Following his move from Cambuslang juniors in 1970, Graham played in the Dons side that won the Scottish Cup in 1970, six weeks after making his first team debut. The rookie 17-year-old winger played his part, and went on to become a firm favourite at Pittodrie. Capped at U-23 level while at the Dons, Graham went on to earn 10 caps for Scotland after his suspension from Scotland after the Copenhagen affair in 1975. Transferred to Leeds United in 1977 for \u00a3125,000. Benny Yorston\n\nFull Name: Benjamin Collard Yorston. Record Aberdeen goal scorer when he notched an incredible 46 goals from 42 appearances in season 1929/30. The diminutive Yorston was a prolific marksman that also saw service with Mugiemoss, Montrose, Sunderland and Middlesborough. Scored impressive 126 goals for the Dons in only 156 starts, again, the best goal ratio return by any Aberdeen player. Was part of the Dons \"Great Mystery\" that curtailed his Aberdeen career, and was moved on to Sunderland in a \u00a32,000 deal in 1932. Moved on to Middlesbrough for \u00a31,250 in March 1934. Guested for several clubs during World War II but the war effectively finished his career. Passed away in London in 1977 YORSTON GOES TO SUNDERLAND. Transfer Fee Said to be \u00a32000. TO MAKE DEBUT ON WEDNESDAY. Yesterday Benny Yorston, Aberdeen's international centre-forward, was transferred to Sunderland, for whom he will make his debut on Wednesday against Arsenal. Negotiations opened on Tuesday, when Sunderland offered \u00a3500 for his transfer. This was turned down by Aberdeen, and subsequently the English club increased their offer to \u00a31500, which met a similar fate. Yesterday the clubs were again touch, and the outcome they agreed, with the player's acquiescence, that Yorston be transferred to Sunderland for a sum understood to be \u00a32000. Of this, the player will receive the maximum share allowable, he not having received a benefit, of \u00a3650, and his new club has agreed to find him quarters, and remove his household goods to Sunderland. Yesterday evening Yorston met the managers of the two clubs in the North British Hotel, Edinburgh, where the agreement was ratified. Versatile Player. Yorston will be twenty-five in October. He is 5 feet 3 inches height, but his stature never appears to prove a defect, and he uses his 10 stone 4 lb. to advantage. He times a high ball with remarkable accuracy and gets a tremendous height. This has been proved time and again when he has headed goals while opposed to the tallest centre-halfs in Scottish football. Two-footed, and remarkably quick, he is one of the coolest-headed forwards seen in the game for some time. He can play anywhere in the forward line. As a juvenile and junior, first with Sunnyside and later with Aberdeen Mugiemoss and Richmond, he most frequently figured at inside-left, which is probably his best position. Triple International. He was secured by Aberdeen from Montrose five seasons ago with a view to filling the outside-left position, and it was only when team exigencies forced the situation that he was given a run in the first team at centre-forward. His ability was readily appreciated, and he became a permanency in the League team. Two years ago he was top scorer for the season in the Scottish League First Division with 38 goals, an average of a goal per match. He is a schoolboy internationalist, junior internationalist, and senior internationalist, having played respectively against England, Ireland, and Wales, and two years ago was travelling reserve against France. It is considered he will suit English football, where his quick darts to right and left and down the centre, allied to his distribution and ability to create openings, will get full scope, especially alongside such partners as Bedford and Leonard.

Bert MacLachlan\n\nBert MacLachlan's Pittodrie career was interrupted by the First World War in 1916 after he had joined the Dons from Aston Villa two years previously. A strong left half who was made captain in 1919, MacLachlan was a colossus in the Aberdeen side and after representing the Scottish League, he moved to Hearts in 1927. His one appearance in season 1916-1917 was whilst he was on furlough from the Forces where he served as a gunner. IN season 1926-27 he suffered a serious groin injury which led to him missing the last few games of the season and ultimately he was released as it was thought he might not recover. However, at the beginning of the following season he was back training at Pittodrie and it was though he would re-join the club but in early September 1927 he signed for Hearts, Older Brother of Fred. Another Brother (John) played for Partick Thistle, Dundee and Aston Villa. Full name: Albert James MacLachlan Died - Edinburgh Billy Dodds\n\nDodds became the Dons record buy in 1994 when Willie Miller paid St Johnstone \u00a3800,000 for his services. Was top score with the Dons in each of his four years at Pittodrie. It was Dodd's vital goals in May 1995 that helped Aberdeen survive relegation for the first time. Sold to Dundee United, much to the chagrin of Aberdeen's supporters, by Alex Miller as part of the Robbie winters deal and subsequently moved to Rangers in 2000 before winding down his playing career with a return to Dundee United and finally (briefly) Partick Thistle. After retiring from playing Billy moved into football management and punditry with the BBC. Billy Stark\n\nSigned as a long term replacement for Gordon Strachan, Alex Ferguson once again plundered St Mirren and paid the Paisley club \u00a3100,000 for his services. An effective wide midfield player, Stark was a prolific goal taker, and with his natural ability these qualities made Stark a valuable asset at Pittodrie, which was never fully appreciated in some quarters. Joined Celtic after leaving Pittodrie. Bill Strauss\n\nSouth African Strauss was a dashing left-winger who was spotted by the Dons shortly after his arrival to Britain. Played a major part in the Dons run to the Scottish Cup Final in 1937, and was injured in the semi-final, which meant he missed out on the big day. It was a popular belief that if Strauss were in the Dons 1937 Cup Final line up the Dons would have won. During the War, Bily reached the rank of Lieutenant in the Army. Transferred from Aberdeen to Plymouth Argyle in early 1946. He also played Minor Counties cricket for Devon in the early 1950's. Full name: William Henry Strauss. Died - Plymouth, 16th November 1984 Bob Fraser\n\nElevation to the first team was rapid for Fraser after his switch from Albion Rovers in 1931. Following the demise of several Dons regulars in the \"Great Mystery\" of 1931, Fraser soon began to establish himself in the Dons first team. Became Aberdeen skipper in 1934, and his leadership qualities were in evidence when the Dons reached their first Scottish Cup Final in 1937. Fraser was to miss out on the big day due to an injury. In 1938, he emmigrated to South Africa. in April 1985 Bob died as the result of injuries sustained in a road crash in South Africa. Bob McDermid\n\nFormer Aberdeen skipper McDermid joined the Dons from Queen of the South in 1925, and became a useful inside forward during his Pittodrie career. Enjoyed a lengthy association at Aberdeen after playing previously for Rangers, and he went on to assist Donald Colman as trainer, and progressed to that position in his own right a position he held until 1952, when ill health forced the loyal McDermid to retire from the game. Died - Largs, 19th August 1952 Bob Wishart\n\nMR DAVID HALLIDAY, the Aberdeen F.C. manager, today signed 18-year-old Robert Wishart, outside left of Merchiston Thistle, the Edinburgh juvenile club. Wishart, who is 5ft. 8in. in height and well built, played a trial for the Pittodrie reserves at Brechin last night and put up a good display. He had previously played trials for English clubs and had been offered good terms, but preferred to remain in Scotland. Wishart, who was at Pittodrie to-day, will take up residence in Aberdeen. It will be recalled that the Dons already have an interest in Newlands, an outside right from Merchiston Thistle, who is in the R.A.F. at Kinloss. Source: Evening Express, 30th August 1951 Bob developed in to an inside forward who was a vital part of the Dons 1955 side. Wishart linked up well with Yorston and Buckley as the Dons found a potent blend in the 50's. Capped at U-23 and League level, Wishart moved to Dundee in 1961, where he won a championship medal in 1962. Bob spent his retirement in Edinburgh where he passed away on the 3rd of December 2020. Bobby Clark\n\nOne of the first signings made by Eddie Turnbull, Bobby Clark went on to carve out a memorable Aberdeen career. Clark created a British club record in 1971 when he went 13 consecutive games without conceding a goal. Bobby also made a couple of appearances in the outfield, the first when he replaced Jim Forrest at Ibrox for the last 15 minutes of the game, and a week later he started at Pittodrie against St Johnstone. Clark also kept goal for Scotland a record 17 times while at Aberdeen, his record being broken by Willie Miller in 1982. Won a full set of domestic medals in 1970, 1976 and 1980. Bobby was still at Pittodrie in season 1981-1982 but did not play due to injury and in March 82 he went into hospital to have a disc removed from his back. Briefly joined Clyde in 1982 before embarking on a coaching career overseas starting with Highlanders of Bulawayo, in Zimbabwe, folowed by Dartmouth College in New England and then New Zealand before settling back in the USA with first Stanford University and in 2001 Notre Dame, Indiana. Robert Hannah\n\nTook time to establish himself in the Dons first team after joining the club from East End in 1908. When he broke through, he was asked to play at left-back although he was essentially a right-back - he was unable to dispossess the ever-reliable Donald Colman, but did manage to bypass Jock Hume in the team. Following his stint with the Army in World War One, Hannah resumed his Aberdeen career in 1919, making 126 appearances for the Dons before moving to Peterhead as player/coach in 1921. Eventually moved to the USA where he remained involved in football. The Dons full back scored one goal for the Dons, a penalty against Partick at Pittodrie in 1912. Brian Grant\n\nAn Alex Ferguson signing from Stirling Albion, the promising midfielder had to be patient before making the breakthrough in to the Dons first team. When former Stirling boss Alec Smith took over at Pittodrie, Grant established himself as a regular in the Dons team, and was part of the double Cup winning side in 1989-90. His loyalty was rewarded with a testimonial against Everton at Pittodrie in 1996. Was sold to Hibernian for \u00a375,000 in 1997. After his playing days had ended, Brian took on the MacDonalds franchies at Forfar for several years, whilst continuing in football as a coach with Dundee United. Brian Irvine\n\nSigned from Falkirk as a promising central defender by Alex Ferguson in 1985, and in his early days played a supporting role to McLeish and Miller in the Dons team. After making the breakthrough, Irvine on to become a firm favourite with the Aberdeen support. A self confessed Aberdeen fan who wore his heart on his sleeve, scored the decisive penalty that won the 1990 Scottish Cup for the Dons. Released in 1997 after receiving a testimonial against Wimbledon. One of the abiding memories for Dons' fans was that Brian played in goal on more than one occasion, even saving a penalty at Easter Road. Retired from playing after a spell with Ross County. Charlie Cooke\n\nA shining light at Pittodrie in the bleak days of the early 60's. Charlie Cooke emerged as a player of rare talent and a clever ball juggler, going straight from school to full time football and straight into the first team. He earned himself a great reputation as an entertaining footballer with immaculate footwork and defence splitting passes, that endeared him to the fans of all the clubs that he played for. One of an impressively long line of Bobby Calder discoveries Cooke was honoured at U-23 level while at Pittodrie before a record Scottish transfer of \u00a344,000 took him to Dundee. Went on to play for Chelsea and Crystal Palace in England and played out his onfield career in American football as a player/coach. An original winner of a European Cup Winners Cup medal winner, an honour he gained whilst playing at Stamford Bridge. After he stopped playing, Charlie went on to run the Coerver Soccer School in Cincinnati, Ohio. Charlie McGill\n\nMcGill arrived at Pittodrie in 1931 after a spell in the States. \"Oor Ba\" McGill soon became a big favourite at Pittodrie and after an extended spell at left-back, McGill was honoured by the Scottish League. Kilmarnock born McGill was unfortunate to miss out on the Dons big day at Hampden in 1937 before joining Glentoran in 1938. In November 1943 is was reported that Charlie would represent Hall & Co. on the Aberdeenshire Junior Association. Later returned to the USA where he lived till he passed away in Fall River, Massachusetts, in 1988. Charlie Nicholas\n\nIf ever there was a stellar signing, this was it. Ian Porterfield signed Nicholas from Arsenal for \u00a3400,000 in the New Year of 1988, and immediately lifted the Dons' flagging spirits. In his Pittodrie debut against Dunfermline, 20,000 turned out to see the former Celtic star. A gifted striker, Nicholas was already a Scottish international by the time he arrived at Pittodrie, and went on to become a favourite at Pittodrie. Played in the side that won the Cup double in 1989-90, and began to form an exciting partnership with Hans Gillhaus that was touted, as the most feared in the game. Moved back to his first club Celtic after the Dons had beaten the Parkhead side in the 1990 Cup Final. After hanging up his boots, Charlie went on to be a successful football pundit on television. Charles O'Hagan\n\nArrived from Middlesborough in 1906, Irish international O'Hagan was an ideal partner for Dons winger Willie Lennie. A skilful inside forward the Irishman weighed in with 24 goals for the Dons in over 100 appearances for the club. O'Hagan was the first Aberdeen player to be capped for his country, before moving to Morton in 1910 for a fee of \u00a3185 - a figure set by the SFL after an appeal by the player. He then had a brief spell with Third Lanark in 1912/13. O'Hagan served in France with the Highland Light Infantry during the Great War and was fortunate to survive. On his return he was appointed manager of Norwich City for their debut season in the Football League in 1920/21. He resigned after the Canaries registered just four wins in their first 22 League games. Two years later he emerged as manager of Sevilla in Spain where he stayed for a season. He then became a journalist and sailed to New York from Londonderry on the 20th November 1928. He died there less than three years later. In October 1908, Charles O'Hagan began contributing a series to Bon-Accord entitled \"My Football Reminiscences\" entirely penned by himself. The series ran over 12 weekly issues. Bon-Accord were rightly proud of the series and at one point printed this promotional \"story\": Got What He Wanted Charlie one evening was making his way up to \"Bon-Accord\" office. At Windmill Brae a man suddenly sprang on our friend. 'Your money or your life! said he hoarsely. Was Charlie dismayed? No, not he. He just took a copy of a paper from his pocket and handed it to the robber, saying simply, 'This is an advance copy of \"Bon-Accord.\" You'll find my life in it.' Bon-Accord, 29th October 1908 Chris Anderson\n\nSigned from Mugiemoss in 1944 and went on to become a first team regular at Pittodrie. After being given a free transfer in 1953, Chris joined Arbroath where he played League games before going on to be assistant manager and then chief coach. He steered Arbroath to promotion in season 1958-1959. Later returned to Pittodrie as a director on 5th October 1967, and went on to play a major role in the Dons rise to European stardom in the 80's. Chris Anderson was still on the Aberdeen board until his untimely death in May 1986. David Main\n\nArrived at Pittodrie in 1911 from Falkirk as an out and out striker. Never the most agile, Main proved to be a prolific scorer for the Dons during his six seasons at Aberdeen. With 58 goals from his 158 appearances, Main was the Dons top scorer in his first three seasons. Previously with Sunderland where he played only two first team matches, Main played for the Dons until the ongoing hostilities forced the Dons to cease competitive football in 1917. Died - Falkirk, 23rd June 1961 Dave Robb\n\nFull name: David Thomson Robb. Affectionately known as the \"Brush\" by the Dons support, Robb became a cult figure at Pittodrie with his unlimited enthusiasm and combative style. Although never blessed with an abundance of ability, Robb was an effective forward for the Dons and a prolific goal scorer. Played for Scotland on five occasions, all his caps coming in 1971, including a Wembley appearance against England. Scored the Dons winning goal in the 1976 League Cup Final and also played in the 1970 Final. Later played with Norwich and in the USA for Tampa Bay Rowdies amongst others. David Robertson\n\nEmerged through the ranks at Pittodrie to solve the long-standing left back problem at Pittodrie. First made his presence in the same side as McLeish and Miller in 1987 before making the left back position his own. Nicknamed Beano by the Fanzine, The Northern Light. Was the subject of a transfer to bitter rivals rangers in 1991 after the Dons had lost the title to the Ibrox club. A tribunal set the fee at \u00a3970,000. After tasting success at Ibrox, Robertson moved to Leeds Utd. Injury forced a premature retirement from playing and a move into coaching, including spells of management at Elgin City and Montrose. Following this he took up coaching in the USA at Phoenix FC and in 2017 moved to Real Kashmir in India where he became the subject of much interest and featured in a BBC documentary programme in 2021 about his adventures with his club. In the 1921/22 New Year's Honours, David was awarded a British Empire Medal in recognition of his services to the community in Kashmir and in helping to foster good relations between India and the UK. Derek McKay\n\nFondly known as \"Cup-tie\" McKay after his remarkable rise to fame in the Dons memorable Scottish Cup win in 1970. McKay was signed on a free transfer from Dundee in 1969, and it was not until a flu virus decimated the Dons team before a quarter final tie at Falkirk that McKay was given his opportunity. McKay scored the only goals in both the Falkirk game and the semi final against Kilmarnock. Two goals in the Final against Celtic helped the Dons to an unlikely 3-1 win, so giving McKay notoriety in Pittodrie folklore. Released on a free in 1971. Died: Pattaya, Thailand, 20th April 2008 Don Emery\n\nFull name: Donald Kenneth James Emery. Arrived at Pittodrie from Swindon in part exchange for Andy Cowie. Was renowned for a venomous shot and a fearsome penalty kick expert. Emery was a colossal figure and was a real favourite at Pittodrie. Sometimes used as an emergency centre forward, Welsh born Emery joined East Fife and also returned to Pittodrie in 1969 in an attempt to unseat the Pittodrie board along with Tony Harris and others. Died - 19th November 1993. Donald Colman\n\n\"No player ever associated with the Pittodrie Club ever enjoyed greater popularity nor carried the confidence of the public more than Colman.\" Aberdeen Daily Journal, 26th March 1921 Real name: Donald Cameron Cunningham. He changed his surname to Colman to help hide from his family the fact that he was playing football. A native of Renton, Colman was recommended by former Maryhill teammate Jimmy Muir to Jimmy Philip and, after an initial month's trial, joined the Dons permanently in October 1907 and went on to become an Aberdeen legend. A tough full back, with gentlemanly qualities, he was the most consistent player Aberdeen had had to that time. it was Colman at the age of 33, became the oldest Aberdeen player to be capped for Scotland. During August 1916, Donald joined the Gordon Highlanders, having previously carried out his war work in an engineering establishment in the Vale of Leven./br> As the Dons worked to rebuild after the end of the war, he was transferred to St Mirren at the beginning of March 1919 in time to assist them in the Victory Cup time replay at Dumbarton, but after only one game and one month he moved to Renton in April 1919 and allegedly St Mirren then Dumbarton FC after that, but he was back at Pittodrie for season 1919/1920. In September 1920 Donald did finally join Dumbarton as Player/Manager, a post he kept till 1925. Returned to the club as club trainer in 1931 after a spell coaching in Norway, and amongst many contributions he helped to harness the talents of Mills and Armstrong. Colman was also the driving force at Pittodrie behind the first ever dugout to be built in Britain, the idea having been inspired by the huts used by football coaches in Norway when they sheltered from the weather during games. That first dugout was built prior to the beginning of season 1934-1935 and was just one of many ideas that Colman tried in his quest to improve the Dons. From feeding the players raw eggs and sherry before games to getting them free passes for the Beach Ballroom to help them develop their footwork, Donald left no stone unturned. Doug Bell\n\nSigned on a free from St Mirren by Alex Ferguson in 1979, Bell went on to become a vital part of the Aberdeen success in Europe. His direct running and natural ability were well suited on the European stage. Often kept by Alex Ferguson for the big occasion, was injured before the 1983 ECWC Final. Transferred to Rangers in 1985 for \u00a3160,000. Doug Rougvie\n\nJoined the Dons as a youngster in 1972, the big defender went on to establish himself in the Dons side of the late 70's and also the all-conquering Dons of the 80's. Another cult hero at the club, Rougvie was a fearless competitor, and often found himself incurring the wrath of referees and opposing fans alike. Made over 300 appearances for the Dons (including friendlies) and scored 21 goals before a \u00a3225,000 switch to Chelsea in 1984. One cap for Scotland, against Ireland in 1983. His teammates nicknamed him the \"Balingry Bat.\" Drew Jarvie\n\nA record Dons signing from Airdrie in 1972, for a fee of around \u00a370,000. Settled in to a profitable striking partnership with Joe Harper, and remained the club's top striker following Harper's departure.

Played 386 competetive games for the Dons, scoring 130 goals. Remained in the game after his retirement, in coaching and management,including a successful spell in a management team with Alex Smith and Jocky Scott at Pittodrie which won two Cups in 1990 and came close to winning the League in 1990-1991. Drew left the club in 2002 after the resignation of Ebbie Skovdahl. Duncan Shearer\n\nFull name: Duncan Nichol Shearer. A prolific marksman, signed by Willie Miller for \u00a3500,000 from Blackburn in 1992. The highlander scored twice on his Pittodrie debut, and went on to strike fear in many a Scottish defence. Scored 87 goals in his five seasons at Pittodrie, including the Dons second in the 1995 League Cup Final. Fulfilled a boyhood dream when he played for Scotland in 1994, and also scored against Finland to set the Scots on their way to Euro 96. Moved on by Roy Aitken in 1997 to Inverness CT where he teamed up in a coaching role with Steve Paterson. Was back at Pittodrie as assistant to Paterson after the departure of Ebbe Skovdahl. Later manager of Highland League outfit Buckie Thistle and then joined Inverness Caledonian Thistle as a development coach. Eddie Falloon\n\nIrish born Falloon was perhaps one of the smallest central defenders ever in the Dons history. For what he lacked in height was compensated for with a fierce commitment and desire. Falloon was the Aberdeen captain in the 1937 Cup Final against Celtic and he also went on to gain full international honours for Ireland. In 1938 he was sold to Clyde. Died: Larne, 4th July 1963 Eoin Jess\n\nEmerged from the successful Dons Youth side of the late 80's and shot to fame when he played in the 1989 League Cup Final, helping the Dons to beat Rangers as a raw 19-year-old. Still a hot favourite at Pittodrie, Jess tried his luck in the English Premiership with Coventry, before returning to Aberden in a \u00a3650,000 move in 1997.

Was particularly renowned for his ability to \"hang in the air\" when going for high balls. Signed a deal to move to Metz in France which led to his being left out of the Dons 1986 Cup Final side. Back injuries hampered Black's career after leaving the Dons and he was forced to give up playing professionally in his late twenties. Highly regarded as a coach, he was manager at Motherwell and Coventry City as well as being assistant at several other clubs. Frank Dunlop\n\nWill go down in Aberdeen history as the first Dons captain to lead the club to success in the Southern League Cup in 1946 and the Scottish Cup a year later. Signed from Benburb in 1936 he developed in to a tough defender with great leadership qualities. Was also in the Aberdeen side that played in the 1937 Final. During the Second World War, Frank served full-time in the ARP, but was able to resume his playing career in time for the cup successes of the 40's. Left Pittodrie in 1948 and emigrated to South Africa. A few years later, Frank returned to Aberdeen where he worked for Claude Hamilton Electrical, a firm that did a lot of work at Pittodrie for many years. Frank passed away in Aberdeen, 1991. A number of his career medals are held in The Aberdeen Collection Frank McDougall\n\nBut for a troublesome back injury, McDougall looked as if he was on course to challenge Joe Harper as the goal king of Pittodrie. Although Frank only played two seasons for the Dons, such was his prowess in front of goal, he scored 44 goals. Was part of the Dons 1985 League Championship side, having signed in 1984 for a \u00a3100,000 fee from St Mirren as a replacement for Mark McGhee.

Following the end of his fourteen year playing career, Fred worked in the whisky trade before retiring to the Perth area. Full Name: Fred George Martin Died - Perth, 20th August 2013 George Hamilton\n\nHamilton was a record Dons signing when he was transferred to Pittodrie from Queen of the South for \u00a33,000 in 1938. Made an immediate impact in the Dons side that was to break up for the Second World War. During the years of conflict George did manage to make some appearances for the Pittodire outfit. Whilst still serving in the Army and awaiting demob, George submitted a transfer request, but happily he withdrew it in time to play against Queen's Park on 25th December 1945. On resumption of his Aberdeen career after the hostilities had ceased, \"Gentleman George\" helped the Dons to their first major trophy success with the 1946 League Cup and the Scottish Cup in 1947. Hamilton was a top class forward with superb heading ability, and also represented Scotland, gaining 5 caps. Scored a hat trick against Belgium in 1951. Whilst he was still playing, George also ran a Newsagent's shop in Aberdeen. Retired in 1955 after a short spell with Hamilton.

George Mulhall\n\nFalkirk born George Mulhall passed away in April 2018 at the age of 81. He had signed for the Dons from Kilsyth Rangers in 1953, but had to be patient before breaking into the first team as he was understudy to the speedy Jack Hather. He played a starring role in the reserve team that won a Reserve League and Second Eleven Cup double in season 1954-1955. It was not until after the Dons had won the championship in 1955 that Mulhall made his mark, and he developed into a quick left winger who scored more than his fair share of goals. Capped for Scotland in 1959, Mulhall, having played 150 first team games during which he scored 42 goals, was tempted south in September 1962, when he joined Sunderland for \u00a322,000. Following a spell in South Africa, George returned to Britain to take on various coaching roles, and he made a successful return to the English League managing Halifax Town, Bradford City and Bolton Wanderers then Halifax Town again.

Played almost 250 games for the Dons. His Aberdeen career was effectively finished by the outbreak of War in 1939 although he did make a number of wartime appearances for Aberdeen even though he was a full-time member of the ARP, particularly in season 1943-44. Gordon Strachan\n\nFull Name: Gordon David Strachan The \"wee man\" as he was affectionately known to the Aberdeen support, joined the Dons in an exchange deal that took Jim Shirra to Dundee with a \u00a340,000 cash adjustment.

Strachan went on to become a vital part of the Aberdeen side, with a rare talent to easily trick his way past opponents. Capped for Scotland on 50 occasions, Strachan joined Manchester United in 1984 in a \u00a3600,000 move. Played for Scotland at two World Cups, and also enjoyed considerable success with Manchester Utd, Leeds and Coventry. Strachan took over as Coventry boss before moving to Southampton. Recently decided to part company with the Saints. Graham Leggat\n\nAberdeen born Leggat developed in to one of the all time greats when his Pittodrie career flourished during the 50's. In the early stages, Leggat was a vital cog in the Dons machine that swept to the League championship in 1955. Many observers were of the opinion that Leggat was the complete player without a weakness. Capped for Scotland before his move to Fulham on 16th August 1958 for a paltry \u00a315,000 fee, Leggat moved to Canada and was involved in the development of the game there, and made a big name for himself in sports broadcasting. Whilst with the Dons Graham was so popular that a song to the tune of the Davy Crocket theme was sung about him: \"King of Pittodrie Park.\" Hans Gillhaus\n\nSigned from PSV Eindhoven for \u00a3650,000 and was the Dons record signing at that time. The Dutch international made an immediate impact, scoring twice on his debut against Dunfermline followed by a winner against Rangers in his first Pittodrie appearance. A left-sided forward, Gillhaus provided the vital spark up front as the Dons won both domestic Cups in season 1989.90. Played for Holland at Italia 90 and was Dons top scorer before a protracted transfer ended his Pittodrie career on a sour note. Harry Blackwell\n\nGoalkeeper Blackwell arrived at Pittodrie in 1921 from Scunthorpe. Famed for playing in the Dons record score of 13-0 against Peterhead in 1923, Blackwell was reported to have watched proceedings whilst wearing an overcoat [see match report for 10th February 1923] and allegedly sheltered under an umbrella. Blackwell went on to play for Orient and Preston after leaving the Dons in 1930. Name - Clifford Harold Blackwell Died - Aberdeen, 7th March 1956 Harry Yorston\n\nFull Name: Henry Yorston. Joined the Dons from local side St Clements in 1946 and went on to become one the Dons greatest forwards. The nephew of earlier Dons' legend, Benny, Harry was an integral part of the Dons' 1955 League winning side, Yorston scored vital goals in the Dons championship season. Capped for Scotland and the Scottish League, Yorston resisted the temptation to join the trail to England by retiring from senior football in 1957 to take up employment as a fish market porter. Also assisted Buckie, Fraserburgh, Deveronvale and Lossiemouth in the latter part of his career. Famously had a big football pools win in the seventies. Took part in the newly established Youth Academy at Pittodrie from 1976. Died - Aberdeen, 14th June 1992 Henning Boel\n\nThe original Great Dane joined the Dons in 1968 after being spotted playing in America, following in the footsteps of Jens Petersen. Boel became a cult hero at Pittodrie a rugged and powerful full back who went on to play his part in the Dons successful 1970 Cup side. A strong willed ndividual, Henning walked out on the club on Thursday the 26th of October 1972 and was consequently suspended. However, he returned on the 19th of March 1973 and was back playing by the 14th of April. A Danish international, Boel's Aberdeen career was effectively ended after sustaining a serious injury against BMG in Germany in 1972. He played in a friendly match for Brighton and Hove Albion against Stoke City in February 1973 while out on loan. Jack Allister\n\nFull name: John Grandison Allister. Part of the Aberdeen side that won the title in 1955 and alongside Young and Glen he formed part of a formidable half back line. A competitive player signed from Chelsea in 1952. Jack became a bit restless at Pittodrie after missing out on games in the early part of season 1955-56 and put in a transfer request. He was turned done and went on to play many more games for the Dons. Before his transfer to Chesterfield in June 1958, Allister went on to become a League and League Cup winner during his spell at Pittodrie. Died: Edinburgh, 11th February 1999 Jack Hather\n\nLeft-winger Hather soon found himself in the Dons first team after his arrival at the end of 1948. The English born flier went on become a real asset for the Dons, and was aptly called \"The Hare.\" Was a vital part of the Dons 1955 League championship side and after taking over from Tommy Pearson. In May 1953 he played 15 minutes of a Dewar Shield match against Dundee United without his left boot. Played in the winning Dons side that took the League Cup back to Pittodrie in 1956, but was to taste disappointment in three Scottish Cup Finals in the 50's. Died: Peterlee, Co. Durham, 1st January 1996 Full Name: John Dudley Hather Jackie Beynon\n\nFull name: John Alfred Beynon. Welshman Beynon joined Aberdeen in 1932 from Doncaster and developed in to a quick winger and firm favourite at Pittodrie. Beynon's Progress Beynon, the Dons' outside right, who was taken to the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary after the match with Celtic at Pittodrie on Saturday suffering from concussion, is making good progress towards recovery. The report from the Infirmary last night was to the effect that he was getting along very nicely. Played in the epic 1937 Cup Final and provided the cross for Armstrong's goal. Tragedy struck Beynon when he was taken ill on the Dons tour of South Africa weeks after the Final. Beynon went down with Peritonitis and died in Johannesburg on 26th June 1937. Jens Petersen\n\nArrived at Pittodrie from Danish club Esbjerg where he had played as an amateur and initially struggled to make an impact. The Scandinavian invasion of Scotland was to prove a popular source of talent for Scottish clubs and none personified the success of the strategy more than Jens. After new boss Eddie Turnbull took over, Petersen began to make his mark at Pittodrie, and Jens developed in to a top-drawer defender. Played for the Dons in the 1967 Cup Final, and was appointed captain the following season. Left Aberdeen in 1970, after the emergence of Martin Buchan. Died: Esbjerg, 8th March 2012 Jim Bett\n\nJoined Aberdeen from Lokeren in a \u00a3300,000 deal in the summer of 1985 as Alex Ferguson strengthened his side on the back of the Dons 1985 title success. Previously with rangers, Bett had an almost nomadic career before finding his best days at Pittodrie. Capped 25 times for Scotland, Bett was a double cup winner in season 1989-90. Left the Dons in 1995 to take up a coaching role in Iceland. Later returned to the Aberdeen area and them moved permanently to Iceland. Jim Forrest\n\nA club record signing from Preston in 1968 when he joined Aberdeen for a \u00a325,000 fee. Previously made an Ibrox casualty after Rangers defeat at Berwick in 1967 Forrest went on to become a full international at Aberdeen and was also in the Dons side that won the Scottish Cup in 1970. Finished first season at Aberdeen as top scorer and left the Dons in 1973 to play for Hong Kong Rangers. Jim Hermiston\n\nBroke into the first team in time to help the Dons to glory in the 1970 Scottish Cup after signing from Bonnyrigg in 1965. Developed in to a fierce competitor at as a full back, but could also be called upon to do a job in the midfield. Capped at U-23 level for Scotland, was widely regarded as the best uncapped defender in Scotland at that time. In 1975, as club captain, Hermiston announced his retirement from the game, and he was to pursue a career with the Police. Hermiston emigrated to Australia, where he resumed his football career. Jim Leighton\n\nGoalkeeper who first played for the Dons in August 1978. Currently at Pittodrie in a coaching capacity after hanging up the gloves. Made his 500th appearance for the club against Dundee Utd at Tannadice in 1998. In the first of his two spells at Pittodrie, Leighton was part of the all-conquering Dons side of the 80's and is also Scotland's most capped goalkeeper, second only in the all time caps haul to Kenny Dalglish. Retired from the international team in October 1998, Leighton's first class career ended on a low note when after only two minutes of the 2000 Cup Final against Rangers, Leighton was severely injured in a clash with rangers Rod Wallace, so a memorable career was finished. Awarded testimonial against Middlesborough in July 2000. Jimmy Smith\n\nGlasgow born James Smith joined the Dons from Benburb in 1965, and the elegant Smith was fondly nicknamed \"Jinky\" by the Dons support, as his subtle skills and slight build, were his trademark. Capped at U-23 level for Scotland while at Pittodrie, Aberdeen resisted a bid from Celtic in 1968 for his services before a bid of \u00a380,000 from Newcastle United was accepted in a year later. Four caps for Scotland were scant reward for such a talent. Jimmy Mitchell\n\nAberdeen captain when the Dons were enjoying the great days of the 50's, leading the club to their first Championship in 1955. Was appointed skipper almost immediately when he was signed from Morton in 1952. Joined Aberdeen as one of their most expensive signings at the time, coming from Morton for \u00a37,000. Capped at League level, Mitchell was a popular full back, committed to the cause. Released in 1958, Mitchell went on to manage Cowdenbeath. Died in Glasgow, 11th March 2004 James Soye\n\nAnother Aberdeen capture from Newcastle, with Wilf Low going the other way, Soye enjoyed six years at Pittodrie before the outbreak of the War effectively ended his Aberdeen career. Had seen previous experience with Celtic, Southampton and the Magpies, and went on to play a vital part in the free scoring Dons side of 1910-11. Capped at League level, Soye was renowned for scoring great goals from his right wing position. In the 1940s Jimmy was working in Ireland. Jock Hume\n\nStalwart of the Aberdeen side in their formative years, Jock was signed from Broxburn and formed a formidable full back partnership with Donald Colman. His 11-year spell with the Dons proved a fruitful time and he was in the side that went close to winning the title in 1911. He returned to Aberdeen after the War for his swan song before moving to Darwen in England as a coach. Later emigrated to the United States, where he worked in Brooklyn as a masseur and kept up his interest in football but eventually returned to Aberdeen. In a somewhat unorthodox move, in February 1913, Hume was transferred to Airdrieonians and played in their Scottish Cup tie against St Mirren. A week later he was back in his usual place with the Black and Gold. Eventually, because he was restricted to playing in the reserves due to Bobby Hannah's form, he sought a transfer but Aberdeen were looking for a high fee and it did not happen. It was thought that in May 1914 he had transferred to North Shields, a club which was not party to the transfer system, so that Aberdeen got no fee, but later he appealed to the Scottish League transfer committee and his fee was fixed at \u00a3200. In the end, however, he was re-engaged in August 1914 - mainly because Hannah had gone off to the Royal Engineers - and remained at Pittodrie till after the First World War. During that time he was able to continue playing because he had joined the R.A.M.C. (Territorials) and remained based in Aberdeen. He played almost another 100 first team games. In July 1920 it was announced that Jock would finally leave the Club to become player-coach with Darwen in Lancashire. He had rendered sterling service to Aberdeen FC and went south with the best wishes of club and supporters and with the expectation that he would do well in his new role. In later years, Jock was back in Aberdeen and did a bit of refereeing and scouting, being instrumental in the trial of several players who had been playing in the USA. PITTODRIE TRIAL REFEREE JOCK HUME, FORMER PLAYER, TO TAKE CHARGE OF GAME An added attraction at the Aberdeen F.C. trial match at Pittodrie to-morrow evening will be the appearance as referee Jock Hume, the former Pittodrie fullback and a member of the famous Colman-Hume combination. Mr Hume is home on holiday from America, where he has gained fame a referee. The appearance of an old Pittodrie favourite should help to swell the crowd, which should be well over the five figure mark as usual. Source: Press & Journal 5th August 1937 Died in Aberdeen on 23rd October 1962. Jock Hutton\n\nFull Name: John Douglas Hutton Joined up at Pittodrie after the First World War, and developed into one of the toughest yet most jovial defenders in the game. Not surprisingly he could also impart tremendous power to his kicks. Originally an inside forward, his burly physique and impressive agility was put to good use as a full back. It was during the 20's that Hutton was to flourish in his new role, and he went on to become the Dons most capped player at that time with seven outings for Scotland. On 14th October 1926, he was transferred to Blackburn Rovers in a then record fee of \u00a36,000. Before retiring in 1933, won an FA Cup winners gong with Blackburn in 1928. Long after he had left Pittorie Jock used to visit Aberdeen. In June 1929, he took part in a rescue of a woman who had slipped into the Victoria Dock. He rowed out to her and her rescuer, Thomas Moir,in a boat, and managed to haul the exhausted pair aboard. In 1939, Jock, now working as a lorry driver and living at 6 Bright Street in Aberdeen, appeared in court charged with appropriating and stealing money in relation to betting. He was found guilty but because of having a clean record his punishment was limited to a fine of \u00a33 or 14 days. First name of John but always known as Jock. Died - Belfast, 2nd January 1970 Joe Harper\n\nFull Name: Joseph Montgomery Harper The 'King' as he was affectionately christened by his beloved Beach End. Signed from Morton in 1969 for \u00a340,000, Harper was the answer to the Dons goal drought as the chunky striker set about devastating many a Scottish defence. Idolised at Pittodrie, 'goal a game Harper' achieved legendary status during his Pittodrie career that was broken by a spell with Everton and Hibs. Played in the Dons Cup winning sides of 1970 and 1976, and was still around as the Dons won the Premier in 1980. His ability around the goal and predatory instincts were his strengths, but his all round talent was often overlooked outwith the North East. His tally of only four caps did not do justice to his ability. Remains the clubs record goalscorer with a total of 199 goals. [The Evening Express tried to get the number over 200 but this was not universally recognised as the additional goals came from the Drybrough Cup tournament]. Towards the end of his playing career, Joe was granted a Testimonial Year which included a dinner held at the Skean Dubh Hotel on 20th December 1979 and a match played on 31st August 1980. The dinner attracted some controversy as the Testimonial Committee made it an all male event. For many years in the 2000's Joe appeared as a columnist in the Evening Express and also helped out the Clubby acting as an Ambassador on matchdays. John Hewitt\n\nLong before he played his first hame for the Dons, he was a ballboy at Pittdorie, but Gothenburg goal hero John Hewitt will forever have his name etched in the history of Aberdeen FC because he scored the Dons goal of the century with his extra time header against Real Madrid in 1983 that meant the Dons had won the European Cup Winners Cup. Often used a substitute, Hewitt had the knack of scoring important goals for the club, including the quickest Scottish Cup goal on record. His 9-second goal against Motherwell in the Cup at Fir Park in 1982 set the Dons on a roller coaster ride that will never be forgotten. After leaving the Dons in 1989, John played for several clubs, including Celtic and St Mirren, and later had a spell as player/manager of Dundalk. John McMaster\n\nNicknamed Spammer, John arrived at Pittodrie in 1972, and was part of the successful Dons reserve side that included Willie Miller and Joe Smith. Originally a winger, McMaster was converted in to a midfield player of great stature. A master of the long ball, an exquisite left foot was the scourge of many opponents. Awarded a testimonial in 1985, and a full house bears testimony to his popularity at Pittodrie. A bad injury in the 1980 European Cup-tie against Liverpool curtailed a promising career, and McMaster remains one of the greatest uncapped Dons. Kevin McNaughton\n\nMade his full international debut for Scotland against Nigeria at Pittodrie two seasons ago. Emerged in to the Aberdeen side under Ebbe Skovdahl after impressing in the youth side. Dundee born McNaughton has also played for Scotland at U-21 level. One of the brightest talents to come through the Pittodrie ranks. He fought his way back into the Aberdeen side after injury ruled him out for several months in 2003-04 and played two outstanding seasons through 2004-2006 before transferring to Cardiff City. In July 2017, much to the delight of the travelling support, Kevin turned out for the Dons in a pre-season friendly against St Johnstone.Full Name: Kevin Paul McNaughton Mark McGhee\n\nFull Name: Mark Edward McGee Initially struggled to make an impact at Pittodrie after signing from Newcastle United for \u00a375,000 in 1979. However, under the guidance of Alex Ferguson, McGhee forged a memorable Pittodrie career, and was part of the Dons team of the 80's that carried all before them at home and abroad. Made over 250 appearances, scoring 100 goals before a \u00a3280,000 move to SV Hamburg in the German Bundesliga. Another Dons international, McGhee scored against England at Hampden in 1984, before leaving the Dons. Martin Buchan\n\nFull name: Martin McLean Buchan. One of the most gifted defenders ever to grace Pittodrie. A product of Banks O' Dee he developed in to a sweeper under the guidance of Eddie Turnbull. Was also the youngest captain ever to lead a club to success in the Scottish Cup in 1970. Named as Scotland's Player of the Year in 1971 it was Manchester Utd who paid a record \u00a3125,000 for his services. Scotland international before his move Buchan he made 34 appearances for his country. Manager of Burnley in 1985. Son of Martin senior, brother of George, Martin's son Jamie also played for the Dons in the late 90's. Matt Armstrong\n\nAn Aberdeen legend of the 30's, Armstrong developed a great understanding, bordering on the telepathic, with Willie Mills to form one of the most prolific front partnerships in British football. Scored the Dons goal in the 1937 Cup Final against Celtic, he joined the Dons from Port Glasgow in 1931. Top scorer at Pittodrie for four consecutive seasons before the outbreak of war virtually finished his top-flight career, although he did play a number of matches for Aberdeen during the war years. Capped for Scotland and was club record scorer before Joe Harper, although his goals per game ratio was better. In August 1946, Matt was appointed as the first ever coach of Crystal Palace, not that long after his transfer from the Dons to Queen of the South. Matt Forsyth\n\nFull name: John Matthew Forsyth Arrived at Pittodrie in 1920 from Glasgow Perthshire, Glasgow born Forsyth developed into a fine full back. Although a full international call up was to elude him, he was named as a reserve on several occasions. Was one of the first Dons players to be useful as an overlapping full back and this was his great strength. One of the first Dons to be awarded a benefit game before leaving the Dons in 1926. As well as playing professionally for the Dons, Matt worked as a representative of Messrs. Henry Munro Ltd and The Munro Press of Glasgow. In 1938, Forsyth appeared in court on a charge of embezzlement while acting as a collector for Thomas Strang's Pools. Described as a turf commissiona agent of 31 Belgrave Terrace, he was accused of taking \u00a3155 10s 2d during 1937. The case was complex with a good deal of evidence and ran over several days. At the end, however, Sherriff Laing found the accusation \"not proven\" and acquitted the accused - to loud cheering from football fans in the public gallery. Neale Cooper\n\nAnother of the Dons young guns that played in the Gothenburg side. Likened to the great Franz Beckenbauer in his early days it was Cooper who along with Neil Simpson provided the graft in the sublime Dons midfield of the 80's. Neale's career had many highlights, but perhaps the most talked about are his 1982 Cup Final goal against Glasgow Rangers when he charged down the ball and fired it into the empty net in the face of the massed opposition supporters. The other comes form a Pittodrie match against Glasgow Celtic when, having been wound up all week by his manager, he hammered into Carlie Nicholas within the centre circle at kick-off, barely three seconds into the game. The challenge was so early in the game that he got away scott free and left Charlie with a sporting memory that he may not have expected. Neale's nickname of Tattie was well know to Dons' fans and the fact that he was a huge fun loving character who always had time to shake hands and chat with fans made him hugely popular around Aberdeen and the north east Transferred to Aston Villa in 1986 for a \u00a3350,000 fee, Cooper went on to join Rangers and Dunfermline before eventually managing Ross County and later taking over at Hartlepool United, Gillingham. Peterhead and back to Hartlepool. After management, Neale worked in Aberdeen and spent many match-days at Pittodrie engaged in corporate activities and egging on his beloved Dons. Tragically, Neale died as a result of a fall in Aberdeen on 28th May 2018 aged only 54. Neil Simpson\n\nAnother of the original \"Fergie fledglings\" that was to play a huge part in the Dons success of the 80's. A tough, competitive midfielder, Simpson proved an ideal minder for the more subtle skills of Strachan and Weir, and was also capped for Scotland while at Pittodrie. Played in the Dons side that won the ECWC in 1983, and eventually moved to Newcastle in 1989, after an 11-year stint at Pittodrie. Made almost 300 appearances for the Dons. Rejoined the club in June 2001 to head up the Dons Community coaching initiative, later becoming head of the Youth Academy. Paddy Buckley\n\nPatrick McCabe Buckley was a vital part of the Aberdeen side that took the League title in 1955. A lightning quick forward he joined Aberdeen from St. Johnstone, where he had scored 104 goals in 140 games, in 1952. The transfer fee was \u00a37,500 of which Paddy pocketed \u00a3600. Capped for Scotland and the Scottish League during the Dons halcyon days of the mid-50's, Buckley's Aberdeen career was ended after a serious knee injury in 1957. He attempted a come-back with Inverness Caledonian in 1958 but sadly it did not work out for him. Died - Tranent Nursing Home, 4th November 2008 Paddy Moore\n\nIrishman Moore joined the Dons (at the second attempt) from Shamrock Rovers in 1932,as a direct replacement for Benny Yorston. Capped as an Irish internationalist, Moore was a prolific scorer for the Dons, and also for his country when he scored four goals in one match for his Ireland. Rejoined Shamrock in 1935, as the Armstrong-Mills partnership was blossoming at Pittodrie. Equalled the club record for scoring six goals in one game for the Dons when he netted a double hat trick against Falkirk in 1932. MOORE RETURNS TO ABERDEEN. Reporting at Pittodrie This Forenoon. MAY PLAY IN RESERVE TEAM TO-MORROW. \"Paddy\" Moore, Aberdeen's Irish international centre-forward, who has been absent from Pittodrie since December 15, returned to Aberdeen last night from Ireland. He will report to Pittodrie this forenoon. and will in all probability turn out for the reserve team against Hearts A to-morrow. It will be recalled that Moore journeyed to Dublin to play for the Irish Free State against Hungary on December 16, and his failure to report back to Pittodrie created a sensation in football circles. All sorts of rumours were rife, prominent among them being one that Moore would not return to Aberdeen. A \"Press and Journal\" representative, who learned that Moore had crossed from Dublin on Wednesday, quickly spotted the Irishman as he descended from the 6.40 from Glasgow last night. Moore was bareheaded and carried his football boots in a small attache case. In an interview the player stated that his long absence from Pittodrie was due to a misunderstanding between himself and the club. Treatment For Injury. \"I was injured in the Irish Free State-Hungary match, and wired Aberdeen to the effect that I would remain in Dublin until after Christmas in order to have the injury treated,\" he said. \"I received a wire from the club stating I must return immediately. I was unable do so, and thought I was suspended. \"Last week I received a communication from Pittodrie asking for an explanation and this I at once forwarded. Another letter from the club asked me to report at Pittodrie, and here I am.\" Moore said he had lost a stone in weight. He added that though he had not been in training he felt fit. Source: Press & Journal, 1st February 1935 Although Paddy dropped out of the first team picture at the end of the 1934-35 season, he remained on the Pittodrie books until 1939 when he was put on the open to transfer list in May. Died: Dublin, 24th July 1951 Pat McKenna\n\nHaving played in a Pittodrie reserve match against Deveronvale on the 10th of October 1944, Blantyre Celtic player Pat McKenna was signed by the Dons the week afeter after he had excelled against Dunfermline Athletic. He had played for Glasgow juvenile team Lambhill United before joining the Blantyre club. A diminutive right back, made up for what he lacked in height with his lightning speed. Glasgow born, McKenna was part of the Dons Cup winning sides of 1946 and 1947. In his six seasons at Pittodrie McKenna was a regular first team player before struggling to keep his first team position in the early 50's. Transferred to Plymouth in 1952 but only played in one senior match and moved on to St Johnstone in the following season but was not able to make his mark and appeared only three times. Ran the Marine Hotel in Muchalls after ending his playing career. Died in Aberdeen, 16th November 1995. Paul Mason\n\nFull name: Paul David Mason. A surprise, but very welcome, signing for the Dons when Alex Smith as the Dons boss plucked him from the relative obscurity of the Dutch league after watching Theo Snelders. A \u00a3200,000 fee secured the Liverpool born player who became a very popular player with the supporters at Pittodrie. Used in a variety of roles, perhaps his most telling contribution was his two goals in the 1989 League cup Final that defeated Rangers. Transferred to Ipswich after the 1993 Scottish Cup Final in a \u00a3440,000 deal. Peter Weir\n\nFull Name: Peter Russell Weir. Aberdeen and Scottish record signing at that time, when Weir joined the team he supported as a boy in a \u00a3330,000 deal that saw Ian Scanlon go to St Mirren. Weir was a deceptive winger, and provided a vital balance in the great Dons side of the 80's. Played a major part in the Dons Gothenburg success, and was also a Scottish international. Although his Pittodrie career was blighted by injury, Weir was a popular player at Pittodrie, and so often the scourge of Scottish defences. Joined Leicester City in 1987. At the end of his playing career Peter went into coaching, eventually doing a sterling job with the Aberdeen FC Youth Academy in West Scotland. Robert Connor\n\nSigned from Dundee in 1986 in a deal that took Ian Angus to Dens Park, Connor went on to play an integral part of the Aberdeen midfield that won the cup double in 1989-90. Provided the perfect foil for Jim Bett and Neil Simpson in the Aberdeen side that struggled to match the clubs glory days in the post-Fergie era. Along with Alex McLeish and Bett, Connor left the Dons in 1994, in his case to join Kilmarnock. Russell Anderson\n\nLatest in a long line of Aberdeen players to make the full Scotland side. Made his debut for the Dons in 1997 and in 2003 signed a new two-year deal. Suffered long term injury in the 2000 Scottish Cup Final, which prevented Anderson from fulfilling his potential earlier. Was made captain of the Dons under Steve Paterson and looks to get back in to the Scotland side, Anderson made his 200th appearance for the Dons before the end of season 2003-04. After an injury plagued spell of almost four seasons in the English Leagues Russell returned in 2011 for a second stint at Aberdeen where he resumed his Captain's armband. in March 2014 Russell led the Club to League Cup success in the final against Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Scott Booth\n\nEmerged from the all-conquering Aberdeen youth side of the late 80's and along with Eoin Jess made an immediate impact in the Aberdeen side. Booth made a record number of U-21 appearances for Scotland before taking that form in to the full international side. A catalogue of injuries hampered progress and he left Aberdeen in 1996 to join Dortmund. Returned to Aberdeen last summer was the Dons top scorer in 2003-04. Worked as a pundit for Setanta Sports before turning to a career as a coach. Stan Williams\n\nThe value of summer tours during that period was proved invaluable, as it was on a tour of South Africa in 1937 that the Dons party spotted Williams. The flying winger was soon on his way to Pittodrie, sailing north on the Dunnotar Castle, and he gained notoriety when he scored the Dons winner in the 1947 Scottish Cup Final. Played for Scotland during the War although he was South African and moved to Plymouth Argle in 1949 then Dundee in 1950. Full name: Alfred Stanley Williams Died in Johannesburg, 12th June 2007 Stephen Glass\n\nOne of the most promising youngsters that have come through the Pittodrie ranks in modern times. Came in to the Dons first team in difficult circumstances as the Dons came close to being relegated for the first time in season 1994-95. His craft and flair on the left side was evident even in his tender years, and it was this promise that attracted the attention of Newcastle United in 1998. Glass was one of the first players to be transferred under the new directives regarding players less than 24 years of age. Aberdeen received compensation of \u00a3650,000. Returned to Scotland and joined Hibernian at the start of season 2002-03. Steve Archibald\n\nSigned from Clyde for about \u00a320,000 in 1977 by Billy McNeill who had been his manager at Shawfield prior to moving to Pittodrie. The emerging potential of the striker was to flourish at Pittodrie. Was part of the Aberdeen side that won the Premier League in 1980. His heart set on a move to England he was sold for a record fee of approximately \u00a31,000,000 (including tax) to Tottenham shortly after the Dons title success. This was close to the time that the South Stand was redevelloped and Alex Ferguson liked to refer to it as \"Stevie's Stand.\" Made his full international debut for Scotland against Portugal during his Pittodrie career. Also went on to play for Barcelona and currently resides in the Catalan area. Steve Murray\n\nSigned for the Dons in a record Aberdeen transfer in 1970 for a fee of \u00a350,000. As he was cup-tied, Murray missed out on the Dons Cup winning side of 1970, but the cultured midfielder was a vital cog in the Dons machine that went agonisingly close to taking the title in 1971. Capped for Scotland against Belgium at Pittodrie in 1971, Murray was also Aberdeen captain before a dispute with the club in 1973 resulted in a transfer to Celtic. Moved in to management after his playing career, and must hold some sort of record when he was in charge of Forfar for only 3 days. Stewart Davidson\n\nJoined the Dons as a promising right-winger and studious passer of the ball, took some time to establish himself in the first team. Eventually emerged as a formidable defender and had a 20-year association with the club was broken by a transfer to Middlesbrough for \u00a3800 in April 1913. After the First World War, Davidson returned to Pittodrie and played on for the club till season 1924-25. After that, Davidson moved on to coaching and was assistant manager of Chelsea between 1939-1957. Died - East Ham, 26th December 1960 Stewart McKimmie\n\nAberdeen born McKimmie learned his trade with Dundee before Alex Ferguson paid the Dens Park club \u00a390,000 for his services in 1983. Played in the Dons team that won the European Super Cup, and went onto gain 40 caps for Scotland. Was made Aberdeen captain after Alex McLeish and led the Dons to the 1995 League Cup. Awarded a testimonial against Blackburn in 1994. Made over 500 appearances for the Dons, before a surprise move to Dundee United in 1997. Became involved with local media work in Radio and Newspapers after he stopped playing. Stuart Kennedy\n\nFull Name: Stuart Robert Kennedy One of the Dons best captures in modern times. Kennedy was bought for \u00a330,000 from Falkirk in 1976, with Jim Shirra going the other way, and went on to become one of the most popular players at Pittodrie. A fitness fanatic, his great attributes were his speed and power of recovery, which made him ideal for the demands of the game. Won winners medals in the League, Scottish and League Cups before injury ruled him out of the ECWC Final in Gothenburg. Was a non-playing substitute in the final, and it was that injury which finally ended his career. Capped 8 times for Scotland. Theo Snelders\n\nAlex Smith's first big signing as a replacement for Jim Leighton. Snelders was signed for \u00a3300,000 from Twente Enschede in Holland. The big keeper soon made his presence felt with a series of fine displays for the Dons. Capped for Holland during his spell with the Dons, Snelders was also part of the Dons double cup winning side in 1990. Included in the Holland squad that went to Italia 90, Snelders fell out of favour in 1995, and was sold to Rangers for around \u00a3300,000 to join as back up to Andy Goram. Full Name: Theodorus Antonius Gerardus Snelders Tommy Craig\n\nFull name: Thomas Brooks Craig. Farmed out to Banks o Dee \"A\" in his first season with the Dons. He became the first Scottish teenager to be transferred for a six-figure fee when he joined Sheffield Wednesday for \u00a3100,000 in 1969. A rare talent that was only seen in his formative years at Pittodrie, Craig went on to play for Newcastle Utd, Aston Villa and Swansea. Capped for Scotland before moving into coaching, Craig was assistant manager at Pittodrie under Roy Aitken. Tommy Pearson\n\nOne of the most skilful wingers to play for the Dons, famed for his \"double shuffle,\" and an ability to nutmeg opponents, Pearson joined the club from Newcastle for \u00a34,000 at the age of 35. Although his best days were behind him, Pearson was still a personality player at Pittodrie, appreciated by the Aberdeen support. Had the distinction of having played for both Scotland and England before retiring in 1953. In season 1951-52, when Bob McDermid was unwell, Pearson took on the role of trainer and coach to fill the gap, coaching three days and one evening a week whilst continuing as a player. He returned to Pittodrie six years after his retirement as manager, having been a newspaper columnist iin between times. Made over 100 appearances for the Dons. During the Second World War he served with the RAF at Kirkham and whilst based there played as a guest for Blackburn Rovers and Blackpool. He was a member of the Blackpool team that lost to Aston Villa in the regional Cup Final of 1944, a match played on a home and away basis. Full name: Thomas Usher Pearson. Died - Edinburgh, 2nd February 1999 Tony Harris\n\nFull Name: John Robert Harris Harris joined up at Pittodrie from Queen's Park in 1946, and was originally a centre forward. However, a switch to the right wing proved to be a shrewd change. Not the fastest player, Harris was a constatant and hard working trier and part of the Dons 1947 Cup side. True Dons stalwart, Harris moved back to right half later in his career, as his eight-year spell with the club was coming to a close. Although known as Tony his full name was John Robert Harris. During and after his football career, Tony practiced dentistry in King Street, Aberdeen. In the late 1960's Harris was involved with an attempt by a group of local businessmen to unseat the board and replace them with new faces at Pittodrie. Died: Glasgow, 25/08/2000 Willie Cooper\n\nOne of the Dons greatest ever servants, Cooper a tough full back joined Aberdeen in 1927, having made his reserve debut as a trialist from Mugiemoss in 26th February. His defining moment in a long Aberdeen career came in 1947 when a rare injury prevented him from playing in the Dons first Scottish Cup success in 1947. Such was his popularity that special permission was given by the SFA for Cooper to be presented with a medal. Played many matches for the Dons during the War years and when (re)signed by the club in July 1941 the local press stated that he was engaged in \"work of national importance\". In February 1946, Willie applied for and was granted a free transfer, but it did not lead to anything. Willie Lennie\n\nThe first great Aberdeen winger and also had the distinction of becoming the first Aberdeen player to play for Scotland when he was capped against Wales at Dens Park in 1908. Lennie scored the winner in a 2-1 win. Developed a great understanding with Charlie O'Hagan in the Aberdeen side that came close to winning the title in 1911. One of the first players to receive a benefit match from Aberdeen. After a brief spell with Falkirk, Willie retired from playing in 1913 because of injury problems. During the 1930's Willie had a spell as a football columnist for The Sunday Post. He had set up a newsagent's business at 85 Hilton Road, retiring through ill-health three years before he died aged 72 in 1954. Willie Miller\n\nFull Name: William Ferguson Miller Without doubt as Dons Greats go, Miller has no equal. He was the most inspirational of captains and played a great part in taking the Dons to the heady heights of success at home and abroad. Joined the Dons Ground Staff in 1971 and after being converted into a sweeper, Miller forged a remarkable career with the Dons. His first game as Captain came against Hearts on 22nd November 1975. League Cup wins in 1976 and 1989 sandwiched a run of success never before seen at Pittodrie. Capped for Scotland on 65 occasions, Miller has been afforded every accolade in the game. Took over as Dons boss in February 1992, but paid the ultimate penalty as the Dons struggled in 1995. Has proved a popular media pundit, but that role was curtailed after he joined the Aberdeen board in June 2004. In June 2012 Willie again left the Club and was soon active on BBC Radio Scotland delivering match analysis and opinions on all aspects of the game. Miller has never worked in professional football outwith the confines of Pittodrie. Following on from his departure from the Directorate, Willie returned to working with the BBC Scotland as a football pundit. Willie Mills\n\nPossibly the first ever Aberdeen player to be classed as the complete player, certainly in the opinion of manager David Halliday. As a young forward Mills arrived at Pittodrie in 1932 and was almost immediately thrown into the Dons first team, a position he was to claim for six memorable years. Formed an almost telepathic partnership with Matt Armstrong as the Dons came so close to claiming their first major trophy in the 30's. Capped for Scotland, Mills was transferred to Huddersfield for a club record \u00a36,500 in 1938. Zoltan Varga\n\nThe Hungarian international was a surprise signing by Jim Bonthrone in 1972, after joining the Dons from Hertha Berlin in a \u00a340,000 deal. Varga was a gifted player, blessed with a technical ability never before seen at Pittodrie, and in his brief stay at the club he thrilled the Dons support, with some fabulous moments. Often the target of the more physical players, Varga was often said to be ahead of his time, and those fortunate enough to see him at Pittodrie would not disagree. However, in his second season at Aberdeen he reported himself as being \"injured\" and unavailable to play. It was speculated that he was engineering a move back to the continent. Moved to Ajax in 1973 to replace the legendary Johan Cruyff. Died: Budapest, 9th April 2010"}, {"url": "https://www.afcheritage.org/Team/CurrentSquad/player_show.cfm?player_id=66&Season=1952-53", "page_content": "Inside forward Baird joined the Dons in 1938 but had a long wait to make his Aberdeen debut due to the war. Scored in the Dons first national triumph in the 3-2 Southern League Cup win against Rangers in 1946. Was also a vital part of the Dons successful Scottish Cup side a year later. Represented Scotland in wartime internationals, Archie Baird joined St Johnstone at the end of the 1952-53 season.\n\nAnother link with this football club's past was lost forever on the 4th November 2009, with the sad news that former player and Aberdeen legend, Archie Baird, has passed away. However his memory will always live on at Aberdeen Football Club. Whenever the Scottish Cup comes around, talk will be of the side that carried off the crown in 1947, for the very first time, and Archie Baird's role in it. That will never die.\n\nArchie Baird Interview taken from Red Matchday earlier this year\n\nBeing the oldest known living former Don was not a burden that would have worried Archie Baird; after all he has been through some incredible experiences in what has been a memorable playing career and personal life. Archie had celebrated his 90th birthday on the 8th May and was the only surviving Don from the team that won the Dons first Scottish Cup in 1947.\n\nBorn in Rutherglen, Archie joined Aberdeen as a youngster of great promise in the summer of 1938. Aberdeen offered Archie a two-year contract which was unusual back then for any young player to be rewarded with more than a year's contract. \"I had offers from Blackpool, Motherwell, St Mirren, Partick and others but my mother influenced my final decision due to the fact that Aberdeen manager Dave Halliday had good, honest eyes that were what clinched my move to Aberdeen. I had always admired the Dons and their style and moving to Aberdeen was a clean break. It all happened so quickly; six months after starting as a Junior I was away to Aberdeen and earning \u00a34 per week with a \u00a320 signing on fee. I set out on my great adventure in July 1938 leaving Buchanan Street station in Glasgow in the company of someone called Willie Waddell but not my right wing buddie from Strathclyde. By a strange coincidence there was another young player of that name with Renfrew and he too had just signed for Aberdeen. Willie was a fine player and we grew to become close friends for many years.\"\n\nArchie soon began to realise what being at a football club like Aberdeen was all about as he started out in the reserves. \"We got a taste of full-time training the month before the start of the season. Donald Colman was the trainer at that time; a quiet-spoken intelligent man. He made an immediate impression on me. When he entered the dressing room you could sense he had the respect of the hard-bitten pros. Donald was detailed in everything he did and that rubbed off on the players. He would advise players on their fitness and diet and the importance of living healthy. He was ahead of his time. He also got the best out of players and that was his real strength. Matt Armstrong was struggling to make it at Celtic but Colman transformed him at Pittodrie and he went on to become one of the best forwards ever to play for the Dons. I soon began to realise that I would turn to Donald for guidance as my form began to suffer and I lost confidence. I saw my friend Willie Waddell promoted to the first team and I was delighted for him but things were not going well for me and I was struggling to make an impact.\"\n\nIt was at that point that events in Europe were soon to have an impact on the whole country as Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939. All football was immediately stopped as every attention turned to the war effort. Events during those difficult times would have a huge bearing on Archie. \"It all happened so quickly. Here I was in Aberdeen and trying to make my way as a professional player and also training to be an architect. A couple of months later I was conscripted and was very soon in France as a member of a medical corps unit with the ill-fated British Expeditionary Force. I missed the evacuation of Dunkirk, and only managed to leave France on the last ship out of St Nazaire. That was in the summer of 1940. By Christmas I was in the Western Desert, and by May 1942 had been captured by the Germans near Tobruk and handed over to the Italians. It was at El Adem when our field ambulance attached to the infantry unit had been surrounded by a squadron of German tanks. We ended up in a camp near Tripoli, called Suani Ben Adem. It was a filthy hell-hole, a huge rectangular strip of oasis surrounded by a wire fence and sentry towers. Prisoners were unable to do anything and many died there. What an eternity those four years seemed and how different from my teenage dreams; my twenty-first birthday spent in a tent 'somewhere in France'; my football confined to games for the unit team, a kick about with the lads and the occasional improvised training session. Since the war broke out I had played only two first class games, both with Leeds United as a guest player while I was stationed at Headingly Cricket Ground awaiting transfer to Egypt. Lying there under the clear Italian sky, I relived the excitement of playing against the pre-war Everton stars; Jones, Britton, Mercer and the great Tommy Lawton. But not even the good memory of scoring a goal for Leeds that day could make me forget the seriousness of my situation.\"\n\nArchie spent much of his time during the hostilities as a POW in Italy but it was his story of what happened after his escape that was truly a tale of human courage and compassion. After eighteen months as a captive, Archie and his close friend Harold 'Smudger' Smith escaped to the foothills of the Appenines, free, but still in enemy-occupied territory. They headed south after news of an Allied landing on the Italian coast suggested that would have been their best route. However the journey was an arduous one with German patrols prominent. Their route to safety was achieved by living off the land and the generosity of sympathetic Italian farmers and peasants they met along the way.\n\n\"We had encountered many dangers along the way but the local Italian people were humble, generous people.\"\n\nIt was on that long trek to freedom that Archie came across an Italian family that would go to 'adopt' him as one of their own for several months as the harsh winter set in. The Pilotti family were Italian farmers who looked after Archie as his good friend Harold and Tom who had joined them along the way, found similar families nearby to home the escapees. Archie made life-long friendships during those days and daily news of Allied advances helped raise spirits. Archie also by his association with his new friends managed to speak the language in time. As the German occupation waned by the day and news of the Allied efforts in Italy were successful.\n\n\"As we made our way to eventual freedom we could hear gunfire in the distance. The Germans were retreating north and their convoy was an easy target for our fighters and bombers. The activity in the air was increasing as we made our way north. We eventually arrived in a village called Sarnano where it was soon to become Allied occupied territory, my feelings were mixed as the Italian people did not really understand what was happening as the Union flag was raised in their town.\n\n\"I came back a completely different person. I went away as a raw young laddie and came back after experiencing a lot, I had more confidence in myself and as far as football was concerned I was thrust straight into the Aberdeen first team so it just developed from there. On my return to Falmouth I had started playing for my unit team and for Aldershot. By early 1945 I was stationed at Edinburgh Castle and playing for Aberdeen when I could get leave arranged. The Scottish Command then selected me for a tour of Orkney Islands and I met up with some players I would face in the coming months. However the most important day for me was stepping out at Pittodrie to face Hearts for the first time in seven years and I was at last, making my first team debut. The war ended in May 1945 and I was demobbed in September.\"\n\nIt was in January 1946 that Archie gained his one Scotland cap when he played against Belgium at Hampden. \"That game should never have been played as the ground was covered in snow. The game ended in a 2-2 draw but the thick fog made conditions all the more difficult. Jimmy Delaney and Gordon Smith were alongside me in that side. It was not an ideal international to play in but the Victory International against England was something else. It was the last wartime international and was seen as a celebration of the end of hostilities. I was delighted to be selected for the Scotland team. I would be facing some famous names like Frank Swift, Len Shackleton and Billy Wright. The Saturday before the international we were playing Partick at Firhill. I went down in a tackle with Jacky husband and I knew at once that I was seriously injured. On the Monday I had to call off from the Scotland team as the injury worsened. It was a sad day for me although my team mate George Hamilton took my place.\"\n\nThe highlights of Archie's Pittodrie career came in the Dons Southern League Cup win in May 1946 and the Scottish Cup a year later.\n\n\"I had a month to recover from that injury to make it for the final against Rangers. We prepared in Largs for three days before the game and we also had to contend with the butt of all jokes as Aberdeen had never won a national trophy at that time. The game was a real highlight for me personally as I scored a goal in the opening minute. Andy Cowie sent in a long throw and George (Hamilton) flicked the ball on with his head. I managed to leap past George Young to score. When Stan Williams scored just before half time, the big Aberdeen contingent was convinced we had done enough. Rangers back though and the game was tied at 2-2 as we moved into the final minutes. In the last seconds George Taylor popped up with a sensational winner and the cup was ours.\n\n\"A year later we took the Scottish Cup as well after beating Hibernian. There was a huge Aberdeen following that day as supporters came from all over, as far away as Orkney and Shetland; a true north east invasion. It was an amazing experience and after we lost a goal in the opening minute we came back to win with Stan Williams scoring the winner. I took up a position at the near post as Stan cut in from the bye-line. I was shouting at Stan to cut the ball back, but he flicked the ball in at the near post for a great goal. Stan later admitted to me that he heard my shout but he noticed Hibernian keeper Kerr move off his line in anticipation.\"\n\nLooking back at his playing career, one player stood out from the rest as far as Archie was concerned;\n\n\"George Hamilton was the best player to play for the club. George was the complete player and it was a privilege to play alongside him. It was all so different in those days, there wasn't a great deal of influence from the manager regarding tactics or coaching. Any success we had was usually down to us playing off the cuff as it were.\"\n\nAfter finishing his career in 1956 after three seasons with St Johnstone, Archie immediately began working for the Scottish Daily Express as a north east beat reporter. Despite offers to go full time as a journalist, Archie continued with his career as a PE teacher, a profession he had taken up during his time at Pittodrie.\n\n\"You have got to look at the whole picture and I count myself lucky to have survived the war. That was the big thing. To have been able to come back and play football again was a great thrill. To be honest I have never looked upon myself as being unlucky during the war and I don't have any regrets.\"\n\nArchie Baird - Aberdeen Record"}, {"url": "https://www.afc.co.uk/2021/01/05/afc-archives-the-david-halliday-story/", "page_content": "Today is the 50th anniversary of the passing of David Halliday.\n\nHis importance to the history of Aberdeen FC should never be forgotten as he was the first manager to guide the Dons to a major trophy, when winning the 1947 Scottish Cup. He then steered them to their first Scottish title eight years later.\n\nRed Matchday\u2019s Kevin Stirling looks back at his time at Pittodrie:\n\nNot many Aberdeen managers were leaving their previous club in such a good state as Dave Halliday did with his Yeovil side in 1937. Aberdeen cast their net far and wide to find a new manager that year.\n\nHalliday had been a prolific forward as a player with St Mirren, Dundee, Sunderland, Arsenal, Manchester City and Clapton Orient. He enjoyed success on both sides of the border as both a player as the striker scored freely for all his clubs in the 1920s and 30s. He fired in 38 goals for Dundee in 1923-24 to become top scorer in Scotland\u2019s top tier that season and then hit 43 goals for Sunderland in 1928\u201329. It means he is the most recent of only two players to have been outright top scorer in the top divisions in both Scotland and England.\n\nHe eventually joined Yeovil as a player/manager in his first coaching post. He applied for the Aberdeen position and was chosen from around 100 hopefuls; his arrival in Aberdeen was shrouded in mystery as he was whisked down to Pittodrie for talks on his arrival in January 1938. Halliday had come to the Dons attention with his work with Yeovil and his last game in charge of them was in an FA Cup tie against Manchester Utd at Old Trafford.\n\nHalliday had led the non-league club to several giant-killing feats, but they eventually went down in Manchester which allowed Halliday the chance to accept the Aberdeen position. In April 1938 Halliday signed 19 year old George Hamilton from his former club, Queen of the South. This would be as shrewd a signing as Halliday would ever make. Gentleman George as he became known would show himself as a player of genuine class. His attacking danger with either foot offered in abundance the individual creativity Chapman spoke of to be channelled into a team plan.\n\nHalliday was very much from the \u2018old school\u2019 of football managers. Indeed, his only time at Pittodrie was for a brief spell on a Thursday as the players played a full practice bounce game ahead of the next fixture. That was when Halliday would appear again for the game itself. Through the week he entrusted the training and conditioning of his players with trainers Donald Colman, Bob McDermid and Dave Shaw. Halliday would spend the rest of the week carrying out administrative tasks and transfer targets.\n\nTactics were never discussed as all attentions were placed on the first team and the reserves in preparation for any game. Although the war in Europe was to prevent Halliday from his building plans, on resumption he wasted little time in becoming the first manager at Aberdeen to bring major success.\n\nIt was after the Second World War when national trophies started to arrive at Pittodrie for the first time, thus securing Halliday\u2019s place in Aberdeen folklore. During WW2 no Scottish FA Cup competition was played. The Southern Football League then operating in Scotland arranged a competition called the Southern Football League Cup. An obvious difference compared to the Scottish Cup was the initial stages operated based on small groups of teams. The winners of each section would then progress to the knockout phase. The Southern League Cup\u2019s last season (1945.46), included teams from the now defunct North Eastern Football League. This included Halliday\u2019s Aberdeen who won defeating Rangers 3-2 in the final at Hampden on 11 May 1946. Such was the success of the tournaments that from 1946.47 the Scottish Football League Cup was launched with the format used in the war.\n\nA year later Aberdeen at last won the Scottish Cup for the first time with a 2-1 win over Hibernian. At Hampden on 19 April 1947 Halliday\u2019s team won the Scottish Cup with an attendance of 82,140. The inspirational George Hamilton equalised in the 2-1 final victory against Hibernian who opened the scoring in the opening minute. Stan Williams scored the winner. Two members of the beaten Hibs team \u2013 Davie Shaw and Eddie Turnbull \u2013 later became managers of the Dons.\n\nAberdeen reached the inaugural League Cup final that season beating Hearts 6-2 in the semi. In the final they lost out to Rangers.\n\nHalliday knew that his side was now an ageing one and that a new Aberdeen team had to be built. Despite flirting with relegation on a couple of occasions, the new Aberdeen side under Halliday went on reach successive Scottish Cup finals in 1953 and 1954. Halliday returned to the Scottish Cup final in 1953 with a series of ties that went to replays. Motherwell drew 5-5 at Pittodrie before being blitzed 6-1 at Fir Park. Next was a fine result against the still excellent Hibernian side of the era. Third Lanark were knocked out in the semis in another replay before the Dons lost 1-0 to Rangers in a final replay.\n\nHalliday went to the Scottish Cup final again the season after. A second-round trip to Duns produced an avalanche win (8-0). Next were two wins against Edinburgh opposition; 3-1 away to Hibs and 3-0at home to Hearts. The win against the Jambos was witnessed by Aberdeen\u2019s record home crowd, 45,061. The semi-final draw brought a game against Rangers at Hampden. Halliday returned North with a stunning 6-0 win against the Ibrox club in the bag. The final brought the opportunity of a Glasgow double to match the Edinburgh double from earlier in the cup run. It was not to be as Sean Fallon hit the winner for Celtic to take the league and cup double with a 2-1 win. The official attendance was another of Hampden\u2019s gargantuan crowds, 130,060.\n\nDespite suffering defeat in both, Halliday steeled his team for the challenges that were ahead and in 1955 he became the first Aberdeen manager to take the Dons to a league Championship. That year brought ambitions of a league and cup double for Halliday himself. Rangers were beaten in Scottish Cup for the second season running. Next, Hearts were vanquished 2-0 at home in a replay in the quarter final. Aberdeen were 2-1 up in the semi-final against Clyde. Scotland left winger Tommy Ring then scored his second of the game to equalise in the 89th minute. Clyde were then victorious in a 1-0 replay win, just as they were against Celtic in the final. Five days after the Scottish Cup semi replay exit to Clyde, the Dons visited Clyde in the league.\n\nArchie Glen\u2019s successful penalty was the game\u2019s only goal against Pat Travers\u2019 side. The Dons clinched the title that day with two games to spare and finished the season three points ahead of Celtic. Halliday\u2019s title winners were a team engineered as per the Chapman template the Arsenal manager that Halliday played under; well organised playing methodical football based on tough defence and quick forwards.\n\nHalliday was the first manager to lift the Scottish Championship with Aberdeen.\n\nAll appeared to be looking good for Halliday at the Dons, but this was not the case. Firstly, there was conflict when the club refused to pay his players an additional bonus for winning the league. Secondly, the first season of competitive European club football was about to begin. The competition was officially named, \u201cThe European Champions Clubs Cup\u201d. It became better known more informally as the European Cup.\n\nIt has been documented that Aberdeen declined an invitation to participate. That was certainly not true and in Dave Halliday there was a vision he wanted to bring to Scotland and that was European competition. Back in 1955 when the first European Cup competition came into being, it was Aberdeen who found themselves on the outside look in as some of Europe\u2019s finest got the European Cup off to a great start.\n\nAs league champions that year Aberdeen were now keen on the new competition that had been mooted for several months. The idea of a European league may have seemed like a million miles away from most people in 1955 but the reality was that the birth of the new European Cup arrived that year. The competition first came to the fore in January 1955 when all the leading football nations were invited to nominate a side to play in the new competition at a meeting in Paris. The SFA were not in attendance at that inaugural meeting, suggesting that the governing body were adopting a lukewarm approach to the new concept.\n\nIt is difficult to defend the attitude that prevailed at the time; if Scotland had learned anything from the World Cup in 1954 than it was surely that the country had fallen way behind some of the emerging nations. Instead of embracing new horizons the European Cup was given scant attention from the mainstream of the game in Scotland. A further meeting of FIFA wholly endorsed the new competition and it was named \u2018The European Champions Clubs Cup\u2019.\n\nThe respective league champions from the competing countries would compete for the cup, but only from season 1955-56. Quite rightly Aberdeen expected to be put forward to represent Scotland. As league champions they had emerged as the best combine in the land and their involvement was keenly anticipated. However, it soon became clear that other factors were at work. Harry Swan the Hibernian chairman had been very much involved in the initial talks and was keen to see Scottish involvement. While his approach was all very laudable, the fact that a loophole in the initial rules allowed any side to be put forward meant that there was bad news for Aberdeen.\n\nSwan was also by chance the President of the SFA and it can be assumed that his forceful lobbying pushed his own side forward in to the first year of the European Cup. While the Champions League as it is known today comes under some criticism due to so many clubs qualifying that are not league champions, the irony is that in its\u2019 inaugural year, only around half of the 16 competing nations were represented by their league winners. Hibernian had finished fifth in the table with Aberdeen out of sight on their Edinburgh rivals, yet it was Swan\u2019s own Hibernian side that would compete in the first European Cup. Aberdeen maintained a diplomatic silence throughout the whole sorry affair; they had been badly treated and even the SFA glossed over the matter in their minutes taken at their meeting in July;\n\n\u201cThe Union of European Football Associations. The secretary reported having attended a meeting of the Executive Committee of UEFA in Paris on 21st June 1955, at which its principal business was the Trophy for European Associations. Hibernian FC whose acceptance was intimated, applied for permission to take part and the committee decided in the circumstances decided not to exercise their right to nominate a club but to allow Hibernian FC to compete this season.\u201d\n\nIn effect the SFA had the power to put forward the league champions, which in this instance was Aberdeen, but chose to ignore the Dons claims and allowed Hibernian to go forward to compete. All of this was kept away from the players and the supporters. For the record the Edinburgh side made it through to the semi-final\u2019s.\n\nIt was on the back of this news and the squabbling the Aberdeen players had over unpaid bonuses for winning the league, that manager Dave Halliday would be leaving Aberdeen to take over as manager at Leicester City.\n\nThis move was a bombshell for Aberdeen and totally unexpected.\n\nHe was to take up his post on 1st July 1955. Why would Halliday leave after 17 years in charge? He had achieved what many observers thought impossible and took Aberdeen to their first league title. The structure of the club was sound, there was money in the bank and the Dons stood on the threshold of further success. Dons keeper Reggie Morrison recalled that the European snub and players\u2019 bonus dispute had any bearing on Halliday\u2019s decision, he answered;\n\n\u201cWithout doubt. Halliday was a man of great integrity and a true gentleman. I was convinced that those difficulties had a bearing on his decision to leave. The fact that he was also refused a modest pay rise after winning the championship had a lot to do with his decision.\n\n\u201cIt was a great disappointment to all of us who looked upon Dave Halliday for guidance and he was someone we respected.\u201dPublicly Halliday cited the opportunity to take Leicester back to the First Division in England as the motivating force behind his move.\n\nWriting in the Sunday Post some two years after his move Halliday commented;\n\n\u201cMy best friends were shocked to learn that I was leaving Aberdeen. I was well established at Pittodrie, we had come through some difficult times and I had helped put Aberdeen on the football map by taking them to the championship. What more could I want?\n\n\u201cA lot of this was true and I was happy in Aberdeen, but he is a poor man who ceases to have ambition and is not prepared to take a risk. I did not apply for the post but when I was invited south to discuss the matter, I mentioned this to Aberdeen chairman William Mitchell who agreed I should go and talk to Leicester.\u201d\n\nIn Dave Halliday\u2019s tenure in charge of the Dons he was the club\u2019s most successful manager before the arrival of Alex Ferguson. Once more like Chapman with Huddersfield and Arsenal he left the club in good health.\n\nDavid Halliday was AFC\u2019s most successful manager before the arrival of Alex Ferguson. Only Halliday and Ferguson have managed Aberdeen to be Scottish champions. Halliday had appointed Davie Shaw as coach and on his departure, Shaw was promoted to manager. Three months after Halliday left, Aberdeen won the 1955/56 League Cup and went on to finish second in the league. While not playing in Europe, Aberdeen did play England\u2019s champions in a friendly at Pittodrie in September, beating Chelsea 4-3.\n\nReading too much into friendlies is fraught with risk but it seems reasonable that this result combined with the semi-final position achieved by Hibernian indicates Aberdeen would likely have been competitive had they played in that first European Cup. We will never really know what this team below under the management of David Halliday might have achieved had he stayed on, but like the great Aberdeen side of the early 1970s, you are left with the feeling that the squad\u2019s full potential was never fully reached.\n\nHe managed Leicester City to promotion to the top division in England from winning the 1956-57 Football League Second Division.\n\nHalliday left Leicester in 1958 and later returned to the Aberdeen area, living in Ramsay Road, Banchory and scouted for Leicester City in North-east of Scotland. He died on 5 January 1970, aged 68 at Woodend Hospital, Aberdeen.\n\nDavid Halliday was inducted into the AFC Hall of Fame in 2019 after being nominated for the AFC Heritage Trust posthumous award."}, {"url": "https://www.stmirren.com/teams/youth-academy/hall-of-fame", "page_content": "St Mirren Youth Academy graduate Jay Henderson was given his first-team debut in Saints' Scottish Cup win over Hamilton Academical in April 2021.\n\n\n\nThe winger was then rewarded with his first start a few weeks later in a Premiership fixture away to Ross County.\n\nAfter forcing his way into the first-team, Jay signed a two-year deal until summer 2023 and has gone on to make almost 40 first-team appearances."}, {"url": "https://www.peoplepill.com/people/archie-baird", "page_content": "Archie Baird (8 May 1919 \u2013 3 November 2009) was a Scottish association football player who played for Aberdeen and St Johnstone. He was also capped once by the Scotland national football team. Baird was born in Rutherglen.\n\nBaird signed for Aberdeen before the Second World War, but the war started before he had made the first team. He joined the British Army, but was captured and held as a prisoner of war. He escaped and lived with an Italian family as their \"son\". In 1989 he published an autobiography, Family of Four, which described these experiences.\n\nBaird returned to Aberdeen before the end of the war. His good form in this period earned him selection for Scotland in a friendly match against Belgium in early 1946. Baird was one of nine Scotland players making their international debut in the match, with only Jimmy Delaney having significant experience. Of those nine debutants, five players did not make another international appearance, including Baird.\n\nBaird helped Aberdeen win the Southern League Cup (a forerunner of the Scottish League Cup) in 1946 and the 1947 Scottish Cup, but his appearances were restricted by injuries. In all he made 104 league appearances for Aberdeen, scoring 26 goals in those matches. He was transferred in 1953 to St Johnstone, where he played for three seasons before retiring in 1956.\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Baird worked as a teacher and a sports journalist. His sister, journalist Mamie Baird, married TV broadcaster Magnus Magnusson; Archie is the uncle of their children, TV producer Jon Magnusson and TV news presenter Sally Magnusson.\n\nBaird celebrated his 90th birthday in May 2009, and died quietly in his sleep on 3 November 2009."}, {"url": "https://www.nationalclubgolfer.com/news/archie-baird-gullane-golf-museum-dies/", "page_content": "No trip to Gullane is complete without a visit to the Heritage of Golf Museum.

Scored in the Dons first national triumph in the 3-2 Southern League Cup win against Rangers in 1946. Was also a vital part of the Dons successful Scottish Cup side a year later. Represented Scotland in wartime internationals, Archie Baird joined St Johnstone at the end of the 1952-53 season. Another link with this football club's past was lost forever on the 4th November 2009, with the sad news that former player and Aberdeen legend, Archie Baird, has passed away. However his memory will always live on at Aberdeen Football Club. Whenever the Scottish Cup comes around, talk will be of the side that carried off the crown in 1947, for the very first time, and Archie Baird's role in it. That will never die. Archie Baird Interview taken from Red Matchday earlier this year Being the oldest known living former Don was not a burden that would have worried Archie Baird; after all he has been through some incredible experiences in what has been a memorable playing career and personal life. Archie had celebrated his 90th birthday on the 8th May and was the only surviving Don from the team that won the Dons first Scottish Cup in 1947. Born in Rutherglen, Archie joined Aberdeen as a youngster of great promise in the summer of 1938. Aberdeen offered Archie a two-year contract which was unusual back then for any young player to be rewarded with more than a year's contract. \"I had offers from Blackpool, Motherwell, St Mirren, Partick and others but my mother influenced my final decision due to the fact that Aberdeen manager Dave Halliday had good, honest eyes that were what clinched my move to Aberdeen. I had always admired the Dons and their style and moving to Aberdeen was a clean break. It all happened so quickly; six months after starting as a Junior I was away to Aberdeen and earning \u00a34 per week with a \u00a320 signing on fee. I set out on my great adventure in July 1938 leaving Buchanan Street station in Glasgow in the company of someone called Willie Waddell but not my right wing buddie from Strathclyde. By a strange coincidence there was another young player of that name with Renfrew and he too had just signed for Aberdeen. Willie was a fine player and we grew to become close friends for many years.\" Born in Rutherglen, Archie joined Aberdeen as a youngster of great promise in the summer of 1938.

By a strange coincidence there was another young player of that name with Renfrew and he too had just signed for Aberdeen. Willie was a fine player and we grew to become close friends for many years.\" Archie soon began to realise what being at a football club like Aberdeen was all about as he started out in the reserves. \"We got a taste of full-time training the month before the start of the season. Donald Colman was the trainer at that time; a quiet-spoken intelligent man. He made an immediate impression on me. When he entered the dressing room you could sense he had the respect of the hard-bitten pros. Donald was detailed in everything he did and that rubbed off on the players. He would advise players on their fitness and diet and the importance of living healthy. He was ahead of his time. He also got the best out of players and that was his real strength. Matt Armstrong was struggling to make it at Celtic but Colman transformed him at Pittodrie and he went on to become one of the best forwards ever to play for the Dons. I soon began to realise that I would turn to Donald for guidance as my form began to suffer and I lost confidence. I saw my friend Willie Waddell promoted to the first team and I was delighted for him but things were not going well for me and I was struggling to make an impact.\" It was at that point that events in Europe were soon to have an impact on the whole country as Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939. All football was immediately stopped as every attention turned to the war effort. Events during those difficult times would have a huge bearing on Archie. \"It all happened so quickly. Here I was in Aberdeen and trying to make my way as a professional player and also training to be an architect. A couple of months later I was conscripted and was very soon in France as a member of a medical corps unit with the ill-fated British Expeditionary Force. I missed the evacuation of Dunkirk, and only managed to leave France on the last ship out of St Nazaire. That was in the summer of 1940. By Christmas I was in the Western Desert, and by May 1942 had been captured by the Germans near Tobruk and handed over to the Italians. It was at El Adem when our field ambulance attached to the infantry unit had been surrounded by a squadron of German tanks. We ended up in a camp near Tripoli, called Suani Ben Adem. It was a filthy hell-hole, a huge rectangular strip of oasis surrounded by a wire fence and sentry towers. Prisoners were unable to do anything and many died there. What an eternity those four years seemed and how different from my teenage dreams; my twenty-first birthday spent in a tent 'somewhere in France'; my football confined to games for the unit team, a kick about with the lads and the occasional improvised training session. Since the war broke out I had played only two first class games, both with Leeds United as a guest player while I was stationed at Headingly Cricket Ground awaiting transfer to Egypt. Lying there under the clear Italian sky, I relived the excitement of playing against the pre-war Everton stars; Jones, Britton, Mercer and the great Tommy Lawton. But not even the good memory of scoring a goal for Leeds that day could make me forget the seriousness of my situation.\" Archie spent much of his time during the hostilities as a POW in Italy but it was his story of what happened after his escape that was truly a tale of human courage and compassion. After eighteen months as a captive, Archie and his close friend Harold 'Smudger' Smith escaped to the foothills of the Appenines, free, but still in enemy-occupied territory. They headed south after news of an Allied landing on the Italian coast suggested that would have been their best route. However the journey was an arduous one with German patrols prominent. Their route to safety was achieved by living off the land and the generosity of sympathetic Italian farmers and peasants they met along the way. \"We had encountered many dangers along the way but the local Italian people were humble, generous people.\" It was on that long trek to freedom that Archie came across an Italian family that would go to 'adopt' him as one of their own for several months as the harsh winter set in. The Pilotti family were Italian farmers who looked after Archie as his good friend Harold and Tom who had joined them along the way, found similar families nearby to home the escapees. Archie made life-long friendships during those days and daily news of Allied advances helped raise spirits. Archie also by his association with his new friends managed to speak the language in time. As the German occupation waned by the day and news of the Allied efforts in Italy were successful. \"As we made our way to eventual freedom we could hear gunfire in the distance. The Germans were retreating north and their convoy was an easy target for our fighters and bombers. The activity in the air was increasing as we made our way north. We eventually arrived in a village called Sarnano where it was soon to become Allied occupied territory, my feelings were mixed as the Italian people did not really understand what was happening as the Union flag was raised in their town. \"I came back a completely different person. I went away as a raw young laddie and came back after experiencing a lot, I had more confidence in myself and as far as football was concerned I was thrust straight into the Aberdeen first team so it just developed from there. On my return to Falmouth I had started playing for my unit team and for Aldershot. By early 1945 I was stationed at Edinburgh Castle and playing for Aberdeen when I could get leave arranged. The Scottish Command then selected me for a tour of Orkney Islands and I met up with some players I would face in the coming months. However the most important day for me was stepping out at Pittodrie to face Hearts for the first time in seven years and I was at last, making my first team debut. The war ended in May 1945 and I was demobbed in September.\" It was in January 1946 that Archie gained his one Scotland cap when he played against Belgium at Hampden. \"That game should never have been played as the ground was covered in snow. The game ended in a 2-2 draw but the thick fog made conditions all the more difficult. Jimmy Delaney and Gordon Smith were alongside me in that side. It was not an ideal international to play in but the Victory International against England was something else. It was the last wartime international and was seen as a celebration of the end of hostilities. I was delighted to be selected for the Scotland team. I would be facing some famous names like Frank Swift, Len Shackleton and Billy Wright. The Saturday before the international we were playing Partick at Firhill. I went down in a tackle with Jacky husband and I knew at once that I was seriously injured. On the Monday I had to call off from the Scotland team as the injury worsened. It was a sad day for me although my team mate George Hamilton took my place.\" The highlights of Archie's Pittodrie career came in the Dons Southern League Cup win in May 1946 and the Scottish Cup a year later. \"I had a month to recover from that injury to make it for the final against Rangers. We prepared in Largs for three days before the game and we also had to contend with the butt of all jokes as Aberdeen had never won a national trophy at that time. The game was a real highlight for me personally as I scored a goal in the opening minute. Andy Cowie sent in a long throw and George (Hamilton) flicked the ball on with his head. I managed to leap past George Young to score. When Stan Williams scored just before half time, the big Aberdeen contingent was convinced we had done enough. Rangers back though and the game was tied at 2-2 as we moved into the final minutes. In the last seconds George Taylor popped up with a sensational winner and the cup was ours. \"A year later we took the Scottish Cup as well after beating Hibernian. There was a huge Aberdeen following that day as supporters came from all over, as far away as Orkney and Shetland; a true north east invasion. It was an amazing experience and after we lost a goal in the opening minute we came back to win with Stan Williams scoring the winner. I took up a position at the near post as Stan cut in from the bye-line. I was shouting at Stan to cut the ball back, but he flicked the ball in at the near post for a great goal. Stan later admitted to me that he heard my shout but he noticed Hibernian keeper Kerr move off his line in anticipation.\" Looking back at his playing career, one player stood out from the rest as far as Archie was concerned; \"George Hamilton was the best player to play for the club. George was the complete player and it was a privilege to play alongside him. It was all so different in those days, there wasn't a great deal of influence from the manager regarding tactics or coaching. Any success we had was usually down to us playing off the cuff as it were.\" After finishing his career in 1956 after three seasons with St Johnstone, Archie immediately began working for the Scottish Daily Express as a north east beat reporter. Despite offers to go full time as a journalist, Archie continued with his career as a PE teacher, a profession he had taken up during his time at Pittodrie. \"You have got to look at the whole picture and I count myself lucky to have survived the war. That was the big thing. To have been able to come back and play football again was a great thrill. To be honest I have never looked upon myself as being unlucky during the war and I don't have any regrets.\" Archie Baird - Aberdeen Record Season Apps Goals 1946-47 19 7 1947-48 22 7 1948-49 7 1 1949-50 23 6 1950-51 40 10 1951-52 27 6 1952-53 6 0 Total 144 37\n\nAppearances: show debut only Date Result Competition Venue Att.

encyclopedia\n\nScottish footballer\n\nArchibald MacKechnie Baird (8 May 1919 \u2013 3 November 2009) was a Scottish footballer, who played for Aberdeen and St Johnstone. He was also capped once by the Scotland national football team.\n\nPlaying career [ edit ]\n\nBaird was born in Rutherglen.[3] Having played for local Junior clubs in the area, he signed for Aberdeen before the Second World War (along with Willie Waddell, although it was the other player of the same name who had been his teammate at Strathclyde), but the war started before he had made the first team.[4] He joined the British Army, but was captured and held as a prisoner of war.[4] He escaped and lived with an Italian family as their \"son\". In 1989, he published an autobiography, Family of Four, which described these experiences.[4]\n\nBaird returned to Aberdeen before the end of the war.[4] His good form in this period earned him selection for Scotland in a friendly match against Belgium in early 1946.[4] Baird was one of nine Scotland players making their international debut in the match, with only Jimmy Delaney having significant experience.[5] Of those nine debutants, five players did not make another international appearance, including Baird.[5]\n\nBaird helped Aberdeen win the Southern League Cup (a forerunner of the Scottish League Cup) in 1946 and the 1947 Scottish Cup, but his appearances were restricted by injuries.[4] In all he made 104 league appearances for Aberdeen, scoring 26 goals in those matches. He was transferred in 1953 to St Johnstone, where he played for three seasons before retiring in 1956.[4]\n\nLater life and family [ edit ]\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Baird worked as a teacher and a sports journalist.[4] His sister, journalist Mamie Baird, married TV broadcaster Magnus Magnusson; Archie is the uncle of their children, TV producer Jon Magnusson and TV news presenter Sally Magnusson.\n\nBaird celebrated his 90th birthday in May 2009,[6] at which point he was Aberdeen's oldest living former player; he died quietly in his sleep on 3 November 2009.[1]\n\nCareer statistics [ edit ]\n\nClub [ edit ]\n\n* Unofficial wartime appearances\n\nInternational [ edit ]\n\nAppearances and goals by national team and year[9] National team Year Apps Goals Scotland 1946 1 0 Total 1 0\n\nBibliography [ edit ]\n\nBaird, Archie (1989).

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nAny contemplation of the life of Archie Baird must attach colossal significance to the game of football, as Aberdeen fans of the 1940s and early 1950s will testify with unstinting enthusiasm and affection.\n\nBut all that achievement and derring-do in the Pittodrie cause, exhilarating and ground-breaking though unquestionably it was, doesn't begin to tell the full story of a remarkable individual whose intrepid, intensely harrowing experiences as a prisoner of war place mere sporting issues in their proper context.\n\nBaird, a tall, stylish, creative inside-forward, was a key figure as the Dons lifted the first major trophies in their history during the immediate post-war seasons, by which time he was no longer looking at the world through the eyes of the callow, promising rookie who had been the target of eminent clubs on both sides of the border in 1938. At that point the likes of Blackpool, Motherwell, Partick Thistle and St Mirren were vying for his signature, but the 19-year-old's mother was so impressed by the honest approach of the Aberdeen manager David Halliday that the boy heeded her advice to head north-east from his Lanarkshire home to enlist with the Dons.\n\nBaird, who had starred for Strathclyde Juniors alongside the future Rangers luminary Willie Waddell, was an intelligent fellow who nursed ambitions to be an architect, but his football skills had proved impossible to ignore and now he planned to train in the mornings and study for his future career in the afternoons. However, he made a slow start at Pittodrie, struggling for an impact in this new competitive environment, and he was still featuring for the reserves when war broke out in 1939.\n\nNow, all too soon, the youngster who had viewed joining the Dons as a great adventure was to find himself caught up in an expedition of an altogether more daunting nature, one on which failure surely must have carried fatal consequences.\n\nWhile serving in the medical corps for the ill-fated British Expeditionary Force, he missed the evacuation at Dunkirk but managed to board the last ship out of St Nazaire when France fell in summer 1940. Awaiting his return to the war, Baird was stationed at Headingley, Yorkshire's cricket headquarters, and while he was there he guested for Leeds United, facing top performers of the day such as the Everton trio Tommy Lawton, Joe Mercer and Cliff Britton.\n\nThe respite was brief, though, and he was dispatched to North Africa, where he was part of the force which confronted Rommel in the Western Desert. When Tobruk was taken in the summer of 1942, his field ambulance was surrounded by German tanks and he was captured and handed over to the Italians, who placed him in a prisoner-of-war camp near Rimini on the Adriatic coast.\n\nMany of his fellow detainees died in what he described later as \"a filthy hell-hole\" but Baird, who whiled away some of his time by day-dreaming about his life as a footballer, remained resilient and in 1943, after 18 months of incarceration, he and a comrade, Harold Smith, managed to escape. Knowing that the Allies had landed in Italy, and aiming to join them, the pair headed south into the lower reaches of the Appenines. They lived off the land, helped on their way by sympathetic Italian farmers, and when severe winter weather set in Baird was sheltered for some months by a compassionate family, the Pilottis, who found other safe billetts for Smith and another fugitive who had joined the pair on their trek towards freedom.\n\nWith his sharp and lively mind, Baird picked up Italian quickly, enabling him to pose convincingly as the son of his courageous benefactors, to whom he became devoted and with whom he embarked on a lifelong friendship. \"They were real heroes,\" he said years later. \"They looked after me despite knowing the Germans would have shot them if they had found out.\"\n\nEventually, as Hitler's forces pulled out of Italy, Baird rejoined the Allied ranks and returned to Britain, guesting as a footballer for Aldershot and non-League Falmouth before returning to Aberdeen following his demob in September 1945. Vastly matured by his recent experiences, he was now a far more confident character than the tentative youth he had been during his initial Pittodrie sojourn, and he became established rapidly in the Dons' first team.\n\nOperating as an incisive prompter alongside his close pal and fellow inside-forward George Hamilton and the diminutive spearhead Stan Williams, Baird proved hugely influential as Aberdeen won the Southern League Cup, an emergency wartime competition and the precursor to the soon-to-be-launched Scottish League Cup. They beat Rangers 3-2 in a see-sawing final in front of 135,000 fans at Hampden Park in May 1946 to claim the first big prize since the club's formation in 1903.\n\nThere was reward on a wider front, too, with an appearance for Scotland in the Victory international against Belgium that January, the game finishing 2-2. Because it was classed as an unofficial wartime encounter, no cap was awarded, and that proved to be his sole outing for his country. He was immensely unfortunate because he had excelled against the Belgians, keeping his feet deftly in thick snow on a foggy Hampden afternoon, and had been selected for the next fixture, against England, only to be forced out through injury.\n\nA season later Baird was prominent again as the Dons beat highly-fancied Hibernian 2-1 to win the Scottish Cup, thus securing their first senior trophy and emphasising the progress they had made in finishing third in that term's title race behind Rangers and Hibs. They reached the inaugural League Cup final, too, losing 4-0 to Rangers, and faced the future on a tide of optimism.\n\nBaird, with his clever passing, neat ball skill and happy knack of contributing important goals, was seen as a major plank of Halliday's entertaining side, but he was hampered cruelly by knee problems which demanded three operations, and also he suffered a fractured leg. His best extended run was in 1950-51, when he scored 10 times in 40 league and cup appearances, but after barely figuring in 1952-53, the 34-year-old \u2013 whose overall record of 37 goals in 144 games for Aberdeen would have been far more extensive had he been blessed with fitness on a consistent basis \u2013 accepted a transfer to second-tier St Johnstone.\n\nAt McDiarmid Park Baird enjoyed a fruitful Indian summer, moving back to wing-half and missing only a handful of matches as the Saints twice finished in upper mid-table, then narrowly missed promotion to the top flight in 1955-56, his last campaign.\n\nAfter leaving the game, Baird \u2013 who until his death was believed to be Aberdeen's oldest surviving player \u2013 embarked on a fulfilling and packed life as a sports writer for the Scottish Sunday Express and a PE teacher who rose to become assistant head of Hilton Academy in Aberdeen by the time he retired in 1979. Somehow he even chiselled out the necessary time from his crowded schedule to qualify as a glider pilot.\n\nBaird believed passionately in education, achieving degrees in English and Italian through the University of London by correspondence course in the 1960s then teaching his second language at evening class. A warm, gregarious and charming man who had come to love all things Italian, he moved to Italy for a year from 1980, along with his wife Nancy, to teach English there.\n\nHis attachment to journalism was equally deep \u2013 many of his family members were practitioners, including his brother-in-law Magnus Magnusson and Magnusson's daughter Sally \u2013 and he became a popular columnist on the Aberdeen-based monthly magazine Leopard.\n\nArchie Baird was an author, too, penning a moving autobiography, Family Of Four (1989). It was a book in which his love of football was abundantly evident, but which illustrated eloquently his appreciation of its rightful place when he came to consider the more profound values of life.\n\nIvan Ponting\n\nArchibald MacKechnie Baird, footballer, journalist and teacher; born Rutherglen, Lanarkshire 8 May 1919; played for Aberdeen 1938-53, St Johnstone 1953-56; marriedn (one son, one daughter); died Cove, Aberdeen 3 November 2009."}, {"url": "https://www.golfheritage.org/archie-baird-scotlands-ambassador-for-golf-dies-at-95/", "page_content": "Archie Baird, beloved ambassador for golf who lived in Gullane, Scotland, died Sunday, Dec. 7, 2019.

He was also capped once by the Scotland national football team. Baird was born in Rutherglen.\n\nBaird signed for Aberdeen before the Second World War, but the war started before he had made the first team. He joined the British Army, but was captured and held as a prisoner of war. He escaped and lived with an Italian family as their \"son\". In 1989 he published an autobiography, Family of Four, which described these experiences.\n\nBaird returned to Aberdeen before the end of the war.

Of those nine debutants, five players did not make another international appearance, including Baird.\n\nBaird helped Aberdeen win the Southern League Cup (a forerunner of the Scottish League Cup) in 1946 and the 1947 Scottish Cup, but his appearances were restricted by injuries.

With a few days notice, Baird will offer free tours of his Heritage of Golf museum right next to Gullane's pro shop. Here, Baird shows off his extensive collection of artwork, memorabilia and equipment, including some bizarre old clubs.\n\n\"I especially enjoy showing Americans this one,\" he says with a grin. It's an old, hickory iron designed by an American that has a wooden face attached to the iron head. \"They thought that it was the wood that made the ball go far, so they put wood over the face of the iron, bless them.\"\n\nThe tour starts at the beginning of golf history, dating back into the 1300s. Though the game's origins are debated by many, Baird has plenty of proof the game was played by the Dutch on ice, including paintings of men playing to a stick on ice, as well as some young Dutch children in formal portraits holding ancient tools, resembling the game's first clubs.\n\nIn a painting from 1668, you'll notice Dutch men now joined by men in kilts. Those are Scots, who would sell wool to the Dutch in the winter and would sometimes stay for days or months if the weather was unfavorable to return home.\n\nBaird especially enjoys talking about the golf ball, which went from an expensive, feather-core ball to a cheaper, more mass-produced ball made of a black, gum-like Gutta-Percha, just after 1850. This allowed the number of golf clubs in the world to go from just a handful to thousands by 1900.\n\nThe tour ends rather abruptly, as Baird notes:\n\n\"Then the modern, rubber-core ball came along in the 1920s, courses had to adapt to it, and I lost interest. Any questions?\"\n\nThat's not entirely true. Baird still plays the game regularly, often at Gullane, especially enjoying the shorter Gullane No. 3 course, designed by Harry Colt in 1910.\n\nFor more information, see www.heritageofgolf.org."}, {"url": "https://www.nationalclubgolfer.com/news/archie-baird-gullane-golf-museum-dies/", "page_content": "No trip to Gullane is complete without a visit to the Heritage of Golf Museum.
