{"Mois\u00e9s Kaufman is the founder and artistic director of Tectonic Theater Project, a New York-based theater company.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Moises-Kaufman", "page_content": "Mois\u00e9s Kaufman, (born November 21, 1963, Caracas, Venezuela), Venezuelan-born playwright and director who is best known for perceptive and moving plays often rooted in issues of sexuality. He was cofounder in 1991 of Tectonic Theater Project, a company dedicated to examining the structure and language of theatre as well as addressing contemporary social issues.\n\nKaufman was born in Venezuela to Orthodox Jewish parents and was of Ukrainian and Romanian descent. He attended a yeshiva (Jewish religious school) as a child and was exposed to broader culture on family trips to New York City. A Caracas theatre festival he attended as a young teenager brought him exposure to the avant-garde plays of such artists as Peter Brook, Tadeusz Kantor, Pina Bausch, and Jerzy Grotowski, whom he cited as his early influences. While attending Metropolitan University in Caracas (B.A. in business administration, 1985), Kaufman joined a touring experimental theatre group as an actor. In 1987 he moved to New York City, where he studied theatre directing at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, meanwhile directing a variety of plays. It was at NYU that he honed his ideas about the purpose and most-effective means of presenting theatrical performances. Four years later Kaufman, together with his partner, Jeffrey LaHoste, established Tectonic Theater Project.\n\nKaufman\u2019s writing debut, Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde (performed 1997\u201398, published 1997), illustrated his concerns as a writer-director. He was especially interested in what he termed \u201cwatershed historical moments,\u201d events that reveal the foundations of society\u2019s beliefs. A powerful and moving play that used actual trial testimony, Gross Indecency won an Outer Critics Circle Award for outstanding Off-Broadway play. Kaufman and his troupe then began work on The Laramie Project (performed 2000, published 2001, television movie 2002), interviewing numerous residents of the small Wyoming city in which gay college student Matthew Shepard had been brutally murdered. The play had particular resonance with Kaufman, who was gay, and it proved popular throughout the world.\n\nIn 2003 Kaufman directed a one-man show, Doug Wright\u2019s I Am My Own Wife: Studies for a Play About Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (performed 2003\u201304), the story of a gay transvestite who survived life in Nazi Germany and Soviet East Berlin. It was critically acclaimed and resulted in a Tony Award nomination for Kaufman. In the next several years Kaufman directed a variety of plays, including Wilde\u2019s Lady Windermere\u2019s Fan and Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth. He also directed his own play 33 Variations (first performed 2007), starring Jane Fonda as a musicologist obsessed with Beethoven\u2019s Diabelli Variations, and received another Tony nomination. In 2009 Kaufman and other Tectonic members arranged for 150 simultaneous readings in theatres across the globe of a sequel, The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later. He also directed Rajiv Joseph\u2019s Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo (performed 2011), starring Robin Williams as the title character; a 2012\u201313 revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz\u2019s The Heiress, a play based on Henry James\u2019s novel Washington Square; and a revival of Torch Song (2018\u201319), which was written by Harvey Fierstein. In 2016 Kaufman received the National Medal of Arts."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/16/us/moises-kaufman-stonewall-50.html", "page_content": "Merely a year later, some 5,000 activists held the first pride march in New York City \u2014 with similar marches held in Chicago and Los Angeles. And the rallying cry of the movement became: \u201cWe must all come out of the closet. We must make ourselves known.\u201d\n\nCamus also states in his book that \u201cin every act of rebellion,\u201d the rebel experiences a \u201ccomplete and spontaneous loyalty to certain aspects of himself.\u201d Just four years after the riots, in 1973, we said \u201cno\u201d to the American Psychiatric Association, and its leaders at long last removed the diagnosis of homosexuality from its official list of mental illnesses.\n\nThe next year, 1974, we said \u201cno\u201d to being politically powerless when Elaine Noble, the first out lesbian to run for a state-level political office, was elected to the Massachusetts State Legislature. And, famously, in 1977, an openly gay man, Harvey Milk, was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.\n\nBut as the battle went on, and as the character of the homosexual was being redrawn in revolt, 1981 brought about the first cases of the AIDS epidemic. And the death toll \u2014 and the country\u2019s initial refusal to respond to it \u2014 brought to the surface the depth of homophobia, transphobia and other queer-centered bigotry in the American psyche.\n\nA radical rethinking of tactics and actions was needed, and a new kind of gay activist was born. Lambda Legal, GMHC (formerly the Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis), Act Up and a host of other organizations redefined the way civil rights wars were being fought."}, {"url": "https://stageagent.com/writers/3201/moises-kaufman", "page_content": "Mois\u00e9s Kaufman is a playwright, director, and founder of the Tectonic Theater Project based in New York City.\n\nKaufman was born in Caracas, Venequela on November 21, 1963.

Four years later, he and his partner, Jeffrey LaHoste, created the Tectonic Theatre Project. The company is dedicated to addressing contemporary social issues, as well as to explore the structure and language of theatre.\n\nKaufman has stated that he is primarily drawn to moments in history that unintentionally reveal a society's views and belief systems. His first play, Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde, premiered in New York City in 1997. It won the Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Off-Broadway play.\n\nFrom 1998-1999, Kaufman and the Tectonic Theater Project traveled to Laramie, Wyoming to interview those connected to the murder of gay college student Matthew Shepard. The ensuing work compiled from their interviews, The Laramie Project, premiered in 2000 and was made into a film for HBO on 2001. The play gathered a worldwide following and has become a seminole work for the LGBQT community and for professional theaters, universities, high schools, and community theaters.\n\nIn 2003, Kaufman directed Doug Wright's I Am My Own Wife: Studies for a Play About Charlotte von Mahlsdorf. The play follows a gay transvestite who survived life in Nazi Germany and Soviet East Berlin. Kaufman received a Tony Award nomination for his direction. In 2007, Kaufman directed for Broadway again, this time for his own play, 33 Variations starring Jane Fonda as a musicologist obsessed with Beethoven\u2019s Diabelli Variations. This garnered him his second Tony nomination.\n\nIn 2009, Kaufman and other members of the Tectonic Theater Project reunited to create The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later, a sequel to the original piece. It was performed in staged readings around the globe.\n\nIn 2011, he directed Rajiv Joseph's Bengal Tiger At the Baghdad Zoo on Broadway starring Robin Williams. In 2012, he directed a revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz's The Heiress on Broadway.\n\nMr. Kaufman has been honored with a Steinberg/ATCA Best New Play Award, a Dike Award, an Outer Critics Circle Award, a GLAAD Media Award, a Drama Desk Award, a Lucille Lortel Award, a Carbonell Award, a Bay Area Theater Critics Circle Award, a Lambda Book Award, Venezuela's Casa del Artista, American Library Association's GLBT Literature Award, the Matthew Shepard Foundation\u2019s \u201cMaking A Difference Award\", the Artistic Integrity Award from the Human Rights Campaign, the National Board of Review Award for Outstanding Made for Television Movie, a Golden Bear Award from the Berlin Film Festival, the Humanitas Prize,the Joe A.

In recognition of his contributions to the theater and to international conversations about social justice, he has received numerous professional and humanitarian honors. Mois\u00e9s is an Obie and Lucille Lortel award winner, a 2002 Guggenheim Fellow in Playwriting, winner of the 2002 Humanitas Prize, and has been nominated for Tony, Emmy, and Drama Desk awards. He was awarded the 2015 National Medal of Arts from President Barack Obama, which he accepted in a ceremony at the White House in September 2016.\n\nMois\u00e9s was born in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1963, and he grew up surrounded by the city\u2019s thriving international performance scene. He studied with several theater companies at home and then, in 1987, moved to New York City to complete his education at New York University. He attended NYU\u2019s groundbreaking Experimental Theatre Wing, where he deepened his investigation of the role of text in the creative process and his love of challenge in theatrical structure. When he finished school in 1991, Mois\u00e9s founded Tectonic Theater Project with his husband, Jeff LaHoste. Many of their first collaborators came from Mois\u00e9s\u2019s artistic circle at the Experimental Theatre Wing.\n\nTectonic\u2019s early productions were a natural expansion upon the themes that had absorbed Mois\u00e9s in his studies: structurally difficult plays demanding extensive problem-solving in stagecraft. He found his path to creative maturity, though, in applying that passion for form and experimentation to his own new work, most notably 1997\u2019s critically acclaimed Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde, which ran off-Broadway for a year and a half. Gross Indecency gained Mois\u00e9s and the company national recognition and its success enabled them to travel to Laramie, Wyoming to pursue their next undertaking.\n\nThat next work, The Laramie Project (which Mois\u00e9s wrote in collaboration with members of Tectonic after an extensive community-based research process), is an examination of the cultural conflict surrounding the 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard. It opened at the Denver Theater Center in March 2000 and moved to New York shortly thereafter. TIME called Laramie \u201cone of the 10 best plays of 2000,\u201d and it was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience. It was also recently selected by the New York Times as one of their \u201c25 Best American Plays Since \u2018Angels in America\u2019\u201d and remains among the most performed plays in the United States. In 2002, Mois\u00e9s co-wrote and directed HBO\u2019s film adaptation of The Laramie Project, which garnered two Emmy Award nominations\u2014Best Director and Best Writer.\n\nIn the years since Gross Indecency first brought his methods to wider attention, Mois\u00e9s has continued to refine his devising process with Tectonic, always with an aim toward using the powers unique to theater to explore primary sources and understand underrepresented stories\u2014old and new. His writing and adaptation credits include 33 Variations (2007), The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later (2008), One Arm (2011), and Carmen (2013-2016); as artistic director he has also guided the development of Anushka Paris-Carter and Andy Paris\u2019s Uncommon Sense (2017).\n\nMois\u00e9s is also a dedicated teacher. Since 2000, he and the company\u2019s teaching artists have been sharing Tectonic\u2019s techniques in lectures, training labs, and educational residencies. In 2018, he co-wrote Moment Work: Tectonic Theater Project\u2019s Process of Devising (Vintage), a comprehensive introduction to his theatrical principles and the company\u2019s creative tools.\n\nOn Broadway, Mois\u00e9s has directed the 2012 revival of The Heiress with Jessica Chastain, the Tony-nominated 33 Variations with Jane Fonda , Rajiv Joseph\u2019s Pulitzer Prize finalist Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo with Robin Williams, and Doug Wright\u2019s Pulitzer- and Tony Award-winning I Am My Own Wife with Jefferson Mays. He recently helmed the off-Broadway revival (Second Stage) and Broadway transfer of Harvey Fierstein\u2019s Torch Song.\n\nOther directing credits include The Tallest Tree in the Forest with Mark Taper (Brooklyn Academy of Music), The Nightingale (La Jolla Playhouse), The Common Pursuit (Roundabout), Macbeth with Liev Schreiber (Public Theater), This Is How It Goes (Donmar Warehouse), Tennessee Williams\u2019s One Arm (New Group and Steppenwolf Theatre Company), El Gato con Botas (New Victory Theater), Master Class with Rita Moreno (Berkeley Repertory Theatre), and Into the Woods (Kansas City Repertory Theatre). In January 2019, Mois\u00e9s directed the world premiere of the musical Paradise Square at Berkeley Repertory Theatre.\n\nMost recently with Tectonic, Mois\u00e9s has written and directed the workshop premiere of The Album (Here There Are Blueberries) at Miami New Drama in June 2018.
