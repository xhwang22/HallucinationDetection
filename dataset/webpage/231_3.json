He was knighted in 1897.\n\nEarly life and education Laurier was born of French Canadian parents and studied at the college at l\u2019Assomption, where he received literary training under Catholic priests. He then studied law at McGill University in Montreal and was called to the bar in 1864. His bicultural education, most unusual at the time, may have played a part in his lifelong dedication to Canadian unity. While at McGill, he became a leading member of the Institut Canadien, a political club of advanced liberals (Les Rouges) with anticlerical and republican views. Later he joined the law offices of one of the leading Rouge politicians and contributed a number of articles to radical newspapers, one of which he edited for a few months in the mid-1860s. In 1866, for reasons of health, Laurier moved to Athabaska, where he opened his own law practice. In 1868 he married Zo\u00eb Lafontaine of Montreal, and, despite a long relationship with Emilie Lavergne, his law partner\u2019s wife, his childless marriage seems to have been a happy one. In 1871 he was elected to the opposition benches of the provincial legislature of Quebec, where his first speech, an eloquent plea for educational reform, attracted much attention. In 1874 he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons, of which he was to be a member until his death.\n\nRise to leadership As Laurier gradually rose to become minister of internal revenue (1877\u201378) and eventually to leadership of the opposition Liberal Party in 1887, he persistently sought to bring together his countrymen on the issues that have since been recognized as the dominant themes of modern Canadian politics: the relations of church and state, the bicultural entente between French- and English-speaking Canadians, and the country\u2019s association with the British Empire and relations with the United States. One of the political highlights of these years for Laurier was his famous speech on Liberalism delivered in 1877 in the city of Quebec. In that speech he set himself against both the Quebec politicians who attempted to form a Catholic party and the extremist elements in his own group who sought to exclude the clergy from all political activity. Because of his skillful statesmanship, the cold antagonism between conservative churchmen and liberal politicians gradually began to thaw; after 1896 no anticlerical ever attained important public office and no cleric officially interfered in politics. In 1885 Laurier became a national figure when he delivered a moving plea of clemency for Louis Riel, who had led a rebellion of the M\u00e9tis (people of mixed French and Indian extraction) in Manitoba and whose death sentence provoked violent outbursts between the French Catholic nationalists in Quebec and the Britannic groups in Ontario. Showing great courage, Laurier, though not condoning Riel\u2019s actions, charged the government with mishandling the rebellion. Although he did not succeed in saving Riel, he established his reputation as a man of principle and high ideals. Throughout his political life, he emphasized moderation and compromise and gradually became recognized as the only leader able to effect a national reconciliation. At the same time, he was turning his personal magnetism into a valuable political weapon. Between 1887 and 1896 he perfected his party\u2019s organization, refined Liberal strategy, made political alliances, assessed local partisans, and judiciously applied his personal charm to winning over Conservative adversaries and dissident Liberals. He infused new life into his party, for instance, by campaigning vigorously for unrestricted reciprocity, the grant of mutual commercial privileges, with the United States. After the policy had served its purpose, however, he dropped it from his platform in 1893. Between 1895 and 1896 he spoke at between 200 and 300 meetings, thus personally reaching some 200,000 voters. In mid-1896, with the Conservative government divided and disorganized, he easily carried the Liberal Party to victory in the general election.

Thus the quintessential Quebecer among the province\u2019s premiers uttered his first cries in a hospital in New Brunswick, on the other side of Baie des Chaleurs. By his own account, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque enjoyed a happy childhood in New Carlisle by the sea, with a father he idolized, for whom the word \u201cculture\u201d had meaning, and a mother with a mercurial disposition like his own, which led to a relationship that was difficult, yet full of affection never put into words. He grew up in the unforgettable, remote Gasp\u00e9, with its cod fishers and its villages that ran down to the sea. According to his relatives and close friends, his lifelong marked compassion for the destitute and the common people stemmed from his roots in the Gasp\u00e9 and his early contact with poverty and underdevelopment, even though he himself came from a well-to-do family. This attitude was probably also explained by the example set by the father he admired, of whom he would say that, lawyer though he was, he showed unconditional respect for others.\n\nNew Carlisle at that time had a population of not quite 1,300, of whom a third were French-speaking and subject to the dictates of the great loyalist families who had fled the American revolution and settled there in the 18th century. Two distinct societies, living side by side, they were a perfect symbol of Canada\u2019s \u201ctwo solitudes.\u201d In this world, where English was required for making oneself understood, young Ren\u00e9 lost no time in becoming bilingual. He also discovered that the rich spoke English, lived in homes that looked like castles beside the modest houses of the francophones, and enjoyed a network of modern schools that showed his local one up for what it was: a \u201cmiserable shack more than a kilometre away from home,\u201d as he put it in Attendez que je me rappelle \u2026, the memoirs he was to publish in Montreal in 1986 (translated under the title Memoirs by Philip Stratford and published in Toronto in 1986).\n\nThroughout his life L\u00e9vesque would present himself as a man of the people who would break away from his middle-class origins. His mother, Diane Dionne, was a doctor\u2019s daughter and traced her lineage back to the seigneurs of Tilly, near Quebec City. His father, who came from Saint-Pac\u00f4me, in the Kamouraska region, was a prominent lawyer of the Quebec bar in the Gasp\u00e9. Before settling in New Carlisle and fitting himself into the French Canadian elite, allied to the loyalist \u201cfamily compact\u201d that ruled over the town, Dominique L\u00e9vesque had been a partner of Ernest Lapointe*, whose law office was in Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup and who would become the Quebec lieutenant of Canadian prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King*. Young Ren\u00e9\u2019s rebellious streak ran in the family. One of his maternal ancestors, Germain Dionne, a rich farmer and bailiff of the seigneury of La Pocati\u00e8re nostalgic for the French r\u00e9gime, had fought the British army alongside American insurgents during the rebellion in the colonies. On his father\u2019s side, his ancestor Charles Pearson had mutinied when in the Royal Navy; after deserting his ship in the harbour at the mouth of the Rivi\u00e8re Ouelle, he had put down roots in the area and become the first miller of the seigneurial mill. In 1817 he married Marguerite Pastourel; their daughter Marcelline married Dominique L\u00e9vesque (Ren\u00e9\u2019s paternal great-grandfather), of the sixth generation of L\u00e9vesques originating in Normandy.\n\nRen\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque realized very early in life that he was born to be a leader. The eldest of four children, he made an impression on everyone, both at the local school in New Carlisle and at the S\u00e9minaire de Gasp\u00e9, where he began his classical studies in September 1933. When he arrived at the seminary, one of the first questions he asked its superior, Father Alphonse Hamel, was whether there was a library. He did not take well to discipline and had a calculating side to his personality, which was offset, however, by his obvious intellectual leadership. Having been introduced by his father to the great masters of French literature and to politics, he was brighter and more cultured than the average student. Conscious of his superiority, he did not make friends easily, preferring the company of such authors as Jules Verne, Alexandre Dumas, \u00c9mile Zola, and Victor Hugo, whom he discovered in his father\u2019s well-stocked library. Secretive by nature, he put up a wall against anyone who wanted to lead him into the realm of emotions and sentiments, and secretive he would remain throughout his life. But since he was a gifted student and took all the prizes, he was forgiven everything.\n\nRen\u00e9\u2019s Jesuit teachers, including Charles Dub\u00e9, a cousin of the famous Fran\u00e7ois Hertel [Rodolphe Dub\u00e9], pampered him, while at the same time making him aware of the nationalist ferment and its causes, the economic and social inferiority of French Canadians that was intensified by the grinding poverty of the 1930s. In his memoirs, L\u00e9vesque would acknowledge that he had liked Hertel\u2019s iconoclastic book, Leur inqui\u00e9tude (Montreal, 1936), whose clear conclusion predicted that Quebec would separate from Canada some day. At a public meeting held in the seminary courtyard during the 1935 election campaign, he heard the nationalistic diatribe of Philippe Hamel*, a dentist and popular speaker for the Action Lib\u00e9rale Nationale, against the grip of \u201cforeign trusts\u201d on the lives of French Canadians. At the age of 13, he asked the existential question in the seminary\u2019s newspaper \u201cL\u2019Envol\u201d: Why remain French? His conclusion showed how precise his political thinking had already become and foreshadowed the realistic nationalist politician he would be, while also revealing a vaguely vengeful sentiment: \u201cLet\u2019s demand from the Jews and the Americans, not the insignificant positions that we now hold, but the high positions to which we are entitled. From the day when that is accomplished, we will be able to call ourselves masters in our own house.\u201d\n\nIn June 1937, when Ren\u00e9 was 14 years old, tragedy struck him. His father, whom he would describe in his memoirs as the most important man in his life, died at the age of 48 in a hospital in Quebec City. As the summer of 1938 came to an end, Ren\u00e9 was transplanted from his native Baie des Chaleurs region to that city. He saw his mother\u2019s swift remarriage in January 1939 as a betrayal. Diane Dionne wed Albert Pelletier, a lawyer with connections to the separatist Quebec City weekly La Nation, whose influence on Ren\u00e9 would be significant, despite their troubled relationship. Lacking the strictness of the father he had idolized, and at odds with his mother, he gradually lost interest in his studies. He had shone in the sixth year (Rhetoric) just as he had in the Gasp\u00e9, but at the beginning of 1940, while he was in the first year of the Philosophy program, the authorities of the Coll\u00e8ge des J\u00e9suites Saint Charles Garnier expelled him because he had slipped to wretchedly low marks. He was accepted at the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec, where he concluded his classical studies with difficulty in 1941. He then enrolled at the law faculty of the Universit\u00e9 Laval, but abandoned his studies in 1943, to the great despair of his mother.\n\nL\u00e9vesque chose a Bohemian lifestyle, chasing girls and playing poker with Jean Marchand and Robert Cliche*, two Universit\u00e9 Laval students destined, as he was, to become famous, and he dreamed of becoming a writer. A budding playwright, he co-authored with Lucien C\u00f4t\u00e9 \u201cPrincesse \u00e0 marier,\u201d a \u201clight-hearted and highly imaginative little piece,\u201d which he had staged at the Palais Montcalm in Quebec City. The play was a monumental flop. This failure did not keep him from making a second and last foray into the world of drama. Probably in 1943 he wrote a piece for radio entitled \u201cAux quatre vents.\u201d The play would not be produced until it was rediscovered half a century later; it would be published in Montreal in 1999. In this work the 20-year-old L\u00e9vesque seems pessimistic about the future of the French Canadians of his time, whom he portrayed as reduced to a people made invisible by history. \u201cAux quatre vents\u201d also foreshadowed the Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque of the years to come. Indeed, what would he do with his life if not spend it all trying to liberate those French Canadians \u2013 who came to regard themselves as Quebecers \u2013 from their invisibility?\n\nIn fact, L\u00e9vesque\u2019s true passion was radio journalism, which he had discovered earlier at CHNC, in New Carlisle, during the summer of 1938, his last in the Gasp\u00e9. While he was gaining experience in Quebec City at the private radio station CKCV on Carr\u00e9 D\u2019Youville, and then at CBV, a regional station of Radio-Canada, the French-language network of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, in the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac, World War II broke out. Like the many Quebecers of his generation who were loath to shed their blood for the commonwealth, L\u00e9vesque was opposed to conscription, an issue that was tearing Canada apart. But General Charles de Gaulle\u2019s appeal to occupied France in June 1940 shook his convictions. The Nazis were threatening freedom and democracy. This was the challenge of his generation; he could not wash his hands of it.\n\nIn the fall of 1943 L\u00e9vesque was 21 years old. He was called up. He was quite willing to go and see the war that he was describing to his listeners on CBV, but with a microphone, not a gun. He pleaded first with his immediate superiors at Radio-Canada, who managed to have his military training postponed until sometime in January 1944. Shortly before that fateful date, he made a vain attempt to persuade the director general of Radio-Canada to find him a job as a war correspondent in one of its overseas teams. It was Uncle Sam who saved him from military service. As it happened, the American Office of War Information was recruiting bilingual information agents like him. And so, in May 1944 he was in London, attached to the French section of Voice of America / La Voix de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique, a program of the American Broadcasting Station in Europe that had been set up by the Americans and was flooding the occupied countries, particularly France, with propaganda. In June, when the Allies landed on French soil, L\u00e9vesque was eager to get to the line of fire, but his wartime odyssey did not really begin until February 1945. Holding the rank of junior lieutenant, he joined General Omar Nelson Bradley\u2019s army, which had liberated part of France and then stopped in Paris. Next came the march to the German border with General George Smith Patton and General Alexander McCarrell Patch, the crossing of the Rhine, and the discovery of a shattered Germany with its great cities, such as Nuremberg, Stuttgart, and Munich, devastated. Finally, there was the horror of the Holocaust, which turned his stomach when he entered the concentration camp at Dachau with the first group of American journalists.\n\nWhen L\u00e9vesque went back home in the fall of 1945, a gulf separated him from the apprentice journalist of pre-war years. All his life he would repeatedly utter warnings, insisting that every society has the potential for returning to the jungle and barbarism. He would always be suspicious of the possible blunders of the Quebec nationalism that he himself would nonetheless strongly and rationally personify.\n\nRadio-Canada came to L\u00e9vesque\u2019s rescue by opening its doors to him in late October 1945. Despite the feeble voice he had brought back from the war, he became an announcer on La Voix du Canada, a daily news program produced by the international service of Radio-Canada and broadcast from Montreal to France and other French-speaking countries and territories. L\u00e9vesque presented Canadian current affairs in four parts: news, documentaries, news reports, and cultural events. He would stay at this job for nearly eight years. He also found refuge in marriage, children, and family life. On 3 May 1947 he pledged his loyalty to Louise L\u2019Heureux, his fianc\u00e9e since before the war.\n\nAt Radio-Canada, L\u00e9vesque was not restricted to his work with La Voix du Canada (which was sometimes broadcast in Canada). He could also be heard nationally. After hosting Journalistes au micro (1949\u201350), he would work simultaneously on La Revue de l\u2019actualit\u00e9 (1951\u201354) and La Revue des arts et lettres (1952\u201354), where he gave highly critical film reviews. Within a few years he established himself as one of Radio-Canada\u2019s leading lights. Imaginative but unmethodical, he loved doing on-the-spot reports. Those he wrote from Korea, where he was a war correspondent from July to September 1951, made his reputation as a great international reporter. During these years he worked closely with Judith Jasmin*, with whom he carried on a love affair. Though he did not look the part, he was considered at the time the Don Juan of Radio-Canada. There was something appealing about him. He loved women and they responded to him in kind. In October 1951 he and Jasmin were assigned to cover the visit of Princess Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, to Canada. From January 1954 they were co-hosts of Carrefour, a new radio program devoted to news reports. But soon the rising medium of television shunned him. L\u00e9vesque was no Adonis. Short and balding, he had tics and smoked like a chimney. Yet his lively interview with some Russian schoolgirls on Red Square in the fall of 1955 was a sensation on the television news. Radio-Canada had assigned him for radio but also for television \u2013 just this once would not hurt \u2013 to cover the visit of Lester Bowles Pearson*, Canada\u2019s minister of external affairs and future prime minister, to the Soviet Union. When the intransigent Nikita Khrushchev mistreated Pearson in L\u00e9vesque\u2019s presence, the special correspondent for Radio-Canada got his first international scoop. In 1956, though his bosses at Radio-Canada doubted he had the looks for the job, L\u00e9vesque finally made the leap to television and quickly rose to the rank of \u201cgod of the TV screen,\u201d to quote Georges-\u00c9mile Lapalme, leader of the provincial Liberal Party. On Point de mire, a cult program of the late 1950s, he used his passion for teaching and communicating to explain the world\u2019s great dramatic events, such as the Suez crisis and the war in Algeria. It was at this time that the born seducer began a secret love affair with a young actress who, in 1958, bore him a daughter he would never acknowledge. This extramarital paternity prompted Louise L\u2019Heureux to begin divorce proceedings, but she subsequently dropped them.\n\nIn December 1958 the producers at Radio-Canada went on strike for the right to form a union. The strike soon became politicized and foreshadowed the turmoil of the 1960s. This event, in which L\u00e9vesque was deeply involved, marked a turning point in his career. He went into it a journalist and came out a politician. The dispute dragged on for more than two months, with no movement on either side. He was dumbfounded by the indifference of John George Diefenbaker*\u2019s government and of his English-speaking colleagues at the CBC, who boycotted the strike, considering it a revolt against Canada. Many people would say that this strike was a catalyst in L\u00e9vesque\u2019s nationalistic development. Moreover, for the first time he had the experience of addressing large crowds, and became aware of his power over them. Once the dispute was settled, it seemed evident that television had become too small a world for him. Until then, he had asked the questions; from this time on, he would want to give the answers as well.\n\nOn 22 June 1960 L\u00e9vesque took the plunge, entering the political arena as a candidate in the riding of Montr\u00e9al-Laurier, where he won by a narrow margin. Courted by the Liberals since his resignation from Radio-Canada in April, he had finally rallied to the slogan of their new leader, Jean Lesage*, \u201cIt\u2019s time for a change!,\u201d which prefigured the Quiet Revolution. The soundness and serious nature of the reforms proposed by the Liberals \u2013 free education, hospitalization insurance, a new direction in the economy, modernization of the state, and war on patronage \u2013 had persuaded him. He would soon assert himself as a star minister in the famous \u201cfireball team,\u201d which intended to bring the province into the modern era. This team, also baptized by the press as the \u201cthree Ls,\u201d combined the three leading figures in the Liberal Party: Lesage, Lapalme, and L\u00e9vesque. The new premier, Lesage, initially gave L\u00e9vesque two portfolios, public works and hydraulic resources. At public works, convinced that it was possible to be a politician and remain honest, L\u00e9vesque attacked corruption, at the request of his leader, who had made it one of his priorities. More specifically, he attacked the system of patronage instituted by the former government of Maurice Le Noblet Duplessis*. Henceforth, all government contracts for more than $25,000 would be tendered.\n\nIn March 1961 two ministries \u2013 hydraulic resources and mines \u2013 merged to become the ministry of natural resources. L\u00e9vesque would hold this portfolio until January 1966, but he left public works to Ren\u00e9 Saint-Pierre. A practical politician, L\u00e9vesque did not let ideology get in his way. If he counted primarily on the state as the lever of economic development, it was because French-speaking Quebecers possessed only one big business: their government. They had no true entrepreneurial class capable of combatting the province\u2019s economic backwardness in certain sectors. He was of the opinion that electricity, which Quebec had in abundance, must become a public monopoly. It had been too hastily let go to foreign capitalists, who charged exorbitant and disparate rates, depending on whether one lived in Montreal or the Gasp\u00e9, and sent the profits out of the province. It must now be entrusted to the Quebec Hydroelectric Commission (or Hydro-Quebec), created in 1944 by the government of Ad\u00e9lard Godbout*, which had nationalized the Beauharnois Light, Heat and Power Company and Montreal Light, Heat and Power Consolidated to form the nucleus of Hydro-Quebec. What was needed for electricity to become the engine of the Quebec economy was the consolidation of its exploitation, which was divided at the time among 11 private companies that the government should nationalize. In 1962 L\u00e9vesque created an uproar by uttering for the first time the taboo word \u201cnationalization.\u201d He finally imposed it, despite the original refusal of Lesage, who was worried about its repercussions on the provincial debt.\n\nThe premier did indeed have a change of heart. He was outraged by the blackmail on the part of the Toronto and Montreal bankers, who not only refused to finance nationalization but threatened to have nothing to do with government loans if the administration took over the Shawinigan Water and Power Company. The argument that increasing the debt would drive the province into bankruptcy, put forward by George Carlyle Marler and other ministers opposed to nationalization, did not hold up. Douglas Henderson Fullerton, an independent financial expert consulted by Lesage, gave him a reassuring report. If Canadian moneylenders did not want to assist in underwriting nationalization, the Americans would be only too glad to do so, since the province\u2019s debt was one of the lowest in the country. L\u00e9vesque got the same assurance from Roland Giroux*, a broker who had close ties to American financial circles. After the election, L\u00e9vesque would send him to New York with his advisers Michel B\u00e9langer* and Jacques Parizeau* to borrow the money required to finance nationalization. As for the electrical companies, they had at last given in, confining their actions to raising the stakes with respect to the monetary compensation that the government planned to pay them. If Lesage finally stopped his shilly-shallying, it was also to reaffirm his leadership, which had been damaged by his indecision. There was no better way to re-establish unity than a surprise election he was certain to win, according to the opinion poll he had secretly commissioned.\n\nOn 14 Nov. 1962, in an election that was almost a referendum, fought under the slogan \u201cMasters in our own house,\u201d the voters gave their consent to the nationalization of the private electrical companies. The total cost, originally estimated at $600 million, would rise to $604 million. The loan negotiated in New York would come to $300 million. The nationalist fervour of the 1960s had worked in L\u00e9vesque\u2019s favour. It had become inconceivable that huge foreign companies should exploit the province\u2019s resources and then send most of their profits abroad. Besides, the advantages of nationalization had finally been made obvious. It was necessary to put an end to the waste caused by the overlapping of power lines and anarchy in the catchment areas, where private companies were stepping on each other, as well as to the varying rates being charged. The government would recover the taxes that companies had been sending to Ottawa. The Quebec economy would also benefit from the creation of a whole range of secondary enterprises in different regions. Last of all, L\u00e9vesque, whose charisma and persuasive powers were far from negligible, had had the support of the people and the press. He had also been able to count on the respect and admiration that Lesage still showed him.\n\nThree years later, on 15 Oct. 1965, L\u00e9vesque would carry out an initial assessment of Hydro-Quebec. It had become the largest industrial enterprise in the province, with 17,000 employees and assets of $2.5 billion. It produced 34 per cent of Canada\u2019s hydroelectric energy. Furthermore, this \u201ccolossus,\u201d as the press called it, spoke French, both on the large construction sites and at its head office, where English had ruled absolutely until that time, even though a majority of the employees were French-speaking. Hydroelectricity became the field for training French-speaking managers and engineers, who had formerly been underestimated at the Shawinigan Water and Power Company.\n\nL\u00e9vesque also discovered that the mining sector was simply a \u201cbranch\u201d of foreign multinationals, which shipped ore to the United States, where factories transformed it into finished products. Since the province was satisfied with royalties that were among the lowest in Canada, the profits also ended up in foreign hands. The management and the expertise came from elsewhere. He also observed that there was no real policy on mining development. Convinced that the state had to play a role in exploring and exploiting its mineral resources, he undertook a radical revision of legislation on mining, which by now was more than 80 years old. Then, by forcing Lesage\u2019s hand while the premier was under pressure from the big companies, he would create in 1965, with the support of his cabinet ally Eric William Kierans*, the Quebec Mining Exploration Company (SOQUEM). To ensure that the concessions would no longer lie dormant for years, the leases became revocable after ten years of inactivity. Last of all, he doubled the mining fees previously paid by the mining companies.\n\nLong before the awakening of the First Nations, L\u00e9vesque was keenly interested in the aboriginal question. The Gasp\u00e9 of his childhood was also the homeland of the Micmac, who were confined to their wretched reserves in Restigouche and Maria (Gesgapegiag), adjacent to New Carlisle. In the summer of 1954, as a reporter for Carrefour, he accompanied Prince Philip on a visit to the Inuit of Ungava Bay, and the discovery of their Third-World conditions left him feeling uneasy. In 1961, during a trip to New Quebec that he undertook as part of his portfolio as minister of natural resources, he rediscovered the almost prisonlike world in which First Nations people and Inuit were living. And he was distressed by the absence of French in the province\u2019s northern latitudes. In the federal schools, neither French nor Inuktitut had any standing. This vast territory had been ceded to Quebec in 1912, but its governments had allowed Ottawa to move in with its schools, its health clinics, and its civil servants, all of which served to anglicize the aboriginals.\n\nDetermined to recover authority over New Quebec and its inhabitants, L\u00e9vesque came up against the refusal of the federal minister of northern affairs and national resources, Arthur Laing, who held back the transfer by claiming that the Inuit did not want to speak French. At the end of May 1964, in Winnipeg, Laing maintained that Ottawa had to keep control of education, health, and welfare, \u201cin order,\u201d according to the Montreal daily Le Devoir (30 May), \u201cto preserve the rights of Eskimos as first-class citizens.\u201d A furious L\u00e9vesque retorted that the minister\u2019s fears \u201cwere inspired by political considerations and hypocrisy.\u201d When Laing told the House of Commons he doubted L\u00e9vesque\u2019s sincerity, the latter reminded him that Quebec was the only province in Canada that had set an example, since confederation, of respect for the linguistic and religious rights of the minority. The Toronto press, for its part, attributed \u201cterritorial ambitions\u201d to L\u00e9vesque, according to the title of an article by Blair Fraser* in Maclean\u2019s on 16 May 1964, and even separatist designs. Nevertheless, the territory in question belonged to Quebec and the Inuit population, who, not being considered \u201cIndian\u201d by the federal government, were not covered by the Indian Act. Even worse, in L\u00e9vesque\u2019s eyes, was the fact that the neighbouring province of Newfoundland had been governing Inuit there since entering confederation in 1949. He was exasperated by this double standard and the words being put into his mouth. According to Fraser\u2019s report, he warned: \u201cThis Ungava issue is a test case of federal-provincial co-operation. If we can\u2019t even settle this, we can\u2019t settle anything.\u201d Common sense would finally prevail, thanks to the direct involvement of Prime Minister Pearson and Premier Lesage. During his term as federal minister of northern affairs and national resources, from 1953 to 1957, Lesage had not concerned himself with the question, but now he fully supported L\u00e9vesque\u2019s claim. Although he occasionally toned down his minister\u2019s aggressive behaviour, he nevertheless suggested to Pearson that he bring Laing into line and demanded, at the federal-provincial conference held in November 1963, that the transfer of jurisdiction be put into effect before 1 April 1964.\n\nA few years later the New Quebec that L\u00e9vesque had known in the 1960s, with its unsanitary shacks lacking electricity and heating, would become unrecognizable. Electricity and heated dwellings would be the norm. But in addition the city of Kuujjuaq would have a hospital, a secondary school, an arena, and an administrative centre. L\u00e9vesque had had a hand in this result. By putting the north under his protection, he had stimulated intergovernmental innovation and competition in the fields of education, health, and the economy.\n\nIn October 1965 there was a surprise cabinet shuffle. The pendulum of Liberal reform swung from the economy to social policies. L\u00e9vesque left the natural resources portfolio for that of family and social welfare. The world of the underprivileged was familiar to him. On Saturday mornings, his riding office was crowded with ordinary individuals asking to see \u201cRen\u00e9.\u201d L\u00e9vesque himself had the natural humility of common people. His first objective was to put through one single law on social assistance, centred on the family. He tackled the problem of adoption, which he wanted to make more humane, got approval for free medical assistance to the poor, increased the allowances for unmarried mothers, and prepared a white paper on handicapped children. At the Ottawa conference held in January 1966, convinced that social security ought to come from the provincial government, he demanded \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 the return of responsibility for family allowances. Thanks to this last trial of strength with Ottawa, and the earlier one that had pitted him against Laing, L\u00e9vesque took the measure of Canadian federalism, which seemed to him to have been hardening with respect to Quebec\u2019s demands since the arrival of Pierre Elliott Trudeau* in Ottawa following the November 1965 election. In February 1969 he would admit, in an interview with Jacques Guay of Le Magazine Maclean (Montr\u00e9al): \u201c[As for] me, I already no longer thought it possible that a federal state would agree to cut off a limb. As I watched the files and the conflicts with Ottawa multiply, I became, without daring to admit it to myself, more and more of a sovereignist.\u201d\n\nOn 5 June 1966 his party\u2019s defeat at the polls forshadowed the end of L\u00e9vesque\u2019s political career as a Liberal. Stripped of power, he had the impression that he was staring into a void and was not too sure what to do with his future. Having been re-elected in his riding, his only immediate certainty was that he would complete his four-year term as a backbencher. After that, he would see \u2013 perhaps he would go back to journalism, but nothing was less sure. L\u00e9vesque rethought his political affiliations in a Quebec caught up in the fever of protest that was sweeping the western world. Pacifists were denouncing the war in Vietnam, students were occupying campuses, partisans of independence were chanting \u201cLe Qu\u00e9bec aux Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois,\u201d supporters of the Union Nationale were demanding \u201c\u00c9galit\u00e9 ou Ind\u00e9pendence\u201d as their leader Daniel Johnson* \u2013 now premier \u2013 had written in his book published in Montreal in 1965. In July 1967 Charles de Gaulle, the president of France, unleashed his famous \u201cVive le Qu\u00e9bec libre!\u201d from the balcony of Montreal\u2019s city hall. And then there was the Front de Lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec, which was setting off its bombs.\n\nPreviously, when L\u00e9vesque was asked whether he was a nationalist, he would hesitate, still haunted by his memories of the war. Though he was a nationalist in his own way, the question would always make him uneasy. In 1948 he had written in the staff magazine of Radio-Canada\u2019s international service: \u201cI am for all practical purposes a Quebec nationalist, a perfect Laurentien.\u201d In fact, what left him cold was traditional French Canadian nationalism, with its \u201cFrenchifying gimmicks, bilingual cheques, the flag,\u201d as he would put it in 1969 to Le Magazine Maclean. L\u00e9vesque, who peppered his remarks with tangible examples that inspired confidence, displayed a practical nationalism. If he made a reference to the massive dam on the Rivi\u00e8re Manicouagan, it was to suggest to French-speaking Quebecers that they were capable of great things. He would never be a flag waver, fearing the politics of the street with its ever-present potential for emotionalism and brutality. This was the reason why he was constantly at odds with the Rassemblement pour l\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Nationale, whose direct action, verbal violence, and chauvinistic language repelled him. Nevertheless, in the June 1966 election, when that party was running candidates, he was troubled. Since Pierre Bourgault*, then the leader of the RIN, had moderated his words and given a social-democratic flavour to his political position, L\u00e9vesque had the impression that he was fighting against a fraternal party.\n\nEarlier, on 27 February, L\u00e9vesque had made it clear that the aim of nationalism, as he was trying to live it out, was to abolish the privileges, not the rights, of the English-speaking minority. He confirmed in his memoirs: \u201cI am a nationalist \u2026 if that means being for oneself, fiercely for oneself \u2013 or against something \u2026 against a given situation. But never against someone.\u201d He saw this \u201csituation\u201d more clearly after six years of political struggles. The Quiet Revolution was only a beginning. Quebec had to go further to free itself from the economic yoke it had laboured under for too long, and from a federal regime that had hardened after the first years of the decade, when there had been a more obvious willingness on Ottawa\u2019s part to cooperate with the provinces. The acceleration of Quebec nationalism during the 1960s left its mark on L\u00e9vesque. Even though it was not really a question of conversion, he had been throwing around, especially since 1963, incendiary phrases that bore witness to his radicalization. During a stop in Toronto at the end of May 1963, he admitted to television interviewer Pierre Berton* that he would not shed many tears if Quebec separated. On 5 May 1964 Le Devoir\u2019s headline on the report of his visit to Timmins, Ont., stated that, according to L\u00e9vesque, \u201cbetter separation than constant quarrelling.\u201d On 9 May, speaking to the students at the Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Marie in Montreal, he declared that the only appropriate status for Quebec was that of an associate state, a status which would have to be negotiated with the rest of Canada \u201cwithout rifles and without dynamite as far as possible.\u2026 If Quebec is refused this status, we will have to separate,\u201d Le Devoir noted two days later. According to the Montreal Star of 20 Feb. 1967, he warned his listeners in western Canada: \u201cEither Quebec gets a new deal [with the rest of Canada] or eventually it will get out.\u201d\n\nDuring the summer of 1967, after carefully weighing all the factors, L\u00e9vesque concluded that the country had become a \u201cmadhouse,\u201d and that the future lay somewhere else than in this federal Canada, which he rejected, and of which Trudeau had become the champion ever since his election to the House of Commons in 1965. \u201cWe are Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois,\u201d he declared in the manifesto he issued first to his supporters in the riding of Laurier on 18 Sept. 1967. (A slightly amended version would be published in Montreal the following year.) The title, Option Qu\u00e9bec (published as An option for Quebec, Toronto, 1968), summed up its basic idea. At the age of 45, L\u00e9vesque chose to struggle henceforth for a Quebec homeland. By doing this, he assumed the role of fraternal enemy to Trudeau, his ally of the 1950s, when they and a handful of others comprised the informal opposition to the Duplessis government. When the Quiet Revolution made its first proclamations, they were in agreement on many things: a larger role for the state in education, the economy, and social affairs; the modernization of Quebec; and the democratization of its political life. But the conflict of personalities was never far below the surface. The nationalization of private electrical companies was one of the subjects on which they took opposite stands. Their relationship, never easy, was finally overwhelmed by the flood tide of the new nationalism. Just a few short months later, in April 1968, Trudeau would become prime minister of Canada. A battle of titans broke out between two strong leaders who had irreconcilable visions of their province\u2019s future.\n\nIn October 1967 the convention of the Quebec Liberal Party opened in an atmosphere of hostility, which became contagious as soon as the party\u2019s former star took his seat. The wind had changed. Lesage and Kierans, who had worked closely with L\u00e9vesque during the good years of Liberal reform, sealed his fate by threatening to resign if his ideas were supported by the delegates. Nevertheless, L\u00e9vesque tabled his resolution, \u201cA sovereign Quebec within a Canadian economic union,\u201d inspired by his manifesto. Quebec would no longer be a province but a sovereign state, levying taxes, passing laws, and dealing with other nations in its own name and its own language, but would associate with Canada at the economic level. Unable to convince his Liberal comrades-in-arms, L\u00e9vesque withdrew his resolution before the show of hands that would take place, nonetheless, after his departure. He announced that he would do his best to promote it elsewhere. Then, followed by a handful of supporters, he left the hall. From then on, the rebel would sit in the Legislative Assembly (renamed National Assembly the following year) as the independent member for Laurier, while preparing to launch his own party.\n\nFor some, L\u00e9vesque was now a heroic figure; for others, he was public enemy number one. With 400 adherents one month after his resignation, the group that would become the sovereignist party had grown to 2,000 by January 1968. On 19 April, at the founding of the Mouvement Souverainet\u00e9-Association, from which the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois would be born, the membership had climbed to more than 7,000. From the moment the MSA was founded, L\u00e9vesque kept the future party from becoming sidetracked into political marginalization. He had to threaten to go home to win respect for the educational and linguistic rights of the English-speaking minority, which were contested by the faction within the movement that identified with the RIN. L\u00e9vesque gauged the fragility of his leadership and distinguished more clearly the various groups, often opposed to each other, that made up his new political family: former Liberals, the separatist followers of Bourgault (who would himself scupper the RIN), social-credit supporters from the Ralliement National, left-wing trade unionists with socialist leanings, and a multitude of students. Half of the delegates were under the age of 30. The founding convention of the PQ on 11 Oct. 1968, unlike that of the MSA, proceeded harmoniously. The PQ\u2019s program would be similar to the one sketched out in the spring by the delegates of the MSA: French as the only official language, recognition of the rights of the minority, a unilateral declaration of independence, a presidential system, compulsory trade-union membership, an interventionist state that would yet respect free enterprise, territorial integrity, the recovery of Labrador, and withdrawal from military alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nBut before reaching the paradise of power, there was the desert to cross. Between 1966 and 1976, L\u00e9vesque led a rather Spartan existence. Until his personal defeat in the election of April 1970, he had drawn his salary as an mna. That summer he left Louise L\u2019Heureux and went to live with Corinne C\u00f4t\u00e9, a teacher from Alma. L\u00e9vesque could not rely on his mna pension since he was sending it to his wife, who was raising their three children. Fortunately, he had some income from his work as a journalist. Back in September 1966 the Montreal periodical Dimanche-Matin had commissioned him to write a weekly column, but he gave it up in 1969, shortly before the 1970 election. After his defeat in Laurier, Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al in turn made him an offer of $200 a week. L\u00e9vesque had always refused to take a salary as leader of the PQ, but in February 1976, after the ind\u00e9pendantiste Montreal daily Le Jour ceased publication, depriving him of his income as a columnist, the party paid him $18,000 a year.\n\nThe PQ solicited votes for the first time on 29 April 1970 in a provincial election dominated by the fear of separatism fanned by the new Liberal leader, Robert Bourassa*, and by the intervention of the federal Liberals, who published in Montreal, in their internal newsletter What\u2019s New?, a study purporting to show the benefits of federalism for the people of Quebec. The figures were so far-fetched, however, that Bourassa and Trudeau disowned the study. Bourassa\u2019s promise to create 100,000 jobs, a key theme in Quebec where there was a high level of unemployment, also weighed heavily in the outcome of the voting. Defeated in the riding of Laurier, L\u00e9vesque succeeded in getting only seven members elected, even though his party received 23.1 per cent of the votes. That year the October crisis proved disastrous for his political position. The FLQ had kidnapped James Richard Cross, a British diplomat, and Pierre Laporte*, the provincial minister of labour and manpower, as well as of immigration, who would be found murdered on 17 October. To overcome the FLQ, Trudeau, under pressure from the Bourassa government, toyed with the idea of proclaiming the War Measures Act. On 14 October, in collaboration with Claude Ryan*, the publisher of Le Devoir, L\u00e9vesque brought together leaders from different social spheres, including Louis Laberge*, president of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Travailleurs du Qu\u00e9bec, Alfred Rouleau, future president of the Desjardins movement, and sociologists Fernand Dumont* and Guy Rocher. The objective of the 16 signatories to a common declaration drawn up by L\u00e9vesque was to encourage the governments to abandon strong-arm tactics and negotiate with the kidnappers to save the lives of the hostages. Their appeal was not heeded, however. On 16 October Ottawa proclaimed the War Measures Act, giving it sweeping emergency powers [see Trudeau]. By the next day some 40 members of the PQ had been arrested. In L\u00e9vesque\u2019s view, this was an extreme and anti-democratic measure that violated the centuries-old British tradition of habeas corpus. Associated with the FLQ by its opponents, the PQ lost 45,000 members who would no longer risk describing themselves as \u201cp\u00e9quistes.\u201d\n\nRepudiated by public opinion, the PQ was a victim of illegal espionage by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. During the night of 8 Jan. 1973 RCMP agents broke into a building and stole the party\u2019s membership list in what has become known as Operation Ham, as would be disclosed in the reports of inquiries by Judge David C. McDonald (1979\u201381) in Ottawa and Commissioner Jean F. Keable (1981) in Quebec City. L\u00e9vesque would accuse the Trudeau government of wanting to take advantage of the extremes of FLQ terrorism to strike a death blow to his party.\n\nL\u00e9vesque\u2019s handicap at the polls was still the same: people were afraid of sovereignty. Having shifted to the PQ in May 1972, Claude Morin, who had been deputy minister of federal-provincial affairs and intergovernmental affairs in the administrations of Lesage, Johnson, Jean-Jacques Bertrand*, and Bourassa, persuaded L\u00e9vesque to hold a referendum before making any declaration of independence. But Premier Bourassa called a snap election before L\u00e9vesque had a chance to get the idea accepted by the followers of economist Jacques Parizeau, who favoured independence with no referendum and no obligatory association with the rest of Canada. On 29 Oct. 1973 the Liberals won a landslide victory. L\u00e9vesque, who ran in the riding of Dorion, suffered personal defeat for the second time and lost one of the seven members elected three years earlier. All was not doom and gloom, however. The sovereignist vote increased from 23.1 to 30.2 per cent, and reached nearly 40 per cent among francophones. Furthermore, the PQ became the official opposition, led by an influential new member, constitutional expert Jacques-Yvan Morin. The Liberal Party elected 102 members, thanks to a not-very-democratic voting system that gave 5.5 per cent of the seats to the party that had won 30.2 per cent of the popular vote.\n\nL\u00e9vesque wondered whether he was still the right man for the situation. He wanted to call it quits and do something else with his life. In Quebec City, his six National Assembly members were left on their own. Soon his lack of interest in the party led to grumbling. As the November 1974 convention drew near, he agreed, at the urgent request of his entourage, to stay at his post, but on his own terms. He was determined to bring to heel those who were eroding his authority by means of the debate on the need to hold a referendum before declaring independence. At the gathering, which has gone down in history as the \u201cstep-by-step\u201d convention (because of the idea of \u201c\u00e9tapisme\u201d attributed to Morin), L\u00e9vesque had the word \u201creferendum\u201d written into the program. In early September 1976 he put down the rebellion of mnas Robert Burns and Claude Charron, who were calling into question his leadership.\n\nWith peace restored, L\u00e9vesque began confidently and calmly to prepare for the fall\u2019s election campaign. He had turned 54 on 24 August. He seemed more relaxed, less aggressive. His love life had become more stable now that he was living with Corinne C\u00f4t\u00e9. For a pro-independence party, the prospects of coming to power had never been so good. L\u00e9vesque expected to win a minimum of 35 seats and, if luck was with him, to form a minority government. The proposal adopted at the 1974 convention \u2013 to hold a referendum conditional on the attitude of the federal government \u2013 now gave way to a clearer electoral promise: there would be a referendum before the end of the first term of office.\n\nL\u00e9vesque was facing a government worn down by six years in power and discredited by patronage, political interference, and conflicts of interest in the Quebec Liquor Corporation and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Exploitation des Loteries et Courses du Qu\u00e9bec (revealed by the commission of inquiry into organized crime). Bourassa was also facing accusations of nepotism. Moreover, the premier was deluding himself by thinking that he would achieve victory by using Ottawa as a whipping boy. When Trudeau had come to him in the spring seeking support for his plan to repatriate the British North America Act of 1867, Bourassa had refused. Trudeau had then threatened to proceed unilaterally, thereby giving Bourassa a pretext for calling an early election. Last of all, the fragility of the Liberal government was partly due also to the Official Language Act (also known as Bill 22), which, among other things, had proclaimed French as the official language of Quebec, but divided the English-speaking voters who traditionally supported the Liberals. Yet it was not so much the proclamation of French as the official language that had outraged anglophones, but rather the linguistic tests imposed on children who wanted to enrol in an English school. They were afraid that these tests would keep immigrants and francophones out of their schools. L\u00e9vesque, for his part, saw the act as an arbitrary and odious measure that opened the door to discrimination between different ethnic groups. Above all, Bill 22 did not deal realistically with the question of getting immigrants to acquire the French language.\n\nOn 15 November the PQ caucus increased from 6 mnas to 71 and the Liberal Party dropped from 97 to 26. To Claude Morin and some analysts, L\u00e9vesque owed his victory above all to having downplayed sovereignty during the campaign and having promised to hold a referendum. Be that as it may, his determination to introduce political transparency and good government (as the saying goes) also persuaded a majority of voters. L\u00e9vesque had accomplished the tour de force of not only rallying his customary electoral supporters \u2013 trade unionists, students, teachers, intellectuals, young people \u2013 but also making a breakthrough into circles that had previously rejected his message, such as small shopkeepers, mayors of villages and small towns, women, the elderly, farmers, and even military personnel. Unlike anglophones who had revived the moribund Union Nationale rather than cast their votes for the PQ, immigrants had proved much more receptive. History took an abrupt turn. For the first time, a party that proposed to break up confederation would form the government of Quebec. Prime Minister Trudeau, half-heartedly congratulating the winner, warned him that he would never negotiate the partition of Canada.\n\nL\u00e9vesque would hold power for two terms, 1976\u201381 and 1981\u201385. For support, he called on a team of 18 ministers, 5 of whom held two portfolios, with a total of 23 ministries. Some of them had impressive credentials and were graduates of elite schools: Jacques Parizeau (London School of Economics and Political Science), Jacques-Yvan Morin (Harvard University and University of Cambridge), Claude Morin (Columbia University), Yves B\u00e9rub\u00e9 (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and Bernard Landry (Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques de Paris). Others, like broadcaster Lise Payette, brought qualities such as celebrity status, vivacity, and charisma that were sometimes missing in those who shone by reason of their education and experience. L\u00e9vesque would need all these abilities to turn around both the financial management of the province and the economy. Public services were more costly in Quebec than anywhere else in Canada. A family of four in Quebec paid $1,000 more in taxes than a comparable family in the other provinces. The economic growth for his first year in power would be lower than that of the country as a whole, while unemployment would rise to 9.5 per cent. Far from being paralysed by these sombre prospects, the new government, on its election, set in motion a huge wave of reform harking back to that of the 1960s. These changes would radically alter Quebec society. First of all, L\u00e9vesque could finally achieve his goal of political transparency; he pushed it to the limit by banning secret electoral funds and replacing them in 1977 with a system of public financing for political parties. As the victim of a system that created an imbalance between a party\u2019s real strength and its representation in parliament, he began to redraw the electoral map, which gave up to six times as much weight to the rural vote as to the urban, and change the electoral system, which similarly created an imbalance between the percentage of votes and the number of seats. He introduced elements of proportional voting, but could not complete this last reform because of the solid opposition of his mnas. Relying on the public\u2019s hostility to proportional representation and feeling threatened by the complexity of proportional voting, most of them also saw such a reform as a source of political instability, which would make it difficult, for instance, to pass controversial bills. On 23 June 1978 L\u00e9vesque would as well put through the Referendum Act, which was to govern the holding of a referendum.\n\nDuring the election campaign, L\u00e9vesque had promised to make Quebec as French as Ontario was English. In his view, however, law and language were not a good match, as he had warned Premier Bourassa when the latter had proclaimed the Official Language Act in 1974. Moreover, he said openly that he found it humiliating to have to resort to legislation, since only a downtrodden and colonized people must brandish the law to impose their language. But the decline of French, especially in Montreal, the massive anglicization of immigrants, and the demographic and linguistic context of North America, where the ratio of French-speaking Quebecers to non-francophones was one to forty, threatened the survival of a French Quebec.\n\nIn L\u00e9vesque\u2019s opinion, it was not a question of scrapping the Official Language Act in order to give birth to a new \u201cMagna Carta\u201d of language for general edification. He simply wanted to modify it in order to give back to francophones a useful enjoyment of their language at work, in signage, in business, and in public administration, and to get immigrants to acquire the French language. But Camille Laurin*, the influential and persuasive minister of state for cultural development, acting on the advice of sociologists Rocher and Dumont, took him further than he wanted to go. Proclaimed and put into force on 26 Aug. 1977, the Charter of the French Language, commonly known as Bill 101, declared Quebec a unilingual society and excluded English from the legislature and courts in violation of article 133 of the Canadian constitution, which guarantees the use of both languages. (This part of the Quebec law would be struck down by the Supreme Court of Canada in December 1979.) Moreover, the law made English schools available only to children whose parents had studied in English in Quebec. This is the \u201cQuebec clause,\u201d as opposed to the \u201cCanada clause\u201d favoured by L\u00e9vesque, which would have opened English schools to the children of all English-speaking Canadians. According to Dr Laurin, on 1 April 1977, the day before he tabled his white paper in parliament, the premier carelessly remarked to him during an emotional t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate: \u201cI can\u2019t say that I like your law, doctor. I have to pass it because we are not free. I can\u2019t prevent immigrants from coming to our province, but if I do nothing, they will become anglicized and dispossess us. I have no choice. If we lived in a normal country, doctor, we wouldn\u2019t need your law.\u201d Though he finally accepted the Quebec clause, he did so also because he was gambling that the English-speaking provinces with a French-speaking minority would adopt the reciprocity he had offered them. Under this arrangement, anglophones from a province that granted its minority the same access to schools as was granted by Quebec to its English-speaking minority could enrol their children in English-language schools in Quebec. If this reciprocity were to be accepted by the English-speaking provinces, it would effectively cancel the Quebec clause. In cabinet, L\u00e9vesque could not oppose the bill\u2019s article on the language of instruction without running the risk of finding himself in the minority. This text \u2013 which would become the law that would have the greatest effect on the face of Quebec and the mentality of its people \u2013 enjoyed solid support among the public, party members and mnas, and in the cabinet. This was far from being the case among anglophones, more than 130,000 of whom would choose to emigrate between 1976 and 1981, mostly to Ontario. Similarly, motivated by the westward shift of their financial activity, a number of large companies, such as the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, a multinational that did 80 per cent of its business outside the province, would move to Toronto, giving Bill 101 as the reason.\n\nTo end Quebec\u2019s first-place standing for the greatest number of road accidents, the lowest compensation for claims, and the highest insurance premiums in Canada, and to correct a situation where one Quebec vehicle in five had no insurance, L\u00e9vesque introduced the system of public and compulsory automobile insurance advocated in 1974 in the Report of the committee of inquiry on automobile insurance. This study had been done under Jean-Louis Gauvin as chair and commissioned by the Bourassa government, which later shelved it. The Act to establish the R\u00e9gie de l\u2019Assurance Automobile du Qu\u00e9bec and the Automobile Insurance Act, both of which took effect in March 1978, were unpopular pieces of legislation. The complicated new system required a driver to carry two forms of insurance, a public one for personal injury regardless of liability (which some ministers complained would absolve drivers of responsibility), and a private one for property damage (which, it was believed, would further increase the cost). Moreover, the reform caused an outcry among lawyers and insurance agents close to the PQ, who saw their livelihood being taken away from them. Under pressure from lawyers, who were well represented in the cabinet, the government was divided. The legislation crossed the finish line only with L\u00e9vesque\u2019s decisive support for Lise Payette, the minister of consumers, cooperatives, and financial institutions.\n\nAccording to L\u00e9vesque and his minister of agriculture, Jean Garon, Ottawa was favouring the big grain and cattle farms in the western provinces, while confining Quebec to dairy farming. This policy stood in the way of L\u00e9vesque\u2019s determination to diversify Quebec agriculture to develop the food-processing industry and agricultural self-sufficiency. On 22 Dec. 1978, to curb financial speculation, he had the Act to preserve agricultural land proclaimed (which in its effects was retroactive to 9 November).\n\nAs well, Quebecers\u2019 entrepreneurship emerged in the economy. In 1978 Parizeau, the finance minister, abolished the eight per cent sales tax on everyday consumer goods to assist low-income families while also helping the vulnerable sectors of the economy \u2013 textiles, furniture, footwear, and clothing. In 1979 he introduced stock-savings plans to initiate Quebecers into the stock market and at the same time create a reserve of local capital for small and medium businesses. Along the same lines, the government set up the Program to Stimulate the Economy and Uphold Employment (1977), adopted a policy of preferential purchasing (1978), and published in 1979 a strategy for economic development, B\u00e2tir le Qu\u00e9bec\u2026.\n\nOn the social front, L\u00e9vesque brought in a long list of measures that showed the social-democratic orientation of his government: free medicine for the elderly (1977), the Youth Protection Act (1977), therapeutic abortion (1977), the Act to secure the handicapped in the exercise of their rights (1978), and the Act respecting child daycare (1979). On the labour front, the government had a law against strike-breaking passed (1977), promoted labour-management dialogue by organizing the economic summit at La Malbaie (1977), and had the Act respecting occupational health and safety given royal assent (1979). In the field of culture, in addition to the Charter of the French Language and the creation of maisons de la culture, the Act to incorporate the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de D\u00e9veloppement des Industries Culturelles was assented to in 1978. Justice minister Marc-Andr\u00e9 B\u00e9dard, for his part, dusted off and democratized the administration of justice, set up the Commission Qu\u00e9becoise des Lib\u00e9rations Conditionnelles, and instituted class-action suits that year. L\u00e9vesque also provided the province with a policy on scientific research (1980). To put an end to the grip of U.S. corporations on Quebec\u2019s asbestos, which was being sent out of the country to be processed, he tabled Bill 121, authorizing the government to nationalize the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asbestos Limit\u00e9e in 1978. Protracted judicial skirmishes with the American company began, which would go on until 1982. In the meantime, asbestos fibre would be declared carcinogenic, and the industry collapsed. The beautiful dream would cost the taxpayers $435 million.\n\nIn foreign policy, L\u00e9vesque pursued two main objectives. Following the example of premiers Lesage and Johnson, he sought to maximize Quebec\u2019s visibility in the world by developing more and more contacts with other countries, whose sympathy would be useful if ever the people of Quebec authorized him to form a new country. The second pillar of his foreign policy was based on his determination to deal directly, in his own name and without a federal chaperone, with foreign dignitaries and heads of state. This policy brought him into conflict with Ottawa, which was jealous of its international sovereignty, and occasionally led to embarrassing situations. In January 1977, at the Economic Club of New York, where only the Quebec fleur-de-lys flag was flown beside the star-spangled banner, L\u00e9vesque tried to reassure the 1,600 guests \u2013 mostly American moneylenders and investors \u2013 about the security of their investments in Quebec. Since he spent almost his entire speech drawing a bold parallel between the independence of Quebec and that of the American colonies 200 years earlier, it was a \u201cmonumental flop,\u201d as he would write in his memoirs. He made up for this failure in November of that year, during an equally sensational official visit to Paris. The French president, Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, and his prime minister, Raymond Barre, welcomed him with all the show of respect due a real head of state, and not like an ordinary provincial premier, as Ottawa had insisted. But Ottawa was less worried about the thickness of the red carpet than about L\u00e9vesque\u2019s determination to give Franco-Quebec dialogue a more political dimension. The creation of an annual summit meeting between the French prime minister and the premier of Quebec confirmed Canada\u2019s fears, especially since the prime ministers of France and Canada did not meet once a year. Besides, placed on the same footing as the prime minister of a sovereign country, with complete authority, L\u00e9vesque, an ordinary provincial leader, might raise topics that went beyond Quebec\u2019s jurisdiction. Ottawa would not rest until it had made Paris back down on the matter. And so, in February 1979, to lessen the impact of the first Franco-Quebec summit, which was held that year in Quebec City, Prime Minister Trudeau insisted that Barre should go to Ottawa first.\n\nThis visit gave L\u00e9vesque the opportunity to make clear his intentions with regard to Corinne C\u00f4t\u00e9. Their liaison had become public on the night of 5 Feb. 1977, when L\u00e9vesque, with Corinne in his car, had accidentally run over a homeless man lying in the street. In September 1978 he had obtained his divorce from Louise L\u2019Heureux. The presence of the young woman beside the premier of Quebec, on the occasion of a reception in honour of Barre and his wife, annoyed the French couple. In Paris a mistress is not among the invited guests. Power had not changed L\u00e9vesque in the slightest. Rebellious as ever, he sometimes refused to conform to the constraints that protocol placed on his office. He still smoked as much in front of the camera, and he wore short-sleeved shirts and, invariably, sports shoes, the eternal \u201cWallabees\u201d that amused the press. He smoothed things over by confiding to his guests that Corinne C\u00f4t\u00e9 was his fianc\u00e9e and they would be married in April \u2013 as indeed they were, at a private ceremony on 12 April 1979.\n\nIn this year preceding the referendum, however, L\u00e9vesque\u2019s greatest challenge was to convince a majority of Quebecers to follow him all the way to independence. It was the battle of his life. During the 1976 election campaign, he had promised to hold a referendum before the end of his first term of office. On 1 Nov. 1979, despite unfavourable polls, he tabled in the National Assembly the white paper on sovereignty-association, which offered the rest of Canada a new agreement between two peoples, politically sovereign, but economically associated: Qu\u00e9bec-Canada, a new deal: the Qu\u00e9bec government proposal for a new partnership between equals, sovereignty-association. The document emphasized both Quebecers\u2019 desire for autonomy and the deadlocked federal system, and it proposed to take back all powers and taxes within the framework of a new association, more economic than political, between two sovereign states. Provincial civil servants, who were more concerned about their working conditions, which they were in the process of negotiating, than about the outcome of the referendum, disrupted the event by singing O Canada before smashing windows and shutting the journalists in the press room. The situation became more complicated at a cabinet meeting on 19 Dec. 1979. The adoption of a complex and rather long referendum question created divisions among the ministers. The question included a request for a mandate to negotiate a new agreement with the rest of Canada, as well as the idea adopted at a convention the previous June of a second referendum (to consult the people on the results of discussions with the federal government following the first referendum). Some ministers, including Denis Lazure* and Lise Payette, went home early in the evening, convinced that the premier would get what he wanted, even at some cost to Parizeau. The finance minister\u2019s opposition to what he considered the bizarre idea of a second referendum was flagging as time went on. L\u00e9vesque had to use all his authority to bring him into line. At the National Assembly the next day, he seemed to be troubled by the premier\u2019s reading of the question. He hurried out of the room, convinced that the definitive wording was not the one accepted the day before. In fact, L\u00e9vesque had forgotten to inform him of some minor changes introduced afterwards by the lawyers. Being suspicious by nature, Parizeau had had immediate doubts, but revised his position after further consideration.\n\nL\u00e9vesque had foreseen everything but the return of his eternal political rival, Trudeau. The Liberal leader, who had been defeated by Charles Joseph Clark\u2019s Conservatives in the election of 22 May 1979, resurfaced in December after the Conservative government fell. On 18 Feb. 1980 Trudeau was re-elected, just in time for the referendum. On 20 June of the previous year L\u00e9vesque had reached a decision: the referendum would be held in the spring of 1980. He made this decision public the next day, but without specifying the date \u2013 20 May 1980 \u2013 which he would divulge to the National Assembly on 15 April 1980. On 4 March the leading lights of the government had begun a 35-hour parliamentary debate on the referendum question that went on until 20 March. The confrontation, which was won hands down by the government, gave the Yes camp a slight lead. Indeed, for the first and only time, according to an internal poll conducted by the party, the PQ speakers had more than 58 per cent of the votes, and Ryan\u2019s No camp just 12 per cent. Put at a disadvantage by subsequent negative polls, a strategy with no clear direction, an overly bureaucratic organization, and unmotivated party members, L\u00e9vesque\u2019s campaign did not get off the ground. Moreover, Lise Payette, minister of state for the status of women, made women angry when she compared Ryan\u2019s wife, Yvette, to a housewife living in the shadow of her husband. The \u201cYvette\u201d movement in support of the No side caught fire and crippled the sovereignists, who were also hard put to counter the campaign led by the federal minister of justice and attorney general, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, a campaign L\u00e9vesque considered illegal and immoral. The minister, without hesitation, disregarded the law on popular consultation, which, among other things, limited the spending of the two sides, and he had federal cheques being mailed out to Quebecers sent with slogans favourable to the federalist camp. The final blow came from Prime Minister Trudeau, who, in a few sentences and with a few promises, shattered L\u00e9vesque\u2019s dream. Since L\u00e9vesque had stumbled earlier by emphasizing Trudeau\u2019s middle name, \u201cElliott,\u201d which recalled his mother\u2019s Scottish ancestry (just as Trudeau himself had stumbled during the 1976 election by evoking the victory \u201cof the blood brothers\u201d to distinguish the francophones who had voted for the PQ from the anglophones and allophones who had supported the Liberals), the prime minister made a point of shouting out that his \u201cname is a Quebec name.\u201d On 14 May, shortly before the vote, Trudeau promised to resign if federalism was not renewed to the satisfaction of Quebecers. In so doing he gave the undecided voters a reason for voting No.\n\nOn 20 May L\u00e9vesque suffered the bitterest defeat of his political career. The surveys had left him no illusions, but he had hoped to win a majority of the francophone vote. He did not get it and had to be satisfied with a total of 40.4 per cent of the votes. He concluded that the people of Quebec were not yet ready for independence. It was hard for him to understand, however, that it was possible to say no to oneself. He was not asking for a mandate to separate, but for a mandate to negotiate a new agreement with Canada. Those around him would criticize him for having waited too long to hold the referendum, for having given his adversary, doubly decapitated by the departure of Bourassa and the defeat of Trudeau, a chance to recover. In the opinion of former premier Bourassa, the referendum was L\u00e9vesque\u2019s most serious political error, for he had held it knowing that he would lose, thereby opening the way for Trudeau, who was burning with desire to repatriate the constitution without taking account of the province\u2019s demands. In L\u00e9vesque\u2019s view, the referendum had at least given judicial legitimacy to Quebecers\u2019 right to self-determination. By participating in the popular consultation, Ottawa had accepted, at the international level, the idea that it was the people of Quebec who should determine their future, not Ottawa and not English-speaking Canada. Politically weakened and brought back to his role as a provincial premier, L\u00e9vesque put his struggle for a Quebec homeland on the back burner. He got down to the business of patching up the time-worn 1867 document, adopting the demands of his predecessors: equality between francophones and anglophones, constitutional recognition of Quebec\u2019s distinct character, and a new sharing of powers between Ottawa and the provinces.\n\nThe ball was now in the federalists\u2019 court, L\u00e9vesque had declared on the evening of his defeat. Trudeau caught it on the fly and invited him and the other premiers to join him in negotiating a new federalism. At the constitutional conference held in Ottawa in September 1980, the prime minister insisted on repatriating the constitution and enshrining within it a charter of rights and freedoms before really dealing with the actual question of the new sharing of powers demanded by a majority of the provinces. Matters came to an impasse, and to resolve it Trudeau threatened to proceed without the premiers\u2019 agreement. On 6 October he presented a motion in the House of Commons for a unilateral repatriation of the constitution, including in particular an amending formula that gave all provinces the right to oppose any change in the constitution they considered unacceptable. But this veto would be valid for only two years following repatriation, after which the provinces and Ottawa would have to agree on a new formula, to be worked out. On 12 Nov. 1980 L\u00e9vesque presented his own motion in the National Assembly, opposing the federal \u201cpower grab,\u201d which required unanimous agreement to be adopted. The opposition of Liberal leader Claude Ryan led to its defeat. This did not prevent L\u00e9vesque, in the course of the following winter, from building a common front against Ottawa, consisting of eight provinces, excepting only Ontario and New Brunswick, the two declared allies of the federal government. On 12 March 1981, in the midst of these negotiations, he decided to go to the people. His political acumen told him that the people of Quebec, worried by Trudeau\u2019s threats (as L\u00e9vesque\u2019s own polls showed), would elect him rather than Ryan, who had made the mistake of associating himself with the federal government in blocking the adoption of L\u00e9vesque\u2019s motion against unilateral repatriation. His slogan was \u201cWe must remain strong in Quebec.\u201d With the focus of the campaign on the accomplishments of his \u201cgood government,\u201d the election of 13 April 1981 took on the appearance of a plebiscite. The PQ won two-thirds of the seats. On 16 April the eight provinces reached agreement on a plan for constitutional reform, which they intended to submit to Trudeau. To facilitate the agreement, L\u00e9vesque had to give up Quebec\u2019s traditional right to a veto, in favour of the right to opt out and receive financial compensation.\n\nOn 28 September the Supreme Court of Canada, which in April had been called on for its opinion about the legality of unilateral repatriation, ruled partly in favour of Ottawa. Repatriation was legal, but would be un-constitutional in the \u201cconventional sense.\u201d There was an emergency session in Quebec City, where L\u00e9vesque put through, on 2 October, a motion of resistance which this time got Ryan\u2019s support. Early in November, along with cabinet ministers Allan Joseph MacEachen and Jean Chr\u00e9tien, as well as his personal advisers, Trudeau welcomed the provincial premiers to \u201cthe one last time\u201d conference in Ottawa. On his side, L\u00e9vesque was accompanied by Claude Morin, the man in charge of the Quebec strategy, and two ministers, Marc-Andr\u00e9 B\u00e9dard and Claude Charron. There were some who felt that this was not a winning team, that it should have included ministers with a more solid grasp of constitutional matters and federal-provincial relations, such as Jacques-Yvan Morin and Jacques Parizeau. Of the ten or so subjects discussed at the previous constitutional meetings, there were only three left: the repatriation of the constitution, the amending formula, and the charter of rights \u2013 Trudeau\u2019s three priorities. Brilliantly manipulated by Trudeau, L\u00e9vesque fell into the trap of a so-called Quebec-Canada alliance focused on the idea of an all-Canadian referendum on the constitution, something that the English-speaking provinces, who felt betrayed by L\u00e9vesque, wanted nothing to do with. Already showing cracks as a result of the Supreme Court decision and the desire of the premiers of the English-speaking provinces to reach an agreement with Ottawa, the united front of the provinces imploded. On the last morning of the conference, L\u00e9vesque was presented with the text of an agreement negotiated the evening before by three ministers, Chr\u00e9tien (for the federal government), Roy John Romanow (of Saskatchewan), and Roy McMurtry (of Ontario), for which they had previously obtained the approval of the seven other provincial premiers. It was now L\u00e9vesque\u2019s turn to feel betrayed by his former allies of the common front, whose nocturnal secret negotiations would go down in history as the \u201cnight of the long knives.\u201d While resigning himself to the inclusion of a \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause that would reduce the scope of the new constitution with respect to freedom of expression, religion, and language, Trudeau achieved his three main objectives. The right of francophones outside Quebec to have their own schools, \u201cwhere the number of those children so warrants,\u201d was stipulated in Article 23 of the new constitution. Anglophones coming to Quebec from other provinces would have access to English schools there, in violation of the Quebec clause of Bill 101, which granted this right only to anglophones from Quebec. But, unlike Ontario \u2013 whose French-speaking minority, while smaller in number than the English-speaking minority in Quebec, was nevertheless substantial \u2013 only Quebec had official bilingualism imposed on its parliament and courts, in keeping with Article 133 of the BNA Act, which was confirmed in the new constitution. To L\u00e9vesque, this was an injustice that would lead him to say that Trudeau had bartered institutional recognition of official bilingualism in Ontario for Premier William Grenville Davis\u2019s support for his plan of repatriation. Lastly, there was no recognition of Quebec as a distinct society in the constitution and no right of veto, but there was a right of opting out with no financial compensation.\n\nFor L\u00e9vesque, it was a total disaster. The text of the new constitution reduced the powers of the only French government in the federation without its consent and fell so far short of the historic demands of Quebec, which was now subject to the law of the strongest, that he refused to sign it. This meant that the second most populous province in Canada did not recognize the fundamental law of the country, despite being bound by it. On 2 Dec. 1981, the day on which the House of Commons passed the motion on the new constitution, L\u00e9vesque had the fleur-de-lys flown at half-mast at the parliament buildings. There were now indeed two Canadas, as Trudeau and L\u00e9vesque had just demonstrated.\n\nWorn down by his setbacks with the referendum, L\u00e9vesque found it difficult to come to terms with this new defeat. He became disillusioned and lost his grip in the final three years of his political career, during which he suffered blow after blow. Scarcely had he returned from the Ottawa summit when he learned that Claude Morin, the minister of intergovernmental affairs and the person mainly responsible for negotiations on the constitution, had taken money from the RCMP in exchange for information about the PQ. L\u00e9vesque would carry this secret with him to the grave. In the early 1980s a severe economic recession drove unemployment to new heights, a nasty shock for his government, which was struggling with a deficit of $700 million. He insisted that the unionized workers in the public sector, whose jobs were guaranteed and whose wages were higher than those in the private sector, do their share and give up some of their benefits. In June 1982, faced with the unionists\u2019 refusal, L\u00e9vesque secured royal assent to the Act respecting remuneration in the public sector, which imposed wage cuts. That meant war. In December he promulgated the Act respecting the conditions of employment in the public sector, which imposed retroactive wage cuts of 19.45 per cent. The province was paralyzed by an avalanche of illegal strikes, which was brought to an end in February 1983 by special legislation, the Act to ensure the resumption of services in the schools and colleges of the public sector. He let himself be guided by the general interest, but he thereby attacked his electoral base and divided his party.\n\nIn the summer of 1984 the leader of the federal Conservatives, Martin Brian Mulroney, talked about national reconciliation and promised to bring Quebec to the constitutional table if his party were elected. L\u00e9vesque saw this overture as the longed-for opportunity to get rid of the hated federal Liberals and especially as a chance to recover from his constitutional setback of November 1981. Now that the referendum had been lost, he saw no point in discussing sovereignty, at least for a while. It was still on the horizon, but would not be an issue in the next election, expected to be held in a year. He was ready to take the \u201cbeau risque\u201d (to borrow an expression from the title of a novel by Fran\u00e7ois Hertel) of federalism, about which he made the following comment in November 1984, in D\u00e9fis qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a PQ periodical published in Montreal: \u201cIt must be noted, after all, that we are not in a gulag!\u201d And so L\u00e9vesque accepted the outstretched hand of Mulroney, who had become prime minister on 4 September, and he declared a moratorium on the issue of sovereignty, which tore his government apart. In November 1984 two of the original warhorses, the most influential ministers in the cabinet, Parizeau and Laurin, resigned. Convinced that their leader had lost faith in the cause, five other ministers \u2013 Gilbert Paquette, Denise Leblanc-Bantey, Jacques L\u00e9onard, Louise Harel, and Denis Lazure, and two backbenchers \u2013 Pierre de Bellefeuille and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Proulx \u2013 followed suit.\n\nThese defections undermined L\u00e9vesque\u2019s authority and led him to behave erratically. He fell into a depression. In January 1985, in severe psychological distress, he had to be hospitalized against his will, in the interests of state security. The man was ill. At 62 years of age and worn out, he appeared to the youngest of his ministers and mnas, who spent the entire spring openly challenging his leadership, to be finished. L\u00e9vesque would cling to power until June. On 20 March he took advantage of the spring session to put a motion recognizing the rights of aboriginals through the National Assembly. This issue had been dear to him since the 1960s, and once he became premier he had made it his personal responsibility. Six years earlier, in December 1978, he had created a historic precedent by convening a meeting in Quebec City between the provincial government and the chiefs and representatives of 40 Quebec bands, with a view to initiating a rapprochement between whites and native people.\n\nThe L\u00e9vesque government\u2019s major laws were passed mainly during his first term of office. Among the most important ones from the second term were minister Jean Garon\u2019s Bill 48, which affirmed Quebec\u2019s full sovereignty over the management of fishing in the Gulf of St Lawrence, and Bill 37, which defined a new framework for negotiations in the public sector, so that the province would not be on the brink of the abyss every time government employees renewed their collective agreements. These bills were passed in June 1984 and June 1985 respectively.\n\nOn 20 June 1985, 25 years after his political debut in the Lesage government, L\u00e9vesque made up his mind to write his letter of resignation as leader of the PQ. On the same day he sent out to the media a straightforward communiqu\u00e9 announcing his resignation as premier. On 29 September, two days after the painful farewell celebration the party held for him, he gave up his riding of Taillon. He was now just an ordinary citizen. His young successor, Pierre Marc Johnson, would not have a long career, either as premier or as leader of the PQ. In the election of December 1985 he was defeated by Bourassa. Two years later, isolated within a party that answered more and more to the Parizeau faction, he too would have to step down as leader. Two short years of retirement gave L\u00e9vesque just the time he needed to take up journalism again and to publish his memoirs, whose success was balm to his wounds. On 1 Nov. 1987 his heart, which he had always refused to take care of, suffered a devastating coronary. He was 65 years old. Everywhere in Quebec, and even in English Canada, there was unanimous agreement: a giant of Canadian and Quebec politics had died. From Davis, the former premier of Ontario, who had clashed with him, to Edgar Peter Lougheed, the former premier of Alberta, who admired him, all recognized that his actions and his challenge to federalism had forced English Canada to look at Quebec\u2019s place in the federation in a new light. More than that, as some historians have pointed out, he had contributed, with his rival Trudeau, to a complete redefinition of the Canadian political landscape. But by an irony of history, in shaking up Canada he had also strengthened it, as Romanow, Chr\u00e9tien\u2019s alter ego during the fateful night of the long knives, pointed out.\n\nThe legacy of L\u00e9vesque is diverse and associated with many great moments in the history of Quebec. As a journalist with Radio-Canada, he helped stir the interest of Quebec society in the great international questions, in a way broadening its horizons. Having become a politician during the Quiet Revolution, he was one of the driving forces for the changes that enabled Quebec to modernize and become open to the world. He made new standards an integral part of politics \u2013 honest politics \u2013 not only as a minister in Lesage\u2019s cabinet, but as premier. He rid French-speaking Quebecers of their complexes and gave them confidence in their ability by nationalizing electricity and building Hydro-Quebec.\n\nIn founding the PQ, L\u00e9vesque created a new and different party, fully democratic, unlike most others, and it aroused astonishment outside the province. In doing so, he introduced a concern for democracy into the pro-independence movement, and formulated a definition of Quebec nationalism that was less chauvinistic, less inward looking, as well as more dynamic and aggressive. As an indirect result, he brought about an affirmation of Canadian nationalism that was more open to the reality of Quebec and more coherent. With Bill 101, he gave French the priority in Quebec to which it was entitled, while at the same time protecting the educational rights of the minority. And finally, in the realm of political theory, he conceived the notion of sovereignty-association, which was gradually accepted, bringing a strong political credibility to the idea of Quebec independence.\n\nRen\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque did not achieve his grand dream of giving his compatriots a new homeland. This was no doubt the most striking failure of his political career. He lost the referendum of May 1980, had a constitution forced on him, and gave up the traditional right of veto, three events that weakened Quebec\u2019s political position within confederation. At the time of his death, Quebecers were still Canadians, but the francophone majority no longer saw themselves as the inconsequential people of legend, inward looking and speaking a disparaged and marginalized language. As a journalist, a Liberal cabinet minister, and a sovereignist premier, by his words and deeds he liberated French-speaking Quebecers from their feeling of inferiority and gave them a shot of adrenaline, so that some day, as he predicted on the evening of his defeat in the referendum, they would keep their rendezvous with history. \u201cI never thought I could be so proud to be Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois as I am this evening.\u2026 We are not an insignificant people. We are perhaps something like a great people.\u201d These famous words, spoken off the cuff in the euphoria of his victory on 15 Nov. 1976, revealed his political commitment, enabling those at the bottom who spoke French to move up in society, as his relatives and close friends recalled. But at the same time, he noted in his memoirs that Quebecers were probably the only people to have \u201crefused such a chance to acquire full power over themselves peacefully and democratically.\u201d Nonetheless, the epitaph written for him by poet F\u00e9lix Leclerc gives a meaning to his legacy, which is not measured solely in reforms and laws. \u201cThe first page of the true, beautiful history of Quebec has just ended.\u2026 From now on, he belongs on the short list of the liberators of people.\u201d\n\nPierre Godin"}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/rene-levesque", "page_content": "\\u00a9 Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hudon.

L\u00e9vesque founded the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, whose main objective was Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty (Canapress). PreviousNext\n\nRen\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, premier of Qu\u00e9bec 1976-85, politician, journalist, nationalist (born 24 Aug 1922 in Campbellton, NB; died 1 November 1987 in Montr\u00e9al, QC). A prominent member of Jean Lesage's Liberal Cabinet during the Quiet Revolution, L\u00e9vesque later founded the Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ), eventually bringing it to power in 1976. The PQ's main objective was Qu\u00e9bec independence, and for 15 years L\u00e9vesque was the leading champion of that ideal \u2014 holding and losing the province's first referendum on sovereignty in 1980.\n\nGasp\u00e9 Childhood\n\nL\u00e9vesque grew up in the remote, coastal town of New Carlisle, among the fishermen and farmers of the Gasp\u00e9 peninsula. Because there was no hospital there in 1922, he was born in nearby Campbellton, New Brunswick, the eldest child of Dominique L\u00e9vesque, a prominent lawyer, and Diane Dionne. Although the L\u00e9vesques were well-to-do, poverty was dire in the Gasp\u00e9 at that time. Ren\u00e9 became aware at a young age that most of the French Canadians were poorer, with smaller homes and more wretched schools, than the English Canadian families \u2014 descendants of Loyalists who had fled the American Revolution \u2014 who were the self-appointed elites of the region.\n\nA bright student who impressed his Jesuit teachers, L\u00e9vesque resolved early on at the S\u00e9minaire de Gasp\u00e9 that he was destined to be a leader. He idolized his father, who introduced him to politics, and to French and English literature \u2014 giving the boy a bilingual upbringing. When L\u00e9vesque was 14, however, his father died in hospital at the age of 48. His mother quickly remarried, the family relocated to Qu\u00e9bec City, and L\u00e9vesque drifted away from both his family and his studies.\n\nExpelled from the Coll\u00e8ge des J\u00e9suites Saint Charles Garnier for low marks, he finished his formal schooling at the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec and enrolled in the law school at Universit\u00e9 Laval, but gave up on his studies before obtaining a degree.\n\nJournalism\n\nL\u00e9vesque had discovered radio journalism in 1938, his last summer in New Carlisle. In Qu\u00e9bec City he worked at CBV, a regional Radio-Canada station. When the Second World War broke out, he was keen to get into the action, not as a soldier but as a war correspondent. Radio-Canada refused to send him, so in 1944 L\u00e9vesque found a position in London with the French section of the United States government service, Voice of America \u2014 thereby avoiding conscription by the Canadian military. He didn't get to the front lines until February 1945, joining the American armies as they crossed the Rhine and swept through the devastated remains of Germany. He was among the first US correspondents to see the horrors of the Dachau concentration camp following its liberation.\n\nThe war instilled in L\u00e9vesque a fondness for Americans (versus English Canadians), and a deep awareness of the barbarism that can flow from the extremes of nationalism. It wasn't enough to erase his own nationalist impulses, but it did temper them; he was committed throughout his life to democracy.\n\nAfter the war L\u00e9vesque returned to Radio-Canada, becoming an announcer for La voix du Canada, a news program broadcast out of Montr\u00e9al to French-speaking countries around the world. He quickly established himself as an engaging and widely-followed foreign newsman, reporting from the Korean War in 1951 and the Soviet Union in 1955. From 1956 he hosted the television series \"Point de mire\" (Focal Point) and became one of Qu\u00e9bec's most influential TV commentators. Short, balding and chain-smoking, L\u00e9vesque lacked the good looks for this emerging visual medium, but his intelligence and wit, and his ability to explain world events to a domestic audience, enabled him to become one of Qu\u00e9bec's first TV stars.\n\nIn 1947, L\u00e9vesque married Louise L'Heureux, his fianc\u00e9e from before the war, with whom he wouldhave two sons and a daughter. Surrounded by admirers in the broadcasting world, L\u00e9vesque wasn't a faithful husband, and the couple would divorce in 1978.\n\nIn 1959, L\u00e9vesque became actively involved in a strike by Radio-Canada producers, who wanted to form a union. He was dismayed by the indifference of the Diefenbaker government in Ottawa, and of his English CBC colleagues, towards the strikers' goals, which only hardened his views towards English Canada and fuelled his political aspirations. He decided journalism wasn't enough \u2014 it was time to stop covering the world, and start changing it instead.\n\nLesage Cabinet\n\nL\u00e9vesque joined Jean Lesage's Liberals in the provincial election of 1960, becoming a Member of the Legislative Assembly for Montr\u00e9al and helping to defeat the old Union nationale government. It was the beginning of the Quiet Revolution, and L\u00e9vesque became one Lesage's most popular and energetic Cabinet ministers \u2014 helping to modernize Qu\u00e9bec, to encourage its French-speaking majority to become \"masters in our own house,\" and to help ease the province away from the oppressive influence of the Roman Catholic clergy.\n\nAfter a brief stint as minister of water resources and public works, in which he fought corruption in the civil service, L\u00e9vesque was appointed minister of natural resources in 1961. He became point-man for the controversial but ultimately successful effort to nationalize the province's private electric utilities and fold them into what became the energy colossus of Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec. If Francophone Qu\u00e9becers didn't own or control big business interests in their province, L\u00e9vesque insisted, they would at least control its vast natural resources, via their government.\n\nParti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\n\nIn 1966, the Lesage government was defeated and L\u00e9vesque \u2014 increasingly nationalistic, and critical of his party's relations with the federal government \u2014 quit the Liberals the following year to found the Mouvement souverainet\u00e9-association, which in October 1968 became the Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. The move was hardly surprising. Through the 1960s, even as a Liberal minister, L\u00e9vesque had made his views on independence increasingly clear, telling the Anglophone media in Canada that he wouldn't be upset if Qu\u00e9bec separated. At the 1967 Qu\u00e9bec Liberal Party convention he had even tabled an incendiary resolution, largely unsupported by other delegates, titled \"A sovereign Quebec within a Canadian economic union.\" Meanwhile, he grew increasingly antagonistic with Pierre Trudeau, who entered federal politics in 1965 advocating a very different vision.\n\nHaving managed to unite the various groups promoting independence and a new political status for Qu\u00e9bec, L\u00e9vesque's party won 23 % of the vote in the 1970 provincial elections \u2014 although he himself failed to win a seat. Then the October Crisis erupted, and Trudeau, now prime minister, invoked the War Measures Act. L\u00e9vesque joined a coalition of prominent Qu\u00e9becers in condemning what they saw as Ottawa's anti-democratic response to the crisis. At the same time, L\u00e9vesque and his friends failed to unequivocally condemn the terror kidnappings of the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ) and the group's subsequent murder of Pierre Laporte. This allowed the PQ's critics to publicly equate the party with the FLQ, costing the PQ considerable support.\n\nIn the 1973 provincial election the Liberals won a landslide victory, and L\u00e9vesque once again failed to win himself a seat. The PQ, however, managed to become the official Opposition.\n\nPQ Comes to Power\n\nIn the next election, in 1976, L\u00e9vesque and his party faced off against the now-unpopular Liberal regime of Robert Bourassa, weary after years in power and beset by scandal and accusations of nepotism. L\u00e9vesque promised good government. He also downplayed the PQ's essential goal \u2014 sovereignty \u2014 while reassuring Qu\u00e9becers that a PQ government would commit to holding a referendum on the issue first, rather than declaring sovereignty unilaterally. The PQ won a majority of 71 seats, including one for L\u00e9vesque, who became the province's 23rd premier. He headed the first Qu\u00e9bec government committed to breaking up Confederation. The rest of Canada was stunned.\n\nDuring its first term, the new government passed several progressive measures concerning automobile insurance, rezoning of agricultural lands and the abolition of secret electoral funding. One of the most important and controversial pieces of legislation was Bill 101, the Charter of the French Language, which formalized the status of French as the official language of Qu\u00e9bec. Proclaimed lawin 1977, Bill 101 excluded English from the provincial legislature and courts, and restricted access to English schools to anyone other than children whose parents had attended English schools in Qu\u00e9bec. French schooling became compulsory for English-speaking immigrants, even those from other Canadian provinces.\n\nAlthough strongly supported by the public and the PQ, the law triggered an exodus of more than 130,000 Anglophones from the province between 1976 and 1981 . As well, a number of Montr\u00e9al-based companies, including Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, relocated their head offices to Toronto. In the ensuing years, court rulings would strike down many of the law's measures as contrary to the Constitution, including the ban on English in the legislature and courts. Eventually, children whose parents had attended English schools elsewhere in Canada, were allowed into English schools in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n1980 Referendum\n\nIn the fall of 1979, as time was running out on his government's mandate, L\u00e9vesque finally introduced in the National Assembly a plan for sovereignty-association \u2014 a politically independent Qu\u00e9bec, still economically tied to Canada. A referendum on the question was scheduled for 20 May 1980, only months after the defeat of Joe Clark's Conservatives in Ottawa, and the return to power of L\u00e9vesque's nemesis Pierre Trudeau.\n\nAfter an emotional campaign led on the \"non\" side by Liberal Opposition leader Claude Ryan and federal Cabinet minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien (with key support from Trudeau), and on the \"oui\" side by L\u00e9vesque and his ministers, the sovereigntists won only 40 percent of the vote, failing to capture even a majority of the Francophone vote. It was the hardest defeat of L\u00e9vesque's career. If there was any consolation, L\u00e9vesque believed the vote had at least legitimized the right of Qu\u00e9becers to determine their own future regarding Confederation. Ottawa had recognized that fact through its active participation in the campaign.\n\nConstitution Battle\n\nAgainst all expectations, the PQ was re-elected in 1981, with L\u00e9vesque heading his second majority government. The party may have been helped at the polls by the emergence of new battle lines pitting L\u00e9vesque and other provincial premiers against Trudeau, who had announced his intention to repatriate the Constitution from Britain and to proceed unilaterally if the provinces opposed him.\n\nTrudeau had made the vague promise, during the 1980 referendum campaign, of \"renewing\" the Constitution. Now his government was proposing new, centralized federal powers over the economy, a constitutionally-entrenched Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and a new constitutional amending formula. After months of political debate and grandstanding among Trudeau, L\u00e9vesque and the other premiers, the First Ministers, as they were called, assembled in Ottawa in November, 1981, in a final bid to settle their differences.\n\nL\u00e9vesque was one of several powerful and strong-willed premiers (along with Alberta's Peter Lougheed) \u2014 together comprising eight provinces, or the Gang of Eight \u2014 who opposed Trudeau's plans and had fought them through the courts. But huddled together in Ottawa that November, the seven English-speaking premiers in the coalition were won-over by the promise of a \"notwithstanding clause\" in the new Charter \u2014 limiting its power over provincial authority. The compromise was not enough for L\u00e9vesque, who had also insisted on constitutional recognition of Qu\u00e9bec as a \"distinct society,\" and on a constitutional veto for Qu\u00e9bec. He accused his fellow premiers of abandoning \"Qu\u00e9bec at the moment of crisis.\"\n\nWith the agreement of nine provinces, Trudeau pressed ahead. The repatriated Constitution was signed by Queen Elizabeth in the spring of 1982 \u2014 with the support of all the premiers except L\u00e9vesque, whose government represented the second-most populous province in the country. It was a detail that would bedevil the country and its First Ministers for years to come.\n\nFinal Years in Office\n\nL\u00e9vesque returned to the National Assembly to face the hard task of governing. Confronted with economic recession and spiralling provincial deficits, his government met with considerable opposition and public disapproval, including illegal public-sector union strikes, when it attempted to reduce spending to solve its grave financial problems.\n\nThere was also turmoil inside the PQ and growing doubts about L\u00e9vesque's leadership. In 1984, a party crisis erupted when L\u00e9vesque announced his intention of not fighting the next election on the issue of independence, while maintaining sovereignty-association as the party's official raison d'\u00eatre. Several important ministers resigned in protest, but the party reaffirmed L\u00e9vesque's leadership at a special convention in January 1985. Still, exhausted by years of struggle \u2014 and the defeat of his fondest political goals \u2014 L\u00e9vesque, at 62, fell into depression and was even hospitalized against his will. In June 1985 he resigned as premier.\n\nLegacy\n\nL\u00e9vesque enjoyed two years of retirement, before his heart gave out on 1 November, 1987. In that time he wrote his memoirs, which proved hugely popular. Upon his death, he was remembered across the country, by friends and foes alike, as a giant of Canadian politics.\n\nL\u00e9vesque's mark on Qu\u00e9bec, and Canada, is as indelible as any leader that province has produced: as a journalist he opened the minds of Francophone Qu\u00e9becers and awakened them to the wider world; he was a central figure of the Quiet Revolution; a creator of the energy powerhouse that became Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec; founder of the PQ and leader of Qu\u00e9bec's first openly separatist government; the angry, intransigent torch-bearer of the \"distinct society\" ideal, who refused to endorse the 1982 Constitution, leaving an open wound in the federation that festers still.\n\nThrough it all, L\u00e9vesque acknowledged that whatever injustices Qu\u00e9becers suffered inside Confederation, Canada was still a free and decent country. \"Canada's federal system,\" he once said, \"is not excessively oppressive or anything like a gulag.\" He was never the most ardent nationalist or separatist of his time, yet he fanned the flames of nationalist sentiment in pursuit of his aims. His insistence on wanting to break up the nation, in spite of the Canadian virtues he admired, are what made him such a perplexing \u2014 and often hated \u2014 figure in the minds of English-speaking Canadians, both inside Qu\u00e9bec, and elsewhere."}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/member-of-parliament", "page_content": "What do Members of Parliament Do?\n\nPolicymaking is the domain of cabinet, its ministers and the senior public service. As a group, MPs have less affect on policy formation. Some claim a strong voice in caucus and in committees. Part of an MP\u2019s representative role is responding to the grievances of constituents. MPs are elected to represent the interests of the people in their ridings, where they maintain an office. As representatives MPs propose, debate, and vote on legislation. They engage in committee work; speak on matters of local, regional and national importance in the House of Commons (and during caucus meetings); and ask questions of the prime minister and of cabinet ministers when Parliament is in session. They also review government spending estimates and vote on federal budgets.\n\nRoles in the House of Commons\n\nMembers of Parliament occupy different roles and levels of influence in government. Members can be assigned or elected to a variety of positions. These include speaker, house leader, party whip, committee chair, cabinet minister or opposition critic. MPs are paid public servants whose annual salary, as of March 2023, starts at $189,500. Members with additional responsibilities (including the prime minister and the positions listed above) earn higher salaries. They also receive additional perks such as a car allowance. Housing is provided to both the prime minister (24 Sussex Drive) and the leader of the Opposition (Stornoway).\n\nPrime Minister\n\nThe prime minister is the head of the federal government. He or she is also an elected member of Parliament. In the party system, the leader of the party with the most support in the House of Commons normally becomes prime minister. People are not specifically elected to the position. Party leaders can become prime minister even if they are not an MP. For example, John Turner spent most of his term as prime minister outside the Commons. However, convention would urge them to seek a seat in a general election or a by-election.\n\nThe prime minister sets policy direction, manages government, directs and appoints cabinet, meets with foreign delegations, and answers questions \u2014 from opposition members and sometimes from backbenchers in his or her party \u2014 when Parliament is in session. The prime minister and cabinet must maintain the support (confidence) of a majority of MPs in the house to govern.\n\nCabinet Ministers\n\nCertain MPs are appointed to cabinet, the committee of ministers that holds executive power. Cabinet ministers are typically from the party holding the most seats in the House of Commons. Most ministers are the formal head of one or more government department. Those departments often include safety, health, employment, defence, environment, Indigenous and northern affairs, natural resources, economic development, immigration, agriculture, transportation, tourism, foreign affairs, justice, intergovernmental affairs and finance, among others. Ministers set departmental priorities. They draft public policy, serve on committees, and propose legislation.\n\nOpposition Critics\n\nIn the House of Commons, opposition parties form \u201cshadow cabinets,\u201d which mirror cabinet. These shadow ministers (generally referred to as opposition critics) hold the government to account. They criticize cabinet, offer alternate policy ideas, and convey their party\u2019s position and message.\n\nBackbenchers\n\nMembers who are not in cabinet are known as backbenchers. This is because they historically sat on benches in the back of Parliament. The main work for all backbenchers is to provide services to constituents. They are also involved in policy making with their party caucus. They can also serve on committees reviewing legislation.\n\nRepresentation\n\nThere are currently 338 seats in the House of Commons. The seats are distributed equitably among the provinces and territories. The number of seats is allocated by a procedure known as redistribution. It occurs every 10 years, after a census in a year ending in \u201c1,\u201d such as 2011. (This is known as a \u201cdecennial census.\u201d) The 2021 federal election was the last to take place with the current allocation of 338 seats. A new distribution of seats \u2014 with a total of 343 in the House of Commons \u2014 will be in effect for the next election.\n\nElected Members of Parliament\n\nAny Canadian citizen who is at least 18 years old on election day can run for office. Virtually all MPs are elected as a member of a political party. A small minority campaign or sit as independents.\n\nMPs generally possess a high level of education. After the 2015 election, 227 MPs had bachelor\u2019s degrees, 97 had master\u2019s degrees and 14 had PhDs. Many are elected to serve in the federal government after serving in provincial, territorial or municipal government. Many others enter politics from the private sector. Common professions include careers in business, law, consultancy, teaching and journalism.\n\nFollowing the 2021 election, 70 per cent of MPs were men. Thirty per cent were women \u2014 a record high. Most MPs were also middle-aged (in their 40s and 50s). Their careers are usually short-lived \u2014 eight years, or two terms on average \u2014 due to shifting electoral behaviour.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nEnfranchised women in Canada first gained the right to run for federal office on 7 July 1919. (See Women\u2019s Suffrage in Canada.) In the 1921 general federal election, Agnes Campbell Macphail became the first woman elected to Parliament. She remained the only female MP in the House of Commons until Martha Louise Black was elected in 1935.\n\nDiversity in the House of Commons\n\nIn 2015, 54 Indigenous candidates ran in the federal election. A record 10 Indigenous MPs were elected to the House of Commons. This was up from seven in 2011. In the 2019 federal election, 62 Indigenous candidates ran for office. Of that number, 10 (four First Nations, four M\u00e9tis and two Inuit) were elected. In the 2021 election, a record high 77 Indigenous candidates ran for office, including 23 First Nations. As in 2019, 10 were elected.\n\nIn 2015, visible minority groups represented 12.9 per cent of all candidates from the six main parties. (See Liberal Party of Canada, Conservative Party of Canada, New Democratic Party, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, Green Party of Canada, People\u2019s Party of Canada.) In 2019, that proportion increased to 15.7 per cent. The total number of visible minority MPs elected increased from 47 (13.9 per cent) in 2015 to 51 (15.1 per cent) in 2019 and to 53 (15.7 per cent) in 2021.\n\nThe number of women candidates who ran in federal elections increased from 533 in 2015 to 597 in 2019. In total, 98 women were sworn into the House of Commons after winning seats in the 2019 federal election. This was 10 more than in the 2015 federal election. In 2019, 830 men ran as candidates and 240 were elected. As of October 2022, women accounted for 30 per cent of seats in the Commons, compared to 70 per cent of seats held by men.\n\nAt least 87 candidates from the LGBTQ+ community ran in the 2019 federal election. Of this number, four openly LGBTQ+ people were elected to the House of Commons, representing fewer than five per cent of LGBTQ+ candidates.\n\nSee also Parliament; Canadian Party System; Canadian Electoral System; Prime Minister of Canada; Cabinet; Opposition Party; Leader of the Opposition."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Parti-Quebecois", "page_content": "Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, English Quebec Party, provincial Canadian political party founded in 1968 by journalist Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque and other French Canadian separatists in the largely French-speaking province of Quebec.\n\nIn 1968 L\u00e9vesque merged his Mouvement Souverainet\u00e9-Association (Sovereignty-Association Movement)\u2014which advocated Quebec sovereignty in a new kind of looser association of Canadian provinces\u2014with other separatist groups to form the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Unsuccessful in the Quebec provincial elections of 1970 and 1973, the party in 1976 won 71 of 110 seats in the provincial National Assembly, and L\u00e9vesque was elected premier. The following year the Assembly decreed French the only official language of government and business in Quebec, and in 1980 L\u00e9vesque organized a referendum seeking approval for the provincial government to negotiate a new status and relationship with the rest of Canada. The referendum failed, however, with only two-fifths of Quebecers supporting sovereignty-association talks; those voting against the proposal included a small majority of French speakers.\n\nThe party maintained its dominance in Quebec\u2019s provincial assembly at the beginning of the 1980s, but membership declined thereafter as separatist fervour waned. In 1985 the independence plank was removed from the party\u2019s platform, and, following a series of defections and by-election defeats that year, L\u00e9vesque resigned; the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was swept from power in December. By 1987 the party was again controlled by militant separatists, and, when there was a resurgence in support for Quebec separatism in the 1990s, the party\u2019s hopes revived. It had informal ties with the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a Quebec separatist party that captured most of the province\u2019s seats in the House of Commons in the 1993 federal elections and served as the country\u2019s official opposition party from 1993 to 1997.\n\nThe Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois won 77 out of 125 seats in the 1994 provincial election and formed a government under its leader, Jacques Parizeau. In 1995 the party held another referendum seeking popular approval to negotiate Quebec\u2019s secession from Canada; again the proposal was rejected, though this time it lost by only 1 percent of the vote. Lucien Bouchard, the leader of the federal Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and Canada\u2019s former ambassador to France, became head of the party in 1996 and led it to victory in the 1998 provincial elections. Bouchard resigned as premier of Quebec in 2001 and was replaced as leader of the party and as premier of Quebec by Bernard Landry. In the provincial elections of 2003 the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was reduced to 45 seats and was ousted from power by the Liberals. In 2007 the party suffered its worst result since 1973, winning only 36 seats and falling into third place. In 2012 the party gained a plurality of seats in the National Assembly, enabling it to form a minority government under the leadership of Pauline Marois.\n\nIn March 2014, after only 18 months as head of the Quebec government, Marois, hoping to obtain majority rule, dissolved the legislature and called a new election. The Liberal Party, however, won a landslide victory on April 7, 2014, handing the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois its worst defeat in terms of seats won since 1970."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/House-of-Commons-British-government", "page_content": "House of Commons , also called Commons , popularly elected legislative body of the bicameral British Parliament .

Each constituency returns a single member.\n\nThe House of Lords was initially the more powerful of the two houses, but over the centuries its powers gradually diminished . By the late 17th century, the House of Commons had gained the sole right to initiate taxation measures. The House of Lords retained its veto power over bills passed by the Commons, however, and in 1832 the only recourse of the Liberal Party government was to threaten to flood the House of Lords with new Liberal peers in order to prevent it from rejecting that government\u2019s Reform Bill . Eighty years later the same threat was used, again by a Liberal government, to compel the Lords to approve the Parliament Act of 1911 , which enabled a majority of the House of Commons to override the Lords\u2019 rejection of a bill. Under this act, the House of Lords lost the power to delay legislation passed by the Commons for the raising and spending of revenue; it also lost the power to delay other legislation for a period beyond two years (reduced in 1949 to one year). The act also reduced the maximum duration of a parliamentary session to five years.\n\nThe origins of the House of Commons date from the second half of the 13th century, when landholders and other property owners in the counties and towns began sending representatives to Parliament to present grievances and petitions to the king and to accept commitments to the payment of taxes. In the 14th century the knights and burgesses chosen as representatives (i.e., the commons) began sitting in a separate chamber, or \u201chouse,\u201d from that used by the nobles and high clergy (i.e., the lords).\n\nFunctions and operation\n\nLearn about the history and traditions of the House of Commons Chamber, also the functions of its members See all videos for this article\n\nThe House of Commons is the effective legislative authority in Great Britain. It alone has the right to impose taxes and to vote money to, or withhold it from, the various public departments and services. The House of Lords has only infrequently held up major legislation passed by the Commons, and the British sovereign almost automatically provides the Royal Assent to any bill passed. Indeed, the last bill to be rejected by a monarch was the Scottish Militia Bill of 1707, which was vetoed by Queen Anne. Acts of Parliament are not subject to judicial review.\n\nThe passage of legislation is the House of Commons\u2019 primary function. Almost all legislation proceeds from the majority party in the Commons, which forms the government and the cabinet; the latter is composed of senior ministers chosen by, and belonging to the party of, the prime minister, nearly all of whom serve in the House of Commons. The government\u2019s main work in the Commons is to implement the legislative program on which it fought and won the last general election.\n\nAt the beginning of each new session of Parliament, the House elects from its members the speaker, who presides over and regulates debates and rules on points of order and members\u2019 conduct. The speaker does not participate in debates and votes only in order to break a tie, a case that compels the speaker to vote in favour of the status quo. The calling of members to speak in debate is entirely in the speaker\u2019s hands, the main concern being to ensure that a variety of points of view is heard. By a convention of the constitution not established until the 20th century, the prime minister is always a member of the House of Commons, instead of a member of either house. The government party appoints the leader of the House of Commons, who manages the party\u2019s legislative program. Except for occasional independents, members of both the government and opposition parties are under the control of party management within the Commons, whose discipline\u2014particularly over voting\u2014is exercised by members called \u201cwhips.\u201d\n\nThe tradition that a bill must be read three times in the Commons (and also in the Lords) before it can be voted on is based on the need to allow members adequate time to investigate the principles on which the bill is based and the details of its provisions. The first reading is purely formal, but the second reading provides the occasion for debate on the principles involved. The bill then goes into committee, where it is examined clause by clause. Most bills are sent to standing committees, each of which deals with bills belonging to a particular range of topics, with the committees reflecting in their makeup the respective strength of parties in the House. Having examined the bill, the committee then reports back to the House, and after further amendments may have been proposed in the course of more debate, the bill is read a third time and is then voted on. In addition to bills proposed by the government, a limited number of bills sponsored by individual members are considered by the House each session.\n\nBeginning in 1999, power over a number of matters\u2014including health, education, housing, transportation, the environment, and agriculture\u2014was devolved from the British Parliament to the newly established Scottish Parliament, National Assembly of Wales, and (somewhat later) Northern Ireland Assembly. That reallocation of legislative responsibilities raised the issue of whether MPs from Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland should continue to vote on measures directed at England only. This so-called West Lothian question (so named because it was first posed in 1977 by the anti-devolutionist MP from West Lothian, Tam Dalyell) was addressed in 2015 by controversial legislation that established a new set of procedures known as English Votes for English Laws (EVEL). New stages were introduced into the standard lawmaking procedure during which legislation that was determined to affect England only was to be considered and voted upon by MPs from English constituencies (who were effectively granted veto power) before moving on to consideration by the House of Commons as a whole. (Similarly, legislation aimed at England and Wales only was to be addressed first by English and Welsh MPs only.) When it was not clear whether a measure was an England-only matter, the speaker of the House of Commons was tasked with making that determination.\n\nAside from passing legislation, the most important business of the full House is the question period, which is held on a regular basis. During this period, members can require government ministers to answer questions regarding their departments; it thus provides the opposition with an opportunity to attack government policy and to raise issues on which the government may be thought to have been negligent. It also generates regular policy debates between the prime minister and the leader of the opposition. These exchanges have been made more important by their public broadcast, first by radio in 1978, and then by television in 1989.\n\nMembers of the House of Commons must be 18 years of age or older. Peers of England, Scotland, or the United Kingdom may not be elected to the House of Commons, though Irish peers may be. Certain clergy, judicial officers, members of the armed forces, police officers, and civil servants are also ineligible for election. Women became eligible under an act of 1918. Members were paid beginning in 1911."}, {"url": "https://www.ourcommons.ca/en/", "page_content": "333\n\nMembers In office\n\nLiberal : 156 Conservative : 115 Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois : 32 NDP : 25 Independent : 3 Green Party : 2\n\n268\n\nBills Presented\n\nAn idea to make a new law or change an existing law starts out as a bill.\n\n366\n\nVotes Recorded\n\nCompilation of recorded votes, where the names of those voting for and against a motion are registered.\n\n1528\n\nPetitions Presented\n\nPetitions are an easy way to participate in Canada's democracy.\n\n303\n\nCommittee Reports Presented\n\nCommittees are small groups of parliamentarians created to perform key tasks, such as presenting reports to the House."}, {"url": "https://www.ourcommons.ca/en/about-the-house", "page_content": "About the House\n\nThe House Administration supports Members and the Board of Internal Economy as their needs evolve by offering efficient, accountable and non-partisan support, while also preserving the collective memory and traditions of the institution.\n\nBoard of Internal Economy The governing body of the House of Commons on financial and administrative matters.
