The play was directed by Roy Morton.\n\n\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nWho is Jeannine Riley?\n\nJeannine Brooke Riley was born on 1 October 1940, in Madera, California USA, and is an actress, perhaps still best known for her role as Billie Jo Bradley in the series entitled \u201cPetticoat Junction\u201d, appearing in the first two seasons of the show during the mid-\u201860s.\n\nThe Riches of Jeannine Riley\n\nHow rich is Jeannine Riley? As of late-2018, sources estimate a net worth that is at $4 million, earned through a successful career in acting. She\u2019s also appeared in numerous other television shows and feature films throughout her career, and as she continues her endeavors even well into her \u201870s, it is expected that her wealth will also continue to increase.\n\nCareer Beginnings\n\nWhile virtually no information is available about Jeannine\u2019s early life, it is known that she developed an interest in acting at a young age. She started her career in the early 1960s, appearing in small or uncredited roles in projects such as \u201cFive Finger Exercise\u201d. In 1963, she was cast in the sitcom \u201cPetticoat Junction\u201d in the role of Billie Jo Bradley, set in the Shady Rest Hotel run by Kate Bradley, her three daughters and her uncle. The series was created after the success of \u201cThe Beverly Hillbillies\u201d and the success of this show led to the spin-off entitled \u201cGreen Acres\u201d.\n\nShe stayed with the show until 1965, then decided to leave the series to pursue more film work, replaced by Gunila Hutton and later Meredith MacRae during the latter seasons. Jeannine then started to do film work in the late 1960s, appearing in \u201cThe Big Mouth\u201d as Bambi Berman, filmed in San Diego and featuring Frank De Vol as an on-screen narrator.\n\nThe 3 original Bradley Sisters\u2026Betty Jo {Linda Kaye Henning}, Bobbi Jo {Pat Woodell}, and Billie Jo {Jeannine Riley.} Posted by Debbie Spivey on Saturday, January 26, 2019\n\nCareer Prominence\n\nThe following year Riley was cast in \u201cFever Heat\u201d, which was directed by Russell S. Doughten and starring alongside Nick Adams and Norman Alden. In 1969 she was cast in the film \u201cThe Comic\u201d, co-written and co-produced by Carl Reiner and starring Dick Van Dyke, Michele Lee and Mickey Rooney in a film inspired by the end of the silent film era.\n\nAfter that she returned to television, as she was cast in a regular role in the comedy variety series entitled \u201cHee Haw\u201d during the same year, which was set in fictional rural Kornfield Kounty, and inspired by \u201cRowan & Martin\u2019s Laugh-In\u201d. The show centered on rural culture and country music, with hosts Buck Owens as well as Roy Clark, but would often feature scantily clad women in stereotypical farmer\u2019s daughters attire, who came to be known as the Hee Haw Honeys. She stayed with the show for three years, and then joined another show in \u201cDusty\u2019s Trail\u201d, in which she played Lulu McQueen, a western-theme take-off of Ginger Grant from \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island\u201d, also starring Forrest Tucker and Bob Denver.\n\nLater Career\n\nOver the next few years, Jeannine had small roles in television shows such as \u201cThe Wild Wild West\u201d, \u201cRoute 66\u201d, and \u201cThe Man from U.N.C.L.E.\u201d She then featured in the film \u201cElectra Glide in Blue\u201d, which starred Robert Blake as a motorcycle cop alongside Billy \u201cGreen\u201d Bush, and based on the Harley-Davidson Electra Glide motorcycle used by traffic police. During the same year, she had an uncredited role in \u201cThe Outfit\u201d, actually appearing as a prostitute in an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Richard Stark under the pseudonym Donald E. Westlake.\n\nAs the years progressed, Jeannine took fewer roles; she was a part of the 1980s project entitled \u201cLone Star Bar & Grill\u201d as Arlene, and one of her last projects was the 1991 film entitled \u201cTimebomb\u201d, which starred Michael Biehn, Richard Jordan and Patsy Kensit.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nFor her personal life, it is known that Riley married Gary Groom in 1965 but their marriage ended in divorce in 1972. She married once more in 1974 to Irwin Radnitz but it was also a marriage that ended in divorce. There are no reported children from her marriages.\n\nSince retiring from acting work, very little information has been shared about her. One of the reasons is due to the fact that she does not have any accounts on major social media websites. In 2016, a book was released entitled \u201cX Child Stars: Where Are They Now\u201d, written by Kathy Garver and Fred Ascher, which contained a profile of her along with her career. Many sources speculate that since ending her acting career, she focused more on other endeavors, and likely another marriage and a family, but there is no evidence to confirm these speculations.\n\nFacts # Fact 1 Jeannine Riley and Steve Ihnat co-starred together in the play, \"The Fourposter\", put on by the Sherman Oaks Playhouse for two months, from mid-April to mid-August, 1953.

So he buys a farm, sight unseen, and moves there to live off the land, much to the chagrin of his socialite wife, Lisa. The collision of small-town life and Lisa's sophisticated ways - she insists on wearing full-length gowns and ostentatious jewelry, even on the farm - provide much of the humor in the show. Two to Four pigs were used on the TV show each year for \"Arnold the Pig\". The first one was male and all the others were female.Eva Gabor was married 5 times and once said, \"Marriage is too interesting an experiment to be tried only once.\"Bea Benaderet had starring roles in several other TV shows including \"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\", \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", and \"Petticoat Junction\". She also starred as Mrs. Atterbury on the, \"My Favorite Husband Radio Show\" starring Lucille Ball. Lucille Ball actually wanted Bea to play the role of Ethel Mertz on her series, \"I Love Lucy\" but Bea couldn't do it due to her contract with the \"George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\". Unfortunately, Bea died during Green Acres' time on the air. They explained her disappearance by saying that she went off to visit her sister. In her final \"appearance\" her character was actually played by a \"stand-in\" that was only shown from the back and had no lines.Everyone who watched Green Acres remembers Arnold the pig but there were many other named animals on the show. At one point or another during the show's run the Douglases had a cown named Eleanor, a duck named Drobney, and a dog named Mignon. Mr. Haney also had a dog named Cynthia who just happened to be in love with Arnold the Pig!Eddie Albert was a circus trapeze flier before becoming a stage and radio actor.The idea for this TV show was conceived from the 1950s radio program, \"Granby's Green Acres\" but the TV show is considered a \"spin-off\" of the series, \"Petticoat Junction\". Several of the Green Acres characters had appeared on Petticoat Junction before Green Acres ever aired. Both series took place in and near the same town. Characters from both series often showed up on the other series. There was also an exchanging of characters between Green Acres and \"The Beverly Hillbillies\"."}, {"url": "https://www.tvobscurities.com/2009/08/q-and-a-green-acres-spin-offs/", "page_content": "I get a lot of e-mails from people asking me about television shows, made-for-TV movies or miniseries they remember from years or decades past. I try to answer each question as best I can. Every now and then I like to dig through my inbox and pull out a few choice e-mails to answer here at Television Obscurities for everyone to read. Keep reading for today\u2019s questions and answers.\n\nIt appears, based solely on information from TV.com (here and here) as well as the Internet Movie Database, that the final two episodes of Green Acres were indeed backdoor pilots for proposed spin-offs. The first, \u201cHawaiian Honeymoon\u201d (originally broadcast March 16th, 1971) saw Oliver and Lisa Douglas heading to Hawaii for a fifth honeymoon. Trouble arises when another couple are accidentally also booked in the honeymoon suite. Visitors to the hotel, operated by a man and his college-age daughter, would have provided the humor in the suggested spin-off.\n\nThe final episode of Green Acres provided the second attempt. \u201cThe Ex-Secretary\u201d (originally broadcast April 28th, 1971) is described above by K11j527. It starred Elaine Joyce as Carol Rush, former secretary to Oliver Douglas (Eddie Albert\u2019s character), as she tries to keep her boss (played by Richard Deacon) from getting taken in by a con man. Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor had only limited scenes in the episode. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t find any contemporary sources that indicate either of these episodes were backdoor pilots. However, it does seem plausible.\n\nGiven the amount of time needed to plot an episode, write a script, film it and finish post-production, the fact that two episodes of the final season of Green Acres were actually backdoor pilots suggests that the producers were aware that the show was going to be cancelled at the end of the 1970-1971 season. Perhaps they saw the tide turning against so-called rural sitcoms.\n\nIf anyone can shed light on these two episodes and confirm that they actually were backdoor pilots, please post in the comments."}, {"url": "https://ctva.biz/US/Comedy/GreenAcres.htm", "page_content": "ctva\n\nComedy Search\n\nCTVA US Comedy - \"Green Acres\" (Filmways/CBS)(1965-71) Eddie Albert & Eva Gabor\n\nCTVA\n\nThe Classic TV Archive - US Comedy Series\n\nThe Beverly Hillbillies (1962-71) Petticoat Junction (1963-70) Green Acres (1965-71)\n\nGreen Acres (1965-71)\n\nEpisode Guide compiled by The Classic TV Archive\n\nreferences:\n\nLibrary of Congress (telnet://locis.loc.gov)\n\nInternet Movie Database (http:/www.us.imdm.com)\n\nGreen Acres (season 1) (CBS) (1965-1966)\n\nGreen Acres (season 2) (CBS) (1966-1967)\n\nGreen Acres (season 3) (CBS) (1967-1968)\n\nGreen Acres (season 4) (CBS) (1968-1969)\n\nGreen Acres (season 5) (CBS) (1969-1970)\n\nGreen Acres (season 6) (CBS) (1970-1971)\n\n-----------\n\nGREEN ACRES\n\n-----------\n\nFilmways Television production\n\nfor\n\nCBS (Wednesdays 9:00 pm EST)(seasons 1-3, 1965-68)\n\nCBS (Wednesdays 9:30 pm EST)(season 4, 1968-69)\n\nCBS (Saturdays 9:00pm EST)(season 5, 1969-70)\n\nCBS (Tuesdays 8:00pm EST)(season 6, 1970-71)\n\nProduced by Paul Henning / Created by Jay Sommers\n\n\n\nUS Comedy series 1965-71 170 episodes x 30 min color (6 seasons)\n\nstarring\n\nEddie Albert as Oliver Wendell Douglas\n\nEva Gabor as Lisa Douglas\n\nco-starring\n\nPat Buttram as Mr. Haney (1965-1971)\n\nTom Lester as Eb Dawson (1965-1971)\n\nAlvy Moore as Hank Kimball (1965-1971)\n\nHank Patterson as Fred Ziffel (1965-1971)\n\nBarbara Pepper as Dris Ziffel (1965-1969)\n\nFran Ryan as Dris Ziffel (1969-1970)\n\nFrank Cady as Sam Drucker (1965-1971)\n\nKay E.

It's really no wonder that it's remained pretty popular, because there really is something to the idea. No matter how much of a self-professed city-slicker someone is, there's still something undeniably inviting about the prospect of living somewhere with fresh air, infinite greenery, more than a few animals, and fresh veg right from the garden ... especially post-2020.

According to Sitcom Queens, the show was based on a radio show \u2014 also created by show writer Jay Sommers \u2014 that debuted in 1950.

The folksiness of the Tuesday night show, often an overpowering breeze, is expected to be counterbalanced by the airs of Miss Gabor and the grins of Mr. Albert.\n\nDuring the last few years, Albert has been on the road entertaining with his guitar. coming home for a few weeks to guest star on series like Rawhide.\u201d \u201cDr. Kildare\u201d and \u201cVoyage to the Bottom of The Sea.\u201d\n\nThe freelance actor\u2019s life isn\u2019t what it\u2019s cracked up to be, says Eddie. \u201cYou come home and you take parts you might normally turn down, just because you\u2019re in town for a few days. Even when you\u2019re out fishing for four days, you wonder what\u2019s going on in the studios.\u201d\n\nSo, when Paul Henning and Jay Sommers came to Eddie with \u201cGreen Acres,\u201d the freelance actor turned respectable and signed. \u2018Do you know what doing a series means?\u201d Albert went on. \u201cAfter a season\u2019s filming, I\u2019ll be free to do other things like travel from March through June. Who else gets four months off a year? Not a college professor, or a lawyer or a freelance actor. Only series performers.\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m trying to think of projects for those four free months that will take me far away.\u201d\n\nEddie wants to take his guitar, visit Russia and do a show on it. With a camera, he\u2019d like to go down the Nile, the Rhine, the Danube and the Amazon. As the star of a successful TV series, Albert would have the name to encourage backers for such projects.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to go skin diving on the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, or visit the Easter Island,\u201d the dreamer continued. \u201cI tell you there\u2019s nothing like seeing the world on an expense account.\u201d\n\nMeet Green Acres\u2019 Eve Gabor\n\nQuad-City Times (Davenport, Iowa) November 5, 1965\n\nHOLLYWOOD \u2014 There was an air of quiet contentment on the \u201cGreen Acres\u201d stage five at General Service Studio. Clad in a handsome gown, Eva Gabor nibbled on cold chicken, cheese and a pear, while Eddie Albert dug in the Gabor hamper for his lunch of chicken provided by Eva\u2019s cook.\n\n\u201cChicken every day this week,\u201d said Albert, working on a wing. \u201cWhy all the necks, Eva?\u201d\n\nEva wouldn\u2019t rise to the bait. \u201cTake a nap darling, or you\u2019ll be grumpy,\u201d she said in a wifely tone.\n\nStars Albert and Gabor gre old friends, and on the set treat each other like an affectionate married couple. Miss Gabor pats, kisses and feeds her co-star, and even takes Yoga exercises with Albert in the Gabor tradition of keeping their men happy.\n\n\u2018Today, we are having a letdown,\u201d said Eva. \u201cIt is like the day after the opening night in the theater. The latest ratings came out this morning and we are up high. Our show is a success. I tell you that is a nice feeling. There is nothing like success to keep you from getting bored.\u201d\n\nOn a two \u2013 day notice Miss Gabor left her New York home and husband, Richard Brown, Wall Street broker who now commutes to Hollywood, to play the role of Lisa Douglas, the city-loving, sophisticated wife of Oliver Wendell Douglas, the New York lawyer who wants to take up farming.\n\nNone of Eva\u2019s relatives were enthusiastic about the idea, but the youngest Gabor came anyway, and has found herself in a runaway folksy hit, a far cry from the well-established Gabor image.\n\nThe Gabor accent, an opposite from the country folk drawlin\u2019 which prevails on the CBS series, hasn\u2019t been tampered with. \u2018The thicker the accent, the stronger the character,\u201d says Albert with approval.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand an accent really,\u201d said Eva. \u201cBut I can\u2019t do anything with mine. I tried for years to get rid of it and gave it up.\u201d\n\nThe Gabor Hungarian accent seems crystal clear to most Americans, noted Eva. \u2018Even our writers are beginning to talk Ifke me.\u201d But she has trouble with some words. When Eva says car it sounds like cow.\n\n\u201cLast winter in Puerto Rico I got into trouble with those two words,\u201d Eva explained. \u201cWhile driving down the road I hit a cow and called in to report the accident. Naturally, I was misunderstood, and the whole police force came out under the impression I had struck a car. I am not crazy about my accent.\u201d\n\nThe writers see more in Eva than just a handsome, perfumed woman who walks through scenes and kisses her husband now and then. \u201cThey\u2019re making me an acrobat,\u201d says she. \u201cGoose feathers are thrown at me. I\u2019m doused in a shower, and this morning I was standing on a bucket for hours.\u201d She\u2019s not just window dressing.\n\nMiss Gabor takes all this without shrieking. \u201cGabors are supposed to be temperamental, but I\u2019m not,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI have good discipline because I have been in the theater a long time, and I know you don\u2019t fiddle around. Besides, I love this show.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/green-acres-could-a-reboot-still-happen.html/", "page_content": "It seems that just about every TV show or movie is getting a reboot or spinoff. Perhaps the most successful and long-running example is the Star Wars franchise. In an era where everything old is new again, fans of Green Acres are wondering if the show could be rebooted for a whole new generation.\n\n\u2018Green Acres\u2019 was a hit comedy set in rural America\n\nCheer up, Lisa! Tonight is the series premiere of Green Acres on MeTV as we start the series all over again! Tune in at 9:30P | 8:30C! pic.twitter.com/1QBG6VEwlO \u2014 MeTV (@MeTV) September 14, 2020\n\nAccording to IMDb, Green Acres aired from 1965 to 1971 for a total of 170 episodes. The show starred Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor, who played the roles of Oliver Wendell Douglas and Lisa Douglas. The couple left behind their hectic New York City life for farming in rural Hooterville. Lisa Douglas\u2019s elegance and lack of domestic skills provided much of the comedy.\n\nJust like the town of Springfield in The Simpsons, viewers never found out exactly where Hooterville was. The ambiguity of setting the show in an \u201cevery man\u2019s\u201d small town only added to its appeal.\n\nTwo \u2018Green Acres\u2019 spinoffs fell flat\n\nBy the early 1970s, CBS was also airing two other rural-themed shows, Petticoat Junction and The Beverly Hillbillies. The network was eager to change its image and wanted to start featuring shows in urban and contemporary settings. All three shows were canceled as part of CBS\u2019s \u201crural purge.\u201d Viewers didn\u2019t know it at the time, but the last two episodes of Green Acres were actually pilots for spinoff shows.\n\nAccording to MeTV, the second to the last episode had the Douglases going to Hawaii for a \u201cfifth honeymoon.\u201d This episode prominently featured the hotel owner and his daughter. CBS hoped to capitalize on the exotic location and younger cast members. The working title for this pilot was called Pam, after the hotel owner\u2019s daughter.\n\nAnd in the very last episode of Green Acres, Oliver Douglas writes a letter to his former secretary, Carol. The rest of the episode\u2019s plot centers around Carol, for whom that pilot was named after. There is a very good reason why TV viewers don\u2019t remember Pam or Carol. Neither pilot took off, and the two spinoff shows were canceled right along with Green Acres.\n\n\u2018Return to Green Acres\u2019\n\nBy 1990, Green Acres had been off the air for almost 20 years. Fans, as well as a new generation, were ready to be reintroduced to the show they so dearly loved. According to IMDb, Return to Green Acres aired on May 18, 1990. The made for TV movie starred many of the same characters, including Eva Gabor, Eddie Albert, and Tom Lester.\n\nAnd Paris Hilton recently revealed that Green Acres influenced The Simple Life. Prior to filming, Hilton says she was told, \u201cWe want this to be Green Acres meets Clueless and we want you to play into the character of you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nWhat does the future hold for \u2018Green Acres\u2019 fans?\n\nIn recent years, both Mental Floss and Deadline have reported that both a feature film and a Broadway play were in the works. However, nothing has come to fruition yet and the future of these projects haven\u2019t been made public.\n\nInsider recently reported on upcoming reboots, remakes, and spin-offs, but sadly, Green Acres isn\u2019t one of them. And if there is a reboot of Green Acres, it would have to feature an all-new cast. In April 2020, the show\u2019s last surviving cast member, Tom Lester, who played farmhand Eb Dawson, passed away.\n\nLuckily, Green Acres\u2019 fans can still watch episodes on Prime Video and MeTV."}, {"url": "http://classic-tv.com/shows/green-acres", "page_content": "Green Acres is a sitcom starring Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor about a couple that moves from New York City to a country farm.

So he buys a farm, sight unseen, and moves there to live off the land, much to the chagrin of his socialite wife, Lisa. The collision of small-town life and Lisa's sophisticated ways - she insists on wearing full-length gowns and ostentatious jewelry, even on the farm - provide much of the humor in the show. Two to Four pigs were used on the TV show each year for \"Arnold the Pig\". The first one was male and all the others were female.Eva Gabor was married 5 times and once said, \"Marriage is too interesting an experiment to be tried only once.\"Bea Benaderet had starring roles in several other TV shows including \"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\", \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", and \"Petticoat Junction\". She also starred as Mrs. Atterbury on the, \"My Favorite Husband Radio Show\" starring Lucille Ball. Lucille Ball actually wanted Bea to play the role of Ethel Mertz on her series, \"I Love Lucy\" but Bea couldn't do it due to her contract with the \"George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\". Unfortunately, Bea died during Green Acres' time on the air. They explained her disappearance by saying that she went off to visit her sister. In her final \"appearance\" her character was actually played by a \"stand-in\" that was only shown from the back and had no lines.Everyone who watched Green Acres remembers Arnold the pig but there were many other named animals on the show. At one point or another during the show's run the Douglases had a cown named Eleanor, a duck named Drobney, and a dog named Mignon. Mr. Haney also had a dog named Cynthia who just happened to be in love with Arnold the Pig!Eddie Albert was a circus trapeze flier before becoming a stage and radio actor.The idea for this TV show was conceived from the 1950s radio program, \"Granby's Green Acres\" but the TV show is considered a \"spin-off\" of the series, \"Petticoat Junction\". Several of the Green Acres characters had appeared on Petticoat Junction before Green Acres ever aired. Both series took place in and near the same town. Characters from both series often showed up on the other series. There was also an exchanging of characters between Green Acres and \"The Beverly Hillbillies\"."}]}
