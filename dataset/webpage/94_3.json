In 1812 he wrote to Sagen that the landscape artists he most wished to emulate were Ruisdahl and Everdingen, and for that reason he was studying \u201cnature above all,\u201d Dahl's artistic program was, then, already in place: he would become a part of the great landscape tradition, but he would also be as faithful as possible to nature itself.\n\nDahl held that a landscape painting should not just depict a specific view, but should also say something about the land's nature and character \u2013 the greatness of its past and the life and work of its current inhabitants. The mood was often idyllic, often melancholy. When he added snow to a landscape he painted in the summer, it was not to show the light and colors of snow; it was to use snow as a symbol of death. As one critic has put it, \u201cUnlike the radically Romantic works also appearing at the time, Dahl softens his landscape, introducing elements of genre painting by imbuing it with anecdotal materials: In the background a wisp of smoke rises from a cabin, perhaps the home of the hunter on the snow-covered field.\u201d Thanks to Sagen's recommendations and to his own personal charm, Dahl soon gained access to the leading social circles in Copenhagen.\n\nDahl took part in annual art exhibitions in Copenhagen beginning in 1812, but his real breakthrough came in 1815, when he exhibited no fewer than 13 paintings. Prince Christian Frederik of Denmark, who developed an early interest in Dahl's artistic genius and saw to it that his works were purchased for the royal collection, became a lifelong friend and patron of the artist.\n\nIn 1816 C. W. Eckersberg returned from abroad with his paintings of Roman settings; Dahl was impressed at once, and they became good friends and exchanged pictures. Dahl's 1817 painting Den Store Kro i Fredensborg marked the real beginning of his lifelong production of oil paintings depicting natural subjects.\n\nAfter his success in Copenhagen, Dahl realized that he wanted to live as an independent, self-supporting artist. One challenge facing him was that the academic preference of the day was for historical paintings with moral messages. Landscapes were considered the lowest kind of art, and perhaps even not as art at all, but as a purely mechanical imitation of nature. The only landscapes that could be considered art, according to the academy, were ideal, imaginary landscapes in pastoral or heroic styles. In accordance with this reigning taste, Dahl attempted to give his Danish themes a certain atmospheric character in order to lift them up above what was considered a merely commercial level. But at the same time it was his deepest wish to provide a more faithful picture of Norwegian nature than were offered by the old-fashioned, dry paintings of Haas and Lorentzen. This desire was partly motivated by homesickness and patriotism, but it was also suited to the public taste of the day for \u201cpicturesque\u201d works.\n\nDahl traveled to Dresden in September 1818. He arrived with introductions to the city's leading citizens and to major artists such as Caspar David Friedrich, who helped him establish himself there and became his close friend. One critic has written: \u201cFriedrich's still, meticulously executed landscapes - products of an art informed by his strict Protestant upbringing and a seeking for the divine in nature - were justifiably famous by the time he and Dahl became acquainted. We are able to see his Two Men Contemplating the Moon (1819), which ranks among his greatest works, and features two \"R\u00fcckfiguren,\" or figures seen from behind, solemnly and companionably gazing at a young sickle moon from the edge of an old forest. 'Greifswald in Moonlight' (1816\u201317) depicts the artist's birthplace in Pomerania, on the Baltic coast: bathed in an even, gauzy moonlight, the ancient university town assumes an almost ethereal appearance.\u201d\n\nFriedrich was fourteen years Dahl's elder and an established artist, but the two found in each other a shared love for nature and a shared enthusiasm for a way of depicting nature that was based on the study of nature itself rather than on the academic cliches that they both profoundly despised. One writer has put it this way: \u201cA warm and sociable character, he soon met and became friendly with the more introverted and reclusive Friedrich, recording how they once walked together in the park of the Gr\u00f6sser Garten among 'many lovely trees of different kinds, and the moon looked beautiful behind the dark fir trees.'\u201d\n\nTogether with Friedrich and Carl Gustav Carus, Dahl would become one of the Dresden painters of the period who exerted a decisive influence on German Romantic painting.\n\nIn Dresden, as in Copenhagen, Dahl traveled around the area to draw subjects that could be of use to him in larger works that would be painted later in his atelier. He wrote to Prince Christian Frederik in 1818 that \u201cmost of all I am representing nature in all its freedom and wildness.\u201d Dahl found enough material in the Dresden area to supply motifs for his paintings, but he continued to paint imaginary landscapes with forests, mountains, and waterfalls. One such painting, completed in 1819, entitled Norsk fjellandskap med elv (Mountainous Norwegian landscape with river\u201d), garnered great attention among younger artists who considered the striking natural quality of the painting a breath of fresh air on Dresden's stagnant art scene. Another monumental waterfall painting, completed the next year, was lavished with praised by the critic for Kunstblatt who said that Dahl was greater than Jacob van Ruisdael. Dahl was accepted into the Dresden academy in 1820.\n\nPrince Christian Frederik wrote to Dahl in 1820 from Italy and invited him to join him at the Gulf of Naples. Dahl was at the time courting a young woman named Emilie von Bloch, but felt he should take the prince up on his offer, so he married Emilie quickly and traveled to Italy the next day. He ended up spending 10 months in Italy. Though he missed his bride, the sojourn was a decisive factor in his artistic development. It was in Italy, with its strong southern light, that Dahl's art truly flowered. It forced him to see nature plain, without the mediation of the old masters' renderings of light and color.\n\nDahl went to Rome in February 1821. He spent a great deal of time visiting museums, meeting other artists, and painting pictures to sell. In addition to painting sights in Rome and pictures of the Gulf of Naples, he painted landscapes inspired by the mountains of Norway. Dahl said that not until he was in Rome did he truly appreciate Norwegian nature. In June 1821 Dahl returned north to Emilie and a quiet life of family and painting.\n\nDahl quickly became a member of Dresden's leading circles of poets, artists, and scientists, among them the archeologist C. A. B\u00f6ttiger, publisher of Artistisches Notizenblatt, who ran a major article on Dahl in 1822.\n\nAs a member of the academy, Dahl always dedicated his time to young artists who sought him out. In 1824 he and Friedrich were named \u201cextraordinary professors\u201d who had no chair but who received a regular salary. In 1823 Dahl moved in with Friedrich, so that many of his students, such as Knud Baade, Peder Balke, and Thomas Fearnley, were equally influenced by both artists. \u201cWell before their meeting,\u201d writes one critic, \u201cDahl had also painted a number of 'moonlights' and, travelling in Europe, he was in the Bay of Naples in 1821 when Mount Vesuvius was active. Here he painted 'Boats on the Beach Near Naples', where fishing crafts lie at anchor in the calm, shimmering waters with the twin peaks of the mountain smoking and flaming behind. Predictably, after his close association with Friedrich began\u2014the two families shared a house in Dresden from 1823\u2014he was considerably influenced by him, but his own more spontaneous and painterly style soon prevailed. Clients sometimes commissioned pictures from them both, a tranquil coastal scene by Friedrich to pair with a more stormy subject from Dahl.\u201d\n\nDahl never formed a \u201cschool\u201d around himself, but rather preferred for his students to cultivate their own styles; it was against his principles and his respect for artistic freedom to try to inhibit his students' individuality. It was this impulse toward individuality that later caused him to turn down an offer of a permanent chair at the academy \u2013 he didn't want to feel compelled to show up for class when he was busy working on a painting.\n\nDahl continued his studies of nature in the area around Dresden when he had the time, or on longer trips which provided him with themes for his paintings. But most often he painted the view of the Elbe outside his windows in various kinds of light. Like John Constable, Dahl felt that the sky was an important part of a landscape painting, and he never grew tired of watching the clouds move over the flat plain. One critic has compared two paintings of Friedrich and Dahl: \u201cIn...Dahl's 'Mother and Child by the Sea', there are echoes of Friedrich's 'Woman by the Sea' (1818). Whereas in Friedrich's work a woman dressed for the windy weather sits idly watching five fishing boats sailing past, in Dahl's picture, there seems to be a more personal note, with echoes of his own upbringing in a seafaring community, as the mother and small child eagerly await the return of the little ship from the sea.\u201d The same critic has written about one of his paintings of Dresden: \u201cDahl also commemorated the magnificent Baroque buildings of his adopted city, and a version of his View of Dresden by Moonlight (1838) has travelled from the National Museum of Art, Architecture, and Design in Oslo. This small picture, measuring only 18.5 x 34.5 cm, shows the dome of the Frauenkirche and the tower of the Hofkirche dominating the skyline; silvers and deep blue combine to give it a wonderful jewel-like effect, together with a certain elegiac quality, perhaps indicative of the artist's awareness that his long friendship with Friedrich was nearing an end.\u201d\n\nAs Dahl wrote in 1828 to the director of the Dresden academy, he found the area around Dresden useful for nature studies, but the \u201creal thing\u201d was always missing; that was something he could only find in his mountainous homeland. He viewed himself as a \u201cmore Nordic painter\u201d with a \u201clove for seacoasts, mountains, waterfalls, sailboats, and pictures of the sea in daylight and moonlight.\u201d He longed to return to Norway, but not until 1826 was he able to make a journey home.\n\nHe made subsequent trips to Norway in 1834, 1839, 1844, and 1850, mostly exploring and painting the mountains, leading to the monumental works Fortundalen (1836) and Stalheim (1842). During his visits to Norway he received \u201can enthusiastic welcome as a painter of renown.\u201d\n\nA critic notes Dahl's late stylistic changes: \u201cIn his late Fjord at Sunset (1850), based on studies made earlier, free and adventurous brush strokes represent the cloud-swept sky and broken surface of the water. Here he has moved far away from the purity and intensity of Friedrich's oeuvre.\u201d\n\nIn 1827 Emilie Dahl died in childbirth while having their fourth child, and two years later two of the older children died of scarlet fever. In January 1830, Dahl married his student Amalie von Bassewitz, but she, too, died in childbirth in December of that same year. Dahl was crushed, and many months passed before he was able to paint again. Some years later this youngest child also died, leaving Dahl with two surviving children, Siegwald and Caroline, who married the Norwegian minister Anders Sand\u00f8e \u00d8rsted Bull 1848.\n\nDahl's trip to Norway in 1850 would be his last. He was aging and weak, but continued to paint landscapes in the mountains. This last journey to his homeland resulted in several magnificent works, including M\u00e5b\u00f8dalen, Fra Stugun\u00f8set, and Hjelle i Valdres.\n\nDahl was among the founding fathers of the National Gallery of Norway (Norwegian: Nasjonalgalleriet), now the National Museum of Art, Architecture, and Design, and donated his own art collection to the institution. Together with Johan Sebastian Welhaven, Frederik Stang, and Henrik Heftye, he founded the Art Society in Oslo (Oslo Kunstforening).\n\nDahl died after a brief illness and was buried on 17 October 1857 in Dresden. In 1902, a statue of Dahl by Norwegian sculptor Ambrosia T\u00f8nnesen (1859\u20131948) was erected on the facade of the West Norway Museum of Decorative Art in Bergen. In 1934, his remains were brought back to Norway and buried in the cemetery of St. Jacob's Church (Sankt Jakob kirke) in Bergen.\n\nJ.C. Dahl occupies a central position in Norwegian artistic life of the first half of the 19th century. His Romantic yet naturalistic interpretations of Norwegian scenery were greatly admired in Norway as well as on the European continent, particularly in Denmark and Germany."}, {"url": "https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/438159", "page_content": "Use your arrow keys to navigate the tabs below, and your tab key to choose an item\n\nLava, fire, and steam spew from the caldera of Mount Vesuvius above the Bay of Naples. Depicted from behind, a pair of finely attired visitors on their Grand Tour view the event up-close. Their guides and donkeys wait patiently in the foreground at the lower right. The Eruption of Vesuvius is a striking depiction of a force of nature that animated the European imagination after 1748, when Pompeii, buried by the eruption of 79 AD, was rediscovered. A few years later, Edmund Burke described major natural phenomena that inspire a sense of awe as \u201cSublime\u201d in his treatise A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757). The text became foundational to the incipient Romantic era. By the early nineteenth century, visitors to Italy traveled south from Rome to Naples not only to see the city and its glorious Mediterranean setting, but with the hope of witnessing an eruption like the one depicted here.[1]\n\n\n\nThis painting was commissioned in 1821 by Dahl\u2019s most important patron, Danish Crown Prince Christian Frederik, the future King Christian VIII, who eventually acquired eighteen works by the Norwegian artist. A longtime territory of Denmark\u2019s, Norway received its own constitution in 1814, but ambitious Norwegians typically sojourned in Copenhagen to develop their skills after reaching the limits of educational possibilities in their still-provincial country. Dahl left his native Bergen in 1811, studying for seven years with the landscape painter Christian August Lorentzen (1749\u20131828) at the Royal Academy of Fine Art. It was there that Dahl first gained the attention of Christian Frederik. In 1818, Dahl moved to Dresden, where Christian Frederik visited him in the spring of 1819, en route to Italy. In May 1820, Dahl received an invitation to join the prince, who offered to cover his expenses. The painter left Dresden on June 13 and arrived at the palace of Quisisana, above Castellammare on the Bay of Naples, on August 11. He remained in Italy for ten months, leaving from Rome on June 21, 1821.\n\n\n\nVesuvius erupted on December 20, 1820, and Dahl ascended the volcano as quickly as he could to observe the phenomenon on the spot. The next day he painted a sketch, or study, to record what he had seen. On July 13, 1824, Christian Frederik wrote to Dahl, expressing pleasure that the artist was working on a painting of Vesuvius for him, which \u201cjudging from the sketch, cannot fail to impress.\u201d This was presumably the sketch that Dahl executed immediately after the eruption, which Christian Frederik could have seen in Naples, or afterward, in Rome. That sketch is probably the one now in the Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen, which is signed and dated December 24, 1820 (Bang 1987, no. 257). Dahl exhibited the present work in the Dresden Academy\u2019s annual exhibition in 1824. It was delivered to the patron in January 1825 and exhibited at the Danish Academy\u2019s annual exhibition in Copenhagen later that year.\n\n\n\nDahl painted two versions of this composition before he left Italy. One, dated February 21, 1821, is also in the Statens Museum (Bang 296). Another was produced in Rome in 1821 for the Prussian consul, Jacob Bartholdi, and is now in the KODE Art Museums, Bergen (Bang 316). There are at least four other versions, dated 1826 (St\u00e4del Museum, Frankfurt; Bang 510), 1845 (whereabouts unknown, Bang 1032), what may be a copy after the present work possibly executed by 1832 (Nasjonalmuseet, Oslo; Bang 1254), and another, possibly datable about 1820\u201324 (private collection, Salten, Norway, in 1987; Bang 1284).\n\n\n\nThere are two related drawings, a study of ships in the bay, dated \u201c24 Octbr 1820,\u201d and a study of the man to the right by the flames, signed, dated, and inscribed \u201cProf. Friedrich\u2019s Figur.

Between 1380 and 1814, Norway was an impoverished and oppressed land ruled over by Denmark. In the redrawing of the map of Europe after the defeat of Napoleon, Norway still did not gain its independence but was forced into union with Sweden under Karl Johan who tactlessly had his palace in Oslo built by gangs of Norwegian prisoners in chains.\n\nAt the time of these post-Napoleonic European convulsions, Johan Christian Dahl (1788\u20131857), known as \u2018the father of Norwegian painting\u2019, was studying at the Art Academy in Denmark and travelling widely. (Norway did not have its own art academy, let alone a national gallery.) Norway had been partially recorded topographically and a few intrepid Danish artists had undertaken minor painting tours, but despite the 18th century\u2019s fascination with Alpinism and \u2018gothick gloomth\u2019, Norway\u2019s vertiginous peaks and thundering torrents remained undiscovered by the European Romantic movement, and unpainted.\n\nAs a student in Copenhagen, Dahl saw Dutch landscapes. In 1818 he moved to Dresden where the great Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich (1744\u20131840) was at the height of his powers. The two men became housemates and close friends. In 1821 Dahl visited Rome and sketched in the Campagna, where he realised the mythologising potential of landscape. Both painters produced their sweeping canvases in the studio, but while Friedrich continued to take the local landscape as his subject and transform it though his spiritual vision, Dahl painted visions of Norway, translating the peaks of the Sognefjord, the thundering Labro torrent and other recognisable Norwegian beauty spots into a new, impressive and turbulent vision of a northern Arcadia.\n\nDahl found it much easier to portray his country from abroad (as Henrik Ibsen did a generation later). As his fame grew he remained in Dresden where he taught at the Academy, but he did not forget the plight of his fellow countrymen. In the 1830s he was instrumental in founding both the National Gallery of Norway and the Norwegian Art Association. Norwegian artists could now see real examples of world art in a gallery, rather than poring over books of prints and engravings. The Art Association gave them a meeting place where they could discuss their own work in the context of their European contemporaries. A national school gradually formed.\n\nDahl\u2019s studio in Dresden became a place of pilgrimage for Norwegian painters who wanted to build on the German Romantic tradition. The clear line from Friedrich can be seen in Old Birch Tree at the Sognefjord (1839) by Thomas Fearnley (1802\u201342), a clever progression from Friedrich\u2019s famous The Wanderer above the Sea of Fog (1818). In the latter the individual human hero stands strong and straight against a tempestuous background, but Fearnley replaces the human figure with an ancient birch tree, symbolising Norway. Composition, theme, spirituality and yearning are similar in both paintings but Fearnley moves the message away from Romantic individualism and towards nationalist symbolism.\n\nThe nationalist theme was taken up by Adolf Tidemand, who peopled his landscapes with depressed and depressing peasants. Hans F. Gude and August Capellen, who both taught at the D\u00fcsseldorf Academy, returned the focus to pure landscape. Capellen and Lars Hertevig, a pupil of Gude in D\u00fcsseldorf, ventured more timidly into the sublime, unmooring their pictures from specific Norwegian locations to give them generic titles such as Decaying Forest (1852) and Thunder Looms (1856). Fearnley\u2019s lone birch tree as symbol of Norway was further developed by Eilif Peterssen in Summer Night (1888), an informal composition of a birch fallen across a sheet of water. Consciously or unconsciously, nationalism in art had progressed from a first stage of carefully composed, idealised set pieces to portraying a slice of reality to which every citizen could relate; any countryman might glimpse something very like the casual beauty depicted in Peterssen\u2019s Summer Night on an evening walk.\n\nWhile Peterssen, Fearnley and others were moving towards more realistic observation, Peder Balke (1804\u201387) was moving in the other direction, towards the imaginative sublime. For a century Norwegian landscape would continue on both paths. Naturalistic and symbolic-visionary approaches existed side by side and only rare artists, such as Edvard Munch, would dip in and out of both.\n\nBalke was a loner drawn to the furthest north, which he invested with a gothic intensity. His best pictures are tiny and very personal observations of vast and threatening scenes: ice floes, tossing seas, vertiginous cliffs, often weirdly illuminated by silvery moonlight or by the scribble of the Northern Lights in the sky. Mystical and often tempestuous, Balke\u2019s vision of the magnificent, coldly indifferent motherland offers no comfort, but demands sacrifice and worship. Balke\u2019s technique eschews careful finish. Sometimes he applied the paint with his hands; often he painted in monochrome, in tones of blue or brown, or just black and white. At a first glance it is possible to take his small, improvisational oils on panel for early photographs. Some areas are misty and faded out, others sharply in focus. Balke made no attempt at naturalism. His landscapes are often empty: solitary figures, lighthouses, lone trees or boats in obvious peril are only there to emphasise the ineluctable power of nature and the heroic North. He records impersonally, ostensibly avoiding emotional manipulation, but for all that, his landscapes pack a powerful punch, the strongest in Norwegian painting until Munch.\n\nAs Balke was active in the 1830s and \u201940s, the Norwegian folk movement was in full, nationalistic swing. Olaf Isaachsen was a painter who was well-versed internationally, having studied first in D\u00fcsseldorf and then in France under Couture and Courbet. His landscapes feature peasants in colourful national dress; he even felt it important to record unpeopled peasant interiors. The folklorists Asbj\u00f8rnsen and Moe, who tramped the very long length of Norway collecting tales from thousands of isolated valleys, published their Norwegian Folk Tales in the Norwegian language in 1841. This was a major political act. Throughout the preceding four centuries Norway\u2019s official written language had been Danish, a bureaucratic arrangement that had deprived the Norwegian people of widespread literacy, let alone literature. Norwegian Folk Tales was illustrated by Erik Werenskiold (1855\u20131938) and Theodor Kittelsen (1857\u20131914), and the two artists gave graphic physical shape to the terrifying creatures that haunted the Norwegian imagination. They created the folkloric archetypes that endure to this day: the troll that gurns at you from every tourist trap, and Kittelsen\u2019s subtler and more terrifying Skogtroll, the forest troll (1888) who takes the form of an anthropomorphised mountain.\n\nBy the 1880s, Norway still had not achieved independence but its artistic compass had moved from Germany to France. Young painters were becoming sceptical of rigid German academic training, and bohemian Paris beckoned. Here, at last, Norwegian culture was wielding a wider influence. Ibsen\u2019s plays were all the rage in Paris, where Frits Thaulow (1847\u20131906) was celebrated as \u2018the painter of snow\u2019. Thaulow had no strong nationalist agenda but his luminous landscapes inspired Monet to visit Norway in 1895, where the Frenchman had terrible trouble with his paint freezing. French influence grew in turn as Thaulow came home in the summers to pioneer plein air painting at his Open Air Academy in Modum.\n\nChristian Krohg (1852\u20131925) is not in the front rank of Norwegian artists but he was very important at a time when their attention was turning to Paris, and to French Impressionism. Krohg taught in Paris at the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi; his style was realist, his convictions socialist and his subjects unashamedly political. Ragged urchins, defiant prostitutes and heroic sea captains in sou\u2019westers represent Norway\u2019s poverty and injustice. In 1882, Krohg attended the seventh and largest Impressionist exhibition and returned to Norway the same year brimming with ideas. He organised the first exhibition of independent artists in Oslo and opened an art school where Impressionism and pointillism were discussed and tried out. His pupils for a time included the young Edvard Munch (1863\u20131944). When Munch exhibited a pointilliste canvas in Oslo \u2013 Spring Day on Karl Johan Street (1890) \u2013 Norwegian doctors earnestly warned the public against looking at it, believing they could catch spotty diseases, such as measles and chicken pox from a mere glance.\n\nMunch soon outgrew Krohg, pointillism and all other -isms to paint his completely original landscapes. In 1885, he had paid the first of several long visits to Paris. The following year the French poet Jean Mor\u00e9as published his Symbolist Manifesto in Le Figaro. Mor\u00e9as attacked naturalism, urging writers and artists to be more evocative and suggestive in their response to nature. Munch wrote in his journal: \u2018If it is possible to produce the desired effect by changing nature, then it should be done\u2026 Whether the picture resembles nature or not is irrelevant, as a picture cannot be explained; the reason for its being painted in the first place was that the artist could find no other means of expressing what he saw.\u2019 In Paris Munch was strongly impressed by Puvis de Chavannes and by Gauguin\u2019s flattening of space, simplification of forms and non-naturalistic use of colour, all of which we can see in curiously static and serene symbolist landscapes, such as Starry Night (1893; Fig. 6), which offer a dreamy, mystic view of the world. Munch had seen the Van Gogh retrospective of 1891, and the influence of the Dutch artist\u2019s hectically directional brushwork can be detected in Munch\u2019s best-known works, the troubled and turbulent paintings all created around 1893, such as Anxiety, or Evening on Karl Johan or The Scream. These are not the first paintings one would think of as landscapes but place is overwhelmingly significant to Munch, and in these great Expressionist canvases, recognisable landscapes play as important a part as the figures. In Munch\u2019s written account of the vision that inspired The Scream, he relates how he saw the \u2018clouds over the fjord drip[ped] reeking blood\u2019 as he heard \u2018a huge, extraordinary scream pass through nature\u2019. He does not even mention the role of the figure in the painting, although today people see it as the main focus.\n\nNorway achieved independence in 1905. \u2018Yes, we love this land!\u2019 runs the first line of the national anthem, celebrating the country in both senses of the word. That same year, Harald Sohlberg (1869\u20131935) produced Flower Meadow in the North, hymning Norway\u2019s pastoral bliss and speaking of release, fecundity and a limitless national vision.\n\n\u2018I have felt nature\u2019s enigmatic and incomprehensible side and I have instinctively sought to know and understand it,\u2019 Solhberg wrote in the late 1880s. Sohlberg\u2019s landscapes, like those of his contemporary Munch, were metaphors for deep feelings, but his technique for conveying them could hardly be more different. Munch\u2019s emotional punch is heightened by the impression that he painted at vast speed: paint dribbles and splodges and patches of naked canvas contribute to the idea of hastily conveyed inner turmoil. But Sohlberg, who had been apprenticed to a scene painter, employed the craftsman\u2019s careful scaling up from meticulous preparatory drawings on to the canvas using a grid. He also used the old-fashioned glazing technique, carefully building up thin layers of almost transparent paint over coloured underlays. Sohlberg might take two years over a painting; nevertheless, he too aimed at immediate emotional punch. Like Munch, Sohlberg was influenced by Gauguin\u2019s flattening of space, anti-naturalistic use of colour and synthesist rhythmic patterns. Sohlberg\u2019s simplified and evocative landscapes defy definition, hovering between naturalism, symbolism and Fauvism in their strong and often vividly contrasting colours.\n\nSohlberg\u2019s landscapes of mood and memory are nourished by feelings of isolation, separation and the spiritual yearning attendant on the arrival of the machine age and the departure of God. He found his two great recurring themes in the mystical untouched splendour of the Rondane mountains, a major Symbolist-Romantic subject into which he infused intense lyricism. In contrast, he took R\u00f8ros, a copper-mining town, as a symbol of the industrial revolution creeping through Norway, corrupting the land and diminishing humanity. He paints the long R\u00f8ros high street in overly bright, flat light, in perfectly enamelled finish and in obsessive detail. You can count every plank on every wooden house. Objectively, the street is undeniably picturesque, yet the insistent clarity makes the subject repellent: in forcing the material world upon the viewer Sohlberg is showing us that the world de-souled is not a sympathetic place. A contemporary critic observed that Sohlberg does not so much show us a picture of a street as the foreboding before a storm.\n\nFrom the 1820s onwards, when J.C. Dahl began to shape an image of Norway, its artists have celebrated the country in diverse ways. In a recent poll, Sohlberg\u2019s vision of the Rondane mountains, Winter Night in the Mountains (1914), was voted Norway\u2019s favourite painting. Sohlberg and Munch were the two artists who finally freed Norwegian art from the influence of both Germany and France and gave it a vision of itself. By ditching nationalism, they laid the foundations for a true national art.\n\n\u2018Harald Sohlberg: Painting Norway\u2019 is at the Dulwich Picture Gallery until 2 June. \u2018Edvard Munch: Love and Angst\u2019 is at the British Museum until 21 July.\n\nFrom the April 2019 issue of Apollo.

His artistic career is the story of how the wild nature of Norway found his expression in art.\n\nHis motifs allowed both foreigners and Norwegians to become familiar with a landscape that was previously unknown to them. With his brushstrokes, it was possible to admire nature instead of fearing it.\n\nWith his romantic approach and strong feelings of national identity, Dahl fostered a completely new understanding of the distinctive, dazzling and powerful character of the untamed Norwegian wilderness. In this way, Dahl defined the very image of Norway.\n\nBorn in Bergen, Norway, in 1788 amid crushing poverty.\n\nDahl's early training was as a house painter and decorative artist in his native town, from which some views he painted at this time are known.\n\nIt didn't take long for people to notice his talent and a group of wealthy citizens raised money that allowed him to travel to Copenhagen in 1811 to study at the art academy, since there was no academy in Norway in those days, not until 1909.\n\nProfessor CA Lorentzen (1746-1828) was his teacher, although the poetic landscapes of Jens Juell (1745-1802) made a greater impression on the young Dahl.\n\nHowever, it was the study of XNUMXth century Dutch landscapes in Danish collections that really helped him move towards his goal of becoming the modern interpreter of the landscape of Norway.\n\nIn this first phase of his career he was already painting Nordic-type landscapes inspired by the old Dutch masters, but he also painted and drew directly from life. His paintings attracted attention and in Copenhagen found both a clientele and friends for life, where the German landscape painter Casper DavidFriedrich.\n\nIn the fall of 1818, Dahl left Copenhagen since his intention was to make a study trip to the most important cultural centers of Europe. However, it did not go beyond Dresden, where he married and settled for the rest of his life.\n\nThere, he devoted himself to his true-to-nature Nordic landscapes that brought a breath of fresh air to mainstream art circles. Dresden.\n\nmust have learned something Copenhagen, because he emerged painting in the then elegant romantic mode, lots of stormy skies and moonlight.\n\nOn the other hand, he never acquired some of the usual painter skills, especially portraiture, which was how most XNUMXth-century painters made a living.\n\nTaking advantage of his close friendship with the great German romantic painter CD Friedrich, drew on his influence from his art to enhance and create moonlit landscapes.\n\nIn June 1820 he traveled, somewhat reluctantly, to Italy to meet the danish prince Christian Fredrik and his entourage in Villa Quisisana, on the outskirts of N\u00e1poles. That visit, accompanied by a group of German painters, helped him develop a new free style for making studies, a fundamental stage in his development as an artist and his way of perceiving nature.\n\nReturn to Dresden in July 1821 and in 1824, like Friedrich, and was appointed professor at the first Art academy in his country.\n\nIn 1826 he made a long study tour in Norway, his first visit there since leaving the country in 1811. In that time, he traveled great distances in the mountainous Southwest on horseback and on foot, and produced a large number of studies on which he went to base future paintings executed in his studio of Dresden.\n\nDahl visited Norway again in 1834, 1839, 1844 and 1850, and thus he was able to broaden the range of his norwegian theme.\n\nHe actively participated in promoting the preservation of historical monuments in Norway. Later in his life, he was also one of the founding fathers of the National Gallery and the Art Society of Christiania, both established in 1836.\n\nThe great painter died in Dresden in 1857."}, {"url": "https://pantheon.world/profile/person/Johan_Christian_Dahl/", "page_content": "Johan Christian Dahl\n\nJohan Christian Claussen Dahl (24 February 1788 \u2013 14 October 1857), often known as J.

C. Dahl, was a Norwegian artist who is considered the first great romantic painter in Norway, the founder of the \"golden age\" of Norwegian painting, and one of the great European artists of all time. He is often described as \"the father of Norwegian landscape painting\" and is regarded as the first Norwegian Painter ever to reach a level of artistic accomplishment comparable to that attained by the greatest European artists of his day.

Dahl occupies a central position in Norwegian artistic life of the first half of the 19th century.\n\nAlthough Dahl spent much of his life outside of Norway, his love for his country is clear in the motifs he chose for his paintings and in his extraordinary efforts on behalf of Norwegian culture generally. Indeed, if one sets aside his own monumental artistic creations, his other activities on behalf of art, history, and culture would still have guaranteed him a place at the very heart of the artistic and cultural history of Norway. He was, for example, a key figure in the founding of the Norwegian National Gallery and of several other major art institutions in Norway, as well as in the preservation of Norwegian stave churches and the restoration of the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim and H\u00e5konshallen in Bergen.\n\n\"real teacher\" in his childhood and, for all his spectacular success, he believed that if he had been more fortunate in his birth, he would have achieved even more than he had. Dahl came from a very simple background - his father was a modest fisherman in Bergen, Norway - and he would later look back at his youth with bitterness. He regretted that he never had ain his childhood and, for all his spectacular success, he believed that if he had been more fortunate in his birth, he would have achieved even more than he had.\n\nAs a boy Dahl was taken in hand by a sympathetic mentor at the Bergen cathedral who at first thought that this bright student would make a good priest, but then, recognizing his remarkably precocious artistic ability, arranged for him to be trained as an artist. From 1803-1809 Dahl studied with the painter J. G. M\u00fcller, whose workshop was the most important one in Bergen at the time. Still, Dahl looked back on his teacher as having kept him in ignorance in order to exploit him, putting him to work painting theatrical sets, portraits, and views of Bergen and its surroundings. Another mentor, Lyder Sagen, showed the aspiring artist books about art and awakened his interest in historical and patriotic subjects. It was also Sagen who took up a collection that made it possible for Dahl to go to Copenhagen in 1811 to complete his education at the academy there.\n\n\"nature above all\", Dahl's artistic program was, then, already in place: he would become a part of the great landscape tradition, but he would also be as faithful as possible to nature itself. As important as Dahl's studies at the academy in Copenhagen were his experiences in the surrounding countryside and in the city's art collections. In 1812 he wrote to Sagen that the landscape artists he most wished to emulate were Ruisdahl and Everdingen , and for that reason he was studying, Dahl's artistic program was, then, already in place: he would become a part of the great landscape tradition, but he would also be as faithful as possible to nature itself.\n\nDahl held that a landscape painting should not just depict a specific view, but should also say something about the land's nature and character - the greatness of its past and the life and work of its current inhabitants. The mood was often idyllic, often melancholy. When he added snow to a landscape he painted in the summer, it was not to show the light and colors of snow; it was to use snow as a symbol of death. As one critic has put it, \"Unlike the radically Romantic works also appearing at the time, Dahl softens his landscape, introducing elements of genre painting by imbuing it with anecdotal materials: In the background a wisp of smoke rises from a cabin, perhaps the home of the hunter on the snow-covered field.\" Thanks to Sagen's recommendations and to his own personal charm, Dahl soon gained access to the leading social circles in Copenhagen.\n\nDahl took part in annual art exhibitions in Copenhagen beginning in 1812, but his real breakthrough came in 1815, when he exhibited no fewer than 13 paintings. Prince Christian Frederik of Denmark , who developed an early interest in Dahl's artistic genius and saw to it that his works were purchased for the royal collection, became a lifelong friend and patron of the artist.\n\nIn 1816 C. W. Eckersberg returned from abroad with his paintings of Roman settings; Dahl was impressed at once, and they became good friends and exchanged pictures. Dahl's 1817 painting \"Den Store Kro i Fredensborg\" marked the real beginning of his lifelong production of oil paintings depicting natural subjects.\n\nAfter his success in Copenhagen, Dahl realized that he wanted to live as an independent, self-supporting artist. One challenge facing him was that the academic preference of the day was for historical paintings with moral messages. Landscapes were considered the lowest kind of art and perhaps even not as art at all, but as a purely mechanical imitation of nature. The only landscapes that could be considered art, according to the academy, were ideal, imaginary landscapes in pastoral or heroic styles. In accordance with this reigning taste, Dahl attempted to give his Danish themes a certain atmospheric character in order to lift them up above what was considered a merely commercial level. But at the same time it was his deepest wish to provide a more faithful picture of Norwegian nature than were afforded by the old-fashioned, dry paintings of Haas and Lorentzen. This desire was partly motivated by homesickness and patriotism, but it was also suited to the public taste of the day for \"picturesque\" works.\n\nDahl traveled to Dresden in September 1818. He arrived with introductions to the city's leading citizens and to major artists such as Caspar David Friedrich , who helped him establish himself there and became his close friend. One critic has written: \"Friedrich's still, meticulously executed landscapes - products of an art informed by his strict Protestant upbringing and a seeking for the divine in nature - were justifiably famous by the time he and Dahl became acquainted. We are able to see his 'Two Men Contemplating the Moon' (1819), which ranks among his greatest works, and features two \"R\u00fcckfiguren,\" or figures seen from behind, solemnly and companionably gazing at a young sickle moon from the edge of an old forest. 'Greifswald in Moonlight' (1816-17) depicts the artist's birthplace in Pomerania, on the Baltic coast: bathed in an even, gauzy moonlight, the ancient university town assumes an almost ethereal appearance.\"\n\nTwo Men Contemplating the Moon by Caspar David Friedrich: 1819\n\nThis is the third version of one of this artist's most famous paintings, of which the first (1819) is in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Dresden, and the second (ca. 1824) is in the Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin. The two men contemplating the sinking moon have been identified as Friedrich himself, on the right, and his talented young colleague August Heinrich (1794-1822). The mood of pious contemplation relates to fascination with the moon as expressed in contemporary poetry, literature, philosophy, and music. Both figures are seen from the back so that the viewer can participate in their communion with nature, which the Romantics saw as a manifestation of the Sublime.\n\nAlthough the landscape is imaginary, it is based on studies after nature that Friedrich had made in various regions at different times. Both men wear Old German dress, which had been adopted in 1815 by radical students as an expression of opposition to the ultraconservative policies then being enforced in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars. The staunchly patriotic Friedrich deliberately ignored the 1819 royal decree forbidding this practice and depicted figures in traditional costume until his death.\n\nFriedrich was fourteen years Dahl's elder and an established artist, but the two found in each other a shared love for nature and a shared enthusiasm for a way of depicting nature that was based on the study of nature itself rather than on the academic clich\u00e9s that they both profoundly despised. One writer has put it this way: \"A warm and sociable character, he soon met and became friendly with the more introverted and reclusive Friedrich, recording how they once walked together in the park of the Gr\u00f6sser Garten among 'many lovely trees of different kinds and the moon looked beautiful behind the dark fir trees.'\"\n\nTogether with Friedrich and Carl Gustav Carus , Dahl would become one of the Dresden painters of the period who exerted a decisive influence on German Romantic painting.\n\nPortrait of Gustav by Julius Hubner: 1844\n\n\"most of all I am representing nature in all its freedom and wildness.\" Dahl found enough material in the Dresden area to supply motifs for his paintings, but he continued to paint imaginary landscapes with forests, mountains, and waterfalls. One such painting, completed in 1819, entitled \"Norsk fjellandskap med elv\" (Mountainous Norwegian landscape with river\"), garnered great attention among younger artists who considered the striking natural quality of the painting a breath of fresh air on Dresden's stagnant art scene. Another monumental waterfall painting, completed the next year, was lavished with praised by the critic for Kunstblatt who said that Dahl was greater than In Dresden, as in Copenhagen, Dahl traveled around the area to draw subjects that could be of use to him in larger works that would be painted later in his atelier. He wrote to Prince Christian Frederik in 1818 thatDahl found enough material in the Dresden area to supply motifs for his paintings, but he continued to paint imaginary landscapes with forests, mountains, and waterfalls. One such painting, completed in 1819, entitled(Mountainous Norwegian landscape with river\"), garnered great attention among younger artists who considered the striking natural quality of the painting a breath of fresh air on Dresden's stagnant art scene. Another monumental waterfall painting, completed the next year, was lavished with praised by the critic for Kunstblatt who said that Dahl was greater than Jacob van Ruisdael . Dahl was accepted into the Dresden academy in 1820.\n\nNorwegian Mountain Landscape: 1819\n\nPrince Christian Frederik wrote to Dahl in 1820 from Italy and invited him to join him at the Gulf of Naples. Dahl was at the time courting a young woman named Emilie von Bloch, but felt he should take the prince up on his offer, so he married Emilie quickly and traveled to Italy the next day. He ended up spending 10 months in Italy. Though he missed his bride, the sojourn was a decisive factor in his artistic development. It was in Italy, with its strong southern light that Dahl's art truly flowered. It forced him to see nature plain, without the mediation of the old masters' renderings of light and color.\n\nDahl went to Rome in February 1821. He spent a great deal of time visiting museums, meeting other artists, and painting pictures to sell. In addition to painting sights in Rome and pictures of the Gulf of Naples, he painted landscapes inspired by the mountains of Norway. Dahl said that not until he was in Rome did he truly appreciate Norwegian nature. In June 1821 Dahl returned north to Emilie and a quiet life of family and painting.\n\nGrotto near Naples: 1821\n\nEruption of Vesuvius: 1823\n\nGulf of Naples Seen from a Cave: 1821\n\nStudy of Clouds at Full Moon: 1822\n\nCoast near Castellammare in the Morning Mist: 1822\n\nMausoleum of San Vito near Pozzuoli: 1820\n\nScene of the Villa Malta: 1821\n\nThe Eruption of Vesuvius: 1824\n\nThe Eruption of Vesuvius: 1826\n\nVesuvius Seen from Castellsmmare: 1820\n\nVesuvius Seen from Castellsmmare: 1821\n\nView from a Window at Quisisana: 1820\n\nView of Naples' Bay: 1823\n\nVolcano at Evening, Siciliy: Date Unknown\n\nDahl quickly became a member of Dresden's leading circles of poets, artists, and scientists, among them the archeologist C. A. B\u00f6ttiger, publisher of Artistisches Notizenblatt, who ran a major article on Dahl in 1822.\n\n\"extraordinary professors\" who had no chair but who received a regular salary. In 1823 Dahl moved in with Friedrich, so that many of his students, such as Bay of Naples in 1821 when Mount Vesuvius was active. Here he painted 'Boats on the Beach Near Naples', where fishing crafts lie at anchor in the calm, shimmering waters with the twin peaks of the mountain smoking and flaming behind. Predictably, after his close association with Friedrich began - the two families shared a house in Dresden from 1823 - he was considerably influenced by him, but his own more spontaneous and painterly style soon prevailed. Clients sometimes commissioned pictures from them both, a tranquil coastal scene by Friedrich to pair with a stormier subject from Dahl.\" As a member of the academy, Dahl always gave of his time to young artists who sought him out. In 1824 he and Friedrich were namedwho had no chair but who received a regular salary. In 1823 Dahl moved in with Friedrich, so that many of his students, such as Knud Baade Peder Balke , and Thomas Fearnley , were equally influenced by both artists. \"Well before their meeting,\" writes one critic, \"Dahl had also painted a number of 'moonlights' and, travelling in Europe, he was in thewhen Mount Vesuvius was active. Here he painted 'Boats on the Beach Near Naples', where fishing crafts lie at anchor in the calm, shimmering waters with the twin peaks of the mountain smoking and flaming behind. Predictably, after his close association with Friedrich began - the two families shared a house in Dresden from 1823 - he was considerably influenced by him, but his own more spontaneous and painterly style soon prevailed. Clients sometimes commissioned pictures from them both, a tranquil coastal scene by Friedrich to pair with a stormier subject from Dahl.\"\n\nDahl never formed a \"school\" around himself, but rather preferred for his students to cultivate their own styles; it was against his principles and his respect for artistic freedom to try to inhibit his students' individuality. It was this impulse toward individuality that later caused him to turn down an offer of a permanent chair at the academy - he didn't want to feel compelled to show up for class when he was busy working on a painting.\n\nDahl continued his studies of nature in the area around Dresden when he had the time, or on longer trips which provided him with themes for his paintings. But most often he painted the view of the Elbe outside his windows in various kinds of light. Like Constable, Dahl felt that the sky was an important part of a landscape painting, and he never grew tired of watching the clouds move over the flat plain. One critic has compared two paintings of Friedrich and Dahl: \"In...Dahl's 'Mother and Child by the Sea', there are echoes of Friedrich's 'Woman by the Sea' (1818). Whereas in Friedrich's work a woman dressed for the windy weather sits idly watching five fishing boats sailing past, in Dahl's picture, there seems to be a more personal note, with echoes of his own upbringing in a seafaring community, as the mother and small child eagerly await the return of the little ship from the sea.\" The same critic has written about one of his paintings of Dresden: \"Dahl also commemorated the magnificent Baroque buildings of his adopted city, and a version of his 'View of Dresden by Moonlight' (1838) has travelled from the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo. This small picture, measuring only 18.5 x 34.5 cm, shows the dome of the Frauenkirche and the tower of the Hofkirche dominating the skyline; silvers and deep blue combine to give it a wonderful jewel-like effect, together with a certain elegiac quality, perhaps indicative of the artist's awareness that his long friendship with Friedrich was nearing an end.\"\n\nMother and Child by the Sea: 1830\n\nMother and Child by the Sea: 1840\n\nView of Dresden by Moonlight: 1838\n\nAs Dahl wrote in 1828 to the director of the Dresden academy, he found the area around Dresden useful for nature studies, but the \"real thing\" was always missing; that was something he could only find in his mountainous homeland. He viewed himself as a \"more Nordic painter\" with a \"love for seacoasts, mountains, waterfalls, sailboats, and pictures of the sea in daylight and moonlight.\" He longed to return to Norway, but not until 1826 was he able to make a journey home.\n\nHe made subsequent trips to Norway in 1834, 1839, 1844, and 1850, mostly exploring and painting the mountains, leading to the monumental works Fortundalen (1836) and Stalheim (1842). During his visits to Norway he received \"an enthusiastic welcome as a painter of renown.\"\n\nView of Fortundalen: 1836\n\nStalheim: 1842\n\nA critic notes Dahl's late stylistic changes: \"In his late 'Fjord at Sunset' (1850), based on studies made earlier, free and adventurous brush strokes represent the cloud-swept sky and broken surface of the water. Here he has moved far away from the purity and intensity of Friedrich's oeuvre.\"\n\nIn 1827 Emilie Dahl died in childbirth while having their fourth child, and two years later two of the older children died of scarlet fever. In January 1830 Dahl married his student Amalie von Bassewitz, but she, too, died in childbirth in December of that same year. Dahl was crushed, and many months passed before he was able to paint again. Some years later this youngest child also died, leaving Dahl with two surviving children, Caroline and Siegwald.\n\nDahl's trip to Norway in 1850 would be his last. He was aging and weak, but continued to paint landscapes in the mountains. This last journey to his homeland resulted in several magnificent works, including M\u00e5bodalen, Fra Stugunoset, and Hjelle i Valdres.\n\nDahl was also among the founding fathers of the National Gallery of Norway (Norwegian: Nasjonalgalleriet ), now the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, and donated his own art collection to the institution. Together with Johan Sebastian Welhaven, Frederik Stang and Henrik Heftye, he also founded the Art Society in Oslo ( Oslo Kunstforening ).\n\nDahl died lonely and bitter after a brief illness and was buried on October 17, 1857, in Dresden. In 1902, a statue of Dahl by Norwegian sculptor Ambrosia Tonnesen (1859-1948), was erected on the facade of the Vestlandske kunstindustrimuseum in Bergen. In 1934, his remains brought back to Norway and buried in the cemetery of St. Jacob's Church (Sankt Jakob Kirke) in Bergen.\n\nJ.C. Dahl occupies a central position in Norwegian artistic life of the first half of the 19th century. His Romantic yet naturalistic interpretations of Norwegian scenery were greatly admired in Norway as well as on the European continent, particularly in Denmark and Germany. His place in the pantheon of European artists is secure and his influence on the course of art history is indelible.\n\nQuoted From: Johan Christian Dahl - Wikipedia Various Works of Johan (John) Christian Dahl Alpine Landscape: 1821 Avaldsnes Church: 1813 Avaldsnes Church: 1820 Birch in a Storm: 1849 Birch in a Storm: 1849 (Alternate View) Birch in Autumn Landscape: Date Unknown Birch Tree in Winter: 1838 Chalk Pit near Maxen: 1835 Cloud Study, Thunder Clouds over the Palace Tower at Dresden: 1825 Cloud Study: 1832 Cloud Study with Horizon: 1832 Coastal Landscape with Burial Mounds and Standing Stones: 1837 Copenhagen Harbor in Moonlight: 1831 Copenhagen Harbor by Moonlight: 1846 Copenhagen Harbor by Twilight: 1846 Dresden at Night: 1845 Dresden at Night: 1845 (Alternate View) Dreyhaven near Copenhagen: 1845 (Alternate View Elbe Seen From Bruhls Terrace: 1824 Entrance to the Port of Copenhagen with the\n\nMasting Sheer seen to the right: 1830 Forest Fire Glows: 1846 Fredericksborg Castle: 1817 Frederiksborg Castle: 1814 Frederiksholms Canal in Copenhagen with Christian IV's Brewery: 1817 Holmestrand: 1843 Julie Vogel in the Garden: 1825-28 Labrofossen: 1829 Lake Esrom by Moonlight: 1814 Landscape at Kaupanger with stave church: 1847 Landscape in Evening Light Landscape with Memorial Stones: 1839 Larvik, Vestfold County, Norway: 1848 Lyshornet near Bergen: 1836 Maridalen: 1852 Megalith Grave near Vordingborg in Winter: 1824-25 M\u00f8ensklint: 1828 Mill in Liebethaler Grund: 1823 Morning after a Stormy Night: 1819 Mountain Landscape with a Castle: 1816 Northern Landscape: 1822 Norwegian Landscape, Rogna Waterfall: 1812 Norwegian Landscape: 1823 Norwegian Landscape: 1829 Norwegian Landscape with a Bridge: 1815 Norwegian Mountain Landscape with Waterfall: 1821 Pedersborg: 1832 Plauenscher Grund: 1819 Prospect of Dresden Seen from Pieschen, March Haze: 1844 Shipwreck on the Coast of Norway: 1832 Shipwreck on the Coast of Norway: 1829 Shipwreck on the Coast of Norway: 1831 Stormy Day in Dresden: 1830 Stugun\u00f8set, Filefjeld: 1851 The Elbe and Dresden Neustadt in the Evening Light: 1837 The Elbe Valley near Dresden: Date Unknown The Frankenkirche, Dresden: 1840 The Grosser Garten, Dresden: 1822 The Lower Falls of the Labrofoss: 1827 Thunderstorm Near Dresden: 1830 Trolltindene: 1823 Two Belfries at Sunset, Copenhagen: 1825 View from Bastei: 1819 View from Vaekero near Christiania: 1827 View of Naerodalen: 1847 View of \u00d8ylo Farm, Valdres: 1846 View over Hallingdal: 1844 View of Swinoujscie: 1840 View of the Feigumfoss in Lysterfjord: 1848 View over the Elbe and the 'Der B\u00e4r' Bastion: Date Unknown Watzmann: 1825 Waves and Breakers in the Bay of Naples: 1821 Winter Landscape near Vordingborg: 1829 Related Source Material : Johan Christian Dahl Online Johan Christian Dahl -

He regretted that he never had ain his childhood and, for all his spectacular success, he believed that if he had been more fortunate in his birth, he would have achieved even more than he had.\n\nAs a boy Dahl was taken in hand by a sympathetic mentor at the Bergen cathedral who at first thought that this bright student would make a good priest, but then, recognizing his remarkably precocious artistic ability, arranged for him to be trained as an artist. From 1803-1809 Dahl studied with the painter J. G. M\u00fcller, whose workshop was the most important one in Bergen at the time. Still, Dahl looked back on his teacher as having kept him in ignorance in order to exploit him, putting him to work painting theatrical sets, portraits, and views of Bergen and its surroundings. Another mentor, Lyder Sagen, showed the aspiring artist books about art and awakened his interest in historical and patriotic subjects. It was also Sagen who took up a collection that made it possible for Dahl to go to Copenhagen in 1811 to complete his education at the academy there.\n\n\"nature above all\", Dahl's artistic program was, then, already in place: he would become a part of the great landscape tradition, but he would also be as faithful as possible to nature itself. As important as Dahl's studies at the academy in Copenhagen were his experiences in the surrounding countryside and in the city's art collections. In 1812 he wrote to Sagen that the landscape artists he most wished to emulate were Ruisdahl and Everdingen , and for that reason he was studying, Dahl's artistic program was, then, already in place: he would become a part of the great landscape tradition, but he would also be as faithful as possible to nature itself.\n\nDahl held that a landscape painting should not just depict a specific view, but should also say something about the land's nature and character - the greatness of its past and the life and work of its current inhabitants. The mood was often idyllic, often melancholy. When he added snow to a landscape he painted in the summer, it was not to show the light and colors of snow; it was to use snow as a symbol of death. As one critic has put it, \"Unlike the radically Romantic works also appearing at the time, Dahl softens his landscape, introducing elements of genre painting by imbuing it with anecdotal materials: In the background a wisp of smoke rises from a cabin, perhaps the home of the hunter on the snow-covered field.\" Thanks to Sagen's recommendations and to his own personal charm, Dahl soon gained access to the leading social circles in Copenhagen.\n\nDahl took part in annual art exhibitions in Copenhagen beginning in 1812, but his real breakthrough came in 1815, when he exhibited no fewer than 13 paintings. Prince Christian Frederik of Denmark , who developed an early interest in Dahl's artistic genius and saw to it that his works were purchased for the royal collection, became a lifelong friend and patron of the artist.\n\nIn 1816 C. W. Eckersberg returned from abroad with his paintings of Roman settings; Dahl was impressed at once, and they became good friends and exchanged pictures. Dahl's 1817 painting \"Den Store Kro i Fredensborg\" marked the real beginning of his lifelong production of oil paintings depicting natural subjects.\n\nAfter his success in Copenhagen, Dahl realized that he wanted to live as an independent, self-supporting artist. One challenge facing him was that the academic preference of the day was for historical paintings with moral messages. Landscapes were considered the lowest kind of art and perhaps even not as art at all, but as a purely mechanical imitation of nature. The only landscapes that could be considered art, according to the academy, were ideal, imaginary landscapes in pastoral or heroic styles. In accordance with this reigning taste, Dahl attempted to give his Danish themes a certain atmospheric character in order to lift them up above what was considered a merely commercial level. But at the same time it was his deepest wish to provide a more faithful picture of Norwegian nature than were afforded by the old-fashioned, dry paintings of Haas and Lorentzen. This desire was partly motivated by homesickness and patriotism, but it was also suited to the public taste of the day for \"picturesque\" works.\n\nDahl traveled to Dresden in September 1818. He arrived with introductions to the city's leading citizens and to major artists such as Caspar David Friedrich , who helped him establish himself there and became his close friend. One critic has written: \"Friedrich's still, meticulously executed landscapes - products of an art informed by his strict Protestant upbringing and a seeking for the divine in nature - were justifiably famous by the time he and Dahl became acquainted. We are able to see his 'Two Men Contemplating the Moon' (1819), which ranks among his greatest works, and features two \"R\u00fcckfiguren,\" or figures seen from behind, solemnly and companionably gazing at a young sickle moon from the edge of an old forest. 'Greifswald in Moonlight' (1816-17) depicts the artist's birthplace in Pomerania, on the Baltic coast: bathed in an even, gauzy moonlight, the ancient university town assumes an almost ethereal appearance.\"\n\nTwo Men Contemplating the Moon by Caspar David Friedrich: 1819\n\nThis is the third version of one of this artist's most famous paintings, of which the first (1819) is in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Dresden, and the second (ca. 1824) is in the Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin. The two men contemplating the sinking moon have been identified as Friedrich himself, on the right, and his talented young colleague August Heinrich (1794-1822). The mood of pious contemplation relates to fascination with the moon as expressed in contemporary poetry, literature, philosophy, and music. Both figures are seen from the back so that the viewer can participate in their communion with nature, which the Romantics saw as a manifestation of the Sublime.\n\nAlthough the landscape is imaginary, it is based on studies after nature that Friedrich had made in various regions at different times. Both men wear Old German dress, which had been adopted in 1815 by radical students as an expression of opposition to the ultraconservative policies then being enforced in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars. The staunchly patriotic Friedrich deliberately ignored the 1819 royal decree forbidding this practice and depicted figures in traditional costume until his death.\n\nFriedrich was fourteen years Dahl's elder and an established artist, but the two found in each other a shared love for nature and a shared enthusiasm for a way of depicting nature that was based on the study of nature itself rather than on the academic clich\u00e9s that they both profoundly despised. One writer has put it this way: \"A warm and sociable character, he soon met and became friendly with the more introverted and reclusive Friedrich, recording how they once walked together in the park of the Gr\u00f6sser Garten among 'many lovely trees of different kinds and the moon looked beautiful behind the dark fir trees.'\"\n\nTogether with Friedrich and Carl Gustav Carus , Dahl would become one of the Dresden painters of the period who exerted a decisive influence on German Romantic painting.\n\nPortrait of Gustav by Julius Hubner: 1844\n\n\"most of all I am representing nature in all its freedom and wildness.\" Dahl found enough material in the Dresden area to supply motifs for his paintings, but he continued to paint imaginary landscapes with forests, mountains, and waterfalls. One such painting, completed in 1819, entitled \"Norsk fjellandskap med elv\" (Mountainous Norwegian landscape with river\"), garnered great attention among younger artists who considered the striking natural quality of the painting a breath of fresh air on Dresden's stagnant art scene. Another monumental waterfall painting, completed the next year, was lavished with praised by the critic for Kunstblatt who said that Dahl was greater than In Dresden, as in Copenhagen, Dahl traveled around the area to draw subjects that could be of use to him in larger works that would be painted later in his atelier. He wrote to Prince Christian Frederik in 1818 thatDahl found enough material in the Dresden area to supply motifs for his paintings, but he continued to paint imaginary landscapes with forests, mountains, and waterfalls. One such painting, completed in 1819, entitled(Mountainous Norwegian landscape with river\"), garnered great attention among younger artists who considered the striking natural quality of the painting a breath of fresh air on Dresden's stagnant art scene. Another monumental waterfall painting, completed the next year, was lavished with praised by the critic for Kunstblatt who said that Dahl was greater than Jacob van Ruisdael . Dahl was accepted into the Dresden academy in 1820.\n\nNorwegian Mountain Landscape: 1819\n\nPrince Christian Frederik wrote to Dahl in 1820 from Italy and invited him to join him at the Gulf of Naples. Dahl was at the time courting a young woman named Emilie von Bloch, but felt he should take the prince up on his offer, so he married Emilie quickly and traveled to Italy the next day. He ended up spending 10 months in Italy. Though he missed his bride, the sojourn was a decisive factor in his artistic development. It was in Italy, with its strong southern light that Dahl's art truly flowered. It forced him to see nature plain, without the mediation of the old masters' renderings of light and color.\n\nDahl went to Rome in February 1821. He spent a great deal of time visiting museums, meeting other artists, and painting pictures to sell. In addition to painting sights in Rome and pictures of the Gulf of Naples, he painted landscapes inspired by the mountains of Norway. Dahl said that not until he was in Rome did he truly appreciate Norwegian nature. In June 1821 Dahl returned north to Emilie and a quiet life of family and painting.\n\nGrotto near Naples: 1821\n\nEruption of Vesuvius: 1823\n\nGulf of Naples Seen from a Cave: 1821\n\nStudy of Clouds at Full Moon: 1822\n\nCoast near Castellammare in the Morning Mist: 1822\n\nMausoleum of San Vito near Pozzuoli: 1820\n\nScene of the Villa Malta: 1821\n\nThe Eruption of Vesuvius: 1824\n\nThe Eruption of Vesuvius: 1826\n\nVesuvius Seen from Castellsmmare: 1820\n\nVesuvius Seen from Castellsmmare: 1821\n\nView from a Window at Quisisana: 1820\n\nView of Naples' Bay: 1823\n\nVolcano at Evening, Siciliy: Date Unknown\n\nDahl quickly became a member of Dresden's leading circles of poets, artists, and scientists, among them the archeologist C. A. B\u00f6ttiger, publisher of Artistisches Notizenblatt, who ran a major article on Dahl in 1822.\n\n\"extraordinary professors\" who had no chair but who received a regular salary. In 1823 Dahl moved in with Friedrich, so that many of his students, such as Bay of Naples in 1821 when Mount Vesuvius was active. Here he painted 'Boats on the Beach Near Naples', where fishing crafts lie at anchor in the calm, shimmering waters with the twin peaks of the mountain smoking and flaming behind. Predictably, after his close association with Friedrich began - the two families shared a house in Dresden from 1823 - he was considerably influenced by him, but his own more spontaneous and painterly style soon prevailed. Clients sometimes commissioned pictures from them both, a tranquil coastal scene by Friedrich to pair with a stormier subject from Dahl.\" As a member of the academy, Dahl always gave of his time to young artists who sought him out. In 1824 he and Friedrich were namedwho had no chair but who received a regular salary. In 1823 Dahl moved in with Friedrich, so that many of his students, such as Knud Baade Peder Balke , and Thomas Fearnley , were equally influenced by both artists. \"Well before their meeting,\" writes one critic, \"Dahl had also painted a number of 'moonlights' and, travelling in Europe, he was in thewhen Mount Vesuvius was active. Here he painted 'Boats on the Beach Near Naples', where fishing crafts lie at anchor in the calm, shimmering waters with the twin peaks of the mountain smoking and flaming behind. Predictably, after his close association with Friedrich began - the two families shared a house in Dresden from 1823 - he was considerably influenced by him, but his own more spontaneous and painterly style soon prevailed. Clients sometimes commissioned pictures from them both, a tranquil coastal scene by Friedrich to pair with a stormier subject from Dahl.\"\n\nDahl never formed a \"school\" around himself, but rather preferred for his students to cultivate their own styles; it was against his principles and his respect for artistic freedom to try to inhibit his students' individuality. It was this impulse toward individuality that later caused him to turn down an offer of a permanent chair at the academy - he didn't want to feel compelled to show up for class when he was busy working on a painting.\n\nDahl continued his studies of nature in the area around Dresden when he had the time, or on longer trips which provided him with themes for his paintings. But most often he painted the view of the Elbe outside his windows in various kinds of light. Like Constable, Dahl felt that the sky was an important part of a landscape painting, and he never grew tired of watching the clouds move over the flat plain. One critic has compared two paintings of Friedrich and Dahl: \"In...Dahl's 'Mother and Child by the Sea', there are echoes of Friedrich's 'Woman by the Sea' (1818). Whereas in Friedrich's work a woman dressed for the windy weather sits idly watching five fishing boats sailing past, in Dahl's picture, there seems to be a more personal note, with echoes of his own upbringing in a seafaring community, as the mother and small child eagerly await the return of the little ship from the sea.\" The same critic has written about one of his paintings of Dresden: \"Dahl also commemorated the magnificent Baroque buildings of his adopted city, and a version of his 'View of Dresden by Moonlight' (1838) has travelled from the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo. This small picture, measuring only 18.5 x 34.5 cm, shows the dome of the Frauenkirche and the tower of the Hofkirche dominating the skyline; silvers and deep blue combine to give it a wonderful jewel-like effect, together with a certain elegiac quality, perhaps indicative of the artist's awareness that his long friendship with Friedrich was nearing an end.\"\n\nMother and Child by the Sea: 1830\n\nMother and Child by the Sea: 1840\n\nView of Dresden by Moonlight: 1838\n\nAs Dahl wrote in 1828 to the director of the Dresden academy, he found the area around Dresden useful for nature studies, but the \"real thing\" was always missing; that was something he could only find in his mountainous homeland. He viewed himself as a \"more Nordic painter\" with a \"love for seacoasts, mountains, waterfalls, sailboats, and pictures of the sea in daylight and moonlight.\" He longed to return to Norway, but not until 1826 was he able to make a journey home.\n\nHe made subsequent trips to Norway in 1834, 1839, 1844, and 1850, mostly exploring and painting the mountains, leading to the monumental works Fortundalen (1836) and Stalheim (1842). During his visits to Norway he received \"an enthusiastic welcome as a painter of renown.\"\n\nView of Fortundalen: 1836\n\nStalheim: 1842\n\nA critic notes Dahl's late stylistic changes: \"In his late 'Fjord at Sunset' (1850), based on studies made earlier, free and adventurous brush strokes represent the cloud-swept sky and broken surface of the water. Here he has moved far away from the purity and intensity of Friedrich's oeuvre.\"\n\nIn 1827 Emilie Dahl died in childbirth while having their fourth child, and two years later two of the older children died of scarlet fever. In January 1830 Dahl married his student Amalie von Bassewitz, but she, too, died in childbirth in December of that same year. Dahl was crushed, and many months passed before he was able to paint again. Some years later this youngest child also died, leaving Dahl with two surviving children, Caroline and Siegwald.\n\nDahl's trip to Norway in 1850 would be his last. He was aging and weak, but continued to paint landscapes in the mountains. This last journey to his homeland resulted in several magnificent works, including M\u00e5bodalen, Fra Stugunoset, and Hjelle i Valdres.\n\nDahl was also among the founding fathers of the National Gallery of Norway (Norwegian: Nasjonalgalleriet ), now the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, and donated his own art collection to the institution. Together with Johan Sebastian Welhaven, Frederik Stang and Henrik Heftye, he also founded the Art Society in Oslo ( Oslo Kunstforening ).\n\nDahl died lonely and bitter after a brief illness and was buried on October 17, 1857, in Dresden. In 1902, a statue of Dahl by Norwegian sculptor Ambrosia Tonnesen (1859-1948), was erected on the facade of the Vestlandske kunstindustrimuseum in Bergen. In 1934, his remains brought back to Norway and buried in the cemetery of St. Jacob's Church (Sankt Jakob Kirke) in Bergen.\n\nJ.C. Dahl occupies a central position in Norwegian artistic life of the first half of the 19th century. His Romantic yet naturalistic interpretations of Norwegian scenery were greatly admired in Norway as well as on the European continent, particularly in Denmark and Germany. His place in the pantheon of European artists is secure and his influence on the course of art history is indelible.\n\nQuoted From: Johan Christian Dahl - Wikipedia Various Works of Johan (John) Christian Dahl Alpine Landscape: 1821 Avaldsnes Church: 1813 Avaldsnes Church: 1820 Birch in a Storm: 1849 Birch in a Storm: 1849 (Alternate View) Birch in Autumn Landscape: Date Unknown Birch Tree in Winter: 1838 Chalk Pit near Maxen: 1835 Cloud Study, Thunder Clouds over the Palace Tower at Dresden: 1825 Cloud Study: 1832 Cloud Study with Horizon: 1832 Coastal Landscape with Burial Mounds and Standing Stones: 1837 Copenhagen Harbor in Moonlight: 1831 Copenhagen Harbor by Moonlight: 1846 Copenhagen Harbor by Twilight: 1846 Dresden at Night: 1845 Dresden at Night: 1845 (Alternate View) Dreyhaven near Copenhagen: 1845 (Alternate View Elbe Seen From Bruhls Terrace: 1824 Entrance to the Port of Copenhagen with the\n\nMasting Sheer seen to the right: 1830 Forest Fire Glows: 1846 Fredericksborg Castle: 1817 Frederiksborg Castle: 1814 Frederiksholms Canal in Copenhagen with Christian IV's Brewery: 1817 Holmestrand: 1843 Julie Vogel in the Garden: 1825-28 Labrofossen: 1829 Lake Esrom by Moonlight: 1814 Landscape at Kaupanger with stave church: 1847 Landscape in Evening Light Landscape with Memorial Stones: 1839 Larvik, Vestfold County, Norway: 1848 Lyshornet near Bergen: 1836 Maridalen: 1852 Megalith Grave near Vordingborg in Winter: 1824-25 M\u00f8ensklint: 1828 Mill in Liebethaler Grund: 1823 Morning after a Stormy Night: 1819 Mountain Landscape with a Castle: 1816 Northern Landscape: 1822 Norwegian Landscape, Rogna Waterfall: 1812 Norwegian Landscape: 1823 Norwegian Landscape: 1829 Norwegian Landscape with a Bridge: 1815 Norwegian Mountain Landscape with Waterfall: 1821 Pedersborg: 1832 Plauenscher Grund: 1819 Prospect of Dresden Seen from Pieschen, March Haze: 1844 Shipwreck on the Coast of Norway: 1832 Shipwreck on the Coast of Norway: 1829 Shipwreck on the Coast of Norway: 1831 Stormy Day in Dresden: 1830 Stugun\u00f8set, Filefjeld: 1851 The Elbe and Dresden Neustadt in the Evening Light: 1837 The Elbe Valley near Dresden: Date Unknown The Frankenkirche, Dresden: 1840 The Grosser Garten, Dresden: 1822 The Lower Falls of the Labrofoss: 1827 Thunderstorm Near Dresden: 1830 Trolltindene: 1823 Two Belfries at Sunset, Copenhagen: 1825 View from Bastei: 1819 View from Vaekero near Christiania: 1827 View of Naerodalen: 1847 View of \u00d8ylo Farm, Valdres: 1846 View over Hallingdal: 1844 View of Swinoujscie: 1840 View of the Feigumfoss in Lysterfjord: 1848 View over the Elbe and the 'Der B\u00e4r' Bastion: Date Unknown Watzmann: 1825 Waves and Breakers in the Bay of Naples: 1821 Winter Landscape near Vordingborg: 1829 Related Source Material : Johan Christian Dahl Online Johan Christian Dahl -

Located close to M\u00f8ns Klint on the north-eastern corner of the Danish island of M\u00f8n, it is regarded as one of the finest examples in Scandinavia of the English Romantic garden. Designed by the Danish landscape architect Andreas Kirkerup, the park was commissioned in the 1790s by French Huguenot nobleman Antoine de Bosc de la Calmette for his wife Elisabeth, commonly known as Lisa. Liselund, roughly translated, means Lise's grove. The park was the inspiration for writers and artists, including Hans Christian Andersen, whose 1829 poem Klintekorset paa M\u00f8en or M\u00f8n's Cliff Cross was inspired by the large wooden cross at the edge of the cliff, seen in Dahl's painting, and in a painting of the same title by C.

C. Dahl or I. C. Dahl, was a Danish-Norwegian artist who is considered the first great romantic painter in Norway, the founder of the \"golden age\" of Norwegian painting, and, by some, one of the greatest European artists of all time. He is often described as \"the father of Norwegian landscape painting\" and is regarded as the first Norwegian painter to reach a level of artistic accomplishment comparable to that attained by the greatest European artists of his day. He was also the first to acquire genuine fame and cultural renown abroad. As one critic has put it, \"J.C. Dahl occupies a central position in Norwegian artistic life of the first half of the 19th century.\n\nAlthough Dahl spent much of his life outside of Norway, his love for his country is clear in the motifs he chose for his paintings and in his extraordinary efforts on behalf of Norwegian culture generally. He was, for example, a key figure in the founding of the Norwegian National Gallery and of several other major art institutions in Norway, as well as in the preservation of Norwegian stave churches and the restoration of the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim and Bergenhus Fortress in Bergen.\n\nDahl came from a simple background \u2013 his father was a modest fisherman in Bergen, Norway \u2013 and he would later look back at his youth with bitterness. He regretted that he never had a \"real teacher\" in his childhood and, despite all his spectacular success, he believed that if he had been more fortunate in his birth, he would have achieved even more than he had.\n\nAs a boy, Dahl was educated by a sympathetic mentor at the Bergen Cathedral who at first thought that this bright student would make a good priest, but then, recognizing his remarkably precocious artistic ability, arranged for him to be trained as an artist. From 1803 to 1809 Dahl studied with the painter Johan Georg M\u00fcller [no], whose workshop was the most important one in Bergen at the time. Still, Dahl looked back on his teacher as having kept him in ignorance in order to exploit him, putting him to work painting theatrical sets, portraits, and views of Bergen and its surroundings. Another mentor, Lyder Sagen, showed the aspiring artist books about art and awakened his interest in historical and patriotic subjects. It was also Sagen who took up a collection that made it possible for Dahl to go to Copenhagen in 1811 to complete his education at the academy there.\n\nAs important as Dahl's studies at the academy in Copenhagen were his experiences in the surrounding countryside and in the city's art collections. In 1812 he wrote to Sagen that the landscape artists he most wished to emulate were Ruisdahl and Everdingen, and for that reason he was studying \u201cnature above all,\u201d Dahl's artistic program was, then, already in place: he would become a part of the great landscape tradition, but he would also be as faithful as possible to nature itself.\n\nDahl held that a landscape painting should not just depict a specific view, but should also say something about the land's nature and character \u2013 the greatness of its past and the life and work of its current inhabitants. The mood was often idyllic, often melancholy. When he added snow to a landscape he painted in the summer, it was not to show the light and colors of snow; it was to use snow as a symbol of death. As one critic has put it, \u201cUnlike the radically Romantic works also appearing at the time, Dahl softens his landscape, introducing elements of genre painting by imbuing it with anecdotal materials: In the background a wisp of smoke rises from a cabin, perhaps the home of the hunter on the snow-covered field.\u201d Thanks to Sagen's recommendations and to his own personal charm, Dahl soon gained access to the leading social circles in Copenhagen.\n\nDahl took part in annual art exhibitions in Copenhagen beginning in 1812, but his real breakthrough came in 1815, when he exhibited no fewer than 13 paintings. Prince Christian Frederik of Denmark, who developed an early interest in Dahl's artistic genius and saw to it that his works were purchased for the royal collection, became a lifelong friend and patron of the artist.\n\nIn 1816 C. W. Eckersberg returned from abroad with his paintings of Roman settings; Dahl was impressed at once, and they became good friends and exchanged pictures. Dahl's 1817 painting Den Store Kro i Fredensborg marked the real beginning of his lifelong production of oil paintings depicting natural subjects.\n\nAfter his success in Copenhagen, Dahl realized that he wanted to live as an independent, self-supporting artist. One challenge facing him was that the academic preference of the day was for historical paintings with moral messages. Landscapes were considered the lowest kind of art, and perhaps even not as art at all, but as a purely mechanical imitation of nature. The only landscapes that could be considered art, according to the academy, were ideal, imaginary landscapes in pastoral or heroic styles. In accordance with this reigning taste, Dahl attempted to give his Danish themes a certain atmospheric character in order to lift them up above what was considered a merely commercial level. But at the same time it was his deepest wish to provide a more faithful picture of Norwegian nature than were offered by the old-fashioned, dry paintings of Haas and Lorentzen. This desire was partly motivated by homesickness and patriotism, but it was also suited to the public taste of the day for \u201cpicturesque\u201d works.\n\nDahl traveled to Dresden in September 1818. He arrived with introductions to the city's leading citizens and to major artists such as Caspar David Friedrich, who helped him establish himself there and became his close friend. One critic has written: \u201cFriedrich's still, meticulously executed landscapes - products of an art informed by his strict Protestant upbringing and a seeking for the divine in nature - were justifiably famous by the time he and Dahl became acquainted. We are able to see his Two Men Contemplating the Moon (1819), which ranks among his greatest works, and features two \"R\u00fcckfiguren,\" or figures seen from behind, solemnly and companionably gazing at a young sickle moon from the edge of an old forest. 'Greifswald in Moonlight' (1816\u201317) depicts the artist's birthplace in Pomerania, on the Baltic coast: bathed in an even, gauzy moonlight, the ancient university town assumes an almost ethereal appearance.\u201d\n\nFriedrich was fourteen years Dahl's elder and an established artist, but the two found in each other a shared love for nature and a shared enthusiasm for a way of depicting nature that was based on the study of nature itself rather than on the academic cliches that they both profoundly despised. One writer has put it this way: \u201cA warm and sociable character, he soon met and became friendly with the more introverted and reclusive Friedrich, recording how they once walked together in the park of the Gr\u00f6sser Garten among 'many lovely trees of different kinds, and the moon looked beautiful behind the dark fir trees.'\u201d\n\nTogether with Friedrich and Carl Gustav Carus, Dahl would become one of the Dresden painters of the period who exerted a decisive influence on German Romantic painting.\n\nIn Dresden, as in Copenhagen, Dahl traveled around the area to draw subjects that could be of use to him in larger works that would be painted later in his atelier. He wrote to Prince Christian Frederik in 1818 that \u201cmost of all I am representing nature in all its freedom and wildness.\u201d Dahl found enough material in the Dresden area to supply motifs for his paintings, but he continued to paint imaginary landscapes with forests, mountains, and waterfalls. One such painting, completed in 1819, entitled Norsk fjellandskap med elv (Mountainous Norwegian landscape with river\u201d), garnered great attention among younger artists who considered the striking natural quality of the painting a breath of fresh air on Dresden's stagnant art scene. Another monumental waterfall painting, completed the next year, was lavished with praised by the critic for Kunstblatt who said that Dahl was greater than Jacob van Ruisdael. Dahl was accepted into the Dresden academy in 1820.\n\nPrince Christian Frederik wrote to Dahl in 1820 from Italy and invited him to join him at the Gulf of Naples. Dahl was at the time courting a young woman named Emilie von Bloch, but felt he should take the prince up on his offer, so he married Emilie quickly and traveled to Italy the next day. He ended up spending 10 months in Italy. Though he missed his bride, the sojourn was a decisive factor in his artistic development. It was in Italy, with its strong southern light, that Dahl's art truly flowered. It forced him to see nature plain, without the mediation of the old masters' renderings of light and color.\n\nDahl went to Rome in February 1821. He spent a great deal of time visiting museums, meeting other artists, and painting pictures to sell. In addition to painting sights in Rome and pictures of the Gulf of Naples, he painted landscapes inspired by the mountains of Norway. Dahl said that not until he was in Rome did he truly appreciate Norwegian nature. In June 1821 Dahl returned north to Emilie and a quiet life of family and painting.\n\nDahl quickly became a member of Dresden's leading circles of poets, artists, and scientists, among them the archeologist C. A. B\u00f6ttiger, publisher of Artistisches Notizenblatt, who ran a major article on Dahl in 1822.\n\nAs a member of the academy, Dahl always dedicated his time to young artists who sought him out. In 1824 he and Friedrich were named \u201cextraordinary professors\u201d who had no chair but who received a regular salary. In 1823 Dahl moved in with Friedrich, so that many of his students, such as Knud Baade, Peder Balke, and Thomas Fearnley, were equally influenced by both artists. \u201cWell before their meeting,\u201d writes one critic, \u201cDahl had also painted a number of 'moonlights' and, travelling in Europe, he was in the Bay of Naples in 1821 when Mount Vesuvius was active. Here he painted 'Boats on the Beach Near Naples', where fishing crafts lie at anchor in the calm, shimmering waters with the twin peaks of the mountain smoking and flaming behind. Predictably, after his close association with Friedrich began\u2014the two families shared a house in Dresden from 1823\u2014he was considerably influenced by him, but his own more spontaneous and painterly style soon prevailed. Clients sometimes commissioned pictures from them both, a tranquil coastal scene by Friedrich to pair with a more stormy subject from Dahl.\u201d\n\nDahl never formed a \u201cschool\u201d around himself, but rather preferred for his students to cultivate their own styles; it was against his principles and his respect for artistic freedom to try to inhibit his students' individuality. It was this impulse toward individuality that later caused him to turn down an offer of a permanent chair at the academy \u2013 he didn't want to feel compelled to show up for class when he was busy working on a painting.\n\nDahl continued his studies of nature in the area around Dresden when he had the time, or on longer trips which provided him with themes for his paintings. But most often he painted the view of the Elbe outside his windows in various kinds of light. Like John Constable, Dahl felt that the sky was an important part of a landscape painting, and he never grew tired of watching the clouds move over the flat plain. One critic has compared two paintings of Friedrich and Dahl: \u201cIn...Dahl's 'Mother and Child by the Sea', there are echoes of Friedrich's 'Woman by the Sea' (1818). Whereas in Friedrich's work a woman dressed for the windy weather sits idly watching five fishing boats sailing past, in Dahl's picture, there seems to be a more personal note, with echoes of his own upbringing in a seafaring community, as the mother and small child eagerly await the return of the little ship from the sea.\u201d The same critic has written about one of his paintings of Dresden: \u201cDahl also commemorated the magnificent Baroque buildings of his adopted city, and a version of his View of Dresden by Moonlight (1838) has travelled from the National Museum of Art, Architecture, and Design in Oslo. This small picture, measuring only 18.5 x 34.5 cm, shows the dome of the Frauenkirche and the tower of the Hofkirche dominating the skyline; silvers and deep blue combine to give it a wonderful jewel-like effect, together with a certain elegiac quality, perhaps indicative of the artist's awareness that his long friendship with Friedrich was nearing an end.\u201d\n\nAs Dahl wrote in 1828 to the director of the Dresden academy, he found the area around Dresden useful for nature studies, but the \u201creal thing\u201d was always missing; that was something he could only find in his mountainous homeland. He viewed himself as a \u201cmore Nordic painter\u201d with a \u201clove for seacoasts, mountains, waterfalls, sailboats, and pictures of the sea in daylight and moonlight.\u201d He longed to return to Norway, but not until 1826 was he able to make a journey home.\n\nHe made subsequent trips to Norway in 1834, 1839, 1844, and 1850, mostly exploring and painting the mountains, leading to the monumental works Fortundalen (1836) and Stalheim (1842). During his visits to Norway he received \u201can enthusiastic welcome as a painter of renown.\u201d\n\nA critic notes Dahl's late stylistic changes: \u201cIn his late Fjord at Sunset (1850), based on studies made earlier, free and adventurous brush strokes represent the cloud-swept sky and broken surface of the water. Here he has moved far away from the purity and intensity of Friedrich's oeuvre.\u201d\n\nIn 1827 Emilie Dahl died in childbirth while having their fourth child, and two years later two of the older children died of scarlet fever. In January 1830, Dahl married his student Amalie von Bassewitz, but she, too, died in childbirth in December of that same year. Dahl was crushed, and many months passed before he was able to paint again. Some years later this youngest child also died, leaving Dahl with two surviving children, Siegwald and Caroline, who married the Norwegian minister Anders Sand\u00f8e \u00d8rsted Bull 1848.\n\nDahl's trip to Norway in 1850 would be his last. He was aging and weak, but continued to paint landscapes in the mountains. This last journey to his homeland resulted in several magnificent works, including M\u00e5b\u00f8dalen, Fra Stugun\u00f8set, and Hjelle i Valdres.\n\nDahl was among the founding fathers of the National Gallery of Norway (Norwegian: Nasjonalgalleriet), now the National Museum of Art, Architecture, and Design, and donated his own art collection to the institution. Together with Johan Sebastian Welhaven, Frederik Stang, and Henrik Heftye, he founded the Art Society in Oslo (Oslo Kunstforening).\n\nDahl died after a brief illness and was buried on 17 October 1857 in Dresden. In 1902, a statue of Dahl by Norwegian sculptor Ambrosia T\u00f8nnesen (1859\u20131948) was erected on the facade of the West Norway Museum of Decorative Art in Bergen. In 1934, his remains were brought back to Norway and buried in the cemetery of St. Jacob's Church (Sankt Jakob kirke) in Bergen.\n\nJ.C. Dahl occupies a central position in Norwegian artistic life of the first half of the 19th century. His Romantic yet naturalistic interpretations of Norwegian scenery were greatly admired in Norway as well as on the European continent, particularly in Denmark and Germany."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiart.org/en/johan-christian-dahl/stalheim-1842", "page_content": "View from Stalheim (Norwegian: Fra Stalheim) is an 1842 oil painting by J. C. Dahl of the mountainous view from Stalheim, Voss, Hordaland. It is a major work of Romantic nationalism and has become a national icon. It is regarded as one of Dahl's best works.\n\n\n\nThe painting shows the view from the peak at Stalheim over the N\u00e6r\u00f8y Valley towards the sugar-loaf shaped peak of Jordalsnuten in late afternoon sunshine, framed by peaks and a rainbow. The sun shines on a small village near the centre. Dahl has clearly delineated figures and buildings even in the distance, creating \"a world in miniature\". One of his purposes was realism; the other was to capture the glory and magnificence of the mountains, and associated with that, of his country's culture. In this evocation of grandeur the painting prefigures later US landscapes, in particular Church's Rainy Season in the Tropics (1866), which has a similar crowning rainbow. The rainbow itself, a symbol of reconciliation, peace, and in Christianity of God's grace, was also frequently used by Joseph Anton Koch and by Dahl's friend and associate Caspar David Friedrich.\n\n\n\nDahl began work on the painting in 1836 and completed it in 1842. It is based on two pencil and watercolour sketches he had made from the Gudvangen road in July 1826 during his first visit to the high mountain regions of Norway. The final version is close to the studies in both composition and details, including the sunlight highlighting the village; but Dahl has intensified the imagery by narrowing the valley, giving more prominence to the Jordalsnuten peak and less to the reappearance of the river from the shadows.\n\n\n\nDahl had trouble with the painting and avoided similarly large works after its completion.\n\n\n\nThe painting was made for Countess Wedel of Bogstad. Carl Gustav Wedel-Jarlsberg gave it to the National Gallery of Norway in 1914.\n\n\n\nThe painting is regarded as one of Dahl's best, perhaps his most successful realisation of his aim of depicting the mountains both realistically and as national symbols. It has become a national icon. Other painters have also depicted the scene, and even more than his other Norwegian landscapes, this one drove tourists to visit the site: the luxury hotel built at Stalheim in 1885 is attributable to it.\n\nThis is a part of the Wikipedia article used under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA).
