{"Adiele Afigbo was a Nigerian historian and professor of African history at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.": [{"url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137311290_7", "page_content": "Adiele Afigbo, \u201cThe Warrant Chief System in Eastern Nigeria, 1900-1929\u201d (Ph.D. thesis, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria, 1964).\n\nThe University of Nigeria, Nsukka was closed between 1967 and January 1970 due to the war.\n\nFor the compelling case Adiele Afigbo made for the establishment of a Pan-Igbo Center for Igbo Studies, and for the propagation of Igbo studies, see A. E. Afigbo, Obi Ikenga: The Case for a Pan-Igbo Centre for Igbo Studies(Uturu, Nigeria: Abia State University, 2000).\n\nThe Ahiajoku Lecture Series, which was inaugurated on November 30, 1979, was designed to offer the Igbo a rare opportunity to annually gather and harness the intellectual richness of the people through public lectures by the most erudite of Igbo scholars. It is an annual intellectual harvest in which a distinguished Igbo scholar is selected to educate and share an important aspect of Igbo life and culture related to the lecturer\u2019s expertise. Thus, Ahiajoku lecturers have focused on Igbo political, economic, cultural, social, technological, philosophical and historical experiences, as well as the people\u2019s interactions and encounters with non-Igbo ethnic groups in Nigeria, and with the Europeans. It is an occasion to celebrate the collective Igbo achievements.\n\nFor more information on this Directorate, see Arthur A. Nwankwo, Nigeria: The Challenge of Biafra, 3rd edition (Enugu, Nigeria: Fourth Dimension Publishers, 1980), 26\u201328.\n\nOnwuka Njoku, \u201cExploring a Darkly Tunnel: Twenty-Six Years of Afigbo at Nsukka, 1966\u20131992,\u201d in Toyin Falola and Adam Paddock, eds., Emergent Themes and Methods in African Studies: Essays in Honor of Adiele E.

It is expected of an effective teacher or professor to strive to accommodate his or her students\u2019 individual differences and needs. But Afigbo was not for the mediocre or even average students. You must be above average and hardworking in order to survive Afigbo\u2019s scrutiny. The author started her doctoral thesis with Professor Afigbo, but did not complete the work with him due to no fault of theirs. Afigbo and the author worked very hard to complete the thesis, but it was not possible due to his retirement from the university in 1992.\n\nSee, for instance, E. Isichei, A History of the Igbo People(London: Macmillan, 1976), xiv. Here, she thanked Afigbo for the material he lent her and for giving her \u201cthe most unstinted and generous encouragement in a field of study which he has done so much to transform.\u201d\n\nBooks published by Adiele Afigbo, The Abolition of the Slave Trade in Southeastern Nigeria, 1885\u20131950(Rochester, NY: University of Rochester Press, 2006); The Igbo and their Neighbours: Inter-Group Relations in Southeastern Nigeria to 1953(Ibadan, Nigeria: University Press Limited, 1987); with S.

This prejudicial characterization of the region and the period suggests a lawless and unstable atmosphere incapable of fostering any meaningful commercial and intergroup exchanges. Yet, historical accounts have shown that the Aro, Awka, Abiriba, Nkwerre, Aboh, Nike, Nri, Igala, Ijo, Bonny, Nembe, Brass and the Efik triumphed in their business careers before the 1900.\n\nFor the practice of Igbandu, see Felicia Ekejiuba, \u201cIgba Ndu: An Igbo Mechanism of Social Control and Adjustment,\u201d African Notes8, no. 1 (1972): 9\u201324.\n\nSee Richard Henderson, The King in Every Man: Evolutionary Trends in Onitsha Ibo Society and Culture(New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1972); Austin Shelton, The Igbo-Igala Borderland: Religion and Social Control in Indigenous African Colonialism(Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1971); and John Boston, \u201cNotes on Contact between the Igala and the Ibo,\u201d Journal of the Historical Society of Nigeria2, no. 1 (1960): 52\u201358 on the impact of Igala culture on Nsukka Igbo; Basden, Niger Ibos on the Ijo and the conquest of southern Igbo; Mervin D.

His formal education began in 1944 at Methodist Central School, Ihube where he came under the influence of remarkably dedicated teachers, the most outstanding of whom was Mr. Oji Iheukumere, the head teacher, a native of Uzuakoli, in today's Abia State who was a noted church musician and disciplinarian. At Ihube Central School Afigbo's brilliance manifested early which made his teachers encourage him to go to secondary school in spite of the opposition of his parents who were intimidated by the cost of post-primary education. He succeeded in his bid and went to St. Augustine's (CMS) Grammar School, Nkwerre Orlu in Imo State.[citation needed] with an Okigwe Native Administration scholarship won in a competitive examination. There again he came across a crop of teachers who left a definite imprint on him. Foremost among those were Mazi F. C. Ogbalu, a teacher of Igbo language and culture and the founder of the Society for Promoting Igbo Language and Culture, C.G.I. Eneli a history graduate of the University College, Ibadan and E. C. Ezekwesili, the principal of the college and a history graduate of the University of Southampton, UK. These three helped to determine his future academic career. From St. Augustine's Grammar School Afigbo gained admission to study history at University College, Ibadan (then affiliated with University of London), with a scholarship from the government of Eastern Nigeria. There again, he met scholars noted for their brilliance and beneficent influence \u2013 J.D. Omer-Cooper, J.C. Anene, J.F. Ade Ajayi and Kenneth Onwuka Dike. There were also his colleagues \u2013 Obaro Ikime and Philip Igbafe who not only read history with him, but with him went on to pioneer the \"made in Nigeria PhD\" at the infant University of Ibadan with the help of post-graduate scholarships awarded by the university to the best graduating students.[citation needed] Adiele Afigbo had not only graduated top of his class, but also was the first among his colleagues to complete his PhD With this, he became the first person ever to receive a doctoral degree from a Nigerian university.[1]\n\nEarly career\n\nOn obtaining the PhD, Afigbo was appointed a lecturer in history, a position he held for two years before fleeing to the University of Nigeria, Nsukka in the wake of the Nigerian civil war. During the duration of hostilities, he served in the Directorate for Propaganda of the Ministry of Information, Republic of Biafra. He resumed his interrupted academic duties after the war, and rose on the academic ladder \u2013 from Lecturer to Professor in 1972, thus reaching the top of his profession after only five years. A year after attaining to professorship, he was appointed the Head of the Department of History and Archaeology. The year after, he became also the Dean of the Faculty of Arts. On more than one occasion he held the Directorship of the Leo Hansbury Institute of African Studies. He held the following public appointments among others \u2013 pioneer Director of Research at the National Institute for policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, Jos; Commissioner first for Education and then for Local Government in the Government of Imo State; Chairman of the Michael Okpara College of Agriculture, Umuagwo in Imo State and Sole Administrator of the Alvan Ikoku College of Education, Owerri.[citation needed] He has also was awarded an Honorary Member of the Historical Association of Great Britain, Fellow of the Historical Society of Nigeria, the Nigerian National Order of Merit, the Fellowship of the Nigerian Academy of Letters. His traditional chieftaincy titles include Ogbute-Okewe-Ibe, Ogbuzuo, and Olaudah.\n\nWork as historian\n\nAfigbo was a historian of Africa, of Nigeria, of Southeastern Nigeria, and finally a historian of the Igbo. He was a political historian, an economic and social historian, and of historiography. Myth, History and Society, one of the three volumes of his essays edited by Toyin Falola is devoted to theorising on the methods of doing history in Africa, on the sources of history in Africa, on the place and purpose of history in Africa and other related issues. In many publications he sought to use the particular to illuminate the universal, and the universal to illuminate the particular. Thus, for instance, he used a detailed study of the textile process in Southern Nigeria to throw much helpful light on the socio-cultural dynamics of the societies of the region. In a similar manner he used the rise and expansion of the pre-colonial great states such as Benin to show that the so-called segmentary societies as well as the so-called mini-states of pre-colonial Africa are, among other things, fossilised reminders of the conditions from which the great states arose.[citation needed]\n\nAfigbo broke away from the action-reaction thesis that ruled the new African historiography when he joined the history profession. He did so by emphasising in his works basic reconstructionist history, the study of peoples and cultures in their own right.\n\nDeath\n\nAdiele Eberechukwu Afigbo died in Enugu, Nigeria in the early hours of Monday, 9 March 2009 after a brief illness.[2]\n\nWorks\n\nThe Warrant Chiefs: Indirect Rule in Southeastern Nigeria 1891\u20131929 (Longman, London, 1972)\n\n1891\u20131929 (Longman, London, 1972) Ropes of Sand: Studies in Igbo History and Culture (University Press Limited, Ibadan 1981)\n\n(University Press Limited, Ibadan 1981) The Igbo and Their Neighbours: Inter-group Relations In Southeastern Nigeria to 1953 (University Press Limited, Ibadan, 1987)\n\n(University Press Limited, Ibadan, 1987) Groundwork of Igbo History (Vista Books Limited, Lagos, 1992)\n\n(Vista Books Limited, Lagos, 1992) Image of the Igbo (Vista Books Limited, Lagos, 1992)\n\n(Vista Books Limited, Lagos, 1992) The Abolition of the Slave Trade in Southeastern Nigeria 1885\u20131950 (University of Rochester Press, 2006)\n\nCollected Works Edited by Toyin Falola\n\nNigerian History Politics and Affairs (Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2005)\n\n(Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2005) Igbo History and Society (Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2005)\n\n(Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2005) Myth, History and Society (Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2006)\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nOttenberg, S., Farmers and Townspeople in A Changing Nigeria (Spectrum Books Ltd, Ibadan, 2005) pp. 32\u201333, 50, 54, 84,101\n\nNorthrup, D.

Themes emphasized include pre-colonial and colonial history, inter-group relations, the Aro and the slave trade (1), the art and science of history in Africa, non-written-sources and the reconstruction of African history, history and nation-building.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAdiele Eberechukwu Afigbo is a Nigerian historian. He was made a historian by the men and forces that gave birth in the 1950s to the celebrated Ibadan School of History which for about three decades was the most prominent school of history in Africa. He developed to become a prominent member of that school, which devoted its time to preaching and demonstrating the possibility of and the necessity for African history and historiography as a specific genre of the world branch of knowledge known as history. In pursuing the mission of this school through teaching, research, writing and publication Adiele Afigbo produced a wide variety of works which established inter alia the possibilities of basic reconstructionist history, of African historical methodologies and of the close link between the art and science of history on the one hand and state formation and statecraft on the other. In the process he gave full rein to eclecticism with respect to sources and methods, using as the occasion demands and warrants elements from myth and other oral sources, from archaeology, linguistics, material artifacts and written sources (2). In the last analysis he defines a historian as a clinical student of human experience who seeks to tell the story as it is and to explain it. With respect to style and presentation he believes in lively narrative and analysis while heeding Aristotle's advice which says write in the language of the ordinary man but think like an intellectual.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nAdiele Eberechukwu Afigbo was born at Ihube, Okigwe , in present day Imo State . His formal education began in 1944 at the then famous Ihube Methodist Central School, Ihube where he came under the influence of remarkably dedicated teachers, the most outstanding of whom was Mr. Oji Iheukumere, the head teacher, a native of Uzuakoli, in today's Abia State who was a noted church musician and disciplinarian. At Ihube Central School Afigbo's brilliance manifested early which made his teachers to encourage him to go to a secondary school in spite of the opposition of his parents who were intimidated by the cost of post-primary education. He succeeded in his bid and went to St. Augustine's (CMS) Grammar School, Nkwerre Orlu in Imo State. with an Okigwe Native Administration scholarship won in a competitive examination. There again he came across a crop of dedicated teachers who left a definite imprint on him. Crying for mention are Mazi F,C. Ogbalu, a teacher of Igbo language and Culture and the founder of the famous Society for Promoting Igbo Language and Culture, Mr. C.G.I. Eneli a history graduate of the University College, Ibadan and Mr, E,C. Ezekwesili, the principal of the college and a history graduate of the University of Southampton, UK. These three helped to determine his future academic career. From St. Augustine's Grammar School Afigbo gained admission to the University College Ibadan with a scholarship from the government of Eastern Nigeria to read history under the then obtaining special relationship with the University of London . There again, he met remarkable scholars noted for their brilliance and beneficent influence \u2013 J.D. Omer-Cooper, J.C. Anene, J.F. Ade Ajayi and K.O. Dike. There were also his colleagues \u2013 Obaro Ikime and Philip Igbafe who not only read history with him, but with him went on to pioneer the \u201cmade in Nigeria PhD\u201d at the infant University of Ibadan with the help of post-graduate scholarship awarded by the university to the best graduating students. Adiele Afigbo had not only come on top of his class at the B.A. level, but also was the first of these colleagues to finish his Ph.D and thus the first to receive the Ph.D. degree from an indigenous Nigerian university since the world began! For this reason some of his friends refer to him as \u201ca national specimen\u201d\n\nEarly career\n\nOn obtaining the Ph.D. Adiele Afigbo was appointed a lecturer in his parent department of history, a position he held for two years before fleeing to the University of Nigeria , Nsukka in the wake of the Nigerian civil war. During the duration of hostilities he served in the Directorate for Propaganda of the Ministry of Information, Republic of Biafra. He promptly resumed his interrupted academic duties after the war and rose very fast on the academic ladder \u2013 Lecturer to Senior Lecturer in History in 1970 and Senior Lecturer to Professor in 1972, thus reaching the top of his profession after only five years input as an academic. He has been heard to jocosely complain that in all his working career he has had only two promotions! A year after attaining to professorship he was appointed the Head of the Department of History and Archaeology. The year after he became also the Dean of the Faculty of Arts. On more than one occasion he held the Directorship of the Leo Hansbury Institute of African Studies. At different times in the following years he held the following public appointments among others \u2013 pioneer Director of Research at the National Institute for policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, Jos; Commissioner first for Education and then for Local Government in the Government of Imo State; Chairman of the Michael Okpara College of Agriculture, Umuagwo in Imo State and Sole Administrator of the Alvan Ikoku College of Education, Owerri. He has also won many coveted academic honours : Honorary Member of the Historical Association of Great Britain, Fellow of the Historical Society of Nigeria, the Nigerian National Order of Merit, the (foundation) Fellowship of the Nigerian Academy of Letters. His traditional chieftaincy titles include Ogbute-Okewe-Ibe, Ogbuzuo, and Olaudah.\n\nWork as historian\n\nAny attempt to understand the work of Adiele Eberechukwu Afigbo as a historian must be made at many levels and from different directions. On the territorial level he is a historian of Africa, a historian of Nigeria, a historian of Southeastern Nigeria (3) and finally a historian of the Igbo. On the disciplinary front he is a political historian, an economic and social historian as well as a peculiarly fecund student of historiography. Myth, History and Society, one of the three volumes of his essays edited by Professor Toyin Falola is devoted to theorising on the methods of doing history in Africa, on the sources of history in Africa, on the place and purpose of history in Africa and other related issues (4). In many publications he sought to use the particular to illuminate the universal, and the universal to illuminate the particular. Thus, for instance, he used a detailed study of the textile process in Southern Nigeria to throw much helpful light on the socio-cultural dynamics of the societies of the region. In a similar manner he used the rise and expansion of the pre-colonial great states such as Benin to show that the so-called segmentary societies as well as the so-called mini-states of pre-colonial Africa are, among other things, fossilized reminders of the conditions from which the great states arose.\n\nAdiele Eberechukwu Afigbo broke away early from the action-reaction thesis that ruled the new African historiography when he joined the history profession. He did so by emphasizing in his works basic reconstructionist history, the study of peoples and cultures in their own right instead of, as he put it, seeking to put the battle dress of Saul on his little David; the study of inter-group relations as a fruitful approach to understanding pre-colonial African societies; the dynamic and multi-faceted character of myths and traditions and thus the need for scholars to adapt their methods accordingly; the recognition of historical studies as a form of statecraft while not making history the slave of politics and politicians (5). Perhaps it is this richly diversified approach to history, to historical studies and historical sources that helps to explain the range and volume of his publications which some of his colleagues have found astounding bearing in mid the environment of lack and deprivation in which African academics operate.\n\nWorks\n\n* The Warrant Chiefs: Indirect Rule in Southeastern Nigeria 1891-1929 (Longman, London, 1972\n\n* Ropes of Sand: Studies in Igbo History and Culture (University Press Limited, Ibadan 1981)\n\n* The Igbo and Their Neighbours: Inter-group Relations In Southeastern Nigeria to 1953 (University Press Limited, Ibadan, 1987)\n\n* Groundwork of Igbo History (Vista Books Limited, Lagos,1992)\n\n* Image of the Igbo (vista Books Limited, Lagos, 1992)\n\n* The Abolition of the Slave Trade in Southeastern Nigeria 1885-1950 (University of Rochester Press, 2006)\n\nCollected Works Edited by Toyin Falola\n\n* Nigerian History Politics and Affairs (Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2005)\n\n* Igbo History and Society (Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2005)\n\n* Myth, History and Society (Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2006)\n\nReferences\n\n* Ottenberg, S., Farmers and Townspeople in A Changing Nigeria (Spectrum Books Ltd, Ibadan, 2005) pp.32-33, 50, 54, 84,101\n\nNorthrup, D.
