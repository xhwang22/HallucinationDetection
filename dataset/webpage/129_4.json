Brentnall then bought an interest in the Brisbane Telegraph, and joined the literary staff, becoming Chairman of the Company upon the retirement of the Honorary James Cowlishaw in October 1885. Brentnall was a director of several companies, including the Queensland Deposit Bank and Building Society, and the Queensland General Insurance Company, Limited.

His ca\n\nreer was a distinguished one, divided be\n\ntween service to ? the Church and to the\n\n- State. :\n\nThe Horn. Frederick Thomas Brentnall,\n\nWho was the son of the late Mr. and Mrs.\n\nGeorge' Brentnall, of Reddings, in Derby\n\nshire, was born on June 17, 1834.- His fa\n\nther was a builder, and he was educated at\n\nAlfreton,. also in Derbyshire. He. was the\n\neldest of 12 children, and his father also was\n\nthe eldest of 12. After leaving school he\n\nresided at Bishop Auckland, in Durham\n\nshire, and later was engaged in business at\n\n'Ripley, in Derbyshire, until he entered the\n\nWesleyan ministry. In 1863, when in his\n\n29th year, he and nine other young m'en\n\nwere sent by the British Wesleyan cOnfe\n\nence to. New South Wales to . strengthen t'!e\n\nministerial ranks of that denomination and\n\nhe ?arrived in Sydney in October, 1863. In\n\n1867 he was married to Miss Elizabeth Wat\n\nson, of Mansfield, Nottingham, who had held\n\nthe position of head mistress of a large\n\nWesleyan day .school for girls at Bacup,\n\n.?in Lancashire, and went' to Sydney to be\n\nmarried. The Rev. F. T. Brentnall, six\n\nyears later, was appointed by the New\n\nSouth Wales conference to the Brisbane cir\n\ncuit, and he arrived in Brisbane with his\n\nWife and two young daughters on April IS,\n\n1873. Three years later he was transferred\n\nto the Fortitude Valley Circuit. His next\n\ncircuit was Ipswich, where he remained for\n\ntwo years. In 1875 he, with the late Revs.\n\n.. E. Griffith, Colin McCulloch and D. F. Mit\n\nchell promoted a religious weekly newspa\n\nper named the 'Evangelical Standard.' That\n\n. Was the time when the struggle between\n\nthe advocates^ of denominational and State\n\n. schools was at its height, the result being\n\nthat the present State system of education\n\nwas firmly established in Queensland. The\n\neditorial quartette abovenanied fought\n\nthroughout against .. denominationalism in\n\neducation. In 1883 Mr. Brentnall had to\n\nretire from the ministry, a throat affection\n\ncausing the failure of his voice. He left\n\nthe ministry with, a record of 20 years' good\n\nservice. He ? was a forceful and eloquent\n\n]:-re.acher, and in the 10 years of his min- .\n\nistry in Queensland he did much to free\n\nthe Churches of his district from the hind\n\nrance due to debt. In 1881 he joined the\n\nTelegraph Newspaper Company as business\n\n' manager and contributor. In 1885 on the\n\nretirement of the Hon. James Cowlishaw, he\n\nbecame managing director of*, the 'Tele-\n\ngraph' Newspaper Company, and he held\n\nthat position till 1893, when he withdrew\n\n? from all active participation in the com\n\npany's affairs. In 1887 he visited England\n\n. and attended, the jubilee thanksgiving ser\n\nvice in Westminster Abbey. He was the\n\nbearer of an address of loyalty from Queens\n\nland to Queen 'Victoria. There were two\n\n? important events in the history of Queens\n\nland in which Mr. Brentnall's facile but\n\ntrenchant pen was used with telling effect.\n\nThe first occurred in 1881, and was brought\n\nabout by what was known as the steel rails\n\nContract, in which the Ministry of the day\n\nwas allegedly involved. The other was\n\noccasioned by the late Sir Thomas M'll\n\nwraith's famous land grant railway propo-.\n\nsal, sarcastically termed ? the ' 'grid iron'\n\nrailway. On both- questions Mr. Brentnall\n\nWith his powerful, pen espoused the popu\n\nlar cause. On the 17th April, 1886 he was\n\nappointed a member of the Legislative\n\nCouncil, and in 1893 he was el\n\nected Chairman of Committees. , Three\n\nyears later he was re-elected to that po\n\nsition, ard again in 1899. Mr. Brentnall\n\ntor'- an active interest in local government,\n\nanc' was a member of the first Bulimba\n\nDr-'-ional Board. When shire councils\n\n?took.

He also was a\n\nmember of the executive council of the Fe\n\nderated Employers' Union of Queensland,\n\n' and was a fellow of the Royal Geographi\n\ncal Society of Australasia (Queensland). Mr,\n\nBrentnall also was extensively interested in\n\nthe mining industry of Queensland. In this\n\nregard it may be said that, though some of\n\nliis speculations wore profitable, many oth\n\ners were disastrous failures. ' During his\n\nlong life he held a large number of com\n\npany directorships, amongst them being the\n\nQueensland 'Deposit Bank and Building So\n\nciety, Queensland Trustees Limited, ?

The Council remained in the building until October 1925, when amalgamation of local governments occurred and Greater Brisbane was created. Since 1925, it has been used as a School of Arts.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Divisional Boards Act 1879 established 74 local authorities in Queensland with Coorparoo administered as Subdivision 3 of the Bulimba Divisional Board. Primary concerns of the board included the maintenance and improvement of roads and bridges, the Bulimba ferry and water supply to river villages. In 1888 Coorparoo was represented on the Bulimba Divisional Board by Frederick Thomas Brentnall, Frederick Wecker and John Douglas. These men, along with other Coorparoo residents, claimed that more could be accomplished for the locality. They resigned from the Board and led demands for the creation of the Coorparoo Shire. The Shire of Coorparoo was proclaimed on 27 October 1888.\n\n\u200b\n\nBy 1892 the Councillors decided that a Shire Hall was a necessity. Two allotments on the corner of Cavendish Road and Council (now Halstead) streets were purchased. Henry Wallace Atkinson, a local architect, designed the Hall and it was built by a Mr Allibone at a cost of \u00a3514, plus \u00a378 for architect's fees and \u00a314 for seating. The Council moved in on 7 October 1892.\n\n\u200b\n\nConstructed with gas fittings for six lamps, the Hall was the first gas lit building in the Shire, further, the first telephone in the district was installed on 1 November 1892. The Hall was hired out as a social club and played an important role in the social life of the district. The Roll of Honour was unveiled by James Stodart, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Logan on 24 June 1916. The honour board is dedicated to the men and women of the District who served in the World War I.\n\n\u200b\n\nWith the amalgamation of local government authorities and the establishment of Greater Brisbane in 1925, a new use was sought for the shire hall. Local residents organised to form a School of Arts committee and, in 1928, the Trustees of the School of Arts contracted to pay the Greater Brisbane City Council \u00a31000.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn 1930 the Trustees accepted the offer of the Avondale Lodge to build a side verandah on the north-west elevation. The Trustees paid \u00a3200 for the fabric. The new wing was officially opened by Trustee and politician Reginald King, the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Logan on 19 July 1930. In 1938, the stage was removed providing more space in the Hall and a small stage was constructed at the rear.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn 1946, the Brisbane City Council began asking for payment of \u00a3750 which was owing on the purchase price of the hall, the alternative was to hand in the Hall's keys. Revenue was raised through a variety of activities, including renting the hall to the Coorparoo Kindergarten, and by 1948 the fund stood at over \u00a3550. It was also at this time that the Coorparoo RSL suggested that they take over the Hall and its debts. Solicitor King drew up a new constitution for the two groups and in April 1956, the Minister of Public Lands and Crown Law Office approved the amalgamation and constitution. The Hall was subsequently renamed the Coorparoo School of Arts and RSL Memorial Hall.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe brick and stucco additions as the front of the Hall were initially rejected at a meeting of the School of Arts committee in December 1951, however, by July 1953, the Trustees' honorary architect, Eric Percival Trewern, had drawn up plans and specifications and called for tenders. Builder AA Lock's tender for \u00a3777 was accepted.\n\n\u200b\n\nCoorparoo School of Arts and RSL Memorial Hall continues to be used extensively by the community."}, {"url": "https://www.e-architect.com/england/beckfords-tower-bath-renewal", "page_content": "Beckford\u2019s Tower Bath Conservation, BPT News, Building Renewal Architects, Stenning & Co\n\nBeckford\u2019s Tower Bath Renewal\n\n12 July 2021\n\nLocation: Bath, in southwest England, UK\n\nBeckford\u2019s Tower building in the landscape:\n\n\n\nphoto \u00a9 Tom Burrows\n\nOur Tower Bath News\n\nBath Preservation Trust appoints Design Team for Beckford\u2019s Tower\n\nBath Preservation Trust (BPT) has announced that architects Thomas Ford & Partners and quantity surveyors Stenning & Co have been appointed to lead the design work for the \u00a33.3 million Our Tower project.\n\nThe Our Tower plan, which is funded by Historic England and The National Lottery Heritage Fund, will address urgent repair and conservation works required to the almost 200-year-old Grade I listed Beckford\u2019s Tower, that stands above the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Bath and is the only museum dedicated to William Beckford in the world.\n\nBorn in 1760, William Beckford was a colourful and controversial character.

At just 10-years old he inherited his father\u2019s fortune, which included the Fonthill estate and several sugar plantations in Jamaica. His wealth gave him the freedom to pursue his interests in art, architecture, writing and music.\n\nIn 1782, Beckford undertook a Grand Tour, which inspired his travel writing and passion for collecting which continued throughout his life \u2013 especially when exiled to Europe for 10 years following the exposure of his relationship with William Courtenay (1784).\n\nIn 1826 William Beckford commissioned an extraordinary landscape back home in Bath \u2013 a Garden between his Lansdown Crescent home and the retreat now known as Beckford\u2019s Tower, where he could escape from the city within the natural environment. The Tower was created to house his library, art collection and every day Beckford would ride up there from his home, accompanied by his pack of spaniels. This expanse became known as Beckford\u2019s Ride, a mile of interlinked gardens.\n\nBeckford\u2019s grave in Bath:\n\n\n\nphoto courtesy Bath Preservation Trust\n\nBeckford\u2019s Tower stands in an exposed location and, like many historic buildings, almost two centuries of exposure to weather, pollution, and the challenges of climate change, now threaten the fabric of the building. There is now an urgent need for repair and conservation, particularly to address water ingress at high level within the belvedere & lantern. Beckford\u2019s Tower was added to the Historic England \u2018Heritage at Risk\u2019 Register in October 2019.\n\nOur Tower will bring new parts of the tower into use, and upgrade services and visitor infrastructure. BPT will also use the project as an opportunity to develop the visitor experience, engage wider audiences and reconnect the Tower with its lost landscape, through new experiences, interpretation, and access. A development grant awarded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund is also enabling Bath Preservation Trust to re-examine the way in which they share the story of William Beckford\u2019s links to the transatlantic slave trade.\n\nOrnamental furniture in Mr Beckford\u2019s Collection, Views of Lansdown Tower, Plate XIV, 1844:\n\n\n\nimage : Beckford\u2019s Tower & Museum \u2013 Bath Preservation Trust\n\nThe project is scheduled to complete in winter 2023.\n\nLondon based conservation architects Thomas Ford & Partners are led by Clive England, who brings over 30 years\u2019 experience to the project.

Both bring huge conservation experience to this nationally important building, and we look forward to securing an exciting new future for this Bath landmark.\u201d\n\nClive England said: \u201cWe are delighted to be involved with BPT\u2019s Our Tower project. Beckford\u2019s Tower is a unique building, in a spectacular setting, with a fascinating history \u2013 exactly the type of project that every conservation architect dreams about!\u201d\n\nAdrian Stenning said \u201cI am very pleased to continue my relationship with the Bath Preservation Trust and in particular Beckford\u2019s Tower with which I have been involved for over 20 years. I look forward to this opportunity to not just repair the Tower, but to also open up & show its\u2019 story for a wider audience.\u201d\n\nSecuring the Design team is just the start of this project, with urgent fundraising now needed to ensure vital conservation work to the building and landscape takes place, to ensure today\u2019s visitors and future generations can continue to explore and enjoy this iconic Bath landmark.\n\nTower engraving, unknown 19th century:\n\n\n\nimage \u00a9 Beckford\u2019s Tower and Museum, Bath Preservation Trust\n\nBeckford\u2019s Tower Bath Refurbishment Team\n\nBath Preservation Trust\n\nBath Preservation Trust was set up in 1934 to safeguard the historic city of Bath.

Although using the title of building society, the bank never operated as a building society but rather provided building loans, bill financing and operated as a land bank. It was one of only six local banks and building societies established during the period 1863-87. These banks were founded principally as safeguards for maintaining Queenslanders\u2019 control over the colony\u2019s finances against inter-colonial or London interests. The establishment of the Bank also occurred during one of Brisbane\u2019s most significant population and building booms. According to Ronald Lawson, \u201cThe 1880s were a time of tremendous expansion for Brisbane. In one decade the population of the city almost trebled\u201d The other financial institutions were the Bank of Queensland (1863-66), the Queensland National Bank (1872-1948), the Royal Bank of Queensland (1885-1922), the Federal Building Land and Investment Society United and Deposit Bank (1887-1931) and the Brisbane Permanent Benefit Building and Investment Society (1874).\n\nThe Bank had a number of prominent citizens on its original Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Board, Berkley Basil Moreton, was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Council (MLC), as was Frederick Thomas Brentnall. John Donaldson was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly (MLA) and George Agnew eventually became a MLA. James Hipwood was the Mayor of Brisbane at the time of the Bank\u2019s establishment. The Board also included Justices of the Peace J. J. Kingsbury and Acheson Overend (future Booroodabin Divisional Board member), together with R. J. Cottell. Hugh Agnew was the first manager.\n\nThe Bank commenced its operations on 1 October 1886 from leased premises in the Albert Buildings at the corner of Adelaide and Albert Streets. It established a freehold land department that bought and sold land for development purposes, making a \u20a410,339 net profit in its first year. The company\u2019s reliance on land speculation, however, almost reduced it to insolvency during Queensland\u2019s 1893 bank crash. By 1897, staff salaries had to be reduced and directors\u2019 fees waived to keep the bank viable. In 1899, the Bank moved to the Adelaide Chambers at 42 Adelaide Street and by the following year the Bank was once again returning a profit. The Bank continued to experience problems, particularly as it held more assets (unsold land) than actual capital. No dividends had been paid to shareholders since 1892 and the company\u2019s stormy annual meetings were reported in the press, thereby reducing public confidence in the Bank. The first dividend in seventeen years was paid in 1919.\n\nBy the 1920s, the Queensland Deposit Bank and Building Society had become commonly known as the Queensland Deposit Bank. In 1920, the announcement of a new City Hall to be erected on land partly occupied by the Adelaide Chambers Building caused the Queensland Deposit Bank to look for new premises. A number of options were considered by the Board of Directors, including leasing space in the new City Hall, relocating the Bank to either an Ann or an Adelaide Street nearby site, or moving further up Adelaide Street to the Napier Automobile Company Building.\n\nThe economic prosperity of the 1920s, particularly in the local building industry, improved the Bank\u2019s financial position, allowing it to erect its own headquarters on an Albert Street site that was occupied by the single-storey premises of Henry Halliday\u2019s Turkish Baths. The final decision to build the Bank\u2019s new headquarters was not without controversy. Board Chairman Acheson Overend, in particular, was against the Albert Street site because his \u201coffer to let his shop at the corner of Albert and Elizabeth Streets had been rejected\u201d. Overend resigned as Chairman in April 1922. Another director, Mr. Bunning, resigned in May over the proposed location of the new building. As well, the replacement Chairman, Major Harte, resigned on 22 June 1922, just before construction began, as he believed that the Bank\u2019s finances should be put to better use than for funding a new building.\n\nThe architectural firm of Atkinson & Conrad was contracted to design the Bank\u2019s new headquarters. Henry Atkinson and Arnold Henry Conrad commenced their partnership in 1907 and it continued until Atkinson\u2019s death in 1939. The builders were J & E. L. Rees who erected St Paul\u2019s Church in Spring Hill, the Jubilee Hotel in Fortitude Valley and also worked with Atkinson & Conrad on alterations and additions to the Colonial Mutual Fire Insurance Company Building in Creek Street. The Queensland Deposit Bank Building was completed in May 1923.\n\nHenry Halliday, who had operated his Turkish Baths from this 231 Albert Street site since the 1890s, moved his baths into the basement of the new Queensland Deposit Bank Building after it was completed. The Bank offices were located on the ground floor while a variety of offices leased by dentists, accountants, solicitors and manufacturing agents occupied the upper floors. The Mason\u2019s United Grand Lodge, whose Grand Master, Alexander Corrie, was one of the Bank\u2019s directors, leased the building\u2019s top floor for offices and a Masonic Room. This arrangement continued until 1929, when the Masons moved to their new Temple in Ann Street. Other organisations to take up offices there included the Australian Institute of Architects (1923-43) and the Town & Country Women\u2019s Club (1932-49). In 1929, the architectural firm of Atkinson, Powell & Conrad oversaw alterations to the building, which cost \u00a31,500. By this time Henry Atkinson had also joined the Bank\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nEven after moving into its new building, the Bank was plagued by internal strife. One director, Leslie Corrie left in July 1924 after failing to have the Articles of Association revised. Chairman William Kelso had a dispute with long-term manager George Seabrook that ended with Seabrook\u2019s resignation in 1927. He was replaced by Kelso\u2019s former workmate, Mr. A. F. Knowles. Seabrook then went to the press about the Bank\u2019s affairs. Referring to the new bank building, Seabrook\n\ndisclosed that he had obtained the first offer of a site at Edward and Adelaide Streets, better than the Albert Street site. He said the board turned it down, and the site was then taken up by another institution, which made nearly \u20a48,000 on the deal.\n\nSome expansion did occur, however, as the Bank established lending agencies in four towns north of Brisbane.\n\nAt the same time, the Brisbane Permanent Building Society made an initial offer to amalgamate with the Queensland Deposit Bank. Discussions held between officers of the two financial institutions on 22 November 1927, proved inconclusive. Then in September 1931, as a result of uncertainty due to the effects of the Great Depression, there was a run on the Queensland Deposit Bank, the Brisbane Permanent Building Society and the Federal Deposit Bank. The Queensland Deposit Bank was the hardest hit by these customer withdrawals, losing \u20a450,102 or 60% of its capital. It was while in this parlous state that the Bank resumed merger talks with the Brisbane Permanent on 10 November 1931.\n\nFive weeks later, the Queensland Deposit Bank ceased to trade, following the last shareholders\u2019 meeting on 15 December 1931. In 1932, the Brisbane Permanent sold the Queensland Deposit Bank Building to the Commercial Bank of Australia (CBA), which then used the building as its Queensland headquarters. Halliday\u2019s Turkish Baths closed the next year. In 1982, the CBA merged with the Bank of New South Wales to become Westpac. A Westpac branch operated from the building until 2000.\n\nAs with most commercial premises within the Central Business District, the Queensland Deposit Bank Building has undergone many internal changes over the years to accommodate the requirements of its different tenants. This is particularly the case with the ground floors of CBD buildings. Brisbane City Council approved alterations to the building in 1949, 1952, 1953, 1955 and 1971.\n\nThe Brisbane History Group identified the Queensland Deposit Bank as a part of Brisbane\u2019s commercial heritage in 2002, when they included it in their publication Walking Tours \u2013 Brisbane\u2019s Commercial Heritage 1900-1940."}]}
