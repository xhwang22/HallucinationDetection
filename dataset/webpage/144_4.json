But there was compensation better than dollars and cents in the universal respect which Barnie, like Harry Wright, enjoyed in the base ball world.\" - from Sporting Life's obituary of Billy Barnie\n\nBilly Barnie played four seasons in the majors and managed 14 years. His playing seasons were in 1874-1875, 1883, and 1886. During his playing days, his appearances were split about equally between catcher and outfield. As a catcher, he made 76 errors in 53 games, while as an outfielder he made 23 errors in 46 games. His batting average was .171. He began managing in 1882 and spent 9 years with the Baltimore Orioles in the American Association. He then managed three teams in the National League. None of his teams finished higher than 3rd. When he wasn't managing in the AA or the NL, Barnie managed the Scranton Coal Heavers in the Eastern League in 1895, the Hartford Bluebirds in the Atlantic League in 1896, and the Hartford Indians in the EL from 1899 until mid-1900. He also was an umpire in the National League and American Association between 1882 and 1892.\n\nSporting Life of July 21, 1900 carried his lengthy obituary, calling him \"one of the best known base ball men in the country\". It stated that he started in amateur ball at a very young age in 1865. He was primarily a catcher during his playing career, but when he became \"crippled in one hand\" he started to manage. In addition to a long career as a manager, he was also the organizer and part owner of the Hartford club. He was given credit for discovering a number of famous major leaguers, including King Kelly. He served on the rules and scheduling committees of the American Association and is responsible for at least one rule change that endures to this day, the creation of the Coaches box, down the two base lines. He made the suggestion to confine coaches to such a box after a number of team had taken to the habit of having their third base coach interfere in the play by running down with a baserunner in order to draw a throw, and do various other unsporting gestures; Arlie Latham of the St. Louis Browns was a particularly enthusiastic offender. The rule was adopted at his suggestion in the middle of the 1886 season.\n\n\n\n\n\nYear-by-Year Managerial Record [ edit ]\n\nFurther Reading [ edit ]\n\nMarty Payne: \"Beer Tanks and Barbed Wire: Bill Barnie and Baltimore\", in The Baseball Research Journal, SABR, Volume 42, Number 1 (Spring 2013), pp. 25-29."}, {"url": "https://ripbaseball.com/2018/12/06/grave-story-billy-barnie-1853-1900/", "page_content": "Here lies \u201cBald Billy\u201d Barnie, a catcher/outfielder who went on to manage until the day he died. Literally. He played for the Hartford Dark Blues (1874), Keokuk Westerns (1875) and New York Mutuals (1875) of the National Assn. and the Baltimore Orioles (1883, 1886) of the American Assn. He also managed the Orioles (1883-91), Washington Senators (1892), Louisville Colonels (1893-4) and Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1897-8).\n\nA New York native, Barnie started playing on local teams in 1870 before turning pro. He joined Hartford in 1874 and, as a rookie, led the league\u2026 in strikeouts (with 13). He also had a .184/.188./.226 slash line. The following season, he played in 10 games for the Keokuk (Iowa) Westerns, hitting .111. The Westerns folded after going 1-12 in their first 13 games, and Barnie signed on with the Mutuals as a backup to catcher/manager Nat Hicks. He had 5 hits in 34 at-bats for New York, bringing his 1875 batting average up to .129. Barnie would go on to insert himself into a few games when he was managing the Orioles and even had a .200 average in 17 games in 1883. All total, he hit .171 in 83 career games, with 55 hits, 23 RBIs and 32 runs scored.\n\nBarnie finished his full-time playing career in independent leagues. While nursing a hand injury in 1877 while playing for Buffalo of the League Alliance in 1877, the 24-year-old was given his first change to manage a ballclub. He\u2019d play a few seasons more, including the San Francisco Knickerbockers of the Pacific League, but his future in baseball would lie in managing.\n\nBarnie was a part of The Baseball Convention of 1881, which gave rise to the American Association as a competitor to the National League. Earlier that year, he\u2019d helped organize the Eastern Championship Association and ran the Brooklyn Atlantics team, so he was already familiar with getting a new league off the ground. He wanted a team of his own, but his financial backing was lacking. He and his partner A.J. Houck did get the Baltimore franchise in late 1882, and Barnie would spend the next 9 years as its manager.\n\nThe Orioles didn\u2019t see that much success under Barnie\u2019s tenure as part owner and manager, finishing as high as third just once. The Baltimore Sun said, \u201c\u2026his kind-hearted and easy-going ways causing players to impose on him and preventing him from making changes at times that would have been of benefit.\u201d He was succeeded by Ned Hanlon who, in his quietly ruthless way, made the changes that needed to be made for the good of the team. The Orioles would go on to win the AA championship three times under Hanlon.\n\nBarnie agreed to helm the NL\u2019s Senators in 1892. That arrangement lasted just 2 games. It seems like there was a power struggle between Barnie and the new owner. The Boston Globe reported on January 7 that Washington\u2019s shareholders put Barnie in charge of the club. Ten days later, though, it was reported that George Wagner had acquired 26 of the 29 shares, giving him absolute power. The Senators started the season with two losses, and Barnie, though he said he was given the change to manage for the whole season, was let go. No reason was given for his termination, he said.\n\nBarnie spent the rest of his life bouncing between managerial assignments in the National League and independent leagues. His time in Louisville ended when the 1895 Colonels won just 35 games while losing 95. His final run in the National League with the Bridegrooms lasted until 1898, when he was fired by Brooklyn as one of Charles Ebbets\u2019 first moves as the new owner. In 14 years as a pro manager, he went 470-548 for a .462 win %. He was credited with mentoring stars like King Kelly, Matt Kilroy and Mike Griffin. Ironically, Griffin would eventually be Barnie\u2019s replacement as the Brooklyn manager, following Ebbets\u2019 short-lived attempt at managing his own team.\n\nBarnie kept managing in the Eastern League, first in Springfield and then, until his death, in Hartford. Though he was said to be the \u201cpicture of health\u201d when he went to attend an Elks meeting in Atlantic City in early July 1900, he took ill. He returned to Hartford and died there on July 15 of pneumonia. He was 47 years old. Barnie is buried in the Paterson Family plot in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nOddly, it was the second time that an Elks meeting in Atlantic City proved to be disastrous to his health. Barnie, along with several others, was injured in a stage collapse at an Elks meeting in 1896. He had been entertaining the crowd by singing when the accident occurred. His obituary stated that he never fully recovered from his unspecified injuries.\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"url": "https://www.famousfix.com/list/washington-senators-1891-1899-managers", "page_content": "Billy Barnie Major League Baseball player, manager\n\n0 0\n\nrank #1 \u00b7\n\nWilliam Harrison Barnie (January 26, 1853 \u2013 July 15, 1900), nicknamed \"Bald Billy\", was an American manager and catcher in Major League Baseball.

Like Johnson he had strong roots in Baltimore.\n\nWith Born in New York, three years after the half century mark, Billy or \u201cBald Billy\u201d as he was called is usually associated with Baltimore where he was a fixture for many years. Although small in stature he played behind the bat and when physical ailments curtailed his playing career, Billy made the shifted over full time to the bench. It was here that is talents as a manager and organizer came to the forefront.\n\nIn 1885, Barnie was in his third year as manager of the Association Baltimore nine. Barnie\u2019s Orioles finished a dismal 8th with a record of 41-68. Earlier in the season he had declined an invitation from Michael Scanlon, manager of the Eastern League Washington Nationals. The refusal caused a dustup in the papers in Baltimore and the District with the charge that Barnie was afraid to play the Nationals. Certainly there was bad blood between Barnie and Scanlon since, it was alleged, Barnie had cast the deciding vote to keep Washington out of the Association. At the end of the season the two teams did meet and that series will be discussed at a later date.\n\nWith the collapse of the American Association after the 1891 season, Barnie was out of a job. The Philadelphia Press said this about Barnie in 1891, \u201cPoor Billy Barnie. He is to the ball writers what the tariff is to the economists. It is doubtful if anybody is dammed with more than the bald-headed band master of the Baltimore Bucks and it is doubtful if anybody deserves it less.\u201d\n\nTo the surprise of some Billy Barnie is signed to be the manager for the Washington Nationals, the first National League Club in the District\u2019s history. Barnie is a fan favorite in Washington and dubbed, \u201cThe Hustler from Hustlerville.\u201d One fan states, \u201cWe\u2019ll have a team now which will knock the stuffin\u2019 out of Baltimore.\u201d The fans also hope the Wagner\u2019s will bring some of the talent from Philadelphia, where they had owned the Association Club with them.\n\nJ Earl Wagner gets married in January and announces he will retire from baseball and will run the families meat packing business in Philadelphia. George Wagner will assume control over baseball operations in Washington. George it will later be written, only comes to the District to cause trouble.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals head south for spring training, a rarity during the Wagner years. During their time south the Wagner brothers circulate rumors that Manager Billy Barnie will be fired and replaced by Arthur Irwin.\n\nOn 16 April, after a 6 to 5 loss at home to the New York Giants. Billy Barnie is fired for talking back to George Wagner. George had asked Barnie to resign and he said, no! With Billy Barnie gone the Wagner brothers sign Arthur Irwin. The firing of Billy Barnie is met with a large howl from the fans who like Barnie and dislike Irwin.\n\nSporting Life adds the following, \u201cHe started the spring of 1892 as manager of the Washington team, but could not get along with the Wagner brothers, and soon resigned and finished the season partly as league umpire and partly as manager of the Ft. Wayne team. In 1893-94 he managed the Louisville Club with success. In the fall of 1894 he took part in the memorable attempt to reorganize the American Association, and was foolishly blacklisted by the League, only to be soon reinstated, however. In 1895 Barnie managed the Scranton team of the Eastern League. In 1897 he was manager of the Brooklyn team. In 1898 he organized the Hartford Club for the Eastern League, of which club Barnie remained the part owner and manager up to the day of his death.\u201d\n\nBarnie died in 1900, at the age of 47. It was a tragic loss for a well respected player and manager. The Sporting Life had this to say about Billy Barnie,\u201dStrictly Honorable in all of his dealings with his fellow-men. There was a standing remark that, like the lamented Harry Wright, Barnie was too good for professional base ball and too honest for his own good. Considering the caliber of many of the unscrupulous men who have fastened and fattened on base ball to the exclusion of more loyal, more liberal and more honest man this was in a measure true. But there was compensation better than dollars and cents in the universal respect which Barnie, like Harry Wright, enjoyed in the base ball world. Barnie was \u201calways a staunch and loyal American Association man and a consistent hater of the \u201cdiplomatic,\u201d unscrupulous and tyrannical old League. He was active in every move to re-establish the Association and had he lived he would have been a big factor in the new Association, which will, no doubt, take the field next spring. What a pity that poor Billy could, not live just long enough to see the fruition of his ardent hopes and labors!\n\nHis early death would have implications for baseball in Washington. In 1901 the National League was under assault by one but two leagues. If Barnie had lived he would have been a key factor in putting an Association team in Baltimore, maybe even getting John McGraw to join him. If so it might have helped Thomas C. Noyes in Washington who did not have the support of Ban Johnson. But that is a story for another day."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/billy.barnie/1752102", "page_content": "Billy Barnie\n\nbaseball player\n\nJanuary 26, 1853 (age 47) New York City\n\nBorn in New York City, he played as a right fielder in the National Association in 1874-1875.

The Boston Beaneaters was the name by which the Boston, MA National League franchise was known from the 1880s to the early 1900s. The name, which refers to Boston's nickname of \"Beantown\", derived from the supposed culinary preferences of some of its immigrant inhabitants, was never an official one. In fact a contemporary source from the 19th century does not even use the Beaneater moniker. It should also be noted that the name was even used on the Boston Americans.\n\nThe 1883 season saw the newly dubbed Beaneaters win their seventh pennant, and third in the NL under the leadership of Jack Burdock and John Morrill. The team would not win another pennant the rest of the decade, but was in heavy close contention for the pennant in 1884, 1889 and early contention in 1887 and 1888. During this this time the team changed managers four times, including a second managerial stint by Morrill. Prior to the start of the 1890 season, the team would hire Frank Selee to run the team. Selee had previously managed in the minors, where he won 2 pennants in his five seasons in the minors.\n\nUnder the guidance of Selee, the Beaneaters would win 5 pennants, and make two early World Series appearances in 1892 (defeating the Cleveland Spiders) and in 1897 (losing the Temple Cup to the Baltimore Orioles). Of course all good things must come to an end. At the turn of the century, the Beaneaters would post their only losing season with Selee as manager. In 1901 a new Boston team arose, this was the Boston Americans of the American League which was also Selee's last season with the team. During the off-season, Selee left for the Chicago Orphans. Selee's successor, Al Buckenberger guided the team to it's last winning season until 1914. After the 1906 season, long time owner Arthur Soden decided to get out of baseball, and sold the team to a group led by the Dovey Brothers. The team would then be dubbed by the press the Boston Doves.\n\nFurther Reading [ edit ]\n\nA History of the Boston Base Ball Club ...: A Concise and Accurate History of Base Ball from Its Inception , M.F.

With the advent of a salary cap and a reserve clause, an organization called The Brotherhood formed a new major league. They referred to it as The Players League, and it ended almost as quickly as it began. It was a giant unionization, and players flocked to it from both the National League and the American Association. Ironically, this reflected the discontent among the people of the nation regarding trusts in corporations. Thus, the government enacted the Sherman Antitrust Law. Unfortunately for the Players League, the law outlasted it by a considerable margin. The league folded after just one year.\n\nFor the Boston franchise, the decade introduced two Hall of Famers. Frank Selee began his tenure in 1890 and managed the club for 11 seasons. Meanwhile, sharp young hurler Kid Nichols anchored the rotation for much of the decade. This, combined with the efforts of men like King Kelly and Hugh Duffy, led the Beaneaters back to the top.\n\nA New Manager\n\nHowever, it got off to a rocky start. Selee was the first non-player manager in franchise history, and his first season yielded a 76-57 record with a fifth-place finish. The offense finished sixth in batting average (.258) and slugging percentage (.341). They placed fourth or fifth in nearly every other category except one, leading the league in walks (530). The pitching, however, was spectacular. They led the league in complete games (132) and shutouts (13). They also allowed the fewest runs (593) and walks (354).\n\nThis success on the mound was driven by Nichols. The right-hander would go 27-19 with a 2.23 ERA, a 1.146 WHIP, and a 170 ERA+. He led the league in FIP (2.98) and tossed seven shutouts. Fellow starters John Clarkson and Pretzels Getzien also won 26 and 23 games respectively. The Beaneaters had one of the best rotations in the National League.\n\nIn 1891, the team finished atop the league for the first time since 1883. Once again, the story lay in the pitching. Clarkson and Nichols combined to win 63 games, with Nichols hurling five more shutouts. The team finished first in ERA (2.76), complete games (126), and saves (6). For the second consecutive season, they walked the fewest batters (364) and allowed the least number of runs (658). The offense played its part as well, finishing first in walks (533), OBP (.337), OPS (.694), and runs scored (847). Patience at the plate and dominance on the mound led to the pennant.\n\n1892: The Club\u2019s Best Year\n\nBoston repeated the feat in both 1892 and \u201993. In the former season, they won 102 games, along with a pre-Modern World Series, defeating the Cleveland Spiders 5-0 with one tie. The offense was anchored by Hall of Famer Hugh Duffy. He led the team in average (.301), triples (12), and hits (184). Despite Duffy\u2019s efforts, the Beaneaters finished sixth in average (.250), sixth in hits (1,325), twelfth in triples (51), and seventh in homers (34). Their combined OPS+ was a rather dismal 89. They did run substantially, placing second in steals (338).\n\nBut, the pitching staff held the spotlight. Nichols was superb, winning 35 games and striking out 192 in 453 innings of work. He was backed up by fellow 35-game winner Jack Stivetts, who struck out 180 in 415.2 innings. The two posted respective ERA\u2019s+ of 124 and 116, and WHIP\u2019s of 1.159 and 1.244. Factor in the good work from Clarkson and newcomer Harry Staley and dominance followed. In fact, the Beaneaters posted a 1.29 ERA in that year\u2019s \u201cWorld Series,\u201d along with a 1.071 WHIP.\n\nMid-Decade Depression\n\nAfter their back to back successes, 1894 started a period of misery. Though they finished third, the pitching staff fell significantly. While Nichols still won over 30 games, his ERA of 4.75 was the worst in his career to that point. With their ace on the rocks, the rest of the staff managed an abysmal 5.41 ERA, a FIP of 5.52, and a WHIP of 1.664. They ended up near the bottom of the league in most pitching categories.\n\nIronically, the offense flourished. They led the league in homers (103), slugging (.484), doubles (272), and runs scored (1,220). Duffy carried a .440 average, 18 homers, 145 RBI, 51 doubles, 16 triples, a 1.196 OPS, and a 173 OPS+. Five other players racked up batting averages over .300 and double-digit home run totals. The team hit .331 as a unit, but their pitching could not keep up.\n\n1895 and \u201996 saw more of the same. The offense carried the team, while the pitching corps attempted to rebound. They managed to lower their ERA to 4.25 in \u201995, and then to 3.78 in \u201996. Nichols returned to form, posting a 30-14 record with a 2.83 ERA and 37 complete games. With the offense flourishing, things began to look up.\n\nReturn To Form\n\nThis combination finally found itself with back to back league championships. 1897 saw the offense put up a .319 average. The Beaneaters led the league in home runs (45), runs scored (1,025), and slugging (.426). Hall of Famer Jimmy Collins paced the team with a .346 average. He was backed by Duffy, who hit .340 with 11 homers, 129 RBI, and 41 stolen bases. The pitching was carried by Nichols and his 31 wins. He posted a 2.64 ERA, a 1.168 WHIP, and a 168 ERA+.\n\nIn 1898, the team would post its second 102-win season. The offense continued its good work, leading the league in homers (53) and slugging (.377). They hit .290 as a team, hit safely 1,531 times, and scored 872 runs. All of this backed up Nichols and the rest of the pitching staff, who posted a 2.98 ERA. Nichols himself would post 31 more wins, a 2.13 ERA, a 1.034 WHIP, and a 174 ERA+. He was joined by 20-game winners Ted Lewis and Hall of Famer Vic Willis. The corps was very good in the clutch, posting a league-best eight saves.\n\nIn 1899, the Beaneaters slipped to second. The offense and pitching both dipped. The team posted a .287 average and finished between third and sixth in most offensive categories. Duffy and Collins both lagged, though the former still managed to compile over 100 RBI. Outfielder Chick Stahl led the team with a .351 average, seven homers, 33 stolen bases, and 19 triples. On the mound, Nichols fell to 21 wins, though his ERA was still a respectable 2.99. The team ERA rose to 3.26, which was still good for second in the league. But it wasn\u2019t enough, as they finished eight games back of the pennant-winning Brooklyn Superbas.\n\nMain Photo:\n\nEmbed from Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://lastwordonsports.com/baseball/2020/10/18/braves-by-decade-1900s-boston-beaneaters-doves/", "page_content": "The 1900s in baseball were marked by two things: a significant lack of offense and a brand new major league. The Dead Ball Era was in full swing and impacted power numbers severely. Players were considered terrific if they hit five or six homers a year. So, teams came up with a plan to combat this: hit for contact. Ty Cobb, Nap Lajoie, and Honus Wagner were among the Hall of Famers to take advantage of the strategy. Meanwhile, the American League sprang up and began to raid National League rosters. The rivalry was so heated that the two leagues would refuse to play a World Series until 1903.\n\nYet, even in all this excitement, misery reigned in Boston. Throughout the decade, the team showed a serious decline. Even with future Hall of Famers Kid Nichols and Vic Willis in tow, Boston never finished above third. This would lead to a name change, multiple managerial changes, and many years in the cellar. However, 1914 would be just around the corner.\n\nSelee Bids Adieu to the Beaneaters\n\nFrank Selee\u2019s final years as the Beaneaters manager were wracked with trouble. 1900 would see the beginning of the end. The team finished fourth, compiling a 66-72 record. However, one member would have a shining moment. July 7 saw Nichols pitch to his 300th career win, defeating the Chicago Colts 11-4. Unfortunately, he finished with a 13-16 mark for the season. The rest of the team was just as middling, finishing with mediocre numbers in both offense and pitching. While they did pace the league in homers (48), their .283 team average was only good for fourth. Their team ERA (3.72) was third.\n\nThe team saw marked improvement over the next two seasons. In 1901, they finished 69-69. While this was only good for fifth, the pitching staff dropped its ERA (2.90). Nichols was back to form, finishing 19-16 with a 3.22 ERA and a 112 ERA+. Fellow hurler Willis posted his first 20 win season in two years. He compiled a 2.36 ERA and a 123 ERA+. Unfortunately, the offense was dreadful. Their .249 average was last in the league. They also finished last in runs (533), hits (1,180), doubles (135), triples (36), and total bases (1,471). Their combined OPS+ was an abysmal 69.\n\nBuckenberger\u2019s Blunders\n\nThis led the Beaneaters to look elsewhere for leadership. They hired Al Buckenberger to manage. He had managed the Pittsburgh Pirates in the early 1890s. However, he had not helmed a team since 1895. His first year with Boston saw a leap to 73-64 and a third-place finish. While the offense did not make any major improvements, the pitching flourished. With the departure of Nichols, Willis was the ace of the club. He made it count, going 27-20 with a 2.20 ERA and a 128 ERA+.\n\nUnfortunately, the Buckenberger \u201cera\u201d led to two more years of misery. The Beaneaters fell to 58-80 in 1903, and 55-98 in \u201904. The offense was all but shut down. They hit .245 in 1903 with a combined OPS+ of 82. 1904 saw similar production, with a .237 average and an OPS+ of 85. But, there was one bright spot \u2014 first baseman Fred Tenney. He hit .279 between the two seasons, with 302 hits, 35 doubles, 12 triples, 160 runs scored, and 34 stolen bases in 296 games. However, his defense left a lot to be desired. He committed 55 errors in the two campaigns, posting a -0.3 dWAR for each.\n\nThe pitching suffered even more. Staff ERAs of 3.34 in \u201903 and 3.43 in \u201904 placed them towards the bottom of the league. While Willis still pitched to an excellent 2.98 ERA in 1903, he only posted 12 wins. The rest of the staff did not fare any better. Nobody finished above .500. Right-hander Togie Pittinger posted the best record (18-22). The next season saw the team repeat this feat. Willis led the team with 18 wins but lost 25. Pittinger went 15-21. However, both pitched to ERAs in the mid-twos.\n\n1905 & \u201906: Dreadful Times for the Boston Beaneaters\n\nThus, it was time for another change in Boston. Tenney himself was called upon to manage in 1905. But, the team got worse, posting an abysmal 51-103 record. The bats were quiet, finishing last in average (.234), runs scored (468), hits (1,217), OBP (.284), slugging (.293), and OPS (.576). Their combined OPS+ was a miserable 74. The pitching wasn\u2019t any better, finishing last in most of the league\u2019s categories. Once again, nobody finished over .500, but the worst was Kaiser Wilhelm, who went 3-23. In short, 1905 was one of the worst seasons in Braves franchise history.\n\nBut 1906 made \u201905 seem heavenly by comparison. Tenney continued to lead, and the Beaneaters continued to suffer, dropping to 49-102. The offense was abhorrent, finishing with a .226 average and a combined 2.6 WAR. Though, ironically, their OPS+ actually jumped to 80. Meanwhile, the pitching saw the departure of Vic Willis. For the first time since 1890, the Beaneaters did not have a future Hall of Famer on their staff. Irv Young, Vive Lindaman, Big Jeff Pfeffer, and Gus Dorner combined for a .325 winning percentage. The team ERA of 3.14 planted them last in the league. To sum it up, the team finished 66.5 games out of first place.\n\nA Soft Name for a Soft Team\n\nThe next season saw a change in the team\u2019s name, from the Beaneaters to the Doves. The 1907 season saw marginal improvement under Tenney\u2019s leadership. The unit managed to hit .243, and their OPS+ jumped to 94. However, their record was 58-90, and the pitching was still terrible. So, Tenney\u2019s time as manager came to an end. He was replaced by Joe Kelley, who led the team through 1908. Under his guidance, the Doves posted a 63-91 mark. The offense was mediocre, finishing with a .239 average and a 93 OPS+. However, they did place fourth in runs scored (537), and hits (1,228). The pitching was fairly solid by today\u2019s standards, and two players finished over .500. However, this was the Dead Ball Era. The team\u2019s ERA of 2.79 was last in the league.\n\nFinally, 1909 rolled around, and it might have been the worst of all. Kelley was out as manager, replaced by Frank Bowerman. When he posted a 22-54 mark to start the season, he was taken down. Harry Smith would guide the team to a 23-54 record the rest of the way. The offense was woeful, hitting .223 and posting a 71 OPS+. They finished last in doubles (125) and triples (43). Outfielders Roy Thomas and Ginger Beaumont led the team with .263 averages. The pitching scuffled, posting a 3.20 ERA, an 88 ERA+, and striking out a mere 414 batters in 1,370.2 innings of work. All of this led to a 45-108 mark, 65.5 games behind the pennant-winning Pirates.\n\nMain Photo:\n\nEmbed from Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://ripbaseball.com/2018/12/06/grave-story-billy-barnie-1853-1900/", "page_content": "Here lies \u201cBald Billy\u201d Barnie, a catcher/outfielder who went on to manage until the day he died. Literally. He played for the Hartford Dark Blues (1874), Keokuk Westerns (1875) and New York Mutuals (1875) of the National Assn. and the Baltimore Orioles (1883, 1886) of the American Assn. He also managed the Orioles (1883-91), Washington Senators (1892), Louisville Colonels (1893-4) and Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1897-8).\n\nA New York native, Barnie started playing on local teams in 1870 before turning pro. He joined Hartford in 1874 and, as a rookie, led the league\u2026 in strikeouts (with 13). He also had a .184/.188./.226 slash line. The following season, he played in 10 games for the Keokuk (Iowa) Westerns, hitting .111. The Westerns folded after going 1-12 in their first 13 games, and Barnie signed on with the Mutuals as a backup to catcher/manager Nat Hicks. He had 5 hits in 34 at-bats for New York, bringing his 1875 batting average up to .129. Barnie would go on to insert himself into a few games when he was managing the Orioles and even had a .200 average in 17 games in 1883. All total, he hit .171 in 83 career games, with 55 hits, 23 RBIs and 32 runs scored.\n\nBarnie finished his full-time playing career in independent leagues. While nursing a hand injury in 1877 while playing for Buffalo of the League Alliance in 1877, the 24-year-old was given his first change to manage a ballclub. He\u2019d play a few seasons more, including the San Francisco Knickerbockers of the Pacific League, but his future in baseball would lie in managing.\n\nBarnie was a part of The Baseball Convention of 1881, which gave rise to the American Association as a competitor to the National League. Earlier that year, he\u2019d helped organize the Eastern Championship Association and ran the Brooklyn Atlantics team, so he was already familiar with getting a new league off the ground. He wanted a team of his own, but his financial backing was lacking. He and his partner A.J. Houck did get the Baltimore franchise in late 1882, and Barnie would spend the next 9 years as its manager.\n\nThe Orioles didn\u2019t see that much success under Barnie\u2019s tenure as part owner and manager, finishing as high as third just once. The Baltimore Sun said, \u201c\u2026his kind-hearted and easy-going ways causing players to impose on him and preventing him from making changes at times that would have been of benefit.\u201d He was succeeded by Ned Hanlon who, in his quietly ruthless way, made the changes that needed to be made for the good of the team. The Orioles would go on to win the AA championship three times under Hanlon.\n\nBarnie agreed to helm the NL\u2019s Senators in 1892. That arrangement lasted just 2 games. It seems like there was a power struggle between Barnie and the new owner. The Boston Globe reported on January 7 that Washington\u2019s shareholders put Barnie in charge of the club. Ten days later, though, it was reported that George Wagner had acquired 26 of the 29 shares, giving him absolute power. The Senators started the season with two losses, and Barnie, though he said he was given the change to manage for the whole season, was let go. No reason was given for his termination, he said.\n\nBarnie spent the rest of his life bouncing between managerial assignments in the National League and independent leagues. His time in Louisville ended when the 1895 Colonels won just 35 games while losing 95. His final run in the National League with the Bridegrooms lasted until 1898, when he was fired by Brooklyn as one of Charles Ebbets\u2019 first moves as the new owner. In 14 years as a pro manager, he went 470-548 for a .462 win %. He was credited with mentoring stars like King Kelly, Matt Kilroy and Mike Griffin. Ironically, Griffin would eventually be Barnie\u2019s replacement as the Brooklyn manager, following Ebbets\u2019 short-lived attempt at managing his own team.\n\nBarnie kept managing in the Eastern League, first in Springfield and then, until his death, in Hartford. Though he was said to be the \u201cpicture of health\u201d when he went to attend an Elks meeting in Atlantic City in early July 1900, he took ill. He returned to Hartford and died there on July 15 of pneumonia. He was 47 years old. Barnie is buried in the Paterson Family plot in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nOddly, it was the second time that an Elks meeting in Atlantic City proved to be disastrous to his health. Barnie, along with several others, was injured in a stage collapse at an Elks meeting in 1896. He had been entertaining the crowd by singing when the accident occurred. His obituary stated that he never fully recovered from his unspecified injuries.\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"url": "https://newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/tag/boston-beaneaters/", "page_content": "In the summer of 1934, three very different lives converged in North Brookfield, Mass.: song-and-dance man George M.

Led by eventual baseball Hall of Famers John McGraw, Wee Willie Keeler, and managerial innovator \u201cFoxy\u201d Ned Hanlon (no relation to your humble host?), the original O\u2019s had a reputation as the dirtiest team in baseball \u2013 though many of the tactics they employed (e.g., tight pitching, base-stealing, hit-and-run plays, and precise bunting) were simply edgy approaches to the rules that later became strategic staples of the modern game.\n\nOn the other, the comparatively saintly Boston Beaneaters \u2013 part of the longest lineage in baseball history dating back to the earliest days of the professional game and predecessors of today\u2019s Atlanta Braves \u2013 and eight-time National League champs over the course of the late 1800s.

The Boston Beaneaters was the name by which the Boston, MA National League franchise was known from the 1880s to the early 1900s. The name, which refers to Boston's nickname of \"Beantown\", derived from the supposed culinary preferences of some of its immigrant inhabitants, was never an official one. In fact a contemporary source from the 19th century does not even use the Beaneater moniker. It should also be noted that the name was even used on the Boston Americans.\n\nThe 1883 season saw the newly dubbed Beaneaters win their seventh pennant, and third in the NL under the leadership of Jack Burdock and John Morrill. The team would not win another pennant the rest of the decade, but was in heavy close contention for the pennant in 1884, 1889 and early contention in 1887 and 1888. During this this time the team changed managers four times, including a second managerial stint by Morrill. Prior to the start of the 1890 season, the team would hire Frank Selee to run the team. Selee had previously managed in the minors, where he won 2 pennants in his five seasons in the minors.\n\nUnder the guidance of Selee, the Beaneaters would win 5 pennants, and make two early World Series appearances in 1892 (defeating the Cleveland Spiders) and in 1897 (losing the Temple Cup to the Baltimore Orioles). Of course all good things must come to an end. At the turn of the century, the Beaneaters would post their only losing season with Selee as manager. In 1901 a new Boston team arose, this was the Boston Americans of the American League which was also Selee's last season with the team. During the off-season, Selee left for the Chicago Orphans. Selee's successor, Al Buckenberger guided the team to it's last winning season until 1914. After the 1906 season, long time owner Arthur Soden decided to get out of baseball, and sold the team to a group led by the Dovey Brothers. The team would then be dubbed by the press the Boston Doves.\n\nFurther Reading [ edit ]\n\nA History of the Boston Base Ball Club ...: A Concise and Accurate History of Base Ball from Its Inception , M.F.

When Ned Hanlon (no relation) managed the Brooklyn club in 1899, his team was called \u201cHanlon\u2019s Superbas.\u201d Hanlon was let go as manager in 1905.

The \u201cBridegrooms\u201d won the AA pennant in 1889. Upon switching to the National League in 1890, the franchise became the only one in MLB history to win pennants in different leagues in consecutive years. Eight years passed before any more success followed. Several Hall of Fame players were sold to Brooklyn by the soon-to-be-defunct Baltimore Orioles, along with their manager, Ned Hanlon. This catapulted Brooklyn to instant contention, and \u201cHanlon\u2019s Superbas\u201d lived up to their name, winning pennants in 1899 and 1900.\n\nTeams of this era played in two principal ballparks, Washington Park and Eastern Park. They first earned the nickname \u201cTrolley Dodgers,\u201d later shortened to Dodgers, while at Eastern Park during the 1890s because of the difficulty fans (and players) had in reaching the ballpark due to the number of trolley lines in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://baseball-almanac.com/teammenu.shtml\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers\n\n1958 - present\n\nBrooklyn Dodgers\n\n1932 - 1957\n\nBrooklyn Robins\n\n1914 - 1931\n\nBrooklyn Dodgers\n\n1911 - 1913\n\nBrooklyn Superbas\n\n1899 - 1910\n\nBrooklyn Bridegrooms\n\n1890 - 1898\n\nBrooklyn Bridegrooms (AA)\n\n1889 - 1889\n\nBrooklyn Trolley Dodgers (AA)\n\n1884 - 1888\n\n(The datings of some of these nicknames appear to be incorrect\u2014ed.)\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.acmewebpages.com/dodgers/thename.htm\n\nUnder field manager John Montgomery Ward (1891 - 1892) some called the team Ward\u2019s Wonders. Under Dave Foutz (1893 - 1896), they were often called Foutz\u2019s Fillies. Ned Hanlon joined the team as manager in 1899 (along with half the American Association\u2019s Baltimore Orioles team) and the nickname Superbas became common. It seems there was a popular vaudeville troupe at the time by the name of Hanlon\u2019s Superbas (no relation).

In Brooklyn, Hanlon led his team to two consecutive pennants in 1899 and 1900.

Literally. He played for the Hartford Dark Blues (1874), Keokuk Westerns (1875) and New York Mutuals (1875) of the National Assn. and the Baltimore Orioles (1883, 1886) of the American Assn. He also managed the Orioles (1883-91), Washington Senators (1892), Louisville Colonels (1893-4) and Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1897-8).\n\nA New York native, Barnie started playing on local teams in 1870 before turning pro. He joined Hartford in 1874 and, as a rookie, led the league\u2026 in strikeouts (with 13). He also had a .184/.188./.226 slash line. The following season, he played in 10 games for the Keokuk (Iowa) Westerns, hitting .111. The Westerns folded after going 1-12 in their first 13 games, and Barnie signed on with the Mutuals as a backup to catcher/manager Nat Hicks. He had 5 hits in 34 at-bats for New York, bringing his 1875 batting average up to .129. Barnie would go on to insert himself into a few games when he was managing the Orioles and even had a .200 average in 17 games in 1883. All total, he hit .171 in 83 career games, with 55 hits, 23 RBIs and 32 runs scored.\n\nBarnie finished his full-time playing career in independent leagues. While nursing a hand injury in 1877 while playing for Buffalo of the League Alliance in 1877, the 24-year-old was given his first change to manage a ballclub. He\u2019d play a few seasons more, including the San Francisco Knickerbockers of the Pacific League, but his future in baseball would lie in managing.\n\nBarnie was a part of The Baseball Convention of 1881, which gave rise to the American Association as a competitor to the National League. Earlier that year, he\u2019d helped organize the Eastern Championship Association and ran the Brooklyn Atlantics team, so he was already familiar with getting a new league off the ground. He wanted a team of his own, but his financial backing was lacking. He and his partner A.J. Houck did get the Baltimore franchise in late 1882, and Barnie would spend the next 9 years as its manager.\n\nThe Orioles didn\u2019t see that much success under Barnie\u2019s tenure as part owner and manager, finishing as high as third just once. The Baltimore Sun said, \u201c\u2026his kind-hearted and easy-going ways causing players to impose on him and preventing him from making changes at times that would have been of benefit.\u201d He was succeeded by Ned Hanlon who, in his quietly ruthless way, made the changes that needed to be made for the good of the team. The Orioles would go on to win the AA championship three times under Hanlon.\n\nBarnie agreed to helm the NL\u2019s Senators in 1892. That arrangement lasted just 2 games. It seems like there was a power struggle between Barnie and the new owner. The Boston Globe reported on January 7 that Washington\u2019s shareholders put Barnie in charge of the club. Ten days later, though, it was reported that George Wagner had acquired 26 of the 29 shares, giving him absolute power. The Senators started the season with two losses, and Barnie, though he said he was given the change to manage for the whole season, was let go. No reason was given for his termination, he said.\n\nBarnie spent the rest of his life bouncing between managerial assignments in the National League and independent leagues. His time in Louisville ended when the 1895 Colonels won just 35 games while losing 95. His final run in the National League with the Bridegrooms lasted until 1898, when he was fired by Brooklyn as one of Charles Ebbets\u2019 first moves as the new owner. In 14 years as a pro manager, he went 470-548 for a .462 win %. He was credited with mentoring stars like King Kelly, Matt Kilroy and Mike Griffin. Ironically, Griffin would eventually be Barnie\u2019s replacement as the Brooklyn manager, following Ebbets\u2019 short-lived attempt at managing his own team.\n\nBarnie kept managing in the Eastern League, first in Springfield and then, until his death, in Hartford. Though he was said to be the \u201cpicture of health\u201d when he went to attend an Elks meeting in Atlantic City in early July 1900, he took ill. He returned to Hartford and died there on July 15 of pneumonia. He was 47 years old. Barnie is buried in the Paterson Family plot in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nOddly, it was the second time that an Elks meeting in Atlantic City proved to be disastrous to his health. Barnie, along with several others, was injured in a stage collapse at an Elks meeting in 1896. He had been entertaining the crowd by singing when the accident occurred. His obituary stated that he never fully recovered from his unspecified injuries.\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Billy_Barnie", "page_content": "William Harrison Barnie\n\n(Baid Billy)\n\nBats Unknown, Throws Unknown\n\nUnknown, Unknown Height 5' 7\", Weight 157 lb.\n\nBR page\n\nBiographical Information [ edit ]\n\n\"There was a standing remark that, like the lamented Harry Wright, Barnie was too good for professional base ball and too honest for his own good. . . But there was compensation better than dollars and cents in the universal respect which Barnie, like Harry Wright, enjoyed in the base ball world.\" - from Sporting Life's obituary of Billy Barnie\n\nBilly Barnie played four seasons in the majors and managed 14 years. His playing seasons were in 1874-1875, 1883, and 1886. During his playing days, his appearances were split about equally between catcher and outfield. As a catcher, he made 76 errors in 53 games, while as an outfielder he made 23 errors in 46 games. His batting average was .171. He began managing in 1882 and spent 9 years with the Baltimore Orioles in the American Association. He then managed three teams in the National League. None of his teams finished higher than 3rd. When he wasn't managing in the AA or the NL, Barnie managed the Scranton Coal Heavers in the Eastern League in 1895, the Hartford Bluebirds in the Atlantic League in 1896, and the Hartford Indians in the EL from 1899 until mid-1900. He also was an umpire in the National League and American Association between 1882 and 1892.\n\nSporting Life of July 21, 1900 carried his lengthy obituary, calling him \"one of the best known base ball men in the country\". It stated that he started in amateur ball at a very young age in 1865. He was primarily a catcher during his playing career, but when he became \"crippled in one hand\" he started to manage. In addition to a long career as a manager, he was also the organizer and part owner of the Hartford club. He was given credit for discovering a number of famous major leaguers, including King Kelly. He served on the rules and scheduling committees of the American Association and is responsible for at least one rule change that endures to this day, the creation of the Coaches box, down the two base lines. He made the suggestion to confine coaches to such a box after a number of team had taken to the habit of having their third base coach interfere in the play by running down with a baserunner in order to draw a throw, and do various other unsporting gestures; Arlie Latham of the St. Louis Browns was a particularly enthusiastic offender. The rule was adopted at his suggestion in the middle of the 1886 season.\n\n\n\n\n\nYear-by-Year Managerial Record [ edit ]\n\nFurther Reading [ edit ]\n\nMarty Payne: \"Beer Tanks and Barbed Wire: Bill Barnie and Baltimore\", in The Baseball Research Journal, SABR, Volume 42, Number 1 (Spring 2013), pp. 25-29."}, {"url": "https://blogs.fangraphs.com/today-in-1899-the-brooklyn-superbas-were-born/", "page_content": "Today in the 1898-1899 offseason, a remarkable thing happened: as the ownership groups in Baltimore and Brooklyn swapped part shares in each other\u2019s clubs, the Orioles effectively merged with the Dodgers, with the class of the two ballclubs going to Brooklyn and the dregs staying in Baltimore \u2014 with the exception of star Baltimore third baseman John McGraw, who refused to leave. (Imagine if Jeffrey Loria traded a stake in the Marlins to Rogers Communications to obtain a stake in the Blue Jays, and you begin to get the idea.) The super-team in Brooklyn, formerly called the Trolley Dodgers, became known as the \u201cSuperbas.\u201d\n\nUp to that point, the Orioles had been arguably the best team in the National League for much of the decade, which is to say, the best team in baseball, because the National League was the only major league at the time. The Orioles finished first out of 12 teams from 1894-1896, and second in 1897-1898. The majority of their starting lineup \u2014 catcher Wilbert Robinson, shortstop Hughie Jennings, third baseman John McGraw, and outfielders Joe Kelley and Wee Willie Keeler, not to mention manager Ned Hanlon \u2014 went to the Hall of Fame. (Hanlon, Robinson, and McGraw largely made the Hall on their reputations as managers, though McGraw was also a superb player.) Then their team was eviscerated, and the Orioles disappeared through contraction the following year.\n\n\n\nNed Hanlon, known as \u201cFoxy Ned,\u201d managed the Orioles and then the Dodgers, but most importantly, he had an ownership share. So he was involved in the deal that brought the two clubs together, and when he went to Brooklyn he had his virtual pick of the Baltimore roster. The Orioles retained a few of their players \u2014 specifically McGraw, who immediately became the manager, and Robinson, later a longtime manager in Brooklyn. And they came up with Joe McGinnity, a Hall of Fame pitcher who debuted for the squad. (McGinnity was 28, old for a rookie, but as Burt Solomon writes in \u201cWhere They Ain\u2019t,\u201d he had previously \u201cleft baseball to open a saloon in Illinois because his wife was an invalid.\u201d) Still, all in all it was a disspiriting year for the Baltimore club, which finished in fourth place.\n\nThe 1899 National League season was a year of haves and have-nots. Brooklyn finished first, 101-47, eight games ahead of Frank Selee\u2019s 95-win Boston Beaneaters, and nine ahead of the Phillies. Baltimore was fourth with 86, but was closer to the ninth-place Louisville Colonels, who had 75 wins, than to the top of the division. At the bottom came the soon-to-be-extinct Senators, with 54 wins, and the infamous Spiders, who went 20-134 in the worst season of professional baseball ever played. The Senators, Spiders, Colonels, and Orioles were all contracted at the end of the season, as the National League shrank from 12 teams to eight. The shrinking of the league paved the way for Cleveland, Washington, and Baltimore to be reborn in two years as American League cities.\n\nHanlon may not have been a brilliant clubhouse man, according to Sam Crawford, who was a rookie on the Reds in 1899:\n\nHe was a bench manager in civilian clothes. When things would get a little tough in a game, Hanlon would sit there on the bench and wring his hands and start telling some of those old-timers what to do. They\u2019d look at him and say, \u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, just keep quiet and leave us alone. We\u2019ll win this ball game if you only shut up.\u201d\n\nBut Foxy Ned was still a towering figure in pre-1900 baseball. His teams were built around fundamentals and smallball. It was his Baltimore Orioles that originated the \u201cBaltimore Chop.\u201d The Superbas were even named after him. Brooklyn\u2019s team had been called the Trolley Dodgers for fairly obvious reasons, as trolley lines crisscrossed the borough. But there was a popular vaudeville troupe in Brooklyn called Hanlon\u2019s Superbas, and when Ned Hanlon came from Baltimore to Brooklyn, sportswriters jokingly began to call the baseball team the Superbas too. The name stuck, and that\u2019s how they were known for years afterwards, even after Ned had left the club.\n\nThe shady business deal that consolidated the clubs was actually not uncommon for the time, though the practice was banned after 1899. It was sneeringly referred to as \u201csyndicate baseball,\u201d as a similar thing happened in Cleveland and Louisville and led to the demise of those clubs as well. As Benjamin Rader writes in \u201cBaseball: A History of America\u2019s Game\u201d:\n\nIn the late 1890s three NL franchises became virtually the farm clubs of three other league franchises. When Cleveland Spiders owner Frank Robison obtained control of the St. Louis Browns in 1899, he transferred stars Jesse Burkett and Cy Young from the Spiders to the Browns, and when Barney Dreyfus, owner of Louisville, purchased control of Pittsburgh, he moved Honus Wagner and Fred Clarke to the Pirates. [But] Perhaps no interlocking ownership reflected a more cynical disregard for hometown fans than the Baltimore-Brooklyn nexus.\n\nBaltimore fans may have been more cruelly served at the time, but Louisville fans assuredly had it worse in the long run, as 1899 was the last season that there was a major league team in their city. The other three cities, Washington, Baltimore, and Cleveland, all gained a new team in 1901, the year that the American League was founded to compete with the NL. Cleveland\u2019s team is the only one that actually stayed in place, one of just four of the original eight American League clubs to do so, along with the Chicago White Sox, Detroit Tigers, and the Boston Red Sox.\n\n(The Baltimore Orioles of 1901 moved to New York in 1903 to become the Highlanders, now known as the Yankees, while the Washington Senators of 1901 moved to Minnesota in 1961 to become the Twins. Baltimore finally got a new team in 1954, the former St. Louis Browns. They were not Frank Robison\u2019s Browns, though. That team, which took Cy Young from the Cleveland Spiders, is now known as the St. Louis Cardinals. The Browns team that became the Orioles had begun life in 1901 as the Milwaukee Brewers, and moved to St. Louis in 1902.)\n\nSo take heart, Miami fans. Giancarlo Stanton, the one good player who stayed in Miami, may become one of the greatest managers of all time. Jake Marisnick could open a very successful saloon. And in a hundred years, you may draft Manny Machado and make the playoffs."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/billy.barnie/1752102", "page_content": "Billy Barnie\n\nbaseball player\n\nJanuary 26, 1853 (age 47) New York City\n\nBorn in New York City, he played as a right fielder in the National Association in 1874-1875.

Like Johnson he had strong roots in Baltimore.\n\nWith Born in New York, three years after the half century mark, Billy or \u201cBald Billy\u201d as he was called is usually associated with Baltimore where he was a fixture for many years. Although small in stature he played behind the bat and when physical ailments curtailed his playing career, Billy made the shifted over full time to the bench. It was here that is talents as a manager and organizer came to the forefront.\n\nIn 1885, Barnie was in his third year as manager of the Association Baltimore nine. Barnie\u2019s Orioles finished a dismal 8th with a record of 41-68. Earlier in the season he had declined an invitation from Michael Scanlon, manager of the Eastern League Washington Nationals. The refusal caused a dustup in the papers in Baltimore and the District with the charge that Barnie was afraid to play the Nationals. Certainly there was bad blood between Barnie and Scanlon since, it was alleged, Barnie had cast the deciding vote to keep Washington out of the Association. At the end of the season the two teams did meet and that series will be discussed at a later date.\n\nWith the collapse of the American Association after the 1891 season, Barnie was out of a job. The Philadelphia Press said this about Barnie in 1891, \u201cPoor Billy Barnie. He is to the ball writers what the tariff is to the economists. It is doubtful if anybody is dammed with more than the bald-headed band master of the Baltimore Bucks and it is doubtful if anybody deserves it less.\u201d\n\nTo the surprise of some Billy Barnie is signed to be the manager for the Washington Nationals, the first National League Club in the District\u2019s history. Barnie is a fan favorite in Washington and dubbed, \u201cThe Hustler from Hustlerville.\u201d One fan states, \u201cWe\u2019ll have a team now which will knock the stuffin\u2019 out of Baltimore.\u201d The fans also hope the Wagner\u2019s will bring some of the talent from Philadelphia, where they had owned the Association Club with them.\n\nJ Earl Wagner gets married in January and announces he will retire from baseball and will run the families meat packing business in Philadelphia. George Wagner will assume control over baseball operations in Washington. George it will later be written, only comes to the District to cause trouble.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals head south for spring training, a rarity during the Wagner years. During their time south the Wagner brothers circulate rumors that Manager Billy Barnie will be fired and replaced by Arthur Irwin.\n\nOn 16 April, after a 6 to 5 loss at home to the New York Giants. Billy Barnie is fired for talking back to George Wagner. George had asked Barnie to resign and he said, no! With Billy Barnie gone the Wagner brothers sign Arthur Irwin. The firing of Billy Barnie is met with a large howl from the fans who like Barnie and dislike Irwin.\n\nSporting Life adds the following, \u201cHe started the spring of 1892 as manager of the Washington team, but could not get along with the Wagner brothers, and soon resigned and finished the season partly as league umpire and partly as manager of the Ft. Wayne team. In 1893-94 he managed the Louisville Club with success. In the fall of 1894 he took part in the memorable attempt to reorganize the American Association, and was foolishly blacklisted by the League, only to be soon reinstated, however. In 1895 Barnie managed the Scranton team of the Eastern League. In 1897 he was manager of the Brooklyn team. In 1898 he organized the Hartford Club for the Eastern League, of which club Barnie remained the part owner and manager up to the day of his death.\u201d\n\nBarnie died in 1900, at the age of 47. It was a tragic loss for a well respected player and manager. The Sporting Life had this to say about Billy Barnie,\u201dStrictly Honorable in all of his dealings with his fellow-men. There was a standing remark that, like the lamented Harry Wright, Barnie was too good for professional base ball and too honest for his own good. Considering the caliber of many of the unscrupulous men who have fastened and fattened on base ball to the exclusion of more loyal, more liberal and more honest man this was in a measure true. But there was compensation better than dollars and cents in the universal respect which Barnie, like Harry Wright, enjoyed in the base ball world. Barnie was \u201calways a staunch and loyal American Association man and a consistent hater of the \u201cdiplomatic,\u201d unscrupulous and tyrannical old League. He was active in every move to re-establish the Association and had he lived he would have been a big factor in the new Association, which will, no doubt, take the field next spring. What a pity that poor Billy could, not live just long enough to see the fruition of his ardent hopes and labors!\n\nHis early death would have implications for baseball in Washington. In 1901 the National League was under assault by one but two leagues. If Barnie had lived he would have been a key factor in putting an Association team in Baltimore, maybe even getting John McGraw to join him. If so it might have helped Thomas C. Noyes in Washington who did not have the support of Ban Johnson. But that is a story for another day."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-almanac.com/mgrtmld2.shtml", "page_content": "This is a comprehensive list of managers for the Brooklyn Dodgers franchise.
