The UCLA teams were both NCAA Champs and pretty legendary. They were coached by John Wooden.\n\n1969 UCLA Bruins NCAA Champions TOP (l to r): Lynn Shackelford, Curtis Rowe, Steve Patterson, Lew Alcindor, Sidney Wicks, John Ecker, Bill Seibert.

MIDDLE: George Morgan (manager), Gary Cunningham, John Wooden, Denny Crum, Ducky Drake. BOTTOM: Henry Bibby, Terry Schofield, Andy Hill.\n\nJohn Vallely Today\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Vallely, age 53, was raised in Orange County and now lives in Newport Beach. During his college days, John was a member of the UCLA Bruins basketball team and participated in two National Championship seasons, 1969 and 1970, under legendary coach John Wooden. John and wife Karen met during college and were married in 1970, the year John graduated with a degree in sociology. The couple had two children: a son, Eric, and a daughter, Erin. When Erin was 9 years old she was diagnosed with cancer, and eventually lost her battle, at the age of 12, in 1991. Since then, John and Karen have been committed to fighting pediatric cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, John is completing treatment for his own illness, lymphoma, and is very optimistic about his recovery. John says he uses Wooden\u2019s Pyramid of Success strategy to deal with his cancer. Wooden\u2019s philosophy, according to Vallely, focuses on success rather than winning. \u201cI have no conflict in my heart about knowing that I am the best I can be and so I have peace of mind,\u201d John says. \u201cSuccess is the absence of conflict. Actually it\u2019s harder to do than winning. It\u2019s possible to win a game without doing your best. But knowing have been the best husband, the best father, the best patient I can, is all I can do.\u201d\n\nSurviving With Strength\n\nA Former UCLA Basketball Star Writes About Dealing with the Loss of a Daughter from Cancer, and Then, Fighting His Own Battle with Lymphoma\n\nBy John Vallely\n\n\n\nA random attack of cancer strikes fear in anyone. Why me? Am I going to die? What did I do wrong? Why did this have to strike my daughter at such a young age? It\u2019s not possible to answer these questions. What matters most, is our response to these life challenges.\n\n\n\nMy experience with cancer began in 1988. My 9- year-old daughter Erin was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma. Surgeons removed a cantaloupe- sized tumor from her abdomen, but were unable to get the entire growth. Until her death in 1991, she endured multiple s u r g e r i e s , chemotherapy and radiation that severely burned her already ill body. I learned so much from her. I miss her.\n\n\n\nIn April 2002, at 53 years old, I was diagnosed with lymphoma. I cannot tell you how astonished I was to learn of my condition. How could this be? Haven't we had enough? My wife and I had already experienced our child dying in our arms. What could be next for us? What about our son Eric? Again I was filled with fear, but once we all began to fight back it gradually subsided.\n\n\n\nThe first step of each patient\u2019s process is correct diagnosis. I believe you must have at least two opinions regarding pathology. If a patient is incorrectly diagnosed, the treatment will not attack their disease. I have spoken with patients who were disappointed with treatment outcome. They later learned that the course of medications would have been different had they researched their circumstances more thoroughly. Consensus on diagnosis is good. Differing opinions lead to better decisions, so patient and family must be proactive and explore options. The relationship with the medical system should be considered a partnership.\n\n\n\nThe next step is launching a plan of attack. After all, this is War! Most things, including my cancer, are not simply about winning and losing. My disease is about the process. I believe it is important to have a positive attitude. Mine is: \"I will be the best I can be. I will do all that I can do to get well and to help my loved ones. I will follow all of the doctor\u2019s directions. I will do everything in my power to give myself and loved ones every chance to survive this disease. And then I will pray!\"\n\n\n\nI believe \"hope\" is important. One can benefit from faith in something. The mental, physical and spiritual obstacles related to cancer are severe. A positive outlook may not have the power to heal -\u2014 but, then again, it might. I believe, at the very least, it can make the process more manageable. Hope and faith are very personal. I was broken-hearted and disappointed when God did not heal my daughter. Yet, I believe she is in heaven. When I was diagnosed, I was angry with God. My lonely walks on the beach brought on another series of questions: What kind of God are you? Do you care? What do you want with my family? Even so, I never gave up my trust that God is watching over Erin.\n\n\n\nMy journey forward has been steady but difficult. It requires a willingness to participate on so many levels and I\u2019m always seeking answers. I believe that the process will lead to living my life at the highest level, regardless of the outcome. Prayer and reflection are part of my daily vigilance. I am grateful that doctors, nurses, chemotherapy, and other drugs are available. I consider these to be gifts from God. I also believe this is part of a grand plan that will give me, the cancer patient, an opportunity to fight and a chance to get well.\n\n\n\nWhen our daughter Erin died my wife, Karen, and I made our decision to fight back. We joined with others in an organization called the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation (PCRF) to raise funds for research aimed at curing pediatric cancer. I\u2019m a past president of PCRF, and currently a member of the PCRF board of directors. Karen spends countless hours on the PCRF Holiday Card Program \u2014 their major fund raising activity for the last 20 years. Our family shares the goals of PCRF.\n\n\n\nRaising funds to support research will help fight this terrible disease. Over the last 20 years the survival rate for children with cancer has more than doubled because of research. Regardless of the outcome of my disease, I know that we are making a difference in this big battle, that we are committed until cancer is defeated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links John Vallely Motivates\n\nLatest News Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://basketball.realgm.com/player/John-Vallely/Teammates/66807", "page_content": "The Improbable, Inevitable Miami Heat by John Wilmes It was not foreseeable Miami would defeat the most talented teams in the sport, flaring an unusual ability to find and corner the frightened child within some of the NBA's biggest stars.\n\nNBA Draft Report: Cason Wallace Of Kentucky by Zachary Cohen Cason Wallace is a plus defender with an NBA ready jumper that can immediately help a lot of basketball teams, and he's going to be a chameleon in the league when it comes to fit.\n\nFor The Nuggets, Attention Isn't the Prize by John Wilmes Your life is certainly better if you don't make yourself think like a media executive, but the exercise may be useful to those acting confused about why a business-first basketball team with minimal mainstream history and no loud characters has been under-publicized."}], "John Vallely averaged 8.2 points, 3.2 assists, and 2.2 rebounds per game.": [{"url": "https://www.landofbasketball.com/nba_players_stats/john_vallely.htm", "page_content": "403 Error - Forbidden\n\nFor some reason this resource can't be accessed.\n\n(If your browser version is too old it might have been blocked for security reasons.

high school girls basketball players in the nation in 2022-23.\n\nNow, we want to hear from you: Who was the best of the best?\n\nVote in the poll and let us know who you think was the top high school girls basketball player in the nation in 2022-23.\n\nConway (Arkansas) senior guard Chloe Clardy won the SBLive fan poll last year as a junior and is up for the award again.\n\nThis year's voting will conclude Sunday, June 11, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nDescriptions of each player are below the poll.\n\nView the original article to see embedded media.\n\nDee Alexander, soph., Purcell Marian (Ohio)\n\nAlexander earned honors as Ohio's Ms. Basketball after averaging 26.2 points, 10.1 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 2.4 steals per game this season and led the MVC in points per game, field-goal percentage (57.8) and steals (3.9). She's won state championships in both of her years playing high school basketball.\n\nKK Arnold, sr., Germantown (Wisconsin)\n\nA two-time Gatorade Wisconsin player of the year and five-star UConn signee, Arnold was dominant once again for the Division 1 state semifinalist. She averaged 23.3 points, 7.7 rebounds, 7.7 assists and 3.3 steals per game, shooting 48% from the field and 36% on 3-pointers.\n\nMadison Booker, sr., Germantown (Mississippi)\n\nHeading from one Germantown to another, Booker put an exclamation point on one of the most prolific high school careers in Mississippi history, leading the Mavericks to a Class 6A state championship and earning recognition as the state\u2019s only McDonald\u2019s All-American. The Texas signee scored 26 points in her final game, cementing her legacy with a 64-43 win over Tupelo in the title game.\n\nWhen it was Brooks' turn to lead storied St. John Vianney, she did not disappoint, earning honors as SBLive National Player of the Year. The North Carolina State-bound point guard was simply magnificent for the Lancers, averaging 22.5 points, 6.6 rebounds, 5.5 steals and 4.1 assists per game for a team that finished 31-1 and finished No. 7 in the country in SBLive's final Power 25 rankings.\n\nJaloni Cambridge, jr., Ensworth (Tennessee)\n\nShe might not be big (5-foot-5), but she is certainly dangerous with the ball in her hands. The nation's top-ranked player in the class of 2024 averaged 26.9 points, 7.6 rebounds, 4.3 steals and 3.8 assists for the Division II Class 2A state runner-up.

Cunningham, a five-star Arizona commit, averaged 18.4 points, 10.3 rebounds, 2.7 blocks and 1.9 steals per game on 67% shooting. She teamed up with guard Jada Williams to lead the Torreys to their second consecutive CIF San Diego Section Open Division title and a No. 8 finish in the nation.\n\nJadyn Donovan, sr., Sidwell Friends (Washington, DC)\n\nA Duke signee, and top-three senior prospect, Donovan led the Quakers' formidable national title defense in 2022-23.

With nightly totals of 28.5 points, 13.6 rebounds, 2.9 assists, 3.5 steals, 2.6 blocks on 65% shooting (all team-highs), Edwards did it all as the only double-digit scorer for a 29-2 state champion and top-50 team in the nation. She scored at least 20 points in 29 of 31 games.\n\nMilaysia Fulwiley, sr., Keenan (South Carolina)\n\nThe five-star South Carolina commit was as individually dominant as any player in the country for the SCHSL 2A semifinalists, averaging 24.8 points, 8.1 rebounds, 6.4 assists, six steals and 2.6 blocks per game.

She averaged 22.4 points, 8.2 rebounds, 3.6 assists, two steals and 1.1 blocks per game on 52% shooting (40% on 3-pointers), and has a reputation as an on-ball stopper guarding any position.\n\nJohnson's ability to get to the rim and get to her mid-range jumper was unparalleled in Minnesota. The South Carolina commit led the Knights to Class 4A title after averaging 23.6 points and six assists per game. She was named Minnesota Gatorade Player of the Year and was the lone McDonald's All-American from the state.\n\nKate Koval, jr., Long Island Lutheran (New York)\n\nA top-three recruit in class of 2024, Koval had an outstanding season for the Crusaders (15.1 points, 11.7 rebounds and 3.4 blocks per game on 60.7% shooting).

In the Eagles' 69-67 state championship victory over Archbishop Mitty, Smith put on a show \u2014 30 points, 13 rebounds, six steals and four blocks. She's also an elite on-ball defensive ace, able to lock up guards and post players.\n\nJuju Watkins, sr., Sierra Canyon (California)\n\nThere isn't much the Gatorade national player of the year and top-ranked senior in the country can't do on the basketball court. The USC signee averaged 27.3 points, 13.8 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 2.6 steals per game to lead Sierra Canyon to a CIF Southern Section Open Division championship and 31-1 record. Watkins also scored 25 points to help lead Team West to a victory at the McDonald's All-American Game, where she was named co-MVP.\n\nMikaylah Williams, sr., Parkway (Louisiana)\n\nRated as the No. 2 senior in the country, Williams led Parkway to a 32-5 record and state championship.
