Two months later he volunteered for the army as a pilot, serving in France, where he was officially credited with having brought down four German warplanes. Following his discharge of February 5, 1919, Germer was given a medical examination and was treated for shock and nervous strain. On March 1, 1919, Germer returned to his position at Western Electric and was assigned to work with Dr. Clinton J. Davisson, an electron physicist who was doing research on a reliable, distortionless repeater, or amplifier, for use in the long-distance telephone lines of AT&T. While studying the effect of positive ion bombardment on the efficiency of electron emission for oxide coated cathodes, Davisson and Germer noted that electrons directed at metal targets were reflected without loss of energy, a surprising result. While Davisson and a newly appointed colleague, Charles Kunsman, began to pursue studies with the elastically scattered electrons, Germer was assigned to a new project on thermionic emission. He and Davisson published important results on this topic in 1922, and in 1924 Germer published the results of further studies as his Ph. D. dissertation. Germer's hectic schedule (work, graduate school, and raising a family) was interrupted from April 1923 to July 1924, during which time he was treated for a nervous breakdown probably linked to a severe, recurrent sinus infection that was aggravated by noxious gas overseas. Shortly after Germer returned to work in 1924, he was reassigned to the electron scattering studies that had been assigned to Kunsman in 1920 but had been abandoned in late 1923, at which time Kunsman left the company. On February 5, 1925, while the electron tube previously used by Davisson and Kunsman was being reactivated, an accident occurred that eventually changed the character of the investigation. The heated, evacuated tube cracked, the nickel target was damaged, and the experiments were halted. When the tube was repaired and the experiments resumed, a surprisingly different pattern of the scattered electrons was observed. Attempts to explain this new behavior on the basis of the altered crystal structure of the nickel target were inconclusive, and Davisson and Germer expanded their study. Two years later, after further experimentation and after Davisson had obtained new theoretical insights during a trip to England and attendance at the 1926 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Davisson and Germer realized that the new behavior of the scattered electrons could best be understood by attributing wave properties to them. In a series of papers published by Davisson and Germer, both jointly and separately, during the period 1927-1929, they demonstrated conclusively that electrons, like light, have the physical characteristics of waves as well as particles. Davisson and Germer realized that their discovery also had potential for yielding information about the structure of the material from which the electrons were scattered. Germer pursued these studies, using both the scattering method he and Davisson had developed, and also an electron transmission method developed by George P. Thomson in England, publishing over twenty papers in the field. At that time he developed an interest in the behavior of metal contacts under electrical discharge, another subject of interest to AT&T, which he pursued until 1957, publishing nearly twenty papers on this topic. Having completed this long series of studies, Germer's interest in electron diffraction was rekindled when a colleague at Bell Telephone Laboratories asked him to assist in developing a modified form of the electron scattering apparatus he and Davisson had used thirty years earlier. After Germer and his colleagues perfected this method, it proved to be so fruitful for the investigation of surface structures that Germer, even after his retirement from Bell Labs in 1961, continued this work as a research associate at Cornell University. During this time, besides publishing the results of his own research, he traveled to locations all over the world, lecturing and giving advice on the technique and interpretation of low-energy electron diffraction studies (LEED), a technique that has become indispensable to many fields of research. He died after a fall while climbing near Gardiner, New York."}, {"url": "https://www.ucla.edu/about/awards-and-honors/faculty/national-academy-of-sciences", "page_content": "The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is a private, non-profit organization of distinguished scholars.\n\nNAS was established by Congress and signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 with the mission of providing independent, objective advice to the nation on matters related to science and technology.\n\nNAS members are elected to membership by their peers for their contributions to research.

Every year, taxpayers pay for at least $750 million worth of expensive pharmaceuticals that are simply thrown away. Companies ship many of the drugs in \u201cCostco\u201d-size vials, one lawmaker said, that once opened usually cannot be resealed or saved for other patients. Yet pharma gets paid for every drop. So Congress turned to the prestigious National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine for advice, given its reputation for \u201cindependent, objective reports\u201d on such matters. The national academies\u2019 influential report, released in February, struck physicians who\u2019ve tracked the issue as distinctly friendly to Big Pharma. It advised against an effort to recoup millions for the discarded drugs. It concluded that Medicare should stop tracking the cost of the drug waste altogether. Yet the report left out a few key facts, a KHN investigation has found. Among them: One committee member was paid $1.4 million to serve on the board of a pharmaceutical corporation in 2019 and in 2020 joined the board of a biotechnology company that lists government \u201ccost containment\u201d efforts as a risk to its bottom line. Another committee member reported consulting income from 11 to 13 pharmaceutical companies, including eight that Medicare records show have earned millions billing for drug waste. His pharma ties were disclosed in unrelated publications in 2019 through this year. . . .\n\nBut:\n\nIn a statement emailed to KHN, the national academies said the two members with undisclosed board and consulting roles had \u201cno current conflicts of interest during the time the [drug waste] study was being conducted\u201d from January 2020 through February.\n\nWhat??? The committee member joined the board of a biotechnology company that lists government \u201ccost containment\u201d efforts as a risk to its bottom line\u2014-and that wasn\u2019t a \u201ccurrent conflict of interest\u201d? Ahhhh, maybe I see. The study was conducted in Jan-Feb 2020, so if the board member didn\u2019t join the company until later in the year, it\u2019s not a \u201ccurrent\u201d conflict. In the other direction, the member served on that phrarma board in 2019, but that was before 2020. So, massive conflict before, massive conflict after, but no conflict during those two months.\n\nNot a good look, National Academy of Sciences.\n\nAnd this statement from a spokesperson for the academies:\n\nProtecting the integrity, independence, and objectivity of our study process is of the utmost importance to the National Academies.\n\nI don\u2019t think so, and I\u2019ll get to why I don\u2019t think so in a bit.\n\nBut first some more background, again from Jewett\u2019s article:\n\nBefore and while [an influential 2016 paper on drug waste] was making waves, physicians who would eventually be on the national academies committee were forging alliances with the pharmaceutical industry. Dr. Kavita Patel reported earning a speaking fee in 2015 from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, of $5,001 to $15,000. She also accrued assets valued at more than $50,000 for her role as a pharmaceutical company board member, according to 2015 and 2018 disclosures filed with the Government Accountability Office. Dr. Anupam Jena, who also served on the committee, wrote a 2018 article with staff members of PhRMA arguing that medications should be valued not for their actual benefit, but rather for the potential for innovation that comes with making new therapies.\n\nWhat jumps out at me here is that neither half of the corruption equation seems objectionable on its own. I\u2019ve earned between $5,001 to $15,000 as a corporate speaking fee, I\u2019ve done corporate consulting. And, on the other side, the position that medications be valued for their potential for innovation is not unreasonable.\n\nThat said, I agree with the critics that there\u2019s a big ethical problem here. So where is it coming from. I see two issues. First, as noted in the linked article, the conflicts of interests are hidden. The authors of this report being paid big bucks by pharma companies\u2014that should be stated right up front, not kept as a secret to be found by enterprising reporters. Second, the involvement of the National Academy of Sciences, a quasi-governmental organization that is some sort of representative of prestige academia.\n\nMy connections\n\nThis story interests me directly for several reasons:\n\n1. Pharmaceutical support. Over the years, I\u2019ve received several thousand dollars of research support from pharmaceutical companies. I\u2019ve spoken at pharma companies for free and for pay and I\u2019ve worked with colleagues in the industry. I get as annoyed as anyone about the worst abuses in pharmaceutical research (fake experiments, hidden data, and all the rest). So it\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s an industry that does lots of things, including bad things that make lots of money.\n\n2. Corporate support more generally. I\u2019m in the habit of taking cash where it comes. I say no sometimes, but I say yes a lot too. Here\u2019s a partial list. I feel pretty strongly about my own integrity, but if you don\u2019t want to trust some of my views because of conflict of interest, that\u2019s fair enough. It\u2019s a price I pay for the $.\n\n3. The National Academy of Sciences. From my perspective as an outsider, the NAS seems to me to have three functions:\n\n(a) It produces the journal, PNAS.\n\n(b) It\u2019s a society that honors prominent scientists.\n\n(c) It provides occasional advice to the government.\n\nMy connections are: (a) I\u2019ve published in the journal, criticized papers in the journal, and a few years ago I got them to fix their slogan; (b) I know lots of people who\u2019ve been honored by the academy; (c) I\u2019ve given advice to some NAS panels.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise to me that NAS members have corporate support. Free money is something that comes to you when you become more prominent\u2014it\u2019s a gravitational kind of thing\u2014so it makes sense that many of the country\u2019s most prominent scientists have been, like me, willing to take some of the money that has been offered to them. I used to think I\u2019d always want money and I\u2019d always want to be on TV. I no longer want to ever be on TV again but I\u2019m still accepting cash, so I can easily believe that others would too.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t fully understand is how the three functions of the NAS fit together. I get that NAS members are involved in the PNAS process, but a lot of this must have to do with the management of the journal. Thirty years ago, PNAS was pretty obscure. But somewhere along the way, it became a top journal. And it serves a useful role, no joke. In addition to being a repository for prominent scientists to promote their favorite junk research, it\u2019s also place for publishing interdisciplinary work that could be hard to get published elsewhere, as with our paper on penumbras which borders political science and sociology. I don\u2019t really know how PNAS achieved its prominence. I\u2019m guessing it had some enterprising editors\u2014but that just seems like a journal thing, not particularly connected to the National Academy.\n\nFinally, I don\u2019t think the three roles of the NAS\u2014journal publisher, honorary society and advice-giver\u2014go together so well. From one perspective, sure, if the government is getting advice from scientists, why not take advice from the best? The trouble is, the NAS is not the best scientists; rather it\u2019s the most honored, which is not the same thing at all! I say this as a much-honored scientist myself. These organizations operate in the manner of links on a chain, with people nominating their friends or people they\u2019ve heard of. So you\u2019ll get some well-connected scientists, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nBut that\u2019s fine too: no filter is perfect, and it\u2019s not so bad for the government to be getting advice from well-connected scientists. My problem is that the whole point of the honorary society is to say how wonderful its members are, which is strongly in opposition to the goal of a scientific journal, which is to explore uncertainty, and the goal of an advice-giving society, which is to . . . explore uncertainty.\n\nThe NAS\u2019s contradictory roles\n\nTo me, the problem of that controversial NAS report was not the involvement of corporate-funded members\u2014in this day and age, this would be hard to avoid\u2014but rather that a key role of the NAS is to extol its members. The extolling role leads to PNAS publishing papers that understate uncertainty while favoring NAS members\u2019 favorite theories, and it leads to NAS reports that dismiss concerns of corruption and bias. To even bring up the possibility of bias is a contradiction of the NAS role of saying how goddam wonderful its members are.\n\nCountervailing power\n\nThe bad news is that the NAS produced that report full of unacknowledged conflicts of interest. The good news is that the above-linked investigative article by Christina Jewett came out. I don\u2019t know how much attention it received, but it did at least reach Sander Greenland, and then me, and now all of you. Jewett\u2019s article was published by . . . KHN. What\u2019s that? I clicked to find out:\n\nKHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues. Together with Policy Analysis and Polling, KHN is one of the three major operating programs at KFF (Kaiser Family Foundation). KFF is an endowed nonprofit organization providing information on health issues to the nation. KHN reports on how the health care system \u2014 hospitals, doctors, nurses, insurers, governments, consumers \u2014 works. In addition to this website, our stories are published by news organizations throughout the country. Our site also features daily summaries of major health care news. . . .\n\nKaiser is a large health maintenance organization . . . ummm, according to Wikipedia, it\u2019s an \u201cintegrated managed care consortium.\u201d Anyway, here\u2019s my point. Pharma is big business. Health care is big business. In many ways, pharma and health care are natural allies, but one place where they differ is drug costs. The big business that is Kaiser is a countervailing force to the big business that is pharma.\n\nCountervailing power is a good thing. It would be bad news if the folks at the Kaiser foundation were like, \u201cHey, we\u2019re rich businesspeople, pharma\u2019s rich businesspeople, let\u2019s not rock the boat, let\u2019s focus on the common enemy and fight to lower taxes and business regulation.\u201d Or if they were like, \u201cHey, health care is a science-based field, the NAS promotes the prestige of science, so let\u2019s not rock the boat, let\u2019s work together to increase science funding and not do anything to make scientists look bad.\u201d OK, maybe they do this sort of thing sometimes, and that\u2019s cool too, that\u2019s part of their story. But not all the time. Kaiser is willing to rock the boat, they\u2019re annoyed enough about overpaying for drugs that they\u2019re willing to blow the whistle, they\u2019re annoyed enough about scientists shilling for shillings that they\u2019re willing to call them on it.\n\nRemember that famous Walter Matthau saying that poker \u201cexemplifies the worst aspects of capitalism that have made our country so great\u201d? That\u2019s kind of what I think here. It would be so easy for the Kaiser foundation to play by gentleman\u2019s rules and not do anything to upset their fine colleagues in pharmaceuticals or the esteemed members of the National Academy of Sciences. But instead they are motivated by . . . not greed, I think, maybe \u201cannoyance\u201d is a better word . . . they let their annoyance get the better of them and they lash out. They have a little tantrum, and in doing so they play an absolutely necessary role, a source of countervailing power. They\u2019re comfortable enough not to have to do this, but they don\u2019t like overpaying for drugs and they don\u2019t like it when a bunch of stuffed shirts with Ph.D.\u2019s try to justify it. Good for them, and it\u2019s a good thing that there\u2019s some economic competition in the world, as well as a stable political system by which they can offer such criticism without fear of getting bombed or sued out of existence.\n\nLet me emphasize . . .\n\nI don\u2019t, repeat don\u2019t, think of the pharmaceutical industry or the National Academy of Sciences as the bad guys. I use pharmaceutical industry products all the time, I\u2019ve worked with many colleagues from different pharma companies, I\u2019ve even spoken to pharma groups for free. Similarly, I know lots of excellent NAS members, I\u2019ve published in PNAS and learned a lot from articles by others published in that journal. It\u2019s not at all a criticism of these fine people and organizations to say that these institutions, like any other, can have bad sides, hence the need for internal and external checks on their power and activities. The Kaiser foundation serves as one of these checks, and that\u2019s a good thing. And I also appreciate the aspects of our economy and society that allow these checks to work, which can enable all the good people in pharma and science to do even better work.\n\nP.S. John Kenneth Galbraith doesn\u2019t get full respect nowadays but I\u2019m with Mankiw that he\u2019s one of the great economists of the 20th century. As well as having many good ideas (such as countervailing power, the topic of the above post), Galbraith was also involved, less successfully, in politics and punditry, and it seems that when he wrote about the academic field of economics he did not show sufficient respect for some of the other work in that field. I can see how this could\u2019ve annoyed many of his colleagues, but from the current perspective, many decades later, I feel like we can look past the various lowlights of Galbraith\u2019s career and focus on his many positive contributions. In any sensible world, the concept of countervailing power would be considered much more important than, say, the concept of rational addiction.\n\nP.P.S. It seems that I got the KHN story wrong. There is no ongoing relationship between Kaiser Permanente (the health-care consortium) and KFF (the foundation that funds Kaiser Health News) and there hasn\u2019t been for decades, so for better or worse this does not seem to be an example of countervailing power in economics but rather a more direct example of the value of the free press, in this case funded by a nonprofit foundation rather than from the usual subscriptions-and-advertising model. Overall I think I\u2019d be happier if this had been an example of countervailing power in a capitalist system, because that would seem more scalable and robust than relying on the good fortune that the Kaiser foundation got organized to do this sort of thing. Also I\u2019m bummed because the HMO-vs.-pharma angle was cute, and now I\u2019ll have to retract that Galbraith praise. Countervailing power is a pretty idea, but maybe plain old political ideology is what matters now."}, {"url": "https://www.northwestern.edu/faculty-accolades/academies/national-academy-of-sciences.html", "page_content": "National Academy of Sciences\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit institution that was established under a congressional charter signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863.
