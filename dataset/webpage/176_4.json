He was born Michael Weiner, and lived most of his adult life as a closeted conservative in generally liberal circles. Weiner's father was a Russian-Jewish immigrant. A perpetual student through the 1960s and 70s, he collected four degrees: biology, anthropology, ethnobotany, and nutritional ethnomedicine. Before becoming Michael Savage, he authored more than a dozen books.\n\nOne of his books was a work of fiction called Vital Signs, in which the protagonist wrestles with his attraction to masculine beauty. \"I choose to override my desires for men when they swell in me\", Weiner wrote, \"waiting out the passions like a storm, below decks.\" At one time, Weiner self-published his own zines featuring inflammatory pieces about gay sex at San Francisco bathhouses. He was apparently opposed to such things. But he was a friend of beat poet Allen Ginsberg, the very, very out gay author of Howl. In a 1970 letter to Ginsberg, someone signed Michael Weiner described a semi-erotic encounter he had had with another man in Fiji. Weiner says he did not write the letter, though the return address was in Honolulu, where Weiner resided at the time. Savage now describes his one-time friend Ginsberg as \"latrine slime,\" and says that upon hearing of his death, \"I clasped my hands together and prayed to God. I said, 'Thank you, God, for answering my prayers. One of the blights of the human race is gone.'\"\n\nOther friends of Weiner from the 1970s remember him as \"this hip guy who'd been traveling in the South Seas, finding ways to use tropical plants to help end diseases.\" But eventually Weiner un-mellowed. He started carrying a gun, and he would unexpectedly engage acquaintances in loud, rude arguments. In short, he was a natural to become a talk show host.\n\nIn 1994, Weiner was hired to do evening and spot-shift fill-in work at KGO in San Francisco, where he went on the air as the abrasive \"Michael Savage\". His show quickly proved popular on the mostly-liberal station. His fans think Savage is brilliant, and Savage agrees.\n\nOn the air, he says that Latinos \"breed like rabbits\", and that America's public schools are \"teaching kids in the third grade how to put a condom on a cucumber.\" He explains that civil rights are a \"racket\" that is \"used to steal only from the white male -- no one else pays the price.\" He is worried about \"degenerates on the left who want to sell Americans on the idea that homosexuality, bisexuality, transsexuality, even sex with animals is normal.\" He demonizes pot smokers, refers to third-world nations as \"turd world nations\", and strongly opposes abortion (although his first wife had two while they were married) [1] . After the Dixie Chicks spoke ill of President George W. Bush, Savage inexplicably suggested they should be jailed as traitors. \"We've all been warned about the dangers of a theocracy\", says Savage, \"where religious zealots rule. Today in America, we have a she-ocracy where a minority of feminist zealots rule the culture.\"\n\nSavage or his syndicators have sued website publishers who criticize him or call for sponsor boycotts, claiming the sites like SavageStupidity.com are \"confusingly similar\" to the \"Michael Savage\" trademark, have caused him irreparable economic harm, improperly used excerpts from his radio show, and misappropriated his image.\n\nIn addition to his radio show, Savage briefly had a TV show on MSNBC, until on 5 July 2003 a crank caller criticized his teeth. Savage replied:\n\nSAVAGE : Alright, so you're one of those sodomists? Are you a sodomite? CALLER : Yes, I am. SAVAGE : Oh, you're one of the sodomites! You should only get AIDS and die, you pig! How's that? [off-screen crew can be heard shouting 'Whoa!'] Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig? You got nothing better than to put me down, you piece of garbage? You got nothing to do today? Go eat a sausage and choke on it. Get trichinosis. OK, do we have another nice caller who's busy and didn't have a nice night in the bathhouses, angry at me today? Huh? Get me another one, put another sodomite on! No more calls? I don't care. Let's go to the next scene. I don't care about these bums, they mean nothing to me. They're all sausages. Next scene; onto the next scene on the 'Savage Nation'.\n\n\"His comments were extremely inappropriate and the decision to cancel the program was an easy one\", said MSNBC spokesman Jeremy Gaines. Talking about the incident on his radio show, Savage seemed to see important free speech issues in his TV firing over sodomites and sausages. \"When they came for Michael Savage, if you did not stand up for Michael Savage because you were not Michael Savage, and I warn you, if you don't, there will be nobody left.\"\n\nSavage is the head of the self-styled Paul Revere Society, a group that says \"The United States is threatened\" and \"stands for the reassertion of our borders, our language, and our traditional culture.\" When asked about the apparent dichotomy between early Weiner and late Savage, Savage replies, \"I was once a child; I am now a man.\"\n\nSavage's wife and son own Rockstar Beverage Corp, makers of Rockstar Energy Drinks. Savage himself is, they say, not involved in that company in any way, though Rockstar and Savage Productions do share the same mailing address and street address.\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsmoney.com/net-worth/michael-savage/", "page_content": "Michael Savage\u2018s source of wealth comes from being a radio host.

His 20 books under his legal name Weiner all focus on topics related to nutrition, herbal medicine and homeopathy.\n\nSavage\u2019s political views turned Conservative in the 1980s and his rise to fame as a commentator came after numerous publishers rejected one of his works.

He is a climate change denier who has claimed that the greatest fraud in American history is the concept of man-made climate change.[1]\n\nEducation\n\nMichael Savage has a Ph.D. is in the field of Nutritional Ethnomedicine.[1]\n\nSavage Nation\n\nSavage broadcasts denialism\n\nSavage is best known for his sydicated radio show, which began in 1994 on San Francisco's KSFO, and moved to KNEW in 2003. The show is syndicated by Talk Radio Network.\n\nDavid Gilson wrote in a Salon article published March 3, 2003,[2] that using his talk-show as a vehicle, Savage had\n\nlaunched a one-man mission to save America from its enemies at home and abroad, which on any given day includes liberals, gays, academics, the homeless, the Clintons, immigrants, feminists, CNN, the American Civil Liberties Union, Muslims and other minorities. Broadcasting three hours a day, five afternoons a week, from a studio inside his home in the affluent San Francisco suburb of Larkspur, he gives voice to the right wing's darkest fantasies.\n\nOn May 18, 2004 a website that Savage had sued and lost, michaelsavagesucks.com, wrote an open letter to Savage, challenging his claims of radio popularity: \"Michael, let us verify your 350 stations and Arbitron data proving you have 10.5 million listeners, and we will shut down this website.\" They never received a reply.\n\nSavage has also written columns for NewsMax.com and WorldNetDaily.\n\nLawsuits Against Websites\n\nOne of Savage's favorite targets after politicians and illegal immigrants, is often attorneys, and not just the ACLU either. Just the same, Savage has shown himself to be litigious if he chooses.\n\nIn 1996, Savage filed a lawsuit against the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, claiming that he had been discriminated against when he had applied for the position of Dean. What Savage's qualifications were to be Dean of a journalism school remain a mystery. At that time, he was a celebrated author in the niche field of botany and herbal lore, and had a total of one year as a talk-show host under his belt. The candidate chosen over Savage was a recognized journalist and China scholar named Orville Schell, whose awards had included a Page One Award, and a best article from the Overseas Press Club. Schell had also been awarded writing fellowships from several organizations, and had been published in many respected periodicals. Weiner claimed he had been overlooked because he is white, even though Schell is also white. David Horowitz came to the aid of Savage [3] but the lawsuit was later dropped.\n\nAs his popularity was at its apex and MSNBC had him under contract, many websites appeared criticizing him, and they joined in with an initiative started by The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) to boycott all sponsors of his MSNBC TV show, Savage Nation.\n\nSavage took offense and sued, not GLAAD, but the owners of three small non-commercial websites in the federal court, and the two websites that used \"Savage\" in ICANN for their use of his name. savagestupidity.com and michaelsavagesucks.com In his filing, one Savage claim was that his fans could be confused if they visited these sites, and believe that they were visiting his site instead, immediately spawning sarcastic remarks regarding his fans' IQ upon the juvenile anti-Savage boards. Because of documented comments Savage had made on the airwaves towards the owner of michaelsavagesucks.com, he was allowed to use a shield of anonymity throughout the lawsuit. Both defendants won against Savage's suit, and the Federal lawsuit was dropped shortly after.\n\nSavaging Television\n\nMSNBC, as mentioned earlier, contracted a show with Savage, and broadcasted the debut of The Savage Nation on TV in March, 2003. The boycott effort gained steam and an aggressive letter writing campaign to sponsors was begun, causing many major corporations to remove their advertising on the show, but with very mixed results regarding smaller companies. Despite poor ratings, MSNBC kept the Savage Nation on until Saturday, July 5, 2003, when MSNBC broadcast its last Savage Nation show. On it Savage took a call from a prankster who claimed he was gay, to which Savage responded in part:\n\n\"Oh, you're one of the sodomites. You should only get AIDS and die, you pig. How's that? Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig. You got nothing better than to put me down, you piece of garbage? You have got nothing to do today, go eat a sausage and choke on it. Get trichinosis. Okay, do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse, who's angry at me today? Get http://www.sfgov.org/site/bdsupvrs_index.asp?id=65727me another one. Put another sodomite on.\"\n\n. He regularily comments on popular culture such as his love of the movies. He will also provide analysis of television shows such as The Sopranos, as well as daily news stories covered (or not covered at all} in the media.\n\nThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors sought to pass a resolution condemning Savage for comments he made on his show on July 5, 2007 regarding illegal immigrants. A group of students were protesting in the manner of a fast and Savage remarked, \"...let them fast until they starve to death.\" [4]\n\nAuthor\n\nMichael Savage is the author of at least 25 books, most of which were under the name of Michael Weiner and on botany and nutrition.

Included in the list of the 16 \"least wanted\" was talk show host Michael Savage. \"This is someone who has fallen into the category of fomenting hatred, of such extreme views and expressing them in such a way that it is actually likely to cause inter-community tension or even violence if that person were allowed into the country,\" Smith told BBC Breakfast. [5] As of December 2009, Savage remained on the list and as a result, Texas Rep. John Culberson is asking Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to intervene, citing Savage\u2019s need to tend to his \u201crare medicinal plant specimens from Fiji and Tonga\u201d in Kew Gardens.
