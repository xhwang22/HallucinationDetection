Provided by Mayhew Foster / Associated Press\n\nMISSOULA, Montana - Captain Mayhew Foster had an extraordinary mission: Fly captured Nazi leader Hermann Goering to the 7th Army's headquarters for interrogation.\n\nThen he took one look at the one-time heir to Adolf Hitler and commander of the fearsome Luftwaffe - all 136 kg of him - and knew he needed a bigger plane.\n\nIt was May 9, 1945, the day after World War II ended in Europe. Goering, Foster and a group of officers from the Army's 36th Infantry Division gathered on a tiny airstrip outside Kitzbuhel, Austria, to transport the highly-prized war prisoner back to Germany in an unarmed, two-man reconnaissance plane.\n\n\"They wanted to get him back where he could be debriefed. There was a strong rumor that in a mountainside in the Alps right down there in Bavaria there was a concentration of (German) military,\" Foster said. \"He just acted as though it was a nice, friendly trip.\"\n\nMayhew Foster, now 99 and living in a Missoula nursing home, recently recounted his rare one-on-one encounter with one of the most wanted Nazi leaders. Foster went on to become brigadier general of the Montana National Guard and was awarded the French Legion of Honor for his World War II service, but it was this mission that stood out as the highlight of an illustrious military career.\n\nGoering, 52, had surrendered to the US Army's 36th Infantry Division the day before. He had fallen out of favor with Hitler and hadn't played an active role at the end of the war, though he remained Reichsmarschall of Nazi Germany.\n\nBefore his capture, Goering wrote a letter to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, offering to work with Eisenhower on the conditions of the German army's surrender, according to an account of Goering's capture by Brigadier General Robert Stack kept by the 36th Infantry Division Association.\n\nAfter receiving the letter, Stack and a group of soldiers drove from the division's base near Kitzbuhel across the border into Germany and intercepted a convoy that included Goering, his wife, daughter, sister-in-law, household servants and military aides, according to the account.\n\nGoering agreed to surrender unconditionally but asked that his family be cared for, and the Nazi leader was delivered to Foster for transport the next day.\n\nFoster, who was 33 at the time, said he didn't fear getting shot down carrying such precious cargo alone in an unescorted, unarmed plane. He didn't worry about Goering taking advantage of the lack of a guard to wrest control of the aircraft.\n\nThe main problem, he said, was getting the two of them off the ground - the nimble, lightweight Piper L4 that Foster piloted in his artillery spotting missions wouldn't support both him and Goering. But the division only had the small airstrip that was fine for Foster's aircraft, but was problematic for taking off and landing larger planes.\n\nThey'd have to upgrade to the one L5 in the division's inventory, a slightly larger aircraft Foster hadn't flown in years.\n\nGoering stood on the tiny airstrip in a plain, gray uniform that was unadorned but for a pistol at his hip and a medal around his neck. Still wearing the pistol, he stepped toward the plane. A Goering aide emerged from the group that had gathered and relieved Goering of the weapon.\n\nThe Nazi leader settled into the back seat and tried to fasten his seat belt. It wouldn't stretch across his belly. He held the strap in his hand, looked at Foster and said, \"Das goot!\" - that's good.\n\nA photograph of that moment shows Foster in the cockpit and Goering seated directly behind him, his elbow jauntily propped on the plane's fuselage.\n\nThe two men spent the 55-minute flight from Kitzbuhel to Augsburg, Germany, conversing in a mix of German and English. Foster said Goering avoided any talk of Hitler or the war but appeared to relish pointing out the sites below them.\n\n\"He acted as though he was going on a sightseeing tour, or really as though I was going on a sightseeing tour and he was showing me where he grew up,\" Foster said. \"I had a .45 in a shoulder holster, but he couldn't reach that. But neither could I, because I had two hands controlling the plane.\"\n\nHe described Goering as sharp, friendly and witty, even cracking a joke when Foster asked him when Germany began manufacturing jets.\n\n\"Too late,\" Goering replied, according to Foster.\n\nAt the time, Foster was somewhat less generous in describing the man. In a letter to his wife, Virginia Lou Foster, written soon after the mission, Foster told her that the Nazi leader was \"effeminate\" and \"gave me the creeps\".\n\n\"Several times I had the impulse to turn the plane over and see if I could shake him out but he was wedged in like a champagne cork,\" Foster wrote.\n\nAfter landing, Foster asked his passenger to sign a blank flight report. The prisoner scrawled \"Hermann Goering Reichsmarschall\" across the paper, which Foster folded and put in his pocket.\n\nIt's a document that he still has, one of Foster's most prized possessions alongside a collection of photographs of Goering, Hitler and other snapshots from the days of the Third Reich.\n\nThere was just a single jeep at the airstrip to meet the arriving flight carrying the world's most famous war prisoner. Foster rode with Goering to the gates of the 7th Army Headquarters and formally turned him over to the intelligence officer without ceremony.\n\nIt turned out, Foster learned later, those rumors of German troops hiding in the Bavarian Alps were untrue. Goering stood trial at Nuremberg, and the next year he was found guilty of war crimes.\n\nGoering was sentenced to hang, but he committed suicide instead by swallowing a cyanide capsule.\n\nSixty-five years later, Foster is trim, sharp and carries himself as a former military officer.\n\nHe still reflects on his rare insight into the Nazi leadership, and he recognizes that the experience had shifted his perceptions of the enemy. It allowed him to see the human side of those he had only known as caricatures.\n\n\"I could see that he was like one of our officers if he'd been picked up,\" Foster said. \"I wouldn't say it changed my view of the war but it showed me that there are ...\" He broke off.\n\n\"Well, I questioned all that we knew about these vicious people,\" he said.\n\nAssociated Press"}, {"url": "https://www.education.ox.ac.uk/people/ken-mayhew/", "page_content": "Ken Mayhew is Emeritus Professor of Education and Economic Performance and Emeritus Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford.\n\nHe is an Extraordinary Professor at Maastricht University, a Director of the Centre for Tutorial Teaching and has recently finished a term as a member of the Department for Education\u2019s Skills and Productivity Board.

I had a.45 in a shoulder holster, but he couldn\"t reach that. But neither could I, because I had two hands controlling the plane.\" Foster further recalled G\u00f6ring as having been sharp, friendly, and witty, having joked when Foster asked him when Germany began manufacturing jets. \"Too late,\" G\u00f6ring was said to have answered. Foster continued: \"I could see that he was like one of our officers if he\"d been picked up. I wouldn\"t say it changed my view of the war, but it showed me that there are..

After being educated at Westminster School, he worked with his father for three years. However, it was a stormy relationship. According to his biographer, Deborah Vlock: \"One of seventeen children and the fourth of seven sons, Mayhew failed to live up to his father's expectations; a prominent solicitor and a rigid patriarch, Joshua Mayhew apprenticed each of his sons to the law, and each, except one, eventually pursued other interests. Almost all of them, including Henry, were disinherited as a result (after his father's death, Henry received a legacy of \u00a31 per week). Henry was particularly ill-suited to legal study, and nearly caused Joshua's arrest by neglecting to file some important documents.\"\n\nIn 1831 Mayhew decided to become a writer. For the next eight years worked for the journal, Figaro in London. Mayhew also wrote a well-received play, The Wandering Minstrel (1834). He also co-wrote But However (1838).\n\n\n\nIn 1841 Mayhew joined with Mark Lemon, a fellow journalist and playwright, to start a a new journal, Punch Magazine. The two men were initially joint-editors and recruited a group of talented writers and illustrators to join the venture, including Douglas Jerrold, Shirley Brooks, Angus Reach, John Leech and Richard Doyle. In the early years the magazine sold about 6,000 copies a week. However, sales of 10,000 were needed to cover the costs of the venture.\n\nIn December 1842 it was decided to sell the magazine to Bradbury & Evans. Mark Lemon was reappointed as editor and Henry Mayhew was given the role of \"suggester-in-chief\". Mayhew wrote his last article for Punch Magazine in February, 1845. Mayhew now launched Iron Times, a railway magazine that lost him so much money that in 1846 he ended up in the Court of Bankruptcy.\n\nThe summer of 1849 saw a serious outbreak of cholera. Within three months, an estimated 13,000 people in London died from the disease. On 24th September, Mayhew wrote an article on the impact of cholera on the working-class district of Bermondsey. Soon afterwards Mayhew suggested to the editor, John Douglas Cook, that the newspaper should carry out an investigation into the condition of the labouring classes in England and Wales. Cook agreed and recruited Angus Reach, Charles Mackay and Shirley Brooks to help Mayhew collect the material.\n\nThe first article appeared on 18th October 1849. Mayhew concentrated on London and the rest of the team were assigned other parts of England and Wales to investigate. An article appeared every day for the rest of the year and for most of 1850. Mayhew wrote two of these a week and the rest were written by Reach, Brooks, Mackay and some unnamed provincial journalists.\n\nThe articles in the Morning Chronicle received a lot of attention. The Economist attacked the publication of such material that it believed was \"unthinkingly increasing the enormous funds already profusely destined to charitable purposes, adding to the number of virtual paupers, and encouraging a reliance on public sympathy for help instead on self-exertion.\"\n\nDouglas Jerrold wrote to a friend in February, 1850: \"Do you read the Morning Chronicle? Do you devour those marvellous revelations of the inferno of misery, of wretchedness, that is smouldering under our feet? We live in a mockery of Christianity that, with the thought of its hypocrisy, makes me sick. We know nothing of this terrible life that is about us - us, in our smug respectability. To read of the sufferings of one class, and the avarice, the tyranny, the pocket cannibalism of the other, makes one almost wonder that the world should go on. And when we see the spires of pleasant churches pointing to Heaven, and are told - paying thousands to Bishops for the glad intelligence - that we are Christians!. The cant of this country is enough to poison the atmosphere.\"\n\nChristian Socialists, such as Charles Kingsley, Thomas Hughes and F. D. Maurice praised Mayhew and the Morning Chronicle. Radicals also approved and newspapers such as the Northern Star and the Red Republican published substantial extracts from these reports. Octavia Hill was one of those who read Mayhew's work and was inspired into action. It is also claimed that the articles influenced the writings of Charles Dickens.\n\nHenry Mayhew's collected articles on poverty were eventually published as London Labour and London Poor (1851). Mayhew's investigation into the plight of the poor revealed the impact that unemployment, starvation and disease was having on the working class. Deborah Vlock has argued: \"It remains a seminal study of London street life in the middle of the century, and has been often reprinted. It is required reading for anyone interested in the minutest details of Victorian lower-class life, such as what kinds of foods were sold on the streets, how financial transactions with street-sellers were conducted, and how vendors \u2018cried\u2019 their wares.\"\n\n\n\nHenry Mayhew\n\nIn a talk he gave to a group of tailors Mayhew attempted to defend the moral behaviour of the working-classes: \"It is easy enough to be moral after a good dinner beside a snug coal fire, and with our hearts well warmed with fine old port. It is easy enough for those that can enjoy these things daily to pay their poor-rates, rent their pew, and love their neighbours as themselves: but place the self-same \"highly respectable\" people on a raft without sup or bite on the high seas, and they would toss up who should eat their fellows. Morality on \u00a35,000 a year in Belgrave Square is a very different thing to morality on slop-wages in Bethnal Green.\"\n\nIn 1856 Mayhew started a new series of articles for the Morning Chronicle entitled The Great World of London. The articles appeared monthly and those dealing with crime and punishment were collected together and published as a book called The Criminal Prisons of London (1862). Another book based on newspaper articles he had written was published as London Characters (1874).\n\nMayhew wrote books on a wide variety of different subjects including novels, The Good Genius (1847) and Whom to Marry (1848), and historical work such as German Life and Manners in Saxony (1864) and The Boyhood of Martin Luther (1865).\n\nHenry Mayhew died on 25th July, 1887, and was buried at Kensal Green."}, {"url": "https://victorianweb.org/history/mayhew.html", "page_content": "Journalist and writer.

His railway magazine, The Iron Times, bankrupted him. As a result he was disinherited. He struggled to make a living for the rest of life. He was a playwright (of farces), comic novelist, author of children's books, German travel books, and a biographer. He married Jane Jerrold, the daughter of Douglas Jerrold, the writer. They had two children.\n\nIn 1849 he wrote an article about an outbreak of cholera. It led to a series of articles in the Morning Chronicle which were collected in three volumes in 1851 under the title London Labour and the London Poor. They covered an astonishing array of people scraping a living not only on the streets of London, but in the sewers, on the foreshore, on the river and docks: patterers and chaunters (see \"Rhyming Slang\"), mudlarks, toshers (scavengers in the sewers), Punch and Judy men, pure finders (they collected dog droppings for tanneries), rat catchers, dog-nappers and swindlers.

American landscape painter Richard Mayhew produced impressionistic works in both muted and vivid colors. He was praised for concentrating on landscapes when the genre was unpopular. The Hudson River school (which celebrated the natural beauty of the American landscape), the Barbizon school (which championed naturalism), and impressionists such as Claude Monet all influenced Mayhew\u2019s work.\n\nMayhew was born on April 3, 1924, in Amityville, New York, to parents of Native American and African American descent. He moved to New York, New York, in the mid-1940s. After serving in the U.S. Marines during World War II, Mayhew worked as a medical illustrator. He also began taking classes at the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Pratt Institute, which are both located in Brooklyn, New York. During this time Mayhew supplemented his income by illustrating children\u2019s books and by performing in jazz groups. His first solo exhibition was in 1955 at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. These early works were praised for his use of color and light.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early \u201960s, Mayhew received several grants, which allowed him to study in Europe. He returned to the United States in 1962, at which time he met frequently with a group of African American artists in New York. They discussed the problem of artists and the civil rights movement in the 1960s. The group, which was known as Spiral, included such artists as Romare Bearden, Hale Woodruff, Charles Alston, and Norman Lewis. Some members of the group believed it was necessary for African American artists to create protest paintings as evidence of their solidarity with the rest of the black community. Although Mayhew\u2019s paintings were not political in tone, he used his landscapes to express feelings, often of a renewal brought forth after surviving racial oppression. During this time Mayhew also began to experiment with paint color, applying opaque paint on top of colored paint so that the base layer showed through.\n\nFrom the early 1960s through the mid-\u201970s Mayhew taught at various schools, including the Brooklyn Museum of Art for five years. In 1977 he became a professor of visual arts at Pennsylvania State University. Mayhew retired from teaching in 1991 but continued to paint into the 21st century. His later works incorporate vivid colors and often focus on a lone tree.

He was sent to Westminster school, but ran away to sea. He sailed to India, and on his return studied law for a short time under his father. He began his journalistic career by founding, with Gilbert \u00e0 Beckett, in 1831, a weekly paper, Figaro in London. This was followed in 1832 by a short-lived paper called The Thief; and he produced one or two successful farces. His brothers Horace (1816\u20131872) and Augustus Septimus (1826\u20131875) were also journalists, and with them Henry occasionally collaborated, notably with the younger in The Greatest Plague of Life (1847) and in Acting Charades (1850). In 1841 Henry Mayhew was one of the leading spirits in the foundation of Punch, of which he was for the first two years joint-editor with Mark Lemon. He afterwards wrote on all kinds of subjects, and published a number of volumes of no permanent reputation\u2014humorous stories, travel and practical handbooks. He is credited with being the first to \u201cwrite up\u201d the poverty side of London life from a philanthropic point of view; with the collaboration of John Binny and others he published London Labour and London Poor (1851; completed 1864) and other works on social and economic questions. He died in London, on the 25th of July 1887. Horace Mayhew was for some years sub-editor of Punch, and was the author of several humorous publications and plays. The books of Horace and Augustus Mayhew owe their survival chiefly to Cruikshank\u2019s illustrations.\n\nIn the World of London, indeed, we find almost every geographic species of the human family.

If the Carib Islands have their savages, the English Capital has types almost as brutal and uncivilized as they. If India has its Thugs, London has its garotte men. Henry Mayhew, The Criminal Prisons of London (1862), p. 5\n\nHenry Mayhew was born on 25 November 1812 in London, one of seventeen children of Joshua Mayhew. He was educated at Westminster School before running away from his studies to sea. He then served with the East India Company as a midshipman on a ship bound for Calcutta. He returned after several years, in 1829, becoming a trainee lawyer in Wales. He left this and became a freelance journalist. He contributed to The Thief, a readers\u2019 digest, followed quickly by editing a weekly journal \u2013 Figaro in London. Mayhew reputedly fled his creditors and holed up at The Erwood Inn, a small public house in the village of Erwood, south of Builth Wells in Wales.\n\nIn 1835 Mayhew found himself in a state of debt and, along with a fellow writer, escaped to Paris to avoid his creditors. He spent his time writing and in the company of other writers including William Thackeray and Douglas Jerrold. Mayhew spent over ten years in Paris returning to England in the 1850s whereby he was involved in several literary adventures, mostly the writing of plays. Two of his plays \u2013 But, However and the Wandering Minstrel \u2013 were successful, whilst his early work Figaro in London was less successful.\n\nOn 17 July 1841 Mayhew cofounded Punch magazine. At its founding the magazine was jointly edited by Mayhew and Mark Lemon. The two men hired a group of writers and illustrators, including Douglas Jerrold, Angus Reach, John Leech, Richard Doyle and Shirley Brooks. Initially it was subtitled The London Charivari, this being a reference to a satirical humour magazine published in France under the title Le Charivari (a work read often whilst Mayhew was in Paris).\n\nPunch was an unexpected success, selling about 6,000 copies a week in the early years. However, sales of as many as 10,000 issues a week were required to cover all costs of the magazine. In December 1842, the magazine was sold to Bradbury and Evans; Mayhew resigned as joint editor, and he continued at the magazine as \u201csuggestor in chief\u201d with Mark Lemon re-appointed as editor. Mayhew eventually severed his connection with the magazine, writing his last article in February 1845. His brother Horace stayed on the board of Punch until his own death.\n\nThe Punch years gave Mayhew the opportunity to meet talented illustrators who he later employed to work from daguerreotypes on London Labour and the London Poor. Following Punch magazine, Mayhew launched Iron Times, a railway magazine. However this venture lost Mayhew so much money that he was forced to appear in a Court of Bankruptcy in 1846.\n\nIn 1842 Mayhew contributed to the pioneering Illustrated London News. By this time Mayhew had become reasonably secure financially, had settled his debts and married Jane Jerrold (d. 1880), the daughter of his friend Douglas Jerrold.\n\nLondon Labour and the London Poor is today the work for which Myhew is best known. Originally appearing as a series of articles, the material was initially collected into three volumes in 1851; the 1861 edition included a fourth volume, co-written with Bracebridge Hemyng, John Binny and Andrew Halliday, on the lives of prostitutes, thieves and beggars. This Extra Volume took a more general and statistical approach to its subject than Volumes 1 to 3.\n\nMayhew wrote in volume one: \u201cI shall consider the whole of the metropolitan poor under three separate phases, according as they will work, they can\u2019t work, and they won\u2019t work\u201d. He interviewed everyone \u2013 beggars, street-entertainers (such as Punch and Judy men), market traders, prostitutes, labourers, sweatshop workers, even down to the \u201cmudlarks\u201d who searched the stinking mud on the banks of the River Thames for wood, metal, rope and coal from passing ships, and the \u201cpure-finders\u201d who gathered dog faeces to sell to tanners. He described their clothes, how and where they lived, their entertainments and customs, and made detailed estimates of the numbers and incomes of those practising each trade. The books show how marginal and precarious many people\u2019s lives were, in what, at that time, was the richest city in the world.\n\nLater works included The Criminal Prisons of London (1862), The Boyhood of Martin Luther (1863), German Life and Manners as Seen in Saxony at the Present Day (1865), and London Characters (1881)\n\nHe died on 25 July 1887."}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/thomas-mayhew/biography", "page_content": "Thomas Mayhew Biography\n\nThis article is about the early Puritan settler in M*achusetts. For the English cabinetmaker, see Ince and Mayhew.\n\nGovernor Thomas Mayhew, the Elder (March 31, 1593 \u2013 March 25, 1682) established the first European settlement on Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and adjacent islands in 1642. He is one of the editors of the Bay Psalm Book, the first book published in the Thirteen Colonies. His *istant Peter Foulger was the grandfather of Benjamin Franklin.\n\nBiography\n\nMarker for Thomas Mayhew homestead in Watertown, M*achusetts\n\nThomas Mayhew was born in Tisbury, in the county of Wiltshire in England. He married Anna (also called Hanna and Abigail) Parkhurst, born about 1600, in Hampshire, England, daughter of Matthew Parkhurst. In 1621 they had a son, Thomas, the Younger, baptised in Hanna's home town of Southampton. Two years later they had another child, Robert Mayhew, baptized in Tisbury.\n\nThe family left England in 1631/2 during the Great Migration of Puritans that brought 20,000 settlers to M*achusetts in thirteen years. Through the agency of Matthew Cradock of London, Mayhew had been appointed to manage properties in Medford, M*achusetts, and to engage in trade and shipbuilding. In or about 1633, Mayhew's wife Anna died, and about 1634 he returned to England for a business meeting with Cradock. While in England, he married Jane Gallion (1602\u20131666), and brought her back to New England with him. Their daughter Hannah was born in 1635, and three more daughters, Mary (1639), Martha (1642), and Bethiah, followed. Martha is the 7th great grandmother to the world-famous singer and songwriter Taylor Swift.\n\nIn 1641, Thomas secured Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, the Elizabeth Islands, and other islands as a proprietary colony from Sir Ferdinando Gorges and the Earl of Stirling. This enabled him to transfer his business operations there. With the help of his son Thomas, a settlement was established and farming and whaling enterprises were begun.\n\nThe Mayhews had great success in regard to Indian policy. Because of the fair treatment of the Indians there, the colony was protected from the bloodshed that occurred elsewhere, in King Philip's War. In 1646, the General Court of M*achusetts directed the religious leaders of the colony to select two among them to serve as missionaries to the natives. So great was the interest aroused by this venture that a society was formed in England also to support the missionaries. Unfortunately a m*ive conflict broke out, called King Philip's War (1675\u201376), which resulted in many deaths of both the settlers and the natives. However, three prominent names appear. They are: John Eliot (known as the Apostle to the Indians); Thomas Mayhew (who was already ministering to the natives); and, three generations later, Eleazar Wheelock, who established \"Doctor Wheelock's Academy for the promotion of Christianity and civility among the savage Indians of this continent\" (now known as Dartmouth College).\n\nIn 1657, the younger Thomas Mayhew was drowned when a ship he was travelling in was lost at sea on a voyage to England. Mayhew's three grandsons Matthew Mayhew (born 1648), Thomas (born 1650), John (born 1652), and other members of his family *isted him in running his business and government.\n\nTranscription of Watertown marker: \"HERE BY THE ANCIENT FORDTHE LANDING AND THE WEIRWAS THE HOMESTALL OFTHOMAS MAYHEW:A LEADER IN WATERTOWN AFFAIRSFROM 1635 TO 1645.AFTERWARDS WITH HIS SON,THE REV. THOMAS MAYHEW,HE LABORED AMONG THE INDIANSAT MARTHA'S VINEYARD.\"\n\nColonizing Dukes County\n\nIn 1641, while engaged in business ventures in the vicinity of Boston, Mayhew succeeded in acquiring the rights to the islands that now cons*ute Dukes County and Nantucket County: Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and the Elizabeth Islands. He bought the County for 40 pounds and two beaver skin hats from William Alexander, the 2nd Earl of Stirling. To resolve a conflicting ownership claim, he also paid off Sir Ferdinando Gorges, thereby acquiring a clear *le.\n\nMayhew established himself as governor of Martha's Vineyard in 1642 and sent his son, Thomas the Younger, with about forty families to settle there. He himself followed four years later. Together he and the younger Thomas established Martha's Vineyard's first settlement and called it Great Harbor, now Edgartown.\n\nRelations with the natives\n\nMayhew and his fellow settlers found a large and economically stable native population of about 3,000 living in permanent villages, led by four sachems (chiefs). Relations between the first settlers and their Wampanoag neighbors were peaceful and courteous. Under the leadership of his son, a minister, they ins*uted a policy of respect and fair dealing with the Wampanoag natives that was unequaled anywhere. One of the first of Mayhew's orders was that no land was to be taken from the native islanders, the Wampanoags, without their consent or without fair payment. From this time forward, the colonial settlers and Wampanoag lived without the bloodshed that marked the history of European colonies elsewhere in the New World.\n\nFrom the beginning, Mayhew had worked to preserve the original political ins*utions of the native population. Religion and government were distinct matters, he told the chiefs. When one of your subjects becomes a Christian, he is still under your jurisdiction. Wampanoag land was guarded against further encroachment by white settlers. So successful were these policies that during the bloody battles of King Philip's War, in 1675-1676, the Vineyard's native population never stirred, although they outnumbered the settlers on the island by twenty to one.\n\nSpreading religion\n\nBy 1660 there were about 85 white people living peaceably among the natives, earning their living by farming and fishing. The Mayhew family, which from that time forth became an integral part of island history, wanted to share its religion with the natives, but the Wampanoags were not too interested, having their own spiritual faith. However, once it was clear that, though Mayhew was the governor, the sachems remained in charge of their people, some became curious about the white man's God. When a native named Hiacoomes expressed an interest, Mayhew invited him into his home and instructed him in English and Christianity. Hiacoomes, in return, taught Mayhew the native language. As soon as Mayhew could converse with the natives, he would some days \"walk 20 miles through uncut forests to preach the Gospel...in wigwam or open field\".\n\nThere is a stained gl* window in the baptismal font in the National Cathedral in Washington D.C. depicting Rev. Thomas Mayhew Jr. baptizing a native.\n\nChange was in the air though, for the world outside this small island was unsettled. There were more visitors from off island and some stayed, challenging the Mayhew government, while Baptists and Methodists arrived to make converts from the established Congregational Church.\n\nFrom colony to aristocracy\n\nThrough a maze of conflicting land grants, changing political allegiances, and settler unrest, Mayhew, who styled himself \"Governour Mayhew\", began to rule his island with an iron hand. The most serious threat to his control came in 1665 when Martha's Vineyard was included in the lands placed under the king's brother, the Duke of York. After much delay, a settlement, worked out in 1671, confirmed the Mayhew patent and named Mayhew \"Governour and Chiefe Magistrate\" for life. At the same time, a patent was issued erecting the Manor of Tisbury in the southwestern part of the island. The Governor and his grandson Matthew were made \"joint Lords of the Manor of Tisbury\", and the inhabitants became manorial tenants subject to the feudal jurisdiction of the Mayhews. This full-fledged feudal manor appears to have been the only such ins*ution actually established in New England.\n\nThe attempt of the Mayhews to create a hereditary aristocracy on the Vineyard met with increasing opposition as more and more colonists arrived. When the Dutch temporarily recaptured New York in 1673, open rebellion broke out and this lasted until the colonial government regained control over New York and restored the authority of the Mayhews on the island. The old patriarch died in 1682, at the age of eight-nine. Nine years later the political rule of his family ended when Martha's Vineyard was annexed by M*achusetts after the Glorious Revolution in England, but the manorial land tenure remained. Although some of the Mayhews clung to the \"pleasant fiction\" of their manorial rights almost until the American Revolution and received token quit rents as late as 1732, feudalism on Martha's Vineyard died the same slow, lingering but certain death it did elsewhere in the colonies.\n\nMissionary work\n\nKenneth Scott Latourette has concluded that the Missionary Mayhews of Martha's Vineyard represent what is probably the longest and most persistent missionary endeavor in the annals of all Christendom. The elder Thomas Mayhew, known for his missionary work, was not concerned for Indian souls when he settled on his island; he sought only to improve his social and economic position. His son, Thomas Mayhew the Younger, is credited with the launching an Indian mission. Like his father, he had emigrated from England. Somewhere, he received a liberal education, apparently from private tutors, and after moving to the Vineyard to begin the white settlement there he became pastor of the small Anglican church as well as acting governor in his father's absence. He soon discovered that he could not refuse the challenge he found among the three thousand Pokanaukets, a branch of the mainland Narragansetts, who far outnumbered the whites, so an effective settlement required friendly relations with the Indians. But Thomas the Younger appears to have been motivated largely by spiritual concern, while his father and other members of the family enjoyed the practical results of the Indian mission. The son gradually abandoned most of his secular tasks and spent the remainder of his life among the natives. Progress was slow at first, but by the end of 1652 there were 283 converts, a school for Indian children, and two Indian meetings each Sabbath. The Praying Indians of Martha's Vineyard who said grace before meals became a topic of conversation on both sides of the Atlantic. Thomas Mayhew the Younger carried on his missionary work with little heed for his personal fortunes. As the elder Mayhew put it, his son had followed this work \"when 'twas bare with him for food and rayment, and when indeede there was nothing in sight any waies but Gods promises.\" The situation was improved somewhat by the formation in 1649 of a London missionary society, usually called the New England Company, which in a few years began to provide substantial aid for the Mayhews and other missionaries.\n\nIn the fall of 1657, Thomas Mayhew the Younger sailed for England on a trip combining an appeal for missionary funds with personal business. After leaving Boston Harbor, the ship was never seen again. The death of his only son at the age of thirty-six was a heavy blow to Mayhew and greatly increased the burdens he carried in old age. He made repeated efforts to find a replacement to continue his son's ministry to the Indians, but no minister who knew the language or was willing to learn could be induced to settle permanently on the island, so at the age of sixty Mayhew, who had started as a merchant, then turned landed proprietor, became a missionary in his son's place. For the next twenty-five years he traveled on foot as far as twenty miles to preach once a week at the Indian *embly or to visit the native camps.\n\nDeath\n\nWhen the venerable Governor Mayhew became ill one Sunday evening in 1682, he calmly informed his friends and relatives that \"his Sickness would now be to Death, and he was well contented therewith, being full of Days, and satisfied with Life\". His great-grandson, Experience Mayhew, a son of John, was only eight at the time, but he clearly remembered being led to the bedside to receive from the dying man a blessing \"in the Name of the Lord\". Matthew Mayhew, the eldest grandson, succeeded his military and civil duties. Rev. John Mayhew, the youngest grandson and grandfather of Jonathan Mayhew, continued his missionary work to the Indians. Thomas, another grandson, became a Judge of M*achusetts.\n\nHis descendant Jonathan Mayhew was a prominent 18th-century Boston clergyman who coined the phrase \"No taxation without representation.\"\n\nDescendants\n\nMatthew Mayhew (1648\u20131710), Martha's Vineyard colonist, politician and missionary\n\nExperience Mayhew (1673\u20131758), Martha's Vineyard colonist and missionary\n\nJoseph Mayhew (1709/10\u20131782), Martha's Vineyard colonist, politician, and missionary\n\nJonathan Mayhew (1720\u20131766), Congregationalist minister and Patriot\n\nJonathan Mayhew Wainwright I (1792\u20131854), Episcopal Bishop of New York\n\nCharles Tupper (1821\u20131915), 6th Prime Minister of Canada\n\nJonathan Mayhew Wainwright II (1821\u20131863) U.S. Navy officer during the American Civil War\n\nElla Edes (1832\u20131916) American writer, newspaper correspondent, and Catholic activist\n\nJonathan M.

We analyzed participants\u2019 responses with an ecological lens (Bronfenbrenner, 1986) to determine the (a) Challenges and Supports in the Youth-School Relationship (Microsystem) and (b) Challenges and Supports in the Foster Home-School Relationship (Mesosystem). Challenges in the Youth-School Relationship included differential treatment, teacher misunderstanding, and school is not a priority. Challenges in the Foster Parent\u2013School Relationship included complexity of accommodations, strained relationships with teachers, and lack of school\u2013home partnership.\n\nChallenges in the Youth-School Relationship (Microsystem)\n\nMost teachers (n = 18; 82%), foster parents (n = 14; 82%), and former foster youth (n = 8; 67%) shared the opinion that foster youth\u2019s strained relationships with their schools creates a barrier to their academic success. This disconnect between foster youth and schools occurs for several reasons, according to participants. Specifically, they described the following challenges to foster youth\u2019s ability to form strong relationships with schools, which in turn impeded their academic success: differential treatment (lower academic expectations, pity), misunderstanding/lack of trauma-sensitive approach, and need to prioritize other life circumstances ahead of education.\n\nDifferential Treatment: Lower Expectations\n\nFoster parents, teachers, and former foster youth shared the perception that teachers often appear to have low(er) expectations for foster youth\u2019s abilities and performance in school. Foster parents explained that they wished that their children were treated with the same expectations as children living with their biological parents; they wanted their children to be inspired to be their best, rather than being allowed to float through the system to graduation. Jerome, a foster father, expressed:\n\nJohnny needs to read at the fourth-grade level, by the fourth grade. Not just pass him on\u2026 And in a lot of ways, the schools have failed to realize that, particularly when it comes to foster children because the expectations are very low when it comes to foster kids.\n\nHe went on to say that rather than to express sympathy or pity to foster children, teachers should, \u201c\u2026 build them up, make them feel like they can conquer the world.\u201d\n\nOn a similar note, teachers expressed frustration with co-workers and administration who pressure them to promote students, regardless of whether they have grasped the material. This reveals how teachers faced pressure from broader systems which in turn likely affected the quality of education that foster youth received. Ken, a vocational high school teacher, exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018sweep \u2018em under the rug, make sure they graduate, so our graduate numbers are up,\u2019 you know, and\u2014 \u2018The hell with the kid and the rest of their life!\u2019\u201d Ken and others described a school environment where it felt that the school\u2019s reputation and graduation rates were prioritized over ensuring that students in foster care learn the material necessary for success, which has long-term impacts on foster youth\u2019s outcomes.\n\nDifferential Treatment: Pity\n\nMost former foster youth also expressed feeling that teachers treated them differently from other students, specifically with pity, which led to a non-existent or at least more distant relationship with their educators than their peers who were not in foster care. Lauren, a former foster youth, explained that the pity she experienced from her teachers because she was in foster care contributed to her lack of trust in them. She said, \u201cThat shit [pity] makes it [school] worse so I wouldn\u2019t even like\u2014I don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t trust teachers.\u201d Two youth noted that they felt embarrassed when teachers would treat them like a \u201ccharity case\u201d by bringing them second-hand clothing.\n\nIn contrast, Layla, a former foster youth, described being recognized at her high school graduation by teachers for her achievements in school and how it impacted her in a positive way. She described the event:\n\nThe teachers select three students and I was one of them\u2026 they just talked about some of my obstacles and how I overcame them. They gave me a flower. That made me feel happy that out of so many kids, I was one of the ones that got picked to be talked about.\n\nLayla\u2019s narrative demonstrates how foster youth can feel more connected to their schools when teachers recognize their efforts, despite their struggles, rather than express pity.\n\nTeacher Misunderstanding: Lack of Trauma-Sensitive Approach\n\nTeachers\u2019 misinterpretation of behavior was also described as a strain on the relationship between students in foster care and the schools they attended. Foster parents perceived teachers as being ill-equipped to handle their foster children\u2019s behaviors, cognitive delays, and traumatic histories. For example, Shannon, a foster mother, stated:\n\nThat special ed [sic] teacher, I\u2019m not impressed with. I find her to be very cold. I find her to be very punitive to him. She\u2019s always giving him lunch suspensions. I\u2019m like, \u2018You can\u2019t punish him for things he truly cannot control. If it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve seen that he can control, then maybe there should be a consequence. Most of the stuff he\u2019s dealing with now he truly cannot control; truly.\u2019\n\nShannon expresses frustration with what she perceives as an unfair and misplaced (mis)attribution of her foster son\u2019s behavior as purposeful and calculated, rather than reflecting a difficult early life history, which undermined her confidence and faith in this teacher to be a supportive force in his education.\n\nSome foster parents explained that they took a proactive approach and gave teachers \u201ca heads up\u201d about tips on how to effectively handle their children\u2019s disruptive behavior or how to prevent the behavior altogether, before their children were entering the classroom for the first time. For example, foster parents described informing teachers about the language they used at home to discuss consequences and expectations so that the student understands what is and is not appropriate at school. Susan, a foster parent, explained that she spoke with her child\u2019s teachers about coping strategies she has taught her child to use at school, \u201cOne of the tools is, if you find yourself getting out of control, remove yourself from the situation. Go for a walk, find a quiet space, ask if you can leave.\u201d Other foster parents were open with teachers about their child\u2019s abuse or neglect history to help the teacher recognize signs of distress that may appear to be stemming from disrespect.\n\nLike foster parents, former foster youth explained that because they felt that their teachers misunderstood their problematic behaviors and interpreted through the lens of disobedience or malice, it was a struggle to form connections with them. Some described feeling that they were categorized as a \u201cproblem kid,\u201d \u201cbad kid,\u201d and even \u201cgarbage\u201d because teachers and administrators tried to \u201cput them in a box\u201d based on their foster care status. Others reflected on times when teachers reached out to learn more about their situation. Dennis reported, \u201cThey [teachers] saw that I was kind of down and they took me aside in the hallway and asked what\u2019s wrong and stuff like that. Cause my life\u2019s kind of difficult. It\u2019s a weird situation.\u201d Thus, youth voiced the importance for teachers to consider that a student in foster care may have an underlying trauma history that impacts their ability to function appropriately at school, rather than taking a perspective that the student is acting purely out of choice or malcontent. What these students need to succeed at school, according to youth, is an approach that is sensitive to their histories.\n\nSchool Is Not (and Cannot Be) Top Priority\n\nAn additional challenge to foster youth\u2019s academic success was their difficulty of prioritizing school in general. Foster parents, teachers, and the youth themselves noted that although they had the desire to do well in school, their life circumstances (e.g., need for a stable home and family) prevented them from being able to focus on schoolwork. Anna, a high school psychology teacher, explained:\n\nEducation is not the biggest concern for those students. It\u2019s their welfare, their safety\u2026if you look at Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy, they don\u2019t care about anything until they feel loved. Until they have their needs taken care of, until they feel safe and they feel loved. And then, education will become something that they\u2019re concerned about.\n\nFoster parents agreed that youth in foster care often struggle with schoolwork, not because of lack of effort, but because they have \u201cbigger fish to fry\u201d (e.g., their history of trauma and separation from their biological families). Madeline, a foster parent, empathically stated, \u201cIf you have all of these other things on your mind, how can you be expected to care about your spelling test?\u201d Former foster youth also recognized that their mental health and family stressors negatively impacted their school performance. Angelina explained how her mood and motivation were affected by being removed from her biological family home and placed into foster care: \u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t happy. I didn\u2019t want to go to school; I didn\u2019t want to do anything. It was just that and I wasn\u2019t motivated at all. It stopped me from doing the things I wanted to do.\u201d Thus, foster youth find it difficult and sometimes impossible to prioritize school when they face other more important obstacles that stem from perceived lack of safety and instability at home.\n\nChallenges in the Foster Parent\u2013School Relationship (Mesosystem)\n\nIn addition to exploring the challenges that arise in relationships between foster youth and their schools, it is also important to address the impact of the relationship between foster parents and schools on foster youths\u2019 academic experiences. Teachers (n = 19; 86%) and foster parents (n = 16; 89%) described a disconnect (i.e., a lack of mutual understanding, a lack of communication, and a lack of agreement) in the relationship between foster parents and schools as a potentially negative influence on a foster child\u2019s school performance. These participants explained that (a) obtaining special education accommodations for foster youth was complicated for foster parents; and (b) school\u2013foster home communication was strained.\n\nComplexity of Accommodations\n\nMost foster parents of children with special needs expressed frustration with the complexity of the special education process, which is sometimes exacerbated for foster parents because the children may have already had a plan in place before they entered their foster home. For instance, Connie explained:\n\nWhen you first become a foster parent, you have no idea. You have no idea\u2026At first, you go in there and you sit in the meetings and you\u2019re very meek and you think that the school is doing the best that they can for the kid. You accept whatever they say. You sign the IEP [Individualized Education Plan] and you go on.\n\nShe echoed many foster parents\u2019 concerns that they are intimidated by the special education process and although they want to do what is best for their children, they put their trust in the school and often do not question their decisions regarding accommodations. Other foster parents, like Francis, took advantage of the opportunity to have a DCF educational advocate (i.e., a representative from DCF with specialization in the education system) accompany her to IEP meetings because, according to her, \u201c\u2026you have to be a lawyer to figure it all out. [Laughs]. I need somebody. I\u2019m not stupid by any means, but this is out of my league.\u201d However, schools are not always receptive to foster parents bringing their \u201cteam\u201d to meetings, which creates an additional barrier for foster parents. As Francis went on to describe:\n\nI\u2019ll be there [IEP meeting] with the advocate. I\u2019m also bringing two DCF workers. When I told the school, she emailed me back and she said, \u2018This is not a personal thing for you to invite your friends to come along.\u2019 I thought, Oh my gosh. I didn\u2019t even bother to argue with her.\n\nAnother parent described that when she told the school she was going to be accompanied by her foster child\u2019s attorney at the IEP meeting, the school delayed the meeting because they \u201cwanted their attorney there too.\u201d These foster parents sometimes perceive the special education process as intimidating, confusing, and frustrating, which affects their child\u2019s ability to obtain appropriate services.\n\nFoster Parents: Strained Relationships with Teachers\n\nIn addition to the difficulties with formal special education meetings and accommodations, foster parents described strained relationships with teachers as problematic for foster youth\u2019s school experiences. Their perspective was that teachers often did not consider them \u201creal\u201d parents who \u201cknew the ins and outs\u201d of their foster children. In turn, this sometimes meant that teachers were not adequately communicating with foster parents about their children\u2019s performance in school, according to some foster parents. Further, the perception that teachers did not respect foster parents led to uncomfortable confrontations and disagreements between foster parents and teachers regarding how best to educate the children. Elaine, a foster parent, explained that she went to great lengths to communicate her child\u2019s special needs with the school and that his history of trauma was important to consider when managing his behavior. However, on a rough day, she said:\n\nMy kid went into flight, fight, or fright and they didn\u2019t know what to do with him\u2026 I\u2019m reminding them that my son can never be put in one of those [isolated time out room] because of the trauma that he\u2019s been put through, that that will just turn a bad situation worse. That\u2019s not going to calm him down. So, this particular day, they put him there. He\u2019s in the time out space, he\u2019s screaming.\n\nElaine\u2019s experience is one that other foster parents shared; they explained that their suggestions for how teachers can handle their traumatized children in the classroom were unheard and disregarded, even though they felt they were specific about what might trigger their child (e.g., isolation, physical contact), gave schools empirical data, and provided suggestions from medical professionals and therapists. Similar to former foster youth, foster parents voiced that they would like to be treated equally to biological parents with regard to all aspects of their children\u2019s educational experiences. That is, foster parents would like schools to provide the same level of respect and communication to them as they do for other parents to ensure that children in care receive the same educational experiences as their peers.\n\nTeachers: Lack of Home\u2013School Partnership\n\nSome teachers, on the other hand, explained that they had also felt unheard and disrespected by foster parents. Some described their efforts to work as a team with foster parents to improve their child\u2019s behavior and/or academic performance at school but noted that they were met with uninvested or absent foster parents. For example, some said they rarely \u201cget a call back\u201d from foster parents, though they believe that the child would improve if the foster parents were more involved with the education system. Lisa put it simply, \u201cIf the communication isn\u2019t there between the foster parents and the school, if that communication breaks down in any way, the kid can end up lost.\u201d In addition, Maria, a teacher, expressed that it seemed like attending IEP meetings was not \u201cpart of the job description\u201d for foster parents, insomuch as she had never seen a foster parent at a meeting. Other teachers pondered whether people become foster parents for the \u201cextra income,\u201d hypothesizing that they do not feel responsible for educating the children in their care.\n\nSome teachers described an almost adversarial relationship with foster parents, which made collaboration with them next-to-impossible. For instance, Nina, a high school teacher, described a foster mother who did not seem to want to work with students who were struggling, and instead requested that DCF remove them from her home if there were problems at school. Nina explained:\n\nEvery time I talked to the foster parent, she was like, \u2018She [foster daughter] needs to leave; she needs to go.\u2019 She didn\u2019t really talk to her. I felt like I was setting the kid up to get the kid kicked out of there\u2026It was like, \u2018I\u2019ll give you a house, but if you need more than that, then you need to go.\u2019 She did really well with the high school kids that just needed a house and could take care of themselves. It makes it hard because you don\u2019t want to cause a kid being thrown out. She had been in like 16 homes over the few years.\n\nNina hesitated to call the foster parent to address school issues because she did not want to jeopardize the student\u2019s stability at home. Thus, the school\u2013foster home disconnect, according to some teachers in this study, is exacerbated when foster parents do not return school calls, miss important school meetings, and put all of the responsibility of educating foster youth on the teachers, which contributes to the academic barriers faced by students in foster care."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-Mayhew", "page_content": "Henry Mayhew, (born 1812, London, England\u2014died July 25, 1887, London), English journalist and sociologist, a founder of the magazine Punch (1841), who was a vivid and voluminous writer best known for London Labour and the London Poor, 4 vol. (1851\u201362). His evocation of the sights and sounds of London in this work influenced Charles Dickens and other writers.\n\nMayhew, the son of a solicitor, ran away to sea at age 12 and made a voyage to India. Upon his return he studied law with his father but soon turned to journalism. He helped to found the periodicals Figaro in London (1831) and The Thief (1832) before organizing the highly successful Punch, of which he was coeditor (with Mark Lemon) for two years. He also wrote plays, farces, fairy tales, and novels, some in collaboration with his brother Augustus Septimus Mayhew (1826\u201375). Short of money in his later years, he produced much hackwork and died in obscurity.\n\nMayhew had a genius for lively and sensitive reportage of people, including social outcasts and nomads, and of contrasting ways of life; and he was able to combine his observation with penetrating economic and social analysis, some of it with a Marxist flavour. London Labour and the London Poor was based on letters he wrote to the London Morning Chronicle in 1849\u201350, at the end of a stormy decade in British social history. Responding to the newspaper\u2019s desire for \u201ctrustworthy information\u201d on the great social problems of the day, Mayhew prepared three volumes that were published in 1851; the fourth volume, The Criminal Prisons of London, was written in collaboration with John Binny and did not appear until 1862.

First of all, I'd like to extend, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, my festival greetings to the teachers, staff and students at Peking University and young people of all ethnic groups across the country. Also, I want to express my deepest respects to those who work in the fields of education and youth work throughout the country!\n\nThis is my fifth visit to Peking University since I started to serve on the Party Central Committee, and each time I am here I find something new that impresses me. My feelings soar whenever I walk on this campus full of vigor and vitality, and I can't help but sigh: The current generation of college students is just adorable, trustworthy and reliable, and you are bound to have a bright future.\n\nThe May 4th Movement gave founding to the May 4th spirit of patriotism, progress, democracy and science, kicking off the New Democratic Revolution in China, promoting the dissemination of Marxism in the country and laying the groundwork for the founding of the CPC.\n\nSince the May 4th Movement, under the leadership of the Party, generations of highly motivated young men and women have written inspiring chapters in the struggles to save the country and rejuvenate the Chinese nation, with the motto \"Devoting my youth to creating a family of youth, a country of youth, a nation of youth, a mankind of youth, a planet of youth and a universe of youth.\"3\n\nPeking University was the base of the New Culture Movement4 as well as a cradle of the May 4th Movement, witnessing this glorious period in modern history. For a long time, teachers and students here have shared a common destiny with the country and the people, and advanced with the times and society, making remarkable contributions to our country's revolution, construction and reform in all respects.\n\nThe Two Centenary Goals were put forward at the 18th CPC National Congress. As I have said before, we have never been so close as now to reaching the goal of the great renewal of the Chinese nation, and we are more confident and more capable than ever of fulfiling this goal.\n\nNevertheless, \"A thing is yet to be done until it is done,\"5 as an old saying goes. The closer we approach the goal the more we should redouble our efforts. We can afford no slackening. More importantly, we should encourage more young people to join the great cause of making the dream come true.\n\nThe river of time flows nonstop day and night, and things change as the seasons change. Every generation of young people is offered the opportunities of the era for drawing a picture of life and creating history. Young people, the most sensitive weatherglass of an era, are entrusted with the responsibilities of the times and share the glory of their days.\n\nToday, we are here to honor the May 4th Movement. The best way for us to have the May 4th spirit display widely is to join the team of builders, pioneers and dedicators, and together with the people of all ethnic groups shoulder our historic responsibilities with firm beliefs, high morality, a wealth of knowledge and competent skills.\n\nStudents and teachers,\n\nUniversity is a place not just for academic studies but for seeking truth. Today, I'd like to take this opportunity to share with you my insights into the core socialist values.\n\nI was inspired by the spirit of the May 4th Movement, which embodies the values the Chinese people and nation have pursued in modern history. Today, we should still adhere to and carry out these core values, highlighted by patriotism, progress, democracy and science. Young people, as well as everyone else in the country, should uphold and carry out these core values.\n\nLooking at human history and social development, we find that the most lasting and profound power for a nation and country is the core values acknowledged by all. Core values carry the spiritual aspiration of a nation and country, and represent the standard for judging right and wrong.\n\nAn ancient proverb goes, \"The way to great learning is to manifest bright virtue and to treat the people as one's own family, thereby arriving at supreme goodness.\"6 Core values are in fact individual virtues, as well as public, social and national virtues. A country cannot prosper without virtues, nor can anyone succeed without virtues. Without shared core values, a nation and country will be at a loss to know what is right and what is wrong, and its people will have no code of conduct to follow, the result being that the nation and country can never progress. It has commonly occurred in our history, and still happens across the globe.\n\nChina is a big country with 1.3 billion people and 56 ethnic groups. Upon the recognition of the values with the \"greatest common denominator\" by the people of all ethnic groups, they work with one heart and one mind to strive in unity. This concerns our nation's future and destiny, as well as our people's happiness and well-being.\n\nEvery era has its spirit, and likewise its values. In ancient China our ancestors developed core values highlighted by \"propriety, righteousness, honesty and a sense of shame \u2013 the four anchors of our moral foundation, and a question of life and death for the country.\"7 This was our ancestors' understanding of their core values.\n\nWhat are the core values for our people and country today? This is both a theoretical and a practical question. We should eventually agree upon this after sorting out opinions and understandings from all walks of life. The core socialist values that we should cultivate and practice are prosperity, democracy, civility, harmony, freedom, equality, justice, the rule of law, patriotism, dedication, integrity and friendship.\n\nThe values of prosperity, democracy, civility and harmony are for the country; those of freedom, equality, justice and the rule of law for the society; and those of patriotism, dedication, integrity and friendship for citizens. They explain what sort of country and society we are striving for, and what kind of citizens we are cultivating.\n\nSince ancient times the Chinese people have developed their country through studying the nature of things to acquire knowledge, correcting thoughts with sincerity, cultivating the moral self, managing the family, governing the state and safeguarding peace under Heaven. As we see it today, the principles of \"studying the nature of things, correcting thoughts with sincerity and cultivating the moral self\" are for individuals; the principle of \"managing the family\" is for the society; and those of \"governing the state and safeguarding peace under Heaven\" are for the country.\n\nWhat we put forward for the core socialist values is a combination of requirements for the country, society and citizens, which represent the nature of socialism, carry forward the fine traditional Chinese culture, draw on the best of world civilization and reflect the spirit of the times.\n\nProsperity, democracy, civility, harmony, freedom, equality, justice, the rule of law, patriotism, dedication, integrity and friendship are all ideas that inherit the essence of the outstanding traditional Chinese culture, embody the ideals and faith formed by modern Chinese people through unremitting and painstaking efforts, and reflect the wishes and vision of every Chinese citizen.\n\nWe should foster the core socialist values throughout society. The people should join hands and work persistently to make China richer and stronger, more democratic, more harmonious and more beautiful, so that our country can be confident enough to stand proudly among all other nations.\n\nSince the Opium War of the 1840s the Chinese people have long cherished a dream of realizing a great national rejuvenation and building China into a strong, democratic and harmonious modern socialist country \u2013 the highest and most fundamental interests of the nation. And that's what our 1.3 billion people are striving for.\n\nChina used to be a world economic power. However, it missed its chance in the wake of the Industrial Revolution and the consequent dramatic changes, and thus was left behind and suffered humiliation under foreign invasion. Things got worse especially after the Opium War, when the nation was plagued by poverty and weakness, allowing others to trample upon and manipulate us. We must not let this tragic history repeat itself.\n\nThe construction of a strong, democratic and harmonious modern socialist country is our goal and responsibility \u2013 for the nation, for our forefathers and for our future generations. Therefore, we should maintain our willpower, intensify our faith, and walk unswervingly along the road towards our destination.\n\nChina has stood up. It will never again tolerate being bullied by any nation. Yet it will never follow in the footsteps of the big powers, which seek hegemony once they grow strong. Our country is following a path of peaceful development.\n\nWhy are we so confident? Because we have developed and become stronger. China has won worldwide respect with its century-long efforts. Its prestige keeps rising, and its influence keeps expanding. Today's China forms a sharp contrast to China in the 19th century when the country was humiliated, its sovereignty was infringed upon, and its people were bullied by foreigners.\n\nChinese civilization has formed a unique value system over several millennia. The brilliant traditional Chinese culture is the essence of the nation and has deep roots in the Chinese people's mentality, influencing their way of thinking and behavior unconsciously.\n\nToday, we advocate and carry forward the core socialist values through absorbing the rich nourishment of Chinese culture, so as to invigorate its vitality and broaden its influence.\n\nHere are some quotations from ancient classics that I'd like to share with you today:\n\n\"The people are the foundation of a state,\"8\n\n\"The harmony of Nature and man,\"9\n\n\"Harmony without uniformity,\"10\n\n\"As Heaven changes through movement, a gentleman makes unremitting efforts to perfect himself,\"11\n\n\"When the Great Way prevailed, a public spirit ruled all under Heaven,\"12\n\n\"Everyone is responsible for his country's rise or fall,\"13\n\n\"Govern the country with virtue and educate the people with culture,\"\n\n\"A gentleman has a good knowledge of righteousness,\"14\n\n\"A gentleman is broad-minded,\"15\n\n\"A gentleman takes morality as his bedrock,\"16\n\n\"Be true in word and resolute in deed,\"17\n\n\"If a man does not keep his word, what is he good for?\"18\n\n\"A man of high moral quality will never feel lonely,\"19\n\n\"The benevolent man loves others,\"20\n\n\"Do things for the good of others,\"21\n\n\"Don't do unto others what you don't want others to do unto you,\"22\n\n\"Care for each other and help one another,\"23\n\n\"Respect others' elders as one respects one's own, and care for others' children as one cares for one's own,\"24\n\n\"Help the poor and assist those in difficulty,\"\n\n\"Care less about quantity and more about quality.\"25\n\nThese thoughts and ideas all displayed and still demonstrate distinctive national features, and have the indelible values of the times. We have updated them in keeping abreast of the times, while carrying them forward in an unbroken line.\n\nAs Chinese, we should always keep our own unique inner-world spirit, uphold values that we practice every day without noticing. The core socialist values we advocate today represent the inheritance and upgrading of outstanding traditional Chinese culture.\n\nValues appear and develop in the process of human beings getting to know and shape nature and society. Core values vary in different nations and countries due to different natural conditions and courses of development. The core values of a nation and country are closely related to its history and culture, as well as to what its people are striving for and to the present issues it needs to resolve.\n\nThere are no two leaves exactly alike on earth. A nation, or people of a country, must know who they are, where they came from and where they are heading. Keep on going when you have made your choice.\n\nOn December 26 last year, I said at the meeting commemorating the 120th birthday of Mao Zedong:\n\nBoasting a vast land of 9.6 million sq km, a rich cultural heritage and a strong bond among the 1.3 billion Chinese people, we are resolved to go our own way. We have a big stage to display our advantages on, a long and rich history to draw benefit from, and a powerful impetus to push us ahead. We Chinese people \u2013 every single one of us \u2013 should draw confidence from this.\n\nWe should modestly learn from the best of other civilizations, but never forget our own origin. We must not blindly copy the development models of other countries nor accept their dictation.\n\nWhat I mean here is that we should enhance our confidence in the path we have chosen, in the theories we have devised and in the system we have established to reach our goal of development and make the Chinese Dream come true. \"In the face of all blows, not bending low, it still stands fast. Whether from east, west, south or north the wind doth blast.\"26 Our confidence is supported by our core values.\n\nWhy am I talking about the core socialist values with you young people? Because your value orientation will decide the values of the whole of society in the years to come. Besides, young people are at the time of life when they form and establish their values. It is therefore very important to offer some guidance. That reminds me of something that happens in our daily life. When we button up our coat, we may inadvertently put the first button in the wrong button hole, and that will result in all the other buttons being put in the wrong holes. That's why we say that young people should \"button right\" in the early days of their life. \"A deep well is dug starting with a shallow pit.\"27 Every young person should learn about the core socialist values starting right now, take them as his basic rules and disseminate them throughout society.\n\nWhen young people adopt the core socialist values they should emphasize the following points:\n\nFirst, work diligently to acquire true knowledge. Knowledge is an important cornerstone for the cultivation of the core values. The great philosophers of ancient Greece believed that knowledge was a virtue. Our ancestors also asserted, \"One cannot enhance one's ability and wisdom if one does not work hard; neither can one succeed without ambition.\"28\n\nA person enjoys only once the youthful days at college, so you should cherish them. To acquire knowledge, one has to study diligently, intensively and persistently. Lu Xun29 once said, \"Who said I'm a genius? I spent all my time working when others were sipping coffee.\"30 In college days, \"Young we were, schoolmates, at life's full flowering.\"31 One can totally throw oneself into seeking knowledge without any distractions, learning from teachers, exchanging views with classmates and rummaging through piles of books. So there is no reason not to study hard. Work hard, acquire more knowledge and turn what you have learned into your own views and ideas. I hope that you will not only concentrate on book knowledge but also care about the people, the country and the world, and assume your responsibility for society.\n\nSecond, cultivate morality and virtue, and pay attention to them in practice. \"Virtue is the root.\"32 Mr Cai Yuanpei33 believed, \"He who is strong physically and talented but has no virtue will end up on the side of vice.\"34 Virtues are fundamental for both individuals and society. What is most important is to cultivate morality. This explains why we select those who are both talented and morally cultivated for our work, with morality as priority. One can be placed in the right position only if one recognizes virtue, follows social ethics and restricts personal desires.\n\nWhen talking about cultivating morality, one needs to have high ambitions as well as pragmatic plans. To devote oneself to one's country and serve one's people, this is the great virtue with which one is able to accomplish the great cause. In the meantime, one needs to start to do small things well and be self-disciplined even in small matters. \"Learning from fine things that may appear and correcting any mistakes that may occur,\"35 one needs to cultivate public and personal virtues, learn to work, to be thrifty, to be grateful, to help others, to be modest, to be tolerant, to examine oneself and to exercise self-restraint.\n\nThird, learn to tell right from wrong and make correct decisions. As our ancestors believed, \"Reading without thinking makes one muddled; thinking without reading makes one flighty.\"36 Knowing what is right or wrong, what is the correct direction and what is the proper way to follow, one is bound to reap the reward of one's work.\n\nFacing a complex and fast-changing world, an information era with the surge of various schools of thought, a multifaceted society of genuine and false ideas, and the pressure associated with one's academic pursuit, relationships and employment, you may feel somewhat confused, hesitant or frustrated. This is a normal experience everybody will go through. The key is to learn to think about and analyze situations before making decisions in order to arrive at correct decisions. You should be sturdy, confident and self-reliant. You must form a correct world outlook, view of life and values, then you will see \u2013 crystal-clear \u2013 the true nature of society and have a better understanding of your life's experience, and be able to tell what is right and what is wrong, what is primary and what is secondary, what is true and what is false, what is good and what is evil, and what is beautiful and what is ugly before making judgments and decisions. As a Tang verse goes, \"Gold glitters only after countless washings and sievings.\"37\n\nFourth, be honest and sincere; do solid work and be an upright person. The correct way needs to be pursued in practice, while morality requires no empty talk. One should be more pragmatic. Knowledge and action should go hand in hand, and the core values should be turned into moral pursuits as well as a drive to make people engage in conscious action. The Book of Rites38 says, \"Learn extensively, inquire earnestly, think profoundly, discriminate clearly and practice sincerely.\"39\n\nSome people believe that \"sages are mediocre people who work hard, while mediocre people are sages who refuse to work hard.\" With more opportunities, young people should make their steps steady, lay a solid foundation and make unremitting efforts. It is no good for study or running a business if one works intermittently, or chops and changes. \"Difficult things are done starting from easy ones; a great undertaking begins with minor work.\"40\n\nNo matter what you opt to do, success always favors hard workers. Young people should take a difficult environment as a challenge or test. \"Little strokes fell great oaks.\" Success awaits those who work doggedly and unyieldingly, and those who are never daunted by repeated setbacks.\n\nThe cultivation of the core values can't be done overnight. It requires efforts from the easy to the difficult, from close-up to faraway until it becomes a faith and idea that we follow conscientiously. When things are smooth, you may be confident; when there are frustrations, you may have doubts and waver. In all circumstances we should always uphold the core socialist values which have been formed and developed here in our country, make contributions to the great cause in the modern era and fulfill our lifetime expectations.\n\nStudents and teachers,\n\nThe Party Central Committee has decided to build world-class colleges and universities \u2013 a strategic policy that we should follow without hesitation. To make them world-class, they must feature Chinese characteristics. It won't do to copy others mechanically, because we always believe that \"the more national the more international.\"\n\nIn this world there is only one Harvard University, University of Oxford, Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University of Cambridge; likewise, there is only one Peking University, Tsinghua University, Zhejiang University, Fudan University and Nanjing University in China. We should draw on the world's best experience in running institutions of higher learning, follow the rules of education, and establish more excellent colleges and universities on Chinese soil.\n\nLu Xun asserted, \"Peking University is always innovative and plays a pioneering role in reforming movements, leading China along an upward path towards a better future.\"41\n\nThe decision on advancing the reform in an all-round way was made at the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee, defining the demands for the further reform of higher education in China. What we must do now is to turn this blueprint into reality.\n\nInstitutions of higher learning should take the lead in educational reform throughout the country, centering on the fundamental tasks of building virtues and morality, and moving faster in establishing an educational system and mechanism that is full of vigor and vitality, efficient, more open and favoring educational development in a balanced and coordinated way. I do hope that Peking University can realize its long-cherished dream as soon as possible of advancing into the ranks of world-class universities through painstaking efforts, reform and innovation.\n\nTeachers are entrusted with the noblest mission in this world. Mr Mei Yiqi42 opined that the key to the success of a university lies in having a lot of highly accomplished gurus rather than imposing buildings.43 What he meant by \"highly-accomplished gurus,\" as I see it, are people most knowledgeable in their academic fields and who are also virtuous. Always bearing in mind their responsibilities, teachers should be ready to serve as human ladders, inspiring the souls of the students whom they are teaching with the help of their personal charisma and scholarly attainments.\n\nParty committees and governments at all levels should pay closer attention to colleges and universities, show more concern for the students and erect a platform for them to dream upon and make their dreams come true. We should accelerate the reform in an all-round way, create a fair and just social environment, promote social mobility and inspire the vigor and creativity of young people. We should improve the system of employment and business startups so as to assist graduates at the beginning of their life-long careers. Leading officials at all levels should keep in communication with the students, make friends with them and listen to what they have to say.\n\nToday, the majority of college students are around the age of 20; and they will be under the age of 30 by 2020, when we complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects. They will be around 60 by the mid-21st century, when we basically realize our country's modernization. That is to say, you will participate in the cause of reaching the Two Centenary Goals along with myriads of other young people.\n\nI believe that life is meaningless for anyone without faith, without dreams, without concerted endeavors and without contributions. I hope that you can create your own wonderful life while making the Chinese Dream come true since you have never been given a platform as spacious as this or as promising as this.\n\nI believe that young Chinese people today are more than capable of undertaking the historic mission entrusted to them by the Party and the people, and will go on to write a brilliant chapter worthy of our times in their efforts to take advantage of their youthful vigor, explore life and contribute to society!\n\n\n\n\n\n* Speech at the seminar with teachers and students of Peking University.\n\nNotes\n\n1 The year 1939 saw the nomination of China's Youth Day on May 4th by the Northwestern Youth Association of National Salvation in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region to carry forward and foster the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Chinese young people since the May 4th Movement in 1919. In December 1949 the Government Administration Council \u2013 the predecessor of China's State Council \u2013 of the Central People's Government officially named it China's Youth Day.\n\n2 The May 4th Movement, which started in Beijing on May 4, 1919, was a patriotic movement of the Chinese people against imperialism and feudalism. Soon after the end of World War I, victorious nations, including Britain, the United States, France, Japan, and Italy held the Paris Peace Conference, awarding Germany's rights in Shandong Province to Japan. China was one of the victorious nations, but the Chinese Beiyang (Warlord) Government was about to sign the treaty. On the afternoon of May 4, 1919, over 3,000 students of Peking University and other schools protested against the treaty and the compromise of the Beiyang Government, provoking a quick response throughout the country. By June 3 the movement turned out to be a patriotic movement against imperialism and feudalism, with participants from the working class, urban petite-bourgeoisie and national bourgeoisie. It also sparked off the New Culture Movement against feudal Chinese culture. Bolstered by the founding of the journal Youth (later known as New Youth) in 1915, the New Culture Movement called for Mr Science and Mr Democracy by replacing old moral standards and old literature with the new. The May 4th Movement marked the end of the Old Democratic Revolution and the start of the New Democratic Revolution in China, thereby opening a brand-new chapter of revolution in Chinese history.\n\n3 Li Dazhao: Youth.

Jonathan Mayhew was born on the small island of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, off the Massachusetts coast, on 8 October 1720. His father, Experience Mayhew, was the missionary to the Indians there, a post the Mayhew family had filled since 1641. The Vineyard mission was one of the few successful English ventures to Christianize Native Americans, and during Jonathan\u2019s youth the Chilmark congregation, as it was called, was a peaceful church, although its numbers were declining as the Indian population decreased. Experience nurtured his converts faithfully, defending them against spurious land claims and the rigors of orthodox Calvinism, which he came to see as too harsh a system of religion for Indians and whites alike. He struggled to obtain adequate funds to support his work. Jonathan\u2019s elder brother Nathan was marked to attend college and follow in his father\u2019s footsteps as a missionary, but his early death left Jonathan to assume this family duty.\n\nReason. Mayhew kept his father\u2019s liberal religious ideas with him as he attended Harvard College, graduating in 1744. There he embraced the rationalist Congregationalism that was a hallmark of the training Harvard offered at that time. Particularly important was the teaching of Professor Edward Wigglesworth, a leading spokesman for rational religion and against the emotionalism of the revivals of the 1730s and 1740s. In 1742 Mayhew briefly turned to revivalism after hearing the great evangelical preacher George Whitefield, but he soon rejected that kind of religion as \u201clow, confused, puerile, conceited, ill-natur\u2019d, [and] enthusiastik,\u201d as he wrote to his father. In 1747 Mayhew became the minister of Boston\u2019s West Congregational Church, where he worked for the rest of his life. From this pulpit Mayhew preached a rational religion that evolved into something quite different from its Puritan roots. Mayhew became an outspoken advocate of free rational inquiry into religious truth and argued that humans had the natural ability to come closer to God through that inquiry. He was a true Enlightenment figure, thinking of the practice of Christianity as a kind of science and even reading the radical French philosophers Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Mayhew ended by rejecting the orthodox beliefs in the three persons of God and in the predestination of a select few for salvation in favor of a faith in a universally benevolent God who loved all humans.\n\nControversies. Mayhew frequently came into conflict with others over religion, politics, and even social matters. An early sign was his lateness in marrying, unusual for a young minister with a good position. Instead of settling down, Mayhew enjoyed an active social life of dining out, hunting, and fishing, although he did not attend theatrical performances, which he considered immoral. His congregation\u2019s criticism of this lifestyle ended when he married nine years after assuming his pulpit, but more serious opposition came from theological and political figures. Mayhew\u2019s rational religion took him into public debates with John Cleaveland, a leading revivalist, and Samuel Hopkins, one of Jonathan Edwards\u2019s students and a major figure in the New Divinity movement. Mayhew\u2019s temper often got the better of him in these controversies, which fostered more bad feeling than mutual understanding. As early as 1754 Mayhew began another long conflict. This time his opponent was the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, the leading sponsor of Indian missions in colonial America. He criticized the society for using its resources in parts of New England that needed no missionaries and so failing to bring Native Americans to Christ, reflecting on the difficulties of his own family\u2019s experiences with that task.\n\nPolitics. Criticism of Anglican missions brought Mayhew to a deeper skepticism about relations between England and America, coincided with the first political tensions between the two. Mayhew spoke out against rumors that the Anglican Church was preparing to send a bishop to America to better support its efforts there. Mayhew saw this effort as a significant threat to American religious liberty as it had existed in New England since the days of the Puritan founders. He recalled for his listeners and readers the sacrifices of English Puritans during their own revolution of the 1640s, as they opposed the tyranny of King Charles I and his bishops and struggled to worship God in accordance with their consciences. He argued that the English Puritans were right to oppose their king because he was unjust. This was a much more positive view of the English revolution than Americans had heard up to this period. Over time Mayhew expanded his thoughts to criticize the current English monarchy and its representatives in New England. Mayhew was never fully allied with American political leaders such as Samuel Adams and John Hancock, and he opposed the mobs who demonstrated against the Stamp Act. Yet Mayhew\u2019s thoughts about religious freedom supported their emerging notions of political liberty. He preached his most famous sermon, \u201cThe Snare Broken,\u201d in celebration of the repeal of the Stamp Act. In it he criticized mob violence but also spoke against England\u2019s exploitation of America, setting the tone for the revolutionary era. He failed to see that emerge, however, having a stroke soon after this success and dying on 9 July 1766.\n\nCharles W.

Her Royal Highness will also take on Patronage of two additional charities as part of her official working portfolio \u2013 Smart Works and Mayhew.\n\nThe Duchess is delighted to become Patron of both national and grassroots organisations that are part of the fabric of the UK, and is very much looking forward to working with them to bring wider public attention to their causes. Her Royal Highness feels she can use her position to focus attention on, and make a particular difference to these organisations and, more widely, the sectors they each represent.\n\nFor the arts, the National Theatre\u2019s mission is to make world class theatre that is entertaining, challenging and inspiring for everyone and to be as inclusive, diverse and national as possible. In support of access to education, the Association of Commonwealth Universities is the world's first and oldest international university network and the only accredited organisation representing higher education across all 53 Commonwealth countries.\n\nWith regards to supporting women, Smart Works helps long-term unemployed and vulnerable women regain the skills, confidence and tools to succeed at job interviews, return to employment and transform their lives. In terms of animal welfare, Mayhew is a grassroots charity working in a unique way to improve the lives of animals and people to better communities both in London and internationally.\n\nOver the last year, Her Royal Highness has held meetings and conducted private visits with each of these organisations. The Duchess will today visit Smart Works and over the next few weeks will undertake public visits to the other three organisations.\n\nFurther information on these organisations and why The Duchess has chosen to support them as Patron follows:\n\nThe National Theatre\n\nThe Duchess is a strong believer in using the arts to bring people from different backgrounds and communities together. The National Theatre\u2019s mission is to make world class theatre that\u2019s entertaining, challenging and inspiring \u2013 and to make it for everyone. It aims to reach the widest possible audience and to be as inclusive, diverse and national as possible with a broad range of productions that play in London, on tour around the UK, on Broadway and across the globe.\n\nThe National Theatre's extensive UK-wide learning and participation programme supports young people\u2019s creative education through performance and writing programmes like Connections, New Views and Let\u2019s Play. Its major new initiative Public Acts creates extraordinary acts of theatre and community; the first Public Acts production was 2018\u2019s Pericles. The National Theatre extends its reach through digital programmes including NT Live, which broadcasts some of the best of British theatre to over 2,500 venues in 65 countries, and the free streaming service On Demand In Schools, used by nearly 60% of UK state secondary schools.\n\nThe National Theatre invests in the future of theatre by developing talent, creating bold new work and building audiences, partnering with a range of UK theatres and theatre companies.

As well as a double major in theatre and international relations from Northwestern University, which is renowned for its drama programme, Her Royal Highness volunteered at a performing arts after school programme for children in underprivileged school districts in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU)\n\nAs a university graduate, Her Royal Highness is a strong advocate of accessible education for all, something she spoke of most recently during her visit to Fiji last year. Established in 1913, the ACU is the world's first and oldest international university network, with more than 500 member institutions in over 50 countries. It is the only accredited organisation representing higher education across the Commonwealth. The ACU champions higher education as a force for good in the Commonwealth and beyond.\n\nAmong its key principles is the value of higher education to society \u2013 or its role \u2018as a common good\u2019 \u2013 and the conviction that this value is enhanced by international collaboration. The ACU manages international scholarship schemes \u2013 including the UK government\u2019s three major scholarship programmes and The Queen Elizabeth Commonwealth Scholarships \u2013 that offer life-changing educational opportunities, convenes universities to address key policy challenges such as climate resilience and peace and reconciliation, and promotes the role of universities in delivering the UN Sustainable Development Goals. For more information please visit https://www.acu.ac.uk/.\n\nDuring her recent visit to Fiji, The Duchess announced new Gender Grants for ACU member universities in the Pacific to fund new learning initiatives aimed at empowering female university staff and promoting gender equality. Her Royal Highness last month met with university leaders, academics and international scholarship students as they discussed the role of higher education in addressing issues such as human trafficking, modern slavery, gender equality, peace and reconciliation, and climate change.\n\nSmart Works\n\nThe Duchess has visited Smart Works several times over the last year where she has worked with many women who have benefited from the charity\u2019s support, helping them through coaching and interview preparation. Her Royal Highness has also volunteered with several other projects in this sector in the past. Created in September 2013 Smart Works exists to help long term unemployed and vulnerable women regain the confidence they need to succeed at job interviews, return to employment and transform their lives.\n\nHalf of Smart Works\u2019 clients are from an ethnic minority, long-term unemployed and have been unsuccessful with a large number of job applications. Thanks to the charity\u2019s support, 60% go on to get a job following their visit to Smart Works. As well as providing complete outfits of high quality clothes for job interviews, beneficiaries also have access to one-to-one interview training and the opportunity to join Smart Works Network, meeting every month to further their professional and personal development. Smart Works aims to dress 3500 women this year across their two London offices, and additional bases in key cities across the UK - Edinburgh, Manchester, Reading, Birmingham and Newcastle. For more information please visit http://smartworks.org.uk/.\n\nHer Royal Highness has also been involved with several other projects in this sector, including a project whilst at university which provided prom dresses for young women in underprivileged areas. The Duchess has a longstanding track record of working in the space of women\u2019s empowerment both in her local community as well as abroad. In recent years, Her Royal Highness has travelled to India and Rwanda working on projects to mobilise women in challenging or marginalized situations to see their full potential.\n\nMayhew\n\nThe Duchess has long understood the connection between animals and community welfare and has supported various animal rescue centres in Los Angeles. Established in 1886 and entirely funded by public donations Mayhew is an animal welfare charity working to improve the lives of dogs, cats and people in communities both in London and internationally. Mayhew looks for innovative ways to reduce the number of animals in need through pro-active community and educational initiatives and preventative veterinary care.\n\nThis includes working with homelessness charities across London to ensure people and their dogs can be kept together; running a Pet Refuge programme to provide shelter and care for the pets of people in crisis for short periods of time; and educating young people about animal welfare and the importance of responsible pet ownership. Internationally, Mayhew works with governments, local communities and charitable groups in Afghanistan, Georgia, Russia and India to help improve animal welfare.

We were honoured when The Queen became our Patron in 1974 and have celebrated many moments together including, in recent years, the Diamond Jubilee and the marking of our 50th anniversary. It is a privilege to welcome The Duchess of Sussex as our new Patron. The Duchess shares our deeply-held conviction that theatre has the power to bring together people from all communities and walks of life. I very much look forward to working closely with Her Royal Highness in the years to come\u201d.\n\nDr Joanna Newman MBE, Chief Executive and Secretary General of the ACU, said: \u201cWe are absolutely delighted that HRH The Duchess of Sussex has chosen to become Patron of the ACU. The Duchess shares our passion for the transformational power of higher education, and Her Royal Highness\u2019 support will help champion higher education as a force for good in the Commonwealth and beyond. We would like to thank Her Majesty The Queen for her support, and we look forward to working closely with The Duchess as our Patron.\u201d\n\nJuliet Hughes-Hallett, Chair and Founder of Smart Works said: \u201cWe are thrilled to announce that The Duchess of Sussex will become the Royal Patron of Smart Works. An acknowledged champion of women and their rights worldwide, The Duchess will motivate ever more women to come to our centres and get the job that will transform their lives. The Duchess\u2019s patronage will inspire the women we serve and help them reach for the stars.\u201d\n\nCaroline Yates, CEO of Mayhew said: \u201cWe are so excited that HRH The Duchess of Sussex has chosen to be our Patron. Mayhew works to improve the lives of dogs, cats and the people in our community, tackling the root cause of animal abandonment and neglect and supporting vulnerable people to stay with their companion pets. The Duchess has spent many years championing animal welfare, and we are honoured to have our charity represented by such a passionate Patron. We look forward to working closely with The Duchess and hope that, together, we can help even more animals and people.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2011-01/31/content_11970208.htm", "page_content": "Pilot recalls captured Nazi leader Updated: 2011-01-31 07:54 By Matt Volz (China Daily)\n\nIn this May 9, 1945 photo provided by Brigadier General Mayhew Foster, captured Nazi leader Hermann Goering (second from right) stands on the tiny airstrip outside Kitzbuhel, Austria, before being transported back to Germany for interrogation. Provided by Mayhew Foster / Associated Press\n\nMISSOULA, Montana - Captain Mayhew Foster had an extraordinary mission: Fly captured Nazi leader Hermann Goering to the 7th Army's headquarters for interrogation.\n\nThen he took one look at the one-time heir to Adolf Hitler and commander of the fearsome Luftwaffe - all 136 kg of him - and knew he needed a bigger plane.\n\nIt was May 9, 1945, the day after World War II ended in Europe. Goering, Foster and a group of officers from the Army's 36th Infantry Division gathered on a tiny airstrip outside Kitzbuhel, Austria, to transport the highly-prized war prisoner back to Germany in an unarmed, two-man reconnaissance plane.\n\n\"They wanted to get him back where he could be debriefed. There was a strong rumor that in a mountainside in the Alps right down there in Bavaria there was a concentration of (German) military,\" Foster said. \"He just acted as though it was a nice, friendly trip.\"\n\nMayhew Foster, now 99 and living in a Missoula nursing home, recently recounted his rare one-on-one encounter with one of the most wanted Nazi leaders. Foster went on to become brigadier general of the Montana National Guard and was awarded the French Legion of Honor for his World War II service, but it was this mission that stood out as the highlight of an illustrious military career.\n\nGoering, 52, had surrendered to the US Army's 36th Infantry Division the day before. He had fallen out of favor with Hitler and hadn't played an active role at the end of the war, though he remained Reichsmarschall of Nazi Germany.\n\nBefore his capture, Goering wrote a letter to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, offering to work with Eisenhower on the conditions of the German army's surrender, according to an account of Goering's capture by Brigadier General Robert Stack kept by the 36th Infantry Division Association.\n\nAfter receiving the letter, Stack and a group of soldiers drove from the division's base near Kitzbuhel across the border into Germany and intercepted a convoy that included Goering, his wife, daughter, sister-in-law, household servants and military aides, according to the account.\n\nGoering agreed to surrender unconditionally but asked that his family be cared for, and the Nazi leader was delivered to Foster for transport the next day.\n\nFoster, who was 33 at the time, said he didn't fear getting shot down carrying such precious cargo alone in an unescorted, unarmed plane. He didn't worry about Goering taking advantage of the lack of a guard to wrest control of the aircraft.\n\nThe main problem, he said, was getting the two of them off the ground - the nimble, lightweight Piper L4 that Foster piloted in his artillery spotting missions wouldn't support both him and Goering. But the division only had the small airstrip that was fine for Foster's aircraft, but was problematic for taking off and landing larger planes.\n\nThey'd have to upgrade to the one L5 in the division's inventory, a slightly larger aircraft Foster hadn't flown in years.\n\nGoering stood on the tiny airstrip in a plain, gray uniform that was unadorned but for a pistol at his hip and a medal around his neck. Still wearing the pistol, he stepped toward the plane. A Goering aide emerged from the group that had gathered and relieved Goering of the weapon.\n\nThe Nazi leader settled into the back seat and tried to fasten his seat belt. It wouldn't stretch across his belly. He held the strap in his hand, looked at Foster and said, \"Das goot!\" - that's good.\n\nA photograph of that moment shows Foster in the cockpit and Goering seated directly behind him, his elbow jauntily propped on the plane's fuselage.\n\nThe two men spent the 55-minute flight from Kitzbuhel to Augsburg, Germany, conversing in a mix of German and English. Foster said Goering avoided any talk of Hitler or the war but appeared to relish pointing out the sites below them.\n\n\"He acted as though he was going on a sightseeing tour, or really as though I was going on a sightseeing tour and he was showing me where he grew up,\" Foster said. \"I had a .45 in a shoulder holster, but he couldn't reach that. But neither could I, because I had two hands controlling the plane.\"\n\nHe described Goering as sharp, friendly and witty, even cracking a joke when Foster asked him when Germany began manufacturing jets.\n\n\"Too late,\" Goering replied, according to Foster.\n\nAt the time, Foster was somewhat less generous in describing the man. In a letter to his wife, Virginia Lou Foster, written soon after the mission, Foster told her that the Nazi leader was \"effeminate\" and \"gave me the creeps\".\n\n\"Several times I had the impulse to turn the plane over and see if I could shake him out but he was wedged in like a champagne cork,\" Foster wrote.\n\nAfter landing, Foster asked his passenger to sign a blank flight report. The prisoner scrawled \"Hermann Goering Reichsmarschall\" across the paper, which Foster folded and put in his pocket.\n\nIt's a document that he still has, one of Foster's most prized possessions alongside a collection of photographs of Goering, Hitler and other snapshots from the days of the Third Reich.\n\nThere was just a single jeep at the airstrip to meet the arriving flight carrying the world's most famous war prisoner. Foster rode with Goering to the gates of the 7th Army Headquarters and formally turned him over to the intelligence officer without ceremony.\n\nIt turned out, Foster learned later, those rumors of German troops hiding in the Bavarian Alps were untrue. Goering stood trial at Nuremberg, and the next year he was found guilty of war crimes.\n\nGoering was sentenced to hang, but he committed suicide instead by swallowing a cyanide capsule.\n\nSixty-five years later, Foster is trim, sharp and carries himself as a former military officer.\n\nHe still reflects on his rare insight into the Nazi leadership, and he recognizes that the experience had shifted his perceptions of the enemy. It allowed him to see the human side of those he had only known as caricatures.\n\n\"I could see that he was like one of our officers if he'd been picked up,\" Foster said. \"I wouldn't say it changed my view of the war but it showed me that there are ...\" He broke off.\n\n\"Well, I questioned all that we knew about these vicious people,\" he said.\n\nAssociated Press"}]}
