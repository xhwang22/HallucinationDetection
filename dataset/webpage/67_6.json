{"Anthony Dimond was appointed Governor of Alaska Territory by President William Howard Taft in 1909.": [{"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/943085", "page_content": "Anthony Joseph Dimond ( November 30 , 1881 \u2013 May 28 , 1953 ) was an American Democratic Party politician who was the Alaska Territory Delegate in the United States House of Representatives for many years (1933-1945). Dimond was also an early champion of Alaska statehood.\n\nDimond was born in New York and attended Catholic schools, taught school in Montgomery County, New York (1900-1903) and was a prospector/miner in Alaska (1904-1912) before studying law and beginning practice in Valdez (1913).\n\nDimond's political experience includes: US Commissioner in Chisana, Alaska (1913-1914); Special Assistant US Attorney for the 3rd Judicial Division of Alaska in Valdez (1917); Mayor of Valdez (1920-1922, 1925-1932); Alaska Territorial Senate (1923\u20131926, 1929\u20131932); and District Judge for the 3rd Division of Alaska (1945\u20131953). He also served as a Delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1936 and 1940. He died on May 28 , 1953 in Anchorage.\n\nA Roman Catholic , Dimond was a member of organizations such as the Elks, Moose and Eagles. His secretary, Bob Bartlett , eventually became a United States Senator from Alaska.\n\nToday, November 30 is celebrated by the State of Alaska as \"Anthony Dimond Day.\" In Anchorage, A. J. Dimond High School and Dimond Blvd, a major thoroughfare, are named after him.\n\nIn 1940, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt was considering making Alaska an international Jewish homeland, Dimond was the main force behind defeating the effort. Some Alaskan papers have attributed this to anti-Semitism on the part of Dimond and others, although the charge was challenged by historians who claimed that Dimond was mostly concerned about the finances.\n\nSee also\n\n* Dimond Center\n\n*\" The Yiddish Policemen's Union \"\n\nExternal links\n\n* CongBio|D000353\n\n* [ http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=7366335&pt=Anthony%20Dimond Gravesite of Anthony Dimond ]\n\n* [ http://www.adn.com/news/alaska/story/8828757p-8729537c.html In the context of the times, Jews from Germany weren't welcome ] , Tom Kizzia, \"Anchorage Daily News\", 2007-04-26."}, {"url": "https://urbanrenaissance.probeinternational.org/2003/06/03/brief-history-alaska-statehood-1867-1959/", "page_content": "Eric Gislason\n\nJune 3, 2003\n\nAmerican Studies at the University of Virginia\n\nThis brief history of Alaska statehood considers the region in the political and imaginative contexts of (contiguous) United States history and emphasizes certain themes revealed in this effort.\n\nIntroduction: The one hundred years between \u201cSeward\u2019s Folly\u201d (1867) and statehood (1959) comprise an intriguing though often ignored narrative about the importance of the \u201cgreat land\u201d to United States history. The following brief history of Alaska statehood considers the region in the political and imaginative contexts of (contiguous) United States history and emphasizes certain themes revealed in this effort. First, throughout the late-19th and early 20th century, Alaska serves as an advertisement for American colonialism. A colonial economy developed in which much of the territory\u2019s natural wealth (minerals, furs, salmon, timber) was extracted from the region and used elsewhere for the profit of absentee business interests. Second, Alaska served as an extension of the American frontier, a \u201cgreat northern and western citadel,\u201d in the words of one observer. This notion received a new resonance in the Cold War Years when Alaska represented the edge of American interests menaced by the Soviet Union.\n\nA third theme, which may be surprising to some readers, is Alaska\u2019s centrality in numerous national political disputes. The Ballinger-Pinchot affair of 1910 \u2014 covered in more detail below \u2014 fractured the Republican party and had far-reaching consequences for the political course of the U.S. Discriminatory national legislation such as the Jones and White Acts demonstrated the extent of U.S. imperial control over the region. And the machinations of the conservative coalition of Taft Republicans and \u201cDixiecrats\u201d during the Eisenhower years delayed Alaska statehood in the interest of maintaining a tenuous Republican majority in Congress.\n\nFinally, the issue of self-determination is at the heart of the issue of statehood: The early federal denial of self-rule and the practice of taxation without representation in Congress should be familiar echoes of the injustice suffered by colonists\u2019 of the prior century. The eventual response to these policies is a stirring chapter in the history of concerted democratic effort: the populist vigor of the Constitutional Convention and the adoption of the aggressive \u201cTennessee Plan\u201d for statehood combine with national efforts from individuals like Bob Bartlett and Ernest Gruening to achieve statehood for Alaska.\n\nBeginnings: \u201cSeward\u2019s Folly\u201d and the First Organic Act of 1884: On March 30, 1867, Secretary of State William H. Seward signed an agreement with Baron Edouard Stoeckl, the Russian Minister to the United States. The agreement, widely referred to as \u201cSeward\u2019s Folly\u201d (and \u201cSeward\u2019s Icebox\u201d) ceded possession of the vast territory of Alaska to the United States for the sum of $7.2 million. Few citizens of the U.S. could fathom what possible use or interest the 586,000 square miles of land would have for their country. In a speech given at Sitka on August 12, 1868, however, Secretary Seward claimed he did not doubt \u201cthat the political society to be constituted here, first as a Territory, and ultimately as a state or many States, will prove a worthy constituency of the Republic.\u201d1 President Andrew Johnson sent General Jefferson C. Davis to command a military force of about 500 men to maintain peace and order, and expected that Congress would establish the civil organization of the territory.\n\nThe 40th Congress (1867-1869) passed a law which made Alaska a customs district of the U. S. but made no other efforts to establish the civil infrastructure that President Johnson had hinted at. The relations between settlers and natives of Alaska were tense and the Navy forces of Commander L.A. Beardslee were called upon to maintain order. From 1879-1884, the Navy governed Alaska, as most of its inhabitants were located in the coastal southeastern \u201cpanhandle\u201d of the state. The passage of the First Organic Act (1884) made Alaska a civil and judicial district and provided the territory with judges, clerks, and marshals. Curiously enough, the general legal code of the state of Oregon was adopted. A total of thirteen officials were made responsible for a population of 32,000 people, of which only 430 were white settlers.\n\nMany settlers came to Alaska with the expectation that the territory would follow the path of the Western states to official state status. The First Organic Act did not provide for eventual representative government, however, and Alaska was consigned to a territorial status much like that of the Newfoundland fisheries of the 17th-century British Empire. The U.S. government asserted imperial administrative control over the noncontiguous territory, but due to the overriding late-19th century concerns of Reconstruction and rapid incorporation of the contiguous states demonstrated little interest in Alaska. Although some reports had been circulated about the wealth of furs, seals, fish, and minerals to be found in Alaska, the conventional wisdom about the territory was summed up in the New York Herald by James Gordon Bennett, who suggested that any impoverished European monarchs who wanted to sell worthless territory should apply to \u201cW.H. Seward, State Department, Washington, D.C.\u201d Alaska was just too remote to inspire much interest.\n\nThe Klondike Gold Rush and the Second Organic Act: The Klondike Gold Rush of 1897-98 was the first event to garner significant exposure for the great, white North. During the decade of 1890-1900, more than 30, 000 people surged into the Yukon Territory and Alaska when gold was discovered in places like Dawson, Fairbanks, and Ester. Mining, fishing, trapping, and mineral production flourished and a true \u201ccolonial economy\u201d developed, in which outside interests exploited the material resources of Alaska and took the profits elsewhere. In an article for the Atlantic Monthly called \u201cColonial Lessons of Alaska,\u201d journalist David S. Jordan declared that the disarray in Alaska could be attributed to four sources: \u201clack of centralization of power and authority, lack of scientific knowledge, lack of personal and public interest, and the use of offices as political patronage.\u201d3 Could the U.S. in good conscience hoist its flag over a colony if it was not prepared to care for it? Surveying the situation, President McKinley acknowledged the urgent need for further civil organization in Alaska and called for legislative relief which would address Alaska\u2019s bulky backlog of civil and criminal cases. In 1900 Congress passed an official code of civil and criminal procedure, appointed more judges, and put in place a system of taxation. Furthermore, the duty-free exchange of goods with Canada was established and construction was approved for a railroad between the port city of Seward and the city of Fairbanks, in the Interior, to aid in the distribution of goods.\n\nEfforts toward self-government were complicated by the influence in Washingon of the \u201cAlaska Syndicate,\u201d formed in 1906 by the fortunes of J.P. Morgan and Guggenheim. The Syndicate had purchased the large Kennicott-Bonanza copper mine and controlled much of Alaskan steamship and rail transportation, as well as a major part of the salmon canning industry. The Syndicate lobby in Washingon had successfully opposed any further extension of Alaskan home rule. James Wickersham, who had been appointed to an Alaskan judgeship in 1900 by President McKinley, became alarmed by the potential influence of incorporated interests in the territory and took up the struggle for Alaskan self-government. Wickersham argued that Alaska\u2019s resources should be used for the good of the entire country rather than exploited a select group of large, absentee-controlled interests \u2014 home rule, he claimed, would assure more just utilization of the territory\u2019s natural wealth. The 1910 Ballinger-Pinchot affair, which involved the illegal distribution of thirty-three federal government Alaskan coal land claims to the Guggenheim interests, culminated in a Congressional investigation and brought Alaska directly into the national headlines. Wickersham, surveying the fallout of the affair, determined that it destroyed the friendship between Theodore Roosevelt and President Taft; split the Republican party into two great factions; defeated President Taft for re-election in 1912; elected Woodrow Wilson President of the United States; and changed the course of history of our country.\n\nA chastened President Taft, in a special message to Congress on February 2, 1912, urged the enactment of legislation which would help Alaska develop its resources along the lines that Wickersham had urged.\n\nThe Second Organic Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in April 1912, conferred official territory status upon Alaska and provided for an elected legislature of eight senators and sixteen house members. Congress refused to give significant power to this legislature, however, or make the position of governor of the Territory a popularly elected one. Everything the local legislature did was subject to the (dis)approval of Congress. The federal government retained the power to regulate the territory\u2019s fish, game, and fur resources, a function no organized territory had thus far been denied. These restrictions would chafe Alaskans and eventually lead to efforts to amend and change the Second Organic Act. Nonetheless, this official act of incorporation by Congress did bind the region more firmly to the United States.\n\nThe Northwest Ordinance of 1787 had provided the framework for the territorial system and had, for over a century, served well the purposes of expansion. The last two contiguous U.S. territories, New Mexico and Arizona, had become states in 1912. But Alaska (like Hawaii and Puerto Rico) was non-contiguous and sparsely populated. These two factors, as well as Congress\u2019 uncertainty about Alaska\u2019s indigenous non-white population of Aleuts, Indians, and Eskimos complicated Alaska statehood. To be sure, political considerations had often been part of statehood questions: the 1864 elevation of Nevada from territory to state (though it only had a population of 20,000 at the time) gave Abraham Lincoln needed votes for re-election and also helped ratify the 13th Amendment.\n\nAbsentee Interests and Colonial Exploitation: Alaska had a population of about 58,000 in 1916 when Wickersham, now Delegate to Congress, introduced Alaska\u2019s first statehood bill. It failed due to lack of interest on the part of Alaskans; not even President Harding\u2019s 1923 visit to the Territory could create sustained widespread interest in statehood. Efforts to amend the Second Organic Act, which had not quite extricated Alaska\u2019s fishing industry from the influences of the \u201cFish Trust,\u201d took up much time yet proved fruitless. In fact, some Congressional legislation was overtly discriminatory to the Territory. The U.S. Maritime Act of 1920 \u2014 commonly referred to as the Jones Act, after its sponsor, Senator Wesley Jones of Seattle \u2014 stipulated that all commercial ships travelling between American ports had to be American-owned and American-built. Thus, all merchandise entering or leaving Alaska had to be transported by American carriers, which meant that all shipping had to go through Seattle. The Supreme Court ruled that, because Alaska was not officially a state, the Constitution\u2019s provision that one state should not hold sway over the commerce of another did not protect Alaska. Routing ships through the Canadian ports of Vancouver and Prince Rupert would have been much cheaper for Alaskans; nevertheless, under the Court\u2019s ruling, the Jones Act allowed Seattle business interests to charge much higher than average prices for shipping. This in turn raised the cost of living in Alaska and funnelled Alaskan dollars out of the territory and into the pockets of Washington businessmen. Another piece of discriminatory legislation, the White Act of 1924, was referred to as the \u201cMagna Carta of fishery conservation\u201d by both federal officials and industry spokesmen. In fact, the White Act favored the big companies\u2019 fish traps and worked against the development of small operators in Alaska.\n\nNational discrimination was compounded by regional conflicts among the territory\u2019s judicial divisions and these squabbles further blurred the focus on statehood. Under the conditions of the Second Organic Act, Alaska had been divided into the four divisions, each with a capitol city: the First Judicial division (southeastern Alaska) at Juneau; the Second Division (northwestern Alaska) at Nome; the Third Division (southcentral Alaska) at Valdez, and later at Anchorage; and the Fourth Division (the interior) at Fairbanks. The Southeastern division, or \u201cPanhandle\u201d region, had by far the largest population and began to wonder if perhaps it could become a state separate from the other three less-populated divisions. Government control over Alaska was the primary concern, as over 52 federal agencies had a hand in the daily workings of Alaska! Exasperated, Wickersham declared \u201cthere actually exists today a congressional government in Alaska more offensively bureaucratic in its basic principles and practices than that which existed here during the seventy years of Russian rule under the Czar.\u201d 8 Federal attempts in the 1920s to streamline administration had little success changing either the bureaucratic control over Alaska\u2019s development or the unfair Congressional legislation, and the exploitative resource industries of the contiguous states still had the power to completely withdraw the sources of many Alaskans\u2019 livelihood.\n\nThe Depression hit Alaska hard as prices paid for fish and copper, the territory\u2019s two chief commodities, declined. Between 1929 and 1932, the work force decreased by more than half, and wages dropped. Help came from New Deal programs such as the National Reforestation Act of 1933 and various Public Works Administration construction efforts. Most famous among government efforts in Alaska during the Depression is the 1935 Matanuska Valley colonization scheme. President Franklin D. Roosevelt imagined that Americans from depressed agricultural areas could be transplanted to Alaska\u2019s Matanuska-Susitna region and given a fresh chance at agricultural self-sustainment. Around 1,000 colonists were selected from some 15,000 applicants, largely from Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota \u2014 on the assumption that the similar climate of these areas to Alaska would best suit settlers for life in the North. A related but completely ill-fated idea was Dr. Joe Thomas\u2019 \u201cAlaska Colonization Branch of the United Congo Improvement Association,\u201d which proclaimed that \u201cAlaska offers the American Negro full political rights.\u201d The UCIA asked that President Roosevelt settle some 400 Negro farmers in Alaska, but existing racial prejudices and prevailing beliefs that only people from northern lands were suited for life in Alaska doomed the proposal.\n\nThe War Years: A Decade of Growth: While the New Deal aided Alaska, it took an event of much greater scale and purpose to truly bring the Territory onto the national stage. As early as 1933, Delegate Anthony J. Dimond had recognized Japan as a threat to America\u2019s security and asked Congress for military airfields and planes, a highway to link the territory with the United States, and army garrisons. Telling his colleagues in the House of Representatives that Japanese fishermen off Alaska\u2019s coast were actually disguised military personnel scouting out information on Alaska\u2019s harbors, Dimond pleaded that Alaska was as much a key to the Pacific as Hawaii and must be defended. In 1940, Congress appropriated money for military installations, but it took the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the 1942 occupation by Japan of Attu and Kiska islands on the Aleutian Chain for military mobilization to begin in earnest. Billions of dollars in defense spending came into the state in the construction of the Alaska Highway, the capture and eventual fortification of the Aleutian islands, and the construction of military bases throughout the state.\n\nIn 1940, about 1,000 of Alaska\u2019s 75,000 residents were military. By 1943, 152,000 out of 233,000 belonged to the armed forces stationed in Alaska. And even though there was a post-war drop in population to about 99,000 in 1946, Cold War military expenditures pushed it back up to around 138,000 by 1950. The war years irrevocably changed Alaska.\n\nAttention in the national press increasingly raised awareness about Alaska\u2019s situation, described by Richard L. Neuberger in Newsweek as a \u201cfeudal barony\u201d where the absentee-owned mining and fishing corporations took out millions in natural resources and left next to nothing behind in the form of social and economic benefits \u2014 a \u201clooted land.\u201d 10 It became increasingly obvious that keeping territorial government and tax structures to a minimum benefitted Seattle-area interests such as the Alaska Steamship Company and the Northland Transportation Company, who enjoyed an effective monopoly on steamship travel and shipping and charged unusually high rates. Alaskan businessmen such as Austin E. \u201cCap\u201d Lathrop \u2014 Alaska\u2019s premier \u201ccapitalist\u201d \u2014 were able to benefit greatly from the minimal taxes and argued against statehood for fear that its\u2019 stricter tax laws might diminish their position. The anti-statehood faction had a powerful hold in the Territory, and might have quelled the issue were it not for two especially vigorous pro-statehood advocates, Ernest Gruening and E. L. \u201cBob\u201d Bartlett.\n\nErnest Gruening, an Easterner with a history of progressive politics, had served as publicity director for Senator Robert M. LaFollette\u2019s presidential candidacy in 1924 when LaFollette polled five million votes but lost the race. Gruening traveled and worked in Mexico and Europe before serving as editor of the Nation until he was appointed by F. D. Roosevelt in 1934 to run the fledgling Division of Territories and Island Possessions. In 1939, FDR appointed Gruening to the governorship of Alaska. Edward Lewis \u201cBob\u201d Bartlett, with whom Gruening was to work closely for the next quarter-century, had served as secretary to Congressional delegate Anthony J. Dimond, remaining in Washington until 1934. Bartlett operated a placer gold mine for a while before President Roosevelt appointed him secretary of Alaska in January 1939. In 1944, Bartlett ran for and won the position which Wickersham and Dimond had held \u2014 Territorial Delegate to Congress. Beginning in 1945, Delegate Bartlett acted as Alaska\u2019s only representative in the halls of Congress.\n\nThe Drive Toward Statehood: Legislative and Populist Efforts: Historian Claus Naske divides the statehood movement in Alaska into two phases.11 First, between 1943 and 1953, Alaska\u2019s governor (Gruening), the delegate to Congress (Bartlett), and a cross-section of the territory\u2019s established business and professional men and women engineered numerous legislative efforts to achieve statehood for Alaska. Gruening was frustrated by the fact that after three decades under the American flag, Alaska was still without adequate roads, airfields, tuberculosis hospitals, and dependable shipping at reasonable cost. What was more, the aboriginal rights issue had not yet been settled, and homesteaders were not yet legally able to acquire land from the federal government. He felt that the only tools by which Alaskans could amend their plight were two United States senators and a Representative in the House, each with a vote.\n\nThe 3:2 passage of a 1946 referendum in favor of statehood led to the formation of the Alaska Statehood Association \u2014 an ad hoc group of concerned citizens \u2014 later that year. Meanwhile, Gruening lobbied hard in Washington with the members of the influential Senate Public Lands Committee, especially Senator Hugh Butler of Nebraska. Delegate Bartlett introduced a statehood bill in April, 1948 which was corralled in the Rules Committee by Senator Butler. It never came up for debate, but many Alaskans had testified to their desire for statehood and the interest of numerous others was aroused as the possibility of statehood became more plausible. Furthermore, Alaskan voters decided that year to reform the territory\u2019s tax structure to loosen the hold of the special interests.\n\nThe Alaska Statehood Committee was formed in 1949 to intensify efforts toward statehood, calling on national and labor organizations, newspaper editors, and state governors to support and publicize Alaska\u2019s situation. Gruening himself compiled a \u201ccommittee of one-hundred\u201d prominent Americans who supported Alaska\u2019s aspirations, including Eleanor Roosevelt, actor James Cagney, Pearl S. Buck, John Gunther, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. 1949 was a watershed year for the statehood movement, as it received growing attention both in Alaska and in the nation at large. A bill for statehood passed the House by a vote of 186-146 early in 1950, but was killed in the Senate by a coalition of conservative Republicans and southern Democrats, backed tacitly by President Eisenhower. This coalition wanted to preserve the tenuous Republican majority in Congress, and opposed Alaska\u2019s entry into the Union for fear that its congressional voice would be Democratic. The Korean War, which began in June of 1950 and lasted into 1952, effectively put concerns about Alaska statehood on the back burner.\n\nThe second, or \u201cpopulist\u201d phase in Naske\u2019s analysis, involved the efforts of thousands of regular Alaskans to foment popular interest in the statehood drive. The New York Journal-American put the situation dramatically: \u201cAlaska wants statehood with the fervor men and women give to a transcendent cause. An overwhelming number of men and women voters in the United States want statehood for Alaska. This Nation needs Alaskan statehood to advance her defense, sustain her security, and discharge her deep moral obligation.\u201d\n\nSuch enthusiasm served as a counterweight to the typical arguments made against Alaska statehood: noncontiguity with the rest of the country, lack of population, inadequate political maturity, and meager financial resources. Senator Butler and five members of the Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee decided to hold hearings in Alaska on a statehood bill; they wanted to hear the \u201creaction of the \u201clittle people\u201d of Alaska. The Butler committee heard testimony in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau and Ketchikan. The visit of Butler\u2019s committee brought together many Alaskans sympathetic to the statehood cause, and popular publicity movements such as \u201cOperation Statehood\u201d put increased pressure on Congress for Alaska statehood. Women in the committee, for example, made artificial bouquets out of the Forget-me-Not, Alaska\u2019s official flower, and mailed them to members of Congress prior to the consideration of statehood legislation. The citizens of Alaska sent Christmas cards to friends in the contiguous U.S. which urged: \u201cMake [Alaskans] future bright/Ask your Senator for statehood/And start the New Year right.\u201d Members of Congress could no longer invoke \u201clack of public interest\u201d as an argument against Alaska Statehood.\n\nPresident Eisenhower, in his 1954 State of the Union address, requested the immediate admission of Hawaii into the Union but did not mention Alaska. The editor of the Washington Post wrote of a \u201cmurky cloud of politics\u201d surrounding such a position, as it was becoming evident that the Republican administration thought Hawaii would come into the Union as a Republican state, while Alaska would come in favoring the Democrats. Eventually the Senate put together a combination statehood bill, which provided for the admission first of Hawaii and then of Alaska. This bill immediately became the centerpiece of Congressional partisan wrangling. Operation Statehood swamped the White House with telegrams asking for \u201cstatehood now.\u201d A delegation of Operation Statehood\u2019s members flew to Washington, D.C. to meet with President Eisenhower, and they made a dramatic impression. John Butrovich, a Fairbanks insurance agent and senior Republican in the territorial legislature, told Eisenhower: \u201cWe feel that you are a great American. But we are shocked to come down here and find that a bill which concerns the rights of American citizens is bottled up in a committee when you have the power to bring it out on the House floor.\u201d\n\nEisenhower reddened as Butrovich banged his fists on the Chief Executive\u2019s desk to emphasize his dissatisfaction. The President denied that any partisanship played a role in the Alaska statehood issue and assured the members that Alaska statehood posed many problems which needed attention. He was most likely concerned, however, with preserving the narrow Republican margin in Congress.\n\nThe next effort to derail the statehood cause came in the form of a Senate proposal to make Alaska and Hawaii \u201ccommonwealths\u201d of the U.S., with elective governorships. National columnists such as Walter Lippmann and Richard Strout favored this step, but the interest of the people of Alaska was not swayed from statehood. No one savored the prospect of paying federal taxes yet remaining, in effect, a stranger to the Union. Another series of Congressional hearings about Alaska\u2019s situation instilled in many Alaskans an interest in more aggressive action. Such enthusiasm ultimately brought about the 1955 Constitutional Convention, held in the newly appointed \u201cConstitution Hall\u201d on the grounds of the University of Alaska-Fairbanks. It was here that Senator Ernest Gruening delivered his galvanizing \u201cLet Us End American Colonialism\u201d address. The convention received phenomenal national exposure and was praised by numerous journalists for its idealistic attention to \u201cthe good of Alaska\u201d rather than partisan politics. The convention was an intensely emotional event for all involved, as passions about the future of Alaska ran strong and deep among convention members. In 1956, the resulting Constitution \u2014 which the National Municipal League called \u201cone of the best, if not the best, state constitutions ever written\u201d \u2014 was overwhelmingly accepted by Alaskans.\n\nAnother crucial maneuver toward statehood was the adoption of the Tennessee Plan, proposed by George H. Lehleitner, an ex-Navy commander. The plan, which had been used successfully by Tennessee, Michigan, California, Oregon, Kansas, and Iowa, involved electing a Congressional delegation without waiting for an enabling act from Congress. In the spring of 1956, Alaskans elected Ernest Gruening and William Egan as Senators-elect and Ralph J. Rivers as House Representative-elect. With support for statehood firmly established in Alaska, the stage was now set for reinvigorated efforts in the nation\u2019s Congress. Egan, Gruening, and Rivers were received with much fanfare, but were not officially seated or recognized by Congress.\n\nWorking together with Delegate Bob Bartlett, the Tennessee Plan delegation lobbied hard in the Senate and the House. Influential House Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas, until the summer of 1957 a foe of statehood, changed his mind and promised to give the territory a chance to be heard. Rayburn, when asked about his change in view, answered \u201cI can tell you in two words, \u2018Bob Bartlett\u2019.\u201d\n\nStatehood Achieved: With sectional conflicts breaking down and the power of the \u201cDixiecrats\u201d diminishing, Congress reconvened in January 1958 to the sounds of President Eisenhower fully endorsing Alaska statehood for the first time. Senator Lyndon B. Johnson assured Bartlett that the southern Senators would not filibuster the Alaska bill. Johnson\u2019s was an important commitment, yet Representative Howard W. Smith of Virginia, Chairman of the powerful Rules Committee, stepped in to obstruct the statehood bill. Life magazine tartly characterized Smith as a \u201cVirginia gentleman whose impeccable manners include little real respect for either free enterprise or democracy.\u201d Additionally, Representative Thomas Pelly of Washington state demanded the right for his constituents to fish Alaskan waters on the same basis as residents. An amendment was subsequently drafted seeking retention of federal jurisdiction over Alaska\u2019s fish and game resources until the secretary of the interior certified to Congress that the state met provisions for their conservation and nonresident access. The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner responded to Pelly\u2019s petulance by printing excerpts from Edna Ferber\u2019s impassioned novel Ice Palace. The passages featured the character of Thor Storm, the grizzled Nordic pioneer, informing his granddaughter, Christine, about the legacy of Seattle and San Francisco cannery operators\u2019 unmerciful exploitation of Alaska\u2019s fisheries. Ferber\u2019s book had sold well and widely.

The level of interest in Alaska and the number of non-Native residents was soon to increase. The discovery and development of the Treadwell Mine on Douglas Island, across from what is now Juneau was the first in a series of major discoveries that attracted new settlers to various parts of Alaska. Over the next 20 years, the non-Native population would grow to the point that it equaled and then exceeded the Native population, creating a new era in Alaska. The prospect of riches from these gold discoveries added to a growing clamor to set up an Alaskan government. Residents of Juneau, the first new town developed after the purchase, joined with people in other Southeast settlements to demand action by Congress in 1881. The immigrants, without any legal way to stake and their hold mining claims or to get title to land, made a plea for civilian government. A convention in Juneau in August 1881 was described by historian Ted Hinckley as \"the first really consequential territorial political gathering.\" The convention sponsored a write-in election the next month and elected a former Confederate officer, Mottrom Ball, as their unofficial Alaska delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives. \"We hold it to be undeniable that such representation is one of the assured privileges of citizenship,\" the sponsors said. The U.S. House of Representatives did not accept the credentials of the Alaska delegate, but it did allocate money for his expenses and he lobbied Congress to extend government to Alaska. Other unofficial delegates would be sent to Washington to plead Alaska's case in 1890 and 1899. The federal government had started to pay more attention to Alaska in the early 1880s. In his first State of the Union address, President Chester Arthur said he regretted \"that the people of Alaska have reason to complain that they are as yet unprovided with any form of government . . .\" At the same time there was a growing tension between Natives and the minority white population, especially due to the governmental vacuum in Sitka after the Army left. One of the most unusual events of this time happened when non-Natives in Sitka appealed for help from a British naval base in Victoria, B.C. because they feared a Native uprising. A ship, the H.M.S. Osprey, responded and everything quieted down. For five years after this incident, the U.S. Navy assumed the role of governing Alaska. Another incident that revealed underlying tensions occurred when a Tlingit shaman died from a harpoon accident in 1882 in Angoon. Villagers wanted payment and took hostages. The Northwest Trading Company asked for assistance from the U.S. Navy, which led to the shelling on Angoon and the burnig of houses and canoes. Eighty-nine years later the U.S. government settled claims from the case for $90,000. Among the strongest and most effective lobbyists pushing Congress to do something about Alaska was Dr. Sheldon Jackson, a Presbyterian missionary who first went north in 1877 to open a mission at Wrangell. He rose to prominence by speaking to hundreds of groups, writing articles and working with political leaders in order to get a stronger federal role in respect to Natives. Jackson thought of Alaska Natives as people in need of conversion to Christianity and he condemned the non Natives who took advantage of them. Jackson lobbied hard in Washington for the government to provide money and the means to set up schools. He was interested in evangelization, while others focused on economic potential. All these lobbyists prodded Congress toward a decision. The First Organic Act\n\nOrganic Act of 1884\n\nAn act providing a civil government for Alaska. May 17, 1884. An act providing a civil government for Alaska. May 17, 1884. First Organic Act provided the bare essentials of government. As a Congressional committee reported, \"the inhabitants have been absolutely without the pale of law, and without any protection of life or property.\" Though the law did not allow a legislature or any other elected representation for the people of Alaska, it did call for a \"temporary\" capital at Sitka, a district court, a governor, a district attorney, a U.S. marshal and other offices. Alaska historian Robert DeArmond wrote that the most important elements of the act were the creation of the court and the fact that law enforcement responsibility was assigned to the U.S. marshal. The president was authorized to appoint the governor, who would operate, as much as possible under the laws of the State of Oregon as they existed in1884. They did state that any future changes to Oregon law would not apply to Alaska however. The district governors appointed were \"superfluous,\" DeArmond wrote, \"except as lobbyists in Washington, but when they performed that functions, they were criticized for spending too much time out of the district.\" The first governor was John H. Kinkead, who served for less than a year before a change in administration in Washington left him out of a job. S.H. Young, a prominent Presbyterian missionary, wrote of Kinkead that he arrived with \"an immense supply of cases labeled 'Canned tomatoes.' These 'tomatoes' were proclaimed as tasting exactly like Scotch whiskey and producing the same effect.'\" Political scientist Melvin Crain wrote that the first governors \"had practically no civil duties to perform except to inspect, report and to enforce a handful of contradictory laws, with no enforcement means provided.\" The law acknowledged the land rights of Alaska Natives in a provision that was to have long-lasting consequences. It said Natives \"shall not be disturbed in the possession of any lands actually in their use or occupation or now claimed by them\" and that the terms under which they would get title to their lands would be decided in the future by Congress. The law also opened Alaska to mining claims and said that the provisions of a 1872 mining law were in force. It also said that the land laws of the United States would be withheld, which meant there was no way to get title to private land, a restriction that would cause constant complaints. Another important feature of the First Organic Act called for the establishment of schools. Mission schools were allowed to select 640 acres and $25,000, -not nearly enough money- was allocated to provide for schools. Dr. Sheldon Jackson was appointed the first General Agent of Education for Alaska, a Washington, D.C. position. He had much influence over policies in Alaska and he often clashed with the early governors about those policies. Changes after the Gold Rush Prospectors headed north by the tens of thousands after gold was discovered in the Klondike in 1896. They spilled over into Alaska, joining the gold-seekers who had come earlier to the Forty Mile and Circle gold strikes, and those who would come later to Nome and Fairbanks. Alaska's population doubled between 1890 and 1900, reaching 63,592. The increase led to more pressure to expand the government system in Alaska which had been inadequate since its adoption in 1884. In the 1890s, the traditional \"miners' meeting\" was the only form of local government many of the gold rush towns knew. The miners would gather in a group and adopt rules and regulations by a majority vote. This practice from the American West was the only form of local government in Interior Alaska until 1900. In the midst of the gold rush publicity that put Alaska in the national spotlight, Congress tried to correct some of the problems in the laws about Alaska. It adopted a new civil code that allowed any community of 300 or more to incorporate with seven-member city councils and three-member school boards. The major towns took steps to organize under the provisions of this law and elect local officials. Congress also set up new judicial districts, important for filing legal papers. It adopted a code specifying what activities were illegal and the punishment for violations. Much to Sheldon Jackson's dismay, the prohibition on alcohol was repealed. The civilcode of 1900 was fine as far as it went, the governor of Alaska told Congress in 1906, but \"I think it would be wise to provide some means by which the Alaskan code of laws could be revised.\" In 1905, Congress moved the capital to Juneau, which had grown because of mining, while Sitka had become less important since the Russian era. One element in the new laws allowed for territorial taxation, in the form of business license taxes. This led to complaints of \"taxation without representation,\" a contradiction that helped spur the campaign to give Alaska a voice in Congress. In 1903, a Senate subcommittee reported that \"the universal opinion among all classes in Alaska is that the District should be represented by a delegate in Congress.\" Repeated attempts by Alaskans and sympathetic members of Congress to get a delegate failed to get out of committee during the latter years of the 19th century. Many people believed that even a representative without a vote would be better than no representative at all. Alaskans wanted someone who could lend balance to the political situation in Washington D.C. where the unelected lobbyists of mining and shipping companies and the canned salmon industry made sure that their interests were protected. Historian Jeannette Paddock Nichols wrote in 1924 that the corporations preferred this \"self-appointed delegate\" system. Frustrated at the lack of progress, citizens of Valdez sent a telegram to President Theodore Roosevelt on the day of his inauguration: \"On behalf of 60,000 American citizens who are denied the right of representation in any form, we demand, in mass meeting assembled, that Alaska be annexed to Canada.\" A Delegate for Alaska The campaign for a representative voice in the nation's capital paid off in 1906, when Congress finally allowed Alaskans to have one non-voting member in the U.S. House of Representatives. Some Congressmen supported the addition because Alaska was becoming more famous as a result of the gold rush and so it required more attention. As President Roosevelt put it in a message to Congress, he preferred an elective delegate \"whose business it shall be to speak with authority. \" From then on Alaska was a \"territory,\" not a district as it had been called in the past. The early delegates made it a priority to seek a locally elected legislature to expand the voice of Alaskans, and to allow for a truly representative government, not one that was controlled so much by federal appointees.\n\nDedication of Court Building in Fairbanks by Judge Wickersham, 1904 Wickersham won the election and became a delegate in 1908. He gained public support with warnings that the corporate power of J.P. Morgan and the Guggenheims was trying to dominate mining and transportation in Alaska. Morgan was the leading banker in the United States, and the Guggenheims had made fortunes in the Colorado copper mines. They teamed up to build the first major standard-guage railroad in Alaska and to develop a rich copper deposit in the Wrangell Mountains. They also controlled most of the ships that sailed to Alaska. \"The central political issue in Alaska, as Wickersham phrased it, was whether the territory would have Government Rule or Guggenheim rule,\" historian Terrence Cole wrote. Wickersham introduced many bills to create a territorial legislature, arguing that since the non-Native population had grown to more than 25,000, Alaska deserved a right given to other territories a century earlier, when they had a population one-fifth the size. One of the main arguments on the other side came from Alaska's appointed governor, Walter Clark, who said the territory could not afford a legislature. His views were in sync with those of the large companies that feared new taxes and claimed it was far better to have continued federalcontrol than to have even limited self-government. \"A large portion of the agitation for territorial government comes from the saloon element in Alaska, which is desirous of decreasing the burdens now imposed on that business and at the same time obtain a greater liberty than they now have in the conduct of their business,\" said the previous governor W.B. Hoggatt. Wickersham countered such arguments by saying it was disgraceful to deny Alaskans self-government \"while the big interests are permitted from day to day to gather to themselves the advantages and undeveloped resources of the land.\" He said a legislature would be like a policeman on the ground, keeping Alaska's resources from being stolen by the big companies. Though he had no vote in Congress, Wickersham worked tirelessly after his election in 1908 to get a territorial legislature for Alaska. Helped by political changes in the makeup of Congress, the Organic Act of 1912 finally cleared the House and Senate in 1912, allowing for an elected legislature. President William Howard Taft chose to sign the legislation on August 24, 1912, Wickersham's 55th birthday. Links: Mining Laws of the Harris District\n\nLt.

Forty-five years later, in 1912, the US Congress voted to create the Territory of Alaska and establish the Alaska Territorial Legislature. The first session of the legislature met from March 3 to May 1, 1913 in the Juneau Elks Lodge.[1] Their first act of the all-male Territorial Legislature was to grant Alaska women the right to vote.\n\nHouse Bill No. 2, An Act to Extend the Elective Franchise to Women in the Territory of Alaska, reads:\n\nBe it enacted by the legislature of the Territory of Alaska: That in all elections which are now, or may be hereafter authorized by law in the Territory of Alaska, or any sub-division or municipality thereof, the elective franchise is hereby extended to such women as have the qualifications of citizenship required of male electors.\n\nThe bill passed the House on March 14, 1913; passed the Senate on March 18, 1913; and was signed into law by the Governor of Alaska Territory, Walter Eli Clark, on March 21, 1913.[2]\n\nExcluded from voting were Alaska Natives, who were denied the vote and participation in elections by the Act that established the Alaska Territory. Activists from the Alaska Native Brotherhood and Sisterhood advocated for Native suffrage rights. In 1915, the Alaska Territorial Legislature recognized the right of Indigenous people to vote on the condition they gave up tribal customs and traditions.\n\nIn 1924, the Indian Citizenship Act was signed into law, granting US citizenship to all Native Americans -- including those in Alaska, and regardless of whether they gave up their culture. But states could limit who had access to the vote, and many states -- including Alaska -- excluded certain groups from the ballot. In Alaska, as in many of the Southern US states, the Territorial Legislature passed a literacy requirement for all new voters. While it seems as though the law was only selectively enforced, it remained in effect, and became part of the Alaska State Constitution.\n\nAlaska did not become a US state until January 3, 1959 and so was unable to vote to ratify the 19th Amendment before it became law in 1920.\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] First Territorial Legislature members were:\n\nSenate : Elwood Bruner, Conrad Freeding, Thomas McGann, B.F.

He next worked his way into politics, eventually gaining the presidential appointment as territorial governor of Alaska, and onward to a prestigious seat in the U.S. Senate. Gruening fought hard for Alaska to become the 49th state, and eventually became known as the \"Father of Alaska Statehood.\" Gruening was born in New York City on February 6, 1887. His father, Emil Gruening, was a famous physician, and hoped that his only son would follow in his footsteps. The young Gruening graduated from Harvard University in 1907, and five years later from Harvard Medical School. However, his passion was in social and political development and he longed to become a journalist. Shortly after his graduation from medical school, Gruening took a job as a reporter for the Boston American, then the Boston Evening Herald as an editorial writer from 1912 to 1913. He continued to develop his journalism career and went on to become an editor, working simultaneously for both the Boston Evening Traveler and the New York Tribune during a four-year period. After serving in World War I, Gruening returned to New York, and from 1920 to 1923 served as editor of The Nation. He edited the New York Post from 1932 to 1933. Throughout his journalism career, Gruening fought for the cause of labor and for minorities. Eventually, his crusade began to include fighting for rights for territories and possessions of the United States. Gruening's interests began to sway more toward politics. He was intrigued by the politics surrounding the New Deal and wanted to be part of the action. In 1933, he was appointed to the U.S. delegation to the 7th Inter-American Conference in Montevideo, Chile. In 1934, President Franklin Roosevelt appointed Gruening Director of the Division of Territories and Island Possessions within the Department of the Interior. During his years as director, he also served as administrator of the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration. Gruening eventually made his way to Alaska in 1938, when he served on the Alaska International Highway Commission. By 1939, he was appointed territorial governor of Alaska by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a position in which he served until 1953. While governor, Gruening fought for Alaska statehood along with the protection and utilization of the territory's resources.\n\n\n\nAs governor, Gruening also worked hard for the equality of the Native people. He worked alongside the Alaska Native Brotherhood (ANB) to combat the gross discrimination against Natives. Tlingit leader Roy Peratrovich, former superintendent for the Anchorage Bureau of Indian Affairs, recalled those times during a 1974 interview with the Anchorage Daily News: \"I remember in 1941, when I moved back to Juneau to serve my second term with the Alaska Native Brotherhood (ANB). I was shocked to see signs in store windows saying, 'No Natives Allowed,' or even 'No Natives or Dogs Allowed.'\"\n\n\n\nThe scorned Natives and the ANB petitioned the governor to do something for Native civil rights. Gruening, along with representatives of the ANB, personally visited each business, to no avail. The problem only worsened. Gruening did not back down. Rather, he and Peratrovich, along with Elizabeth Peratrovich, strategized with Gruening's friend and political ally, Anthony Dimond, Alaska's non-voting representative in the U.S. House. Together they worked to draft a bill enabling not just Natives, but all minorities, to have the same civil rights as white citizens. The bill was first introduced to state legislature in 1943 and was defeated. However, two years later and with the election of three ANB members to the state legislature, the bill was passed. Equal rights among all people was the law in Alaska. Three decades later, Peratrovich looked back: \"I understand that bill is still the best in the United States. It was 20 years ahead of its time. Not only the Indian people but all minorities owe a great debt to Ernest Gruening.\" In 1950, a bill for Alaska Statehood passed the House by a 40-vote margin but was stifled in committee hearings by the Senate; however, this did not slow down the determined men pushing for statehood. Gruening, along with Bob Bartlett, the territory's congressional delegate, continued to speak in favor of statehood, seeking the support of the people of both Alaska and the Lower 48. Alaskans responded with the 1955 Constitutional Convention and elected a \"Tennessee Plan\" delegation to Congress. During this time, Gruening was elected to the U. S. Senate from the Territory of Alaska; however, because Alaska was not a state, he received no senatorial privileges. In the Tennessee Plan, Gruening and William Egan were the Senators-elect, and Ralph Rivers was Representative-elect. In 1956, the three men engaged in a cross-country lobbying tour, driving to Washington and stumping for statehood as they approached the nation's capital.\n\nIn April 1958, both houses of Congress passed a resolution of statehood for Alaska. Although statehood was still pending, Alaskans elected Gruening, a Democrat, to the U.S. Senate the same year.\n\n\n\nGruening's dream was finally realized with the admission of Alaska into the United States on January 3, 1959, when President Eisenhower signed the bill into law. During the time he was fighting for Alaska, Gruening had been urging statehood for Hawaii as well. Hawaii was admitted as the 50th state on August 21, 1959, just months after Alaska's entrance.\n\nGruening's official four-year term as U.S. Senator began with statehood, and he was reelected in 1962. Gruening served in the Senate until January 3, 1969, ending with the loss of the 1968 election to fellow Democrat Mike Gravel.\n\n\n\nAlthough Gruening lost the election, his involvement in politics did not end. Up until his death in 1974, he worked as a legislative consultant and president of an investment firm. Nor did his love of writing cease -- Gruening wrote and edited many books, on subjects ranging from politics to the history of Alaska to his own autobiography. He died June 26, 1974, in Washington D.C. Afterward, Gruening's cremated remains were sprinkled over Mount Ernest Gruening, located north of Juneau. In 1977, Alaska donated a statue of Gruening to be placed in Washington, D.C.'s National Statuary Hall Collection.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://akhistory.lpsd.com/articles/article.php?artID=221/", "page_content": "Governing Alaska Campaign for Statehood A New Era in Alaska\n\nIn the United States Capitol building in Washington, D.C., every state is allowed to display statues of two outstanding citizens. The National Statuary Hall collection includes presidents, vice presidents, signers of the Declaration of Independence, framers of the United States Constitution and other distinguished Americans. The two Alaskans cast in bronze are Sen. E.L. \"Bob\" Bartlett and Sen. Ernest Gruening. Before they served as Alaska's first United States Senators, Bartlett and Gruening were the powerful one-two punch of the Alaska statehood fight in the 1940s and 1950s. Historian Claus Naske has written that while Bartlett and Gruening did not invent the statehood movement, they \"gave it a vitality and dynamism which it had not possessed before.\" Although Gruening and Bartlett shared a commitment to statehood and membership in the Democratic party, their personalities couldn't have been more different. Bartlett served as Alaska's non-voting delegate to Congress for 14 years before statehood and Gruening worked as territorial governor from 1939-53. A. Robert Smith, a newspaper reporter who wrote about Congress for 25 years said, that Bartlett was \"Mr. Nice Guy in a body overpopulated with SOBs.\" Gruening was a brilliant politician and writer who had a knack of making his opponents, and sometimes even his friends uncomfortable. As the non-voting Alaska delegate, Bartlett had no votes to trade, so he concentrated on winning friends and influencing people. A former miner and Fairbanks newspaperman, Bartlett earned the respect of Alaskans, who knew him as \"Bob,\" a name he picked up as a child when his 4-year-old sister refused to call him by his real name \"Edward.\" Bartlett represented Alaska in Washington, D.C. for the last 25 years of his life, first as a delegate and then for nine years as a senator. Elected seven times as delegate from 1944-59, he devoted his energies to persuading members of Congress that Alaskans deserved better than the \"second-class citizenship\" of territorial rule. Bartlett became a convert to the statehood campaign after former Delegate Anthony Dimond advised that it was the only practical way to proceed, because Congress would probably fight any effort to seek piecemeal improvements in the First Organic Act.\n\nAlaska Capitol, Juneau, ca. 1931\n\nBird's-eye view of the Federal and Territorial Building in Juneau, from the south. Bird's-eye view of the Federal and Territorial Building in Juneau, from the south. After completing 13 years as governor, Gruening wrote a book titled \"The State of Alaska,\" which was published five years before statehood. He used the book as a way to publicize what he thought of as federal neglect of the territory. Gruening's awareness of Alaska's situation really started when President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed him as governor in 1939, two days after Hitler attacked Poland and began World War II. In Alaska, Gruening soon found himself at odds with the canned salmon industry, the shipping industry and the mining industry over new taxes. He wanted them. They didn't. Describing revenues to the territory from Alaska's resources as \"virtually negligible,\" he spent the next ten years fighting for change. \"The wealth of Alaska was being drained off and next to nothing was staying there for its needs,\" he wrote later. Gruening complained that the old tax system benefited special interests and harmed the average Alaskan. He said the dividends from the huge Kennecott mine, which had been abandoned in 1938 after producing $200 million in copper, had enriched \"many individuals who never saw Alaska and had no thought of ever coming here or doing anything for the Territory. . .\" Although mining and fishing topped the list of industries, by 1947 more money poured into the treasury from alcohol than anything else. \"At that time we had no financial structure that was worthy of the name,\" Mildred Hermann, a Juneau attorney, recalled. \"We financed our government on the basis of how the red salmon ran and how much liquor people drank and that was almost the total source of our revenues. . ..\" Starting in 1941, Gruening introduced measures for a modern tax system. The legislature though refused to act. The low point came in 1947, when lawmakers created a fiscal crisis, authorizing more than $10 million in spending and only $6.3 million in income. The money ran out that fall. In the crisis that followed, the University of Alaska kept going only because members of the Board of Regents, UA President Charles Bunnell and business leaders offered emergency loans to keep the doors open. Gruening wrote in his autobiography that Alaska voters responded by \"throwing the rascals out\" in the 1948 election. \"Alaskans realized how an effectively organized minority in the legislature had betrayed their interests and had left the territory in a deplorable state,\" he said. With the change in Juneau, a comprehensive new tax system won approval in 1949, an act that some viewed as a prerequisite to show that Alaska was ready for statehood. For Bartlett and Gruening, another decade would pass before they achieved their common goal.

Truman said that statehood should be granted as soon as the government knew where the people of Alaska stood on the issue. He had an answer soon enough. In an advisory vote that fall, Alaskans voted 9,630 to 6,822 in favor of joining the union. George Sundborg, a journalist who had made a pro-statehood study, said the size of the negative vote was due to the \"sourpuss branch of the sourdough family.\" Many Alaskans looked for more support from the Truman administration and Congress after the vote, but resistance remained. Bartlett introduced one of many statehood bills in 1947. In one hearing, the head of Alaska Airlines testified about pressure by the salmon industry to keep quiet, or else he would lose their business.\n\nAK Governor Mike Stepovich and Congressional Advocates for Statehood In 1949, the legislature approved creation of the Alaska Statehood Committee, an 11-member group headed by Anchorage Times Publisher Bob Atwood. The Committee pushed the statehood effort through education and lobbying. The campaign failed to make much national headway for three years though, because of the Korean War. Following the war, Sen. Hugh Butler of Nebraska, a statehood opponent, announced that his committee would hold hearings in Alaska. He said he didn't want to hear from \"just a few aspiring politicians who want to be senators and representatives, but from the \"little people\" of Alaska. A group of supporters that formed with the name \"Little Men For Statehood\" turned out in support of statehood at Butler's 1953 hearings. Signs popped up in Anchorage store windows that said, \"I'm a Little Man Who Wants Statehood.\" Women agreed. Margaret Rutledge of Anchorage told a story of how she had been on her way to the inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower when she was reminded of the second-class status of Alaskans. At the Seattle airport she had to go through immigration procedures, which she said was humiliating. Before ending her testimony in tears, Rutledge told the senators that a \"degrading influence had robbed me of the thing I value most--my birthright as an American.\" The statehood movement developed strong support in the mid and late 1950s among average Alaskans, who signed onto grassroots organizations such as \"Operation Statehood\" and the \"John Q. Citizen\" campaign. National politics entered into the picture because Republicans feared that Alaska would send Democrats to Congress, which could tip the scales of power. The Republican Eisenhower administration supported statehood for Hawaii, which was expected to be favorable to the GOP, but delayed on admitting Alaska.

Because of his work for the canned salmon industry, his opponents dubbed him \"Fish\" Arnold. To his friends he was \"Bill.\" By any name, Winton C. Arnold was perhaps the most influential lobbyist in Alaska in the 1940s and 1950s. Arnold represented the canned salmon industry in Juneau during those years, and was a strong voice at Congressional hearings and in Juneau. John Butrovich, a long time territorial and state senator from Fairbanks, once told a reporter that Arnold was exceptionally capable. \"You couldn't be that good and not be smart,\" Butrovich said. \"He was the best I saw, in my time, and I was there for 30 years. And I'm looking at it from the other side.\" Butrovich opposed Arnold's work to continue the advantages of the canned salmon industry - including big tax breaks - in Alaska. Many said Arnold stopped andy tax reform legislation for a decade in the territorial Legislature. He became the most effective and articulate opponent of Alaska statehood. Arnold typically did not say he opposed statehood. . He made a habit, though of pointing out obstacles, such as transportation problems, and the need to settle Alaska Native land claims. He also said Alaska could not afford to become a state because of the additional burdens that it would place on its citizens. Since less than 1% of Alaska had been surveyed, it would take thousands of years for Alaska to acquire its land if a traditional land grant system was used with the granting of statehood, he said at one hearing. Alaska territorial delegate E.L. \"Bob\" Bartlett described Arnold as an opponent of every progressive proposal for Alaska and \"a smooth operator\u00ad--intelligent and with a pleasing personality.\" He hosted private lunches for senators, and made elaborate presentations to show the economic damage that statehood would cause Alaska. Mary Lee Council, Bartlett's administrative assistant, said that by explaining the problems with statehood bills before Congress in an attempt to stop statehood, Arnold's complaints forced Congress to resolve those issues. In that way, Arnold's stalling tactics improved the chances that the state would have the resources it needed for survival. The provisions eventually adopted by Congress gave the new state more than five times as much land as had been proposed in some of the early proposals.

He resigned his post in 1908 and was subsequently elected as Alaska's delegate to Congress, serving until 1917 and then being re-elected in 1930. He was instrumental in the passage of the Organic Act of 1912, which granted Alaska territorial status, introduced the Alaska Railroad Bill, legislation to establish McKinley Park, and the first Alaska Statehood Bill in 1916. He was among those responsible for the creation of the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines, which later became the University of Alaska. A residence hall on the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus is named in his honor.\n\nWickersham was born near Patoka, Illinois and moved in 1883 with his wife, Deborah, to Tacoma, Washington Territory, where he became a judge. While in Tacoma he was a member of the Tacoma Academy of Science and was President of that organization in 1893. He presented a paper to the Academy on 6 Feb, 1893, entitled, Is it Mount Tacoma, or Rainier? During the presentation the \"following prominent Indians representing the Puyallup, Nesqually and Klickitat tribes were seated on the platform: George Leschi, son of Quiemuth, a leader in the Indian war of 1855; Jack Simmons; John Hiaton, one of the patriarchs of the reservation, 80 years of age, and a signer of the treaty of 1854; Mrs. John Hiaton and John Powers\". The presentation has been reproduced by a digital file created at the Library of Congress.[1]\n\nArrival in Alaska\n\nWhen Wickersham set off for Alaska he was allegedly dodging a government posting in Japan, and he told anyone who asked that he preferred the Eagle post, saying he \u201cyearned for the Yukon, not Yokohama\u201d.[2] With the introduction of federal oversight in the form of three district court judges, Wickersham being one of the two new appointees, his peers being Arthur Noyes in Nome and previously established Melville C Brown in Juneau, he was now one of the three most powerful people in Alaska, with no one within 3,000 miles to overrule his decisions or stand in his way. After the Nome Gold Conspiracy involving prominent Republican National Committee member Alexander McKenzie, it was Wickersham they turned to clean up the legal mess left by then ousted Judge Noyes, allegedly involved.[3] Through his hard work, and his tenacity, he made sure everyone understood his authority. His start into Alaskan official law was a litigation of most profound simplicity, and the epitome of Alaskan frontier spirit. \u201cChief Charley, head of the Charley River band of the Tena Indians, was the first litigant to appeal to the new court officials for justice.\u201d[2] Someone from upriver had stolen his dog, a very serious offense that warranted violence if this new American law official could not have it solved within his power peacefully. After being given the run around, Charley finally reached Wickersham and consulted the highest court in the land. After listening carefully Wickersham appointed a deputy to retrieve the stolen animal, and waited with the chief for his return, chatting about everyday problems.[2] When the dog was safely returned two points were driven home, the concrete authority of Judge Wickersham, and that his tenure in Alaska would be one of action. As the most powerful personage of Federal oversight for the vast majority of the interior of Alaska, Wickersham was an important man to have on your side. His relationship with the development of Fairbanks helped shape not only the future of the Interior\u2019s steadily expanding city, but also the shape of things to come for the state. Wickersham\u2019s working relationship with Captain ET. Barnette led to the initially small settlement developing into a city that became a gateway to the arctic. Through Barnette and Wickersham\u2019s efforts, Fairbanks became incorporated, initiated federal development, and settled locations for key federal positions in the city thus insuring its future relevance.[4]\n\nThough they worked well together for the betterment of Alaska, and particularly the interior, they did not always have the best personal relationship. When presiding over one of Barnette\u2019s many gold claim cases, he inferred that if the case went in his favor, Wickersham could benefit from the decision himself after his term was over. \u201cIt was an outright bribe.\u201d [5] Quoted one historian. Personal opinions and ever changing allegiances aside, as far as the future of Fairbanks went, Barnette could always count on Wickersham to have his back as what Barnette wanted usually was what was best for Fairbanks. As Wickersham finished up his time as judge, he moved on to represent Alaskas' interests in Washington.\n\nCongressional delegate\n\nFrom the position of the judge on the trail in Alaska, Wickersham successfully ran for the position of congressional delegate for the District of Alaska in 1908 beginning his term in 1909. In his first two terms as delegate, Wickersham focused on two aspects: territorial status for Alaska and trust-busting the Alaska Syndicate.\n\nThe issue of home-rule in Alaska falls under the popular idea that Alaska had been neglected by the United States federal government since its purchase from Russia in 1867 and was denied any form of self-government. The first semblance of self-government came through the First Organic Act in 1884. This act instated \u201c\u2026a governor, judge, attorney, clerk of court, marshal, four deputy marshals, and four commissioners, who were to function as justices of the peace.\u201d[6] Mainly as a reactionary to the huge population increase during the Klondike gold rush, these government offices were not voted in by Alaskans, but appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate each for a four-year term. This act also moved Alaska from simply a purchased piece of property ruled by the U.S. military to the status of District. However, the Organic Act of 1884 was simply a start to government in Alaska and it still left the control of Alaska\u2019s resources to the federal government and largely, outside private interests.\n\nThe Alaska Syndicate, a conglomeration of privately owned businesses headed by Guggenheim interests, represented outside rule of Alaska\u2019s resources. Their main focus was \u201c\u2026the development of copper, holdings. It was for this purpose that it acquired and operated transportation lines.\u201d[7] Thus, the Alaska Syndicate not only ruled the copper fields but the steamship lines that moved the copper back to the United States. When Wickersham became the Delegate for Alaska, he vowed to relinquish the Alaska Syndicate\u2019s hold on copper and transportation.\n\nOne of the first issues that brought the Alaska Syndicate and Wickersham into battle was over Wickersham\u2019s first attempt to create a territorial legislature in 1909. According to Wickersham\u2019s first bill as delegate, \u201cit provided for a legislature of twenty-four members \u2013 eight in the Senate and sixteen in the House.\u201d[8] However, President Taft believed that Alaska was not ready for territorial government and status. For the Alaska Syndicate, this brought relief. Those interested in Alaska\u2019s resources had opposed Wickersham due to the fear of industry taxes on their copper holdings if Alaska progressed to territorial status, or even worse, statehood.\n\nOnly two years later in Wickersham\u2019s second term as delegate, the home-rule bill passed as the Second Organic Act in 1912 establishing Alaska officially as a United States territory with a legislature. While Congress still maintained heavy control over the territory, it allowed Wickersham to move against the Alaska Syndicate. Continuing on the forward momentum of the Second Organic Act, Wickersham sought, \u201c\u2026congressional authorization for a federal railroad in Alaska.\u201d.[9] While this again would bring more government control to Alaska, it did mean that the Guggenheim hold on transportation would be severely weakened. In order to see this bill passed in the senate, Wickersham stood for over five hours delivering a speech to Congress, at that time the longest speech on record. His effort was not wasted and \u201cthe bill passed the Senate on January 24 by a vote of 46 to 16.\u201d[10]\n\nWickersham would go on to serve several more terms as Alaska\u2019s delegate to Congress, his last term running from 1931-1933. His time as delegate began major political themes in Alaska\u2019s history that still hold today. Alaska exists on the paradoxical theory of demanding state rule over its resources and yet still incredibly dependent on the federal government largely through, presently, the investment of the Department of Defense. Wickersham\u2019s dilemma began this mindset of federal dependence because he saw that as a better alternative than having private interests and \u201cRobber-Barons\u201d ruling over Alaska\u2019s resources.\n\nThe 1903 Denali Climb\n\nWickersham made the first recorded attempt of Mt. Denali (first Dinmore's Mountain, then Mt. Mckinley). Departing from fairbanks May 16, 1903 on the Tanana Chief steamer with two mules, Mark and Hannah. There were four companions that joined him on the trip: George Jeffrey, Mort Stevens, Charlie Web and John McLeod. To finance the venture the men published the first Tanana region Newspaper \u201cThe Fairbanks Miner, Vol. 1, No.1, May, 1903\u201d, eight pages typed up on a typewriter.\n\nOn the second day of being on the steamer, Wickersham's party had a stroke of luck and discovered a boat drifting through the river ice flow. The team dubbed Wickersham the Admiral of the newly named Mudlark and used the boat while traversing the Kantishna River. By June 4 the excursion party had staked Gold Claims on Chitsia Creek, and thanks to a map with description filed at Rampart, led to larger prospecting for the Kantishna Mining.\n\nThe trip took a turn of misfortune when the party came to an impassable mountain face, later known as Wickersham Wall. It was June 20 Wickersham wrote in his diary \u201c...and have reluctantly concluded there is no possible chance of further ascent from this side of Denali at this season--or any other season for that matter.\u201d Even more defeating for the party, is a wreck of their raft in a glacial stream on the descent that destroys their food supply and equipment. Hungry, tired, and terrorized by mosquitoes the group \u201chappily ended the first attempt of white men...to scale the mighty walls of Denali.\u201d[11]\n\nReferences\n\nGeneral\n\nSpecific\n\n1.
