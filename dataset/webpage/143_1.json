During the 1939-45 was he worked in the Postal Censhorship (Uncommon Languages Department) and the Ministry of Information. In 1944 he was elected Professor of Persian in the University of London, in 1946 Professor of Arabic there, and in 1947 Professor of Arabic at Cambridge.

CHITTICK is a professor in the Department of Comparative Studies at the State University of New York, Stony Brook. Prof. Chittick specializes in Islamic intellectual history, especially the philosophical and mystical theology of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries as reflected in Arabic and Persian texts.

Dr. Gamard is a licensed psychologist in California (Ph.D., Psychology, 1986). But his passion is translating Rumi\u2019s poetry inhis spare time. He taught himself classical Persian (starting in 1981) for the sole purpose of reading Rumi in the original language. In 1985, he began collaborating with an Afghan scholar in a translation of Rumi\u2019s quatrains (unpublished).He has been active on the Internet (translation issues concerrning the popular versions of Rumi\u2019s poetry, since 12/97; translations of selections from the Masnavi, with commentary and transliterationof the Persian text, since 6/99).Presently (9/01), he has nearly completed a website (dar-al-masnavi.org) containing all his translated Masnavi selections.\n\nREYNOLD ALLEYNE NICHOLSON (1868-1945), son of Henry Alleyne Nicholson, F.R.S., was educated at Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and Trinity College, Cambrdige, where he read for the Classical Tripos and the Inidan Language Tripos, being elected to a fellowship in 1893.
