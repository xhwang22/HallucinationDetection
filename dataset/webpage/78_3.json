He played an important role in the life of the community before the Dissolution of the Monasteries.\n\nConsidered to be a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Thomas Cromwell, Holgate was appointed president of the Council in the North in 1538, a post he held for 11 years. He lived in the house of the former abbot of St Mary\u2019s Abbey in York, which has survived as King\u2019s Manor.\n\nFollowing the death of Archbishop Lee in September 1544, Holgate was named his successor and was consecrated as Archbishop of York at Lambeth in January 1545, renouncing papal authority.\n\nFrom then, the tenets of Protestant theology were regularly expounded in the Minster for the first time, and organ music was abolished. He instructed that the Minster Library be furnished with new Protestant commentaries on the Bible by theologians like Calvin.\n\nArchbishop Holgate founded three grammar schools in 1546, one at his birthplace of Hemsworth in the West Riding, one at Old Malton and one in York. He required his headmasters to be skilled in Hebrew, Greek and Latin and to take his pupils to the Minster on Sundays.\n\nIn order to prove his Protestantism to the sceptical Duke of Northumberland, in 1550, aged 68, the Archbishop took a bride when he was 68 \u2013 local gentlewoman Barbara Wentworth. This was a year after an Act of Parliament removed the duty of celibacy from the English clergy.\n\nBut when Queen Mary came to the throne in 1553 and returned England to Catholicism, Holgate was sent to the Tower then stripped of his post for breaking his vow of celibacy.\n\nHaving paid the crown \u00a31,000 for his \u2018crimes\u2019 Holgate was set free in January 1555 only to die that November in London."}, {"url": "https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/17223886.meet-archbishop-robert-holgate-founder-archbishop-holgates-school/", "page_content": "Robert Holgate and the restored Archbishop Holgate\u2019s Grammar School playing field gates\n\nLocation of plaque: on the restored gates in Bridge Lane, off Wigginton Road near York Hospital\n\nTHINGS are a little bit different now. But back in Tudor times it wasn't the done thing for a priest who had taken a vow of chastity to suddenly decide to get married.\n\nRobert Holgate wasn't just any priest: he was the Archbishop of York and President of the King's Council in the North. When he married in 1550, at the age of 68, it caused quite a scandal - particularly in conservative northern Church circles.\n\nHe got away with it during the reign of the young, and Protestant, King Edward VI, Henry VIII's son. But when Edward died at the age of 15 in 1553 and his Catholic sister Mary succeeded him, Robert quickly found himself in hot water.\n\nHe was imprisoned in the Tower of London for 'divers offences' - most notably getting married after having taken a vow of chastity.\n\nStripped of all his offices, he apologised to the Queen, and was eventually released in 1555 on payment of a huge fine. It did him little good - he died ten months later, clearly a broken man.\n\nRobert's career was typical of many statesmen in Tudor times. Like Cardinal Wolsey, he rose to dizzying heights, only to fall quickly from grace when he offended the ruling monarch.\n\nHis name survives in York, however, because of something he did while at the height of his power in York.\n\nHolgate had bought the Treasurer's House and other property in Minster Close.\n\nIn 1546, he founded three schools - one in York, one in Hemsworth, and one in Old Malton. The York school was in Ogleforth 'close by the cathedral' and, like other early grammar schools in England, was intended to train students for the church. The curriculum included Latin, Greek and Hebrew with some history, geography and maths but with the emphasis firmly on religious and moral education. Discipline is said to have been severe - as it was for poor Archbishop Robert himself once Queen Mary came to the throne.\n\nThe school survived the Archbishop's fall from grace, however. More than 200 years after his death, an advert in the York Courant in December 1799 stated that: \"The Free Grammar School situate within the Close of the Cathedral Church of York founded by Archbishop Holgate for the Instruction of Youth ... will open again after the Christmas recess on Monday, January 20, 1800.\"\n\nLike other grammar schools Archbishop Holgate's struggled for pupils in the early 1800s: it had just 10 in 1818, and 17 in 1824.\n\nThen, in 1845-6, the York Diocesan School Society built a new training college (St John's College) on Lord Mayor's Walk. A new school, the Yeoman School, was built next door. Opened in 1846 this was intended to cater for the 'middle class children' of agriculturalists, as well as to provide teaching practice for student teachers at St John's.\n\nThe new school ran into financial difficulties, however, and in 1858, after 300 years in Ogleforth, Archbishop Holgate's School took it over.\n\nThe iron gates to the school's playing fields seem to have been designed between 1850 and 1860 by George Townsend Andrews, the architect who had designed St John's College itself. They were made by the Walmgate-based Walker Iron Foundry, which also made railings and gates for the British Museum, as well as others across York, including in St Leonard's Place, York Cemetery, Dean's Park and at St Peter's School.\n\nArchbishop Holgate's School thrived in its new location in Lord Mayor's Walk. By 1915, when the Rev William Johnson retired as headmaster, the school had 294 pupils.\n\nBy then, the school had leased part of Bootham Stray for playing fields, which is why the school playing field gates - which were restored in 2017 by York Civic Trust working with York Hospital - are there to this day.\n\nThe school itself moved to its present site on Hull Road in 1963.\n\nStephen Lewis\n\nFor the stories behind more York Civic Trust plaques, visit yorkcivictrust.co.uk"}, {"url": "https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/c/F31981", "page_content": "This website uses cookies\n\nWe place some essential cookies on your device to make this website work.\n\n\n\nWe'd like to use additional cookies to remember your settings and understand how you use our services.\n\n\n\nThis information will help us make improvements to the website."}, {"url": "https://archbishopholgates.academy/our-school/our-vision-values-care-achievement/our-history/", "page_content": "Archbishop Holgate\u2019s School was founded by one of the leading statesmen of the reign of King Henry VIII. Robert Holgate held absolute political power in the North, running the King\u2019s Council in the North Parts from the King\u2019s Manor, raising armies to subdue the Scots, and operating with the authority of the King himself. In 1545, Henry VIII made him Archbishop of York, thereby complementing Holgate\u2019s political authority with the authority of one of the two leading roles in the Church of England, and cementing his position of absolute supremacy (second only to the King himself) in matters spiritual and temporal north of the Trent. Very soon after he was enthroned as Archbishop of York Holgate he founded a number of schools, ours included. Holgate took a close personal interest in the organisation of each school; his own signature lies at the bottom of each of the twenty-four pages of each of the three surviving copies of our school\u2019s Foundation Deed. Holgate then fell from grace politically, but remained Archbishop of York, a role he fulfilled vigorously until 1554.\n\nThe original school site, between Ogleforth and the City Walls, was on land in the shadow of York Minster owned by Holgate himself. Links between Church and School have remained strong. Indeed, the story of the school over more than four and a half centuries has been intertwined with the story of successive Archbishops of York. No school in the country has more distinguished links with the Church of England than ours, including successive Archbishops appointing Foundation Governors and themselves serving as Foundation Governors of the school. Archbishop Sentamu and the Dean of the Minster (along with the Bishop of Whitby) serve as Members of Pathfinder Trust (to which AHS belongs) and the Archbishop has also appointed one of our Foundation Governors to serve as a Lay Canon on Chapter, the Governing Body of York Minster.\n\nThere are only two hundred or so Church of England secondary schools in the country, four in the Diocese of York. The other three being Manor CE Academy, All Saints\u2019 VA School, Ingleby Barwick, Middlesborough, opened as new build in 2003; and Archbishop Sentamu, Hull, which became an Academy in 2008. Indeed in April 2011 both Archbishop\u2019s and Manor converted to Academy status and All Saints and Sentamu Academy have since followed. Both Manor (HOPE) and Sentamu (SALT) have formed Multi Academy Trusts and in September 2016 Archbishop Holgate\u2019s was one of the four founding schools of Pathfinder Multi Academy Trust. Our Christian foundation, which continues to remain at the heart of all we do as an Academy, as part of a Teaching School and as part of a Multi Academy Trust, gives the school an extra dimension, an additional facet, embedding our distinctiveness. Our Church status does not provide a context for evangelising; those committed to the Christian path will, on the other hand, find many ways in which their faith can find expression through the corporate values of the school."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Robert-Holgate", "page_content": "Robert Holgate (1481/1482 \u2013 1555) was the Catholic Bishop of Llandaff and then Archbishop of York (from 1545 to 1554).

Henderson acted as chairman of the association\u2019s first meeting, which was held in Notman\u2019s studio on 11 January 1860.\n\nHenderson\u4e8e1857\u5e74\u5de6\u53f3\u5728\u8499\u7279\u5229\u5c14\u5b66\u4e60\u6444\u5f71\uff0c\u5e76\u8fc5\u901f\u5c06\u5b83\u57f9\u517b\u6210\u4e00\u9879\u8ba4\u771f\u7684\u4e1a\u4f59\u7231\u597d\u3002\u4ed6\u6210\u4e3a\u82cf\u683c\u5170\u88d4\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u6444\u5f71\u5e08William Notman\u7684\u79c1\u4eba\u597d\u53cb\u4e0e\u540c\u4e8b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u4eba\u57281860\u5e74\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u6b21\u524d\u5f80\u5c3c\u4e9a\u52a0\u62c9\u5927\u7011\u5e03\u7684\u6444\u5f71\u4e4b\u65c5\uff0c\u57281865\u5e74\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u4e00\u8d77\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5229\u7528\u9541\u7684\u71c3\u70e7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u5149\u6e90\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c5e\u4e8e\u540c\u4e00\u4e2a\u793e\u56e2\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u662f\u8499\u7279\u5229\u5c14\u827a\u672f\u534f\u4f1a\u7684\u521b\u59cb\u6210\u5458\u3002Henderson\u8fd8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5e2d\u4e3b\u6301\u4e86\u8be5\u6b47\u4f1a\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u4f1a\u8bae\u3002\u5b83\u4e8e1860\u5e741\u670811\u65e5\u5728Notman\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4\u4e2d\u4e3e\u529e\u3002\n\n\u7b2c4\u6bb5\n\nIn spite of their friendship, their styles of photography were quite different. While Notman\u2019s landscapes were noted for their bold realism, Henderson for the first 20 years of his career produced romantic images, showing the strong influence of the British landscape tradition. His artistic and technical progress was rapid and in 1865 he published his first major collection of landscape photographs. The publication had limited circulation (only seven copies have ever been found), and was called Canadian Views and Studies. The contents of each copy vary significantly and have proved a useful source for evaluating Henderson\u2019s early work.\n\n\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e24\u4eba\u53cb\u8c0a\u751a\u7b03\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6444\u5f71\u98ce\u683c\u5dee\u522b\u5f88\u5927\u3002\u867d\u7136Notman\u7684\u98ce\u666f\u7167\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u5927\u80c6\u76f4\u767d\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e3b\u4e49\u800c\u95fb\u540d\uff0c\u4f46Henderson\u5728\u5176\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6daf\u7684\u524d20\u5e74\u62cd\u7684\u5374\u662f\u6d6a\u6f2b\u4e3b\u4e49\u7167\u7247\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u82f1\u56fd\u98ce\u666f\u753b\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6d53\u539a\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4ed6\u5728\u827a\u672f\u548c\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u6b65\u5f88\u5feb\u30021865\u5e74\uff0c\u4ed6\u51fa\u7248\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u7b2c\u4e00\u5957\u98ce\u666f\u7167\u7247\u5927\u5408\u96c6\u3002\u8fd9\u5957\u518c\u5b50\u7684\u6d41\u901a\u5341\u5206\u6709\u9650\uff08\u76ee\u524d\u53ea\u53d1\u73b0\u4e867\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u53d6\u540d\u4e3a\u300a\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u98ce\u666f\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\u300b\u3002\u6bcf\u4e00\u672c\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u5dee\u522b\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30Henderson\u65e9\u671f\u4f5c\u54c1\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\n\n\u7b2c5\u6bb5\n\nIn 1866, he gave up his business to open a photographic studio, advertising himself as a portrait and landscape photographer. From about 1870 he dropped portraiture to specialize in landscape photography and other views. His numerous photographs of city life revealed in street scenes, houses, and markets are alive with human activity, and although his favourite subject was landscape he usually composed his scenes around such human pursuits as farming the land, cutting ice on a river, or sailing down a woodland stream. There was sufficient demand for these types of scenes and others he took depicting the lumber trade, steamboats and waterfalls to enable him to make a living. There was little competing hobby or amateur photography before the late 1880s because of the time-consuming techniques involved and the weight of the equipment. People wanted to buy photographs as souvenirs of a trip or as gifts, and catering to this market, Henderson had stock photographs on display at his studio for mounting, framing, or inclusion in albums.\n\n1866\u5e74\uff0c\u4ed6\u653e\u5f03\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u751f\u610f\uff0c\u5f00\u8bbe\u4e86\u4e00\u5bb6\u6444\u5f71\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u5df1\u5ba3\u4f20\u6210\u4e00\u4f4d\u4eba\u50cf\u4e0e\u98ce\u666f\u6444\u5f71\u5e08\u3002\u4ece1870\u5e74\u5de6\u53f3\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u4ed6\u820d\u5f03\u4eba\u50cf\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u62cd\u6444\u98ce\u666f\u7167\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u666f\u8c61\u7167\u3002\u4ed6\u62cd\u4e0b\u6570\u4e0d\u80dc\u6570\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u751f\u6d3b\u7167\u7247\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8857\u9053\u666f\u8c61\u3001\u623f\u5c4b\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u56e0\u4e3a\u6709\u4e86\u82b8\u82b8\u4f17\u751f\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u800c\u663e\u5f97\u5145\u6ee1\u751f\u673a\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4ed6\u6700\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u9898\u6750\u662f\u98ce\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u7ecf\u5e38\u5c06\u98ce\u666f\u56f4\u7ed5\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u6784\u56fe\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u8015\u79cd\u7530\u5730\uff0c\u6cb3\u6d41\u53d6\u51b0\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u6cbf\u6797\u4e2d\u6eaa\u6c34\u987a\u6d41\u800c\u4e0b\u3002\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u666f\u8c61\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u4ed6\u62cd\u6444\u7684\u63cf\u7ed8\u6728\u6750\u8d38\u6613\uff0c\u84b8\u6c7d\u8239\u4e0e\u7011\u5e03\u7684\u7167\u7247\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8db3\u4ee5\u4ed6\u4ee5\u6b64\u8c0b\u751f\u3002\u572819\u4e16\u7eaa80\u5e74\u4ee3\u672b\u671f\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8d39\u65f6\u7684\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u91cd\u91cf\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u7231\u597d\u6216\u8005\u4e1a\u4f59\u6444\u5f71\u4e0e\u4ed6\u7ade\u4e89\u3002\u4eba\u4eec\u60f3\u8981\u8d2d\u4e70\u7167\u7247\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65c5\u884c\u7684\u7eaa\u5ff5\u54c1\u6216\u8005\u793c\u7269\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8fce\u5408\u8fd9\u4e00\u5e02\u573a\u9700\u6c42\uff0cHenderson\u5728\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4\u5c55\u51fa\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u50a8\u5907\u7167\u7247\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f9b\u9576\u5d4c\uff0c\u52a0\u6846\u6216\u8005\u6536\u5f55\u96c6\u7ed3\u6210\u518c\u3002\n\n\u7b2c6\u6bb5\n\nHenderson frequently exhibited his photographs in Montreal and abroad, in London, Edinburgh, Dublin, Paris, New York, and Philadelphia.

He was especially fond of the wilderness and often travelled by canoe on the Blanche, du Lievre, and other noted eastern rivers. He went on several occasions to the Maritimes and in 1872 he sailed by yacht along the lower north shore of the St Lawrence River. That same year, while in the lower St Lawrence River region, he took some photographs of the construction of the Intercolonial Railway. This undertaking led in 1875 to a commission from the railway to record the principal structures along the almost-completed line connecting Montreal to Halifax. Commissions from other railways followed. In 1876 he photographed bridges on the Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa and Occidental Railway between Montreal and Ottawa. In 1885 he went west along the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) as far as Rogers Pass in British Columbia, where he took photographs of the mountains and the progress of construction.\n\n19\u4e16\u7eaa70\u5e74\u4ee3\u548c80\u5e74\u4ee3\uff0cHenderson\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6e38\u5386\u4e86\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u7684\u9b41\u5317\u514b\u548c\u5b89\u5927\u7565\u5730\u533a\uff0c\u7528\u5f71\u50cf\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0b\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u7701\u4efd\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u57ce\u5e02\u548c\u9b41\u5317\u514b\u5730\u533a\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u6751\u5e84\u3002\u4ed6\u5c24\u5176\u559c\u6b22\u65f7\u91ce\u666f\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7ecf\u5e38\u4e58\u72ec\u6728\u821f\u6cbfBlanche, du Lievre\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u8457\u540d\u7684\u4e1c\u90e8\u6cb3\u6d41\u65c5\u884c\u3002\u4ed6\u53bb\u8fc7\u51e0\u6b21Maritimes\u30021872\u5e74\uff0c\u4ed6\u4e58\u5750\u5e06\u8239\u6587\u7ae0\u6765\u81ea\u8001\u70e4\u9e2d\u96c5\u601d\u8d70\u904d\u4e86St Lawrence\u6cb3\u6cbf\u5cb8\u7684\u5317\u90e8\u4f4e\u5730\u5730\u533a\u3002\u540c\u4e00\u5e74\u5728St Lawrence\u4f4e\u5730\u5730\u533a\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u62cd\u6444\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u6b63\u5728\u5efa\u8bbe\u7684\u6b96\u6c11\u5730\u4e4b\u95f4\u94c1\u8def\u7684\u7167\u7247\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e3e\u52a8\u57281875\u5e74\u4fc3\u6210\u90a3\u5bb6\u94c1\u8def\u516c\u53f8\u59d4\u6258\u4ed6\u62cd\u6444\u8bb0\u5f55\u5f53\u65f6\u5feb\u8981\u7ae3\u5de5\u7684\u3001\u8fde\u63a5\u8499\u7279\u5229\u5c14\u548c\u54c8\u5229\u6cd5\u514b\u65af\u94c1\u8def\u6cbf\u7ebf\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5efa\u7b51\u3002\u6765\u81ea\u5176\u4ed6\u94c1\u8def\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u59d4\u6258\u63a5\u8e35\u800c\u81f3\u30021876\u5e74\uff0c\u4ed6\u62cd\u6444\u4e86\u9b41\u5317\u514b\u7ebf\u3001\u8499\u7279\u5229\u5c14\u7ebf\u3001\u6e25\u592a\u534e\u7ebf\u4ee5\u53ca\u8499\u7279\u5229\u5c14\u548c\u6e25\u592a\u534e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u897f\u6d0b\u94c1\u8def\u4e0a\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u6865\u6881\u30021885\u5e74\uff0c\u4ed6\u6cbf\u7740\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u94c1\u8def\u4e00\u76f4\u5411\u897f\uff0c\u6700\u8fdc\u5230\u8fbe\u8fc7\u4e0d\u5217\u98a0\u5c5e\u54e5\u4f26\u6bd4\u4e9a\u7684Rogers Pass\u3002\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\uff0c\u4ed6\u62cd\u6444\u4e86\u7fa4\u5c71\u548c\u6b63\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u5de5\u7a0b\u3002\n\n\u7b2c8\u6bb5\n\nIn 1892 Henderson accepted a full-time position with the CPR as manager of a photographic department which he was to set up and administer.

Robert Holgate held absolute political power in the North, running the King\u2019s Council in the North Parts from the King\u2019s Manor, raising armies to subdue the Scots, and operating with the authority of the King himself. In 1545, Henry VIII made him Archbishop of York, thereby complementing Holgate\u2019s political authority with the authority of one of the two leading roles in the Church of England, and cementing his position of absolute supremacy (second only to the King himself) in matters spiritual and temporal north of the Trent. Very soon after he was enthroned as Archbishop of York Holgate he founded a number of schools, ours included. Holgate took a close personal interest in the organisation of each school; his own signature lies at the bottom of each of the twenty-four pages of each of the three surviving copies of our school\u2019s Foundation Deed. Holgate then fell from grace politically, but remained Archbishop of York, a role he fulfilled vigorously until 1554.\n\nThe original school site, between Ogleforth and the City Walls, was on land in the shadow of York Minster owned by Holgate himself. Links between Church and School have remained strong. Indeed, the story of the school over more than four and a half centuries has been intertwined with the story of successive Archbishops of York. No school in the country has more distinguished links with the Church of England than ours, including successive Archbishops appointing Foundation Governors and themselves serving as Foundation Governors of the school. Other Foundation Governors include a senior Canon Residentiary of York Minster, and a senior representative from York St John University.\n\nThere are only two hundred or so Church of England secondary schools in the country, four in the Diocese of York. The other three being Manor CE Academy, All Saints\u2019 VA School, Ingleby Barwick, Middlesborough, opened as new build in 2003; and Archbishop Sentamu, Hull, which became an Academy in 2008. Indeed in April 2011 both Archbishop\u2019s and Manor converted to Academy status and All Saints and Sentamu Academy have since followed. Both Manor (HOPE) and Sentamu (SALT) have formed Multi Academy Trusts and in September 2016 Archbishop Holgate\u2019s was one of the four founding schools of Pathfinder Multi Academy Trust. Our Christian foundation, which continues to remain at the heart of all we do as an Academy, as part of a Teaching School and as part of a Multi Academy Trust, gives the school an extra dimension, an additional facet, embedding our distinctiveness. Our Church status does not provide a context for evangelising; those committed to the Christian path will, on the other hand, find many ways in which their faith can find expression through the corporate values of the school."}, {"url": "https://yorkcivictrust.co.uk/heritage/civic-trust-plaques/archbishop-holgates-grammar-school-playing-field-gates/", "page_content": "Archbishop Holgate\u2019s Grammar School Playing Field Gates\n\nPlaque on the restored gates in Bridge Lane, off the Wigginton Road, near York Hospital, YO31 8HE\n\nRobert Holgate (c.1481-1555), founder of Archbishop Holgate\u2019s Grammar School, was Archbishop of York and President of the King\u2019s Council in the North. His career was typical of the Tudor century with its flowing and ebbing tides of popularity and power under a succession of monarchs: Henry VIII, Edward VI and Mary I. He rose to high office in both church and state as did his predecessor, Thomas Wolsey, in the See of York, only to fall with sudden finality under Mary I. Robert married in 1550, aged 68, scandalising the conservative northern clergy. Although a court case during Edward\u2019s reign upheld his marriage, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London under Mary I on a charge \u201cfor divers offences\u201d but especially for entering into a marriage after a vow of chastity. Deprived of office, he apologised to the Queen, offering the payment of \u00a31,000 and was released in 1555 with a huge fine. Ten months later he died.\n\nGrammar school founded\n\nIn 1546, with the authority of Henry VIII, the Archbishop founded three schools \u201cfree and perpetual\u201d in York, Hemsworth and Old Malton. He bought the Treasurer\u2019s House and other property in Minster Close and established a school and master\u2019s house in Ogleforth \u201cclose by the cathedral\u201d. The early grammar schools in England were established to train students for the clergy and the curriculum comprised Latin, Greek and Hebrew with some history, geography and mathematics, but the emphasis was on religious and moral education based on the Bible. Discipline was severe and hours were long with few holidays.\n\nAn advertisement in the York Courant of December 1799 states that \u201cNotice is hereby given That the Free Grammar School situate within the Close of the Cathedral Church of York, founded by Archbishop Holgate, for the Instruction of Youth in the knowledge and understanding of the Latin Tongue and Grammar, will open again after the Christmas recess on Monday, January 20th 1800\u201d. During the early part of the 19th century, grammar schools throughout the country were at a very low ebb as they had not adapted the curriculum to meet the educational needs of the sons of aristocrats and those of the rapidly expanding professional classes. Archbishop Holgate\u2019s school was no exception; scholars numbered only 10 in 1818 and 17 in 1824. However, the fortunes of the school saw an improvement with the move to the Yeoman School at St John\u2019s College.\n\nMove to new premises\n\nThe York Diocesan School Society had moved in 1845-6 from Monkgate to a new site on Lord Mayor\u2019s Walk where a new training college had been constructed in impressive buildings by George Townsend Andrews (1804-55), the \u201crailway architect\u201d who had built the first York station within the city walls plus many other stations and associated buildings. The Yeoman School, built next to the college on the same site, was opened in 1846 to cater for the \u201cmiddle-class children\u201d of agriculturalists and as a practising school for St John\u2019s teacher-training students. But the Yeoman School began to experience financial difficulties and an agreement was made for Archbishop Holgate\u2019s School to take over the school from 1858 to which it moved after more than 300 years in Ogleforth. The school began to flourish in its new home under the headship of The Revd. Robert Daniel. In 1828, there were 18-28 day boys and 38-48 boarders. By 1874 there were 45 day boys and by 1875 105 boarders. However, following the death of Daniel in 1882, the school experienced a period of decline.\n\nThe school\u2019s fortunes were turned around by the appointment of The Revd. William Johnson who was headmaster from 1896 to 1915. In 1907 there were more than 200 pupils and by 1915 when Johnson retired the roll had risen to 294. In the late nineteenth century, the playing of sports such as rugby football and cricket had been introduced and a request was made to use Bootham Stray as playing fields. William was a great supporter of rugby and a cricketer himself and the school excelled at games during his headship. In 1909, part of Bootham Stray was formally leased for playing fields.\n\nWalker Iron Foundry\n\nGeorge Townsend Andrews, the architect who designed St John\u2019s College and the school later to be taken over by Archbishop Holgate\u2019s on Lord Mayor\u2019s Walk, had a long association with the Walker Iron Foundry on Walmgate in York. John Walker (1801-1853) was originally an apprentice, then partner, at Gibson\u2019s foundry at 33 Walmgate, York which he had bought by 1837. The construction of St Leonard\u2019s Place in the 1830s provided work for the Gibson-Walker partnership and the railings, balconies and stair balustrades here are the largest surviving work showing the excellence of their craftsmanship. John Walker built up a prestigious clientele and the firm cast the gates for the Queen\u2019s gardens at Kew after which the Royal Coat of Arms appeared on some of the foundry\u2019s work. Shortly after, the foundry, now known as Victoria Foundry, moved to 76 Walmgate. In 1851, the foundry was awarded its largest order: the railings and gates for the British Museum. John was succeeded by his son William Walker (1828-1911).\n\nA natural outlet for the products of the foundry during the 1840s was the ever-expanding railway system which George Townsend Andrews took a major part in designing in his association with George Hudson. John Walker is known to have been involved in this work, one of his advertisements calling him a railway coach builder. He produced railings, gates and balustrades at the railway station in York designed by Andrews for George Hudson. Many other examples of Walker\u2019s iron foundry work were commissioned in York including staircase balustrades at the De Grey rooms, St Peter\u2019s School, York City & County Bank, the Bar Convent and the County Hospital, and railings and gates at St Leonard\u2019s Place, York Cemetery, Dean\u2019s Park, St Peter\u2019s, Mill Mount House (now school), The Mount, the old railway station and hotel, Unitarian Chapel, and St Saviourgate, to name but a few. The gates to Archbishop Holgate\u2019s School playing fields, 1850-60, are marked \u201cJohn Walker, York\u201d and are in the style of many produced by the foundry to be found in the firm\u2019s pattern books. That these gates would become those of the playing fields to Archbishop Holgate\u2019s Grammar School at St John\u2019s College on Lord Mayor\u2019s Walk built by the railway architect George Townsend Andrews is testament to the interlocking lives of skilled craftsmen in York in the 19th century.\n\nIn 1963 Archbishop Holgate\u2019s School moved to its present site on Hull Road in York. The school is now a coeducational Church of England secondary school and sixth form with academy status.\n\nInformation on the restoration project.\n\nSources\n\nE.N Jewels, A History of Archbishop Holgate\u2019s Grammar School, York, 1546-1946, (York, 1963)\n\nJohn Malden, The Walker Iron Foundry, York, c.1825-1923, (York Historian, Vol.1, 1976).\n\nG.P.
