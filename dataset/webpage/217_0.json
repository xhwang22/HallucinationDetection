Sir John is a trustee of the National History Museum.\n\nSkills\n\nWhat are the skills we need to be teaching our children?\n\n100 years is a very long time, and we can\u2019t possibly predict what the world will be like in 2116, so we have to resort to saying what do we think our youngsters will need for the future. Of course that includes a lot of things such as the ability to communicate in mother tongue languages, mathematics, but it also includes a whole set of softer skills, or we should say high order skills, about interaction with other people.\n\nIn 100 years time, our daily lives will definitely involve interaction with other people. I think we need to get a much better understanding of those high order skills, things like teamwork, communication, working with others and leadership. We need to understand how people develop those skills and how we can measure them.\n\nTeachers\n\nWhat is the role of the teacher?\n\nWe will still have teachers in 100 years time and I think the teacher is absolutely critical. For many years we have been predicting the disappearance of the teacher. For instance, in 1913 Thomas Edison said: \u2018Soon teachers will not be necessary, because children will be taught entirely through motion pictures.\u2019 This was at the dawn of the movie age and of course that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThere is something about the transaction and interaction between humans that is central to the life of all humans and to the way people learn. I\u2019m absolutely convinced that individual teachers will still be at the heart of the educational process. Therefore, they are right at the center of making education as good as we can possibly make it. We need to make sure that they are highly skilled, that very highly qualified people come into education, that they are well trained and have good continued training, and that they are also highly respected and trusted.\n\nI have seen schools in Finland and one of the things I\u2019m struck by is the trust adults, the community, and parents put in teachers to make the right judgements. We need more of that across the world.\n\nAssessment\n\nDo you think standardized testing is an effective way to assess learning?\n\nIt depends what you\u2019re testing and we have to test at some point throughout young people\u2019s education experience. The parents expect it, the public expects it and it\u2019s a way to hold the whole system to account, certainly in the United Kingdom. I know countries where there is less emphasis on it.\n\nSo I don\u2019t think testing in itself is the wrong thing, but I think we have to think very carefully about what we test. The big danger is, and I think this was attributed to Einstein, is that not everything that counts can be counted and not everything that can be counted counts. In other words, it\u2019s actually quite easy to measure some things and to get very robust results from them - a straightforward record of facts, easy to measure, reliable results. But these aren\u2019t necessarily the things that matter, so I think we have to think very carefully about what we are testing.\n\nI am very excited about the potential of digital technologies making testing much more sophisticated. We do need to test some basic knowledge, but we also need to test high level thinking skills, the ability to reason, solve problems and the ability to work with other people and to show leadership and teamwork - some of those skills that I was referring to before.\n\nI think one of the things we will see happening over the next 100 years is a better ability to measure higher level skills that lead to high employability, and that this will probably happen through digital methods.\n\nEnvironments\n\nWhat would be the most exciting learning environment?\n\nI think people young and old learn by doing things, and so I would always want them to be in an environment where they can learn by doing, hands-on. As the virtual world becomes more and more powerful and realistic and we can enter through the virtual simulated world, I think the real world becomes more important. As people realize there is a virtual world out there that can give them anything, for example we can all go to the moon in a simulation, the real world becomes more important by contrast.\n\nFor example, at the National History Museum where I am a trustee, we are going through a process where we make sure that everything that people see is authentic - real fossils, real meteorites, and I think that authenticity of the experience is going to become more important.\n\nSo my ideal learning environment is where people can learn by doing. As a science specialist, my ideal environment is a highly equipped laboratory with all the facilities needed to carry out experiments at any point in any lesson that the teacher wants to. Or a highly equipped field station where people can go out into the natural world and learn about the natural world by doing and experiencing it.\n\nPersonal memory\n\nWhat was your favorite moment in your own education?\n\nI am a chemist and I studied chemistry at university. I had a very good chemistry teacher who was rather tough. He wasn\u2019t a wild enthusiast who was always making jokes, he was very serious, but he was brilliant at giving you problems that would stretch you. My most memorable experience was when I was around sixteen, he gave me an orange powder and said: \u2018find out everything about that,\u2019 and didn\u2019t give me any help leaving me to my own devices. I had to go make tests on it, add other chemicals to it, analyze it and in the end I nearly found out what it was and we had a really good discussion about it.\n\nI felt that it was such a journey of discovery. I was doing experiments, it was hands-on, new things and revelations were happening, I was going down blind tracks and coming back up again and I was using books. So It was a great journey of discovery so that was very memorable.\n\nI also had a very good English teacher and I love English literature. I had a very early introduction to poetry, because my mother, who was an English graduate, loved poetry and had a prodigious memory for poetry. She would walk around the house speaking poetry and so I learned a lot of poetry just by listening unconsciously.\n\nI can remember talking about the Lady of Shalott in a lesson, I had all the words in my head but it was my teacher who told me what they meant. Together we talked about why some words, when you put them together, mean more than their literal meaning, which is, of course, what poetry is. That was the lesson in which my home experience with my beloved mother and my school experience came together, and it was that coming together that was very revelatory. I loved poetry before and ever since.\n\nThe next 100 years\n\nThe next 100 years of Finnish education should\u2026 continue to do the things that Finland already does well. I don\u2019t think we can assume, that because something good is happening now, it will always happen. There are pressures such as economic pressures and technological pressures.\n\nThe thing that Finland does well, for me, is the contract that they have between the public and the schools. Education is very notably the Finnish national project. It\u2019s what they do absolutely brilliantly. Lying behind that is the trust between schools, parents and school principals, which is important to keep.\n\nSo the next 100 years of Finnish education must keep doing the things that they do so well, but it must also come to terms with the astonishing development of technology - and heaven knows what that will bring to us. I think there will be pressures to replace teachers and I think there is a very important job to be done reconciling the role of the teacher with the role of technology. Also, resisting economic pressures which will drive people towards replacing the teacher with technology, because it\u2019s cheaper that way and even in Finland it could happen.\n\nWe\u2019ve all got big challenges in understanding the role of technology in education and I think, as I\u2019ve said before, we need to look for the big positives that technology can bring to education such as more subtle assessment of the things that really matter to parents and to their children\u2019s futures. That isn\u2019t just about the things we normally assess now, so I think we\u2019ll see very powerful development in how we use computers for that.\n\nI think in the next 100 years in Finland, and everywhere else, we\u2019ll have a very fast growing understanding of how the brain works. Our understanding of neuroscience is in its infancy at the moment, but it\u2019s a very powerful and active field, and a lot of that is going to be relevant to education. We don\u2019t know what it is, but we need to resist fashions and believing myths that don\u2019t have any evidence in them, but rather be rigorously evidence-based. If we follow the evidence in schools, as neuroscientists understand more and more about how the brain works and how we learn, we will be able to take this understanding and improve the way that we teach young people.\n\nFor example, we are now beginning to learn things about the structure of the school day, about teenager\u2019s circadian rhythms and their optimum, about the optimum way of sequencing learning between initial learning and reinforcement, all these things to inspire positive learning. In the next 100 years we will understand a great deal more and be able to structure the school day more intelligently.\n\nThere will be many other things we will learn from neuroscience in the future that we must all embrace."}, {"url": "https://www.york.ac.uk/chemistry/news/deptnews/sir-john-holman/", "page_content": "Professor Sir John Holman gives final lecture\n\nPosted on 29 November 2017\n\nAfter many years of inspiring our undergraduates in Physical Chemistry, Professor Sir John Holman gave his final lecture to our second year students.\n\nHe has taught for some 50 years across a wide range of age groups in both schools and universities.

His final lecture was an ideal opportunity for our students and staff to thank John for his many contributions to the department.\n\nTo celebrate his achievements, including his passion for using contextual demonstrations in lectures, our talented technical colleagues, Abby Mortimer, Tim Ayers and Mark Roper, made John a stunning model of a train. This idea was suggested by our students as a tribute to one of his memorable demonstrations.\n\nMany of John's other demonstrations, including those involving liquid nitrogen, ice cream, jelly babies, balloons and fountains, will be remembered by staff and hundreds of our former undergraduates, as will John\u2019s passion and enthusiasm for teaching chemistry."}, {"url": "https://global.oup.com/ukhe/product/chemistry-9780198829980", "page_content": "Questions at the end of each chapter encourage students to cement what they have learnt, and challenge them to go further in their thinking around the topic.\n\nIts carefully-layered approach builds on students' prior knowledge to bridge the gap between school and university-level chemistry, providing them with a firm understanding of the fundamental principles on which they can build later studies.\n\nChemistry\u00b3 establishes the fundamental principles of all three strands of chemistry; organic, inorganic and physical. Using carefully-worded explanations, annotated diagrams and worked examples, it builds on what students have learned at school to present an approachable introduction to chemistry and its relevance to everyday life.\n\nAbout the Author(s)\n\nAndrew Burrows, Head of Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, John Holman, Emeritus Professor in the Chemistry Department, University of York, Simon Lancaster, Professor of Chemistry Education, University of East Anglia, Tina Overton, Director, Leeds Institute of Teaching Excellence, University of Leeds, Andrew Parsons, Professor of Chemistry, University of York, Gwen Pilling, Formerly of the Science Education Group, University of York, and Gareth Price, Chair of Department of Chemistry, Khalifa University\n\nAndrew Burrows is Professor of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Bath.

Schuster, New York University"}, {"url": "https://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/about-journals/organic-chemistry-frontiers/", "page_content": "Research articles\n\nAll original research work published in Organic Chemistry Frontiers is in one Research article format. Both Communication type articles and Full paper type articles can be published under this format. Although there is no formal page limit, authors should report their work in a succinct way. Lengthy introductions, extensive data, excessive experimental details and non-experiment based conjecture should not be included in the main text.\n\nAuthors are encouraged to include a brief experimental section containing key and representative experimental procedures in the main text. Additional repeated information and characterization data should be included in the electronic supplementary information by citing the typical or general procedure in the main text.\n\nAuthors are encouraged to use the article templates from the Royal Society of Chemistry website to prepare Research articles. However, the use of the template for submission is not essential.\n\nReviews\n\nCritical reviews\n\nReviews provide a critical and in-depth discussion of a particularly relevant or interesting topic in organic chemistry. They aim to provide the reader with an authoritative, balanced and up-to-date overview, not a comprehensive list of all possible references. Authors should aim to identify areas in the field where further developments are needed. Critical reviews do not describe any unpublished results.\n\nCritical reviews are normally invited by the editorial board or the editorial office of Organic Chemistry Frontiers; however, direct submissions from authors are also welcome. All reviews undergo rigorous and full peer review and must meet the high standard of the journal to be accepted for publication.\n\nHighlights\n\nHighlights are short, easy-to-read articles that focus on important new developments in the field of organic chemistry. They highlight and provide insight into the significance of the chosen topic, as well as speculating on the future potential and challenges of that field. Highlights are generally four-five journal pages in length, and new results should not be presented.\n\nHighlights are generally contributed by leading experts in organic chemistry, discussing the state of the art and prospects for significant progress in a specific subject area. Direct submissions from authors are also welcome. All Highlights are subject to a rigorous and full peer review procedure.\n\nTutorial accounts\n\nTutorial accounts describe recently established methodologies or protocols that lead to new compounds, chemistry or theories with wide and strong interest in the field of organic chemistry. The authors should provide a concise and practical account of their previously established methodologies, chemistry or theories and instruct the readers on how to reproduce those reactions on larger scales if synthetically related. At least one of the described reactions in a Tutorial account should be at the level of 10 mmol. Reactions on a scale of 10 grams are strongly encouraged.\n\nIt is recommended that a comprehensive graphic demonstration is presented at the beginning of a Tutorial account to provide an overview of the reported chemistry. Suggestions or comments concerning optimal conditions for reactions, purification of reagents, etc, are welcome in the main text. Further uses and advances in the chemistry reported since the original publication should be discussed. Experimental details of the key and representative reactions should be included.\n\nTutorial accounts should be as succinct as possible. It is expected that the articles will be three journal pages in length and contain up to four graphics. Authors are encouraged to use well-designed graphics to provide information in a concise and easy-to-read format. Any unusual apparatus involved in the experiments should be described using both text and photos. Special techniques and hazards associated with the experimental procedure must be clearly indicated.\n\nTutorial accounts are invited by the editor-in-chief of Organic Chemistry Frontiers. All Tutorial accounts are subject to full peer review and must meet the high standards of the journal for publication.\n\nMethods\n\nA Method is a different article type from the current Tutorial account, being technical notes that focus on the practicality of previously published methodologies. Use of unpublished results should be extremely limited. Methodologies in the field of synthetic organic chemistry, natural products purification, spectroscopy, chemical modification and assembly of organic molecules are encouraged as this article type.\n\nReported methods should be of wide application in the relevant research field and of general interest to the broad readership in related areas. A brief introduction is thus required for the associate editor or referees to judge the importance of very original methods or the significant advantages of the reported methods over competing or earlier protocols.\n\nMethods are designed to assist with practical manipulation. Therefore every aspect of the experiments should be explained explicitly. Authors should include the following details in the paper:\n\nApparatus\n\nThe author should indicate the types of glassware and how they are equipped. The types and parameters of any equipment (for example, microwave reactor, glove box, mass spectrometer, etc) should also be listed when they are able to affect the reproducibility of the reactions. A photo of the complete apparatus should be provided.\n\nReagents\n\nFor any commercially available reagent, authors should indicate the purchase source and CAS number. If there is any purification or activation procedure employed, this should also be clarified.\n\nReaction & manipulation\n\nAuthors should give as many details as possible when describing a reaction process. The required information includes but is not limited to the following.\n\nDuration, pressure and temperature\n\nSensitivity to air or moisture\n\nThe amount and order of addition of reactants\n\nAny phenomena observed during the reaction (such as change of color, temperature, the evolution of gases, etc.)\n\nThe monitoring process (for example, if the reaction is monitored via TLC, the Rf and the corresponding solvent system; these should be indicated for products, reactants and significant byproducts or intermediates)\n\nThe workup procedure\n\nPurification & characterisation\n\nAuthors should indicate how the products and significant byproducts are isolated, as well as their physical properties and spectroscopic data (NMR, IR, mass and UV if applicable) and X-ray structures. For the sake of accuracy, the given yield (\u00b13%), as well as other characterisation data, should be reproduced by chemists in the same group and submitted as electronic supporting information.\n\nNote: Authors are not required to include very long discussions in Methods; succinct and straightforward instructions and troubleshooting of experimental procedures are favored and can be included as notes. Authors should mark in the main text where a note is employed. Relevant notes will be placed close to where they are first mentioned. In this section, authors are expected to include any supplementary explanations that do not fit into the introduction and experimental part. For instance, when a reagent is added at an extremely slow speed or in excess, authors should explain why such a procedure is favored and how it will affect the reaction.\n\nElectronic supplementary information\n\nAuthors are required to complete the characterization checklist upon submission of supporting materials. Please note that it is a must to include copies of NMR spectra for any desired compound.\n\nPhotos & videos\n\nPhotos of the reactor should be submitted. Inclusion of videos is also strongly encouraged to record the manipulation and any change of appearance of the reactions. These should be supplied as electronic supplementary information (ESI).\n\nChemistry frontiers\n\nChemistry frontiers are concise, peer-reviewed, forward-looking articles published upon invitation from the editorial office. Authors of Chemistry frontiers will be leading scientists in their research fields. Current hot topics of great interest to the community should be discussed, and personal viewpoints looking forward to the future of the respective research fields are encouraged.\n\nChemistry frontiers can be speculative and controversial in nature. Some new unpublished results may be included but the amount should be minimized. The suggested length is fewer than four journal pages.\n\nProfiles\n\nProfiles are one- or two-page interviews of top-tier chemists. Videos will also be included where appropriate and will be published as electronic supplementary information. From these articles, readers will learn about the academic career and the most important scientific contribution (in the form of well-designed chemical equations/schemes) of the interviewees, as well as some background information about their personal life.\n\nComments\n\nComments and Replies are a medium for the discussion and exchange of scientific opinions between authors and readers concerning material published in Organic Chemistry Frontiers.\n\nFor publication, a Comment should present an alternative analysis of and/or new insight into the previously published material. Any Reply should further the discussion presented in the original article and the Comment. Comments and Replies that contain any form of personal attack are not suitable for publication.\n\nComments that are acceptable for publication will be forwarded to the authors of the work being discussed, and these authors will be given the opportunity to submit a Reply. The Comment and Reply will both be subject to rigorous peer review in consultation with the journal\u2019s Editorial Board where appropriate. The Comment and Reply will be published together."}, {"url": "https://www.rsc.org/prizes-funding/prizes/find-a-prize", "page_content": "Longstaff Prize\n\nThe Longstaff Prize is given to an RSC member who has done the most to advance the science of chemistry.\n\n\u2192 Find out more"}, {"url": "https://www.rsc.org/prizes-funding/prizes/find-a-prize/organic-division-horizon-prizes/", "page_content": "Guidelines for nominators\n\nNominations open 18 October.\n\nNominations close 18 January, 17:00 GMT.\n\nOnly RSC members can nominate for these prizes.\n\nfor these prizes.

Yet, for many students entering college, gaining a firm grounding in chemistry is a real challenge. Chemistry3 responds to this challenge, providing students with a full understanding of the fundamental principles of chemistry on which to build later studies.\n\nUnique among the introductory chemistry texts currently available, Chemistry3 is written by a team of chemists to give equal coverage of organic, inorganic and physical chemistry - coverage that is uniformly authoritative. The approach to organic chemistry is mechanistic, rather than the old-fashioned 'functional group' approach, to help students achieve a fuller understanding of the underlying principles.\n\nThe expertise of the author team is completed by two specialists in chemistry education, who bring to the book a wealth of experience of teaching chemistry in a way that students enjoy and understand. The result is a text that builds on what students know already from school and tackles their misunderstandings and misconceptions, thereby providing a seamless transition from school to undergraduate study.\n\nThe authors achieve unrivalled accessibility through the provision of carefully-worded explanations and reminders of students' existing knowledge; the introduction of concepts in a logical and progressive manner; and the use of annotated diagrams and step-by-step worked examples. Students are encouraged to engage with the text and appreciate the central role that chemistry plays in our lives through the unique use of real-world context and photographs.\n\nChemistry3 tackles head-on two issues pervading chemistry education: the students' mathematical skills, and their ability to see the subject as a single, unified discipline. Instead of avoiding math, Chemistry3 provides structured support, in the form of careful explanations, reminders of key mathematical concepts, step-by-step calculations in worked examples, and a Math Toolkit, to help students get to grips with the essential mathematical element of chemistry. Frequent cross-references highlight the connections between each strand of chemistry and explain the relationship between the topics, so students can develop an understanding of the subject as a whole.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/about-journals/pccp/", "page_content": "Communications\n\nThese are urgent reports of highly original and significant work likely to have a high impact on the community and of such importance that rapid publication is justified.\n\nCommunications are given priority treatment, are fast-tracked through the publication process and appear prominently at the front of the journal in a dedicated Communications section.\n\nAt the time of submission authors should supply a short statement justifying why the work merits urgent publication as a Communication. Reviewers will be asked to judge the work on these grounds.\n\nIt is recommended that Communications do not exceed four printed journal pages, authors may find the Communications template useful for preparing their submissions.\n\nSection headings, lengthy introductions and discussion, extensive data, and excessive experimental details should not be included. Figures and tables should be essential to understanding the paper. The experimental evidence necessary to support a Communication should be supplied for the referees and eventual publication as electronic supplementary information (ESI).\n\nFull papers\n\nFull papers contain original scientific work that has not been published previously. They must demonstrate significant new insight into physical chemistry; this is the prime criterion that reviewers and the Editors will judge against when evaluating submissions.\n\nFull papers based on Communications are encouraged provided that they represent a substantial extension of the original material. There are no restrictions on the length of a paper. Authors should include a brief discussion in the Introduction that sets the context for the new work and gives their motivation for carrying out the study.\n\nReviews\n\nConcise and critical reviews of important or emerging topics in physical chemistry, chemical physics and biophysical chemistry. Reviews should be easy to read and cover current areas of interest, rather than comprehensive reviews of the literature, and may include a limited amount of unpublished research.\n\nTutorial Reviews\n\nTutorial reviews provide an essential introduction to a particular area of physical chemistry, chemical physics or biophysical chemistry. The article should have particular appeal to early career researchers, as well as established researchers seeking new fields to explore. Tutorial reviews may include a limited amount of unpublished research.\n\nPerspectives\n\nPerspectives are high profile articles that present an authoritative state-of-the-art account of the selected research field. PCCP Perspectives take a wide variety of forms including personal accounts of research and critical analyses of topics of current interest.\n\nPerspective articles should provide critical evaluation, placing any personal work in the context of the wider literature. Simple literature surveys will not be accepted for publication. Some new unpublished research may be included.\n\nThere are no strict length requirements, but as a general guide Perspectives and Reviews are typically between 6 - 20 pages in length, whilst some Tutorial Reviews are more in-depth. Shorter Perspective articles of 3 - 4 journal pages highlighting a topical area or important new development in an established field will also be considered.\n\nPerspectives, Reviews and Tutorial Reviews are commissioned by the PCCP Editorial Board and Editorial Office and we welcome suggestions of topics and authors. We also welcome direct submissions. Enquiries regarding the submission of these article types should be directed to the Editor.\n\nAll Review-type articles undergo full and rigorous peer review, in the same way as regular PCCP research papers.\n\nComments\n\nComments and Replies are a medium for the discussion and exchange of scientific opinions between authors and readers concerning material published in PCCP.\n\nFor publication, a Comment should present an alternative analysis of and/or new insight into the previously published material. Any Reply should further the discussion presented in the original article and the Comment. Comments and Replies that contain any form of personal attack are not suitable for publication.\n\nComments that are acceptable for publication will be forwarded to the authors of the work being discussed, and these authors will be given the opportunity to submit a Reply. The Comment and Reply will both be subject to rigorous peer review in consultation with the journal\u2019s Editorial Board where appropriate. The Comment and Reply will be published together."}, {"url": "https://theconversation.com/profiles/john-holman-109818", "page_content": "Sir John Holman is Emeritus Professor in the Chemistry Department, University of York, UK and adviser in Education at the Wellcome Trust and the Gatsby Foundation.
