Koscielny played as a fullback for Guingamp in most of the matches.However, he felt that center back was his forte and this made him join Tours FC to take a chance at center back.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his debut season with Tours FC in 2007, Koscielny showed remarkable progress and played a major role in his team\u2019s promotion to Ligue 1. He was also named in the best XI of the season.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center back continued his good form with Lorient FC in 2009 where he was regarded as one of the best players in his position. He was developing reputation as a clever and an agile defender. His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\n\n\n\n\nDebut\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurent Koscielny had the opportunity to represent Poland but decided to ply his trade with France. He made his first appearance for France on the 9th of February, 2011 in a friendly match against United States. Koscielny played the entire game and his side sealed a 1-0 victory. On the 4th of June, 2016, Koscielny scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland.\n\n\n\n\n\nRise to Glory\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny had a great debut season with Arsenal.

This has forced him out of a few crucial encounters and has affected the team\u2019s performance. He has missed more games due to suspension and not because of injury.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center back must work on preventing harsh tackles so as to represent Arsenal in more and more games and increase their chances of winning more trophies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman is yet to win the Premier League with Arsenal.

He is vice-captain of Arsenal.\n\nBorn in Tulle, Koscielny began his football career playing for a host of youth clubs before moving to Guingamp in 2003, where he quickly progressed through the youth ranks, making his professional debut the following season. After becoming frustrated at being played out of position as a right back, he joined Tours for an undisclosed fee, quickly establishing himself as the team\u2019s star player in his desired position, ultimately aiding in the club\u2019s promotion into Ligue 1, while also being named in the Ligue 2 Team of the Season.[3] Koscielny continued his impressive performances following a \u20ac1.7 million transfer to fellow French outfit Lorient in 2009, receiving multiple plaudits for his performances, largely cultivating a reputation as a clever, agile, ball-playing defender.[3] His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\nFollowing his arrival to England, Koscielny has widely been regarded to be one of the best players in his position, as well as one of the best in the world.[4][5] He has since established himself as a core component in the Arsenal first team, as well as contributing with a host of individual performances, including aiding in ending the club\u2019s nine-year trophy drought, scoring a crucial equalizer en route to winning the FA Cup in 2014. He was also crucial in further club successes that followed, winning another two FA Cups and the FA Community Shield on three occasions.\n\nDespite having the ability to represent Poland, Koscielny instead decided to represent France, and first appeared up for the national team against Brazil in February 2011.[6] Koscielny has since become a regular starter for the nation in every major tournament that they have appeared in, including UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, while also leading France to the final of UEFA Euro 2016. He scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland in 2016,[7] and has since amassed forty-nine appearances for the national side.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Koscielny announced that he would be retiring from international football after the competition, and thus no longer be playing for France.\n\nKoscielny was born in Tulle, Corr\u00e8ze. His career began in 2004 with Guingamp, a team that had produced such talents as Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Three years later, Koscielny was forced to take stock and drop down to the French third tier. He made 47 appearances for Guingamp, between 2004 and 2007, mostly as a right fullback.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2007, Koscielny joined Tours FC, deciding that he wanted a chance at centre back. He showed remarkable improvement in aerial ability and positional awareness that limited him to just three yellow cards. During the 2008\u201309 season, Koscielny made 34 Ligue 2 appearances, scoring 5 goals from defence, and was named in the division\u2019s best XI at the end of the season.\n\nArsenal confirmed the signing on 7 July 2010 and Koscielny was handed the club\u2019s number 6 shirt, previously worn by Philippe Senderos, who had moved to Fulham earlier in the summer. Wenger explained he bought Koscielny due to the fact he added height to the team and Arsenal were low on centre backs.[10] Koscielny made his debut against Barnet in a pre-season friendly in July 2010. One month later in his competitive debut against Liverpool at Anfield, he was sent off in the 94th minute for a second bookable offence. Both of his yellow cards were shown beyond 90 minutes. The game ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both teams having debut players sent off.[11] He scored his first goal for Arsenal on 11 September 2010, in a 4\u20131 win against Bolton Wanderers.[12]\n\nKoscielny made his debut in European competition on 15 September 2010, when he partnered S\u00e9bastien Squillaci in a 6\u20130 win over Braga at the Emirates Stadium.

On 1 February, he scored his third goal of the season, which proved to be the winner in a 2\u20131 turn around victory over Everton. Koscielny had arguably his best performance to date for Arsenal in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16 match against Barcelona. The match ended in a 2\u20131 home win for Arsenal.

The goal was header from a free-kick in first half stoppage time against Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium.[29] After sustaining an achilles tendon injury during the October international break, Koscielny was absent from the Arsenal team for seven weeks.[30] On 29 November, he returned to Arsenal\u2019s starting line-up alongside Per Mertesacker in central defence, as the Gunners kept a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns.[31] In the team\u2019s following fixture at home to Southampton, Koscielny helped Arsenal to record a second consecutive clean sheet and 1\u20130 win.[32]\n\nOn 11 January 2015, Koscielny scored the first goal in a 3\u20130 win over Stoke City.[33] On 18 January, he started in central defence as Arsenal shut out defending champions Manchester City to win 2\u20130 at the City of Manchester Stadium.[34] On 10 February, he scored the opening goal as Arsenal defeated Leicester City 2\u20131.[35] On 30 May 2015, Koscielny was selected to start in the 2015 FA Cup Final, playing the full 90 minutes in a 4\u20130 defeat of Aston Villa at Wembley Stadium.[36]\n\n2015\u201316 season\n\nKoscielny started every game in the first month of the season, excluding a 0\u20130 draw with rivals Liverpool at Emirates Stadium,[37] due to an injury.

Koscielny played as a fullback for Guingamp in most of the matches.However, he felt that center back was his forte and this made him join Tours FC to take a chance at center back.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his debut season with Tours FC in 2007, Koscielny showed remarkable progress and played a major role in his team\u2019s promotion to Ligue 1.

He made his first appearance for France on the 9th of February, 2011 in a friendly match against United States. Koscielny played the entire game and his side sealed a 1-0 victory. On the 4th of June, 2016, Koscielny scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland.\n\n\n\n\n\nRise to Glory\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny had a great debut season with Arsenal.

Koscielny is the vice-captain of Arsenal. He has been described as a clever, agile and ball-playing defender.\n\nKoscielny was born in the city of Tulle and began his football career playing for a host of amateur and youth clubs such as Brive, Tulle Corr\u00e8ze and Limoges. In 2003, he moved to Guingamp, where he made his professional debut the following year. Koscielny joined Tours for an undisclosed fee to play in the third tier of the French league in 2007 and enjoyed promotion with his new side before being named in the Ligue 2 Team of the Season the following campaign. In 2009, newly promoted Ligue 1 side Lorient signed Koscielny for around \u20ac1.7 million, and his performances caught the eye of Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who signed him in 2010. Since then, he is regarded as one of the best players in his position in the Premier League.\n\nKoscielny was first called up to the French national team on 4 February 2011 and has since represented the country at UEFA Euro 2012, UEFA Euro 2016, and at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Prior to his call-up for France, he was also eligible to play for Poland, as a result of his family roots.\n\nClub career\n\nEarly career\n\nKoscielny was born in Tulle, Corr\u00e8ze. His career began in 2004 with Guingamp, a team that had produced such talents as Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Three years later, Koscielny was forced to take stock and drop down to the French third tier. He made 47 appearances for Guingamp, between 2004 and 2007, mostly as a right fullback.\n\nIn 2007, Koscielny joined Tours FC, deciding that he wanted a chance at centre back. He showed remarkable improvement in aerial ability and positional awareness that limited him to just three yellow cards. During the 2008\u201309 season, Koscielny made 34 Ligue 2 appearances, scoring 5 goals from defence, and was named in the division's best XI at the end of the season.\n\nLorient\n\nOn 16 June 2009, newly promoted Ligue 1 side FC Lorient signed Koscielny on a four-year contract for around \u20ac1.7 million.

However, he received a red card 15 minutes later for a foul in the penalty area against his future Arsenal teammate Marouane Chamakh.

An impressive season culminated in reports from French daily Ouest-France that the defender was training with the Arsenal reserves ahead of an official announcement. On 6 July 2010, Koscielny agreed personal terms with Arsenal. Arsenal's initial offer for Koscielny was believed to be in the region of \u00a34 million, while they were then prepared to do a deal that would also involve youngster Francis Coquelin moving on loan in the opposite direction, which Lorient rejected. During the summer transfer window of 2010 reports began to emerge in late June that a deal had been reached to bring Koscielny to Arsenal for a reported sum of \u00a38.45 million.\n\nArsenal\n\n2010\u201311 season\n\n\"I don't believe any French player would have refused to come and play for Arsenal.

He is vice-captain of Arsenal.\n\nBorn in Tulle, Koscielny began his football career playing for a host of youth clubs before moving to Guingamp in 2003, where he quickly progressed through the youth ranks, making his professional debut the following season. After becoming frustrated at being played out of position as a right back, he joined Tours for an undisclosed fee, quickly establishing himself as the team\u2019s star player in his desired position, ultimately aiding in the club\u2019s promotion into Ligue 1, while also being named in the Ligue 2 Team of the Season.[3] Koscielny continued his impressive performances following a \u20ac1.7 million transfer to fellow French outfit Lorient in 2009, receiving multiple plaudits for his performances, largely cultivating a reputation as a clever, agile, ball-playing defender.[3] His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\nFollowing his arrival to England, Koscielny has widely been regarded to be one of the best players in his position, as well as one of the best in the world.[4][5] He has since established himself as a core component in the Arsenal first team, as well as contributing with a host of individual performances, including aiding in ending the club\u2019s nine-year trophy drought, scoring a crucial equalizer en route to winning the FA Cup in 2014. He was also crucial in further club successes that followed, winning another two FA Cups and the FA Community Shield on three occasions.\n\nDespite having the ability to represent Poland, Koscielny instead decided to represent France, and first appeared up for the national team against Brazil in February 2011.[6] Koscielny has since become a regular starter for the nation in every major tournament that they have appeared in, including UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, while also leading France to the final of UEFA Euro 2016. He scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland in 2016,[7] and has since amassed forty-nine appearances for the national side.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Koscielny announced that he would be retiring from international football after the competition, and thus no longer be playing for France.\n\nKoscielny was born in Tulle, Corr\u00e8ze. His career began in 2004 with Guingamp, a team that had produced such talents as Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Three years later, Koscielny was forced to take stock and drop down to the French third tier. He made 47 appearances for Guingamp, between 2004 and 2007, mostly as a right fullback.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2007, Koscielny joined Tours FC, deciding that he wanted a chance at centre back. He showed remarkable improvement in aerial ability and positional awareness that limited him to just three yellow cards. During the 2008\u201309 season, Koscielny made 34 Ligue 2 appearances, scoring 5 goals from defence, and was named in the division\u2019s best XI at the end of the season.\n\nArsenal confirmed the signing on 7 July 2010 and Koscielny was handed the club\u2019s number 6 shirt, previously worn by Philippe Senderos, who had moved to Fulham earlier in the summer. Wenger explained he bought Koscielny due to the fact he added height to the team and Arsenal were low on centre backs.[10] Koscielny made his debut against Barnet in a pre-season friendly in July 2010. One month later in his competitive debut against Liverpool at Anfield, he was sent off in the 94th minute for a second bookable offence. Both of his yellow cards were shown beyond 90 minutes. The game ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both teams having debut players sent off.[11] He scored his first goal for Arsenal on 11 September 2010, in a 4\u20131 win against Bolton Wanderers.[12]\n\nKoscielny made his debut in European competition on 15 September 2010, when he partnered S\u00e9bastien Squillaci in a 6\u20130 win over Braga at the Emirates Stadium. Koscielny was praised for performances against Sunderland and made a brilliant tackle against Tottenham Hotspur to stop Aaron Lennon from scoring during their Football League Cup tie. On 27 October, he blocked a shot off the line and provided an assist to Theo Walcott against Newcastle United in the fourth round of the League Cup, where Arsenal went on to win the match 4\u20130 at St James\u2019 Park. Koscielny was given a straight red card in Arsenal\u2019s 0\u20131 loss at home against Newcastle United on 7 November 2010. This was his second sending off of the season.\n\nKoscielny playing for Arsenal on 10 September 2011 against Swansea City.\n\nOn 25 January 2011, Koscielny scored the second goal in the 3\u20130 win over Ipswich Town in the League Cup semi-final second leg win at the Emirates Stadium. Throughout January 2011, Koscielny and Johan Djourou were a part of a defence that did not concede a goal in the Premier League. On 1 February, he scored his third goal of the season, which proved to be the winner in a 2\u20131 turn around victory over Everton. Koscielny had arguably his best performance to date for Arsenal in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16 match against Barcelona. The match ended in a 2\u20131 home win for Arsenal. Koscielny\u2019s performances were applauded and praised in many media reports of the game. Former Arsenal defender, Martin Keown, said his performance was \u201cimpressive\u201d and \u201cmagnificent throughout\u201d.[13] On 27 February, in the last minute of the 2011 Football League Cup Final, Koscielny was involved in a mix-up with his goalkeeper Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny, which resulted in Birmingham City striker Obafemi Martins scoring the winning goal.[14]\n\n2011\u201312 season\n\nKoscielny and Fernando Torres in a Premier League match on 21 April 2012.\n\nKoscielny started the 2011\u201312 season alongside Thomas Vermaelen in central defence. Koscielny was injured and taken off the pitch 10 minutes into a 2\u20130 home loss to Liverpool on 20 August 2011. However, he returned to the starting line-up Arsenal\u2019s biggest ever Premier League defeat, losing 8\u20132 to Manchester United at Old Trafford. On 17 September, Koscielny scored an own goal as Arsenal lost 4\u20133 to Blackburn Rovers in the Premier League. He went on to be named man of the match away at Olympique Marseille in the Champions League, where Arsenal won 1\u20130 at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome, keeping their first clean sheet in a Champions League away game since 18 August 2009 against Celtic, where the Gunners had won 2\u20130.\n\nOn 29 October, Koscielny received praise for his solid performance in Arsenal\u2019s 5\u20133 away win against Chelsea. He scored his first goal of the season on 2 January 2012 in a 2\u20131 away defeat against Fulham. He scored his first Champions League goal against A.C. Milan in a 3\u20130 victory in the round of 16 second leg. On 13 May 2012, he scored the winning goal in a 3\u20132 victory against West Bromwich Albion to ensure that Arsenal finished third in the Premier League. He was voted as the team\u2019s fourth most important player by the fans in Arsenal\u2019s Player of the Season poll for his performances throughout the 2011\u201312 season.[15]\n\n2012\u201313 season\n\nOn 24 July 2012, Koscielny signed a new long term contract with Arsenal.[16][17][18] His first goal of the season was a late equaliser against champions Manchester City on 23 September 2012 in a match which ended 1\u20131.[19] On 30 October, he scored a header from a corner in the 88th minute against Reading in the Football League Cup, helping Arsenal come back from 4\u20130 down to eventually win the game 7\u20135.[20]\n\nOn 13 March 2013, Koscielny scored against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena in the UEFA Champions League Last 16. His goal put Arsenal 2\u20130 ahead on the night and level at 3\u20133 on aggregate, but they still exited the competition on the away goals rule.[21]\n\nOn 19 May, Koscielny scored the winning goal as Arsenal beat Newcastle United 1\u20130 at St James\u2019 Park in their final Premier League fixture of the season to secure a fourth-placed finish and qualification to the 2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League play-off round.[22]\n\nKoscielny was voted as Arsenal\u2019s second best player of the season.[23]\n\n2013\u201314 season\n\nKoscielny started the 2013\u201314 season by conceding a penalty and getting sent off in Arsenal\u2019s 3\u20131 Premier League opening day defeat at home to Aston Villa.[24] However, his partnership with Per Mertesacker saw the Gunners achieve the joint-best defensive record in the Premier League at the halfway point of the season, as the team topped the table.[25]\n\nOn 22 February 2014, Koscielny scored his first goal of the season in a 4\u20131 defeat of Sunderland.[26] In the team\u2019s penultimate home match, Koscielny scored his second goal of the season in a 3\u20130 win against Newcastle United.[26]\n\nOn 9 May 2014, Koscielny signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.[27]\n\nOn 17 May, Koscielny scored Arsenal\u2019s equalising goal as the team came from 2\u20130 down to defeat Hull City 3\u20132 in the 2014 FA Cup Final, winning his first piece of silverware with the club.[28]\n\n2014\u201315 season\n\nKoscielny and Kieran Gibbs playing for Arsenal in a match against Chelsea on 5 October 2014\n\nOn 16 August 2014, Koscielny opened his goal-scoring account for the season, scoring Arsenal\u2019s first goal in the 2014\u201315 Premier League. The goal was header from a free-kick in first half stoppage time against Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium.[29] After sustaining an achilles tendon injury during the October international break, Koscielny was absent from the Arsenal team for seven weeks.[30] On 29 November, he returned to Arsenal\u2019s starting line-up alongside Per Mertesacker in central defence, as the Gunners kept a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns.[31] In the team\u2019s following fixture at home to Southampton, Koscielny helped Arsenal to record a second consecutive clean sheet and 1\u20130 win.[32]\n\nOn 11 January 2015, Koscielny scored the first goal in a 3\u20130 win over Stoke City.[33] On 18 January, he started in central defence as Arsenal shut out defending champions Manchester City to win 2\u20130 at the City of Manchester Stadium.[34] On 10 February, he scored the opening goal as Arsenal defeated Leicester City 2\u20131.[35] On 30 May 2015, Koscielny was selected to start in the 2015 FA Cup Final, playing the full 90 minutes in a 4\u20130 defeat of Aston Villa at Wembley Stadium.[36]\n\n2015\u201316 season\n\nKoscielny started every game in the first month of the season, excluding a 0\u20130 draw with rivals Liverpool at Emirates Stadium,[37] due to an injury. Koscielny played a vital part as Arsenal won 5 games out of six in October to go second in the Premier League, with Koscielny scoring in successive Premier League wins against Everton and Swansea.[38][39] With manager Arsene Wenger opting to play Gabriel Paulista ahead of vice-captain Per Mertesacker, Koscielny began appearing as captain in February, due to injuries to other captains Santi Cazorla & Mikel Arteta. This ended after a 3\u20132 defeat to Manchester United, when Koscielny missed four games through injury, including a North London derby at White Hart Lane.[40] He returned in a 3\u20131 away defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League, as Arsenal exited the competition at the round of 16 for the sixth season running.[41] Koscielny scored his fourth of the season in a 3\u20133 draw with West Ham.[42]\n\n2016\u201317 season\n\nKoscielny started his first game of the season in a goalless draw against Leicester City. On 10 September, he was given the role of captain and scored a fine overhead kick to equalize for the Gunners in a game which they then won 2\u20131 against Southampton making him Arsenal\u2019s highest goal scoring defender in EPL history, with the landmark achieved on his 31st birthday.[43] Koscielny was involved in a controversial incident at the end of Arsenal\u2019s 1\u20130 win over Burnley, in which Koscielny and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were involved in a goal which appeared to be scored from an offside position after hitting Koscielny\u2019s arm. Neither the perceived deliberate handball or offside offenses were deemed to be infringements and the goal was later correctly credited to Koscielny.[44][45][46] On 12 January 2017, Koscielny, alongside teammates Francis Coquelin and Olivier Giroud signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.[47] Two days later, he made his 200th appearance for Arsenal in the Premier League on a 4\u20130 away victory against Swansea City.[48][49]\n\nOn the last day of the 2016\u201317 season he received red card for a tackle on Enner Valencia of Everton. Arsenal lost an appeal and Koscielny was banned for three games, meaning he would miss FA Cup final.[50]\n\nAlthough he was absent from the FA Cup final and the Community Shield, Koscielny lifted both trophies alongside Per Mertesacker.\n\nKoscielny was called up to the French national team on 3 February 2011. Before his call up for France, Koscielny was also eligible to play for Poland and initially considered applying for Polish citizenship.[6] In August 2010, it was reported that he had not submitted an application and cancelled a meeting with Poland national team coach Franciszek Smuda in Warsaw on 7 August. Koscielny later declared that his priority was to play for France.[53]\n\nKoscielny was called up to the French team for the first time on 3 February 2011, for the team\u2019s friendly versus Brazil on 9 February.[54][55] Koscielny made his first appearance for les Bleus in a friendly match against the United States on 11 November, playing the entire match in a 1\u20130 win.\n\nHe made his first appearance in a major tournament during UEFA Euro 2012, when he played the entire match in a 2\u20130 defeat to Spain in the quarter-finals but was voted Man of the Match by the French media. On 15 November 2013, he was sent off in a 2014 World Cup qualifying play-off against Ukraine.\n\nOn 13 May 2014, Koscielny was named in Didier Deschamps\u2019 squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[56] He made his FIFA World Cup debut as a substitute for the injured Mamadou Sakho in a 5\u20132 defeat of Switzerland in the team\u2019s second group match.[57] He was then named in the starting line-up for the next match against Ecuador, helping the team to a clean sheet in a 0\u20130 draw.[58] On 4 June 2016, Koscielny scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland."}, {"url": "https://www.fmscout.com/player/8442484/laurent-koscielny.html?rev=21.0", "page_content": "FM SCOUT is the definitive Football Manager fan site.

After all, Kompany has landed in the PFA Team of the Year three times since his arrival to the blue side of Manchester, and Terry made four appearances in the aforementioned team over the years. However, with the Belgian failing to remain healthy, and the Chelsea captain nearing retirement age, there is a new king among Premier League central defenders: Laurent Koscielny.\n\nKoscielny was a relatively unknown prior to his transfer from Lorient to Arsenal in the summer of 2010. The Frenchman was playing in Ligue 2 (included in the Ligue 2 Team of the Year for the 2008/09 season) just two years before his big switch to the Premier League club. He also failed to feature internationally for France at any stage prior to playing for the Gunners. Nevertheless, manager Arsene Wenger paid just about \u00a38.5 million for the player\u2019s services, an absolute steal for how he would turn out in red and white.\n\nA mainstay in Arsenal\u2019s defense since 2010, Koscielny has been the epitome of consistency over the last six and-a-half years. Not only is the defender extremely talented, but he has been able to remain fit for most of his career in north London. In fact, Koscielny made his 200 Premier League appearance during the club\u2019s 4-0 victory over Swansea City last weekend.\n\nWhen comparing him to other high-profile Premier League center backs, the Gunner appears to dominate in the statistical department.\n\nAnother attribute that separates Koscielny from other central defenders is the fact that not only does he rack up numbers, but he is also very controlled and precise in his physicality.\n\nKoscielny\u2019s high level of play recently earned him a new contract that does not expire until the summer of 2020. Following the news of the defender re-signing a fresh deal, Wenger was full of praise for his player. \u201cI believe that [Koscielny] is one of the main players in the squad,\u201d the boss told the team\u2019s official website. \u201dHe\u2019s the leader at the back, especially with Per out. He has the biggest experience now and is really a strong player of the French national team. He\u2019s certainly one of the best defenders in the world today, so I\u2019m very pleased he\u2019s committed for the long term here.\u201d\n\nWhile having a club\u2019s manager claiming that his player is one of the best defenders in the world may not be all that impactful, Wenger certainly isn\u2019t the only one singing Koscielny\u2019s praises.\n\nFormer Manchester United great Rio Ferdinand labeled Koscielny as the best center back in the Premier League a year ago. The Arsenal man also has current players applauding him as well. United striker Marcus Rashford called Koscielny the toughest player he has ever faced during his young career so far, and Spurs goalkeeper (and France international teammate) Hugo Lloris has also recently classified the Gunner as one of the \u201cbest defenders in Europe, if not the world.\u201d\n\nAlthough Koscielny took a little different of a path to the Premier League than most superstars do, there is no doubting his ability as a defender. His combination of physicality, pace, passing abilities, intelligence, and leadership, certainly put him at the top of the list for best central defender in the Premier League."}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/laurent-koscielny", "page_content": "Laurent Koscielny: A Brief Biography\n\nLaurent Koscielny is a professional footballer from France. He was born on the 10th of September, 1985 in Tulle. Koscielny is a center back who is currently the vice-captain of the English Premier League team Arsenal.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman began his career with Guingamp in 2004 which has produced players like Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Koscielny played as a fullback for Guingamp in most of the matches.However, he felt that center back was his forte and this made him join Tours FC to take a chance at center back.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his debut season with Tours FC in 2007, Koscielny showed remarkable progress and played a major role in his team\u2019s promotion to Ligue 1. He was also named in the best XI of the season.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center back continued his good form with Lorient FC in 2009 where he was regarded as one of the best players in his position. He was developing reputation as a clever and an agile defender. His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\n\n\n\n\nDebut\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurent Koscielny had the opportunity to represent Poland but decided to ply his trade with France. He made his first appearance for France on the 9th of February, 2011 in a friendly match against United States. Koscielny played the entire game and his side sealed a 1-0 victory. On the 4th of June, 2016, Koscielny scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland.\n\n\n\n\n\nRise to Glory\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny had a great debut season with Arsenal. He was constantly making great tackles and preventing the opposition from penetrating their back line. In 2011, Koscielny had one of his best performances till date that saw Arsenal beat Barcelona 2-1 in the round of 16 Champions League tie.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman was a great asset to the team as apart from acting as a defender, he had a great goal scoring ability. Till date, Koscielny has scored 24 goals for Arsenal. He is the highest scoring defender for Arsenal in the history of EPL. He is regarded as one of the most important players for Arsenal in the past seven years.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny has won the FA Cup with Arsenal in 2014, 2015 and 2017. He has also won the FA Community Shield in 2014, 2015 and 2017. The center back has made a major contribution in his team\u2019s success in the FA Cup over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow Points\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny has got more than thirty yellow cards and as many as five red cards. This has forced him out of a few crucial encounters and has affected the team\u2019s performance. He has missed more games due to suspension and not because of injury.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center back must work on preventing harsh tackles so as to represent Arsenal in more and more games and increase their chances of winning more trophies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman is yet to win the Premier League with Arsenal. Although he has won six titles at Arsenal, the coveted Premier League title has eluded him."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/49247291", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section European Football\n\nLaurent Koscielny joined Arsenal in 2010 and made more than 300 appearances for the north London club\n\nArsenal have sold defender Laurent Koscielny to Ligue 1 side Bordeaux for a fee of up to 5m euros (\u00a34.6m).\n\nThe 33-year-old centre-back had a medical on Tuesday and has returned to France after nine years with the Premier League club.\n\nFrenchman Koscielny had a year left on his contract at Emirates Stadium and the Gunners wanted him to stay.\n\nBut he asked for a free transfer and refused to travel on a pre-season tour of the United States.\n\n\"We decided to sanction his move to Bordeaux once we agreed acceptable transfer terms,\" Arsenal said in a statement.\n\n\"We thank Laurent for his contribution to the club and wish him all the best for the future.\"\n\nFormer France international Koscielny rejected a new Gunners contract that he felt undervalued his contribution and continued ability.\n\nArsenal began disciplinary proceedings and instructed the captain to train with the under-23s, but offered him a way back into the first-team squad for the new season.\n\nHowever, Koscielny had no intention of reversing his decision and was determined to secure a move to his home country.\n\nTalks also took place with Bordeaux's Ligue 1 rivals Rennes.\n\nArsenal hope to sign a new centre-back before the Premier League's transfer deadline at 17:00 BST on Thursday, while they retain an interest in Celtic left-back Kieran Tierney despite the 22-year-old Scotland international being injured.\n\nThe Gunners are also in advanced talks over the sale of English right-back Carl Jenkinson, 27, to Championship side Nottingham Forest.\n\nHowever, Arsenal have received no firm offers for defender Shkodran Mustafi and attempts to move the 27-year-old German on are further complicated by his desire to stay.\n\nBut foreign clubs have longer to negotiate a deal, depending on when their transfer windows close.\n\nFind all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page."}, {"url": "https://www.the-sun.com/sport/football/premier-league/4982844/ex-arsenal-laurent-koscielny-retires-denies-racism-allegations-bordeaux/", "page_content": "FORMER Arsenal and Bordeaux captain Laurent Koscielny has announced his retirement from football and strongly denied \"shocking\" allegations of racism.\n\nKoscielny, 36, left the French club in January after he was frozen out.\n\n1 Koscielny has announced his retirement and also denied allegations of racism from Bordeaux's ultras Credit: GETTY\n\nAlongside team-mate Benoit Costil, the former France international was accused of a lack of leadership and \"scandalous, sometimes racist\" behaviour by Bordeaux's ultras - accusations Koscielny strongly denies.\n\nA statement read: \"Following the article published in the Sud Ouest newspaper on March 22, 2022 entitled 'Girondins de Bordeaux.

It is Wenger\u2019s worst at Arsenal in terms of the number of goals conceded. Although a part of this can be attributed to that once in a blue moon goal fest at Old Trafford, the defensive frailties of Arsenal continue to worry the fans as the team looks to form a stable defensive partnership at the back.\n\nYet, Laurent Koscielny has stood out like a beacon guiding the team through troubled waters and ensuring that the backline is as impenetrable as possible. What\u2019s ironic is that he\u2019s the least experienced of the three world class centre backs currently in the Arsenal squad and at the same time the most matured of the lot.\n\nThomas Vermaelen was expected to lead the defence this season, already having a wealth of experience under his belt. But an injury plagued year on the sidelines had rendered him a little rusty and his form had been suspect. Per Mertesacker had just joined the club this season and was taking time to adapt to the rigours and physicality of the Premier League.\n\nBut Koscielny has proved his worth time and again and has hardly put a foot wrong this season. The question on everyone\u2019s mind at the start of the season was; who will partner Thomas Vermaelen in defence? Koscielny or Mertesacker?\n\nThe question soon became; who will be benched \u2013 Vermaelen or Mertesacker?\n\nIn a season that could break all Premier League records in terms of the sheer volume of goals scored, Koscielny would find a place in my Premier League XI any day. Going simply by stats, Vermaelen has been picked ahead of him by many because he has scored more goals (Insert favourite Fernando Torres/Andy Carroll joke here). But having closely watched Koscielny\u2019s performances over ninety minutes in Arsenal\u2019s games this season, one would hardly realize that this is the same player who, only a couple of years ago, was playing in the second tier of French football.\n\nHis progress over the past two seasons has been astronomical. He didn\u2019t have the best of debuts after he signed for Arsenal from Lorient. He was sent off in his first Premier League game at Anfield \u2013 a game where he was stretchered off at half time after a Joe Cole tackle but came back on for the second half. Later in the season, he forged an unlikely but formidable defensive partnership with Johan Djourou and kept many clean sheets which propelled Arsenal up the table. His best performance came against Barcelona as he kept the likes of Messi and Iniesta at bay.\n\nBut the dream run came crashing down in the Carling Cup final when a mix up with Szczesny allowed Birmingham City to scoring the winner in the final minutes of the game. Arsenal\u2019s form dropped and they were soon knocked out of all competitions. But that did not deter Koscielny. He was determined to make up for his mistakes and continued to train hard.\n\nThat determination has paid rich dividends this season. Arguably the most consistent defender on the pitch, Koscielny\u2019s improvements were laid bare for all to see. His Man of the Match performance against AC Milan at the Emirates comes to mind when we talk about his best performances. In a recent interview, he revealed the different methods he adopted to ensure he could adapt to an opponent\u2019s style of play \u2013 be it dealing with long balls for Peter Crouch or taking on technically adept players like Luis Suarez.\n\nHis positional awareness and well timed leaps to win aerial duels did not go unnoticed. Crucial tackles in the box and clean last man tackles (the most in the Premier League) ensured opponents did not even get a sniff of the goal. He has won more than 60% of aerial duels (2 per game) and has a pass success percentage of more than 80%.\n\nHis interceptions are also a key in initiating attacks as we see him charging through the centre of the field, sometimes even dribbling past three players before passing it forward and getting back to his position. He has also won 50 offsides this season (more than Vermaelen, Mertesacker and Sagna combined!) at the rate of 1.5 offsides per game; which is an amazing stat as Arsenal heavily depends on this strategy when they play a high line.\n\nWhat\u2019s remarkable is that Koscielny is only 26 years old. That\u2019s a long way to go for a central defender. In just two years he has become a force to reckon with in the Premier League, keeping top strikers at bay and at the same time earning a national team call up from the French coach Laurent Blanc who said, \u201cLaurent Koscielny is having an excellent season at Arsenal. Perhaps the most improved player of the year.\u201d\n\nBut a single competent defender does not a good partnership make. The other centre backs need to pull up their socks and Wenger must decide how best to use his defenders. What Arsenal needs is someone who can complement Koscielny at the back. And a good rotation policy next season will ensure an injury free campaign.\n\nHaving played more than 40 games in both his seasons at Arsenal and on current form, Bosscielny who started his career as a full back is undoubtedly Arsenal\u2019s number one centre back.\n\nStats from WhoScored.com\n\nPaul Merson predicts the result of Man City vs Inter UEFA Champions League final!

While the game would go some way in establishing the Gunners\u2019 credentials, Emery would have liked an easier fixture to get the ball rolling.\n\nA major criticism of Wenger\u2019s latter years in charge was that the Gunners were a little lightweight and had a \u2018soft underbelly\u2019. Emery would like to shed off that tag quickly and make Arsenal a tough nut to crack.\n\nEmery moved in the market to bring in defensive reinforcements in the form of Sokratis and Lichtsteiner to complement the likes of Mustafi, Koscielny and Holding. He also made the strange decision of letting Chambers leave on loan, which leaves Arsenal a little short in the defensive third.\n\nThrough the course of this article, we would focus on an area Arsenal have seemingly neglected for the better part of a decade. I will try to throw some light on the shortcomings of each Centre Back while highlighting their strengths.\n\n#1 Laurent Koscielny\n\nLaurent Koscielny was appointed club captain after Per Mertesacker assumed his role as head of the academy. Towards the end of last season, his achilles problem resurfaced and he now faces an extended period on the side-lines. However, he still remains Arsenal\u2019s most trustworthy Centre Back.\n\nStrengths: He is a good reader of the game and shows good pace on the cover. Koscielny also possess the ability to come up with last-ditch tackles to bail the team out of trouble. To supplement this, he has the uncanny knack of coming up with crucial goals from set-pieces.\n\nWeaknesses: He gets outmuscled sometimes against strong, physical centre forwards. Diego Costa and Andy Carroll have in particular, troubled him quite often. With age, the number of errors in his game are creeping up.\n\nArsenal would want him back on the pitch sooner rather than later as he still represents Arsenal\u2019s best option as the left-sided Centre Back.\n\nKoscielny making a last-ditch tackle to deny Aguero\n\n#2 Shkodran Mustafi\n\nArsenal v Paris Saint Germain\n\nStrengths: A defender with huge potential, he is good at making interceptions. Apart from this, he is very comfortable with the ball at his feet and plays the role of distributor in Arsenal\u2019s back line. Mustafi is also one of the few Arsenal centre backs who are good in the air.Mustafi was signed a couple of seasons back from Valencia. He enjoyed a solid start to his Arsenal career and had a decent unbeaten streak going for him. However, things turned sour for him very quickly. Mustafi had to endure a tough second season at Arsenal. The Gooners would hope a change in manager brings out the best in the former Valencia man.\n\nWeakness: He gets caught out of position too often and without the pace to recover, leaves his team exposed at the back. Despite his talent, makes a lot of errors which lead to goals. Hence, he hasn\u2019t slipped into the top most bracket of centre backs yet. Mustafi also commits to tackles too easily, thus leading to fouls against fleet-footed players.\n\nWith Koscielny out of the picture till the end of 2018, Emery would like to build his defence around Mustafi. The latter has shown that he has the talent and now it is time to deliver on that promise.\n\nMustafi displaying his aerial prowess\n\n- International Champions Cup 2018\n\n#3 Sokratis Papastathopoulos\n\nSokratis using his strength to clear the danger\n\nStrengths: Sokratis is a warrior and leader in the truest sense. Willing to put his body on the line, his commitment to defending is second to none. Out of Arsenal\u2019s centre backs, he is the best aerial defender. In addition to being a good game reader, he brings bags of experience to an inexperienced back-line. The Greek defender was brought in from Borussia Dortmund in the summer. He had a solid pre-season for the Gunners and Emery would hope he can hit the ground running against the Cityzens.\n\nWeaknesses: Pace is not his biggest asset and he could find himself in trouble against some of the league\u2019s speed merchants. The Premier League is much quicker than the Bundesliga and Sokratis would have to acclimatise swiftly.\n\nOf the current Centre Backs fit enough to play, Sokratis represents the most stable alternative. Arsenal have never had the fortune of having a warrior of the ilk of Tony Adams since he left. While Sokratis has a long way to emulate Adams, Sokratis relishes the prospect of being involved in a war of attrition, similar to Adams. If Sokratis is even half as successful as Mr. Arsenal, he would have had a stellar career at Arsenal.\n\n#4 Rob Holding\n\nHolding playing out from the back\n\nStrengths: Holding is a good passer of the ball and wins his fair share of headers. He has enormous potential and belongs to the breed of ball-playing centre backs. With age on his side, he can develop into one of Arsenal\u2019s premier centre backs in the years to come.Rob Holding is an exciting English defender who was signed from Bolton Wanderers a few seasons back. While his compatriot John Stones has gone on to cement his place at Manchester City, Holding has been unable to hold down a place at the Emirates. With Koscielny out with injury, Holding could be thrown straight into the mix.\n\nWeakness: Lacks pace and gets caught out of position too often, like Mustafi. He also faces problems against dazzling dribblers as he gets too tight to them, only to get beaten. Sadio Mane in 2016 and more recently Correa exposed that deficiency. Though he is good on the ball, he sometimes overplays and puts his team in trouble.\n\nRob Holding is far from being the finished article. However, he would hope that Emery can help him develop quicker than he did under Arsene. At present, he is the only fit left-sided centre back. Hence, one can expect opportunities to come his way.\n\n#5 Konstantinos Mavropanos\n\nMavropanos using his pace and power to win the ball\n\nStrengths: He is an old-fashioned defender who prioritises defending over attacking. He does not mind getting stuck into challenges. Mavropanos possesses good pace and strength and has the attributes to emulate his Greek teammate, Sokratis.Mavropanos is a Greek defender who was signed by Arsenal in the winter transfer window of 2018. He has impressed in the handful of appearances he has made for the Gunners but has a long road ahead to become an ever-present in Arsenal\u2019s defence.\n\nWeaknesses: He is far from the finished article and makes questionable decisions at times. His red card against Leicester being a perfect case in point. He is still a little raw and makes challenges that he can avoid. Mavropanos is not very good technically and buckles under pressure, when trying to play out from the back.\n\nMavropanos is still very young and has an enormous amount of time on his hands. In Emery, he has the ideal manager who would help him develop into a top-drawer centre back.\n\nPoll : 0 votes"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/@gentie/history-of-laurent-koscielny-5047b6fe8a03", "page_content": "History Of Laurent Koscielny gentie \u00b7 Follow \u00b7 Feb 13, 2018 10 min read -- Listen Share\n\nLaurent Koscielny (French pronunciation: [lo\u0281\u0251\u0303 kosj\u025bl\u0272i]; born 10 September 1985) is a French professional footballer who plays as a centre back for English club Arsenal and the France national team. He is vice-captain of Arsenal.\n\nBorn in Tulle, Koscielny began his football career playing for a host of youth clubs before moving to Guingamp in 2003, where he quickly progressed through the youth ranks, making his professional debut the following season. After becoming frustrated at being played out of position as a right back, he joined Tours for an undisclosed fee, quickly establishing himself as the team\u2019s star player in his desired position, ultimately aiding in the club\u2019s promotion into Ligue 1, while also being named in the Ligue 2 Team of the Season.[3] Koscielny continued his impressive performances following a \u20ac1.7 million transfer to fellow French outfit Lorient in 2009, receiving multiple plaudits for his performances, largely cultivating a reputation as a clever, agile, ball-playing defender.[3] His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\nFollowing his arrival to England, Koscielny has widely been regarded to be one of the best players in his position, as well as one of the best in the world.[4][5] He has since established himself as a core component in the Arsenal first team, as well as contributing with a host of individual performances, including aiding in ending the club\u2019s nine-year trophy drought, scoring a crucial equalizer en route to winning the FA Cup in 2014. He was also crucial in further club successes that followed, winning another two FA Cups and the FA Community Shield on three occasions.\n\nDespite having the ability to represent Poland, Koscielny instead decided to represent France, and first appeared up for the national team against Brazil in February 2011.[6] Koscielny has since become a regular starter for the nation in every major tournament that they have appeared in, including UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, while also leading France to the final of UEFA Euro 2016. He scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland in 2016,[7] and has since amassed forty-nine appearances for the national side.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Koscielny announced that he would be retiring from international football after the competition, and thus no longer be playing for France.\n\nKoscielny was born in Tulle, Corr\u00e8ze. His career began in 2004 with Guingamp, a team that had produced such talents as Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Three years later, Koscielny was forced to take stock and drop down to the French third tier. He made 47 appearances for Guingamp, between 2004 and 2007, mostly as a right fullback.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2007, Koscielny joined Tours FC, deciding that he wanted a chance at centre back. He showed remarkable improvement in aerial ability and positional awareness that limited him to just three yellow cards. During the 2008\u201309 season, Koscielny made 34 Ligue 2 appearances, scoring 5 goals from defence, and was named in the division\u2019s best XI at the end of the season.\n\nArsenal confirmed the signing on 7 July 2010 and Koscielny was handed the club\u2019s number 6 shirt, previously worn by Philippe Senderos, who had moved to Fulham earlier in the summer. Wenger explained he bought Koscielny due to the fact he added height to the team and Arsenal were low on centre backs.[10] Koscielny made his debut against Barnet in a pre-season friendly in July 2010. One month later in his competitive debut against Liverpool at Anfield, he was sent off in the 94th minute for a second bookable offence. Both of his yellow cards were shown beyond 90 minutes. The game ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both teams having debut players sent off.[11] He scored his first goal for Arsenal on 11 September 2010, in a 4\u20131 win against Bolton Wanderers.[12]\n\nKoscielny made his debut in European competition on 15 September 2010, when he partnered S\u00e9bastien Squillaci in a 6\u20130 win over Braga at the Emirates Stadium. Koscielny was praised for performances against Sunderland and made a brilliant tackle against Tottenham Hotspur to stop Aaron Lennon from scoring during their Football League Cup tie. On 27 October, he blocked a shot off the line and provided an assist to Theo Walcott against Newcastle United in the fourth round of the League Cup, where Arsenal went on to win the match 4\u20130 at St James\u2019 Park. Koscielny was given a straight red card in Arsenal\u2019s 0\u20131 loss at home against Newcastle United on 7 November 2010. This was his second sending off of the season.\n\nKoscielny playing for Arsenal on 10 September 2011 against Swansea City.\n\nOn 25 January 2011, Koscielny scored the second goal in the 3\u20130 win over Ipswich Town in the League Cup semi-final second leg win at the Emirates Stadium. Throughout January 2011, Koscielny and Johan Djourou were a part of a defence that did not concede a goal in the Premier League. On 1 February, he scored his third goal of the season, which proved to be the winner in a 2\u20131 turn around victory over Everton. Koscielny had arguably his best performance to date for Arsenal in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16 match against Barcelona. The match ended in a 2\u20131 home win for Arsenal. Koscielny\u2019s performances were applauded and praised in many media reports of the game. Former Arsenal defender, Martin Keown, said his performance was \u201cimpressive\u201d and \u201cmagnificent throughout\u201d.[13] On 27 February, in the last minute of the 2011 Football League Cup Final, Koscielny was involved in a mix-up with his goalkeeper Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny, which resulted in Birmingham City striker Obafemi Martins scoring the winning goal.[14]\n\n2011\u201312 season\n\nKoscielny and Fernando Torres in a Premier League match on 21 April 2012.\n\nKoscielny started the 2011\u201312 season alongside Thomas Vermaelen in central defence. Koscielny was injured and taken off the pitch 10 minutes into a 2\u20130 home loss to Liverpool on 20 August 2011. However, he returned to the starting line-up Arsenal\u2019s biggest ever Premier League defeat, losing 8\u20132 to Manchester United at Old Trafford. On 17 September, Koscielny scored an own goal as Arsenal lost 4\u20133 to Blackburn Rovers in the Premier League. He went on to be named man of the match away at Olympique Marseille in the Champions League, where Arsenal won 1\u20130 at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome, keeping their first clean sheet in a Champions League away game since 18 August 2009 against Celtic, where the Gunners had won 2\u20130.\n\nOn 29 October, Koscielny received praise for his solid performance in Arsenal\u2019s 5\u20133 away win against Chelsea. He scored his first goal of the season on 2 January 2012 in a 2\u20131 away defeat against Fulham. He scored his first Champions League goal against A.C. Milan in a 3\u20130 victory in the round of 16 second leg. On 13 May 2012, he scored the winning goal in a 3\u20132 victory against West Bromwich Albion to ensure that Arsenal finished third in the Premier League. He was voted as the team\u2019s fourth most important player by the fans in Arsenal\u2019s Player of the Season poll for his performances throughout the 2011\u201312 season.[15]\n\n2012\u201313 season\n\nOn 24 July 2012, Koscielny signed a new long term contract with Arsenal.[16][17][18] His first goal of the season was a late equaliser against champions Manchester City on 23 September 2012 in a match which ended 1\u20131.[19] On 30 October, he scored a header from a corner in the 88th minute against Reading in the Football League Cup, helping Arsenal come back from 4\u20130 down to eventually win the game 7\u20135.[20]\n\nOn 13 March 2013, Koscielny scored against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena in the UEFA Champions League Last 16. His goal put Arsenal 2\u20130 ahead on the night and level at 3\u20133 on aggregate, but they still exited the competition on the away goals rule.[21]\n\nOn 19 May, Koscielny scored the winning goal as Arsenal beat Newcastle United 1\u20130 at St James\u2019 Park in their final Premier League fixture of the season to secure a fourth-placed finish and qualification to the 2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League play-off round.[22]\n\nKoscielny was voted as Arsenal\u2019s second best player of the season.[23]\n\n2013\u201314 season\n\nKoscielny started the 2013\u201314 season by conceding a penalty and getting sent off in Arsenal\u2019s 3\u20131 Premier League opening day defeat at home to Aston Villa.[24] However, his partnership with Per Mertesacker saw the Gunners achieve the joint-best defensive record in the Premier League at the halfway point of the season, as the team topped the table.[25]\n\nOn 22 February 2014, Koscielny scored his first goal of the season in a 4\u20131 defeat of Sunderland.[26] In the team\u2019s penultimate home match, Koscielny scored his second goal of the season in a 3\u20130 win against Newcastle United.[26]\n\nOn 9 May 2014, Koscielny signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.[27]\n\nOn 17 May, Koscielny scored Arsenal\u2019s equalising goal as the team came from 2\u20130 down to defeat Hull City 3\u20132 in the 2014 FA Cup Final, winning his first piece of silverware with the club.[28]\n\n2014\u201315 season\n\nKoscielny and Kieran Gibbs playing for Arsenal in a match against Chelsea on 5 October 2014\n\nOn 16 August 2014, Koscielny opened his goal-scoring account for the season, scoring Arsenal\u2019s first goal in the 2014\u201315 Premier League. The goal was header from a free-kick in first half stoppage time against Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium.[29] After sustaining an achilles tendon injury during the October international break, Koscielny was absent from the Arsenal team for seven weeks.[30] On 29 November, he returned to Arsenal\u2019s starting line-up alongside Per Mertesacker in central defence, as the Gunners kept a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns.[31] In the team\u2019s following fixture at home to Southampton, Koscielny helped Arsenal to record a second consecutive clean sheet and 1\u20130 win.[32]\n\nOn 11 January 2015, Koscielny scored the first goal in a 3\u20130 win over Stoke City.[33] On 18 January, he started in central defence as Arsenal shut out defending champions Manchester City to win 2\u20130 at the City of Manchester Stadium.[34] On 10 February, he scored the opening goal as Arsenal defeated Leicester City 2\u20131.[35] On 30 May 2015, Koscielny was selected to start in the 2015 FA Cup Final, playing the full 90 minutes in a 4\u20130 defeat of Aston Villa at Wembley Stadium.[36]\n\n2015\u201316 season\n\nKoscielny started every game in the first month of the season, excluding a 0\u20130 draw with rivals Liverpool at Emirates Stadium,[37] due to an injury. Koscielny played a vital part as Arsenal won 5 games out of six in October to go second in the Premier League, with Koscielny scoring in successive Premier League wins against Everton and Swansea.[38][39] With manager Arsene Wenger opting to play Gabriel Paulista ahead of vice-captain Per Mertesacker, Koscielny began appearing as captain in February, due to injuries to other captains Santi Cazorla & Mikel Arteta. This ended after a 3\u20132 defeat to Manchester United, when Koscielny missed four games through injury, including a North London derby at White Hart Lane.[40] He returned in a 3\u20131 away defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League, as Arsenal exited the competition at the round of 16 for the sixth season running.[41] Koscielny scored his fourth of the season in a 3\u20133 draw with West Ham.[42]\n\n2016\u201317 season\n\nKoscielny started his first game of the season in a goalless draw against Leicester City. On 10 September, he was given the role of captain and scored a fine overhead kick to equalize for the Gunners in a game which they then won 2\u20131 against Southampton making him Arsenal\u2019s highest goal scoring defender in EPL history, with the landmark achieved on his 31st birthday.[43] Koscielny was involved in a controversial incident at the end of Arsenal\u2019s 1\u20130 win over Burnley, in which Koscielny and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were involved in a goal which appeared to be scored from an offside position after hitting Koscielny\u2019s arm. Neither the perceived deliberate handball or offside offenses were deemed to be infringements and the goal was later correctly credited to Koscielny.[44][45][46] On 12 January 2017, Koscielny, alongside teammates Francis Coquelin and Olivier Giroud signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.[47] Two days later, he made his 200th appearance for Arsenal in the Premier League on a 4\u20130 away victory against Swansea City.[48][49]\n\nOn the last day of the 2016\u201317 season he received red card for a tackle on Enner Valencia of Everton. Arsenal lost an appeal and Koscielny was banned for three games, meaning he would miss FA Cup final.[50]\n\nAlthough he was absent from the FA Cup final and the Community Shield, Koscielny lifted both trophies alongside Per Mertesacker.\n\nKoscielny was called up to the French national team on 3 February 2011. Before his call up for France, Koscielny was also eligible to play for Poland and initially considered applying for Polish citizenship.[6] In August 2010, it was reported that he had not submitted an application and cancelled a meeting with Poland national team coach Franciszek Smuda in Warsaw on 7 August. Koscielny later declared that his priority was to play for France.[53]\n\nKoscielny was called up to the French team for the first time on 3 February 2011, for the team\u2019s friendly versus Brazil on 9 February.[54][55] Koscielny made his first appearance for les Bleus in a friendly match against the United States on 11 November, playing the entire match in a 1\u20130 win.\n\nHe made his first appearance in a major tournament during UEFA Euro 2012, when he played the entire match in a 2\u20130 defeat to Spain in the quarter-finals but was voted Man of the Match by the French media. On 15 November 2013, he was sent off in a 2014 World Cup qualifying play-off against Ukraine.\n\nOn 13 May 2014, Koscielny was named in Didier Deschamps\u2019 squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[56] He made his FIFA World Cup debut as a substitute for the injured Mamadou Sakho in a 5\u20132 defeat of Switzerland in the team\u2019s second group match.[57] He was then named in the starting line-up for the next match against Ecuador, helping the team to a clean sheet in a 0\u20130 draw.[58] On 4 June 2016, Koscielny scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland."}, {"url": "https://www.arsenal.com/news/features/20170428/arsenal-analysis-three-at-the-back", "page_content": "Having gone 20 years and more than 1,000 matches without using a three-man defence, Arsene Wenger surprised everyone by switching to that system for the 2-1 victory at Middlesbrough last week.\n\nThat was followed with a 2-1 Emirates FA Cup semi-final victory over Manchester City with the same system, while Wednesday\u2019s 1-0 win over Leicester also featured Arsenal using that system for the majority of the contest.\n\nIt brings to mind the old saying about London buses \u2013 you wait ages for one, and then three come along at once. But the more the Gunners keep winning with that formation, the more Wenger will be inclined to use it.\n\nPlay video Watch Arsenal video online\n\nOne of his first moves as Arsenal manager back in 1996 was attempting to switch from the 3-5-2 they\u2019d previously been using, and to the 4-4-2 system that Wenger would eventually depend upon for many years.\n\nThe players initially objected to that change, and the manager compromised and played 3-5-2 for the remainder of 1996/97. But the following season he insisted upon a four-man defence, Arsenal won the league, and not once has he returned to a back three - until now.\n\nToday\u2019s system is very different from the one used two decades ago, though. For a start it\u2019s a 3-4-3 rather than a 3-5-2, and the nature of modern football, and the emphasis upon technical defenders, means the players in defensive positions are very different.\n\nBack in the 1990s, the back three were simply centre backs, the wing-backs merely full-backs pushed forward. These days, however, it\u2019s quite possible to play full-backs in the three-man defence, and wide midfielders as wing-backs, and therefore we\u2019ve seen Nacho Monreal playing both left-centre-back and left-wing-back, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain dropping into a wing-back role.\n\nPerhaps the most noticeable changes, however, have come from two centre-backs. One of the major beneficiaries of the system has been Gabriel, deployed in a right-sided centre-back role. This appears to suit the Brazilian\u2019s game very effectively; he\u2019s a naturally proactive defender who likes coming out of the backline to shut down opponents taking up deeper positions. In a four-man defence that means a large gap can often open up, but in a three-man defence he appears much more comfortable.\n\nThe difference is noticeable. Here is his heatmap from Wednesday\u2019s win over Leicester:\n\nGabriel's heatmap against Leicester\n\nIt shows a significantly more advanced position than the last time he started as a right-sided centre-back, in the home victory over Crystal Palace in January:\n\nGabriel heatmap against Crystal Palace\n\nThe positioning of Laurent Koscielny has also been interesting. Whereas Koscielny plays roughly like Gabriel in a back four, always trying to nip in ahead of opponents and intercept the ball, he\u2019s been switched to the free role between the other two centre-backs, which means he plays a calmer, more reserved sweeping role. Rather than moving forward into challenges, Koscielny has to drop off, assess the situation and provide the last line of defence.\n\nHe\u2019s played that role effectively, and as the central defender also has most responsibility for distribution. His passing on Wednesday night shows great balance \u2013 he passes 22 times to Gabriel and 22 times to Monreal. Incidentally, these were Arsenal\u2019s most frequent passing combinations of the game.\n\nLaurent Koscielny's passing\n\nOn the left, meanwhile, Wenger has used Rob Holding, who isn\u2019t naturally left-footed but has adapted well to that position, showing authority in possession and good positional sense too. He also has the mobility to cover the wide area.\n\nAgainst Leicester, meanwhile, Monreal started there \u2013 and he\u2019s arguably been the biggest hero of the three-man system. Indeed, in the space of two matches he\u2019s played left-wing-back, then left-centre-back, and then his usual left-back position when Wenger switched to a four-man defence. He\u2019s looked comfortable in all three roles, netted a fine volleyed equaliser against City and was responsible for Wednesday\u2019s winner when his shot deflected in off Robert Huth.\n\nIt remains to be seen how long Arsenal continue using the three-man defence \u2013 the breakthrough against Leicester came after a switch to 4-2-3-1. But it\u2019s another weapon in Wenger\u2019s tactical armoury, and ahead of two huge games against Tottenham and Manchester United, the opposition will be left guessing about Arsenal\u2019s system."}, {"url": "https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/01/unai-emery-arsenal-transfer-defender-laurent-koscielny-10498375/", "page_content": "The Gunners boss would rather his captain remains at the Emirates this summer (Picture: Getty)\n\nUnai Emery still hopes to convince Arsenal captain Laurent Koscielny to remain at the club despite asking to leave \u2013 though is planning to bring in a new centre-back if he does depart.\n\nThe 33-year-old defender, who has been at the club since 2010, remains keen to leave the Emirates and return to France, though that would leave Arsenal short at the back as they try to offload Shkodran Mustafi too.\n\nEmery has not given up hope of changing Koscielny\u2019s mind, but revealed Arsenal are already preparing for life after their skipper and are likely to dip into the transfer market.\n\nKoscielny has been at Arsenal for nine years but is ready for a new challenge (Picture: Getty)\n\nAsked if Koscielny will be allowed to leave if Arsenal sign a new central defender, Emery explained: \u2018Now it is between the club and him.

In France, certain players are being ordered to leave before they have even found a club for which to sign.\n\nLast week the Bordeaux president and owner Gerard Lopez phoned the agent of club captain Laurent Koscielny and told him his client was no longer wanted. The 36-year-old former Arsenal skipper has not, it is understood, provided the standards of performances on the pitch or leadership off it the club expected of him. Bordeaux want him out before the end of the month.\n\nKoscielny played 51 times for France. He is Bordeaux\u2019s highest-profile player. The story caused a stir.\n\nLaurent Koscileny left Arsenal in acrimonious circumstances two years ago\n\nTwo days on, the former Gunners defender had his say. \u2018They gave me no reason for their decision,\u2019 he told French sports daily L\u2019Equipe. \u2018They just said it was their new strategy.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a slap in the face. But I\u2019m a fighter and I\u2019ll continue to fight. In training, I\u2019m still giving my all.\u2019\n\nIn such impasses, PR machines whir into action. To intimations that have somehow made their way into the press that he enjoys a tipple with friends and family on his days off, Koscielny drily replied: \u2018Of course I like wine. I live in a wine region.\u2019\n\nBordeaux are 19th in Ligue 1. Only St Etienne sit below them in the standings. Koscielny has admitted he could have played better this season.\n\nIf form was the only metric that mattered, however, the entire squad would be up for sale. So what\u2019s the real reason behind Bordeaux banishing him?\n\nBordeaux are struggling at the foot of Ligue 1 this season (Picture: Getty)\n\nMoney, of course. Koscielny signed for Bordeaux from Arsenal in 2019, when the club was under different ownership. Then Covid-induced income losses and the collapse of a TV deal hit French football.\n\nWhen the owners for whom Koscielny signed pulled out last summer, the club nearly went under. New owner Lopez is scrabbling to make savings. Projected 2021-22 losses are estimated at between \u00a333million and \u00a354m.\n\nRevenue raising is the priority. Koscielny\u2019s contract belongs in a different era. Five other Bordeaux players have been told to find new employers. One of them, Nigeria winger Samuel Kalu, agreed this week to join Watford for \u00a33.5m. For the balance sheet, it\u2019s a start.\n\nThe on-pitch impact is another matter. Last weekend \u2014 without Koscielny \u2014 Bordeaux lost 6-0 at Rennes. It was the club\u2019s heaviest league defeat since 1986.\n\nBordeaux are one of France\u2019s great clubs. In the 1980s, under future World Cup-winning manager Aime Jacquet, sides containing midfield greats Alain Giresse and Jean Tigana won three league titles.\n\nA young Zinedine Zidane thrilled fans when Bordeaux reached the 1995 Uefa Cup final. Under Laurent Blanc, \u2018les Girondins\u2019, as they\u2019re known \u2014 a reference to the Gironde region in which Bordeaux is based \u2014 were crowned champions in 2009.\n\nSuch glories are a long way off. Relegation is a likelier prospect now.\n\nWherever he watched last weekend\u2019s match \u2014 if, indeed, he watched it at all \u2014 Koscielny might have concluded a fresh start elsewhere would be welcome.\n\nMORE : Transfer news live: Man Utd pull out of Erling Haaland race as Arsenal wait on Dusan Vlahovic decision\n\nMORE : Fiorentina chief deals huge blow to Arsenal\u2019s hopes of signing Dusan Vlahovic"}, {"url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-captain-laurent-koscielny-bordeaux-25917218", "page_content": "Laurent Koscielny left Arsenal under acrimonious circumstances in 2019 and finds himself embroiled in fresh turmoil at Bordeaux amid the club's dire form in Ligue 1\n\nBordeaux have exiled Laurent Koscielny from the first-team squad and stripped him of the captain's armband as their crisis intensifies, according to reports in France.\n\nLes Girondins have only won three games out of 20 in Ligue 1 this season to leave them loitering dangerously close to the relegation zone in 17th.\n\nKoscielny, the 36-year-old former Arsenal captain, has only played 11 of those games due to injury and his errors at centre-back are said to have infuriated the club's hierarchy given his sizeable wages, believed to be the highest of any player on their books.\n\nBordeaux have the worst defensive record of any team in the French top flight with 44 goals conceded and they crashed out of the Coupe de France at the start of January with a dismal 3-0 defeat at Stade Brestois.\n\nHave Your Say!
