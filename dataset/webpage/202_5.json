His collection of large cents included all the varieties called \"collectible\" by Sheldon. He exhibited uncirculated large cents at the 1935 ANA convention. His second set of large cents was donated to the Carnegie Institute. An extensive exhibit was prepared when the ANA convention was held in Pittsburgh. In 1937 he donated his first quality set of 1452 large cents to the American Numismatic Society in New York. He died in Pittsburgh.\n\nAuthor of The United States Cents of the Years 1798-1799 in 1931. One hundred twenty-six cloth bound copies and nine leather bound presentation copies were issued.
