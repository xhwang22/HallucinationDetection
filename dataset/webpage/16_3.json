{"Carol Huston made her film debut in The Misfits.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Misfits", "page_content": "The Misfits, American film drama, released in 1961, that is perhaps best remembered as the final movie of screen legends Marilyn Monroe and Clark Gable.\n\nThe Misfits, directed by John Huston, is a contemporary tale of the West that centres on aging cowboys. Out of their element in the modern world, they now herd wild \u201cmisfit\u201d horses from their trucks and sell them to be killed and cheaply sold as pet food. Monroe played a troubled ex-stripper who falls in love with Gable\u2019s cowboy character but is appalled at the capture and fate of these once-free animals. The parallel in the plot is thinly disguised: the hopeless plight of the horses mirrors that of their captors.\n\nBritannica Quiz Oscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nPlaywright Arthur Miller wrote the script specifically for Monroe, his wife, though their marriage would disintegrate during production of the film. The publicity surrounding The Misfits centred on Monroe\u2019s real-life problems, unreliable work habits, and temper tantrums. Gable died about a week after the film was finished, and within a year of its release Monroe was dead from a drug overdose. Costar Montgomery Clift made only three films after The Misfits, dying in 1966 at age 45. The scenes depicting the roundup of wild horses are particularly well staged, and Gable\u2019s insistence on doing many of his own stunts might have contributed to the heart attack that killed him."}, {"url": "https://nevadamagazine.com/issue/spring-2021/16977/", "page_content": "When John Huston, Clark Gable, and Marilyn Monroe came to Reno to make a movie \u2018about a world in change,\u2019 the whole town got into the act.\n\nBY JOHN GOODE\n\nThis story originally appeared in the November/December 1986 issue of Nevada Magazine.\n\nTwenty-five years ago eager movie buffs filled theaters across the country for the debut of \u201cThe Misfits.\u201d Shot entirely on location in and around Reno, the movie had all the makings of a blockbuster. Directed by John Huston and written by Arthur Miller, it starred Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe, with Eli Wallach, Thelma Ritter, and Mont\u00adgomery Cliff sharing the bill.\n\nBut movie-goers expecting a shoot \u2019em up Gable western or a sexy Monroe comedy were disappointed. Although some critics gave it four stars, others panned it. Still, it remains a classic.\n\nThe story was based on Nevada reality. In 1956 Miller, seeking a divorce, spent his six weeks\u2019 resid\u00adency in a cabin near Pyramid Lake. While there he met three Nevada mustangers who impressed him as being \u201cthe last three unreconstructed originals in the United States.\u201d\n\nSo begins author James Goode in \u201cThe Making of The Misfits.\u201d First printed in 1963 and repub\u00adlished this year, the book is a day-by-day account of the movie\u2019s production, which brought some of film\u00addom\u2019s best known figures to the Nevada desert. Here Goode describes the arrival of the Hollywood misfits.\n\nJULY 18, 1960 \u2014 This morning, at nine o\u2019clock, \u201cThe Misfits\u201d company, directed by John Huston, began shooting a series of random Reno scenes devised by Arthur Miller to alternate with the title and credits and establish the setting of the picture. These title shots, made without the principal actors, might have been photographed at any time, but the plan is to shoot in strict script sequence throughout, to enable the actors to stay in the context of meaning as the intricate play unfolds; the day\u2019s shooting also serves to bring the crew together as a unit under Huston. The crew itself was incredibly swift, set\u00adting up camera, lights, and sound within 15 minutes at each new location and strik\u00ading in the same time, loading and unload\u00ading three large trucks of gear at each stop in 104-degree temperature, providing power for the heavy lights from a large gasoline generator.\n\nThe scenes appear to be an unrehearsed look at Reno but are not in fact. For one short sequence, showing a wedding dress revolving in the Virginia Street window of Joseph Magnin, the second assistant direc\u00adtor, Carl Beringer, found aging Freddy Parker in a Commercial Row saloon, saw him as a perfect cinematic drunk, and took him back to the waiting camera. It was no good because Parker, off a bar stool, froze into unrewarding poses. Beringer found it necessary to spend $20 on whiskey before Parker could freely implement Huston\u2019s idea, to whirl drunkenly in balletic parody of the revolving wedding dress.\n\nThe camera moved on to a pawnshop window, created by art director Steve Grimes, which displayed a sad collection of useless male artifacts traded in for another chance on the unremitting Reno slots; then to the slot machines themselves, anthropomorphic cast iron or carved wood replicas of western badmen, with the usual long chrome lever in place of one arm, each with plaster eyes more evil than the last. This surrealistic touch was fol\u00adlowed by a look at long rows of the stand\u00adard slot machines and crap tables in action in the gambling clubs, in Arthur Miller\u2019s words \u201ca sea of cold chrome.\u201d\n\nThe title shots ended with a bride and groom being escorted by Reno Junior Chamber of Commerce-types in western dress into a \u201cBlack Mariah\u201d with accompa\u00adnying gunfire, and driven under the Vir\u00adginia Street neon sign, RENO, THE BIGGEST LITTLE CITY IN THE WORLD. The bride closed the sequence by returning to her job as a blackjack dealer in the Mapes Hotel casino, still in her white wedding gown, the veil in place. The groom, Walter Ramage, returned to his office. Huston, in the first of a long series of appearances in the casino, celebrated the end of the first day\u2019s shooting by winning $175.\n\nJuly 20 \u2014 Today\u2019s shooting call, listing the cast and crew needed for the day and posted in the Mapes Hotel lobby, was for 8 a.m., an hour earlier than usual. The rea\u00adson was a scene showing Clark Gable, as Gay Langland, saying good-by to a St. Louis divorcee at the Southern Pacific train station in the center of town. One of the first scenes in the picture, it called for the lady to board the train and wave good\u00adby as the train pulled out. Since the cost of a special train would have been prohibi\u00adtive, even if one had been available, it was necessary to use the Overland Limited heading west from Chicago to San Fran\u00adcisco, holding it for a few minutes longer than usual. A train heading east might have been more accurate, but there were none during daylight hours.\n\nPlaying opposite Gable in this brief scene was blonde Marietta Tree, socialite and friend of John Huston, and most fa\u00admous for the Democratic political salon that she runs in her upper-Eastside man\u00adsion in New York. Mrs. Tree had not intended to appear in the picture, but had simply stopped off to see Huston on her way to San Francisco. The day before, Huston had interviewed a local actress who was to play the part of the departing St. Louis divorcee, and had decided against using her. Gable, Huston, and Mrs. Tree were talking later at lunch when Gable suddenly said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have that one over there?\u201d meaning that Mrs. Tree could very well play the part. Mrs. Tree protested, saying that she wasn\u2019t an actress, and not the type. Gable replied that she was just the type he wanted.\n\nAs the train pulled in at 8:25, discharging passengers, Gable and Mrs. Tree began the farewell scene, establishing Gay Langland\u2019s character as a Reno cowboy who has had frequent affairs with women in town for divorce actions, and also as a man who can\u2019t be bought and who refuses to be tied down. Mrs. Tree, as Susan, said, \u201cWill you think about it? It\u2019s the second largest laundry in St. Louis!\u201d Gay replied, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to kid you, Susan. I ain\u2019t cut out for business \u2026. \u201d\n\nMrs. Tree, as Susan, was crying as she boarded the train and waved good-by from a window as the train pulled out of the station. She said later that she was scared silly about the moving train; knowing Huston\u2019s elaborate practical jokes, she feared that he had given the engineer instructions to keep right on going to San Francisco. But the train stopped after a few feet and backed up into position again for an additional shot. In this one, Guido (Eli Wallach), a garage mechanic, pulling up to a lowered signal at the track, sees Gay and invites him over to Harrah\u2019s for a drink.\n\nCompleting the shot, with tiny micro\u00adphones on sticks at ground level and inside Gable\u2019s shirt, the crew struck the lights and moved on to the next location, a two\u00ad-story frame house belonging to the Reno USO and chosen by Steve Grimes as a likely boardinghouse for Roslyn (Marilyn Monroe) and her friend Isabelle (Thelma Ritter). Monroe had not yet arrived in Reno, but she wasn\u2019t required for the first shots at the USO.\n\nThe script called for the arrival of Guido in his garage truck to appraise Roslyn\u2019s new Cadillac convertible, a present from her husband in Chicago. Roslyn, it seems, would like to dispose of both the Cadillac and the husband. Isabelle says in the script that Reno men keep running into Roslyn\u2019s Cadillac just to start conversations, so it was necessary to pound dents into the body of the new car with a sledge hammer. The usual crowd of Reno onlookers winced with each blow, but the crew itself was calm, offering advice to the grip with the hammer.\n\nThelma Ritter appeared for the first time in this scene, her left arm in a sling and carrying a broken alarm clock in her other hand, and speaking in one of the memorable voices of the screen.\n\nThe afternoon was also marked by the arrival of Marilyn Monroe at the Reno airport. Arthur Miller, Frank Taylor, a United Artists publicity man, \u201cThe Misfits\u201d still photographer, Al St. Hilaire, a few members of the Reno press, a newsreel photographer, and 200 fans were on hand when a United DC-7 landed at 2:45. In a preview of what was to happen throughout the filming of \u201cThe Mis\u00adfits,\u201d America\u2019s oldest enfant terrible did not emerge from the plane for 30 minutes. No one seemed to mind, and everyone waited patiently as she walked to the passenger gate, accompanied by Miller, Rupert Allan, her press representative, and Sydney Guilaroff, who had arranged her hair on the plane. She looked very young in a white blouse and skirt, and was already in char\u00adacter as Roslyn in the upswept platinum wig that she would wear during the pic\u00adture. There were a few words of welcome, a presentation of flowers by the wife and daughter of the governor, and Monroe was escorted to Taylor\u2019s Thunderbird for a triumphant ride down Virginia Street to the Mapes Hotel. Taylor was hoping to get pictures for the wire services and news\u00adreels of Monroe perched on the back of the open car under the sign, RENO, THE BIGGEST LITTLE \u2026. He did, and Monroe disappeared into the Mapes and her suite on the top floor. It was later explained that the delay at the airport occurred because Miss Monroe was changing her clothes in the ladies\u2019 room on the plane.\n\nJuly 21 \u2014 Montgomery Clift and Kevin McCarthy both arrived in Reno today, McCarthy for a three-day appearance as Mr. Taber, Roslyn\u2019s husband, who comes from Chicago to ask Roslyn to reconsider the divorce.\n\nJuly 23 \u2014 ln his suite at the Mapes Hotel that afternoon, Huston tried to explain \u201cfor what,\u201d and to tell why he had decided to direct \u201cThe Misfits.\u201d As he spoke, he drew a succession of ink portraits of this writer, and smoked innumerable Gauloises cigarettes.\n\n\u201cI got the script in the mail with a letter from Arthur Miller. He was unbelievably modest. He asked me if it had any value. I read it and immediately cabled that I liked it very much \u2026.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s behind it? It is about people who sell their work but won\u2019t sell them\u00adselves. Anybody who holds out is a mis\u00adfit. If he loses, he is a failure, and if he is successful, he is rare. This movie is about a world in change. There was meaning in our lives before World War II, but we have lost meaning now. Now the cowboys ride pickup trucks and a rodeo rider is an actor of sorts. Once they sold the wild horses for children\u2019s ponies. And now for dog food. This is a dog-eat-horse society.\n\n\u201cThe part of Gay Langland is a point that should be underscored now, not as a preachment. It reveals itself dramatically. He\u2019s the same man but the world has changed. Then he was noble. Now he is ignoble.\u201d\n\nJuly 25 \u2014 After rushes, the party walked to Harrah\u2019s Club on Virginia Street, where the company was shooting a scene from the script in which Gay and Guido meet Roslyn and Isabelle in the bar in Har\u00adrah\u2019s. This marked the first time Gable had played opposite Monroe and the entire company was on hand.\n\nIt was also the first time in years that Harrah\u2019s Club, open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, had been closed to the public. The stars emerged from their trailers parked at the curb, and policemen kept a crowd of 300 people from surging through the doorless air-curtain entrance. The atmosphere inside was realistic, jarred only in the bar where the lights, sound boom, and camera were already in place. A casual group of 75 extras, all hired in Reno for $10 a day, milled through the dice and roulette tables and around the slot machines, but did not play. The famil\u00adiar sounds were absent, and even the air \u00adconditioning had been turned off to permit recording. The normal shift of Har\u00adrah\u2019s dealers, pit bosses, and waitresses stood silently at hand, the dealers losing about $10 a day in tips, Bill Harrah losing an estimated $50,000 each day in gam\u00adbling revenue in exchange for the refer\u00adences to his club in the script.\n\nThe scene began with Gable and Wal\u00adlach on adjoining bar stools with their backs to the camera, Monroe, and Ritter. Langland\u2019s hound, Tom Dooley, was beside a stool. In the script, Roslyn sees the dog and calls to it. Langland notices that his dog is missing, sees Roslyn, and advan\u00b7ces upon her. Guido and Langland are introduced by Isabelle, who has met Guido at the boardinghouse, and the issue is joined. Marilyn Monroe was very ner\u00advous, Tom Dooley was unmanageable, and the scene was long, but Huston got the company out of Harrah\u2019s in a day and a half, a day and a half ahead of the esti\u00admated three-day shutdown, to Bill Har\u00adrah\u2019s vast relief."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055184/reviews", "page_content": "10 /10\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\nThis movie has generated a huge following in since it was made due to the acting by it's leads and directing (John Huston), but it is best known as \"the final movie\" of the stars. It was the final film for Clark Gable. Indeed, it killed Gable due to the scene where he stupidly did his own stunt of trying to restrain a wild horse. However, it was not the last film for Marilyn Monroe. She began work on a film with George Cukor which she was fired from and which was never completed. Since Monty Clift was also in it many people claim it was his last film too. Actually he made several complete films after it, including FREUD (also by John Huston). Thelma Ritter lived until 1969, and she was still making plenty of films until then. Estelle Winwood would reach her 100th year, and was still making films up to a decade before that. As for Kevin McCarthy and Eli Wallach - they are both ('bless 'em) going strong. However the final scene of the script gave a coda to Gable's and Monroe's career. This helps make the public point of view about the film understandable.\n\n\n\nIn his later years, Gable popped up in a series of films where his co-star was a leading lady of similar popular following, who was usually younger than him but his feminine sexual equivalent. These included TEACHER'S PET (with Doris Day) and IT STARTED IN NAPLES (with Sophia Loren). The film he did with Monroe (their only film together) was THE MISFITS, and it was not a comedy.\n\n\n\nTHE MISFITS was supposed to be a philosophical drama about why people can't be loners but have to find their way into some group where they are acceptable to each other. Philosophical films are very difficult ones to turn into box office gold. People go to films as an escape and rarely to feed their brains. But Marilyn's then husband (dramatist Arthur Miller) wrote the screenplay for the film. At the time the Miller-Monroe marriage was collapsing, and this may be why the screenplay seems to be lopsided. Marilyn's character \"Rosalind Taber\" seems to be flighty at points, but at other points too deep. We first see her willing to get through her divorce with Kevin McCarthy (who does a lot with his one brief scene in the film trying to stop the divorce). This shows determination - she even gives a vague reason to McCarthy that it was his fault for keeping her on the shelf while he concentrated on his career. Yet she shows a flakiness too. She tells Thelma Ritter she never wants to see an expensive car that was given to her again.\n\n\n\nThis follows her throughout the film. She is introduced to these modern cowboys through cab driver Eli Wallach (\"Guido\"), and she takes an offer from him to go up to his country house to chill out. Gable and Ritter accompany them. But soon she is showing a different personality: she is a mother-earth figure. Wallach is an ex military pilot who was married, but whose wife died in a fluke situation while pregnant (his car lacked a tire, and he could not rush her to the hospital). Marilyn tries to get to the bottom of Wallach's feelings and it is obvious that Wallach does not want to discuss this. Gable (\"Gay Langdon\") seems more settled - but we learn that daughter and son keep him at arm's length due to his tendency to carouse and get drunk. Marilyn and Gable do turn each other on, but Marilyn is upset by Gable's matter-of-fact feelings about animals like horses and rabbits.\n\n\n\nMontgomery Clift (\"Perce Howland) comes in later in the film when he joins the group headed for a rodeo. All of them have attended rodeos except Monroe. She is horrified at the injuries the cowboys get. Clift gets injured but while he and the other men accept his injuries as normal, Monroe wants to scream about them. Clift also has personal family problems: his mother remarried and the man has basically pushed Clift out of his property rights to his father's ranch. But the lack of his mother's interest in him (she is totally enthralled by the new husband) is what hurts him the most.\n\n\n\nEven the fifth wheel of this ensemble, Ritter (\"Isabelle Steers\") has a serious family problem that makes her a misfit (albeit one who has learned to accept it). Her husband left her for a best friend of her's years before, and has never paid her alimony - he sends her a potted rose once a year. At the end she leaves the film before the conclusion: she meets the husband and her best friend at the rodeo, and they go to her home to spend a few days! Ritter's character is a realist when she is not involved - she keeps warning Marilyn about cowboys and their ways - but she can be remarkably weak in defending her own rights and feelings.\n\n\n\nHow they all come to terms (or fail to come to terms) with their family and personality failures is what I leave to the viewers. It is worthwhile to watch this film to it's emotional climax (the scene with the wild horses), where Monroe's character finally gets her real voice - and Monroe achieved her acting height outside of her performance as \"Cherie\" in BUS STOP). But it is achieved at a ridiculous cost: as mentioned before Gable had to do his own stunt in that scene. The follow-up scene really shows how he was too old for it.\n\n\n\nThere is also that lovely coda: Clark and Marilyn in the pick-up truck looking at the star in the sky that Clark says is his guide. It does sort of seem an appropriate sign-off for those two movie icons."}, {"url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/the-misfits-review-when-art-and-life-collide-1.2251619", "page_content": "The Misfits \ue9d9 \ue9d9 \ue9d9 \ue9d9 \ue9d7 Director : John Huston Cert : Club Genre : Drama Starring : Clark Gable, Marilyn Monroe, Montgomery Clift, Thelma Ritter, Eli Wallach Running Time : 2 hrs 15 mins\n\nRosalyn, a beautiful divorcee (Monroe) and her wise-cracking friend (Ritter) are invited to stay with an ageing cowboy (Gable) and his friend (Wallach).

Of course we\u2019re still fascinated by her: She was gorgeous, talented as both a singer and an actress, and possessed a pride over her curvy figure that\u2019s still inspiring today.\n\nThat last part is also why we still find scenes she did naked totally fascinating: At a time when women were discouraged from even acknowledging sex, Marilyn Monroe embraced her sexuality.But she may have been even more of a trailblazer than we first thought. Though she appeared nude in the first-ever issue of Playboy (albeit in photos picked up from another photographer\u2014she didn\u2019t actually pose for the magazine itself), it\u2019s long believed that her first-ever nude film scene would have been in Something\u2019s Got to Give, the uncompleted movie she was making when she passed away.\n\nNow, reports the Daily Mail, an author named Charles Custillo, while researching for his biography, Marilyn Monroe: The Private Life of a Public Icon, has discovered a heretofore unknown nude scene from the film The Misfits. In the footage, Monroe, following a love scene with costar Clark Gable, drops a bedsheet and reveals her totally naked body. Not only that, it would have been the first fully-nude scene by an American actress in a film had the movie\u2019s director, John Huston, (dad of icon Anjelica Huston) not cut it from the final version.\n\nThe movie was written by Arthur Miller, Marilyn Monroe\u2019s husband at the time, but the idea to drop the sheet was all Marilyn\u2019s idea. Custillo found the footage in the home of Curtice Taylor, son of the movie\u2019s producer Frank Taylor. According to Custillo:\n\nHe said: \"If you read [The Misfits] script\u2026 it doesn\u2019t say anything about nudity\u2026 When she did the scene, everyone was shocked on the set. 'Huston sighed and said, \"Honey, I\u2019ve seen them before\" Gable and others\u2026 wanted [it] to be left in. Huston didn\u2019t\u2026 because he felt it\u2026 was totally unnecessary to the scene.\"\n\nThough the scene in question is only 45 seconds long, Taylor said he thought it made the love seen between Monroe and Gable \u201cmore passionate.\u201d The footage had been in a locked cabinet since 1999, when his father died. It was long assumed destroyed, since most of the movie\u2019s unused takes were disposed of by people associated with the production. Frank Taylor just happened to save this one. Wonder why...\n\n'Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe in The Misfits.' (Image credit: Keystone-France)\n\nTBD whether the scene in question is going to be released for public consumption (it still belongs to Curtice Taylor), but the fact that would have been the first nude scene by an American actress gives it a lot of historical importance.

The status of this 1961 drama gained an additional burst by the fact that it was the last film Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe ever worked on, but its value hardly lies in trivialities like this. The main strengths of Huston\u2019s celebrated film can be found in superb acting by Monroe, Gable, Montgomery Clift and Thelma Ritter, as well as Arthur Miller\u2019s genuinely inspired script and director of photography Russell Metty\u2019s astonishing black-and-white visuals. In its production phase, the film basically had to go through hell.\n\nOne of the myths attached to The Misfits was that Gable died of a heart attack because of over-exertion on this film. This is utter nonsense. Toward the end of the picture there was a contest between Clark and the stallion the cowboys had captured. It looked like rough work, and it was, but it was the stunt men who were thrown around, not Clark. \u2014John Huston\n\n\n\nFilmed in northern Nevada\u2019s unbearable heat, The Misfits proved to be the perfect arena for the crew\u2019s battle with their inner demons. John Huston drank a lot back in those days, allegedly falling asleep during filming; Marilyn Monroe and writer Arthur Miller\u2019s marriage was at the point of a devastating collapse, so she completely gave herself away to alcohol and drugs. But the fact is that what the crew delivered in The Misfits is perhaps some of the greatest moments of their entire careers. The flash of the film\u2019s stellar cast, however, didn\u2019t distract the critics, who noted and deservedly praised Huston\u2019s approach as a new take on the western genre.

The Golden Age of Hollywood saw a deluge of filmmakers who are now almost regarded as gods, such as Orson Welles and Billy Wilder, but few can claim to be even as remotely chaotic as John Huston, who had made his feature debut in 1941 and would continue until his death in 1987. Huston was, in a sense, the sort of hypermasculine auteur modern movie buffs would have an uneasy relationship with, from his famously gruff voice to his devil-may-care attitude to making his movies; in reality, he was a Hemingway-esque figure, a man so brimming with masculine energy that he threatened to implode.\n\nNot unlike how Ernest Hemingway\u2019s writings were conjoined inexplicably with the man\u2019s chronic battles with physical injuries and mental illness, Huston\u2019s films often gave us insight into a violent flame that stood on the brink of being snuffed out, and as such, there is a kind of emotional honesty and brutality to Huston\u2019s work. Reading about the production behind a Huston film can, at times, be just as enthralling as watching the film itself.\n\nThings to do:\n\nWhen \u2018The Misfits\u2019 hit American theaters in February 1961, Huston had been in the business for twenty years, having won two Oscars for his troubles (for \u2018The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\u2019), and he already had an impressive list of behind-the-scenes stories behind him. We don\u2019t need to get into how everyone on the set of \u2018The African Queen\u2019 was miserable (when not physically ill), or how Huston\u2019s adaptation of Moby Dick ran the gamut from the expensive whale model getting lost at sea to Huston and screenwriter Ray Bradbury (yes, that Ray Bradbury) butting heads.\n\nOf all these, though, none are as purely tragic as the story behind \u2018The Misfits,\u2019 the film that would prove to skeptics that Marilyn Monroe was a real actress \u2014 and which would end up featuring her final performance. True, Monroe was working on \u2018Something\u2019s Got to Give\u2019 at the time of her death, but the film went unfinished, and so \u2018The Misfits\u2019 stood as her last will and testament. Not only that, but on paper, the cast and crew \u2014 no, the sheer hurricane of talent being funneled into \u2018The Misfits\u2019 should have made the film a dream, both in front of and behind the camera; instead, it proved to be a breaking point for some of the people involved.\n\nHuston had already collaborated with Ray Bradbury, one of America\u2019s literary heavyweights, and for \u2018The Misfits\u2019 he would continue that streak \u2014 this time with Pulitzer Prize-winner Arthur Miller, who also happened to be married to Marilyn Monroe at the time. Miller adapted one of his own short stories, also titled \u2018The Misfits,\u2019 for the film, with his wife as the heroine in mind. Alongside Monroe were Clark Gable, most famous as the male lead in \u2018Gone with the Wind,\u2019 Eli Wallach, who would later become most famous as the anti-hero Tuco in \u2018The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\u2019 and Montgomery Clift, a young star whose career was derailing due to a car accident in 1956.\n\nRelated video: Full Commentary \u2013 Cast & Crew Spills Secrets on Making of \u2018Elvis\u2019 | In-Depth Scoop | Austin Butler\n\nRelated video: Full Rendezvous At the Premiere of \u2018Elvis\u2019 with Reactions from Stars | Austin Butler, Baz Luhrmann\n\nRelated video: Come Behind The Scenes of \u2018Elvis\u2019 | Austin Butler, Tom Hanks and Baz Luhrmann\n\nRelated article: MUST WATCH \u2013 The Hollywood Insider\u2019s CEO Pritan Ambroase\u2019s Love Letter to Black Lives Matter \u2013 VIDEO\n\nRelated article: Why Queen Elizabeth II Is One Of The Greatest Monarchs | Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of United Queendom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland (Video Insight)\n\nRelated article: All Best Actor/Actress Speeches From The Beginning Of Oscars 1929-2019 | Hollywood Insider\n\nOf the four stars, only Wallach would make it past 60: Monroe died in 1962, at the age of 36, Clift would die in 1966 at the age of 45, and Gable died mere days after filming for \u2018The Misfits\u2019 had wrapped. The film was released on February 1, on what would have been Gable\u2019s 60th birthday. On the set, drug problems plagued Monroe and Clift, and Monroe had things doubly bad, on account of the fact that her marriage to Miller was eroding; by the time the movie hit theaters, the two had parted ways.\n\nThe Short Unhappy Life of Marilyn Monroe\n\nThere is an alternate timeline, not too different from ours, where Marilyn Monroe had a long and successful career as a film actress; alas, Monroe\u2019s acting career had a number of false starts, and she died young. Born in 1926, Monroe started taking roles when she was barely out of her teens, appearing in B-movie schlock that has long since been forgotten before landing minor roles in Joseph L. Mankiewicz\u2019s \u2018All About Eve\u2019 and Huston\u2019s own \u2018The Asphalt Jungle,\u2019 both in 1950, both also being held as classics. Still, it would take a few more years for Monroe to land a lead role of any significance, with \u2018Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\u2019 in 1953, directed by Howard Hawks and co-starring Jane Russell, and this cemented her status as a sex symbol of the 1950s \u2014 for better and worse.\n\nIn her short career, Monroe managed to work with such astounding Golden Age directors as Hawks, Mankiewicz, Huston, and even Billy Wilder, yet despite all these projects, she struggled to be taken seriously as an actress; for all her fame, she died without getting even one Oscar nomination. Being pigeonholed as a promiscuous empty-headed blonde when in reality she was anything but (not helped by the fact that she was a three-time divorcee by the end of it all, at a time when divorce was a taboo subject), Monroe had her beauty turned against her. \u2018The Misfits\u2019 was set to be the one, the role that would make Monroe\u2019s career, and how could she fail? She had Huston, who had previously worked with her, and she had her then-husband writing her lines. What could go wrong?\n\nRelated article: The Hollywood Insider\u2019s CEO Pritan Ambroase: \u201cThe Importance of Venice Film Festival as the Protector of Cinema\u201d\n\nRelated article: The Masters of Cinema Archives: The Hollywood Insider Pays Tribute to \u2018La Vie En Rose\u2019, Exclusive Interview with Director Olivier Dahan\n\nRelated article: \u2013 Want GUARANTEED SUCCESS?

For another, it turns out that having the screenwriter and the leading lady be in a relationship may not be the best idea; not only did Miller keep revising his screenplay mid-production, but Monroe resented her character being modeled after herself. The movie follows a young divorcee and former nightclub dancer (hmmm) who moves to Reno, striking up a friendship and business partnership with an aging cowboy (Gable) and his volatile WWII veteran friend (Wallach), as the three try to make it in the Nevada desert.\n\nThe film, by the way, was actually shot in the Nevada desert, in scorching heat, which probably didn\u2019t help matters. Curiously, despite on-set tensions with Huston and Miller, Monroe befriended a scarred and drug-addled Montgomery Clift, and the surprisingly platonic friendship between their characters on-screen hints at a genuine off-screen friendship between kindred spirits. As said before, Monroe and Clift suffered from drug addiction during production \u2014 battles they would eventually lose, and it must also be said that despite these personal troubles, they both carried through on-screen wonderfully. Indeed, Monroe\u2019s performance in \u2018The Misfits\u2019 could be her very best; she exudes a tragic femininity trying to transcend itself in spite of all the men in her life disappointing her.\n\nRelated article: A Tribute to Johnny Depp: The Actor and Musician Who Defined Range\n\nRelated video: EVOLUTION: Every Johnny Depp Role From 1984 to 2020, All Performances Exceptionally Poignant\n\nRelated article: A Tribute to the Hero & President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: Comedian/Actor, Ukraine\u2019s President and Heroic Leader\n\nA Swan Song for Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age\n\nIn 1961, Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age was coming to an end, although this would not have been apparent to most people yet. As far as moviegoers and filmmakers were concerned, 1961 was part of the 1950s, in spirit if not literally; after all, one of the highest-grossing films of 1960 was Stanley Kubrick\u2019s sword-and-sandals epic \u2018Spartacus,\u2019 a movie that would almost surely not have done as well if released a decade later. Regardless, the Golden Age was in its twilight years \u2014 a twilight that would then turn pitch black with the financial disaster that was Joseph L. Mankiewicz\u2019s \u2018Cleopatra\u2019 in 1963. \u2018The Misfits\u2019 starred three Golden Age legends, all of whom were at the ends of their careers, being the last rodeo for Monroe and Gable in particular.\n\nIt would also be the last time Huston would put 100% of himself into his filmmaking for at least a decade, afterward directing a string of forgettable or regrettable features until the critical hit of \u2018Fat City\u2019 in 1972, at which point he had virtually reinvented himself. \u2018The Misfits\u2019 also occupies an interesting space as a Western that doesn\u2019t fit into the classic Western mode (no gunfights, no saloon brawls, no villain in a black suit) while also not quite anticipating the transformation the Western would experience in the coming years. As such, \u2018The Misfits\u2019 stands, perhaps better than any other movie, as a line in the sand, between the Golden Age Hollywood production and the grittier, more socially conscious New Hollywood productions that were to emerge in the 1960s.\n\nRelated article: EVOLUTION: Every Henry Cavill Role From 2001 to 2021, All Performances Exceptionally Poignant\n\nRelated article: EVOLUTION: Every Chris Evans Role From 1997 to 2020, All Performances Exceptionally Poignant\n\nRelated article: #metoo Revolution: Powerful Questions That Need Answers\n\nRelated article: FACT-CHECKED Series: Timothee Chalamet and 32 Facts about The Young Superstar\n\nDespite its making being a torture for those involved, and despite its initial reception being underwhelming, \u2018The Misfits\u2019 comes out as a triumph. Not only are the four leads incredible, with all of them embodying complex and troubled characters with disturbing ease, but you probably wouldn\u2019t think Miller had kept fiddling with the screenplay during shooting, since while the structure is not a strict three-act one that we would expect, it gives plenty of air to breathe for the characters. The vast Nevada landscape is gorgeous, and there are some bird\u2019s-eye-view shots that are pretty remarkable for the time, with Huston proving once again that he could make great movies \u2014 in spite of himself. Most importantly, \u2018The Misfits\u2019 might be the strongest argument in favor of Monroe\u2019s potential as an actress, giving a dexterous performance that is at once tender and overflowing with emotion \u2014 the kind of performance any actor would be proud of. Hollywood was about to go through some serious changes, and in so doing would leave Monroe, Clift, and the others behind, but with the gift of hindsight, we can now appreciate a masterpiece for what it is.\n\nSadly, \u2018The Misfits\u2019 is not currently available to stream anywhere, but it is available to rent digitally. The movie itself is certainly worth a few dollars and your time.\n\nBest of luck to Ana de Armas playing Marilyn Monroe in \u2018Blonde\u2019.\n\nBy Brian Collins\n\nClick here to read The Hollywood Insider\u2019s CEO Pritan Ambroase\u2019s love letter to Cinema, TV and Media.

Email Sign up\n\nIt\u2019s also why a film can end up terrific despite the odds. Take, for example, John Huston\u2019s The Misfits (1961), starring Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable and Montgomery Clift. Now, before you say, \u201cWell, of course it was always going to be great with that cast, that director, and that writer on board,\u201d let\u2019s bear a few things in mind. Okay, Arthur Miller, then America\u2019s most respected playwright, wrote the film as \u2018a valentine\u2019 for his wife Monroe. But remember that he had next to no experience as a writer for the screen, that the marriage was on the rocks (they divorced shortly before the film\u2019s premiere in early 1961), and Monroe was in many ways a wreck, dependent on alcohol and prescription drugs, having difficulties with remembering her lines and turning up on time at the set. Director John Huston was often drunk, and apparently not averse to falling asleep on set. He would often display more interest in gambling than in the job at hand.\n\nThe Misfits (1961)\n\nThen there were the two male leads. The success of Clark Gable \u2013 a Hollywood star par excellence \u2013 had always rested rather more on his rugged masculinity, good looks and easy charm than on any particular range, depth or subtlety as an actor. Moreover, the postwar years had not been good for him, and even he regarded many of the roles offered by MGM as unsatisfactory.\n\nAs for Montgomery Clift, yes, he had been a performer of a different order, and for a decade he was undoubtedly one of the finest actors in Hollywood; but after his car accident in 1956, his health went downhill in all kinds of ways, and it tended to show on screen.\n\nIn other words, despite the big names, The Misfits didn\u2019t have too much going for it. Eli Wallach, Thelma Ritter and Kevin McCarthy were around to provide excellent support for the three stars, and few cinematographers could rival Russell Metty, whose CV included visual gems like Bringing Up Baby (1938), Touch of Evil (1958), Spartacus (1960) and a whole host of eye-catching Douglas Sirk titles. But a film usually needs a little more than superior camerawork and fine actors in minor roles to ensure its role as a classic.\n\nThe Misfits (1961)\n\nIndeed, just as the initial omens were not promising, so the film\u2019s release \u2013 it barely broke even \u2013 didn\u2019t suggest that it would in time become regarded as an important movie for all concerned and something we\u2019d still be watching more than half a century later.\n\nSerendipity played its part in The Misfits\u2019 long-term status, and not only because Gable, Monroe and Clift, notwithstanding the problematic shoot, ended up giving memorably fine performances. As it happened, it turned out to be the last completed film for both Gable (who died just 10 days after filming finished) and Monroe (who lived on for another year and a half). For his part, Clift had only two further major roles before his own demise in 1966.\n\nThe film\u2019s consequent association with premature death (though Gable, admittedly, was, at 59, no spring chicken) and the kind of celebrity worship which that can provoke hasn\u2019t harmed its reputation one bit. But I\u2019d suggest there\u2019s more to the film\u2019s enduring value than that kind of slightly morbid cult interest.\n\nThe Misfits (1961)\n\nAlongside the heartfelt performances, The Misfits is memorable for the way Metty\u2019s black-and-white cinematography creates taut, fraught, resonant relationships between the characters (and between humans and horses) in the Nevada desert. But perhaps most rewarding of all is how the almost palpable atmosphere of pain, disappointment and ubiquitous mortality reinforces, complicates and enriches the script\u2019s sometimes trite conception of damaged masculine souls (the ranchers and rodeo-riders played by Gable, Clift and Wallach) redeemed by their encounter with a woman (Monroe\u2019s divorcee Roslyn). Roslyn is essentially presented as a life-force corrective to their apparent indifference regarding the suffering of all the gentle, innocent and beautiful creatures on this earth.\n\nDue to their various personal circumstances, Gable, Clift and Monroe come across as fragile, vulnerable, indecisive and not quite sure where they\u2019re headed or why. That rather muddies Miller\u2019s \u2018message\u2019 (which was probably inspired by his own feelings about and experiences with Monroe), which is no bad thing. For all the (strikingly staged and shot) struggles with stallions and so on, the film consequently feels less like some sort of poetic fable about primal forces, and more like something recognisably human in scale and nature.\n\nThe Misfits (1961)\n\nMisfits? Hardly. Aren\u2019t these folks actually just like the rest of us, trying to get by while turning a blind eye to the inevitable? Huston may have been stewed a lot of the time during shooting, but the film has more in common with his very finest works \u2013 The Asphalt Jungle (1950), Fat City (1972) and The Dead (1987) \u2013 than might at first be apparent. In his book The American Cinema, critic Andrew Sarris famously included Huston in the \u2018Less than Meets the Eye\u2019 category of directors. I\u2019d venture to suggest that with The Misfits, thanks in no small part to serendipity, the contrary might be the case."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Misfits", "page_content": "The Misfits, American film drama, released in 1961, that is perhaps best remembered as the final movie of screen legends Marilyn Monroe and Clark Gable.\n\nThe Misfits, directed by John Huston, is a contemporary tale of the West that centres on aging cowboys. Out of their element in the modern world, they now herd wild \u201cmisfit\u201d horses from their trucks and sell them to be killed and cheaply sold as pet food. Monroe played a troubled ex-stripper who falls in love with Gable\u2019s cowboy character but is appalled at the capture and fate of these once-free animals. The parallel in the plot is thinly disguised: the hopeless plight of the horses mirrors that of their captors.\n\nBritannica Quiz Oscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nPlaywright Arthur Miller wrote the script specifically for Monroe, his wife, though their marriage would disintegrate during production of the film. The publicity surrounding The Misfits centred on Monroe\u2019s real-life problems, unreliable work habits, and temper tantrums. Gable died about a week after the film was finished, and within a year of its release Monroe was dead from a drug overdose. Costar Montgomery Clift made only three films after The Misfits, dying in 1966 at age 45. The scenes depicting the roundup of wild horses are particularly well staged, and Gable\u2019s insistence on doing many of his own stunts might have contributed to the heart attack that killed him."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055184/reviews", "page_content": "10 /10\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\nThis movie has generated a huge following in since it was made due to the acting by it's leads and directing (John Huston), but it is best known as \"the final movie\" of the stars. It was the final film for Clark Gable. Indeed, it killed Gable due to the scene where he stupidly did his own stunt of trying to restrain a wild horse. However, it was not the last film for Marilyn Monroe. She began work on a film with George Cukor which she was fired from and which was never completed. Since Monty Clift was also in it many people claim it was his last film too. Actually he made several complete films after it, including FREUD (also by John Huston). Thelma Ritter lived until 1969, and she was still making plenty of films until then. Estelle Winwood would reach her 100th year, and was still making films up to a decade before that. As for Kevin McCarthy and Eli Wallach - they are both ('bless 'em) going strong. However the final scene of the script gave a coda to Gable's and Monroe's career. This helps make the public point of view about the film understandable.\n\n\n\nIn his later years, Gable popped up in a series of films where his co-star was a leading lady of similar popular following, who was usually younger than him but his feminine sexual equivalent. These included TEACHER'S PET (with Doris Day) and IT STARTED IN NAPLES (with Sophia Loren). The film he did with Monroe (their only film together) was THE MISFITS, and it was not a comedy.\n\n\n\nTHE MISFITS was supposed to be a philosophical drama about why people can't be loners but have to find their way into some group where they are acceptable to each other. Philosophical films are very difficult ones to turn into box office gold. People go to films as an escape and rarely to feed their brains. But Marilyn's then husband (dramatist Arthur Miller) wrote the screenplay for the film. At the time the Miller-Monroe marriage was collapsing, and this may be why the screenplay seems to be lopsided. Marilyn's character \"Rosalind Taber\" seems to be flighty at points, but at other points too deep. We first see her willing to get through her divorce with Kevin McCarthy (who does a lot with his one brief scene in the film trying to stop the divorce). This shows determination - she even gives a vague reason to McCarthy that it was his fault for keeping her on the shelf while he concentrated on his career. Yet she shows a flakiness too. She tells Thelma Ritter she never wants to see an expensive car that was given to her again.\n\n\n\nThis follows her throughout the film. She is introduced to these modern cowboys through cab driver Eli Wallach (\"Guido\"), and she takes an offer from him to go up to his country house to chill out. Gable and Ritter accompany them. But soon she is showing a different personality: she is a mother-earth figure. Wallach is an ex military pilot who was married, but whose wife died in a fluke situation while pregnant (his car lacked a tire, and he could not rush her to the hospital). Marilyn tries to get to the bottom of Wallach's feelings and it is obvious that Wallach does not want to discuss this. Gable (\"Gay Langdon\") seems more settled - but we learn that daughter and son keep him at arm's length due to his tendency to carouse and get drunk. Marilyn and Gable do turn each other on, but Marilyn is upset by Gable's matter-of-fact feelings about animals like horses and rabbits.\n\n\n\nMontgomery Clift (\"Perce Howland) comes in later in the film when he joins the group headed for a rodeo. All of them have attended rodeos except Monroe. She is horrified at the injuries the cowboys get. Clift gets injured but while he and the other men accept his injuries as normal, Monroe wants to scream about them. Clift also has personal family problems: his mother remarried and the man has basically pushed Clift out of his property rights to his father's ranch. But the lack of his mother's interest in him (she is totally enthralled by the new husband) is what hurts him the most.\n\n\n\nEven the fifth wheel of this ensemble, Ritter (\"Isabelle Steers\") has a serious family problem that makes her a misfit (albeit one who has learned to accept it). Her husband left her for a best friend of her's years before, and has never paid her alimony - he sends her a potted rose once a year. At the end she leaves the film before the conclusion: she meets the husband and her best friend at the rodeo, and they go to her home to spend a few days! Ritter's character is a realist when she is not involved - she keeps warning Marilyn about cowboys and their ways - but she can be remarkably weak in defending her own rights and feelings.\n\n\n\nHow they all come to terms (or fail to come to terms) with their family and personality failures is what I leave to the viewers. It is worthwhile to watch this film to it's emotional climax (the scene with the wild horses), where Monroe's character finally gets her real voice - and Monroe achieved her acting height outside of her performance as \"Cherie\" in BUS STOP). But it is achieved at a ridiculous cost: as mentioned before Gable had to do his own stunt in that scene. The follow-up scene really shows how he was too old for it.\n\n\n\nThere is also that lovely coda: Clark and Marilyn in the pick-up truck looking at the star in the sky that Clark says is his guide. It does sort of seem an appropriate sign-off for those two movie icons."}, {"url": "https://nevadamagazine.com/issue/spring-2021/16977/", "page_content": "When John Huston, Clark Gable, and Marilyn Monroe came to Reno to make a movie \u2018about a world in change,\u2019 the whole town got into the act.\n\nBY JOHN GOODE\n\nThis story originally appeared in the November/December 1986 issue of Nevada Magazine.\n\nTwenty-five years ago eager movie buffs filled theaters across the country for the debut of \u201cThe Misfits.\u201d Shot entirely on location in and around Reno, the movie had all the makings of a blockbuster. Directed by John Huston and written by Arthur Miller, it starred Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe, with Eli Wallach, Thelma Ritter, and Mont\u00adgomery Cliff sharing the bill.\n\nBut movie-goers expecting a shoot \u2019em up Gable western or a sexy Monroe comedy were disappointed. Although some critics gave it four stars, others panned it. Still, it remains a classic.\n\nThe story was based on Nevada reality. In 1956 Miller, seeking a divorce, spent his six weeks\u2019 resid\u00adency in a cabin near Pyramid Lake. While there he met three Nevada mustangers who impressed him as being \u201cthe last three unreconstructed originals in the United States.\u201d\n\nSo begins author James Goode in \u201cThe Making of The Misfits.\u201d First printed in 1963 and repub\u00adlished this year, the book is a day-by-day account of the movie\u2019s production, which brought some of film\u00addom\u2019s best known figures to the Nevada desert. Here Goode describes the arrival of the Hollywood misfits.\n\nJULY 18, 1960 \u2014 This morning, at nine o\u2019clock, \u201cThe Misfits\u201d company, directed by John Huston, began shooting a series of random Reno scenes devised by Arthur Miller to alternate with the title and credits and establish the setting of the picture. These title shots, made without the principal actors, might have been photographed at any time, but the plan is to shoot in strict script sequence throughout, to enable the actors to stay in the context of meaning as the intricate play unfolds; the day\u2019s shooting also serves to bring the crew together as a unit under Huston. The crew itself was incredibly swift, set\u00adting up camera, lights, and sound within 15 minutes at each new location and strik\u00ading in the same time, loading and unload\u00ading three large trucks of gear at each stop in 104-degree temperature, providing power for the heavy lights from a large gasoline generator.\n\nThe scenes appear to be an unrehearsed look at Reno but are not in fact. For one short sequence, showing a wedding dress revolving in the Virginia Street window of Joseph Magnin, the second assistant direc\u00adtor, Carl Beringer, found aging Freddy Parker in a Commercial Row saloon, saw him as a perfect cinematic drunk, and took him back to the waiting camera. It was no good because Parker, off a bar stool, froze into unrewarding poses. Beringer found it necessary to spend $20 on whiskey before Parker could freely implement Huston\u2019s idea, to whirl drunkenly in balletic parody of the revolving wedding dress.\n\nThe camera moved on to a pawnshop window, created by art director Steve Grimes, which displayed a sad collection of useless male artifacts traded in for another chance on the unremitting Reno slots; then to the slot machines themselves, anthropomorphic cast iron or carved wood replicas of western badmen, with the usual long chrome lever in place of one arm, each with plaster eyes more evil than the last. This surrealistic touch was fol\u00adlowed by a look at long rows of the stand\u00adard slot machines and crap tables in action in the gambling clubs, in Arthur Miller\u2019s words \u201ca sea of cold chrome.\u201d\n\nThe title shots ended with a bride and groom being escorted by Reno Junior Chamber of Commerce-types in western dress into a \u201cBlack Mariah\u201d with accompa\u00adnying gunfire, and driven under the Vir\u00adginia Street neon sign, RENO, THE BIGGEST LITTLE CITY IN THE WORLD. The bride closed the sequence by returning to her job as a blackjack dealer in the Mapes Hotel casino, still in her white wedding gown, the veil in place. The groom, Walter Ramage, returned to his office. Huston, in the first of a long series of appearances in the casino, celebrated the end of the first day\u2019s shooting by winning $175.\n\nJuly 20 \u2014 Today\u2019s shooting call, listing the cast and crew needed for the day and posted in the Mapes Hotel lobby, was for 8 a.m., an hour earlier than usual. The rea\u00adson was a scene showing Clark Gable, as Gay Langland, saying good-by to a St. Louis divorcee at the Southern Pacific train station in the center of town. One of the first scenes in the picture, it called for the lady to board the train and wave good\u00adby as the train pulled out. Since the cost of a special train would have been prohibi\u00adtive, even if one had been available, it was necessary to use the Overland Limited heading west from Chicago to San Fran\u00adcisco, holding it for a few minutes longer than usual. A train heading east might have been more accurate, but there were none during daylight hours.\n\nPlaying opposite Gable in this brief scene was blonde Marietta Tree, socialite and friend of John Huston, and most fa\u00admous for the Democratic political salon that she runs in her upper-Eastside man\u00adsion in New York. Mrs. Tree had not intended to appear in the picture, but had simply stopped off to see Huston on her way to San Francisco. The day before, Huston had interviewed a local actress who was to play the part of the departing St. Louis divorcee, and had decided against using her. Gable, Huston, and Mrs. Tree were talking later at lunch when Gable suddenly said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have that one over there?\u201d meaning that Mrs. Tree could very well play the part. Mrs. Tree protested, saying that she wasn\u2019t an actress, and not the type. Gable replied that she was just the type he wanted.\n\nAs the train pulled in at 8:25, discharging passengers, Gable and Mrs. Tree began the farewell scene, establishing Gay Langland\u2019s character as a Reno cowboy who has had frequent affairs with women in town for divorce actions, and also as a man who can\u2019t be bought and who refuses to be tied down. Mrs. Tree, as Susan, said, \u201cWill you think about it? It\u2019s the second largest laundry in St. Louis!\u201d Gay replied, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to kid you, Susan. I ain\u2019t cut out for business \u2026. \u201d\n\nMrs. Tree, as Susan, was crying as she boarded the train and waved good-by from a window as the train pulled out of the station. She said later that she was scared silly about the moving train; knowing Huston\u2019s elaborate practical jokes, she feared that he had given the engineer instructions to keep right on going to San Francisco. But the train stopped after a few feet and backed up into position again for an additional shot. In this one, Guido (Eli Wallach), a garage mechanic, pulling up to a lowered signal at the track, sees Gay and invites him over to Harrah\u2019s for a drink.\n\nCompleting the shot, with tiny micro\u00adphones on sticks at ground level and inside Gable\u2019s shirt, the crew struck the lights and moved on to the next location, a two\u00ad-story frame house belonging to the Reno USO and chosen by Steve Grimes as a likely boardinghouse for Roslyn (Marilyn Monroe) and her friend Isabelle (Thelma Ritter). Monroe had not yet arrived in Reno, but she wasn\u2019t required for the first shots at the USO.\n\nThe script called for the arrival of Guido in his garage truck to appraise Roslyn\u2019s new Cadillac convertible, a present from her husband in Chicago. Roslyn, it seems, would like to dispose of both the Cadillac and the husband. Isabelle says in the script that Reno men keep running into Roslyn\u2019s Cadillac just to start conversations, so it was necessary to pound dents into the body of the new car with a sledge hammer. The usual crowd of Reno onlookers winced with each blow, but the crew itself was calm, offering advice to the grip with the hammer.\n\nThelma Ritter appeared for the first time in this scene, her left arm in a sling and carrying a broken alarm clock in her other hand, and speaking in one of the memorable voices of the screen.\n\nThe afternoon was also marked by the arrival of Marilyn Monroe at the Reno airport. Arthur Miller, Frank Taylor, a United Artists publicity man, \u201cThe Misfits\u201d still photographer, Al St. Hilaire, a few members of the Reno press, a newsreel photographer, and 200 fans were on hand when a United DC-7 landed at 2:45. In a preview of what was to happen throughout the filming of \u201cThe Mis\u00adfits,\u201d America\u2019s oldest enfant terrible did not emerge from the plane for 30 minutes. No one seemed to mind, and everyone waited patiently as she walked to the passenger gate, accompanied by Miller, Rupert Allan, her press representative, and Sydney Guilaroff, who had arranged her hair on the plane. She looked very young in a white blouse and skirt, and was already in char\u00adacter as Roslyn in the upswept platinum wig that she would wear during the pic\u00adture. There were a few words of welcome, a presentation of flowers by the wife and daughter of the governor, and Monroe was escorted to Taylor\u2019s Thunderbird for a triumphant ride down Virginia Street to the Mapes Hotel. Taylor was hoping to get pictures for the wire services and news\u00adreels of Monroe perched on the back of the open car under the sign, RENO, THE BIGGEST LITTLE \u2026. He did, and Monroe disappeared into the Mapes and her suite on the top floor. It was later explained that the delay at the airport occurred because Miss Monroe was changing her clothes in the ladies\u2019 room on the plane.\n\nJuly 21 \u2014 Montgomery Clift and Kevin McCarthy both arrived in Reno today, McCarthy for a three-day appearance as Mr. Taber, Roslyn\u2019s husband, who comes from Chicago to ask Roslyn to reconsider the divorce.\n\nJuly 23 \u2014 ln his suite at the Mapes Hotel that afternoon, Huston tried to explain \u201cfor what,\u201d and to tell why he had decided to direct \u201cThe Misfits.\u201d As he spoke, he drew a succession of ink portraits of this writer, and smoked innumerable Gauloises cigarettes.\n\n\u201cI got the script in the mail with a letter from Arthur Miller. He was unbelievably modest. He asked me if it had any value. I read it and immediately cabled that I liked it very much \u2026.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s behind it? It is about people who sell their work but won\u2019t sell them\u00adselves. Anybody who holds out is a mis\u00adfit. If he loses, he is a failure, and if he is successful, he is rare. This movie is about a world in change. There was meaning in our lives before World War II, but we have lost meaning now. Now the cowboys ride pickup trucks and a rodeo rider is an actor of sorts. Once they sold the wild horses for children\u2019s ponies. And now for dog food. This is a dog-eat-horse society.\n\n\u201cThe part of Gay Langland is a point that should be underscored now, not as a preachment. It reveals itself dramatically. He\u2019s the same man but the world has changed. Then he was noble. Now he is ignoble.\u201d\n\nJuly 25 \u2014 After rushes, the party walked to Harrah\u2019s Club on Virginia Street, where the company was shooting a scene from the script in which Gay and Guido meet Roslyn and Isabelle in the bar in Har\u00adrah\u2019s. This marked the first time Gable had played opposite Monroe and the entire company was on hand.\n\nIt was also the first time in years that Harrah\u2019s Club, open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, had been closed to the public. The stars emerged from their trailers parked at the curb, and policemen kept a crowd of 300 people from surging through the doorless air-curtain entrance. The atmosphere inside was realistic, jarred only in the bar where the lights, sound boom, and camera were already in place. A casual group of 75 extras, all hired in Reno for $10 a day, milled through the dice and roulette tables and around the slot machines, but did not play. The famil\u00adiar sounds were absent, and even the air \u00adconditioning had been turned off to permit recording. The normal shift of Har\u00adrah\u2019s dealers, pit bosses, and waitresses stood silently at hand, the dealers losing about $10 a day in tips, Bill Harrah losing an estimated $50,000 each day in gam\u00adbling revenue in exchange for the refer\u00adences to his club in the script.\n\nThe scene began with Gable and Wal\u00adlach on adjoining bar stools with their backs to the camera, Monroe, and Ritter. Langland\u2019s hound, Tom Dooley, was beside a stool. In the script, Roslyn sees the dog and calls to it. Langland notices that his dog is missing, sees Roslyn, and advan\u00b7ces upon her. Guido and Langland are introduced by Isabelle, who has met Guido at the boardinghouse, and the issue is joined. Marilyn Monroe was very ner\u00advous, Tom Dooley was unmanageable, and the scene was long, but Huston got the company out of Harrah\u2019s in a day and a half, a day and a half ahead of the esti\u00admated three-day shutdown, to Bill Har\u00adrah\u2019s vast relief."}, {"url": "https://www.hollywoodyesterday.com/clark-gable-and-marilyn-monroe-behind-the-scenes-of-the-bittersweet-film-the-misfits/", "page_content": "Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe\n\nClark Gable and Marilyn Monroe lead an outstanding cast in the WONDERFUL 1961 film The Misfits, directed by John Huston.

The Golden Age of Hollywood saw a deluge of filmmakers who are now almost regarded as gods, such as Orson Welles and Billy Wilder, but few can claim to be even as remotely chaotic as John Huston, who had made his feature debut in 1941 and would continue until his death in 1987. Huston was, in a sense, the sort of hypermasculine auteur modern movie buffs would have an uneasy relationship with, from his famously gruff voice to his devil-may-care attitude to making his movies; in reality, he was a Hemingway-esque figure, a man so brimming with masculine energy that he threatened to implode.\n\nNot unlike how Ernest Hemingway\u2019s writings were conjoined inexplicably with the man\u2019s chronic battles with physical injuries and mental illness, Huston\u2019s films often gave us insight into a violent flame that stood on the brink of being snuffed out, and as such, there is a kind of emotional honesty and brutality to Huston\u2019s work. Reading about the production behind a Huston film can, at times, be just as enthralling as watching the film itself.\n\nThings to do:\n\nWhen \u2018The Misfits\u2019 hit American theaters in February 1961, Huston had been in the business for twenty years, having won two Oscars for his troubles (for \u2018The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\u2019), and he already had an impressive list of behind-the-scenes stories behind him. We don\u2019t need to get into how everyone on the set of \u2018The African Queen\u2019 was miserable (when not physically ill), or how Huston\u2019s adaptation of Moby Dick ran the gamut from the expensive whale model getting lost at sea to Huston and screenwriter Ray Bradbury (yes, that Ray Bradbury) butting heads.\n\nOf all these, though, none are as purely tragic as the story behind \u2018The Misfits,\u2019 the film that would prove to skeptics that Marilyn Monroe was a real actress \u2014 and which would end up featuring her final performance. True, Monroe was working on \u2018Something\u2019s Got to Give\u2019 at the time of her death, but the film went unfinished, and so \u2018The Misfits\u2019 stood as her last will and testament. Not only that, but on paper, the cast and crew \u2014 no, the sheer hurricane of talent being funneled into \u2018The Misfits\u2019 should have made the film a dream, both in front of and behind the camera; instead, it proved to be a breaking point for some of the people involved.\n\nHuston had already collaborated with Ray Bradbury, one of America\u2019s literary heavyweights, and for \u2018The Misfits\u2019 he would continue that streak \u2014 this time with Pulitzer Prize-winner Arthur Miller, who also happened to be married to Marilyn Monroe at the time. Miller adapted one of his own short stories, also titled \u2018The Misfits,\u2019 for the film, with his wife as the heroine in mind. Alongside Monroe were Clark Gable, most famous as the male lead in \u2018Gone with the Wind,\u2019 Eli Wallach, who would later become most famous as the anti-hero Tuco in \u2018The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\u2019 and Montgomery Clift, a young star whose career was derailing due to a car accident in 1956.\n\nRelated video: Full Commentary \u2013 Cast & Crew Spills Secrets on Making of \u2018Elvis\u2019 | In-Depth Scoop | Austin Butler\n\nRelated video: Full Rendezvous At the Premiere of \u2018Elvis\u2019 with Reactions from Stars | Austin Butler, Baz Luhrmann\n\nRelated video: Come Behind The Scenes of \u2018Elvis\u2019 | Austin Butler, Tom Hanks and Baz Luhrmann\n\nRelated article: MUST WATCH \u2013 The Hollywood Insider\u2019s CEO Pritan Ambroase\u2019s Love Letter to Black Lives Matter \u2013 VIDEO\n\nRelated article: Why Queen Elizabeth II Is One Of The Greatest Monarchs | Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of United Queendom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland (Video Insight)\n\nRelated article: All Best Actor/Actress Speeches From The Beginning Of Oscars 1929-2019 | Hollywood Insider\n\nOf the four stars, only Wallach would make it past 60: Monroe died in 1962, at the age of 36, Clift would die in 1966 at the age of 45, and Gable died mere days after filming for \u2018The Misfits\u2019 had wrapped. The film was released on February 1, on what would have been Gable\u2019s 60th birthday. On the set, drug problems plagued Monroe and Clift, and Monroe had things doubly bad, on account of the fact that her marriage to Miller was eroding; by the time the movie hit theaters, the two had parted ways.\n\nThe Short Unhappy Life of Marilyn Monroe\n\nThere is an alternate timeline, not too different from ours, where Marilyn Monroe had a long and successful career as a film actress; alas, Monroe\u2019s acting career had a number of false starts, and she died young. Born in 1926, Monroe started taking roles when she was barely out of her teens, appearing in B-movie schlock that has long since been forgotten before landing minor roles in Joseph L. Mankiewicz\u2019s \u2018All About Eve\u2019 and Huston\u2019s own \u2018The Asphalt Jungle,\u2019 both in 1950, both also being held as classics. Still, it would take a few more years for Monroe to land a lead role of any significance, with \u2018Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\u2019 in 1953, directed by Howard Hawks and co-starring Jane Russell, and this cemented her status as a sex symbol of the 1950s \u2014 for better and worse.\n\nIn her short career, Monroe managed to work with such astounding Golden Age directors as Hawks, Mankiewicz, Huston, and even Billy Wilder, yet despite all these projects, she struggled to be taken seriously as an actress; for all her fame, she died without getting even one Oscar nomination. Being pigeonholed as a promiscuous empty-headed blonde when in reality she was anything but (not helped by the fact that she was a three-time divorcee by the end of it all, at a time when divorce was a taboo subject), Monroe had her beauty turned against her. \u2018The Misfits\u2019 was set to be the one, the role that would make Monroe\u2019s career, and how could she fail? She had Huston, who had previously worked with her, and she had her then-husband writing her lines. What could go wrong?\n\nRelated article: The Hollywood Insider\u2019s CEO Pritan Ambroase: \u201cThe Importance of Venice Film Festival as the Protector of Cinema\u201d\n\nRelated article: The Masters of Cinema Archives: The Hollywood Insider Pays Tribute to \u2018La Vie En Rose\u2019, Exclusive Interview with Director Olivier Dahan\n\nRelated article: \u2013 Want GUARANTEED SUCCESS?

For another, it turns out that having the screenwriter and the leading lady be in a relationship may not be the best idea; not only did Miller keep revising his screenplay mid-production, but Monroe resented her character being modeled after herself. The movie follows a young divorcee and former nightclub dancer (hmmm) who moves to Reno, striking up a friendship and business partnership with an aging cowboy (Gable) and his volatile WWII veteran friend (Wallach), as the three try to make it in the Nevada desert.\n\nThe film, by the way, was actually shot in the Nevada desert, in scorching heat, which probably didn\u2019t help matters. Curiously, despite on-set tensions with Huston and Miller, Monroe befriended a scarred and drug-addled Montgomery Clift, and the surprisingly platonic friendship between their characters on-screen hints at a genuine off-screen friendship between kindred spirits. As said before, Monroe and Clift suffered from drug addiction during production \u2014 battles they would eventually lose, and it must also be said that despite these personal troubles, they both carried through on-screen wonderfully. Indeed, Monroe\u2019s performance in \u2018The Misfits\u2019 could be her very best; she exudes a tragic femininity trying to transcend itself in spite of all the men in her life disappointing her.\n\nRelated article: A Tribute to Johnny Depp: The Actor and Musician Who Defined Range\n\nRelated video: EVOLUTION: Every Johnny Depp Role From 1984 to 2020, All Performances Exceptionally Poignant\n\nRelated article: A Tribute to the Hero & President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: Comedian/Actor, Ukraine\u2019s President and Heroic Leader\n\nA Swan Song for Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age\n\nIn 1961, Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age was coming to an end, although this would not have been apparent to most people yet. As far as moviegoers and filmmakers were concerned, 1961 was part of the 1950s, in spirit if not literally; after all, one of the highest-grossing films of 1960 was Stanley Kubrick\u2019s sword-and-sandals epic \u2018Spartacus,\u2019 a movie that would almost surely not have done as well if released a decade later. Regardless, the Golden Age was in its twilight years \u2014 a twilight that would then turn pitch black with the financial disaster that was Joseph L. Mankiewicz\u2019s \u2018Cleopatra\u2019 in 1963. \u2018The Misfits\u2019 starred three Golden Age legends, all of whom were at the ends of their careers, being the last rodeo for Monroe and Gable in particular.\n\nIt would also be the last time Huston would put 100% of himself into his filmmaking for at least a decade, afterward directing a string of forgettable or regrettable features until the critical hit of \u2018Fat City\u2019 in 1972, at which point he had virtually reinvented himself. \u2018The Misfits\u2019 also occupies an interesting space as a Western that doesn\u2019t fit into the classic Western mode (no gunfights, no saloon brawls, no villain in a black suit) while also not quite anticipating the transformation the Western would experience in the coming years. As such, \u2018The Misfits\u2019 stands, perhaps better than any other movie, as a line in the sand, between the Golden Age Hollywood production and the grittier, more socially conscious New Hollywood productions that were to emerge in the 1960s.\n\nRelated article: EVOLUTION: Every Henry Cavill Role From 2001 to 2021, All Performances Exceptionally Poignant\n\nRelated article: EVOLUTION: Every Chris Evans Role From 1997 to 2020, All Performances Exceptionally Poignant\n\nRelated article: #metoo Revolution: Powerful Questions That Need Answers\n\nRelated article: FACT-CHECKED Series: Timothee Chalamet and 32 Facts about The Young Superstar\n\nDespite its making being a torture for those involved, and despite its initial reception being underwhelming, \u2018The Misfits\u2019 comes out as a triumph. Not only are the four leads incredible, with all of them embodying complex and troubled characters with disturbing ease, but you probably wouldn\u2019t think Miller had kept fiddling with the screenplay during shooting, since while the structure is not a strict three-act one that we would expect, it gives plenty of air to breathe for the characters. The vast Nevada landscape is gorgeous, and there are some bird\u2019s-eye-view shots that are pretty remarkable for the time, with Huston proving once again that he could make great movies \u2014 in spite of himself. Most importantly, \u2018The Misfits\u2019 might be the strongest argument in favor of Monroe\u2019s potential as an actress, giving a dexterous performance that is at once tender and overflowing with emotion \u2014 the kind of performance any actor would be proud of. Hollywood was about to go through some serious changes, and in so doing would leave Monroe, Clift, and the others behind, but with the gift of hindsight, we can now appreciate a masterpiece for what it is.\n\nSadly, \u2018The Misfits\u2019 is not currently available to stream anywhere, but it is available to rent digitally. The movie itself is certainly worth a few dollars and your time.\n\nBest of luck to Ana de Armas playing Marilyn Monroe in \u2018Blonde\u2019.\n\nBy Brian Collins\n\nClick here to read The Hollywood Insider\u2019s CEO Pritan Ambroase\u2019s love letter to Cinema, TV and Media. An excerpt from the love letter: The Hollywood Insider\u2019s CEO/editor-in-chief Pritan Ambroase affirms, \u201cWe have the space and time for all your stories, no matter who/what/where you are. Media/Cinema/TV have a responsibility to better the world and The Hollywood Insider will continue to do so. Talent, diversity and authenticity matter in Cinema/TV, media and storytelling. In fact, I reckon that we should announce \u201ctalent-diversity-authenticity-storytelling-Cinema-Oscars-Academy-Awards\u201d as synonyms of each other. We show respect to talent and stories regardless of their skin color, race, gender, sexuality, religion, nationality, etc., thus allowing authenticity into this system just by something as simple as accepting and showing respect to the human species\u2019 factual diversity. We become greater just by respecting and appreciating talent in all its shapes, sizes, and forms. Award winners, which includes nominees, must be chosen on the greatness of their talent ALONE.\n\nI am sure I am speaking for a multitude of Cinema lovers all over the world when I speak of the following sentiments that this medium of art has blessed me with. Cinema taught me about our world, at times in English and at times through the beautiful one-inch bar of subtitles. I learned from the stories in the global movies that we are all alike across all borders. Remember that one of the best symbols of many great civilizations and their prosperity has been the art they have left behind. This art can be in the form of paintings, sculptures, architecture, writings, inventions, etc. For our modern society, Cinema happens to be one of them. Cinema is more than just a form of entertainment, it is an integral part of society. I love the world uniting, be it for Cinema, TV, media, art, fashion, sport, etc. Please keep this going full speed.\u201d\n\nMore Interesting Stories From The Hollywood Insider\n\n\u2013 Want GUARANTEED SUCCESS?

Gable died before the film\u2019s release, and Monroe attempted one more project, \u201cSomething\u2019s Gotta Give,\u201d which was begun by director George Cukor but was never completed.\n\nWhen \u201cThe Misfits\u201d was initially released, it divided critics and failed to find large audiences. However, over the years, the film has grown in stature and in both cinematic and emotional baggage, not least because of the caliber of the cast members and their troubled lives; Montgomery Clift also co-starred.\n\nSet in the Reno rooming house run by Isabelle Steers (Thelma Ritter), \u201cThe Misfits\u201d is a modern Western about a triangle of individuals whose paths fatefully crisscross. Roslyn Tabor (Marilyn Monroe), who stays at Steers, meets Gay Langland (Clark Gable), an aging cowboy known for his rugged independence.\n\nDespite difference in age and personality, the two are attracted to each other and soon fall in love, sharing together residence in the partially completed ranch house of Gay\u2019s friend, Guido (Eli Wallach), a mechanic who has turned into an aimless wanderer (and lost soul) ever since his wife had died in childbirth.\n\nThe movie deconstructs the myth of the cowboys, who now drive a pick up and ride horses without saddles, and the myth of the Western, both real and reel. Even so, it still presents a romantically nostalgic view of the old American mores, which is in tune with one of the most recurrent themes in Miller\u2019s stage plays \u201c\u201dDeath of a Salesman,\u201d \u201cAll My Sons\u201d), which could be described as the degradation or dissolution of the American Dream.\n\nThe text is replete of ironies and mysteries. The ruthless and aimless cowboys live around Reno, Nevada, which is after all, the divorce capital of American, and this a symbol of graveyard of romance.\n\nThe film makes allusions to the public screen images and lives off screen of the three central stars. Take Gable anti-hero, who\u2019s ironically named Gay. Or the punch-drunk, mother-fixated rodeo rider played by Clift, a star whose handsome looks had been tarnished after a bad accident in 1957 during the production of \u201cRaintree County.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Misfits\u201d reflects how modern technology has caught up with the work and lifestyles of the characters involved. The guys hunt wild stallions not with ropes and horses, but with a truck and airplane. Moreover, their \u201dwork\u201d involves horses whose meat is then processed into tinned cat food.\n\nThe film ends on an ambiguous note, with Gable and Monroe discovering some peace and heading together \u201chome.\u201d Consider the last exchange between the couple. When Monroe asks, \u201cHow do you find your way back in the dark?\u201d Gable says: \u201cJust head for that big star straight on. The highway\u2019s under it, and it will take us right home.\u201d\n\nBut after all we have seen there\u2019s no avoiding the feeling that the bond is still fragile and they both live in a void, searching for co-existence in a more meaninful world. Most of the drama is about characters who have no \u201chome\u201d and never have had one.\n\nIn 1961, some critics found the picture to be too solemn, pretentious, and wallowing in self-pity. But over the years, \u201cThe Misfits\u201d has changed meanings from a drama about ill-fated lives into one about its personas\u2019 real lives, including Gable\u2019s fading charisma as an aging star, Monroe\u2019s evolution as a dramatic actress and her desire to be recognized as such, and Clift\u2019s alcoholic, wasted, self-destructive life.\n\nThe movie walks a fine, tenuous line between being theatrical and cinematic, and between using Monroe\u2019s sex appeal as integral to the character she plays and exploiting it for commercial reasons.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Monroe\u2019s career as a \u201cserious\u201d dramatic actress is bookended by two John Huston pictures: \u201cThe Asphalt Jungle,\u201d in 1950, in which Monroe made a strong impression in a secondary part, and exactly a decade later with \u201cThe Misfits.\u201d\n\nThe film is evocatively shot in black and white by Russell Metty and beautifully scored by composer Alex North, a frequent collaborator of Huston.\n\nCredits:\n\nReleased: February 4, 1961\n\nRunning time: 124 Minutes\n\nA Seven Arts-John Huston production.\n\nProduced by Frank Taylor\n\nScreenplay: Arthur Miller\n\nDirected by John Huston\n\nCinematography: Russell Metty\n\nEditor: George Tomasini\n\nMusic: Alex North\n\nArt Directors: Stephan Grimes and William Newberry"}]}
