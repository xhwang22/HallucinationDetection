It has been a real privilege.\"\n\nThe SFA board met at Hampden on Thursday to discuss the position of Strachan, whose contract was due to end next month. They will now begin the search for a successor.\n\n\"I know how disappointed he was that we couldn't secure a play-off place but to come so close was a tribute to the belief he instilled in his squad,\" Regan said.\n\n\"After almost five years the board felt it was time for a new direction to prepare for the Uefa Euro 2020 qualifying campaign and also the forthcoming Uefa Nations League.\n\n\"We are grateful to both Gordon and Mark for their efforts and wish them the best of luck in the future.\"\n\nScottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan, left, and president Alan McRae, right, were part of the board that discussed Gordon Strachan's future\n\nAnalysis - 'There was only ever going to be one outcome'\n\nBBC Scotland senior football reporter Chris McLaughlin\n\nThere will be disagreements about the decision but few would argue that the news came as much of a shock. The SFA could not be seen to be rewarding failure and as the players trudged off the pitch in Ljubljana. It felt like the end, not only for their world cup chances, but for the manager.\n\nHe had come close to walking away in the past and the speed of today's decision was most likely aided by a reluctance from the man himself to carry on. The players loved him, the media tolerated him and the fans were split down the middle but ultimately the results dictated he couldn't carry on.\n\nYes, performances improved but ultimately it was two campaigns and two failures. There was only ever going to be one outcome."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/14/gordon-strachan-scotland-manager", "page_content": "The Scottish Football Association has called a news conference for midday on Tuesday, when Gordon Strachan is expected to be named the new manager of the national team.\n\nThe 55-year-old, who has been out of work since leaving Middlesbrough in October 2010, has been in negotiation with the SFA with regards to his salary and contract length since the turn of the year. Although those conditions remain unclear, Strachan will be handed at least the remainder of Scotland's failed 2014 World Cup qualification campaign plus the country's attempt to make it to the 2016 European Championship.\n\nScotland have not appeared at a major finals since 1998, a matter which has had a negative impact on public confidence towards the SFA and the governing body's financial position. The SFA has also been heavily criticised for its role in the deeply unpopular reforms of Scotland's domestic set-up.\n\nStrachan was immediately the favoured choice of senior figures within the SFA and among the country's international football support after the inevitable sacking of Craig Levein. Under Levein, Scotland failed to qualify for last summer's European Championship and made an abysmal start to the 2014 campaign; they lie bottom of Group A with two points from four matches.\n\nStrachan was the country's outstanding candidate, with Joe Jordan, who has joined Harry Redknapp at Queens Park Rangers, and Owen Coyle only tentatively mentioned as alternatives. Alex McLeish was briefly quoted, but distanced himself from a return to the Scotland role and has been appointed as the manager of Nottingham Forest.\n\nStrachan, when asked directly about the Scotland job, which will be his first in international management, said in November: \"It's quite simple really \u2013 it would be an honour to be asked to be the manager of your own national side; it's terrific.\"\n\nLevein remains in a legal dispute with the SFA in relation to the remainder of his contract. The association has been seeking to retain Levein on its payroll but the 48-year-old wants the balance of his contract paid up.\n\nStrachan has been employed as a pundit by ITV since leaving Middlesbrough. His 12-month spell in the north-east was less than distinguished, with Boro 20th in the Championship when he left, their lowest position for two decades. Of 46 games in charge after he succeeded Gareth Southgate, Strachan won only 13 and, according to the chairman, Steve Gibson, was so chastened by the experience he refused any compensation, despite having two and a half years left on his contract.\n\nBefore that, Strachan managed Coventry City, Southampton and Celtic. He was relegated with Coventry but bounced back with Southampton, whom he took to the 2003 FA Cup final where they lost 1\u20130 to Arsenal.\n\nStrachan took a 16-month break after resigning from Southampton in 2004 before becoming manager of Celtic, where he won three successive league titles before resigning in May 2009 after failing to win a fourth title."}, {"url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/gordon-strachan-factfile-8452390.html", "page_content": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for free Sign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

He started playing for Dundee at the age of 14. The following year, he lost vision in his right eye when a pen in his pocket accidentally poked his eye during a football match on the school playground.\n\nRecommended Lists:\n\nCareer\n\nAt the age of 18, he outplayed Alan Ball in a friendly match with Arsenal. His outstanding performance won him the seat of a regular player for the 1975-1976 season, which also happened to be the inaugural season for the Scottish Premier Division.\n\nHe became the team captain for the 1976-1977 First Division campaign, but he lost his position soon, after a drinking incident with Jimmy Johnstone.\n\nHe quit Dundee and signed a contract with Aberdeen in 1977. Poor form and injuries crippled the 1977-78 season for him. However, he was selected for the 1979 League Cup where the team recorded two wins at the Celtic Park. His brilliant performance on the field earned him the SFWA Footballer of the Year.\n\nIn 1980, he was awarded his first cap in the British Home Championship, against Northern Island. Two years later, he was instrumental in getting his home team to qualify for the FIFA World Cup in 1982.\n\nThe 1982-1983 seasons were the most successful runs for the club and he made his mark by striking four goals in a 5-1 victory with Dundee in the League Cup. His team then went on to win the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup. They also defeated Hamburg in the 1983 European Super Cup Final.\n\nIn the 1984-1985 season, he took four goals in a total of seven games and even though he did not participate in the 1985 FA Cup Final at Wembley, the team went on to win the opening ten league games in the 1985-1986 season.\n\nAfter accepting a contract by Ron Atkinson, he led the Leeds United Club to the Second Division title in the 1989-1990 season. They finished fourth overall, but managed to secure a place in the semi-finals of the League Cup.\n\nHe signed a two-year contract with Leeds and captained them to record a victory in the league title of 1991-1992. However, due to poor health and back problems, he started missing a number of games and thus, became unable to build on the success of Leeds Untied.\n\nOn April 10, 1993, despite his downfalls and tough seasons, he scored a hat-trick against the Blackburn Rovers and then moved to Coventry City to serve as an assistant to the manager, Ron Atkinson.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nHe coached the team and trained them and also appeared in the seasons 1994-1995 and 1995-1996.

Under his leadership, the Southampton team earned their place for the UEFA Cup.\n\nAfter a brief hiatus, he returned to manage the team, Celtic, on June 1, 2005. Although he had a very shaky start as a manager, the team eventually began to do well under his management and started winning tournaments.\n\nOn October 26, 2009, he was signed on as the manager for Middlesbrough.
