Nugent of The New York Times, wrote:\n\n\u201cSo Mr. Olivier has played Heathcliff, and Miss Oberon, as Cathy, has matched the brilliance of his characterization with hers. She has perfectly caught the restless, changeling spirit of the Bront\u00eb heroine who knew she was not meant for heaven and broke her heart and Heathcliff's in the synthetic paradise of her marriage with gentle Edgar Linton.\u201d\n\nAlso in the movie were David Niven as Linton and Geraldine Fitzgerald.\n\nLiked \u2018Healthy\u2019 Things\n\nMiss Oberon's career was a record of persistence, ingenuity, hard work and good luck, and she retained her smooth, youthful looks better than many another film star of her generation. \u201cLuckily, I like all the things that are healthy,\u201d she once said, \u201clike exercise, rest, sensible food, no alcoholic drinks, unless a sip of wine, and no cigarettes.\u201d\n\nMiss Oberon was born Estelle Merle 0'Brien Thompson on Feb. 19, 1911, on the island of Tasmania, near Australia, the daughter of a British Army major who died just before her birth. She grew up in Bombay and Calcutta, studying French and Hindustani along with the traditional subjects, and danced at the Calcutta Amateur Theatrical Society.\n\nWhen she was 16, an uncle, also a British officer, took her for a visit to London, where she enrolled in dancing school and decided to stay. She took a job as a dance hostess at the Caf\u00e9 de Paris even though she considered it much beneath her, the product of the highly snobbish British Army presence in India. But the job came with free dinners, and that became the deciding factor.\n\nEven then, Miss Oberon, known as Queenie Thompson, was noted for her beauty. Her first screen test nevertheless ended in disaster, but she soon found herself playing bit parts after a second one turned out better."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/06/merle-oberon-oscars-best-actress", "page_content": "Magazine writers didn\u2019t know what to make of Merle Oberon when she took Hollywood by storm in the 1930s. One writer described her as \u201cbizarre, bewildering, and different\u201d, while others marveled at her \u201cdelicate\u201d oval face, \u201celoquent\u201d emerald eyes, \u201cbright red lips\u201d and \u201calabaster\u201d skin.\n\nThough her 1936 best actress Oscar nomination for the coming-of-age drama The Dark Angel affirmed her place in a league with Katharine Hepburn and the eventual winner, Bette Davis, the glamor paragons of the day, it was only later that the world discovered Oberon was a south Asian woman passing for white.\n\nGiven the way Everything Everywhere All at Once has dominated this awards season, it seems increasingly likely that Michelle Yeoh will take home this year\u2019s best actress prize. But when Yeoh\u2019s name was announced among the best actress nominees for this year\u2019s Academy Awards in late January, the Hollywood Reporter was at pains to call the veteran actor \u201cthe first person who identifies as Asian to ever be nominated for the award\u201d.\n\nLaurence Olivier and Merle Oberon in Wuthering Heights. Photograph: United Artists/Allstar\n\nCritics condemned the declaration as too politically correct, even as it captured the complex tie that binds these women, each a product of her time. Where the 60-year-old Yeoh is a butt-kicking film pioneer on the brink of smashing a cultural ceiling for playing a role originally written for Jackie Chan, Oberon carefully hid her true identity to evade certain racial persecution and took that secret to her grave. It wasn\u2019t until decades after her death in 1979 at age 68 that the world learned her truth. That, not Oberon\u2019s eye-opening work in The Dark Angel, is what should rightly be hailed as her signature performance.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about the story of racial representation,\u201d says Shilpa Dav\u00e9, an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, \u201cMerle Oberon is a really important part. She brings a global aspect to it, the shades of brown.\u201d\n\nBorn Estelle Merle O\u2019Brien Thompson in what was then the British Indian city of Bombay, Oberon was determined to make the most of her innately fairer complexion. It became her ticket to a bigger world, the shroud that helped disguise the fact that she was the product of rape. Her birth father was the Anglo-Irish foreman of a tea plantation. Her mother, believed to have been of Sri Lankan and M\u0101ori ancestry, was just 14 when she gave birth in 1911. After centuries of intermixing, babies born from biracial relationships had evolved into a quiet shame \u2013 shunned by Britons and Indians alike.\n\nThe family nicknamed Oberon \u201cQueenie\u201d, as her birth coincided with Queen Mary and King George\u2019s visit to India. In an attempt to soften Oberon\u2019s lot in life, her grandmother raised her as her own and convinced her that her teenage mother was actually her half sister. But that wasn\u2019t enough to shield Oberon from the relentless taunts over her mixed heritage. At the age of three, after a cross-country move to Calcutta, she won a scholarship to one of the city\u2019s best all-girls private schools, only for classmates to drive her out with their overt racism. Films and the nightlife scene became her escape, and playing pretend key to her survival.\n\nMerle Oberon and Leslie Howard in The Scarlet Pimpernel. Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Alamy\n\nIn adolescence, Oberon began honing a posh accent and lightening her skin with bleach creams loaded with ammoniated mercury \u2013 a dangerous poison that had more of a weakening effect on Oberon\u2019s many male suitors. Those who didn\u2019t dump her outright after discovering her race helped sponsor her moves from India to France and England, where she worked for a time as a club hostess under the name Queenie O\u2019Brien. When she became romantically involved with the Hungarian-born British director Alexander Korda, Oberon\u2019s acting career clicked into high gear.\n\nA bit part as Anne Boleyn in the 1933 blockbuster The Private Life of Henry VIII announced her breakout. A mad scramble to come up with a cover story for the actor credited as \u201cMerle Oberon\u201d ensued. She told people she had been born in Tasmania \u201cbecause it was so far from the US and Europe and generally considered to be \u2018British\u2019 to its core\u201d, wrote Mar\u00e9e Delofski, director of the 2002 documentary The Trouble with Merle. (In her lifetime, Oberon visited Australia twice.) Oberon claimed her birth records had been destroyed in a fire. (Her half-brother, Harry, would discover them in Bombay, now Mumbai, after her death.) As for her much darker-skinned mother \u2013 her biological grandmother \u2013 Oberon presented her as a maid.\n\nSuch was the cost of making it in show business at a time when the US government was keen to crack down on indecency. Rather than leave it up to lawmakers, Hollywood seized on the opportunity to police itself, adopting a set of rules known as the Hays Code \u2013 which, among many other things, frowned upon interracial romance. With representational casting essentially made illegal, studios embraced yellow and blackface. And when Oberon\u2019s early work with Korda, whom she eventually married, led to a successful career under Samuel Goldwyn, it became in everyone\u2019s best interest to keep her identity a mystery. \u201cThink about it,\u201d says Dav\u00e9. \u201cShe was part of this cadre of actors and actresses that were loaned out to make all these movies. She was dependent on Goldwyn and Korda for her livelihood. I can see why she had to hide in that way. She had no power.\u201d\n\nNot even the 1936 best actress nomination brought Oberon any extra clout. For a start, the Oscars were barely a decade old and not yet the gold standard award. For another, the media was even tougher on female actors than they are now and held Oberon up for extra scrutiny.\n\nOberon gets a tip as she leaves for Royal Ascot, in a 1950 photo in London. Photograph: Norman Vigars/Getty Images\n\nOne critic derided Oberon\u2019s performance in the 1934 action film The Scarlet Pimpernel, citing a \u201ctendency to strongly orientalize her appearance by means of facial makeup and the slant of black brows\u201d. When a 1934 Los Angeles Times story used the term \u201cEuro-Asian\u201d to describe her, Oberon dismissed it as a coincidence. In an ad campaign for Max Factor, the cosmetics brand bragged about how its makeup turned her from \u201cslightly unreal and exotic\u201d to a \u201cbeautiful, charming girl\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that she would be Oscar nominated for The Dark Angel, a film about a first world war love affair that is complicated when the male protagonist suffers a battle injury that costs him his eyesight. Strangely, it was Oberon\u2019s only nomination, even as Hepburn and Davis became Oscar perennials and Oberon kept working into the early 70s. She starred opposite Laurence Olivier in 1939\u2019s Wuthering Heights and as herself in 1966\u2019s The Oscar, which is about the awards.\n\nStill, she soldiered on in spite of the damage she\u2019d caused to her skin from so much bleach cream and a car accident that left her disfigured and forced Korda to abandon production of the epic I, Claudius. To keep the cracks in Oberon\u2019s white facade from surfacing on screen, the cinematographer Lucien Ballard developed a special camera light for her to obscure her facial scars. This was after \u201cLady Korda\u201d had divorced her knighted director husband to marry Ballard.\n\nOn her downslope, Oberon reveled in her grand dame status, regaling magazine reporters with her true Hollywood stories, when she wasn\u2019t making the odd cameo on the game show What\u2019s My Line? or presenting a special achievement award to the Poseidon Adventure at the 1973 Oscars. Even then Charlton Heston called her \u201ca lady whose beauty is not only a legend, but a reality\u201d.\n\nBut even as times changed and Hollywood\u2019s aversion toward race mixing on screen began to relax, Oberon remained committed to her lie and quickly tightened up when it unraveled. When her nephew Michael Korda, then editor-in-chief at Simon and Schuster, tried to write a biography on Oberon, he says, she threatened to sue him and cut him out of her will if he used real details. So he turned it into the roman-\u00e0-clef Queenie, which became an ABC miniseries.\n\nAccording to the Australian historian Cassandra Pybus, a visit to Hobart in 1978 turned awkward for Oberon when officials couldn\u2019t find proof that she had been born in Tasmania. After confirming as much, Oberon ducked reporters and skipped a ceremony at a theater named in her honor before quietly returning home.\n\nA year later, she died in Malibu from a stroke."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Merle-Oberon", "page_content": "Merle Oberon, (born February 19, 1911, Bombay [now Mumbai], India\u2014died November 23, 1979, Los Angeles, California, U.S.), British and American film actress who appeared in more than 30 motion pictures.

Interval (1973).\n\nMerle Oberon, who is best remembered for her striking portrayal of the tormented Cathy in the 1939 film version of Emily Bront\u00eb 's Wuthering Heights, was a popular movie actress during the 1930s and 1940s. Oberon's beauty alone sustained her career into the 1950s, although her private life attracted as much attention as her films; she was married four times and often involved in romantic affairs. Following her death in 1979, Michael Korda, her nephew by her first marriage to Alexander Korda, said of her: \"Her greatest achievement was not in her roles, but herself, as Merle Oberon. She was her own work of art.\"\n\nOberon kept the details surrounding her birth a secret throughout her life, insisting that she was born into an aristocratic family in Tasmania. In truth, she was born in 1911 in Bombay's overcrowded St. George's Hospital, the daughter of Arthur Terrence O'Brien Thompson, a mechanical engineer for the British railways, and Charlotte Selby Thompson , a Ceylonese nurse's assistant. Fearing she might be ostracized as a half-caste, Merle initiated the lie about her past when she entered show business and by several accounts eventually came to believe her own legend. Oberon was raised in Bombay and Calcutta and was educated until the age of 11 at the strict La Martini\u00e8re school in Calcutta, an austere place where she was very much a loner. After she left, she was tutored at home by her hard-working mother, then entered business school at the age of 15. Her first job was as a typist in a department store.\n\nAt age 17, Oberon made her way to London, where she initially worked as a dance-hall girl under the name Queenie Thompson. By now\n\na regal beauty, she was hired as an extra in a number of British films and eventually caught the eye of Hungarian-born director-producer Alexander Korda who was starting his own film company and offered the actress a five-year contract. Korda cast her in the small role of Anne Boleyn in The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933), the first British talkie to attract an international audience. Oberon went on to play leads with Korda's company, including a Japanese woman in The Battle (1934) and Lady Blakeney in the film adaptation of Emma Orczy 's The Scarlet Pimpernel (1935), opposite Leslie Howard, with whom she also had a love affair. In 1935, Korda sold half her contract to the Goldwyn studios, thus launching Oberon's Hollywood career. Following an inauspicious debut in Folies Berg\u00e8re (1935), she gained credibility in The Dark Angel (1935), with Fredric March, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award. In 1937, Oberon returned to England to star in the ambitious I Claudius with Charles Laughton, but her involvement in a near-fatal car crash halted the already troubled project in mid-production. Following her recovery, Korda starred her in several comedies, including Over the Moon (1937) and The Divorce of Lady X (1938), opposite a very young Laurence-Olivier.\n\nOlivier was her co-star again in Wuthering Heights, although Oberon's first choice for the role of Heathcliff had been Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and Olivier had desperately wanted his new love Vivien Leigh for the role of Cathy. Tension on the set was heightened by the dictatorial style of the film's director William Wyler. The finished product, however, bore little evidence of the traumatic shoot, and Oberon's career went into high gear. Frank Nugent, critic for The New York Times, was generous in his acclaim, praising the \"wild spirit\" that marked her performance. Despite other glowing reviews, Oberon was not nominated for an Academy Award that year, an \"appalling\" oversight according to her biographers, Charles Higham and Roy Moseley.\n\nOberon's private life fascinated the gossip columnists, beginning with her engagement in 1934 to Joseph Schenck, producer and chair of the board of 20th Century-Fox, whom she abandoned for actor Leslie Howard, whom she subsequently left for actor David Niven. \"It was Merle's pattern,\" write Higham and Moseley. They also suggest that she was ahead of her time in her choice of men, preferring them to be \"neither subservient nor dominating, but to be her equal, her partner and friend as well as her physical lover.\" Oberon was also married four times; her first husband Alexander Korda was in love with her for years before they wed in 1939. The marriage, however, was failing by 1945, when Oberon met and fell in love with 35-year-old cinematographer Lucien Ballard, who also worked to provide special lighting for the star after a reaction to sulfa drugs and subsequent dermabrasion treatments severely damaged her skin. (Ballard developed and patented a new light, the \"Obie,\" named for Oberon, which was widely used in the industry.) Differences began to emerge between the two, however, early in the relationship. \"Merle was prone to daydreams, reveries, and romantic abstractions, whereas Ballard was tough and without interest in mysticism, spiritualism, which was beginning to fascinate Merle,\" write Higham and Moseley. In the wake of Oberon's divorce from Korda in 1945, the two married, although Ballard later said he dreaded being thought of as \"Mr. Merle Oberon,\" and only married the actress because she wore him down. The union lasted just four years, during which time Oberon met her great love, Count Giorgio Cini, a handsome and wealthy Italian aristocrat who was killed in a plane crash in 1949, not long after Oberon's divorce from Ballard was granted.\n\nWhile Oberon's private life flourished during the 1940s, her career began to decline. Two successive comedies, That Uncertain Feeling (1941) and Affectionately Yours (1941), failed at the box office, and her performance in Korda's romantic Lydia (1941) disappointed the critics, although she herself thought it was one of her best efforts. A turn as George Sand , in A Song to Remember (1945), opposite Cornel Wilde as Chopin, drew out-and-out ridicule. \"William Bendix being Chopin would have been no less incongruous than Merle Oberon being George Sand in a smart sort of Vesta Tilley outfit,\" snarled critic Richard Winnington. By 1947, Oberon was relegated to the lower half of double bills, and by the mid-1950s was playing supporting roles, notably in Desiree (1954) and Deep in My Heart (1954).\n\nIn 1957, Oberon married wealthy Italian industrialist Bruno Pagliai, who, though not good-looking, exuded power, money, and charm. They adopted two children, a girl and a boy, and settled into two lavish homes: one in Mexico City and another in Cuernavaca. While her husband was frequently away on business, Oberon doted on her children and ran her two households with a military precision that frequently strained those who worked for her. While she bloomed as an international hostess, she made fewer and fewer films. One of her infrequent appearances was in Of Love and Desire (1963), filmed in her own house and at her own expense. She hired then-unknown Richard Rush to direct. \"As an actress\u2014and as a human being\u2014she was like a jeweled Swiss clock,\" he said. \"Exquisite perfection. Finely timed. One thinks of her as part of an older Hollywood, an older tradition, but her working style was very like that of a Method-trained actor or actress. Everything she did was totally internalized.\" The finished product, nonetheless, was leveled by the critics, although it did surprisingly well at the box office. Higham and Moseley believe that although it is not a particularly good film, it is one of Oberon's most interesting because it completely captures her spirit. \"With its lush musical score, opulent images and scenes of passion, jealousy, abandon, and reconciliation, it is like a Victorian novel, and it was clearly very close to Merle's soul.\" Two of Oberon's other films of the '60s, The Oscar (1966) and Hotel (1967), both enjoyed wide showings as well.\n\nOberon also produced her last film, Interval (1973), which was financed by Pagliai, although their marriage was all but over by then. In the movie, Oberon portrays an aging woman who falls in love with a younger man, played by Robert Wolders, her new paramour. The film received scathing reviews, the critic for The New York Times writing that \"on a scale of awfulness, it is almost sublime.\" In 1975, after a difficult split from Pagliai, Oberon and Wolders, who was 25 years her junior, married and settled into a beach house in California.\n\nFollowing a trip to Australia in the fall of 1978, Oberon was stricken with chest pains, and subsequently underwent heart bypass surgery. The healing process produced thick scars called keloids, which were so painful that she underwent steroid treatments to achieve some relief. Oberon never recovered completely from her ordeal and was even too ill to attend her daughter Francesca Pagliai 's wedding. She died of a stroke on Thanksgiving eve in 1979. (Starting in 1981, Wolders would live with Audrey Hepburn until her death.)\n\nOberon left a million dollars of her estate to the Motion Picture Country House and Hospital, and the auctioning of her extensive jewelry collection raised close to another million for various other cinema charities. Six years after her death, her nephew Michael Korda wrote a novel based on Oberon's life entitled Queenie (1985), which was made into a television miniseries in 1987.\n\nsources:\n\nGarraty, John A., and Mark C.
