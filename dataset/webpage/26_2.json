But Harriot and Galileo's 1609 observations were made possible by a new instrument created by a Dutch-German spectacle maker named Hans Lippershey, who just the previous year had built what he called the 'Dutch trunke' \u2013 to all intent and purposes, the first telescope.

The dark patches correspond to Mare Crisium (at the top), Mare Tranquilitatis and Mare Foecunditatis.\n\nGalileo Galilei is often credited with being the first person to look through a telescope and make drawings of the celestial objects he observed. While the Italian indeed was a pioneer in this realm, he was not the first.\n\nEnglishman Thomas Harriot made the first drawing of the moon after looking through a telescope several months before Galileo, in July 1609.\n\n\n\nHistorian Allan Chapman of the University of Oxford details that 400-year-old breakthrough in astronomy in the February 2009 edition of Astronomy and Geophysics, a journal of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nChapman explains how Harriot preceded Galileo and went on to make other maps of the moon's surface that would not be bettered for decades.\n\nThe story\n\n\n\n\n\nHe then became a mathematical teacher and companion to the explorer Sir Walter Raleigh. In the early 1590s Raleigh fell from royal favor and was imprisoned in the Tower of London.

No better maps would be published for several decades.\n\nCush job\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman attributes this to his comfortable position as a \"well-maintained philosopher to a great and wealthy nobleman\" with a generous salary, said to be \"several times the level of the Warden of Wadham College, Oxford.\" Harriot had comfortable housing and a specially provided observing chamber on top of Sion House, all of which contrasted with Galileo's financial pressures.\n\nGalileo, interestingly, was unable to buy a telescope. So he figured out the optics of it and built his own. He also examined the moon, and then found that the Milky Way was composed of individual stars. Galileo also discovered four moons around Jupiter and spent much time observing and drawing sunspots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As an astrophysicist of the 21st century, I can only look back and marvel at the work of 17th century astronomers like Thomas Harriot,\" Fabian said. \"The world is right to celebrate Galileo in the International Year of Astronomy \u2013 but Harriot shouldn't be forgotten!\""}, {"url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/2021/07/26/on-this-day-thomas-harriot-moon-drawing/", "page_content": "On this day more than four centuries ago, one \u201cquiet English genius\u201d looked through a telescope and sketched out a picture of the Moon.\n\nHis name was Thomas Harriot \u2013 the first telescopic astronomer.\n\nIt would be several decades before the world would see a more accurate picture of the Moon than the one he drew on July 26, 1609.\n\nHarriot detailed the boundary between day and night with a line on the lunar surface.\n\nHe also sketched three dark patches to resemble lunar mare \u2013 large plains on the Moon that are formed when basaltic lava erupts.\n\nOne located on his map is called Mare Tranquillitatis.\n\nIt would become the landing spot for American astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin 360 years later, on the first manned mission to the Moon.\n\nHarriot had a narrow field of view, meaning he could only see a small portion of the Moon at any one time.\n\nHis use of a telescope to make observations was unprecedented.\n\nNever before had the telescope been used to look into space.\n\nIt was not seen as a scientific instrument, but an optical toy that was at times used by the military and navy.\n\nHarriot was publicity shy and never published any of his telescopic observations, meaning that more than a dozen of his pen-and-ink Moon drawings remained unknown for 175 years, and were only published 49 years after that.\n\nThis is why one newspaper labelled him the \u201cquiet English genius\u201d.\n\nHe shied away from the spotlight but is now in the history books."}, {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/460957a/", "page_content": "Cosmos and Culture: How Astronomy Has Shaped Our World\n\nScience Museum, London Until 30 December 2010\n\nThomas Harriot's magnified map of the Moon. Credit: LORD EGREMONT/WEST SUSSEX RECORD OFFICE Amid the commemoration of the Apollo landings, another lunar anniversary has just passed quietly. Four centuries ago, on 26 July 1609, the English scholar Thomas Harriot pointed his recently acquired 'Dutch trunke' at the Moon and drew what he saw.\n\nHe thus became the first person to record astronomical observations through a telescope, a few months before Galileo Galilei did the same. But unlike Galileo, who was struggling to feed a family on a lecturer's salary and angling for the patronage of the Medicis, Harriot had made his fortune and had no need of fame. He was already a distinguished mathematician \u2014 a renowned algebraist who had corresponded with Johannes Kepler on the physics of rainbows and who had produced a body of work on the physics of motion.\n\nBy 1609 Harriot had other reasons to avoid the limelight. His patron, Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, was a cousin of one of the gunpowder plotters who had sought to blow up the English Parliament in 1605, and Harriot himself was imprisoned and interrogated for his connection. His papers were lost after his death in 1621 and not rediscovered until 1784, still at Percy's estate. So he remains little known.\n\nTwo of Harriot's drawings of the Moon, one of which shows its seas and craters, plus his notes on the moons of Jupiter, are on display in London's Science Museum until the end of 2010 as part of the exhibition Cosmos and Culture.\n\nThey are accompanied by a first edition of Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius of 1610, a 1496 edition of Ptolemy's Almagest and first editions of Nicolaus Copernicus's De Revolutionibus Celestium Orbum (1543), Kepler's Astronomia Nova (1609) and Isaac Newton's Principia (1687). Other highlights include Chinese astrological figurines, made during the Tang dynasty in the first millennium BC, and the 2-metre-long telescope through which William Herschel discovered the planet Uranus in 1781.\n\nThe exhibition's subtitle is 'How Astronomy Has Shaped Our World'.

While there is evidence that the principles of telescopes were known in the late 16th century, the first telescopes were created in the Netherlands in 1608. Spectacle makers Hans Lippershey & Zacharias Janssen and Jacob Metius independently created telescopes. The telescope emerged from a tradition of craftsmanship and technical innovation around spectacles and developments in the science of optics traced back through Roger Bacon and a series of Islamic scientists, in particular Al-Kindi (c. 801\u2013873), Ibn Sahl (c. 940-1000) and Ibn al-Haytham (965\u20131040).\n\nThe story of Galileo's telescopic observations illustrates how a tool for seeing and collecting evidence can dramatically change our understanding of the cosmos.\n\nEarly telescopes were primarily used for making Earth-bound observations, such as surveying and military tactics. Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) was part of a small group of astronomers who turned telescopes towards the heavens. After hearing about the \"Danish perspective glass\" in 1609, Galileo constructed his own telescope. He subsequently demonstrated the telescope in Venice. His demonstration of the telescope earned him a lifetime lectureship.\n\nAfter his initial success, Galileo focused on refining the instrument. The initial telescope he created (and the Dutch ones it was based on) magnified objects three diameters. That is, it made things look three times larger than they did with the naked eye. Through refining the design of the telescope he developed an instrument that could magnify eight times, and eventually thirty times.\n\nThis increased magnification of heavenly objects had a significant and immediate impact. These new observations were by no means exclusive to Galileo. The story of Galileo and the telescope is a powerful example of the key role that technologies play in enabling advances in scientific knowledge. With that said, the telescope isn't the only technology at play in this story. Galileo deftly used the printed book and the design of prints in his books to present his research to the learned community. This is not a story of a lone thinker theorizing and piecing together a new model of the cosmos. Quite the contrary, an array of individuals in the early 17th century took the newly created telescopes and pointed them toward the heavens. Unlike those other observers, however, Galileo rapidly published his findings. In some cases, Galileo understood the significance and importance of these observations more readily than his contemporaries. It was this understanding, and foresight to publish, that made Galileo's ideas stand the test of time.\n\nStarry Messenger, Galileo's Rapidly Published Findings\n\nShortly after his first telescopic observations of the heavens, Galileo began sketching his observations. He wanted to get his findings out. His observations and interpretations of stars, the moon, Jupiter, the sun and the phases of the planet Venus, were critical in refining our understanding of the cosmos. In March of 1610, Galileo published the initial results of his telescopic observations in Starry Messenger (Sidereus Nuncius), this short astronomical treatise quickly traveled to the corners of learned society.\n\nThe Moon is not a Perfect Sphere\n\nThe engravings of the Moon, created from Galileo's artfully drawn sketches, presented readers with a radically different perspective on the Moon. Due to Galileo's training in Renaissance art and an understanding of chiaroscuro (a technique for shading light and dark) he quickly understood that the shadows he was seeing were actually mountains and craters. From his sketches, he made estimates of their heights and depths. These observations, only possible by the magnifying power of the telescope, clearly suggested that the Aristotelian idea of the Moon as a translucent perfect sphere (or as Dante had suggested an \"eternal pearl\") were wrong. The Moon was no longer a perfect heavenly object; it now clearly had features and a topology similar in many ways to the Earth. The notion that the moon had a topology like the Earth led to speculation on what life might be like on the Moon.\n\nIt's now understood that English astronomer Thomas Harriot, (1560-1621) made the first recorded observations of the Moon through a telescope, a month before Galileo in July of 1609. Moreover, the map Harriot created of the Moon in 1612 or 1613 is more detailed than Galileo's. Harriot observed the Moon first, and the maps he created included more information, but he did not broadly distribute his work. However, over 500 copies of the Starry Messenger were printed and sold, solidifying Galileo's legacy in astronomy.\n\nJupiter has its Own Moons\n\nWhen Galileo turned his telescope to observe Jupiter, he saw what he initially thought to be three previously unobserved fixed stars. After continued observations it became clear that they were not fixed, and in a matter of days he had come to the conclusion that these new stars were in fact orbiting Jupiter. He had discovered three of the largest moons of Jupiter.\n\nThe implications of this discovery, of objects orbiting a planet, were part of what pushed Galileo to argue for a sun-centered cosmos. Jupiter's moons countered a key argument against the Earth orbiting the sun. Critics of Copernicus' sun-centered cosmos asked, how could the Earth drag the moon across the heavens? Remember, the idea of the underlying mechanism of gravity wouldn't come until Newton's Principia Mathematica in 1687, which makes this both a reasonable and important question. Since there was wide agreement that Jupiter was already in motion, the fact that Jupiter clearly had its own moons offered a clear refutation of an important critique of the heliocentric system.\n\nIn Mundus Jovialis (1614), Simon Marius claimed that he, not Galileo, had first discovered the moons of Jupiter. In his times, Marius was publicly condemned as a plagiarist. Galileo had published his results already in 1610 and was rather well known and powerful in renaissance court. Only in the 19th century, would historians return to examine the evidence. It turns out that Marius had not plagiarized Galileo. Clearly his observations were different; in fact he had more accurately charted the orbits of Jupiter's moons. It's now broadly understood that Marius was an independent observer of Jupiter's moons.\n\nA Spotted Rotating Sun\n\nIn observing the sun, Galileo saw a series of \"imperfections\". He had discovered sunspots. Monitoring these spots on the sun demonstrated that the sun in fact rotated. Furthermore, later observations by Francesco Sizzi in 1612 suggested that the spots on the sun actually changed over time. It would seem that the Sun, like the Moon, was not the perfect sphere that learned Europeans thought of as a key feature of their universe.\n\nThese sunspots were also independently observed by the Jesuit priest and astronomer Christoph Scheiner (1575-1650). Scheiner observed sunspots in 1611 and published his results in 1612. Over the course of their careers Galileo and Schiener feuded over who should get credit for the discovery. Unbeknownst to either of them, Thomas Harriot had observed them in 1610 and the German theologian, David Fabricius and his son Johanes likely beat both Scheiner and Galileo to the publication of the discovery with their Apparente earum cum Sole Conversione Narratio in June of 1611. However, their publication was not widely circulated and thus remained obscure in its times. Outside the western tradition of science. Chinese astronomers have long observed sunspots, going back to at least 165 BC."}, {"url": "https://www.universetoday.com/23629/was-galileo-the-first/", "page_content": "[/caption]\n\nItalian Galileo Galilei has usually been attributed with making the first celestial observations with a telescope and then creating notations and drawings to record his observations.

But a British historian is taking this opportunity to publicize the work of another astronomer, Thomas Harriot, who actually was the first person to create drawings of the what the Moon looks like through a telescope, doing so well before Galileo.

You can hear Chapman talk about Harriot in today\u2019s 365 Days of Astronomy Podcast.\n\n\n\nChapman says that according to historical documents, Harriot used a \u2018Dutch trunke\u2019 (telescope), and turned it towards the Moon on July 26, 1609, and created drawings, becoming the first astronomer to do so.\n\nHistorical documents show Galileo first observed the moons of Jupiter on January 7, 1610, and later made drawings of Earth\u2019s moon.\n\nHarriot\u2019s crude drawings show a rough outline of the lunar terminator (the line marking the division between night and day on the Moon, as seen from the Earth) and includes a handful of features like the dark areas Mare Crisium, Mare Tranquilitatis and Mare Foecunditatis.\n\n\n\nHarriot went on to produce further maps from 1610 to 1613. Not all of these are dated, but they show an increasing level of detail. By 1613 he had created two maps of the whole Moon, with many identifiable features such as lunar craters that crucially are depicted in their correct relative positions.\n\n\n\nBut Harriot remains relatively unknown. Unlike Galileo, he did not publish his drawings. Dr. Chapman attributes this to his comfortable position as a \u2018well-maintained philosopher to a great and wealthy nobleman\u2019 with a generous salary.
