{"Siri\u00f0 Stenberg's vocal style is powerful and emotive.": [{"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01108/full", "page_content": "Similarities and differences between speech and song are often examined. However, the perceptual definition of these two types of vocalization is challenging. Indeed, the prototypical characteristics of speech or song support top-down processes, which influence listeners' perception of acoustic information. In order to examine vocal features associated with speaking and singing, we propose an innovative approach designed to facilitate bottom-up mechanisms in perceiving vocalizations by using material situated between speech and song: Speechsong. 25 participants were asked to evaluate 20 performances of a speechsong composition by Arnold Schoenberg, \u201cPierrot lunaire\u201d op. 21 from 1912, evaluating 20 features of vocal-articulatory expression. Raters provided reliable judgments concerning the vocal features used by the performers and did not show strong appeal or specific expectations in reference to Schoenberg's piece. By examining the relationship between the vocal features and the impression of song or speech, the results confirm the importance of pitch (height, contour, range), but also point to the relevance of register, timbre, tension and faucal distance. Besides highlighting vocal features associated with speech and song, this study supports the relevance of the present approach of focusing on a theoretical middle category in order to better understand vocal expression in song and speech.\n\nIntroduction\n\nLanguage and music processing have been the subject of comparison for decades. Patient studies have revealed a dissociation between pitch processing in language and music (e.g., Peretz and Coltheart, 2003), but studies on music expertise and its transfer in the language domain support shared processes (e.g., Patel, 2008). While conclusions are still being discussed, researchers agree that the comparison of sung material to speech is interesting due to their shared properties. Indeed, both signals are produced with the same instrument (Titze, 1994, 2008; Sundberg, 2013) and share comparable structure (i.e., modulation of a monophonic acoustical signal over time, presence of lyrics/articulatory features, and following of syntactic rules; Koelsch, 2011). However, the comparison of speech and song requires a deep understanding of their respective characteristics and therefore a clarification of what makes a vocalization stand out as speech or song.\n\nProduction of Vocal Features in Speech vs. Song\n\nVocal production basically consists of oscillating movements of the vocal cords, initiated and sustained by the air stream from the lungs (Titze, 1994, 2008). Pitch control in speech and song is achieved by the combination of tension and geometry of muscles in the larynx and sub-glottal pressure (Sundberg, 2013). Also, the vocal cavity and its geometry serve the function of a filter, which produces frequency bands of enhanced power in the vocal sound (Fant, 1960). However, sound modulations have been described as being different depending on the purpose of the vocalization (i.e., singing vs. speaking).\n\nRegarding the pitch dimension, the German linguist Sievers (1912) described the difference between music and speech as early as 1912: \u201cMusic works mainly with fixed tones of steady pitch, speech moves mainly in gliding tones that rise and fall from one pitch to the other within one and the same syllable. Speech in particular is not bound to discrete pitches and intervals of musical melodies: it knows approximate tone levels only.\u201d A 100 years later, this is the main difference described in current publications (e.g., Patel, 2008; Zatorre and Baum, 2012). When investigating the acoustical features in song and speech production, the patterns that most stand out in visual inspection of the spectrogram are the straight, horizontal lines in song when holding a tone and the ups and downs of fundamental frequency (F0) when examining speech signals (for a good visualization, see Zatorre and Baum, 2012). That means, when investigating the acoustical features of the pitch patterns (pitch contour, melodies) in music and speech, a fundamental difference remains in the gliding, continuously changing pitch in speech and the discrete pitch in music; and while musical melodies are built around a stable set of pitch intervals (according to Western tonal music), spoken prosody is not (e.g., Patel, 2008). The variations of pitch in music are rather fine grained (one or two semitones; Vos and Troost, 1989), while in speech they can be rather coarse, for example, up to more than 12 semitones (Patel et al., 2008). Note that music seems to reflect patterns of durational contrast between successive vowels in spoken sentences, as well as patterns of pitch interval variability in speech (Patel et al., 2006) but, in singing, vowels are typically elongated to achieve the rhythm dictated by the musical text and to convey the pitch assigned to a specific syllable.\n\nBesides the numerous studies comparing pitch production in speech and song, few studies have investigated the differences between speech and song with regard to other features such as vocal quality (Lundy et al., 2000; Livingstone et al., 2014; Gafni and Tsur, 2015), tension or articulation. In order to describe the peculiarities in spoken and sung signals (by applying acoustical analyses to the vocalization), a crucial step consists of understanding what is relevant to listeners when perceiving vocalizations as either speech or song.\n\nPerception and Evaluation of Vocal Features in Speech vs. Song\n\nOn a perceptual level, clear speech and song stimuli can easily be distinguished by listeners, while the classification of ambiguous stimuli into the categories of song and speech is an individually varying process (Merrill et al., 2016). The distinction and classification of the two modes of phonation may result from the development of expectations about each domain. Indeed, the functions/contexts of these two activities are clearly distinguished from an early age (McMullen and Saffran, 2004). More generally, categorization is facilitated (if not driven) by top-down cognitive processes that constrain the listener's perception and therefore judgment. The phenomenon of categorical perception has been extensively studied on several perceptual dimensions (Harnad, 1987; for a review on the phenomenon, see, Goldstone and Hendrickson, 2010), such as categorization of phonemes (Liberman et al., 1957), categorization of environmental sounds (Giordano et al., 2014), prosodic contour (Sammler et al., 2015), or speaker gender (Latinus et al., 2013). The existence of distinct categories relative to speech and song is also supported by the well-known speech-to-song illusion (Deutsch, 2003; Deutsch et al., 2008, 2011; Tierney et al., 2013; Jaisin et al., 2016). By listening to a spoken phrase several times, listeners perceive the phrase as sung. This simple and compelling experiment suggests that the categorization of a performance as speech or song does not rely on the acoustical characteristics (always the same) but rather on the repetition effect leading to the reinterpretation of the material as musical (Falk et al., 2014). However, when listening to a single sound or isolated phrase (i.e., not repeated and without previous exposition to the phrase), listeners are able to detect a clear spoken or sung utterance (Merrill et al., 2016) and therefore rely on acoustical parameters of the signal itself or on perceptual impressions.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the vocal features underlying the perception of a vocalization as song or speech remain unclear. One reason might be due to the proximity/similarity of several acoustic features usually examined (Tierney et al., 2013), which could overshadow the subtle differences in other acoustical features perceived by listeners. Another reason might be the lack of adequate tools to examine listeners' perception of vocal features in both sung and spoken material. Some questionnaires are specific to singing (e.g., Henrich et al., 2008), while others are specific to speech (e.g., the Geneva Voice Perception Scale, Banziger et al., 2014), making difficult a direct comparison of the impressions of spoken and sung vocalizations. A questionnaire was designed to capture the vocal-articulatory impression of vocal expression on many levels (Bose, 2001, 2010), and can be used in different contexts, such as describing adults as well as children's speech (Bose, 2001), artistic and emotional speech (Wendt, 2007). Items are grouped into different major categories with regard to pitch, loudness, sound of voice and their subsequent modifications, articulation and complex descriptions of vocal expression such as mode of phonation (speaking, speechsong, singing etc.), rhythm, or tempo. By relying exclusively on listeners' perception, this tool overcomes the limits of acoustical analyses (i.e., acoustical differences between sound signals are not necessarily relevant to listeners) and was used for the first time to examine the vocal features leading to the perception of speech and song.\n\nAnother important reason concerns the choice of material to examine. In order to focus on the perceptual impressions of listeners, particular attention must be paid to limit the top-down cognitive processes behind categorization of vocalization (Falk et al., 2014; Margulis et al., 2015; Vanden Bosch der Nederlanden et al., 2015; Jaisin et al., 2016). Schematically, human perception is influenced by the existence of preset categories and expectations based on these categories (i.e., top-down processes) as well as the physical features of the stimuli (i.e., bottom-up processes). As the same principle applies to vocalization, examining the perception of acoustic features or listeners' impressions requires the use of material which is neither typical to the language nor to the music domain. Unfortunately, speech and song are rarely melded in a single performance, except in art forms such as poetry or rap music (Wallin et al., 2000; Fritz et al., 2013) or in a musical phenomenon called \u201cspeech-song\u201d (Stadlen, 1981). Speechsong (or \u201cSprechgesang\u201d in German) can be described as an expressionist vocal technique resembling an intermediate state between speech and song. By its nature, speechsong seems to be an adequate candidate to suppress the categories \u201cspeech\u201d and \u201csong,\u201d and therefore allows for examination of listeners' perceptual impressions.\n\nThe Case of Speechsong\n\nBuilding partly on earlier forms combining prosodic aspects of speech and music, such as the recitative and the melodrama, the form of speechsong in Western Art Music has been around for over 100 years, and its reception has fallen very far from any other type of vocal performance. The piece used in the current study is the representative of speechsong at the brink of modernity: Three times Seven Poems from Albert Giraud's \u201cPierrot lunaire\u201d op. 21 for speaking voice and chamber orchestra by Arnold Schoenberg, written in 1912. The music lacks a tonal center, called atonal, and is a highly discussed piece by musicologists and performers alike. The 21 poems are composed into 21 short pieces. Instructions on how to perform Pierrot can be found in its preface and are represented in the musical score by a special musical symbol for the vocal part. The most important instruction was that the melody \u201cshould definitely not be sung\u201d but had to be \u201ctransformed into a speech melody\u201d (Schoenberg, 1914). Furthermore, \u201cthe difference between a sung pitch and a spoken pitch should be clear: a sung pitch is held and does not change, whereas a spoken pitch is intoned, then left by rising or falling in pitch\u201d (Schoenberg, 1914). It is also interesting that Schoenberg did not only differentiate his notated vocal part from singing, but also from normal speaking: \u201cThe difference between normal speaking and speaking as part of a musical structure should be clear\u201d (Schoenberg, 1914). It is also of note that he instructed that the notated rhythm be precise. Hence, the performer has the task of achieving the impression of speaking by following a notated rhythm with long notes, fixed pitch and a pitch range covering 2.5 octaves (from E flat 3 to G sharp 5). All this together constituted significant challenges for the performer, which were further addressed by the composer later: \u201cThe pitches in Pierrot depend on the range of the voice. They are to be considered \u2018good\u2019 but not to be \u2018strictly adhered to\u2019. [\u2026] Of course, the speaking level is not enough. The lady must just learn to speak in her \u2018head voice\u2019\u2026\u201d (Schoenberg, 1923). His idea of the vocal part was not limited to melodic accuracy though, as the overall vocal expression was considered important, such as \u201cto capture the light, ironical, satirical tone [\u2026] in which this composition was originally conceived\u201d (Schoenberg, 1940). Taken together, a degree of freedom is given with regard to the pitches and performers regularly narrow down the compass of their voice and produce relative intervals between pitches (Cerha, 2001, p. 67). This has been evidenced by empirical investigations about Pierrot performances, focusing on the melodic accuracy with regard to the musical score, i.e., counting exact and deviating pitches and correct and incorrect pitch interval relations (Heinitz, 1925), and making assumptions about the relationship between the notated melodies and linguistic and emotional prosody (Hettergott, 1993; Rapoport, 2004, 2006).\n\nOur main objective consists of clarifying the features of vocal expression associated with speaking and singing on an impressionistic level. We propose an innovative approach that aims at minimizing the top-down processes influencing listeners' perception of auditory information. Concretely, listeners are asked to evaluate various interpretations of a representative speechsong composition with an extensive questionnaire. It is expected that such material will not clearly be considered speech or song. To examine the relationship between evaluations of the mode of phonation (i.e., speaking and singing) and a variety of features, including not only features of the pitch domain but also of vocal sound and articulation, voice experts were chosen as participants. By achieving evaluations at this detailed level, we aim at clarifying what causes a vocalization to be perceived as speech or song.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nEthics Statement\n\nAll experimental procedures were ethically approved by the Ethics Council of the Max Planck Society, and were undertaken with written informed consent of each participant.\n\nParticipants\n\nThe raters were 25 university students from the field of speech science and phonetics (20 female, mean age = 23.3 years, SD = 1.14). They were equally trained in the auditory description of voices and in using different vocal assessment scales, and most importantly, in the questionnaire used in the current study. Their expertise was verified by taking their study program into account, which demonstrates their level of training, proven by corresponding periodical and final examinations (e.g., Bachelor's degree). The raters were all German native speakers. All of them had had singing training and/or played an instrument (range 4\u201318 years of training, M = 6.76) and 14 of them were still practicing music at the time of the experiment. One participant had a master's degree in Music (main instrument was the trumpet), one in acting, one in classical singing, five participants were trained speech therapists. Note that participants were unfamiliar with the piece under study prior to the testing session, which ensures comparable knowledge among participants.\n\nThe Musical Piece\n\nFrom the composition Pierrot lunaire, the piece No. 7 \u201cThe Sick Moon\u201d was chosen because of the sparse accompaniment, which is the flute only, so that the voice could be heard clearly. The lyrics were in the original German. The chosen excerpt ended with the first stanza. The excerpts were between 35 and 55 s long, depending on the chosen tempo by the performer. The pitch range of the excerpt is from D 4 to E flat 5 and the dynamic range is small, ranging from pianissimo to piano with several short crescendi and a decrescendo.\n\nThe Recordings\n\nTable 1 shows the 20 interpretations used in the study. The recordings range from 1940 to ca. 2010, representing a wide range and great variety of interpretations. The earliest one was conducted by Schoenberg himself, followed by recordings from his friends and colleagues Josef Rufer and Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz (1949 and ca. 1954, respectively). Pierre Boulez recorded the piece three times with a different performer each time.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nTable 1. List of recordings.\n\nThe Questionnaire on Vocal-Articulatory Expression\n\nThe questionnaire was developed by speech scientists (in German, Bose, 2001, 2010) as a tool for describing the vocal-articulatory expression in (German) speech. As illustrated in Table 3, the tool is set up to combine features that represent auditory impressions, not acoustic measures. Items are grouped into different major categories (N represents the number of items selected for the current study) with regard to pitch and its modifications (N = 4), loudness (N = 1), sound of voice and its modifications (N = 14), articulation (N = 3) and complex descriptions of vocal expression (N = 4), such as mode of phonation (sung or spoken) or rhythm. The modifications are described by means of the variability (e.g., for pitch inflected or monotone), the range (wide or narrow), and the changes between tones or syllables (sudden or continuous). Items pertaining to the sound of voice are manifold, e.g., faucal distance describes a wide or constricted pharynx, the sound of the onsets and offsets of the voice are described with hard and soft (for detailed description of the features and more extensive background information on the questionnaire, please refer to Bose, 2001). For the current study, the profile was slightly adapted to the musical piece under study. An item about the register and blending of the voice and the flute was added, while the category of loudness was reduced down to its range since the possibilities were limited in the recordings used. Overall, the questionnaire consisted of 27 items: 20 items were specific to vocal expression (5-point scale; six items on a 3-point scale, see Table 2), one item concerned the flute and the voice (5-point scale). Note that the use of such a questionnaire requires experience in voice diagnostics and/or familiarity with the specific vocabulary and dimensions to evaluate. Because lay people cannot differentiate, for example, between a rough and a breathy voice (Kreiman and Gerratt, 1998), the present study focuses on the evaluation by voice experts.\n\nTABLE 2\n\nTable 2. Questionnaire on vocal-articulatory expression.\n\nIn the present study the questionnaire was used to examine voices in an artistic/musical context; the midpoint of the rating scale, which usually describes a neutral midpoint, was now representing the perception of a feature being \u201cjust about right\u201d (JAR) to account for the listeners' expectations of the vocal part. If a feature was perceived as \u201cnot right,\u201d then the rater could choose the direction in which it deviated from JAR. In the case of the perceived \u201caverage pitch\u201d of a voice, it could be \u201ctoo high\u201d and \u201cmuch too high\u201d or \u201ctoo low\u201d and \u201cmuch too low.\u201d The rating scale was adapted from studies in consumer product testing (Popper et al., 2004; Popper and Kroll, 2005) and has been used to evaluate piano performances (Kroger and Margulis, 2017). As can be seen in Table 2, most items were bipolar (e.g., the average pitch can be high or low), the items on noisiness and modulations of the voice were unipolar, e.g., the vibrato could be rated as \u201cjust about right\u201d or not. These items were only rated upon when present in the voice.\n\nThe JAR-scale can be coded in two different ways: A coding from 1 to 5 takes the bipolar scale into account; A coding accumulating the deviations from JAR allows focusing on the \u201cJAR-ness,\u201d i.e., a feature being either JAR (value 0) or non-JAR with \u201ctoo X\u201d (1) and \u201cmuch too X\u201d (2).\n\nBesides these items of vocal expression, two general questions were proposed at the beginning of the questionnaire: overall liking and adequateness. Liking ratings are based, for instance, on the individual musical preferences and spoken arts perception, or on liking of the voice etc. Adequateness ratings, on the other hand, were dependent on the background information provided to the participants about Pierrot (see below). The questionnaire was concluded with two additional questions: \u201cDo you consider the interpretation as coherent (additional meaning of the German phrase might be expressed by \u2018harmonious\u2019 and \u2018cohesive\u2019)?\u201d (yes/no) and \u201cWhat is the profession of the performer?\u201d (Singer, speaker or actress). The ratings for profession were challenging (i.e., both \u201cspeaker\u201d and \u201cactress\u201d boxes were often ticked together in the present study) and might be more informative when coded as binary variables, i.e., singer and actress. Coherence is about the overall impression of the performance (including voice and flute) and reflects the listener's expectations regarding the interpretation of the piece.\n\nProcedure\n\nPrior to the listening task, an introduction to the composer and the piece under study was presented by the experimenter, including Schoenberg's dates of birth and death and selected historical-musicological background information, i.e., his role in shifting from tonality to atonality in music as well as the importance of Pierrot with regard to the extraordinary use of the vocal part. With regard to the musical piece, the preface to Pierrot was presented, as well as selected quotes from Schoenberg (all presented in the Introduction \u201cThe case of speechsong\u201d). The goal was to form a knowledge basis for the raters who were partly not familiar with Schoenberg and not at all familiar with the piece Pierrot lunaire. Also, the musical score of the beginning of the first piece (i.e., not the chosen piece) was presented in order to illustrate the peculiar musical notation of the vocal part. The participants also listened to four very different interpretations beforehand (which were not included in the respective experimental session) to get an idea on the range of possible interpretations, and to get to know the chosen piece, \u201cThe Sick Moon.\u201d\n\nDuring the rating sessions, excerpts were played three times, in a pseudo random order, counter balanced between two groups. After the first presentation, participants rated the overall liking and the adequateness. Then, while listening to the piece two more times, they rated the items on vocal expression as well as the additional questions. Participants were informed that they do not have to fill out the items in the order presented. Participants rated all 20 recordings in two sessions (70\u201390 min each).\n\nStatistical Analyses\n\nSince both the musical piece and the extraordinary vocal performance were unfamiliar to listeners, inter-rater agreement at the level of features of vocal expression was estimated following the procedure described in Larrouy-Maestri et al. (2013). Pairwise Spearman coefficient correlations between the 25 participants (rating 20 items for each of the 20 interpretations) were computed. On the basis of the correlation matrix, the proportion of significant correlations as well as their median correlation coefficient are reported. The agreement of the more general questions was investigated following similar procedures, using Spearman coefficients for the two scales (i.e., liking and adequateness) and using the phi coefficient for the two categorical variables (i.e., cohesion and profession). Differences in agreement level depending on the general question were tested with Chi-square tests.\n\nNext, the relationship between the features and general questions was examined by means of linear regression analyses for liking and adequateness ratings and logistic regression analyses for coherence and profession ratings (using the JAR-ness scale 0\u20132). Each analysis was carried out with the 20 items as potential predictors. Spearman coefficient correlations were computed between the \u201cinfluential\u201d items (using the 1\u20135 scale) and the general questions. For instance, if the coefficient correlation did not reach significance, low liking is related to high scores in both directions (e.g., average pitch of the voice being \u201ctoo low\u201d or \u201ctoo high\u201d). If the coefficient correlation was significant and positive, low liking was associated with the item on the left side of the scale (see Table 2). In the case of a negative correlation coefficient, low liking was associated with the item on the right side of the scale.\n\nFinally, the relation between the mode of phonation and the other items in the questionnaire was examined with Spearman correlations using Bonferroni adjusted alpha levels of 0.003 in order to investigate features related to performances being perceived as \u201ctoo (much) sung.\u201d Correlations were performed on the values 1, 2, 4, and 5, to focus on the direction of the relations. Also, a particularly relevant feature was investigated further with a Chi-square test. Here, the ratings were accumulated such that the mean was taken from each direction of the rating scale to only have one value representing song and one representing speech. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 22.\n\nSome items were only ticked occasionally and were not further analyzed, i.e., the items on noisiness and modulations (overall N \u2264 14), as well as the item about the blending of flute and voice as almost all ratings were toward \u201cdisharmonic.\u201d\n\nResults\n\nInter-Rater Agreement\n\nWith regard to the features of vocal expression, the median correlation coefficient for the full scales (1\u20135) was r = 0.339 (SD = 0.072). Despite the moderate median correlation, all the combinations reached the significance level of p < 0.05. The proportion of positive and significant correlations (for the liking and adequateness questions) and phi coefficients (for the coherence and profession questions) are reported in Table 3.\n\nTABLE 3\n\nTable 3. Inter-rater agreement.\n\nIn contrast to the high agreement of the participants when rating features of vocal expression (i.e., 100% of the correlations were positive and significant), the proportion of agreement regarding general liking, adequateness, coherence, and profession of the performers, was much lower (see Table 3). Chi-square tests confirmed the difference in agreement level depending on the general question proposed. Agreement of participants increased significantly following the order of Table 3 (left to right): Coherence \u2013 Adequateness [ \u03c7 ( 4 ) 2 = 313.55, p < 0.001], Adequateness \u2013 Liking [ \u03c7 ( 4 ) 2 = 326.10, p < 0.001], Liking \u2013 Profession [ \u03c7 ( 4 ) 2 = 312.176, p < 0.001].\n\nImportantly, despite the relatively low agreement on the general level, it was observed that when participants provided similar ratings, the median or mean correlation coefficients were \u201chigh\u201d (>0.5) and presented low variability. In other words, few participants shared the same opinion, but when it was the case, they strongly agreed regarding the liking, adequateness, coherence and the profession of the performer.\n\nRelationship between the Features and General Questions\n\nLiking\n\nRegarding participants' liking, a significant regression equation was found, F (20, 433) = 19.647, p < 0.001. As can be seen in Table 4, several items contributed in explaining 47.6% of the variance of the Liking ratings. According to the Spearman correlations, low liking was associated with a high average pitch, a thin and hard sound of voice, a constricted pharynx and lengthened vowels. Low liking was also associated with pitch variability and changes, the variance of the sound and mode of phonation. However, the ratings of these items were evenly dispersed on both sides of the scale, e.g., \u201ctoo sung\u201d and \u201ctoo spoken\u201d were both associated with low liking. More generally, it is of note that the performances were not particularly liked, with a median of 4 on the scale (IQR = 1\u20136).\n\nTABLE 4\n\nTable 4. Regression analyses.\n\nAdequateness\n\nAs with the liking rating, a significant regression equation was found for the adequateness scale, F (20, 433) = 7.518, p < 0.001. Several items contributed in explaining 25.8% of the variance of adequateness ratings (see Table 4). Spearman correlations reveal that low adequateness was associated with continuous pitch changes, imprecise articulation and lengthened consonants. The items on average pitch and mode of phonation were not linearly correlated with the ratings on adequateness. Again, both directions were associated with low adequateness.\n\nCoherence\n\nThe logistic regression model was statistically significant, \u03c7 ( 20 ) 2 = 142.65, p < 0.001. The model explained 37.3% (Nagelkerke R2) of the variance in coherence ratings and correctly classified 77.4% of cases. Increasing the ratings of pitch variability and range, timbre, faucal distance and vowel duration on the JAR-ness scale, increased the likelihood of perceiving the interpretation as incoherent (i.e., answer \u201cno\u201d). Incoherence was associated with lengthened vowels, a dark timbre and a wide pharynx as well as an inflected and monotone pitch variability and a wide and narrow pitch range.\n\nProfession\n\nThe logistic regression model was statistically significant, \u03c7 ( 20 ) 2 = 96.48, p < 0.001. The model explained 26.2% (Nagelkerke R2) of the variance in profession ratings and correctly classified 74.0% of cases. \u201cToo much\u201d singing and a \u201ctoo soft\u201d sound of voice are associated with the fact that performers are perceived as singers whereas the choice of an actress (or speaker) was associated with \u201ctoo much spoken\u201d and a \u201ctoo hard\u201d vocal sound.\n\nTo conclude, the results show a significant agreement of the participants concerning specific items and a moderate agreement concerning general questions. Disregarding any specific interpretations, regression analyses highlight some particularly salient items when listening to and rating Schoenberg's Pierrot lunaire.\n\nDescription of Speechsong\n\nThe Spearman coefficient correlations highlight that singing correlates strongly with a high pitched voice (r = 0.513, p < 0.001), head voice (r = 0.313, p < 0.001) and a bright timbre (r = 0.335, p < 0.001). An inflected pitch contour (r = \u22120.208, p = 0.009), a wide pitch range (r = \u22120.188, p = 0.036), a wide faucal distance (r = \u22120.202, p = 0.019), and a tense phonation (r = \u22120.222, p = 0.008) might also be associated with singing. The feature of pitch changes showed only a tendency toward continuously changing pitch correlating with singing (r = 0.143, p = 0.067). For an illustration of the relationships, see Figure 1.\n\nFIGURE 1\n\nFigure 1. Features associated with song and speech. Illustration of the significant correlations between the different features (register, average pitch, pitch range, pitch variability, timbre, faucal distance, and tension; y-axis) and mode of phonation (spoken vs. sung, around \u201cjust about right,\u201d JAR; x-axis).\n\nIn light of the importance of this feature in the literature, it was of interest to investigate it further in order to get a more conclusive picture about the relation between the pitch changes and mode of phonation. Firstly, a Pearson Chi-Square test confirmed that the perception of pitch changes [ \u03c7 ( 4 ) 2 = 22.240, p < 0.001] significantly differs depending on the perception of mode of phonation. Secondly, the cross table (Table 5) revealed that the expected count in three fields out of four is less than expected. In the row of \u201csinging\u201d ratings, sudden pitch changes show a count lower than expected, continuous pitch changes on the other hand show a count higher than expected. With respect to JAR-ratings, more continuous pitch changes are expected for JAR-phonation, pointing toward a reduced acceptance of pitch glides in speechsong performances.\n\nTABLE 5\n\nTable 5. Cross-table pitch changes.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study describes a new approach designed to clarify the vocal features used to categorize speech and song. By examining the perception of vocal expression when listening to several interpretations of speechsong, which is neither typical for speech nor song, we focused on the perceptual impressions of listeners.\n\nCharacteristics of Mode of Phonation\n\nThe present approach and material allow for review and extension of existing proposals on the differences between song and speech, which until now have been mainly described with regard to pitch patterns of speech prosody and sung melody (e.g., discrete pitches and gliding pitch patterns, range and interval size). The current study allows for examination of several aspects of pitch and confirms typical behaviors in singing, such as a wider pitch range, high pitched voice and an inflected pitch contour (e.g., Patel, 2008; Zatorre and Baum, 2012; Mecke et al., 2016). Interestingly, the often mentioned difference in pitch changes was not supported. On the contrary, continuous pitch changes show a higher count than expected for singing and not speaking, suggesting that exaggerating the pitch glides leads to the impression of singing and does not enhance the impression of speaking. As a consequence, the pitch glides do not seem to be a stable indicator for speech. Depending on how pronounced the glides are produced, the perception might shift toward singing.\n\nIn addition to the usual pitch related features, the present study revealed that mode of phonation is associated with more features of vocal expression. As expected, head voice was associated with singing, but most frequently, if mode of phonation was just about right, the register was likewise just about right. Chest voice was underrepresented in the current material, and the combination of \u201ctoo spoken\u201d and \u201ctoo much head voice\u201d (despite Schoenberg's comments on speaking in head voice) was almost non-existent\u2014which might also reflect listeners' basic assumption of the impossibility of this occurrence. According to our exploratory study, other features such as a tense phonation (reflecting high muscular activity), a wide faucal distance (reflecting a wide pharynx, lift of the soft palate and a low larynx), and a bright timbre (reflecting efficient use of resonance cavities), might also be associated with singing perception. Note that the association of spectral characteristics with singing is not surprising since they are particularly favored (if not specifically trained) in classical singing (Miller, 1986, 1996; Mitchell et al., 2003; Isherwood, 2013) and since listeners, even without formal training in music, are sensitive to such features (Larrouy-Maestri et al., 2017).\n\nBy asking for the assumed profession of the performer, our objective was to gain information on singing and speaking indirectly. As revealed by the logistic regression, singers and speakers were divided by soft and hard vocal onsets, respectively, but most importantly by mode of phonation (i.e., performers were perceived as singers if the performance was \u201ctoo sung\u201d and vice versa for speakers). This seems to reflect causality (i.e., attribution of a profession according to mode of phonation) but the hypothesis of an opposite relation (i.e., attribution of mode of phonation according to the profession) cannot be rejected. The fact that raters attribute the performance to a specific profession might lead to specific expectations (Falk et al., 2014; Vanden Bosch der Nederlanden et al., 2015) and thus bias the judgment toward speech or song. Future research controlling for the expected profession of the performer (e.g., by explicitly instructing the participants about the performer being an actor or a singer) would allow for clarification of the relationship observed between these two items.\n\nAltogether, these findings extend the current knowledge on vocal features of speech and song, highlighting aspects of pitch, register, tension and timbre. Further research is encouraged to replicate the current findings by testing other \u201cecological\u201d types of hybrid vocalizations, such as Rap, Jazz, or Musical Theater style singing or infant-directed speech. Phenomena such as speechsong are particularly interesting to the study of categorization processes, because they utilize our interest in ambiguous material in an artistic context, i.e., they esthetically challenge our internalized impressions of typical song and speech. By composers and performers playing with these expectations, researchers get information on the possible adjustments of certain vocal features. Finally, the identification of relevant features (i.e., associated with the perception of mode of phonation) paves the way to a better understanding of the perception and categorization processes of song and speech. The precise description of these features with acoustical analyses, and their systematic manipulations, will certainly clarify the categorization of vocal expression.\n\nNotes on \u201cLiking,\u201d \u201cAdequateness,\u201d and \u201cCoherence\u201d\n\nDespite the frequent use of such terminology, the concepts behind are either highly subjective or difficult to grasp, as reflected in the relatively low inter-rater agreement. In the current study, adequateness was meant to describe the degree in which the performer succeeded in meeting the composer's intentions. Despite the low agreement and the percentage of explained variance (25%), relevant items noted by the composer such as mode of phonation, average pitch and pitch changes predicted the ratings' variance. Unlike liking-ratings, which showed a higher percentage of explained variance (47%), the evaluation of adequateness might rely on additional features which were not proposed in the questionnaire. Alternatively, the low percentage of explained variance regarding adequateness ratings could be due to missing information about this peculiar piece prior to testing.\n\nWith the subjective question on liking, the current study tackles the question of vocal appreciation in the context of speechsong. While the dislike of features such as a high pitched voice, a thin and hard vocal sound and a constricted pharynx might be explained in a broader context of pathological vocal sounds, other features such as lengthened vowels, pitch changes and variability might be very specific to the context of the rated piece. This points to the relevance of investigating other (and maybe more liked) material to control for the appreciation of listeners when examining the perception of speechsong.\n\nFinally, the concept of coherence reflects the listener's impression of the performance in general (which includes the flute and the voice). It can be interpreted as which features do not fit in with the listeners' expectations of the interpretation of the piece. An incoherent interpretation was associated with a monotone and inflected pitch contour, a wide and narrow pitch range and shortened vowels. Notably, these features are set by the musical score, which might mean that listeners base their expectations on what is typically confined by the sheet music.\n\nNotes on the Questionnaire\n\nThe questionnaire to evaluate features of vocal-articulatory expression was adapted to describe vocal performances producing speechsong. The questionnaire is an attempt to cover vocal expression with several items to achieve detailed descriptions of listeners' impressions. This tool might not replace acoustical analyses of vocal features but provides the information required (i.e., perception of vocal expression) for further investigation of relevant acoustical features. The high reliability of the raters with regard to the features of vocal expression suggests that raters understood the items in this specific context. Also, the JAR-scale, implemented to give a midpoint that would reflect their acceptance of the features in the given situation, provides useful indications regarding listeners' judgments beyond a pure description of the material. Concluding from the high agreement among judges, despite the variability in terms of formal musical background, this finding supports that the adaptation of the questionnaire was successful and is adequate to describe vocal expression in speechsong. From these results one can assume that an internal validation of the questionnaire might be successful, which would require systematically manipulated stimuli including acoustical analyses as well as comparison with other questionnaires. Further evidence that the questionnaire fulfilled its purpose is the result that the ratings actually relate to the context information given by the experimenter.\n\nThe chosen questionnaire is meant to be a dynamic tool that can be adapted to different situations and listeners. Its use in the present form implies listeners' expertise in auditory description of voices (more due to the labeling of features than to perception itself) and thus limits its application to a specific group of participants. However, it could be adapted to lay listeners by providing additional instructions. Here, the features lay listeners are able to evaluate need to be investigated and are at the same time relevant for the discrimination of song and speech. The ratings by voice experts should be used as a baseline. Therefore, this tool seemed to be particularly relevant in the present context and might be used in future research on different vocal material.\n\nConclusion\n\nBy examining listeners' perception of Schoenberg's Pierrot lunaire with regard to several features of vocal-articulatory expression, the present study highlights the features influencing the impression of song and speech in ecologically valid material. Keeping in mind the limitations due to the peculiar character of the piece under study, we observed the relevance of pitch, register, tension, and timbre. Besides clarifying the vocal features leading listeners' perception of a vocalization as being speech or song, our findings support the adequacy of both the chosen ambiguous material and the proposed questionnaire in investigating speech/song categorization. Also, this approach paves the way to further studies using other hybrid material as well as acoustically controlled manipulations of sounds to precisely define the acoustical characteristics driving speech and song perception and therefore to better understand the similarities/differences between music and language perception.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nJM conceptualized and conducted the research.

Those spontaneous sounds we make to express everything from elation (woohoo) to embarrassment (oops) say a lot more about what we\u2019re feeling than previously understood, according to new UC Berkeley research.\n\nProving that a sigh is not just a sigh, scientists conducted a statistical analysis of listener responses to more than 2,000 nonverbal exclamations known as \u201cvocal bursts\u201d and found they convey at least 24 kinds of emotion. Previous studies of vocal bursts set the number of recognizable emotions closer to 13.\n\nThe results, recently published online in the American Psychologist journal, are demonstrated in vivid sound and color on the first-ever interactive audio map of nonverbal vocal communication.\n\n\u201cThis study is the most extensive demonstration of our rich emotional vocal repertoire, involving brief signals of upwards of two dozen emotions as intriguing as awe, adoration, interest, sympathy, and embarrassment,\u201d said study senior author Dacher Keltner, a psychology professor at UC Berkeley and faculty director of the Greater Good Science Center, which helped support the research.\n\nFor millions of years, humans have used wordless vocalizations to communicate feelings that can be decoded in a matter of seconds, as this latest study demonstrates.\n\n\u201cOur findings show that the voice is a much more powerful tool for expressing emotion than previously assumed,\u201d said study lead author Alan Cowen, a Ph.D. student in psychology at UC Berkeley.\n\nOn Cowen\u2019s audio map, one can slide one\u2019s cursor across the emotional topography and hover over fear (scream), then surprise (gasp), then awe (woah), realization (ohhh), interest (ah?), and finally confusion (huh?).\n\nAmong other applications, the map can be used to help teach voice-controlled digital assistants and other robotic devices to better recognize human emotions based on the sounds we make, he said.\n\nAs for clinical uses, the map could theoretically guide medical professionals and researchers working with people with dementia, autism, and other emotional processing disorders to zero in on specific emotion-related deficits.\n\n\u201cIt lays out the different vocal emotions that someone with a disorder might have difficulty understanding,\u201d Cowen said. \u201cFor example, you might want to sample the sounds to see if the patient is recognizing nuanced differences between, say, awe and confusion.\u201d\n\nThough limited to U.S. responses, the study suggests humans are so keenly attuned to nonverbal signals\u2014such as the bonding \u201ccoos\u201d between parents and infants\u2014that we can pick up on the subtle differences between surprise and alarm, or an amused laugh versus an embarrassed laugh.\n\nFor example, by placing the cursor in the embarrassment region of the map, you might find a vocalization that is recognized as a mix of amusement, embarrassment, and positive surprise.\n\n\u201cA tour through amusement reveals the rich vocabulary of laughter, and a spin through the sounds of adoration, sympathy, ecstasy, and desire may tell you more about romantic life than you might expect,\u201d said Keltner.\n\nHow they conducted the study\n\nResearchers recorded more than 2,000 vocal bursts from 56 male and female professional actors and non-actors from the United States, India, Kenya, and Singapore by asking them to respond to emotionally evocative scenarios.\n\nNext, more than 1,000 adults recruited online listened to the vocal bursts and evaluated them based on the emotions and meaning they conveyed and whether the tone was positive or negative, among several other characteristics.\n\nA statistical analysis of their responses found that the vocal bursts fit into at least two dozen distinct categories, including amusement, anger, awe, confusion, contempt, contentment, desire, disappointment, disgust, distress, ecstasy, elation, embarrassment, fear, interest, pain, realization, relief, sadness, surprise (positive), surprise (negative), sympathy, and triumph.\n\nFor the second part of the study, researchers sought to present real-world contexts for the vocal bursts. They did this by sampling YouTube video clips that would evoke the 24 emotions established in the first part of the study, such as babies falling, puppies being hugged, and spellbinding magic tricks.\n\nThis time, 88 adults of all ages judged the vocal bursts extracted from YouTube videos. Again, the researchers were able to categorize their responses into 24 shades of emotion. The full set of data were then organized into a semantic space on an interactive map.\n\n\u201cThese results show that emotional expressions color our social interactions with spirited declarations of our inner feelings that are difficult to fake, and that our friends, coworkers, and loved ones rely on to decipher our true commitments,\u201d Cowen said.\n\nThis article was originally published on Berkeley News.

Your performance, your look, your voice, and your repertoire are all parts of your style.\n\nStyle is really just a combination of the unique things that make you an artist.\n\nHowever, like any style or brand, you do not always get full control of the things people say and think about you as an artist.\n\nThis is why it is so important to be able to talk about your music and style in an easy-to-understand and interesting way.\n\nSo how do you describe your style?\n\nOne way is using the tricks that got you interested in a new artist.\n\nHow did you first hear about Adele, Sam Smith, or Ed Sheeran?\n\nIt was probably through a friend who said something like this:\n\n\u201cOh there\u2019s this new great artist! You have to listen to them! They sound just like _____ but with _____.\u201d\n\nTry filling in those blanks for your own style.\n\nTake a hard look at your repertoire, your voice and the people you sound-like.\n\nYou want to give the other person a picture of your style and what to expect from your music.\n\nGet creative with this!\n\n\u201cOur music sounds like falling in love for the first time.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur band sounds like a beach party at dawn.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur rhythm section is so tight, it makes people dance within seconds.\u201d\n\nAnother way to do this is to read about new music. Circle the artist descriptions that worked on you.\n\nWhat was it that compelled you to listen to that new band when you could have been listening to the same stuff you normally like?\n\nOdds are there was something in the way the magazine/friend/website described the music that drew you in.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to defining your style. But that is what is great about it.\n\nReally, any one of the above example descriptions could apply to anybody\u2019s music.\n\nThe important thing is to get the other person curious about your music while staying true to yourself.\n\nFor every singer, there is a unique vocal style.\n\nI don\u2019t mean that in the \u201ceveryone is special\u201d kind of way.\n\nI actually mean that scientifically, you are the only one who can sound like you.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so sad to me when I work with a singer who\u2019s just trying to copy Adele, Sam Smith, or Amy Winehouse.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong! I love each and every one of those singers.\n\nAnd while it can be very tempting as a beginning singer to try to imitate your favorite singers it\u2019s really important that we work with your voice as it is.\n\nThat\u2019s because if you spend a lot of time and effort trying to sound like other singers, you\u2019re probably manipulating your voice in some unhealthy ways.\n\nBut if you learn to sing without all that baggage of imitating someone else, you\u2019ll experience what your true voice sounds like.\n\nSo how do you find your vocal style that sounds great and is healthy for you?\n\nFirst we\u2019ll talk about what actually makes up vocal style.\n\nThen we\u2019ll talk about how you can find your unique voice.\n\nSound good?\n\nRead on\u2026\n\nHow to Find Your Vocal Style: One Daily Exercise to Find Your Voice\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nThe Elements of Vocal Style\n\nSince people began singing, there has been vocal style.\n\nFrom opera to rock, RnB to musical theater (legit and belt) styles, vocal style is a term that distinguishes one singer from another and each style of music from another.\n\nThat means that vocal style is unique to each person and each genre of music.\n\nBut what really causes someone to have or sing with a vocal style?\n\nThere are two parts to this explanation: a genetic and a musical component.\n\nGenetic Components of Vocal Style\n\nGenetics are definitely at play in vocal style and techniques. Last week, we talked about the three systems that make up singing.\n\nWith vocal style, we\u2019re talking primarily about the phonation and resonation systems of the voice.\n\nPhonation is the system of singing involved at the vocal fold or cord level. Phonation is the vibration that results from the vocal folds coming together to make sound.\n\nResonation is the system of singing where we see an interaction of the frequencies produced by the vocal folds and the cavities and spaces within your body (i.e. throat, nasal passages, and cranium, etc).\n\nBoth the phonation and resonation systems of singing are genetic.\n\nThat means that you\u2019re born with a unique voice because your vocal folds and resonating centers are totally specific to you.\n\nWant to Nail Those High Notes? Every singer wants to expand their range. Expand Your Range Fast will show you how to finally hit high notes in your voice without straining. Expand your range by 5 notes or more! Learn More\n\nThat\u2019s why you can never successfully imitate another singer.\n\nUnless you have the same genetics, chances are your body, vocal cords and resonance chambers will be somewhat different.\n\nThis is why it would be totally unfair to expect a 12 year old girl to imitate Janis Joplin.\n\nJanis had a very thick vocal belt sound and a 12-year-old doesn\u2019t have the thickness in her vocal folds to pull that off.\n\nThe same is true for David Bowie, Freddie Mercury and even Elvis Presley\u2019s vocal style.\n\nIn one of my recent articles, we talked about the 3 Traits All Great Singers Share.\n\nOne of the most important traits we discussed was self awareness.\n\nFor singers, self awareness means gaining an understand of what your voice is built for.\n\nThis is why it would be a poor choice for a high Tenor to sing Tom Waits.\n\nOr if you\u2019re a bass, then Sam Smith might be a stretch.\n\nVocal range and voice type are a huge part of your vocal style.\n\nBut genetics aren\u2019t everything.\n\nAfter all, there are some fantastic singers out there that have an amazingly unique voice or remind us of some other singer.\n\nThat brings us to the musical component to vocal style:\n\nMusical Components to Vocal Style\n\nWhile genetics are hugely important in determining a person\u2019s vocal style, there are singers that are able to find a unique voice in any genre because they are good musicians.\n\nEvery genre of music has its own vocal style.\n\nWhile there are unique voices in every genre, each musical style has a tendency to have a certain kind of singing.\n\nObviously the vocal style for a metal singer is different from a musical theater singer.\n\nThat\u2019s because these genres have evolved to create some standards for what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019d be pretty weird to hear the vocal effects of a metal singer singing \u201cOne Day More\u201d from Les Miz.\n\nI can hear it now: \u201cOne\u2026EE-YAAAHHHH\u2026Day\u2026GRRRRRRR\u2026MOOOOOORRRRE.\u201d\n\nThe point is that as a singer, you can begin to learn the conventions of each music genre so that your vocal style matches the genre.\n\nThe best way to do that is to listen to lots of different music and begin to speak the language of singing.\n\nAre the vocals in rock music more or less aggressive?\n\nIn general, rock vocals are more aggressive.\n\nIs the vocal tone clean or dirty? Usually they\u2019re dirty.\n\nDoes the lyric or the emotion take priority?\n\nThe emotion. Rock n\u2019 Roll is about passion!\n\nCompare this to operatic vocal style where we are looking for very beautiful and full singing with a clean tone and emphasis on a lyric.\n\nYou can see just how much your singing style is dictated by the genre.\n\nSo if you can\u2019t successfully imitate someone else\u2019s vocal style, but you know the kind of music you\u2019d like to sing and some of the standards for that genre, all you need to do is find your true voice.\n\nBut that\u2019s a lot harder than it sounds!\n\nFor one thing, we tend to imitate our favorite singers.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t help that many singers hate the sound of their own voice.\n\nBut it pays to try to find your true singing voice without all the baggage of trying to sound like someone else.\n\nSo here\u2019s one exercise to help you find your own unique voice:\n\nOne Daily Exercise to Find Your Unique Vocal Style\n\nI\u2019m going to start with one of my absolute favorite exercises to give to students.\n\n*You may want to record yourself doing this exercise for proof of your progress.\n\nPick a phrase from a song that you\u2019ve been working on. Next, say the word \u201cMum\u201d (as in British mother) out loud at a comfortable volume\u2013make sure there\u2019s no strain or breathiness in your voice. Next, sing the melody of the phrase on the word \u201cMum\u201d. So for every change in melody or syllable, sing the word Mum instead Continue singing this melody on \u201cMum\u201d a few times until you have forgotten that you\u2019re singing your favorite song and are just singing the melody on Mum Now, using the same relaxed \u201cuh\u201d feeling that you found on the \u201cMum\u201d, begin to sing the words.\n\nThe goal of this exercise is to transfer the relaxed and natural \u201cuh\u201d sound to the melody you\u2019re singing\n\nA Few Things You May Notice\n\nYou will notice that the melody sounds more relaxed and feels more natural to you.\n\nTry recording this version and seeing if you notice anything unique about your voice.\n\nThe recording should sound like you and no one else.\n\nIf at first it\u2019s not clear, repeat this process until you begin to hear your own voice, rather than that of the original singer.\n\nThe reason that this \u201cMum\u201d exercise works so well is because the \u201cUh\u201d vowel relaxes all the articulators in the resonation system (especially the tongue), forcing you to sing in your own voice.\n\nRemember, you may not like the sound of your natural voice at first.\n\nBut having taught more than 500 students, I can promise you this:\n\nThere is something unique and beautiful about every voice.\n\nYou just may not have found it yet.\n\nThis exercise is a great way to get started.\n\nBy the way, if you want a complete video singing course that walks you through lots of great exercises for improving your vocal style, check out Master Your Voice.\n\nMaster Your Voice has over 60 HD video singing lessons to help you become an amazing singer."}], "Siri\u00f0 Stenberg has been described as one of the most talented singers in the Faroe Islands.": [{"url": "https://eurovoix.com/2023/05/12/%F0%9F%87%AB%F0%9F%87%B4-faroe-islands-hopeful-of-ebu-membership-in-the-future/", "page_content": "Following the first participation of a Faroese artist in the Eurovision Song Contest, locals are hopeful that the country is one step closer to EBU membership.\n\nAfter Reiley represented Denmark at Eurovision 2023 last night, the Faroe Islands are hopeful that they are one step closer to being able to compete in the contest and be a member of the EBU.

The songbird has attracted scores of birdwatchers since the early 20th century, who compared its songs to the sounds of a woodwind instrument. Now, for the first time, researchers have found evidence that the bird sings using an harmonic series - a pattern of notes used in human music.\n\nIn the human harmonic scale, each note is based on all multiples of a base frequency. Put simply, the first note starts at a particular frequency, followed by a note that is double this frequency, and so on. This string of notes is the basis for all music, from Mozart to Taylor Swift, and apparently even the hermit thrush.\n\nTo make this discovery, researchers from the University of Vienna in Austria analysed 71 different recordings from 14 male hermit thrushes, collected from locations spanning North America. Male hermit thrushes sing six to 10 types of songs, and most are high-pitched and fast. The team isolated the frequencies corresponding to each note, and calculated the mathematical relationship between several different pitches in each recording. They performed the same analysis on the recordings played on a woodwind instrument called an alphorn, and reported that over 70 percent of the bird songs contained the same mathematical ratios as human harmony.\n\n\"The same mathematical principles that dictate the scales used in nearly all human music can also be found in the notes the hermit thrush chooses to sing,\" write the researchers in the study, which is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nJust like most songbirds, the male hermit thrush sings to mark his territory and attract mates, which the team suggests could be an evolutionary incentive for the bird to hit the right notes. While some of the hermit thrush recordings didn't follow the harmonic series, the researchers suggest that the melodious bird appears to have a preference for singing ones that do.\n\nThe findings could provide clues about the origins of music, fuelling the ongoing debate about how much of our musical heritage is influenced by biological factors versus cultural ones.\n\n\"The fact that at least one species uses the principles found in human music suggests that there may be biological reasons for the basis of music,\" Bruno Gingras, biologist and one of the authors of the study, told Dino Grandoni from The Huffington Post.\n\nWe certainly think that this little bird has potential to join the next youth choir - if you don't believe us, watch the video below:\n\n\n\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 width=\"700\u2033 height=\"394\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"true\">\n\nSource: The Huffington Post"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/sirid-stenberg/", "page_content": "Siri\u00f0 Stenberg (born 26 May 1968 in V\u00e1gur) is a Faroese politician.
