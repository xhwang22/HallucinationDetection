Now, it\u2019s his job to capitalize on this life-changing opportunity.\n\nThis Friday, 28 January, the Englishman makes his promotional debut against Brazilian hard-hitter Anderson \u201cBraddock\u201d Silva in a light heavyweight mixed martial arts clash at ONE: ONLY THE BRAVE, and he knows a victory over the kickboxing star could change his life.\n\nAhead of this colossal showdown at the Singapore Indoor Stadium, learn about the 29-year-old\u2019s fascinating journey to the global stage.\n\nKing Of Sports Day\n\nElliott was born and raised in the industrial town of Middlesbrough. The Brit lived with his parents \u2013 who were both in the army \u2013 and his older sister, and he thinks he had a pretty standard upbringing.\n\n\u201cI grew up in an average sort of area. It wasn\u2019t anything flashy. It was an average childhood, I guess,\u201d he says.\n\nThe military careers of his parents gave Elliott a stable base, though it was the family\u2019s penchant for sports that separated him from his peers.\n\n\u201cMy dad was a rugby player all his life, and he was a boxer in the army. My mum has been a keep-fit instructor all her life. My sister\u2019s a professional hockey player as well,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cIn school, at sports day, they would be like, \u2018This is obviously the Elliotts\u2019 day, so no one\u2019s going to win apart from them.\u2019\n\n\u201cSports were my thing. I had a lot of talent when it came to sports. I would play football, rugby, and [other] athletics.\u201d\n\nElliott excelled at soccer and played in the academy sides for local professional teams Hartlepool and Middlesbrough.\n\nHis parents supported him all the way, driving him around the country for practices and matches. By all accounts, it looked as if the Englishman was destined for a career on the pitch.\n\n\u201cI knew footballers were on a lot of money, and the fact I was very talented and my parents knew that it was good money too, they pushed me to do that,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThey would take me to all the games at all the different stadiums to play. I could see that sort of life would be very good.\u201d\n\nFollowing His Passion\n\nDespite the massive prospects Elliott had in soccer, something dragged him away.\n\n\u201cI stumbled across kickboxing when I was 15 and it was on Eurosport, in the big Japanese arenas, with fighters like Remi Bonjasky and Jerome Le Banner fighting in the tournaments,\u201d he recalls.\n\n\u201cI was instantly hooked. I went to my first class when I was 15. I started picking up things really quickly.\u201d\n\nElliott tried to juggle martial arts and soccer, but his motivation quickly waned for the latter.\n\nHe was on the cusp of a pro career, but he wanted to follow his passion. Even though his parents didn\u2019t quite understand his choice, they let him follow his own path.\n\n\u201cWhen I started doing kickboxing, it took over my life. I just enjoyed it that much,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI started doing judo along with it, and then just kind of slowly stopped being as interested in football. Even though I\u2019d still go to the academy practices and the games, I ended up getting released because I wasn\u2019t anywhere near as interested as I used to be.\n\n\u201cMy parents got a bit annoyed at me because it was the year where they decide if you get a scholarship. It was my decision. They could have forced me to change that and they didn\u2019t, so I was thankful for that because I don\u2019t regret anything I\u2019ve done in my life so far.\u201d\n\nA Stern Word To Relight The Fire\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a constant upward trajectory for Elliott in his new endeavor, however.\n\nHe experienced an impressive run in the amateur kickboxing ranks and then moved to mixed martial arts training when he struggled to get matched, hoping to find more opportunities in the new code.\n\nBut everything came to a complete halt when he decided to retrain for a new career in instrumentation, and it took a stern word from an old friend to bring him back to martial arts.\n\n\u201cI stepped away from the combat side of things and studied for three years. All I would do is go off to college, and then go to the gym and lift weights,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAn older gentleman called Paul that used to go to all my fights was training in the gym and there\u2019s this trolley next to him with medical supplies. We found out he had stomach cancer, unfortunately.\n\n\u201cI always talked to him, explaining to him what I study, and then he said the doctors told him that he had six weeks to live. He said to me, raising his voice as well, \u2018What on earth are you doing? Stop lifting all the weights. Go back to your fighting, something that you\u2019re good at.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe fact that he said that to me and in the situation that he was in, it meant a lot to him. It was a kick in the [butt], and the light bulb came on. I put myself back to work in the situation where I should have been all along.\n\n\u201cThat was probably November time. So I changed the whole training plan, put a new fight plan together, and then I fought that January. That was 2017 and since then, I\u2019ve not been beaten.\u201d\n\nPersevering To Reach The Top\n\nElliott has been on a tear since then. He made his amateur MMA debut in 2017, smashed through the regional circuit, and then moved swiftly into the pro ranks, where he has compiled a perfect 4-0 record with four first-round knockouts.\n\n\u201cThe King Of The North\u201d was making a name for himself domestically and preparing to go international when a series of injuries sidelined him. First, a torn meniscus, followed by a pectoral tear, and then a blown ACL.\n\nIt was a tough time, but two surgeries later and back to full fitness, he got the call from ONE that made all the adversity seem worthwhile.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest \u2013 it\u2019s not just physically challenging, it\u2019s very mentally challenging as well. It\u2019s probably taken me the longest in terms of trying to get back to full mental strength. The physical comes first, but the mental side of things takes a lot longer, surprisingly,\u201d he offers.\n\n\u201cFor a while when I first came back, I wasn\u2019t doing anywhere near as well as I should have been doing because of the ACL. Part of me was thinking, \u2018Maybe this isn\u2019t going to be the fairy-tale ending.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut as time went on, I persevered and continued. Gradually, I started to get a bit better and more confident. And now, it\u2019d be just over two years and I\u2019m at a point where I\u2019m the strongest I\u2019ve ever been, the fastest I\u2019ve ever been, and, skill-wise, I\u2019m the best I\u2019ve ever been.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re injured and you haven\u2019t fought in a while, and then ONE reaches out to you, let\u2019s just say I was extremely happy. I may have shed a tear or two. I think things happen for a reason. I\u2019m in touching distance of getting [to my ONE debut], and I feel like maybe this is all a blessing in disguise. Maybe this was meant to be.\u201d\n\nElliott is now just days away from his debut in The Home of Martial Arts, and it\u2019s all coming together. The Englishman has big aspirations for himself among the elite in the light heavyweight and heavyweight divisions, and he can\u2019t wait to showcase what he\u2019s all about in \u201cThe Lion City.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just want to try and take it all in, live in the moment and experience it firsthand,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAnd when it comes to the fight, don\u2019t give up and keep punching and kicking until he stops.\u201d\n\nRead more: \u2018Braddock\u2019 Expects Fireworks Against Fellow Slugger Paul Elliott"}, {"url": "https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/p.elliott", "page_content": "Summary\n\nProfessor Paul Elliott, CBE, FMedSci, FRCP, FPH trained in clinical medicine and epidemiology as a Wellcome Trust Clinical Fellow at St Mary's Hospital London and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.

Elliott Management, the hedge fund that Singer launched 40 years ago and still leads today, was then a large investor in Samsung\u2019s construction division. The trouble started when Jay Y. Lee, the son of the coma-bound chairman of the Samsung chaebol, started to consolidate power over Korea\u2019s biggest company. When the younger Lee moved to have one part of the family empire buy the construction unit for $8 billion, Elliott balked at what it considered an absurdly low price and began lobbying other shareholders to reject it. Investing farther away from its New York home than ever before, the hedge fund faced a canny opponent with enormous influence in its home country. Samsung went so far as to publish illustrations online depicting Singer, with a vulture beak, accompanied by rhetoric that Singer perceived as anti-Semitic.\n\nIn the end, though, it was sugar that may have swayed the voters. As the meeting to approve the deal neared, Samsung representatives went door to door to meet shareholders, bearing watermelons and Korean walnut cakes, in a plea for their votes. The merger passed. Elliott, in a rare surrender, sold its shares a few weeks later.\n\nBut the story doesn\u2019t end there. As South Korean authorities unraveled a corruption scandal that toppled the country\u2019s President earlier this year, the trail traced back to Samsung. In August, Lee was convicted of bribery. Prosecutors said Samsung executives had provided a range of financial favors to a key political influencer\u2014among them, a gift of a $830,000 dressage horse to the influencer\u2019s daughter\u2014in order to ensure that the merger was approved and Elliott was defeated. Lee is appealing the conviction, but for now, the Samsung heir is in jail, and Elliott has been vindicated. \u201cI had no idea when we were in the midst of this, that this situation was going to lead to the impeachment of the President,\u201d says Jonathan Pollock, co-CEO of Elliott, alongside Singer. It happens that in pursuing misbehaving companies, Elliott sometimes ends up sniffing out nefarious behavior: \u201cUnfortunately, some of the people involved in these situations tend to ignore the rights of shareholders and creditors, and act entitled to do whatever they want.\u201d\n\nThe Samsung outcome turned out to be a watershed moment not just for Elliott, but for shareholder activism. Activists use their ownership stakes in public companies to pressure them to change in order to boost returns\u2014whether by restructuring their businesses, shaking up management, or even putting themselves up for sale. Such shareholder agitation has become more common in recent years as a widening pool of global investors seek a competitive edge. And in that world, the 40-year-old Elliott has emerged as both the largest and most active of activist hedge funds, and one that almost always seems to get its way.\n\n\u201cThe Elliott book of deals is probably the most instructive, and it\u2019s also one of the most far, far reaching,\u201d says Marty Lipton, founding partner of the law firm Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz and inventor of the poison-pill corporate defense strategy, who has lately faced Elliott more frequently and on more fronts than ever before. \u201cThey\u2019ve been enormously successful, and they are a major factor in activism today.\u201d\n\nIn the past five years, Elliott has launched activist campaigns at more than 50 companies\u201419 this year alone\u2014in at least a dozen countries. During that span, the battle with Samsung is the only one that went all the way to a vote, and the only one in which the firm didn\u2019t get what it wanted\u2014a sign of just how effective Elliott is at pressuring management to agree to its demands. At the same time, Elliott\u2019s assets have nearly doubled to roughly $39 billion, including $5 billion it raised in a 23-hour span in May, making it more than twice the size of the second-biggest activist hedge fund, Dan Loeb\u2019s Third Point.\n\nNic Rapp\n\nThat war chest, along with Elliott\u2019s 400-\u00adperson staff, has rendered the firm virtually impossible for adversaries\u2014from industry titans to nation states\u2014to beat in a fight. Warren Buffett learned that the hard way this summer, when Elliott used its financial might to successfully block Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s bid for energy company Oncor, by buying up company debt and pledging to exercise its creditor veto right. And Elliott has lately sought to clone its winning strategy: It\u2019s on track to launch about 50% more activist campaigns this year than in 2016\u2014nearly three times as many as any other major activist fund\u2014including, in October, two in a single day.\n\nElliott\u2019s winning ways are in stark contrast to many of its activist peers, whose recent attempts to take on Fortune 500 companies have failed miserably, from Bill Ackman\u2019s landslide loss in a proxy contest with ADP (ADP), to Greenlight Capital founder David Einhorn\u2019s strikeout at General Motors (GM) earlier this year. Even Trian Partners\u2019 Nelson Peltz, who narrowly won a blockbuster proxy campaign with P&G (PG) this fall, is still feuding with that company to accept him onto its board. And Elliott, whose 13.4% annual rate of return over its four-decade history is unmatched among hedge funds, has also outperformed at a time when that asset class has woefully lagged the market. The firm\u2019s flagship fund, Elliott Associates, has returned more than 9.7% annualized over the past five years, compared with just 4.7% for hedge funds overall.\n\nAs Elliott ramps up its activism to an unprecedented scale, it is also accumulating a growing body count of deposed executives\u2014not to mention ousted heads of state\u2014who dared fight it. Just last year, Elliott finally prevailed in a 15-year battle to force Argentina to repay its bonds\u2014a saga in which the hedge fund at one point seized an Argentine navy tall ship with the sailors still on it. A few months after Elliott finally collected its $2.4 billion windfall, Argentina indicted its former President, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, who had led her country into default in 2014 rather than pay Elliott what it owed (a decision that had also cost her party reelection). \u201cElliott\u2019s the only one that has effected regime change in two different sovereign countries,\u201d says Chris Cernich, managing director of Strategic Governance Advisors, who counsels executives on proxy contests. \u201cThey were successful at being right, and very publicly right.\u201d\n\nIn their conviction that they\u2019re right, however, Elliott has become adept at wielding pressure on its opponents in ways their foes say can cross ethical boundaries. Through interviews with more than 40 people who have dealt with the hedge fund\u2014including bankers, advisers, board members of various companies, and current and former employees of the firm\u2014Fortune has learned previously unreported details that reveal just how far Elliott will go to win.\n\nTo many observers, Elliott appeared vindicated yet again this spring, when a soccer ball showed up at Paul Singer\u2019s door. In January, the hedge fund had publicly called for the ouster of Klaus Kleinfeld, the CEO of aerospace manufacturer Arconic (ARNC), which split from Alcoa last year. Elliott objected to the company\u2019s poor stock returns during his tenure, along with his generous compensation. Arconic refused to fire the CEO, and the stage was set for a proxy fight.\n\nFour months later, Kleinfeld responded in the form of that soccer ball, sent by courier directly to Singer\u2019s office, across town from Arconic\u2019s New York headquarters. He enclosed a letter on his personal stationery, in which he sardonically alluded to some \u201clastingly legendary\u201d partying Singer had supposedly done while attending the 2006 World Cup in Berlin. In a postscript, Kleinfeld insinuated that the hedge fund manager\u2019s alleged debauchery had included wearing Native American headgear and warbling \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain\u201d in a public fountain. He pledged to send Singer a feathered headdress next.\n\nBy Elliott\u2019s telling, it was the corporate equivalent of a bloody finger in a box. \u201cWe do understand Dr. Kleinfeld to be making veiled suggestions that he might intimidate or extort Mr. Singer,\u201d Elliott\u2019s general counsel, Richard Zabel, wrote to Arconic\u2019s board. Less than a week later, Arconic\u2019s board gave Kleinfeld no choice but to resign. Elliott, it seemed, had lucked into its desired outcome out of the blue, by way of its opponent\u2019s unforced error.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, the hedge fund had been waging a sort of Cold War with Kleinfeld and Arconic, engaging in covert espionage ranging across the Eastern seaboard and all the way to Europe, Fortune has learned.\n\nFor Kleinfeld, it started when a pair of people who identified themselves as private investigators showed up at the door of his next-door neighbor in New York\u2019s Westchester County about a year ago, inquiring about \u201cloud parties\u201d at his house. As Elliott ramped up its pressure on Arconic, friends and colleagues of Kleinfeld, along with board members of Arconic, reported more suspicious run-ins: Others who live near the CEO were followed to a local restaurant by strangers who then approached the couple; they claimed to be considering investing with Kleinfeld, but first had a few questions. The German-born executive declined to speak with Fortune, but five people familiar with the events confirmed this account. They all believed Elliott to be behind it: \u201cWe thought they crossed the line,\u201d one of the people says.\n\nThe most unnerving incident was when one of Kleinfeld\u2019s daughters, a student at Harvard Business School, was approached on campus by someone who asked to \u201cfriend\u201d her on Facebook; the person also spoke to her friends, fishing for information about her family. While lawyers and advisers say it\u2019s common to hire investigators to do opposition research in the context of a proxy campaign, executives\u2019 kids\u2014of any age\u2014are typically considered off-limits.\n\nElliott does not seem to share those qualms: On at least three occasions, according to both court testimony and the accounts of seven people who spoke with Fortune, children of people facing the hedge fund\u2019s attack have been pulled into the fray in some way, in an apparent bid to gain either information on or leverage against their parents. In an instance involving Norbert Essing, an Arconic PR consultant in Germany, neighbors of his children in London received visits from people asking about drug abuse by them or their father. This happened shortly after Elliott publicly blamed Essing for helping or encouraging Kleinfeld to write his soccer ball letter. (Essing denies the accusation.)\n\nElliott declined to comment on the use of private investigators in its activist campaigns. A person close to the firm denied that information from or about anyone\u2019s kids was part of the scope of its Arconic research effort. Fortune reached out to Elliott to discuss those allegations and ask for its perspective on at least seven occasions, but the firm repeatedly declined to comment on the record.\n\nAfter the story was published, the firm responded with a letter\u2014an excerpt of which follows. (For Elliott\u2019s full letter, see \u201cElliott Management\u2019s Response to Fortune.\u201d)\n\n\u201cIn the Fortune article titled \u2018Inside Elliott Management: How Paul Singer\u2019s Hedge Fund Always Wins,\u2019 Fortune relayed several instances in which unnamed people allege that the adult children of various executives were contacted by individuals that they assumed to be working for Elliott Management. This assumption and the implicit allegations that Elliott sent anyone to contact the children of these executives are completely false. \u201cElliott has always behaved ethically in its disputes with corporate managements and boards, and it is regrettable and disappointing that certain parties adverse to us would choose to promote false allegations about us rather than engage on the merits of our arguments in good faith.\u201d\n\nBut in the insular world of activist hedge funds, Elliott appears to have a reputation for particularly hardball tactics, several sources say. Distaste for this no-holds-barred approach even led one prominent activist, Jeff Ubben, the CEO of hedge fund ValueAct, to stick up for Kleinfeld during a panel discussion on activism at the Milken Institute conference in May.\n\nStill, dirt-digging and other aggressive tactics, while controversial, have the benefit of exerting power beyond what money can buy. And they shed light on just what distinguishes Elliott from its less successful peers. \u201cTo do activism really, really well, you have to be not only smart and persistent, but you have to be willing,\u201d says David Rosewater, who advises companies as the global head of Morgan Stanley\u2019s shareholder activism and corporate defense group, and who has previously represented Elliott as an attorney. \u201cNot everybody is willing to be the bad guy.\u201d\n\nElliott Management was founded in 1977 by Paul Elliott Singer, a lawyer by training who found he could use the court system to great gain as an investor in bankruptcy situations and arbitrage. Conservative in almost every sense of the word, the billionaire Singer, now 73, insists on hedging all his investments to reduce the risk of loss, and prizes \u201cmanual efforts\u201d\u2014in other words, old-fashioned elbow grease\u2014as the defining characteristic of his investment style.\n\nA powerful GOP donor who split with his party by funding the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement\u2014and by supporting same-sex marriage\u2014Singer is also obsessed about his own and his employees\u2019 physical safety, according to those who know him well. Elliott largely bans staff from social media; with few exceptions, employees cannot post pictures of themselves online\u2014not even an official headshot\u2014making them virtual ghosts in the digital age. The precaution is meant to protect them from anyone who might hold a grudge against the firm. \u201cPaul has always been paranoid about security,\u201d says one Elliott investor, who asked not to be identified for fear of offending Singer. In an extreme extension of that philosophy, Singer has even hedged his Manhattan headquarters, maintaining a backup version of the five-floor offices in New Jersey, just in case.\n\nIn the 1980s and \u201990s, Elliott applied its acumen primarily to distressed debt and other more esoteric securities where relatively few Wall Street investors ventured. But the modern history of Elliott\u2019s activism begins in 2004 with the arrival of Jesse Cohn. Now 37, Cohn is Elliott\u2019s enfant terrible; a car fanatic and triathlete from Long Island who can talk so quickly it sometimes seems like he\u2019s on fast-forward. A self-described computer-camp geek, Cohn spent two years as an M&A banker at Morgan Stanley before joining Elliott. That\u2019s where he started writing letters to small tech companies, urging them to put themselves up for auction to garner big gains for their shareholders.\n\nCohn\u2019s fanboy-meets-dealmaker affect earned him a reputation as a bit of a whippersnapper. In 2010, in a letter to the board of Novell, he boasted of earning one of the company\u2019s IT certifications when he was 14\u2014a charming bit of common ground that shared the pages with a hostile bid to buy the firm. The brash move worked\u2014Novell was sold to private equity\u2014and Cohn\u2019s formula impressed his bosses enough that they promoted him to head all of its U.S. equity activism. Cohn\u2019s campaigns have resulted in the takeouts or buyouts of more than a dozen companies, including BMC Software, Informatica, LifeLock and, biggest of all, EMC, which Dell acquired for $67 billion in 2015. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone has any more experience than he does prosecuting activist campaigns,\u201d says Chris Young, head of contested situations at Credit Suisse, who has known Cohn since the latter started at Elliott.\n\nWhile Singer eschews sitting on corporate boards, Cohn sits on four, and has become so integral to the firm that some of Elliott\u2019s investors mistakenly believe Cohn is Singer\u2019s nephew. While Singer seldom appears in public (he declined to be interviewed for this article) and rarely takes part in negotiations with companies the firm targets, Cohn is often on the front lines. \u201cPaul is the final decision maker on lots of these issues, but Jesse is the guy, and everyone in the activist community knows who he is,\u201d says Marc Weingarten, a partner and cochair of the shareholder activism group at law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel who has represented Elliott.\n\nIn private, people sitting across the table from Cohn have seen another side of him, that of a maestro in the art of applying strategic pressure. That aspect of him bubbled into public view with Compuware, the Detroit-based business software maker that eventually sold to private equity firm Thoma Bravo for $2.4 billion in 2014 as a result of Elliott\u2019s campaign.\n\nIn September 2013, a delegation from the Compuware board flew to New York to meet with Elliott about its demands for the company. Cohn opened the meeting by casually flipping through a six-inch-thick manila folder of purportedly embarrassing information on his guests, which included former GM CEO Fritz Henderson. Bill Grabe, an advisory director at private equity firm General Atlantic who sat on Compuware\u2019s board at the time, would later testify in arbitration proceedings that Cohn unabashedly brought Henderson\u2019s daughter into the conversation. \u201cAnd you know, you have a daughter that\u2019s doing this and whatnot,\u201d Grabe recalled Cohn saying, paraphrasing the young fund manager. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with somebody whose tactics it is to intimidate, to splinter, to do everything they can to be disruptive,\u201d Grabe testified. In the same case, then\u2013Compuware CEO Bob Paul testified that in a follow-up phone call, Cohn dropped a \u201cveiled threat\u201d that he knew Paul kept an Aston Martin in his garage, saying, \u201cBy the way, love that English car you\u2019re driving.\u201d\n\nThese encounters, first disclosed during a wrongful termination dispute with Compuware cofounder Peter Karmanos Jr., have provided ammunition for Karmanos\u2019s current suit in Michigan state court, accusing Elliott of \u201cblackmailing\u201d the directors into selling the company. \u201cElliott is taking advantage of the situation,\u201d Karmanos tells Fortune, \u201cand then when they wanted to push it a little harder, they bend the rules.\u201d Karmanos started Compuware in 1973 with a few hundred dollars in tax refund checks. He had already announced his retirement from the board when Elliott launched its campaign, but was fired as a consultant a few months later for saying publicly that he \u201cwould tell the hedge fund to go fuck themselves\u201d\u2014comments he says he does not regret. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to watch it just get torn apart by those jerks in New York,\u201d he says.\n\nA person who was in the room when Cohn brought out the dossiers says the ploy had no influence on the board\u2019s decisions, though it was unmistakably a threat to release damaging information. \u201cThere was no question as to what the intent was of that folder,\u201d the person says. The directors had come to the meeting prepared, after their counterparts at rival BMC, which Elliott had come after a year earlier, warned them of similar tactics. That effort included a disturbing phone call to a BMC director\u2019s daughter, the Compuware directors say.\n\nElliott declined to comment. But a person close to the firm says the shtick was designed \u201cto be sort of funny, but sort of brutal,\u201d a kind of shame game cataloging the board\u2019s conflicts of interest, and conveying that the jig was up. The intel itself implicated the director, not his daughter, even if she was the source of it, the person adds: \u201cWe draw the line there. His daughter doesn\u2019t sit on the board.\u201d\n\nStill, such maneuvers are concerning to investors like ValueAct\u2019s Ubben, who worry that Elliott may undermine the ability of other activists to work with companies in good faith, whether by its indifference to the human toll of its campaigns or because of its apparent affinity for knocking companies out of existence. \u201cOur form of activism could not be more different than Elliott,\u201d Ubben tells Fortune. Ubben\u2019s hedge fund\u2019s behind-closed-doors campaign at Microsoft (MSFT), now going on five years, is credited with expediting the tech giant\u2019s turnaround under CEO Satya Nadella. \u201cElliott is single-handedly making the public markets less attractive to companies,\u201d Ubben says, \u201cand we see it in the shrinking number of public companies and the growth in private ownership.\u201d\n\nWhile Cohn was in the trenches with Compuware, a sea change was taking hold inside Elliott. Elliott\u2019s top brass saw Cohn\u2019s strategy as an obvious extension of the firm\u2019s bread-and-butter, labor-intensive investing, and five years ago they kicked it into high gear. Elliott had a generation of young managers eager to do what Cohn had done in their respective industries, from energy to metals and mining. Jonathan Pollock, who had practiced closed-end fund arbitrage in Europe and Asia, had returned to New York a few years earlier, and now fused the principles upon which Singer had built the firm into an equity strategy that could travel across Elliott and the globe.\n\nThe first big test was Hess. With a market cap of about $25 billion at the time, the family-run oil and gas empire was the largest company Elliott had ever gone after, and it occupied a nostalgic place in American culture thanks to the novelty toy trucks it released each year at Christmastime. Hess never saw Elliott coming. Elliott owned only 4% of Hess\u2019s stock\u2014not enough to necessitate an activist warning-shot 13D filing with the SEC\u2014in January 2013 when the fund went public with a proxy campaign to replace five of the board\u2019s directors. Elliott alleged that Hess was paying execs some of the highest compensation packages in the industry, while stock returns were near the bottom. It was \u201ca sneak attack,\u201d recalls Thomas Kean, the former Republican governor of New Jersey and one of the Hess directors in Elliott\u2019s crosshairs.\n\nHess had an aura of impenetrability as one of America\u2019s last dynastic corporations. But the hedge fund nominated an unimpeachable lineup of new directors (including former CEOs of BP and American Express), none of whom worked for Elliott, forcing shareholders to evaluate its arguments on merit. The Hess board \u201clooked like the junior varsity B team when you compared them to the Elliott slate,\u201d Cernich says. Elliott, Kean claims, told some institutional shareholders that failing to support its candidates would be tantamount to neglecting their fiduciary duty\u2014an allegation with potential legal consequences.\n\n\u201cElliott is single-handedly making the public markets less attractive to companies.\u201d\n\nJeff Ubben, activist investor and CEO of hedge fund ValueAct\n\nOn the eve of the proxy vote at the May 2013 annual meeting, representatives of Elliott and Hess holed up counting incoming votes in the Four Seasons hotel in Houston. It was only around 10 p.m., when the outcome was still too close to call, that the two sides came together, working through the night on a settlement: At 6:30 a.m., Hess announced that it would add three of Elliott\u2019s nominees to its board. Kean, after 23 years of service, relinquished his seat. \u201cBy taking that on, they showed that they could move up the weight class to take on bigger companies, and that\u2019s that,\u201d Kean says. The Hess family\u2019s defeat also reverberated beyond Elliott, says a banker who advises companies on facing activists: \u201cOnce that broke, I think everybody was like, party on.\u201d\n\nInside Elliott, the mounting victories catalyzed the activist impulse. In October 2015, the hedge fund took on its first retail company with Cabela\u2019s, which eventually sold itself to Bass Pro Shops. For Cohn, the moment of enlightenment came with American Capital. Elliott had originally invested in the obscure financial stock as part of an arbitrage trade, but when a colleague saw that the company was laying groundwork to shield itself from activist investors, he went across the hall to Cohn for the first time.\n\nRunning the company through Elliott\u2019s activism checklist\u2014Is the company undervalued? Can it be fixed? Can you convince other shareholders of the need for change?\u2014Cohn brought the idea of a campaign to Pollock and Singer, who immediately signed off. In mid-November 2015, Elliott sent a public letter to American Capital while simultaneously revealing an 8.4% stake; the company caved just nine days later, announcing it was beginning a sale process. It was the quickest turnaround of any of Elliott\u2019s public campaigns. (Ares Capital acquired the firm six months later for $3.4 billion.) \u201cIt showed that the process really works,\u201d says Cohn. \u201cAnd it\u2019s scalable. That\u2019s part of what I think we\u2019ve proven\u2014we\u2019re not just a group of tech people doing just tech trades; we\u2019re a team that\u2019s able to take what we\u2019ve built and do it over a long period of time, and roll it out to other industries and geographies, too.\u201d\n\nStill, Cohn wasn\u2019t quite satisfied with the machine he\u2019d helped build. From his earliest days at Elliott, he\u2019d harbored a dream that he\u2019d frequently express over dinners with colleagues and advisers. For as many times as he\u2019d pushed companies onto the block, as many sales as he\u2019d secured, there was something missing: Jesse Cohn wanted to buy companies himself.\n\nTo hear Cohn tell it, he\u2019d fallen in love. The time and effort Elliott put in to researching companies before launching campaigns often imbued the activists with an intimate knowledge of, and deep appreciation for, their targets. With EMC, for example, Elliott had spent months getting to know the data storage company, interviewing some 700 of its customers before launching a campaign urging it to pursue M&A opportunities. But when computing giant Dell, with financing from its private equity owner Silver Lake, bought EMC, Elliott was shut out of the deal. One day, Cohn hoped, Elliott would be big enough to afford whales of its own.\n\nCohn\u2019s dream finally came true this fall, when Elliott acquired cybersecurity firm Gigamon for $1.6 billion, less than six months after unveiling a position in the stock. It was the first time Elliott had taken an entire public company private by itself, a major milestone for its relatively new Silicon Valley\u2013based private equity arm, Evergreen Coast Capital.\n\nBut in a bit of high-finance irony, Elliott\u2019s reputation for sharp elbows, Cohn realized, could be a liability in achieving these new goals. Cohn is now often sourcing leads for deals from the very bankers and lawyers who sat across from him during tough negotiations in the past. And with that adjustment, people who\u2019ve worked with him say, has come a newfound sensitivity to how both he and Elliott are perceived.\n\nAt Athenahealth, for example, which Elliott targeted this spring, Cohn has been polite and even complimentary in his interactions with management, despite being a \u201cregular drumbeat\u201d of a presence, according to people close to the health IT company. On occasion, Cohn has been known to let a tinge of guilt creep in when he reflects on his more swashbuckling days. \u201cOur tactics probably evolved over time,\u201d says Pollock, who is Cohn\u2019s boss. \u201cWe\u2019re looking more toward this constructive engagement approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur tactics probably evolved over time. We\u2019re looking more toward this constructive engagement approach.\u201d\n\nJonathan Pollock, co-CEO, Elliott Management\n\nThat\u2019s why Elliott\u2019s attack on Arconic this year ruffled feathers inside and outside the firm. Led by 38-year-old portfolio manager Dave Miller, the campaign rhetoric packed more vitriol than any of Elliott\u2019s campaigns in recent memory. Elliott\u2019s 336-slide deck, distributed to Arconic shareholders and released publicly, depicted Kleinfeld as the Monopoly man, running away with money bags. It also alluded to Kleinfeld having personality abnormalities (a claim Arconic dismissed as an \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d ad hominem attack), prompting some to observe that Elliott could have a split personality of its own. \u201cThe problem is, I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m going to get the mensch or the schmuck,\u201d Joele Frank, of the eponymous public relations firm that has helped companies fight Elliott and other activists, commented at a panel at a Tulane law school event in March. (Miller, for his part, was promoted to head of U.S. restructuring at Elliott this spring.)\n\nThe Arconic campaign also illustrated Elliott\u2019s power to deploy a seemingly bottomless amount of resources. In May, nearly a month after Kleinfeld resigned, Elliott did something no one has done before or since. Along with paper proxy-vote cards, the hedge fund mailed rechargeable video players, slightly smaller than an iPad, loaded with a four-minute attack ad\u2014alleging Kleinfeld \u201chas the worst track record of any CEO in the S&P 500 over his tenure\u201d\u2014that played automatically when investors opened the package. Sent to tens of thousands of large retail shareholders, the gimmick alone cost Elliott as much as $3 million, proxy contest advisers estimate. While Arconic disclosed it spent $58 million defending itself, it\u2019s likely the hedge fund spent nearly as much if not more in the attack, according to people who worked on the campaign. After two failed rounds of settlement talks in which Singer made a rare personal appearance, Arconic ultimately agreed to add three of Elliott\u2019s four picks to its board. \u201cWhen Elliott shows up, it\u2019s a completely different ball game,\u201d says Weingarten, the Schulte lawyer. \u201cThey are relentless. They have the money, and they will spare no expense to ensure that they win.\u201d\n\nJoshua Bright\u2014The New York Times/Redux\n\nFrom Elliott\u2019s perspective, the approach was warranted, given the resistance they\u2019d encountered. Pollock notes that Arconic was one of just a handful of its campaigns, along with Hess and Samsung, where a true battle ensued. \u201cI don\u2019t count the three or four as a success, necessarily,\u201d he says. (Adds someone close to Arconic, \u201cWe didn\u2019t decide to take them on, we just said we disagree.\u201d)\n\nBankers say the Arconic presentation has made the rounds in other companies\u2019 board rooms, and looms large over Elliott\u2019s subsequent campaigns, a warning of what can happen to those who resist its overtures. Whether it fits the firm\u2019s ideals or not, Elliott\u2019s ruthless legacy continues to color its endeavors. Unlike the activist firms run by Bill Ackman or Dan Loeb, the fund Paul Singer founded has raised an army of activists who can influence corporate fiefdoms everywhere. \u201cThere\u2019s some sense that there\u2019s an institution that survives the founder,\u201d says Cernich, the governance adviser, \u201cand that it expands and multiplies the power and effectiveness of the organization.\u201d\n\nPromises Pollock, \u201cWe\u2019ll be around for a while.\u201d Boards, beware.\n\nUpdates: This article was updated on Dec. 13 to include a response that Elliott Management submitted after the article was published.

The cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, a valuation metric based on the last 10 years of average earnings and calibrated for inflation, is at the highest level since the early 2000s.\n\n\n\nIn the letter, Elliott also raises the risks that this run-up in shares poses.\n\n\"It is too early to determine, at what may be the dawn of a new era, whether stock prices are too far 'over their skis' or are actually on the verge of reflecting the opportunities posed by the low baseline for potentially much higher growth created by the reversal of eight years of growth-repressive and distorted fiscal and monetary policies.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, it is premature to conclude whether bond markets have been overly pessimistic these last few weeks or if the recent declines in prices are only the beginning of a sustained rise in interest rates. After all, even at current levels of bond prices, which are down several percent from their highs just a few months ago, bond prices do not provide a reasonable return after accounting for current inflation, much less the rate of inflation which could be expected if economic growth picked up meaningfully.\"\n\nElliott's flagship fund returned 4.4% for the fourth quarter and 13.1% last year, according to the letter."}, {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/elliotts-paul-singer-lays-out-why-the-us-needs-tax-reform-2017-11", "page_content": "Billionaire hedge-fund manager and GOP donor Paul Singer sent a letter to clients stressing the need for economic growth.

Singer has helped cement New York City\u2019s reputation as a global financial capital as the founder of Elliott Management, a hedge fund with $41 billion in assets whose offices overlook Central Park.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Mr. Singer, a billionaire who is one of the wealthiest people in the United States, revealed that he was moving his firm\u2019s headquarters from Midtown Manhattan to West Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nThe decision to leave New York was prompted by the pandemic and the uncertainty over the future of Manhattan offices, a person familiar with the move said.\n\nMr. Singer himself, however, will remain in the Northeast, and Elliott will keep offices and some employees in New York, said the person, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the firm\u2019s plans."}, {"url": "https://fortune.com/2017/12/07/elliott-management-hedge-fund-paul-singer/", "page_content": "If not for the watermelons, Elliott might have won in Korea.\n\nIn the summer of 2015, the activist hedge fund founded by Paul Singer had gone to war in the Republic of Samsung to stop the South Korean conglomerate from going through with what Singer considered to be an unfair deal. Elliott Management, the hedge fund that Singer launched 40 years ago and still leads today, was then a large investor in Samsung\u2019s construction division. The trouble started when Jay Y. Lee, the son of the coma-bound chairman of the Samsung chaebol, started to consolidate power over Korea\u2019s biggest company. When the younger Lee moved to have one part of the family empire buy the construction unit for $8 billion, Elliott balked at what it considered an absurdly low price and began lobbying other shareholders to reject it. Investing farther away from its New York home than ever before, the hedge fund faced a canny opponent with enormous influence in its home country. Samsung went so far as to publish illustrations online depicting Singer, with a vulture beak, accompanied by rhetoric that Singer perceived as anti-Semitic.\n\nIn the end, though, it was sugar that may have swayed the voters. As the meeting to approve the deal neared, Samsung representatives went door to door to meet shareholders, bearing watermelons and Korean walnut cakes, in a plea for their votes. The merger passed. Elliott, in a rare surrender, sold its shares a few weeks later.\n\nBut the story doesn\u2019t end there. As South Korean authorities unraveled a corruption scandal that toppled the country\u2019s President earlier this year, the trail traced back to Samsung. In August, Lee was convicted of bribery. Prosecutors said Samsung executives had provided a range of financial favors to a key political influencer\u2014among them, a gift of a $830,000 dressage horse to the influencer\u2019s daughter\u2014in order to ensure that the merger was approved and Elliott was defeated. Lee is appealing the conviction, but for now, the Samsung heir is in jail, and Elliott has been vindicated. \u201cI had no idea when we were in the midst of this, that this situation was going to lead to the impeachment of the President,\u201d says Jonathan Pollock, co-CEO of Elliott, alongside Singer. It happens that in pursuing misbehaving companies, Elliott sometimes ends up sniffing out nefarious behavior: \u201cUnfortunately, some of the people involved in these situations tend to ignore the rights of shareholders and creditors, and act entitled to do whatever they want.\u201d\n\nThe Samsung outcome turned out to be a watershed moment not just for Elliott, but for shareholder activism. Activists use their ownership stakes in public companies to pressure them to change in order to boost returns\u2014whether by restructuring their businesses, shaking up management, or even putting themselves up for sale. Such shareholder agitation has become more common in recent years as a widening pool of global investors seek a competitive edge. And in that world, the 40-year-old Elliott has emerged as both the largest and most active of activist hedge funds, and one that almost always seems to get its way.\n\n\u201cThe Elliott book of deals is probably the most instructive, and it\u2019s also one of the most far, far reaching,\u201d says Marty Lipton, founding partner of the law firm Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz and inventor of the poison-pill corporate defense strategy, who has lately faced Elliott more frequently and on more fronts than ever before. \u201cThey\u2019ve been enormously successful, and they are a major factor in activism today.\u201d\n\nIn the past five years, Elliott has launched activist campaigns at more than 50 companies\u201419 this year alone\u2014in at least a dozen countries. During that span, the battle with Samsung is the only one that went all the way to a vote, and the only one in which the firm didn\u2019t get what it wanted\u2014a sign of just how effective Elliott is at pressuring management to agree to its demands. At the same time, Elliott\u2019s assets have nearly doubled to roughly $39 billion, including $5 billion it raised in a 23-hour span in May, making it more than twice the size of the second-biggest activist hedge fund, Dan Loeb\u2019s Third Point.\n\nNic Rapp\n\nThat war chest, along with Elliott\u2019s 400-\u00adperson staff, has rendered the firm virtually impossible for adversaries\u2014from industry titans to nation states\u2014to beat in a fight. Warren Buffett learned that the hard way this summer, when Elliott used its financial might to successfully block Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s bid for energy company Oncor, by buying up company debt and pledging to exercise its creditor veto right. And Elliott has lately sought to clone its winning strategy: It\u2019s on track to launch about 50% more activist campaigns this year than in 2016\u2014nearly three times as many as any other major activist fund\u2014including, in October, two in a single day.\n\nElliott\u2019s winning ways are in stark contrast to many of its activist peers, whose recent attempts to take on Fortune 500 companies have failed miserably, from Bill Ackman\u2019s landslide loss in a proxy contest with ADP (ADP), to Greenlight Capital founder David Einhorn\u2019s strikeout at General Motors (GM) earlier this year. Even Trian Partners\u2019 Nelson Peltz, who narrowly won a blockbuster proxy campaign with P&G (PG) this fall, is still feuding with that company to accept him onto its board. And Elliott, whose 13.4% annual rate of return over its four-decade history is unmatched among hedge funds, has also outperformed at a time when that asset class has woefully lagged the market. The firm\u2019s flagship fund, Elliott Associates, has returned more than 9.7% annualized over the past five years, compared with just 4.7% for hedge funds overall.\n\nAs Elliott ramps up its activism to an unprecedented scale, it is also accumulating a growing body count of deposed executives\u2014not to mention ousted heads of state\u2014who dared fight it. Just last year, Elliott finally prevailed in a 15-year battle to force Argentina to repay its bonds\u2014a saga in which the hedge fund at one point seized an Argentine navy tall ship with the sailors still on it. A few months after Elliott finally collected its $2.4 billion windfall, Argentina indicted its former President, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, who had led her country into default in 2014 rather than pay Elliott what it owed (a decision that had also cost her party reelection). \u201cElliott\u2019s the only one that has effected regime change in two different sovereign countries,\u201d says Chris Cernich, managing director of Strategic Governance Advisors, who counsels executives on proxy contests. \u201cThey were successful at being right, and very publicly right.\u201d\n\nIn their conviction that they\u2019re right, however, Elliott has become adept at wielding pressure on its opponents in ways their foes say can cross ethical boundaries. Through interviews with more than 40 people who have dealt with the hedge fund\u2014including bankers, advisers, board members of various companies, and current and former employees of the firm\u2014Fortune has learned previously unreported details that reveal just how far Elliott will go to win.\n\nTo many observers, Elliott appeared vindicated yet again this spring, when a soccer ball showed up at Paul Singer\u2019s door. In January, the hedge fund had publicly called for the ouster of Klaus Kleinfeld, the CEO of aerospace manufacturer Arconic (ARNC), which split from Alcoa last year. Elliott objected to the company\u2019s poor stock returns during his tenure, along with his generous compensation. Arconic refused to fire the CEO, and the stage was set for a proxy fight.\n\nFour months later, Kleinfeld responded in the form of that soccer ball, sent by courier directly to Singer\u2019s office, across town from Arconic\u2019s New York headquarters. He enclosed a letter on his personal stationery, in which he sardonically alluded to some \u201clastingly legendary\u201d partying Singer had supposedly done while attending the 2006 World Cup in Berlin. In a postscript, Kleinfeld insinuated that the hedge fund manager\u2019s alleged debauchery had included wearing Native American headgear and warbling \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain\u201d in a public fountain. He pledged to send Singer a feathered headdress next.\n\nBy Elliott\u2019s telling, it was the corporate equivalent of a bloody finger in a box. \u201cWe do understand Dr. Kleinfeld to be making veiled suggestions that he might intimidate or extort Mr. Singer,\u201d Elliott\u2019s general counsel, Richard Zabel, wrote to Arconic\u2019s board. Less than a week later, Arconic\u2019s board gave Kleinfeld no choice but to resign. Elliott, it seemed, had lucked into its desired outcome out of the blue, by way of its opponent\u2019s unforced error.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, the hedge fund had been waging a sort of Cold War with Kleinfeld and Arconic, engaging in covert espionage ranging across the Eastern seaboard and all the way to Europe, Fortune has learned.\n\nFor Kleinfeld, it started when a pair of people who identified themselves as private investigators showed up at the door of his next-door neighbor in New York\u2019s Westchester County about a year ago, inquiring about \u201cloud parties\u201d at his house. As Elliott ramped up its pressure on Arconic, friends and colleagues of Kleinfeld, along with board members of Arconic, reported more suspicious run-ins: Others who live near the CEO were followed to a local restaurant by strangers who then approached the couple; they claimed to be considering investing with Kleinfeld, but first had a few questions. The German-born executive declined to speak with Fortune, but five people familiar with the events confirmed this account. They all believed Elliott to be behind it: \u201cWe thought they crossed the line,\u201d one of the people says.\n\nThe most unnerving incident was when one of Kleinfeld\u2019s daughters, a student at Harvard Business School, was approached on campus by someone who asked to \u201cfriend\u201d her on Facebook; the person also spoke to her friends, fishing for information about her family. While lawyers and advisers say it\u2019s common to hire investigators to do opposition research in the context of a proxy campaign, executives\u2019 kids\u2014of any age\u2014are typically considered off-limits.\n\nElliott does not seem to share those qualms: On at least three occasions, according to both court testimony and the accounts of seven people who spoke with Fortune, children of people facing the hedge fund\u2019s attack have been pulled into the fray in some way, in an apparent bid to gain either information on or leverage against their parents. In an instance involving Norbert Essing, an Arconic PR consultant in Germany, neighbors of his children in London received visits from people asking about drug abuse by them or their father. This happened shortly after Elliott publicly blamed Essing for helping or encouraging Kleinfeld to write his soccer ball letter. (Essing denies the accusation.)\n\nElliott declined to comment on the use of private investigators in its activist campaigns. A person close to the firm denied that information from or about anyone\u2019s kids was part of the scope of its Arconic research effort. Fortune reached out to Elliott to discuss those allegations and ask for its perspective on at least seven occasions, but the firm repeatedly declined to comment on the record.\n\nAfter the story was published, the firm responded with a letter\u2014an excerpt of which follows. (For Elliott\u2019s full letter, see \u201cElliott Management\u2019s Response to Fortune.\u201d)\n\n\u201cIn the Fortune article titled \u2018Inside Elliott Management: How Paul Singer\u2019s Hedge Fund Always Wins,\u2019 Fortune relayed several instances in which unnamed people allege that the adult children of various executives were contacted by individuals that they assumed to be working for Elliott Management. This assumption and the implicit allegations that Elliott sent anyone to contact the children of these executives are completely false. \u201cElliott has always behaved ethically in its disputes with corporate managements and boards, and it is regrettable and disappointing that certain parties adverse to us would choose to promote false allegations about us rather than engage on the merits of our arguments in good faith.\u201d\n\nBut in the insular world of activist hedge funds, Elliott appears to have a reputation for particularly hardball tactics, several sources say. Distaste for this no-holds-barred approach even led one prominent activist, Jeff Ubben, the CEO of hedge fund ValueAct, to stick up for Kleinfeld during a panel discussion on activism at the Milken Institute conference in May.\n\nStill, dirt-digging and other aggressive tactics, while controversial, have the benefit of exerting power beyond what money can buy. And they shed light on just what distinguishes Elliott from its less successful peers. \u201cTo do activism really, really well, you have to be not only smart and persistent, but you have to be willing,\u201d says David Rosewater, who advises companies as the global head of Morgan Stanley\u2019s shareholder activism and corporate defense group, and who has previously represented Elliott as an attorney. \u201cNot everybody is willing to be the bad guy.\u201d\n\nElliott Management was founded in 1977 by Paul Elliott Singer, a lawyer by training who found he could use the court system to great gain as an investor in bankruptcy situations and arbitrage. Conservative in almost every sense of the word, the billionaire Singer, now 73, insists on hedging all his investments to reduce the risk of loss, and prizes \u201cmanual efforts\u201d\u2014in other words, old-fashioned elbow grease\u2014as the defining characteristic of his investment style.\n\nA powerful GOP donor who split with his party by funding the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement\u2014and by supporting same-sex marriage\u2014Singer is also obsessed about his own and his employees\u2019 physical safety, according to those who know him well. Elliott largely bans staff from social media; with few exceptions, employees cannot post pictures of themselves online\u2014not even an official headshot\u2014making them virtual ghosts in the digital age. The precaution is meant to protect them from anyone who might hold a grudge against the firm. \u201cPaul has always been paranoid about security,\u201d says one Elliott investor, who asked not to be identified for fear of offending Singer. In an extreme extension of that philosophy, Singer has even hedged his Manhattan headquarters, maintaining a backup version of the five-floor offices in New Jersey, just in case.\n\nIn the 1980s and \u201990s, Elliott applied its acumen primarily to distressed debt and other more esoteric securities where relatively few Wall Street investors ventured. But the modern history of Elliott\u2019s activism begins in 2004 with the arrival of Jesse Cohn. Now 37, Cohn is Elliott\u2019s enfant terrible; a car fanatic and triathlete from Long Island who can talk so quickly it sometimes seems like he\u2019s on fast-forward. A self-described computer-camp geek, Cohn spent two years as an M&A banker at Morgan Stanley before joining Elliott. That\u2019s where he started writing letters to small tech companies, urging them to put themselves up for auction to garner big gains for their shareholders.\n\nCohn\u2019s fanboy-meets-dealmaker affect earned him a reputation as a bit of a whippersnapper. In 2010, in a letter to the board of Novell, he boasted of earning one of the company\u2019s IT certifications when he was 14\u2014a charming bit of common ground that shared the pages with a hostile bid to buy the firm. The brash move worked\u2014Novell was sold to private equity\u2014and Cohn\u2019s formula impressed his bosses enough that they promoted him to head all of its U.S. equity activism. Cohn\u2019s campaigns have resulted in the takeouts or buyouts of more than a dozen companies, including BMC Software, Informatica, LifeLock and, biggest of all, EMC, which Dell acquired for $67 billion in 2015. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone has any more experience than he does prosecuting activist campaigns,\u201d says Chris Young, head of contested situations at Credit Suisse, who has known Cohn since the latter started at Elliott.\n\nWhile Singer eschews sitting on corporate boards, Cohn sits on four, and has become so integral to the firm that some of Elliott\u2019s investors mistakenly believe Cohn is Singer\u2019s nephew. While Singer seldom appears in public (he declined to be interviewed for this article) and rarely takes part in negotiations with companies the firm targets, Cohn is often on the front lines. \u201cPaul is the final decision maker on lots of these issues, but Jesse is the guy, and everyone in the activist community knows who he is,\u201d says Marc Weingarten, a partner and cochair of the shareholder activism group at law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel who has represented Elliott.\n\nIn private, people sitting across the table from Cohn have seen another side of him, that of a maestro in the art of applying strategic pressure. That aspect of him bubbled into public view with Compuware, the Detroit-based business software maker that eventually sold to private equity firm Thoma Bravo for $2.4 billion in 2014 as a result of Elliott\u2019s campaign.\n\nIn September 2013, a delegation from the Compuware board flew to New York to meet with Elliott about its demands for the company. Cohn opened the meeting by casually flipping through a six-inch-thick manila folder of purportedly embarrassing information on his guests, which included former GM CEO Fritz Henderson. Bill Grabe, an advisory director at private equity firm General Atlantic who sat on Compuware\u2019s board at the time, would later testify in arbitration proceedings that Cohn unabashedly brought Henderson\u2019s daughter into the conversation. \u201cAnd you know, you have a daughter that\u2019s doing this and whatnot,\u201d Grabe recalled Cohn saying, paraphrasing the young fund manager. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with somebody whose tactics it is to intimidate, to splinter, to do everything they can to be disruptive,\u201d Grabe testified. In the same case, then\u2013Compuware CEO Bob Paul testified that in a follow-up phone call, Cohn dropped a \u201cveiled threat\u201d that he knew Paul kept an Aston Martin in his garage, saying, \u201cBy the way, love that English car you\u2019re driving.\u201d\n\nThese encounters, first disclosed during a wrongful termination dispute with Compuware cofounder Peter Karmanos Jr., have provided ammunition for Karmanos\u2019s current suit in Michigan state court, accusing Elliott of \u201cblackmailing\u201d the directors into selling the company. \u201cElliott is taking advantage of the situation,\u201d Karmanos tells Fortune, \u201cand then when they wanted to push it a little harder, they bend the rules.\u201d Karmanos started Compuware in 1973 with a few hundred dollars in tax refund checks. He had already announced his retirement from the board when Elliott launched its campaign, but was fired as a consultant a few months later for saying publicly that he \u201cwould tell the hedge fund to go fuck themselves\u201d\u2014comments he says he does not regret. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to watch it just get torn apart by those jerks in New York,\u201d he says.\n\nA person who was in the room when Cohn brought out the dossiers says the ploy had no influence on the board\u2019s decisions, though it was unmistakably a threat to release damaging information. \u201cThere was no question as to what the intent was of that folder,\u201d the person says. The directors had come to the meeting prepared, after their counterparts at rival BMC, which Elliott had come after a year earlier, warned them of similar tactics. That effort included a disturbing phone call to a BMC director\u2019s daughter, the Compuware directors say.\n\nElliott declined to comment. But a person close to the firm says the shtick was designed \u201cto be sort of funny, but sort of brutal,\u201d a kind of shame game cataloging the board\u2019s conflicts of interest, and conveying that the jig was up. The intel itself implicated the director, not his daughter, even if she was the source of it, the person adds: \u201cWe draw the line there. His daughter doesn\u2019t sit on the board.\u201d\n\nStill, such maneuvers are concerning to investors like ValueAct\u2019s Ubben, who worry that Elliott may undermine the ability of other activists to work with companies in good faith, whether by its indifference to the human toll of its campaigns or because of its apparent affinity for knocking companies out of existence. \u201cOur form of activism could not be more different than Elliott,\u201d Ubben tells Fortune. Ubben\u2019s hedge fund\u2019s behind-closed-doors campaign at Microsoft (MSFT), now going on five years, is credited with expediting the tech giant\u2019s turnaround under CEO Satya Nadella. \u201cElliott is single-handedly making the public markets less attractive to companies,\u201d Ubben says, \u201cand we see it in the shrinking number of public companies and the growth in private ownership.\u201d\n\nWhile Cohn was in the trenches with Compuware, a sea change was taking hold inside Elliott. Elliott\u2019s top brass saw Cohn\u2019s strategy as an obvious extension of the firm\u2019s bread-and-butter, labor-intensive investing, and five years ago they kicked it into high gear. Elliott had a generation of young managers eager to do what Cohn had done in their respective industries, from energy to metals and mining. Jonathan Pollock, who had practiced closed-end fund arbitrage in Europe and Asia, had returned to New York a few years earlier, and now fused the principles upon which Singer had built the firm into an equity strategy that could travel across Elliott and the globe.\n\nThe first big test was Hess. With a market cap of about $25 billion at the time, the family-run oil and gas empire was the largest company Elliott had ever gone after, and it occupied a nostalgic place in American culture thanks to the novelty toy trucks it released each year at Christmastime. Hess never saw Elliott coming. Elliott owned only 4% of Hess\u2019s stock\u2014not enough to necessitate an activist warning-shot 13D filing with the SEC\u2014in January 2013 when the fund went public with a proxy campaign to replace five of the board\u2019s directors. Elliott alleged that Hess was paying execs some of the highest compensation packages in the industry, while stock returns were near the bottom. It was \u201ca sneak attack,\u201d recalls Thomas Kean, the former Republican governor of New Jersey and one of the Hess directors in Elliott\u2019s crosshairs.\n\nHess had an aura of impenetrability as one of America\u2019s last dynastic corporations. But the hedge fund nominated an unimpeachable lineup of new directors (including former CEOs of BP and American Express), none of whom worked for Elliott, forcing shareholders to evaluate its arguments on merit. The Hess board \u201clooked like the junior varsity B team when you compared them to the Elliott slate,\u201d Cernich says. Elliott, Kean claims, told some institutional shareholders that failing to support its candidates would be tantamount to neglecting their fiduciary duty\u2014an allegation with potential legal consequences.\n\n\u201cElliott is single-handedly making the public markets less attractive to companies.\u201d\n\nJeff Ubben, activist investor and CEO of hedge fund ValueAct\n\nOn the eve of the proxy vote at the May 2013 annual meeting, representatives of Elliott and Hess holed up counting incoming votes in the Four Seasons hotel in Houston. It was only around 10 p.m., when the outcome was still too close to call, that the two sides came together, working through the night on a settlement: At 6:30 a.m., Hess announced that it would add three of Elliott\u2019s nominees to its board. Kean, after 23 years of service, relinquished his seat. \u201cBy taking that on, they showed that they could move up the weight class to take on bigger companies, and that\u2019s that,\u201d Kean says. The Hess family\u2019s defeat also reverberated beyond Elliott, says a banker who advises companies on facing activists: \u201cOnce that broke, I think everybody was like, party on.\u201d\n\nInside Elliott, the mounting victories catalyzed the activist impulse. In October 2015, the hedge fund took on its first retail company with Cabela\u2019s, which eventually sold itself to Bass Pro Shops. For Cohn, the moment of enlightenment came with American Capital. Elliott had originally invested in the obscure financial stock as part of an arbitrage trade, but when a colleague saw that the company was laying groundwork to shield itself from activist investors, he went across the hall to Cohn for the first time.\n\nRunning the company through Elliott\u2019s activism checklist\u2014Is the company undervalued? Can it be fixed? Can you convince other shareholders of the need for change?\u2014Cohn brought the idea of a campaign to Pollock and Singer, who immediately signed off. In mid-November 2015, Elliott sent a public letter to American Capital while simultaneously revealing an 8.4% stake; the company caved just nine days later, announcing it was beginning a sale process. It was the quickest turnaround of any of Elliott\u2019s public campaigns. (Ares Capital acquired the firm six months later for $3.4 billion.) \u201cIt showed that the process really works,\u201d says Cohn. \u201cAnd it\u2019s scalable. That\u2019s part of what I think we\u2019ve proven\u2014we\u2019re not just a group of tech people doing just tech trades; we\u2019re a team that\u2019s able to take what we\u2019ve built and do it over a long period of time, and roll it out to other industries and geographies, too.\u201d\n\nStill, Cohn wasn\u2019t quite satisfied with the machine he\u2019d helped build. From his earliest days at Elliott, he\u2019d harbored a dream that he\u2019d frequently express over dinners with colleagues and advisers. For as many times as he\u2019d pushed companies onto the block, as many sales as he\u2019d secured, there was something missing: Jesse Cohn wanted to buy companies himself.\n\nTo hear Cohn tell it, he\u2019d fallen in love. The time and effort Elliott put in to researching companies before launching campaigns often imbued the activists with an intimate knowledge of, and deep appreciation for, their targets. With EMC, for example, Elliott had spent months getting to know the data storage company, interviewing some 700 of its customers before launching a campaign urging it to pursue M&A opportunities. But when computing giant Dell, with financing from its private equity owner Silver Lake, bought EMC, Elliott was shut out of the deal. One day, Cohn hoped, Elliott would be big enough to afford whales of its own.\n\nCohn\u2019s dream finally came true this fall, when Elliott acquired cybersecurity firm Gigamon for $1.6 billion, less than six months after unveiling a position in the stock. It was the first time Elliott had taken an entire public company private by itself, a major milestone for its relatively new Silicon Valley\u2013based private equity arm, Evergreen Coast Capital.\n\nBut in a bit of high-finance irony, Elliott\u2019s reputation for sharp elbows, Cohn realized, could be a liability in achieving these new goals. Cohn is now often sourcing leads for deals from the very bankers and lawyers who sat across from him during tough negotiations in the past. And with that adjustment, people who\u2019ve worked with him say, has come a newfound sensitivity to how both he and Elliott are perceived.\n\nAt Athenahealth, for example, which Elliott targeted this spring, Cohn has been polite and even complimentary in his interactions with management, despite being a \u201cregular drumbeat\u201d of a presence, according to people close to the health IT company. On occasion, Cohn has been known to let a tinge of guilt creep in when he reflects on his more swashbuckling days. \u201cOur tactics probably evolved over time,\u201d says Pollock, who is Cohn\u2019s boss. \u201cWe\u2019re looking more toward this constructive engagement approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur tactics probably evolved over time. We\u2019re looking more toward this constructive engagement approach.\u201d\n\nJonathan Pollock, co-CEO, Elliott Management\n\nThat\u2019s why Elliott\u2019s attack on Arconic this year ruffled feathers inside and outside the firm. Led by 38-year-old portfolio manager Dave Miller, the campaign rhetoric packed more vitriol than any of Elliott\u2019s campaigns in recent memory. Elliott\u2019s 336-slide deck, distributed to Arconic shareholders and released publicly, depicted Kleinfeld as the Monopoly man, running away with money bags. It also alluded to Kleinfeld having personality abnormalities (a claim Arconic dismissed as an \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d ad hominem attack), prompting some to observe that Elliott could have a split personality of its own. \u201cThe problem is, I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m going to get the mensch or the schmuck,\u201d Joele Frank, of the eponymous public relations firm that has helped companies fight Elliott and other activists, commented at a panel at a Tulane law school event in March. (Miller, for his part, was promoted to head of U.S. restructuring at Elliott this spring.)\n\nThe Arconic campaign also illustrated Elliott\u2019s power to deploy a seemingly bottomless amount of resources. In May, nearly a month after Kleinfeld resigned, Elliott did something no one has done before or since. Along with paper proxy-vote cards, the hedge fund mailed rechargeable video players, slightly smaller than an iPad, loaded with a four-minute attack ad\u2014alleging Kleinfeld \u201chas the worst track record of any CEO in the S&P 500 over his tenure\u201d\u2014that played automatically when investors opened the package. Sent to tens of thousands of large retail shareholders, the gimmick alone cost Elliott as much as $3 million, proxy contest advisers estimate. While Arconic disclosed it spent $58 million defending itself, it\u2019s likely the hedge fund spent nearly as much if not more in the attack, according to people who worked on the campaign. After two failed rounds of settlement talks in which Singer made a rare personal appearance, Arconic ultimately agreed to add three of Elliott\u2019s four picks to its board. \u201cWhen Elliott shows up, it\u2019s a completely different ball game,\u201d says Weingarten, the Schulte lawyer. \u201cThey are relentless. They have the money, and they will spare no expense to ensure that they win.\u201d\n\nJoshua Bright\u2014The New York Times/Redux\n\nFrom Elliott\u2019s perspective, the approach was warranted, given the resistance they\u2019d encountered. Pollock notes that Arconic was one of just a handful of its campaigns, along with Hess and Samsung, where a true battle ensued. \u201cI don\u2019t count the three or four as a success, necessarily,\u201d he says. (Adds someone close to Arconic, \u201cWe didn\u2019t decide to take them on, we just said we disagree.\u201d)\n\nBankers say the Arconic presentation has made the rounds in other companies\u2019 board rooms, and looms large over Elliott\u2019s subsequent campaigns, a warning of what can happen to those who resist its overtures. Whether it fits the firm\u2019s ideals or not, Elliott\u2019s ruthless legacy continues to color its endeavors. Unlike the activist firms run by Bill Ackman or Dan Loeb, the fund Paul Singer founded has raised an army of activists who can influence corporate fiefdoms everywhere. \u201cThere\u2019s some sense that there\u2019s an institution that survives the founder,\u201d says Cernich, the governance adviser, \u201cand that it expands and multiplies the power and effectiveness of the organization.\u201d\n\nPromises Pollock, \u201cWe\u2019ll be around for a while.\u201d Boards, beware.\n\nUpdates: This article was updated on Dec. 13 to include a response that Elliott Management submitted after the article was published.
