He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame Class 2021. The ceremony took place on 9th March 2022 because of the restricted protocols of the pandemic COVID-19.\n\nFinchem also showed his presence on the World Golf Hall of Fame 2022 appearing along with Tiger Woods, and Susie Maxwell Berning in the induction ceremony. Tim Finchem helped the PGA tour to pursue a jump from less than $60 million per year back in 1994 to more than $250 million per year by 2006. At the induction ceremony of the World Golf Hall of Fame 2022, Finchem took the further step to enhance the Players Championship events, building a new clubhouse, and renovating the course in 2006.\n\nEarly Life\n\nTim was born on 19th April 1947 in Ottawa, Illinois, and is currently living in his late 50s. He went to the Princess Anne High School, Virginia, where he received his primary education. Later, he went to receive his secondary education from the University of Richmond, receiving a bachelor of arts in 1969. Finchem received his degree of law from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1973. He had a paper route and used to perform other off jobs.\n\nRather than spending his money on purchasing candy and other small toys, Finchem was interested since childhood to play golf. So he used to spend his money only on playing golf. Finchem was brought by Harold (father) who was a career marine and used to permit his 8 years old young child to play golf with his buddies. Finchem is one of the oldest sons born in a family of six children, including three boys and three girls.\n\nTim Finchem Career\n\nBefore coming into the field of gold administration, Tim Finchem had pursued a great career in the line of law and practice. He practiced law in Virginia Beach at the University of Virginia School of Law for at least three years. Afterward, he served his position in the White House while being under the administrative powers of Jimmy Carter. He served as the deputy advisor to the President in the office of Economic Affairs. Later in the 1980s, he co-founded a group of National Marketing and Strategies in Washington, D.C. Later in June 1994, Finchem was appointed as the commissioner. He succeeded the position of Deane Beman, who retired from the position after serving for at least 20 years.\n\nPrevious to this, Finchem went to experience the responsibilities of the Vice President of Business Affairs, Deputy Commissioner, and Chief Operating Officer of the Tour. While being a commissioner, Finchem worked on the earning opportunities and let the PGA Tour players serve the increase in both domestic as well as international tours. Finchem remained the president of the television broadcasting deals for at least three years in 1997, 2001, and 2005. Back in 2006, Finchem helped the PGA tour to meet the hike from $56.4 million in 1994 to $256.8 million in 2006. It was one of the most remarkable growth of the organization which had a lot of things to do with the golf player Tiger Woods, as he also received the credit for the same.\n\nTim Finchem Biography Real Name Timothy W.

We'll see how that plays out over the next couple of years.\"\n\n.\n\nTimothy W. Finchem has been the commissioner of the PGA Tour since 1994, overseeing an unprecedented era of growth for the pro golf industry - one that has seen the annual amount of money awarded to players grow from $56.4 million when he started to a whopping $256.8 million in 2006.\n\nIt hasn't hurt to have someone like Tiger Woods explode on the scene while you're in charge, of course, but most everyone who follows the game agrees that Finchem has done a phenomenal job overseeing the tour's growth, while also galvanizing the sport's charitable efforts and creating opportunities for minority and disadvantaged children to take up a sport long known as a bastion of the elite.\n\nFinchem was in San Francisco recently to help promote next year's Presidents Cup, a competition that pits U.S. players against some the best non-European players from the rest of the world. The event will be held at San Francisco's Harding Park for the first time, with Fred Couples captaining the American squad and the resurgent Greg Norman at the helm for the international team.\n\nFinchem took some time to sit down with Chronicle editors and writers to discuss the business of golf, an industry challenged in these times of turmoil like most every other. Here is a transcript of that interview, edited for length and clarity:\n\nQ:The economic downturn definitely poses some issues for the PGA Tour and the golf industry. Recently, you discussed sponsorships with companies like Wachovia and Morgan Stanley, which find themselves in the middle of the mess on Wall Street. How is that impacting the PGA and is that a serious concern for you?\n\nA: It's certainly a concern. It's too early to tell about the impact, though. Some of the industry sectors that gravitate to our platform have imploded, some of them are struggling and some are actually doing OK.\n\nThus far, the ones that are doing OK and the ones that are reorganizing and merging tend to be on our list (of partners). The ones that have imploded are not on our list. We sort of dodged the bullet thus far.\n\nThat said, there is an awful lot of stress on some of our key industry sectors - financial services and autos, etc. We'll see how that plays out over the next couple of years.\n\nA lot of these companies are enlightened sponsors. By that, I mean they take advantage of what we tend to refer to as the three major value streams, one of which is branding. Barclays and Deutsche Bank get a lot of mileage out of our demographic.\n\nSecondly, they can take advantage of business-to-business activity on-site during tournaments. Third, and increasingly, companies are taking advantage of the relationship between our charitable focus and its impacts. That's what we call our qualitative branding.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, if you look back over the last 20 years at other downturns, companies challenge their cost structure much more aggressively than they do when times are good. That impacts the way they evaluate sports marketing sponsorships.\n\nWe've typically come out of these things better off than we were going in. Now that remains to be seen this time around.\n\nIf this thing doesn't last too much longer, I think we can weather the storm without any retrenchment of our overall delivery to players and fans.\n\nQ:You've used that word - \"retrenchment\" - in a few recent interviews. What do you mean by retrenchment?\n\nA: Whether it's good news or bad news, at a moment like this, we've grown in output in major areas of our business, which is generating financial benefits to players, raising money for charity and helping to grow the game. The first two are the major focus of the PGA Tour. We've grown every year for years. When I say retrenchment, a dead flat-line (in growth) would not be something we are used to. If we go down, that would be unique.\n\nQ:The PGA Tour has a reserve of money it can call on in tough times. Would you tap that if you did have a decrease in sponsorships?\n\nA: It's pretty simple. Through team sports and alliances, a big percentage of our revenue is derived from the communications side - broadcasts, etc. When we do our longer-term arrangements with television, and to some extent new media, we project out of that period so that right now we are in a six-year term with our network partners.\n\nOur strategy is to grow our operating reserve during those years so we can withstand some negativity in the next cycle. We've done that for 20 years and it's worked well. We've grown in all those years. The question now is can we grow that reserve a little bit more aggressively to protect against what we were just talking about, namely retrenchment.\n\nQ:Would you grow that through investment vehicles?\n\nA: We need to try to find more revenue with a reduced cost structure. We don't have a lot of flexibility on the cost-structure side because we like to think we're pretty efficient.\n\nQ:Can you give our readers a sense of the revenue that the PGA generates?\n\nA: In this cycle, we're moving toward the billion-dollar mark in gross revenue. That includes only about 10 to 15 percent of our charitable giving because charitable giving is in partnership with tournaments. The extent of the overall enterprise is north of a billion dollars a year.\n\nQ:Even before this difficult economic period, there are a lot of challenges facing the game of golf. There are fewer rounds being played. There are fewer courses opening and more courses closing. What is your assessment of the health of the game of golf, and why do you think those issues have developed?\n\nA: People that go out and play the game tend to be fans, they tend to come to tournaments, they tend to watch us on television. But some studies we've done show that maybe 35 percent of our fan base doesn't really play the game. In fact, an ESPN sports poll puts our fan base - those who have some interest in the sport - at over 110 million Americans. Usually you see the number of 28 (million) to 30 million for people that play irregularly.\n\nThat said, part of our mission is to foster and grow the game. If you read a negative article about golf - one that argues that golf may be tailing off a little bit - it's predicated on one or two things. One is that rounds (played) are down or flat. The second is some golf courses have closed or a golf course has been sold.\n\nThose are two very different dynamics. On the rounds played side, it's true that some percentage of the regular golfers are playing a little less, but he or she are still regular golfers.\n\nThe challenge in that area is time constraints. When you take something that takes 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours to play, it gets pressured in this environment. It doesn't mean that it's a less attractive game to the person that is playing it. Heck, I haven't played in 2 1/2 months. But the number of people playing the game has increased. It's not huge, but a steady increase since the days of Arnold Palmer.\n\nOn the real estate side of the equation, it's just a different set of dynamics. Overbuilding in South Florida, Myrtle Beach, S.C., some parts of the Southwest, and speculation in the for-profit daily fee golf part of the industry has resulted in some overbuilding.\n\nWe're seeing another set of dynamics with younger people. With Tiger Woods in his 10th year on the tour, with more diversity, a lot of diversity on the LPGA, the Anthony Kims, the Camilo Villegas near the top. We are seeing more interest among Hispanic kids, African American kids. When we get the game to them, these kids are coming out and taking advantage of it.\n\nOn a global basis, when you stand back and look at what's transpired and you see the growth that has occurred over the last 50 years in Japan, the last 25 years in Korea and the last 10 years in China - golf courses being built in Russia and Eastern Europe and in the developing markets - golf is taking off as the middle class takes off.\n\nOf all of that, the piece that I'm worried about is in the U.S. market, where people are less inclined to play as much as they used to because of the time constraints. Can you make golf attractive as a nine-hole sport and a two-hour activity? Or a three-hole par three like we do with a lot of First Tee facilities to make it fun and entertaining?\n\nQ:Golf evolved as primarily a country club, private membership thing. Is the trend now moving away from that, more toward public courses and places where anybody can go? Or is it going the other direction?\n\nA: The attitude about the game has changed in terms of demographic groups that historically haven't had access to the game, either because it's geographically inaccessible, it's too expensive, or in some cases, there just hasn't been a role model out there.\n\nWe see the trending in a very positive way. In the last 60 years, the history of the game shows that it's really the exciting players who play at the professional level that drive the interest. Those players are gradually changing away from all white males to exciting lady players and Hispanic players, and that is driving the focus among the kids.\n\nQ:In this country, is the demographic getting younger or older in terms of golf play?\n\nA: I think it's flat. I think it's going to be another 10 years before we'll start to see movement. When we talk about overall golf play, you have Baby Boomers coming into the population in post-retirement numbers in the tens of millions. That fuels a lot of growth at that end of the age spectrum. It's good news in the sense that those are people that will have more time to spend and that will help fuel growth in rounds.\n\nQ:Sounds like the time commitment has really held back participation. I've read some stories where writers talk about dividing a course into three six-hole segments. Someone could then play in 1 1/2 hours if so inclined. Is that a viable option?\n\nA: I don't know how viable that is. There are a number of factors, one of which is the golf course itself. Is it a golf course that the average player can get around and play? Harding Park is a golf course that you can go out here and you're not going to lose a golf ball. There are golf courses that don't fit that model. They take longer to play.\n\nIn Europe, if you go to Scotland and Ireland in the summertime, people go out after dinner and they play alternate shot, they play in two hours, they play nine holes in an hour and 20 minutes. I think the mind-set needs to be changed a little bit in the U.S. so that people understand why you can enjoy the game without the need to post this 18-hole score and compare it to the other 20 times you played last year.\n\nQ: The PGA wants golf to become an Olympic sport. Why do you think that's important, and particularly how do you think that would impact the business of golf?\n\nA: The overriding reason that we've endorsed it is this: There are over 100 countries around the world within which sports activity is funded to some extent by the government. But in those countries, no money goes to any sport that is not on the Olympic program. If we are successful next year in getting the votes to become an Olympic sport, for the next seven years until we actually play golf in the Olympics in 2016, those countries will start to unlock resources to help to grow the game. That's a big deal. That's our major focus.\n\nCandidly, in the last 10 years for us on the U.S. PGA Tour, international television rights have been a very nice source of growth.\n\nTen years ago, we probably only had 20 non-American players who were exempt. Now we have 82. When Sergio Garcia (from Spain) plays, people want to stay and watch him, and television enhances that experience. We sell that.\n\nQ:Golf has invested some money in public courses like Harding Park here in San Francisco and Bethpage Black in New York and taken more key championships to public courses. Could you talk about the business strategy behind those investments and what you expect to get out of it?\n\nA: It just goes without saying that Augusta National is probably the best stage for golf, although we are partial to the Stadium Course at Sawgrass (a PGA-owned course). Nonetheless, I think Augusta earns that position. But there is just something from a fan standpoint about watching a tournament on television knowing that you can go and play that course.\n\nQ:How about the FBR Open (in Arizona) and its famously rowdy 16th hole? What's the position of the PGA on that kind of behavior?\n\nA: It's kind of a fine line, but I'll take the big crowds. Big crowds light it up for the viewer, especially in the high-definition (TV) world. You have these great pictures.\n\nThe great thing I thought about the Ryder Cup was taking down a bunch of trees at Valhalla. You had these expansive crowds. It's just a great message: This is big and exciting. Now, we need to maintain a certain level of decorum so guys can play golf, and I'm not so sure I want to see that level of noise every week, but on balance I think it adds a nice dimension to what people think and feel about the game.\n\nQ:A follow-up about taking events to public courses, specifically here at Harding. I'm curious as to your reflections on your experience from hosting a PGA Tour event here in 2005 and going forward, the complications.\n\nSan Francisco has grappled with how to handle public golf courses for years and right now is going through an effort to possibly privatize the management of those courses. How complicated has that been and how do you see that playing out?\n\nA: It's not all that complicated. Any county and city has spending priorities. These are tough times. Budgets get cut, and we're going to work very closely with the mayor and everybody here to make sure that we get to where we need to be. I'm sure we will. The mayor has been insistent from day one that he's going to ride this out.\n\nYour point about 2005 at Harding is that the galleries here were so good. There were numerous, solid, big galleries. They were knowledgeable golf fans and they were diverse. When you saw the pictures on the air, they were great stories. When John Daly and Tiger Woods went out and played the playoff and Tiger won the playoff, everybody came back up to the clubhouse to see the trophy. This is a great sports town.\n\nQ:Both the PGA and the USGA seem to have taken an increased interest in California as a marketplace for golf lately. I was wondering if you could talk about why that is and what advantage that brings from your business perspective?\n\nA: California is huge. There are a lot of great golf courses here. The weather pattern works. The galleries have been terrific, so what's not to like?\n\nQ:Do you see more advantage in having West Coast tournaments and possibly majors? You have prime-time audiences because of the time shift.\n\nA: As network programming has tailed off in recent years versus cable, you get certain situations where the network would prefer to put PGA Tour players on the air and run prime-time programming. It's a great message for the sport. I didn't know anybody that didn't watch every minute of the U.S. Open with Tiger in contention.\n\nQ:How much did it cost to have Tiger Woods out of action this year with his leg injuries?\n\nA: A day or two after the announcement, I stated that we were going to lose television ratings in the weeks that he played last year versus not playing this year, and we did. He brings a lot of soft viewers - people that don't watch our product all the time, but they do watch him.\n\nThe good news is it created this window for everybody to see our other players. Today, Anthony Kim and Camilo Villegas are very different in the psyche of our fans than they were when Tiger stepped out, and I guarantee you they could have played exactly the same, but if Tiger was out there, they would have had significantly reduced exposure.\n\nGoing forward, we know there's going to be this speculation. Can he play? Is the leg going to hold up? Can he turn on it? Can he win?\n\nYou also have a whole different story: How is Tiger going to fare against these guys? They are really good. It's a short-term negative and a long-term positive. I would not have wished this to happen, by any means. Tiger is phenomenally impactful. Given the situation, we were hoping we would get something out of it, and I think we have.\n\nTo find past On the Record interviews, go to www.sfgate.com/chronicle/ontherecord."}, {"url": "https://latestinbollywood.com/tim-finchem/", "page_content": "Tim Finchem Wiki:- Tim is an American lawyer along with being a former golf administrator.

We are joined by PGA TOUR Commissioner Tim Finchem, if you would like to start us out with a few opening comments.\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: Well, I don't really have anything to it announce or anything. It's just nice to be back here in Washington. A number of you have reached out to me in the last few days with a question here or there, and since we had not been together in a while, I thought I would just allow you the opportunity to ask me anything you want.\n\nI'll just say generally, we are delighted with the opening ceremony today and the quality of the golf course here is exceptional.\n\nI toured the changes in the clubhouse yesterday. The clubhouse is going to be second only to one in Sawgrass, Florida; the best tournament golf clubhouse in America. We are excited about where the tournament is.\n\nSo hats off to Greg McLaughlin and his team for another good job this year, and with that, I'll try to answer your questions.\n\n\n\nQ. That being said, the history of golf in the Washington has always been Kemper and Booz Allen and we don't get a lot of Top-10, Top-25 players, and even though this is Tiger's tournament, we still only have two guys in the Top-10 and a lot of guys not playing this week; is it an aberration, and why are they not coming to a course like this hosted by a player like Tiger?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: Well, I don't know exactly if I can characterize it as an aberration or not. Normally I think the unique factor right now is we have four top players in addition to Tiger that are hurt. We know for a fact that three of them at least wanted to play, and couldn't play. I mean, Vijay can't play right now. Zach Johnson can't play. Adam Scott can't play. So that's different.\n\nThe other thing, I think that impacted this week, that won't reoccur next year is the British Open Qualifying will not be this week, and I think that has some players playing a couple three weeks in a row and then have to qualify on top of that.\n\n\n\nQ. Over here or over there?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: Over here. It's just extra golf. I think that change will be beneficial next year.\n\nYou know, I think I said last year when we moved forward with this tournament, all of the pieces are here for it to be an especially good tournament on the PGA TOUR. I think that is the case. We have a lot of great players here this week, and one of the things we are looking forward to between now and when Tiger comes back is watching to see who steps up and we'll get another chapter of that this week. So from that standpoint, I'm not too concerned.\n\nWhen you add some of the players that are hurt next year, Tiger being back next year, I really feel good about it. Now what happens beyond that, I probably shouldn't speculate on because I haven't analyzed the field myself or talked to players about it.\n\n\n\nQ. Do you have any concerns or trepidations going forward with the drug testing, the anti-doping program, now that we're here?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: No. We're in the same place we have been.\n\nYou know, our concerns were on two levels, as we articulated early in the year. One level is just a notion of testing -- we had no problem with the rule, but testing per se, and worrying that it might change or be counter to sort of the culture of the sport where you know the rules and you abide by the rules and you call penalties on yourself. Testing is not really consistent with that; although I liken it to testing a driver, because a lot of this doping stuff is how things get in your body, not necessarily that you intended them to get in your body. But that's a long-term thing we have to work on.\n\nThe other set of concerns was on the players getting educated, knowing the rules, paying attention, asking the right questions and I'm delighted that Allison Keller who runs the program; Rick Andersen, our general counsel; and our outside consultants had I think now virtually have sat down with close to 200 players, asked questions, gotten educated. They have taken it very seriously.\n\nI've been through the procedure myself. So the logistics of the procedures are being handled in a way that I think will not create disruption for our players. So on that side of things, I actually feel more comfortable than I did six months ago because we were just getting into it.\n\nYou know, we, of course, we do it and hope it becomes part of what we do; but it's not highlighted and it's not a big deal and it is just part of what we do.\n\n\n\nQ. Is it important for you to go first?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: No, I don't think it's important to go first. I think it's important for me and certain of our executives who are involved with the program to understand exactly what the procedure is, because by doing that, you can kind of see what player reaction will be, what players questions will be, and it's just a good, healthy learning experience. I don't view it as anything meaningful from a symbolism standpoint, but just I think it's important that we understand it in the detail of it.\n\n\n\nQ. Did it go as efficiently as you thought it would?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: It did. I was very pleased with the way it went, and I think that we have every reason to be optimistic that we're not going to have logistical problems; that it's not going to be a big disruption and it's not going to take much time.\n\nThe people that are doing it are quite professional, well organized, buttoned up, and that also conveys a sense of integrity to the process; because as we all know in this area, the integrity of the process is very, very important.\n\n\n\nQ. Do you know how long it took you?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: Nine and a half minutes. And I asked some questions.\n\n\n\nQ. Yesterday or today?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: Let's just say I've been through it. I don't know that it's necessary to get really specific.\n\n\n\nQ. There's been so much talk leading up to the testing program; that golf like every other sport has come to the point where it has to be done, and whether people agree with it, pretty much every major sport is testing. Why the results not to release names and results of players tested and be more open-book about it?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: I don't know. No particular reason except that we don't see any reason to disseminate all that information.\n\nWe will probably provide some gross statistics on the program end of this year or sometime next year in terms of numbers of people, numbers of tests. We may do something like that.\n\nThis is just the way we set the program up. We feel like it's the best way to go about it, and we're not trying to give it a high, high profile. We don't want to encourage people to find Rocco Mediate because the TOUR announced that he was tested last week. It just invites more conversation about a subject that we think should just be done, and if we have issues that arise, we will deal with it.\n\n\n\nQ. If a player tests positive, does that player's test become known? Do the results become known?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: If there's a positive -- this has all been provided, actually, and you can get it us the detail.\n\nA positive test triggers a process. When the process is completed, and the final step in that process is over, we may very well release information that relates to a player, a positive test, and an action that was taken. The first test, the first sample that provides us a positive test just triggers a process.\n\nIf you're familiar with our conduct unbecoming process, it takes a little while, because there's an opportunity for appeals and challenges and you've seen this in other sports. So when the process is completed, we'll have something to say about it.\n\n\n\nQ. So far this week most of the criticism I've heard is from guys who say: You could be taking cold medicine and that kind of thing and you might not know; or the lack of privacy issue. Wondered if you had a response to either one of those issues.\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: Well, the first part of that is, yeah, you hear somebody say, well, can you take a one-a-day vitamin and get a positive reading; and the answer to that is you can; and the reason is it could have been manufactured in Timbuktu in a batch that was tainted, and that's why we provided specific certified options for players to use. You can take a one-a-day vitamin that's on our certification list and you have a certainty or a fairly close certainty that that problem is not going to happen.\n\nIt's all about understanding, asking questions and being prepared to do the right thing every day with what you put in your body. Like I said, I have a pretty good belief that the vast majority of players are providing a lot of due diligence and work on understanding that.\n\nThe second one is invasion of privacy. The problem we have is that whether we like it or not; to the gentleman's question earlier. We're going down this road, because all sports are viewed by fans and the media as having issues in this area, whether we do or not. With the highlighting in cycling in baseball in recent years, it's become intense with the involvement of Capitol Hill in all sports of what they are doing in anti-doping; we just felt we had to go down this road.\n\nNow that we are going down the road, we have to have a credible program, and the only way to have a credible program and meet the basic tenets of the anti-doping world is to have observed testing. And it may be uncomfortable for some, but that's the price we're paying to have a credible system and deal with the issue.\n\n\n\nQ. This tournament is going to be here next year, obviously 2010 and 2011 not. You have a pretty nice golf course being built across the street here. Is there any pressure from the TOUR to play at Avenel or TPC Potomac or whatever you're calling it these guys?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: No.\n\n\n\nQ. And would you have a problem if it moved out of town for a couple years?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: Well, the first question, why not, I guess there's two reasons for that. One is that the golf course, our golf course down the street here, is torn up. It's not done. I think we learned our lesson in 1985, 1986; that you don't move a golf tournament to a golf course before you've finished, or before it's done. It just doesn't make any sense.\n\nMore importantly, 2010 and 2011 is right in the sweet spot of the U.S. Open cycle in this market. You know, from a foundation standpoint, they may very well conclude that a venue outside of this market makes sense for one of or both of those years. We wouldn't argue with that and would say that that probably makes the most sense at this point, but they are taking the lead and we are being supportive.\n\nIt's important to note that with Avenel, we were into this event before we pulled the trigger on the construction at Avenel, and we went ahead with the construction at Avenel assuming we are not going to play this tournament there for the long term. But the reason we went ahead with it was, one, it makes it a better club, makes it a better part of the TPC network. I think it's going to be a phenomenal finish to it, and it's good for the members.\n\nSo we are comfortable with that, and we don't see any need to try to play this tournament over there. We recognize that the board here has voted to recommend to the members a long-term arrangement, and we'll have to see how that turns out, but we are going to be very supportive and hopeful that the members will improve that.\n\n\n\nQ. Speaking of construction on clubhouses, is the TOUR behind financially any of the renovations on the clubhouse here?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: No.\n\n\n\nQ. East Lake is also undergoing a clubhouse renovation. The TOUR is financially behind that; correct, partially?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: Not the clubhouse, no. No, we're not involved in the clubhouse renovation. East Lake club is doing that.\n\n\n\nQ. That's different from what I heard from somebody at East Lake.\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: We are not in any way -- PGA TOUR is not in any way involved in the changes of the clubhouse. We are involved in some changes on the golf course. We provided our staff, Steve Wenzloff, our design guys work closely with Rees Jones on that. The tournament will be supported financially, which I assume you could say \"the TOUR,\" but we are not involved in the clubhouse change.\n\n\n\nQ. As far as staying in East Lake, that was a tournament that had moved back and forth before deciding to stay in Atlanta -- maybe what Len was getting at; going out of town for a little bit. The season-ender in Atlanta, as far as the importance of staying in a consistent market and not moving back and forth --\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: There's pluses and minuses going either way.\n\nRight now we have a terrific relationship with Coca-Cola and the East Lake Club. We like being there to tell the story of what East Lake has meant to Atlanta, and we take most of the fact that the East Lake concept is starting to be picked up in other cities, and we want to be part of promoting that. The venue is great and has gotten better with the recent changes that are being done now. And we just lost our other PGA TOUR event which means it's the only PGA TOUR event in a 6.5 million-size market.\n\nSo for the foreseeable future, it would be our intent to stay there.\n\n\n\nQ. First of all, I wondered what you thought of Tiger's playing with pain when you saw it in realtime, and what did you think two days later when you found out that he had the ACL and the broken shin? Are you surprised more guys didn't jump out of the sky to come here and support him after something that amazing?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: Well, let me answer the last part of that first.\n\nTiger already I think answered that as adequately as I could, which is that players play their schedules for lots of different reasons and they all come at it differently. So you just have to at the end of the day respect their decision.\n\nHere the Foundation, I think this tournament is going to work very well for the Foundation and it's going to be a success for the reasons it was established.\n\nTo the earlier question, it was just one of the more amazing, if not the most amazing week of golf that I've seen in the sense of the extent to which it captivated so many people. I mean, if you look at the ratings at the end of the evenings on Saturday and Sunday, and the other thing was, it sort of accelerated as the week went on. Each day was bigger and better than the last, right up to the last putt on the 91st hole.\n\nAmazing stories I've heard over the last couple of weeks about people: Families gathered around TVs, kids who don't normally follow the game glued to hours of golf coverage. Just the whole thing was magic. And then for everybody to be informed afterwards that his knee was even worse than had been discussed, was pretty a amazing in and of itself.\n\nAnd I'll just relate that one little anecdote; that I visited with Tiger in Orlando a couple weeks after his scoping. And as he usually does, he's giving me a lot of joking about how much he'll play. \"Maybe I'll retire when I'm 36 with my knee,\" all this stuff. So at some point, he said, \"By the way, how many tournaments do I have to play to be eligible for Player of the Year?\"\n\nAnd thinking he was joking, I said, \"Well, I'm not sure, Tiger, but you've got to play more than you've played thus far this year.\"\n\nAnd he said, \"So if I play the U.S. Open and win, I could conceivably win Player of the Year?\"\n\nSo when he won, and then the ACL information came out, I was more impressed with his joking that day. (Laughter) Because I guess he figured out that he couldn't not play the U.S. Open on a golf course that he had played so well on; and he was going to play and he was going to win, and that was the end of that. Pretty amazing stuff.\n\n\n\nQ. Along those lines, do you think a lot of what captivated public was Rocco, or do you think without him the rest of the year, more of those kind of guys can help keep things going?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: Sure. When Tiger is in the tournament, and by the way, I'm not being critical because he's by far and away probably the most-recognized personality on the globe; he just eats television coverage. So it's very hard for a guy who is playing well, coming through to get the amount of television coverage.\n\nAnd so the same performance for a player next week or this week or the British Open or a John Deere, any of the weeks we have for the rest of the year will be magnified significantly with Tiger not in the field. And that allows players to become better known to fans, to step up, maybe create some situations where there's a lot of speculation by you folks; here is a guy who has really played great, and you start speculating on how is it going to shake out when these two or three guys come into next year and Tiger is back.\n\nSo there's a lot of good story lines that will come out of it. In our business, the only problem in having a dominant player is that it's harder for us to continue to grow the list of stars; and when somebody is as dominant as Tiger, and it's even more difficult, because they pale in comparison to somebody of that stature.\n\nSo this is a great opportunity for us, and I think in many ways, it could generate real value for the TOUR for the next few years.\n\n\n\nQ. Couple of little questions. Considering what happened at Torrey Pines, had you thought about taking The Presidents Cup into primetime next year? Have you had any discussions with NBC about that?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: Yes, we have, and we will be into primetime. We haven't quite figured out the details on the schedule but we won't be a ten o'clock finish on the east, I wouldn't think.\n\n\n\nQ. Just thankful for the deadline. I didn't know if you had anything to add to that.\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: No.\n\n\n\nQ. Secondly on drug testing, do you think that when this is up and running for a year, that if there are no positive tests, as it relates to performance-enhancing that this will take care of any naysayers?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: Any naysayers? That's impossible. I think the thing in the whole world of drug testing and anti-doping is that if you're not getting positive tests, somebody is going to write a blog that says your testing is screwed up: How can that be? You have a testing program; you must have had a problem to begin with or you wouldn't have done it. There's going to be naysayers regardless of what happens.\n\nBut on balance, among people who follow the sport and know these athletes, I think a rigorous testing program will add credibility to the general notion, which I think we all recognize, there are not that many people who believe that there is any significant issue here prior to this rule going into effect. Credibility requires that we have the program.\n\n\n\nQ. Have you completely closed the door on Tiger making some sort of cameo here this week? He did sort of leave the door open in saying that he does not pay attention to his doctors; have you completely ruled it out?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: I quit predicting what Tiger Woods would do when -- the last time I predicted something was I didn't think he would win as frequently as Jack Nicklaus; so I gave up on that. I'm done.\n\nI think Greg McLaughlin indicated yesterday that it was unlikely that Tiger would be here this year. I have nothing to add to that. I spoke to him this morning but he didn't indicate to me that he was planning to come.\n\n\n\nQ. One more thing about the rest of the year. There's a lot at stake, not just the majors but the FedExCup and all. I just wondered, in your crystal ball, how you think it's going to be with somebody going for the ten million and you don't have Tiger?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: Well, it's the same phenomena as we talked about a few minutes ago. If Tiger was going into Atlanta in the top three or four positions, everybody would think he was going to win.\n\nI don't think there's another player that can go into Atlanta in the top three or four positions with everybody thinking they are going to win. So what everybody is going to think is it's going to be a dogfight, depending on how the -- once they get to see the seeds. So it has all the possibility of being in many ways very, very exciting, and of course that's what we hope to see.\n\n\n\nQ. Just want to clarify one thing. If there's a positive test, and the process begins and in the course of this process there's an appeal, is that to you?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: Well, there's appeals and appeals. Have we disseminated the information on the process?\n\n\n\nQ. I've got some but I'm kind of leading to a question, I just wanted to make sure I had part of that right. I thought part of the appeal was to you, and I thought there was an outside agency that heard the appeal.\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: There is no outside agency.\n\n\n\nQ. The buck stops with you?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: Yes.\n\n\n\nQ. Do you think the more you read about various appeals of other athletes, and it seems like once they get to that stage, seems like it anyway this they are guilty until proven innocent, Gatlin, for example, very hard to get that overturned. Is there a perception in the case of a dispute in golf that the TOUR tends to side with the player that you perhaps might be more willing to listen than perhaps other sports and that you have a problem in that you have too much discretion and leeway?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: Yeah, I've written to some people who have written that kind of stuff. The only thing I would say is that we've operated our conduct rules for at least in my case 15 years. We have a wide range of discretion, and we've done a good job. I mean, we are not known as a sport that has bad behavior among its athletes. We work hard at that, and. We do it with a process that includes reaching out to players and educating them; and includes very strong disciplinary action with necessary and includes discretion and flexibility, because they are not black-and-white situations.\n\nAs we get into this environment, we're going to apply the same thought process of: We are not necessarily going to conclude that anybody is guilty until proven innocent. It's going to take on -- if you look through the details of what's involved in anti-doping and the substances that are involved, and the levels that are measured, there's a wide range of factual information that would impact our thinking on terms of what steps to take in a given situation.\n\nWhether somebody someplace doesn't like that, I think the proof is in the pudding. We are in a position to keep -- put this rule to effect, enforce it, keep the kind of problems out of the sport that we have seen in other sports, and in three, four, five years, we'll look back and say, did we keep these problems out of our sport.\n\nI've got a high degree of confidence that the answer will be yes.\n\n\n\nQ. Will we know if you have someone who is in violation and fails the appeal process? Will we know who that person is, the suspension, the details?\n\nCOMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: As I said earlier, at the end of the process, we will in all likelihood, I don't know exactly what information we'll provide, but we would provide information that there's been a positive test and there's been an adjudication of that as a result. The form that that takes exactly, we have not finished that would be my guess. As soon as we get a positive test, we'll get right to work on it.\n\nJOEL SCHUCHMANN: PGA TOUR Commissioner Tim Finchem, thank you.\n\n\n\nEnd of FastScripts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=44005", "page_content": "Browse by Sport Find us on Subscribe to RSS Click to go to\n\nAsaptext.com View our\n\ne-Brochure AT&T NATIONAL\n\nJuly 3, 2007\n\nTim Finchem\n\nBETHESDA, MARYLAND\n\n\n\nQ. In '09, is Avenel most likely going to be the site of this tournament?\n\nCOMMISSIONER FINCHEM: I wouldn't say that. I think that we will work with the Foundation on a variety of options. Really the struggle with Avenel in 2009 is that it is just starting construction this year. Considering that we might be comfortable making a decision on Avenal, but depending how construction goes, so we definitely have a number of options.\n\n\n\nQ. Where does RTJ fit into that?\n\nCOMMISSIONER FINCHEM: It would certainly be an option.\n\n\n\nQ. Moving it to another market for the years you're having a major, the U.S. Amateur and having the two so close together --\n\nCOMMISSIONER FINCHEM: I wouldn't rule it out. I certainly wouldn't rule it out. But I do think the Foundation and we agree that Washington is where we want to be.\n\nYou know, if moving to another market for a year is part of the best thing for all factors, you know, possibly. But I think you have to recognize that the Amateur is going to be here and the Open is going to be here, that puts a lot of pressure -- it's possible.\n\nBut Tiger certainly is committed to Washington, and wanting to be in the nation's capital and try to play here as much as possible. And of course that would be a big help if Congressional saw its way free to have us here frequently over the years as part of a rotation or whatever. It's something we'll have to sort out.\n\n\n\nQ. Given the military presence in this tournament, would it be realistic to think there might be a military-based course in this area like Andrews that could stage an event like this?\n\nCOMMISSIONER FINCHEM: Well, there are some military courses and I think that it could be staged there. The reality is that an awful lot of -- probably a lot of work would have to be done to get the golf course in shape and position to be able to challenge the players. That's usually an expensive undertaking at a facility that's not used to being kept -- well, designed in such a way to challenge the players and kept at a quality level from a speed standpoint.\n\nIt's not to say we wouldn't have to have it there to take advantage of what you're talking about, because it would be a good fit. But I think that would be the challenge. As we develop a list of options, I'm sure if the Foundation is amenable to doing that, but it would be speculative to suggest a place if such-and-such happened. But I think all options we would consider.\n\n\n\nQ. Is it possible you might have a rotation for this tournament?\n\nCOMMISSIONER FINCHEM: It's possible. It's possible. I honestly at this point, I don't think we nor the Foundation have any particular game plan. I think that right now all the energy has been put into getting this thing staged for this year, and conversations about post-2008 will now start as we get into the fall and most likely into the first six months of next year.\n\n\n\nQ. Did I understand you right that you said there's a possibility that you would take this on the road somewhere out of Washington for a year?\n\nCOMMISSIONER FINCHEM: No. The question was: Is there a scenario where maybe it would leave for a year, given the fact that there's a major championship coming here. And I said, I don't want to never say never. I think the focus is Washington, D.C. for the long term, but we've got to be practical and see what develops in terms of what can happen.\n\nIf that were to happen, I assume it would be a one-off. But here again, I think I'm being speculative.\n\n\n\nQ. Is this something you would like to see become like the Byron Nelson and the Memorial, things like that, something that is going to be a fixture?\n\nCOMMISSIONER FINCHEM: Absolutely. I think the whole premise here was that you only have a few players that -- maybe one per generation, that carry with them the import and impact of a Palmer or Nicklaus. And we think that's the situation here, given what Tiger has achieved in his first 11 years out here.\n\nAnd we assume that, you know, 30 years from now, we'll be seeing Tiger and his 30-year-old daughter and maybe some other kids still very involved in the tournament, just like Jack and his family are involved, and just like Arnold and his family are involved.\n\nSo I would see that pattern being what happens here. We certainly hope so. That's the thought process.\n\n\n\nQ. Is that a fine line to walk with somebody who is a current player?\n\nCOMMISSIONER FINCHEM: You know, I got that question a couple of months ago from somebody, I think it was somebody from the New York Times. But I mean, Jack Nicklaus was 35 when he began hosting the Memorial, and he won his last major at 46.\n\nDuring those years when he was -- and then he kept playing Memorial as he kept playing golf. So it was never a problem. It was never a problem. I don't anticipate it being a problem here.\n\n\n\nQ. Do you see it staying at a limited field like this and what is your reaction to the players that feel it's unfair where some of these guys that are out grinding and trying to get their FedExCup points and whatnot, can't get in here during tournament week?\n\nCOMMISSIONER FINCHEM: It's always a balance. I do think it will continue for the foreseeable future that the Invitationals that are hosted by Palmer, Nicklaus and Woods would have the kind of field structure that they have. We've had some conversations with Jack about field structures that would be similar to what Arnold is now and what Tiger is now.\n\nBut I see that continuing. It is a recognition, if you will, of a unique kind of tournament structure.\n\nI think if I were a player, I wouldn't want to see any fields that I could otherwise get in be of that size. That just goes without saying; it's human nature.\n\nWe have to look at the big picture, total playing opportunities, total number of events and we feel good what we've done over the last ten years in that regard. We've added a number of events. Our total playing opportunities are up. But in certain weeks we want to do things a certain way that sends a certain message to the fans and the media and the television audience and people in golf about what these tournaments are, and that's what we've done here.\n\nSo, it's a balance, and you're never going to make everybody happy. But I do think the players in discussing this have now focused more on the fact that the real world in terms of playing opportunities today versus 15 years ago; that's a positive story.\n\n\n\nQ. You sort of almost have to take a deep breath and amaze yourself at how quickly an event of this magnitude got thrown together?\n\nCOMMISSIONER FINCHEM: Well, it's happened before. I was just talking to Tim on the way in, I think the Presidents Cup was announced in April and was staged here in Washington and September, and a little bit longer period of time than this one.\n\nBut if you have -- if you have the people in the community excited about doing something, and when you have a vision that captivates people, you can do just about anything.\n\nGreg McLaughlin and the Foundation have done a really good job here. We've been very pleased to help out around the edges, but they have taken leadership and done the work. But the people in the community, the members here at Congressional, many people that volunteered at the tournaments here in the past have stepped up and gotten involved: The Armed Forces got involved; the community's got involved; that's a lot of energy coming together and that's why we're off to a good start.\n\n\n\nQ. Did club officials here know that Tiger was going to be involved when you approached them?\n\nCOMMISSIONER FINCHEM: No. They had agreed to recommend it to the membership. The only question they asked was, did we believe that if it moved forward that it would be a quality event, and would it attract a quality field.\n\nWe were in discussions at that point with the Woods Foundation who went in and finished things up, and we had not completed our discussions with AT&T. But no, the club actually agreed to move forward and take it to the members without knowing that Tiger was directly involved. That was announced after that but before it went to the members.\n\n\n\nQ. Did the TOUR then put the three principle parts together, the club, the sponsor, the Woods Foundation?\n\nCOMMISSIONER FINCHEM: We got the three principle parts talking to each other, but that's normally what we do with tournaments.\n\n\n\nQ. How long was it before the Woods Foundation or Tiger said: \"I'd like to do a golf tournament on TOUR and I'd like to do it on the East Coast?\"\n\nCOMMISSIONER FINCHEM: Well, I think this might not have been printed up here, I mentioned this to not Lenny but somebody from the Post that the other day. But a number of years ago, I asked Tiger at some point in his career, was he going to be interested in doing something like Jack or Arnold, I would say maybe four or five years ago. And the answer was, \"Maybe but not now.\"\n\nTwo years ago, the Woods Foundation contacted me and Tiger indicated that when the opportunity presented itself, they would be interested; if it worked for the TOUR and it could be structured in the appropriate way, they would be interested. Now, at that time we had were just going into or coming out of television negotiations and we had a full schedule through 2012.\n\n\n\nQ. So it didn't look like it was going to happen for a while.\n\nCOMMISSIONER FINCHEM: I was very interested, but I didn't see it happening for a period of time.\n\n\n\nQ. Was there always, \"We would like to be involved but we want to do it on the East Coast?\"\n\nCOMMISSIONER FINCHEM: There was never a discussion about -- I think in my preliminary conversation with Tiger, maybe there was some discussion about Florida or the southeast, but it never got that far. There just wasn't really any talk about it because we didn't have any schedule flexibility.\n\nAnd even then when we got the -- with The INTERNATIONAL, and we waited until the 11th hour trying to marry them to a sponsor, we still looked at two other alternatives because we were not certain that all of the stars would line up here in terms of a place to play, a great title sponsor. Because if you're going to do an event with Tiger Woods, and he's going to land his persona and his energy, it's going to be a pretty special event.\n\nAnd so that's the way we felt, that's the way the Foundation felt. So it had to all come together and so we were looking at two other markets with two other sponsors for a period of three weeks.\n\n\n\nQ. But it would not have involved Tiger.\n\nCOMMISSIONER FINCHEM: It would not have involved Tiger.\n\n\n\nQ. When did you focus on the combination that you got after the end of The INTERNATIONAL; immediately?\n\nCOMMISSIONER FINCHEM: I'd have to see -- yeah, we went right to -- we went right to work. We had three options within ten days coming together. We quickly prioritized Washington because, A, we had a huge negative out pouring when we left. I mean, the people here really wanted PGA TOUR golf; that was clear.\n\nTwo, it was the biggest in three markets.\n\nThree, the Congress being here, we had a lot of members of Congress that expressed an interest in us coming back as soon as possible.\n\nFour, if, on the Tiger Foundation option, clearly the nation's capital was the best fit to provide a forum to tell a story of the Tiger Woods Foundation.\n\nSo all of those things argued for Washington. There were some good options, but that became the No. 1 option details with the sponsor -- that went very quickly. That whole thing was done in the space of two weeks.\n\n\n\nQ. What were your other two cities?\n\nCOMMISSIONER FINCHEM: I think I had publically said this in the past, but we looked at Portland, Oregon and the Twin Cities.\n\n\n\nQ. Is the modified Stableford scoring system just going to die a slow death, or do you have an emotional attachment to having that on the TOUR?\n\nCOMMISSIONER FINCHEM: It has died a death. I mean, it's not on the TOUR right now. So it would be would have to be resuscitated to come back to answer your question. I suppose it could be. It seemed like that concept, at first -- the first few years, it was a bit of a struggle for the fans to get their arms around it. Then it generated some interest for a few years, and then it kind of lost its appeal. I don't know exactly why that was.\n\nThe INTERNATIONAL was hit with the perfect storm. There were three or four different factors to led to us finally concluding that we should move forward; it wasn't just any one thing, but a number of things.\n\n\n\nEnd of FastScripts\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.golfchannel.com/news/tim-finchem-davis-love-iii-meet-media-wednesday-congressional", "page_content": "AUGUSTA, GA - APRIL 11: Kenny Perry plays his second shot on the first hole during the final round of the 2010 Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club on April 11, 2010 in Augusta, Georgia.

I\u2019m a native of an urban-suburban area. I grew up in a city plagued by gun violence and gang violence and drug violence.\u201d \u2013 Judge Brett Kavanaugh, on the second day of his Senate hearings for his nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States\"\n\n- - -\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s not even from D.C. He was born in Washington, but he was raised in Bethesda. And yeah, Bethesda \u2014 a suburb where the median household income is close to $200,000 \u2014 might not seem like such a dangerous place to you.\n\nLet me tell you something: I know what Kavanaugh\u2019s talking about. I, too, grew up in the crime-ridden streets of Bethesda.\n\nBy day, I was surrounded by drug dealers, pushing their Ritalin from their lockers and marijuana in the student parking lots. Every night, when I came home from lacrosse practice, I walked through streets flooded with white-collar criminals. On the weekends, juvenile delinquents filled the mall: Loitering, shoplifting, carousing \u2014 always unsupervised. There was no escape. You could try to call the police, but their idea of handcuffs was a slap on the wrist. The teens answered to no one.\n\nWhen I got home, where I should have felt safest, I\u2019d find my father lying on his SEC filings. My mom and I were just supposed to look the other way. He\u2019d buy my silence with extravagant gifts. I knew something wasn\u2019t right. But when crime is all you know, how can you ever learn right from wrong? And who was I going to tell? All the dads on my block were in on it. They were the first gang I knew, but they wouldn\u2019t be the last.\n\nNo matter what I did, I felt like I was destined to follow in his footsteps, first by attending Georgetown Prep and then \u2014 it seemed pointless to imagine an alternative \u2014 Yale. You think it\u2019s hard to escape a cycle of poverty? You should try escaping a cycle of illegally-acquired wealth.\n\nAs I got older, I saw things I could never unsee. The Lawrence Franklin espionage scandal. The Smoothie King stickup. The underage drinking at Dewey Beach. My God, the drinking. These children were animals. Sure, it was Beach Week. But what is this, the Purge? The adults are as bad as the kids. Go ahead and ask them. Even the Maryland Attorney General will tell you he has \u201cno moral authority over other people\u2019s children at beach week.\u201d\n\nIt was obvious to me that Beach Week wasn\u2019t anybody\u2019s first time consuming alcohol. These are repeat offenders we\u2019re dealing with. Hardened criminals. I didn\u2019t understand why recidivism rates were so high in the United States until I started running with these committed felons. There was no stopping them.\n\nCrime is in the culture there. They have you read The Outsiders and The Great Gatsby at such an impressionable age. And if that doesn\u2019t tell you enough about our school system, let me put it this way: Kavanaugh came out of an education system so subpar, he doesn\u2019t even know how birth control works.\n\nI\u2019d say the only thing more dangerous than being a young boy in Bethesda is being a young girl literally anywhere in America after Kavanaugh gets confirmed.\n\n- - -\n\nRead more from Jessica M.

That total compensation included a bonus of $10,611,113, which included distributions over a \u201cthree-year bonus cycle based on long-term objectives achieved over 2014, 2015 and 2016,\u201d according to a PGA Tour spokeswoman. Finchem\u2019s base salary was reported as $906,646 and he received additional compensation of $698,946.\n\nHe also received $6.67 million in compensation from related organizations, according to the 990.\n\nFinchem, who retired in late 2016 after taking over as commissioner in 1994, is credited with bringing a financial windfall to the Tour as prize money grew to nearly $300 million during his tenure. That prize money figure did not include the majors.\n\nIn 2016, Finchem was paid $4.47 million, which included a base salary of $1.19 million and bonus pay of $3 million. He received another $4.7 million from related organizations, according to tax records. His total compensation from the Tour was $3.99 million in 2015, including bonus pay of $2.7 million. He received another $2 million from related organizations that year.\n\nThe former commissioner was by far the highest-paid person listed on the Tour\u2019s tax filings for 2017. Current commissioner Jay Monahan received total compensation of $4.78 million that included a base salary of $998,077 plus bonus and incentive pay of $2.8 million.\n\nOutside of Finchem and Monahan, there were 14 others among the Tour\u2019s officers and highest paid employees who made more than $1 million in 2017. Thomas E. Wade, the PGA Tour\u2019s chief commercial officer, received $3.1 million, according to the tax records.\n\nPlayers who earned the most prize money were listed as independent contractors. Justin Thomas, the season\u2019s FedEx Cup winner, led the way in 2017 with $17.1 million followed by Jordan Spieth ($11.8 million) and Dustin Johnson ($10.5 million).\n\nWorth W. Calfee, who is the former president of the Web.com Tour, received $1.5 million in compensation, which included a bonus of $784,293.\n\nThe PGA Tour has non-profit status that lawmakers have unsuccessfully challenged in the past. To compare the Tour to other pro sports, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell made $31.7 million in 2015, the last year for which his salary was reported.\n\nIn 2017, the Tour paid $28.9 million in compensation to current officers, directors, trustees and key employees, compared to $20.5 million in 2016.\n\nTotal revenue increased to $1.47 billion, up by about 15 percent over the previous year. Total expenses also grew to $1.41 billion compared to $1.2 billion the previous year. The Tour says its organization and its tournaments generated more than $180 million in charitable donations in 2017.\n\nIn revenue, the Tour reported $458 million in TV rights, up from $433 million in 2016. It spent about $212 million on TV/production/broadcast expenses in 2017."}]}
